For some, it is understood to be any philosophy after 1780 originating on the European continent (Germany, France, Italy, etc.). Such an understanding would make Georg von Wright or Rudolf Carnap – respectively, a Finnish-born philosopher of language and a German-born logician who taught for many years in the US – a “continental philosopher,” an interpretation neither they nor their followers would easily accept. For others, “continental philosophy” refers to a style of philosophizing, one more attentive to the world of experience and less focused on a rigorous analysis of concepts or linguistic usage. In this and the accompanying seven volumes in this series, “continental philosophy” will be understood historically as a tradition that has its roots in several different ways of approaching and responding to Immanuel Kant’s critical philosophy, a tradition that takes its definitive form at the beginning of the twentieth century as the phenomenological tradition, with its modern roots in the work of Edmund Husserl. As such, continental philosophy emerges as a tradition distinct from the tradition that has identified itself as “analytic” or “Anglo-American,” and that locates its own origins in the logical analyses and philosophy of language of Gottlob Frege. Whether or not there is in fact a sharp divergence between the work of Husserl and Frege is itself a contested question, but what cannot be contested is that two distinct historical traditions emerged early in the twentieth century from these traditions’ respective interpretations of Husserl (and Heidegger) and Frege (and Russell). The aim of this history of continental philosophy is to trace the developments in one of these traditions from its roots in Kant and his contemporaries through to its most recent manifestations. Together, these volumes present a coherent and comprehensive account of the continental philosophical tradition vii Volume 1\n\nseries preface\n\nthat offers readers a unique resource for understanding this tradition’s complex and interconnected history. Because history does not unfold in a perfectly linear fashion, telling the history of continental philosophy cannot simply take the form of a chronologically organized series of “great thinker” essays. And because continental philosophy has not developed in a vacuum, telling its history must attend to the impact of figures and developments outside philosophy (in the sciences, social sciences, mathematics, art, politics, and culture more generally) as well as to the work of some philosophers not usually associated with continental philosophy. Such a series also must attend to significant philosophical movements and schools of thought and to the extended influence of certain philosophers within this history, either because their careers spanned a period during which they engaged with a range of different theorists and theoretical positions or because their work has been appropriated and reinterpreted by subsequent thinkers. For these reasons, the volumes have been organized with an eye toward chronological development but, in so far as the years covered in each volume overlap those covered in the subsequent volume, they have been organized as well with the aim of coordinating certain philosophical developments that intersect in a fashion that is not always strictly chronological. Volume 1 begins with the origins of continental philosophy in Kant and the earliest responses to his critical philosophy, and presents an overview of German idealism, the major movement in philosophy from the late eighteenth to the middle of the nineteenth century. In addition to Kant, the period covered in the first volume was dominated by Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, and together their work influenced not just philosophy, but also art, theology, and politics. This volume thus covers Kant’s younger contemporary Herder, and his readers Schiller and Schlegel – who shaped much of the subsequent reception of Kant in art, literature, and aesthetics; the “Young Hegelians” – including Bruno Bauer, Ludwig Feuerbach, and David Friedrich Strauss – whose writings would influence Engels and Marx; and the tradition of French utopian thinking in such figures as Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Proudhon. In addition to Kant’s early critics – Jacobi, Reinhold, and Maimon – significant attention is also paid to the later critic of German idealism Arthur Schopenhauer, whose appropriation and criticism of theories of cognition later had a decisive influence on Friedrich Nietzsche. Volume 2 addresses the second half of the nineteenth century, in part as a response to the dominance of Hegelian philosophy. These years saw revolutionary developments in both European politics and philosophy, and five great critics dominated the European intellectual scene: Feuerbach, Marx, Søren Kierkegaard, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Nietzsche. Responding in various ways to Hegelian philosophy and to the shifting political landscape of Europe and viii Volume 1\n\nseries preface\n\nthe United States, these thinkers brought to philosophy two guiding orientations – materialism and existentialism – that introduced themes that would continue to play out throughout the twentieth century. The second half of the nineteenth century also saw the emergence of new schools of thought and new disciplinary thinking, including the birth of sociology and the social sciences, the development of French spiritualism, the beginning of American pragmatism, radical developments in science and mathematics, and the development of hermeneutics beyond the domains of theology and philology into an approach to understanding all varieties of human endeavor. Volume 3 covers the period between the 1890s and 1930s, a period that witnessed revolutions in the arts, science, and society that set the agenda for the twentieth century. In philosophy, these years saw the beginnings of what would grow into two distinct approaches to doing philosophy: analytic and continental. It also saw the emergence of phenomenology as a new rigorous science, the birth of Freudian psychoanalysis, and the maturing of the discipline of sociology. Volume 3 thus examines the most influential work of a remarkable series of thinkers who reviewed, evaluated, and transformed nineteenthcentury thought, among them Henri Bergson, Émile Durkheim, Sigmund Freud, Martin Heidegger, Edmund Husserl, Karl Jaspers, Max Scheler, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. It also initiated an approach to philosophizing that saw philosophy move from the lecture hall or the private study into an active engagement with the world, an approach that would continue to mark continental philosophy’s subsequent history. The developments and responses to phenomenology after Husserl are the focus of the essays in Volume 4. An ambiguity inherent in phenomenology – between conscious experience and structural conditions – lent itself to a range of interpretations. While some existentialists focused on applying phenomenology to the concrete data of human experience, others developed phenomenology as conscious experience in order to analyze ethics and religion. Still other phenomenologists developed notions of structural conditions to explore questions of science, mathematics, and conceptualization. Volume 4 covers all the major innovators in phenomenology – notably Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and the later Heidegger – as well as its extension into religion, ethics, aesthetics, hermeneutics, and science. Volume 5 concentrates on philosophical developments in political theory and the social sciences between 1920 and 1968, as European thinkers responded to the difficult and world-transforming events of the time. While some of the significant figures and movements of this period drew on phenomenology, many went back further into the continental tradition, looking to Kant or Hegel, Marx or Nietzsche, for philosophical inspiration. Key figures and movements discussed in this volume include Adorno, Horkheimer, and the Frankfurt School, ix Volume 1\n\nseries preface\n\nSchmitt, Marcuse, Benjamin, Arendt, Bataille, black existentialism, French Marxism, Saussure, and structuralism. These individuals and schools of thought responded to the “crisis of modernity” in different ways, but largely focused on what they perceived to be liberal democracy’s betrayal of its own rationalist ideals of freedom, equality, and fraternity. One other point about the period covered in this volume is worthy of note: it is during these years that we see the initial spread of continental philosophy beyond the European continent. This happens largely because of the emigration of European Jewish intellectuals to the US and UK in the 1930s and 1940s, be it the temporary emigration of figures such as Adorno, Horkheimer, Lévi-Strauss, and Jakobson or the permanent emigration of Marcuse, Arendt, and Gurwitsch. As the succeeding volumes will attest, this becomes a central feature of continental philosophy’s subsequent history. Volume 6 examines the major figures associated with poststructuralism and the second generation of critical theory, the two dominant movements that emerged in the 1960s, which together brought continental philosophy to the forefront of scholarship in a variety of humanities and social science disciplines and set the agenda for philosophical thought on the continent and elsewhere from the 1960s to the present. In addition to essays that discuss the work of such influential thinkers as Althusser, Foucault, Deleuze, Derrida, Lyotard, Irigaray, Habermas, Serres, Bourdieu, and Rorty, Volume 6 also includes thematic essays on issues including the Nietzschean legacy, the linguistic turn in continental thinking, the phenomenological inheritance of Gadamer and Ricoeur, the influence of psychoanalysis, the emergence of feminist thought and a philosophy of sexual difference, and the importation of continental philosophy into literary theory. Before turning to Volume 7, a few words on the institutional history of continental philosophy in the United States are in order, in part because the developments addressed in Volumes 6–8 cannot be fully appreciated without recognizing some of the events that conditioned their North American and anglophone reception. As has been mentioned, phenomenologists such as Alfred Schutz and Aron Gurwitsch, and other European continental philosophers such as Herbert Marcuse and Hannah Arendt, began relocating to the United States in the 1930s and 1940s. Many of these philosophers began their work in the United States at the University in Exile, established in 1933 as a graduate division of the New School for Social Research for displaced European intellectuals. While some continental philosophy was taught elsewhere around the United States (at Harvard University, Yale University, the University at Buffalo, and elsewhere), and while the journal Philosophy and Phenomenological Research began publishing in 1939, continental philosophy first truly began to become an institutional presence in the United States in the 1960s. In 1961, John Wild (1902–72) left Harvard to become Chair of the Department of Philosophy at Northwestern University. With a commitment from the provost of the university x Volume 1\n\nseries preface\n\nand the Northwestern University Press to enable him to launch the Northwestern Series in Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy, Wild joined William Earle and James Edie, thus making Northwestern a center for the study of continental philosophy. Wild set up an organizational committee including himself, Earle, Edie, George Schrader of Yale, and Calvin Schrag (a former student of Wild’s at Harvard, who was teaching at Northwestern and had recently accepted an appointment at Purdue University), to establish a professional society devoted to the examination of recent continental philosophy. That organization, the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP), held its first meeting at Northwestern in 1962, with Wild and Gurwitsch as the dominant figures arguing for an existential phenomenology or a more strictly Husserlian phenomenology, respectively. Others attending the small meeting included Erwin Straus, as well as Northwestern graduate students Edward Casey and Robert Scharff, and today SPEP has grown into the second largest society of philosophers in the United States. Since those early days, many smaller societies (Heidegger Circle, Husserl Circle, Nietzsche Society, etc.) have formed and many journals and graduate programs devoted to continental philosophy have appeared. In addition, many of the important continental philosophers who first became known in the 1960s – including Gadamer, Ricoeur, Foucault, Derrida, Lyotard, and Habermas – came to hold continuing appointments at major American universities (although, it must be mentioned, not always housed in departments of philosophy) and, since the 1960s, much of the transmission of continental philosophy has come directly through teaching as well as through publications. The transatlantic migration of continental philosophy plays a central role in Volume 7, which looks at developments in continental philosophy between 1980 and 1995, a time of great upheaval and profound social change that saw the fruits of the continental works of the 1960s beginning to shift the center of gravity of continental philosophizing from the European continent to the anglophone philosophical world and, in particular, to North America. During these years, the pace of translation into English of French and German philosophical works from the early twentieth century as well as the very recent past increased tremendously, and it was not uncommon to find essays or lectures from significant European philosophers appearing first in English and then subsequently being published in French or German. In addition, the period covered in this volume also saw the spread of continental philosophy beyond the confines of philosophy departments, as students and faculty in centers of humanities and departments of comparative literature, communication studies, rhetoric, and other interdisciplinary fields increasingly drew on the work of recent continental philosophers. Volume 7 ranges across several developments during these years – the birth of postmodernism, the differing philosophical traditions of France, Germany, and Italy, the third generation of critical theory, and the so-called xi Volume 1\n\nseries preface\n\n“ethical turn” – while also examining the extension of philosophy into questions of radical democracy, postcolonial theory, feminism, religion, and the rise of performativity and post-analytic philosophy. Fueled by an intense ethical and political desire to reflect changing social and political conditions, the philosophical work of this period reveals how continental thinkers responded to the changing world and to the key issues of the time, notably globalization, technology, and ethnicity. The eighth and final volume in this series attempts to chart the most recent trends in continental philosophy, which has now developed into an approach to thinking that is present throughout the world and engaged with classical philosophical problems as well as current concerns. The essays in this volume focus more on thematic developments than individual figures as they explore how contemporary philosophers are drawing on the resources of the traditions surveyed in the preceding seven volumes to address issues relating to gender, race, politics, art, the environment, science, citizenship, and globalization. While by no means claiming to have the last word, this volume makes clear the dynamic and engaged quality of continental philosophy as it confronts some of the most pressing issues of the contemporary world. As a designation, “continental philosophy” can be traced back at least as far as John Stuart Mill’s On Bentham and Coleridge (1840), where he uses it to distinguish the British empiricism of Bentham from a tradition on the continent in which he sees the influence of Kant. Since that time, and especially since the early twentieth century, the term has been used to designate philosophies from a particular geographical region, or with a particular style (poetic or dialectical, rather than logical or scientistic). For some, it has been appropriated as an honorific, while for others it has been used more pejoratively or dismissively. Rather than enter into these polemics, what the volumes in this series have sought to do is make clear that one way to understand “continental philosophy” is as an approach to philosophy that is deeply engaged in reflecting on its own history, and that, as a consequence, it is important to understand the history of continental philosophy. While each of the volumes in this series was organized by its respective editor as a volume that could stand alone, the eight volumes have been coordinated in order to highlight various points of contact, influence, or debate across the historical period that they collectively survey. To facilitate these connections across the eight volumes, cross-referencing footnotes have been added to many of the essays by the General Editor. To distinguish these footnotes from those of the authors, they are indicated by an asterisk (*). Alan D.

This has historically not been the case for philosophers in the analytic tradition, in contrast to which “continental philosophy” has defined itself. Over time, this has changed somewhat with respect to Kant himself. P. F. Strawson’s The Bounds of Sense2 opened the way for philosophical discussions within analytical philosophy that took seriously some of the epistemological and metaphysical arguments presented in the Critique of Pure Reason so that questions about “transcendental claims” and “transcendental arguments” are now an accepted part of the analytic discussions of theoretical philosophy. Moreover, John Rawls’s appropriation of Kant has proved to be so influential within analytic ethics and social and political philosophy that “Kantian” approaches and positions are not only discussed, but also widely held by many prominent analytic philosophers in those areas. However, this has not yet occurred with regard to the other figures who followed 1. See my “Continental Philosophy,” in The Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Donald Borchert (ed.) (Farmington Hills, MI: Thomson Gale, 2006), vol. 2, 488–9. 2. P. F. Strawson, The Bounds of Sense (London: Methuen, 1966).\n\n1 Volume 1\n\nthomas nenon\n\nKant and whose work is described and analyzed in this volume.3 Within continental philosophy, by contrast, the direct or indirect influence of these figures can hardly be overstated. Hegel, Marx, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche, for instance, have long belonged to the standard repertoire of discussions in continental philosophy. A course on “nineteenth-century philosophy” has commonly been offered in departments with an interest in continental philosophy or even the history of philosophy, usually taught by philosophers who think of themselves as experts in continental philosophy. Yet Hegel’s own work is unthinkable without the contributions of figures such as Herder, Fichte, and Schelling, as the following essays will document; it is well known how much Schopenhauer’s work had an influence on Nietzsche; Kierkegaard heard lectures by Schelling in Berlin that had a strong influence on his critical dialogue with Kant and Hegel; and the figures described in the last two chapters – Bauer, Strauss, and Stirner, on the one hand, and the “French utopian thinkers,” on the other – were sources of inspiration and critical analysis for the younger Marx as well. To put it rather pointedly: one of the main differences between continental and analytic philosophy has been that Kant and the figures described in this volume have remained an important part of the continental philosophical tradition, but their work has not generally been regarded as philosophically significant and relevant for the analytic tradition of the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.4 Even more importantly, Kant and the other figures whose work is analyzed in this volume have remained not just historical figures, but rather integral and living parts of the tradition of continental philosophy where their philosophical positions continue to be taken seriously and serve as a point of departure for current discussions of philosophical issues.5 This has always been the case for Kant and Hegel in particular, but increasingly in the past few years also for some of the less well-known figures such as Herder, Fichte, and Schelling. Part of the intent of this volume is to reinforce this trend and to introduce readers to other figures in the decades following Kant whose work was not only influential in its time, but also still deserves serious critical consideration today. 3. Although, as Terry Pinkard notes in his essay in this volume, this situation has recently been changing with respect to Hegel. 4. An exception would be the movement within American philosophy that came to be known as “process philosophy,” oriented on the work of Alfred North Whitehead, Charles Hartshorne, and Paul Weiss, whose thought is in many ways reminiscent of Hegel’s. By the 1960s and 1970s, however, this was no longer part of the mainstream of American analytic philosophy, but more a movement of its own; and even this movement locates its historical roots less in the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century philosophers who are included in this volume than on the history of philosophy as a whole. 5. Consider, for example, the importance of Kant in the oeuvre not only of Jürgen Habermas, but also of Michel Foucault.\n\n2 Volume 1\n\nintroduction\n\nThe notion of an “origin” also conveys the sense of a new beginning. Certainly Kant’s own description of his critical turn in terms of a “Copernican revolution” suggests that he himself thought that his approach to traditional problems in metaphysics represented a completely new way to address those problems. And subsequent readers have tended to take him at his word on this point, seeing Kantian philosophy as the new point of departure from which they must begin or as a particularly new and unique threat to the insights attained by previous philosophers, religious traditions, or even common sense. At the same time, though, Kant clearly locates himself within the framework of the main directions in modern philosophy, namely rationalism and empiricism, and within the predominant intellectual movement of his age, the Enlightenment. Hence even Kant himself was aware that his new approach to traditional questions was not an absolute beginning, but was rather the culmination of a discussion that had begun with the advent of modern science and modern philosophy and in a certain sense can also be located within the arc of the history of philosophy as a whole that goes back for him to Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics. In fact, one of the distinguishing marks of the tradition of philosophy that Kant establishes is a keen sense of the awareness of one’s own place within an overarching historical development. This is in some regards ironic in light of his claim to have solved the problems once and for all in a way that would make further philosophical progress on these issues superfluous, even though his political essays suggest that further political progress is not only possible, but also necessary and perhaps even inevitable. The essays of this volume show how this conception of thinking as essentially located within a specific historical context comes to take center stage in the philosophers who follow. Of course, Kant was not the first philosopher of his age whose work exhibits such an awareness. One hallmark of the Enlightenment movement as a whole was its emphasis on the notion of “progress” as the gradual unfolding of reason in history. When the Prussian Academy of the Sciences posed the prize question “What is Enlightenment?” in 1783, part of the motivation for the question was the perception that the age of Enlightenment had already reached its zenith, so that when Kant characterizes his own age as the “age of Enlightenment,” he is locating himself and his thinking in terms of a movement and historical developments that had formed the background for his work, but was about to enter a new phase. Moreover, when Kant, in the essay that represents his response to that question,6 describes enlightenment as the process of liberating oneself from the self-imposed tutelage that results not from a lack of understanding, but from a 6. Immanuel Kant, “What is Enlightenment?,” in Gesammelte Schriften, begonnen von der Königlich Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (Berlin: de Guyter, 1900– ) (known as Akademie-Ausgabe), VIII, 33–42; hereafter cited as AA followed by volume and page numbers.\n\n3 Volume 1\n\nthomas nenon\n\nlack of resolve or courage to use one’s understanding without the guidance of another, he is also taking a position that goes beyond the previously predominant rationalist themes of the Enlightenment. The emphasis in Christian Wolff ’s (1679–1754) variation of Leibnizian philosophy that had been Kant’s philosophical starting-point before the critical turn, had been on the primary task of enlightenment as the development of the intellect by making concepts clear and distinct in order to lead to correct beliefs that will then serve as inevitable catalysts to right action.7 As we will see in Chapter 1 below, Kant will rather see the primary role of philosophical clarification in vindicating common sense by adopting some philosophical positions that are at first every bit as counterintuitive as the view that the earth goes around the sun in order to justify our everyday beliefs about our ability to experience natural objects in the world. More importantly, though, in the moral realm he will see his philosophy of pure practical reason as combating false theories that could undermine our healthy natural instincts about right and wrong. In the essay “What is Enlightenment?” he is going even further by attributing a lack of enlightenment to false dispositions such as timidity and lack of resolve while acknowledging the barriers placed by social institutions such as the church and insecure rulers who fear that free-thinking individuals will threaten their power. Of course, even before the appearance of this essay and Kant’s critical works, there had been other criticisms of certain one-sided tendencies within the Enlightenment movement. Two prime motivating factors for the Enlightenment were the development of modern natural science and the power of the new model that it offered, and the emergence of middle classes who, at least according to their own self-understanding, depended more on their individual initiatives, skills, and knowledge than on inherited privileges for their prosperity. Each of these trends will continue to play a role in the further intellectual and artistic developments at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries, but with some important modifications. The two names Kant mentions in conjunction with modern natural science are Copernicus and Newton; two centuries earlier, Descartes and Hobbes had cited Galileo as their model. What united all of them was that the mathematically oriented mechanistic model advanced by modern physics changed the general view of the world. Exceptionless laws that hold for all kinds of objects replace observations about general tendencies of different kinds of things, and blind causal explanations seem to make teleological explanations superfluous. 7. Werner Schneider’s work Die wahre Aufklärung: Zum Selbstverständnis der deutschen Aufklärung (Freiburg: Alber, 1974) provides an excellent summary and overview of this development along with several examples of lesser known figures whose languages and approaches remain strongly indebted to this rationalist legacy.\n\n4 Volume 1\n\nintroduction\n\nAt the same time, this seems to raise problems about determinism and how to account for freedom, and therefore for moral and legal notions of individual accountability. It also seems to present a picture of nature as a complicated but ultimately blind, perhaps even lifeless machine. So we will see part of Kant’s interest and attractiveness for subsequent thinkers in his attempt to reconcile causal determinism within nature, on the one hand, with the idea of freedom and human moral agency, on the other. Others, for instance Herder, will try to reconcile mechanism and teleology along Leibnizian lines; and following him and Kant’s political writings, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel will try to show how mechanistic explanations at a micro-level do not preclude seeing history itself from an overall teleological perspective. All of the figures covered in this volume stand under the sway of the power of the model of modern natural science, but all of them seek alternatives to a simple mechanistic approach to traditional philosophical problems and to our everyday insights about the world and our place within it. Some of the key categories that will arise as alternatives to this model are concepts such as “life” and “spirit” that will continue to play an important role in response to the challenges posed by the natural scientific model well into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Similarly, the concepts of “culture”8 and “history” that emerge as central philosophical themes during the period covered in this volume will remain crucial concepts that call for different ways of thinking and different scholarly and scientific approaches than those of modern natural science. It is therefore no accident that these concepts have played a particularly strong role in the continental philosophical tradition, which has defined itself since its inception as an attempt to avoid the reductionist tendencies of philosophies that are too one-sidedly under the sway of the model of the mathematically oriented natural sciences. The notion of “freedom” in a somewhat different sense is connected with the second overall modern trend mentioned above, that is, the emergence of the new middle classes. “Freedom” here has a social and political connotation according to which individual human beings should have greater latitude in making their decisions and determining their own fates. As modern societies gradually began to shift from agrarian to commercial and then later eventually to manufacturing societies, new groups became predominant who would come to be called the “middle classes”: “middle” in the sense of something in between the hereditary aristocracies, on the one hand, and the powerless agricultural workers, that is, peasants and serfs, on the other. In Germany, the development took place somewhat later than, for instance, in England and France, but 8. Herder’s work represents an important milestone in this regard as the notion of culture shifts from the Enlightenment notion of a set of skills to the shared habits and dispositions of a people. See the essay by Sonia Sikka in this volume.\n\n5 Volume 1\n\nthomas nenon\n\nby the eighteenth century it was well underway there as well. As opposed to England, where manufacturing began much earlier and the colonial enterprises gave rise to a very large number of rich merchants and traders, the commercial classes in Germany were represented primarily by independent handworkers and smaller merchants and traders. Even more predominant, especially as representatives for the Enlightenment as an intellectual movement, was the growing class of educated administrators and professionals – teachers and professors, pastors, lawyers, doctors – some of whom served the commercially independent classes, but most of whom were in the direct or indirect employment of the many German states still ruled by monarchs or other hereditary aristocracy. 9 By the second half of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century, a completely new class had emerged. The new middle classes came to have the means and the desire to buy journals and books, attend concerts and plays, and buy sheet music to play at home. The reading public expanded significantly and came to include women as well. Lutheran clergy had a great deal more independence within the much looser organization of that Church than had traditionally been enjoyed by the Catholic clergy. With the increasing religious tolerance that followed the Peace of Westphalia that had ended the Thirty Years’ War in the previous century, educated Jews were coming to be included in intellectual life as well. In the wake of all these changes, the role of the artist changed from being an artisan or decorative artist employed by the Church or the aristocracy to that of an independent agent creating and producing art as a profession for consumption by these new middle classes, thereby also gaining an artistic freedom previously impossible for them and emblematic for the freedom in thinking and acting to which the rest of the middle classes aspired. In some ways, then, the artists became the symbols for the middle classes as productive, independent, and creative – at least in their aspirations and, to some extent, in their professional and personal lives as well. Consistent with this trend is the concept of the “genius,” given a conceptual and theoretical grounding in Kant’s Critique of Judgment, but at the heart of all of the subsequent philosophical reflections on art and artistic creation as well. Of course, development in literature and music had not waited on the kind of philosophical justifications that Kant and his successors provided. The literary movement of Empfindsamkeit that had developed a new literary language of sentiments and emotions that connected this emerging circle of writers as friends and collaborators, was at its heights in the early 1770s. Arising out of personal relationships and the letters that these friends composed, circulated, 9. See Frederic Beiser’s Enlightenment, Romanticism, and Revolution: The Genesis of Modern German Political Thought, 1790–1800 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press 1992) for a good overview of the situation and its effects on German intellectual life in this age.\n\n6 Volume 1\n\nintroduction\n\nand read together publicly, it popularized a new genre, the epistolary novel.10 Its better-known, unruly cousin that flourished at about the same time was the Sturm und Drang movement, which stressed the passions, strong natural drives and urges, and the right of subjectivity, first in plays, then later in Germany’s most famous epistolary novel, Goethe’s The Sorrows of Young Werther in 1774. Both of these movements were consciously directed against the one-sidedness of rationalistic description of human events in literature, the tendency toward conventional moralizing, and a rule-governed aesthetics that modeled artistic production on the technical craftsmanship of other productive enterprises – be they artistic or not. Art would come to be closely associated with, and often seen as an expression of the subjectivity of the author who creates it. During the period covered by this volume, these tendencies within literature would lead to classicism, which tried to strike a balance between subjectivity and rules, between reason and the emotions, on the one hand, and romanticism with its enthusiastic endorsement of the rights of subjectivity and the passions and emotions that motivate action, on the other. In music there was a similar development at this time. Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750) served his entire professional career in the employment of the aristocracy and the Church, and Joseph Haydn (1732–1809) spent his career with the wealthy aristocratic Hungarian Esterházy family. Both of them are renowned as much for their craftsmanship as their originality, but Haydn’s case is an interesting one because he did leave an indelible mark on the history of musical composition through the key role he played in the establishment of specific forms of the symphony and of chamber music that seemed to exhibit the balance and rationality consistent with the demands of the intellect that led them to become canonical for at last the following century. Contrast this with the wellknown career of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–91), who constantly and vocally chafed at his dependency on his ecclesiastical and aristocratic sponsors as he increasingly took on the role of a musical entrepreneur, marketing his music at public concerts in the newly created symphony halls and public opera houses11 that were open to the well-to-do of all estates. Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827), too, began his career under the sponsorship of several prominent aristocrats, but even as he continues to accept their sponsorship, he sells himself 10. See Monika Nenon, Aus der Fülle der Herzen: Geselligkeit, Briefkultur und Literatur um Sophie von La Roche und Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi (Würzburg: Könighausen & Neuman, 2005). 11. Public opera houses had been introduced in Italy in the seventeenth century. The first in German-speaking countries was in Hamburg in 1678, but by the end of the eighteenth century, they were open in several other German cities including Vienna and Munich, where Mozart’s opera were performed. The national theatre in Mannheim is the oldest dramatic theatre in Germany, opened in 1779. Schiller’s play The Robbers premiered there in 1782 in the presence of the author.\n\n7 Volume 1\n\nthomas nenon\n\nto them in market terms – going to the highest bidder, so to speak – while he reduces his dependency on them through public performances of his work and through the sale of the sheet music of his chamber compositions. Franz Schubert (1797–1828) never even had a professionally paid regular position, making what little money he did from publishing his music and giving private lessons. For each of them, “freedom” meant economic independence as well as the artistic independence that they associated with it. It meant the increasing ability to control one’s own destiny and to use art as an expression of one’s own views and sensibilities according to one’s own best instincts instead of subordinating oneself to someone else’s dictates and tastes. At the same time, however, it remained true that most of the educated members of the groups from whom the leading representatives came – the professors, pastors, and teachers – continued to depend on the church or the state for their employment. Hence the German Enlightenment had always been more typically reformist than revolutionary in tone, assuring church hierarchy and the rulers that an enlightened public would more reliably recognize the truths of religion and the benefits that accrue from enlightened leadership within the bounds of the monarchic order than a people led by superstition and emotions such as fear, and that the other benefits that accrue to such a state would include the greater prosperity and success that follows from a better educated and enterprising populace. Against this backdrop, rationality and subjectivity were not seen as opposites but rather as complementary under the right circumstances. Autonomy, rightly understood, does not have to lead to instability and disorder. This was particularly the case for religion. By the middle of the eighteenth century, reinterpretations of traditional religious doctrines were becoming quite common. Particularly in the Protestant states, it had long been acceptable to reinterpret or reject many traditional teachings and beliefs as “superstition” and to reinterpret them in line with what is acceptable to reason. The Reformation’s own shift of emphasis away from the authority of the institution of the Catholic Church and its traditional beliefs in favor of an emphasis on each individual subject’s ability to receive grace, understand the Scriptures, and follow his own lights had opened the way for a theology that could re-examine other traditional beliefs and reinterpret them according to the lights of reason as well. Stories from the Scriptures about miracles could be read as metaphorical accounts about the power of spiritual healing and not historically reliable accounts about natural events. The truths of historical religion could be understood as allegorical messages about one’s moral duties, stories that were taken at face value by the less educated and those at less advanced stages of human development, but that had become increasingly unnecessary for those who were capable of understanding and following the dictates of reason alone. The essay on “The Education of Humanity” (Die Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts) by the famous playwright 8 Volume 1\n\nintroduction\n\nand author Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (1729–81) is one of the clearest and most succinct examples of this general tendency. It describes different stages of the development of human societies along the model of the intellectual and moral development of an individual human being who in childhood follows moral rules not out of internal motivations, but out of fear of punishment and hopes for rewards. As development progresses, the individual increasingly comes to understand the inherent rationality of these rules, internalizes them, and acts simply out of insight into their rightness. So, too, at earlier stages of development, religion has all sorts of taboos, superstitions, and fantastic stories about vengeful gods, horrible punishments for evildoers, and direct interventions by the gods on the behalf of those who obey them. As human rationality progresses through the ages, these are replaced by ideas of a just God with laws that benefit humankind, then later by the image of God in the form of one perfect human being, Jesus Christ, who can serve as a model for all human beings, until finally, at the stage of complete maturity and enlightenment, we come to understand the divine principles in all of us through our ability to reason, act morally, and acknowledge the transcendent dignity of all of our fellow human beings. Even in the modern, enlightened age, however, not everyone will be capable of such rational insights and autonomous moral actions, so religion continues to serve as an appropriate moral compass for those individuals or classes who have not yet reached full intellectual and moral maturity. Not just in his views about religion, but in Kant’s overall approach, his own thinking certainly fits within these parameters. His later work on religion is consistent with the reinterpretation of Christian doctrine in terms of the tenets of pure practical rationality, and his famous essay on Enlightenment also employs the language of human development and maturity. Moreover, he – along with Lessing and others – believes that Enlightenment, properly understood, leads not to social and moral disorder, but rather to free and rational assent to the overall social order in a more or less well-functioning and just state so that subjectivity and lawfulness are not only consistent with each other but can be mutually self-reinforcing principles. As we have seen, however, there were others who were not as sanguine about the conformity between enlightened subjectivity and the established social order. The Sturm und Drang movement, for instance, reflected the impatience of many, especially young, people over the repressiveness of the established orders and conventional morality. It invokes the power of nature and the passions in asserting the rights of subjectivity even when they were not necessarily subordinated to the overall goals of the state and social order. At the opposite end of the spectrum, within the established order, especially with the transition from Frederick the Great to Frederick William II in Prussia and as part of the reaction to failed reforms in the Austrian Empire, there was a reassertion of the rights of 9 Volume 1\n\nthomas nenon\n\ntradition and the need for limits on what should be publicly discussed and propagated. Even some of those who advocated freedom of thought and religion for the educated, were not necessarily in favor of removing limits on public speech for fear of confusing the members of the lower orders who continued to obey out of habit and whose underdeveloped rational capacities did not render them susceptible to the constraints imposed by enlightened reason alone. It is against this background that the monumental event of the age, the beginning of the French Revolution in summer 1789 decisively and irreversibly raised the stakes. It called into question two key assumptions that had guided the enlightenment movement, at least in Germany, until that time. As we have seen, the first is the view that increasing enlightenment does not necessarily lead to conflict with the established social and political order, but rather can strengthen it through gradual reform; the second is that progress in one area of human cultural development will be reflected in progress in other areas as well. On the latter point, one can follow Kant who, in his lectures on “Anthropology in a Pragmatic Regard” (AA VII, 322), had distinguished three different dimensions of human development. The first he calls “technical.” It involves the development of our intellectual skills and techniques for dealing with nature and material objects. These range from our ability to understand causal relationships to our ability to produce objects that help us improve our lives through technologies such as construction of shelters and agricultural techniques, as well as the production of increasingly useful and productive technologies of goods that make life more pleasant. The second dimension he calls “pragmatic.” It concerns social skills, for example, the development of speech, manners, and social arrangements that allow us to deal with each other more skillfully and effectively. At an advanced stage, these might include development of wit, rhetorical skills, and proficiencies in the arts. Finally, he lists “moral cultivation” as the most important of them. These are not the same as pragmatic skills. For instance, the skilled rhetorician may not actually be concerned with the truth of his case or the good of the audience but is rather simply interested in manipulating the audience for his own ends, whereas the morally responsible speaker would speak honestly and with the best interest of the community in mind. Although each of these dimensions of cultural development is distinct, the overall optimism of the enlightenment project was that they would progress more or less in tandem. The advances in modern science were occurring at the same time that advances in trade, commerce, and production were contributing to a greater prosperity for the middle classes; advances in administration skills and public policy were seen to support this development and hopefully lead to greater prosperity and justice for all; refinements in the arts would not only make life more pleasant, but lead to refined sensibilities that would make human beings more receptive and responsive to others; advances in knowledge and understanding would lead 10 Volume 1\n\nintroduction\n\nto greater social and religious tolerance that would remove a source of conflict and eliminate the previous destruction caused by religious wars and repression; increasingly enlightened rulers would see the benefits of free and open societies that make their states more prosperous and powerful and make their regimes more stable by reducing the tensions between the rulers and those they govern. Progress on one front implied progress on all of them. The French Revolution made clear that much of this progress depended on specific political conditions and assumptions about their continuous improvement that turned out to be questionable. So it became clear that questions about the actual progress of enlightenment would also be tied to the political circumstances in which it is pursued. Of course, even before the French Revolution, important voices had called assumptions about the mutual reinforcement of progress in these different dimensions into question. Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–78), above all and most notably, had claimed the opposite, namely that increasing civilization was leading to increasing moral degradation. Rousseau shared the Enlightenment’s optimism about the basic perfectibility of humanity and he endorsed its striving for freedom and call for the recognition of individuals based on their virtues and skills. Indeed, he was renowned for resenting his dependency on the beneficence and good graces of the wealthy and powerful of his age whose power rested not on merit but on inherited privilege, and whose exercise of their power was often arbitrary and even ruthless when it was threatened. For him, the means to human perfection was not through advances in civilization with its increasing material wealth and accomplishments in the arts, but rather through a return to nature in order to restore a natural harmony for which the technical, artistic, and administrative achievements of modernity are at best distractions, but have more often served as impediments to human flourishing and happiness. He thereby gives voice to the disappointments and frustrations of those who have become impatient with progress towards a better and more just society in which there will be a more direct relationship between achievements and rewards, in which individuals can have greater control over their own fates and be less dependent on the whims and favors of those who rule. For Rousseau, who found himself forced to flee both France and Geneva to avoid retaliations, the reactions of those whom he criticized or whose interests he threatened in his writings confirmed his view that their own interests were not aligned with those who were concerned with genuine human progress. The rising expectations of the citizens in the age of Enlightenment were not always met by the political institutions governing the societies in which they lived. His writings struck a strong chord with many, not just those who were frustrated with the lack of social progress, but also among those who had come to see rationalism as too far removed from the needs and sentiments of concrete 11 Volume 1\n\nthomas nenon\n\nhuman beings and who were dissatisfied with a view of the intellect that was set at odds with nature and who found constraints of universal and bloodless rules oppressive. Part of the problem, then, was a lack of progress in political institutions. Another part concerned the notion of progress itself and whether it was to be seen in overcoming nature or in finding a way to live more harmoniously with nature. This latter development should not necessarily be seen as a departure from the overall project of the Enlightenment, but as an internal corrective to its one-sided emphasis on the intellect. The goal remains the happiness of individual subjects not in a transcendent world, but in this life. However, this means that the intellect should no longer be seen as a completely independent source of motivation and guidance, but rather must be aligned with concrete human needs and emotions if it is to be effective. We have already seen how this corrective pertained not just to French society prior to the Revolution, but was consistent as well with literary and artistic developments at the same time in Germany. Moreover, German society during the second half of the eighteenth century faced some of the same problems, and its states shared some of the same flaws as France. The states were still run by more or – in many cases – less enlightened monarchs. The death of a monarch could lead to a complete reversal by his successor of whatever progress had been made under his reign. Even in the city-states like Hamburg, powerful patrician families operated more like an aristocracy than as members of an open civil society. The Peace of Westphalia had ended the religious wars that had ravaged Europe in the previous century, but the European powers were all in a more or less constant state of tension that intermittently erupted into armed conflicts as each strove to increase its wealth and power at the expense of its neighbors. The great powers England, France, and Spain, and the Habsburg monarchy had been at odds for centuries and much of the drain on the French finances that increased the tensions that eventually led to the Revolution can be traced back to the escalation of those conflicts during the second half of the eighteenth century. But on a somewhat smaller scale, the same was true for the lesser German states as well. Prussia as an ascendant power had gained it at the expense of its neighbors in Denmark, Poland, and Saxony, and its plans for further expansion still put it in direct conflict with Austria. During Kant’s own lifetime, a Prussian setback had led his home city of Königsberg to fall under Russian rule. For even the most enlightened monarchs, among whom Kant and most of the Prussian intellectuals counted Frederick the Great, the need to support their wars led to repeated conscriptions, increased taxes, and the search for other new sources of revenue. For Germany’s intellectuals, who were at the same time for the most part civil servants, the appropriate response was not to advocate sweeping new forms of government, but to continue to press for reforms within the bounds of the 12 Volume 1\n\nintroduction\n\nexisting social orders. The idea of radically different social orders or a social order that was not mediated through the institutions of the state seemed inconceivable to them. Even those who, like Kant, recognized that states often or usually act out of non-moral or immoral motives, believed that progress was nonetheless possible because the enlightened self-interest of the individual citizens and the rulers would force them to make the appropriate reforms in order to keep their states stable and prosperous. Up until the Revolution, the choice did not seem to be between enlightenment and the existing social order, but rather how to continue the process of enlightenment within that order. The French Revolution changed everything. For those in the anciens régimes who were always suspicious of reforms and the new freedoms that came with them, the French example served as a dramatic and irrefutable confirmation of the dangers of underestimating the consequences of allowing reforms to go too far or too quickly. Many of those who had initially welcomed the opportunity for a rapid expansion of freedoms for the bourgeoisie were appalled at the reign of terror that soon followed. Napoleon’s later invasions served to unite the rival German states against the common enemy so that the idea of a German national culture, if not for a long time a German national state began to arise. Against this background, the idea of a German Kultur, in which the individual finds his or her place within an organically developing social network and through artworks that reflect both the individuality of their creators as well as the historical and social background in which they arise, took root. This was supposed to be an alternative to the French notion of a “civilization” that overemphasizes wealth and material objects and places an overemphasis on individuality at the expense of the common good and a common identity. And finally, the very notion of the state itself and its institutions now comes into play. In a well-functioning society made up of intellectually and morally enlightened individuals, is there any need for a state at all? Are state institutions by their very nature not repressive, or is there an essential role for institutions in guaranteeing that individual liberties are secure? On the one side, what one might call the “romantic view,” stands the idea that progress will eventually lead to the elimination of the need for a state. The idea of the Greek polis of independent individuals with very little organizational structure, acting according to a common consensus, becomes a popular notion standing for the first of these two alternatives. Fichte, the early Hegel, and Marx advocate this position. The most famous articulation of the opposite view, what one might call the “realist” position, is the later Hegel’s Philosophy of Right from 1827, in which appropriate institutions are defended as the necessary realization of freedom itself. For Hegel in his mature thinking, institutions are not impediments to freedom, but rather appropriate institutions are necessary preconditions for the assurance of the rights and welfare of each individual and individuals necessarily find their identities not in their particularity, but rather 13 Volume 1\n\nthomas nenon\n\nas contributing members of the comprehensive wholes (families, professions, states) of which they are members. The essays in this volume then can be seen not just in terms of Kant and his influence, but in the way that all of the writers and theorists covered here can be located within the overall framework of the modern project as it had developed in the second half of the eighteenth century and the turns it took at the beginning of the nineteenth century. All of the authors discussed in this volume can be seen as heirs to the Enlightenment in the sense that all of them remained committed to the project and the prospect of the continued progress in human affairs. Where they differ is the accents they place on the role of reason alone to guide that process, how they strike the balance between tradition and change, what role they see for institutions in the process, and how art and philosophy should contribute to that change.\n\n14 Volume 1\n\n1 immanuel kant’s turn to transcendental philosophy Thomas Nenon\n\nThe year 1781 marks the beginning not only of a remarkably productive two decades in Kant’s own work, but in many ways also a decisive turning point in the history of philosophy. Up until that point, Kant1 was known as a gifted, but not very significant figure in the German philosophical scene. But 1781 marked the appearance of the first edition of the Critique of Pure Reason, in which Kant introduced a “critical” philosophy with a radical new approach to traditional questions in epistemology and metaphysics that completely reshaped the philosophical landscape. In the years that followed, he would produce equally significant and original contributions to philosophical ethics in his Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785), Critique of Practical Reason (1788), and in the second part of his Metaphysics of Morals (1797); an influential new approach to theories of art and the production of artworks in his Critique of Judgment (1790), novel ways of considering the philosophy of history in the Critique of Judgment and in his later political essays such as “Concerning Perpetual Peace” (1795); important reinterpretations of theological themes in all of these works and in his Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason (1793); and theories of the state and society in the first part of the Metaphysics of Morals and in his later essays. The impact that this work had on the history of philosophy in general and on\n\n1. Immanuel Kant (April 22, 1724–February 12, 1804; born and died in Königsberg, East Prussia) studied philosophy, theology, mathematics, and science at the Albertina-University of Königsberg (1740–48). He became a tutor in private families near Königsberg (1748– 54) before returning to the university to finish his dissertation and take up an appointment as Privatdocent (1755–69). He went on to be appointed Professor ordinarius for Logic and Metaphysics (1770–96).\n\n15 Volume 1\n\nthomas nenon\n\nwhat later, in the second half of the twentieth century, would come to be known as “continental philosophy” can hardly be overstated.\n\ni. early works The publications prior to 1781 are commonly referred to as Kant’s “precritical writings.” They give little hint of the scope, originality, and significance of the work that was to follow. Of relatively modest origins (his father was an independent harness-maker), Kant was raised and schooled in an atmosphere that was strongly influenced by Pietism.2 As he began his university studies at the age of sixteen, however, he was also strongly influenced by the theology professor Franz Albert Schultz (1692–1763) and the philosophy professor Martin Knutzen (1713–51), both of whom took seriously the work of the Leibnizian Christian Wolff (1679–1754), who had been banished from Prussia at the urging of some orthodox Pietists, who saw his relatively enlightened adoption of Leibnizian philosophical positions such as pre-established harmony as a threat to traditional religious belief. Other prominent influences there were professors oriented on Aristotelian philosophy and on Christian Thomasius’s (1655–1728) eclecticism. Kant’s earliest publications deal with questions at the intersection of natural science and philosophy and on methodological issues in philosophy and theology. His first book, Thoughts on the True Estimation of Living Force, written in 1746 and published in 1749 when Kant was still a young student, and his 1755 dissertation Succinct Exposition of Some Meditations on Fire and his General History of Nature and Theory of the Heavens from the same year are examples of the former; prime examples of the latter are his 1755 essay A New Exposition of the First Principles of Metaphysical Knowledge, which he defended as part of the requirements for his appointment as private docent, his essay on The Only Possible Basis of a Demonstration of the Existence of God (1763), his Investigations of the Clarity of the Principles of Natural Theology and Morals (1764), and the inaugural dissertation On the Form and Principles of the Sensible and the Intelligible World, which he defended in conjunction with his appointment to the rank of professor in 1770. The underlying issues throughout all of these works is the attempt to reconcile the empirical and rational grounds 2. A succinct and helpful overview of Kant’s earlier years can be found in Otfried Höffe, Immanuel Kant (Albany, NY: SUNY Press, 1994), 9–15. For a more extensive and thorough description of Kant’s biography and intellectual development, see Manfred Kühn, Kant: A Biography (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001). His publications from this period are all published in Gesammelte Schriften, begonnen von der Königlich Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (Berlin: de Gruyter, 1900– ) (known as the Akademie-Ausgabe), vols I and II; hereafter cited as AA followed by the volume and page numbers.\n\n16 Volume 1\n\nimmanuel kant’s turn to transcendental philosophy\n\nof knowledge and the question of the possibility and limits of metaphysical reasoning in resolving disputes regarding natural phenomena such as comets, tides, and fire as well as debates in theology, morals, and rational psychology. They also show how he began to move beyond the framework of rationalist metaphysics in the Leibniz–Wolffian mode and to incorporate the critical stance of thinkers such as Rousseau and Hume into his own work. During his years as private docent, Kant’s sole source of income was the fees paid by the students who attended his lectures. Nonetheless, it is also during this period that Kant gained a reputation for sociability and a kind of urbane cosmopolitanism in spite of the fact that he had not ventured (and never would travel) more than about a hundred miles from Königsberg.3 His appointment to a professorship in 1770 alleviated his financial concerns considerably, but during the following ten years prior to 1781, Kant’s publication output was so scant4 that this period of his career has become known as “the silent decade.”5 One way to introduce the problems that occupied Kant’s thinking during that decade is in terms of the positions he defended in his inaugural dissertation about how knowledge6 in general is possible, and more specifically rational metaphysical knowledge of what he calls the “sensible and intelligible worlds.” He notes there, for instance, that there are certain “forms” that seem to be invariant features of every object even within the sensible world, namely space and time, but that these forms are not “rational forms or nexus of objective ideas” but rather “phenomena” that “attest to some principle of universal conjunction but do not exhibit it.”7 Moreover, with regard to the “matter” or 3. Recounted by Ernst Cassirer, Kant’s Life and Works (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1981), 51–5; Höffe, Immanuel Kant, 13–15; and Kuhn, Kant, 133–222. 4. During this period, Kant did not publish any philosophical works at all. He did publish a very brief book review and two essays: one “Concerning the Different Races of Mankind”; the other, very brief essay entitled (in German) “Aufsätze, das Philanthropin betreffend” in support of a progressive educational institution. All three of these publications are contained in the Akademie-Ausgabe, vol. II. 5. Höffe employs the term and traces it back to Dilthey (Höffe, Immanuel Kant, 21). Other examples of this usage include Karl Ameriks, “Immanuel Kant,” in The Columbia History of Western Philosophy, Richard H. Popkin (ed.) (New York: Columbia University Press, 1999), 495; and Kuhn, Kant, 223. 6. I will render Kant’s term “Erkenntnis” as “knowledge” in this essay even though that usage departs in some ways from common interpretations (especially in epistemology) that take knowledge to be belief that is certainly true. For Kant, metaphysical knowledge aims at a kind of certainty that is not possible for empirical “Erkenntnisse.” For Kant, then, empirical “knowledge” aspires to truth but is in principle always subject to refutation or revision. 7. Inaugural Dissertation, in Akademie-Ausgabe, vol. II, 391; hereafter cited as ID followed by the volume and page numbers in Akademie-Ausgabe. With the exception of quotes from the Critique of Pure Reason, citations within the text identify Kant’s other works using abbreviations as follows: Critique of Practical Reason (CprR); Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (GMM); The Metaphysics of Morals (MM); Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics (Prol).\n\n17 Volume 1\n\nthomas nenon\n\n“contents” as opposed to the form of objects within the sensible world, metaphysical knowledge cannot say anything, since from the standpoint of metaphysics these appear as “accidents” or “contingencies” that cannot be derived from the concepts of those things. Knowledge of these properties or determinations of objects in the “sensible world” is given to us through sensibility, not through the intellect (commonly translated into English as “understanding” as a result of Kant’s own translation of the Latin term “intellectus” into the German “Verstand”). This “sense knowledge” provides us, he says there, “merely representations of things as they appear; intellectual knowledge by contrast are representations of things as they are” (ID, II, 392). He traces back the form of these objects to a kind of image that results from laws innate to the subject and its mind. Since these images, space and time, are the forms of all appearances, Kant says, they are nonetheless “true” because they are necessary components of the appearance of any sense object. Insight into the “intellectual world” that provides access to the “things themselves” is for Kant still seen as possible through the employment of concepts that are accessible to the intellect (at this stage Kant does not distinguish between what will later be seen as the two different faculties of the understanding and of reason). Hence, methodological reflection must restrict the use of the principles of the sensible world to appearances; however, Kant still maintains that proper employment of intellectual concepts such as “cause,” “substance,” and “necessity” can be employed to attain knowledge of the things in themselves in a manner similar to the analyses conducted in Leibnizian–Wolffian metaphysics. The guarantee for the possibility of such knowledge is the fact that, “The human mind is only affected by external things and the world is only infinitely accessible to human intuition to the extent that it, together with everything else, is sustained by one and the same infinite power of a single entity” (ID, II, 409), a view that, he admits, puts him in close company with Malebranche, “namely that we intuit everything through God” (ibid.). In spite of the similarities of several of these doctrines with the positions later expounded in the Critique of Pure Reason, for instance the conception of space and time as forms of the sensible world that have their origin in the subject and hold only for appearances, the dominant idea here is still that traditional metaphysical knowledge of things in themselves is possible through the proper employment of intellectual concepts.\n\nSpecific passages are identified by reference to the Akademie-Ausgabe by volume and page numbers. Those page numbers are listed in the margins of other editions and translations, so the reader can easily identify the passage without needing to consult the Akademie-Ausgabe itself.

In his reflections on a “general phenomenology” that would introduce a theoretical metaphysics that could provide the basis for practical philosophy, he notes that: As I thought through the theoretical part, considering its whole scope and the reciprocal relations of all of its parts, I noticed that I still lacked something essential that I had failed to pay attention to and that, in fact, constitutes the key to the whole secret of hitherto still obscure metaphysics. I asked myself: What is the ground of the relations of that in us which we call “representation” to the object? (AA X, 129–35) If the sensibility simply gives us representations of the objects and not the objects, then one finds oneself trapped in the problem that has vexed modern philosophers from Descartes to Hume, namely, how do we know that these representations are “true,” that is, correspond to the objects they purport to give us? If the reply falls out along the lines of the inaugural dissertation, and we count truth as agreement with the representations, then it seems we abandon any claims to genuine objectivity except by recourse to the creator God who governs the order of nature and the order of the human mind accordingly. Moreover, the entire edifice rests on the ability of the intellect’s concepts to grasp the true nature of the things themselves, that is, the universe, the mind, and God without any reliance on the senses – and if the guarantee for the ability of the mind’s ability to do so is supposed to be a benevolent and all-powerful creator God who is the source of the universe and the mind’s order, then this seems to fall prey to the same sort of circularity that befell Descartes. When Kant later famously attributes Hume with having awakened him from his “dogmatic slumbers” (Prol, IV, 260), it is precisely these kinds of questions that he recognizes his previous position could not answer. Kant famously describes the radicality and originality of his solution to the problem in the Critique of Pure Reason through a comparison with Copernicus’s “revolution in the way we think” (B XXII n.). Instead of assuming that the objects have a pregiven structure in themselves and then asking how human cognition can come to know it, Kant says that we should pursue the hypothesis that there are structures of knowledge that are necessary for the very experience of any object so that any object we can ever possibly experience must conform to and hence exhibit those structures. Although he makes clear that he begins 19 Volume 1\n\nthomas nenon\n\nwith this assumption as a hypothesis, he believes that the results of the analyses he presents in the Critique confirm that he has taken the right approach. Just as Copernicus begins with a counterintuitive assumption that ends up providing a better and more elegant solution that still explains the facts we observe about planetary movement in our daily lives, Kant believes that by adopting several counterintuitive philosophical assumptions, he can explain and vindicate our everyday beliefs about things that are otherwise difficult to explain. The general structure of the Critique still exhibits traces of the overall organization of Wolff ’s metaphysical system that began with a “metaphysica generalis vel ontologia,” followed by a “metaphysica specialis” that is subdivided into a rational psychology, a rational cosmology, and a rational theology. The former corresponds roughly to Kant’s “Transcendental Aesthetic” and “Transcendental Analytic,” which represents the first section of the “Transcendental Logic”; the latter to the “Transcendental Dialectic,” which makes up the second section of the “Transcendental Logic.” Together, the “Transcendental Aesthetic” and the “Transcendental Logic” are grouped together under the heading of a “Transcendental Doctrine of the Elements,” which constitutes about 80 per cent of the book. They are preceded by a brief “Preface” and a longer “Introduction,” which outline his general approach, and the book closes with a “Transcendental Doctrine of Method,” which provides some general reflections on the method of Kant’s transcendental philosophy, and an architectonic that outlines the systematic place of various philosophical topics that may be treated with the framework of transcendental philosophy. The “Transcendental Analytic” shares with traditional ontology the claim that it can show the formal principles of any object whatsoever, with the important caveat, however, that these principles apply only to the extent that these objects can be objects of experience for us. This means that it must remain mute about the possibility that there can be objects that may exist but lie beyond the range of possible experience for us. The “Transcendental Dialectic” then turns explicitly to such objects, namely the soul, the world as a whole, and God, showing why human reason inevitably gives rise to such ideas, but demonstrating that and why experience can neither confirm nor refute the existence of those objects. Much of the Critique hinges on Kant’s analysis of the very notion of “experience” (Erfahrung) itself. In fact, in several places Kant explicitly describes the project as a “Zergliederung” – literally a “dissection,” or, to use a Greek term that provides the basis for the common English translation of the term, the “analysis” (“breaking up“ or “taking apart”) – of knowledge and the appearances that are given to us in experience. Kant tries to show that experience involves more than just having sense impressions – or even having them against the backdrop of a formal backdrop of space and time as he had described in the inaugural dissertation. Rather, it must be organized in terms of concepts that bring 20 Volume 1\n\nimmanuel kant’s turn to transcendental philosophy\n\nthese impressions into some sort of unity. And, of course, from the very outset, Kant had believed that, at least for objects in the sensible world, concepts alone are not sufficient without some input from the senses. Hence Kant’s famous dictum: “Thoughts without concepts are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind” (A 51/B 75). The general view is that positive knowledge is possible only on the basis of experience, which necessarily involves both sense experience (intuitions) and the operations of the intellect (concepts). In the Critique, Kant further distinguishes between those functions of the mind that are involved in the organization and unification of intuitions into knowledge from the functions that involve the higher-order unifying operations of seeking overarching unities or ultimate grounds for knowledge in objects that lie outside the realm of sense experience. The former he calls “Verstand” or “understanding”; for the latter, he reserves the term “Vernunft” or “reason” in the strict sense. He concedes, though, that the term “reason” is often used ambiguously, sometimes as a name for the “higher faculties” encompassing both the intellect and reason and sometimes just for reason in the narrower sense. In the Critique, Kant’s primary focus is on reason only in its theoretical function, that is, in its claims to knowledge. He believes that a proper comprehension of the possibilities and limits of theoretical reason is crucial for an adequate understanding of the role and possibilities of practical reason as well, but the latter are not the primary focus of the “first Critique” from 1781. His conclusion is that the intellect in conjunction with the senses can provide us with more or less reliable, empirical knowledge of sense objects, but that reason alone cannot yield theoretical knowledge – with the sole exception of philosophical knowledge that can be gained through reflection about the necessary conditions for the possible objects of experience, that is, the empirical knowledge of natural objects that can be given to us through the senses. The former kind of knowledge follows from sense experience and hence – using the Latinate term – is called a posteriori; the latter, because it does not derive from the senses, is by contrast a priori. If the latter could tell us something new that is not just a repetition of what is contained in a concept, but rather in this case a demonstration of the necessary conditions of experience itself, it would not only be a priori – at least with regard to experience and the objects of experience – but it would also be “synthetic.” Hence, for Kant, “transcendental” (as opposed to “empirical”) knowledge, which had been the traditional goal of metaphysics, is no longer seen as pure rational knowledge about unchanging non-natural objects such as God or the immortal soul, but rather as synthetic a priori knowledge about the conditions for the possibility of the experience, and therefore of empirical knowledge of natural objects or “appearances.” The critique of pure reason is then a first step toward a system of pure reason because it would show the sources and limits of pure reason. Because the emphasis within the realm of theoretical reason is on 21 Volume 1\n\nthomas nenon\n\nthe limits of reason alone, philosophy as “transcendental knowledge” no longer claims speculative insight into eternal or necessary objects, but rather takes a completely different form: “I call all knowledge transcendental that does not concern itself so much with objects, but rather with our way of knowing objects in general, in as far as the latter is possible a priori. A system of such concepts would be called transcendental philosophy” (B 25).\n\nThe pure forms of intuition: space and time The term “concepts” as employed in the previous quote turns out to be fairly broad, because the first section of the “Transcendental Doctrine of Elements,” namely the “Transcendental Aesthetic,” identifies two such a priori elements of experience that are not derived from the intellect, but as “forms of intuition” are necessary preconditions for the perception of sense objects. Space and time, Kant says, are not things we directly perceive, but are necessary elements of our perceiving, “intuiting” (Anschauung) the objects of sense perception. The general ability to have impressions of objects given to us, Kant calls “receptivity”; “sensibility” is the act of being affected (affiziert) by the objects (A 19/B 33); and he follows the modern philosophical tradition in calling the effects of this process “impressions” (A 19–20/B 34). The latter correspond to the “matter” (Materie) or “manifold” (Mannigfaltige) of sense objects as given in perception. In our intuition of sense objects, Kant notes, we find, in addition to the matter, in each case predicates that are of a different kind, namely spatial predicates related to their location such as “above/below,” “next to,” “in front of/behind,” “right/ left,” and so on, and temporal predicates such as “before,” “at the same time,” or “after.” These “formal” predicates are of a different kind than the material ones. They are not tied to one of the specific senses as are color, smell, and sound; nor can we imagine a natural object that does not have spatial or temporal location, in contrast to material predicates that may or may not apply to specific objects (for instance, a sound without a color, much less a specific color, taste, or sound). One helpful way to think of the difference is the way that the material predicates apply to properties that are clearly adjectival in nature, for example, “blue” or “loud,” whereas the temporal and spatial predicates are in a certain sense adverbial – they tell us the “when” or the “where” of the experienced object. Hence, Kant argues, these forms or “modes” of the way objects are intuited are “a priori” because they are universal and necessary predicates – as opposed to the particular and contingent properties given to us as the appearance’s “matter.” Moreover, he argues, they cannot come to us “from the object” – his term is that they are not “of objective origin” – because then they would share those features of particularity and contingency that are shared by all of the predicates that come to us through sensibility as our only access to natural objects. Here he is building 22 Volume 1\n\nimmanuel kant’s turn to transcendental philosophy\n\non Hume’s insight into the lack of strict predictability based on past experience. With regard to empirical properties, Kant agrees with Hume, but he thinks that the spatiality and temporality of sense experience are different. They cannot “come from” the object precisely because they do not share that feature of experiences derived from the senses; and since everything is either a subject or an object and they do not come from the objects, they must then be “of subjective origin.” Nonetheless, Kant claims they hold for and apply to all possible objects of experience (i.e. possess “objective validity” or “objective reality”) since any experiences of natural objects will necessary be in terms of these a priori dimensions of sense experience (A 326–9/B 42–4). Their a priori and formal character is what makes it possible to describe them in a priori sciences that investigate these formal systems as such, namely in geometry, which examines the formal characteristics of space as such, and in arithmetic, which is based on a system of ordered succession, and all of the other formal systems of mathematics that are derived from these two.\n\nThe pure forms of thinking: the categories As mentioned above, intuition alone is not sufficient for experience. In order to experience objects, Kant says that the material provided by intuition must be organized according to concepts before we can recognize any object as this or that thing of this or that kind. Not only the “receptivity of impressions” but also the “spontaneity of concepts” (A 50/B 74) is required for knowledge. Concepts, he says, are “functions” or “activities” that bring together the material that is presented in spatial and temporal arrangements and organizes it into knowledge. In our daily lives, these are specific concepts such as “boat,” “house,” “dog,” or “lantern,” to use just a few of the examples that Kant employs. However, what is common to all of them is that they are “forms” of unity, general ways of distinguishing differences and drawing things together in terms of similarities. Kant builds here on what he sees as Aristotle’s insight that there are a finite number of logically relevant “forms of judgment,” formal distinctions in the ways that concepts are combined into judgments, and he argues that these different ways of unifying concepts parallel the ways that these functions organize the material provided by intuition into concepts. According to Kant’s own slight revision of a table of judgments as developed with the logics of the Leibniz–Wolffian school, the table of judgments can be organized into four headings, each with three specific forms within them: quantity – universal, particular, or individual; quality – positive, negative, or infinite (a mixed mode of positing a non-negative such as “that is not-white”); relation – categorical, hypothetical, or disjunctive; and modality – problematic, assertive, or apodictic. Accordingly, the pure forms of thinking when applied to the manifold given in perception, what he calls the 23 Volume 1\n\nthomas nenon\n\n“categories,” are also twelve in number, with three under each of four different headings that correspond to the forms of judgment, namely quantity (unity, plurality, or universality); quality (reality, negation, limitation); relation (inherence and substance, cause and effect, mutual interaction); and modality (possibility, actuality, necessity). The argument that these are the twelve categories, Kant calls the “metaphysical deduction” of the categories. In addition to that argument, Kant thinks that he also needs to show that and how they are related to objects, how they have “objective validity.” The strategy he employs parallels the “transcendental deduction” of the pure forms of intuition. Once again, he tries to show that, even though they do not originate from experience, they are nonetheless “necessary conditions for the possibilities of experience” and hence for any object of experience for us. He tries to show that without such forms of unity, the objects of sense intuition would not be “objects for us” (A 90/B 123). More specifically, in the two versions of the section entitled “Transcendental Deduction of the Categories” – one from the first edition of the Critique in 1781 (usually referred to as the “A” edition) and another, almost completely revised version in the second edition of 1787 (the “B” edition) – he argues that experience, the objects of experience, and even the consciousness of the subjects who experience objects are unities, not just aggregates of data that come and go over time. Each of them has a fundamental unity across time in spite of the specific changes in the state of experience, in objects, and in the subjects of experience over time. Kant asserts that intuition provides us with a series of impressions that are arranged into temporal and spatial constellations, but that without some other forms of unity to actively group them together and organize them, neither the world nor the objects within it would ever exhibit the unity that is an essential feature of nature as a whole and the objects it comprises. Knowledge involves recognition of patterns and the a priori assumption that there are patterns within experience. The fact that we must assume that we can and do organize our intuitions according to these patterns for knowledge to be possible is the core insight that Kant advances in these sections. At the same time, this “justification” exhibits the limits of the categories. As forms of unity, they depend on and are essentially related to the material presented by intuition, which is why they represent essential conditions for the recognition of objects of experience and hence for the objects presented in experience as appearances “for us,” but we have no basis for extending their validity any further than that. Kant’s famous summary of his argument in terms of the relationship to possible experience as the supreme principle of every synthetic judgment states: “the conditions for the possibility of experience in general are at the same time conditions for the possibility of the objects of experience and thus possess objective validity” (A 158/B 197). This explains why he also concludes that the categories 24 Volume 1\n\nimmanuel kant’s turn to transcendental philosophy\n\nhave validity for objects of possible experience, but not for things in general – that is, not for objects that may or may not exist “in themselves” but that, by their very nature, would be outside the parameters of any possible experience. These general arguments about the nature and necessity of the categories leave open the question how specifically they apply to objects. Based simply on the arguments articulated in the two versions of the “Transcendental Deduction of the Categories,” it is not clear what guidance – if any – intuition provides to the understanding. The deductions make clear that intuition is required for knowledge, but it might seem that the intuitions simply provide a kind of raw material that can be formed in whatever way the subject may choose in thinking. The section that follows the deductions, called the “Analytic of the Principles” attempts to show how concepts apply to objects as appearances according to a priori principles that ultimately can be traced to the universal form of all intuitions, namely time.
