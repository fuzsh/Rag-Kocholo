        "text": "1. Slides prepared by Cyndi Chie and Sarah Frye. Fourth edition revisions by Sharon Gray. An Introduction to Ethics\n\n2. Corresponding page number: What We Will Cover What we covered last week The Pace of Change Change and Unexpected Developments Themes What we will cover this week Ethics\n\n3. Corresponding page number: New technology – and ethics • Questions and how to make ethical decisions • Should you download movies/music from unauthorized websites? • Should you talk on your mobile phone when driving on a motorway? • Should you hire foreign programmers who work at low salaries? • Should you fire an employee who criticizes your business in social media? • Should you attempt to prosecute an employee who whistle-blows by downloading and releasing data to the press?\n\n4. Corresponding page number: Socrates – Born 469 BC – Athens - Greece • Socrates developed a method of questioning designed to expose weaknesses in the interrogated. He believed circumspect use of language and endless self-questioning are crucial in the quest for wisdom. He was the teacher of Plato.\n\n5. Corresponding page number: Plato – Born circa 428/9 BC – Athens? -Greece Plato, saw philosophy as a way of life, the highest calling of a select few. For him the highest good is knowledge. He wrote nothing but dramatically influenced the course of intellectual history. The, teacher of Aristotle, he set forth his philosophy in dialogues, the chief protagonist of which was Socrates, his mentor; Most famous for his Theory of Forms ( the phenomenal world of matter being an imperfect reflection of an immutable, transcendental world of ideas). Plato believed that knowledge is a process of remembering; the objects of knowledge are ideal and immutable.\n\n6. Corresponding page number: Aristotle – Born circa 384 BC – Stagirus - Greece • Aristotle theorized on a vast range of subjects: biology, ethics, logic, metaphysics, politics. He's considered history's first logician and biologist. His thinking influenced numerous theologians and philosophers. He was a naturalist who revised Plato's theory of form and matter; for Aristotle, the form is what makes matter what it is (as the soul defines a living body). He put forth two general principles of proof: the excluded middle (everything must either have or not have a given characteristic), and the law of contradiction (nothing can both have and not have a given characteristic).\n\n7. Corresponding page number: Ethics • What is Ethics? • Study of what it means to “do the right thing”. • Assumes people are rational and make free choices. • Rules to follow in our interactions and our actions that affect others.\n\n8. Corresponding page number: Ethics • What is Ethics: • Most ethical theories attempt to enhance human dignity, peace, happiness and well being • Ethical rules apply to all of us • Ethical rules are intended to achieve good results for people in general and for situations in general – not just for ourselves, not just for one situation\n\n9. Corresponding page number: Ethics • What is Ethics - differing viewpoints: • We could view ethical rules as fundamental and universal, like the laws of science • OR • We could view ethical rules as rules we make up like the rules of football or netball\n\n10. Corresponding page number: Ethics • Some ethicists (philosophers who study ethics) make distinctions between: • Ethical theories that view certain acts as good or bad because of some intrinsic aspect of the action – deontological (or non consequentialist) theories • AND • Ethical theories that view acts as good or bad because of their consequences – consequentialist theories\n\n11. Corresponding page number: Immanuel Kant(born 1772 –Germany; John Stuart Mill(born 1806 – London, England); John Locke (born 1632 – Somerset, England )\n\n12. Corresponding page number: Ethics – A Variety of Ethical Views Deontological or non consequentialist theories Immanuel Kant proposed an emphasis on absolute rules – not whether or not they lead to good or bad consequences 1 Utilitarianism - consequentialist - John Stuart Mill – emphasis on increasing happiness (“utility”) – we should consider the consequences rather than just the actions. 2 Natural rights – rights come from nature – John Lock – includes the right to life, liberty and property 3\n\n13. Corresponding page number: Ethics - A variety of ethical views: • Social contracts and a theory of political justice • People willingly submit to a common law in order to live in a civil society. • The foundations of this are in the writings of Socrates and Plato • In the 1660’s a philosopher called Thomas Hobbes stated that: • “Man is rational and will seek a better situation even at the cost of giving up some independence in favour of common law and accepting some authority to enforce this ‘social contract’”\n\n14. Corresponding page number: Ethics – Deontological Theories • Non consequentialist • Immanuel Kant proposed three important ideas • The principle of universality – We should follow rules of behavior that we universally apply to everyone. • Logic or reason should determine ethical behavior - not emotion • One must never treat people as merely means to an end but rather as ends in themselves • Kant took an extreme position on the absolutism of ethical rules, for example he argued it is always wrong to lie. Do you agree?\n\n15. Corresponding page number: Ethics - Utilitarianism • Utilitarianism is the main example of consequentialist theory • John Stewart Mill provides guiding principles: • Main purpose is to increase happiness or utility • A person’s utility is what satisfies a person’s needs and values • An action may decrease utility for some people and increase it for others. • Mill suggested that we can accept a decrease in utility for some provided the majority benefit. ‘The greatest good for the greatest number’.\n\n16. Corresponding page number: Ethics - Utilitarianism - the Act version We should consider the consequences of individual acts (Act utilitarianism) The benefits / damages to all affected people We should calculate the change in aggregate utility (happiness) An act is right if it tends to increase aggregate utility An act is wrong if it tends to decrease aggregate utility\n\n17. Corresponding page number: Ethics - Utilitarianism – the Act version • Problems with Act utilitarianism • Can we determine all consequences of an act? • Who determines what increases the happiness (utility) of people affected by an action – the decision maker[s] or the people affected? • How do we know what they would choose? • Should some peoples utility carry more weight than others? • Should a thief's gain of utility be equal to the victims loss of utility?\n\n18. Corresponding page number: Ethics - Utilitarianism – the Act version • Problems with Act utilitarianism • A fundamental (and ethical ) objection to act utilitarianism is that it does not recognize or respect individual rights. It has no absolute prohibitions. • Would you kill one innocent person to distribute their organs to several people who will die without an organ transplant? • Should you take the property of a rich person and distribute amongst poorer people? Does this differ if it is the state that redistributes wealth compared to individuals or ‘Robin Hood’ style groups?\n\n19. Corresponding page number: Utilitarianism – the Rule version • Rule utilitarianism is a variant form of utilitarianism which applies the utility principle not to individual actions but to general ethical rules. • Thus a rule utilitarian might argue that the general rule “Do not lie” will increase total utility; similarly a rule utilitarian might argue that the general rule “Do not kill” will increase total utility. • Recognizing that wide spread lying, killing and stealing decrease the security and happiness (utility) of all, a rule utilitarian can devise rules (or laws) against these acts . • In general a rule utilitarian will be more comfortable than a deontologist in breaking a rule in circumstances where doing so would have good consequences\n\n20. Corresponding page number: Are there ‘Natural Rights’ that we think should apply to all citizens? • Suppose we wish to treat people as ends rather than means to an end and we want to increase people’s ‘happiness’ as a way of having a better society. Unfortunately this is a rather vague goal. • One approach to improving overall happiness might be to let people make their own decisions and choose their actions wherever possible. • We could try to define a “sphere of freedom” in which people can act according to their own judgment without the coercive influence of others.\n\n21. Corresponding page number: Ethics – Natural Rights • This approach respects a set of fundamental rights of others, called “natural rights” because in the opinion of some philosophers we can derive them from the nature of humanity. • Examples include the US Constitution that includes the rights to life, liberty and property. People often talk about a ‘right to free speech’ or the ‘right to life’ and even the ‘right to die’. • John Lock, argued that we each have an exclusive right to ourselves, our labour, and to what we produce with our labour. • He saw protection of private property as a moral rule. Without it, for example, he claimed no one would clear land or plant food.\n\n22. Corresponding page number: Ethics – Natural Rights • Respect for the rights to life, to liberty and the protection of property lead to ethical rules against killing, stealing, deception and coercion • Those that emphasize natural rights tend to emphasize the ethical character of the process by which people interact. • They see acts generally as likely to be ethical if they involve voluntary interactions and freely made exchanges where the people involved are not coerced or deceived. • This contrasts with other ethical standards that tend to focus on the result or state achieved by the interaction, for example, seeing an action as likely to be unethical if it leaves some people poor\n\n23. Corresponding page number: Different sorts of ‘Rights’ • When people talk about rights they are often • speaking about two different kinds of rights. • In philosophy these are usually called • Negative rights (liberties) • The right to act without interference; these imply merely a negative duty on others not to prevent the action. • Positive rights (claim-rights) • These impose a positive obligation on people to act or provide certain things for others; e.g. students have a ‘right to appeal’ if the assessment process is not fairly conducted. Similarly, the Disability Discrimination Act legislates positive rights for disabled citizens. Some positive rights arise through contracts.\n\n24. Corresponding page number: Ethics - Negative Rights • Negative rights (liberties) • The right to act without interference. The only obligation they impose on others is not to prevent you from acting. • Negative rights include: • the right to life (in the sense that no one may kill you) • the right to be free from assault • the right to use your property • the right to use your labour, skills and mind to create goods and services and to trade with people in voluntary exchanges • freedom of speech and religion • the right to privacy • Is the ‘right to knowledge and information’ (e.g. through access to the internet) a ‘negative right’/entitlement?\n\n25. Corresponding page number: Ethics – Positive Rights • Positive rights (claim-rights) • Impose an obligation on some people to provide certain things for others • a positive right to a job could mean that someone must hire you • a positive right to life may mean that others have to pay for your food or medical care • a positive right to freedom of speech may mean that we require to BBC to broadcast, my, your, everyone’s views • a positive right to freedom of information for all may mean no confidentially allowed • a positive right to access the internet could result in others having to pay for your internet access ( was this a positive right in the 19th Century?) • Essentially these are entitlements that impose a duty on someone else to facilitate them for you.\n\n26. Corresponding page number: Ethics – Conflict Between Negative and Positive Rights • We might believe that privacy is a negative right (or liberty) while also believing that freedom of information is a positive (claim) right? • A possible conflict?\n\n27. Corresponding page number: Ethics • A variety of ethical views (cont.): • No simple answers • Human behavior and real human situations are complex. There are often trade-offs to consider. • Ethical theories help to identify important principles or guidelines. • Ethical theories do not provide clear, incontrovertibly correct positions on most issues. We can use the approaches we described to support opposite sides of many an issue. •\n\n28. Corresponding page number: Ethics • A variety of ethical views (cont.): • Do organizations have ethics? • Ultimately, it is individuals who are making decisions and taking actions. However, we can hold both the individuals and the organization responsible for their acts. • For example are there ethical principles that a University should follow?\n\n29. Corresponding page number: Ethics • Some important distinctions: • Dilemmas in how to act / behave / decide • Right (ethically obligatory?) • or Wrong (ethically prohibited?) • or Okay (ethically acceptable?) • Distinguishing wrong and harm • What if you, or your company, were to develop a new product that puts a competitor out of business – people will lose their jobs (harm) . Is this wrong?\n\n30. Corresponding page number: Ethics • In analysing a situation we should consider separating ‘goals’ from ‘constraints’; for example: • Our ‘goal’ – financial success • Working hard and making sensible investments may achieve this • So might stealing - ethically prohibited and hence a ‘constraint’ • You, or the company you work for, should strive to achieve goals by ensuring that both your and the companies actions are consistent with ethical constraints.\n\n31. Corresponding page number: Personal preference and Ethics • We might find something distasteful but is it ethically wrong? • Some people may not consider a job opportunity in, for example, the arms industry because they do not like the products the company produces, e.g. nuclear bombs • Are they doing this on ethical grounds or is it a personal preference? • Two people with opposing political or social views may both claim they are morally and/or ethically correct – i.e. claim the “moral high ground”\n\n32. Corresponding page number: Law and Ethics • What is the connection between law and ethics? • Sometimes very little • History allowed the slave trade? • New law lags behind new technology for good reason. • It takes time to recognize new problems associated with the new technology, consider possible solutions, think and debate about the consequences of various proposals and so on"
