The ter- rible state of the weather is a useful and customary substitute (Behelf ) for someone who joins the changing conversation of a gathered com- pany on the street. For to start talking of the latest news from Tur- key, which has just come out in the papers, when one walks into the room, over-exerts (tut Gewalt an) the powers of the imagination of those who do not see how the person has come to the topic. The mind requires in all communication of thought a certain order (eine gewisse Ordnung), so that it agrees, as in a sermon, with the initiated imagination and the beginning, as well as the delivery. —From Kant’s Anthropology (1798), own translation. 1 Like many of Kant’s references to Islam or an Islamic Orient, this men- tion of Turkey takes place within a footnote. The passage concerned is a reference to a moment in Kant’s Anthropology where, having deﬁned the “law of association” as a series of empirical pictures which follow one another, Kant speaks of the common experience of losing one’s thread in the middle of a point. When we are lost, says Kant, we have the feeling of having skipped two or three links in the chain of our thought. Here Kant’s footnote is both illustrative and preventative: don’t plunge your provincial listener immediately into the exotic—speak to them of what is near and immediate. A question, in other words, not so much of how to orientate oneself in thinking, but rather of how not to disorientate one’s partner. If the passage makes an unremarkable point, its ordinariness is redeemed by the revealing place of Turkey in the remark. Not merely because it illus- trates what Kant will come to represent for Islam in this chapter—a cen- tral ﬁgure in the Enlightenment footnoting of Islam, a pivotal stage in the rationalist reduction of the Muslim Orient to a curious appendix, an eccen- tric cross-reference, a pair of problematic parentheses. Not even because of the violence or Gewalt which the spontaneous mention of Turkey inﬂicts upon the rain-soddened, unprepared imagination of the local Königs- berger. Kant’s throwaway example also reveals, in addition to the insigniﬁ- cance of Islam, an accompanying, unacknowledged anxiety. The Orient, it would appear, disorients; when it appears out of its natural place, when it moves unexpectedly from the “remote” ( das Entferntere) to invade the near and present (gegenwärtig), the result can only be perplexity. Beneath this upsetting of what Kant calls “a certain order” in the communication Almond 3rd pages.indd 29 Almond 3rd pages.indd 29 8/13/2009 11:34:05 AM 8/13/2009 11:34:05 AM\n\n30 The History of Islam in German Thought T&F Proofs: Not For Distribution of thoughts, lies a genuine fear of displacement, an unease concerning the kinds of directions words like “Turkey” can take us. The questions Kant says we ask ourselves when we lose our train of thought—“Where was I? From where did I start in my speech, and how did I get to where I am?” 2 — acquire an uncanny metaphysical signiﬁcance when considered in the wider context of the non-European and its shifting place in the Kantian project of limit-demarcation. Any consideration of the Islamic Orient in Kant—the sparse but cru- cial remarks he made about it, and the even more crucial indifference he showed towards it—cannot forego a study of his obsession with the limit, the boundary, the Grenze. This commonplace of Kant studies—for what could be more obvious than the primacy of the Grenze in Kant, those careful delineations between faith and reason, between the empirical and the tran- scendental, between life and matter, 3 even between the good (moral) and bad (grotesque) sublime?—encounters a strange twist in the light of Kant’s relationship with Islam. “Mohammedanism”, as we shall see, presents the same variety of threats for Kant as it did for Luther—the lurking possibility of radical delimitation, one which would overturn all kinds of boundaries, sexual, political, territorial, as well as the merely philosophical. As early as 1766, in Dreams of a Spirit-Seer , Kant had already deﬁned human understanding as “a small land with many boundaries”—with meta- physics thereby understood to be “a science of the boundaries of human reason”. In contrast to mystics such as Swedenborg, who had wanted to “blindly” embark upon more expansive conquests, Kant declares he is content merely to indicate the boundaries and, implicitly, the arrogance of those who have tried to move past them. 4 The topographical tone of this motif continues in the preface to the ﬁrst edition of the Critique of Pure Reason, even if now the “land” of human understanding has become the “empire” of metaphysics: Time was, when she [metaphysics] was the queen of all the sciences . . . At ﬁrst, her government, under the administration of the dogmatists, was an absolute despotism. But as the legislative continued to show traces of the ancient barbaric rule, her empire gradually broke up, and intestine wars introduced the reign of anarchy; while the skeptics, like nomadic tribes, who hate a permanent habitation and a settled mode of living, attacked from time to time those who had organized themselves into civil communities. But their number was, very happily, small; and thus they could not entirely put a stop to the exertions of those who persisted in raising new ediﬁces, although on no settled or uniform plan. 5 Whatever the empire may have been, it is now in decay.
