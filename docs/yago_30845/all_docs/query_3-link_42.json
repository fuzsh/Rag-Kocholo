        "text": "Coming up, you can catch two Y&R alums for the price of one in the sixth episode of the first season of the new CBS drama, Tracker.\n\nJustin Hartley (ex-Adam Newman, Y&R) stars as Colter Shaw and in the premise of Tracker, Colter grew up in a survivalist family, helps private citizens and law enforcement find missing loved ones. There is also a mystery involving the death of his father at the hands of some government agency, or possibly his older brother, when Colter was 15 that plays into the backstory.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Hartley reveals that his real-life wife, Sofia Pernas, who played the role of Marissa Sierras on The Young and the Restless, will be appearing on the show.\n\nHartley previewed Sofia’s appearance, “Sofia is coming in episode six. She is a blast from the past. Colter had a relationship with her, and they were kind of in the reward business together. And then she sold him down the river. It wasn’t great. And so, they had a schism that happened in their relationship, and she comes back into his life for a certain reason and they’re forced to work together in a way to get to a common goal.”\n\nWhile Justin and Sofia are happily married in real-life, from Hartley’s tease, it doesn’t look like their Tracker alter-egos will end up the same way! Justin shared, “By the time you get to episode six, you will see this is outside of Colter’s comfort zone. There is obviously an attraction there, but something that happened that is very sad.”\n\nThe episode featuring Sofia entitled “Lexington” will air sometime in March. We will keep you updated as to the specific date when it becomes available. Make sure to watch Tracker Sunday night on CBS and streaming on Paramount+ beginning at 9pm ET.\n\nLooking forward to seeing Justin and Sofia together on-screen on ‘Tracker’? Comment below.\n\nAs Lucky Spencer’s returns begins to unravel, bringing back to five-time Daytime Emmy-winner, Jonathan Jackson, there is another actor who will definitely be a part of his story.\n\nIn casting news, Sawandi Wilson is joining the cast in the role of Isaiah, who is tied to Lucky’s story and will first air next week beginning on the August 26th episode of the ABC daytime drama series.\n\nif Wilson looks familiar it’s from his role in Star Trek: Discovery as Captain Leto in its fifth and final season which ended this past May. In addition to that series, Sawandi’s credits include: a recurring role in Netflix’s The House of Flowers, Harlem, Law & Order: SVU, Quantico, The Get Down, Bull and more.\n\nJackson’s return began on today’s August 23rd episode and her previously teased to TV Insider, “He’s (Lucky) been away for almost a decade, so I would say that the reasons for him being away and what he’s been up to are revealed. He hasn’t just been sitting in an apartment writing his novel. He’s been up to stuff.”\n\nHow does Isaiah fit into the equation? Will he be working with Lucky? Against Lucky? Who might Isaiah be connected to in Port Charles? Share your theories via the comment section below.\n\nOn General Hospital, viewers will now see Lindsay Hartley stepping back into the role of Sam McCall temporary filling-in once again for Kelly Monaco.\n\nHartley began airing on today’s Thursday, August 22nd episode and reportedly via Soap Opera Digest, is only back for a “short-term stint.” Lindsay is no stranger to the soaps having also appeared as Theresa on Passions; Arianna on Days of Our Lives; and as Cara on All My Children.\n\nBack in 2020, when Kelly Monaco had to step away from GH for a bit, Hartley first took on the part. Later, she returned to play Sam in 2021, and once again in January of 2024. Taking to her Instagram Story, Hartley wrote, “Grateful to be stepping in again.” She was pictured in a photo from the funeral of Molly (Kristen Vaganos) and TJ’s (Tajh Bellow) baby alongside her on-screen mother, Nancy Lee Grahn (Alexis) and also Kristina played by Kate Mansi.\n\nThe timing of Kelly’s temporary exit comes at a pivotal time for the character as her man, Dante (Dominic Zamprogna) awaits to see just what the prognosis is of his ex-wife, Lulu, who has been in a coma in a longterm care facility, plus all the drama between the Davis sisters.\n\nLast fall, Monaco celebrated her 20th anniversary with General Hospital and her fans have been clamoring for her to have more story as Sam has been a bit back-burnered of late. Is that all about to change? Stay tuned.\n\nSo, glad that if anyone was replacing Kelly, it was soap vet, Lindsay Hartley? Share your thoughts via the comment section below.\n\nJust a few weeks before its season five premiere on Monday, September 9th, CBS Media Ventures had already renewed daytime’s The Drew Barrymore Show for its sixth season, which means the talker will continue on at least through the 2025-2026 season.\n\nWhile The Drew Barrymore Show will continue airing on CBS stations in its current time slot, it also has been given a higher profiles spots in the schedule in seven of the top 20 markets.\n\nIn a statement, Wendy McMahon, President and CEO of CBS News and Stations and CBS Media Ventures announced on Thursday, “Drew is a one-of-a-kind talent who is an integral part of the CBS and Paramount family. This early renewal and upgrades are a testament to our commitment to The Drew Barrymore Show and its loyal audience, who tune in every day to see Drew’s warmth, inquisitiveness and spontaneity.”\n\nMcMahon added, “Over the last few seasons, stations have realized that The Drew Barrymore Show’is like no other series in daytime, bringing Drew’s brand of positivity and ad-friendly content to viewers on a consistent basis. Many of these upgrades now pair ‘Drew’ with a CBS Mornings lead-in, which has proven to be a powerful combination. This season, in markets where ‘Drew’ airs at 9:00 a.m., its ratings are +21% higher among total viewers when CBS Mornings is the lead-in.”\n\nThe announced station upgrades will be given to CBS stations in six markets, which include five of the top 10 markets, along with a station and time slot upgrade in Houston.\n\nComing up, The Drew Barrymore Show will get the 9:00 a.m. timeslot block following “CBS Mornings” in three major markets, New York (WCBS), Dallas (KTVT) and Boston (WBZ). In three other markets, the talk show will air as an hour block at 3:00 p.m., including in Philadelphia (KYW), San Francisco (KPIX) and Miami (WFOR). In Houston, ‘Drew’ is moving to NBC affiliate KPRC and will air at 10am.\n\nMeanwhile in an interview released with Entertainment Tonight on Thursday, Barrymore addressed audience criticism for her touchy-feely nature with her guests. She told ET, “I’ll try to practice physical distance, which is not my strong point.” She added, “Do you know how hard the pandemic was for me? I was alone in a studio by myself!
