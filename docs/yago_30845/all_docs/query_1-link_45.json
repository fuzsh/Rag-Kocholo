He changed his name to Edward Lee, as he did not like Elwood. His siblings included, Alma Lee, George Benjamin, Leila Mae, Samuel Richard, Margie Louise, James Russell, Marvin Ashley and Rudolf (still born). He married Ninnie Ophelia Conrad in 1915. Ninnie was a sister of Rufus Franklin Conrad who married his sister Leila Mae. Edward Lee was 17 and Ninnie was 16. Ninnie was born in Flora, MS in 1899. Their children were Talmarie, Edward Lee Ur, Frederick Earl, Genevive Mae, Grances Margaret, Jack Raymond, Bille Gene, Rudolph, Don Alvin, James Ivor \"Ted\", Kenneth Larmar \"Odie\" and Bobby Glenn.. Edward Lee died in 1948 at the age of 49. Ninne died in 1968.\n\nEdward Lee and Ninnie's son, E. L. Hartley was a prisoner of war during WWII. Click here to read an account of his service. E.L. Hartley Military.\n\nEdward Lee and Ninnie Ophelia Conrad Hartley Family Gallery\n\nTHE BEST CHRISTMAS\n\nFamily lived, celebrated in barn after local tornado\n\nby Josh Edwards\n\nDec 24, 2012\n\nDecember 24, 2012. The Vicksburg Post\n\nPat Williams Hartleyâs most memorable Christmas was spent living in a barn, but her family sang, ate and counted their blessings.\n\nOn Dec. 5, 1953, her familyâs home on Standard Hill Road was destroyed by a violent tornado that ripped though Vicksburg and Warren County leaving nearly 40 dead in its path.\n\nThe Williams family had been planning to attend a childrenâs birthday party at the Saenger Theater on Walnut Street, said Hartley who is now 70.\n\nâMy dad decided not to let us go because he didnât like the muggy weather,â she said.\n\nD.T. Williamsâ hunch about the weather was right. The Saenger took a direct hit from the storm and at least three people died inside after the roof collapsed.\n\nâOne of our young friends didnât make it,â Hartley said.\n\nThe storm moved rapidly and ripped her familyâs home to pieces. Hartleyâs mother, Florence Williams, was injured and taken to Mercy Hospital, then on Crawford Street. The trip to downtown took several hours because of storm damage, Hartley said.\n\nThe family returned home the next day to find only two walls of their home standing.\n\nâWe were truly devastated. All of our possessions were destroyed, our pets were dead and our clothes were dangling from the tree tops. But at the same time, we felt blessed to be alive,â Hartley said.\n\nHelp poured in from the community, and the family and volunteers worked tirelessly to renovate a barn to become the familyâs temporary home. It was amazing to see the outpouring of help from total strangers, Hartley said.\n\nâThe corncrib became the kitchen. The area housing the equipment and tools became our parentsâ bedroom. The area where the hay had been became the living room and the last section became the childrenâs bedroom. Daddy built small beds on each of the four walls,â Hartley said.\n\nThe family lived in the barn for about six months as their house was rebuilt.\n\nAs Christmas approached, D.T. Williams took his children into the woods behind the barn to find a Christmas tree, Hartley said. They found a cedar that had not been damaged and looked perfect, she said.\n\nThe children decorated it with garlands of popcorn and construction paper, and D.T. Williams covered the tree in spun glass known as angel hair.\n\nâIt might not have been the most beautiful tree to anybody else, but it was to us,â Hartley said.\n\nThe night before Christmas, the family ate popcorn and sang Christmas carols around the tree, Hartley said.\n\nâReflections of all the love and kindness shown to us made each of us realize the true spirit of Christmas,â she said.\n\nEach year at Christmas time, Hartley and her husband, Odie, put up a large artificial cedar in the living room of their home on Singing Hills Road and Hartley reminisces about the Christmas she and her family spent living in a barn.\n\nHartleyâs parents and youngest brother, Jimmy, have died, but she and her other siblings, David Williams of Ethel, La., and Betty Mangum of Nesbitt, Miss., try to get together as often as possible.\n\nâWhen we do get together, we sing and we have a good time and go over our good memories,â she said.\n\n(Pat is married to Kenneth âOdieâ Hartley.}"
