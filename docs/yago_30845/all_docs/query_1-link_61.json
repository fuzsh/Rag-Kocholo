She was the only child of Post Cereals heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post and her second husband, Wall Street stockbroker Edward Francis Hutton, founder of E. F. Hutton & Co. Merrill had two older half-sisters, Adelaide Breevort (Close) Hutton (July 26, 1908 – December 31, 1998) and Eleanor Post (Close) Hutton (December 3, 1909 – November 27, 2006), by her mother's first marriage to Edward Bennett Close, grandfather of actress Glenn Close.\n\nMerrill graduated from Miss Porter's School, then attended George Washington University in Washington, DC for one term, but dropped out and enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City. She studied acting at HB Studio under Uta Hagen.\n\nActing career[]\n\nOn advice from her half-sister's (then) husband, she adopted the stage name Dina Merrill, borrowing from Charles E. Merrill, a famous stockbroker like her father. Merrill made her debut on the stage in the play The Mermaid Singing in 1945.\n\nDuring the late 1950s and 1960s, Merrill was believed to have intentionally been marketed as a replacement for Grace Kelly,and in 1959, she was proclaimed \"Hollywood's new Grace Kelly\".\n\nMerrill's film credits included Desk Set (1957), A Nice Little Bank That Should Be Robbed (1958), Don't Give Up the Ship (1959), Operation Petticoat (1959, with Cary Grant, who had been married to her cousin, Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton), The Sundowners (1960), Butterfield 8 (1960), The Young Savages (1961), The Courtship of Eddie's Father (1963), I'll Take Sweden (1965), The Greatest (1977), A Wedding (1978), Just Tell Me What You Want (1980), Anna to the Infinite Power (1983), Twisted (1986), Caddyshack II (1988), Fear (1990), True Colors (1991), The Player (1992), Suture (1993), and Shade (2003). She also appeared in made-for-TV movies, such as Seven in Darkness (1969), The Lonely Profession (1969), Family Flight (1972), and The Tenth Month (1979).\n\nMerrill appeared in numerous television series in the 1960s, such as playing the villain \"Calamity Jan\" in two 1968 episodes of Batman alongside then-husband Cliff Robertson. She also made guest appearances on two Bonanza episodes as Susannah Clauson, The Alfred Hitchcock Hour episode \"Bonfire\" (1962), The Investigators, The Bold Ones, Wagon Train, (1964), The Love Boat; Quincy, M.E.; Murder, She Wrote; Roseanne, and The Nanny, as Maxwell Sheffield's disapproving and distant British mother. In 1971, Merrill appeared as Laura Duff in The Men From Shiloh (rebranded name for the TV Western The Virginian) in the episode titled \"The Agnus Killer\".\n\nHer stage credits include the 1983 Broadway revival of the Rodgers and Hart musical On Your Toes, starring Russian prima ballerina Natalia Makarova. In 1991, she appeared in the rotating cast of the off-Broadway staged reading of Wit & Wisdom.\n\nIn 1991, Merrill and her third husband, Ted Hartley, merged their company, Pavilion Communications, with RKO to form RKO Pictures, which owns the intellectual property of the RKO Radio Pictures movie studio.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Merrill was a recurring guest on several network television game and panel shows including Match Game, To Tell the Truth, What's My Line, and Hollywood Squares.\n\nBoard memberships[]\n\nMerrill was a presidential appointee to the board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a trustee of the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center, and a vice president of the New York City Mission Society. In 1980, Merrill joined the board of directorsof her father's E. F. Hutton & Co., continuing on the board and the compensation committee of Lehman Brothers when it acquired Hutton, for over 18 years.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nMerrill was married three times. In 1946, she wed Stanley M. Rumbough Jr., an heir to the Colgate-Palmolive toothpaste fortune and entrepreneur. They had three children, Nedenia Colgate Rumbough, David Post Rumbough (1950 - 1973), and Stanley Rumbough III before divorcing in 1966. Later that year, she wed future Oscar-winning actor Cliff Robertson, with whom she had a daughter, Heather Robertson (1968–2007). The couple divorced in 1986.\n\nIn 1989, she married producer Ted Hartley.\n\nOn May 22, 2017, Merrill died at her home in East Hampton, New York at age 93. She had been suffering from dementia with Lewy bodies.\n\nTwo of Merrill's four children predeceased her.\n\nShows appeared[]"
