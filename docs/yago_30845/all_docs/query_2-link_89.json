        "text": "When you die, don't leave behind multiple wills in different countries.\n\nEleanor Close Barzin died in 2006 at age 96. She was a daughter of Marjorie Merriweather Post (1887--1973), who during her life (all of it before The Forbes 400 list) often was called America's richest woman. Post's fortune, which included art and the 126-room Mar-a-Lago mansion in Palm Beach, Fla. (currently run as a club by Donald Trump), was estimated at $250 million ($1.5 billion today). Her father, C.W. Post, had founded a cereal business that became General Foods (now part of Kraft Foods ), which she inherited and helped run following his suicide. One of her four husbands was financier E.F. Hutton, who became Eleanor's stepfather when she was still a child.\n\nIn a family full of other famous names--actress Dina Merrill is a half-sister and actress Glenn Close a half-niece--Eleanor herself became famous for her choice of husbands. (She had a half-dozen.) At age 20, in 1930, she eloped with the playwright and future Oscar-winning screenwriter Preston Sturges, 11 years her senior, scandalizing her family and titillating the press. That union was annulled after two years. But her last marriage, to conductor Leon Barzin, lasted 45 years until his 1999 death. While remaining a U.S. citizen, she lived mostly in Paris from the 1930s on. Barzin's later decades were spent largely out of the spotlight, and her death received scant media attention.\n\nShe left a $74 million estate consisting mainly of art, European real estate and $32 million, long managed by a cousin, in a Baltimore brokerage account. Plus more than one last testament. An amended French will split the European estate--after payment of $9 million in bequests to 29 charities, employees, friends and relatives--between her only child, Antal (Tony) Post de Be-kessy, now 66 and living in Austria, and his only child, Laetitia Allen Vere, of London. But a U.S. trust Barzin created holding that $32 million said that after similar bequests, De Bekessy would get only 25%; the other 75% would go to his daughter. A U.S. will gave everything left over to De Bekessy.\n\nThe trust and multiple wills apparently were intended to coexist without repealing one another and to simplify probate of the estate across different countries with different laws. Alas, the plan has had the opposite effect. There are now dueling probates on both sides of the Atlantic--with competing lawsuits or estate matters filed in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, New York, Paris and Switzerland. De Bekessy quickly got himself qualified to administer the French estate, while the U.S. end in Washington was handled by Barzin's U.S. trustees and executors. They also controlled the $32 million--nearly all of her liquid assets.\n\nBoth France and the U.S. have stiff death taxes, and a big issue seems to be whether they are to be paid out of just the European assets, just the U.S. assets or a combination of both. The outcome could leave various beneficiaries, including the charities and some individuals, getting less, little or nothing.\n\nTension appears to exist between father and daughter. In one complaint De Bekessy accused the U.S. trustees of \"conspiring\" with Vere, who is on the other side of some of her father's U.S. court actions. Overall, the many court filings are laced with accusatory phrases like \"cover up,\" \"breach of trust\" and \"unclean hands.\"\n\nThe most intriguing ploy came after the U.S. estate in 2007 paid $17.5 million to the Internal Revenue Service toward the final U.S. estate tax bill and in February 2008 got the U.S. will admitted to probate in Washington, D.C. A few days later De Bekessy quietly filed his own U.S. estate tax return. Tendering no money, he requested a $10 million \"refund.\" Apparently without doing much checking, the IRS mailed the full refund to a Paris address for De Bekessy three weeks later. (Remember that the next time the IRS delays your lousy $1,000 refund.)\n\n\"They pulled a fast one,\" fumes U.S. executor Michael F. Curtin, whose own request for a $5 million IRS refund on behalf of the U.S. estate was rebuffed. In separate actions both De Bekessy and the IRS are being sued for the $10 million. De Bekessy's pleadings say the action was proper and the money needed to help pay $29 million in French taxes. The IRS answered in court that it did nothing wrong by sending the refund to Europe, even if there was a pending probate listing an address near its own Washington, D.C. headquarters. The agency said that by U.S. law there can be only one valid estate proceeding--Paris, in this instance. Ominously, the feds said in a recent filing they are auditing the Barzin estate, \"which will likely result\" in a bill for more U.S. taxes.\n\nAssorted parties say they have been kept in the dark and can't get information. De Bekessy's main U.S. lawyer, Victor Muskin, said he was unaware of Curtin's lawsuit against the IRS in the obscure U.S. Court of Federal Claims until forbes told him, but he wasn't surprised. \"There are a lot of people claiming various interests,\" he deadpans.\n\nWith no obvious quick end in sight to the litigation, lawyers, taxes and administration expenses are certain to eat up much of the estate."
