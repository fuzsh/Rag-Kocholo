        "text": "Most people know Dina Merrill as a longtime Hollywood actress.\n\nMost locals know her as the girl who grew up in Mar-A-Lago, the daughter of cereal heiress Marjorie Meriwether Post and financier E.F. Hutton.\n\nNow you can get to know Dina Merrill, painter.\n\nRunning through March 13 at the Lighthouse ArtCenter Museum in Tequesta is “Watercolors by Dina Merrill,” an exhibition of her paintings. Most of her paintings focus on nature, such as birds and flowers. Trivia fact: She signs her work as Nedenia, her first name.\n\nIn a press release, Lighthouse art instructor Ted Matz says Merrill “combines her wit and her love of nature to make artwork that has a unique perspective and a charm of its own.”\n\nDina Merrill Hartley, now married to movie executive Ted Hartley, is scheduled to appear at the art center tonight for its monthly Thursday night show, set for 5:30-7:30 p.m. And she is the honorary chairman of the Beaux Arts Ball, the center’s annual fund-raising shindig on Feb. 9 at the Loxahatchee Club in Jupiter.\n\nAlso on display at the art center is Jake Fernandez’s show, “Altered Realities.”"
