She brings bright moments, insightful stories, and fairness into the conversation. I absolutely love working with her, and will absolutely recommend her to anyone who needs her.\n\nKevin F\n\nTrustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google.\n\nGabrielle Hartley has been invaluable to me and my family. She has helped us sort out situations that seemed insurmountable, and made everything much less complicated. We have been able to move forward in a way that makes sense, thanks in a large part to her wisdom and professional, yet warm and caring, manner. Thank you!\n\nElizabeth Satin\n\nTrustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google.\n\nConstructive and thoughtful. Extremely professional and made the process as easy as it could have been! Thank you Gabby!\n\nL Mollo\n\nTrustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google.\n\nWhen I spoke to Gabrielle, I felt like she really understood me.\n\nEmma Guyette\n\nTrustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google.\n\nGabrielle was incredibly helpful as I worked through the initial stages of helping a family member with their divorce proceedings. She was always timely in responding, and was very friendly and professional in correspondence. I would not hesitate to recommend that people reach out to her if needing to talk about your situation.\n\nCorrie Mayers\n\nTrustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google.\n\nVery Professional and Understanding. Fair to both parties. Mindful of both parties' time. Respectful of both parties privacy & requests. Patiently covers legal matters. Pleasant and calm personality who you would want to mediate such stressful matters for you.\n\nPriscilla Monson\n\nTrustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google.\n\nGabrielle's book \"Better Apart\" was a God send. Helping me sort through the feelings and confusion when it comes to a relationship not working and needing to think about ending a marriage. It is not easy, and besides all the emotions you have to think about the legal side of things. This book help with both, helping to start to see a way forward for those who, like me, want to do as little damage as possible and try to preserve some dignity and friendship with my long time partner. Great book and its been so helpful working through it. Also had a great 20 minute consultation with Gabrielle which was so encouraging and hlepful.\n\nCarol Conroy\n\nTrustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google.\n\nWe just finished our divorce agreement, and I couldn't be happier. Gabrielle helped us get through this process with her patience, knowledge, and compassion. Going through mediation instead of a traditional divorce is highly recommended. Gabrielle's reassurance and expertise will see you through it. Divorce doesn't have to be a battle!\n\nKENNY ARCH\n\nTrustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google.\n\nI had the pleasure of speaking with Gabrielle Hartley, Ms.Hartley was very informative and helpful. Ms. Hartley took the time and patience to answer my questions openly and honestly. Forever grateful."
