        "text": "We can all name an abstract painter: Jackson Pollock. We all can name an impressionist painter: Claude Monet. And we all can name a surrealistic painter: Salvador Dali. But can any of us name a “warrior painter”? Say hello to Ted Hartley of East Hampton.\n\n“Each painting commemorates a battle,” Hartley explained during opening night of his new exhibition at Keyes Art Gallery on Main Street in Sag Harbor on October 22. He was standing in front of his largest painting, titled “Kyiv, Pro Patria.” In a packed gallery, guests listened as Hartley spoke of the massive red impressionist-style painting, which is a part of his “Ukraine Series.”\n\n“You can see the striking reds; they’re fading off and knocking into the yellows and blues … Each painting tells a story,” he said.\n\nHartley’s exhibition, “Stories in Color,” can be enjoyed at Keyes Art Gallery from now until December 1. Hartley met Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine and wife of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, over breakfast in New York City during her most recent visit where she expressed her need for help in Ukraine. The chairman of JPMorgan Chase invited a few of the firm’s clients to the breakfast. Zelenska was scheduled to have an intimate discussion with that group and chatted with Hartley before she began her remarks.\n\n“Since then, the head of her foundation and I have been in touch and our relationship has grown,” explained Hartley who, after meeting her this fall changed the beneficiary for his “Ukraine Series” to the Zelenska Foundation. Prior to that, the charities were three related to Ukraine aid: International Red Cross, Come Back Alive and Spirit of America.\n\nZelenska presented her new charity aimed at rebuilding Ukraine at the Metropolitan Opera on September 22. Zelenska’s presentation preceded the 77th U.N. General Assembly with political and business leaders from around the globe. Through this, Zelenska hopes to rebuild schools, clinics, pharmacies and educational institutions in her embattled country, to name a few. The Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24 of this year provided a reason for Hartley to make a stand.\n\n“She asked if there was anything I could do. I said I could paint,” he said. “In the new Ukraine Series, I am taking up the paintbrush instead of a missile launcher to help the people of Ukraine. That feels good to me. I am in the fight. It is one step to support Ukraine with my brush and pallet knife as my weapons.”\n\nIn his younger days as a Navy carrier-based jet fighter pilot, Hartley served in wide-ranging assignments around the world, including two years as a White House aide in the Kennedy-Eisenhower era. At 28, he suffered injuries to his back from an aircraft accident and was forced into disability retirement as a lieutenant Commander.\n\nHartley said his friends have begun to call him the “warrior painter.” All proceeds from The Ukraine Series will benefit the Olena Zelenska Foundation, a newly formed charity created by Ukraine’s first lady.\n\n“I found her quiet strength and confidence contagious,” said Hartley. “That feels good to me. I am in the fight. My paintings tell their brave story in bright color. Pro patria. Viva Ukraine.”\n\nHis featured Ukraine Series begins with “Kyiv: Pro Patria,” a fiery glow of contrasting red hues. According to Hartley, his piece celebrates the success of the Ukrainians in repulsing the Russian attack on their capital. On loan for the show, “Kyiv: Pro Patria” was purchased earlier this year by an anonymous “friend of the Ukraine patriots,” with proceeds benefiting the Red Cross in Ukraine and two other Ukraine charities. The famous American who purchased the painting spent $50,000. Two other pieces on display at Keyes Gallery include “Retreat from Snake Island,” a painting inspired by the refusal of three Ukrainian lightkeepers to surrender the island to the Russian fleet, and “Red Flight From Izium,” which depicts the Ukrainians striking back at Izium seven months into the stalled Russian invasion, a battle still in process in the drive to push the invaders off Ukrainian land. Altogether, the proceeds for Ukraine should total around $200,000 for education, medicine, humanitarian aid and a safe place to live.\n\nHartley said everyone must do their part as a democratic society to help, and Julie Keyes, owner of the gallery, explained that she will not be collecting a commission on these pieces — all proceeds from sales will go to Ukraine.\n\nMany people at the opening night reception referred to Hartley as a “renaissance man.” Throughout Hartley’s storied life, he’s had careers as an actor, studio executive, producer and U.S. Olympian.\n\nHartley was born in Omaha, Nebraska. He lost his father, an AT&T executive, when he was 5 years old. After his father’s passing, Hartley’s mother worked as a teacher, developing special courses in public schools, raising Hartley and his sister on her own. Hartley was educated at Annapolis, Georgetown University and Harvard Business School. He was a U.S. Olympic finalist in wrestling and head of the international relations section at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. As a civilian, after being discharged from the Navy, he moved through several executive jobs, finally serving as executive vice president of First Western Financial Corporation. When a larger bank purchased that company, he decided to move out of banking and was in Los Angeles for a job interview.\n\nBy pure coincidence, he was offered a continuing role as the Reverend Jerry Bedford in a dramatic television series, “Peyton Place,” which aired from 1964 to 1969. That led to movies and co-starring roles with Clint Eastwood, Cary Grant, Dean Martin and Robert Redford. He ended up starring as the lead in his own television series “Chopper One” on ABC in 1974. He had begun taking assignments in directing television commercials and producing smaller films when he seized the opportunity to become a stockholder in RKO Pictures Corporation, a historic, now independent production studio. Ultimately, Hartley took over as CEO. There he has produced a dozen films and several television movies and expanded RKO into Broadway.\n\nHartley is active on several corporate and charity boards. He is the former chairman of Orbis International, which prevents and treats blindness worldwide through its flying eye-hospital program, and is a founding director of the Steadman Philippon Research Institute for sports injuries. Locally, Hartley serves on the board of the Village Preservation Society of East Hampton. During COVID-19, he relocated to his East Hampton home.\n\n“I am a big city guy,” Hartley said referring to his life in New York City and Los Angeles. “I have a house in East Hampton, and I would not leave it for anything.”\n\nHartley’s late wife was the famed actress Dina Merrill, who was known for her roles in “Operation Petticoat,” “The Sundowners,” “Butterfield 8,” “The Courtship of Eddie’s Father” and “Caddyshack II.” Merrill, he explained, is the reason he became serious about painting. More than a decade ago, as Merrill was entering into what would be a long period of declining health, Hartley, looking for ways to keep her active emotionally and mentally, initiated twice weekly art classes in their home, inviting Merrill’s friends to join.\n\nHartley, a largely self-taught artist, expanded on his own skills by bringing in teachers to work with the group, which included some of Merrill’s best friends who painted alongside her. His fellow art group members encouraged his work, which led to painting, which has become a significant force in his creative life today. Merrill died in East Hampton in May 2017 at age 93.\n\n“I eventually grew into it and all these years later, we can help save Ukraine,” he said. “I can’t get over there with my jet and dive bomb, but I can paint and help share that and share the story,” he said. “It gives me something important to paint about.”\n\nHartley explained that the wonderful thing about being an impressionist instead of a realist — which is more precise — is that impressionists are looking for feeling, not exactness.\n\n“It is freedom to have an idea. The desire to tell a story,” Hartley said of his work. “I am an impressionist. I like painting, I like color, and everything comes together. Whether that’s artistic or not, I do not know but it is certainly fun.”\n\nHartley explained that his painting “Kyiv” will hang proudly on the wall of a famous American to remind everyone of Ukraine for years to come.\n\n“That is a communication device that is not available in many other ways,” he said. “It is not televised, this will stay for years and years and when someone asks about it, they will speak about Ukraine. The painting has a kind of immortality.”\n\nThe exhibition at Keyes Art Gallery includes 20 new works by Hartley, including the three paintings from the artist’s “Ukraine Series.”\n\n“I want to inspire others,” he explained, “to support the defenders in Ukraine as they fight against this brutal invasion. I am the warrior artist, taking up the paintbrush instead of a gun to help the people of Ukraine repulse these invaders.”\n\nKeyes Art Gallery is at 45 Main Street in Sag Harbor. Ted Hartley’s “Stories in Color” remains on view through December 1. Proceeds from the three Ukraine series paintings support the Olena Zelenska Foundation.
