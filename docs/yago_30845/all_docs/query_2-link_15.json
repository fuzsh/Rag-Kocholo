        "text": "Dina Merrill, the rebellious heiress who defied her super-rich parents to become an actress, often portraying stylish wives or “the other woman,” has died. She was 93.\n\nMerrill died Monday, according to a family spokeswoman. The cause of death and other details weren’t immediately available Tuesday.\n\nWith the help of Katharine Hepburn, who recommended her for the 1957 comedy “The Desk Set,” Merrill was a popular star for years, in part because of her resemblance to Grace Kelly. Her films included “Operation Petticoat,” “The Sundowners” and Robert Altman’s Hollywood satire “The Player.” She also was a dedicated philanthropist and supporter of the arts.\n\nMerrill was the daughter of cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post and E.F. Hutton, a multimillionaire industrialist and financier in his own right. One of her childhood homes was Mar-a-Lago, which her mother had built not long after her birth in 1923.\n\nMerrill was born Nedenia Marjorie Hutton in New York City on Dec. 29, 1923. She adopted her stage name when she began her film career.\n\nHer first husband, Stanley Rumbough Jr., also came from a wealthy family and was an heir to the Colgate toothpaste fortune. After she divorced him to marry Oscar-winning actor Cliff Robertson in 1966, her name was removed from the New York Social Register.\n\nShe had expressed surprise that she’d still been included. A few years before her name was excised, Merrill had said: “It’s really so depressing to still be listed in the social register after all the acting I have done.”\n\nAt the time of her death, Merrill had been married to Ted Hartley since 1989.\n\nALSO\n\nRoger Moore dies at 89; debonair British actor played James Bond in 7 movies\n\nRoger Ailes, polarizing and controversial Fox News founder who changed cable news, dies at 77\n\nChris Cornell, who helped reignite hard rock in the 1990s with Soundgarden, dies at 52\n\nUPDATES:\n\n8:50 a.m.: This article was updated with additional information about Merrill’s background."
