        "text": "Before Burt Reynolds was South Florida’s movie star, there was Dina Merrill, daughter of cereals heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post and financier E.F. Hutton.\n\nI was honored to know Dina, who died in May at 93. She came of age at Post’s Palm Beach estate of Mar-a-lago, now the winter home of President Donald Trump.\n\nUnlike other heiresses of her day, Dina wanted to work. She was blond, she was beautiful and she had the determination to forge a stage and film career despite having one very worthy adversary to that career — her father, who wanted her to become a lawyer.\n\nWhen E.F. Hutton spoke, people listened.\n\nBut not Dina, who took a cue from her mother and forged her own path, beginning an acting career in her early 20s before marrying and raising children.\n\nIn the 1950s, at an age when most film stars of the day were moving into matronly roles, Dina Merrill was starring in such films as “Operation Petticoat,” with Cary Grant, and “The Young Savages,” with Burt Lancaster.\n\nBy the time I came to know her, in 2012, Dina’s acting career was over and she was creating watercolor paintings that were sold to raise money for charity.\n\nI interviewed Dina and her husband, Ted\n\nHartley, for a story on an upcoming exhibition of her watercolors at the\n\nLighthouse ArtCenter in\n\nTequesta.\n\nWhen I walked into her apartment at The Breakers in Palm Beach, a couple of miles north of Mar-a-Lago, she sat there alone, smiled, shook my hand firmly, but said nothing.\n\nShe had Lewy body dementia, and that day was not one of her better ones. But her blue eyes sparkled and matched the colors of the ocean and the sky beyond.\n\nDina gradually opened up and told me how she and her father had set out from Sea Cloud, the family yacht, in a longboat in the Galapagos Islands to get a tortoise for soup for her mother.\n\nThey snared a tortoise, but the reptile, named Jumbo, became a pet rather than soup.\n\nJumbo was still alive 80 years later at a park in Hawaii, her husband said.\n\nShe also lit up when I told her about some linens I had that came from the storerooms at Mar-a-Lago, including some tablecloths from Sea Cloud I later donated to the Historical Society of Palm Beach County.\n\nThere, curator Debi Murray figured out that those tablecloths had a motif of signal flags that spelled out “Davies,” Marjorie Merriweather Post’s married name at the time.\n\nThere were other pieces as well, including napkins that bore monograms with the initials of Post and her third husband, Ambassador Joseph Davies, all beautiful, elegant and of the best quality.\n\nThe same could be said for Dina, who is remembered fondly in Palm Beach — my friend Elizabeth, who worked at Elizabeth Arden, tells how the masseuses would jockey to work on Dina when she came to the salon simply because she was so nice.\n\nI agree, because beauty, class and kindness always endure. ¦\n\nTHE FIND:\n\nA pair of Mar-a-Lago napkins\n\nWhere: The Lord’s Place’s Joshua Thrift Store, 7600 S. Dixie Highway, West Palm Beach; 561-537-4666 or www.thelordsplace.org.\n\nPaid: $3 apiece\n\nThe Skinny: I had owned a set of these damask napkins that I later donated to the Historical Society of the Palm Beaches. But I was pleasantly surprised to see two of them hanging on a rack at a thrift shop.\n\nPeople like Marjorie\n\nMerriweather Post entertained on a grand scale and ordered sets of dinnerware and linens in the dozens. You can see the “M” and the “P” of her first and last names entwined with the “D” of her third husband’s last name, Davies. They divorced in the 1950s and many of these pieces went into storage.\n\nDonald Trump auctioned off items from the storerooms at Mar-a-Lago in 1995; things that didn’t get sold at auction were sold in a garage sale of sorts and staff also were allowed to help themselves. That’s no doubt where these came from. ¦"
