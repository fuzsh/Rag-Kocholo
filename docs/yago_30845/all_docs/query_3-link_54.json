        "text": "The Go-Between: book summary\n\nOverview: The Go-BetweenAuthor of The Go-BetweenLP HartleyPublished1953GenreHistorical fiction, bildungsroman, romance novelBrief summary of The Go-BetweenThe story of a young boy named Leo Colston who becomes a messenger, or 'go-between,' for a forbidden love affair between his upper-class friend's sister, Marian, and a local farmer, Ted Burgess.List of main charactersLeo Colston, Marian Maudsley, Ted Burgess, Lord Trimingham the Ninth Viscount, Marcus Maudsley, Leo's MotherThemesClass, loss of innocence, love, destructive power of secretsSettingEarly 1900s in Norfolk, EnglandAnalysisThe novel is structured in two parts, with an older Leo reflecting on his memories of that summer when he was 13 years old and the events that took place at Brandham Hall, the country estate where he was staying. As the summer progresses, Leo becomes increasingly entangled in the affair between Marian and Ted, and he struggles to understand the complexities of adult relationships and the consequences of his actions.\n\nThe Go-Between centres around Leo Colston, a man in his sixties. Leo experienced a traumatic incident as a young boy that has permanently impacted him. He finds a childhood diary and is forced to relive what he has been repressing for so long.\n\nThe young Leo is a naive and innocent boy living in the late Victorian period. He is asked to spend the summer on the estate of his wealthy friend, Marcus Maudsley. Marcus and Leo met in school and became close when the naive Leo claimed to have magical powers. Leo is from a lower-class family but his mother encourages him to go and stay with Marcus's family in Brandham Hall for the summer.\n\nDespite the class difference, Leo quickly begins to enjoy staying in Brandham Hall. He spends a great deal of time exploring, particularly fascinated by the outhouses that hold various plants. He is also treated kindly by the other inhabitants of the house. During this time, Leo meets a number of people who will become important characters in The Go-Between. He is introduced to Marcus's older sister, Marian, who he soon becomes infatuated with. Leo also encounters Ted Burgess, an intimidating local farmer. Not long after, Leo is introduced to Lord Trimingham who owns the land that Brandham Hall is on. Trimingham takes an interest in Leo and treats him well.\n\nMarcus is struck down by the measles and forced to quarantine in his room. This leads to Leo having more freedom and spending more time alone. He also begins to spend time with both Marian and Ted separately. Trimingham asks Leo to relay a message to Marian that she has left her prayer book in church after a service. This is foreshadowing and sets up Leo's role as a messenger for the rest of The Go-Between.\n\nWhile playing on Ted's farm, Leo injures his knee and Ted helps tend to his injury. To thank him, Leo agrees to ferry a message from Ted to Marian. This becomes a regular occurrence. Leo consistently takes messages back and forth between Marian and Ted. His innocence leads him to believe they are discussing business of some sort.\n\nLeo eventually opens one of the letters and discovers that it is a love letter. Marian and Ted are having an affair that they must keep a secret because of their different classes. Leo is now uncomfortable acting as their messenger. He attempts to get out of it but is unable to.\n\nNot long after, Marcus informs Leo that Marian is now engaged to Lord Trimingham. Leo is relieved and believes this means Marian and Ted's letters will now stop. This does not come to pass and Marian again asks Leo to take a letter to Ted. This upsets Leo greatly but he ends up acting as the couple's messenger once again.\n\nLeo is desperate to break the couple apart. He slightly changes a message Ted sends to Marian and even tries to create a magical potion to split them up. Mrs. Maudsley, Marcus and Marian's mother, has become suspicious of Marian's disappearances. She has recently been unwell as she has been so worried that Marian will break off her engagement with Trimingham.\n\nOn the day of Leo's birthday, Marian is missing. Mrs. Maudsley forces Leo to help her look for Marian. In a traumatising scene, Mrs. Maudsley and Leo discover Marian and Ted having sex in one of the outhouses. The repercussions of this cause Ted to take his own life.\n\nThe Go-Between: themes\n\nThe main themes in The Go-Between are class, loss of innocence, and the dangers of secrets.\n\nClass\n\nClass is key to an analysis of The Go-Between. It is possible that if class had not been a factor, Marian and Ted would never have had the tragic ending that they did.\n\nHartley is representing a very specific time period in his novel. This period is the late Victorian era that occurred at the turn of the twentieth century. At this time, society had very strict ideas about class. People were expected to stick to their class and behave in the way thought appropriate by society. Marriage between classes was particularly looked down upon.\n\nThese issues are very relevant in Marian and Ted's relationship. The only way they can communicate is through letters and the only way they can see each other is in secret meetings. This is because Marian is from a very wealthy upper-class background and Ted is a working-class farmer. The couple can be certain that no one around them would ever approve of their relationship. Marian's deep distress about this is obvious when Leo questions her over why she cannot simply just marry Ted. Leo's naivety means he cannot understand this situation yet.\n\nThis is complicated even further when Marian becomes engaged to Lord Trimingham. He is seen as an appropriate match for her. Trimingham is the character in The Go-Between with the highest social rank.\n\nHartley shows how deep Marian and Ted's love is by the fact that they continue their affair despite Marian's engagement. Their deep love is most extremely emphasised by Ted's taking of his own life. This is traumatising for all involved. It could be that Ted believed this late Victorian world would never allow him and Marian to be together and, therefore, he did not want to live.\n\nIt is also relevant that Leo is who Marian and Ted choose to carry their messages. Like Ted, Leo is also from a lower-class background. Leo is also unique because he is too young and naive to understand societal and class rules yet. Everyone around him, even Marcus, understands that it is not considered appropriate for different classes to mix. As seen in the below quote, Leo cannot comprehend this and asks Marian why she cannot just marry Ted. Leo is the perfect messenger for them as he does not yet understand why they must communicate via letters in the first place.\n\n“Marian, why don’t you marry Ted?” It was only for a moment, but in that moment her face reflected all the misery she had been going through; it was a heart’s history in a look. “I couldn’t, I couldn’t!” She wailed. “Can’t you see why?” (Chp. 20)\n\nLoss of innocence\n\nAt the beginning of The Go-Between, it is clear that the young Leo is a very innocent child. He still believes in magic and sees the world in a childlike way. Leo is aware of the adult world around him but does not have access to it yet. For example, he begs Ted to explain sex to him but in a moment of innocence refers to it as 'spooning'.\n\nLeo's innocence is also represented symbolically. Marian buys Leo a new suit as his other clothes are not considered proper enough for the new high society he is in. The suit is green and Leo loves it, frequently showing it off. The colour green can be seen to represent innocence. This is even said by Marcus to Leo in a moment of anger later on.\n\nAs a bildungsroman, it is expected that Leo, as the protagonist, will experience challenges and struggles that push him towards maturity. In The Go-Between, there is a more extreme version of this maturing present. Leo has a sudden and abrupt loss of innocence. He and Mrs. Maudsley discover Marian and Ted having sex in an outhouse. Ted then commits suicide as a result. This leaves Leo permanently traumatised and impacts the rest of his adult life. He does not merely lose his innocence but loses access to the emotional side of his life because of what he has witnessed. Leo is sharply forced into adulthood before he is ready for it.\n\nThe older Leo acknowledges how much of an effect this loss of innocence has had on him. He decided to cut himself off from emotions and focus solely on facts. This has led to Leo's life lacking any intimate relationships. His loss of innocence at a young age has had a detrimental impact on his life."
