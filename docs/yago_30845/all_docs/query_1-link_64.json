        "text": "After his wife Dina's death in 2017, her friends wanted to continue the art classes he had started to keep Dina engaged and Hartley started it up again. Now fully exploring his own found passion in painting, he progressed from representational art into more daring subjective expressionism. His fellow art group members encouraged his work which became suddenly a major force in his creative life.\n\nIn the fall of 2019, his first one-artist opened at Keyes Art in Sag Harbor sold out most of the offerings. Since, he has had two other exhibits at Keyes Art. Showings in Palm Beach and Hamptons Fine Arts Fair 2023."
