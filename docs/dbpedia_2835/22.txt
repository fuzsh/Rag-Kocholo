Together with Axess, the Bank of China has launched a new major project in winter 2019/20, which enables customers to access several ski resorts with a single ski pass and thus spend a varied day in the snow.

The Bank of China (BoC) is the fourth largest bank in the world and serves approximately 280 million private customers. Founded in 1984, it is one of the most important companies in the city of Beijing. BoC is also an official partner of the 2022 Winter Olympics, and now the company has embarked on a special project to offer its customers more in the leisure sector as well.

The ski areas Genting Resort Secret Garden, Thaiwoo Ski Resort & Alpine Park and Wanlong Paradise Resort have joined forces under the BoC and can now be visited with a single ski pass. This is an RFID-WTP smart card that allows guests to ski in all ski areas. Bank of China customers also receive special conditions and discounts. Thus, all parties involved benefit equally from this special ski pass.

The first stage of the project comprises the three largest ski resorts in the city of Zhangjiakou in the Chinese province of Hebei. Zhangjiakou will host several competitions during the 2022 Olympic and Para-Olympic Winter Games.

Access solutions from Axess

In order to offer guests a comfortable experience, the ski resorts were equipped or extended with innovative products and access solutions from Axess. Among others Axess CONTROLLER 600, AX500 Smart Gates NG, TVM (Ticket Vending Machine), Axess SMART PAD 600, Axess SMART PRINTER 600 and Smart Cards TRW FULL.

Visitors who want this common ski pass for the three ski areas can simply select and buy it in the BoC Official Mobile App, the China Railway Official Mobile App or in the resortsâ€™ official WeChat online shops. On site, they only must go to a ticket counter or a TVM. At a TVM, guests can pick up their personal ski pass, contactless and without standing in long queues.
