Farida Elsefary Nader Fouad #CIB_Summer_Internship_2024\n\nMy Summer Internship At Au Bank I am very delighted to tell that I am doing my internship at au bank for training in the functions of banking and working for experience in the stipulated time.lets talk about au bank. About Au bank Arising from the raw passion to build the nation Mr. Sanjay Agarwal the First Generation Chartered Accountant Merit Holder took upon the challenge to finance the entrepreneur dream of the un-reached and un-banked populace of India. This dream was brought into reality and Au Financiers was started in the year 1996. Originally based in Jaipur and Rajasthan, this NBFC as a retail focused company has been catering to the credit needs of the rural and urban population for the past two decades delivering fast and account specific credit solution. Subsequently, getting the Small Finance Bank (SFB) licence in 2015, Au Financiers-ST started its operation as SFB from 19th April 2017. The same year in November, it has been awarded the Scheduled Bank status and later on, has entered the list of Fortune India 500 companies. Over the years, it has shifted from an NBFC to a Bank and primarily looks at solutions, with consideration given to its clients. Being Bankers to the depositors‚Äô wealth, the Bank remained fully compliant throughout the process and concluded as a well-governed and trustworthy Financial Institutions under the aegis of sounded Banking Principles namely, Inclusiveness; Progress for all, simplicity, & Action & Urgency. And in the year 2021, The bank emerged as the Largest Small Finance Bank of the nation and changed tagline from ‚ÄòChalo aage badhein‚Äô to ‚ÄòBadlaav humse hai‚Äô. This is also the first tagline which is the Bank‚Äôs integrated brand campaign, and it clearly matches the spirit of the institution, propounding the notion of defying norms. New brand campaign was initiated simultaneously with the Product launch and with this company unveiled digital platform AU 0101, Credit Card and QR Code with Sound Box. As we can observe the writing the rule book and demand of customer‚Äôs also changing with this technological advancement the Bank is diving in the race of Tech-led Bank. By embracing technology, driving financial inclusion, and building strong customer relationships, the Bank has transformed lives and contributed to the economic development of the nation. The footprints expanded from 403 Touchpoints in 8 States and 2 Union Territories in 2017 to 2383 Touchpoints in 21 States and 4 Union Territories as on 31st March 2024. Looking ahead, the Bank remains committed to its mission, constantly evolving, and adapting to meet the changing needs of the customers and continuing to make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions\n\nSo, we have always believed in following certain trends in Banking but I personally believe that we can do 3 things which will prove to be useful in decreasing our work load as well as getting more recruitments:- 1. We have always seen that branch offices are always in the city headquarter or in the district but nowadays it is an era of digitalisation. So, we can shift our offices in villages where people understand banking procedure and will further help us in talent allocation. 2. The place which is currently used as banks must be used as a common training centre both for the consumers and employees. 3. These training centres should make us aware of net banking where an instructor should be treated as a banking intern. This will lead to an easy recruitment process as well as an effective way of serving our rural consumers. #LinkedIn #BankingTrends #NewModel #WomenEmpowerment #MoreEmployment\n\nThe fourth competition in my journey in CIB summer internship.
