Deep Dive into Digital Marketing and Fintech at the CIB Program. üíô‚ú®Ô∏è InstaPay is a real-time electronic payment service that allows users to transfer funds instantly between different bank accounts. It operates at any time, including weekends and holidays, and is designed to facilitate quick, secure, and convenient transactions. - Why InstaPay is Favorable: 1. Speed and Convenience: - InstaPay enables instant transfers, which is particularly beneficial for urgent payments or transactions that require immediate confirmation. - Users can avoid delays associated with traditional banking hours and multiple-day processing times. 2. Accessibility: - It promotes financial inclusion by making electronic payments accessible to more people, including those in remote areas or without access to traditional banking services. - Users only need a bank account and internet access to utilize InstaPay, reducing barriers to financial services. 3. Cost-Effective: - It typically involves lower transaction fees compared to traditional wire transfers or physical money transfers. - This affordability encourages more people and businesses to use electronic payments instead of cash or checks, which can be costly and less secure. 4. Enhanced Security: - InstaPay transactions are secure and traceable, reducing the risks associated with carrying large sums of cash or using less secure payment methods.

We have always seen that branch offices are always in the city headquarter or in the district but nowadays it is an era of digitalisation. So, we can shift our offices in villages where people understand banking procedure and will further help us in talent allocation. 2. The place which is currently used as banks must be used as a common training centre both for the consumers and employees. 3. These training centres should make us aware of net banking where an instructor should be treated as a banking intern. This will lead to an easy recruitment process as well as an effective way of serving our rural consumers. #LinkedIn #BankingTrends #NewModel #WomenEmpowerment #MoreEmployment\n\nThe fourth competition in my journey in CIB summer internship. Instapay is the best FinTech solution It is an app that allows direct access to all your bank accounts and transfer instantly using your mobile device ,it is an electronic payment system that allows users to conduct financial transactions quickly and easily online or via mobile phones. Instapay is the first payment service provider application licensed by the central bank of Egypt to operate over the instant payment network, Enabling instant transfers between banks 24/7 the CBE license entails instapay's full compliance to information security and payment privacy legislation and requirements. Instant Payment Network member banks are integrated into the network to accept and process onboarded customers instructions based on customer authorization. The network member banks are licensed by the CBE to allow InstaPay to process customers' transactions The app guarantees quality as far as the service is concerned; however, with several parties involved in the transaction success, network connectivity and member banks service may impact the desired assurance. It features the ability to pay bills, transfer money, and make various payments in a secure and convenient manner. InstaPay provides you with the transaction status instantly, the status can be one of the following: Successful Transaction: means that the transfer amount is credited to the beneficiary account. Rejected Transaction: means that the transfer was rejected, and the transfer amount is reversed to the sender account. Pending Transaction: which means that the transaction is sent to the beneficiary bank which will executed it shorty. The transaction status will be updated shortly with either being successful or rejected. InstaPay is essential for me as it simplifies my financial transactions, making payments and money transfers fast and secure. #CIB #CIB_Egypt #CIB_Summer_Internship_2024 thanks Farida Elsefary\n\nMost top-tier corporate and retail banks like HSBC, Hang Seng Bank, Citibank and Bank of China have started recruiting management trainees and interns for 2023/2024. But each year, the rivalry for bank MTs or bank interns is getting more intense, and only 10 to 20% of the applicants may pass the initial assessment stages and aptitude tests alone, not to mention the subsequent challenges like assessment centres as well as the panel interview. So how confident are you to clear the apt test and get an offer from your target firm? Remember that banks use different testing systems. Given up to 80% of the applicants will get rejected based on their apt test result, it is crucial to understand each apt test system, and consistent practice is a MUST so that you don't get rejected too early and miss reaching the interview stages. NOW is the time to start familiarising yourself with the special features of popular apt tests. Avoid common pitfalls, understand and hack the scoring system (yes, wrong answers can lead to marks deduction!) and the newer AI-based screening tests. To save you from more stress, we will organise a webinar: Comprehensive Guide to Ace Aptitude Tests and Land Bank MT/ Intern Offers. The webinar is by invitation only. There are limited 100 seats. To register for free, you will: 1. Like the post 2. Leave your email address in the comment We will then email you the details for the training session. As most bank applications are going to open soon, you can‚Äôt lose more time.

Hosted by Mrs.Farida Elsefary who diligently addressed our questions and ensured we were on the right path, this week was packed with invaluable insights and learning experiences. #Day5: ¬ªRetail Banking: We delved into the realm of retail banking, understanding its role in serving the financial needs of the general public. Notably, 45% of CIB's profitability comes from retail banking, which has been a part of CIB Egypt for the past 15 years. The session, led by Mr.Ahmed Rady emphasized the division of retail banking into product sections and segment sections. #Day6: ¬ªBanking Industry & Segmentation: Mrs. Sherihan Elhelw head of private distribution, discussed the significance of segmenting customers to cater to their specific needs, enhancing satisfaction and loyalty. For instance, the private section targets customers with more than 20 million EGP in their accounts. ¬ªOverseas Banking: Mr. Hassan Abo El Goukh CFA and head of overseas banking, highlighted that CIB Egypt provides specialized services for the 14 million Egyptians working abroad, including tailored products like secured credit card issuance and delivery. He also shared appreciation messages from satisfied overseas customers. #Day7: ¬ªFinancial Entrepreneurship: Mr. Juan Gamecho provided a crucial class on fundamental financial entrepreneurship concepts. Key takeaways included: ‚Ä¢The goal of profit maximization should be balanced with long-term business sustainability. ‚Ä¢SMEs in Egypt are among the oldest in the region. ‚Ä¢Capital is divided into equity (share capital) and debt (loans). ‚Ä¢Key financial terms: profit as the bottom line, sales as the top line. ‚Ä¢Understanding financial statements: income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. ‚Ä¢The balance sheet reveals a company‚Äôs solvency, debt capacity, and liquidity. #Day8: ¬ªSustainability & Sustainable Finance: As climate change becomes a global concern, the focus on sustainability is paramount. We learned: ‚Ä¢Sustainability involves ensuring our actions benefit society, minimize harmful impacts, and secure resources for future generations. ‚Ä¢ESG (Environment, Society, and Governance) is a critical framework. ‚Ä¢Since 2015, CIB Egypt has collaborated with GRI, utilized ecological reports for over three years, introduced green bonds, and advocated for sustainability across organizations. A huge thank you to all the speakers for their insights and expertise Vasilya Sultanova Begad Eleish Morcos Mikhail Nader Fouad CIB Egypt Looking forward to the upcoming weeks and the continued learning ahead! ü´∂üèªüëèüèª #CIB_Summer_Internship_2024 #CIBEgypt #BankingIndustry #DigitalMarketing #Sustainability #ESG #SummerInternship #DataLiteracy #Entrepreneurship #SustainableFinance #SMEs #PersonalDevelopment #ProfessionalGrowth\n\nDuring my time at Zhangjiakou Bank I assisted clients with inquiries, worked with team members to ensure smooth operations, and demonstrated professionalism in the banking environment. It also showcases my practical experience and ability to handle responsibilities with calm and competence. Work Content and Abilities: Customer Service: I consistently provided excellent customer service by actively listening to customers' needs, addressing their concerns, and ensuring their satisfaction. This demonstrated my strong communication skills, empathy, and ability to build rapport with diverse individuals. Financial Transactions: I successfully handled various financial transactions, such as deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers, with meticulous attention to detail. This showcases my accuracy, numerical proficiency, and ability to maintain confidentiality in handling sensitive information. Teamwork: I actively participated in team meetings, collaborated with colleagues, and contributed to a harmonious work environment. By sharing ideas, supporting teammates, and demonstrating flexibility, I showcased my strong teamwork skills and the ability to work effectively in a collaborative setting. Adaptability: During my internship, I quickly adapted to the fast-paced nature of the banking industry. I effectively managed multiple tasks, prioritized responsibilities, and maintained composure under pressure. This demonstrates my ability to handle challenges, be proactive, and thrive in dynamic work.\n\nüö® Free Resource ALERT üö® ùêíùêûùêúùê´ùêûùê≠ ùêìùê¢ùê©ùê¨ ùê≠ùê® ùêÄùêúùêû 2023 ùêàùêÅ & ùêÅùêöùêßùê§ ùêàùêßùê≠ùêûùê´ùêØùê¢ùêûùê∞ùê¨- ùêÄùê•ùê• ùêíùêúùê´ùêûùêûùêßùê¢ùêßùê† ùêíùê≠ùêöùê†ùêûùê¨ With banks like #societegenerale #barclays #hsbc hiring across investment banking and banking roles some of you would already have started the screening process, while the others may be waiting for your interview invitations. Did you know that barely 60-65% students can pass the video interview (like HireVue AI system) which means, almost half of the applicants end up not getting shortlisted and have no idea why? üòµ Not to mention, the rejection rate of assessment centres and psychometric tests can vary between 54-80% across the top grad jobs and internship roles. Since different banks, #investmentbank and #advisory firms use diverse screening stages and interview formats, students who use the same strategy for all banks, run the risk of getting screened out early. Besides, banks like Citi updated their hiring procedure in 2023 by introducing a video interview as the first screening round (which they didn‚Äôt use until last year!) We understand that tracking all these updates can be quite stressful, so HKCareers has compiled a comprehensive list for students. It will be your one stop shop for the interview and screening process employed by ALL banks and investment banks. Our students also used this list to step up their interview preparation game to already bag offers for 2023/24. Want to be the next one with multiple offers??

My admiration prompted me to study banking and finance with the hope of working in the bank. As a young girl, I felt working in the bank would solve all my financial problems. Luckily for me, I got my first job with Access Bank plc immediately after my NYSC. I was very excited and comfortable with my first salary as a fresh graduate. I felt I had arrived, I worked with enthusiasm and wished life could remain so. I had a target-driven supervisor who was passionate about the success of the team both corporately and individually. She was ever willing to teach, guide, instruct, and correct. The teamwork was top-notch. I enjoyed my first job. Fast forward to growth. Innovation and passion for growth led to my exploring other opportunities, but the experience was the opposite. I then realized that growth and maturity are a combination of both good and bad experiences. Both make you develop a thick skin. My good and bad experiences gave birth to my becoming a digital entrepreneur and an online sales coach. I believe in innovation, learning new skills, and adapting to change which is inevitable. I have decided to use all the skills I acquired as an experienced customer service advisor and sales expert to explore the digital world and impact others on how to sell to difficult customers, how to convert a prospect to a customer, the right way to follow up on unsatisfied customers and retain them, how to transition from a 9-5 job to an entrepreneur and how to make legit money online using your smartphones. It is crystal clear that the new world order has come to stay, which is AI. Sooner or later, some jobs may not need humans. The question is how informed are you? Those with the right information and implementation skills will surely win. Please tag someone who needs to see this. #breakingbarriers #onlinesales"
