It has been offered in more than 57 countries and regions such as the United States, Japan, Singapore, Australia, the United Kingdom, Russia, Canada, South Korea and Hong Kong. Cooperation institutions include 16 local banks such as CIBC of Canada, Woori Bank of South Korea, BOC Hong Kong, HSBC of Singapore, as well as 31 mainstream remittance institutions such as MoneyGram, Wise, paysend and omipay. Through cooperative desks, official websites, mobile apps and other service channels provided by these institutions, overseas remitters can easily make cross-border remittances to UnionPay cards of 70 national and local banks, including industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of communications, Huaxia Bank and Bank of Dalian. Cardholders in China can directly collect the money in RMB to further consume or withdraw to avoid the trouble of foreign exchange.\n\nDifferent from the traditional cross-border telegraphic transfer, MoneyExpress settles the exchange rate in advance and deposit the remittance into the remittee’s UnionPay account in RMB. Therefore, the payee does not need to handle the payment of remittance or pay the bank service fee; she/he can use the money directly. In general, the remittance is deposited into the payee’s account in real time or within 12 hours.\n\nSending institutions that support this service are as follows:\n\nDomestic receiving institutions of Mainland China that support MoneyExpress are as follows:"
