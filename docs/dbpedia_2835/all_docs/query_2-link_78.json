        "text": "Overview\n\nFAQs\n\nSolarCity is a web application provided by IRENA to enable households, businesses and municipal authorities to evaluate the prospects for electricity generation using rooftop-mounted solar PV installations.\n\nThe methodology of the SolarCity simulator can be deployed worldwide, including in locations where solar potential is high but not yet fully evaluated. The first implementations of the simulator were in the districts of Kasese in Uganda and Chongli in Zhangjiakou, China. SolarCity is one of a series of web applications developed by IRENA as part of the Global Atlas for Renewable Energy.\n\nThe solar irradiation simulation for SolarCity is very accurate. To correctly estimate the effects of shading, rooftops are captured in three dimensions, with the respective tilt and azimuths of each rooftop section determined before the shading simulations are applied (see methodology).\n\nThe calculations have been made using a base resolution of one metre – the same as the source imagery.\n\nWe estimated the amount of energy (in kWh) that can be produced from sunlight based on the size of the system (in kW) per year. In this case, the user can use any conversion efficiency that corresponds to the technology of interest to calculate the yield.\n\nThe combined uncertainty in the models used to perform these calculations (irradiation and performance) is estimated to be typically around 5% when fed with accurate input data. However, as this is the first implementation with rooftop attributes that have been calculated from satellite-sourced imagery at 1 m resolution, the precise uncertainty estimate will be updated after the release of the platform.\n\nNo. The PV performance modelled in the SolarCity simulator, although calculated on an hourly time stamp over a typical meteorological year, has been aggregated to provide annual average results to simplify the calculations and visuals.\n\nYes. The option to configure storage has been included in the simulator to allow users to assess how to live off the grid and be energy self-sufficient when excess solar energy cannot be fed into the electricity grid.\n\nThe general architecture of the SolarCity simulator contains a module for empirical and business assessments of net metering, feed-in tariffs and storage capabilities.\n\nFor investment and operating costs, the default values are obtained from either IRENA’s Costing Database or IRENA’s focal points in the country; users can edit these values.\n\nThe current version of the SolarCity simulator has been built for demonstration in Kasese, Uganda and Zhangjiakou, China. With careful consideration on a case by case basis, IRENA may work with its Members to develop versions of the simulator for selected cities in their countries. For more information, please contact IRENA’s Resource Assessment unit at: GlobalAtlasServices@irena.org.\n\nOn a case by case basis, IRENA may decide to use the capabilities of SolarCity to conduct specific studies requested by its Members. The outcome of such studies could be in the form of a published report and may not include interactive software online. Please contact IRENA for more information at: GlobalAtlasServices@irena.org.\n\nYou may download the SolarCity methodology report here.\n\nUser Guidance\n\nThe Setting section presents the capacity of solar PV panels that can be accommodated on a single (or multiple) rooftop(s) as well as the self-consumption of a single (or multiple) building(s).\n\nThe Set Input tab allows users to adjust some of the parameters of the analysis. This window comprises two sets of parameters: non-alterable and alterable.\n\nThe non-alterable parameters – such as the PV capacity, surface area, number of buildings and annual consumption – are precalculated by the SolarCity simulator based on the user’s chosen configuration and area of interest. The annual consumption figure responds to user interaction via the consumption subsection of the tuner.\n\nAlterable parameters, such as storage capacity, PV efficiency, system cost, interest rate, loan, loan period, emission factors, average consumption, tariffs, tax credits and subsidies can be adjusted as required. The SolarCity simulator recalculates the outputs of the ‘Financing’ and ‘Environmental (and Social) Benefits’ sections of the ‘Output’ panel.\n\nFor instance, by inputting values for subsidies or income tax credits, the SolarCity simulator can assess the economic feasibility of rooftop solar PV systems. This assessment is based on a simplified model that assumes a solar programme aiming at full utilisation of all suitable rooftop spaces.\n\nNote that the output metrics comprise the direct accounting cost of the subsidy or income tax credits to the municipal or central authorities and the prospective value created by these interventions. This first approximation does not estimate the indirect costs of implementing the schemes or measure the positive and negative externalities that may arise from their implementation.\n\nAll outputs from the SolarCity model can be downloaded by clicking on the ‘Get report’ icon in the ‘Results’ section.\n\nGlossary\n\nThe amount of electricity used by selected household(s) per year.\n\nThe amount of electricity used on average per household per year.\n\nPrice to be paid to a consumer per kWh of electricity fed into the grid (on-grid) or saved in the storage system (off-grid) if there is any surplus power generated from the rooftop solar PV system.

The default value for a passenger vehicle is set to 4,600 kg, assuming an average gasoline vehicle has a fuel economy of 9.35 kilometres per litre and drives 18,500 km per year (EPA, 2019). This is used in SolarCity as a basic indicator only.\n\nParameter used to estimate the equivalent carbon savings of an installation in terms of number of mature trees planted in a tropical environment.

This is obtained from local authorities in the city.\n\nArea of the rooftop surface covered with solar PV panels.\n\nResults\n\nThis section presents results from metrics that are considered a priority when assessing the potential for rooftop spaces. It contains three sections: Installation, Financing and Environmental (and Social) Benefits.\n\nThe Installation section presents the selected area of the rooftop for installing solar PV panels, with annual production and annual consumption in kWh per single or multiple buildings per year.\n\nThe Financing section presents the following relevant output metrics and considered models:\n\nTotal investment required with total annual revenue for building owners or promoters;\n\nPolicy costs (generation and installation subsidies, and tax credits), total value created, and the resulting coverage of electricity for end-use and reduction of alternative sources;\n\nFinancial indicators to guide private and public investments, such as equity internal rate of return (EIRR), payback to equity; Understanding of the broad economic, social and environmental benefits of interventions introduced to the market, for municipal authorities;\n\nFinancial payment options to help indigent people address concerns regarding significant upfront investments and illustrate revenue through dynamic graphs.\n\nRelevant output metrics are calculated based on two optional financing models:\n\nA ‘buy financing model’, wherein the building or estate owner intends to buy the solar PV system for personal or localised consumption without the intention of selling electricity;\n\nA ‘lease financing model’, wherein a private or public investor intends to buy the solar PV system for a community by leasing a rooftop from a building owner. The investor will pay the annual rent to the building owners and in return gain a profit from: selling part of the electricity to the consumers for their consumption; subsidies or tax credits; selling the remaining electricity to the grid at a benchmark tariff (on-grid); or storing electricity for other forms of consumption at a benchmark tariff (off-grid).\n\nThe Environmental (and social) benefits section presents fundamental indicators of the prospective positive impact that rooftop system installations may have on the environment (and society). Outputs in this section include: the estimated CO2, CO2e, PM and NOx emissions avoided; their equivalent carbon emissions that may be offset in terms of tropical trees planted and passenger cars taken off the streets; and jobs created resulting from PV installations.\n\nGlossary\n\nCategories that define the electricity services available to household consumers in a location. The term was established by the World Bank’s Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme (ESMAP) and later adopted as a metric by the Sustainable Energy for All initiative (SEforAll). For more information see the Multi-Tier Access Framework.\n\nEstimates of air pollutants (NOx [nitrogen oxides]; PM2.5 [particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres]), and emissions avoided per year when sourcing electricity from rooftop solar PV rather than from alternatives (combustion processes), all of which are of great concern to human health.\n\nAmount of electricity used by selected household(s) per year.\n\nEstimated electricity generated by the rooftop solar PV installation in one calendar year.\n\nFinancing model where the building owners or estate promoter intends to buy the system. Another model is the ‘lease model’, where the private or public investor intends to buy the system with a view to selling the electricity to neighbouring consumers, to the grid or (on off-grid sites) for storage.\n\nEquivalent number of passenger cars taken off the streets for one year when electricity is generated by a rooftop solar PV installation. A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tonnes (4,600 kg) of carbon dioxide per year (EPA, 2019). It has been used in SolarCity as an indicator only.\n\nMeasures the efficiency, quality or yield of the equity investment.\n\nEstimates of greenhouse gases (CO2 [carbon dioxide]; CO2e [carbon dioxide equivalent]) emissions avoided per year when sourcing electricity from the rooftop solar PV system instead of alternatives (combustion processes). CO2e is a metric measure used to compare the emissions of various greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 [methane], N2O [nitrous oxide], HFCs [hydrofluorocarbons], PFCs [perfluorocarbons], and SF6 [sulphur hexafluoride]) based on their 100-year global warming potential.\n\nCost of the solar PV system with or without a solar storage system. Estimates include shipment, taxes and installation.\n\nFinancing model where the private or public investor buys the solar PV system for a community and homeowners do not bear the cost of investing in the system. The investor will pay the annual rent to the homeowners and profit from: (i) selling part of the electricity to the consumers for their self-consumption; (ii) selling the excess electricity to the grid or storing it at a benchmark tariff; and/or (iii) claiming subsidies.\n\nLength of time required to recoup the equity investment used to set up the rooftop solar PV system with or without storage.\n\nTotal peak electrical capacity of the solar PV panels installed.\n\nArea of the rooftop surface covered with solar PV panels.\n\nRevenue from the electricity consumption savings provided by the rooftop solar PV system compared to equivalent consumption from the grid.\n\nRevenue of the electricity saved in storage for other consumption under the off-grid scenario.\n\nRevenue from selling the remaining electricity back to the grid under the on-grid scenario.\n\nRevenue from a subsidy scheme offered for installing rooftop PV systems. This includes generation and installation subsidies.\n\nSelf-consumption is defined as the ratio of the energy use from on-site generation to the total energy generated.\n\nMeasures cumulative revenue without a bank loan. This definition does not consider the time value of money.\n\nEquivalent number of trees planted in a tropical environment to electricity generated by a rooftop solar PV system.\n\nThe initial investment, starting capital or advance payment before other payments, deductions or returns.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis project is part of the International Climate Initiative (IKI).
