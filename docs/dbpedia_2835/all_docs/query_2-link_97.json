        "text": "Piaohao, literally “houses of remittance drafts,” were family-owned banking firms originating in Shanxi, an inland northern province straddling the Qing–Russian border. These merchants-turned-bankers had traded tea and fur between Russia, Mongolia, and the Chinese interior since the conclusion of the Treaty of Kiakhta in 1727. When the Qing monetary system was connected to the New World silver system in the 1800s, piaohao began providing speedy credit instruments in the form of banking drafts and bills of exchange for interregional traders, and they subsequently built expansive financial networks throughout the Qing dynasty.Footnote 1 In the 1850s, piaohao rose to national prominence by shouldering the responsibility of public finance as private financier and collecting and transferring taxes on behalf of provincial governments. After 1895, piaohao shrank in size and scope, when the Qing court began to reclaim financial sovereignty from private financiers and implement modern financial centralization reforms modeled after Western and Japanese systems. However, piaohao intentionally chose not to be subjugated to the Qing's modern financial centralization and gradually transitioned out of banking and finance at the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nIn 1917, Li Hongling (1847–1918), a former piaohao senior employee who had managed branches for over fifty years in Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan, published his autobiography, tellingly titled The Success and Failure of Shanxi Piaohao Merchants. He wrote how, in 1908, he strove to prevent the collapse of piaohao by proposing the existing twenty-odd piaohao merge into a Western-style modern bank. Unmoved by his logic, Li's fellow owners and managers vehemently rejected the reform. By 1917, most piaohao decided to end their operations. Li subsequently ascribed the shutdown to the ultra-conservative attitude and practices of piaohao bankers who failed to seize new financial opportunities that emerged in treaty ports and coastal areas of south China, thus hindering piaohao from transforming into modern Western-style banks at the turn of the twentieth century.Footnote 2\n\nLi Hongling's autobiography, the only narrative left by an immediate participant of piaohao, paved the way for the modernist financial discourse created by piaohao followers and scholars throughout the twentieth century. This discourse considered piaohao's transformation into modern Western-style banks as the only future and rejected any other paths piaohao chose. Since Li, the history of piaohao has been ossified by generations of scholars as China's “premodern banking subaltern,” trapped in the binary opposition of traditional family firms versus Western-style modern banks.Footnote 3 Even the history of Shanxi Province since the 1840s was folded into this modernist discourse, as a negative example of the northern Chinese “periphery,” which “turned … from a major trading corridor into an isolated and inaccessible province” after the Qing privileged industrialization and export-oriented commerce in treaty ports over that in the north interior. Shanxi was thus remade as part of “the Chinese hinterland.” Modernist discourse also portrayed local Shanxi elites as stubborn ultraconservatives adhering to Confucianism and opposing corporatism and liberalism (read “Western modernity”).Footnote 4\n\nThis article challenges the universalizing application of Western-style financial modernization to the history of Chinese family banking firms through three interrelated histories: (1) the invention, internalizion, and institutionalization of the modernist financial discourse by piaohao participants, followers, and scholars from 1900 to the present; (2) the capitalist role of piaohao as financial intermediaries between China's northern interior and southern and southeastern coastal areas during the nineteenth century; and 3) family-centered capitalist and non-capitalist histories countering piaohao's unrealized financial path to modern Western-style banks.Footnote 5 Bridging the capitalist and sociocultural histories of family banking firms, this article criticizes the modernist financial discourse and its anachronistic application to the history of piaohao and Shanxi Province.\n\nIn the context of the development of Shanxi piaohao, originating from China's northern interior, I define the capitalist history of piaohao and the expansionist role it played in transforming the market, trade, money, and finance in north China and its coastal areas during the nineteenth century. Unlike previous scholars’ indiscriminate use of “capitalist” as both a positive and negative interchangeably, this article treats the term as neutral, emphasizing piaohao as a transformative commercial and financial enterprise to maximize profit from the emerging global trade.Footnote 6 In other words, this study counters the perceived uniqueness and universalism of the Western European economy. Instead, it adopts the Braudelian emphasis on an essential feature of the general history of capitalism in a global context; that is, its unlimited flexibility and capacity for change and adaptation, as seen throughout the history of the Shanxi merchants and piaohao firms, not confined to the singular future of their transformation into modern Western-style banks.Footnote 7\n\nIt is essential to recognize the many financial and non-financial long-term choices made by piaohao families as social and cultural enterprises rather than impersonal financial institutions. Piaohao bankers’ family-centered strategies for change and adaptation prioritized prosperity and fortune as families instead of financial institutions.\n\nNevertheless, this study does not simply reject the enduring legacies of Western-style financial centralization and institutions in fin-de-siècle China, particularly from a macroeconomic perspective. China's first-ever central bank, the Bank of the Board of Revenue established in 1904, generated a long-awaited institutional link between taxation and the Qing's long-term financial liability and spending capacity at the turn of the twentieth century.Footnote 8 On the other hand, from a microeconomic perspective, Chinese family banking firms such as piaohao should be treated as special mercantile and social enterprises with adaptability, flexibility, and rapidity in moving toward the arena of high profit. For piaohao merchant-bankers, profit and loss always had to be set in the context of the future of the family as a whole, rather than through the Qing's macroeconomic transformation into a modern nation-state through Western-style financial reforms.Footnote 9 After 1895, the Qing's accelerated financial centralization made piaohao's negotiations with the newly refashioned modern fiscal state increasingly difficult, forcing piaohao to exit the public financial sector and prioritize the fortune and prosperity of their families over those of banking firms. Furthermore, the history of Shanxi should not be narrated as a history of the obscure northern interior, but rather as correlated histories between north China and the coastal areas, interconnected through long-distance financial and commercial exchanges since the opening of treaty ports in 1842.Footnote 10\n\nConclusion\n\nThis article has explored three interrelated histories: the genealogy of how modernist financial discourse was invented, internalized, and institutionalized by participants, followers, and scholars of Shanxi piaohao from 1900 to the present; the history of how piaohao from north China managed to build an empire-wide financial network and facilitated flows of capital and goods in the nineteenth century; and family-centered capitalist and non-capitalist histories countering piaohao's unrealized path to modern banks. As family banking firms from north China, piaohao played evolving roles in accelerating inter-regional flows of capital and facilitating transactions of global commodities between the north interior and south treaty ports after the 1860s, pushing the boundaries between north and south China. This article adds new insights into our misunderstanding of the supposedly backward north Chinese interior in three aspects. First, it counters the Eurocentric linear historical view of piaohao as a failed prototype of modern banking. Second, it shows how piaohao functioned as financial intermediaries between China's northern interior and coastal areas. Third, it argues that the piaohao business had a different function in Chinese society, namely, larger goals for family prosperity in the accumulation of cultural and political capital.\n\nSuffice it to say that the empire-wide financial networks built and maintained by piaohao made north China a center of dynamic change in commerce, banking, and society during the nineteenth century. Shanxi piaohao as financial institutions and their merchant-banker families as special mercantile and social enterprises testify to the adaptability of Shanxi Province and its people, and to their flexibility and rapidity in moving toward high profit arenas, even during the nineteenth century, when new socio-economic changes gravitated towards China's south and southeast."
