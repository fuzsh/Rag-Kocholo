        "meta_description": "China’s project to create a digital currency, known as e-CNY or Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP), has come a long way, and is now probably only months away from a full-fledged country-wide launch. This would make China the first large economy equipped with a retail Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). How does the e-CNY function? What has the government done to pave the way for it? And what are the main reasons behind the push?",

        "text": "In the PBoC’s own words, \"it has been paying close attention to the implications of e-CNY for monetary system, monetary policy, financial markets, and financial stability, among others\".\n\nOne topic on which the white paper and the PBoC have not thrown much light is the system’s technical features and the technology roadmap. We know from early on that it will not at all work like bitcoin, but will rely at least partially on technologies similar to the ones used in blockchains (\"blockchain lite\", so to speak): \"The e-CNY system adopts a distributed and platform-based design, which enhances the reliance and expansibility of the system\". A major uncertainty is how the new system will handle transactions taking place with at least one party being offline. Being able to handle this type of situation is essential to the success of a digital currency but presents specific challenges, which nobody can claim to have fully solved at this point in time. It is in this context quite understandable that the PBoC does not wish to communicate too widely on this topic, if, as it is widely thought, it is far ahead of other central banks. Interestingly, we know that the PBoC takes the question of the protection of its intellectual property very seriously, having filed more than 80 patents related to the CBDC project by January 2020.\n\nOne can open as many wallets as one wishes, e-CNY can be transferred freely from one wallet to another, or between a wallet and a bank account and vice versa. Wallet users are able to enjoy services offered by third-party payment service providers, including of course Alipay and WeChat. However, Alipay and WeChat themselves cannot directly open e-CNY digital wallets, as only their affiliated banks can.\n\nIn the case of an online transaction initiated on an Alibaba platform, for instance, a wallet user can choose to pay through their standard Alipay account (as they do now in most cases), but they will also be able to do it through whatever e-CNY wallet they happen to own. In the case of a physical transaction at a store, store operators will display not only their Alipay or WeChat QR-codes at the payment point but also an e-CNY QR code, so that customers can choose whatever payment provider they wish.\n\nAn important feature is that there will be different types of wallets, depending on the type of Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process performed at the time of the opening of the wallet, and on the depth of personal information provided: the stricter the KYC (like in the case where it is done physically at a bank branch), the more features will be available, with higher daily usage limits. In the case of a simpler KYC (like when it is done online), it will still be possible to open a wallet, but with less features and lower usage limits. The simplest form of wallet will still require a user to provide a phone number, though, which in China is linked and traceable to an ID card number. This kind of multi-tiered system, linking the functionality of a bank account or a wallet to the degree of information provided by the user, is of course meant to limit risks such as money laundering. It is directly inspired from the work done by banks and regulators when trying to put in place a new frame for digital banks. At the same time, the \"loosely coupled design (松散耦合)\" of the e-CNY is also meant to expand access and ease privacy concerns, at least when it comes to low-limit wallets and small amount transactions. As of now, it seems that the simplest type of wallet available, with the lowest usage limits, requires a user to provide a mobile phone number, and not an ID card number.\n\nCopyright: ANTHONY WALLACE / AFP"
