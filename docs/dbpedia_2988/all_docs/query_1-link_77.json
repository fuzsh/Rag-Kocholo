        "text": "Stefano Pessina, the deputy chairman of Alliance Boots who is fronting a potential £9.7bn private equity bid for the health and beauty group, has been banned from the company's central London head office.\n\nMr Pessina, a billionaire who heads the newly-merged group's drugs wholesaling business and is responsible for strategy and acquisitions, has been told he can continue with his work but cannot enter the company's Sedley Place office off Oxford Street. He owns a 15% stake in the business.\n\nThe ban also applies to Mr Pessina's partner and fellow board director, Ornella Barra. Ms Barra has links to the trust that holds Mr Pessina's shares.\n\nMr Pessina, backed by private equity group KKR, tabled a £10-a-share bid for Alliance Boots this month, just seven months after he had merged his Alliance Unichem group with Boots. The Boots board rejected the bid as \"fundamentally\" undervaluing the business, but Mr Pessina and KKR are widely expected to come back with a higher offer. The chairman, Sir Nigel Rudd, has made it clear Mr Pessina and Ms Barra have been excluded from all bid discussions, but are continuing in their roles.\n\nThe unusual working arrangements for the company's most senior directors emerged as it posted a pre-close statement. However, Richard Baker, the chief executive, who Mr Pessina wants to stay in his job if his bid succeeds, said only that Mr Pessina was \"fulfilling his responsibilities\".\n\nIn its trading statement Alliance Boots said like-for-like sales were expected to be 1.6% up on last year, with margins ahead of expectations. The group also set out plans to rebrand 800 small former Alliance Unichem local chemists under a \"Your local Boots pharmacy\" fascia at a cost of £65m. There are also to be 300 job cuts at one of Boots' factories in Nottingham after the loss of a manufacturing contract.\n\nThe statement ran to six pages and included not just the usual trading update but also restated the rationale for last year's merger and gave a full update on how the merger targets were being met.Mr Baker refused to comment on the bid and denied the statement was a defence document. \"It says trading statement at the top and that is a good way to describe it,\" he said.\n\nRichard Ratner, analyst at Seymour Pierce, said he believed Mr Pessina would return with a £10.40 bid and that the Boots board would then \"roll over gracefully\".\n\nRival retailer J Sainsbury, which is also being stalked by private equity bidders, also updated the market on its fourth quarter trading. The grocer said like-for-like sales excluding fuel in the 12 weeks to March 24 were up 5.9%, ahead of analysts' expectations. Justin King, the chief executive, described trading as \"very strong\" and said high sales of Fairtrade products had helped.\n\nHe refused to comment on the potential bid, but revealed that private shareholders have been writing to him to let him know their opinions of Sainsbury's being taken out of the public arena. The grocer has 120,000 private shareholders."
