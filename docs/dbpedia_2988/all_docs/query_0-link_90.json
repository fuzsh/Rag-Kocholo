        "text": "Rein’s successor, Wasson, put the brakes on rapid store expansion but did undertake a few acquisitions, including the New York–based Duane Reade chain in 2010. He cut costs and brought in some outside talent. He also vowed to use Walgreens’ clout to stand up to pharmaceutical benefits managers (PBMs), which represent organizations whose employees purchase a lot of medications. PBMs were lowering reimbursement rates to chains.\n\nPhoto: Luke Sharrett—Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nWasson decided to take on Express Scripts, one of the largest PBMs, as his test case. He announced in 2011 that the company would stop doing business with it, believing that customers would be more loyal to their pharmacy than to a PBM.\n\nHe was wrong. Customers streamed out the door and Walgreens’ earnings plunged. Says Adam Fein of Pembroke Consulting: “They brought a knife to a gunfight. It was a massive miscalculation, and millions and millions of scripts walked out the door and never entered a Walgreens again.”\n\nWasson had previously discussed a possible Boots deal with Pessina. But suddenly overseas growth had become more of an imperative. Pessina, not surprisingly, was game. As he puts it, “We saw that we were sharing values.”\n\nStill, Walgreens was nervous about a full-on merger, so Pessina proposed a complex two-step process in which Walgreens would acquire 45% of Alliance Boots in 2012. Three years later, if both parties were satisfied, it would buy the rest.\n\nIn July 2012—weeks after the first step of the deal was announced but before it had closed—Walgreens capitulated and began working with Express Scripts again. The truce pleased investors, who boosted Walgreens’ stock 12%. The biggest beneficiaries: Pessina and KKR, who had agreed to receive a set number of shares (rather than a set dollar amount) from Walgreens.\n\nPessina out-negotiated his counterparts, say sources on both sides. Says Barclays analyst Meredith Adler: “I thought it was pretty irresponsible to negotiate when the thing was still going on. They [Walgreens] gave away a lot of stock value. I used to joke that KKR or Pessina had negotiated both sides of the transaction.” (A WBA spokesperson says the fixed number of shares “helped align both parties’ interests to maximize synergies.”) Observes Ken Murphy: “It was men against boys.”\n\nThe two companies—now engaged, with marriage looming—began to explore the practicalities of getting hitched. Teams flew back and forth between Nottingham, England—Boots’ home—and Deerfield to uncover best practices. More seemed to come from Boots than the other way around. Wasson had long wanted to improve the retail part of Walgreens stores (two-thirds of sales came from the pharmacy), and he saw Boots, which did more than half its business in retail, as the ideal laboratory. To that end, Alex Gourlay, a Boots lifer, was installed to help run Walgreens USA.\n\nPhoto:Local World/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThen a massive error tilted the balance of power even further in Boots’ direction. Walgreens had forecast that the prices of generic drugs would fall—only to realize that in fact they were rising. In the summer of 2014, the company abruptly slashed its projected 2016 profits by a third. Walgreens shares dropped 14% in a day. Says Adler: “It was a complete shocker.”\n\nPhoto: James Veysey—Camera Press/Redux\n\nThe aftermath only made Walgreens look worse. Unnamed company executives and directors were quoted in a Wall Street Journal article blaming the disaster on CFO Wade Miquelon and a second executive. A Wasson confidant who had been well regarded, Miquelon had just stepped down, in a planned retirement. He was incensed by the impression that he had resigned because of the forecasting miscue.\n\nMiquelon filed a defamation suit against Walgreens. Among his claims: that Pessina and Wasson had been aware that the company was struggling to meet its projected profits and that they had pushed Miquelon to find a way to reach the targets. (The suit is still pending, though seven of nine counts have been dismissed. Miquelon did not respond to requests for an interview.)\n\nMiquelon’s complaint included emails in which he was praised by Wasson and told he could be a CEO candidate one day, along with one from Wasson that reads, “Let’s push for a 6 somehow,” referring, Miquelon asserts, to earnings per share. After Miquelon objected, Wasson texted “No choice. Need a 6. We’ll find a way.” (Today WBA is projecting $4.30 to $4.55 in earnings per share for 2016.) In a legal filing, Walgreens argued that “there is nothing improper about a CEO asking his CFO if better results are possible, e.g., through greater cost reductions, synergies, or share buybacks.” For his part, Pessina claims ignorance. “We were not in charge,” he says. “If we had been in charge, this would not have happened, I can assure you.”\n\nWalgreens and Boots had decided to proceed with the second step and complete the merger ahead of schedule. But Wasson’s credibility took another blow when the board opted against an inversion, in which the company would have moved its headquarters to Switzerland and bolstered after-tax earnings by an estimated $600 million. The timing was lousy, coming just as inversions became a political issue, excoriated by President Obama and many others. Walgreens chairman Jim Skinner, a former CEO of McDonald’s (MCD), says the two-step deal made the maneuver vulnerable to IRS challenges.\n\nConfidence in Wasson began to wane, but as late as Nov. 24, 2014, Walgreens’ proxy stated that he would run the company when the deal was consummated at year’s end. Pessina says he wanted Wasson to be CEO of the merged company and was surprised when he decided to step down. “Six months before,” Pessina says, “I would have said that Greg would have stayed. And after, things began to be difficult. You have seen, with the team and with him, the shareholders were not happy.”\n\nThe comment is oddly elliptical and passive given that Pessina is a shareholder controlling 13% of the company’s stock, with allies KKR and activist fund JANA Partners holding sway over another 4.7% and 1.1%, respectively. “It was not us [who pressed for Wasson’s departure],” Pessina insists. “On the contrary, I tried to help Greg as much as possible.”\n\nWasson recalls it differently. “It was my decision to retire,” he says. “I really had spent some time reflecting; I had just put the biggest merger together. Now there would be another three to five years of integrating the merger. I had been CEO for six years and thought, Now’s the time.”\n\nSome of the shareholders, however, were about to be very happy indeed. When the deal was finalized, KKR cashed out a profit of $5.4 billion while still retaining a substantial stake. Pessina emerged with 141 million shares, which are now worth nearly $11.3 billion.\n\nAfter a desultory search, Pessina moved from acting to permanent CEO. He says he didn’t aspire to the job. “I’m here because I wasn’t lucky and I didn’t have someone to do this job,” he says, sounding a little put out that he has to spend time overlooking a snowy parking lot in Deerfield when he could be doing deals. “You can see where my heart is.”\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Walgreens\n\nThe senior management team is now dominated by former Boots executives. The board, too, has been restructured, with nearly half the members having been appointed by KKR, Pessina, or activist investor JANA Partners, which ended up with two seats and the right to veto a third after buying just 1% of the company. Pessina says WBA will soon have more representation from the Walgreens side. The many departures suggest that not everyone believes him.\n\nAmid all the dealmaking and drama, there is still the crushingly difficult work of integrating two enormous, unwieldy, and proud companies across sprawling geographies. The good news is that in some ways, Boots and Walgreens feel like cousins separated by an ocean. Both are venerable (Boots is 166 years old; Walgreens, 115). Both were named for founders and run by family members for decades. Both had paternalistic cultures. Most of all, both had reputations for quality, service, and trustworthiness.\n\n[fortune-brightcove videoid=4582801192001 height=”400″]\n\nYet there are also significant differences—which make some analysts wonder whether this will be the Pessina deal that finally disappoints. For starters, Boots shops feel like upscale emporiums. In Derby, 2½ hours north of London, its store resembles the ground floor of a U.S. department store. Prominent space is devoted to high-end beauty brands like Chanel and Clarins and cheaper ones like Max Factor. Advisers roam the aisles to help customers test a new lipstick or toner, especially Boots’ popular house brand, No7. In a London outpost, an adviser pulls out a spectrometer to test my skin hue, then recommends complementary makeup colors (including a “warm paprika” lipstick). A Boots store feels like a Sephora with health care attached.\n\nWalgreens stores aren’t problems per se—they’re clean and bright. The real issue is that generations of Americans have been trained to visit them for “convenience,” picking up a quart of milk and some toilet paper, or maybe a prescription, and getting in and out as fast as possible. Efficiency, rather than lingering to try, say, a luxurious beauty item, is paramount.\n\nThat seems like an obstacle—but Pessina argues it’s an opportunity. He wants to inject a little Boots into Walgreens. That mission falls to Gourlay, a coal miner’s son who started working at a Glasgow-area Boots at age 16, and oversaw the chain before being sent to Walgreens in 2013. He has the passion for stores that Pessina lacks; Gourlay has visited some 500 Walgreens. Gesturing toward a color-coded map in his office that plans out the next several years, he argues that the company is poised for success. Trials of No7 in Phoenix have given Walgreens the confidence to roll it out to 2,000 stores later this year, and Gourlay thinks such products are not out of reach for Walgreens customers. “We had to stand up on our own two feet in retail [in the U.K.],” he says, in a Scottish burr that hasn’t softened after two years in the Midwest. “We think we can do that in the U.S. We’ve been testing No7 and Soap & Glory [another brand]. It’s not overly posh. It’s mid-market. We’re offering convenience and the availability of beauty advisers. These are ‘masstige’ products, but they are characteristic of high quality.”\n\nThe Boots team is careful to sound humble. “We will never bring Boots here,” says Pessina. “We will bring the products, we will bring ideas, but not Boots.”\n\nStill, making over Walgreens will be a costly and time-intensive endeavor—one that has been tried unsuccessfully before—in an environment that offers many other options for beauty, from Sephora to Ulta to CVS. There’s also the fact that the moderate-price realm of the U.S. retail market is in serious trouble as the middle class continues to shrink. Finally, there is the specter of online retailing. Walgreens has superb retail locations. But how much does that matter when, for the first time, more Americans shopped online on 2015’s Black Friday than visited stores? (Indeed, Walgreens has fallen behind its competitors in some of its digital initiatives.)\n\nPhoto: Daily Mail/REX/Shutterstock\n\nAll this would seem like more than enough to keep Pessina occupied. But in October, he announced that Walgreens Boots Alliance was buying, for $17.2 billion, Rite Aid (or as he pronounces it, with a rolling “r” and a few extra syllables, “Rrrrrrriiiiite Aiiiiide”). The scale advantages are obvious, but the costs of executing another merger and the challenge of folding in yet another culture (and more debt) into this already unwieldy company seem daunting. Moreover, for antitrust reasons, Walgreens may be forced to sell off more stores than the 1,000 it has accounted for.\n\nAnd WBA will have to keep improving its pharmacies as the category is buffeted by massive change. Both CVS and Walgreens have struggled to contain spiraling drug costs. That’s easier for CVS to accomplish, since it owns its own PBM, Caremark.\n\nCVS and Walgreens are pursuing opposite strategies. CVS is emphasizing its pharmacies and health clinics even as Walgreens pushes consumer products. CVS has made health its unifying concept, punctuating the choice by adding “Health” to its name and making the bold decision to stop selling cigarettes. Says the CEO of another competitor, with admiration: “CVS has been really consistent and is building a brand around what it stands for.”\n\nPessina has countered with what he does best: more deals. One, with wholesaler AmerisourceBergen, has already cut drug-acquisition costs. WBA will also buy medications directly (rather than through a wholesaler) from Valeant, the once-hot, now-beleaguered drug manufacturer. If Pessina can get others to agree to such terms, he could save Walgreens billions.\n\nCan WBA thrive? It has $14.2 billion in debt and will carry as much as $31.2 billion—more than three years’ worth of Ebitda—if the Rite Aid purchase is approved. That’s a load that could constrain WBA’s ability to invest. Also, measuring success is tough at the moment. Because the companies merged and reorganized, it’s nearly impossible to compare current results with the past. Says Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research: “They don’t provide pro forma numbers. They could be down year over year.” WBA shares have performed well, suggesting that investors are giving Pessina the benefit of the doubt for now.\n\nUltimately, Pessina is focused on vertical integration. “The industry has to change,” he says. “In 10 years all of the distribution in the U.S. will have changed. We have to reduce dramatically the cost of distributing drugs and, more generally, products. We cannot sustain the explosion of the cost of health care.”\n\nPessina may well be right, but he can’t ignore the heart of retailing: the daily interaction with the customer. Says Bill Rudolphsen, the company’s CFO from 2004 to 2008: “I understand it’s the right thing to do to go global, but there’s all this other stuff. It’s so much about the culture.” He recalls sitting in the boardroom, with portraits of three generations of Walgreen family members on the wall, and feeling their eyes on him: “When I sat at one end of the table, they were all looking at me. When I sat at the other end, they were all looking at me. It was part of the culture. They were all always watching me.”\n\nPessina, unsurprisingly, feels less burdened by that legacy. “The survivors are the people who are able to change,” he says, “and we have always been at the forefront. Not always are we right. But most times we are right, and this is why we are alive.” He has won Walgreens. Rite Aid is on his plate. And Pessina will feel even more alive when he finds the next deal after that.\n\nA version of this article appears in the February 1, 2016 issue of Fortune with the headline “Pharmageddon?”"
