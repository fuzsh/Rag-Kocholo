Would you tell them what your job is or would you also tell them why you do it and how you go about it in a way that leaves them feeling inspired and curious to learn more? If you can get clear on your personal purpose and your how as well as your what, and use these things to guide your words and actions, this will help you elevate your impact and create positive change in the organisations your work for/with. Oliver Strong and I have been discussing this with members of the 30% Club Ireland this week and the conversations have been thought-provoking and energising. Personal brand is a topic that has evolved a lot over the years. Nowadays, instead of it just being about what clothes you wear and how you come across when speaking, it covers powerful things like having a strong personal purpose, being clear on your magic moves and superpowers and how to use them to best effect. It also covers things like how to use iconic actions to let people know what you stand for and how to cut through personal brand blandness on platforms like LinkedIn. Thank you to Gillian Harford for inviting us back to Ireland and to everyone who came along and made the discussions memorable. #30%clubireland #personalbranding #purpose #leadership #culture\n\nüåü Celebrating Success Harry International Private Limited üåü We're thrilled to announce an exciting milestone at Harry International!

The Association of Luxury Suite Directors is a community of premium professionals looking to learn, grow, and innovate to push the premium space forward with the ultimate goal of creating one-of-a-kind experiences for their clients and supporting their organizations with incremental revenue. Once a year the ALSD hosts a 3-day conference. The conference dates are jam-packed with content, speakers, breakout sessions, tours of venues, and industry-specific meetings. I looked forward to the conference every year, not because it would get me out of work (in MLB we were always in season during the conference), and not just because I knew I was going to have a handful of key takeaways to bring back to my team, but because the people I met at the conference became my people. These became people I knew I could reach out to when stuff got tough. I knew I could ping any one of them and say, 'Hey, this might sound crazy, but' and they wouldn't judge me. This community formed as a result of working through challenges and commiserating over things others outside of our world didn't and couldn't understand the same way. If you are a part of the Women's Rising Leadership Academy and you feel that our community has become \"your people\" please give a some love ‚ù§Ô∏è below and a repost ‚ôª if you feel so inclined.

This advice right here. This says what everything I've tried to say recently in fewer words. And it illustrates it wonderfully. This is something I have to break down to fit in my neurodivergent brain. So let's have a ride-along while my brain works out why the message is so great. To fix something, to make your dreams something real, don't make it something personal. Keep a note of it, and address it. Especially if it's coming from the people you have chosen to trust, either in the past or the present. Yes, those from the past might come up, and if they do, take their words, not their emotion. I do this constantly with my friends. If you've read my recent article you've seen me talk about a friend of mine who is critical of my comic book project, Dracini Gold. For the best reasons, mind you. If my body tries to have an emotional reaction to something she says? I take special note of it. Because an emotional reaction means one of a multitude of things, but typically they fall into three topics. Either: - It's accurate, at least in part - They're using inaccurate statement - Something about their words made you realize another truth Take a second and notice something. All of them are possible, and none of them nullify the others. That's why that part about not taking things personally is so important. When you take it personally you might get heated. It's the whole fear > anger > suffering loop. Stop at fear and don't go any further. Fear is healthy. Think about the boy who cried wolf. He wasn't scared of lying. Fear makes you think faster. It triggers that fight or flight reaction. In a debate you might have an opponent with a strong counter argument you didn't plan for. If you rush to an answer you might miss something you can latch on to. So these conversations I have with my friends? Those are even easier, as long as I don't take things personally I will actually hear the point of what they're trying to tell me. I might blow it off as something I don't need to consider, but I always think on it later. And if it isn't something I'm worried about, it's still noted, just in case it becomes true at some point. It forces you to consider contingencies. Even those which are unlikely outcomes should be considered. No matter how slightly. But usually they have a really good point. So I brainstorm how I want to address it, like I discuss in my article for making your dreams into attainable goals. It's effort, and sometimes it hurts, but that's the path you're signing up for when you chase a dream. So that's what we should focus on. Improving ourselves to match with our dreams. And the only way to do that is to accept their words and address them."
