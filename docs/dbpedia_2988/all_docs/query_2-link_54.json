        "text": "Five year skin research programme to help further develop the understanding of skin ageing.\n\nAlliance Boots and The University of Manchester announce they have renewed their partnership in order to build on the highly successful work already achieved between the two organisations. This new five year partnership, which will run until the end of 2018, aims to further investigate the mechanisms by which human skin ages and, in turn, help boost innovation within Boots product brands.\n\nThe partnership will continue to examine both the intrinsic characteristics of skin ageing and the effect the environment has in accelerating the process. Furthermore, this new programme will explore causes of accelerated skin ageing such as inflammation, as well as investigating ageing in people of different ethnicities. The programme will also focus on the testing of anti-ageing technologies, including beauty devices, to help deliver faster and higher quality outputs.\n\nThe renewal of the partnership was launched at the Manchester Museum (10 July 2014) and was attended by key representatives from both Alliance Boots and The University of Manchester. Widely recognised as world leaders in skin ageing, the research team at The University of Manchester will be led by Professor Chris Griffiths, Professor of Dermatology and Consultant Dermatologist at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust.\n\nOver the past five years, Alliance Boots and The University of Manchester have achieved a strong publication record creating two patents, 29 published academic articles showcasing new findings in high impact dermatology journals - with seven more in preparation. In addition, work has been presented at 20 international conferences. The partnership has also enabled Alliance Boots to further meet customer needs through the development of its highly regarded product brands, while ensuring a leading competitive advantage within the anti-ageing skincare category.\n\nProfessor Chris Griffiths and his team have provided strong support to the success of all generations of No7 anti-ageing serums and the No7 skincare range as a whole. The recent launch of the No7 Protect & Perfect ADVANCED Serums illustrates how insights around new ageing markers, new tools to assess technology performance and a better understanding of how existing technology works have helped to successfully evolve Boots product brands.\n\nProfessor Ornella Barra, Chief Executive, Wholesale and Brands, Alliance Boots, said: “We are extremely excited to be partnering with The University of Manchester for a further five years. It illustrates our continued commitment to investment and research in the UK, as well as our dedication to ensuring strong product innovation and scientific credentials across our brands. We have already achieved great success with the University and I believe, together, we will become a global leader in skin ageing research, which will help further drive the internationalisation of our product brands.”\n\nProfessor Dame Nancy Rothwell, President and Vice-Chancellor of The University of Manchester, said: \"This collaboration between Alliance Boots and The University of Manchester is a world-leading example of commercial and academic partners working together as one team.\"\n\nProfessor Chris Griffiths added: \"We can tell a lot about the overall health of a person from looking at their skin – this exciting new partnership will allow us to better understand how we age and why people age at different rates.\"\n\nDr Ged O’Shea, Director of Beauty Development at Boots UK, commented: “Our partnership with The University of Manchester has proven a crucial component in the continued development of Boots product brands, including our internationally acclaimed range of anti-ageing beauty serums. Our scientific credentials and capabilities are world leading and this has led us to being able to deliver strong product innovation for our customers, as well as an excellent publication record for the University.”\n\nNotes for editors\n\nImage of Professor Dame Nancy Rothwell President and Vice Chancellor of the University of Manchester with Professor Ornella Barra, Chief Executive, Wholesale and Brands, Alliance Boots available on request.\n\nDr Rachel Watson and Dr Mike Sherratt, based at The University of Manchester, and Dr Mike Bell from Boots UK will also work on the research programme.\n\nThe partnership was officially launched at Manchester Museum on 10 July 2014 and attended by Professor Dame Nancy Rothwell (President), Professor Chris Griffiths (Dermatology), Dr Rachel Watson (Dermatology), Professor Paul Townsend (Associate Dean, Business Engagement), Professor Ornella Barra (Chief Executive, Wholesale and Brands, Alliance Boots), Ken Murphy (Managing Director, Health & Beauty Brands and International, Alliance Boots), Dr Ged O’Shea (Director – Beauty Development, Boots UK) and Dr Mike Bell (Skincare Scientific Advisor, Boots UK)\n\nFor images or further information about The University of Manchester, please contact:\n\nAlison Barbuti, Media Relations Officer, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, The University of Manchester: Telephone: 07887 561 318 / Email: alison.barbuti@manchester.ac.uk\n\nFor further information about Alliance Boots/Boots UK, please contact:\n\nKatie Johnson, Alliance Boots: Telephone: 0207 980 8585 / Email: katie.johnson@allianceboots.com\n\nFiona Lakin, Boots UK: Telephone: 0115 949 3753 / Mobile: 07900 268275"
