        "text": "As Boots’ US-based parent company looks to expand into burgeoning markets in China and Europe and reshapes its American stores, CEO Stefano Pessina gives Richard Tresidder some hints about what the future holds for the Nottingham side of the business\n\nStefano Pessina relishes his job. He is chief executive of Walgreens Boots Alliance, a company he has essentially created over the years through a succession of acquisitions and mergers.\n\nThree years ago, he completed backing Boots into the new company and within weeks, he succeeded the Walgreens chief executive. WBA, a US quoted company, has a market capital of $74 billion, about £54 billion.\n\nMr Pessina, 76, a nuclear engineer by discipline, is absolutely clear where he wants to take WBA as a global healthcare and pharmacy business.\n\nMost business leaders of his age would be thinking of doing less. But there is a generation for whom business is the equivalent of the daily work-out. A colleague said: “Stefano is always thinking about tomorrow.”\n\nMr Pessina thrives on work.\n\nAt the beginning of January, he chaired the analysts’ meeting in the States to unveil the first quarter financial figures.\n\nHe knows and understands every corner of the business, answering questions with cerebral authority.\n\nEither side of him were George Fairweather, his global finance director, and Alex Gourlay, who heads up the Walgreens and Boots operations, both adding day-to-day detail.\n\nFor Mr Pessina and his long-term life partner, Ornella Barra, the office is where they are at any given time. When in London, it is in Sedley Place above Boots’ Oxford Street store, which is where we meet in a room with rooftop views of the West End.\n\nWith a business empire today stretching across the US, Europe and China, his visits to Nottingham are fewer. However, in November, Mr Pessina led the top team at the relaunch of Boots’ intu Victoria Centre store after a £4 million refurbishment.\n\nIt came only days after he had confirmed his reputation as a serious dealmaker with WBA’s acquisition of a 40 percent stake in GuoDa, China’s leading pharmacy chain, for $416 million. WBA will help shape a format compatible with the Chinese market.\n\nSaid Mr Pessina: “We have had a presence in China for around 10 years, initially through Alliance Boots, and we are excited about the opportunity to further invest in the country’s fast-growing retail pharmacy sector.”\n\nLast July, Boots pulled out of manufacturing its own products after more than 130 years, a potentially emotional decision challenging the ethos of its founder, Jesse Boot.\n\nMr Pessina had warned that he was struggling with the poor productivity of the BCM factory at Beeston, formerly Boots Contract Manufacturing, which employed about 1,000.\n\nHe ran out of patience and sold to French-owned Fareva, the high-end contract manufacturer.\n\n“Manufacturing was a big problem when I arrived in 2006,” said Mr Pessina. “We really tried to do our best not to close it down and we have invested. But we didn’t have the scale to make the factory successful.”\n\nHe added: “We have found a good solution and the right solution for BCM. Fareva is the largest contract manufacturer in Europe. It has the scale and can be more efficient and is committed to invest in Nottingham. So we hope, in the end, we have found a good solution – we are happy about that – and that people will recognise our effort.”\n\nBoots will probably intensify research and development into new products, an important part of its strategy, added Mr Pessina.\n\nA team from Boots, headed by Alex Gourlay, is leading the transformation of Walgreens’ 8,000 stores, with beauty products largely made in Nottingham playing a crucial role in drawing customers. About 2,900 are selling “enhanced” beauty ranges.\n\nStores are being reconfigured, with beauty products taking more prominent positions in the new formats.\n\nThose such as No7, Protect & Perfect and Soap & Glory have been on sale in the big cities for more than three years and are available in 4,400 Walgreens stores. Four months ago, Boots launched YourGoodSkin in the UK and US.\n\nWalgreens stores with a “beauty differentiation” are driving sales and higher retail margins.\n\n“They are very, very successful in our stores and those of our partners,” said Mr Pessina. “We are investing more and more.\n\n“This kind of investment in new products is a basic feature of what we want to do and every new product we bring to America is a success.”\n\nTo have the largest network of pharmacies in the world and one of the largest distribution businesses may be a great achievement, said Mr Pessina.\n\n“But there is a long way to go and there are many things that can be done. We are just starting in China, an enormous market with big chains, bigger than the US in the number of stores.”\n\nHe is also eagerly eyeing up continental Europe, where 100,000 pharmacies in Italy, France, Germany and Spain are dominated by independents.\n\nItaly is freeing up the market and the others are expected to follow in time, presenting “a great opportunity”.\n\nMr Pessina frankly admits that Boots UK, with 2,500 stores, is “not ready for the future”.\n\n“But we are moving in that direction. The environment is changing and we have to adapt. We probably have to accelerate the speed of transformation. We have to invest and invest wisely to succeed in the future as he have in the past.”\n\nMr Pessina hesitates to give details of online sales, saying only that the figures are “very measurable, a reasonable amount and growing”.\n\n“We have to accelerate the online journey because we are not as perfect as I would like. We have a very good logistics platform which we are working on improving. We have to develop our software and bring here in a more complete way the applications we have in the US, which are more advanced.”\n\nNevertheless, he remains confident in the future of the high street and shopping centres despite the online retail challenge.\n\n“I believe people will come back to more specialised stores.\n\n“Supermarkets will become more difficult to run. Shopping centres and malls will continue to play a role but will probably be a little less important. Online will not be the only way to shop.\n\n“Shopping centres will become a way to spend your time, they will expand over time and people will come back to the town centres.”\n\nLooking back on his acquisition of Boots in 2006 – he took it off the London Stock Exchange in 2007 – Mr Pessina says he could have moved more swiftly. He wasted no time three years ago using his clout as a major shareholder in shaping the board he wanted with a significant Boots presence.\n\nArriving at Walgreens, Mr Pessina found a company that had problems. He wanted to restore its position as the premier pharmacy chain in the US.\n\nIn the past, the Italian-born entrepreneur said that he wished he had discovered doing business in the States sooner. “You can develop quite quickly.\n\n\"People are always willing to try and test new ideas. They are very good at executing. They are very disciplined and business-wise. The market is big so that if the idea is good, it is very easy to be successful.\n\n“There is an atmosphere which is business-friendly, much more than in Europe. The UK was business-friendly a few years ago. I have the feeling it is less and less so. But it is part of a cycle, which I hope will reverse.”\n\nThe conversation comes home to Nottingham. Does the loss of BCM undermine Boots’ commitment to Nottingham and that of its US owners?\n\nMr Pessina speaks passionately. “Nottingham is the home of Boots. How could we move, even if we wanted to, which we don’t?\n\n“We couldn’t take all the people in Beeston, the organisation and move them anywhere else in the world. The commitment is to Nottingham, traditionally the home of Boots. It is so part of Nottingham and Nottingham is part of Boots. It would be impossible to separate them. To move would inflict a big wound on the company.\n\n“Without a doubt, there is a commitment to Nottingham. No one has talked differently.”\n\nBrexit vote is a \"shame\" for Britain\n\nAs an Italian and a committed Europhile, Stefano Pessina says the UK has damaged itself by voting to leave the European Union.\n\nHe said: “When I went to bed on the night of the referendum, the results were leaning towards staying in the EU.\n\n\"But when I woke up, there was a small percentage majority for Brexit. My reaction was ‘What a pity, what a shame.’ It is a missed opportunity.\n\n“I still believe it will be bad for Europe but unfortunately worse for the UK. You can already feel the effect and uncertainty.”\n\nHe continued: “At the end of the day, WBA won’t suffer a lot but people will suffer because they will pay more for all the products that are imported to the UK because of the devaluation of the pound.\n\n“The UK was doing well, the first country in Europe to come out of the financial crisis, and it now creates another obstacle, another hurdle.\n\n“We will still have to run our stores but other people with different businesses may well invest less.”\n\nMr Pessina talks about global uncertainties – limits on the freedom of commerce, moves towards more nationalistic attitudes.\n\n“They will not help the development of the world. We are in a period where we are rethinking the obvious and accepted principles of 10 years ago. It is a cycle which probably won’t be particularly favourable for business.”\n\nUnderlying the uncertainty is that people have not felt the benefits of globalisation and are unhappy, he said.\n\n“When you are unhappy, you try to react, with the consequence we have seen in parts of the world. The gap between those at the top and the middle class has become wider and wider.\n\n“In relative terms, there are people who, if not poorer, are less comfortable and feel left behind.\n\n“This has created a reaction with a desire to be more isolated. It is not a good period, at least not in the Western world.”"
