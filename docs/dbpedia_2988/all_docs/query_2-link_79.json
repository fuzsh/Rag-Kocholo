The Italian native, who also previously worked at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Merrill Lynch, left UBS after about six years to help establish Pessina’s family office.\n\nWhile at UniCredit, Spezzotti was appointed in 2007 as head of the Milan-based lender’s markets and investment-banking division. Around that time, he informed Pessina that private equity firm KKR & Co. was interested in financing what became a $22 billion take-private deal for Alliance Boots, the European drug distributor that Pessina built over decades of dealmaking.\n\nEdoardo, “a friend, came to visit me,” Pessina told Italy’s Capital magazine in a 2007 interview. “Over a coffee he tells me that KKR would be willing to support me in the acquisition.”\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nUS pharmacy giant Walgreens bought Boots Alliance in two installments, completing the deal in 2014 to form the Deerfield, Illinois-based drugstore chain where Pessina is now executive chairman after previously working as CEO. He owns about 17% of the combined company.\n\nErgeny invests in public and private equities as well as fixed income on behalf of Pessina and his 70-year-old wife, who chairs the family office and holds an executive role at Walgreens Boots Alliance. The family office doesn’t focus on any specific sector but pays attention to certain themes such as food and water, energy transition and health-care innovation, according to its website, which lists an executive team of almost a dozen people.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
