This follows the successful integration of Walgreens and Alliance Boots to create Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

In addition to her current responsibilities, Barra will supervise Global Brands, Human Resources and other business services. As a result, Ken Murphy, who becomes Executive Vice President of Walgreens Boots Alliance and Chief Commercial Officer and President of Global Brands, and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Human Resources Officer, will report to her.\n\nSeparately, Simon Roberts, Executive Vice President of Walgreens Boots Alliance and President of Boots, has decided at this time to pursue new opportunities and will leave the Company in July 2016. Elizabeth Fagan, currently Senior Vice President and MD International Retail, is appointed as Senior Vice President and Managing Director of Boots.\n\n“As we continue to work together to find simpler and more effective ways to manage our Company, I believe this is the right structure at the right time,” said Jim Skinner, Walgreens Boots Alliance Executive Chairman. “The changes announced today will allow us to further enhance operating performance, while developing our Company for the longer term. I want to congratulate Ornella and Alex on their extended responsibilities. We are very fortunate to have these two world-class corporate executives working together in a senior management team that is very well positioned to guide our businesses across the world through the changing landscape of healthcare.”\n\nStefano Pessina, Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: “Alex and Ornella will be instrumental in driving the operations of our Company in the next phase of its evolution now that our businesses have come successfully together after 18 months of integration. With the two Co-Chief Operating Officers overseeing the day-to-day activities of the Company and the continued support of George Fairweather (Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial Officer), Marco Pagni(Executive Vice President, Global Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel) and the other leaders, I will be able to further focus on driving the growth strategy and development of Walgreens Boots Alliance.” Pessina added: “I would like to warmly thank Simon for his outstanding contribution and for the key role he played at Boots during the past 13 years of his career. We wish him the very best for the future.
