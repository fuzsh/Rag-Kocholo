        "text": "Walgreens Boots Alliance has hired Roz Brewer from Starbucks as its new chief executive in a move that allows Stefano Pessian, the septuagenarian architect of the business, to move aside to become executive chairman.\n\nThe appointment will mean that the owner of Boots will be the largest company in America to be run by a black woman.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), which has more than 21,000 stores globally and employs more than 440,000 people, has suffered during the coronavirus crisis as shoppers switch to buying health and beauty products online. Its stores have remained open during lockdowns because of their pharmacies but footfall is down.\n\nMr Pessina, 79, served as chief executive for six years following the merger of Walgreens and Alliance Boots in 2014."
