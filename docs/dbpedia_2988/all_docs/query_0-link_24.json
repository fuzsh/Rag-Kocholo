Every time I take the stage at WE Day events, in front of tens of thousands of young people, to inspire them to reach for their dreams and to serve others, it is I who walks away inspired and enriched.\n\nToday’s youth are eager to change the world for the better and they are taking on huge issues like climate change, mental health and poverty. I am proud of the work we are doing with the WE organization to empower our youth to help us tackle some of society’s most challenging issues."
