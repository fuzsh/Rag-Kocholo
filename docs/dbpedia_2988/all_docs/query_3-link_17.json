        "text": "Speaking candidly, last week was filled with personal highs and lows, but an absolute bright spot was meeting our Walgreens Boots Alliance UK team members. Boots UK is thriving, and that’s because of the people behind the business. They’re showing up and making a difference in their communities, in the same way that John Boot did 175 years ago. I visited several of our Boots stores and saw the care that went into how they treated our customers. I also got to see some of the new store formats, products (shout out to No7 Beauty Company, a favorite with all three of my daughters) and health services, and wow, they’re impressive. This team continues to push boundaries, and I could not be prouder. Thank you to Sebastian James, Ornella Barra and the many, many others who showed me around. I can’t wait for the next visit. #WeAreWBA"
