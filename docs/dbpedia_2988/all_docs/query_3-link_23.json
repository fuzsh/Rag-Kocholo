        "text": "Ornella Barra is one of the few women to have made it into Britain's senior boardrooms - but her role overseeing operations in southern Europe for pharmacy group Alliance UniChem means about three quarters of her time is spent outside the UK.\n\nThe 51-year-old Italian trained as a pharmacist at Genoa University and went on to get a job at a local pharmacy. From a family of entrepreneurs, she struck a deal with her parents to buy her own pharmacy in nearby Lavagna, which grew into a thriving regional drugs distribution business.\n\nIn 1986, Ms Barra made her first modest fortune when the business was sold to Alleanza Salute Italia, a rival distributor.\n\nMs Barra joined ASI as managing director and quickly became a trusted lieutenant of Stefano Pessina, who founded the business and was conducting a spending spree across southern Europe.\n\nFollowing a string of acquisitions in France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Morocco, ASI was renamed Alliance Santé. By 1996 it had a turnover of £3.1bn, although the British group UniChem was less profitable. In 1997 the groups merged to form Alliance UniChem. Mr Pessina became deputy chairman, with Ms Barra joining the board while continuing to run operations in southern Europe.\n\nThese days, when she does visit Alliance UniChem's head office in Weybridge, Surrey, Ms Barra's main responsibilities are to oversee human resources and corporate communications.\n\nBut she has kept a surprisingly low media profile. Even in Italy, newspaper cuttings show there have been just 11 glancing mentions of her in the main financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore.\n\nAsked about her experiences as a woman in the upper echelons of corporate Britain, Ms Barra said: \"I don't have any particularly strong views about women in FTSE 100 companies. I believe that companies should focus on recruiting and developing the best people - based purely on talent, whether they are male or female.\""
