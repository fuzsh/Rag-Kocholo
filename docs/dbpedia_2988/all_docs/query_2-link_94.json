Rice - Credit Suisse\n\nMichael Cherny - Bank of America\n\nEric Percher - Nephron Research\n\nGeorge Hill - Deutsche Bank\n\nComments from Stefano Pessina, CEO:\n\n\"The pandemic has demonstrated very clearly the importance of one of our key strengths in being a convenient healthcare provider in the heart of the community. Our capabilities in this area have been significantly enhanced by the investment that we have made to date in the acceleration of our digital strategy and the expansion of our healthcare services.\"\n\n\"We have transformed the data infrastructure of our businesses and combined it with enhancement in our fulfillment capabilities. As a result, we now provide a model and flexible customer offering that is both multi-channel and a truly personalized service. Through the pandemic, we have also materially improved the capacity of our systems.\"\n\n\"Today, a sizable amount of our business is transacted digitally and fulfilled via pickup, either in store or the drive-thru via curbside collection or home delivery. In the months to come, you will hear a lot more from us about our new digitally-enabled products and services, as we continue to invest in accelerating our program to update our customer offering, infrastructure and fulfillment capacity.\"\n\n\"We also continue to look at how we best focus our associates and assets to the greatest effect. You have seen these clearly in some of our recent announcements. We have just announced a significant transaction with our longstanding partner, AmerisourceBergen, to sell them our international health distribution business, Alliance Healthcare.\"\n\n\"While Alliance Healthcare was always a very important part of our company, our focus must be on delivering against the significant opportunities we have in our retail pharmacy business. The transaction positions Alliance Healthcare as key part of ABC, a company dedicated to and focused on its area of business and its true expertise.\"\n\nComments from James Kehoe, CFO:\n\n\"We estimate a COVID-19 AOI impact of approximately $290 million to $325 million, and this was worse than the guidance range of $250 million to $300 million we provided earlier. Nevertheless, the impact was much lower than the third and fourth quarters of last year.\"\n\n\"In summary, we are actively managing the challenges and remain confident of delivering strong growth in the second-half of the fiscal year. Cash generation was strong in the quarter with free cash flow of $763 million, 13% higher than prior year. And finally, we are maintaining our full-year guidance of low single-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis.\"\n\nSource\n\nWalgreens Boot Alliance Board of Directors\n\nNAME TITLE COMPANY James Skinner Executive Chairman Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.
