        "text": "DEERFIELD, Ill., and IRVING, Texas, Nov. 30, 2021—Walgreens Boots Alliance (Nasdaq: WBA) and McKesson Corporation (NYSE: MCK) have today reached an agreement for WBA to acquire the remaining 30% share of their GEHE Pharma Handel (GEHE) and Alliance Healthcare Deutschland (AHD) joint venture. Following this transaction, WBA will become the 100% owner of the combined GEHE and Alliance Healthcare businesses in Germany.\n\nGEHE and AHD successfully combined their operations in the German pharmaceutical market on November 1, 2020.

This new, exciting step enables Walgreens Boots Alliance to further strengthen its position as a leading pharmaceutical wholesaler in Germany” said Ornella Barra, Chief Operating Officer, International, Walgreens Boots Alliance. “We thank McKesson for their partnership in forming and developing our joint venture and look forward to further improving our innovative services to manufacturers and pharmacists in Germany”.\n\nBrian Tyler, chief executive officer, McKesson: “The sale of our minority stake in the GEHE-Alliance Healthcare joint venture in Germany is part of our stated intention to exit the European market to reinvest in strategic growth opportunities elsewhere. We believe that WBA is an excellent parent company for the GEHE-Alliance Healthcare businesses in Germany and wish our colleagues all the best under their full ownership.”\n\nThe transaction is subject to standard regulatory clearance by the relevant local authorities.
