        "text": "Stefano Pessina, Executive Vice Chairman and CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance, and Ornella Barra, Executive Vice President of Walgreens Boots Alliance: partners in life and business! Stefano and Ornella are \"PrimiDieci 2016 Awardees\" and their life story and fascinating career achievements are revealed in the PrimiDieci book by author Riccardo LoFaro.\n\nPrimiDieci Society presents its outstanding awardees, influential key authorities and unintentional role models across fields from culture to science, design to business, public service to the media, the arts, entertainment and more, whose exemplary careers inspire the young generations to excellence.\n\nHere is Stefano Pessina \"Letter to the Young\", excerpt from the PrimiDieci book:\n\n“I am convinced that for the young talented and not the prospects must be the world, not the country of origin. This applies both to Italy and to other countries. And if you come from a country where being young is particularly difficult in order to be able to start a professional career the matter related to the “where” does not even arise: clearly go out and try to learn, then, if anything, you can come back. For a young man the field of observation must be the world, not the country of origin.\n\nChance and luck have a relevant importance. What counts a lot is being in the right place at the right time and understand it. Because being in the right place at the right time can also happen but the problem is to understand it. Figuring out how to handle the situation is luck. Luck is when you are in the right place at the right time and understanding it in order to make the most of the situation. Knowing how to best manage the situation depends on the personal characteristics of the individual and even here there is a certain amount of luck because it all depends on the way in which that situation is read. It often happens that you read it in a different way and the decision that follows may not be the right one, therefore it is all a matter of skill in analyzing the various factors and then arriving at the right conclusion. There is certainly a successful conclusion but finding it, understanding it depends on the personal characteristics of each individual, such as the commitment but also the strength of the desire to create, to realize.\n\nAnd if the opportunities do not come you must also look for them. You must also figure out what you want to do. I worked ten years to finalize a transaction in the US, I had contacts with many people, but it just did not happen. Then within a year or two I not only concluded that operation but I also carried out a second one. By this I mean that even if I had clear ideas, I knew exactly what I wanted to do, most probably I was not in the right place at the right time. Of course we all work in our own way and far from wanting to give great teachings, but as for me perseverance is a very personal characteristic really essential to achieve what one is aiming at. I believe knowing where I have to go is very important, as well as having a clear vision and working hard until I get there\".\n\nStefano\n\nHere is Ornella Barra\"Letter to the Young\", excerpt from the PrimiDieci book:\n\nAn open letter to young people who are starting to face the working life…\n\n\"I have always greatly appreciated the opportunity to interact with young people, and I think that the new generations inspire me to do better and more, in an innovative way. It's almost a truism, but the future is in their hands, and they are the ones who have a fresher approach, a more innovative and open vision to the world. If I had to give young people who are entering the world of work and their careers some advice, definitely I would start by suggesting them to understand quickly what their personal capacities might be, through which they can offer 'added value' to companies or to projects in which they will be involved. Young people have on their side the energy and enthusiasm required to get involved, and they must try to use them in order to understand what they really want to do, and then undertake the necessary choices to achieve the 'target' they have set with determination.\n\nToday's world is much smaller, more interconnected than in the past. Borders are probably now nonexistent, and if it was once unthinkable for a young graduate to find a job in another country, now it is almost commonplace. However, being 'world citizens' and competing with peers from other countries requires a strong amount of spirit of adaptation and will to 'evolve'. Competition will definitely be stronger of course, but I always encourage to be open to new experiences. An \"unconventional\" CV can become the mirror of an international mindset, leadership qualities that in the long term will have more value than the mere academic qualifications still important for a basic culture. If you have a clear plan in mind, the right will to take risks, the 'skills' required, the flexibility and mobility that the labor market today asks for, I believe there is no competitor that young people should be afraid of in the path to build up a successful future.\n\nFinally, I often say that a good day is a day during which I have learned something. At any age, you should never stop wanting to learn, and engaging with energy and passion!\""
