        "text": "Brussels, May 13, 2019 – The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), is one of the four organizations part of Walgreens Boots Alliance’s, Inc. (Nasdaq: WBA) Collaboration for Cancer Prevention, Research and Support, a transatlantic charitable partnership announced today. The partnership is between WBA and the EORTC, Macmillan Cancer Support and Susan G. Komen® with the aim to support people living with cancer at all moments of their journey.\n\nThe four organizations agreed to collaborate on initiatives to develop and support innovative cancer research infrastructure and to share best practices to improve patient care. WBA is committed to facilitating these collaborative efforts, supporting their success through fundraising and driving their impact through its pharmacy locations, a common touchpoint for people with cancer.\n\nOrnella Barra, WBA Co-Chief Operation Officer and the Chairman of the company’s Corporate Social Responsibility Committee, said: “As a global health and wellbeing enterprise, WBA’s purpose is to help people live healthier and happier lives, and we are committed to doing all we can to support the fight against cancer. With our global health reach and broad network of partners, we are uniquely positioned to act as convener as we bring the best minds and organizations together to fight the disease. With cancer being a leading cause of death worldwide, WBA is accelerating and facilitating support for research and prevention, as well as assistance for people living with cancer, their loved ones and caregivers.”\n\nEORTC’s Director General Dr. Denis Lacombe noted, “EORTC has long recognized that if we are to advance treatment and quality of life for cancer patients across tumor types and across countries, we need to collectively work with like-minded organizations to deliver results for our patients. Today’s announcement marks the first steps towards a holistic and dynamic approach in the fight against cancer. With decades of expertise in clinical research and strong track records in changing practice trials, EORTC is proud to share its knowledge and contribute to this partnership as the unique pan-European cancer clinical research organization working across tumors and disciplines.”"
