        "text": "Acquisition Advances Role as a Key Pillar of Pharmaceutical Innovation and Access\n\nAdjusted Diluted EPS Guidance Range Raised to $8.90 to $9.10 for Fiscal 2021\n\nConshohocken, Pa â AmerisourceBergen Corporation (NYSE: ABC) today announced the completion of its acquisition of the majority of Walgreens Boots Allianceâs Alliance Healthcare businesses for $6.275 billion in cash, subject to a customary working capital and net debt adjustment, and 2 million shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock.\n\nâWe are excited to complete the acquisition and extend a warm welcome to the talented team at Alliance Healthcare,â said Steven H. Collis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of AmerisourceBergen. âThe acquisition of Alliance Healthcare expands our reach and solutions in pharmaceutical distribution and adds to AmerisourceBergenâs breadth and depth of global manufacturer services. With Alliance Healthcare, we will advance our ability to provide innovative and global healthcare solutions and further our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.â\n\nâThis transaction provides great benefit for both companies and is a logical step following the continued success of our long-term strategic relationship,â said Ornella Barra, Chief Operating Officer, International, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. âThe Alliance Healthcare teams are joining a global pharmaceutical distribution leader and trusted partner in AmerisourceBergen, and we look forward to continuing to work together as strategic partners.â\n\nAmerisourceBergen and Walgreens Boots Alliance will also execute on the expansion and extension of commercial agreements in order to drive incremental growth and synergies.\n\nFiscal Year 2021 Expectations\n\nThe Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as certain financial information, the probable significance of which cannot be determined, is not available or cannot be reasonably estimated.\n\nFiscal Year 2021 Expectations on an Adjusted (non-GAAP) Basis\n\nAmerisourceBergen has updated its fiscal year 2021 financial guidance to reflect the expected contribution from the closing of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and the weighted average share count impact of the 2 million shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock that the Company delivered at closing of the transaction. The Company now expects:\n\nRevenue of at least $210 billion, up from revenue growth in the high-single digit percent range; and\n\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) to be in the range of $8.90 to $9.10, raised from the previous range of $8.45 to $8.60.\n\nAdditional expectations now include:\n\nWeighted average shares of at least 208 million, raised from the previous expectation of between 207 million and 208 million for the fiscal year.\n\nThe Company continues to have strong performance across its businesses and expects to update the rest of its previously announced fiscal 2021 financial guidance when it reports results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Alliance Healthcareâs results will be reported in Other for the remainder of fiscal year 2021.\n\nPlease refer to the Supplemental Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.\n\nAbout AmerisourceBergen\n\nAmerisourceBergen fosters a positive impact on the health of people and communities around the world by advancing the development and delivery of pharmaceuticals and healthcare products.

Learn more at investor.amerisourcebergen.com.\n\nSupplemental Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company uses adjusted diluted EPS. Adjusted diluted EPS should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted diluted EPS may vary from, and may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures by other companies.\n\nAdjusted diluted EPS is presented because management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate the Companyâs operating performance, to perform financial planning, and to determine incentive compensation. Therefore, the Company believes that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, investors.\n\nThe non-GAAP fiscal year 2021 guidance for adjusted diluted EPS excludes significant items that are outside the control of the Company or inherently unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature. The Company does not provide forward looking guidance on a GAAP basis for such metric because certain financial information, the probable significance of which cannot be determined, is not available and cannot be reasonably estimated.\n\nFor fiscal year 2021, adjusted diluted EPS excludes the per share impact of certain adjustments including gain from antitrust litigation settlements; LIFO expense (credit); acquisition-related intangibles amortization; and employee severance, litigation, and other; in each case net of the tax effect calculated using the applicable effective tax rate for those items. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it eliminates the per share impact of the items that are outside the control of the Company or that we consider to not be indicative of our ongoing operating performance due to their inherent unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring, or non-cash nature.\n\nAmerisourceBergen's Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nCertain of the statements contained in this press release are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Securities Exchange Act\").
