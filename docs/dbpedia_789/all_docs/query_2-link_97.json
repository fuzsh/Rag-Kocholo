        "text": "We are proud to wish audit team member Aqeel Wahid well as he heads to Malaysia to link up with the Malaysian National Cricket Team for next week’s ICC Men's 2024-25 T20 World Cup Qualifiers. Aqeel personifies dedication both on and off the field, balancing his commitment to the firm with his passion for cricket. With Aqeel’s input, the firm has been able to accommodate his tournament schedule, even during our busiest times, because we believe in backing our people to pursue their dreams. To me, this is true flexibility – Aqeel will continue to work whilst he is away, supporting both his cricket team and his HLB team. Aqeel’s journey started at the Riverton Rossmoyne Junior Cricket Club nearly 15 years ago (he even played one or two games in teams I coached!) and I'm particularly excited to see Aqeel take our support to the next level—literally! Aqeel will be sporting an HLB Mann Judd sticker on his bat during the tournament in Malaysia. It’s a small gesture that means a lot to us, symbolising the strength of our team spirit and our commitment to supporting each other's endeavours. Wishing Aqeel all the best as he represents Malaysia over the next 3 weeks – we’re proud to have HLB Mann Judd right there with him on the pitch! #togetherwemakeithappen #T20worldcupqualifiers #T20WorldCup2026\n\nFollowing on from my recent post, I’d like to highlight another wonderful benefit offered by the HLB International network: our annual secondment program. The HLB Mann Judd Perth team is thrilled to welcome Mathias Havn Sørensen (Denmark), Ryan Maddigan, CPA (USA), Sienna Richert, CPA (USA), Terese Berg (Denmark), and Sameer Uddin, CPA (USA) to Perth for the next few months to assist with our busy audit season. The secondee program provides HLB staff with the opportunity to immerse themselves in different office cultures and working environments within our global network. This not only enriches their professional experience but also allows our Perth-based team to share their expertise and learn from our international colleagues, embodying HLB International's core strategy of “Innovative People, Brighter Futures.” While there's plenty of work to be done, we also ensure there's time to enjoy the unique experiences our beautiful city has to offer – they’ve already made a trip down south to the Margaret River region! Welcome to the team. We are excited to have you with us and look forward to a productive and enjoyable time together!\n\nA week on from the HLB International Advisory-Tax-Audit conference held in the beautiful city of Prague, I’ve finally shaken off the jet lag and had some time to reflect on the conference theme of “Innovate, Collaborate, and Elevate.” While there were plenty of informative sessions and stimulating discussions among our HLB colleagues, three key takeaways stood out for me: - Are we only focusing on the ”now”, or are we actively protecting our future? - The HLB network is incredibly strong, offering many opportunities for cross-firm collaboration. - The Australasian firms (and specifically our team here in Perth) continue to excel and we more than hold our own. In addition to the conference insights, we also had the chance to immerse ourselves in the rich Czech culture and enjoy some friendly banter with the 2024 UEFA Euro semifinals in full swing. It was a jam-packed three days that left me inspired and motivated to apply these insights whilst continuing to innovate, collaborate, and elevate! #togetherwemakeithappen\n\nAs the financial year comes to a close, it's crucial to start preparing for audit season. In my recent article, I share valuable tips on ensuring your finance team is well-resourced and ready for a smooth and efficient audit process. I’m a strong believe in the 4 Ps - Preparation Prevents Poor Performance. Starting early can make all the difference and is key to a smooth and efficient audit process. Click the link below to read more about how to tackle the upcoming financial reporting season with confidence and efficiency!\n\nThank you to our incredible clients for sharing your valuable feedback with us in the Corporate & Audit Services division’s most recent Net Promoter Score survey - we're thrilled to receive your positive comments about our services once again this year. As we wrap up another audit season, a big shout out to our hardworking Audit team members for their dedication to our client’s needs. We look forward to delivering continued outstanding service throughout 2024.\n\nStill some available spaces for this timely update - Matt will delve into the cyber security landscape for small businesses in 2023 and into 2024. He will cover current risks, emerging threats, and processes that can be implemented for enhanced protection to minimise risks to your business! As always, Matt’s presentation will be non-technical and easy to understand, providing attendees with tips and guidelines on how to survive and adapt in the ever-evolving world of cyber security.\n\nI've been sharing updates on the “50K for Ray” World’s Greatest Shave campaign for quite a while now, and I promise this will be the last post, but we’ve achieved one final, huge milestone that is too massive not to share. Thanks to an incredibly generous last-minute donation, the “50K for Ray” team has done it! We've officially hit our $50,000 fundraising target for the World's Greatest Shave campaign for the Leukaemia Foundation! I’m overwhelmed by the generosity and support for this cause, which has truly been extraordinary. From the bottom of our hearts, and on behalf of the “50K for Ray” team members, THANK YOU to each and every one of you who helped make this incredible achievement possible. Pictured with me celebrating this achievement are HLB Mann Judd Managing Partner and Leukaemia Foundation Chairman Lucio Di Giallonardo and Leukaemia Foundation Community Fundraising and Growth Specialist Lauren Stacy. While this marks the end of this campaign, it's just the beginning of the positive impact we've created together for the Leukaemia Foundation and people and families impacted by blood cancer. #WorldsGreatestShave #TogetherWeMakeItHappen"
