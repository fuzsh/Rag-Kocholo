        "text": "“Maybe get a girlfriend. You’ll probably not waste time writing rubbish.” – a reader.\n\nTelford Vice / Galle\n\nIT is not done for people in my profession to admit something like this, but things that should not be said or done – and are said or done, regardless – are the central idea for this piece. So what the hell, here goes: Graeme Pollock gives me the shivers.\n\nFirst, some context. I have spent thousands of words arguing that the all-white teams of the apartheid-era who were brazenly called “South Africa” cannot be given the credit they took for granted, whatever they achieved. Similarly, the history of white first-class cricket played in the country before the advent of democracy should not be told as just another cricket story. It is not. It was part of a society that kept voting for the oppression of their compatriots.\n\nSo Graeme Pollock should leave me cold. He does, but in a way that does not square with the above. I’m never sure whether it’s his stance – legs planted like bluegums too wide apart – that does it, or the way he ducks his chin towards the bowler like a bull daring a matador with a tilt of its horns, or what looks like a laboured backlift, or the sweeping swoop of his bat like Thor’s hammer itself, or the splitting of the atom that occurs when bat meets ball, or the impossibly swift dart that the ball makes for the cover boundary, or a follow-through that always makes me think of US soldiers raising their flag at the Battle of Imajima, or the momentary suspension of gravity that occurs when all that torque is spent and the weight shifts and the front foot takes an involuntary step down the pitch. Whichever, nothing in cricket grabs my heart and holds it tight like Graeme Pollock’s cover drive.\n\nNote that I relate my wonder in the present tense. Pollock played his final Test in 1970, when I was four years old, and his last first-class match in 1987, when I was 21. But the thought of his cover drive is not a memory for me. It is a living, vivid thing, as immediate as my next breath and infinitely more invigorating.\n\nI have come to know that Pollock has had problems with alcohol – three stiff whiskeys in the dressingroom before he went out to the middle was, apparently, the dose late in his career – and that he is, as a friend put it, “on the bones of his arse” financially because of the poor business decisions he made after he retired. But he is still Graeme Pollock, and nothing can change that.\n\nSo, on those magical occasions when I enter his rarefied presence, I need to remind myself to behave. Even when we talk on the telephone, every few months or so, I feel a leap when he picks up. Only recently have I dared to stop addressing him as “Mister Pollock”. He actually asks how I am, which very nearly puts me on the floor every time. I talk to Mike Procter, Barry Richards and Peter Kirsten easily as much, perhaps more. But, sorry fellas, none of you are Mr Pollock. Hey, it’s my bubble and I’ll refuse to burst it if I don’t want to. All the political logic in the world would not make me do that.\n\nNot that I have any idea what kind of bloke Pollock really is. Would I like him if I did know? Happily, I do not want to know and I do not need to know.\n\nBut, if he was playing today, I would have no choice but to know more about Pollock than I ever wanted to because of social media. Worse, in the space of 140 drunken, racist, sexist, right wing, or otherwise bigoted characters, Pollock could have revealed something I would not have wanted to know; something that could have changed everything I felt about him. Yes, that is denial. But that is what sport is on so many levels.\n\nFor instance, had Pollock tweeted, “critics are actually like girlfriends; they never stop thinking about you”, all that stuff about bluegums, matadors, Thor’s hammer, atomic particles and whatever would have disappeared down the rabbit hole of my childhood and stayed there along with perhaps the only set of Major League baseball cards in South Africa and the T-square I made in woodwork class.\n\nAnyone who believes his “girlfriends” – plural, naturally – “never stop thinking about” him – I mean, it’s not as if women have anything else to think about apart from the man, singular, of course, in their lives – has no place in my firmament of heroes.\n\nHappily, in Pollock’s playing days twitter was what birds did and nothing else. But Rohit Sharma made that comment in an interview, and when I wrote a piece headlined “Shame on Sharma, on cricket and on us”, not many of the readers who responded could see the problem.\n\nInstead I was accused of seeking attention, of not having anything better to write about, of being peeved by a player daring to take a shot at the press, of being a patronising knight in shining armour, and of not knowing what bigotry means. “Maybe get a girlfriend,” one advised. “You’ll probably not waste time writing rubbish.”\n\nIt was as if I had insulted not a public figure but a dear friend of those who were now complaining on his behalf. In a sense, that is correct. Social media has given people like Sharma more friends than they could meet and revealed them to each other in their full, imperfect glory.\n\nThe players come off second-best because there are far fewer of them than there are fans, and the online security guard who can insulate the stars from having to deal with the great unwashed has yet to be found.\n\nBut it is from themselves that players often need the most guarding. Sharma is but one example. Kevin Pietersen is another, and easily the cricketer most endanger of self-harm-by-social-media. If he is not calling The Sun’s John Etheridge a wanker on Twitter for erroneous reporting, he is posting tasteless images of what he thinks of Dominic Cork’s opinions – a graphic representation of a woman inserting an “opinion” into her rectum as she would a suppository – or whining about his car being bumped, complete with picture, or getting into idiotic arguments with Jack Wilshere over what, exactly, constitutes being properly English, or fostering his burgeoning bromance with Piers Morgan to the point where they should be told to get a room, or at least to DM each other.\n\nAccidental media collisions with Morgan make me want to take a shower to get the smug slime off. Pietersen never used to be in quite the same gutter. He is now.\n\nAlthough he is capable of checking in with the real world – he does at least know about Gaza, for instance – too much of Pietersen’s Twitter feed is devoted to promoting himself or the products he sells, and retaliating to other famous figures as well as random strangers who dare abuse him for him to be taken seriously. This is the player, remember, who resorted to that ultimate tackiness, YouTube, to mount a fraught bid to save his test career.\n\nTawdriness is the overriding impression Pietersen gives of himself on social media. If he was not who he is, he would be just another uber-ego with nothing worthwhile to say and no-one to say it to except those who lurk one step beyond in cyberspace. But Pietersen’s supporters must be happy. Not only has the firewall that stood tall between players and their fans been torn down by the click of a mouse, those fans have discovered that their idols are just as miserable with the world as they are. Now they can all have a good moan together.\n\nPietersen does not so much cross the line on social media as snort it, and like any other addict he does not know when to stop.\n\nHis initial outrage at Etheridge writing, wrongly, on June 11 this year that he had returned the gifts he had received from the England Cricket Board for earning 100 Test caps was understandable: “LIES from @JohnSunCricket this morning! Who briefs you, John? Care to check ur facts instead of misleading the public?”\n\nEtheridge replied: “Was told categorically at Lord’s yesterday that gifts were returned an in ECB offices. Weird – will investigate. Can only apologise.”\n\nThat should have been that, but it was not. Once unleashed, there was no controlling the dogs of Twitter. Pietersen would have known that, but he should also have known better than to add his two cents’ worth to a tweet that asked, “How stupid do you feel now eh, John?” Pietersen clambered aboard the bullies’ bandwagon by retweeting that message and adding “Tell us, John?”\n\nIf that is fair, then so is a reporter asking Pietersen how stupid he feels for playing a poor stroke to give his wicket away.\n\nStill, the bratsman was not done. On July 26, more than six weeks after the story and the apology had been published, Pietersen was still at it.\n\n“@JohnSunCricket how’s your investigation going, John? Strange we haven’t heard anything from you …”\n\n“More than happy to discuss with you, Kevin,” Etheridge replied.\n\n“Your article was public, John … how about your (sic) discuss it publicly?”\n\n“I was given what I thought was categorical information which turned out to be untrue. I apologised at the time, happy to do so again.”\n\nWhatever you think of the tabloid press, it is difficult to argue with Etheridge’s submissive approach. But Pietersen found a way, with the help of a stirring on the idiot fringe: “Irrelevant. You still impacted the perception of KP to fans, you should apologise in your column #publicshame”\n\nTo which Pietersen snarled in support: “waiting, John …”\n\nPietersen would win more sympathy for being wronged in the media if he was not such a social media miscreant himself. Instead, he wants to play victim and victimiser, and on his own terms.\n\nDavid Warner, too, wanted things all his own way when he took issue, profanely, with Robert Craddock of the Brisbane Courier-Mail in May last year. Craddock’s crime? Reporting on the sordid night life and corruption connected to the Indian Premier League. Warner was not mentioned, but the article was illustrated with his photograph. You would think Warner, as an apparently upstanding Aussie, would want wrongdoing exposed. But no …\n\n“Shock me @crashcraddock1 talking shit about ipl jealous prick. Get a real job. All you do is bag people. #getalife”\n\nBy taking on Craddock, Warner also took on Craddock’s News Ltd. Colleague, Malcolm Conn, the hardest bastard in cricket writing. Conn fired back: “Cricket is a real job? Please. Most people pay to play. Million dollar cricketers milking the IPL are hardly the best judges.”\n\nOf course, Warner was not pacified: “All he [Craddock] did was talk shit about the greats now he sucks up there ass. Talk more crap why don’t you …\n\n“@malcolmconn keep writing paper talk trash for a living champ only thing you will ever do …\n\n“@malcolmconn are you still talking you old fart, no wonder know one buys your paper …”\n\nConn’s counterpunch hit hard: “You lose 4-0 in India, don’t make a run, and you want to be tickled on the tummy? Win the Ashes and get back to me …\n\n“It’s becoming increasingly obvious why Brad Haddin was brought back as vice captain. Your (sic) lengths behind in that race …”\n\nWarner copped a fine of Aus$5750 [3700 pounds] and apologised. Less than a month later, he took a swing at Joe Root in a Birmingham pub and was fined Aus$11500 [7000 pounds] and suspended. He apologised. Again.\n\nPietersen versus Etheridge differs from Warner versus Conn. For one thing, there was nothing wrong with the story that sparked such strong objection from Warner. For another, the overweening, apprehensive relationship England’s press have with the country’s players – no interview with an England player is, it seems, published without an embarrassing bow and scrape to the player’s sponsors for their “co-operation in making this piece possible” tacked onto the end – does not exist in Australia. In fact, before cricket acquired a nanny, otherwise known as a code of conduct, it was not unheard of for Aussie players and reporters to settle their differences with boxing gloves.\n\nSometimes administrators get it as wrong as the players. In August last year, Alviro Petersen, the South Africa opening batsman, threw a Twitter tantrum when ESPNCricinfo’s Firdose Moonda – who is also my wife – wrote that he did not deserve his place in the one-day team, an assertion she bolstered with facts and stats.\n\nPetersen’s response was to patronise her, calling her “dear” and offering to “do the research” for her. But things turned ugly when he retweeted one of his followers’ suggestion that Moonda should “find something else to write about, food or clothes maybe”. Soon, she was being sent videos of men beating up women.\n\nMoonda approached Cricket South Africa (CSA) with her concerns that Petersen had gone too far. They told her he was entitled to his opinion. But, two months later, when CSA were trying to suppress a story Moonda was preparing to write, they offered her a face-to-face apology from Petersen. She declined.\n\nPietersen is an exception because anyone who has a skew enough word to say about him can expect a backlash, but for the most part the social media strife that cricketers get themselves into involves the mainstream media.\n\nPlayers expect adoration from their fans, and they get it. But social media means that players, their friends, their supporters and the press share the same platforms. All of those figures are in danger of falling short of libel laws and accepted standards of decent discourse, although journalists have no excuse.\n\nWhat some players do not seem to understand is that a message tapped out on a mobile phone and unleashed on social media is revealed to the world. It is not a bit of banter between mates or a private argument – it is published for all to see, interpret and, if they want to, meet with a response. Players also do not get that they are as equal as every other citizen of the twitterverse, something they are not used to and clearly do not like.\n\nBut there is nothing they can do about it because there are no media officers hovering nearby to save players from the tougher questions they are asked, as happens at press conferences. There is also no-one to filter out their stupidities and correct their flawed language, a service most journalists render to players free of charge.\n\nThat they have done for decades probably saved players like Graeme Pollock a lot of strife. Not anymore: as of August, 2010, Pollock has been on Twitter. Yes, I do follow him. No, that does not give me the shivers.\n\nThe Nightwatchman, 2014\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to share your email address with the site owner and Mailchimp to receive marketing, updates, and other emails from the site owner.

An unflashy allrounder goes from Johannesburg to Wellington and turns into Grant Elliott. They are among a slew of examples where those came from: South Africa. Devon Conway added his name to the list this week.\n\nConway’s 200 at Lord’s made him the 111th man to reach a century on Test debut and the 12th from South Africa. Sort of. Andrew Hudson, Jacques Rudolph, Alviro Petersen, Faf du Plessis, Stiaan van Zyl and Stephen Cook know the feeling of making a hundred in their first Test. So do Kepler Wessels and Keaton Jennings.\n\nBut Wessels’ 162 at the Gabba in November 1982 was scored from under a not exactly baggy green helmet, while Jennings made his 112 at Wankhede in December 2016 wearing three lions rampant. As did Andrew Strauss for his 112 against New Zealand in May 2004 at Lord’s, Matt Prior for his unbeaten 126 against West Indies in May 2007 also at Lord’s, and Jonathan Trott for his 119 against Australia at the Oval in August 2009.\n\nConway’s headgear is black and emblazoned with a silver fern. At his high school, St John’s College in Johannesburg, it didn’t matter much on Wednesday that he does not don the protea badge. “We watched bits and pieces [on television] between classes,” Adrian Norris, the master in charge of cricket and a major influence on the player Conway has become, told Cricbuzz on Thursday. “He got to 30, and then we had load-shedding for three hours. So we kept track online from 30 until he was about 105, when we were able to watch again.”\n\nNorris’ words help explain why Conway moved from Joburg to Wellington in August 2017. South Africa’s poorly maintained infrastructure means there isn’t enough electricity to keep all of the country’s lights on all of the time. So, sporadically since January 2008 and sometimes for days and weeks on end, scheduled rolling blackouts share the darkness. Sometimes your lights are off while your friends’ kilometres away are on. Sometimes it’s the other way around. You know when you will be able to cook dinner by consulting an app — several are readily available — on your smartphone.\n\nLoad-shedding has become emblematic of a South Africa that is failing to meet the expectations of a nation that, by defeating apartheid at the ballot box in April 1994, thought its worst days were behind it. Twenty-seven years on, we know our trust was misplaced.\n\n“Devon was always the type of person who wanted trust,” Norris said. “We made sure we looked after him — we would get him something to eat, because sometimes he would skip the boarding school breakfast — and then he produced the goods and scored hundreds. He’s a very loyal person. It’s difficult to get into his trust, but once you’re in there you will be for life. He’ll do anything for you.”\n\nMaybe Conway couldn’t trust South Africa enough to want to continue to make a life and a career there. Aged 26, he sold his home, his car and much of the rest of his material possessions and, with his partner, headed for New Zealand.\n\nHe had had a solid junior career — he made two half-centuries for Gauteng’s under-13 side, a hundred for the under-15s, and two centuries and a double ton for the under-19s. He scored 13 centuries in provincial first-class cricket. But at the higher franchise level, where he played only 21 matches in more than six years, Conway never reached three figures in 36 innings. So how big a role did cricket play in his decision?\n\nIt’s a worn trope that South Africa chases away some of its best and brightest in the cause of trying to make its national teams look more like the nation they represent. Did Conway feel hard done by because he is white? “Absolutely not,” Norris said. “In all our conversations we’ve had, he has never brought that up. He and his partner just wanted a different life experience, and that’s what they’ve got.”\n\nNorris spoke of an apartment near the Wanderers, paid for by Gauteng cricket, that housed some of the province’s most promising players. Conway was among them. “In that flat lived five or six black African guys who were his mates. At times he would get picked ahead of them, and at times one of them would get picked ahead of him. I think he would have said, ‘These are my mates. How can I say I’m not getting picked because of the colour of my skin? They’re getting picked because they’re good enough.’”\n\nA less often acknowledged aspect of the race dynamic is that, were it not for South Africa’s efforts to equalise opportunities across the game, world cricket would likely never have heard of Makhaya Ntini, Hashim Amla, Vernon Philander or Kagiso Rabada. Their talent and skill was undoubted and they worked hard for the success they earned. But talent, skill and hard work aren’t enough in a society more cruelly skewed in favour of the affluent than any other. The affluent are disproportionately white.\n\nAll but one of the South Africans who have won Test caps playing for other countries have come from relatively affluent whiteness. They, or their families, have had access to means to change their realities. Those means have been purposefully denied others. At 26, Conway owned property and a car and other stuff worth buying. Millions of his comparatively less well-off compatriots, almost all of them black and brown, their prospects for a decent life stolen from them by substandard education, low level jobs — if they have work at all — and life in a tin shack — if they are not surviving on the street — have nothing to sell and no hope of starting over somewhere else. That is by design, not accident. The single exception proves the rule: Basil D’Oliveira had to rescue himself, with John Arlott’s assistance, from just such an existence to show the world how well he could play cricket. The world outside South Africa, that is.\n\nEven so, Conway is not a cookie-cutter example of privilege — he needed a bursary to gain entry to one of the country’s most elite schools. “I remember that interview,” Norris said. “I asked him why he wanted to come to St John’s, and he looked at me with those steely eyes of his and he said, ‘I want to play cricket for South Africa and I want to get good marks.’”\n\nDid it sadden Norris that New Zealand, not South Africa, is reaping the benefits of the first half of that ambition? “Kids who come through our hands, we obviously want them to represent their country of birth. But the reality of the situation is that he is representing himself and challenging himself at the highest possible level. The world has become so small. Sportsmen will go overseas because that’s where the money is.”\n\nUmpteen cricketminded reactionaries have been spewing ill-considered race politics on social media since about the time the power went out at St John’s on Wednesday. That professional sport in South Africa is too small and impoverished to contain all the talent the country produces is not a truth often aired there. Conway himself was in the same dormitory at St John’s boarding facility as Scott Spedding, who captained the first XV and went on to play 23 Tests for France, and Kenyan-born Brit Chris Froome, the four-time Tour de France champion.\n\n“We’ve got a kid at St John’s now who’s just been signed by [top French rugby club] La Rochelle,” Norris said. “And he’s black African. The professional systems overseas are just so much more established. There’s money there. You can go and play [rugby] in the third league in France and you can do very well [financially]. You can play [cricket] for a second-tier county in England and do pretty well for six or seven months of the year.”\n\nConway has raised himself above and beyond that level, but Norris said he hadn’t forgotten what mattered: “He’s very humble and calm. He never got too hard on himself at school, or too excited. He’s very balanced. Sometimes I’ll send him a message, and it comes back with, ‘Thank you, Sir.’ The ups and downs of cricket over the years have been his classroom. He’s taken all those lessons on board and he’s now producing the goods.”\n\nNot that Norris was trying to hog Conway’s limelight: “It’s madness to claim an individual.” He listed Jimmy Cook, Graham Ford, Grant Morgan as instrumental in moulding the new toast of New Zealand — the seventh man to score a double century on Test debut and the first debutant foreign opener to get to three figures on England’s seaming pitches.\n\nNorris also made a case for schools like St John’s no longer existing chiefly to prop up privilege, even if from outside their tall walls it can look like that is still their mission: “We’re here to expose kids to different aspects of life and to turn them into good human beings.”\n\nBy the look and sound of him these past two days, and quite apart from his brilliant batting, Conway would seem to have added his name to that list, too.\n\nFirst published by Cricbuzz.\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to share your email address with the site owner and Mailchimp to receive marketing, updates, and other emails from the site owner.

They just don’t talk about them. Because that involves thinking about their feelings. And cricketers, as we all know, don’t have feelings. Like fish.\n\nSo it’s been up to opponents to define teams’ cultures. Australia? Swaggering ball-tamperers who don’t always play as good a game as they talk. England? Chronic over-thinkers with a filthy habit of stealing players from other countries. India? Nouveau riche types who can’t imagine not being the most important people in the game.\n\nSouth Africa? Crippled by under-achievement, particularly in the white-ball formats. As with the examples above, that analysis is bluntly simplistic. Why they tend not to perform to their potential is a question that could keep us talking for far longer than the four days South Africa’s men’s high performance squad — including most of the 16 nationally contracted players — spent in a culture camp in Skukuza last week.\n\nThe short answer is there is so much going on off the fields that South Africa’s teams play on that it is impossible for them to keep their eye on the ball as solidly as the opposition are, comparatively, free to do.\n\nThe past weeks have been a case in point, what with several former players alleging unfair and racist treatment in hysterical tones. Perhaps that’s what happens when people who have been hard done by and not been listened to for too long finally get their chance to speak. Perhaps they are not telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Perhaps we’ll never know.\n\nWhile that has lurched on and on, Cricket South Africa (CSA) have been a burning house falling off a cliff. First there was another slew of resignations. Then an increasingly heated skirmish on Twitter between Alviro Petersen and Omphile Ramela, the president of the South African Cricketers’ Association, about the 2015 fixing scandal, in which Petersen was one of seven players banned. Eugenia Kula-Ameyaw, one of CSA’s independent directors, waded into the fray on Tuesday with: “I’m clear I serve a God of Mercy, even prison in SA is called a CORRECTIONAL services Not DESTRUCTION services. Even prison for worse criminals there is a parole. That’s my personal view.”\n\nAs chair of CSA’s transformation committee, Kula-Ameyaw has assumed for herself the loudest voice in matters of social justice. Yet she was appointed, in May, under the cloud of, as an Estate Agency Affairs Board official, allegedly misusing taxpayers’ money on a trip to Ghana in March 2018 that was worth R90,000, or USD7,600 at the prevailing exchange rate. The resultant disciplinary proceedings against her superior cost the equivalent of USD24,000.\n\nIt has emerged that one of the candidates for a position on CSA’s board at the annual meeting on September 5, Border provincial president Simphiwe Ndzundzu, is under investigation after being accused of breaking into a house and assaulting a man, his sister and his frail, elderly mother.\n\nOne of the four suits running for CSA president, Eastern Province’s Donovan May, was quoted as saying in December: “I am in full support of the board. I find nothing wrong with the board at all and I actually think that they have been doing a good job.” And that even as sponsors were demanding the resignation of the entire board. Or for president Chris Nenzani and vice-president Beresford Williams to go. Nenzani finally got the message and quit on August 15. Williams? He’s running for president, of course.\n\nA letter addressed to Williams — who is currently the acting president — his board, the presidents of the provincial affiliates and CSA’s acting chief executive, Kugandrie Govender, has called for next week’s elections to be cancelled and for an interim board to be put in place. It was written by Solomon Pango, once a board member. Among the listed supporters of the proposal were Ray Mali, a former ICC and CSA president.\n\n“We are extremely concerned about the damage that is being done to cricket through the numerous issues that seem to plague our sport,” Pango wrote. “There are so many serious issues that confront our sport at the moment that it will take extraordinary measures to save it from total collapse.”\n\nIf there is a silver lining in these billowing dark clouds, it is the hope that the forensic investigation into CSA’s suspended chief executive, Thabang Moroe, exposes enough wrongdoing by him and his cronies to spark a revolution for good. But that chance is fast receding, what with, Cricbuzz has learnt, legal opinion having been brandished at a meeting on Monday preventing, for now, the members council — which has authority over the board — being given access to the report from the investigation.\n\nWho needs a pandemic to tip the cricket industry over the edge when CSA are eminently capable of catastrophic self-harm? If you’re a player trying to make your way in this shambles what else could possibly be at the top of the agenda at a culture camp?\n\nOf course, a release on Tuesday tried to paint a more positive picture: “The camp was aimed at bringing together players as well as the coaching and support staff of the national and high performance teams to align on objectives and plot the road ahead with a new cricket season not too far from beginning. After vigorous, open and honest conversations and consultation … the squad arrived at a 100% synergised approach.”\n\nValues were identified as, “Belonging: The team needed to ensure it firmed up and left no room for misunderstanding in the inclusivity of its environment. It is a platform where everyone can be themselves and be an equal member within the team space”; “Empathy: Every team member must be able to freely share how they feel, and individuals must be willing to ‘take a walk in another member’s shoes’ and listen with the intention to understand and not respond”; and “Respect: Team members will respect themselves, they will have respect for others, for the environment and the badge. The Proteas are honoured to and responsible for representing the people of South Africa everywhere they go, both on and off the field.” The “rules of engagement” are that, “Every member of the team must be free to be themselves without fear of judgement. Everyone is of equal importance to the system.”\n\nIn an audio file, team manager Khomotso Volvo Masubelele said: “The camp demonstrated that regular conversations and prioritising the soft skills work is critical to the team as it for on-field strategies. The players have demonstrated the capacity to learn, to have hard conversations and how to prioritise and to listen to understand but not to respond.\n\n“They have learned to move away from arguing their way through conversations to feeling their way in each conversation that they have by using concepts of storytelling, guided conversation and first-person narrative. And in that way we are able to move the conversation into fertile soil in which deep reflection and action can emerge.\n\n“We went from addressing issues to engaging people, from contention to conversation, from moving against to moving with as a collective. And it highlighted the need for education. And showed us that it doesn’t matter at what level guys come into the environment, there is importance in touching base with everybody. Just to make sure the awareness is there in terms of what it means for them to be Proteas.\n\n“And highlighting the importance to listen, understand and acknowledge. That brought us to a point where we can start looking into a performance model, that the teams feels that they are part of, they own, it resonates with them, a model that can outlive them and be there for future generations of Proteas.”\n\nThere was more where that came from, all of it good, considered and constructive. And none of it will mean a thing if the culture of CSA itself isn’t remade from scratch. Already South African cricket is blighted by racists, fixers and dishonest malcontents, and we don’t know how bad the stink will get. It’s the smell of a fish rotting from the head.\n\nFirst published by Cricbuzz.\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to share your email address with the site owner and Mailchimp to receive marketing, updates, and other emails from the site owner.

But who knows what’s going to happen going forward.” – Rassie van der Dussen\n\nTELFORD VICE in Cape Town\n\nYOU look like a captain, play like a captain, talk like a captain, even walk like a captain. So how come you haven’t captained much? Our question to Rassie van der Dussen, delivered during an online interview conducted by his agent, Chris Cardoso, seemed to grip, rip and zip square past his outside edge. At least, Cricbuzz would like to think so.\n\nVan der Dussen took a moment. To think. To consider his answer. Maybe to ask himself the same thing, perhaps not for the first time.\n\n“I don’t know if I walk like a captain, but I’ll take it,” Van der Dussen said. He is among the most unvarnished of cricketers. What you see really is what you get: a splendid splinter of a player who hits the ball with visceral violence. You don’t need to see Van der Dussen play a stroke to know it’s his. You can hear his authorship. The alto gunshot crack hits you, the hearer, in the chest and leaves its mark. He is a lean machine: 1.88 metres of torque and toughness. And a straight up fella.\n\nVan der Dussen is cast from the same cultural mould as AB de Villiers and Faf du Plessis — they’re all from Pretoria — but he couldn’t be more different. Like everyone else he doesn’t have De Villiers’ outrageous talent. Unlike Du Plessis he isn’t as slick as his own hair in front of the cameras and behind the microphones. He also doesn’t have De Villiers’ apparent inability to make up his mind about whether he wants to play for South Africa. Nor is he concerned with sculpting his answers quite as immaculately as Du Plessis, who pauses his press conferences to ask the reporters in attendance if he has used the correct term. These are not criticisms: few people on earth are pestered about their plans for the future as often and as tediously as De Villiers, and you won’t find any reporters complaining about their press conference victims trying to improve their replies to questions.\n\nBut it is a joy to encounter someone whose authenticity has not faded under the multiple coats of varnish that are applied, inevitably, to cope with the level of scrutiny Van der Dussen evaded until the 2019 World Cup, where his performance — 311 runs in nine innings, three half-centuries and an average of 62.60 — was one of South Africa’s few reasons to be cheerful.\n\n“From the time I made my first-class debut at Northerns I’ve been very lucky to play under ridiculously good captains.” — Rassie van der Dussen\n\nHis apprenticeship was long, and started when he was pitched into senior club cricket while still at high school: “As a kid playing with men you learn pretty quickly, and you learn the hard lessons very quickly.” The benefit of all that early and ongoing study is a solid grip on his own game: “I would say cover drive, straight drive, on the legs, that’s where I score. Short ball I can take on. I’m not a big cutter of the ball. I don’t play late to third man. I don’t hit well over extra cover. It’s not that I can’t do it, but it’s not my plan A. I think you only get to know that when you train a lot and put yourself in difficult situations. Anyone can go and hit a thousand underarms and think they’re training well and hard. But putting the bowling machine at 145, 150 [kilometres per hour] coming straight at your head, that’s the challenge you’re going to face out there. You’ve got to train under pressure and really yourself in terms of what you can and can’t do.”\n\nVan der Dussen has played 117 first-class matches, 110 list A games and 114 senior T20s, among them 30 internationals across the formats. He is more than a dozen years past his first-class debut and two months into his 32nd year. Yet, despite all that experience, and the way he looks, plays, talks and walks — in essence, with authority — he has captained in only one first-class match and a list A game, and never in a significant T20. Why?\n\n“From the time I made my first-class debut at Northerns [on Valentines Day in 2008] I’ve been very lucky to play under ridiculously good captains. Aaron Phangiso was the captain when I made my debut and he was still captain of the Lions last season. In terms of South African captains he’s right up there with the best. Then I moved to North West [featuring in his first match for them in February 2012] and played under one of the greatest captains I’ve ever had, Brett Pelser. When I started at the Lions, Alviro Petersen was one of the great cricketing minds of the last 20 years in South Africa. And after him, another two of the great cricketing minds in South Africa, Neil McKenzie and Stephen Cook. Maybe when the time came for me to take over as captain at the Lions I started playing for the national team [regularly from January 2019], and availability played a role. You can’t have a captain who’s not there for half the games.”\n\nFair points, but it’s a surprising list of role models. Not least because your freshest memory of Petersen might be from December 2016, when he was banned for two years for his role in the fixing scandal than blighted South Africa’s domestic T20 competition the previous year. Phangiso? McKenzie? Cook? Excellent players. But, as captains, are they capable of shaping the next generation of leaders? And who, exactly, is Brett Pelser?\n\nIn 2007 Durban-born, England-based batting allrounder Pelser blagged his way onto a North West development project for nine players from England to turn out for clubs in Potchefstroom. Pelser proved such a hit with the locals that he played 153 matches for the province, captaining them 123 times. The original gig was supposed to last six months, but Pelser’s last game for North West was in January 2015.\n\n“I’d look at the way he was playing, and think, ‘I look like a tailender next to him’.” – Brett Pelser on batting with Van der Dussen.\n\nAmong the captains Van der Dussen named, Pelser had the highest winning percentage at provincial level. Only Cook has a lower losing percentage. Van der Dussen played 69 games for North West. Pelser was the captain in 56 of those matches — ample time for his approach to influence his players’ idea of good leadership. And for Pelser to be able to offer an informed view of what kind of captain Van der Dussen might make.\n\n“I think he’d be brilliant, and I don’t think not having done the job much will hinder him,” Pelser told Cricbuzz from his home in Bolton. “He does what needs doing for the team. That’s what comes first for him. He knows when to talk. And he knows when to keep quiet. He doesn’t betray his emotions, he just shuts things out and engages when he has to. He has so much maturity and an unshakeable belief in his own ability. I leant on him heavily.” Van der Dussen wasn’t always so high in Pelser’s estimation: “I was quite taken aback when I played against him. He looked really sullen and not interested. He didn’t seem to be about anything. But that’s what he does, he just zones out. That’s his greatest strength. It’s only when I played with him that I understood him better, and discovered he had a wonderful dry sense of humour.”\n\nPelser and Dussen shared four century stands for North West, two of which soared past 200. “We had some good partnerships together, and he forced me to better,” Pelser said. “I’d look at the way he was playing, and think, ‘I look like a tailender next to him’.”\n\nWhy the focus on Van der Dussen’s potential as a captain? Because of what Graeme Smith, South Africa’s director of cricket, said during an online press conference on Friday when Cricbuzz asked him who the Test team’s new leader might be: “The one definitive answer that I can give you is that it’s not going to be Quinton. I can’t tell you who it’s going to be.”\n\nDu Plessis gave up all forms of captaincy in February and Quinton de Kock has been installed as the white-ball boss. South Africa’s next Test series is in the Caribbean in July and August, so even if the rubber isn’t derailed by the coronavirus pandemic there is time to mull over the question of who might replace him. But none of the available options are a perfect fit, not that many teams have that luxury when they need a new skipper.\n\nDean Elgar has 50 games as captain to his credit, nine at the helm of South Africa A, 11 of them first-class and two of those Tests. He was also in charge at the 2006 under-19 World Cup. Elgar is four months short of two years older than Van der Dussen, and he has played 59 more Tests. Temba Bavuma, who turns 30 on May 17, has 40 Test caps. He has led teams 39 times, 23 of those occasions at first-class level, and five involving South Africa A. Aiden Markram captained South Africa all the way to triumph at the 2014 under-19 World Cup, a fact that sticks out in a cricket culture where no other team has won a global prize since Hansie Cronjé took his side all the way at the 1988 ICC Knockout Trophy — which became the Champions Trophy — in Bangladesh in October and November 1988. Markram has held the reins 50 times, including 11 of first-class stature, and seven of them with South Africa A.\n\nElgar’s elevation would reflect the importance of appointing a tough leader at a difficult stage of the team’s development. It can only help his cause that Smith and Mark Boucher are cut from the same hard, uncompromising cloth. Making Bavuma captain would satisfy a growing — and justified — push for a black leader of a team that purports to represent an overwhelmingly black nation, and in which most people who play and follow cricket are black. Of the 36 men who have led South Africa’s Test team only two, Ashwell Prince and Hashim Amla, have not been white. Markram’s age, a tender 25, allied to his playing role — of the dozen players who have captained South Africa in Tests since readmission in 1991, only Shaun Pollock, Boucher and Jacques Kallis have not been out-and-out batters — give him an edge.\n\nElgar has been part of the Test set-up since November 2012, when Smith was captain. If he wasn’t the man to succeed Smith or Amla, what makes him the preferred candidate now? That smacks of unfairness: circumstances don’t remain the same and players change accordingly. But it will be a factor.\n\nBavuma faces almost the opposite challenge: unlike Elgar he has not nailed down his place in the team, and players need a captain they can trust to do his own job properly before he tells them how to do theirs. That disregards the difficult situations Bavuma has guided South Africa through. But it is nonetheless a matter for discussion.\n\nPatchy form and injuries have stalled Markram’s progress. He broke a finger during the first Test against England at Centurion in December, and despite returning to action with the Titans near the end of February he wasn’t picked for the subsequent ODI series against Australia nor the aborted white-ball tour to India. No centuries in his last 38 completed innings for South Africa, regardless of format, helps explains his omission. Questions about his temperament were raised when he injured a wrist with a punch to what a release euphemised as “a solid object” after he made a pair in the second Test against India in Pune in October.\n\nBut Markram is a higher calibre talent than any of the other candidates, and despite having had 30 fewer innings than Bavuma and doing the toughest job, opening the batting in all his trips to the Test crease, he has scored three more centuries. That said, Bavuma has made 421 more runs than Markram even though he has been shunted up and down the order, batting in five places in the top seven including as an opener.\n\nAnd then there’s Van der Dussen and his four Test caps and a solitary first-class captaincy. But there’s more than that: burgeoning respect in the dressingroom and in the more sensible corridors of power, appreciation for his lack of flash and dash, and recognition of his bedrock confidence in doing what he does better than most. There’s also this, from Smith: “Maybe take a risk on someone, potentially, and back them, try to understand who’s got some credibility within the environment [from] a leadership perspective and respect. Coming from a person a risk was taken on, it is something that we would certainly consider.” You could say as much in these three words: Van der Dussen.\n\n“I want to be a thinking cricketer, obviously when I’m batting but also in the field — coming up with suggestions to assist the captain,” Van der Dussen said in his online interview. “Whether you’re wearing the captain’s armband or not I’ll always challenge guys to try and do that. Because you’re out there on the field for a long time, you get to study opposition players and the conditions. You can challenge yourself to think as you would if you were captain. I was really fortunate, when I made my Test debut against England, to stand at first slip alongside a guy like Faf — one of the greatest man managers and leaders South Africa has ever seen — and on the other side [of me] was the limited overs captain, ‘Quinny’. Talking to those guys, learning, discussing how plans come together, and coming up with suggestions, even if the captain uses them or not, that was a real learning curve for me.\n\n“Leadership has come naturally to me. I have done it before, I definitely can do it. Why I haven’t I’m not sure. But who knows what’s going to happen going forward.”\n\nNobody knows, thanks to the coronavirus. Just like nobody knew South Africa would take a chance on Smith until Pollock let slip the name of his successor at the press conference he gave in the wake of his sacking in March 2003. Smith didn’t do something similar on Friday — two days after Van der Dussen spoke — not least because the decision is far from taken. And because he is too canny an operator.\n\nBut you can bank on him knowing that someone who looks like a captain, plays like a captain, talks like a captain, even walks like a captain, but hasn’t captained much, could be the right man in the right place at the right time. Just like he was.\n\nFirst published by Cricbuzz."
