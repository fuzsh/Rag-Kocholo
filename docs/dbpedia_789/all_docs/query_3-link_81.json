        "text": "Footnote\n\nSir Norman Reid was director of the Tate Gallery from 1964 to 1979. The present work was originally gifted to Dame Barbara Hepworth but returned to the artist, presumably following her death in 1975. Sir Norman then gifted it to Anthony and Pat Barah Lousada following his knighthood in the 1975 Birthday Honours. Lousada was a distinguished solicitor and arts administrator who was director of trustees at the Tate between 1972-1979."
