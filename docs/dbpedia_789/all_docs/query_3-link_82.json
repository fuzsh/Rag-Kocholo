        "meta_description": "Norman Charlie Reid, aged 68, was promoted to glory on Saturday, February 25, 2012. He left us to go home and rest with his saviour following a trying battle with pulmonary fibrosis and cancer.  Dad was always tinkering, building or fixing something or driving some sort of heavy equipment. He loved to garden and he always shared his harvest with family and friends. He loved his animals, teaching his grandkids how to milk a cow. Dad was always so very patient. He loved to visit and would never hesitate to help his family, friends or neighbours.   Norm is predeceased by his parents, Wallace and Martha Reid and great nephew Norman Hill. He will be lovingly remembered by his wife Jackie; children, Corri (Rick) Sobstyl of Calgary, Chris (Chantel) Reid of Moosomin, Kevin Reid of Lampman, Kim (Dave) Kimball of Assiniboia and Katrina (Wade) Herzberg of Frobisher. He will be deeply missed by his grandkids, Sydni & Sarah (Sobstyl), Dalton, Trae, Ashton, Cutter & Callie (Reid), Krista & Dustin (Kimball), Lyndon & Drydon (Herzberg). He is also survived by his sisters, Evelyn (Jack) Hill, Eileen (Bob) Flath; brothers-in-law, Phil Boys, Robin Boys and Hart Lewis; sister-in-law Rose Marie (Bruce) James. His memory is also cherished by numerous nieces, nephews, neighbours and friends.   A celebration of Normâ€™s life will be held on Thursday, March 1, 2012 at 2:00 p.m. in the Church of God, Estevan, with Pastor Walter Engel officiating.   Flowers are gratefully declined. As an expression of sympathy, contributions to the Allan Blair Cancer Clinic, 4101 Dewdney Avenue, Regina, SK, S4T 7T1.",
