        "text": "A new dessert shop has opened in a Suffolk town centre.\n\nDaniel Norman, 35, officially welcomed customers to The Nom Shop in Mildenhall for the first time yesterday.\n\nMr Norman originally founded the independent courier service Nom Now in February which covers deliveries in the local area including Lakenheath, Red Lodge, Kentford and more.\n\nHis first store, which sits next to Boots Opticians in Mildenhall, sells a range of sweet treats such as ice cream, milkshakes and waffles.\n\nMr Norman said: “It is exciting to now be open and I definitely feel a sense of pride.\n\n“I started the delivery service which got really popular and I realised there was a shortage of desserts in the area especially after the Pancake and Waffle Shack closed.\n\n“It’s a pretty good spot in the town so hopefully people see us and want to come in.”\n\nMr Norman added that the soft serve ice cream with biscoff sauce and salted caramel is the best treat on offer.\n\nThe Nom Shop will be open seven days a week from 10am to 10pm and Mr Norman will be joined by three or four more members of staff.\n\nAlthough the store has not received its full makeover yet, it is expected that it will be finished next week."
