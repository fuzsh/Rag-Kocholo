        "text": "Comforted by the loving embrace of his family, Reid passed away peacefully in his home on April 26, 2012. Born and raised in Victoria, BC, Reid ultimately made his home in White Rock after spending twelve years in Prince George and fifteen years in Surrey where he and his beloved wife raised their two incredible sons. Reid is survived by his wife of 37 years, Diane; sons, Chris and Aaron (Stephanie D.I.L.); his treasured grandchildren, Emma (3 years) and Nathan (2 years); brothers, Greg and Larry; mother, Joy; and in-laws, George and Leora Simpson; and Paul and Alice Rush. Reid is also survived by his brothers- and sisters-in-law, Kathy (Rod), Teresa (Joe), Judy (Al), David (Lea), and Joe (Tammy). He was predeceased by his father, James, and his brother-in-law, Mark. Reid’s infectious personality and zest for life had a far-reaching impact on everyone he met. He was an exceptional man full of generosity, a vibrant enthusiasm, humility, and genuine concern for others’ wellbeing. Reid’s spirit for adventure was evident in his motto, ‘work hard, play hard’, and although his years were few, his life was most certainly lived to the fullest. Reid was devoted to the enrichment of the families at Ronald McDonald House and had been appointed to the RMH Council of Governors in 2011. In lieu of flowers, kindly direct your donations to RMH at rmhbc.ca. Services to be held at 2PM on May 5, 2012 at Port Kells Congregational Christian Church.\n\n“"
