I recall the station at Chester, with platforms black and slimey from the steam engines, and then the bus or a long walk to the school. I enjoyed art and woodwork most of all. But, I fancied science and was guided by patient and able teachers with charming nicknames ... Gomer, Spider, Jammy .... In the freezing science wing, we lit bunsen burners to ensure our survival in the mornings. In those days we sat in alphabetical order. I remember ... Aylett, Bayley, Birch ... although we have not kept in touch. I was no rower, but I took part in cross-country running, which almost brought my delicate life to a premature end. Most of all, I am grateful to King's for a serious grounding in maths and science, which is still with me to this day.\"\n\nMartin Lewis\n\nMartin Lewis attended King’s from 1983-1989 when his family moved to Cheshire from Manchester.
