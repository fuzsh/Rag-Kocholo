        "text": "A very proud day for me on Saturday and a personal post here today. As many of you are aware, the Leukaemia Foundation’s World’s Greatest Shave takes place annually in March and, this year, a few of friends and family members have banded together for a campaign we’ve titled “$50K for Ray” specifically to raise money for this cause. In 2016, my brother Ray lost his battle with Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma and would have been celebrating his 50th birthday this year, hence the campaign title “$50K for Ray”. On Saturday, with the support of HLB Mann Judd our group launched this campaign with a cricket match to celebrate his life. Our team, the BCDFC Taverners, created a commemorative playing shirt which incorporated the name and colours from Ray’s first senior football and cricket team – Whilst we didn't necessarily come out on top on the scoreboard, a great day was had by all players and spectators! A big thank you to the Darlington Social Cricket Club for hosting us. This match was the first of several planned activities to raise funds for the World’s Greatest Shave, to help prevent people dying from blood cancer and drive research to find better to diagnose and treat the disease. I am proud that HLB Mann Judd has supported the World’s Greatest Shave for nearly 20 years, and my colleagues are supporting me, my family and friends to raise $50,000 for Ray. Team HLB members will be shaving their heads for this cause in the Perth office on 17th March. If you’d like to donate to our team and help us reach our goal, you can do so at the link below (much appreciated!). In the meantime, please enjoy a few of these pics from our cricket match on Saturday. https://lnkd.in/gwWBf5zm"
