A private cremation for Peter will be held in February with the kind assistance of R. J. Bray & Son. In lieu of flowers, donations would be appreciated to either The Royal National Lifeboat Association https://rnli.org/support-us/give-money/donate-in-memory or the Marie Curie Foundation https://www.mariecurie.org.uk/donate/give-in-memory.\n\nPeter was born on March 10th 1926 and grew up in Darenth, Kent, which we believe makes him a Kentish Man rather than a Man of Kent - a fact he would remind us of over the years. Though truth be known, he was also heard to say that while he was not born in Cornwall, he got here as fast he could. Peter lived in Port Isaac for over forty years and was proud to call it home. Having served in WWII and Korea, Peter valued the contribution he made to freedom and carried that honour with him well into his nineties, continuing to carry the Royal Artillery standard for military events. He was also grateful when the Port Issac War Memorial took up its new home at 'the top end of the village' so that he could continue to lay a wreath annually on behalf of the Korean Veterans Association. At age 97 he finally admitted the hill was beginning to get 'just a little tough' - which if you know Port Isaac is something of an understatement. In addition to his military commitment, Peter was a treasure to friends and family. He never shied away from a chance to travel to loved ones in Australia, the USA, and anywhere else an adventure might await him. Preceded in death by his wife Yvonne Helen Dumain and the majority of his loved ones of his generation, Peter was truly an iconic treasure of the Bower family. He will be sadly missed but eternally loved by all his friends, children, nieces, nephews, grandchildren, great grandchildren, friends and neighbours. A celebration of his extraordinary life is being planned for the summer months.\n\nRichard Robert Dunkley (Dick)\n\nOn 7th January 2024, unexpectedly at home, Dick, aged 98 years of Rock.
