The garments sent back included the outfit that he had been wearing when he was hit. I wondered, and I wonder still, why it was thought necessary to return such relics - the tunic torn back and front by the bullet, a khaki vest dark and stiff with blood, and a pair of blood-stained breeches slit open at the top by someone obviously in a violent hurry. Those gruesome rags made me realise, as I had never realised before, all that France really meant.”\n\nMajor William Fitzgerald LEVIN (1899)\n\nWellington Mounted Rifles, New Zealand Expeditionary Force\n\nBorn 6 December 1879\n\nDied of wounds 25 December 1915, aged 36\n\nBuried at Alexandria (Chatby) Military and War Memorial Cemetery, Egypt.
