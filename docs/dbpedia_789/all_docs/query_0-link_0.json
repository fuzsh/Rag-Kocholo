        "text": "Norman Reid, who died at Cape Town in tragic circumstances in June, aged 56, played in one Test match for South Africa, against Australia at Cape Town in 1921, when he scored 11 and 6 and took two wickets. A useful allrounder for Western Province from 1920 to 1923, he gained his international cap mainly through brilliant fielding, usually at cover point. His most notable performance in first-class cricket was 81 not out for Western Province v Orange Free State in 1921-22. An Oxford Rugby Blue of 1912 and 1913, he was awarded the DSO and MC during the 1914-18 war.\n\nWisden Cricketers' Almanack"
