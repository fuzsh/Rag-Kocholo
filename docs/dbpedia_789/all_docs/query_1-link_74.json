Don and ET also clashed. eT was bad no blow wow and Barry G received the baton with distinction\n\ncamos\n\nIn reply to hubert\n\nYes the name Michael Campbell\n\nThat was Mikey Dread, Dread at the control!\n\nXDFIX\n\nThe value of radio has depreciated somewhat today!\n\nNow everybody is a radio jock or media personality - called an influencer!\n\nToday, there are twenty (20) radio stations across Jamaica.\n\njahmekyah\n\nAs a teenager my favourite radio dj was Winston Williams and Don Topping.\n\nCondolence to his family\n\nnitro\n\nListened him back in the day. Thought he had passed away years ago. Had a nice vibes.\n\nhubert\n\nIn reply to Chrissy\n\nThanks..that's how it was,nice time,those days. And to think only JBC and RJR were the\n\nonly two stations then and FM was in infancy.\n\nhubert\n\nIn reply to XDFIX\n\nWow . Twenty ??.That is progress.Back in the day there was only one..ZQI which became Radio Jamaica which added 'cable radio' called\n\nRedifusion and became RJR. It was a hard wired box with one knob ,an on/off switch.\n\nNorman Manley opened things up by establishing JBC in 1959 as the National Station more on the lines of BBC, initially.\n\nIts transmitters were also more powerful than RJR and could be heard better all over the Island .But the privately owned RJR upped the game\n\nand became the real power.\n\nOne of its big moves was to bring in a couple foreign jocks mainly from Florida..foremost of whom was Charlie Babcock( the cool dude/fool ? with the live jive'\n\nand he and another Brian ,'The Radio Lion' ushered the era of DJ's that changed the radio landscape and would later\n\ngive way to the Jamaicans we have all been mentioning including pioneers Jeff Dixon(Free I ) ,The whip and other famed Ones. It was rich entertainment in the afternoon and early evening\n\ndaily. So much good vibes and the competition was tremendous.\n\nPrior to the DJs Radio was a bit dour and for bounteous musical treat and the advent of Rock and Roll,\n\nmost Jamaicans would tune in to WINZ out of Miami and I think that is where Babcock was recruited.\n\nRJR did provide a short music treat on some afternoons with Duke Reid's label 'Treasure Isle' time a sponsored 15 minute\n\ntreat with the current and latest hits. But the advent of the DJs was a whole new ball game.\n\nRadio was king then. And searching the world by Shortwave was my hobby.And that was how I listened to cricket for the first time,by tuning in to Radio Australia\n\nfor the WI tour in 51-52. Radio was our WEB and RJR used to close down at 11 pm. It was then time for surfing the World Wide Waves for foreign stations\n\nespecially on weekends. That's how I got hooked on country music by tuning WCKY out of Cincinatti, Ohio.\n\nTwenty stations ?? Welcomed progress indeed. Advertising dollars still abounds apparently and I guess special interests have their Time now.\n\nBrerzerk\n\nIn reply to hubert\n\nBOBCOCK was a Canadian don't know where he was recruited from. My favorites were Original Free I Jeff Dixon then in 80's Winston Barnes\n\ncricketmad\n\nR.I.P Brother Winston.\n\ncricketmad\n\nIn reply to jahmekyah\n\nDon Topping \"El Numero Uno \" was a class act.He got my attention every time .\n\nJoeGrine\n\nIn reply to camos\n\nWeh Joe Grine, he can't still be at man yard this time of the day!\n\nI was WORKING\n\nhubert\n\nIn reply to Brerzerk\n\nI use to hear Babcock on WINZ. Don't know where Brian the Radio Lion came from..he was the one that committed suicide\n\nif I remember correctly ..and the circumstances are now cloudy.\n\nFree I was a boss. He was more adored my part of St. Mary.\n\nYou must have heard the about the comedy when Babcock called chinese gentleman on one of shows when he was 'giving a away some\n\nitem in promotion ? I still smile when I recall it.\n\nEnjoyable days they were.\n\ncamos\n\nIn reply to hubert There is a documentary on the start of broadcasting in Ja, it said Babcock was recruited from Canada.\n\nDrapsey\n\ncamos\n\nDrapsey\n\ncamos\n\nIn reply to Drapsey\n\nUsed to listen to the Telefunken radio with the 30 shilling battery.\n\nBerrick orange and blue! I used to wait on Roy Lawrence for sports.\n\nBrerzerk\n\nIn reply to camos\n\nMy Mom who lived in Canada as a young woman always told us Bobcock's was a Canadian accent.\n\nChrissy"
