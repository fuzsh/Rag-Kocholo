Rona kindly agreed to write an article about her university years. I remember when I asked her to do it she said I've not much to tell!\n\nRona Lochhead - The University Years ​\n\nIn 1943 having secured a place to study Modern Foreign Languages at Edinburgh University, I had applied and was successful in gaining a bursary for Masson Halls where I stayed for my University career. I majored in French and the subsidiary language was German. My honours Degree required me to spend my 3rd year in France (1945 - 46) and as there were not sufficient places for everyone, I was delighted to be offered a place as an assistant in a secondary school in Le Mans, Lycee des Jeunes Filles, Rue Berthelot. I felt I was a “rotten” Assistant. No-one suggested any training and I found it hard to get the 16/17 years olds to talk in English as I was meant to.\n\nAs Le Mans was a centre for the local rural community some of the girls boarded so I was able to have a room there. I struck up friendships with some French students from the University of Caen who were Maitresses d’internat, which meant that after attending their university classes during the day they had to supervise the girls in the evenings and slept in the dorms with them. It was a way of earning money to pay their way through university. I would eat my meals with these young women.\n\nOne of these women, Leone Cordier, became a particular friend and I spent some of my free time with Leone and her family and even met up with them for Reveillon (the traditional midnight meal on New Years Eve) in Paris where I was spending the Christmas holiday with the other 3 Edinburgh students who were also on placement ( 2 in Caen and one in Orleans). I also went to stay with them at Leone's family house at St Hilaire St Florent near Saumur.\n\nThe Cordier family were very welcoming and we became firm friends. Leone's father was an artist and I was given a lovely oil painting by him when Leone came to Dundee to visit the next summer. It still hangs on my dining room wall and is a talking point for me and the family who enjoy hearing of their mother and grandmother's adventures en France! It shows one of the chateau in the Loire and a spot where we had picnicked sitting on the sand bank in the picture. Recently Elspeth, my eldest daughter, took me back to see the house where the Cordier family had lived and in fact Leone’s sister still lived there and welcomed us in. There was lots to catch up on after 60 odd years away!\n\nI found the experience of being in France exciting and loved the new adventure. I was used to being away from home having been at boarding school before university.\n\nRationing was still in force in 1945 although the French had so little at the end of the war they seemed a little more relaxed and inventive about things than back in Scotland. I found the language development fantastic and still to this day can carry on a conversation on French. For the first month in France, as no one spoke any English, I was exhausted from listening all the time to understand. Gradually my ear became accustomed to the new language and after the first painful month I started to be able to join in the chat at the lunch table and fit in with the locals.\n\nOn returning to Edinburgh in the summer of 1946 I had to settle back into student life for my final year and found the adjustment hard. Having said that, at the end of the course in the summer of 1947 I received a 1st class class certificate allowing me to sit honours which I achieved with a 2:1 (editor’s note: which in those days was extremely hard to come by). I remember meeting one of my profs during the exam term in Princes St when I was on my way to play tennis and trying desperately to hide the racquet. To my surprise the prof said that he was delighted to see that I was fitting in some sport during my revision!\n\nI applied to the Civil Service and was offered a position in Edinburgh. I (tactfully) declined saying I had been there for the last 4 years and would prefer to work elsewhere. I was surprised when they offered me a position in London. On arriving in London I was delighted to find out that in fact I had been assigned to the Foreign Office, the Consular Department, looking after the welfare of British nationals in France. This meant daily telephone conversations with the British consulate in Paris which I just loved and found extremely interesting. I recall that one of my contacts came over to London for a holiday after I had been there for about a year. It was extraordinary to meet the face behind the voice and it seemed really odd meeting the person whom I had known only as a voice until then.\n\nInitially I stayed at the YWCA with my friend from University in Scotland, Margaret Baxter (later Hannay) who was attending secretarial college in London, where we met a couple of other girls who were looking for a flatmate. We both moved into the flat in Hampstead.\n\nWe were all young women together and as a result one, then another left to be married as in those days it was not the practice to carry on working!\n\n​After a summer holiday on the Isle of Arran in Blackwaterfoot, I kept in touch with a young Captain, Finlay Lochhead, who had also been holidaying with friends there. Romance soon blossomed and just as I was beginning to think nothing was coming of it, Finlay arrived with an engagement ring in hand! This meant an end to my career in London but a whole new beginning in Glasgow!\n\nNorman \"Tam\" MacKenzie\n\n​27th August 1935 - 17th September 2023\n\nMargaret Hazel Smith\n\n22 July 1928 – 3 July 2023\n\nHazel Smith was a remarkable lady who is fondlyrememberedby everyonewith whom she came in touch for herelegant charm,wisdom and kindness.\n\nHer occupationwas described as ‘housewife’which does scant justice toher rich and fulfilled life which encompassed a broad spectrum of interests and talents. Kindnessand compassion ran through her veins.She was alovingand devoted wifeto Jimmy, and she possessed the energy and enthusiasm togently guideher threesons down the correct path in life.\n\nHazel was the eldest of three sisters and a much younger brother. She was born in 1928 inthe family home in Camphill Avenue where they were brought up as a tight family unit and remained closest friends throughout their lives.Her early years educationwas at Hutchesons’Grammar School for Girlsin Kingarth Street and later atThe Beacon in Bridge of Allan as by then the family had moved to Dunblane.\n\nAfter leaving school, Hazeltrained as a physiotherapist and had not been working long when she was introduced by a Dunblane friend to a dashing ex Fleet Air Arm pilot James Hamilton Smith. He drove an MG TC soft top sports car, so who could refuse his charms?\n\nThey were married in 1950 and formed an enduring partnershipwhich lasted one day short of 66 years. They set up the family home in Kilmacolm, producing three boys, Graham, Iain and Gavin. Jimmy and Hazel moved to Pollokshields in 1960 to be nearer the boys’ school and Jimmy’s office in Glasgow.\n\nTheir home at 53 Hamilton Avenue was an open house to everyone - dinner guests from Jimmy’s business or their social life, where Hazel was the perfect hostess.Equallyimportantly,Hazel welcomed all of the boys’friendswhichmadethe kitchen a constant hub of youngsters, regularlyinvitingthemto stay for supper. That was Mum, warm and welcoming to all,with a bottomless coffee pot on the Raeburn and a tin of Mum’s famous flapjacks and rock buns on the kitchen table, many a happy hour was spent discussing bikes, cars and girlfriends!When her grandson, Ewan when he was servingin Afghanistan,Hazelposted a parcel of herfantastic flapjacks to remind him of home.They were laidon the table at a joint forces briefing session where the head of the British forces, Sir Nick Parker, remarked to the American General David Petraeus that they were the best he had ever tasted!\n\nThe Youth Fellowship in this church played a significant part in youthful romantic yearsof the boys, and after every Christmas watch night service, the whole of the YF descended upon the Smiths’ house for entertainment and fun. This was all part of Mum and Dad’s generous commitment to ensuring thatthis was home in every sense, where everyone was made welcome.\n\nHer sons wouldlater in life we came to realisethat underneath her elegantand charming skin was a lady ofstrength,commitment,andkindnesswhich became anexample not only to them,but also toall of her seven grandchildren.\n\nForeign holidays were never on the agenda, but Hazel was at her happiest when meeting old friends and making new ones in Kintyre,Portmahomack,Elie and Arran. Elie, especially, held fond memories in being surrounded by the seven grandchildren for three weeks in the summer.\n\nA spare bedroom in Hamilton Avenue was always available to family and friends from Kintyre visiting hospital or studying in Glasgow.Hazel would carrythe extra burdenin her strideas she was such a kind natured and capable woman.\n\nThe gardens inHamilton Avenue andfor the last 35 years, Nithsdale Road,afforded Mum an excellent opportunity to display her significant gardeningskills.\n\nAlthough Hazel was never a crack golfer, she was very keen, and became Captain of Caldwell Ladies Sectionand later playedatThe Ladies Golf Club,Troon.\n\nHazel and Jimmy were very keen Scottish country dancers not only at Kelvinbridge in the 60’s but also later at New Kilpatrick in Bearsden.\n\nHazel was never an artist, but she did have very good artistic flair and this showed in her skill with cross stitching and quilting and many a crossstitch sampler is hanging on the wall. The centenary of this very church being one.Hazelmademany lasting friendshipsin Pollokshields, none more so than with Brian and Christine Lockhart for whom she would babysit without hesitation. Their girls, Heather and Abby owe their knitting skills of today totheir babysitting teacher,‘Auntie’ Hazel! Post Sunday servicenibbles, drinks and a chat were a feature with the Grants and the Wallaces.\n\nSherbrooke Mosspark played a large part in Hazel’s life, having been a member for over 60 years. She participatedin all manner of activities in the Sherbrooke family, none more so thanbeing a much valued member of the Flower Committeefor over 30 years.\n\nAlthough Jimmy was heavily involved at GlasgowAccies withRugby in the winter and cricket in the summer, it is easy to forget that Hazel was there too, making andhelping serve teas for a couple of decades. She enjoyed much adulation from the players.\n\nKnowing Hazelwas a privilege and the family received manytestimonies about how much she touched the hearts of everyone with whom she come into contact. She was an example to us all in elegance, fortitude and kindness and will be greatlymissed within the Sherbrooke Mosspark family and by everyone who knew her.\n\n​Gavin Smith\n\nRev. Douglas Clark 13th August 1946 - 14th July 2023\n\nSusan Ross 23rd April 1948 - 15th June 2023\n\nSusan will be remembered for her cheery smile and ready laughter. Frank, her husband, and her son, Fraser, and his wife Sinead, were her mainstay. She loved them dearly and enjoyed being a grandmother to Erin. She liked the simple things of life and enjoyed spending time with her granddaughter. She took great pleasure over the years watching Erin growing into a young woman.\n\nShe loved the church in equal measure. She became an elder in Mosspark church and was involved in many aspects of church life. She was active in the Corkerhill Sunday School, and when her son Fraser joined the Anchor boys, Susan also joined and became an officer.\n\nCoffee mornings wouldn’t be coffee mornings without Susan’s own special brew. She was famous for her coffee. It was one of her many talents, including being an excellent baker. She enjoyed travelling and visited many countries including Australia, Turkey and Spain. Her favourite holiday destination was La Carihuela on the Costa Del Sol.\n\nEvery summer Susan and Christine Higgison would spend a week at Liz Tytler’s caravan, a special friendship which lasted over thirty years. The trio also enjoyed going to Oran Mohr for a pie and a pint. They loved the laughter and cheery atmosphere there.\n\nSusan was also a valued member of the Thursday Group, a women's group in Mosspark Church. She was a capable, practical lady who could turn her hand to knitting and DIY. She was also a good counselor giving family and friends advice. And when her friends were in need she was helpful and kind.\n\nCupid aimed his arrow at Susan and Frank whilst waiting at the 59 bus stop at Dumbreck Road. They soon realised they had a lot in common, fell in love and shortly afterwards they married on the 10th October 2003.\n\nEveryone who knew her will have their own treasured memories. She lived life to the full.\n\nFrom a dear friend.\n\nCameron Aitken 10th November 1954 - 17th June 2023\n\nBill Duff:​\n\nIt is with sadness that we intimate the funeral arrangements for Bill Duff, one of our elders. Bill passed away peacefully on the 16th November and his funeral service will take place this Thursday, 8th December, with a committal at 1.30pm at Linn Cemetery followed by a celebration of his life here in the church at 2.15pm.\n\nMaggie Martin 28th February 1942 - 17th September 2022\n\nJohn W. Turner 30th May 1932 - 29th August 2022\n\nYvette McArthur 3rd February 1950 - 7th July 2022\n\nAs Claire and Graeme said in their eulogy to their Mum, perhaps the best way to describe Yvette is in the words of our friends and family in the past few weeks: “she always made me laugh”; “she had a twinkle in her eye”; “she always made me feel good”; “there was only one Yvette”; “she was fun and fearless (sky diving and paragliding)”; “she came out with some absolute clangers!”.\n\nClaire, Graeme and I would like to thank our friends and family for the kindness and support you have shown to us all before and since Yvette passed. We miss her every day.\n\nMay McDonald 30th June 1930 - 16th July 2022\n\nShe loved attending the Thursday group where she didn’t mind putting her talents like making ginger wine for communion and other “medicinal uses”,to sending out birthday cards to individual members of the group. She also loved the yearly visit to Haggs Castle golf club to mark the end of another year.\n\nShe was very supportive of the union between Mosspark and Sherbrooke and looked forward to making new friends.\n\n​\n\nDuring her illness she kept in touch with Brenda, family and friends and never lost her sense of fun and fellowship. Anne recalls her last conversation with May was full of laugher about memories of days gone by.\n\n​ A life well lived.\n\nFriday 14/1/22\n\n​It is with great sadness we have to inform you of the death of Iain Reid, formerly of 16 Terregles Ave.\n\nHis daughter has contacted us to say his funeral will be held Thursday 20th January 2022 @ 10.30am , The Hurlet crematorium, Glasgow Road, G53 , for those who wish to attend.\n\nMary MacDonald 15/7/1926 - 19/10/2021\n\nA Tribute to Mary MacDonald 1926 – 2021\n\nMary was born on St. Swithin’s Day in 1926. She was baptised in St. Gilbert’s Church which is now Sherbrooke Mosspark Parish Church. Living in Dumbreck and Mosspark for most of her life she worshipped regularly until ill health prevented her from attending in the last few years.\n\nShe was always one of the first to put her name down for our social events and enjoyed our monthly Soup and Chats.\n\nWith her long-time friend and erstwhile colleague Judy, she would visit Jura and Oban every year, and also travelled to Canada where her brother John, nephew Donald, and niece Fiona live. John continued the family tradition of seafaring.\n\nMary was a lovely lady who was especially respected by staff and students alike at Glasgow Dental hospital and School, where she was administrator and secretary to 4 successive Deans over 36 years, before retiring in 1986.\n\nHere are a couple of memories which have been received.\n\nAlasdair Gillies, a retired dentist and professional Gaelic singer, described Mary as the friendly and ever-supportive face between anxious and nervous students [and staff] and the forbidding Dean’s office. She had a dignified efficiency at all times, and is remembered with great fondness.\n\nOur own Dr Andy Hadden remembers when Mary was an intermediary on one particular occasion. “As then student president, I was ‘invited’ to meet an irate Dean, Professor White, who had received a complaint from a property owner on the other side of the GDH. It was claimed dental students had been throwing snowballs from GDH car park into his first floor windows. While waiting to be called to his office I explained to Miss MacDonald that some people had been seen in the car park at lunchtime, and suggested they were possibly students from the Art School. She then had a word with Prof White, and I don’t know exactly what she said, but when I went in he was delighted to hear that GDH students were not responsible, and he would advise the complainant accordingly. Saved me from arguing the case. She was a very helpful lady.”\n\nOur sympathy goes out to her family and friends.\n\nA note from Brenda Duthie\n\nWe bought our house in Hamilton Avenue from Elora and Ronald. One of the things we decided while house hunting had been that if the seller mentioned they had a good church, that was a sign.\n\nWe had been looking for a house for weeks, travelling up from England every weekend and with no luck. Imagine our joy, as Elora gave us a tour of the house when she said ‘We do have the most wonderful church and Minister within walking distance’!!! Brilliant!\n\nJust like her too she phoned days before we signed the missives to say that the Minister, John Campbell, had just put in his notice. Did we still want to buy the house she asked? How brave of her to ask. Of course, we did and we have loved every minute living in Pollokshields.\n\nWith the house came a fortnightly coffee group, made up of neighbours, and Elora took me along the first time. There I met my future friends and encouragers. They were at the stage of sons and daughters getting married while I had one daughter in Primary and one in Secondary school. They were a super group. No gossiping, just there for each other.\n\nElora was a very wise counsellor with a great capacity for kindness – and a truly wonderful baker! She also had a wonderful sense of humour which stayed with her right to the end. A dear friend who added to my life. I miss her but I know she will now be laughing with Ronald and God will be saying ‘Well done, my good and faithful servant!’ She is home.\n\nMonday 28/6/21\n\n​\n\nJohn meant a lot to us all in Mosspark as he was our locum minister for almost eight years and a very good friend to everyone.\n\n​Christine Macmillan\n\nIt is with sadness we announce the passing of Scott Manson’s father Colin. Although not a member of our Kirk he was a man of faith and we are thinking of the Manson family at this time.\n\nI remember often phoning Nan , our Women’s Guild pianist , to ask her to play a hymn at our meeting. Each time I called Ian answered the phone and no matter which hymn I had chosen he used to say ‘Morning has Broken ...’ is a beautiful hymn, so we often had that hymn!!!\n\nI had never really thought about it as one of my favourites but listening to Ian describing the joy of it certainly changed my mind.\n\nHe always through the years asked how Abbey and Jenny were getting on and always expressed great joy at all the different stages in their lives - university, getting married, the birth of their children.\n\nBeing frail latterly he didn’t make it to church often but the last time I saw him in the church he said how sorry he was to hear about the death of Abbey’s husband.\n\nHe cared. He cared deeply for everyone. A man with a great depth of humanity. It was a joy and privilege to know him - and I will always remember him when I hear the hymn ‘Morning has broken ...’\n\nBrenda\n\nWe can’t think of Messy Church but think of Marie Baird and it would seem right at this point to say how much we will miss her from our team. Marie was such a stalwart, one of our three cooks, and nothing was too much trouble for her. Marie sailed in from work, rolled her sleeves up, put on a pinny and gaily set to work in the kitchen, helping provide a wonderful meal for all who came. Invariably after everything was washed up and put away she would then be rushing onto Zumba, Keep fit or some other class. Marie was all go and all smiles. We will all miss her so much. Marie was faith in action and a wonderful role model. For her no more dashing about, God has one more angel in Heaven.\n\nBrenda & John 22/4/21\n\nMarguerite was a very fine lady, a devout Christian and a proud Mum and Grandmother. She was also my prayer partner throughout the last thirty years. Even in the last few years she would remember and ask about my girls and their families and we would pray together.\n\nBorn in Switzerland, though living in Scotland the greater part of her life, she never lost her clipped , endearing accent.\n\nMarguerite was a very ‘hands on’ member of the congregation. A very keen and excellent baker she was happy to help throughout the years when cakes or biscuits were required plus Marguerite was a very talented flower arranger. Many of us will have memories of her designing and completing beautiful large pedestals for special services. She took photographs of many of her arrangements and kept albums of them, some of which she passed to Hazel Hill when she moved to her Care Home.\n\nLatterly she was challenged with poor hearing and poor eyesight and she found life difficult. It must have been especially so during lockdown. Annmarie and Mark , through the years, were always there for her and I am sure Marguerite would have been delighted to hear of the birth of her grandson last year. Annmarie did a wonderful job visiting her this past year – calling through her window of her Care Home , trying to be heard. Phoning was also difficult. The good news is that Annmarie spoke to her Mum on the phone the week before she died and they had a really good conversation.\n\nMarguerite found the last few years very difficult, mainly because she felt useless, but she was at peace with God, impatient for the call. He will be saying indeed, ‘Well done, my good and faithful servant.’\n\nBrenda Duthie\n\n19/5/20\n\n​\n\nTom conducted the funeral of Joan - a dear friend and a regular member of our congregation.\n\nJoan had lived in Dalziel then moved into a Nursing Home earlier in the year.\n\nJoan succumbed to the Coronovirus but died peacefully, lovingly looked after by the staff and having been able to see her family.\n\nBrenda Duthie"
