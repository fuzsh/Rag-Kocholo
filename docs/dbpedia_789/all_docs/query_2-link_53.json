        "text": "Norman Mann is an alumnus and a Weequahic High School Football Hall of Famer and is widely respected within the community. Norman is the CEO of G Mann Productions and is bandleader of the popular band Norman Mann and Rafiki, which you can read more about here: Jazz973 Swinging Hard with Norman Mann and Rafiki at Clements Place Jazz for Rutgers Institute of Jazz Studies. He has produced numerous jazz shows in many of the Tri-State area jazz clubs mentioned above. You may remember Norman who, along with Greg Salandis, managed the very popular jazz program at Skippers Plane Street Pub back in November 2007. Well, he's continuing the mission and his newest venture is producing Friday Night Jazz events at the Cricket Club Entertainment Complex.\n\nJazz Program\n\nSomeone who recently attended a Friday Night Jazz session at the Cricket Club summed up their experience as this:\n\n\"Venturing out on a 10 degree wind chill night in January as a musician for a jam, or just as a fan, lacks the common sense that God gave a goat. But once you arrive and that music hits you, there is nothing better.\"\n\n— A Jazz Fan\n\nIt should be evident from listening that the musicians and the folks in attendance truly enjoy the jazz on any given Friday Night at the Cricket Club. The atmosphere is warm, inviting and laid back. The good part is you can be up close and personal with some really great jazz performances.\n\nService — Food — Drinks\n\nThe Cricket Entertainment Complex Service has timely service considering every industry is having issues securing resources. When I was there, the wait staff were very helpful and kept us informed on the progress of our order and our meals arrived in an appropriate time frame. Concerning food presentation, I'm not a fan of styrofoam containers, however I am told that in this world of a COVID pandemic, it is a safer, contactless way to serve food. The good part is the food was prepared well, hot and very tasty, and I would definitely order again. Drink prices were not overinflated and were actually very affordable.\n\nEnvironment — Attendees\n\nAs you will see when you listen in, depending on the fans of that night’s performers along with the neighborhood regulars in attendance and the type of music, you can have a very engaging talkative crowd enjoying themselves and the music, and/or you may experience a listening crowd. The Cricket Club has both because when the jazz starts swinging and the audience gets involved, everybody starts having fun.\n\nParking\n\nThe other thing I should mention is that the Cricket Club has an awesome, large, one-level, fenced-in attached outdoor parking lot with plenty of space.\n\nThey came back together again, live at the Rutgers Institute of Jazz Studies’ Clements Place Jazz in Newark, NJ. They all got together and produced a truly awesome live music concert. The band configuration was Norman Mann on Percussion, vocals, Gene Ghee on Sax, Peter Lin on Trombone, Joy Topping Mann (aka Ife Basim) on Vocals, Christopher Dean Sullivan on Bass, Sir G. Earl Grice on Drums, Tomoko Ohno on Piano.\n\nAs you can see and hear, Norman Mann curates a stellar list of musicians that perform some incredible sets. Part of this may be hinted at in the band name Rafiki. Norman has been quoted as saying, \"Rafiki is a Swahili word that translates to English as ‘friend.’” So now, let's meet the friends in the band.\n\nNorman, along with Greg Salandis, are widely known for their past partnership at Skippers Plane Street Pub in November 2007. Skippers was a very popular spot in Newark located on University Ave and was a welcomed addition to Newark's nightlife. It was a place where music, food, drink, and conversation were the rage and occurred in a comfortable, friendly environment. Skippers featured many of the Tri-State’s musicians and singers. Norman Mann, as a musician, plays congas, percussion and also sings. He has appeared with drummers Greg Buford, Alvester Garnett, and singers Ty Stephens, Joy Topping Mann, Tomoko Ohno, and Dwight West along with one of Jersey's top organists and keyboardists, Mel Davis, to name a few.\n\nNorman and his bands have performed in numerous venues around Northern New Jersey such as Montclair’s Trumpets Jazz Club, Newark’s Priory Jazz Club, City of Orange’s Mr. Jays, Jazz In Spiotta Park and Jazz On Sloan in South Orange, NJ. Norman is the CEO of G Mann Productions, has produced jazz shows at many of the Tri-State area clubs and lately has been producing events in Irvington’s Cricket Club.\n\nFollowing are the bios of some truly cool members of the band.\n\nTomoko Ohno, born in Tokyo, began piano studies at the age of 4. As a teenager, she began playing professionally in the Tokyo area jazz scene. After graduating from Rikkyo University in Law and Politics, Miss Ohno moved to the United States and entered the Jazz Studies Program at William Paterson University in New Jersey, where she studied with Harold Mabern and Rufus Reid. During this time she had the opportunity to perform with such artists as Jerome Richardson, Wynton Marsalis, Benny Golson and Joe Henderson. A recipient of the Student Award of Outstanding Performance and a member of the Dean’s List, Miss Ohno graduated with a B.A. in Jazz Studies.\n\nShe has performed at Lincoln Center, Weill Recital, Carnegie Hall, The Blue Note, Birdland , in addition to appearing on live radio broadcasts by WBGO and WNYC, and ABC TV's Good Morning America. She has performed and/or recorded with Slide Hampton, Claudio Roditi, James Spaulding, Rufus Reid, The John Lee Quartet, The Dizzy Gillespie Alumni Big Band and Sherry Maricle and the Diva Jazz Orchestra, as well as working as a side musician with such diverse musical ensembles as the Harlem Spiritual Ensemble and The Spirit of Life Ensemble.\n\nMiss Ohno also leads her own group, and has released three CDs on the Japan-based Tokuma label. In 1997 her first album, “Powder Blue” was released, and in 1999 her second album, “Affirmation” was released, followed in 2000 by the album \"Natural Woman.\" Her album \"Shadows of Spring\" (recorded in Argentina) was released by MDR Records in 2005. \"Tomoko Ohno in Buenos Aires\" was also released by MDR Records in 2007. The duet album with legendary Argentine guitarist Ricardo Lew \" From Tokyo to Buenos Aires \" was released in spring 2011. The duo added the cellist Nestor Tedesco from Teatro Colon and released the Tango/Jazz album \" Tres Sabores \" in 2016.\n\nhttp://www.tomokoohno.com\n\nGene Ghee - (saxophone, flute, clarinet) is a long-time performer and educator. He graduated from NYU with a music education undergrad degree, from the Manhattan School of Music with an MA for music performance and from Columbia University Teachers College with a Master of Education degree. He has appeared as a sideman with an array of performers from Art Blakey to Stevie Wonder and is also a recipient of the Daily News Music Teacher Recognition Award.\n\nGene Ghee is a highly in-demand saxophonist and has performed with numerous professionals such as Art Blakey Jr., Brother Jack McDuff, Jimmy McGriff, Teddy Pendergrass, Anita Baker, B.T.Express, Arthur Prysock, Little Anthony and The Imperials. Add to that Etta Jones, Bernard “Pretty” Purdie, Benny Powell, Eddie Palmieri, Machito, and Barry Harris plus the list goes on. He's a performer on recordings of Stevie Wonder (Do I Do), played tenor saxophone and contracted the horn section for the session which included Frank Wess, Virgil Jones, Ron Tooley, Britt Woodman, Clifton Anderson, Victor Paz and others. Recordings / performances with the likes of Evelyn “Champagne” King, The Village People, Candi Staton. T.S.Monk plus many more national and international performers.\n\nJoy Topping Mann (aka Ife Basim) - In her early days as a Contemporary Christian artist, songwriter and arranger, Joy Topping-Mann co-produced three CD projects of original music which she performed nationally and internationally with her band ‘Gifts.’ She has opened for other well-known Christian artists, was signed with Jamm Records, a Los Angeles, California record company, and has had her music played on radio stations throughout the U.S.\n\nAs a producer and promoter of special events, Joy has received local acclaim for the Annual Women’s History Month Celebrations held each March at the St. Joseph’s Plaza (formerly known as the Priory) located in Newark, New Jersey. These uniquely memorable experiences have focused on honoring extraordinary women for their outstanding accomplishments, Audiences have been treated to virtuoso performances by the Tri-state’s most talented artists.\n\nAs a jazz vocalist, Joy’s rich melodic voice and unique phrasing take the listener back to the days of classic jazz, invoking shades of Sarah Vaughan and hints at the daring of Billie Holiday. Warmly embraced by enthusiastic audiences, she has appeared at several venues throughout the Tri-state area.\n\nhttps://www.jerseyindie.com/blog/whm2021-womens-history-month-celebration-by-ife-basim-masterpieces\n\nChristopher Dean Sullivan - “a bassist who is authoritative and bluesy while bending notes that honor his affection for legends such as Slam Stewart as well as Ray Brown.” ~ Steve Monroe, Jazz Journalists Association\n\nThe critically acclaimed Chicago Ill born, Pittsburgh PA raised bassist Christopher Dean Sullivan is well traveled throughout the U.S. and abroad. Christopher started his career in Pittsburgh , PA. After a few years in Germany he returned to Pittsburgh and honed his craft as a bassist during his time with the Jazz Workshop Inc., located in the Homewood district, under the direction of Harold Young Sr, and the Archives, located in the Hill district, developed by Errol “Mobutu” Reynolds (Grant Green, Johnny Lytle), where Chris in his words stated …“I got the honor to perform with guitarist Grant Green on three different occasions, through my association with the Archives.”\n\nChris quickly became known for his own unique approach to playing the bass. He formed local commercial groups that would go on to open up concerts for such bands of notoriety as the Ohio Players, The Bar-Kays, New Birth, The Tavares, and others. Chris decided to expand his musical horizons and started performing with the jazz notables of the Pittsburgh, PA region; Joe Harris (Dizzy Gillespie), Roger Humphries (Horace Silver), Nathan Davis (Pitt University), arranger Arthur Powell, Pete Henderson, Larry Mcgee, Nelson Harrison (Count Basie), J. C. Moses (Eric Dolphy), Geri Allen, Carl Arter, Jothan Callins (Sun Rah), and others.

These seasoned veterans combined have over 150 years in the entertainment business, creating a wealth of experience from numerous performances around the US and across the World.
