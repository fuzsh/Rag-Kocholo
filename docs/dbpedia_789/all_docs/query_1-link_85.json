        "text": "Moody, originally a travelling reserve, was catapulted into the Olympic spotlight when a video was released of Dujardin repeatedly whipping a horse on the legs during a training exercise.\n\nThe six-time Olympic medallist promptly withdrew on the eve of the Games, leading to a debut for the 44-year-old from Gunthwaite.\n\nDujardin’s mentor Carl Hester, set to join Moody and Lottie Fry in Saturday’s team final, condemned her actions but urged forgiveness, while the Yorkshire rider also felt the clip was out of character.\n\n“Fundamentally, my overriding emotion was sadness,” she said, when asked for her verdict of the damning video.\n\n“It is not a reflection of our sport and, for me, it’s not a reflection of what I know about Charlotte.\n\n“I’ve seen her compete a lot and I’ve seen her train horses a lot and that is not a side I saw. It made me sad but her statement (released last week) said everything she needed to say, she has owned that.\n\n“I think everybody needs to remember the human in this situation.”\n\nMoody proved a more than able deputy for her illustrious absent compatriot on the opening day of dressage qualification.\n\nRiding Jagerbomb, she overcame her nerves to qualify directly for Sunday’s individual final by topping Group C in searing heat amid the stunning backdrop of the Chateau de Versailles.\n\n“That was insane,” she said. “What a stadium, what a crowd – just an amazing experience.\n\n“I was a little bit nauseous beforehand but it’s an incredible venue and we have a fantastic team around us, they couldn’t have been more helpful. To feel part of it is amazing.”\n\nMoody toyed with selling Jagerbomb several years ago, doubting he would ever ‘be a top class horse’, but the 10-year-old has proved her wrong in the time since and thrived on the big stage.\n\n“He is so special to me,” she said. “We have done everything together.\n\n“We both went in there a little bit nervous and apprehensive but we helped each other out and I’m so proud of him.”\n\nOn the choice of name, she added: “I bred him 10 years ago and at that point in my life I might have been partial to a Jagerbomb. It suits him.\n\n“Also, my grandad, who was called Norman, we all called him bomb for some reason. So, it was a little bit of a homage to him as well as the alcoholic beverage.”"
