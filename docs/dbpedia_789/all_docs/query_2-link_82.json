        "text": "By Gregory Burrus | Posted Sunday, December 12, 2021\n\nOne of the many tasks I perform every year is producing and promoting live music events. Curating the right band relies a lot on the bandleader bringing out all the right musicians and getting them to perform in a synchronous manner. This season, Gregory Burrus Productions had a number of \"Norman Mann and Rafiki\" live music performances that stood out as outstanding. This was evidenced by sold out, very happy audiences enjoying themselves to the maximum. Let's listen to a few performances and then meet the band.\n\nThey came back together again, live at the Rutgers Institute of Jazz Studies’ Clements Place Jazz in Newark, NJ. They all got together and produced a truly awesome live music concert. The band configuration was Norman Mann on Percussion, vocals, Gene Ghee on Sax, Peter Lin on Trombone, Joy Topping Mann (aka Ife Basim) on Vocals, Christopher Dean Sullivan on Bass, Sir G. Earl Grice on Drums, Tomoko Ohno on Piano.\n\nAs you can see and hear, Norman Mann curates a stellar list of musicians that perform some incredible sets. Part of this may be hinted at in the band name Rafiki. Norman has been quoted as saying, \"Rafiki is a Swahili word that translates to English as ‘friend.’” So now, let's meet the friends in the band.\n\nNorman, along with Greg Salandis, are widely known for their past partnership at Skippers Plane Street Pub in November 2007. Skippers was a very popular spot in Newark located on University Ave and was a welcomed addition to Newark's nightlife. It was a place where music, food, drink, and conversation were the rage and occurred in a comfortable, friendly environment. Skippers featured many of the Tri-State’s musicians and singers. Norman Mann, as a musician, plays congas, percussion and also sings. He has appeared with drummers Greg Buford, Alvester Garnett, and singers Ty Stephens, Joy Topping Mann, Tomoko Ohno, and Dwight West along with one of Jersey's top organists and keyboardists, Mel Davis, to name a few.\n\nNorman and his bands have performed in numerous venues around Northern New Jersey such as Montclair’s Trumpets Jazz Club, Newark’s Priory Jazz Club, City of Orange’s Mr. Jays, Jazz In Spiotta Park and Jazz On Sloan in South Orange, NJ. Norman is the CEO of G Mann Productions, has produced jazz shows at many of the Tri-State area clubs and lately has been producing events in Irvington’s Cricket Club.\n\nFollowing are the bios of some truly cool members of the band.\n\nTomoko Ohno, born in Tokyo, began piano studies at the age of 4. As a teenager, she began playing professionally in the Tokyo area jazz scene. After graduating from Rikkyo University in Law and Politics, Miss Ohno moved to the United States and entered the Jazz Studies Program at William Paterson University in New Jersey, where she studied with Harold Mabern and Rufus Reid. During this time she had the opportunity to perform with such artists as Jerome Richardson, Wynton Marsalis, Benny Golson and Joe Henderson. A recipient of the Student Award of Outstanding Performance and a member of the Dean’s List, Miss Ohno graduated with a B.A. in Jazz Studies.\n\nShe has performed at Lincoln Center, Weill Recital, Carnegie Hall, The Blue Note, Birdland , in addition to appearing on live radio broadcasts by WBGO and WNYC, and ABC TV's Good Morning America.
