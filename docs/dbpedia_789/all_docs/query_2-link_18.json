        "text": "\"Positive experiences of PE at school can help develop life-long relationships with sport and physical activity.\" This was one of the phrases that struck me most from this announcement about investment in cricket last week. I totally agree, and sadly the converse is not only true but also one of the biggest reasons for adult inactivity. But does it matter what children play? Can playing any sport or activity result in a more active adulthood or do some sports \"transfer\" better? For example gymnastics is a very popular sport amongst children but almost none one does it once they reach adulthood. Whereas running, cycling and to a lesser extent swimming or all popular with almost every age group. Should we be investing in sports with more crossover between childhood and adulthood or is this irrelevant?\n\nHow well do cricket fans know their sponsors? ❓Do cricket teams think about their fans before signing a big brand deal? ❓Will the fans every remember the brands names? ❓How could cricket do better? Since leaving pro sport I built Moonrise Sports to give sports teams a platform to put their fans first. To show that the fans are and will always be the most important thing to them. I also created the CricketDevelopmentProgram to give England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB) teams the chance get cricket into every state school for FREE without the need of extra work. As always, connect and drop me a DM if you fit these three criteria. ✅ You believe fans are the most important part of sport ✅ You want to inspire the next generation ✅ You are more focused on positive change than the money you can get.

Everything you need to know about MLC and their major cricket event is coming this weekend! The Major Cricket League is a professional Twenty20 cricket tournament that is played in the United States. This tournament is operated by American Cricket Enterprise and sanctioned by USA Cricket. 2023 was the first season of MLC, and it was a success because there was viewership around the globe and sponsorship from different big brands. The USA, which is home to basketball, organised its first international cricket tournament after the success of MLC. Teams participating in the tournament 1) The Texas Super Kings 2) Los Angeles knight riders 3) Mi New York 4) San Francisco unicorns 5) Seattle orcas 6) Washington freedom. Cognizant is the first-ever title sponsor of the only world-class professional cricket championship in America. In the last 2 years, the USA has spent billions of dollars on cricket. The reason can be because of the popularity of sports in Asian countries and others. People playing this sport are large in number, and there is an opportunity to turn this into business. What are your views on why the USA is investing millions in organising cricket tournaments? Do let me know in the comments. #cricket #mlc #sports #usa\n\nI want to be supportive, I want to be happy, I really do, but ultimately I am left feeling this is an opportunity missed. This is not because FabLittleBag is absent from this offering when for so long it was central to it, it is because there was a real and timely opportunity for the England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to lead as a governing body and ignite a ground breaking, sustainable focussed positive change at grassroots level and upwards around period management, and to do this differently, to address this from the #woman and #girls perspective; what does good thoughtful period provision looks like, what does feeling truly 'welcomed' feel like and to embed a strong environmental and sustainability message hand in hand with the solution for future generations. Instead what we have is a commercial deal with a lot of plastic & waste; large plastic units in small cubicles, adding wet wipes; more plastic, & universally acknowledged to be environmentally damaging, & dog poo bags for disposal. Justification is they're \"biodegradable & compostable\" - that's because they're actually dog poo bags! So if buried in the ground, there's a chance for them to biodegrade. In cricket club cubicles #tampons & #pads are not #biodegradable, or buried in the ground, they will simply be collected & incinerated so zero biodegrading or composting going on; feels like #greenwashing as it gives the impression they are 'eco-friendly' when they are nothing of the sort. What impression do dog poo bags give to girls changing their pads? We know they do not change the behaviour of those who habitually flush either... The tampons & pads are in multipacks in boxes; seems unnecessarily wasteful; the boxes wont be recycled, they extra items may well left on the floor then others wont want to use them, if 10 boxes in the unit then only 10 people are provided for as opposed to 30 if they were unboxed... It misses the whole point of creating something that makes women & girls feel valued and is easy for clubs to manage. Perhaps the oddest part is the provision of a sani-bin service to hundreds of #cricket clubs, the vast majority of which simply have no requirement for this, yet it means hundreds of car trips all over England to collect period waste for no reason? Logistically, volunteers having to organise to be in, traffic delays, I just do not understand this aspect at all. I am sure some clubs will go for it; after all it is free (initially at least), but it feels so much less than it could have been. #menstruation #periods #womenssport #sustainability #value Afsaneh Parvizi-Wayne FRSA Giovanna Forte Kelly Newton Zoe Brimelow Emmie Faust Suzie Betts Nigel Purveur Alan Davies Clare Cooper Catherine Ann Reid Penny Maystone Joyeeta Das Jo Hendrickx @Rachel Bulwada Olivia ScottAnge Sweeney Maya Herm Leigh Burns Julie Harris John Joyce Richard Ayers Jim Knight Sam Cooper-Gray"
