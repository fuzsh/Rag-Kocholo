        "text": "Robert Norman Reid, aged 77, passed away on January 25, 2018 at Mississauga Hospital after a long struggle with illness. Rob was born in Toronto to Victor and Jemima Reid on July 17, 1940 and was the youngest of three boys. He will be dearly missed by his wife and best friend, Jane, and children, Matthew and Sally (Jason), who are so proud of him and who will cherish their memories of him always. He is predeceased by his brothers Victor (Bette) and Jim, whom he loved well, and he will be lovingly remembered by his brother and sister -in-law Chris and Mary Jo, as well as his three nephews, Colin (Dale), Scott (Valerie) and Blake (Marlene). In his younger years, Rob was a gifted athlete who played a brilliant game of football, outrunning his opponents with grace and speed. Throughout his life, he had an inquisitive and logical mind, and found endless beauty in the natural world. Known to be a man of compassion and profound decency, he was embraced by all who knew him, including his wonderful group of friends, whom he cared deeply for.\n\nIt was Rob’s wish to have a Celebration of Life held for him rather than a funeral, details of which will be forthcoming. Our family would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the doctors, nurses and personal care workers at Mississauga Hospital for their diligent care and attention to his needs as he moved towards the end of his life. His physical resilience and strength of character will be remembered by all who had the privilege of knowing him.\n\nIn memory of Rob, donations to Colon Cancer Canada and Mississauga Hospital would be welcomed and appreciated."
