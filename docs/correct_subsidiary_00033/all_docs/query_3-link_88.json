        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. – Steel maker Nucor Corp. had long prided itself on having just three management layers separating the chief executive from the hourly workers pouring hot metal on the factory floor.\n\nBut maintaining a thin structure is getting harder, as Nucor’s steel operations have expanded from a single South Carolina plant producing roof joists to the largest U.S. steel producer, in terms of shipments. Printing the names of all 11,000 worldwide employees in the annual report now takes seven pages.\n\nWith Nucor’s production doubling every few years, Chairman and Chief Executive Dan DiMicco decided he couldn’t have plant managers reporting directly to him anymore. The company reluctantly created a new layer of five executive vice presidents, for a total of four layers between him and the factory floor.\n\n“I needed to be free to make decisions on trade battles,” says DiMicco. He is mindful of not getting too removed: He recently spent a morning answering every e-mail received from workers thanking him for a bonus. And Nucor’s headquarters staff is still relatively lithe, numbering 66, from receptionists to executives. By contrast, U.S. Steel Corp. employs 1,200 people at its Pittsburgh headquarters. Nucor doesn’t have a public-relations department or a corporate jet. Managers answer their own telephones and e-mails and make their own travel arrangements. A conference room at its headquarters features a small 1986 Sharp television set.\n\nFive management layers, including the chief executive, seems like a lot to Nucor. (The company quibbles that the executive vice presidents aren’t a new “layer,” they just replace one chief operating officer.) But five is paper-thin compared with many other industrial and manufacturing companies, even those viewed as lean, such as Toyota Motor Corp.\n\n“You’re going to get at least 10 layers at Toyota before you get to the president,” says Art Smalley, a former Toyota engineer and a former steel-industry consultant at McKinsey & Co. “I don’t view it as a right or wrong thing,” he says, adding that one formula doesn’t work for every company.\n\nBeing lean goes beyond the number of management layers, he says. A small business, with just two management layers, can be fat if the managers do unnecessary tasks, or if processes are inefficient or insufficiently automated. A chief executive with too few management layers below is likely to be overwhelmed with people relaying information and seeking guidance.\n\nLean is more about eliminating waste and running efficiently, management experts say. In the end, the best measure is profitability. For 2005, Nucor reported net income climbed 16 percent to $1.31 billion on revenue of $12.7 billion.\n\nSteel and other commodity companies usually aren’t lean by choice: Forced to compete on cost, delivery and quality, their profits depend on winnowing excess from each step, such as purchasing raw material or shipping and selling products.\n\nIncreasingly, lean is the norm in the technology sector, too. International Business Machines Corp. had to shed corporate offices and management structures as it changed from hardware producer to service provider, says Michael Useem, professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, Philadelphia. Many IBM consultants now work from their homes rather than a posh corporate office, and they function in a decentralized structure with fewer layers. Last year, IBM cut more than 14,000 jobs, largely in an effort to thin the management ranks at its bureaucratic European operation.\n\n“Layers get in the way of everything,” says Useem. “They, by definition, slow decisions down, because decisions have to go up.” In the past 20 years, he says, as many U.S. companies have given their managers broader responsibility over wider groups of employees, the corporate pyramid has become flatter, with fewer layers from top to bottom. One result is that authority for decision-making and responsibility for results has moved lower down in the organization.\n\nOften, an operation becomes lean because of a single personality – a top executive who sets an example and is relentless about eliminating waste. When the personality leaves, does the lean mentality survive in the next generation? “Hewlett-Packard had the H-P way. The founders are gone, and the H-P way is mostly gone,” says Jeffrey Liker, a management expert and professor of engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\n\nIn the 1990s, when Nucor was focused mostly on making bars, beams and other long products, each plant tried to out-produce the others, says Mike Parrish, an executive vice president for the bar-mill group. But Nucor, with little coordination among its increasing number of plants, couldn’t capitalize in terms of shared marketing, sales or purchasing.\n\nLoath to add layers, Nucor resisted creating, for example, a business-development position to lead the effort to turn research and development into sales. As a result, no one bothered to protect Nucor’s technology innovations, and several copycat minimills used them to get up and running, without having to pay a license fee to Nucor.\n\nTurning an entrenched operation into a lean one is harder than creating one from scratch. That is partly why Toyota prefers to build its own automotive plants in the U.S., instead of buying existing operations.\n\nNucor has developed its own approach to acquisitions. It sends in a four-member “transition team” to change signs, quickly eliminate some management jobs and assign new titles. At an Auburn, N.Y., plant Nucor acquired in 2001, the company abolished two management layers and eliminated nine executive positions."
