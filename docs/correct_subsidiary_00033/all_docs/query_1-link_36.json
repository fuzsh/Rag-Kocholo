        "text": "Finance Professional Speaker Series\n\nSupported by:\n\nThe James G. Richardson Endowment\n\nThe William R. Hough Program in Finance\n\nThis series brings Finance professionals to the Warrington College of Business to discuss their area of expertise. Speakers demonstrate how professionals approach specific problems, give insight into particular industries, and discuss major trends in the various markets and industries in which they operate. The speakers always take time in their presentation to talk about career strategies.\n\nStudents have the additional opportunity to broaden their professional exposure by joining the speaker’s small lunch groups prior to the talk. On these Fridays, students have available one-on-one career and industry consultation and additional lecture lunches with Bruce Foerster, a leading practitioner with considerable investment banking experience. The Finance Professional Speaker Series is widely attended by undergraduates and MBA students. Dress is business casual.\n\nUpcoming Speakers\n\nAll presentations are held from 2:00 – 4:00 pm.\n\nRecent Speakers"
