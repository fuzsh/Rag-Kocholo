Total capitalization is $14.3MM (see sources and uses below).\n\nTotal debt proceeds to be approximately $8,000,000 (64% LTV) with approximately $6,300,000 of equity of which the Sponsor will be providing a 15% co-invest.\n\n5/27/24 Update: Of the total equity required, $1.75MM is coming in through a TIC 1031 exchange which represents 27.78% of the total equity required. Therefore, this JV offering is for a total of approximately $4,550,000. The Sponsor will have over 15% of the total invested equity between its share of the TIC and the JV offering.\n\nLoan terms are for seven years at 6.89% interest rate with three years of interest only followed by 30 years amortization and flexible prepayment provided by a life insurance company.\n\nYear one Debt Service Coverage Ratio is approx. 1.90x and projected exit year DSCR is 2.30%.\n\nProjected hold period to be 5+ years with projected terminal forward NOI at approximately $1,403,660, an estimated 7.75% exit cap rate yielding a projected exit value of approximately $18,000,000.\n\nTotal projected returns to investors are for a 1.9x multiple over the hold period and a projected 16% IRR.\n\nWhat refinancing or other liquidity events are planned?\n\nAt this time, there is no refinancing contemplated during the lifecycle of the project, and no concrete sales date planned. That said, the intent is to hold for 5 years, refinancing is a possibility earlier than that date and, as we always underwrite for the long term, it is possible we may hold the asset for more than 5 years.\n\nWill the General Partner file state tax returns on behalf of Limited Partners ('LPs')?\n\nThe operating entity will file all appropriate state and federal tax returns on behalf of the partnership and distribute K-1's to the partners on a timely basis.\n\nHow can I make my investment as a Trust?\n\nYes, you can.
