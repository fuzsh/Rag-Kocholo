You may read and copy any document that we file with the SEC at the SEC's public reference room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information on the public reference rooms. These SEC filings are also available to you free of charge at the SEC's web site at http://www.sec.gov. FORWARD-LOOKING AND OTHER STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward-looking statements about our financial condition, results of operations and business. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate\" and similar words used in this prospectus. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Because the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on the statements, which speak only as of the date of this prospectus. The cautionary statements set forth above should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue. We do not undertake any obligation to review or confirm analysts' expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this prospectus or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included in this prospectus include general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and industry-based factors such as: i o technological developments that could competitively disadvantage us; o our dependence on key individuals and relationships; o labor costs and strikes at our customers' or at our facilities; o exposure to product liability and warranty claims; o increases in our raw material and energy costs; o compliance with environmental and other regulations; and o competition within our industries. In addition, factors more specific to us could cause actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included in this prospectus, such as substantial leverage, limitations imposed by our debt instruments, our ability to identify attractive and other strategic acquisition opportunities and our ability to successfully separate from Metaldyne Corporation and to successfully integrate acquired businesses including actions we have identified as providing cost-saving opportunities. We disclose important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations under \"Risk Factors,\" \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and elsewhere in this prospectus. These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf. When we indicate that an event, condition or circumstance could or would have an adverse effect on us, we mean to include effects upon our business, financial and other condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on the notes. We were acquired by Metaldyne (formerly MascoTech, Inc.) in January 1998 and Metaldyne did not report our results as a separate segment for 1998. As such, certain statements in this prospectus that concern us for periods which include 1998 are based upon our review of internal records and our best estimates of certain data. ii PROSPECTUS SUMMARY This summary highlights the material information contained elsewhere in this prospectus. You should read this entire prospectus carefully, including \"Risk Factors\" and our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. Unless the context otherwise requires, all information in this prospectus which refers to (i) the \"Issuer\" refers only to TriMas Corporation and (ii) the \"Company,\" or \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" refers to the Issuer and its subsidiaries. For purposes of this prospectus, when we describe information on a pro forma basis, we are giving effect only to those adjustments set forth under \"Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information.\" THE COMPANY We are a manufacturer of highly engineered products serving niche markets in a diverse range of commercial, industrial and consumer applications. While serving diverse markets, most of our businesses share important characteristics, including leading market shares, strong brand names, established distribution networks, high operating margins, and relatively low capital investment requirements. We estimate that approximately 70% of our 2001 net sales were in U.S. markets in which we enjoy the number one or number two market position within the respective product category. In addition, we believe that in many of our businesses, we are one of only two or three manufacturers. On June 6, 2002, an investor group led by Heartland Industrial Partners, L.P. acquired 66% of our fully diluted common equity. Metaldyne Corporation, our former parent, owns the remaining 34% of our fully diluted common equity. As of September 29, 2002, Heartland owned approximately 55% of our fully diluted common equity. We operated as an independent public company from 1989 through 1997. In 1998, we were acquired by Metaldyne and in November 2000 Metaldyne was acquired by an investor group led by Heartland. In early 2001, we hired a new senior management team to increase our operating efficiency and develop a focused growth strategy. We believe that as an independent company, we will be better able to capitalize on our core manufacturing strengths and our significant cash flow generation capacity to exploit growth opportunities. Our businesses are organized into three operating groups: Transportation Accessories, Rieke Packaging Systems and Industrial Specialties. o Transportation Accessories Group. This group is a leading designer and manufacturer of a wide range of accessory products used to outfit light trucks, SUVs, recreational vehicles, passenger cars, and trailers of all types including towing and hitch systems, trailer components, electrical products, brake and rack systems, and additional towing and trailering components. We benefit from strong brand names, including Draw-Tite, Reese, Fulton, Wesbar, Hayman-Reese and ROLA, that have broad customer recognition and are often perceived as the quality leader in their respective market categories. We believe we have the most extensive product lines in the industry. Our products are distributed through an established national network of independent installers as well as several retail outlets such as Wal-Mart, Lowe's, Pep Boys, AutoZone and West Marine. Our products are also distributed by both automotive and trailer original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs. o Rieke Packaging Systems Group. This group is a leading specialty manufacturer of engineered closures and dispensing systems for steel and plastic industrial and consumer packaging applications. Our brand names include Rieke, TOV, Englass and Stolz. We believe that our Rieke Packaging Systems group has significant market share in many of its key product lines as a result of proprietary engineering and manufacturing technology, patent protected systems and strong customer relationships. We have over 25 patented or patent application pending systems or technologies. Approximately 50% of this group's 2001 net sales relate to value-added products based upon patented processes or technology. We believe this group has significant growth opportunities in the consumer products and pharmaceutical 1 markets through the introduction of its industrial design technology to a range of consumer applications. Our customers include BASF, Chevron, Coca-Cola, Colgate, Dow Chemical, Pepsi, Procter & Gamble, Sherwin Williams, Valvoline and Zeneca. o Industrial Specialties Group. This group manufactures a diverse range of industrial products, such as cylinders, flame-retardant facings and jacketings, specialty tape products, industrial gaskets and precision tools, specialty fasteners and other products for use primarily in the automotive, aerospace, construction, commercial, energy and defense markets. Our companies and brands include Monogram Aerospace Fasteners, Entegra Fasteners, Lake Erie Screw, Compac Corporation, Norris Cylinders, Arrow Engine, Keo Cutters, Richard's Micro Tool and Precision Performance. This group supplies highly engineered and customer-specific products, provides value-added design and other services and serves small markets supplied by a limited number of companies. Our customers in this group include Air Liquide, Airgas, Anderson Windows, BOC, Boeing, Caterpillar, Dana, Delta Faucets, Exxon Mobil, Grainger, Honeywell, John Deere, Knauf and Shell. OPERATING AND GROWTH STRATEGY We will seek to enhance our cash flow and return on assets through the following operating and growth strategies: o Capitalize on New Product Development Opportunities. We have developed innovative products without the need for significant incremental capital investment and will work closely with our customers to identify new product development opportunities. We believe we have significant opportunities for future development in many of our businesses that will benefit from our existing brand awareness and successful distribution networks. o Pursue Strategic Niche Acquisitions. We have successfully completed over 25 acquisitions since 1986 and continue to seek attractive acquisition candidates that will supplement existing product lines, add new distribution channels, provide new cost-effective technologies, expand our geographic coverage or enable us to absorb overhead costs more efficiently. o Continue to Aggressively Pursue Cost Savings Initiatives. In 2001, our new management team implemented a plan to reorganize us into three business groups and eliminate duplicative costs that we expect will result in annual cost savings of approximately $29 million by the second quarter of 2004. o Continue to Emphasize Strong Free Cash Flow. We have grown by making selective acquisitions using disciplined acquisition criteria that focus on high margin businesses in niche markets with relatively low capital requirements. We will continue to focus on high margin businesses so that we can maximize free cash flow. o Capitalize on Cyclical Recoveries. Several of our businesses sell into industrial markets that experienced cyclical volume declines during 2001 as a result of general economic conditions as well as a sharp liquidation of industrial inventories. In response, management has aggressively pursued cost savings opportunities and projects and has reduced our operating costs. While the timing of a recovery in cyclical markets is uncertain, we believe that we are well positioned to experience further margin improvement if volume increases given our lower cost structure. o Leverage Economies of Scale and Utilize World Class Operating Practices. By increasing our scale, we will have opportunities to improve supply base management, internal sourcing of materials and selective out-sourcing of support functions, such as risk management, logistics and freight management. 2 THE TRANSACTIONS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS On June 6, 2002, Metaldyne and Heartland consummated a stock purchase agreement under which Heartland and other investors invested approximately $265 million in us and acquired approximately 66% of our fully diluted common stock. As a result of the investment and other transactions described below, Metaldyne received $840 million in the form of cash, retirement of debt we owed to Metaldyne or owed by us under the Metaldyne credit agreement and the repurchase of the balance of receivables we originated and sold under the Metaldyne receivables facility. Metaldyne retained shares of our common stock valued at $120 million. In addition, Metaldyne received a warrant to purchase 750,000 additional shares of our common stock valued at $15 million. The common stock and warrants are valued based upon the cash equity investment made by Heartland and the other investors. Immediately following the transactions, Heartland and Metaldyne owned approximately 55% and 34% of our fully diluted common stock, respectively. To effect the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement, we entered into a senior credit facility consisting of a $150 million revolving credit facility and a $260 million term loan facility and a $125 million receivables facility, issued the original notes and raised $265 million in cash through the issuance of common stock. We used borrowings under our credit facility and proceeds from the original notes offering to repay borrowings made by our subsidiaries under the Metaldyne credit agreement in November 2000, to repay certain debt that our subsidiaries owed to Metaldyne and its other subsidiaries and to repurchase receivables balances we originated and sold under the Metaldyne receivables facility. Prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement, we declared and paid a cash dividend equal to the difference between the $840 million and the aggregate amount of such debt repayment and receivables repurchase. We also issued the warrant as a dividend. We were released from all of our obligations under the Metaldyne credit agreement in connection with the transactions. See the information under the headings \"Description of Credit Facility\" and \"Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.\" We refer to the June 6, 2002 common equity issuance to Heartland and the related financings as the \"transactions.\" On December 10, 2002, we issued an additional $85.0 million in aggregate principal amount of notes pursuant to our June 6, 2002 indenture under which our original notes were previously issued. We refer to the December 10, 2002 notes issuance as the \"additional issuance,\" and the notes issued thereby as the \"additional notes.\" The additional notes are identical to the original notes and upon their exchange in this offering, will trade as a single class of notes with the original notes exchanged in this offering. We intend to use the net proceeds from the additional issuance for general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and debt repayment, and to use up to $20.0 million of the net proceeds to repurchase a portion of our common stock owned by Metaldyne. We received a consent from our senior lenders to permit us to effect this stock repurchase and to hold the balance of the cash proceeds until June 29, 2003 pending use for any potential permitted acquisitions. If we do not utilize the portion of the net proceeds being held for acquisitions or the stock repurchase by June 29, 2003, we may apply some of the net proceeds to repay a portion of our term credit facility. See \"Description of Credit Facility.\" On January 27, 2003, we entered into an agreement to purchase all of the capital stock of HammerBlow Acquisition Corp., a manufacturer and distributor of towing, trailer and other vehicle accessories throughout North America, from 2000 Riverside Capital Appreciation Fund, L.P. and other stockholders of HammerBlow for a purchase price of approximately $142 million (less our previous investment of $9.0 million), subject to adjustment. Of this amount, $7.5 million of the purchase price is payable in January 2004. On a pro forma basis to account for its recent acquisitions, Hammerblow had annual sales of approximately $108.0 million for the twelve months ended November 30, 2002. We cannot assure you that the proposed acquisition will be completed on these or other terms. The purchase includes The HammerBlow Corporation, Hidden Hitch, Tekonsha Towing Systems and SurePull Towing Systems. Hammerblow sells its products under trade names such as BULLDOG (Registered Trademark); CROWN a manufacturer of (Registered Trademark), ECLIPSE by HammerBlow (Registered Trademark) and HammerBlow/Snowco (Registered Trademark). The acquisition is expected to be financed with cash on hand and drawings from our revolving credit facility. Hammerblow is currently controlled by The Riverside Company, a private equity firm. 3 SUMMARY OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER The Exchange Offer............

At September 29, 2002, the exchange notes and the guarantees would have ranked junior to: o approximately $260.0 million of senior indebtedness; and o other liabilities, including trade payables but excluding intercompany obligations, of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. At September 29, 2002, the notes and related guarantees then outstanding were not senior to any of our 7 indebtedness and the notes and related guarantees are not currently senior to any of our Indebtedness. Further, at September 29, 2002, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the additional issuance we could have incurred up to an aggregate of $36.4 million in additional senior indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and/or receivables facility. We had no indebtedness that ranked equally with the notes. Restrictive Covenants......... The exchange notes will be issued under an indenture with The Bank of New York, as trustee. The indenture governing the notes will limit the ability of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: o incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; o pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our stock; o make investments; o sell assets; o create liens; o enter into agreements restricting our restricted subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends; o enter into transactions with affiliates; and o consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications, which are described under the heading \"Description of Notes\" in this prospectus. --------------------- TriMas Corporation is a Delaware corporation.

The financial data for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 has been derived from our audited combined financial statements and notes to those financial statements included in this prospectus, which have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants. The financial data for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1997 was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements not included in this prospectus. The financial data for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998 was derived from our unaudited combined financial statements not included in this prospectus. The selected information for the nine months ended September 30, 2001 and September 29, 2002 has been derived from our unaudited interim combined/consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements, which, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for the fair presentation of that data for such periods. In reviewing the following information, it should be noted that there is significant non-comparability across historic periods. On June 6, 2002, Metaldyne issued approximately 66% of our fully diluted common equity to an investor group led by Heartland. We did not establish a new basis of accounting as a result of this common equity issuance, due to the continuing contractual control by Heartland. Our combined financial information for the periods prior to June 6, 2002 includes allocations and estimates of direct and indirect Metaldyne corporate administrative costs attributable to us, which are deemed by management to be reasonable but are not necessarily reflective of those costs to us on an ongoing basis. Prior to June 6, 2002, we were owned by Metaldyne. On November 28, 2000, Metaldyne was acquired by an investor group led by Heartland. The pre-acquisition basis of accounting for periods prior to November 28, 2000 is reflected on the historical basis of accounting and all periods subsequent to November 28, 2000 are reflected on a purchase accounting basis and are therefore not comparable. In January 1998, we were acquired by Metaldyne and established a new basis of accounting as a result of this acquisition. Prior to January 1998, we operated as an independent public company.\n\nPRE-ACQUISITION BASIS --------------------------------------------------------- YEAR ENDED YEAR ENDED YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, DECEMBER 31, DECEMBER 31, 1/1/2000- 1997 1998(1) 1999 11/27/2000 -------------- -------------- -------------- ------------ (in thousands) STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS DATA: Net sales ..................... $ 667,910 $ 707,180 $ 773,100 $ 739,590 Cost of sales ................. 447,940 475,550 519,610 514,570 --------- --------- --------- --------- Gross profit .................. 219,970 231,630 253,490 225,020 Selling, general and administrative ............... 106,270 122,370 134,560 130,490 --------- --------- --------- --------- Operating profit .............. 113,700 109,260 118,930 94,530 --------- --------- --------- --------- Net income (loss)(2) .......... 66,370 41,650 35,300 21,280 OTHER FINANCIAL DATA: Depreciation and amortization ................. $ 25,680 $ 31,780 $ 38,520 $ 38,400 Capital expenditures .......... 28,560 39,200 42,320 19,540 Cash flow from (used by): operating activities ......... 83,820 93,970 55,980 113,430 investing activities .........

Financial results for the 21 days prior to Metaldyne's acquisition have not been included because the results were determined on a different accounting basis. Results of operations for the first 21 days of January were as follows: sales -- $35.9 million; operating profit -- $4.9 million. (2) Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" and discontinued amortization of goodwill. See Note 3 to the audited combined financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements, respectively, for the effect on net income (loss) of excluding amortization expense related to goodwill that will no longer be amortized. We completed the transitional test for impairment of goodwill in the second quarter of 2002, which resulted in a non-cash after-tax charge of $36.6 million related to our industrial fasteners business. (3) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating profit before depreciation and amortization and legacy restricted stock award expense. Adjusted EBITDA-related information is presented in the manner as defined herein because we believe it is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company's ability to service and/or incur indebtedness. However, Adjusted EBITDA-related information should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because Adjusted EBITDA-related information is not calculated identically by all companies, the presentation in this prospectus is not likely to be comparable to those disclosed by other companies.\n\nRECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET INCOME (LOSS) ------------------------------------------------ PRE-ACQUISITION BASIS ------------------------------------------------ YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, ----------------------------------- 1/1/2000- 1997 1998 1999 11/27/2000 ----------- ----------- ----------- ------------ Adjusted EBITDA ................... $ 139,380 $ 141,040 $ 158,060 $ 133,700 Depreciation and amortization .....................

Fixed charges include interest expense (including amortization of deferred financing costs), capitalized interest and the portion of operating rental expense which management believes is representative of the interest component of rent expense (assumed to be 33%). For the period ended December 31, 2000, the nine months ended September 30, 2001 and the year ended December 31, 2001, additional earnings of $5.3 million, $1.2 million and $9.6 million, respectively, would have been required to make the ratio 1.0x. 10 RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this prospectus, before deciding to invest in the notes. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS OUR BUSINESSES DEPEND UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND WE SERVE SOME CUSTOMERS IN HIGHLY CYCLICAL INDUSTRIES; AS A RESULT WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF DOWNTURN AND LOSS OF SALES DUE TO RECESSION, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND THE VALUE OF THE NOTES. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on conditions in the markets that we serve, and on the U.S. and global economies generally. Some of the industries that we serve are highly cyclical, such as the automotive, construction, industrial equipment, energy, aerospace and electrical equipment industries. We have experienced a downturn and reduction in sales and margins as a result of recent recessionary conditions. In addition, we had a net loss of approximately $30.9 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2002, due in large part to an approximate $36.6 million charge for the cumulative effect on prior years of a change in recognition and measurement of goodwill impairment and negative cash flows from operations of approximately $20.2 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2002. A continued net loss could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results. While we have undertaken a consolidation and cost reduction program to mitigate the effect of these conditions, we may be unsuccessful in doing so and such actions may be insufficient. The present uncertain economic environment may result in significant quarter-to-quarter variability in our performance. Furthermore, we note that sales by our Transportation Accessories group are generally stronger in the first and second quarters, as distributors and retailers acquire product for the spring selling season. Any sustained weakness in demand or continued downturn or uncertainty in the economy generally would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and the value of the notes. OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY HIGHLY ENGINEERED OR CUSTOMER-DRIVEN AND, AS SUCH, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING TECHNOLOGY AND MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES, WHICH COULD PLACE US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE. We believe that our customers rigorously evaluate their suppliers on the basis of product quality, price competitiveness, technical expertise and development capability, new product innovation, reliability and timeliness of delivery, product design capability, manufacturing expertise, operational flexibility, customer service and overall management. Our success will depend on our ability to continue to meet our customers' changing specifications with respect to these criteria. We must remain committed to product research and development, advanced manufacturing techniques and service to remain competitive. We may not be able to address technological advances or introduce new products that may be necessary to remain competitive within our businesses. Furthermore, we may be unable to adequately protect any of our own technological developments to produce a sustainable competitive advantage. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ATTRACTIVE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES, SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE OUR ACQUIRED OPERATIONS OR REALIZE THE INTENDED BENEFITS OF OUR ACQUISITIONS, OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS WOULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. One of our growth strategies is to pursue selective strategic acquisition opportunities. We continually evaluate potential acquisitions, some of which could be material, and engage in discussions with acquisition candidates. On January 27, 2003, we entered into an agreement to purchase all of the capital stock of HammerBlow from 2000 Riverside Capital Appreciation Fund, L.P. and other stockholders of HammerBlow for a purchase price of approximately $142 million (less our previous investment of $9.0 million), subject to adjustment. $7.5 million of the purchase price is payable in January 2004. We may not be able to complete this acquisition on these or other terms. Attractive acquisition candidates may not be identified and acquired in the future, and financing for any such acquisitions may not be available on satisfactory terms or we may be unable to accomplish our strategic objectives as a result of any such acquisition. Our acquisition strategies may not be 11 successfully received by customers or achieve their intended benefits. Often acquisitions are undertaken to improve the operating results of either or both of the acquiror and the acquired company and we may not be successful in this regard. We will encounter various risks in acquiring other companies, including the possible inability to integrate an acquired business into our operations, diversion of management's attention and unanticipated problems or liabilities, some or all of which could materially and adversely affect our business strategy and financial condition and results. WE DEPEND ON THE SERVICES OF KEY INDIVIDUALS AND RELATIONSHIPS, THE LOSS OF WHICH WOULD MATERIALLY HARM US. Our success will depend, in part, on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. Some of our senior management was recently hired to pursue our new strategies and business objectives. Despite their business experience, our businesses will present new challenges for them and they may not be successful. Our future success will also depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain other qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key employees or the failure to attract or retain employees could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, our largest stockholder, Heartland, provides us with valuable strategic, operational and financial support, the loss of which could materially adversely affect us. WE RELY UPON METALDYNE FOR IMPORTANT TRANSITION SERVICES AND WE MAY ENCOUNTER CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES IN SEPARATING FROM METALDYNE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS AND LOSS OF JOINT PURCHASING BENEFITS. We may encounter certain challenges and difficulties in separating from Metaldyne. We entered into a corporate services agreement with Metaldyne for valuable services, including human resources support, risk management, management information systems, treasury and audit services, and other critical administrative and management functions and services. The agreement expires in June 2003. Upon the expiration of the agreement or if Metaldyne is unable to provide these services for any reason, we will need to replace the services. We do not know whether we will be able to replace or contract for these services on similar or more favorable economic terms and what cost may be incurred in the transition to another situation. In addition, Metaldyne is a party to many ordinary course contracts from which we have derived benefits in the past. Metaldyne and we have agreed to provide one another with the benefits of these contracts to the extent practicable. In general, these contracts can be replaced, but we may encounter costs or additional expense in doing so. Of particular note, we benefit from certain volume purchase agreements with suppliers of steel, other materials and energy by aggregating our purchases with Metaldyne. As of June 6, 2002, Metaldyne owns approximately 34% of our fully diluted common stock and Heartland appointed a majority of the Metaldyne board of directors. Accordingly, should Metaldyne materially reduce its equity interest in us or Heartland cease to control Metaldyne, it may impact the continuity and quality of the services we are provided, increase costs and affect our ability to realize continued joint purchasing benefits. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO WORK STOPPAGES AT OUR FACILITIES OR OUR CUSTOMERS MAY BE SUBJECTED TO WORK STOPPAGES, WHICH COULD SERIOUSLY IMPACT THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESS. As of September 29, 2002, approximately 13.4% of our work force was unionized. If our unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown in the future, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, if a greater percentage of our work force becomes unionized, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Many of our direct or indirect customers have unionized work forces. Strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by these customers or their suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures of assembly plants where our products are included. In addition, organizations responsible for shipping our customers' products may be impacted by occasional strikes staged by the Teamsters Union. Any interruption in the delivery of our customers' products could reduce demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on us. WE MAY INCUR MATERIAL LOSSES AND COSTS AS A RESULT OF PRODUCT LIABILITY AND WARRANTY CLAIMS THAT MAY BE BROUGHT AGAINST US. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our current and formerly manufactured or sold products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily 12 injury and/or property damage. We may experience material product liability losses in the future and/or incur significant costs to defend such claims. Our product liability insurance coverage may not be adequate for liabilities that may ultimately be incurred or it may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. In addition, if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in a government-required or manufacturer-instituted recall involving such products. Our Transportation Accessories business has historically experienced product liability claims as to towing products in the ordinary course of business. A successful claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance coverage or a requirement to participate in a product recall may have a materially adverse effect on our business. In the ordinary course of our business, contractual disputes over warranties can also arise. In addition, we are party to lawsuits related to asbestos contained in gaskets formerly manufactured by one of our Industrial Specialties group subsidiaries. These or other liabilities or claims may increase or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and results. See \"Business--Legal Proceedings\" for a discussion of these lawsuits. OUR BUSINESS MAY BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental and health and safety laws and regulations that: o affect ongoing operations and may increase capital costs and operating expenses in order to maintain compliance with such requirements; and o impose liability relating to contamination at our facilities, and at other locations such as former facilities, facilities where we have sent wastes for treatment or disposal, and other properties to which we (or a company or business for which we are responsible) are linked. Such liability may include, for example, investigation and cleanup of the contamination, personal injury and property damage caused by the contamination, and damages to natural resources. Some of these liabilities may be imposed without regard to fault, and may also be joint and several (which can result in a liable party being held responsible for the entire obligation, even where other parties are also liable). We are legally or contractually responsible or alleged to be responsible for the investigation and remediation of contamination at various sites, and for personal injury or property damages, if any, associated with such contamination. Our subsidiaries have been named as potentially responsible parties under the federal Superfund law or similar state laws in several sites requiring cleanup related to disposal of wastes we generated. These laws generally impose liability for costs to investigate and remediate contamination without regard to fault and under certain circumstances liability may be joint and several, resulting in one responsible party being held responsible for the entire obligation. Liability may also include damages to natural resources. Certain of our subsidiaries have entered into consent decrees relating to two sites in California along with the many other co-defendants in these matters. We have incurred substantial expenses for all these sites over a number of years, a portion of which has been covered by insurance. In addition to the foregoing, our businesses have incurred and likely will continue to incur expenses to investigate and clean up existing and former company-owned or leased property. Additional sites may be identified at which we are a potentially responsible party under the federal Superfund law or similar state laws. INCREASES IN OUR RAW MATERIAL OR ENERGY COSTS OR THE LOSS OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF OUR SUPPLIERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE THE NOTES. Generally, our raw materials requirements are obtainable from various sources and in the desired quantities. While we currently maintain alternative sources for raw materials, our businesses are subject to the risk of price fluctuations and periodic delays in the delivery of certain raw materials, component parts and specialty fasteners. Under supply contracts for steel of varying terms, Metaldyne has established the prices at which we will jointly purchase certain of our steel requirements. We, either alone or with Metaldyne, may not be able to renegotiate future prices under those contracts at prices favorable to us, depending on industry conditions. In addition, a failure by our suppliers to 13 continue to supply us with certain raw materials or component parts on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, would have a material adverse effect on us. Our energy costs are a substantial element of our cost structure. To the extent there are energy supply disruptions or material fluctuations in energy costs, our margins could be materially adversely impacted. WE MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASED COMPETITION AND INCREASED COSTS DUE TO COMPLIANCE WITH THE FASTENER QUALITY ACT, WHICH MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE THE NOTES. The Fastener Quality Act of 1990 regulates the manufacture, importation and distribution of certain high-grade industrial fasteners in the United States. The Fastener Act, which was amended in June 1999, requires some testing, certification, quality control and recordkeeping by the manufacturers, importers and distributors of such fasteners. As a result, lower barriers to entry, particularly for foreign firms, created additional competitive pressures from new market participants. We may therefore lose customers and could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, we, along with other fastener suppliers, are required to maintain records and product tracking systems. We have tracking and traceability systems, which, to date, have not materially increased expenses. However, future regulations may result in materially increased costs for us. A GROWING PORTION OF OUR SALES MAY BE DERIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL SOURCES, WHICH EXPOSES US TO CERTAIN RISKS WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE DEBT. Approximately 12.2% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 were derived from sales by our subsidiaries located outside of the United States and we may significantly expand our international operations through acquisitions. Sales outside of the United States, particularly sales to emerging markets, are subject to other various risks which are not present in sales within U.S. markets, including governmental embargoes or foreign trade restrictions such as antidumping duties, changes in U.S. and foreign governmental regulations, tariffs and other trade barriers, the potential for nationalization of enterprises, foreign exchange risk and other political, economic and social instability. In addition, there are tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash flow from non-U.S. subsidiaries. To the extent such repatriation is necessary for us to meet our debt service or other obligations, this will adversely affect our financial results and our ability to service debt. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND FUTURE IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS. At September 29, 2002, our goodwill and intangible assets were approximately $801.8 million, and represented approximately 60% of our total assets. Our net loss of $30.9 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2002 was impacted by a charge of $36.6 million for the cumulative effect on prior years of a change in recognition and measurement of goodwill impairment. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future results of operations. WE ARE CONTROLLED BY HEARTLAND, WHOSE INTERESTS IN OUR BUSINESS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN YOURS, AND CONSEQUENTLY HEARTLAND COULD TAKE ACTIONS THAT ARE NOT FAVORABLE TO A HOLDER OF EXCHANGE NOTES. Heartland and its affiliates own a majority of our common stock and are able to control our affairs. Our entire board has been, directly or indirectly, designated by Heartland and a majority of the board is associated with Heartland. In addition, Heartland controls Metaldyne, which owns approximately 34% of our fully diluted common stock. As described elsewhere and in another risk factor, we will have material ongoing relationships with both Heartland and Metaldyne. You should consider that the interests of Heartland and Metaldyne will likely differ from yours in material respects. For example, Heartland may cause us to pursue a growth strategy (including acquisitions which are not accretive to earnings), which could impact our ability to make payments on the exchange notes and our credit facility or cause a change in control. In addition, to the extent permitted by the indenture governing the exchange notes and our credit facility, Heartland may cause us to pay dividends rather than make capital expenditures. See \"Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.\" 14 RISKS RELATED TO THE EXCHANGE NOTES WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEBT AND INTEREST PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY RESTRICT OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EXCHANGE NOTES. We have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders' equity. As of September 29, 2002, we had approximately $611.1 million of outstanding debt and approximately $385.4 million of shareholders' equity. Approximately $260.0 million of our debt is variable rate debt and the effect of a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease such total annual interest expense by approximately $2.6 million. After giving effect to the intended application of proceeds from the additional issuance, and assuming none of the net proceeds from the additional issuance are used for debt repayment, our current annual debt service payment obligations would have been approximately $56.4 million on that basis. See \"Use of Proceeds.\" Amounts due under operating lease arrangements in the next year as of September 29, 2002 are approximately $7.6 million. The degree to which we are leveraged will have important consequences, including the following: o our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, business development efforts or general corporate purposes may be impaired; o a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes, including our obligations to pay rent in respect of our significant operating leases; o our operations are restricted by our debt instruments, which contain material financial and operating covenants, and those restrictions will limit, among other things, our ability to borrow money in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, rent expense or other purposes; o indebtedness under our credit facility and the financing cost associated with our accounts receivable facility are at variable rates of interest, which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates; o our leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage as compared with our less leveraged competitors; o our substantial degree of leverage will make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in any of our businesses; and o our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited. We expect to incur significant additional debt in pursuit of our acquisition strategies and our debt instruments may permit us to do so. At September 29, 2002 after giving effect to the additional issuance, the documents governing the terms of our indebtedness would have permitted us to incur up to an additional approximate $36.4 million in the aggregate of additional indebtedness, all of which could be senior indebtedness. Our ability to service our debt and other obligations will depend on our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow, and future financings may not be available to provide sufficient net proceeds, to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategies. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources.\" RESTRICTIONS IN OUR CREDIT FACILITY AND UNDER THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE EXCHANGE NOTES LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS. Our credit facility and the indenture governing the exchange notes contain covenants that restrict our ability to: o pay dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock; 15 o incur additional indebtedness and grant liens; o make acquisitions and joint venture investments; o sell assets; and o make capital expenditures. Our credit facility also requires us to comply with financial covenants relating to, among other things, interest coverage and leverage. In addition, our accounts receivable facility contains covenants similar to those in our credit facility and include requirements regarding the purchase and sale of receivables. We may not be able to satisfy these covenants in the future or be able to pursue our new business strategies within the constraints of these covenants. If we cannot comply with these covenants, we will be in default and unable to access required liquidity from our revolving credit and accounts receivable facilities and unable to make payments in respect of the notes. In addition, our accounts receivable facility contains concentration limits with respect to the percentage of receivables we can sell from any particular customer. The concentration limits are based on the credit ratings of each particular customer. We may implement credit hedging strategies to offset this risk. However, if one or more of our customers were to have its credit ratings downgraded, then the amount of receivables of such customer that we could sell may decrease and our business could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to comply with our covenants may be affected by prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of our covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility or under the indenture governing the exchange notes, which could cause an event of default under our accounts receivable facility and our equipment lease financing. Such breach would permit the lenders to declare all amounts borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued interest, and the commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of credit under our credit facility could be terminated. In addition, such breach may cause a termination of our accounts receivable facility and of our various sale-leaseback facilities. If we were unable to secure a waiver from our lenders or repay our credit facility indebtedness, our secured lenders could proceed against their collateral and our lessors could prevent us from using our valuable facilities and equipment that are under lease. We do not presently expect that alternative sources of financing will be available to us under these circumstances or available on attractive terms. YOUR RIGHT TO RECEIVE PAYMENT ON THE EXCHANGE NOTES IS JUNIOR TO THE RIGHT OF THE HOLDERS OF ALL OF OUR EXISTING SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS AND POSSIBLY TO ALL OF OUR FUTURE BORROWINGS. The exchange notes are general unsecured obligations, junior in right of payment to all of our existing senior indebtedness, including indebtedness under our credit facility, and all of our future borrowings, except any future indebtedness that expressly provides that it ranks equally with, or is subordinated in right of payment to, the notes. As of September 29, 2002, the notes and the related guarantees then outstanding were effectively subordinated to approximately $260 million of senior secured indebtedness under our credit facility. As a result, upon any distribution to our creditors in a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding relating to us or our property, the holders of our senior indebtedness will be entitled to be paid in full in cash before any payment may be made with respect to the notes. In addition, all payments on the exchange notes will be blocked in the event of a payment default on senior indebtedness and may be blocked for up to 179 of 360 consecutive days in the event of certain non-payment defaults on designated senior indebtedness. In the event that we are declared bankrupt, become insolvent or are liquidated, reorganized or involved in a similar proceeding, holders of the exchange notes will participate with trade creditors and all other holders of our subordinated indebtedness in the assets remaining after we have paid all of the senior indebtedness. The indenture governing the exchange notes requires that amounts otherwise payable to holders of the exchange notes in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding be paid to holders of any remaining senior indebtedness instead. In any of these cases, our assets may be insufficient to pay all of our creditors, and holders of the exchange notes are likely to receive less, proportionally, if any, than holders of our senior indebtedness, including the lenders under our credit 16 facility. We may be permitted to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including senior indebtedness, in the future, under the terms of the indenture governing the exchange notes. YOUR RIGHT TO ENFORCE REMEDIES IS LIMITED BY THE RIGHTS OF SECURED CREDITORS, AND CLAIMS OF HOLDERS OF EXCHANGE NOTES WILL EFFECTIVELY RANK JUNIOR TO CLAIMS OF SECURED CREDITORS AND CLAIMS OF CREDITORS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. In addition to being subordinated to our senior indebtedness, the exchange notes are not secured by any of our assets. Our obligations under our credit facility are secured by substantially all of our owned assets and those of our subsidiary guarantors and a pledge of the capital stock of each guarantor and 65% of the capital stock of our first tier foreign subsidiaries. If we become insolvent or are liquidated, or if payment under our credit facility is accelerated, the lenders under our credit facility would be entitled to exercise the remedies available to a secured lender under applicable law. Therefore, our bank lenders or other secured creditors have a claim on our assets before holders of the exchange notes. YOUR RIGHT TO RECEIVE PAYMENT ON THE EXCHANGE NOTES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A BANKRUPTCY, LIQUIDATION OR REORGANIZATION OF ONE OF OUR NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES. Only our domestic subsidiaries that also guarantee our obligations or are borrowers under the credit facility guarantee the exchange notes. This includes all of our domestic subsidiaries other than our receivables subsidiary. However, we have significant non-U.S. assets and operations. In the future, only subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our credit facility are required to guarantee our obligations under the exchange notes. The exchange notes are structurally subordinated to all the liabilities of all our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the exchange notes. In the event of bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment on their claims from assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to us. Under some circumstances, the terms of the exchange notes will permit our non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional specified indebtedness. For the year ended December 31, 2001, our non-guarantor subsidiaries had net sales of approximately $89.2 million and net assets of approximately $107.0 million. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS, AND OUR FAILURE TO MEET THOSE OBLIGATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. As of September 29, 2002, we had operating leases for our 13 facilities and certain capital equipment. Our annual rent expense under these leases is approximately $7.6 million. Our failure to pay our rental obligations under such leases could constitute a default under the leases and would allow the landlord under the leases to pursue any remedy available to the landlord, which would include taking possession of our machinery and equipment and evicting us. In addition, these leases are categorized as operating leases and consequently are not considered indebtedness for purposes of our credit facility and the indenture governing the exchange notes. If at a later date, we or our auditors concluded that these operating leases should be treated as capitalized leases, then such leases would be considered indebtedness for balance sheet purposes and we may, as a result, be in default under our credit facility and the indenture governing the exhange notes. WE MAY BE PREVENTED FROM FINANCING, OR MAY BE UNABLE TO RAISE FUNDS NECESSARY TO FINANCE, THE CHANGE OF CONTROL OFFER REQUIRED BY THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE EXCHANGE NOTES. Upon certain change of control events, each holder of outstanding exchange notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of our exchange notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. Our ability to purchase the exchange notes upon a change of control event may be prohibited by the terms of our credit facility or future credit facilities. Future agreements may contain a similar provision. Certain change of control events will constitute events of default under our credit facility and termination events under our accounts receivable facility and, absent a consent or waiver, we would be required to repay all amounts owed by us under our credit facility and wind down our accounts receivable facility. We may not be able to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility or replace our accounts receivable facility. Any requirement to offer to purchase any outstanding exchange notes may result in 17 us having to generate cash from new borrowings or asset sales, and having to refinance other debt or obtain necessary consents under our other debt agreements to repurchase the exchange notes, which we may not be able to do. In such case, our failure to purchase exchange notes following a change of control would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the exchange notes which would, in turn, constitute a default under our credit facility. In addition, even if we were able to refinance such debt, such financing may be on terms unfavorable to us. FEDERAL AND STATE STATUTES ALLOW COURTS, UNDER SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES, TO VOID GUARANTEES AND REQUIRE HOLDERS OF EXCHANGE NOTES TO RETURN PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM GUARANTORS. Creditors of any business are protected by fraudulent conveyance laws which differ among various jurisdictions, and these laws may apply to the issuance of the guarantees by our subsidiaries. A guarantee may be voided by a court, or subordinated to the claims of other creditors, if o that guarantee was incurred by a subsidiary with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor of the subsidiary, or o that subsidiary did not receive fair consideration, or reasonably equivalent value, for issuing its guarantee, and the subsidiary -- was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the guarantee, -- was engaged or about to engage in a business or transaction for which the remaining assets of the subsidiary constituted unreasonably small capital, or -- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as they matured. We cannot be certain as to the standard that a court would use to determine whether the guarantor subsidiaries were solvent upon issuance of the guarantee or, regardless of the actual standard applied by the court, that the issuance of the guarantee of the exchange notes would not be voided. If a guarantee of a subsidiary was voided as a fraudulent conveyance or held unenforceable for any other reason, holders of the exchange notes would be solely our creditors and creditors of our other subsidiaries that have guaranteed the exchange notes. The notes then would be effectively subordinated to all obligations of that subsidiary. Since we are a holding company, if all guarantees were voided, that would result in the holder of exchange notes having claims that would not be paid prior to substantially all of the other debt and liabilities of the consolidated group of entities. To the extent that the claims of the holders of the exchange notes against any subsidiary were subordinated in favor of other creditors of such subsidiary, such other creditors would be entitled to be paid in full before any payment could be made on the notes. If one or more of the guarantees are voided or subordinated, there may not be sufficient assets remaining to satisfy the claims of holders of the exchange notes after providing for all prior claims. In addition, the dividend paid to Metaldyne in connection with the transactions is itself subject to challenge as a fraudulent conveyance if it were determined that we were insolvent. Based upon financial and other information, we believe that the exchange notes and the guarantees are being incurred for proper purposes and in good faith and that we are and each subsidiary is solvent and will continue to be solvent after this offering is completed, will have sufficient capital for carrying on its business after such issuance and will be able to pay its debts as they mature. A court reviewing these matters may not agree with us. A legal challenge to a guarantee on fraudulent conveyance grounds may focus on the benefits, if any, realized by the subsidiary as a result of our issuance of the exchange notes. YOU CANNOT BE SURE AN ACTIVE TRADING MARKET FOR THE EXCHANGE NOTES WILL DEVELOP. There has previously been only a limited secondary market, and no public market, for the outstanding notes. The exchange notes are an exchange issue of securities, have no established trading market, and may not be widely distributed. We do not intend to list the exchange notes on any national securities exchange or the Nasdaq stock market or to seek the admission thereof to trading on any automated quotation system. An active public or other market may not develop for the 18 exchange notes and the trading market for the exchange notes may be illiquid. If a trading market does not develop or is not maintained, holders of the exchange notes may experience difficulty in reselling the exchange notes or may be unable to sell them at all. If a market for the exchange notes develops, any such market may be discontinued at any time. If a public trading market develops for the exchange notes, future trading prices of the exchange notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our results of operations and the market for similar securities, and the price at which the holders of exchange notes will be able to sell such exchange notes is uncertain and the exchange notes could trade at a premium or discount to their purchase price or face value. Depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and other factors, including our financial condition, the exchange notes may trade at a discount from their principal amount. IF YOU DO NOT PROPERLY TENDER YOUR OUTSTANDING NOTES, WE MAY NOT ACCEPT YOUR OUTSTANDING NOTES AND THE TRADING MARKET FOR THEM MAY BE LIMITED. We will issue new notes under this exchange offer only after a timely receipt of your outstanding notes, a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal and all other required documents. Therefore, if you want to tender your outstanding notes, please allow sufficient time to ensure timely delivery. If we do not receive your outstanding notes, Letter of Transmittal and other required documents by the expiration date of the exchange offer, we will not accept your outstanding notes for exchange. We are under no duty to give notification of defects or irregularities with respect to the tenders of outstanding notes for exchange. If there are defects or irregularities with respect to your tender of outstanding notes, we will not accept your outstanding notes for exchange. YOU MAY PARTICIPATE IN THE EXCHANGE OFFER ONLY IF YOU MEET THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS. Based on interpretations by the Commission staff, as set forth in no-action letters the Commission issued to third parties, we believe that you may offer for resale, resell and otherwise transfer the exchange notes without compliance with the registration and prospectus delivery provisions of the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. These limitations include the following: o you are not our \"affiliate\" within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act; o you acquire your exchange notes in the ordinary course of your business; and o you have no arrangement with any person to participate in the distribution of such exchange notes. However, we have not submitted a no-action letter to the Commission regarding this exchange offer and the Commission may not make a similar determination with respect to the exchange offer as in such other circumstances. If you are our affiliate, engage in or intend to engage in or have any arrangement or understanding with respect to a distribution of the exchange notes that you or any person will acquire pursuant to the exchange offer, you may not rely on the applicable interpretations of the staff of the Commission; you must also comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale transaction. RESALES OF THE EXCHANGE NOTES MAY BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER RESTRICTIONS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS. Each broker-dealer that receives exchange notes for its own account pursuant to the exchange offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements under the Securities Act in connection with any resale of such exchange notes. We have agreed to use our best efforts to make this prospectus available to any participating broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale. See \"Plan of Distribution\" below. However to comply with the securities laws of certain jurisdictions, if applicable, you may not offer or sell the exchange notes unless someone has registered or qualified them for sale in such jurisdictions or an exemption from registration or qualification is available. 19 USE OF PROCEEDS We will receive no cash proceeds from the exchange offer. We intend the exchange offer to satisfy some of our obligations under our registration rights agreements for the notes. We will issue exchange notes in exchange for outstanding notes in the same principal amount, and for the same terms and form as the outstanding notes, except that there will be no registration rights or liquidated damages relating to the exchange notes. The outstanding notes that holders surrender in exchange for the exchange notes will be retired and canceled and cannot be reissued. Accordingly, we will not incur any new debt by issuing the exchange notes. The net proceeds from the original offering and the additional issuance were approximately $339.1 million and approximately $84.1 million, respectively. The proceeds from the original offering were used to consummate the transactions. The table below sets forth the sources and uses of funds for the transactions.\n\nSOURCES USES ------- ---- (IN MILLIONS) Revolving credit facility loans(1) ............ $ -- Debt repayment and repurchase of Term loan facility ............................ 260.0 TriMas receivables(4) ............... $ 501.5 Receivables facility sale proceeds(2) ......... -- Cash dividend to Metaldyne .......... 338.1 Fees and expenses ................... 35.4 Notes originally offered ...................... 350.0 ------- Common stock(3) ............................... 265.0 ------- Total sources of funds ........................ $ 875.0 Total uses of funds ................. $ 875.0 ======== =======\n\n- ---------- (1) We have a $150 million revolving credit facility that we did not utilize at closing. (2) We have a $125 million receivables purchase facility that we did not utilize at closing. (3) Does not include $120 million in common stock retained by Metaldyne and a warrant to purchase common stock received by Metaldyne as a dividend. (4) Reflects debt we owed to the lenders under the Metaldyne credit facility of approximately $427 million and our receivables repurchased of approximately $74.5 million. Such debt was repaid and receivables were repurchased at closing. See note (2) above. We intend to use the net proceeds from the additional issuance for general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and debt repayment, and to use up to $20.0 million of the net proceeds to repurchase a portion of our common stock owned by Metaldyne. We received a consent from our senior lenders to permit us to effect this stock repurchase and to hold the balance of the cash proceeds until June 29, 2003 pending use for any potential permitted acquisitions. If we do not utilize the portion of the net proceeds being held for acquisitions or the stock repurchase by June 29, 2003, we may apply some of the net proceeds to repay a portion of our term credit facility. Pending the application of proceeds, we have and will continue to invest the net proceeds in short-term, quality instruments. 20 CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth our unaudited cash and cash equivalents and capitalization as of September 29, 2002 on an actual and as adjusted basis for the additional issuance.

PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS 1. As a result of the transactions, Metaldyne no longer provides a guarantee on certain TriMas leases. The existence of the guarantee required that the leases be accounted for as capitalized leases in periods prior to June 6, 2002. As a result of the guarantee release, these leases are now accounted for as operating leases. This adjustment reflects the recording of $0.9 million of rent expense offset by a reduction of $0.3 million of capitalized lease asset amortization expense for the nine months ended September 29, 2002. An additional add-back of $0.9 million related to interest expense on the capitalized lease obligation for the nine months ended September 29, 2002 is included in adjustment 3 below as a result of eliminating this interest expense. 2. Pro forma adjustment to reflect ongoing corporate operating costs and related party contractual arrangements with Heartland and Metaldyne. Subsequent to June 6, 2002, certain stand-alone operating costs and related party contract costs have been recorded by the Company. The pro forma adjus"
