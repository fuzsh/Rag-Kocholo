HISTORY

Founded in 1947 in Columbus, Georgia, as Steel Builders, Inc., a small regional fabricator taking part in the post-World War II economic boom, the Company was renamed American Buildings Company and relocated in 1964 to its current headquarters in Eufaula, Alabama. Over the years, American has enjoyed a dynamic growth history, as dynamic as the metal buildings industry itself. In 2007, American Buildings Company was acquired by Nucor Corporation, a Fortune 500 Company. Nucor and affiliates are manufacturers of steel products, with operating facilities primarily in the U.S. and Canada.

Nucor is the largest steel producer in the United States and has not experienced a layoff due to lack of work in over 40 years. Nucor was recently honored by Forbes Magazine as the number one company in America’s Best Big Companies Honor Roll and by Business Ethics magazine’s 100 Best Corporate Citizens list. Nucor is also North America’s largest recycler of steel.

The development of American over the years has been changed due to its continuous entrepreneurial drive and spirit. American’s advancement from its simple beginnings to its present position as one of the industry’s leading manufacturers is based on the expansion of its Builder network, which presently extends across the U.S., Canada and Caribbean. American supports its business with technical and customer service centers as well as fabrication facilities strategically located across the U.S., making it a truly nationwide manufacturer.

ENVIRONMENTAL

GREEN BUILDING IS SERIOUS BUSINESS

ABC is committed to an effective environmental policy that helps us manage and reduce our impact on the world around us. That’s why we are proud to announce that all four ABC divisions have achieved ISO 14001 certification.

As an ISO 14001 certified manufacturer, American Buildings Company is dedicated to protecting our environment and reducing waste. Every ABC teammate is responsible for environmental protection. We also require contractors, vendors and suppliers to comply with applicable environmental laws.

What Is ISO 14001?

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 is a standard for Environmental Management Systems (EMS) that applies to all businesses, regardless of size, location or income. The standard aims to continually reduce the environmental footprint of a business and to decrease the pollution and waste a business produces. The most recent version of ISO 14001 was released in 2004 by the ISO, which has representation from committees all over the world.

A Rigorous Process

A company saying it is committed to environmental and sustainable concepts is one thing. Achieving ISO 14001 certification it is quite another.

In order for an organization to be awarded an ISO 14001 certificate it must be externally audited by an accredited audit firm. For ABC, this rigorous, demanding process took a full year and included education and training for every team member.

We invested more than 10,000 hours to ensure all four divisions would reach the goal. The process was challenging, to say the least, but an extremely worthwhile investment as it taught us how to better use resources and protect the environment.

Why Is ABC Committed To EMS?

Implementing Environmental Management Systems (EMS) yields both business and environmental benefits, including:

· Improved environmental performance

· Enhanced, sustainable compliance

· Prevention of pollution and conservation of resources

· Reduced risks

· Satisfied customer demand for EMD requirements

· Increased efficiency

· Reduced costs

· Enhanced employee morale

· Greater employee awareness of environmental issues and responsibilities

· Keeping It Green

To continually improve the effectiveness of our Environmental Management System, ABC is:

· Pursuing pollution prevention and waste minimization opportunities

· Investigating and developing technologies and operations that improve environmental performance

· Regularly evaluating the Environmental Management System and making ongoing improvements

WHAT IS BIM?

Building Information Modeling is the process of generating and managing building data and its various components throughout the building’s life cycle. Using three dimensional, real-time, dynamic building modeling software to increase productivity in building design and construction, the process produces the Building Information Model.

Unlike past 3D innovations in the building industry, BIM is more than a conceptual modeling tool. BIM encompasses building geometry, spatial relationships, geographic information, quantities and properties of building components. When the modeling software is used by manufacturers and principles involved in a building project, the resulting BIM is usable for fabrication. It involves ground-up reality rather than top-down theory.

Why use BIM?

American Buildings Company and Paulsan Construction are pairing their proven track record of quality and service with the future of 3D modeling to give Builders, general contractors, engineers and architects an edge over competitors in the market. Providing customers with a modeling system that can display an exact replica of their building leads to confidence and peace of mind for the life cycle of the project.

Digital prototype

The BIM process produces a digital prototype of your project, allowing you to build it virtually before building it in reality. A BIM project is not “drawn” in the traditional sense; rather it’s “built” digitally as a database in BIM software. Instead of having to look at hundreds or thousands of separate drawings, schedules, specs and cut sheets for all the information on a particular element, all the pertinent information is built into the object in the BIM.

BIM BENEFITS

BIM is the choice of leading Builders, Architects, Fabricators, Erectors, Engineers, Designers, Manufacturers and Owners because it:

· Allows for easier coordination of various software and project personnel through integrated Project Delivery (IPD) systems

· Serves as a significant resource for erectors

· Produces a working model usable for fabrication

· Leads to increased productivity

· Enables improved communication across project team members, which can significantly reduce change order costs

· Enhances quality control, including clash detection

· Provides comprehensive life-cycle management

TEKLA BIM SOFTWARE

Tekla BIM software for interoperability

American Buildings Company proudly partners with Tekla, a leading modeling software solutions provider. Utilizing Tekla Structures as a BIM software solution, ABC has ensured the interoperability of 3D with 2D systems to verify that all modeling is cohesive. Tekla Structures makes it possible to share model and drawing information with all IFC-compliant architectural modeling programs, creating open collaboration and interoperability and 3D building information models that can be utilized and shared by all buildings and construction disciplines.

Tekla BIMsight is a free software application for building information model-based project cooperation. With Tekla BIMsight everyone involved with a project is able to view the BIM, at no charge. Enabled for Window-based tablet devices, Tekla BIMsight is available for downloading at www.teklabimsight.com .

Tekla Structures provides an accurate, detailed, intelligent and data-rich 3D building inforamtion modeling environment.

A unique XML link between Tekla Structures and Graphisoft ArchiCAD, allows architects and engineers to share and coordinate project information. Tekla software supports legacy formats, such as DGN and DWG with an AutoCAD drawing export, allowing engineers to create DWG files. The drawings can then be imported into the architectural drawing environment for production or referencing.
