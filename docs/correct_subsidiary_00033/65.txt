1. Nucor Executive Summary Strengthen our position as a low cost producer. The objective of a company using a low–cost provider strategy is to sell its products at the lowest possible price to attract customers. This is known as a price advantage. Companies using this strategy will typically earn low margins but achieve high sales volumes. Low–cost providers aim their products at the broad market, making them appeal to as many consumers as possible to achieve high sales volume. To achieve a low–cost edge over rivals, a firm's cumulative costs across its overall value chain must be lower than competitors' cumulative costs. There are two major avenues for accomplishing this: 1. Performing essential value chain activities more cost–effectively than rivals 2. Revamping the firm's overall value chain to eliminate or bypass some cost–producing activities. ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Nucor's sheet steel mills experienced higher margins and capacity utilization rates compared to the previous year. The company's raw materials team did excellent work to optimize iron unit costs for their steel mills, maintaining Nucor's position as the low cost producer. In 2016, Nucor also took an important step in advancing their raw materials strategy. A key to the long–term success of this strategy is access to low cost natural gas. To that end, in the third quarter of 2016 they concluded several transactions related to their natural gas supply agreements with Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc., which will result in a lower cost and more flexible natural hedge against higher natural gas costs for their Louisiana Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) facility and their core steel making ...

3. Nucor: Company Overview Question 1 Gross profit margin Gross profit margin is simply gross income (revenue less cost of goods sold) divided by net revenue. The ratio reflects pricing decisions and product costs. The gross margin for the company shows that % of revenues generated by the firm are used to pay for the cost of goods sold. For most firms, gross profit margin will suffer as competition increases. If a company has a higher gross profit margin than is typical of its industry, it likely holds a competitive advantage in quality, perception or branding, enabling the firm to charge more for its products. This means that Nucor holds a better competitive advantage than US Steel in the market. Alternatively, the firm may also hold a competitive advantage in product costs due to efficient production techniques or economies of scale. If a company is a first mover and has high enough margins, competitors will look for ways to enter the marketplace, which typically forces margins downward. ...

Operating margin examines the relationship between sales and management–controlled costs.

On one hand, although demand for steel had declined in recent years as noted above, it was not predicted to decline further as of 1986. On the other hand, with the advent of materials such as aluminum, plastic, and composite materials, especially in automobile industry, the threat of substitutes in the market was on the rise. New Entrants – Notwithstanding that 36 companies were competing in the mini–mill industry, much of the market was controlled by the top five, the second of which was Nucor. With competition levels high in this industry and with costly barriers to entry (i.e., building a steel plant), the prospect of new entrants facing Nucor was relatively low. Degree of Rivalry – The degree of rivalry facing Nucor was high, not only in light of domestic competition, but particularly due to vigorous price–competition from abroad, and –as a general proposition – the relative lack of differentiation in the product itself. The key to Nucor's relative prosperity in this industry was its competitive advantages over integrated steelmakers and other mini–mills: Technology – Nucor had a practice of constantly upgrading its facilities. Since the early 1970s, Nucor built or rebuilt at least one steelmaking or fabrication facility each year. This ensured that it was using the most current technological improvements, which thereby helped reduce its ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...

Finally, Samuel Siegel, an accountant with Nuclear (and friend of Iverson) who had actively been looking to leave the company, informed the Board of Directors he would remain with the company under two conditions: Iverson would become President and he (Siegel) would become Chief Financial Officer, conditions the Board quickly accepted. [edit]The Nucor Era Iverson and Siegel quickly reorganized Nuclear around its only profitable business, steel–fabricator Vulcraft. All other businesses were either sold or liquidated. The company moved its headquarters yet again, this time to Charlotte, North Carolina in 1966, to be closer to its main Vulcraft plant. Unable to get favorable prices from American steel manufacturers, and unhappy with the imported steel available at the time, Iverson (a metallurgist by training) decided to integrate Nuclear backwards into steel making by building its first steel bar mill in Darlington, South Carolina in 1968. The company chose to purchase an electric arc furnace, which was far cheaper than the traditional steel blast furnace, courtesy of a US $6,000,000 bank loan from Wachovia.

Essentially, scrap metal and raw iron ore are intangible products, in that there are no substitutes and steel manufacturers are forced to pay the prices that suppliers offer. Again, company size helps here where essentially it's the bigger the better. Suppliers will often be more inclined to sell to larger steel manufactures as order quantities are higher. The third part of the model is the bargaining power of buyers. Similarly to the bargaining power of suppliers, the power of buyers is high here as well. As previously mentioned, due to the lack of product differentiation, cost is the key driver. Competition from foreign steel manufacturers is fierce and steel imports in the United States are high due to steel often being able to be produced and sold cheaper then domestically. Because of this, buyers put increased pressure on Nucor who must strive to be as cost effective as possible. It is also very important to try to get large accounts and then provide necessary attention in order to sustain them. A great portion of steel profits are derived from these large buyers. A couple key examples are large scale construction and the automobile industry. It's critical for steel manufactures such as Nucor to try to establish strong relationships with these buyers to generate large, long–term profits. Finally, switching costs for buyers is low. Buyers can import steel or purchase from another domestic company with lower prices. In order to ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...

20. Nucor at a Crossroads Nucor at a Crossroads Case Analysis In 1986, three distinct segments defined the U.S. steel industry; integrated steel mills, mini–mills, and specialty steel makers. The integrated mills have the capacity to produce a maximum of 107 million tons of steel per year, mini–mills produced a maximum of 21 million tons of capacity a year, and the nation's specialty steel makers could produce a maximum capacity of 5 million tons of stainless and specialty grades of steel. This leads to a total capacity of 133 million tons of production per year. In 1986, the market consumed only 70 million tons of steel, leaving 33 million tons unused. Nucor is at a crossroads. It faces a saturated market suffering from significant overcapacity. Nucor's ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Fourth, base wages were lower but incentives were higher than average, and direct communication on expectation vs. performance provided feedback on compensation. Also, during down times, officers and CEO pay dropped dramatically while average workers did not. This led to lower employee turnover 1–5% vs. 5–10% for competitors. Fifth, Nucor's hiring practices focused on making sure that they focused on hiring people based on potential, not experience. Finally, Nucor's business hierarchy was different– mostly flat, resulting in less bureaucracy and more productivity per worker. In short, many of these advantages led to Nucor becoming the second most productive steel maker per employee in the world due by 1985. Thin–slab casting was a proposed technique for mini–mills to fill orders for flat sheet steel, a segment that accounted for approximately half of the U.S. steel industry. To expand its steel market share, Nucor needed to enter the flat sheet segment. In the thin–slab casting business, Nucor would initially compete with international firms from Canada and Japan that provided high quality flat sheet steel, and cheap flat sheet steel providers in newly industrialized nations. Barriers to entry would include large capital expenditures making new entrants cost prohibitive, but not impossible as the barrier is small comparative to the overall costs for steel manufacturing. ...

A significant percentage of the steel sold to service centers found its way to end–users in the automotive sector and the appliance and equipment industries. Taken together, these three customer groups accounted for half of total domestic shipments and three–quarters of the shipments of flat sheet. Service centers emphasized the most basic form of flat sheet, hot–rolled sheet, whereas the others' direct purchases were weighted toward cold–rolled and coated sheet that had been subjected to further primary processing. Construction accounted for another one–tenth of shipments of all steel mill products and of flat sheet. Price, quality and dependability were the three most important buyer purchasing criteria. Uncompetitive pricing was probably the major reason U.S. steelmakers had lost ground to imports. Integrated steelmakers had been criticized, in particular, for charging excessive premia in periods of tight supply, pressing buyers to purchase higher–grade steel than they needed, requiring minimum orders that were too large for many buyers and arbitrarily favoring some buyers over others.

Even the sales are increasing (change is 11.7%), revenues are declining significantly (change is 7.6%) comparing to prior year. Worldwide excess of steel capacity have dropped composite sales price per ton for Nucor to $340. It was a big price–cutting because price per ton has been standing around $430 for the last five years. Therefore, Nucor's projected EBIT for the year 2001 would be about 60% less than in 2000.

Corporate staff was kept to a minimum. All decisions dealing with operations were delegated to the individual plants. Iverson believed that the managers closest to the action should be given the responsibility to develop plans to allow the plants, and the firm, to adapt to any changes in the environment. Iverson also gave plant–level mangers the authority to make and implement the decisions necessary to make these adaptations. Each plant manager gave a brief monthly report to headquarters and received a report comparing the divisions' performance. Major expenditures and changes were made by consensus at the periodic meetings of all plant and corporate managers. Iverson took pride in the lean corporate structure. But the lack of corporate staff appeared to become a problem as Nucor expanded. By 1994 the company was operating 16 plants, and the flat–rolled steel plants increased the diversity of the operations reporting to the president.
