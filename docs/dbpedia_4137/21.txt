The most significant collection of masterpieces by 16th century artist Veronese ever to be displayed in the U.K. are currently on view at the National Gallery in London for the exhibit “Veronese: Magnificence in Renaissance Venice.”

As described by the National Gallery, “Veronese's paintings are magnificent visions of opulence, spectacle and colour. Having once adorned churches, palaces, villas and public buildings throughout the Veneto region, they are inseparable from our vision of Renaissance Venice. The exhibition is a visual feast of around 50 of these works."

Many paintings are so big that they required a re-hang of the Gallery’s collection; some are reunited in the exhibition for the first time in hundreds of years. The loans are coming from across the world.

Veronese, born Paolo Caliari (1528–1588), was born in Verona, hence the name, and he was one of the most renowned and sought-after artists working in Venice in the 16th century. He created works ranging from complex frescoes to altarpieces, devotional paintings, mythological, allegorical and historical pictures, and portraits.

The exhibition is open until June 15, 2014.
