        "text": "July 22\n\nfrom The Golden Legend1\n\nMary is interpreted amarum mare, bitter sea, or light-giver, or enlightened. By these three things are understood the three best parts which she chose, namely the part of penance, the part of inward contemplation, and the part of heavenly glory. Hence we understand the Lord's words: 'Mary hath chosen the best part, which shall not be taken away from her.' The first part indeed shall not be taken away from her by reason of its end, which is the pursuit of blessedness, nor the second, by reason of its continuousness, because it will be continued in the contemplation of Heaven, nor the third by reason of its eternity. Since therefore she chose the best part of penance, she is called 'bitter sea,' because in her repentance she had much bitterness, as is manifest, because she shed so many tears that she washed the Lord's feet therewith. Since she chose the best part of interior contemplation, she is called 'light-giver,' because therein she drank avidly that which afterward she poured out in abundance; therein she received the light, with which afterward she enlightened others. And since she chose the best part of heavenly glory, she is called 'enlightened,' because already she is enlightened with the light of perfect knowledge in her mind, and she will be enlightened with the light of glory in her body.\n\nMagdalen is the same as manens rea, remaining in guilt, or means armed, or unconquered, or magnificent, and by these we understand what she was before her conversion, in her conversion, and after her conversion. For before her conversion she remained in her guilt, being laden with the debt of eternal punishment; in her conversion she was both armed and unconquered, by means of the armament of penance, because she put on the excellent armor of penance, devising an immolation of herself to atone for each of the pleasures she had enjoyed; after her conversion she was magnificent by the superabundance of grace, because where sin abounded, grace did more abound.\n\nMary Magdalen was bom of parents who were of noble station, and came of royal lineage. Her father was called Syrus, and her mother Eucharia. Together with her brother Lazarus and her sister Martha, she was the possessor of the fortified town of Magdala near Genezareth, of Bethany close by Jerusalem, and of a large section of Jerusalem itself; but these vast possessions were so divided that Lazarus held the section of Jerusalem, Martha retained Bethany, and Magdala belonged to Mary, who thus came by the surname of Magdalen. And since Magdalen gave herself wholly to the pleasures of the senses, and Lazarus served in the army, the prudent Martha was entrusted with the stewardship of her brother's and sister's properties. All three, moreover, sold their goods after Lord's Ascension, and laid the price at the feet of the apostles.\n\nAs rich as Mary was, she was no less beautiful; and so entirely had she abandoned her body to pleasure that she was no longer, called by any other name than 'the sinner.' But when Jesus was journeying about the country preaching, she learned one day, by divine inspiration, that He sat at meat in the house of Simon the Leper. Thither she ran at once, but, not daring to mingle with His disciples, she stayed apart. And she washed the Lord's feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and anointed them with precious ointment: for the warmth of the climate compelled the people of this region to use water and ointment several times a day. And when Simon the Pharisee was astonished to see that a prophet suffered himself to be touched by a woman of evil life, Our Lord reproached him for his proud righteousness, and said, that all this woman's sins were forgiven her, because she loved much.\n\nAnd thenceforward there was no grace that He refused her, nor any mark of affection that He withheld from her. He drove seven devils out of her, admitted her to His friendship, condescended to dwell in her house, and was pleased to defend her whenever occasion arose. He defended her before the Pharisee who accused her of being unclean, and before her sister Martha, who charged her, with idleness, and before Judas, who reproached her for her prodigality. And He could not see her in tears without Himself weeping. For love of her, He restored her brother to life after he had been dead four days. He cured Martha of an issue of blood which had suffered for seven years, and He chose Martha's serving-maid, Martilla, to utter the memorable words: 'Blessed is the womb that bore thee, and the paps that gave thee suck!' Magdalen also had the honour of being present at the death of Jesus, standing at the foot of the Cross: and it was she that anointed His body with sweet spices after His death, and who stayed at the sepulchre when all the disciples went away. And to her first the risen Jesus appeared, and made her apostle to the apostles.\n\nIn the fourteenth year after the Passion and Ascension of Our Lord, the disciples went out into the divers regions of the earth to sow the word of God; and Saint Peter entrusted Mary Magdalen to Saint Maximinus, one of the seventy-two disciples of the Lord. Then Saint Maximinus, Mary Magdalen, Lazarus, Martha, Martilla, and Saint Cedonius, the man born blind who had been cured by Jesus, together with still other Christians, were thrown by the infidels into a ship without a rudder and launched into the deep, in the hope that in this way they would all be drowned at once. But the ship was guided by the power of God, and made port in good estate at Marseilles. There no one would give shelter to the newcomers, who were forced to take refuge beneath the porch of a pagan temple. And when Mary Magdalen saw the pagans going into their temple to offer sacrifice to their gods, she arose with calm mien and prudent tongue, and began to draw them away from the worship of the idols and to preach Christ to them. And all wondered at her, not only for her beauty but for her eloquence, which eloquence was not indeed a matter of surprise on lips that had touched the Lord's feet."
