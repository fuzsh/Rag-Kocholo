        "meta_description": "<b>The Artist:</b> The biography of Johann Liss is that of a restless outsider trained in Holstein (in modern north Germany)—outside the cosmopolitan centers of seventeenth-century art. Paradoxically, being an outsider gave him a beneficial critical distance when, through his travels, he came into contact with many of the leading artists of his day, from Hendrick Goltzius, Peter Paul Rubens, and Jacob Jordaens to the principal followers of Caravaggio and the pupils of Annibale Carracci",

        "text": "Born in northern Germany but active in Amsterdam, Rome, and Venice, Liss cultivated his style as he encountered different influences on his travels. He probably made this painting in Venice, and it responds to the sensuality and luscious brushwork of that city’s artistic tradition. Mary Magdalen, often invoked as a symbol of penance, is shown cradling a skull in her arms and rejecting worldly riches, offered by the figure on the left, in favor of an angel who bears the palm of victory. Her back-tilted head, half-closed eyes, and exposed breasts merge with the lush paint handling in an almost shocking eroticism."
