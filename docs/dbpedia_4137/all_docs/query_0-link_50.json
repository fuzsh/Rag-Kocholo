Thanks to the National Gallery all Classic FM listeners will receive 25% off tickets, plus we're giving away five pairs of tickets away.\n\n25% off tickets to Veronese: Magnificence in Renaissance Venice. Click here to download your voucher.\n\nPaolo Veronese was one of the greatest painters of all time. He was based in Venice, and his art captures the opulence and splendour of Renaissance Italian life. His works were often painted on a grand scale with a theatrical feel, featuring a cast of sumptuously dressed and exquisitely painted characters. An esteemed colourist, Veronese’s paintings convey heightened emotions using dramatic reds, blues, greens and golds. Veronese is known as an ‘artist’s artist’, and he inspired Rubens, Watteau and Van Dyck.\n\nThis is the first major exhibition in the UK dedicated to Veronese. The show features around 50 works including altarpieces, mythological, allegorical and historical pictures, and portraits. With the unprecedented chance to see the artist’s greatest masterpieces assembled in one place, this exhibition offers a magnificent day out.\n\nVeronese: Magnificence in Renaissance Venice is sponsored by Credit Suisse and runs until the 15th of June.\n\nTo book tickets call 0844847 2409 or visit the National Gallery website.\n\nImage credit: Paolo Veronese, 'The Conversion of Mary Magdalene', about 1548 © The National Gallery, London"
