        "text": "“I don’t mind the blue bird,” says Nicholas Penny, the 64-year-old Director of the National Gallery, referring to the gigantic ultramarine cockerel visible through the window of his high-ceilinged corner office. More than 15 feet tall, this playful sculpture by the German artist Katharina Fritsch is the latest artwork temporarily to occupy the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square, in an ongoing series of commissions by contemporary artists.\n\n“But I’m not tremendously keen on what’s been done on the Fourth Plinth,” continues Penny, whose office is decorated with several unfashionable mezzotints that he began collecting as an undergraduate at Cambridge. “Public sculpture on a monumental scale is a very hard art form. It’s not very 20th or 21st century. Something sensational, ironic, or whimsical: all of these are inappropriate forms of public sculpture.” Why? “Because they are inherently un-monumental and un-serious.”\n\nOh dear, I think. What does he make, then, of David Shrigley’s proposal for Really Good, a massive bronze hand giving a thumb’s up that, it was announced last month [on Feb 7], will grace the plinth in 2016? “It looks to me like something pretty close to a big joke,” Penny says carefully. “So it’s witty. But do we want limericks being confused with epics? You know, there's room for witty, light verse. But to inflate it to the size of grand opera – which leads one naturally on to Veronese.”\n\nAh yes, of course. We have met not to discuss public sculpture but to consider the Italian Renaissance painter Paolo Veronese (1528-88), the subject of a major loan exhibition opening at the National Gallery later this month (March 19). Five years in the making, and featuring 50 works of art, including vast altarpieces as well as mythological pictures and portraits from all over the world, Veronese: Magnificence in Renaissance Venice will be the first exhibition devoted to the artist’s career ever mounted in Britain. This is surprising given that Veronese is often grouped together with Titian and Tintoretto as part of a “triumvirate” at the apex of 16th-century Venetian painting.\n\n“Veronese is not an unknown artist,” Penny says. “He is very well represented in the National Gallery [which boasts 10 paintings by him in its permanent collection] – so much so that you could say you begin to take him for granted. It seems to me that there is an opportunity to see him with fresh eyes. Every generation needs to understand really great artists in a new way.”\n\nWhat does Penny hope that visitors to the exhibition will discover about Veronese? “He is a very dramatic painter,” Penny replies. “That has been underestimated. He is also a very beautiful painter, even when he is also being dramatic. His impact on the subsequent history of art was huge, because he has always been a favourite painter of painters. He had imitators throughout the 17th century culminating in Sebastiano Ricci. Tiepolo’s style is a deliberately modified version of Veronese. Then he was a favourite painter of Delacroix and indeed of Renoir.”\n\nWhat did they admire about Veronese? “They always talked about his palette, his colour schemes, about what used to be called in English the 'carnations’: his beautiful painting of pearly flesh and blushing cheeks. He is a fantastic painter of the translucency of especially female flesh.”\n\nVeronese is also known for working on a very large scale. His famous painting The Feast in the House of Levi (1573), for instance, is nearly 42 feet across. Now in the Accademia in Venice, it started life as a monumental Last Supper. When the Inquisition took exception to the inclusion within the painting of German-looking soldiers and “buffoons”, Veronese was forced to alter it. Cannily, he changed nothing but the title, so that it referred to a less contentious biblical event.\n\nThe Feast in the House of Levi will not be travelling to London. Nor will other colossal compositions by Veronese such as The Marriage Feast at Cana (1562-63), which is the largest painting in the Louvre, and which Penny “didn’t even dream of asking [for], because we wouldn’t be able to fit it in a plane, on a truck, through the door and on the wall – it’s gigantic”. But there will be several important and enormous loans, including The Martyrdom of Saint George (c.1565), which is more than 14 feet tall, from the church of San Giorgio in Braida, Verona.\n\nAs a result, Penny took the exceptional decision to stage the exhibition not in the Sainsbury Wing, where temporary loan shows are usually put on, but in the main galleries. “We are mounting it there because the paintings need the light, space and gallery height. The last exhibition we did that involved the upstairs galleries was Velázquez in 2006. I don’t think we are going to do this more than once every 15 years or so.”\n\nThis is not only for reasons of cost – although Penny says that juggling the National Gallery’s permanent collection to make way for a temporary exhibition in this fashion is an expensive business. During my hour with him, it also becomes clear that he feels ambivalent about temporary exhibitions in general. “At the moment, there are far too many loan exhibitions in the world,” he says. “I would like there to be fewer for sure.” Why? “Because I think they have disrupted the balance between enjoying works of art on a repeated basis, [i.e.] enjoying the sense of a permanent collection, and the special exhibition where you understand a particular artist in depth. It’s a very difficult balance to keep. There’s always an excitement about a loan exhibition, but the exhibition mentality pushes art towards theatre.”\n\nToday we take so-called “blockbuster” exhibitions for granted – yet, as Penny is keen to point out, it is only relatively recently that the National Gallery began to stage them with regularity, following the construction of the Sainsbury Wing, which opened in 1991. Moreover, he says, “the majority of our visitors actually come to see the permanent collection – so it would be crazy of us to compromise its character by turning it into a kind of loan bank whereby we could just get more and more great pictures [for temporary exhibitions] from other institutions by lending our own. But if you don’t lend, you don’t borrow – that’s now quite clear.”\n\nHas he taken any steps to remedy the situation? “Yes,” Penny replies, his eyes shining. “When I became Director in 2008, we stopped having three big loan exhibitions per annum and went down to two. They were putting a tremendous strain on the institution.”\n\nPenny’s predecessor as Director, Charles Saumarez Smith, 59, who is now Secretary and chief executive of the Royal Academy of Arts, takes a different view. “There is an argument that big exhibitions consume a great deal of time, energy and resource, and that they take away from the presentation of a permanent collection,” he tells me. “But I like exhibitions. I’ve always been a bit sceptical of the argument that curators would be producing big catalogue raisonnés if only they weren’t concentrating on ephemeral exhibitions, because I think a great deal of scholarship and research goes into exhibitions.”\n\nOf course, you could say that the man running the Royal Academy would argue this, since the institution has a much smaller permanent collection than the National Gallery, as well as an abundance of exhibition space, which it needs to fill. “In some ways,” Saumarez Smith says, “the Royal Academy is the home of the blockbuster exhibition. When we did The Real Van Gogh: The Artist and His Letters [in 2010], it got more than 410,000 visitors. It was a blockbuster. But it also had a deeply serious purpose. I believe you get a different order of understanding of an artist by seeing their works together. I’m sure there are people who can go from place to place making comparisons by virtue of training and visual memory – but I prefer to see two works next door to one another.”\n\nOne argument often marshalled against temporary loan exhibitions is the risk of damaging rare and valuable works of art during transit. “We do send works of art by air freight,” says Penny, “but apart from the risks of aeroplanes crashing, which we all know about, with air travel, because of the security arrangements at airports, it is becoming more and more difficult to have exact control over what happens within cargo sheds and when works of art are put on the plane.”\n\nSaumarez Smith disagrees. “Works of art can be travelled extremely safely,” he says. “There are people who are anxious about the risk, and it is always said that it only requires one aeroplane to go down with a large number of Poussins and the whole ecology of the blockbuster exhibition will change – but so far that hasn’t happened.”\n\nOccasionally the blockbuster exhibition is said to be under threat, due to greater competition among institutions internationally for first-class loans, as well as spiralling costs. Is it becoming harder to mount them? “I’ve heard that at regular intervals for 20 years,” Penny says, “but I don’t think so, no. Actually, large, successful exhibitions will continue for some time.”\n\nOn this point, Saumarez Smith agrees. “All my lifetime people have been saying that the heyday of the great exhibition is over, but the reality is that there continue to be great exhibitions,” he says.\n\n“Yes, the international exhibition circuit is a global business now rather than a European and an American business. There are bigger demands from the Far East. But big exhibitions always have been very complicated operations, and they always will be.”"
