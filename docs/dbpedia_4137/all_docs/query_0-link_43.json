        "text": "In the history of art the term Triumvirate is used too loosely as a convenient means of establishing the importance of artists as the leaders of their day. For the Italian Renaissance we have Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael; for the Baroque, Rubens, Rembrandt and Van Dyck; for the late 20th century in England, Bacon, Freud and Hockney, and so on — useful to the lazy but inaccurate and misleading. Let us set aside the term’s ancient Roman origin in Antony, Octavian and the hapless Lepidus III, and ask the simple question: \"Why is Titian not in the Renaissance triumvirate?\" — Titian, who did more than any of his peers to elevate the gestural acts of the painter and the substance of paint itself. The lazy art historian’s immediate response is to invent a Venetian triumvirate with Titian as its head, and Tintoretto and Veronese his supporters. \"Where, then, are Giorgione and Giovanni Bellini?\" asks the first sceptical enquirer. \"And was Veronese even a Venetian?\" asks the second.\n\nNo. He was not. He was born in Verona, 50 miles away, in 1528, Paolo, the son of Gabriele Bazaro, a stonecutter from a family of stonecutters (if not quite sculptors, nor is this the lowly profession that the term perhaps implies), and Caterina, the illegitimate daughter of Antonio Caliari, of a local noble family. His father, it seems, handed on the family skills and taught him modelling in terracotta, but by the age of 13 he was described as a painter, the pupil of a local master, Antonio Badile IV (whose daughter he was to marry). At 16, Vasari has him as an apprentice with the better known Giovanni Battista Caroto, still in Verona. He did not move to Venice until 1553, when he was 25, but by then he had already had a number of commissions from Venetian patrons, and it is clear that Venetian influences far outweighed those of the city of his birth. The National Gallery has, alas, only one relevant example of work by a local painter, The Virgin and Child by Francesco Morone (NG 285), a prolific painter of no great distinction or modernity — but this painting is worth a glance if only as a benchmark for Veronese’s brilliance.\n\nIn Venice Paolo Bazaro became both Paolo Caliari (the noble name endowing him with social status) and Paolo Veronese (the man from Verona), by which name we know him best. He flourished, called his brother Benedetto (a decade his junior) to join his workshop in the production of sumptuous imagined masterpieces that reflected the realities of the rich in the Venice of his day, and trained his two elder sons, Gabriele and Carlo (or Carletto), to be his assistants and successors. In 1553 the newcomer had to discover a path of development between Titian, then approaching 70 yet still in his magnificent poetic prime (witness the two Diana Poesie of 1556-59 recently acquired by the National Gallery), and Tintoretto, born in 1518, fully fledged and soon to embark on his major pictorial cycles (for which the Gallery’s small St George and the Dragon of 1553 is a convenient synecdochism). As Titian continued to astonish until his dying day in 1576 and the unrelenting Tintoretto was to outlive him by six years, Veronese was up against formidable opposition.\n\nVeronese might have been overawed but he was not and the Gallery’s The Conversion of Mary Magdalene of c1548 proves that at the age of 20 or so he was precociously accomplished — not even Raphael had at that age achieved so sculpturally deep a group of figures densely packed in a restricted space, all active and united in their concentrated interest. A daring composition, it is unique in the scale of its figures relative to the pictorial space, its key player, the collapsed Magdalene, dead centre at the crossing of diagonals yet almost lost in shadow, light falling significantly on her bare breast and the strenuous gesture (completed) of breaking her jewelled necklace, Christ (the only still element) brilliantly lit behind her. Light flickers across the canvas from the glimpse of a sunlit courtyard on the left to, most prominently, the priest in white to the right energetically turning back to see; these two elements establish the pictorial depth of the composition.\n\nNothing here is dominated by the traditions of either Verona or Venice, and even the tone of the rich and varied colours of the costumes seems alien — is it foolish to wonder if young Paolo had visited Florence and been excited by the work (a generation earlier) of Rosso and Pontormo there? It is intriguing that in so early a work he already emphatically centres his composition, gives it an architectural setting and embellishes it with such characteristic motifs as a figure embracing a column, a naked child and a dog (indeed, he was to become a consummate and affectionate recorder of the dog in its many shapes and purposes) — all constants in his magnificent later masterpieces.\n\nApart from two preliminary sketches in oil on paper (though the second must surely be a later ricordo not by Veronese), it is with this picture that the National Gallery opens its new exhibition devoted to Veronese, of whose work it owns 10 examples. It establishes that he was fully formed before he moved to Venice as a gifted draughtsman expert with the brush, innovative compositions forming in his mind, yet responsive to all the weighty influences that swirled about him — to Titian and Tintoretto in Venice, Giulio Romano in Mantua, Moretto in Brescia and Giovanni Battista Moroni in Bergamo (not to be confused with Morone in Verona) — and was compliant, even occasionally dutiful. Indeed, throughout his 40 years of fame (he was 60 when he died in 1588) he was prepared to revert, particularly, to the influence of Titian and Tintoretto, to employ something of the tenebrism of the older man and of the daring perspective and dizzyingly energetic poses of the younger. Pure original Veronese, brilliantly daylit, all poses within the bounds of reason, set in grand architectural conceits inspired by his contemporary Palladio, is most readily accessible in the extravagance and grace of splendid set pieces that remind us of grand opera.\n\nThese, however, are vast canvases, now impossible to move, the first and largest of them, The Marriage at Cana of 1562-63 (Louvre), almost seven by 10 metres. Without an example of the genre the exhibition is a brave attempt to give us Hamlet without the Prince but the accompanying book conveniently contains reproductions of this and other canvases, among them The Feast in the House of Levi that was originally The Last Supper (Accademia, Venice). In this there are echoes of Leonardo’s Last Supper in that it functioned as an extension of the room in which it was to hang, the refectory of a Dominican convent, the painted staircase at either side implying the continuation of the real into the pictorial space; Christ is silhouetted against a blue sky and the apostles at the table are elegantly linked by gesture across the extended space. But where Leonardo has his Supper in a room of evening shadows and foreboding, Veronese sets his in a lofty arcade that is evidently the modern architecture of his day and crowds the event with a hubbub of servants, scullions and Malvolios.\n\nIt attracted the attention of the Inquisition. Why, the Inquisitor enquired, in a picture of our Lord’s Last Supper, are there halberdiers, buffoons, dwarfs, drunkards, Germans, a man with a bleeding nose, dogs and other vulgarities (he could have mentioned blackamoors and turbaned Turks), none of which had any place in the Jerusalem of Jesus? Veronese, a devout man but above all a painter, responded: “We painters take liberties, as poets and lunatics do… my orders were to embellish the canvas as seemed best to me… I never thought of causing disorder.” Required to amend his painting, it is said that he did no more than paint a carved inscription at the head of the two staircases, changing its title to The Feast in the House of Levi and quoting the Gospel of St Luke, 5:29. There we find that Levi, a publican, made a great feast for Jesus “and a great company of publicans and others sat down with them”, perfectly justifying the inclusion of drunkards and buffoons and altogether a more suitable subject set against that serenely midday sky. But I have never identified that man with the bleeding nose and wonder if he painted over blood stains on the rag in the hand of the figure in yellow on the stairs.\n\nMuch more is to be said of Veronese than is prompted by this exhibition, but there is another, following in Verona, that explores other aspects of his work — particularly drawings and the role of assistants — and the director of the National Gallery hopes “that everyone who enjoys Veronese here will also travel to the show in Italy” (how charmingly out of touch with reality some men can be). Most of us must make do with what is here and it must be admitted that many of the National Gallery’s examples are greatly enhanced in their temporarily wider context. As The Rape of Europa was, until recently, believed to be “After” Veronese, and The Adoration of the Kings, painted the same year as The Feast in the House of Levi, is disturbingly inferior to it, it would have been useful to have some discussion of his workshop practice (hypothetical, no doubt, as there is no documentary evidence); in addition, a handful of loans seem not quite fine enough to be by Veronese himself, among them The Supper at Emmaus (Louvre), so inept a confusion of different contributors that even the planning of the composition seems too clumsy to be Veronese’s, though the children and dogs in the lower register are undoubtedly his.\n\nThese quibbles aside, this exhibition is an astonishing achievement. It brings to London a dozen major altarpieces, some showing how closely to convention Veronese could cling, others — as in The Martyrdom of St George demonstrating how skilfully he could condense his horizontal crowds into the vertical, employing the same cast of characters. At his best his mythologies are not greatly inferior to Titian’s, and his portraits stand comparison with those of Moretto and Moroni, though not quite their equal. For the true stature, however, of the Veronese who has no rival, we need the absent pictures of the Feasts. It is these that inspired Sebastiano Ricci and Giambattista Tiepolo — and if we regard Veronese as the father of the 18th-century Venetian painting, we must also look far earlier for his influence — at El Greco when first in Venice (c1558-1570), at Elsheimer’s The Baptism of Christ (NG 3904) of c1598, even at Barocci, whose great The Last Supper of 1590-99 was hanging in the National Gallery a year ago, at Rubens and Van Dyck, Annibale Carracci, Pietro da Cortona and Luca Giordano."
