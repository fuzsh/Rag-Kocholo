        "text": "Originally self-published in 2012 as \"Mary Magdalen: Dark Goddess, Female Christ\" Mary Magdalen has become a contemporary ideal of embodied, empowered female sexuality and, for many, an initiatrix into the mysteries of erotic mysticism. As a manifestation of the divine feminine, some believe she was divine consort and thereby co-equal to Yeshua, the Christ. In this article we will explore the potential transformational dynamics involved in their purported sexual relationship. Through the lens of various sacred sexual traditions¬—including the hieros gamos or sacred marriage, the Great Rite, the alchemical marriage, and Hindu Tantra—we will explore how the Magdalen-Yeshua relationship may give us a model for cultivating practices and perspectives that help us to embrace the erotic energy of our bodies as holy, vitalizing and consciousness-expanding.\n\nMary Magdalene's conversion to Christianity must have been a turning-point of paramount importance in her life. This chapter explores the relationship between text and image, in relation to the portrayal of Mary Magdalene in the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance in the Western World, and more specifically with regards to portrayals of her conversion. It briefly introduces the complex legendary persona of the Magdalene as it emerges from biblical texts, as well as later legends. The reception of specific aspects of the Magdalene's legend in both high and low culture becomes clear through the presentation of her conversion in both popular theatre and more elitist manifestations in the visual arts. It is a well-known fact that in the Western tradition, Mary Magdalene as a 'literary' character is the result of a fusion of several biblical and legendary figures. Keywords: Christianity; Late Middle Ages; Mary Magdalene's conversion; Renaissance\n\nIn 1384 a host miracle occurred in the Alpine church of Sankt Oswald in Seefeld. The perpetrator was publically humiliated and forced to repent for his sins, but the legend of his affront was to have lasting legacy in the visual culture of the church. While certain artworks have received critical attention for their retrans- lation of events, a fifteenth-century mural cycle depicting the life of Mary Magdalen, Christianity’s most perfect penitent, in the choir has been overlooked. This article analyses the cycle’s reception of local history and the importance of the Trecento visual strategies revived for particular effect. In doing so, it accords the seemingly archaic paintings an active role in the framing of the miracle for patron, parish and pilgrims attracted by the power of divine transformation and the promise of redemption."
