        "text": "In 1384 a host miracle occurred in the Alpine church of Sankt Oswald in Seefeld. The perpetrator was publically humiliated and forced to repent for his sins, but the legend of his affront was to have lasting legacy in the visual culture of the church. While certain artworks have received critical attention for their retrans- lation of events, a fifteenth-century mural cycle depicting the life of Mary Magdalen, Christianity’s most perfect penitent, in the choir has been overlooked. This article analyses the cycle’s reception of local history and the importance of the Trecento visual strategies revived for particular effect. In doing so, it accords the seemingly archaic paintings an active role in the framing of the miracle for patron, parish and pilgrims attracted by the power of divine transformation and the promise of redemption.\n\n\"Mary Magdalene, Iconographic Studies from the Middle Ages to the Baroque examines the iconographic inventions in Magdalene imagery and the contextual factors that shaped her representation in visual art from the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries. Unique to other saints in the medieval lexicon, images of Mary Magdalene were altered over time to satisfy the changing needs of her patrons as well as her audience. By shedding light on the relationship between the Magdalene and her patrons, both corporate and private, as well as the religious institutions and regions where her imagery is found, this anthology reveals the flexibility of the Magdalene’s character in art and, in essence, the reinvention of her iconography from one generation to the next. Contributors include: Joanne Anderson, Barbara Baert, Andrea Begel, Elizabeth Carroll Consavari, Bobbi Dykema, Jane Eade, Michelle Erhardt, Rachel Geschwind, Barbara Johnston, Patrick Hunt, Annette LeZotte, Amy Morris, Margaret Morse, Michelle Moseley-Christian, Vibeke Olson, and Lisa Rafanelli, with a preface by Susan Haskins.\"\n\nGuido Cagnacci’s Repentant Magdalene from the Norton Simon Museum collection was on display at the National gallery in London in 2017. A reading of the content of the painting reveals various layers of meaning and significance - as well as impressive painting and compositional skills. A review was published on Conceptualfinearts: https://www.conceptualfinearts.com/cfa/2017/02/27/emerging-old-masters-guido-cagnacci-and-a-new-formula-for-mixing-content/\n\nhe papers are historical and art historical in focus and concern art production (wall and panel painting, sculpture, architecture, manuscript illumination and textiles), material and visual culture and literature in various European cities and locales in the 14th and 15th centuries and later criticism associated with these subject areas. There is an emphasis on the transmission and translation of workshop style, the traditional concept of artistic centres and peripheries, the consideration of art works in context, art production and the workshop system, the Medieval city, notions of progression and transition pertaining to Medieval and Renaissance art production, Petrarch and Humanism, Panofsky and the critical history, art theory and practice, patronage, commerce, religion and politics."
