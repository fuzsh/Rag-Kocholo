        "text": "edit\n\nNeighbourhoods\n\nEven as the national capital, Bratislava is small (500,000 people). In fact, Slovaks call it a big village, and in many ways it is. For tourists, the main neighbourhoods of interest are the old city and surroundings, but there are some more remote areas, like Slavin and its upscale houses that are worth a look. For wine drinkers, take the tram out to Raca or Vinohrady and visit the vineyards, which produce nice white wines.\n\nedit\n\nEvents and Festivals\n\nSports\n\nIf there is one sport that the Slovaks love, it is Ice Hockey. At the Slovnaft Arena on Trnavska Cesta you can see games of the local team: HC Slovan Bratislava. The arena is also used for concerts by international artists.\n\nIn the first weekend the Bratislava Marathon takes place, as this is quite early in the year circumstances are not always optimal for the runners or spectators. Another sport event that takes place is the Bratislava open tennis tournament, that takes place at the Narodne Tenisova Center in November. The same venue is also used for Fedcup and Davis cup games on the national team.\n\nJunifest\n\nThe constant flow of suds may be the biggest attraction for many people at this 10-day long Bratislava beer festival, but drinking is not the only enjoyable attraction offered here. More than 300 musical performances are on this June festival’s bill each year alongside games, food, and raffle ticket draws for wonderful prizes.\n\nCoronation Ceremonies\n\nThese elaborate three-day long ceremonies are a throwback to Bratislava’s more than three centuries as Greater Hungary’s capital, when 11 Hapsburg monarchs received their crowns within the city’s Dome of St Martin. Although the Hapsburgs no longer rule the land, their majestic era lives on during this September coronation re-enactment complete with horseback riding processions, shooting demonstrations, folk festivities, and actors taking the king’s oath on the very spot where the monarchs first ascended their thrones.\n\nedit\n\nGetting Around\n\nBy Car\n\nSome parts of the city are not accessible by car, including the old town.\n\nBy Public Transport\n\nMost of the city, old and new, is reachable by a solid network of trams, buses, and trolley buses. You can get more information on the website of the municipal transport.\n\nYou must buy tickets in advance, from tobacco shops or ticket machines located near stops. The former close in the early evening, and the latter only takes coins. So plan in advance if you are staying out late. After 11:00pm or so everything stops except night buses which are all signposted with N#. Always print a couple of tickets to carry with you, as not all stops have a vending machine.\n\nPlease note that you should only take the €0.70 tickets if you are sure that you make the trip within 15 minutes (which is the period, after which these expire.) You need to stamp them, when getting onto the tram or bus. €0.90 ticket will last 60 minutes during the week and 90 minutes during the weekend.\n\nBratislava is a compact city, and getting around by foot is the preferred method to explore. This is particularly true in the old town, where car transport is nearly impossible due to the many tables and chairs placed on the 'street'.\n\nBy Bike\n\nThere are no dedicated bike paths in the old town, but there are two excellent paths along either side of the Danube river. In fact, one can bike to Vienna, Budapest or a little bit closer, Devin Castle along a lovely path away from cars. The countryside surrounding Bratislava is superb for cycling, with good, almost flat, bicycle paths along the Danube and Morava rivers. If slopes tickle your fancy, then the Carpathian range is nearby with plenty of trails for mountain bikers and more fit riders.\n\nBeware of thieves in the city and try and keep your bicycle in sight, or locked with a good lock.\n\nedit\n\nEat\n\nSlovakia is typical of Central Europe in that most foods are of a hearty nature, usually meat and a starch (potatoes, rice, etc.), washed down with beer. Typical meals include Goulash or the Slovak national dish Bryndza Halusky, a potato risoto covered in a tangy, salty white cheese and bacon. It is somewhat of an acquired taste, but good on cold days.\n\nVegetarians suffer somewhat in Slovakia, even in Bratislava, as the Slovak concept of \"meatless\" permits a liberal usage of bacon. However, a growing number of places in the old city and in ethnic restaurants now offer more varieties for those who go meatless. When in doubt (and one should always be in doubt about whether dishes come with meat in Slovakia), ask \"Bez Mesa?\" (without meat?).\n\nThe most common non-Slovakian food is Italian - the Slovaks are crazy for Italian food. It is usually of the southern red-sauce variety, but can be tasty. Chinese, Sushi, Indian and Middle Eastern can also be found in and around the Old City.\n\nSlovak Pub and Flagship offer a large choice of local and international dishes, and also provide cheap student meals. Bratislavski is a busy pub and restaurant but also offers a variety of local and international dishes. Primi concentrates more on international cuisine, with a large variety of pizza's and pasta's.\n\nedit\n\nDrink\n\nBeer is one of the main drinks in the city. One of the raisons d'etre of Slovak life, it is easy to find, cheap and tasty. If you like a malty dark beer, you are mostly out of luck, as the Slovak dark beer (Tmave Pivo) is very sweet. The Pilsner, which at times is closer to a weak ale, is quite nice, and varies in strength from brewery to brewery.\n\nThe Slovaks also like fruit based alcohol, but don't be fooled. This stuff, depending where it comes from will peel paint and fix anything wrong with you. Try them all, and should you find them too strong for you, try it again - it gets easier!\n\nIf you want to mix with the locals, you will have to order Kofola instead of a cola. The taste is not quite the same, and not everybody likes it (references to it tasting like cough sirup have been made), but you will get some respect for at least giving it a try. On the bright side, if you are on a tied budget it is the drink for you.\n\nMost visitors to Bratislava choose one of the many restaurants or cafe's in the old town for drinks. Also the party and restaurant boats moored on the river are popular at night. There's also a really interesting nightclub inside a bunker from the war that has a slightly claustrophobic feel to it, but good dance music.\n\nedit\n\nSleep\n\nUpscale\n\nedit\n\nWork\n\nCitizens of the EU can work freely within Slovakia. However you will need to report to the Foreign Police at Hrobáková 42 (used to be at number 44.) to be registered. If you want you can also apply for a Slovak ID card, but that is not mandatory for people with a EU passport. You will need to bring a copy of your contract with you, recent pictures (passport size), and fill in 2 forms. (ask you employer if they have copies for you, so you can do that already at home.) You will also be able to receive a Slovak birth number. Please be advised that none of the staff speaks (or is willing to speak) any other language than Slovak.\n\nApart from that you will need to open a Slovak Bank Account. (e.g. at VUB Bank, Tatra Bank, CSOB or any of the others). You should also do a short medical exam before signing the contract with your employer, but this can in most cases also be done after signing the contract. When you are leaving the country, you should again visit the foreign police and have your entry removed, and as well cancel your insurance. If you have stayed longer, and you expect a tax refund, you will need to keep your bank account open.\n\nedit\n\nKeep Connected\n\nInternet\n\nWifi and broadband can be found more or less everywhere, and there will be an internet cafe available somewhere even in smaller towns. Also, shopping centres, hostels, pubs, cafes, and some public institutions such as libraries or government buildings offer (free) wifi.\n\nPhone\n\nSee also International Telephone Calls\n\nThe international calling code for Slovakia is +421. In case of an emergency, call the universal number 112. You can also call directly on 150 for fire brigade, 155 in a medical emergency or 158 for the police.\n\nSlovak phones operate on the GSM standard, which covers most of the country, and 3G covers most of the area. The coverage is surprisingly good, and you will often have signal even in mountain areas, unless you are in a deep ravine. There are three main operators - Orange, T-mobile and O2, and they all use 900 or 1800Mhz standard, which might not be compatible with some U.S. phones operating on 1900Mhz.\n\nThey all (along with some virtual operators, biggest of which are Funfón and Tesco Mobile) offer a variety of prepaid cards with various \"pay as you go\" schemes (some market research is advised, if you want the best deal) and incentives. If you have an unlocked phone, these are easy to pick up in any phone shop, or you can purchase a cheap phone with a prepaid card included.\n\nThere are still some phone boxes available, but with mobile phones now commonplace, they are declining in number. Also note that you might need to purchase a prepaid card to use some of them.\n\nPost\n\nSlovenská pošta is the national postal service of Slovakia. They have affordable, reliable and relatively fast services. You can choose to send letters/postcards first (express) or second class. Prices start at €0.40 for a second class letter (up to 50 gram) domestically, €0.60 for express services. Within Europe prices start at €0.90 (Czech Republic €0.80), outside Europe prices start at €1.00, all for second class letters/postcards up to 50 grams. Post offices are available in all villages and provide banking services like money transfers as well. The post offices are usually open from Monday to Friday 8:00am to 6:00pm and on Saturday until 1:00pm. The main post offices in larger towns or shopping malls are open daily to 8:00pm. It is possible to buy post stamps for post cards and letters directly in the post offices or in some newspaper stands.\n\nYou can use parcels services with Slovenská Posta as well, although you might be better off with companies like UPS, TNT, FedEx or DHL, which offer similar prices, but usually faster and more reliable services."
