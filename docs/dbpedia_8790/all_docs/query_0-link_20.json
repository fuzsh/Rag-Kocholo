        "text": "TravelingMel once again takes the reins in this Bratislava Walking City Guide to show you around the Capital city of Slovakia. The winter weather looks cold and wet (and it is a bit) but it just adds to the mystery and dreamlike atmosphere of this historic central European city. We spent a week here, went to the UFO tower, the opera, and visited a castle. Melynda and the boys even took a segway tour. Did I mention the pastries? Amazing!\n\n4K City Walks: Bratislava Slovakia – Old Town Capital – Virtual Walk Treadmill City Guide & Tour\n\nBratislava is a wonderful city: Not too big, not too small. The winter fog from the Danube river makes the city even more mysterious and magical. This city treadmill tour of the Old Historic center of the city is actually very walkable with lots to see and eat. Many wonderful warm restaurants with local foods as well as breweries and bars. It’s also very affordable. Thanks for watching and let Mel know how great she did in the comments. Thanks!\n\nWikipedia\n\nBratislava is the capital of Slovakia. With a population of about 430,000, it is one of the smaller capitals of Europe but still the country’s largest city. The greater metropolitan area is home to more than 650,000 people. Bratislava is in southwestern Slovakia, occupying both banks of the River Danube and the left bank of the River Morava. Bordering Austria and Hungary, it is the only national capital that borders two sovereign states.\n\nThe city’s history has been influenced by people of many nations and religions, including Austrians, Bulgarians, Croats, Czechs, Germans, Hungarians, Jews, Serbs[6] and Slovaks. It was the coronation site and legislative center of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1536 to 1783, and has been home to many Slovak, Hungarian and German historical figures.\n\nBratislava is the political, cultural and economic centre of Slovakia. It is the seat of the Slovak president, the parliament and the Slovak Executive. It has several universities, and many museums, theatres, galleries and other cultural and educational institutions. Many of Slovakia’s large businesses and financial institutions have headquarters there.\n\nIn 2017, Bratislava was ranked as the third richest region of the European Union by GDP (PPP) per capita (after Hamburg and Luxembourg City). GDP at purchasing power parity is about three times higher than in other Slovak regions. Bratislava receives around 1 million tourists every year.\n\nSEE MORE Bratislava, Slovakia Walks below:\n\nDanube River Walk in Bratislava\n\nBratislava Historic City Center\n\nDevin Castle Walk\n\nCastle Overlook\n\nSlavin Memorial of Bratislava\n\nSupport us for just $5 on Patreon\n\nOr make a one time Paypal Donation"
