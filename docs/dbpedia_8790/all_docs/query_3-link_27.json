        "text": "About City\n\nAbout City\n\nWhy should you visit?\n\nThe answer is simple - because it’s all here. History, architecture, tradition, culture, art, drinks, food and nightlife.\n\nLocated on the River Danube, Bratislava is easily accessible and a great place to hang out. It’s safe, friendly, hassle-free and there is always something worth doing; whether you’re here for an afternoon, a week or a year.\n\nDiscover more…\n\nCoronation City\n\nImagine being the organiser for really major event – the coronation of the King of Hungary.\n\nBut in 1563 when it was time to crown Maximilian as the new Hungarian king, Etzergom was under the control of Hungary’s bitter enemy, the Ottoman Turks.

And no, the river was not named after Johann Strauss waltz. It was the other way round. It is said that Strauss composed the first melodies of his famous waltz in Bratislava in 1852.\n\nDiscover more…\n\nThree Countries – One Destination\n\nBratislava, for much of its history, was a three-language town. Its citizens spoke Slovak, Hungarian and German.\n\nVisitors of Bratislava can view the closeness of Austria and Hungary from the Crown Tower of the Bratislava Castle. The tower is the oldest part of the castle and on a clear day offers a 360-degree view of Hungary and Austria, as well as the Czech Republic.\n\nDiscover more…"
