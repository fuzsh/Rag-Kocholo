We just came back from a two month driving adventure through Slovenia and Croatia, and discovered that parts of Croatia weren’t that great, although Slovenia was fantastic in every way! Locals mentioned to us that Slovakia is just okay as far as safety is concerned (although not as bad as Bosnia). We travelled through Bosnia for a little bit, and it was very uncomfortable and the roads were a mess.\n\nSo have any of you traveled through Slovakia via car recently? If so, what was your impression?"
