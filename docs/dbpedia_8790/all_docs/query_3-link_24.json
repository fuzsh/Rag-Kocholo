We may receive a commission from purchases made through the links enclosed at no additional cost to you!\n\nI tend to be a proponent for deeper travel and really getting to know a destination. Yet, time doesn’t always allow for that. That is why I created a guide on what to do if you only visit Bratislava in one day.\n\nIs it worth visiting Bratislava for one day?\n\nThe answer is yes! Bratislava has a lot to offer in terms of architecture, history, and of course, food. Unfortunately, Bratislava, Slovakia is one of those cities that tourists typically brush over in a day. The fact that it is such an easy day trip from other major cities like Vienna and Budapest lends to tourists visiting it on the side. While I recommend spending more than a day in this charming city, one day is better than none.\n\nEven one day in Bratislava allows for a good overview of the city and getting to see some of the top sights.\n\nHow to get to Bratislava\n\nBy flight:\n\nIf you are only visiting Bratislava for one day, you may not be arriving by flight, but of course it is an option. There is an airport in Bratislava, making it an easy destination to fly into. It may not always be the cheapest airport to fly into depending on where you are flying in from. If you are looking for more budget-friendly options, it might be beneficial to check flights into nearby cities like Vienna and Budapest.\n\nBy train:\n\nThe train system throughout the majority of Europe is outstanding, and getting to Bratislava by train is no exception.\n\nVienna to Bratislava – Time: 1 hour and 6 minutes; Price: $11-$13\n\nBudapest to Bratislava – Time: 2 hours and 23 minutes, Price: $8-$9\n\nBy bus:\n\nWhile not always as scenic or comfortable as the train, the bus is a great option if you are sticking to a tighter budget.\n\nVienna to Bratislava – Time: 1 hour and 20 minutes; Price: $3-$4\n\nBudapest to Bratislava – Time: 2 hours and 20 minutes, Price: $11-$13\n\nBy ferry:\n\nIf you want a unique way of traveling to Bratislava, there is the options to take a ferry from Vienna!\n\nVienna to Bratislava – Time: 1 hour and 15 minutes; Price: $30-$35\n\nBy car:\n\nOften the fastest way to get places, going by car is also an option. The price for this option will vary depending on the route you take. You can either rent a car or use a ridesharing service like BlaBlaCar\n\nVienna to Bratislava – Time: 58 minutes (tolls) or 1 hour and 22 minutes (no tolls)\n\nBudapest to Bratislava – Time: 2 hours and 4 minutes (tolls) or 3 hours and 23 minutes (no tolls)\n\nOne Day Itinerary in Bratislava\n\nIf you are like me and enjoy tours and food, here is the perfect way to visit Bratislava for one day. My favorite way to get the most out of one day in any city is through tours. Luckily, there are several free (pay what you want) tours available in Bratislava that touch on several aspects of the city. All the free walking tours discussed in this article are on a pay what you want basis. You will simply tip what you would like once the tour is over. All the tours also meet at Františkánske Námestie. Don’t worry though. If you don’t enjoy tours, I also share a little on how you can see the city on your own.\n\nBest things to do in Bratislava\n\nIf you decide that the tours aren’t for you, here are some of the key highlights of Bratislava that you should aim to visit on your own:\n\nBratislava is a beautiful city and worth a visit, even if it’s just for one day."
