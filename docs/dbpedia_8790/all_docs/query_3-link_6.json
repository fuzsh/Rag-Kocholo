Bratislava is the largest city in Slovakia with a population of over half a million. It is the capital of Slovakia and the main administrative center of the country. Over two-thirds of the Slovakian population resides in mid-sized to small towns of under 50,000 people. This has made it easy to access services from providers in the small towns. Most Slovakian towns have a unique and profound history and culture that becomes the high-points of each town. On average, the mid-sized towns have a population of no more than 100,000 and are found spread all over the country’s main regions.Here are some of the biggest cities in Slovakia.\n\nThe Most Populous Towns Of Slovakia\n\nBratislava\n\nBratislava is the most populous city in Slovakia with a population of 583,600.

The tourism sector has come to life over the past years especially after the renovation of the old town. Bratislava is home to important cultural elements, museums, theaters, galleries, universities, financial institutions and government offices. As one of the fastest growing towns in Europe, you can easily connect with other major cities such as Vienna which is an hour’s travel away.\n\nKošice\n\nKošice is the second largest city in Slovakia having a population of at least 355,047 people. It is the administrative capital of Eastern region of Slovakia and the main industrial hub.It houses major companies such as the US Steel giant plant.
