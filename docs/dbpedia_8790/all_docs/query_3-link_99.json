        "text": "\"Bored? Get a raccoon,\" recommended Czech actor Jaromír Hanzlík in the iconic Czechoslovak film Postřižiny (Cutting It Short). Maybe it's exactly a raccoon colony that would make Bratislava a less boring city. Out of the 10 most boring cities globally, Bratislava has placed third.\n\n\"Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, exudes charm with its historic old town, but its small-town feel contributes to its reputation as one of the less lively European capitals,\" reads the website The World Bucket List, which published the ranking.\n\n\"The limited number of major attractions and a more relaxed pace make it a city that might not satisfy the craving for excitement that some travellers seek in a capital city.\"\n\nTwo more boring cities are St. Petersburg, Florida and Lubbock, Texas, both in the US.\n\nOn the opposite side of the ranking are Bangkok, Paris and Tokyo.\n\nDespite its fame for the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Pisa placed fourth in the 10 most boring cities in the world, just behind Bratislava. Other cities in the ranking include Helsinki, Birmingham, Santiago in Chile and Ottawa in Canada.\n\nOther boring capitals include Brussels, which despite being the capital of the European Union, is often deemed one of the ugliest cities in Europe; Canberra, capital of Australia; and Bucharest, capital of Romania."
