        "text": "History\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the fall of the Great Moravian Empire, Slovakia became part of the Kingdom of Hungary from the 10th century (later included with the Austro-Hungarian Empire) until the end of the First World War. The city was the capital (1536-1784), the coronation city (1563-1830), and the seat of the Diet (1536-1848) of the Kingdom of Hungary for three centuries. In this period, eleven Hungarian kings and queens were crowned at St. Martin's Cathedral. At that time, the city was called PreÃŸburg in German and Pozsony in Hungarian, and had a clear German (42%) and Hungarian (40%) ethnic majority (1910 census). In 1919, the Treaty of Trianon created Czechoslovakia, and Bratislava was attached to the newly founded state. In the same year, the name Bratislava was officially adopted for the first time.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1944, Slovakia was a Nazi puppet state. In 1941â€“1942 and 1944â€“1945, this government collaborated in deporting most of Bratislava's approximately 15,000 Jews to concentration camps, where most were murdered. Bratislava was occupied by German troops in 1944, and eventually taken by the Soviet Red Army on 4 April 1945, after a failed insurrection of Slovak partisans, now commemorated as SlovenskÃ© nÃ¡rodnÃ© povstanie, or \"Slovak National Uprising\".\n\nAfter the Communist Party seized power in Czechoslovakia in February 1948, the city witnessed profound demographic and urban transformation. In 1969 it became the capital city of the Slovak Socialist Republic, one of the two component states of federal Czechoslovakia.\n\nBratislava's dissidents anticipated the fall of Communism with the Bratislava candle demonstration in 1988, and the city became one of the foremost centres of the anti-Communist \"Velvet Revolution\" in 1989. In 1993, the city became the capital of the newly formed Slovak Republic following the \"Velvet Divorce\".\n\nSince the fall of the Iron Curtain and especially with the accession of Slovakia to the European Union (May 2004) and later the Schengen Area, Bratislava is often marketed together with Vienna as \"twin cities\" due to their closeness. They are the two European capitals with the shortest distance to one another and should you ever get bored with Bratislava, Vienna is certainly an interesting day trip. You can even cross the roughly 60 km of distance on a bike in a single day if you're moderately fit.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nCoach lines connect Bratislava with all of Slovakia, a high number of Czech cities and a number of EU destinations, including London, Paris. Between Bratislava and Budapest there are daily connections, so does, for example, Flixbus provide a bus service about every two hours.\n\nFrom southern Germany there are a few connections as well. For more on the newly emerging domestic market as well as some information on international routes (operated by mostly the same companies) see Long distance bus travel in Germany\n\nThe most frequent international coach connection by far is Vienna, though. There are three companies â€“ Postbus/Slovak Lines, Flixbus, and RegioJet â€“ providing bus services between Vienna and Vienna International Airport and Bratislava, each in hourly intervals from different points of departure within Vienna. In Bratislava, all buses stop at Einsteinova (PetrÅ¾alka) and Most SNP (under UFO Bridge) and/or Coach Terminal (AutobusovÃ¡ stanica (MlynskÃ© Nivy), in timetables abbreviated as Bratislava AS). All but RegioJet buses continue towards Bratislava Airport every two hours. A trip from/to Vienna takes about 1Â½ hours.\n\nThe fare to Bratislava is the same, irrespective of whether the travel starts in Vienna or at Vienna airport. To Bratislava airport the fare may be the same or higher with Flixbus, while Postbus/Slovak Lines generally charge a higher fare.\n\nHourly departures from Vienna (schedules and prices as of June 2018):\n\nSlovak Lines: from Vienna Central Train Station (Wien Hauptbahnhof; Bus Terminal is adjacently situated at SÃ¼dtiroler Platz / Wiedner GÃ¼rtel) 06:00â€“22:00, 23.30; to Bratislava airport from 06:00â€“14:00 and 15:00â€“19:00 every 2 hours. You can book online here.\n\nFlixbus: from Vienna U3 Erdberg VIB (Vienna International Busterminal) 06:30â€“23:30, 0:45; to Bratislava airport from 07:30â€“21:30 every 2 hours. To Bratislava centre there are two additional buses from Vienna Central Train Station operated by Polski Bus under the umbrella of Flixbus. You can book online here.\n\nRegioJet: from Vienna Central Train Station (Wien Hauptbahnhof; Bus Terminal is adjacently situated at SÃ¼dtiroler Platz / Wiedner GÃ¼rtel) 06:25, 08:25â€“22:25. You can book online here.\n\nFor more details see Vienna International Airport / Flughafen Wien.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nBratislava lies on the border of two other countries and has a relatively good road system. The town can be accessed by motorways (i.e. limited access highway) from northern Slovakia and Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary as well as Austria. As a result, you can pass the town without having to leave the motorway at all. Similar to most countries in Central Europe, you have to pay for using the highways. Similar to Hungary, the payment is all done electronically (so you do not have to have a sticker on the windshield) and can be bought online, on most petrol stations and in kiosk on border. The motorways within the boundaries of Bratislava town can be used for free.\n\nAfter entering the city, a parking information system is in place to lead you to the next free parking spot. In the center of town you either can use one of the paid underground garages or buy a parking card from vendors in yellow vests and try to find a free spot in the streets. The former is recommended on weekends as finding a parking place in the one-ways can turn into a real head breaking puzzle. If you do find a spot in the street and it's a weekday between 08:00 and 16:00 you have to pay for parking. Parking meters are usually available at the corners, are signed posted with blue and yellow sign and take coins only.\n\nIt may be a good idea to leave the car at the Aupark parking lot which also serves as a \"Park and Walk\" facility for tourists (note that the indoor parking facilities as well as parts of the outdoor parking lot are closed from 24:00-06:00, the rest of the parking space is free to use 24/7). You can leave your car here and walk through the park and across the Danube to the city center, which is a 10-minute stroll, or just use public transport. It is not recommended to leave the car in residential areas outside of the city center to avoid paid parking, as foreign cars may attract car thieves.\n\nRenting a car is also an option, especially if you are visiting destinations outside of Bratislava. All major rental companies have a stall at the airport but most have a city office as well plus there is a lot of local car rental companies, some even deliver the car to your hotel/apartment. Use common sense to pick the reliable one.\n\nPublic transport\n\n[edit]\n\nIf you want to travel outside of the centre, use the trams or trolley buses if you need to get from one point to another quickly. Bratislava has a rather good public transport system mainly operated by the city transport company DPB (website in Slovak only) although a lot of their vehicles are quite old. Buses tend to be the slowest means of transport. Stops typically have to be requested, except for trams. To enter bus/trolleybus one has to be standing visibly on the bus stop. To exit, one needs to press a button nearby doors and the driver will stop at the next stops. Bus doors have to be opened by passengers (except for few oldest buses), just push a button on the door or near the door.\n\nA single-journey ticket costs â‚¬0.70, valid for 15 minutes only. There is a longer validity ticket available for â‚¬0.90 (valid for 30 minutes). All tickets can be used for any number of travels within the specified time period. If you are staying for a holiday, consider buying one from a choice of longer term tickets valid for 1, 3 and 7 days (24, 72, and 168 hours from validation) for â‚¬3.50, â‚¬8 and â‚¬11.40 respectively. For more information about tickets, check the IDS BK (Integrated Transport System) website. Note that you also need to buy a separate ticket for your suitcase or other large luggage; buy a reduced 15 minute ticket for â‚¬0.35 and that will cover your luggage.\n\nYou must validate your ticket in the validation machines on the bus/tram immediately after boarding (via any door). When it comes to proving that you have not exceeded the time stated on your ticket (e.g. 15 minutes on a 15-minute ticket), official schedule times are decisive â€” not the actual travel times (do not give in to unfriendly ticket inspectors claiming the contrary). You can find out the scheduled travel times in the left-most column of the schedules, left of the stop name or via the internet (see below).\n\nBus and tram drivers in Bratislava do not sell tickets, therefore you need to obtain a ticket prior to entering a bus or a tram. There are ticket vending machines at most stops in the town. Only coins and contactless credit cards can be used at the yellow machines (which can be quite frustrating if you need to buy a longer term ticket), but at larger stops there are also new big red machines which sell the full range of tickets and accept all cards and even banknotes. SMS tickets are also available, but only if you send a text message from a cell phone with a Slovak SIM card, which rules out all short-term foreign tourists. SMS tickets cannot be used on S-trains.\n\nIf you purchased a \"Eurgion Bratislava-Ticket\" return ticket in Vienna, it also serves as a pass for all public transport on the date shown on the ticket, and does not need to be validated on Bratislava public transport.\n\nBesides vending machines, tickets are also sold in many news stands and â€” very conveniently for travellers arriving by train, late in the evening or at weekends â€” in railway stations at the ticket counters (ticket counter 16 at the main railway station). You can also purchase tickets for public transport in every tourist information bureau. Try asking for the Bratislava City Card which combines a 1 to 3-day ticket with various discounts and is available at information bureaus, but note that the City Card is significantly more expensive than public transport tickets alone, so make sure it is the best option for you!\n\nTickets can also be bought using an app for Android or iOS.\n\nThere are 3 main interchange points in the close city centre where you can get a bus or tram to nearly anywhere else:\n\nHodÅ¾ovo nÃ¡mestie (Presidential palace) for Northwest- and East-bound bus connections\n\nNÃ¡mestie SNP / KamennÃ© nÃ¡mestie (down the pedestrian area below HodÅ¾ovo nÃ¡mestie, on the northern edge of centre) for trams\n\nMost SNP (close to St. Martin's Cathedral and the Danube banks) for trams and for west-bound buses as well as bus connections to PetrÅ¾alka.\n\nMain tram, bus and trolleybus lines operate from 04:30 until approximately 23:30. If you need to travel by bus at night, go to the main railway station which is the main night line interchange point or use the bus stops at Presidential palace (Hodzovo nÃ¡mestie). All night lines have common departure times from the main railway station at 23:30 and then every 60 minutes for every line and outbound direction until 03:30. Some lines have an extra outbound departure at midnight. You will need a night ticket for â‚¬1.40 in night lines. When travelling by night lines, every stop must be requested. Especially around midnight on Fridays and Saturdays, the buses tend to be very crowded on some lines as young people return from clubs.\n\nThe routes of the public transport do change sometimes, especially due to trackworks and renovation. For example, in June 2019 the tram lines were all completely changed. If you have an older map, old tourist guide, etc., chances are the transport lines (numbers, destinations, transfer points) are no longer valid. Check online at either the official IDS BK site or at the unofficial iMHD site which has a wider range of maps, the information at stops (available in English), or ask your fellow passengers if not sure.\n\nIf necessary, it is also possible to walk to Petrzalka station from the city (some 25 minutes). The path is clearly marked now but note that PetrÅ¾alka is just a little more than the biggest block flats housing estate in Central Europe. Head for the bridge with the flying saucer-like looking tower atop it (Most SNP or also known as NovÃ½ most). Once you reach the bridge, you will notice that there is a walkway running along the underside of it, for pedestrians. Once on the other side of the Danube river, follow the right hand-side of the bridge with a walkway made of red paving. This will lead you to the station. Alternatively, you can walk through Bratislava's equivalent of the Central Park called Sad Janka KrÃ¡Ä¾a and visit the Aupark Shopping Mall at the park. Once exiting Aupark on the other side, turn right and follow the street to get to the pavement mentioned above. The route is very safe during the day, but for typically western-looking tourists, it might be dangerous at night (although not more than in any other European \"panelÃ¡k\" (see above) housing estate). Take a guide, if needed. If you want to walk from the station to the city, turn right outside of the station building and follow the path described above in reverse direction."
