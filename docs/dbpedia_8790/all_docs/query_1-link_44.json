        "text": "Make time for Slovakiaâ€™s capital city and youâ€™ll be rewarded with history, design and a dose of whimsy. Hereâ€™s why Bratislava is worth visiting.\n\nWhy Visit Bratislava\n\nBratislava, the capital of Slovakia, often flies under the radar compared to its more famous neighbours like Vienna and Budapest.\n\nI first visited on a stopover on a Viking Danube River Cruise from Budapest to Passau.\n\nOne of the reasons I chose this route was to experience smaller cities like this and to be able to explore.\n\nViking provide complimentary walking tours in each port, which are a great way to get your bearings in a new place before you have free time to explore in more depth.\n\nBut, of course, you donâ€™t need to see Bratislava this way. You can just explore the city under your own steam.\n\nDisclosure: if you book or buy through any of the links on this page, we may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you.\n\nFirst Impressions of Bratislava\n\nAnd what did I find? Bratislava combines pretty pastel facades and cobbled streets with a history of grit, determination and good humour.\n\nHereâ€™s a look at why Bratislava is worth visiting, along with practical information on getting there, getting around, and making the most of your trip.\n\nBut a quick note. While I definitely believe that Bratislava is worth visiting in its own right, I wouldnâ€™t recommend making a day trip from Vienna to do so unless you have lots of time to do Vienna justice.\n\nSavour Vienna. And then make other plans to come and savour the smaller city of Bratislava.\n\nIs Bratislava Worth Visiting?\n\nIs Bratislava worth visiting? In short, yes. Visit her for the art, the food, the architecture, the historyâ€¦and as a sign of respect to Slovakia and the man in the drain cover.\n\nBratislavaâ€™s Highlights and Attractions\n\nBratislava Castle\n\nPerched high above the city, Bratislava Castle is one of the most iconic landmarks in the city. The castle, originally constructed in the 9th century, has undergone various reconstructions, with its current Baroque style dating back to the 18th century. It offers spectacular panoramic views of the Danube River and the city below.\n\nWithin its walls, youâ€™ll find the Slovak National Museum, which houses a vast array of historical and cultural artefacts. Donâ€™t miss the Crown Tower, from where you can enjoy the best views of Bratislava, stretching all the way to Austria and Hungary on clear days.\n\nInside Tip: Visit the castle at sunset for a view of the city bathed in golden light.\n\nOld Town (StarÃ© Mesto)\n\nBratislavaâ€™s Old Town is a labyrinth of narrow, medieval streets lined with pastel-coloured buildings. Itâ€™s a delightful area to wander around, with charming squares, quaint cafes, and numerous historical landmarks.\n\nKey sites include Michaelâ€™s Gate, the only preserved gate of the cityâ€™s medieval fortifications, and the Old Town Hall, which dates back to the 14th century and now hosts the Bratislava City Museum. This area is also home to the Primateâ€™s Palace, renowned for its Hall of Mirrors and collection of English tapestries.\n\nInside Tip: Take a guided walking tour to uncover hidden courtyards and learn about the legends and history of the Old Town.\n\nSt. Martinâ€™s Cathedral\n\nSt. Martinâ€™s Cathedral, a stunning Gothic church, has been a significant religious site since its consecration in 1452. It served as the coronation church for Hungarian kings and queens from 1563 to 1830, drawing in the Empireâ€™s great and good to this small city.\n\nThe cathedralâ€™s interior is just as impressive as its exterior, featuring beautiful stained-glass windows and a stunning baroque altar. Beneath the cathedral lies an underground crypt, where many notable figures are buried.\n\nInside Tip: Attend a classical music concert here to experience the cathedralâ€™s incredible acoustics.\n\nDevin Castle\n\nA short drive from the city centre, Devin Castle is perched on a cliff above the confluence of the Danube and Morava rivers. This site has been inhabited since the Iron Age, and its ruins offer a glimpse into Slovakiaâ€™s rich past. The castle played a crucial role in the Great Moravian Empire and later as a strategic military fort.\n\nToday, itâ€™s a peaceful place to explore, with well-preserved ruins and informative displays about its history.\n\nInside Tip: Visit in spring or summer when the surrounding nature is in full bloom, and take a leisurely hike up to the castle for magnificent views.\n\nUFO Observation Deck\n\nFor a modern contrast to Bratislavaâ€™s historical sites, head to the UFO Observation Deck atop the SNP Bridge.\n\nOpened in 1972, this distinctive structure offers stunning 360-degree views of the city and the surrounding area. At a height of 95 metres, itâ€™s one of the best spots for panoramic photography. Thereâ€™s also a chic restaurant where you can dine with a view, offering both local and international cuisine.\n\nInside Tip: Go in the evening to enjoy a meal as the city lights up, creating a magical atmosphere.\n\nThe Blue Church (St. Elizabethâ€™s Church)\n\nThe Blue Church, officially known as St. Elizabethâ€™s Church, stands out with its distinctive sky-blue faÃ§ade and intricate details. Built between 1909 and 1913, this Art Nouveau masterpiece was designed by Hungarian architect Ã–dÃ¶n Lechner. The churchâ€™s exterior features delicate mosaics and glazed tiles, giving it a fairy-tale appearance.\n\nInside, the pastel blue theme continues, although the rest of the decorations appear more traditional.\n\nInside Tip: Visit early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid crowds and fully appreciate the churchâ€™s tranquil beauty.
