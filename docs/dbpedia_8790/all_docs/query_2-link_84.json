        "text": "Weekly Briefing, Vol. 20, No. 3 (SK), July 2019\n\nCapital city of culture is “Nové Zámky“\n\n,,City of culture” award has become a new tradition in Slovakia since 2018. Every Slovak city can participate and struggle for this status. Competition ”Capital of Culture 2019″ was launched by Slovak Arts Council for the first time last year. Although it was a brand new idea, eight cities participated in this project and three of them proceeded to final.\n\nMain points of the project are long-run support of local culture and art, presentation of various forms of contemporary art and traditional culture and widening of the current audience, support of closer cooperation between the city and non-profit sector, also with institutions established by country and autonomies, support of domestic educational and community cultural activities.\n\nFirst Slovak Capital of Culture became Banská Štiavnica in 2018. Not just for an outstanding project, but also for close cooperation with civic associations, what represent independent culture in the city. During the whole year Banská Štiavnica had the opportunity to attract new visitors by various cultural events. Banská Štiavnica, the historic mining city, according to a representative of the organisation team Rastislav Marko, wanted to point out that majority of citizens of Banská Štiavnice live in flats on the periphery of the city and majority of them is not interested in cultural life in the city. The organisation team of the main cultural project wanted to solve this issue in long-run. The main point of the Banská Štiavnica project has been and is to obtain a new spectator (who will be from Banská Štiavnica) and at the end of the project, he or she will be more cultural, active, and more open not just to culture, but also to life in the city or society. This point was a reason of their win. The city has been trying to achieve it since January 2019. The city is in confluence with present art and culture, just local citizens are not interested in it.\n\nMain organisers of Capital of Culture 2019 project wanted to change this state by dozens of actions under the nickname Almánia, what in Banská Bystrica vernacular means: “Good but little”. They would appreciate if the word Almánia will be said as many times as possible till 2019. The street theatre, art and literature events will be brought to the residents till December 2019. For example, amateurs will be learning from professionals in movie ateliers and eventually making the city better. Events will be held mainly outside he tourist season, so since October till May. Banská Štiavnica announces 120 artists from 7 countries, 35 educational events, 18 residential art events, 15 community events and lot of more events, what are planned in long-run especially with Middle-European cooperation.\n\nSlovak Capital of Culture 2020 will be the heart of artistic and cultural events. Selection of winner proceeded in 2 rounds. First one was opened for all cities and 3 projects were advanced into the second round. Among those the best submitter was chosen and won a caption City of Culture 2020 and incentive 300 000€. Next projects from whole Slovakia will be supported in next months with 200 000€ so they can realise their projects in the city of the winner. Capital of Culture was chosen on the 7th of June by Slovak Arts Council. After the presentation of three submitters (Nové zámky, Spišská Nová Ves, Stará Ľubovňa) the commission chose the first place to the city on the south of Slovakia, Nové Zámky.\n\nThis city is situated on the south of Slovakia in the heart of Nitra region. The city, with a population of almost 40 000 people and area 66km is the 15th most populated city in Slovakia. Nové Zámky is a culturally assorted city, 30% of the population consists of citizens of Hungarian nationality. It is situated 100km from the capital city Bratislava. It is a significant crossroad of southern Slovakia.\n\nNové Zámky had a lot of precious cultural and historical monuments, but they were irretrievably destroyed during WWII since it was the most bombed city in Slovakia. However, the city has still a lot to offer to visitors. One of these monuments is Anton Bernolák memorial, who was provost of Nové Zámky, Slovak writer, grammarian but mainly the first codifier of literary Slovak language. The Holy Trinity Chapel became his reverent place, which was situated on the stone cemetery in Nové Zámky but today it is a park on Bernolák square. Next significant architectural monuments are Franciscan Monastery, Roman Catholic Church, Church of the Elevation of the Holy Cross with remarkable sections of history. Nové Zámky has also its own Baroque Calvary and Holy Trinity sculpture, what is the memorial of great plague epidemy from 1740. Except these monuments, there is also orthodoxy synagogue in Nové Zámky, which was reconstructed in 1992. On the outside wall of a synagogue is the memorial board of holocaust.\n\nThe Slovak Arts Council promised financial support for cultural events and mainly to the promotion of theatre, dance, music, visual arts, literature but also of traditional culture and folk. Its ambition is to bring more cultural awareness into city life and improve cooperation with governmental institutions and non-profit organizations. Cultural agenda, which will be offered by the city, must have both Slovak and international importance.\n\nPetra Kňazeova from Slovak Arts Council said that, commission appreciated finalization of dramaturgical conception, which considers numerous target groups, great range of art genres, the participation of minorities and marginalised groups. The conception is balanced and provides a relatively exact vision of activities during 2020. The project has international and transboundary dimension, and not just because of cooperation, but also because of the quality of events. Budget calculates also with multisource funding, which will ensure running of the project in future.\n\nThe Slovak Arts Council chose project named VZDUŠNÉ ZÁMKY 2020. The main point is, except the other, culture offer enrichment of Nové Zámky by events, what absented in the city till now, creation of new cultural audience, initialization of reciprocal cooperation, improving of public areas, establishing of new cultural traditions and community life support.\n\nAgenda objectives of VZDUŠNÉ ZÁMKY 2020 are divided into 5 frame areas. The area of dialogue, solidarity, historical knowledge, education and regeneration via culture.\n\nDialogues create an area for recognition of various cultures, ideologies, mutual topics and intergenerational discussions. In this context it is planned to hold a series of discussions containing evenings talks and lectures of renowned experts and academics.\n\nSolidarity contains projects specialized on social coherence, active citizenship or activation of charity and human-rights projects. The main goal is improved society in the city and community life via culture and cultural cooperation.\n\nHistorical knowledge contains active inputs, mainly into the history of city.\n\nSignificant Education is specialized for support of own creativity, widening of cultural acknowledgement, art and organisation skills and for non-traditional forms of education and workshops.\n\nA natural part of the project is Regeneration via Culture part, which has the ambition to bring to audience cultural relax and entertaining widening of horizons. Various areas of art and culture will be presented by VZDUŠNÉ ZÁMKY also by Cultural acupuncture. Thanks to it, it will be possible to visit small cultural events also during regular walks. For example, in parks or bus stations.\n\nNové Zámky deserves the award Capital of Culture 2020 after two years of effort. We wish to Nové Zámky and to implementers a lot of successful cultural events in their city. After successful realisation of own cultural events, Nové Zámky should also think about the effort to achieve title European Capital of Culture. It is a successful presentation of Slovak cities and an important part of national branding."
