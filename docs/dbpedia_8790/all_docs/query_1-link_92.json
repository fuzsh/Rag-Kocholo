        "text": "Slovakia’s populist Prime Minister Robert Fico took his first trip outside the capital on Monday since resuming his duties after an assassination attempt.\n\nFico visited a farm in Slovenska Nova Ves, northeast of the capital of Bratislava, along with Agriculture Minister Richard Takac to check the grain harvest.\n\nFico said in a brief statement that Slovakia was not ready to lift a ban on imports of agricultural products from Ukraine and thanked farmers for their work.\n\nHe was using a walking stick and did not take any questions from the media.\n\nIt was his first official trip outside the capital since recovering from the May 15 attack in which he was shot in the abdomen as he greeted supporters in the town of Handlova, 85 miles northeast of the capital.\n\nFico made his first public appearance since the assassination attempt on Friday, when he gave a speech for a national holiday.\n\nHe has long been a divisive figure in Slovakia and beyond. He returned to power for the fourth time last year, when his leftist party, Smer, or Direction, won parliamentary elections campaigning on a pro-Russia and anti-American message.\n\nHis critics worry that Slovakia could abandon its pro-Western course and follow the direction of Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orban."
