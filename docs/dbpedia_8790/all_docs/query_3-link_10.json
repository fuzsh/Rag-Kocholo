        "text": "Bratislava has come a long way since Eurotrip (the movie). Part of a eight day trip I took last summer through Romania, Hungary, Austria, Germany and finally Czech Republic, where I spent the majority of the time, the small capital of Slovakia is anything but dreary.\n\nAfter spending a few days in Prague, I honestly wasn’t expecting much from the tiny city. But, to my surprise, it impressed me more than I would have thought. Part of the former Communist Czechoslovakia, Bratislava has changed dramatically over the years.\n\nAlthough its cityscape is characterized by medieval towers and magnificent 20th-century buildings, it has certainly also undergone a construction boom at the start of the 21st century. Most of its historical houses have been renovated in beautiful bright colors, and the Old Town, where St Martin’s Cathedral can be found, is thriving with charming cafes, restaurants, cute shops, and free concerts in Town Square.\n\nAlthough limited in space and population (some 450,000 people), there is plenty to see through the narrow cobblestone streets. They’re a few museums as well as numerous street performers. My favorite were the quirky statues scattered through the Old Town; they added a sprinkle of originality to the small capital.\n\nSimilar to its nearby neighbors Vienna and Budapest, Bratislava lies on both banks of the Danube River, the second largest river in Europe. The Danube River is undoubtedly one of the city’s main assets; it has thus significantly boosted the city’s tourism opportunities, given its city beach, river cruises and bike tours. The Nový Most Bridge (translated into “New Bridge”) that runs over the Danube is considered its most famous modern landmark.\n\nAnother outstanding feature of the city is Bratislava Castle, a vast rectangular building located on the rocky hill of the Little Carpathians, providing an excellent view of Bratislava and the Danube River.\n\nAlthough I wouldn’t advise visiting the city for more than a day, given its small size, Bratislava is definitely one of those surprising European gems, often overlooked."
