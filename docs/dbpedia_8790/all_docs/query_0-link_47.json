        "text": "Bratislava History\n\nIt’s been a rocky ride for Bratislava, but the city has emerged as a modern European metropolis.\n\nOriginally settled by Neolithic man from the late Stone Age, Bratislava later held a high status in the second century BC as an important Celtic defence and trading post.\n\nThe Romans built military camps here – one of which, Gerulata, lies under the modern suburb of Rusovce.\n\nBratislava first appears in written records in the 10th century, when it was part of the Moravian Empire, but it was annexed by Hungary in the 11th century.\n\nFrom 1536 to 1783, Bratislava was the capital of Hungary, known as Pozsony.\n\nDespite its population being decimated by plague in 1711, Bratislava reached its zenith in the mid-18th century under the patronage of Empress Marie Theresa.\n\nMaria Theresa’s successor was considerably less able however, and only three years after her death, the Hungarian capital became Budapest once more.\n\nBratislava was besieged by Napoleon’s troops in 1809. The castle was burnt down in 1811.\n\nAttempts were made to gain greater autonomy from Hungary, but following the establishment of the Dual Monarchy in 1867, Slovak culture was heavily suppressed.\n\nUntil 1918, the city was a 'resort' area of Austria-Hungary, called Pressburg in German. In 1919, the city was annexed to the Czechoslovak Republic.\n\nDuring WWII, a quasi-Nazi government was established in Slovakia. An armed uprising against this government in 1944 was crushed.\n\nSlovakia’s long years under Communist rule following the war were interrupted only once, briefly, when the reformist policies of Bratislava-born Party Secretary Alexander Dubček led to the Prague Spring of 1968 – after which the Soviet tanks rolled in.\n\nAfter the fall of Communism in 1989, Bratislava restored its Old Town and soon became a popular visitor destination.\n\nWhen Czechoslovakia split in 1993, Bratislava became the Slovak capital, joining the EU in 2004."
