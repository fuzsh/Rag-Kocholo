        "text": "Visiting Bratislava is an absolute ‘must’ when traveling to Slovakia. It is situated in the centre of Europe and strecthes across both banks of the mighty Danube. What’s more, its nickname is ‘Beauty on the Danube’ because of its numerous castles, cobblestone streets and enchanting classical architecture.\n\nIn addition, it is also known as the Little Big City because it is one of the smallest capitals of Europe. Furthermore, the Slovak capital is located on the western border of the country. It borders Austria and Hungary, making it the only national capital that borders two countries.\n\nThe weather is typical of continental Europe with warm summers and cold winters. The average daily temperature in summer is 21 °C and in winter –1 °C. Since I live in the Mediterranean, I prefer hot summers and beaches. Nevertheless, Bratislava delighted me as a destination for enjoying the joys of winter.\n\nDespite its size, Bratislava is full of character, split by one of Europe’s arterial rivers and surrounded by lush forests and mountains. Thus, all of these factors contribute to the feeling of peace and quiet wonder that the city radiates.\n\n1. Bratislava Sights To See\n\nBratislava is an underrated European destination but it has so much to offer! Namely, it is brimming with unique sights and gorgeous vistas, all in a familiar setting. What’s more, I absolutely loved how friendly the locals are and how intriguing the architecture is.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s find out what are the top attractions in Bratislava.\n\nBratislava Castle\n\nOn a hill above the old town, commanding the skyline, lies Bratislava Castle. It is one of my favorite attractions in the city and I try to visit it whenever I’m in Bratislava. Moreover, I found its history to be quite fascinating. Namely, it was built in the 9th century for centuries served as the place of coronation for Hungarian royalty. Over the course of history, the castle has been raided, razed, and rebuilt many times. What’s more, Maria Theresa of Austria had the castle remodelled, but in 1811 a fire broke out and devastated the castle. Bratislavans rebuilt it after WW2 and it has since been used for state functions.\n\nIn addition, the castle houses the Slovak National Museum and the Great-Moravian basilica on the eastern terrace. Also, I strongly recommend enjoying the panoramic view of the city from the castle walls.\n\nUFO Bridge and Tower\n\nThe SNP bridge is the 7th largest hanging bridge in the world. It connects Bratislava’s old town with the Petržalka district. Furthermore, the SNP stands for Slovak National Uprising, armed resistance to Axis occupation during WW2. The bridge is an architectural beauty but, I must admit, it is the tower that steals the show. Moreover, on top of the tower is a UFO-shaped cupola and a restaurant. I was super excited to dine there so, if you get the chance, I strongly reccommend you check it out. It’s so cool! Also, at 95 meters above ground, there’s an open-air observation deck that offers the best panoramic views of the city. You can easily reach it by an elevator and the entry fee for the UFO sighting deck is around €10.\n\nBlue Church\n\nThe Blue Church of Bratislava is like something out of a fairy tale. Personally, I’d say it’s one of the best things to see in Bratislava. The whole structure is painted in shades of blue, so during the day it resembles the colour of the sky. Namely, the facade is mostly blue with white highlights and decorative elements. Furthermore, the Church was built in the 20th century in Art Nouveau style. It was dedicated to Saint Elizabeth, Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary. She was known for helping the poor, so in her honor there is a portrait of her above the portal of the church. In addition, the church is a popular venue for weddings, so if you’re lucky, you might witness one during your visit!\n\nDevin Castle\n\nDevin Castle is one of the most important archaeological sites in Central Europe. And, if I may add, it is one of the most interesting sights in Bratislava. Namely, it is located on a high cliff overlooking the confluence of the Morava and Danube rivers, right on the border between Slovakia and Austria. Furthermore, it has been a border fortress for millennia. And it went through a lot. Namely, it was part of the Roman border, it witnessed the rise and fall of Great Moravia and was blown up by Napoleon’s army. Finally, in 1961, it was declared a National Historic Landmark and it has been untouched since. Nowadays, the castle is one of the most frequented tourist attractions in Slovakia with many stories to tell. Plus, I found it to be the perfect vantage point for viewing the Austrian countryside that stretches as far as the eye can see.\n\nOld Town Hall\n\nDating back to the 13th century the Old Town Hall is one of the oldest stone buildings still standing in Bratislava. Moreover, the Old Town Hall is beautiful both inside and out. Namely, it includes a basement, the Museum of City History (which takes up most of the space) and a tower that provides an amazing view of the city centre. Furthermore, the museum is full of cultural exhibitions and artefacts, well worth a visit. However, the basement is something else. I suggest you visit it only if you think you can handle what’s inside. Namely, it features an exhibit of grisly medieval torture devices. On the other hand, the tower is something everyone can enjoy. When lit, the colors change from blue to purple adding that something extra to the whole experience.\n\nSlavin Memorial\n\nIf you’re a history buff, this attraction is something you don’t want to miss. Namely, Slavin is a memorial monument dedicated to Soviet soldiers who fell during the liberation of the city in World War II. That is, it is both a monument and a military cemetery, holding 6,845 fallen soldiers. The monument stands in the middle of the cemetery: a mausoleum with an 11-meter high sculpture of a Soviet soldier. Situated atop a hill above Bratislava castle surrounded by trees, Slavin is perfect for a quiet stroll. I must add, the place exudes a special energy that leaves no one indifferent.\n\nKamzik Radio Tower\n\nKamzik Radio Tower is a TV tower with a restaurant, bar and observation deck. It si situated at the top of a hill, surrounded by a beautiful forest park. There are two good reasons why I enjoy visiting Kamzik again and again. Firstly, I enjoy taking the scenic winding trails of the forest park that lead to the tower. This way I get to enjoy the beauty of nature, which is pretty much the best thing to do ever, and I get to do some light exercise. It’s a win-win! Secondly, I really like exploring the tower and I always enjoy the view of the city and the surrounding forest. In case you stay there longer than you planned, like I always do, there’s a restaurant and a bar where you can enjoy a meal or a drink.\n\nMichael’s Gate\n\nThis gothic tower is one of the oldest buildings in the city. It is the last city gate that has been preserved since Medieval times, built in the mid 14th century. Furthermore, the tower has 7 floors and houses the small Museum of Weapons and City Fortifications. Moreover, at the top is a statue of the archangel Michael, slaying a dragon. In addition, if you’re looking for the perfect place to get a good photo, this is it! Oh and one more thing – on the street that passes through the gate is a circular brass ring that shows the direction and distances of 29 other capitals from Bratislava. So if you’re there, be sure to check it out.\n\nPrimatial Palace\n\nPrimatial Palace is one of the most beautiful and well-preserved classicist buildings in the capital of Slovakia. Namely, visitors can see St. George’s (the dragon slayer) Fountain in the courtyard and rest or simply enjoy the fresh air on one of the benches. Also, don’t worry – free wifi is available. Inside the palace, you can see gobelins from the 1630s, furniture from the 18th and 19th centuries, and the famous Hall of Mirrors. What’s more, Napoleon himself signed the peace treaty ‘The Peace of Pressburg’ in that hall in 1805.\n\nSt. Martin’s Cathedral\n\nSt. Martin’s Cathedral is the largest, as well as one of the oldest churches in Bratislava. Moreover, it was the coronation site of the Hungarian empire between 1563 and 1830. Queen Maria Theresa herself was crowned there as well as many other royals. Furthermore, the 85 m tall tower dominates the Old Town’s skyline, with a replica of the Hungarian royal crown on top. In addition, I highly suggest visiting the interesting underground crypts with catacombs, which are located beneath the cathedral.\n\n2. Fun Activities to do in Bratislava\n\nThey may call it Little Big City, but it’s still the capital. Namely, there are a lot of fun things to do in Bratislava. The city is full of unique architecture and artworks scattered around the old town. Just walking around Bratislava feels like you’re in an open-air museum! Furthermore, one of my favorite things to do in Bratislava is discovering the amazing panoramic views. There are numerous vantage points from which you can enjoy a wonderful view of the Danube River and the city. Another thing I especially enjoy when I’m in Bratislava is, of course, trying the best traditional Slovak food. I highly recommend it and I guarantee you will love it!\n\n3. Day Trips from Bratislava\n\nGiven such a favorable location, Bratislava has so many possibilities for a day trip that you won’t believe it! I mean, just think about this: it’s within an hour’s drive from Vienna (Austria), Brno (Czech Republic), and Gyor (Hungary). How amazing is that?\n\nIn case you wish to stay within Slovakia borders, I have a couple of ideas for you. Personally, these are the ones I consider to be the best day trips from Bratislava:\n\nPiešťany – a spa city with healing water\n\nPiešťany is a small town located only about 80 km from Bratislava. You can easily reach it by car or by train from Bratislava. The whole town is very charming but the best part is definitely the Spa Island. Namely, the site is not only excellent for relaxing, but it is also known for its several hot springs with healing thermal water. What’s more, you can try the water!\n\nTrenčín – a historical royal town\n\nTrenčín is another great option for a day trip from Bratislava. Namely, it is about 130 km away but it is connected to the capital by a main railway line, so it is super easy to get there. There are bus lines as well and the journey lasts about 1h 30mins. Furthermore, the main attraction is the Trenčín Castle whose history dates back to the Roman Empire. What’s more, near the lower castle there is a water well known as the “Well of Love”.\n\nČičmany – an authentic Slovak folk village\n\nČičmany is a small village located about 170 km from Bratislava. It is one of the most picturesque villages I’ve ever been to so I highly reccommend visiting it. Namely, it is famous for its log houses adorned with white decorations. Needless to say, strolling down its streets is like walking through an art gallery. What’s more, the village hosts a big celebration every year a week before Ash Wednesday. It is called the Fašiangy Carnival and it is a great opportunity to experience traditional Slovak folk music, dances and customs.\n\nTrnava – the “Slovak Rome”\n\nI’d say that Trnava is probably the best option for a day trip if you don’t want to spend too much time traveling. Namely, it is only about half an hour from Bratislava, and the two are connected by a railway line. Furthermore, because of the numerous churches in the center, Trnava is often called “Little Rome” or “Slovak Rome”. In additon, one of the most peculiar attractions in the town is the 19th-century synagogue transformed into a modern cafe.\n\nLittle Carpathians Wine Tour\n\nDid you know that Bratislava is surrounded by many amazing wine cellars? The tour will take you through vineyards located from Bratislava to Trnava. Also, many historical and royal places are on the way, as well as many good glasses of wine. In addition, while sipping on some good wine, you’ll hear some pretty inetersting stories. I really can’t think of a better way to spend a relaxing yet educational day.\n\n4. Bratislava By Night\n\nAlthough some other European cities such as Budapest or Prague have already earned the titles for the best nightlife of Central Europe, Slovakian capital is slowly but surely becoming part of that list. If you decide to get loose a little, here are some suggestions for the best night out in Bratislava.\n\nFor an easy start check out Uisce Beatha, a cosy pub where you can experience an authentic Czech atmosphere while drinking a beer and chatting with friends.\n\nIf you’re up for some splendid views while sipping a drink, go to UFO Bar and Restaurant for a 360° view of the entire Bratislava. Similar goes for Sky Bar which is located on the top of a building. Spend a luxurious night with friends and cocktails.\n\nFor a relaxed night out head to Nu Spirit Club with live music performances of all genres. To spice up the night, go to The Club, the biggest club in Bratislava that offers a great clubbing experience. Great cocktails and amazing vibes await in Rio Grande Club, and those seeking for the darkest techno sounds can visit Fuga and truly escape the reality. Hard rock lovers can find their kind of entertainment in Randal pub where they can enjoy all kinds of heavy metal sounds. If you’re still not tired after all the clubs close, head to Channels Club and dance till the sun comes out!\n\n5. How to Get to Bratislava\n\nOne of my favorite things about Bratislava is the location. It might sound silly, but hear me out. Namely, since it is located in the centre of Europe, Bratislava is a super easy place to visit! The Danube connects the Slovak capital to the rest of the continent, as well as the many highways and railways that crisscross the country.\n\nBy plane\n\nBratislava has direct flights to many European destinations which are provided by various airlines. The city’s airport – M. R. Štefanik Airport is located right outside of the capital, about a 20-minute drive from the city centre.\n\nIf you are coming from somewhere that doesn’t happen to have direct flights to Bratislava, there is a convenient solution. Across the border, Vienna Airport is only 40 kilometres west of Bratislava. It happens to also be one of the main ways to get to Slovakia.\n\nBy train\n\nIt’s possible to take a train from Bratislava directly to Vienna, Prague, Budapest and various parts of Slovakia and Europe.\n\nThere are two railway stations in the Slovak Capital, the Main Station and Petržalka. At the Main Station you will find numerous busses and trams and connect the station with the rest of the city. From the Main Station, it only takes 15 minutes on foot to get to the city centre. To get to and from the train station in Petržalka, take buses no. 80, 91, 93.\n\nBy boat\n\nThanks to being situated on the Danube, Bratislava has regular boat connections with Vienna. Schwedenplatz, the centre of Vienna, is connected to Bratislava by a regular catamaran, The Twin City liner, and other tour operators.\n\nBy bus\n\nBratislava is connected to many European cities via a continent-wide network of bus lines. There are frequent rides to the surrounding countries and other regions of Slovakia, such as Prague, Budapest and Krakow. The main bus station of Bratislava is the Mlynské Nivy bus station. Buses from Bratislava to Vienna operate every hour.\n\nBy car\n\nSeveral major motorways intersect in Bratislava. The distance to Vienna is only 65 km. To Budapest, it’s 200 km and to get to Prague you need to cross 330 km. An important detail to remember is, if you are bringing your personal car, you must display a valid motorway tax sticker. These are available at border crossings and petrol stations.\n\nSlovakia Visa Requirements\n\nSlovakia is a member of the Schengen Area, meaning that all EU visitors can enter the country without applying for a visa. If you’re a citizen of a country which is not a member of the Schengen Area, you will need to apply for a visa regarding the purpose of your trip. If travelling as a tourist you can apply for a short-term Schengen visa up to 90 days. For all other travelling purposes for non-Schengen Area citizens read the visa requirements.\n\nPublic Transportation in Bratislava (Getting Around)\n\nBratislava is relatively compact and its public transport is well developed, efficient and boasts a long tradition. There are a lot of ways to get around Bratislava and transport is inexpensive.\n\nThe Ticket System\n\nTickets for public transport are valid for a certain period of time and are only available from ticket-machines or kiosks. Keep in mind that you must validate the ticket once you’re inside the transport. The tickets are valid for all manner of public transport in the city and remain valid when changing from one type of transport to another.\n\nThe Little Big city also offers its guests a special way to explore the city, the Bratislava Card. The card grants guests free use of urban transport, a guided tour of the Old Town, and discounts on admission to museums and galleries. It also grants discounts of up to 50% for taxis and car hire. You can buy a card for 1, 2, or 3 days at any tourist information centre.\n\nTrams\n\nTrams are the most popular and fastest form of public transport in the city. They are reliable and on time, generally running from 5 a.m to 11:30 p.m. Here are the routes.\n\nBuses\n\nBuses also play a big role in the public transport system. After midnight, night buses operate at roughly one-hour intervals.\n\nTrolleybuses\n\nSome routes in the hilly parts of the city centre are electrified and serviced by trolleybuses. They have a long tradition and have been operating in the city for more than 100 years.\n\nCar\n\nDriving around Bratislava is safe, but it can be a hassle as there are a lot of vehicles on the road. Also, finding a parking spot in the city centre can be difficult so I prefer to use public transport.\n\nTaxi\n\nIf you’re planning to get a taxi, here’s a little tip: ordering a taxi over the phone is cheaper than hiring one from a stand or stopping it on the street. Also, keep in mind that every taxi driver must have a price list displayed in a visible location, use a fare meter and issue receipts on request.\n\nIn addition, Uber is available in Bratislava, so you can easily request a ride and see the approximate price.\n\nCycling\n\nYou can find cycle-paths along the Danube or in the suburban areas of the city. However, unlike other European cities, it is rare to see many bicycles on the roads of Bratislava.\n\nNonetheless, there are bicycles throughout the city that you can rent using the city’s bike-sharing project. Electric scooters are an option too. Some planning needs to go into the renting of these as they are only available through local companies.\n\nOn foot\n\nThe great thing about the Little Big City is that it is walkable. That is, the centre is relatively compact and the whole of the Old Town is a pedestrian zone. Therefore, you can find most of the sights between these two locations and they are easy to reach on foot.\n\nFind Parking in Bratislava\n\nAs in every city, finding parking in Bratislava can be tricky. However, I found it pretty convenient that the main roads of the city have digital information displays which show the number of vacant places in underground garages or car parks.\n\nIn addition, the city of Bratislava has a website where you can get information about parking machines, zones, parking lots, garages, etc.\n\nShopping in Bratislava\n\nAs a capital city located in Central Europe, Bratislava is obviously a great place for shopping as it offers all sorts of malls, markets and shops.\n\nIn the Old Town you will find plenty of stores, just stroll the main streets and discover what’s on offer. Moreover, I’d say that the Old Town is the best place to find all sorts of souvenirs, from Tokaji wine to jewellery.\n\nIf, however, you’re looking for all-in-one shopping spots, go to shopping centres Central, Eurovea or Aupark. Central is the easiest to reach and it offers plenty of shops, as well as cafes to relax on the top of the building. On the other hand, if you’re looking for the latest trends and modern brands, Aupark has a good selection of stores for your taste. And last but not least, Eurovea is the newest shopping centre located very close to Old Town. There you can combine shopping with other relaxing and entertaining facilities.\n\nIn addition, you will also find a lot of outlets of various brands where you can buy things for discounted prices.\n\nMoney Exchange in Bratislava\n\nThe currency used in Slovakia is euro. If you don’t have them on you before you arrive, you will have no problem exchanging your money. Namely, you can find plenty of ATMs, banks, and exchange offices scattered around Bratislava.\n\nWhere To Stay in Bratislava\n\nThe Slovak capital is located on the border of three countries and is only a one to three hour flight time from most major European cities. Therefore, Bratislava is full of all kinds of places to stay.\n\nUseful Contacts\n\n● Country dialing code: +421\n\n● Tourist Info Bratislava: +421 2/544 194 10\n\n● Emergency: + 421 112\n\n● Police: +421 158\n\n● Hospital: +421 2/572 901 11\n\n● Emergency medical service: +421 155\n\n● Pharmacy, open 24/7, Lekáreň Apoteka Alexandra: +421 917 721 925\n\nIs tap water safe to drink in Slovakia?\n\nTap water is safe to consume across the country, the tap water in Bratislava is some of the cleanest in the world.\n\nWhat type of plug do they use in Slovakia?\n\nThe power plugs and sockets are of type E, the type C plug works with the type E socket.\n\nIs the city of Bratislava safe?\n\nYes, Slovakia as a whole is a safe country to visit.
