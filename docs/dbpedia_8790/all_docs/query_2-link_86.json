        "text": "Dobry\n\nden. (Good day.) Welcome to Bratislava.\n\nBRATISLAVA, the powerful capital of Hungary for more than three centuries\n\nduring the Middle Ages, is now the bustling modern capital\n\nof Slovakia (the home of Andy Warhol’s parents). This\n\npicturesque city, situated where the Danube River meets the Carpathian\n\nMountains, borders Austria in the west and Hungary in the\n\nsouth.\n\nFormerly a part of Czechoslovakia, Bratislava became the capital of the\n\nSlovak Republic on January 1, 1993. It is the seat of\n\nthe most important political, scientific, industrial, commercial,\n\neducational and cultural institutions of Slovakia. Bratislava,\n\nformerly known as Pressburg, is populated by some 599,000 Slovaks.\n\nBratislava\n\nCastle, built more than 1000 years ago on a promontory some 270 feet above\n\nthe Danube, dominates the city as it stands guard over the\n\nriver. The landmark castle derived its nickname of the\n\n“upturned table” from its silhouette that gives\n\nthat appearance. From the castle grounds, one can enjoy a\n\npanoramic view of the city’s contrasting architecture.\n\nThe\n\nbaroque, historic, Old Quarter of Bratislava is in sharp\n\ncontrast to the unsightly concrete structures erected by\n\nthe Communists in the 1970s. The Old Quarter houses a wide\n\nspectrum of museums and galleries.\n\nThe Slovak National Theatre has\n\nhoused Slovak National Theatre ensembles since 1920, but today only the opera\n\nand ballet ensembles are resident. It was restored between 1969 and 1972,\n\nwhen a new modern technical building was added behind the old building. Immediately\n\nin front of the theatre is the famous Ganymede’s Fountain by Bratislava native sculptor Viktor Oskar Tilgner.\n\nTHE OLD SLOVAK NATIONAL THEATRE BUILDING\n\nThe Slovak\n\nNational Museum (Slovenske Narodne Muzeum), a monumental\n\nbuilding completed in 1928, features a department that documents and\n\nhonors the culture of the Jewish people in\n\nSlovakia. The Museum of Viticulture, that\n\ndocuments the history of wine-growing in Bratislava, and The\n\nClock Museum are also worth visiting.\n\nThe Museum of Jewish Culture (Muzeum Zidovskej Kultury) founded\n\nin 1991, displays an interesting collection of\n\nJewish artifacts, The once-vibrant Jewish ghetto was destroyed by the\n\nCommunists and replaced by the Novy Most (New Bridge). In\n\n1972. When the Communists demolished the run-down Jewish\n\nQuarter, they justified their actions by claiming they were destroying\n\nhouses of ill repute. A touching Holocaust Memorial, inscribed\n\nwith the single word Pamataj! (Remember!) stands on the site where the\n\nold synagogue was destroyed. A likeness of the\n\nold synagogue is etched into the granite wall behind the memorial.\n\nHOLOCAUST MEMORIAL…PAMATAJ! (REMEMBER!\n\nBronze street sculptures, like the one of\n\nplumber peeking out from a manhole in the street, are fun works of art.\n\nPLUMBER PEEKING OUT FROM MANHOLE\n\nA statue of a Napoleonic soldier leaning on\n\nbench is one of several humorous statues which grace the streets of the Slovak\n\ncapital. This one is in the Main Square (Hlavne\n\nnamestie).\n\nNAPOLEONIC SOLDIER AND FRIENDS LEANING ON BENCH\n\nSlovak dishes that go right to the hips and the arteries include: palacinky (crepes)\n\nserved with chocolate sauce, ice cream or preserves; vyprazany\n\nsyr (fried cheese with tartar sauce); and tatranska hrianka (Tatra\n\ntoast), a sinful concoction of goose livers sauteed with sweet red\n\npeppers and served on thick slabs of homemade bread. Hradna\n\nVinaren, housed in the former Castle stables, is one of the best restaurants\n\nin town. With a panoramic view of the Old Town, huge\n\nchandeliers cast a glow on a feast of hearty Slovak and international\n\ncuisine. Slovenska Restauracia, opposite the Carlton Hotel near\n\nthe Opera House, is also a good place to try traditional\n\nSlovak cuisine. During dinner hours, Slovak music adds to the\n\natmosphere.\n\nSLOVAK DINNER MUSIC\n\nIn addition to Slovak food, restaurants in Bratislava feature Italian,\n\nAsian, Balkan, Kosher, and French food.\n\nWine bars and cellars scattered throughout Old Town are the best places\n\nfor tasting the Riesling, Gewurztraminer, and other\n\nwines (vino) of the region. Martiner and Gold Fassel are\n\nthe beers (pivot) of choice.\n\nShop for handicrafts including valenky (brightly colored felt\n\nboots), porcelain, ceramics, wood carvings, embroidery, lace,\n\nand pottery.\n\nDo videnia. (Goodby) Bratislava/ ’Til we meet again.\n\nTEXT AND PHOTOS by JANET STEINBERG\n\nSTEINBERG is the winner of 43 national Travel Writer Awards.
