Slovakia’s capital, Bratislava—also known as the Beauty of the Danube—is a striking city with a rich history. The capital is placed in one of the most dynamically developing regions of central Europe, which makes it a perfect place for our office.

In recent years, our team has taken part in several signiﬁcant development projects in Bratislava. The size and scope of these projects is gradually changing the city’s outlook from grey communist-era buildings to modern, sustainable structures. The Twin City Sever development in particular is a landmark project for this region.
