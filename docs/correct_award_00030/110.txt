* The 2007 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded jointly to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Al Gore "for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change."

All IPCC authors participated in this prize. Later, the Green Party organized an all-party event in the West Block of Parliament to honour the Canadian IPCC-Peace Prize award winners.
