The Nobel Prize Committee’s decision to award the Peace Prize to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a welcome recognition of these scientists’ work in providing a comprehensive survey of climate change science and irrefutable proof about the phenomenon and its consequences.

For some time now the European Economic and Social Committee has been arguing that the debate about how to counter climate change should not obscure the equally urgent debate about how to live with it. The EESC has further insisted that it is high time that the EU and its institutions learn, not only to ‘talk the talk’, but to ‘walk the walk’.

We are therefore delighted that two of the IPCC’s eminent scientists, Professors Jean Jouzel and Peter Bosch, will be attending a special open plenary session of the EESC next week (24 October 2007) to debate, together with representatives of the Portuguese presidency of the EU, the future Slovenian presidency and EESC members, how civil society, and particularly organised civil society, can help us adapt to a world that is not only changing but which has already changed. In that context, the Committee will be debating and adopting an own-initiative opinion on climate change and the Lisbon Strategy which calls, inter alia, for more joined-up thinking regarding the EU’s strategic objectives.
