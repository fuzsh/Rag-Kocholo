The list, now in its sixteenth year, recognizes the activism, innovation and achievement of the world’s most influential individuals.\n\n“This selection reflects the achievements of the whole IPCC. I am very pleased that the work of the IPCC has been recognized in this way. In particular, I believe that it's a recognition of the extraordinary achievement of the IPCC over the last thirty years, which has transformed the discussion of climate change around the world.\" said Hoesung Lee reacting to the news.\n\nTIME editors have said of the list in the past, “The TIME 100 is a list of the world's most influential men and women, not its most powerful, though those are not mutually exclusive terms. While power is certain, influence is subtle. As much as this exercise chronicles the achievements of the past year, we also focus on figures whose influence is likely to grow, so we can look around the corner to see what is coming.\"\n\nTIME's profile on Hoesung Lee is available here.\n\nThe full list and related tributes appear in the April 29, 2019 issue of TIME, available on newsstands on Friday, April 19, and now at time.com/time100\n\nFormer IPCC author Michael Mann named 2019 Tyler Prize Laureate\n\nPicture by Tyler Prize\n\nFormer IPCC author Michael Mann has been awarded the 2019 Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement together with Warren Washington from the United States National Center for Atmospheric Research.\n\nThe Tyler Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement was established to recognise individuals who have contributed in an outstanding manner to scientific knowledge and public leadership to preserve and enhance the environment.\n\nMann received the award for his research in reconstructing the Earth's past climate and placing modern climate change in a long-term context, as well as for his communications and outreach efforts.\n\nHe was a Lead Author of Chapter 2 of the Working Group I contribution to the IPCC Third Assessment Report in 2001 (which includes the well known temperature reconstruction or hockey stick graph) and a contributing author to several other chapters in the same volume. He was also an expert reviewer of the Working Group I contribution to the Fourth Assessment Report in 2007.\n\nMann is Distinguished Professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University.\n\nFor more information visit: www.tylerprize.org.\n\nFormer IPCC Co-Chair, Susan Solomon, awarded top Swedish prize\n\nPicture by Justin Knight\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy has awarded former IPCC Working Group I Co-Chair Susan Solomon the Crafoord Prize in Geosciences. Solomon and her co-recipient, Syukuro Munabe, received the prize for their “fundamental contributions to understanding the role of atmospheric trace gases in Earth’s climate system.”\n\nSolomon was selected for her work in Antarctica that explained why the ozone layer was thinning. Through her research, she identified the mechanism for ozone destruction and the cause: chlorofluorocarbons. Chlorofluorocarbons are chemicals that were once widely used as refrigerants and aerosol propellants. Solving the ozone puzzle led governments to agree on a global solution to phase out the gases destroying the ozone layer and replace them with safer options in the Montreal Protocol.\n\nThe Crafoord Prize of Geosciences is an annual award started by Swedish industrialist Holger Crafoord and his wife Anna-Greta Crafoord. The Royal Swedish Academy selects the Crafoord Laureates. Solomon and Manabe will share 6 million Swedish kronor, equivalent to about US$690,000.\n\nAn atmospheric chemist, Susan Solomon was Co-Chair of IPCC’s Working Group I from 2002 to 2008. With her fellow Co-Chair, Dahe Qin, she led the preparation of the Working Group I contribution to the Fourth Assessment Report, Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis. She is the Lee and Geraldine Martin Professor of Environmental Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 2008, Solomon was named by Time magazine as one of the world’s 100 most influential people\n\nCatholic Academy of Bavaria honours former IPCC Co-Chair Edenhofer\n\nPicture by Photothek\n\nFormer Working Group III Co-Chair Ottmar Edenhofer has been awarded the Romano Guardini Prize by the Catholic Academy of Bavaria for his “…outstanding merits to the interpretation of time and world in all areas of spiritual life.”\n\nEdenhofer is the Chief Economist and Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. As Co-Chair he jointly led the preparation of the Working Group III contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report, Climate Change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change.\n\n“As a renowned economist, committed political advisor, and public admonisher, Ottmar Edenhofer has restlessly pointed to climate change as one of the most pressing problems on Earth, and has proposed concrete solutions,” said the Catholic Academy in their citation. “Not least Pope Francis was seeking Ottmar Edenhofer's advice repeatedly and intensively for his encyclical Laudato Si'. Both are convinced that environmental degradation and poverty are closely intertwined problems that can only be resolved together in the concern about our common house,” the Academy added.\n\nEdenhofer is a member of Germany's Leibniz Association and directs the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change. He is an advisor to the World Bank, European Commission and the German government.\n\nThe award ceremony will take place in Munich, Germany, at the beginning of July 2018.\n\nFormer IPCC Co-Chair awarded 2018 Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement\n\nPicture by Katie Voss\n\nJames McCarthy, former IPCC Working Group II Co-Chair, has been awarded this year’s Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement together with Paul Falkowski. James McCarthy and Paul Falkowski have been given the Prize “…for their decades of leadership in understanding - and communicating - the impacts of climate change” according to a press release from the University of Southern California who administer the Prize.\n\nThe Tyler Prize was established in 1973 by the late John and Alice Tyler to recognize individuals who have contributed in an outstanding manner to the scientific knowledge and public leadership to preserve and enhance the environment.\n\n“Dr McCarthy’s pioneering research on marine nutrient cycles added significantly to our understanding of human activity on Earth’s climate. But scientific research cannot be of greatest benefit to human kind, unless it leads to improved policy. It was this that convinced Dr McCarthy to engage with some of the world’s best environmental researchers and international policy leaders, to assess the global impacts of climate change,” states the press release.\n\nAt the IPCC, James McCarthy led Working Group II together with his Argentinian counterpart Osvaldo Canziani, and prepared Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, the Working Group II contribution to the Third Assessment Report. He was also a Lead Author on the Fourth Assessment Report among his other IPCC roles.\n\nHe is currently the Alexander Agassiz Professor of Biological Oceanography at Harvard University.\n\nThe Tyler Prize will be officially presented at a ceremony in Washington D.C., USA, on 3 May 2018.\n\nFor more information visit: www.tylerprize.org.\n\nFormer IPCC Co-Chair Stocker awarded top Swiss science prize\n\nThomas Stocker, former Co-Chair of Working Group I of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has been awarded the 2017 Marcel Benoist Swiss Science Prize – popularly known as the “Swiss Nobel”. Stocker was awarded the prize for his work on climate modelling and ice core analysis, which demonstrated the reality of climate change and its resulting consequences.\n\n“In keeping with the objects of the Foundation, his research findings are of great importance to human life, and address one of the main challenges facing today’s society,” said the Marcel Benoit Foundation in its citation.\n\nThe current head of the Climate and Environmental Physics Division of the Physics Institute of the University of Bern, Stocker is a key player in climate research on the national and international level. In his field, he is one of the most widely cited scientists in Switzerland, and he is the author and co-author of more than 200 scientific articles.\n\nBorn in 1959, Stocker was elected in 2008 as Co-Chair of the IPCC’s Working Group I, which assesses the physical science basis of climate change. In this role he jointly led the preparation of the Working Group I contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report, which was finalized in 2013.\n\nUNEP’s Deputy Executive Director visits IPCC Secretariat\n\nThe Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Ibrahim Thiaw, visited the Secretariat of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in Geneva on 25 April 2017.\n\nUNEP jointly with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) established the IPCC in 1988 to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts.\n\nBefore visiting the IPCC Secretariat, Deputy Executive Director Thiaw met with the Secretary General of the WMO, Petteri Taalas.\n\nKerstin Stendahl receives award as champion for gender equality in environment\n\nKerstin Stendahl, Deputy Secretary of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has received an award as a champion for gender equality in the field of environment on the occasion of International Women's Day on 8 March 2017. The award ceremony, chaired by the World Meteorological Organization Deputy Secretary-General Elena Manaenkova, was organized by the Geneva Environment Network (GEN) to recognize the commitment and contribution of Geneva-based individuals to the advancement and support of gender equality and women's empowerment in the field of environment.\n\nShe has always worked on issues relating to international environmental law, governance and policy. Throughout her career, at national, regional and international levels she has devoted particular attention to gender issues, by highlighting and developing training opportunities and award schemes as well as emphasizing gender aspects of recruitment policies and practices and in day-to-day work.\n\nKerstin Stendahl started at the Ministry of the Environment in Finland in the summer of 1992, right after the first Rio conference on sustainable development. She has worked on forest biodiversity issues in the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity in Montreal and on environmental economics as well as genetic resources for food and agriculture for the Nordic Council of Ministers. She also made a foray into the field of environmental science/policy issues as a Scientific Advisor with the Academy of Finland. In 1996 she was elected one of three co-chairs for the intergovernmental process on synergies among the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions as part of her dossier on the strengthening of international environmental governance.

It can be difficult to navigate through this material to find what you are looking for. This is particularly true of the Synthesis Report. The Synthesis Report, as its name implies, distils and integrates the findings of the full IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. Although it’s a concise document of about 130 pages, it also references the three IPCC Working Group contributions released between September 2013 and April 2014, totalling some 4,700 pages in all, and assessing over 30,000 scientific papers.\n\nAs part of its efforts to make its products more accessible, the IPCC has developed a new website for the Synthesis Report. This includes a clean, user-friendly design that makes it easy to navigate around the Synthesis Report itself, and simple to generate social media based on the content. An important feature is that references to the full Working Group contributions are live links taking users to that material. For this purpose the Synthesis Report and Working Group reports have been converted to HTML to speed up the download in locations with limited bandwidth or for users on mobile devices.\n\nUsers should bear in mind that the official IPCC reports are the PDFs already on the main IPCC website or available in print, and that these new pages are intended to help non-specialist users navigate easily around the Fifth Assessment Report. The new website includes links to the original Synthesis Report PDFs. Users who want to download high-resolution IPCC figures in the original quality should go to the official PDF versions.\n\nThe IPCC would welcome feedback on this website. Please send it to ipcc-media@wmo.int . Please report any divergences between this digital version and the official versions of the report to ipcc-sec@wmo.int .\n\n[Link to new website]\n\nMessage from the Secretary of the IPCC, Renate Christ\n\nRenate Christ\n\nI have reached mandatory retirement age and therefore I will leave the IPCC Secretariat at the end of May 2015. It was a pleasure and privilege to serve the IPCC as Secretary and I want to thank everyone who has supported the IPCC and me over the past years. I wish the IPCC a very successful continuation of its important assessment work.\n\n[Letter from Renate Christ to IPCC Authors and Review Editors on her retirement, 23 April 2015]\n\nIPCC agrees on Acting Chair after R.K. Pachauri steps down\n\nThe Bureau of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) agreed on Tuesday, in accordance with its procedures, to designate Vice-Chair Ismail El Gizouli as Acting IPCC Chair. The designation of Gizouli follows the decision by Rajendra K Pachauri, PhD, to step down as Chairman of the IPCC effective today.\n\n[Press Release]\n\n[Letter from R.K. Pachauri]\n\n[CV of Acting Chair of IPCC]\n\nIPCC website language pages\n\nIn line with the IPCC Communications Strategy, which encourages the IPCC to provide communication products in the official UN languages to the extent possible, we are pleased to announce that the IPCC website now has new language pages which can be accessed from the Languages drop-down menu on the top right-hand corner of the IPCC home page.\n\n[Full Announcement]\n\nIPCC Co-Chair Christopher Field receives 2014 Roger Revelle Medal\n\nChris Field\n\nThe American Geophysical Union (AGU) has announced that Christopher Field, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group II, has been awarded the prestigious Roger Revelle Medal. The AGU awardees are honoured for their accomplishments in \"advancing Earth and space science and their outstanding contributions and service to the scientific community\".

The first funding partner of the Programme was Gro Harlem Brundtland, former Norwegian Prime Minister and UN Special Envoy on Climate Change. Dr Brundtland made her donation from the Tallberg Leadership Award, which she received in June 2009.\n\nThe IPCC welcomes contributions to the scholarship programme and is happy to provide further information to prospective funding partners.\n\nFor more information on the Scholarship Programme visit the IPCC Scholarship Programme page.\n\nIPCC Co-Chair named 2013 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award laureate\n\nChris Field\n\nDr. Christopher Field, Co-Chair of the Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has been awarded the 2013 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the climate change category.\n\nDr. Field received the award for discovering the importance of ecosystems and their effective management in the battle against climate change. According to the BBVA Foundation, his research has “…allowed to quantify the global climate impact of deforestation, agriculture and other changes in vegetation cover. And vice versa. It has helped predict how climate change will impact on land ecosystems.”\n\nThe jury said the award recognizes Dr. Field’s fundamental contributions to understanding the interactions between the dynamics of plants and land ecosystems and CO2 released through human activities.\n\n“His visionary research on the global carbon cycle demonstrated that projections of future climate require the explicit consideration of land ecosystems and their management,” the jury added in a citation.\n\nDr. Field is the founding director of the Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology, Professor of Biology and Environmental Earth System Science at Stanford University, and Faculty Director of Stanford's Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve. The author of more than 200 scientific publications, Dr. Field’s research emphasizes impacts of climate change, from the molecular to the global scale. His work includes major field experiments on responses of California grassland to multi-factor global change, integrative studies on the global carbon cycle, and assessments of impacts of climate change on agriculture.\n\nThe BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Awards seek to recognize and encourage world-class research and artistic creation, prizing contributions of broad impact for their originality and theoretical significance. The BBVA Foundation is part of the corporate social responsibility arm of the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA Group) - a multinational Spanish banking group.\n\nPrevious recipients of the same award include U.S scientist and former IPCC Working Group I Co-Chair Susan Solomon.\n\nIPCC WGI Co-Chair is awarded 2013 Volvo Environment Prize\n\nQin Dahe\n\nOn 21 October 2013, the Volvo Environment Prize Foundation announced that Dr. Qin Dahe, Co-Chair, IPCC Working Group I, has been awarded the 2013 Volvo Environment Prize.\n\nAs indicated in the prize citation, \"Throughout his very distinguished career, Dr Qin Dahe has made outstanding contributions to the scientific understanding of the climate, both in his own country of China and at the global level. He has generated an exceptional body of research on the dynamics of glaciers and ice sheets, an important component of the climate system. (…) Building on this impressive scientific base, Dr Qin has played a leading role the pre- eminent assessment body for climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). He first became involved in the IPCC with its Third Assessment Report, published in 2001, and then assumed the prestigious leadership role of co- Chair of Working Group 1 (Science) of the Fourth Assessment Report, released in 2007. He has continued in this role in the Fifth Assessment Report, due to be released in October 2013. (…) One of Dr Qin's most important contributions to climate policy was his leadership role in the IPCC's Special Report on Climatic Extremes, published in 2012.\" He is the first Chinese laureate.\n\nThe Volvo Environment Prize is awarded for \"Outstanding innovations or scientific discoveries which in broad terms fall within the environmental field\", and is awarded by an independent foundation, which was instituted in 1988. Over the last two decades the Volvo Environment Prize has become one of the scientific world's most respected environmental prizes. Since the first award in 1990, the prize has gone to 40 people. Laureates represent all fields of environmental and sustainability studies and initiatives. Among them are many well-known names and three Nobel Prize winners.\n\nhttp://www.environment-prize.com/content/view/87/142/\n\nPress release from the Volvo Environment Prize Foundation (Oct 21, 2013).\n\nIPCC Chairman awarded Pico della Mirandola Prize\n\nRajendra K. Pachauri\n\nRajendra K. Pachauri, Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has been awarded the Pico della Mirandola Prize in its international category for his work on climate change and sustainability challenges with the IPCC, the Energy and Resource Institute (TERI) and other national and international organizations.\n\nPast winners in the prize’s international category include former International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus; former European Commission President Jacques Delors; Nobel Economics Laureate (2006) Edmund Phelps; and Colombian artist and sculptor Fernando Botero.\n\nThe prize is named after Italian Renaissance philosopher Giovanni Pico who wrote a defining text of Renaissance humanism, the Oration on the Dignity of Man, which is known as the ‘Manifesto of the Renaissance’. The award recognizes personalities who contribute a humanistic approach to knowledge in the spirit of Pico’s work. A biennial event, the prestigious Italian prize is awarded across artistic, cultural, social, economic, financial and entrepreneurial categories and is presented in international, national and local sections.\n\nIPCC Co-Chair and Lead Author awarded Max Planck Research Prize\n\nChris Field\n\nMarkus Reichstein\n\nTwo scientists associated with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have been awarded one of Germany’s most prestigious prizes.\n\nIPCC Working Group II Co-Chair Christopher Field and Markus Reichstein, a lead author on the IPCC's Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) have been jointly awarded the Max Planck Research Prize.\n\nField and Reichstein received the prize \"because they have significantly increased our knowledge of how life on Earth responds to climate change and what reactions can be anticipated between the biosphere and the atmosphere… their work also helps us to estimate the consequences of climate change for the people of the planet,\" the Max Planck Society said.\n\nField is the founding director of the Department of Global Ecology at the Carnegie Institution for Science and holds two professorships at Stanford University. He studies how photosynthesis correlates with light absorption to estimate the amount of biomass that plants build up, which is the experimental basis for his global modeling of biogeochemical and ecological relationships to determine the effect of climate change on the biosphere. He is one the two Co-Chairs of IPCC Working Group II, which deals with impacts, adaptation and vulnerability. He was also a Coordinating Lead Author of the Working Group II contribution to the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report.\n\nReichstein, who heads the Department of Biogeochemical Integration at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, served as one of the Lead Authors of Chapter 3 of SREX on changes in climate extremes and their impacts on the natural physical environment.\n\nThe Max Planck Research Prize is funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research. It is conferred annually to two internationally renowned scientists, one who works in Germany and another who works in another country.\n\nPast and present Bureau members honoured\n\nJean Jouzel\n\nSusan Solomon, the Ellen\n\nSwallow Richards Professor\n\nof Atmospheric Chemistry\n\nand Climate Science at MIT\n\nPhoto by: Dominick Reuter\n\nTwo past and present IPCC Bureau members have won the 2012 Vetlesen Prize for their work on the ozone hole and ice cores. Susan Solomon, Co-Chair of Working Group I from 2002 to 2008, and Jean Jouzel, Vice-Chair of Working Group I since 2008, share the $250,000 award, considered to be the earth sciences equivalent of a Nobel Prize. \"Earth Science is a collective enterprise, and transformational advances are the product of many authors,\" said the Vetlesen Prize committee's citation. \"Both nominees have made leading and fundamental contributions to climate science.\" Solomon was honoured for her work in identifying the cause of Antarctica's springtime ozone losses, which helped bring about a global ban on manmade ozone- depleting chemicals. Jouzel has extracted the longest-yet climate record from polar ice cores, charting temperatures in Antarctica for the past 800,000 years.\n\nSolomon, currently Ellen Swallow Richards Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has also been awarded the fifth BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the climate change category. Solomon received the award for her work on determining how human action alters the composition of the atmosphere and how, in turn, these changes affect Earth's climate. The award citation states that Solomon \"has contributed, through her research and leadership, to the safeguarding of our planet.\"\n\nArchives\n\nShow Archive\n\nJuraj Farkaš 10 August 2019\n\nIt is with great sadness that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has learnt of the sudden death of Juraj Farkaš on 10 August 2019 at the age of 55.\n\nJuraj Farkaš was a Lead Author for IPCC’s 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Volume 5 (Waste).

At the First Session of the Panel (Geneva, 9-11 November 1988), Professor Izrael was appointed Chair of Working Group II. The Working Group was tasked with viewing the environmental and socio-economic impacts of climate change in an integrated manner. Its report The IPCC Impacts Assessment was finalized in May 1990 in Moscow and formed part of the first IPCC Assessment Report.\n\nAt the 8th Session of the IPCC (Harare, Zimbabwe, 11-13 November 1992), Professor Izrael was elected IPCC Vice-Chair, a position he held until 2008. In his 20 years of involvement with the IPCC as member of the Bureau, Professor Izrael was an advocate of scientific excellence. He emphasized the importance of observational networks and comprehensive monitoring of environmental changes and the need for long-term scenarios of climate change and possible impacts. He was also instrumental in shaping the IPCC’s processes and procedures: he highlighted potential weaknesses in the processes and was a strong supporter of the participation of experts from all regions of the world in the IPCC’s work. Until the end of his term in the IPCC Bureau he proved to be a strong source of support and ensured the development of a robust fourth Assessment Report. Professor Izrael was a member of the IPCC delegation in Oslo when the IPCC received the 2007 Nobel Peace Price together with former U.S. Vice-President Al Gore.\n\nProfessor Izrael devoted special attention to environmental sciences, meteorology and climatology and to his work in international organizations, particularly the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). He was Vice-President of the WMO for 12 years. He participated in the formulation of the new World Climate Programme and its climate change impacts component. His wide interests in the field of ecology and protecting the human environment and oceans are embodied in his monographs Ecology and Control of the Natural Environment and Anthropogenic Ecology of the Ocean. In 1990, Professor Izrael established the Institute of Global Climate and Ecology and was its director until 2011. From 1996 until 2002, he served as academic secretary of the Department of Oceanology, Atmospheric Physics and Geography of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In the last few years, he continued to work as a senior research fellow of the Institute he had set up and as adviser to the Russian Academy of Sciences.\n\nAll of us who had the privilege of working with Professor Izrael will greatly miss his thoughtful advice. He was unstinting in sharing his wisdom. Yuri was also a generous and warm personality and we will greatly miss his friendliness and his sense of humour.
