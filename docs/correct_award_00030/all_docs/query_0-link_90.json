        "text": "KWAME HOLMAN:\n\nThis year's Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the former vice president and a U.N. panel of scientists for creating greater consciousness and a growing consensus about climate change and the dangers it poses.\n\nSpeaking in Palo Alto, California, Gore thanked the Nobel committee for elevating awareness.\n\nAL GORE, Former Vice President of the United States: It is the most dangerous challenge we've ever faced, but it is also the greatest opportunity that we have ever had to make changes that we should be making for other reasons anyway.\n\nThis is a chance to elevate global consciousness about the challenges that we face now. It truly is a planetary emergency, and we have to respond quickly.\n\nThere's an old African proverb that says, \"If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\" We have to go far, quickly, and that means we have to quickly find a way to change the worlds' consciousness about exactly what we're facing and why we have to work to solve it.\n\nI'm going back to work right now. This is just the beginning."
