        "text": "When Al Gore met the press Friday morning in Palo Alto, four Stanford researchers stood by his side.\n\nStephen Schneider, Terry Root, Chris Field and Thomas Heller are among the roughly 2,000 scientists and policy experts from around the world who have made contributions to the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with the former vice president.\n\nGore had been a favorite to win the prize, but Field, a professor of biological sciences and a member of the panel, said he was “blown away that it went to the IPCC as well.”\n\nThe Nobel committee awarded the prize to the IPCC and Gore “for efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change.”\n\nSince its founding in 1988 in Geneva, Switzerland, the IPCC has published a series of scientific reports—the consensus of leading researchers from 120 countries—that have “created an ever-broader informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming,” according to the Nobel citation. The reports have provided scientific legitimacy to governmental efforts to deal with climate change.\n\nGore said he was proud to share the award with the IPCC scientists “who have tirelessly and selflessly worked on this for so many years.”\n\nSchneider, another key Stanford player on the panel, said he heard about the Nobel when he returned home from Wyoming, where he had been “arguing with the coal industry” about carbon dioxide emissions. It was a typical outing for Schneider, who has been studying global warming for four decades. His first congressional testimony on the subject was in 1981 before a committee chaired by Gore.\n\nThese Stanford researchers are lead authors of several major IPCC reports:\n\nChris Field, professor of biological sciences and director of the Carnegie Institution’s Department of Global Ecology at Stanford;\n\nThomas Heller, the Lewis Talbot and Nadine Hearn Shelton Professor of International Legal Studies and senior fellow at the Woods Institute for the Environment and at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies;\n\nMichael Mastrandrea, research associate at the Woods Institute and lecturer in the School of Earth Sciences;\n\nTerry Root, senior fellow at the Woods Institute;\n\nStephen Schneider, the Melvin and Joan Lane Professor for Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies and senior fellow at the Woods Institute;\n\nJohn Weyant, professor (research) of management science and engineering.\n\nAn expert on the effects of climate change on North America, Field said that Stanford has played an instrumental role in the work of the IPCC.\n\nHis own research includes experiments at the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, a 1,189-acre research site in the foothills west of the main campus, where the environment of an outdoor meadow can be altered (by using heaters to raise the temperature, for example) to help predict the future of a warmer Earth.\n\nHe noted that the symptoms of warming are already being seen in heat waves, increased forest fires, fierce hurricanes and sea-level change.\n\n“Climate change expresses itself in extreme events,” he said.\n\nRoot, who was editor of an IPCC report, said shaping every sentence to win a consensus of the international community was not easy. “It’s very difficult. It takes a lot of effort,” she said."
