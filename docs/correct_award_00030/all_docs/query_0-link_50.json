        "text": "Former US vice president Al Gore and the Geneva-based United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nSwiss climate researchers have hailed the decision, saying it is also a recognition of their work and that it will boost efforts to combat global warming.\n\nGore and the IPCC were honoured on Friday for their efforts to build up and disseminate knowledge about man-made climate change and to lay the foundations for fighting it.\n\nThe former vice president, who won an Academy Award earlier this year for his film “An Inconvenient Truth”, had been widely tipped to win the prestigious prize but he and the agency will share it.\n\n“His strong commitment, reflected in political activity, lectures, films and books, has strengthened the struggle against climate change,” the citation said.\n\n“He is probably the single individual who has done most to create greater worldwide understanding of the measures that need to be adopted.”\n\nGore called the award meaningful because of his co-winner, calling the IPCC the “world’s pre-eminent scientific body devoted to improving our understanding of the climate crisis.”\n\nHe warned that global warming was not a political issue but a worldwide crisis.\n\n“We face a true planetary emergency. It is a moral and spiritual challenge to all of humanity,” he said. “It is also our greatest opportunity to lift global consciousness to a higher level.”\n\nBern University has played a part in Gore’s achievement. Climate research carried out there, including the retreat of alpine glaciers and greenhouse gas measurements in Antartic ice cores, formed a basis for his successful documentary.\n\n“We are naturally proud of our scientific results,” said Martin Grosjean, head of the university’s Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research.\n\n“Al Gore and this year’s IPCC reports took the results of climate research to a whole new level that made them understandable for more people.”\n\nFighting climate change"
