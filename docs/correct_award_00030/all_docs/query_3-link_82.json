        "text": "This report on Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories is the response to the request from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to complete its work on uncertainty and prepare a report on good practice in inventory management.\n\nThis report provides good practice guidance to assist countries in producing inventories that are neither over nor underestimates so far as can be judged, and in which uncertainties are reduced as far as practicable.\n\nTo this end, it supports the development of inventories that are transparent, documented, consistent over time, complete, comparable, assessed for uncertainties, subject to quality control and quality assurance, and efficient in the use of resources.\n\nThis report does not revise or replace the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, but provides a reference that complements and is consistent with those guidelines.\n\nThis report was accepted by the IPCC Plenary at its 16th session held in Montreal, 1-8 May, 2000.\n\nCORRIGENDUM (GPGAUM-Corr.2001.01, 15 June 2001)"
