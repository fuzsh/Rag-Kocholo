        "text": "Susan Solomon and Dan Albritton (former CSD Director, now retired) will be among the 25 IPCC attendees at the ceremony for the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize on Monday, December 10 in Oslo, Norway. The full Nobel ceremony will be webcast live.\n\nBackground: The 2007 Nobel Peace Prize was bestowed jointly to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and former U.S. Vice President Albert Gore, Jr. for \"their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change.\"\n\nThe IPCC reports have involved thousands of scientists from over 100 countries around the world who have contributed to its reports since the IPCC's formation in 1988. Susan was Cochair of the science working group (Working Group I) of the most recent comprehensive assessment of the IPCC's three working groups. The Fourth Assessment Report was released in stages during 2007; in the case of WGI, the Summary for Policy Makers was released in February and the full report was released in July. A Synthesis Report of all three Working Groups of the IPCC was just completed in November. Dan played leading roles in the WGI Second Assessment Report (1995) and Third Assessment Report (2001). In the TAR, he was a coordinating lead author of the report's Summary for Policy Makers and its Technical Summary, which are highly read summaries of the full report.\n\nSignificance: The Nobel Peace Prize is recognition, at the highest international level, of the contributions of the world's scientific community at the nexus of climate science and world peace."
