The IPCC’s purpose is to “provide governments at all levels with scientific information that they can use to develop climate policies.” [Reference: https://www.ipcc.ch/about/]",

The reports focus on the physical science of climate change, its impacts, and strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change. These assessment reports involve more than 500 lead authors and 2,000 reviewers, and cite over 9,000 published scientific literature sources. Policymakers around the world use the information from the reports to make decisions.\n\nThe IPCC also publishes other assessment reports, such as a special report from 2018 on the impacts of a global temperature rise of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial temperatures, and the actions needed to prevent warming from reaching beyond this level.\n\nIn 2007, the IPCC was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its work in assessing and disseminating knowledge about climate change."
