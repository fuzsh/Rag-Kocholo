        "text": "It's only the second time the world's most prestigious award has been given to an environmentalist, but this is a big one: Former vice president turned activist Al Gore will share the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for their push to raise awareness of global warming.\n\nIn its announcement this morning, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said Gore \"is probably the single individual who has done most to create greater worldwide understanding of the measures that need to be adopted\" to fight climate change—an issue it said should be \"treated with the utmost seriousness.\"\n\nThe IPCC has been doing that for nearly two decades by studying scientific reports from around the world and presenting increasingly broad and definitive evidence of of shifts in the global climate.\n\nIn a statement, Gore spoke of the \"opportunity to lift global consciousness\" as he looks ahead on several fronts. In an interview with Popular Mechanics this summer, for example, Gore predicted that the next wave of cellulosic ethanol technology would change the oil landscape within the next three years. \"I think it's going to be a very exciting alternative for a good bit of imported petroleum,\" he said. \"When the third-generation technology comes in, it will really help us reduce CO2. And we're trying to get that word out.\" —Matt Sullivan"
