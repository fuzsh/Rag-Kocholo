        "text": "Fri 12 October 2007 View all news\n\nAl Gore and the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have been jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their work in raising and disseminating knowledge about man-made climate change. The award came shortly after a UK High Court Judge ruled that Gore's climate change film - An Inconvenient Truth - contains 'nine scientific errors'.\n\nThe BBC reported that the Norwegian Nobel Committee said it wanted to bring into sharper focus the \"increased danger of violent conflicts and wars, within and between states\" posed by climate change. It highlighted a series of scientific reports issued over the last two decades by the IPCC, which comprises more than 2,000 leading climate change scientists and experts.\n\nThe Committee said that the reports had \"created an ever-broader informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming\".\n\nMr Gore was praised as \"probably the single individual who has done most to create greater worldwide understanding of the measures that need to be adopted\", through his lectures, films and books.\n\nPresident Bush, who defeated Mr Gore to the Presidency in 2000, was reported to be \"happy\" at the \"important recognition\" for his rival and for the IPCC, according to a White House spokesman.\n\nIn a separate development, a High Court judge in the UK has ruled that Al Gore's film on climate change, An Inconvenient Truth, can be shown in schools following a court challenge from a school governor which attempted to have the showings in schools stopped.\n\nHowever, Mr Justice Burton criticised some of the claims made by the documentary film. He ruled that the Government could still send the film to schools, as planned, provided it is accompanied by guidance giving the other side of the argument and drawing attention to what he said were 'nine scientific errors'."
