Are there pathways for escaping from the up-escalator of climate change? UC Berkeley Professor Bill Collins examines the key culprits, carbon dioxide and “black carbon” from ordinary diesel combustion. His Berkeley research group has shown for the first time the direct link between carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect. The team has just concluded work directly linking methane to the greenhouse effect as well. But there are now success stories pointing the way to reduce the threat. Governor Jerry Brown in California and other leaders have shown that collaborations between government and climate scientists can reduce the agents that drive global warming. Learn more about the potential impact of lowering our emissions of climate pollutants, and other strategies to help us find cost-effective and equitable climate solutions."
