        "text": "IPCC Scholarship Programme\n\nOn 9 December 2007, the IPCC was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its ‘efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change’. The award of the Nobel Peace Prize recognized the importance of addressing the implications of climate change on stability and human security.\n\nThe IPCC Scholarship Programme was established with the funds received from the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize award to the IPCC. The first funding partner of the Programme was Gro Harlem Brundtland, former Norwegian Prime Minister and UN Special Envoy on Climate Change. Dr Brundtland made her donation from the Tallberg Leadership Award, which she received in June 2009. Scholarship Page"
