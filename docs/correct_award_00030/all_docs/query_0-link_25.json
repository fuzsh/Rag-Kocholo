        "text": "IISD proud contributor to IPCC work\n\nThe International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) congratulates the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Al Gore for receiving the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize. The award was given to the IPCC and Gore \"for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change.\"\n\nIISD is extremely proud to have contributed to the work of the IPCC through the efforts of John Drexhage, Director of Climate Change and Energy, and associates Adil Najam, and Dennis Tirpak. They were among the 2,000 global experts who contributed to the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Working Groups' reports this year.\n\nIn a news release, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said:\n\n\"Through the scientific reports it has issued over the past two decades, the IPCC has created an ever-broader informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming. Thousands of scientists and officials from over one hundred countries have collaborated to achieve greater certainty as to the scale of the warming. Whereas in the 1980s global warming seemed to be merely an interesting hypothesis, the 1990s produced firmer evidence in its support. In the last few years, the connections have become even clearer and the consequences still more apparent.\n\n\"By awarding the Nobel Peace Prize for 2007 to the IPCC and Al Gore, the Norwegian Nobel Committee is seeking to contribute to a sharper focus on the processes and decisions that appear to be necessary to protect the world's future climate, and thereby to reduce the threat to the security of mankind. Action is necessary now, before climate change moves beyond man's control.\""
