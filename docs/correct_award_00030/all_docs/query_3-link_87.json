        "text": "Amsterdam, 10 December 2007 – The Norwegian Nobel Committee has awarded the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), represented by Dr. Rajendra K. Pachauri, and (former US Vice-President) Al Gore with the Nobel Peace Prize for 2007 for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change. Today, 10 December, the laureates will receive the Nobel Peace Prize at the Oslo City Hall in Norway.\n\nDr. Rajendra K. Pachauri, Chairman of the IPCC and Director-General of The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) is also Editor-in-Chief of the journal Recourses, Energy and Development. IOS Press is responsible for the distribution and marketing outside India of this journal and several other TERI publications. We are very proud to work with Dr. Pachauri and hereby extend our warmest congratulations.\n\nThrough the scientific reports it has issued over the past two decades, the IPCC has created an ever-broader informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming. Thousands of scientists and officials from over one hundred countries have collaborated to achieve greater certainty as to the scale of the warming. Whereas in the 1980’s global warming seemed to be merely an interesting hypothesis, the 1990’s produced firmer evidence in its support. In the last few years, the connections have become even clearer and the consequences still more apparent.\n\n###\n\n© 2007 IOS Press. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use prohibited.\n\nAbout The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI)\n\nTERI (Director-General: Rajendra K. Pachauri) was formally established in 1974 with the purpose of tackling and dealing with the immense and acute problems that mankind is likely to be faced with in the years ahead: On account of the gradual depletion of the earth’s finite energy resources which are largely non-renewable, and on account of the existing methods of their use which are polluting. Over the years the Institute has developed a wider interpretation of this core purpose and its application. Consequently, TERI has created an environment that is enabling, dynamic and inspiring for the development of solutions to global problems in the fields of energy, environment and current patterns of development, which are largely unsustainable. Visit www.teriin.org for more information.\n\nAbout the Resources, Energy and Development\n\nThe biannual publication Resources, Energy, and Development (ISSN: 0973-0516, Editor-in-Chief: Dr. Rajendra K. Pachauri) focuses on research and integration of knowledge at the interface of resources and development. It provides a forum for comprehensive investigation, analysis, and review of subjects in the field of energy, environment, and natural resource management that confront decision-makers, planners, consultants, politicians, and researchers. It deals with theoretical and methodological issues and case studies on the interrelationships among development, human activity, and resource use; explores sustainability issues and transitions; and facilitates dialogues between the scientific community and the society at large. Only original articles based on policy research and rigorous analysis are published. Visit www.iospress.nl for more information.\n\nAbout IOS Press"
