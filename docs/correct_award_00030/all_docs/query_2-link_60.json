        "text": "June 5 to 16 – The United Nations (UN) Conference on the Human Environment is held in Stockholm, Sweden. The UN Secretary-General invites Canadian Maurice Strong to lead the conference, which led to the creation of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). Strong would become UNEP’s first Executive Director. Since its creation, Canada has actively engaged with UNEP in many areas including climate change, biodiversity, chemicals and wastes, plastics, and air pollution.\n\nSeptember 15 – The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, an international treaty designed to protect the ozone layer, is adopted in Montreal, Quebec. To date, the Montreal Protocol is the only UN treaty ever to have been ratified by every country on Earth. It is considered one of the most successful multilateral agreements, eliminating the majority of ozone depleting substances and putting the ozone layer on a path to recovery.\n\nJune 27 to 30 – Canada hosts “The Changing Atmosphere: Global Implications for Global Security”, a landmark world conference in Toronto, Ontario. The conference brings together scientists, heads of state and policy makers from around the world to discuss the growing problem of global warming. The conference includes over 300 scientists and policy makers from 46 countries, UN organizations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).\n\nJune 3 to 14 – The UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) (also known as the “Rio Summit”, “Rio Conference”, or “Earth Summit”) is held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Canadian Maurice Strong is called again to lead the conference, leading to the three landmark “Rio Conventions”: the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC); the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD); and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).\n\nMarch 28 to April 7 – The UNFCCC hosts its first ever Conference of the Parties (COP1) in Berlin, Germany. Canada makes a bid to host the UNFCCC Secretariat in Toronto, Ontario, to demonstrate its commitment to the UNFCCC. Countries agree instead to select Bonn, Germany to host the Secretariat.\n\nCanada launches the National Action program on Climate Change (NAPCC), marking the beginning of a national strategy to address climate change science, mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and adapt to climate change. The NAPCC is Canada’s response to the UNFCCC and sets the strategic direction for pursuing Canada’s objective of meeting its commitment to stabilize GHG emissions at 1990 levels by 2000, and providing guidance for actions beyond 2000.\n\nSeptember 19 – The Arctic Council is established in Ottawa, Ontario, following adoption of the Ottawa Declaration. The pre-eminent forum for circumpolar cooperation, the Arctic Council is equally committed to the well-being of Arctic inhabitants and the protection of the Arctic environment. Canada’s Ambassador for Circumpolar Affairs at the time, now Governor General, Mary Simon, was instrumental to the Arctic Council’s creation. This included ensuring Indigenous Peoples can make valuable contributions to the Arctic Council's activities as “Permanent Participants”.\n\nOctober – Canada releases the National Implementation Strategy on Climate Change, and the accompanying First National Climate Change Business Plan (FNBP). The Action Plan 2000 on Climate Change (PDF), released under the FNBP, commits to invest $500 million over five years on specific actions to reduce GHG emissions, with the goal of reducing emissions by 65 megatonnes per year from 2008 to 2012 and taking Canada one third of the way to meeting its Kyoto target.\n\nNovember – Canada releases the Climate Change Plan for Canada, which sets out a three-step approach to achieve Canada’s objective of reducing annual GHG emissions by 240 megatonnes. The Plan identifies action in five broad areas: transportation, housing and commercial/institutional buildings, large industrial emitters, small and medium-sized enterprises, and the international market. Earlier in the year, the government also releases Canada’s National Climate Change Business Plan 2002 (PDF).\n\nNovember 28 to December 9 – Canada hosts UNFCCC COP11 in Montreal, Quebec. With over 10,000 participants, COP11 was the largest intergovernmental climate conference since the Kyoto Protocol’s adoption in 1997. This meeting was supplemented by the first meeting of the Kyoto Protocol, which entered into force on February 16, 2005.\n\nApril 26 – Canada announces the Turning the Corner Action Plan on Climate Change and Air Pollution (PDF). The plan is the cornerstone of the Government's efforts to address climate change and air pollution. The plan provides a framework for regulations and other measures to reduce air emissions from transportation, industrial sectors, consumers and commercial products, and to improve the quality of indoor air.\n\nThe Regulatory Framework for Air Emissions is also announced, requiring GHG and air pollutant reductions by the major emitting sectors: thermal electricity, oil and gas, and certain mining and manufacturing sectors. The targeted sectors account for approximately half of Canada's total combined GHG and air pollutant emissions.\n\nThe IPCC, along with Al Gore, is awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to build up and share greater knowledge about human-caused climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures needed to counteract this change. ECCC officials are recognized for their contributions to the IPCC’s work, and the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nJune – Canada presents two draft documents related to an offset system for a national carbon market. The proposed cap and trade approach aligns with the U.S. congressional proposal and would set an economy-wide price signal based on upstream reduction obligations. The bills do not make it out of the senate, which shifts Canadian policy to a sector-by-sector approach.\n\nDecember 7 to 18 – Denmark hosts UNFCCC COP15 in Copenhagen. Countries finalize what would become the Copenhagen Accord, expressing clear political intent to limit carbon emissions and respond to climate change in the short and long term. Raising climate change policy to the highest political level, close to 115 world leaders attend the event, making it one of the largest gatherings of world leaders ever. Other key outcomes include developed countries' promises to fund actions to reduce GHG emissions and adapt to inevitable climate change effects in developing countries, towards mobilizing long-term finance of US$100 billion a year by 2020 from various sources.\n\nNovember 29 to December 10 – Mexico hosts UNFCCC COP16 in Cancun. Countries use this opportunity to officially adopt major tenets of the Copenhagen Accord, including limiting global warming to 2°C. Over 130 countries agreed to the Copenhagen Accord, including Canada, who committed to reducing GHG emissions to 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. COP16 also sees the establishment of the Green Climate Fund (GCF).\n\nNovember 30 to December 12 – France hosts UNFCCC COP21 in Paris. Over 190 countries sign on to the Paris Agreement, with the goal of holding global average temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and pursuing efforts to limit increase to 1.5°C. A landmark achievement, the Paris Agreement is the first time a legally binding agreement brings all nations together towards common ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects. Canada attended with renewed focus on climate leadership, with a departmental name change to Environment and Climate Change Canada, and played a leading role in negotiations, particularly for the Agreement’s Article 6 on the use of international carbon markets to achieve emission reduction targets.\n\nOctober 5 – Canada ratifies the Paris Agreement, formalizing its first nationally determined contribution (NDC) of achieving an economy-wide target to reduce GHG emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. This helps contribute to meeting the threshold for the Paris Agreement’s early entry into force on November 4, 2016, almost 4 years earlier than expected. Canada also becomes one of the first countries to submit a long-term low emission development strategy (LT-LEDS) under the Agreement.\n\nOctober 15 – In Kigali, Rwanda, countries adopt an amendment to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) under the Montreal Protocol. Canada plays a leadership role in this process and becomes one of the first countries to ratify the “Kigali Amendment”. Thanks in part to Canada’s efforts, enough countries ratify the amendment by November 2017 that it enters into force in January 2019.\n\nUnder Canada’s Presidency, the Group of 7 (G7) environment, oceans and energy Ministers meet on the theme “Working Together on Climate Change, Oceans and Clean Energy”. This is the first time the G7 linked these three issues together, and the first time Canada hosted G7 environment Ministers.\n\nJune 21 – The Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, which legislates the federal carbon pollution pricing system, comes into force. The federal system provides a backstop for provinces or territories that request it or that do not have their own carbon pricing systems that align with minimum national stringency requirements.\n\nApril 22 and 23 – The United States hosts the Leader's Summit on Climate in a hybrid format due to the COVID-19 pandemic, becoming the largest virtual gathering of world leaders. Here, Canada announces its enhanced Paris Agreement emissions reduction target of 40 to 45% below 2005 levels by 2030.\n\nMay to June – Under the United Kingdom’s Presidency, the G7 delivers the most ambitious environmental outcomes in its history. Dubbed the “net-zero G7”, Ministers focus on increasing climate ambition and accelerating the transition to clean energy. All G7 Members come forward with updated NDCs and commitments to net-zero by 2050.\n\nJune – The Canadian Net Zero Emissions Accountability Act receives royal assent. The Act legislates Canada’s commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and provides a durable accountability and transparency framework to deliver on it. Key features of the framework include a transparent process to plan, assess and adjust efforts to achieve national GHG emission reduction targets based on the best scientific information available, at regular intervals; provisions for public participation; and a Net-Zero Advisory Body to provide independent advice.\n\nJuly 12 – Canada submits its enhanced NDC under the Paris Agreement, which commits to achieving economy-wide emissions reductions of 40 to 45% below 2005 levels by 2030. Canada also publishes Canada’s Climate Actions for a Healthy Environment and a Healthy Economy. The report provides an update on actions taken to support clean growth across Canada, with a focus on those since December 2020 and a nod to the efforts these actions build on.\n\nOctober 31 to November 12 – The United Kingdom hosts UNFCCC COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland. A critical year for the environment, COP26 helped drive momentum and global ambition for addressing the climate crisis, and advanced the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement. Canada highlighted its domestic and international leadership in addressing the climate crisis and supporting ambitious global action. This included co-leading, alongside Germany, a process to further build trust that developed countries stand by their commitments and deliver US$100 billion in climate financing through 2025."
