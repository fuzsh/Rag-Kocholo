As for these attempts by the left, I simply say &lsquo;nice try.'&quot;  \n\n\n\nWashington, D.C. - Senator James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, commented on the release today of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Summary for Policymakers in advance of its report, Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation. \n\n\n\n&quot;The discredited United Nations IPCC is back with another global warming report, only this time it faces an increasingly skeptical public,&quot; Senator Inhofe said. &quot;The lack of attention on this latest report is a symptom of the crisis of confidence in the IPCC, which is ongoing.&quot;  \n\n\n\n&quot;For years I warned that the IPCC would lose its credibility entirely and eventually be ignored if it did not make significant reforms.  In 2005, I sent a letter to IPCC Chair Dr. Pachauri that contained several suggestions on how the IPCC could reform its flawed peer-review process.  Yet as Reuters reported, Pachauri refused even to acknowledge my concerns: 'In the one-page letter, [Pachauri] denies the IPCC has an alarmist bias and says &quot;I have a deep commitment to the integrity and objectivity of the IPCC process.&quot; Pachauri's main argument is that the IPCC comprises both scientists and more than 130 governments who approve IPCC reports line by line. That helps ensure fairness, he says.' \n\n\n\n&quot;Of course, in the aftermath of the Climategate scandal, when over one hundred errors in the IPCC science were revealed, I was proven right, so much so that even the mainstream media began to call for reform at the IPCC.   Today, the consequences are clear: as the discredited IPCC releases its latest report, very few people have even noticed. \n\n\n\n&quot;Look for many in the liberal media to use the IPCC report to link weather events of today with global warming, as several have already done, but a closer look reveals this is not exactly the case.  As for these attempts by the left, I simply say 'nice try.'  This effort will fail as miserably as all their previous endeavors to promote fear and scare the public into action. \n\n\n\n&quot;The American people may not care about today's IPCC Summary for Policymakers, but they do care that policy decisions are based on sound science - and the IPCC has clearly shown that science is secondary, even non-essential to their primary goal of pushing a political agenda.   The American people also care about the $300 to $400 billion annual pricetag of EPA's forthcoming greenhouse gas regulations, which are based on the endangerment finding - whose foundation is the flawed IPCC science - and the hundreds of thousands of jobs that would be lost from these destructive policies.&quot; \n\n\n\nCrisis of Confidence in the IPCC \n\n\n\nAugust 31, 2010 Financial Times Time for a change in climate research: &quot;Now it is time to implement fundamental reforms that would reduce the risk of bias and errors appearing in future IPCC assessments, increase transparency and open up the whole field of climate research to the widest possible range of scientific views.&quot; \n\n\n\nJanuary 28, 2010 ABC News Can Climate Forecasts Still Be Trusted? Confidence Melting Away: Doubters Grow in Climate Change Debate: But other climatologists are calling for consequences. They insist that IPCC Chairman and Nobel laureate Rajendra Pachauri is no longer acceptable as head of the panel, particularly because of his personal involvement in the affair. &quot;Pachauri should resign, so as to avert further damage to the IPCC,&quot; says German climatologist Hans von Storch. &quot;He used the argument of the supposed threat to the Himalayan glacier in his personal efforts to raise funds for research.&quot; Storch claims that the Indian-born scientist did not order the retraction of the erroneous prediction until it had generated considerable public pressure. \n\n\n\nFebruary 8, 2010 New York Times Article Skeptics Find Fault With U.N. Climate Panel: U.N. Climate Panel and Chief Face Credibility Siege: &quot;Just over two years ago, Rajendra K. Pachauri seemed destined for a scientist's version of sainthood: A vegetarian economist-engineer who leads the United Nations' climate change panel, he accepted the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the panel, sharing the honor with former Vice President Al Gore. But Dr. Pachauri and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are now under intense scrutiny, facing accusations of scientific sloppiness and potential financial conflicts of interest from climate skeptics, right-leaning politicians and even some mainstream scientists.&quot; \n\n\n\nFebruary 15, 2010 Washington Post Series of missteps by climate scientists threatens climate-change agenda: &quot;But recent revelations about flaws in that seminal report, ranging from typos in key dates to sloppy sourcing, are undermining confidence not only in the panel's work but also in projections about climate change. Scientists who have pointed out problems in the report say the panel's methods and mistakes -- including admitting Saturday that it had overstated how much of the Netherlands was below sea level -- give doubters an opening.&quot; \n\n\n\nFebruary 17, 2010 New York Times Editorial &quot;With Stakes This High&quot;: Given the stakes, the panel cannot allow more missteps and, at the very least, must tighten procedures and make its deliberations more transparent. The panel's chairman, Rajendra K. Pachauri, an Indian engineer, also is under fire for taking consulting fees from business interests. Mr. Pachauri says he does not profit personally and channels the fees to a nonprofit research center he runs in New Delhi. Yet as the person most responsible for the panel's integrity, he cannot afford even the appearance of a conflict of interest. All this follows last November's uproar over leaked e-mail messages that, while they had nothing to do with the panel's reports, portrayed climate scientists as thin-skinned and fully capable of stifling competing views. The controversy over the 2007 report has been stoked by charges of poor sourcing and alarmist forecasts, prominently a prediction - in a 938-page working paper - that the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035. This was clearly an exaggeration, though it was not included in the final report. An overblown warning of crop failures in North Africa made it into the final report. \n\n\n\nJanuary 20, 2010 Seth Borenstein Associated Press UN climate report riddled with errors on glaciers: Five glaring errors were discovered in one paragraph of the world's most authoritative report on global warming, forcing the Nobel Prize-winning panel of climate scientists who wrote it to apologize and promise to be more careful. The errors are in a 2007 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a U.N.-affiliated body. All the mistakes appear in a subsection that suggests glaciers in the Himalayas could melt away by the year 2035 - hundreds of years earlier than the data actually indicates. The year 2350 apparently was transposed as 2035. \n\n\n\nJanuary 21, 2010 Time magazine Himalayan Melting: How a Climate Panel Got It Wrong: &lsquo;Glaciergate' is a &quot;black eye for the IPCC and for the climate-science community as a whole.&quot; \n\n\n\nJanuary 21, 2010 Newsweek, The Economist Off-base camp - A mistaken claim about glaciers raises questions about the UN's climate panel: &quot;This mixture of sloppiness, lack of communication, and high-handedness gives the IPCC's critics a lot to work with.&quot; \n\n\n\n###",
