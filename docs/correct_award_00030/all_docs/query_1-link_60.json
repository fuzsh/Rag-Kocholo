        "text": "9 May 2024\n\nGreta Thunberg is one of the world's best-known climate change campaigners.\n\nShe has been credited with raising public awareness, especially amongst young people\n\nWho is Greta Thunberg and how did she become a climate activist?\n\nMs Thunberg was born in the Swedish capital Stockholm in 2003. Her mother Malena Ernman is an opera singer, and her father Svante Thunberg is an actor.\n\nShe first learned about climate change when she was eight.\n\nWhen she was 11 or 12, she started suffering from depression, according to her father, Svante.\n\n\"She stopped talking... she stopped going to school,\" he said.\n\nAround the same time she was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism.\n\nIn summer 2018, aged 15, Ms Thunberg held the first \"School Strike for Climate\" outside the Swedish parliament.\n\nThe protest was widely covered, and hundreds of thousands of young people across the world joined her Fridays For Future strikes.\n\nMr Thunberg says his daughter became \"much happier\" after she started campaigning.\n\nShe has described her autism diagnosis as a \"superpower\" which helped motivate her protests.\n\n\"Being different is a gift,\" she told the BBC. \"If I would've been like everyone else, I wouldn't have started this school strike.\"\n\nBetween 2019 and 2020, she took a year out of school to concentrate on activism, and became famous for her impassioned speeches to world leaders.\n\nShe left school in summer 2023, and ended her school climate strikes.\n\nMs Thunberg has been arrested several times for her participation in environmental protests around the world and fined by the Swedish courts.\n\nWhat have been her most famous speeches?\n\nIn April 2019, aged 16, Ms Thunberg told members of the European Parliament: \"Our house is falling apart and our leaders need to start acting accordingly, because at the moment they are not.\"\n\nFive months later, she sailed by yacht across the Atlantic to address a UN climate action summit in New York.\n\n\"I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean,\" she told delegates. \"Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\"\n\nSpeaking at a youth protest in Glasgow in 2021, after the city hosted the COP26 climate change summit, she said: \"[World leaders have held] 26 COPs. They have had decades of blah, blah, blah - and where has that got us?\"\n\nWhat awards has Greta Thunberg won?\n\nMs Thunberg has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize every year between 2019 and 2023.\n\nIn 2019, she became the youngest-ever Time Person of the Year.\n\nAlso in 2019, she won the Right Livelihood Award (known as the Alternative Nobel Prize) and Amnesty International's Ambassador of Conscience Award, and was listed by Forbes as one of the world's 100 most powerful women.\n\nIn 2022, she brought out The Climate Book, which contains essays from 100 scientists, writers and activists about how to combat the climate crisis.\n\nWhat have Greta Thunberg's critics said about her?\n\nAt the start of 2023, controversial media personality Andrew Tate baited Ms Thunberg on X, formerly Twitter, by listing his 33 cars and offering to send her details of their \"enormous emissions\".\n\nShe responded with a sarcastic tweet which was liked by several million people and shared widely.\n\nShe was also mocked on Twitter by former US President Donald Trump when she won the Time magazine award. He said: \"Greta must work on her Anger Management problem... Chill Greta, Chill!\"."
