        "text": "\"The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided that the Nobel Peace Prize for 2007 is to be shared, in two equal parts, between the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Albert Arnold (Al) Gore Jr. for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change.\"\n\nNobel Peace Prize Committee\n\n\"I have been stunned in a pleasant way with the news of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for the IPCC. This makes each of you a Nobel Laureate and it is my privilege to acknowledge this honour on your behalf...\"\n\nLetter to IPCC Convening Lead Authors, from Rajendra Pachauri, IPCC Chairman\n\nThe IPCC was created in 1988 to response to growing concern about the risk of anthropogenic climate change. The General Assembly of the United Nations asked the two UN bodies most engaged in the issue, the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, to set up this Panel. The role of the IPCC is to assess on a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation.\n\nEvan Mills has contributed to the work of IPCC since the late 1990s, co-authoring eight chapters and reports as a member of the large body of scientists from around the world who collectively share in the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. He has participated in Working Group II (climate change impacts and adaptation), with emphasis on the implications for the world's insurance industry and financial services sector. He has also participated in Working Group III (climate change mitigation), with emphasis on the role of energy efficiency in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. He contributed to the Third Assessment Report (2001) and the Fourth Assessment Report (2007).\n\nPresentation Speech\n\nIPCC Nobel Lecture\n\nMain Nobel web page [PDF]\n\nOfficial Certificate from IPCC to Authors [PDF]\n\nInitial comments by IPCC Chairman [PDF]\n\nIPCC News Release [PDF]\n\nLetter from IPCC Chairman to Contributing Lead Authors [PDF]\n\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Nobel Laureates [PDF • Details - PDF]\n\nNews story in SCIENCE with comments from Bert Bolin, Robert Watson, and R.K.
