This essay explores three possible explanations for the division among evangelicals with respect to climate change: (1) theological differences, (2) views of how science affects public policy, and (3) the role of legal and political institutions. I hope to provide insight into the contemporary relationship between religious faith and public policy. My undertaking here is descriptive, not normative. But I am hopeful that a better understanding of the contrasting views within the evangelical community will lead to more thoughtful responses to climate change, to a more constructive engagement between evangelicals and environmental activists, and to a deeper understanding of the relationship between religious teachings and environmental protection. climate change, global warming, evangelicals, science, religion, Christianity, jurisprudence, theology, environmental ethics, pollution"
