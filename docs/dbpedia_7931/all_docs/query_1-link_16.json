        "text": "the knockabout stuff is balanced by sly literary allusions for those who want them and an extravagant love story for those who want that (it's actually more rom than com) xxx More poisonous betrayal, uncompromising discussion and bad sex from writer-director Neil LaBute xxx Hartley's usual cool, ironic humour slips a bit in this tale and the wit isn't as profuse as we've come to expect.\n\nBulworth (1998, 18, Fox Path√©, Rental) Directed and co-scripted by Warren Beatty, this sharp Capra-esque comedy stars Beatty as a burnt-out, sold-out liberal senator who, after arranging his own murder (for insurance purposes), suddenly develops a form of political Tourette syndrome and starts telling the truth. With hilarious though dangerous results, he moves into the Los Angeles black community and starts rapping his criticisms and policies. A funny, angry movie about 1990s dishonesty with strong performances from, among others, Halle Berry as the senator's mysterious new girlfriend and Olivier Platt as his desperate manager."
