        "text": "Arun Kakar\n\nInstallation view of Bernier / Eliades’s booth at Art Basel in Basel, 2023. Courtesy of Art Basel.\n\nThe 2023 edition of Art Basel in Basel concluded on Sunday, wrapping up a seven-day stint at the Messe Basel convention center, which hosted 284 galleries from 36 countries and territories. Some 82,000 visitors attended the fair—over 10,000 more than the number reported last year—cementing its reputation as the premier event of the international art world.\n\n“Seeing so many familiar faces and making new connections at the fair this week has proven that Art Basel still holds the throne,” said Rachel Lehmann, co-founder of Lehmann Maupin.\n\nThis year’s edition saw a number of standout displays from exhibitors, many of which showcased the full range of their inventories and represented artists. Works on view at several booths were regularly rotated throughout the week and were met with consistently strong foot traffic. “This was one of the busiest fairs I’ve seen for years,” remarked Andrew Fabricant, chief operating officer at Gagosian.\n\nLatifa Echakhch, installation view of the Messeplatz at Art Basel in Basel, 2023. Courtesy of Art Basel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond the core fair itself, Art Basel’s Unlimited sector presented 76 large-scale installations and performances; plus, the Parcours sector featured 24 site-specific installations across the city, including the interactive installation by Latifa Echakhch on the Messeplatz. Around the corner, Liste Art Fair Basel provided visitors with a taste of emerging art from an impressive slate of cutting-edge galleries.\n\nWhile this year’s Art Basel took place against the backdrop of a cautious art market and an uneasy economic picture, the mood at the fair was mostly positive. Sales volume was consistently high, and even though many remarked that there were fewer Americans than in years past, the return of many Asian collectors and institutions came as more than a consolation. As evidenced by the raft of sales listed below, strong interest from both collectors and institutions was evident across the board.\n\nHere, we share a rundown of what sold at Art Basel in Basel 2023.\n\nTop sales\n\nLouise Bourgeois, installation view in Hauser & Wirth’s booth at Art Basel in Basel, 2023.
