        "text": "Taking inspiration from Steven Soderbergh, I give you the list of movies and miniseries that I watched from beginning to end last year. Rather than frame my inventory of 169 titles within a calendar year, I decided to begin last year on March 3, 2014, the day after the 86th Academy Awards ceremony aired. Since I don’t plan on updating this list after today, these are all the movies and miniseries I watched through today, January 14, 2015. I don’t keep a log of TV shows and books that I read, although I do write down in a personal diary what I watch/read whenever I do. Titles in bold are favorites, and those crossed out are the absolute worst.\n\nON TELEVISION & CABLE My sister thinks I watch too much TV, to the detriment of my professional productivity. I am happy to see that this short list proves that pretty much the only stuff I watch from beginning to end on TV and cable are miniseries (excepting TV shows, of course). By the way, 47 Ronin is not as advertised. If, like me, you initially shirked the Keanu Reeves picture because you thought it would be a martial arts movie, I am happy to tell you that it is a romantic historical epic with a dash of the supernatural thrown in. Entertaining if not always convincing.\n\nCeleste and Jesse Forever (Lee Toland Krieger, 2012)\n\nTo Rome With Love (Woody Allen, 2012)\n\nDeath Comes to Pemberley (Daniel Percival, 2013) miniseries\n\nOlive Kitteridge (Lisa Cholodenko, 2014) miniseries\n\nThe Missing (Tom Shankland, 2014) miniseries\n\n47 Ronin (Carl Rinsch, 2013)\n\nON DEMAND (that is, through an online streaming service that either releases a film before or during its theatrical run) As you can see, watching movies on demand isn’t really my bag. I much prefer to go to the theater, but sometimes it’s necessary to rent from Amazon or M-Go, as was the case with Alan Partridge. Did it ever play a theater near me?\n\nVeronica Mars (Rob Thomas, 2014)\n\nAlan Partridge: Alpha Papa (Declan Lowney, 2013)\n\nLife Itself (Steve James, 2014)\n\nIn Secret (Charlie Stratton, 2013)\n\nThe One I Love (Charlie McDowell, 2014)\n\nMOVIES I’D SEEN BEFORE I’m as surprised as you: I don’t revisit favorite films much anymore. For the record, neither Little Man Tate nor Go is an all-time favorite.\n\nLittle Man Tate (Jodie Foster, 1991)\n\nI Love You, Alice B. Toklas (Hy Averback, 1968)\n\nJurassic Park (Steven Spielberg, 1993) I don’t know how many times I’ve seen this\n\nVirtual Sexuality (Nick Hurran, 1999)\n\nGo (Doug Liman, 1999)\n\nFROM THE LIBRARY Well, this isn’t surprising. My town’s library reopened about a year ago after staying closed for renovations for something like three years. I go there all the time, and about a month ago, I rented 15 movies at once and managed to see them all within a week. Dedication.\n\nAnother quick note: If I could label one film the most overrated from all 168 that I saw, it would be Locke. No, I’m sorry. It did not reinvent the cinematographic. Eighty-five minutes of Tom Hardy’s ridiculous Welsh accent is stretching my patience.\n\nAmour (Michael Haneke, 2012)\n\nAll is Lost (J.C. Chandor, 2013)\n\nHysteria (Tanya Wexler, 2011)\n\nThe Hedgehog (Mona Achache, 2009)\n\nThe Monuments Men (George Clooney, 2014)\n\nEasy Money (Daniel Espinosa, 2010)\n\nThe Impossible (J.A.

I wouldn’t have seen everything that I’d wanted to without it. Quick notes: Having loved Animal Kingdom, David Michod’s follow-up, The Rover, left a lot to be desired. Disappointing. Speaking of disappointment, Chef may have made my mouth water, but there was too little character development and narrative plausibility for me to become emotionally invested in the father-son road trip movie. Magic in the Moonlight is minor Woody Allen, OK, but it’s not as bad as your sister made it out to be.\n\nDallas Buyers Club (Jean-Marc Vallee, 2013)\n\nLabor Day (Jason Reitman, 2013)\n\nVampire Academy (Mark Waters, 2014)\n\nThe Secret Life of Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller, 2013)\n\nAugust: Osage County (John Wells, 2013)\n\nSaving Mr. Banks (John Lee Hancock, 2013)\n\nWinter’s Tale (Akiva Goldsman, 2014)\n\nThe LEGO Movie (Phil Lord & Christopher Miller, 2014)\n\nNoah (Darren Aronofsky, 2014)\n\nAbout Time (Richard Curtis, 2013)\n\nUnder the Skin (Jonathan Glazer, 2013)\n\nOnly Lovers Left Alive (Jim Jarmusch, 2013)\n\nThe Other Woman (Nick Cassavetes, 2014)\n\nThey Came Together (David Wain, 2014)\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier (Anthony & Joe Russo, 2014)\n\nBelle (Amma Asante, 2013)\n\nThe Rover (David Michod, 2014)\n\nHateship Loveship (Liza Johnson, 2013)\n\nObvious Child (Gillian Robespierre, 2014)\n\nMillion Dollar Arm (Craig Gillespie, 2014)\n\nGodzilla (Gareth Edwards, 2014)\n\nNeighbors (Nicholas Stoller, 2014)\n\nChef (Jon Favreau, 2014)\n\nBegin Again (John Carney, 2013)\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon 2 (Dean DeBlois, 2014)\n\nMagic in the Moonlight (Woody Allen, 2014)\n\nPride (Matthew Warchus, 2014)\n\nTURNER CLASSIC MOVIES My DVR is almost full of recordings from TCM, my favorite channel. These are the ones that I have seen and deleted. Exercising film appreciation is a daunting task.\n\nBorn Yesterday (George Cukor, 1950)\n\nTo Paris With Love (Robert Hamer, 1955)\n\nTim (Michael Pate, 1979)\n\nThe Doctor and the Devils (Freddie Francis, 1985)\n\nLonely Hearts (Paul Cox, 1982)\n\nBadlands (Terrence Malick, 1973)\n\nStarstruck (Gillian Armstrong, 1982)\n\nFriendly Persuasion (William Wyler, 1956)\n\nLibel (Anthony Asquith, 1959)\n\nTwo English Girls (Francois Truffaut, 1971)\n\nThe Way We Were (Sydney Pollack, 1973)\n\nThe Age of Innocence (Martin Scorsese, 1993)\n\nFrom Here to Eternity (Fred Zinnemann, 1953)\n\nDark Victory (Edmund Goulding, 1939)\n\nGeorgy Girl (Silvio Narizzano, 1966)\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey (Stanley Kubrick, 1968)\n\nWoman of the Year (George Stevens, 1942)\n\nKind Hearts and Coronets (Robert Hamer, 1949)\n\nThe Magic Box (John Boulting, 1951)\n\nThe Grass Is Greener (Stanley Donen, 1960)\n\nLove Affair (Leo McCarey, 1939)\n\nThe Black Stallion (Carroll Ballard, 1979)\n\nAn Affair to Remember (Leo McCarey, 1957)\n\nFatso (Anne Bancroft, 1980)\n\nIN THE THEATER What can I say? Ever since I left New York in late 2011, it’s been a struggle to get to the movie theater. At least I’ve seen more Oscar bait movies in the theater this year than in years past.\n\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel (Wes Anderson, 2014)\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past (Bryan Singer, 2014)\n\nWords and Pictures (Fred Schepisi, 2013)\n\n22 Jump Street (Phil Lord & Christopher Miller, 2014)\n\nThe Fault in Our Stars (Josh Boone, 2014)\n\nJersey Boys (Clint Eastwood, 2014)\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes (Matt Reeves, 2014)\n\nBoyhood (Richard Linklater, 2014)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy (James Gunn, 2014)\n\nThe Hundred-Foot Journey (Lasse Hallstrom, 2014)\n\nThe Trip to Italy (Michael Winterbottom, 2014)\n\nThe Skeleton Twins (Craig Johnson, 2014)\n\nGone Girl (David Fincher, 2014)\n\nFury (David Ayer, 2014)\n\nDear White People (Justin Simien, 2014)\n\nBirdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, 2014)\n\nInterstellar (Christopher Nolan, 2014)\n\nThe Theory of Everything (James Marsh, 2014)\n\nFoxcatcher (Bennett Miller, 2014)\n\nTop Five (Chris Rock, 2014)\n\nThe Imitation Game (Morten Tyldum, 2014)\n\nSelma (Ava DuVernay, 2014)\n\nInherent Vice (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2014)\n\nNETFLIX I can’t believe I see so little on Netflix. I really can’t. Logging into my sister’s account, scrolling through her queue (or list, whatever they call it now) of 500+ titles, is so completely overwhelming. That, and I have a voice in my head that tells me that rather than select from Netflix, I really ought to work towards cleaning out my DVR.\n\nBeauty is Embarrassing (Neil Berkeley, 2012)\n\nShort Term 12 (Destin Cretton, 2013)\n\nFilth (Jon S. Baird, 2013)\n\nGoodbye, First Love (Mia Hansen-Love, 2011)\n\nBreathe In (Drake Doremus, 2013)\n\nAge of Uprising: The Legend of Michael Kohlhaas (Arnaud des Pallieres, 2013)\n\nChinese Puzzle (Cedric Klapisch, 2013)\n\nLos Angeles Plays Itself (Thom Andersen, 2003)\n\nFrank (Lenny Abrahamson, 2014)\n\nUNCLASSIFIABLE I hope it’s obvious how I saw these, if I didn’t see these in the theater or on demand or any other method listed here.\n\nMaleficent (Robert Stromberg, 2014)\n\nTranscendence (Wally Pfister, 2014)\n\nEdge of Tomorrow (Doug Liman, 2014)\n\nThe Giver (Phillip Noyce, 2014)\n\nPredestination (Michael & Peter Spierig, 2014)"
