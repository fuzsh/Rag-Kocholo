        "text": "Being Jewish on the American screen has always meant suffering indignities, whether historical, as in The Life of Emile Zola, or hysterical, as when Sam Goldwyn (né Goldfish) forced Danny Kaye (né Kaminsky) to bleach his hair blond because, \"Let’s face it, Jews are funny looking.\" Tough as it’s been to be openly Jewish, it’s always been worse to be Orthodox. By the end of The Jazz Singer, Al Jolson gets to conquer the stage (and his Yiddishe mama), but his stern cantor father who ordered him out of the house conveniently drops dead — assimilate, you win; don’t, you die. Orthodox Jews have rarely made it onto the screen since then, and when they have, it’s either to embody…\n\nBoaz Yakin’s romantic drama with Renée Zellweger as a New York housewife who struggles for independence within the strict Hasidic community.\n\nThe story concerns Sonia (Renée Zellweger), a married Hasidic woman in Brooklyn, New York, whose husband, Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald), is careless.

Renee Zellweger (JERRY MAGUIRE) plays a straight, sexually frustrated Hasidic housewife, who, in the first of two howl-worthy moments, attempts to plant a kiss on her sister-in-law when a neck massage starts gettin' good. She's sent to the Rabbi's office, where he gets a wicked woody while listening to her story and dies of a heart attack the next day, after makin' the moves on the Mrs. I nearly threw my clipboard into the air, but didn't.
