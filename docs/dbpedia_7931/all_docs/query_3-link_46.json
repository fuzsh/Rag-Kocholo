        "text": "The rare versatility and down-to-earth appeal of Renee Zellweger earned the actress Oscar and Golden Globe Awards for her comedy, musical and dramatic work, as well made her one of the highest paid screen actresses in Hollywood. Zellweger was a virtual unknown when director Cameron Crowe cast her opposite box office megastar Tom Cruise in \"Jerry Maguire,\" (1996) where she made cinematic history with the line, \"You had me at hello.\" She went on to define the chick lit generation with her title role in \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" (2001) before intense, impressive turns in \"Chicago\" (2002) and \"Cold Mountain\" (2004) proved that she was as capable of drama as the romantic comedies that started her career. Off-screen, Texas-bred Zellweger was known for her bouts of \"imposter syndrome\" and seemingly endless disbelief over her movie star status, as well as being one of the most genuinely nice, down-to-earth stars in the business."
