        "text": "Carnegie Hall has announced its 2024-25 season, which includes a residency by composer Gabriela Ortiz, Perspectives series curated by Lang Lang, Cécile McLorin Salvant, Mitsuko Uchida, and Maxim Vengerov, and numerous appearances by Broadway stars including Bernadette Peters, Adrienne Warren, Jennifer Simard, and Christopher Sieber.\n\nThe season kicks off October 8 with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Gustavo Dudamel, performing Ginastera's Estancia with baritone Gustavo Castillo, and Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 with Lang Lang. This concert is the first of Lang Lang's two-season Perspectives series, which will also include a dual recital with soprano Angel Blue March 8, and a solo recital March 12. Violinist Maxim Vengerov, pianist Mitsuko Uchida, and jazz vocalist Cécile McLorin Salvant will also curate Perspectives series this season.\n\nBernadette Peters will return to Carnegie Hall for the first time in nearly 30 years October 28. The concert evening will feature a program to be announced.\n\nThe two-time Tony winner is not the only Broadway star who will appear at Carnegie Hall this season. The New York Pops will give their usual season at the venue featuring an array of Broadway names, including Adrienne Warren, Jessica Vosk, and Max von Essen. Additionally, Jinkx Monsoon, who made her Broadway debut in Chicago last year, will make her Carnegie Hall debut February 14, 2025, and Jennifer Simard and Christopher Sieber will present a Zankel Hall concert performance of the Off-Broadway musical Pete ‘n' Keely just three days later.\n\nComposer Gabriela Ortiz will hold the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer’s Chair for the 2024-25 season. The season will include the world premieres of two new works by Ortiz, one, for string quartet, performed by the Attacca Quartet, and one, for vocal ensemble, performed by Roomful of Teeth. Three other works by Ortiz will receive their New York premiere, including a work for cello and orchestra, performed by cellist Alisa Weilerstein and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which will be the first concert of the season's festival Nuestros sonidos: Celebrating Latin Culture in the US. This festival will include sixteen concerts throughout the season featuring a wide range of musical styles.\n\nCzech music will also feature prominently in the season, as Carnegie Hall celebrates the 2024 Year of Czech Music with six concerts in November and December featuring the works of Dvořák, Smetana, Janáček, and more. Three of these concerts will be given by the Czech Philharmonic, returning to Carnegie Hall for the first time since 2018.\n\nThe Orchestra of St. Luke's, a regular at Carnegie Hall for forty 40, celebrates its 50th anniversary next season with four concerts at the venue, beginning in October, when conductor Louis Langrée will make his Carnegie Hall debut, leading Valerie Coleman’s Fanfare for Uncommon Times, Haydn’s Cello Concerto No. 2 with Sterling Elliott, and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 7. In January, Raphaël Pichon will make his Carnegie Hall debut leading Mein Traum, a piece devised from lieder and operatic excerpts by Schubert, combined with arias by Brahms, Schumann, Weber, sung by soprano Ying Fang and baritone Christian Gerhaher. Finally, OSL Principal Conductor Bernard Labadie will round out his final season with the orchestra with concerts February 13 and April 10.\n\nAdditional season highlights include two concerts with Yo-Yo Ma, three concerts with the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin (including a performance of Mahler's Symphony No. 3 with mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato), Gabriella Reyes and Angel Blue making their Carnegie Hall recital debuts, and additional recitals by Lisette Oropesa, Ryan Speedo Green, Emanuel Ax, and more."
