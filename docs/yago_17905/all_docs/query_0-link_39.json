        "text": "Czarist Russia\n\nThe last century of czarism, from the Napoleonic invasion of 1812 (the \"Patriotic War\") to the October Revolution of 1905, was troubled by continuous unrest and rebellion: in 1825 the Decabrist uprisings, in the 1870s the sabotage and attacks of the Nihilists, in the 1880s the strikes fomented by the Social Democratic Party, and then the fateful war against Japan of 1904-05 (the first time that a European power lost a war to an Asian nation) and the revolution of 1905 (the massacre of unarmed protesters in January, the the mutiny of the battleship PotÃ«mkin in June, the general strike of October) that forced czar Nikolay II to liberalize political parties and trade unions.\n\nWhile nothing could match the incredible literary flourishing of the 19th century, the era of czars Nikolay I (1825 - 1855), the one who embarked in the doomed Crimean War against the Western powers, Alexander II (1855 - 1881), the one who abolished serfdom in 1861 and was assassinated by an anarchic, and Alexander III (1881 - 1894), the era that yielded Aleksandr Pushkin's poem \"Evgeny Onegin/ Eugene Onegin\" (1831), Aleksandr Ostrovsky's play \"Groza/ The Storm\" (1860), and some of the greatest novels in any language, from Nikolai Gogol's \"Mertvye Dushi/ Dead Souls\" (1842) to Ivan Goncharov's \"Oblomov\" (1859) and to Mikhail Lermontov's \"Geroi Nashego Vremeni/ A Hero of Our Time\" (1840), from Fyodor Dostoevsky's four masterpieces (\"Prestuplenie i Nakazanie/ Crime and Punishment\", 1866; \"The Idiot\", 1869; \"Besy/ The Possessed\", 1873; \"Bratia Karamazovy/ The Brothers Karamazov\", 1880) to Lev Tolstoy's two masterpieces (\"Voina i Mir/ War and Peace\", 1869; \"Anna Karenina\", 1877), the turbulent era of czar Nikolay II (1894 - 1917) opened with Anton Chekhov's theatrical masterpieces (\"Chaika/ The Seagull\", 1896; \"Dyadya Vanya/ Uncle Vanya\", 1899; \"Tri Sestry/ Three Sisters\", 1901; \"Vishnevyi Sad/ The Cherry Orchard\", 1904) and Maxim Gorky's early novels and plays, such as \"Na dne/ The Lower Depths\" (1903). In fact, poetry thrived more than ever, thanks mainly to the symbolist movement started by Dmitry Merezhkovsky's 1992 manifesto \"O Prichinakh Upadka Io Novykh Tecenijakh Sovremennoj Russkoj/ The Causes of the Decline of the Contemporary Russian Literature\", a movement that included Konstantin Balmont, Valery Bryusov, the erotic Mirra Lokhvitskaya, and the androgynous Zinaida Gippius, peaking with Alexander Blok. Symbolism spilled into fiction yielding novels such as Dmitry Merezhkovsky's trilogy \"Hristos i Antihrist/ Christ and Antichrist\" (1895-1905), Aleksei Remizov's \"Prud/ Pond\" (1903), and Fyodor Sologub's \"Melkii Bes/ The Petty Demon\" (1905).\n\nThe history of Russia had been traditionally shaped by Russia's ancient titled nobility. During the 19th century a new social class emerged that implicitly aimed at taking over that role: the \"intelligentsia\". Pyotr Chaadayev, raised in Moscow by a prince who was a leading promoter of the Russian Enlightenment, wrote between 1827 and 1831 eight \"Lettres Philosophiques/ Philosophical Letters\" in French meant for fellow Russian intellectuals in which he accused Russian culture as lagging far behind Western culture. That's despite the fact that a major talent had just emerged, Alexander Pushkin, the scion of an old noble family, who was producing plays like \"Boris Godunov\" (1831), tales like \"Pikovaia Dama/ The Queen of Spades\" (1834), and poems like \"Evgeny Onegin/ Eugene Onegin\" (1831) and \"Mednyi Vsadnik/ The Bronze Horseman\" (1833). Pushkin also founded the literary magazine Sovremennik (The Contemporary) in 1836. If Mikhail Lermontov, the author of \"Geroi Nashego Vremeni/ A Hero of Our Time\" (1840), was still from a noble family, Nikolai Gogol, the author of \"Mertvye Dushi/ Dead Souls/ Anime Morte\" (1842), was the son of a Ukrainian Cossack. These early classics of Russian literature surpassed the Bible in terms of influence exerted on the intellectuals.\n\nFor a while the \"intelligentsia\" aimed at being a \"westernized\" one and sometimes ended up moving to the West. Alexander Herzen, the wealthy illegitimate son of an aristocrat, had to flee Russia after publishing \"Kto Vinovat?/ Who is to Blame?\" (1846), and became Russia's first major political exile to the West. In 1857 he launched in London the magazine Kolokol (The Bell), which became the organ of the emigrant Russian intellectuals, the only medium to publish pamphlets against the czarist regime. If these early intellectuals had all been members of the wealthy aristocracy, a new breed of intellectuals arose in the 1850s from different social and economic ranks, the \"raznochintsy\", with family ties to clergy, teachers, merchants, etc.\n\nSovremennik, owned by the poet Nikolai Nekrasov after 1847, became the voice of the westernized intellectuals who sympathyzed with the 1848 revolutions that rocked many European countries. Nekrasov's first editor-in-chief, Aleksandr Nikitenko, was a freed Ukrainian serf. Vissarion Belinsky, its first prominent literary critic, was the son of a provincial doctor. Belinsky was succeeded by Nikolai Chernyshevsky in 1853 and by Nikolai Dobrolyubov in 1856, both children of priests, and both educated in religious schools. This generation established literary criticism as the main form of political expression: by choosing which books to review or translate, and by commenting on their ideas, they indirectly attacked the regime.\n\nIvan Goncharov, the novelist of \"Oblomov\" (1859), was the son of a wealthy merchant, and Aleksandr Ostrovsky, the playwright of \"Groza/ The Storm\" (1860), was the son of a government clerk.\n\nThe moral and ideological gulf between the intelligentsia and the establishment widened. This is when the term \"intelligentsia\" came in use, especially after Ivan Turgenev (son of a noble) painted the portrait of a \"nihilist\" in the novel \"Otcy i Deti/ Fathers and Sons\" (1862). Dmitri Pisarev (son of an aristocrat), Russia's most influential literary critic between 1862 and 1866 when he contributed to Nekrasov's new magazine Russkoye Slovo (The Russian Word), was the apostle of nihilism, the philosophy attacked by Fyodor Dostoevsky in \"Prestuplenie i Nakazanie/ Crime and Punishment\" (1866).\n\nThat generation was decimated in the 1860s: Dobrolyubov died in 1861, Chernyshevsky was imprisoned in 1862 and exiled in 1872, Pisarev was imprisoned in 1862 (aged 22) and he drowned in 1868 (aged 28). Chernyshevsky wrote his political novel \"Chto Delat?/ What is to Be Done\" (1863) while jailed in a Saint Petersburg fortress.\n\nThe intelligentsia often resembled a monastic order, with its own rituals and even dress codes, and its devotion to reading and talking. Its ideology became a utopian vision of universal equality and justice. But mostly the intelligentsia was united in despising the czarist regime.\n\nHowever, the intelligentsia was not all of the westernizing kind. The Slavophiles emerged during the 1840s. They claimed that Russia actually enjoyed cultural superiority over Western Europe precisely because of its unique situation and unique mindset. Aleksei Khomiakov, son of an aristocrat, was the apostle of \"sobornost\" (\"togetherness\"): Russian society was founded in cooperation, not in competition. The founders of the Slavophile movement, like Khomiakov, Ivan Kireevsky (also the son of an aristocrat) and Konstantin Aksakov (son of a writer) wrote very little. The manifesto of the movement came much later, with Konstantin Leontiev's \"The East, Russia, and Slavdom\" (1886). Dostoyevsky tried to reconcile Westernizers and Slavophiles in his \"Pushkin speech\" of 1880.\n\nDostoevsky was the son of a doctor and Anton Chekhov was the grandson of a serf. Tolstoy, the son of a count and a princess, was the last major representative of the liberal aristocracy.\n\nA parallel story has to do with students. At the beginning of the 19th century, Russia had no universal public education, which meant that the educated elite was largely isolated from the majority of Russian society. For example, the goal of Alexander Shishkov, minister of Public Instruction from 1824 to 1828, was to promote the triad of autocracy, orthodoxy and patriotism among the upper class in order to enforce social cohesion. Students (mostly from the middle ranks of society, like children of civil servants, merchants, priests and artisans) were allowed to be degenerate but not to get involved in politics. This social contract worked until the death of czar Nikolay I in 1855. At the same time, the end of serfdom in 1861 caused peasants to long for literacy. Sympathy for the illiterate peasant class spread among enlightened aristocrats like Lev Tolstoy (who between 1859 and 1862 established an experimental school for peasant children at his estate Yasnaya Polyana). In the following decades the students of universities became increasingly organized and networked, de facto creating a distinct social class, the \"studenchestvo\". The first student journal debuted in Saint Petersburg in 1856. Most students represented the first generation of their family receiving a higher education. Many students came from provincial towns and bonded with other young people from the same regions, thus forming \"zemliachestva\" (clubs of students from the same region). Student meetings (\"skhodka\") often mirrored the meetings of peasant communes because those were their families' origins. Students competed to live near the university so that student neighborhoods emerged (like Vasilevskii Island in Saint Petersburg and the Nikitskii-Tver Boulevard of Moscow). The student movement was tolerated by the czarist regime until 1866, when the 25-year-old Dmitry Karakozov tried to assassinate the czar. Then the regime started cracking down on student activities, but this had the opposite effect of creating a more militant student class. Already in 1887 and 1890 there were nationwide outbreaks of student demonstrations, which shows an impressive ability to organize not only within a city but also over the long distances that separated the universities of Moscow, Kiev, Warsaw and Saint Petersburg. The famine of 1891 exacerbated the hostility towards the regime. A congress of students was organized in 1894 in Moscow and was attended by delegates coming from as far as Odessa. The final document by Victor Chernov called students \"revolutionary intelligentsia and a natural vanguard of the popular movement\". The student mood was further inflamed in 1897 when the 27-year-old Ukrainian student Mariia Vetrova, accused of anti-government propaganda, set herself on fire in a prison of Saint Petersburg. The student movement culminated with the nationwide student strike of 1899 that started in Saint Petersburg and which was not political in nature but simply a protest against police brutality (ironically the students never protested when police beat up peasants but they did rise up when police dared to beat up some students). The working class and the peasantry were still largely excluded from universities.\n\nBefore the turn of the century, the Russian intelligentsia of Saint Petersburg had plenty of magazines to gather around: the cultural magazine Russkaya Mysl (Russian Thought), founded in 1880 by Vukol Lavrov, the successor to the glorious Otechestvennyua Zapiski closed in 1884 by the czarist authorities; the literary magazine Severny Vestnik, founded in 1885 by Anna Yevreinova; the art magazine Mir Iskusstva, founded in 1899 by Sergei Diaghilev (the future founder in exile of the Ballets Russes); etc. They assembled in private homes like the home of symbolist poet Vyacheslav Ivanov and his wife Lidia, who hosted salons between 1905 and 1907.\n\nThe symbolist movement intersected with politics in multiple ways. For example, the first Bolshevik journal published in Russia itself, Novaia Zhizn, financed by Maxim Gorky in 1905, was initially run by the symbolist philosopher Nikolai Minsky. In 1904 the symbolist magazine Vesy devoted quite a few pages to Japanese culture, just when the czar was embarking on a war against Japan.\n\nAt the same time, the symbolist movement mixed with a movement of \"novoe religioznoe soznanie\" (new religious consciousness). The rebellion against organized religion had started with the two giants of Russian literature: Dostoevsky, whose Grand Inquisitor (in the novel \"Bratia Karamazovy\") had mocked the Christian Church, and Lev Tolstoy, who was even excommunicated by the Orthodox Church after the publication of novel \"Voskresenie/ Resurrection\" (1899), continued with attempts to reconcile religion and science by the philosopher Vladimir Solovyov, and led to the atheism of the Bolsheviks (both the Lenin and the Bogdanov wings of the party in exile). Tolstoy was one of the most famous and influential advocates of anarchism and pacifism in the world. When the insurrection erupted in 1905 (a spontaneous uprising with no leader in control), the symbolists saw the dawning of a new age. Both Merezhkovsky and Andrei Belyi interpreted the events of 1905 in apocalyptic and mystical terms.\n\nThe Moskovskiy Hudojestvenny Akademicheskiy Teatr or MHAT (Moscow Art Theater) was established in 1898 by Konstantin Stanislavski and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko with a celebrated production of Chekhov's play \"Chaika/ The Seagull\", with Vsevolod Meyerhold in the lead male role and Chekhov's wife Olga Knipper in the lead female role. Stanislavski became famous all over the world for his \"system\" of actor training. No less important for that theater was the set designer, Viktor Simov. Stanislavski's pupil Vsevolod Meyerhold (of German descent) became famous for his productions of symbolist plays, for which he was inspired by the Italian \"commedia dell'arte\" and by the circus, notably the 1906 staging of Aleksandr Blok's \"Balaganchik\". He trained actors to perform in an exaggerated and grotesque physical style. Theater was still an enormously popular form of entertainment for the intellectual and political elite.\n\nRussian literature was just Russian, but the performance arts were as cosmopolitan as it gets. For example, Russian ballet (later the greatest ballet school in the world) originated from a milieu of foreigners who were hired by the czar for the Imperial Ballet of Saint Petersburg. In 1862 the French choreographer Marius Petipa set up the extravagant ÂThe PharaohÂs DaughterÂ (1862) with Italian ballerina Carolina Rosati, music by Italian composer Cesare Pugni, and set designs by German artists Andreas Roller and Hermann Wagner. Petipa later became ballet master of the Imperial Ballet for more than 30 years, producing epochal ballets like TchaikovskyÂs ÂThe Sleeping BeautyÂ and ÂThe NutcrackerÂ. A frequent collaborator of Petipa was composer Ludwig Minkus, a Jew from Austria.\n\nCultural diversity was inherent in a multinational empire like the one inherited by czar Nikolay II in 1894, an empire that included Ukraine, Poland, the Baltic states, Finland, Karelia, Armenia, the Muslim provinces of the Caucasus, Armenia, Turkestan, Siberia, etc. The Russians were just one ethnic group, and not even the most charismatic. For example, the Cossacks were generally more idealized. They were almost the Russian equivalent of the American gunslingers and cowboys: they colonized the South and the East, they defended the new territories against the native people (the ÂIndiansÂ of Russia) and they were sometimes bandits and sometimes heroes. They symbolized the Russian version of the ÂFrontierÂ. Lev Tolstoy proclaimed that ÂAll Russians wish to be CossacksÂ. The most famous Cossack, Stepan Razin, raided Persia. Russia also had a sizeable population of Jews. In fact, at the turn of the 20th century the Russian Empire had the largest Jewish population in the world. Unfortunately, state-sponsored anti-semitism led to horrific pogroms. Many Jews were forced to convert in order to live normal lives. Jews were persecuted (especially in Ukraine) after the assassination of czar Aleksandr II. Jews were expelled from Kiev in 1886 and from Moscow in 1891. It is not surprising that many Jews joined the socialist and communist groups which plotted to overthrow the czarist regime.\n\nIronically it was the emancipation of the serfs in 1861 that triggered the sociopolitical movement that would lead to Russia's communist revolution. There was a whole class of intellectuals that saw that \"emancipation\" as simply turning peasants into oppressed agrarian workers. The goal of \"liberating\" those peasants mixed with the goal of terminating the czarist monarchy. Despite being inspired by the conditions of peasants (after all, Russia was not an industrial economy yet), Russian socialism evolved out of the urban axis connecting Saint Petersburg's salon and Moscow University, but mostly grew in exile. Some of the influential intellectuals that contributed to its ascent in Russia (while often living abroad) were: Mikhail Bakunin, who spent most of his life between prison and exile, who in 1864 formed the International Brotherhood with members in multiple European countries, and who developed an atheistic, anti-clerical and anarchic philosophy in the magazine Liberta` e Giustizia (Freedom and Justice) that he started in Italy in 1865; Alexander Herzen, an emigre' in London who founded in 1857 the Russian-language newspaper \"Kolokol\" (The Bell) and argued that the peasants, not the proletariat, the peasants organized in communes, should launched Russia's socialist revolution; Nikolay Chernyshevsky, author of \"Chto Delat?/ What Is to Be Done?\" (1863), who similarly viewed the peasant cooperatives as the launching pad for the building of a new society; the Rouble Society, founded in 1867 in Saint Petersburg by Herman Lopatin and Felix Volkhovskii; Mark Natanson, a Lithuanian Jew who in 1868 in Saint Petersburg started the Bolshoye Obshchestvo Propagandy (Grand Society of Propaganda), originally a secret society to share banned books but then famous for the 1874 campaign Khozhdeniye v Narod (Going to the People), an almost religious exodus of thousands of students from Saint Petersburg and Moscow to the countryside (an example of stateless social organization), following a call by Pyotr Lavrov for the intellectuals to educate the peasants; students who embraced revolutionary terrorism like Peter Tkachev, arrested in 1869, and Sergei Nechaev, author of \"Katehizis Revoljucionera/ The Revolutionary Catechism\" (1869) and the inspiration for Dostoyevsky's \"The Possessed\"; Pyotr Lavrov, founder in exile in 1873 of the magazine Vpered/ Forward (first in Zurich and then in London); the economist Nikolai Danielson, who in 1872 published the first Russian translation of Karl Marx's \"Das Kapital\"; Georgi Plekhanov, who in 1876 led demonstrations in Saint Petersburg dubbed \"Zemlya i Volya\" (Land and Liberty aka Land and Freedom), which evolved into a secret revolutionary organization, a continuation of the Grand Society but with a marked Bakunin influence in its quest for \"anarchy and collectivism\"; Narodnaya Volya (People's Will), a terrorist wing of Land and Freedom founded in 1879 (largely in response to the regime's repression of the Narodist movement) that in 1991 assassinated czar Alexander II; the anarchist Peter Kropotkin, who in 1879 in Switzerland started the magazine Le Revolte' to elaborate an original mix of anarchism and communism; Chornyi Peredel (Black Repartition), the \"peaceful\" wing of Land and Freedom, started in 1879 by Georgi Plekhanov and others; and Pavel Axelrod, a Black Reparation co-founder who in 1883 in Switzerland co-founded Osvobozhdenie Truda (Emancipation of Labor) with Plekhanov and others, the first truly Marxist movement. Hence from the beginning this reform anti-monarchical movement was split between \"terrorists\" and \"educators\" (in the end Narodnaya Volya and Osvobozhdenie Truda), and it had countless different ideological branches. Plekhanov was instrumental in theorizing a syncretic view of the movement and in adopting Marxism in earnest, notably in \"Socializm i Politicheskaja Borba/ Socialism and Political Struggle\" (1883). Scholars like Vasily Vorontsov, author of \"Sudby Kapitalizma v Rossii/ The Fate of Capitalism in Russia\" (1882), Nikolai Mikhailovsky, Nikolai Danielson, Pyotr Struve and Vladimir Ulyanov (later better known as Vladimir Lenin, who had been living in Europe since 1900) were debating Russia's stance towards capitalism. Much of these intellectual activities were carried out through clandestine publications and/or in exile. Many of the original founders were actually detached from real Russian life, having resettled in Western European cities. However, their work began to produce results, as social-democratic organizations and unions of workers sprang up in many cities. Plekhanov and the other Osvobozhdenie Truda activists simply had to readjust their theories based on the events, both the grass-roots strikes and the relative success of Narodnaya Volya terrorist activities (which impressed Engels himself). At last, six organizations got together in Minsk in 1898 to form the Rossijskaja Social-demokraticeskaja Rabocaja Partija/ Russian Social-Democratic Workers Party (RSDRP). Struve wrote its manifesto. In 1902 Lenin published \"What Is To Be Done?\" in which he advocated a role for the party as \"the vanguard of the proletariat\". His rival in the party was Julius Martov (a Jew born Yuliy Tsederbaum in Istanbul and raised in Ukraine). In 1903 at a London conference Lenin's Bolshevik party split from Martov's Menshevik party. Lenin convinced the Jewish mystical poet Nikolai Minsky to become the editor of the first legal Bolshevik daily newspaper, Novaya Zhizn (New Life), formally founded by Alexander Bogdanov in October 1905 in Saint Petersburg.\n\nIf the left was getting more determined in its ambitions to overthrow the monarchy, the right was no less active in trying to defend the monarchy. The forces of reaction included many both aristocrats and landowners as well as church leaders and assorted spiritual figures. The Russian Orthodox Church was aligned with the czars. Two influential figures of the Church were Ivan Sergiyev, known as \"saint\" Ioann Kronshtadtsky, and Georgiy Dolganyov, better known as bishop Hermogenes. The occult, esoteric Theosophical Society had been founded in 1875 in New York by a Russian aristocrat, Helena Blavatsky. While she never returned to Russia, theosophy and other occult spiritual movements percolated into the Saint Petersburg aristocracy. Antisemitism was rampant. Pavel Krushevan published in Kishinev (Bessarabia/ Moldova) the Russian-language newspaper Bessarabets that stirred up the population to carry out the pogrom against Jews of 1903, the first major pogroms in 40 years. A few weeks after the pogrom, another newspaper owned by Krushevan, Znamya (Banner) in Saint Petersburg, published \"Protokoly Sionskih Mudrecov/ The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\", an antisemitic forgery that \"proved\" a Jewish plot to dominate the world (the full version of this forged document appeared in 1905 as an appendix to Sergei Nilus's second edition of his \"Velikoe v Malom i Antikhrist, Kak Blizkaja Politicheskaja Vozmozhnost/ The Great within the Small and Antichrist, an Imminent Political Possibility\"). During the 1905 riots, Vladimir Purishkevich, a wealthy Bessarabian (Moldovian) landowner, organized a paramilitary militia known as the Chornaya Sotnya (Black Hundreds) to fight left-wing rioters. He was a Russian fascist ante-litteram: pro-monarchist, pro-clerical, ultra-nationalist, antisemitic and anticommunist. He supported Russia's imperial annexation of other peoples (like Poland, Ukraine and Finland) and in particular he rejected the existence of an Ukrainian people.\n\nThere was also a philosophical current that viewed materialism in the worst possible manner: the idealists, later named Vekhovtsy. Their anti-positivist credo was expressed in books like Nikolai BerdyaevÂs \"Subektivizm i Individualizm\" (1901) and Sergei Bulgakov's \"Ot Marksizma k Idealizmu\" (1903), and especially in two collections of essays titled \"Problemy Idealizma/ Problems of Idealism\" (1902) and \"Vekhi\" (1909).\n\nIt was against this political and philosophical background that cinema arrived in Russia. In 1896 the Lumiere brothers traveled to Moscow and Saint Petersburg to exhibit movies and their cameraman Camille Cerf filmed the coronation of czar Nikolay II. For a decade the French (Lumiere, Pathe', Gaumont) dominated the Russian film industry and exhibitions. Nikolay II was fond of both photography and cinema, and starting in 1897 short films (newsreels and home movies) were shot at his Saint Petersburg palace mainly by Polish photographer Boleslaw Matuszewski.\n\nTolstoy did not publish any major work after 1898 (he died in 1910). Chekhov died in 1904. The years around 1905 also marked the disappearance of the last survivors of one of the world's greatest literary generations.\n\nAfter the 1905 Revolution\n\nThe year 1905 ended with the liberalization of political parties.\n\nIn the wake of this proclamation, a group of right-wing aristocrats led by Alexander Dubrovin and Vladimir Purishkevich formed the Soyuz Russkogo Naroda (Union of the Russian People), a right-wing political party. The Black Hundreds becamed the armed wing of this party. A few weeks later, Alexander Dubrovin started the newspaper Russkoye Znamya, which became the organ of the new party. In 1908 Purishkevich also established the anti-semitic and nationalist Soyuz Mikhaila Arkhangela (Union of the Archangel Michael), further to the right of the Soyuz Russkogo Naroda. In 1910 a member of this far-right group became the leader of Soyuz Russkogo Naroda.\n\nHowever, after the 1905 revolution Nikolay II and his wife fell under the spell of a charlatan from Siberia who claimed to be a healer and a fortune teller: Grigori Rasputin. His power at the Saint Petersburg court increased in the following decade until a conspiracy of aristocrats assassinated him in 1916. In 1916 Purishkevich was one of the conspirators in Rasputin's assassination.\n\nThe years between the two revolutions (1905 and 1917) witnessed a creative boom in the arts. Some of the greatest novels in the Russian language were published: Maxim Gorky's \"Mat/ Mother\" (1907), Ivan Bunin's \"Derevnya/ The Village\" (1909), Andrey Bely's \"Petersburg\" (1912), and Velemir Khlebnikov's \"Ka\" (1916). Theater was blessed with plays such as Sologub's \"Pobeda Smerti/ Triumph of Death\" (1907), Leonid Andreev's \"Tot Kto Poluchaet Poshchechiny/ He Who Gets Slapped\" (1915), Mikhail Kuzmin's \"Venetsianskie Bezumtsy/ Venetian Madcaps\" (1914), Velemir Khlebnikov's \"Death's Mistake\" (1915), and Aleksandr Blok's \"Balaganchik/ The Puppet Show\" (1906), \"Roza i Krest/ The Rose and the Cross\" (1912) and \"Neznakomka/ The Unknown Woman\" (1914). Symbolist poets such as Aleksandr Blok, Sologub, Innokenty Annensky and Vyacheslav Ivanov kept churning out great poems. In 1910 the aspiring Ukrainian painter and poet David Burliuk organized the Gileya (Hylaea) group (Hylaea being the ancient Greek name for the region of Ukraine around Kherson where he lived) and in 1912 he worded the manifesto \"Poshchochina Obshchestvennomu Vkusu/ A Slap in the Face of Public Taste\" (1912), inspired by the Italian futurists of Filippo Marinetti. This futurist group soon included two outstanding poets: Velemir Khlebnikov (of Tatar descent) and Vladimir Mayakovsky (a Georgian of Cossack and Ukrainian descent) Another poetic movement, \"acmeism\", nurtured the careers of two other important poets: Anna Akhmatova and Osip Mandelstam.\n\nLiterary criticism had a massive role in the literary debates of the time. The most famous school was the \"formalists, which had two centers: the Moscow Linguistic Circle (1915), with Filipp Fortunatov and Roman Jakobson, and the OPOJAZ group (1916) in Saint Petersburg with Viktor Shklovsky and Osip Brik (OPOJAZ stands for \"Obshchestvo Izucheniia Poeticheskogo Yazyka\", Society for the Study of Poetic Language).\n\nMusic too was churning out artists of international standing, notably: Alexander Scriabin (inspired by Cosmism), Sergei Rachmaninoff, Sergei Prokofev and Igor Stravinsky (an inspiration on Eurasianism for the way he broke with European musical traditions).\n\nAfter 1905 the Russian art world was equally ebullient. Artistic movements (plural) were born, mutated, cannibalized themselves and died in rapid succession. The \"avantgarde\" spanned various isms. Generally speaking, they were original Russian variants of the groundbreaking artistic movements of western Europe (Impressinism, Cubism, Fauvism, Futurism, Expressionism) that often integrated ideas coming from different capitals of the art world with Russian folkloric traditions. Generally speaking, the Russian avantgarde rejected the aristocratic painting tradition and focused instead on the ordinary life of the everyman but also increasingly explored the edges of figurative painting until it entered the uncharted territory of pure abstraction. Art exhibitions were important: an exhibition was viewed as the manifesto of a new artistic movement. And then there were plenty of defiant manifestos and declarations. Russia was not in the mainstream of the scientific revolution but obviously the intellectuals were aware of the new view of matter arising from western science: in 1900 Max Planck laid the foundations for Quantum Mechanics and Sigmund Freud published \"The Interpretation of Dreams\", in 1902 Ernest Rutherford argued that the atom are made of smaller units, and in 1905 Einstein introduced Relativity. The paradigm shifts in western science and art and the political revolution inside Russia fueled a burst of artistic creativity around Russia. It all started with Neo-Primitivism, launched in Moscow by Natalia Goncharova and Mikhail Larionov in 1907, a child-like artistic style that paid tribute to Russian folkloric styles, similarly to what Paul Gauguin had done with his African-influenced paintings. In November 1909 the painter and musician Mikhail Matyushin in Saint Petersburg formed the group Soyuz Molodyozhi (Union of Youth), whose manifesto was written by Olga Rozanova. Matyushin's vision was essentially spiritual: he thought of art as a vehicle for the human mind to transcend the spatio-temporal dimensions. Nonetheless Soyuz Molodyozhi nurtured the avantgarde. Artists who gravitated around it included Kazimir Malevich, Elena Guro, Pavel Filonov and Vladimir Tatlin. Their exhibitions were supported financially by a wealthy young man, Leki Zheverzheyev. In 1909 the Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti published his \"Manifesto del Futurismo\", which exerted a strong influence on Russian artists. Russian artists (who lived in a mainly agricultural nation) were fascinated like the Italian futurists by the rise of the machine age, seduced by the dynamism and energy of industrialization. Larionov organized an exhibition of avantgarde paintings called ÂBubnovy Valet/ Jack of DiamondsÂ, held between December 1910 and January 1911 in Moscow. It included some minor French cubists, Wassily Kandinsky (an influential Russian living in Germany) and members of the Russian avantgarde influenced by the French (especially by Cezanne and Matisse), including Malevich. Bubnovy Valet became the name of an association of Muscovite painters who also benefited from the blessing of a famous art collector, Sergei Shchukin. Kandinsky was living abroad but exerted a strong influence on the Russian avantgarde. In 1911 he formed in Munich, along with Franz Marc, the expressionist group Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), and his \"Painting with a Circle\" (1911) inaugurated European abstract art, aka Non-Objectivity. Meanwhile, Goncharova and Larionov were gathering artists around their cause, including Malevich and Tatlin, while changing style every year. Larionov organized two important exhibitions of the avantgarde in Moscow: ÂOsliniy Khvost/ The DonkeyÂs TailÂ (1912), whose title paid tribute to the bohemian Parisian artists who claimed that their painting was executed with a donkeyÂs tail, and ÂMishen/ The TargetÂ (1913), which summarized all the currents of the previous years, from Neo-Primitivism to Futurism. During the latter, Goncharova and Larionov published \"Luchisty i Budushchniki/ Rayonists and Futurists\", the manifesto of a new current, Rayonism, which subscribed to Kandinsky's new abstract and anti-naturalist style. At the peak of her fame, in 1913 Goncharova shocked Moscow with a personal retrospective, which counts as the first solo exhibition of an artist of the Russian avantgarde. Kubo-Futurizm (Cubo-Futurism) was a term originally applied to the visual and sound poetry of Alexei Kruchenykh and Velimir Khlebninkov within David Burliuk's Gileya group of writers, but the term was appropriated by Kazimir Malevich for the paintings that he exhibited at Larionov's events, and then Alexandra Exter and Lyubov Popova followed suit. The avantgarde artists drew attention also with their unorthodox and defiant behavior and clothing, clearly meant to provoke the bourgeoisie, and with their endless and vicious intestine quarrels. Predating the Dada movement, they often treated artworks as childish pranks, and behaved like masked carnival jesters. While briefly intrigued by the avantgarde, two painters remained in the periphery of the Russian avantgarde: Marc Chagall, a Jew in Vitebsk (Belarus), and Aleksandr Shevchenko, a Ukrainian. Shevchenko well expressed the futurist sentiment: ÂThe world has been transformed into a single, monstrous, fantastic, perpetually-moving machine, into a single huge non-animal automatic organism\" (1913). The visual arts influenced also theater (and later cinema). For example, in 1913 Goncharova designed sets and costumes for DiaghilevÂs opera-ballet \"Le Coq dÂor/ The Golden Cockerel\". In the summer of 1913 Soyuz Molodyozhi and Gileya joined forces to organize the Teatr Budetlyanin (Theatre of the Futurist), whose manifesto was written by Kruchonykh, Malevich and Matyushin (a writer, an artist and a musician). The result of their collaboration, at the end of 1913, was the cubist-futurist opera \"Pobeda nad Solntsem/ Victory over the Sun\", composed by Matyushin, with a prologue by Khlebnikov, a libretto by Kruchenykh (in the invented zaum language) and set design by Malevich, premiered at the Luna Park in Saint Petersburg. The opera narrates the conquest of the Sun by means of a black square. The audience didn't know it, but the black square inaugurated a new important style, Malevich's Suprematism. The dizzying merry-go-round of the Russian avantgarde ended with World War I. Soyuz Molodyozhi and Bubnovy Valet were disbanded. But the multiple competing streams of the avantgarde had taken Russian art to pure abstraction. In March 1915 Ivan Puni and his wife Xenia Boguslavskaja organized in Saint Petersburg the first Russian Cubo-Futurist exhibition, titled \"1-aya Pervaya Futuristicheskaya Vystavka Kartin/ Tramway V - The first Futurist Exhibition of Paintings\". The show featured two controversial highlights: Malevich's abstract paintings consisting of geometric figures and the equally abstract sculptures made from unorthodox materials by Vladimir Tatlin. Suprematism was another attempt to create an original (not derivative) Russian avantgarde movement. Malevich had started out as an impressionist, then embraced neo-primitivism, then transitioned to Cubo-Futurism, and finally reached Suprematism or, better, Alogism, which was all about geometric abstraction. Malevich's followers included Alexandra Exter, Liubov Popova and Olga Rozanova (and an unusual number of female artists). At the end of 1915 Malevich organized in Saint Petersburg an exhibition of \"non-objective\" paintings titled \"Poslednyaya Futuristicheskaya Vystavka Kartin 0,10/ The Last Futurist Exhibition of Painting 0,10\" (the two numbers separated by a comma). The centerpiece of the show was the \"Black Square\". Vladimir Tatlin contributed a hanging sculpture titled \"Corner Counter-Relief\", which inaugurated yet another movement, Constructivism (although the name would be coined much later). A few months later, in March 1916, Tatlin organized a group exhibition titled \"Magazin/ The Store\", which debuted a new suprematist and constructivist artist, Alexander Rodchenko. In 1916 Aleksei Kruchenykh published a book of collages titled \"Vselenskaja Vojna/ Universal War\". Exter was emblematic of the promiscuous symbiosis between painting, theater and cinema. A Polish-born cosmopolitan globe-trotter Ukrainian-based futurist and constructivist painter, and curator of avantgarde art, she designed sets for theatrical productions and went on to design the pavilions of the first All-Russian Exhibition of Agriculture, Handicrafts and Industry of 1923 and the Soviet pavilions at the Venice Biennale of 1924.\n\nRussia incorporated Western art but then developed its own unique variant, both in literature and in the visual arts, by criticizing the very Western art that it was appropriating. The Russian avantgarde was born out of criticizing Impressionism, Cubism and Futurism, Russia produced an incredible amount of radical art that was fundamentally a strategy of \"non-art\", challenging the boundaries of the artistic sphere as defined by Western canons. Kazimir Malevich's \" Black Square\" (1915) was emblematic: it was, first and foremost, art that reflected on art, on itself, art as art criticism.\n\nThe Birth of Russian Cinema\n\nA Saint Petersburg photographer named Alexander Drankov established the first Russian movie studio (in the same building where Andrei Bely had written his masterpiece \"Petersburg\") and, after shelving an adaptation of Alexander Pushkin's ÂBoris GodunovÂ, produced the historical costume movie Stenka Razin (1908), about the Cossack rebel of the 17th century, scripted by Vasily Goncharov, directed by a Vladimir Romashkov and shot by the Ukrainian photographer Nikolai Kozlovsky. Also in 1908 and also in Saint Petersburg, Vladislav Karpinsky launched his Omnium studio.\n\nRussian cinema, like Russian ballet, was initially a cosmopolitan enterprise. For example, LÂKhaim/ To Life (1910), was scripted by a Russian (journalist Aleksandr Arkatov) but directed by a Frenchman and a Dane (Maurice Maitre and Kai Hansen) for the French company Pathe' from an idea by Pathe's cinematographer Joseph-Louis Mundwiller who, under the pseudonym George Meyer, had made the first Polish fiction film, Antos Pierwszy raz w Warszawie/ AntoshÂs First Time in Warsaw (1908). The film, devoted to Jewish life in a village, is better classified as the first ever Jewish narrative film than as a \"Russian\" film. The historical epic Pokorenie Kavkaza/ The Conquest of the Caucasus (1913), later released as Vziatie Guniba ili Pokorenie Kavkaza / The Capture of Ghunib or the Conquest of the Caucasus (36 minute shorter, 1775 metres instead of 2525 metres), was co-directed by Austrian filmmaker Ludwig Czerny and Georgian historian Simon Esadze (Georgia's first screenwriter and feature-film director), photographed by Nikolai Kozlovskii (the cameraman of DrankovÂs Stenka Razin) with set designed by French-Ukrainian painter Francois Roubaud (aka Franz Rubo).\n\nThanks to Stenka Razin, Vasily Goncharov discovered that the Russian public was fascinated by the great figures of the past, and so his biopics Petr Velikii/ Peter the Great (1910) and Zhizn i Smert Pushkina/ The Life and Death of Pushkin (1910) were hits. Aleksandr Khanzhonkov produced Russia's first feature film, the two-hour Oborona Sevastopolja/ The Defense of Sevastopol (1911), co-directed with Goncharov, a film that starred Ivan Mozhukhin (later a star in France as Ivan Mosjoukine). Goncharov therefore learned that the Russian public also craved for historical events and delivered 1812 God/ The Year 1812 (1912), Votsarenie Doma Romanovykh/ The Accession of the Romanov Dynasty (1913) and Ermak Timofeevich (1914). His studio employed photographer Boris Zavelev and director Pyotr Chardynin, and specialized in faithful adaptations of Russian literary classics, mostly costume dramas set in the countryside.\n\nYevgeny Bauer, the son of an Austrian man (a court musician for the czar), was Russia's first cinematic artist, directing first for Drankov, notably Sumerki Zhenskoj Dushi/ Twilight of a Woman's Soul (1913), and then for Khanzhonkov, aided by photographer Boris Zavelev, employing lighting effects and framing preferences that were influenced by Danish cinema (e.g. by Urban Gad), especially in Grjozy/ Daydreams (1915). Bauer directed ballerina Vera Karalli in movies such as Umirajushhij Lebed/ The Dying Swan (1917) and turned Vera Kholodnaya into a star with movies such as Zhizn zo Zhizn/ A Life for a Life (1916). The latter also starred Vitold Polonsky, who had become a star with Bauer's Posle Smerti/ After Death (1915), an adaptation of Ivan Turgenev's novella \"Klara Milich\" (1883). Drankov also produced the serial Sonka Zolotaia Ruchka / Sonya the Golden Hand/ Light-fingered Sonya (1914) about real-life criminal named Sonya Bliuvshtein who had captured the imagination of the Russian tabloids. Arkatov (the screenwriter of L'Khaim) directed several movies about Jewish life in Russia, from Gore Sarry/ Sorrows of Sarah (1913) to Hochu byt Rotshildom/ I Want to Be a Rothschild (1918).\n\nElizaveta von Mickwitz (of Polish descent) and her husband Pavel Thiemann (of German descent), formed a production company in Moscow, funded by the tobacco merchant Friedrich Reinhardt, that debuted with the short Smert Ioanna Groznogo/ Death of Ivan the Terrible (1909), adapted from Lev Tolstoy's story by Vasily Goncharov, while Elizaveta personally co-directed with Jakov Protazanov the 31-minute movie Ukhod Velikovo Startza/ The Passing of the Great Old Man (1912), about Lev Tolstoy's last days. Perhaps more importantly, their company imported the films of Ole Olsen's Nordisk production company, films like Urban Gad's 37-minute Afgrunden/ The Abyss (1910) that represented a major aesthetic departure for multi-reel cinema. They hired directors Jakov Protazanov and Vladimir Gardin (born Dobronravov) for their literary adaptations: Anfisa (Protazanov, 1912), from Leonid AndreyevÂs play; Anna Karenina (Gardin, 1914) from Lev Tolstoy's novel; A Nest of Gentlefolk (Gardin, 1914) from Ivan Turgenev's novel; The Kreuzer Sonata (Gardin, 1914) from Lev Tolstoy's novella; Plebei (Protazanov, 1915), from StrindbergÂs ÂFroken JulieÂ; culminating with the 100-minute Voyna i Mir/ War and Peace (1915), the first adaptation of Lev Tolstoy's masterpiece, directed by both. Gardin and Protazanov co-directed the three-hour Kliuchi Schastia/ The Keys to Happiness (1913, lost), Gardin's debut, adapted from Anastasiya Verbitskaya's novel, photographed by Aleksandr Levitsky and starring Vladimir Maksimov and Olga Preobrazhenskaya, their most ambitious endeavour. Gardin, Protazanov and Pyotr Chardynin directed the serial Peterburgskiye Trushchobi/ Petersburg Slums (1915). Elizaveta also empowered theatrical giant Vsevolod Meyerhold to direct a 22-minute adaptation of Oscar WildeÂs novel, Portret Doriana Greiia/ The Portrait of Dorian Gray (1915). The house of the Thiemanns was a popular meeting place for Moscow writers, artists, and actors. World War I doomed them. When Germany declared war on Russia, their studio was vandalized by a crowd of anti-German fanatics, and in 1915 Thiemann and Reinhardt were among the Germans expelled from Moscow. In any case the German blockade of the North Sea made it difficult to import the Danish films.\n\nBy then the Âelectric theatreÂ was established as a meeting place of the intelligentsia and several movie theaters were owned by women. After all, Saint Peterburg is where the All-Women's Congress was held in 1908.\n\nNatalia Bakhareva (born Natalia Noga in Ukraine, Nikolai LeskovÂs granddaughter), already a journalist and playwright, was a female film producer that in 1914 owned her company, Khudozhestvennaia Lenta, scripted several films and hired Aleksander Panteleev to direct them. The company focused on famous names of theater: Vo Ima Proshlogo/ For the Sake of the Past (1915) starred theater actor Vladimir Davydov and Uragan Strastei/ The Hurricane of Passions (1915) starred theater actress Lydia Yavorskaia while Cobra Kapella (1917) starred opera singer Kleo Karini.\n\nAlready around 1905 a dancer of the Imperial Ballet, Marius Petipa's pupil Aleksandr Shiriaev, created animated ballet movies with rudimentary stop-motion animation and puppet animation (for personal use). But the pioneer of Russian animation was a Lithuanian who worked for Aleksandr Khanzhonkovh's production company in Moscow: Vladislav Starevich, who made stop-motion shorts such as Lucanus Cervus (1910), considered the first puppet film, and especially Mest' Kinematograficheskogo Operatora/ The Cameraman's Revenge (1912), an early example of cinema within cinema, and later had a brilliant career in France.\n\nCzarist cinema didn't offer much more than that. Jakov Protazanov directed Ivan Mozhukhin in literary works such as Pikovaya Dama/ The Queen of Spade (1916), a Pushkin adaptation, and Otec Sergij/ Father Sergius (1918), a Lev Tolstoy adaptation that also starred Vera Orlova.\n\nThe star of czarist cinema was Vera Kholodnaya, launched by Bauer. Her blockbusters were tragic melodramas directed by Pyotr Chardynin: Mirazhi/ The Mirages (1916), U Kamina/ By the Fireplace (1917), starring also Vladimir Maksimov and Vitold Polonsky, and Molchi, Grust, Molchi/ Be Silent, My Sorrow, Be Silent (1918). In 1917, at the peak of her fame, she made dozens of movies but then the Revolution slowed down and eventually killed her career. She died in 1919.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Russian theatrical melodrama, early Russian cinema favored sad endings over happy endings. Another difference with Northamerican movies was that Russian actors were asked to deliver feelings, not action. Acting was about the inner life, not the outer one.\n\nBefore World War I foreign films dominated Russian theaters. The early stars were French comedian Max Linder and Danish dramatic actress Asta Nielsen.\n\nSoviet Cinema 1917-39\n\nWorld War I disrupted the flow of movies from western Europe to Russia, and largely isolated Russia from the European film market. The films of those four years were mainly made by Russians in Russia. Khanzhonkov became the largest studio of the Russian empire. The studio founded in 1911 in Moscow by Joseph Yermoliev/ Emolieff briefly benefited from the boom in domestic production, but in 1917 Yermoliev fled to Paris. Saint Petersburg studios included Omnium and a studio called Neptun, notable for hiring Mayakovsky. New studios were born, like Moisei Aleinikov's Rus, which opened in 1915.\n\nWorld War I led to Russia's humiliating defeat by the Germans. The czarist regime was overthrown by the double revolution, of February and October, in 1917, and between the spring of 1918 and November 1920 the anti-communist Mensheviks had to fight a strenuous civil war, flanked by the Western powers in both Europe and Asia. Vladimir Lenin's Bolsheviks quickly took control of the main cities. The Communist Party proclaimed the dictatorship of the proletariat and in 1919 founded the Communist International (\"Comintern\") to spread communism all over the world. The biggest social and political transformation of Russia had begun.\n\nMayakovsky's brief involvement in cinema was typical of the enthusiastic reaction of many intellectuals to the fall of czarism and to the rise of the new medium of cinema. He worked for Saint Petersburg's Neptun studio as both a screenwriter and actor. He was the male lead of three movies that he scripted in 1918: Baryshnya i Khuligan/ The Lady and the Hooligan, which he co-directed with Yevgeni Slavinsky, adapted from Edmondo DeAmicis' play \"La Maestrina degli Operai/ The Workers' Schoolmistress\", Nye Dlya Deneg Radivshisya/ Born Not for the Money (1918), co-written with David Burliuk and directed by Nikandr Turkin, full of revolutionary spirit, and especially the fantasy Zakovannaja Filmoj/ Shackled by Film, directed again by Turkin, about the love of a painter for a ballerina who emerges from a movie.\n\nIn 1918 Russia's film industry was nationalized (like everything else) and soon only one state-owned monopoly of distribution existed: Goskino (formally created in 1922, then transformed into Sovkino and then into Soyuzkino), reporting to the Narodnyj Komissariat Prosveshheni (PeopleÂs Commissar of Education) or Narkompros), whose head was veteran Anatoly Lunacharsky. The Khanzhonkov studio became the Moscow film production unit of Goskino which then absorbed Yermoliev and others and became known as Mosfilm. The Omnium studio became the Saint Petersburg film production unit of Goskino, named Sevzapkino and eventually known as Lenfilm (after being called Sevzapkino, Leningradkino, Sovkino, Soiuzkino, Rosfilm, etc). Lenfilm initially made \"agitki\" and one of them, Uplotnenie/ The Condensation (1918), directed by Aleksandr Panteleev from a script by commissar Anatoly Lunacharsky in person, was the first feature film of post-czarist Russia (not yet Soviet Union). Drankov and others had already shut down. Similarly, in 1922 the Ukrainian film industry was nationalized under a state-owned monopoly, the Vse-Ukrainske Foto Kino Upravlinnia (All-Ukrainian Photo Cinema Administration) or VUFKU, with main studios in Odesa (the nationalized Kharitonov, Borisov and Grossman film studios) and Yalta (former Khanzhonkov and Yermoliev studios, technically in Russia because at the time Crimea was part of Russia not Ukraine).\n\nOne year after the Revolution, in October 1918, the communists organized the Vsesoyuzny Leninsky Kommunistichesky Soyuz Molodyozhi (All-Union Leninist Young Communist League) or VLKSM, better known as Komsomol. \"Brigades\" of the Komsomol were also organized in the film studios.\n\nIn 1919 another veteran, Vladimir Gardin, the director who had specialized in Lev Tolstoy adaptations, was placed in charge of the newly established Moscow Film School. One of the first teachers was Lev Kuleshov, another man who had learned the craft in Aleksandr Khanzhonkov's studios and now a theoretician of montage and editing. Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin were among his students.\n\nAn important movement that both predated and supported the revolutions of 1917 was the \"Proletkult\" movement (an abbreviation of \"proletarian culture\"), intent on creating a \"proletarian culture\" as fundamentally different from the elite culture of the past, a culture created by the proletariat itself, focused on the collective rather than on the individual. During the decade before World War I, Alexander Bogdanov was Lenin's chief rival for leadership of the Bolshevik party. Bogdanov, an atheist like Lenin, philosophized that human society was inevitably evolving toward collectivism (\"sobiranie cheloveka\") and that science was a key component of this process. GoetheÂs Faust, who sold his soul for knowledge, was his role model. While in jail, Bogdanov wrote \"Empiriomonism\" (1906), which Lenin viciously criticized in \"Materialism and Empirio-criticism\" (1908). There was a current, also represented by Nikolai Valentinov's \"Ernst Mach and Marxism\" (1907) and by Bogdanov's brother-in-law Anatoly Lunacharsky, that advocated a fusion of Marx and Ernst Mach. In 1909 at a Paris conference Bogdanov (now living in exile) was defeated by Lenin (also living in exile since 1897) and was expelled from the Bolshevik party. Nonetheless, Bogdanov, Lunacharsky and the writer Maxim Gorky (nicknamed the Bogostroiteli or ÂgodbuildersÂ) launched their own esoteric and somewhat heretical \"Vpered/ Forward\" movement, and in the Italian island of Capri they developed their own theories on the future of proletarian culture while Lenin was in Paris. Gorky and Bogdanov were finally allowed to return to Russia in 1914, following a political amnesty. When the revolution deposed the czar, the Proletkult movement spontaneously spread to many cities, creating a network of proletarian cultural-educational organizations. Bogdanov was the key figure of the Moscow Proletkult. They organized the first national conference of Proletkult (1918) and founded the magazine Proletarskaia Kultura (1918). In 1920 Lenin terminated the existence of Proletkult as a separate organization. The end of the civil war in 1923 also spelled the demise of grass-roots movements.\n\nAn important vehicle for the spread of revolutionary ideology and spirit was the \"agit-train\" (\"agitpoyezd\"). The Bolsheviks used the czarist empire's extensive rail network not only to deploy troops (Trotsky set up his permanent headquarters aboard a train) but also to spread propaganda. These special trains, brightly painted by artists like Malevich and Lissitsky, were equipped with a printing press, a library, a movie theater, a broadcast radio station, a newspaper office, and a darkroom to develop photographs. They distributed pamphlets, posters and newspapers. They showed newsreels to peasants who had never seen a movie before. They carried agitational speakers such as Mikhail Kalinin (who had been instrumental in establishing the newspaper Pravda) to deliver inspirational speeches to illiterate crowds. The trains also established \"agitpunkty\" (agitational offices) along the way, which in turn set up libraries and theatres. Cinema was the main attraction and the Bolshevik bureaucrats were the first in the world to realize its power over the masses. The trains showed and sometimes produced \"agitki\" expressly designed for exhibition on the agit-trains. Dziga Vertov produced the newsreel series Kinonedelja/ Kino-week (43 of them in 1918-19) on the agit-trains, a record of daily life during the civil war, and showed his first full-length film, Godovshchina Revolyutsii/ Anniversary of the Revolution (1918), on such a train.\n\nIn 1920 the Communist Party instituted the Otdel Agitatsii i Propagandy (Department of Agitation and Propaganda) with the goal to direct \"agit-prop\" activities. Culture and propaganda became the same thing. Theater, in particular, was identified as a medium suitable to indoctrinate the uneducated lower classes (workers, peasants, soldiers). Theater, written by sophisticated intellectuals (like Anton Chekhov) and experienced in downtown theaters, had been largely off-limits to the lower classes. Vsevolod Meyerhold, director since 1922 of the Teatr Revolyutsii (Revolution Theatre) in Moscow (as well as Erwin Piscator in Berlin) was among the first theatrical directors to convert to agit-prop theater, theater less focused on bourgeois issues and more focused on ideological issues, and a theater that shunned the deep thinking of Chekhov in favor of exuberant spectacle. At the same time, itinerant agit-prop theater collectives like the Sinyaya Bluza/ Blue Blouse, established in 1923 in Moscow by Boris Yuzhanin, invented the \"living newspaper\", in which the performers would turn the act of reading the news into a circus-like spectacle with singers, clowns and acrobats. The agit-prop movement inevitably pervaded the film industry.\n\nThe civil war against the Mensheviks largely ended in 1920, but Russia had lost Poland, Estonia, Finland, Latvia and Lithuania (which had all declared independence) and a famine devastated the Volga-Ural regions in 1921-22, killing millions.\n\nAt the end of 1922 the Soviet Union was born, a federation of four \"soviet\" (i.e. communist) republics: Russia, Transcaucasia (which in 1936 split into Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia), Ukraine and Belarus. If the Russian Empire had been a melting pot of ethnic groups and religions, the Soviet Union was even more so: it included Jews, Germans, Poles, Ukrainians, Tatars, Chechens, Armenians, Fins, Baltic people, gypsies... It had Orthodox Christians, Catholics and Muslims.\n\nBoth the Reds and the Whites were guilty of widespread terror during the civil war. By the end of 1919, with the White armies defeated on all fronts, it became clear that the Bolsheviks were winning the Civil War. Russian aristocrats and wealthy families fled Russia for the West. The exodus escalated in 1920 withe the rout of the VSYuR or Vooruzhyonniye Sily Yuga Rossii (Armed Forces of South Russia) in Crimea (the last stronghold of the Whites in the south). Thousands of Russians, both soldiers and civilians, fled from the Black Sea ports for Istanbul (with famous scenes of panic in Novorossiysk, east of Crimea) on ships that were also Italian, British and French. Istanbul's population swelled with the Russian families who, in the old days, had fought the Ottomans, but then most of them scattered around the world. In 1922 the Bolsheviks conquered the Far East, the last major pocket of Menshevik resistance, causing another exodus, this time towards Manchuria in neighboring China, at that time controlled by warlords. Harbin soon boasted the largest population of Russians outside Russia. Despite the massive suffering of the Russian people during World War I (1914-17), the revolution (1917) and the civil war (1917-23), relatively few intellectuals fled Russia for western Europe: Diaghilev had lived in France since 1909 for merely business reasons, Stravinsky, who had been commuting with France since 1910 (the premiere of \"L'Oiseau de Feu/ The Firebird\"), followed him for good in 1914. The writer Aleksei Tolstoy left in 1918. Merezhkovsky, the novelist Aleksandr Kuprin and the poet Zinaida Gippius emigrated in 1919 (Vladimir Nabokov's family also emigrated in 1919); the poet Konstantin Balmont and the novelist Ivan Bunin in 1920; the opera singer Feodor Chaliapin in 1921; the poets Vladislav Khodasevich, Marina Tsvetaeva, and Georgy Ivanov in 1922; the poet Vyacheslav Ivanov in 1924. The futurist painter Aleksandra Ekster emigrated to France in 1924. Russian ballet was decimated: ballet was an aristocratic art form, not exactly the preferred art form under a communism regime. It had already lost the dancers lured by Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in Paris, like Mikhail Fokin/ Michel Fokine, Anna Pavlova and Vaslav Nijinsky, and after 1917 Saint Petersburg's imperial theatres lost about half of their dancers, including Tamara Karsavina in 1918, Mathilde Kschessinska in 1920, Olga Preobrajenska in 1921 and Georgiy Balanchivadze, who became famous as George Balanchine in Paris in 1924. Russian ballet was saved only by commissar Anatoly Lunacharsky. The Communist Revolution drove almost the entire Russian film industry into exile. In 1918 Drankov fled to Ukraine, then to Istanbul, and then to the USA. Vera Karalli moved to France in 1918, and Mozhukhin in 1919 (where he became Ivan Mosjoukine). Vera Kholodnaia left for the Crimea, controlled by the Mensheviks, but died in 1919 of the \"Spanish flu\" (she was only 25). In 1920 Wladyslaw Starewicz moved to France and became Vladislav Starevich. Vera Baranovskaya left in 1928.\n\nHowever, the visual artists and the writers, for the most part, remained in Russia.\n\nThe artistic avantgarde had not been politicized before 1917, but because it had consistently provoked the bourgeoisie and attacked elitist art, it was naturally adopted by the Bolshevik regime. In fact, it rapibly became the official art of the communist revolution, with a little bit of ideological tweaking: the old conceptual approach was slowly but steadily transformed into a materialistic approach which aimed at making art first a propaganda tool and then a productive sector. For a couple of years the artists had free rein.\n\nThe avantgardes (futurists, formalists and constructivists) prospered in a symbiotic relationship with the Bolshevik regime. The Futurists, reacting to Symbolism, advocated a strict alignment with contemporary reality. Hyperbolic, declamatory, subversive, vehemently and rigidly materialistic, Futurism briefly catapulted Soviet culture to the forefront of European research before it was rudely repressed. Formalism unmasked the essence of the work of art, fiction and convention, the product of artifice and estrangement. Constructivism put forward a synthesis of art, ideology and technology.\n\nIn 1919 Chagall inaugurated in Vitebsk a Vitebskoye Khudozhestvennoye Uchilishche (PeopleÂs Art School). In 1920 MalevichÂs pupil El Lissitzky staged Matyushin's opera \"Pobeda nad Solntsem/ Victory over the Sun\" with human actors replaced by electrical robots. Soyuz Molodyozhi was resurrected for a big exhibition of all the avantgarde at the Hermitage in 1919. The futurists collaborated with the Proletkult. For example, El Lissitzky crafted the Bolshevik propaganda poster \"Klinom Krasnym Bey Belykh/ Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge\" (1919). In 1920 Tatlin designed a monument to the Third International (to the \"Comintern\"), a high-rise revolving tower. The tower was never built, but the designs were published in Germany and the unbuilt tower soon became the recognizable icon of Constructivism. In 1920 Chagall invited Malevich at Vitebsk, and Malevich created an art community devoted to his Suprematist art called UNOVIS, an acronym for Utverditeli Novogo Iskusstva (The Champions of the New Art). The civil war was still raging. Constructivism, led by Tatlin, Alexandr Rodchenko and El Lissitzky, was the leading movement of the 1920s, when the political and military situation stabilized. Before it had its name, Constructivism was the subject of theoretical discussions between 1920 and 1922 at Moscow's Institut Khudozhestvennoy Kultury (Institute of Artistic Culture), known as InKhUK, inaugurated in March 1920 by Kandinsky. The Jewish sculptor Naum \"Gabo\" Pevzner, who had studied in Europe, wrote the \"Realisticheskii Manifest/ Realistic Manifesto\" in 1920. Constructivists also collaborated with the Formalists of Viktor Shklovsky. Constructivism also spilled over into theater: both Vsevolod Meyerhold and Alexander Tairov (another influential theatre director, who had established the Kamerny Theatre in 1914) employed Constructivist artists to design their stage sets. But the spirit of INKhUK changed as it came to be dominated by the theory of Osip Brik, Productivism, according to which artists should contribute to industrial production. Brik was the ultimate Marxist: he claimed that authors were mere vehicles for society's trends. It was society, not the artist, that produced the artworks. The artist was merely the \"worker\" building the artwork. However, a trilingual magazine (in Russian, French and German) called Veshch-Gegenstand-Objet, edited by El Lissitzky and Ilya Ehrenburg and published in Berlin in 1922, spread the tenents of Constructivism to the rest of Europe, as did the Erste Russische Kunstausstellung (First Russian Art Exhibition) organized by Lissitzky in Berlin in 1922. But the old avantgarde quickly fell out of touch with the new cultural atmosphere: Kandinsky left Russia for the Bauhaus in Germany in 1921 (replaced at InKhUK by Rodchenko), Chagall left for Paris in 1922 (replaced in Vitebsk by Malevich), Gabo emigrated to Berlin in 1922. In 1923 the Constructivists formed the Levy Front Iskusstv (Left Front of the Arts), whose magazine LEF promoted new art forms like photomontage, photography and cinema, all of them considered more significant for the future than easel painting.\n\nWhen Iosif Stalin (a Georgian born Ioseb Jughashvili) rose to power in 1924, the tightening of the screw intensified. First of all, Stalin had no passion for abstract art: he wanted artists to glorify real people and real events, i.e. figurative art, not abstract art. The Constructivists' main political mentor had been Leon Trotsky: it didn't help that he was expelled from the Politburo in 1926 and from the Communist Party in 1927. And then in 1932 \"sotsrealizm\" (\"socialist realism\") became the de-facto law of the land.\n\nNonetheless the 1920s were glory days for Russian poetry and theater. Among the groundbreaking poetry collections of the time were: Nikolay Gumilyov's \"Ognennyj Stolp/ Column of Fire\" (1921), Vladislav Khodasevich's \"Tyazhelaya Lira/ Heavy Lyre\" (1922), Anna Akhmatova's \"Anno Domini MCMXXI\" (1922), Velemir Khlebnikov's last collections before his untimely death in 1922, Nicolaj Klyuev's long poems \"Mat Subbota/ Mother Sabbath\" (1922) and \"Pogorelshchina/ Burned Ruins\" (1926), Osip Mandelstam's \"Grifelnaya Oda/ Slate Pencil Ode\" (1923), Maximilian Voloshin's \"Putyami Kaina/ The Ways Of Cain\" (1923), Boris Pasternak's \"Temy i Variatsii/ Themes and Variations\" (1923), Sergei Yesenin's \"Moskva Kabatskaya/ Moscow of the Taverns\" (1924), and, in exile, Marina Tsvetaeva/ Cvetaeva's \"Poema Kontsa/ Poem of the End\" (1924). Russia theater produced: Velemir Khlebnikov's verse drama \"Zangezi\" (1922), Nikolaj Erdman's \"Samoubiitsa/ Suicide\" (1925), Daniil Yuvachev \"Kharms\"'s \"Elizaveta Bam \" (1927), Vladimir Mayakovsky's \"Klop/ Bedbug/ Cimice\" (1928), Mikhail Bulgakov's \"Dni Turbinykh/ The Days of the Turbins\" (1925), whose premiere was directed by Konstantin Stanislavsky in person, and \"Zoikina Kvartira/ Zoyka's Apartment\" (1926), whose premiere was directed by another giant of Russian theater, Aleksey Popov, etc. The novel contributed Aleksei Tolstoy's \"Aelita\" (1922), written while he was in exile, Evgeny Zamyatin's \"My/ We\" (1924), the inspiration for many dystopian novels to come, Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky's \"Quadraturin\" (1926), Leonid Leonov's \"Vor/ The Thief\" (1927), Yury Olesha's \"Zavist/ Envy\" (1927), Yury Tynjanov/ Tynyanov/ Tynianov's \"Smert Vazir-Muhta/ Death of the Vazir-Mukhtar\" (1928), etc. Mikhail Sholokhov began publishing in 1928 his epic novel \"Tikhii Don/ And Quiet Flows the Don\" (completed in 1940). It wasn't clear that Russia literature had in any way slowed down since the age of Dostoevsky, Tolstoy and Chekhov. As for music, Sergei Prokofev was reaching the peak of his maturity and would remain Russia's most respected composer until his death in 1953, while a new talent emerged that would dominate Soviet classical music for the next half century: Dmitri Shostakovich, whose first symphony premiered in 1926.\n\nIndirectly, the communist dictatorship meant a breath of fresh air also for Russian cinema that until then had mostly relied on literary adaptations and stereotypical stories. The cultural vibrancy of the 1920s fostered the development of cinema as an autonomous art. Open shows were held in all cities, small theaters proliferated, and it all prospered under the banner of populism (resulting in a revaluation of circus, pantomime, musichall). Influenced by the artistic avant-gardes and Griffith's cinema, Soviet filmmakers gained awareness of a film language based on montage, and montage became the password for all filmmakers of that generation. The montage technique meant a significant \"engineering\" of art: the construction of a work of art simulated the assembly of an industrial machine. The concept of \"engineering art\" was as dear to futurism as it was to Marxist-inspired materialism. Montage also met the practical needs of early Soviet filmmakers, who, by cutting and cropping, could make up for their lack of means (especially film). Soviet cinema decisively separated cinematic spacetime from real spacetime and the object from its cinematic representation (which can be multiple for the same object at the same instant-point depending on angle, background, etc.).\n\nLenin recognized the propaganda and didactic value of the medium, and therefore in 1922 directed for the industry to be restructured. This caused a reorientation of films towards realism, away from the lifestyle and values of the bourgeoisie.\n\nIn 1922 a wind of change was sweeping across the film industry. The two cultural poles, Moscow (the new capital since 1918) and Saint Petersburg (the old capital, briefly called Petrograd and soon to be renamed Leningrad) witnessed parallel cinematic revolutions. In the new capital, a Polish Jew born David Kaufman who used the pseudonym Dziga Vertov had learned montage technique while working on the Soviet newsreel \"Kinonedelia\" (for which he had to collate scraps of footage coming from the fronts of the civil war). In 1922 Vertov, his wife Elizaveta Svilova and his brother Mikhail Kaufman began to release their \"Kino-Pravda\" (cine-truth) newsreels, which they felt was a better way to employ the cinematic medium than making up dramatic or comic fiction. They made 23 of them until 1925. Vertov's ebullient manifesto ÂWeÂ in the first issue of the magazine Kino-Fot hailed the arrival of Âthe perfect electric manÂ and advocated \"kinoglaz\" (cinema-eye): \"Hurrah for the poetry of machines, propelled and driving; the poetry of levers, wheels and wings of steel; the iron cry of movements, the blinding grimaces of red-hot streams.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in the old capital of Saint Petersburg in the same year (1922) four intellectuals (Leonid Trauberg, Grigorij Kozincev, Sergei Yutkevich and Georgii Kryzhitskii) published the \"Eccentrism Manifesto\". The foursome had created a theater workshop called \"Fabrika Ekstsentricheskogo Aktera/ Factory of the Eccentric ActorÂ or FEKS. In a language reminiscent of the Italian futurists, FEKS advocated a provocative multimedia art, contrasting with the stern aesthetic of Meyerhold's acting workshop. Their first performance announced: ÂEccentrism presents: operetta, melodrama, farce, movies, circuses, variety, puppetry in a single performance!Â\n\nIn 1923 Sergej Eisenstein, who had worked in the Moscow Proletkult and assisted Vsevolod Meyerhold in theater, published the essay \"The Montage of Attractions\" (1923) in the magazine LEF (Levy Front Iskusstv/ Left Front of the Arts), just founded by futurist writers Osip Brik and Vladimir Mayakovsky.\n\nIn 1924 Sergei Eisenstein and Lev Kuleshov formed in Moscow the Assotsiatsiia Rabotnikov Revoliutsionnoi Kinematografi (Association of Revolutionary Cinematography) or ARRK, with the mission of strengthen the ideological element of cinema. Its manifesto claimed that cinema was \"the strongest weapon in the fight for a communist culture.\" Among those who joined it in the following years were: Dziga Vertov, Vsevolod Pudovkin, Grigory Kozintsev, Leonid Trauberg, Sergei Yutkevich, Fridrick Ermler, Esfir Shub. They rejected the view of film as entertainment. That was bourgeoisie cinema. Revolutionary cinema had a mission to educate and renovate the society of workers and peasants. They were inspired and influenced by Mayakovsky's poems, Meyerhold's theater and the Proletcult movement. In their attempt to severe all ties with the culture of pre-revolutionary Russia, they embraced new techniques of filmmaking, notably montage. Gardin (the rare director from the czarist era who had not emigrated and who was now in charge of the Gosudarstvennaia Shkola Kinematografii, the state film school later better known as VGIK, Vsesojuznyj Gosudarstvyennyy Institut Kinematografii) lectured on montage in 1919 describing it as a pillar of cinematic art, and Lev Kuleshov, who heard it, launched into wild experiments of montage and discovered that the effect of a montage sequence was due to juxtaposition of the elements not to the content of the elements themselves. Gardin also experimented with mixing theater and cinema in his adaptation of a Jack London novel, Zheleznaya Pyata/ The Iron Heel (1919). Kuleshov, Vertov and Eisenstein led collectives that attempted to get rid of the linear plot especially one that revolves around a protagonist, preferring stories that have masses as protagonists, and replacing the plot with the \"montage of attractions\" as de facto Kozintsev and Trauberg had done in their influential 1922 staging of Nikolai Gogol's play \"Marriage\" (which mixed actors and projections).\n\nIn 1924 Lenin was already dead and Stalin quickly consolidated his power, marginalizing both the left, that advocated permanent revolution, led by Leon Trotsky (expelled from the politburo in 1926 and assassinated in 1940), and the right, that had launched the pseudo-capitalist New Economic Policy, led by Nikolai Bukharin (expelled from the politburo in 1929 and executed in 1938). Having witnessed the failure of communist insurrections around Europe, Stalin proclaimed the doctrine of \"Socialism in one Country\".\n\nThis was the political and cultural background that led to futurism-influenced masterpieces such as: Sergej Eisenstein's Stachka/ Strike (1925), with almost surrealist imagery, and Bronenossets Potyomkin/ Battleship Potemkin (1925), with a tragic symphonic counterpoint between Edmund Meisel's music and Eduard Tisse's cinematography; Lev Kuleshov's Luc Smerti/ Death Ray (1925); Vsevolod Pudovkin's Mat/ Mother (1926), adapted by Nathan Zarkhi from Gorky's novel and starring Vera Baranovskaya, and Potomok Chingiskhana/ The Heir to Genghis Khan/ Storm over Asia (1928), which feels like a Brecht-ian apologue, dressed with tropes of both the western movie and the horror movie; Oleksandr Dovzenko's Zvenigora (1928), a Ukrainianian historical epic that merged folklore and avantgarde, photographed by Boris Zavelev, and Arsenal (1929) a Ukrainian revolutionary drama, photographed by Danylo Demutsky; and Dziga Vertov's documentary extravaganza Celovek s Kinoapparatom/ Man with a Movie Camera (1929), which was also filmed in Ukraine and confirmed his status as the most radical avantgarde filmmaker, a film that is also a meta-film because it includes a documentary about making and projecting the film itself.\n\nLev Kuleshov, the other giant of montage with Eisenstein and Pudovkin, instead made movies influenced by the cinema of the USA, such as Neobychainiye Priklucheniya Mistera Vesta/Mister West (1924), photographed by Aleksandr Levitsky, and Po Zakonu/ By the Law (1926), scripted by the formalist Viktor Shklovsky. That genre peaked with Boris Barnet's lengthy spy comedy Miss Mend/ The Adventures of the Three Reporters (1926), co-directed with Fyodor Otsep and adapted from Marietta ShaginianÂs \"Mess Mend\", and Barnet's satirical farce Dom na Trubnoi/ House on Trubnaya Sq (1928), which is also the rare film about everyday's life in the city.\n\nNote that foreign movies had returned to Russia during the New Economic Policy (NEP), and in fact in the mid-1920s most box-office revenue still came from foreign movies.\n\nThe FEKS group of Saint Petersburg loved the eccentric, as manifested in the circus and the vaudeville, somewhere between surrealism and Dada. Grigorij Kozincev launched FEKS in movie theaters with Pokhozhdeniya Oktyabriny/ The Adventures of Oktyabrina (1924, lost), co-directed with Leonid Trauberg, and even Kuleshov's Neobichainje Prikliucheniya Mistera Vesta v strane bolshevikov/ The Extraordinary Adventures of Mr West in the Land of the Bolsheviks (1924) embodied many of the FEKS principles. Sergei Yutkevich (Sergej Jutkevic) made Kruzheva/ Lace (1928). Kozincev and Trauberg made several films blessed by Andrei Moskvin's cinematography, notably Chyortovo Koleso/ The Devil's Wheel (1926), that also turned Lyudmila Semyonova into a star, and Novyj Vavilon/ New Babylon (1929), with music by Dmitri Shostakovich (his first film score ever) and starring Sergei Gerasimov.\n\nMeyerhold's pupil Nikolay Okhlopkov made the grotesque satire Prodannyy Appetit/ The Sale of an Appetite (1928), scripted by Nikolai Erdman, in which a starving unemployed driver sells his stomach to a wealthy capitalist who has ruined his stomach by eating too much.\n\nLev Kuleshov's \"American\" style and the eccentric style of FEKS influenced the commercial movies of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nAlexander Sanin (born Alexander Shoenberg), a theatrical actor under Stanislavski, directed the rural fresco Polikuska (1919), photographed by Yuri Zhelyabuzhsky, yet another Lev Tolstoy adaptation, which became a worldwide hit, starring another famous theatrical actor, Ivan Moskvin.\n\nGeorgian pioneer Ivan Perestiani made the blockbuster Tsiteli Eshmakunebi/ Krasnie Diavolyata/ Little Red Devils (1923), adapted from Pavel Bliakhin's novel, a western-inspired war movie set during the Civil War, a natural link between czarist cinema and socialist realism, and Soviet cinema's second blockbuster.\n\nHamo Beknazarian/ Bek-Nazarov made in Armenia the visually arresting Tune Hrabkhi Vra/ Dom na Vulkane/ House on the Volcano (1928), about a strike of oil workers, photographed by Aleksandr Galperin.\n\nThe biggest hit of early Soviet cinema was Jakov Protazanov's sci-fi comedy Aelita (1924), adapted from Aleksey Tolstoy's novel by Fyodor Otsep, which basically transported the communist revolution to Mars, starring Yuliya Solntseva as the queen of Mars, Igor Ilyinsky (Meyerhold's favorite actor) as the amateur detective, and Nikolai Tseretelli as an engineer, but more notable for the constructivist costumes and sets, designed, respectively, by Viktor Simov and Alexandra Exter.\n\nThe traditionalist Yuri Zhelyabuzhsky directed the comedy Papirosnitsa ot Mosselproma/ The Cigarette Girl from Mosselprom (1924), whose three stars were borrowed from Aelita (Ilyinsky, Solntseva and Tseretelli), and a famous adaptation, Kollezhskiy Registrator/ The Collegiate Registrar (1925), from Aleksandr PushkinÂs novella \"Stantsionnyi Smotritel/ The Stationmaster\", starring Ivan Moskvin and Vera Malinovskaya.\n\nSome filmmakers opposed to FEKS a more austere style, like Fridrick Ermler, co-founder of KEM (Experimental Cinema Workshop), a group influenced by Meyerhold's theater, proponent of psychological realism in films such as Katka Bumazhnyj Ranet/ Katka's Reinette Apples (1926) and Oblomok Imperii/ Fragment of an Empire (1929), the latter with grandiose sets designed by Evgenii Enei and starring Fyodor Nikitin.\n\nTwo of the most original films were made by relative outsiders: Olga Preobrazhenskaya's Baby Ryazanskie/ Women of Ryazan (1927), on the condition of women in the countryside, and Abram Room's tragicomic Tretya Meshchanskaya/ Bed and Sofa (1927), written by Lev Kuleshov and Viktor Shklovsky, starring Lyudmila Semyonova. Room also made two films influenced by his studies with Vsevolod Meyerhold and by constructivist architecture: Prividenje Kotoroe ne Vozvrashchaetsya/ The Ghost that never Returns (1929), and Strogis Junosa/ A Strict Young Man (1934), a collaboration with novelist Yury Olesha that aimed at creating a work of both cinema and literature (and that was promptly banned by the authorities).\n\nOpposed to both futurists, FEKS and realists, a group led by Yevgeni Chervyakov opted for \"lyrical\" cinema. Chervyakov called his Jean Epstein-influenced Devushka s Dalekoi Reki/ Girl from the Distant River (1928) a \"kinopoema\", a cinematic poem. He co-directed with Gardin the sentimental Poet i Tsar/ The Poet and the Tsar (1927) about Pushkin's last days.\n\nMoscow raised an important school of animation under the supervision of Aleksandr Bushkin since 1922. Initially devoted to short political cartoons that were simply extensions of the caricatural comics published in the newspaper Pravda, like the one-reel Sovetskie Igrushki/ Soviet Toys (1924), directed by Dziga Vertov and drawn by Ivan Beliakov and Aleksandr Ivanov, it soon expanded to fiction. In fact, Bushkin's group split into two factions: IVVOSTON, gathered around Ivan Ivanov-Vano (the man who was destined to dominate Soviet animation for decades), and the other one comprising Jewish sisters Valentina and Zinaida Brumberg and siblings Nikolai and Olga Khodatayev. The Brumbergs made the exotic and constructivist 50-minute Kitai v Ogne/ China Aflame (1925), and then collaborated with the Khodatayevs for Samoedskii Malchik/ Eskimo Boy (1928). Both groups experimented in combining synchronized music and cartoon action. Ivanov-Vano and the Brumbergs worked together on the 20-minute Czar Durandai (1934), that synchronized the action with music by Dmitri Shostakovich (this is the cartoon that Frank Lloyd Wright later showed to Disney as the ideal fusion of design and music, just before Disney made Fantasia). Independently, Yuri Zhelyabuzhsky realized the seven-minute Katok/ The Skating Rink (1927), scripted by Nikolai Bartram (founder of Moscow's National Toy Museum), and Prikljuchenija Bolvashki/ Bolvashka's Adventures (1927), a pioneering short that combined live action and stop-motion animation.\n\nIn 1923 Lenin launched a policy of \"korenizatsiia\" (\"nativization\") to win over the various nationalities of the Soviet Union. The idea was that imperial Russia was just that, i.e. an empire that forced Russian culture and language on non-Russian peoples, whereas communist Russia was tolerant and respectful of national identities. Ironically, this policy had been originally conceived by a young Stalin (who was a Georgian, not a Russian, born Iosif Jughashvili) when he lived abroad in his pamphlet \"Marksizm i Natsionalniy Vopros/ Marxism and the National Question\" (1913). For example, Ukrainian schools were free to teach in the Ukrainian language. Korenizatsia encouraged intellectuals of the various nationalities to express themselves in experimental and innovative ways. For example, composers such as Aram Khachaturian (Armenia), later famous for the ballet music \"Gayane\" (1942), and Borys Lyatoshinsky (Ukraine), later a distinguished symphonist, grew up in that atmosphere. The Soviet Union experienced a sort of \"cultural revolution\" during the late 1920s in which Russian cultural heritage was constantly under attack as representative of the old czarist mindset. For example, ancient churches were demolished.\n\nGeorgian theater director Kote Marjanishvili, the Stanislavski of Georgia, adapted Irish novelist Ethel Lilian Voynich's \"The Gadfly\" (1897) into Krazana/ Ovod/ The Gadfly (1926), the film that turned Georgian actress Nato Vachnadze into a star (later the wife of Nikoloz Shengelaia and the mother of Giorgi and Eldar Shengelaia). Early Georgian films also include Nikoloz Shengelaia's Eliso (1928), the rare film about a Muslim heroine, Kote Miqaberidze's political satire Chemi Bebia/ Moia babushka/ My Grandmother (1929), scripted by Giorgi Mdivani and Siko Dolidze (but banned until 1976), and Davit Rondeli's Ugubziara (1930), from another Giorgi Mdivani screenplay.\n\nUkraine was a separate story. The VUFKU invited talents (writers, actors, artists) from both the Soviet Union and other countries and created a cosmopolitan atmosphere. At the peak, in 1927, VUFKU produced 39% of all Soviet films. It also established a film university (1924) that begin to graduate students in 1927. It is not a coincidence that Ukrainian cinema became more sophisticated in that year. Initially, its films were mostly of the revolutionary propaganda kind. In 1927 they adopted the language of the avantgarde and became more psychological. The theatre director Les Kurbas, who in 1922 had founded the experimental Berezil Theatre in Kharkiv and hired the constructivist painter Vadym Meller to design sets, staging a multimedia production of Upton Sinclair's novel \"Jimmie Higgins\" with projections of newsreels (1922), directed Arsenaltsi/ Armory Men (1925), a film influenced by both expressionism and constructivism that employed visual tricks like dividing the screen horizontally into two screens. The novelist Solomon Lazurin wrote the screenplays for three influential films: Borotba Veletniv/ The Struggle of the Giants (1926), directed by Viktor Turin, the rare Soviet filmmaker who had studied in the USA (at the MIT) and worked in Hollywood (actor and screenwriter), Order na Arest/ Arrest Warrant (1926), directed by Heorhii Tasin, whose Nichnyi Viznyk/ The Night Coachman (1928) would later cause the authorities to launch a crusade against Âpsychological insightÂ, and Dva Dni/ Two Days (1927), directed by Heorhii Stabovyi (aka Georgiy Stabovy) with photography by Danylo Demutsky and sets designed by German artist Heinrich Beisenherz (disguised as Georgi Bayzengerts). Mykola Shpykovskyi specialized in banned films, notably the 44-minute Khlib/ Bread (1929), photographed by Oleksii Pankratiev, which is almost a twin companion to Dovzhenko's Earth, and the satirical road-movie Shkurnyk/ Self-Seeker (1929), adapted from Vadym Okhremenko's novella \"Tsybala\" (both rediscovered only in the 1990s). The sculptor Ivan Kavaleridze made the most deliriously constructivist film: Zlyva/ Downpour (1929, banned and then lost). Then there were Oleksandr Dovzenko's masterpieces, photographed by Danylo Demutskii, and Vertov too made Celovek s Kinoapparatom/ Man with a Movie Camera (1929) in Ukraine. In general, Moscow was losing control of Ukrainian culture. The philosopher Mykola Khvylovyi, the founder of Vilna Akademia Proletarskoi LITEratury (Free Academy of Proletarian Literature) or VAPLITE in Kharkiv in 1926, was preaching a cultural Ukrainian identity separate from the Russian one, and even superior to it: he thought that Ukraine was naturally placed to become the center of Eurasian civilization. Stalin's regime took action: VUFKU lost its independence and was terminated in 1930. Then Stalin engineered the \"Holodomor\", the Ukrainian Famine of 1932-33 that killed millions of Ukrainians. At the same time many Ukrainian intellectuals were arrested, deported and executed. For example, Demutskii was repeatedly arrested and exiled. Khvylovy committed suicide in 1933.\n\nIn the years after 1917 agit-prop shorts proliferated as well as shorts glorifying collective work. Many young people were drawn to the new art that was suddenly so available. The documentary also dealt with historical reconstruction, such as Padeniye dinastii Romanovykh/ Fall of the Romanov Dynasty (1927) made by Jewish female director Esfir Shub (who had learned her trade by altering for the communists the films from capitalist countries to make them ideologically aligned with Marxism-Leninism), with life in Caucasian villages such as Mikhail Kalatozov's Sol Svanetii/ Salt for Svanetia (1930), with the colonization of Siberia, such as Viktor Turin's hour-long Turksib/ The Steel Road (1929).\n\nA major ideological shift took place in Soviet cinema. In the West, cinema was conceived as entertainment (although it implicitly a manifested the moral values of Christian European societies). In the Soviet Union, cinema acquired the role of communication and education between the top and the bottom of the nation. Moreover, the revolutionary process invested the very instrument of communication itself: the work of the avantgarde filmmakers ultimately consisted precisely in the materialist refounding of the collective imagination, a transformation that could be accomplished through a new ordering of film practice. The exposition of the world according to proletarian values required a different language than the one adopted by bourgeois cinema.\n\nSoviet cinema had its own specific task within the arts: to affirm the rightness of the society born of the Bolshevik revolution.\n\nSummarizing, Soviet cinema arose from the confluence of theatrical contributions (futurism), revolutionary instances (agitprop), and technical innovations (montage). In spite of the first component, it always kept well away from theatrical schemes, conceiving cinema from the very beginning as an art based on its own mechanisms completely unrelated to theater. The second component, on the other hand, had great prominence both in the choice of subjects (which had to forcibly be either critique of the bourgeoisie, capitalism, imperialism, or exaltation of the Revolution, the Soviet Union, and socialism) and in the spirit of the filmmakers (at first strongly innovative, then satirical, then bureaucratic, then propagandistic, depending on political developments). The third component resulted in an extreme modernity of the films of the time, at the antipodes from the antiquated European production.\n\nCinema as collective work, as a function of technique and mass art, fit perfectly in Lenin's directives, which based the construction of socialism on the pillars of electricity and soviet. The enthusiasm aroused in the avant-garde by the Bolshevik victory and which had received new impetus from the New Political Economy (1921) was extinguished when Stalin, having disbanded the intellectual movements, institutionalized socialist realism as the only permissible aesthetic criterion. Art, understood in a purely pedagogical sense, was crushed by bureaucracy. World War II then did the rest. The social retraining of the intellectual is therefore more evident in cinema than in the other arts.\n\nEurasianism and other Utopias\n\nMarxism was not the only ideology that aimed at making the Russian people the revolutionaries of the world. Anti-European Slavophile sentiment had been a recurring phenomenon in Russian culture. Philosophers and historians had often written about the exceptionalism of Russia and about the evils of European civilization. It was a crescendo, via Nikolay DanilevskyÂs book ÂRossiya i Yevropa/ Russia and EuropeÂ (1869) and Konstantin LeontievÂs book ÂVostok, Rossiya i Slavyanstvo/ The East, Russia, and SlavdomÂ (1886) and Vladimir LamanskyÂs book ÂTri mira Aziisko-evropeiskogo Materika/ Three Worlds of the Asian-European ContinentÂ (1892), a sentiment that peaked just after the Bolshevik revolution in a movement later known as Eurasianism that originated among the Russian diaspora in Europe. Its founders were aristocratic exiles who had left Russia after 1919. The linguist Nikolai Trubetskoy set in motion the movement when, in Sofia, he published ÂYevropa i Chelovechestvo / Europe and MankindÂ. This was followed in 1921 (again in Sofia) by a collection of essays titled ÂIskhod k Vostoku/ Exodus to the EastÂ, whose authors were Trubetskoi, geographer Pyotr Savitsky, art historian Pierre Souvtchinsky and philosopher Georges Florovsky. Their theory was that Russia does not belong to European civilization. It belongs instead to the entirely different civilization of the steppe people. The Russian people are related the Turkic and Mongol tribes that emanated from Central Asia, not to the French or the Germans. When the Mongols invaded Russia, they didnÂt colonize the Russians: they saved the Russians from Western influence. Pyotr Savitsky, a strong believer that geography shapes political systems (ÂmestorazvitiyeÂ or ÂtopogenesisÂ), explained in ÂDva Mira/ Two WorldsÂ (1922) that the peoples of the Eurasian steppes (because of their climate, vegetation and geography) shared a preference for traditional values and collective life whereas the ÂoceanicÂ civilization (Greeks, Romans, Renaissance, Napoleon, English Empire) loves progress and individualism. In particular, the Eurasian condition favors centralized authoritarian rule, not liberal democracy. Trubetskoy and fellow linguist Roman Jakobson (who had fled Russia for Prague in 1920) reached the same conclusion by studying languages: cultures should be classified by geography, not history. This view represented a major denial of centuries of attempts by Russian czars to become more ÂEuropeanÂ, to be accepted in the family of European peoples and in the Christian world. The Eurasianist implicitly believed that Russia had not only a mission to ÂcivilizeÂ the land to the east, but also that the Western civilization was in decline, a belief perhaps reinforced by the publication in Germany of the first volume of Oswald Spengler's ÂDer Untergang des Abendlandes/ The Decline of the WestÂ in 1918. The relationship of Eurasianism with Communism was complicated. On one hand the Eurasianists welcomed a dictatorship that divided Russia from Europe and affirmed the exceptional nature of Russia. On the other hand they opposed the crackdown on religion, believing in a messianic mission for the Orthodox Church (and, being aristocrats, they didnÂt like LeninÂs ideas on private property). They welcomed Bolshevism (the anti-European revolution) but not Communism (the European philosophy). They briefly tried to spread their theories into Russia as an alternative to both liberal capitalism and Marxism-Leninism, but failed. Nonetheless they maintained a network of activists in the capitals of Europe (Prague, Vienna, Paris, Berlin, London) from which they spread their anti-European credo. Trubetskoy, who had moved to Vienna in 1922, introduced the notion of ÂideocracyÂ in his essay ÂNaslediye Chingiskhana/ The Legacy of Genghis KhanÂ (1925), ideocracy being the alternative to both democracy and communism. The key point was an opposition to Western individualism, an old target of Slavophile thinking. The philosopher Vladimir Solovyov had spoken of \"vseedinstvo\" (ÂunityÂ) as the polar opposite of Western individualism and that concept was in turn an evolution of the Slavophile favorite term ÂsobornostÂ. Souvtchinsky (now known as Pierre) led the cell in Paris and the philosopher Lev Karsavin promoted Eurasianism in Paris between 1926 and 1928 with seminars titled ÂRussia and Europe\". Bolshevism itself was unconsciously influenced by that kind of old Slavophile and Eurasianist messianism (as Nikolai Berdyaev argued in his 1946 book ÂThe Russian IdeaÂ): that the Russian-centered Soviet Union could break with Western values and lead the world towards a utopia.\n\nRoman Jakobson, who had been a futurist poet and a friend of Mayakovsky and Malevich (publishing a collection split with Alexei Kruchenykh, ÂZaumnaya Gniga/ Transrational BoogÂ in 1915), went on to become one the founders of the Prague School of Linguistics, and became the most famous proponent of the \"structuralism\" pioneered by Ferdinand de Saussure.\n\nThe Eurasianists were also influenced by the futurist Nikolay Fyodorov, a philosopher who never published in his lifetime but whose writings were published after he died in 1903 in a book titled ÂFilosofiya Obshchego Dela/ Philosophy of the Common TaskÂ. Fyodorov believed that humankind should strive to achieve immortality and even resurrection of the dead. His utopian philosophy came to be called ÂCosmismÂ.\n\nLittle noticed at the time, the geochemist Vladimir Vernadsky published the book ÂBiosfera/ The BiosphereÂ (1926), which popularized a term first used by the Austrian geologist Eduard Suess in 1875, a stage of the EarthÂs history in which life (instead of inert matter) shapes geology. In the 1930s he also popularized the ÂnoosphereÂ, a term introduced in 1922 by the French theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, the noosphere being the new state of the biosphere when ÂthoughtÂ has evolved out of unintelligent matter and comes to dominate the Earth, the third phase after the geosphere and the biosphere. Indirectly, this was yet another form of utopian philosophy coming out of Russia.\n\nSoviet Cinema 1930s\n\nIn 1929 Stalin launched the \"Velikij Perelom/ Great Break\": rapid industrialization and collectivization of agriculture. In the next few years, the Soviet Union underwent a massive social and economic transformation, with the elimination of the kulaks, the rapid industrialization and the obsessions on party loyalty, patriotism and collective vigilance (and unmasking the counter-revolutionaries, traitors and saboteurs hiding within the nation). Increasingly, the program of social transformation was mandating party loyalty from scientists, engineers, intellectuals and artists. In order to achieve the communism paradise, the communists believed in the transformative power of scientific progress while regarding religion as pure superstition, an anti-social force. All the arts came under pressure to spread this message.\n\nAt the same time the Soviet \"futurists\" seemed to have reached the peak of montage technique and they were debating its future. At the same time the arrival of sound introduced a new element in the very idea of montage. It all colluded to create a creative crisis.\n\nAt the same time, in October 1929, Wall Street crushed and the capitalist world entered the \"Great Depression\". The communist dream didn't seem so far fetched.\n\nHowever, Stalin's forced collectivization, achieved through the creation of kolkhoz (collective farms), resulted in a series of famines, notably the \"Holodomor\" that killed milions in Ukraine in 1932-33 (started after a visit by Stalin's right-hand man Vyacheslav Molotov to Ukraine's the capital Kharkov). To make matters worse, in 1934 Stalin used a political assassination (of Sergey Kirov) as a pretext to start political \"purges\" that sent millions to Siberian gulags. The agency called NarodnÃ½ Komissariat Vnutrennih Del or NKVD (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs), i.e. the secret police, spread terror throughout the Soviet Union, particularly after Lavrenti Beria (a Georgian like Stalin) became its director in 1938. Beria, who had already presided over the brutal repression of an uprising in Georgia in 1924, was the brain behind the creation of the network of 500 gulags, and he personally tortured and assassinated his political rivals. It has been estimated that in 1938 alone the purges caused the deaths of almost two million people, including 940 thousand executions, 400 thousand perished in gulags and hundreds of thousands lost in deportations.\n\nAlso in 1934 a speech by Andrei Zhdanov at the national congress of writers instructed artists to follow the guidelines of socialist realism and popularized Stalin's view of the intellectual as the \"engineer of human souls\", a speech that ominously ended with the admonition to \"actively help to remold the mindset of people in the spirit of socialism, be in the front ranks of those who are fighting for a class-less socialist society.\" Given the political atmosphere, it was soon implied that any artist not complying with those guidelines could be deported to Siberia. Zhdanov was soon appointed to replace Kirov as boss of Leningrad and in 1935 presided over the deportation of 12,000 \"aristocrats\" and Trotskyists. In September 1938 Zhdanov became the head of the Otdel Agitatsii i Propagandy (Department for Agitation and Propaganda), which centralized control over the press, radio, television, theater, cinema and so on.\n\nAt the same time, the internal propaganda hailed the achievement of a miner called Alexei Stakhanov who had mined a record 102 tons of coal in less than six hours (1935), a message to all workers that they needed to mobilize to turn the Soviet Union into an industrial and military power. Show trials became commonplace, peaking in 1937. Even the head of the film industry, Boris Shumiatsky, was arrested, tried and executed (in 1938).\n\nMayakovsky killed himself in 1930, at the age of 37: an era had ended. In 1934 Mandelstam was arrested for insulting Stalin and condemned to internal exile (he died in 1938 while being transported to a gulag). The poet Nicolaj Klyuev was arrested and executed in 1937. There were new literary talents but it was not the right time to start a literary career. The late futurist poet Nikolaj Zabolotsky was able to publish his first poems, but was arrested in 1938 and deported to Siberia. Daniil Kharms's puppet play \"Tsirk Shardam/ \"The Shardam Circus\" (1935), another absurdist work, was not published until 1992. Andrei Platonov's important novels were all banned: \"Chevengur\" (1928) was banned until 1988, his dystopian \"Kotlovan/ Foundation Pit\" (1930) was banned until 1987 and his novella \"Dzhan/ Soul\" (1935) was not published in full until 1999. We will never know how many literary works were suppressed forever during those years.\n\nThe one sector that didn't suffer under Stalin was science. Russia in the 1930s boasted one of the greatest schools of Physics in the world: Lev Landau (who founded a great tradition of theoretical physics in Ukraine), Pavel Cherenkov, Igor Tamm, Ilya Frank, Pyotr Kapitsa, etc.\n\nThe import of foreign films, which had been very popular throughtout the Lenin era, all but stopped, and Soviet cinema became more insular and parochial. At the same time Stalin's increasingly paranoid censors"
