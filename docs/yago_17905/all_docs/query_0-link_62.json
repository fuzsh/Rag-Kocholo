        "text": "Although it does not seem so at first glance, perhaps the ideological changes in Soviet cinema - how, both directly and indirectly, in one's handwriting manifest the various political phases of a state mechanism that seeks to control cultural production in all aspects - can best be seen in the example of Grigori Kozincev, an author who very often managed to avoid a direct propaganda effect in his films.\n\nTogether with Leonid Trauberg, he founded FEKS, the Factory of the Eccentric Actor, so when he switched to film it was clear that Kozintsev wanted to transfer some of the unconventional, experimental strategies from the theater to the new medium. Moreover, it was precisely the film that was the most suitable, the most revolutionary form that could respond to the all-encompassing revolutionary enthusiasm of the new ideology, generation and state: both in the political and aesthetic sense, the avant-garde was almost the norm, not an incident or a procedure that was condemned to a narrow circle devotee.\n\nKozintsev's silent films are the product of such a constellation, a simultaneous delight in the artistic, autonomous possibilities of the cinematographic apparatus, as well as the scope of his creative intervention in reality itself, more precisely, his ideological redescription of the reality that unfolds right in front of you. The fact that, for example, the Devil's Wheel (Devil's Wheel, 1926) was dominated by this first segment, clearly speaks of the degree of signifier mobility allowed at that time: here, Kozintsev is almost not at all interested in the narrative of the redemption of a sailor, but triumphantly indulges in the atmosphere of the luna park where the action is set - therefore, the playfulness, 'acrobatics', vertigo of the film structure itself.\n\nŠinel (Šinjel, 1926) in certain moments even radicalized this Luddist setting, while in SVD (Družina veliko đelá, 1927) attention was refocused on the rich pictoriality of the frame faced with the demand of historical representation. In Novij Bavilon (New Babylon, 1929), on the other hand, avant-garde montage patterns were preserved because a 'serious' function was placed before them: they were an additional epistemological support in the staging of an indicative historical episode.\n\nTwo of Gogol's texts that were united in Shinel proved to be extremely adaptable to the poetics pushed by the youngest wing of the Soviet montage school: the writer's satire was transformed in one part into an ironic phantasmagoria, and in the other translated into a dark grotesque. Gogol is thus interpreted as a kind of announcement of Kafka, while Shinel owes its special atmosphere to the 'paradoxical' combination of form and content: the tendency towards aesthetic Luddism serves to emphasize precisely the narrowness, limitation, or hopelessness of the position in which Akakije Akakievich (Andrei Kostrychkin) found himself. .\n\nA 'spirited', humorous rhetoric is strategically used as a descriptive factor of oppression, which leads the film to a modernist insight into the impossibility of finding one's way within the bureaucratic and administrative machinery. This human slippage, dislocation from the hierarchical social design, equally causes an almost surrealistic and mournful tone, which is also the emotional trajectory marked by Šinel.\n\nIf with SVD the perspective shift began, then with Novij Bavilon there was a more precise contextualization of the 'eccentric' manuscript of Kozincev and Trauberg: the ideology was complemented by an interest in history, both in terms of the synaestic potential for its reconstruction, and when it comes to incorporating historical roots (and lessons) in legitimizing (communist) modernity.\n\nThis meant that New Babylon was the director's most consistent attempt to reconcile the necessity of a political message (as an obligatory orientation of a communist film) with the internal dynamics of a signifying practice that already by inertia tended towards the avant-garde exclusion of crude utilitarianism. The sought-after reconciliation, however, was only possible when the dialectical movement started was negative, when it was organized within a critical agenda of attacks on bourgeois and capitalist manners, morals and worldview, most often in the form of polemical juxtapositions and caricature, 'raw' humor.\n\nHowever, when it was necessary to establish the paradigmatic nature of the Paris Commune as an important point in the gradual realization of the communist 'eschaton', Kozintsev and Trauberg failed to employ their own imagination with equal force. Nevertheless, New Babylon ultimately appears as an ideologically undecided text due to the ambivalent position of the main character Jean (Pyotr Soboljewski), who never takes a decisive step towards adopting a revolutionary consciousness, who never definitively switches to the 'correct side': even if he takes taking into account the assumption that his portrayal is a consequence of the ruling opinion in Stalinist historiography about the insufficient support of the peasant classes to the Communards, the dramaturgical effect remains exceptional, \"protruding\", denaturalized, because such a solution not only contradicts political, but also narrative-melodramatic expectations.\n\nWith the complete takeover of the state apparatus by Stalin, the heroic period of Soviet cinema was quickly extinguished. Odna (Sama, 1931) is Kozintsev's adaptation to a new climate that does not suffer from deregulating synaesthetic excess, but nonetheless with intriguing and 'dubious' ideological implications: the bureaucratic mechanism at the beginning of the film is sketched as cold and inaccessible in its impersonal efficiency, while it is a symbol of commanding power concentrated in a disembodied voice - power is already depicted as alienated.\n\nThat's why a 'corrected', that is to say more humanized version followed: the Maksim trilogy - composed of the films Maksim's Youth (Maxim's Youth, 1935), Maksim's Awakening (Maxim's Return, 1937) and Vyborskaja storona (Vyborska strana, 1939) - offered a Stalinist social realism with a human face, in other words, the moment of the tightest political control was masked by a supposedly warm mimetic reworking of the story of a 'typical' hero of Soviet socialist progress.\n\nKozintsev and Trauberg wanted to profile, in the manner of a somewhat 'freer' social-realism, the Bolshevik hero, Maxim (Boris Chirkov), who will cross the path from an ordinary proletarian to a functionary: (political) education goes hand in hand with advancement in the party and state nomenclature which created an easily recognizable matrix about the 'rise' of the common man (a variant of the 'Soviet dream'), whereby the Trilogy can be taken as the embodiment of the populist inclination of the communist film of the time. Viborskaja storona testifies to how, as the Trilogy came to an end, political parameters were more dominant over cinematic ones: social-realism, even cultivated, is a stylistic tool for pacifying or eliminating the ideological confusion that tends to 'blur' the idealized projection.\n\nAfter the banning of the film Prostje ljudi (Ordinary people, 1945) and the termination of the partnership with Trauberg, Kozintsev had to wait for the easing of ideological pressure. And then he could already define himself as a classicist who deals exclusively with classic texts: Don Quixote (Don Quixote, 1956), Hamlet (Hamlet, 1964) and King Lear (King Lear, 1971) are the furthest Soviet film went in its to 'universalism'."
