        "text": "There is no Tarzan, no Bulldog Drummond, no Charlie Chan, Sophie Lang or Thin Man in the Russian cinema to return (or strike back or ride again) in new and greater adventures in the latest Soviet film, \"The Return of Maxim,\" for the Soviet film-makers are not frivolously inclined. They still are working, and probably will continue to work, on the assumption that pictures should have a purpose and a message. It bespeaks their serious attitude that Maxim should be their first recurring hero—Maxim, whose proletarian youth was studied by the camera two and a half years ago; Maxim, whose return to the Cameo last night has set off another vigorous, beautifully played, realistically stated drama of Russia in its incendiary years.\"The Return of Maxim\" is the second part of a trilogy which has succeeded admirably thus far in expressing the development of the Russian revolution in terms of the revolutionary development of one man. \"The Youth of Maxim\" found that man working in a factory, an essentially light-hearted cog in a ruthlessly cruel machine. He had a pre-war Russian's fatalistic acceptance of things: regarded his boss with awe, the Cossacks with fear and was not of a mind to do anything about either. Then a faulty machine claimed the life of one friend; the Cossacks rode down the workers' funeral procession; after the riot Maxim was in jail, his other friend was hanged. So was a revolutionist born.The sequel looks at him two years later—years of exile, imprisonment and escape, of cellar-meetings, plots and flight. Maxim is wary now, trained in the underground of revolution, an important worker among workers. The background is much the same, with the factories of St. Petersburg again the arena of oppression and violence, bitterness and hate. But Maxim is no longer a tacit part of the cruel milieu. He is fighting against it with the only available weapons, with the workers' paper, Pravda, with oratory, guile, strikes, the barricades and cobblestones.The picture is a bitter record, ending on the eve of the World War, filmed with the usual austerity of the newer Russian pictures. The mob scenes, the street fights, the sessions of the Duma have the bold clarity and reality of newsreel shots. In the more intimate sequences, in the conferences in workers' homes, in the Pravda offices—the drab walls and studied under-lighting unerringly direct attention to the players. It is a simple, natural and extremely effective technique, although it tends toward pictorial monotony. The film relies far more upon its performers than upon scene, and here it has been fortunate. For Boris Chirkov's Maxim is an excellent study of a developing character, and all the other players, including many who have but a wink of the camera's eye, demonstrate that the Soviet's \"honored artist of the republic\" is far more than an honorary title. Unlike most of Hollywood's sequels, \"The Return of Maxim\" is fully as good as its precursor.\n\nTHE RETURN OF MAXIM, from a scenario by Gregory Kozintsev, Leonid Trauberg and Leo Slavin; musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich; directed by Kozintsev and Trauberg; produced by Lenfilm.
