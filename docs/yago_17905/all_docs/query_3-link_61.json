        "text": "The singer Alla Pugacheva, who fled the country, reacted to the news of her return to Russia with a fairy tale video that she posted on social networks.\n\nThe video is made in the style of the popular children's TV program \"Visiting a fairy tale\" in the USSR.\n\nFirst, in the video, the man tells the news that Pugacheva's husband Maxim Galkin * is trying to challenge the status of a foreign agent already in the Supreme Court. Then the announcer says that the singer herself \"packed up home\" with the children, \"the guys are tired of wandering around the world without a certain point of support, they want to return to their home, where they have their own rooms, where they have friends, where there is a school where they studied, and where they are expected and loved.\"\",\" he says.\n\nThen the narrator from the program \"Visiting the Fairy Tale\" joins the video, in the image of which the theater and cinema actress Anastasia Zueva appeared on television screens.\n\n\"Hello, lovely guys. My old friends. Today, as before, I have come to you with a new fairy tale,\" she says.\n\nAs EADaily reported, according to the Mash telegram channel, Pugacheva planned a week-long visit to Russia at the end of August. It was claimed that this was reported by producer Sergei Dvortsov, who spoke with people from the singer's entourage.\n\nAllegedly, the diva will consider options for venues for a large solo concert in the future, and she will also try to influence the prospect of removing the status of a foreign agent from Galkin*.\n\nThe comedian himself has already categorically denied this information, calling it fake and fictions from beginning to end."
