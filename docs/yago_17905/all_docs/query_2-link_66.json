        "text": "GOGOL’S short story “The Overcoat” is both compact and richly metaphorical: a humble government clerk becomes a new man when he spends his life savings on a fine coat, but is destroyed when it is stolen. It’s a perfect combination for the movies, and the tale has been filmed many times, most notably by the Soviet experimental filmmakers Grigori Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg in 1926, and by the Italian director Alberto Lattuada in 1952.\n\nRaro Video, the American branch of Italy’s most prestigious home-video company, has just released the Lattuada film, “Il Cappotto,” in a finely restored edition, and it is a small marvel: a sharply satirical transposition of the story to a nameless northern Italian city, set just as the country was recovering from the wounds of World War II but before the economic miracle, Il Boom, that transformed Italy’s vestiges of feudalism into a modern, industrial state.\n\nCarmine de Carmine, as Lattuada renamed Gogol’s character, could just as well be in the service of a czar or a medieval prince as in the employ of the pompous, despotic mayor (Giulio Stival) for whom he works as a scrivener. As played by the popular comedian Renato Rascel, Carmine is a paradigm of submission, a tiny man with the shape and panicked eyes of a hamster, whose one accomplishment is his precise, orotund handwriting, which he uses to draft official proclamations in the office of the mayor’s corrupt general secretary (Ettore Mattia).\n\nBut his calligraphic accomplishments are of no use when he is drafted, at the last minute, to take the minutes at an important meeting in which the mayor announces a self-aggrandizing archeological initiative. Under pressure, Carmine’s fine hand produces only indecipherable scratches. His artistry is of no use in a world of soulless bureaucrats.\n\nLattuada may have been making an autobiographical reference here. As a young director, starting his career under Mussolini, he belonged to a group of filmmakers who were called “the calligraphers” for their studied, meticulous style — a style that would be cast into critical disfavor with the postwar rise of the rough and ready neo-realists. Lattuada had his ties to the neo-realist camp: one of the many screenwriters on “Il Cappotto” was Cesare Zavattini, whose far more sentimental treatment of a similar subject, “Umberto D.,” was filmed that same year by Vittorio De Sica.\n\nBut Lattuada’s work in “Il Cappotto” is closer to a Warner Brothers cartoon than a neo-realist newsreel. Beginning with Rascel, who displays the precise physical control of the song-and-dance man he otherwise was (he was also, one is surprised to learn, the composer of “Arrivederci Roma”), Lattuada presents a range of exaggerated types, each verging on geometrical abstraction and each defined by a particular rhythm and set of gestures.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
