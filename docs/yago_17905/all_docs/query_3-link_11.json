        "text": "In 2010, mass protests and violent unrest over accusations of corruption, cost of utilities, and opposition to the governmentâ€™s increasingly authoritarian policies forced president Bakiyev to flee the country. Following his removal from power and the formation of a new government, former president Kurmanbek Bakiyev and his son Maxim Bakiyev were both convicted and sentenced for corruption-related offenses in absentia in Kyrgyzstan. Maxim Bakiyev was convicted for embezzling more than US $130 million in state funds. He denies the allegations.\n\nSpecific factors that helped make the asset return possible in this case were legal proceedings initiated by United States using its non-conviction based authorities and sustained cooperation between law enforcement in both jurisdictions enabled a successful resolution of pending cases and asset return. The funds were forfeited from Gourevitch as part of his criminal conviction as proceeds of his conviction for unlawful securities trading. The Kygyz government, through it US counsel, working with US DOJ MLARS developed evidence tracing these funds to government funds unlawfully taken by the former president of Kyrgystan, Bakiev. The funds were returned to Kygystan through a process known as remission. The Kygyz government pledged to use the funds for three specific ongoing programs in Kyrgystan, including one being conducted with the World Bank and other international financial institutions. Taking into account GFAR principles, the United States issued a news release about the return and the Kygyz government's commitments about how the funds would be used and announced the name of the government official responsible for overseeing the use of the funds."
