        "text": "It’s easing of lockdown reading time and I notice that, serendipitously, half of the titles I selected for review in my customary highly scientific choice process hail from smaller, independent publishers. As these are the sort of presses who are likely to be the worst affected by the recent (and future) closure of actual bookshops, I urge you to favour some of their books in preference to those released by big companies. Champion diversity! And diversity is very much the order of the day this month with dystopian farces, mathematical westerns, tropical love stories with a difference, spying in the 1950s as well as the present, and the obligatory crimes and ensuing investigations all present for the May fiction parade.\n\nBOOK OF THE MONTH: John Lawton/HAMMER TO FALL (Grove Press)\n\nOnce again Lawton confirms why, alongside with Mick Herron, he is a spy writer supreme. Working in the tradition of John Le Carre, he subverts the tropes of Cold War bureaucracy with a mordant sense of humour, with his third novel featuring working class spy (and busy black marketeer) Joe Wilderness. Set in the 1960 and culminating with the sad events of the crushing of the Prague spring by the Soviets, this meandering but witty set of adventures sees him sent by his boss and posh father in law to Finland’s Karelia province which borders the USSR as a field agent to keep him away from a nosy Parliamentary Committee investigation examining a past MI6 bungle. But shady characters from his past emerge out of the blue and a greater conspiracy is unveiled, which brings Lawton’s other series character cop Frederick Troy onto the scene. Nell, a woman he had once loved also reappears and the stage is set for a gripping race against time against a background of service rivalries, spies of all ilk converging on the doomed Czech city and the customary double dealings and betrayals that are part and parcel of Joe’s world of disillusion and poisoned diplomacy. No one like Lawton leavens the human foibles of the spy community with a cynical view of geopolitics and British class consciousness better. A wonderful addition to a growing and fascinating body of work.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Stark Holborn/TRIGGERNOMETRY (Rattleback Books)\n\nTotally unique and a veritable jolt to the sheer perversity of the imagination, Stark Holborn’s follow-up to the gonzo western series NUNSLINGER , is at this stage only available in digital format, but more than worth the detour while hopefully being just an introduction to a crazy new world of the Wild West where mathematicians and scientists have become the new outlaws and are hunted down by the authorities. Malago Browne was once a university professor but has now become a fierce sharpshooter in exile, with a price on her head. When her sidekick desperado Pierre Fermat falls out with her, she has to go on the run in a topsy turvy world where ‘maths’ are feared and commit to the prospect of a final heist she was initially reluctant to take on: the hold up of a freight train on behalf of a untrustworthy power that be. All the clichés of the western movie are present but each subtly subverted in delicious, left of the field ways and each new character introduced is wonderfully etched and bizarre, although always adhering to the bizarre laws of this parallel world that Holborn has created with mischief and affection. It’s like Sergio Leone and William Gibson rewriting the Old West with a quantum calculator that is just that slightly out of sync. Miss Holborn, when is the next instalment coming? I can’t wait.\n\nHazel Barkworth/HEATSTROKE (Headline)\n\nDuring the course of an oppressive summer, fifteen year old Lily disappears and we follow the events through the point of view of Rachel, the mother of her best friend Mia and also Lily’s English teacher. As secrets, lies and duplicitous actions rise to the surface in the wake of the young girl’s absence, Rachel becomes overwhelmed, her whole life turned upside down by the events, and has to look back into her own, troubled past as she suspects Lily might have run off with a fellow teacher, with whom her own dealings have been at most ambiguous. Both a tense, if slow burn, psychological thriller, and an acute examination of the ties that bind between mothers and daughters as well as young girls all folding out in an almost impressionistic manner, with focused attention on the quirks of places and relationships. An assured debut novel with an acute sense of claustrophobia, questioning early sexuality and the tenuous hold on emotions that family relations can have such difficulty at keeping under control.\n\nDugald Bruce-Lockhart/THE LIZARD (Muswell Press)\n\nAfter painfully breaking up with his girlfriend Ellie prior to a planned holiday in Greece, callow German and philosophy student Alistair Haston decides to travel there on his own. The journey begins badly in Paros, where sidestepped by a fascinating Australian Ricky called ‘the lizard’, he is mugged and has all his belongings stolen in addition to losing his planned job as a labourer. He is rescued by mysterious artist Heinrich and begins a fast descent into a world of sheer dyonisiac overall debauchery of sex and drugs in a sun-drenched world at times reminiscent of John Fowles’ THE MAGUS, through the naive lens of Alistair’s point of view. It naturally quickly all goes even more pear-shaped and leads to Alistair being framed for not only six murders but also the death at sea of two police officers. Explicit at times in its depiction of excess, this is a bit of a cinematic rollercoaster ride, loosely inspired, we are informed, by a journey to Greece, the author, now better known as an actor, made in 1988, and one hopes he wasn’t quite as naive -and dangerous- as his character in this fast moving debut, if at moments somewhat preposterous in the main character’s continuous series of mishaps, but enjoyable novel.\n\nTade Thompson/MAKING WOLF (Constable)\n\nThe reissue of a 2015 gritty crime thriller which slipped through the net on initial publication in the USA by a black British author who has since been applauded for his powerful ROSEWATER science fiction trilogy and other titles. Weston Kogi works security in London for a supermarket and on a visit to a West African province closely modelled on the Yoruba area of Nigeria foolishly boasts of being a homicide detective. Which leads to his being abducted by a rebel force to investigate the murder of one of their spiritual leaders. Set against a background of civil war and terrible violence and amorality on both sides of the fence, this is an hallucinatory journey into the heart of darkness by a writer with personal experience of the horrors of modern African turmoil and a disturbing read in the knowledge that so much it describes is still so close to modern day reality. Kogi’s journey from an innocent witness to becoming a knowing accomplice to some of the excesses Africa and the shadow of past Western colonization have birthed is a compelling one and his version of the mean streets puts many white genre practitioners to shame as it comes to life with stunning effect. Possibly the beginning of a series, and why not?\n\nPaul Bassett Davies/PLEASE DO NOT ASK FOR MERCY AS A REFUSAL OFTEN OFFENDS (Eye Books)\n\nDystopia as hardboiled noir farce in this rather original novel by a British comedy impresario and writer. Kilroy is a straight-laced detective strictly cut from the Philip Marlow mould operating in a world with strong Orwellian echoes of 1984 tempered with the worst of East Germany under the Stasi, in which almost everyone is working for the state and spying on each other for the greater good, in this instance, of the church. The divergences from our own world are soon apparent, with technological incongruities juxtaposed against a new form of gospel and beliefs through which the populace is controlled. When the young daughter of a now executed dissident ex-member of the intelligence apparatus disappears and is suspected of having killed her own mother, Kilroy is faced with a case that quickly turns on itself, with multiple questions raised on every new corner he turns. Add to this a slinky femme fatale who comes from another world, or continent or dimension and always puts off answering his questions but gladly sleeps with him, and a domesticated parrot who acts as his friend and you get echoes of Douglas Adams at his more mischievous. The premise of the novel is gripping, only to be slightly diluted as we get to grips with its surfeit of exposition and a cascade of outlandish revelations that transport it into another fictional realm altogether, but it gets top marks for originality and subversive humour.\n\nMichael Connelly/ FAIR WARNING (Orion)\n\nConnelly brings back Jack McEvoy, the journalist who was at the heart of THE POET and THE SCARECROW and possibly the character who is the closest to his heart, as he allows the author to chronicle through him the sad decline of journalism in America, a trade he once practiced. Jack is now working for a consumer investigative website (which actually exists in real life and its boss appears here under his own name) and stumbles upon a possible serial killer who has been operating under the radar for ages. Inspired by Connelly’s own forays into the evolution of DNA research data and its connection to ancestry research services, the plot is both terribly credible and realistic and chilling, highlighting an evil but ultra intelligent killer whose manipulation of the new developments in DNA science and its lack of monitoring by authorities for his own murderous purposes serves an evil purpose. McEvoy is obliged all along to weigh his principles as a reporter against the common good which, yet again, does little to help his on/off relationship with ex-paramour and FBI agent Rachel Walling who has been corralled in to help him despite their past differences. As ever with Connelly, the plot moves along like a well serviced engine although I sometimes had niggling doubts about McEvoy’s continuous ethical struggles.\n\nCamilla Läckberg/THE GILDED CAGE (HarperCollins)\n\nA tense and gripping psychological suspense thriller by Scandi author supreme Camilla Läckberg whose critical reputation has never quite matched her impressive sales, both in Sweden and abroad. Maybe her being the only mystery author to have competed on (the Swedish version of) ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ leads some to dismiss her talent all too superficially. Again set in Fjallbacka, although not part of her usual series, this stand alone book is a fiery tale of a woman’s angry revenge and proves mischievous and devious to the max. Faye Adelheim has everything a woman desires: wealth, beauty, an expensive apartment, a millionaire husband and a loving daughter, but when her spouse trades her in for a younger model, all hell is set loose and Faye’s personality quickly reverts to her previously hidden self in a scenario full of spite, treason, violence and clever feminine wiles deployed against the world at large. A familiar scenario but Lackberg places her characters under a relentless microscope and her focus never wavers, as devious plans unfold, with twists and genuine shocks along the way. Hitherto known on Nordic shores as the Swedish Agatha Christie, Läckberg also turns out to be the local Patricia Highsmith and Gillian Flynn!\n\nAntony Johnston/THE TEMPUS PROJECT (Eye Books)\n\nThe return of Anglo-French spy Brigitte Sharp and a direct follow-up to Johnston’s thriller debut THE EXPHORIA CODE is yet again a breathless cat and mouse dance of shadowy operatives with mixed loyalties set against an evocative European background, in this instance the fascinating part-medieval city of Tallinn in Estonia, with an incursion into Africa. And the ultra villain manipulating forces in the background is called Maxim, so how could I not enjoy it! Johnston delivers a veritable master class of computer knowledge, highlighting our new techno world where hacking, electronic surveillance, crypto currencies, cyberworms, geopolitics, artificial intelligences and maleficent viruses are the currency of the day and form the spine of an elaborate plot which sounds almost terrifying in its wickedness and actuality and which the feisty Brigitte is tasked to resolve, which she does in her normal rebellious manner, à la Lisbeth Salander had she ever been coopted by the security services to fight the good electronic fight. At times the sheer amount of information provided to explain the complexities of the conspiracies involved feels a little heavy-handed, but if the reader just lets himself go with the flow, this delivers countless thrills and suspensions of the heartbeat.\n\nMonique Roffey/THE MERMAID OF BLACK CONCH (Peepal Tree Press)\n\nWhite Caribbean literary author Roffey moves with elegant ease between genres (her previous novel THE TRYST was a powerful, earthy erotic novel) and her new book finds her in gentle magical realist waters. On the island of Black Conch, loosely inspired by her native Tobago, in the 1970s, David, a young fisherman attracts the attention of a mermaid while playing his guitar, and witnesses her swimming close to his boat. Some time later, on the occasion of an annual fishing competition, he inadvertently leads some of the sportsmen towards her and she is captured. Heavy with guilt, David the same evening while others are celebrating, rescues her. Their story unfolds over the course of the next forty years in the pages of his journal, together with third person narration and some insights into the mermaid’s own thoughts. At heart a fantastical love story with a subtle touch of fable with the inevitable bittersweet ending, Roffey’s tale is a celebration of life in the Caribbean and its lush landscapes’ legends, colours and smells and matching emotions, and quickly tugs at the heart in insidious ways. Roffey is now working on a crime novel, which bodes well."
