        "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, May 09, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Maxim Power Corp. (\"MAXIM\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX: MXG) announced today the release of financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2023. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, accompanying notes and Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) will be available on SEDAR and on MAXIM's website on May 9, 2023. All figures reported herein are Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated.\n\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nMarch 31,($ in thousands except per share amounts)20232022Revenue-35,792Net income7,75116,898Earnings per share – basic0.150.34Earnings per share – diluted0.140.28Adjusted EBITDA(1)11,73115,893Total generation – (MWh)-393,591Total fuel consumption – (GJ)21,5464,179,531Average Alberta market power price ($ per MWh)142.0089.80Average realized power price ($ per MWh)-90.94Loans and borrowings82,29683,570Net debt(1)30,96148,464Total assets382,622364,569\n\n(1) Select financial information was derived from the consolidated financial statements and is prepared in accordance with GAAP, except adjusted Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), which is a non-GAAP measure (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below). Net debt is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. It is calculated to include: loans and borrowings (including the convertible loan facility) less unrestricted cash\n\nOPERATING RESULTS\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, MAXIM recorded net income and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, (“Adjusted EBITDA”(1)) of $7.8 million and $11.7 million, respectively, as compared to $16.9 million and $15.9 million, respectively, in the same period of 2022. Net income in the first quarter of 2023 decreased as compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to the non-injury fire incident (“Incident”) at Milner 2 (“M2”) which resulted in no generation from M2 in the first quarter of 2023 and unrealized and realized commodity swap gains in 2022, partially offset by the business interruption claim in 2023. A significant portion of the decrease to Adjusted EBITDA was due to the Incident at M2, partially offset by the business interruption claim. (see Insurance Information Update below).\n\nM2 RETURN TO SERVICE UPDATE\n\nMAXIM has disassembled the damaged air inlet filter house caused by the Incident at M2, procured a replacement air inlet filter house and is actively expediting the construction process to restore M2 to operational service as soon as possible. Installation of the new air inlet filter house commenced in April 2023, with completion expected late in July 2023. MAXIM does not expect to be generating electricity from the HR Milner (“Milner”) site until the end of July 2023, at which point MAXIM anticipates commencing hot commissioning activities for the Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (“CCGT”) expansion of M2. Hot commissioning activities are anticipated to occur over an approximate three-month period, during which there will be periodic outages of the facility resulting in intermittent generation of electricity. The CCGT expansion will increase total generation capacity of M2 from 204 MW to 300 MW and lower operations and maintenance costs per MWh as a result of operational efficiencies.\n\nM2 CCGT EXPANSION PROJECT UPDATE\n\nAs previously reported, start up of the CCGT expansion project will be delayed due to the Incident. Construction of the CCGT expansion project is currently greater than 99% complete, however, hot-commissioning activities cannot occur until M2 is returned to service.\n\nThe estimated project cost, excluding borrowing costs and the net effect of $20 million of grant proceeds, is currently $162 million. The estimated project costs increased from $155 million due to incremental costs anticipated to be incurred as a result of the delay in commissioning and exclude the costs related to procuring the new air inlet filter house, which are expected to be recovered from insurance coverage.\n\nCompletion of the CCGT expansion of M2 will allow for the capture of waste heat that would otherwise exhaust into the atmosphere and turn it into useful low carbon electricity for the Alberta power grid. The CCGT expansion of M2 will reduce the intensity of carbon emissions by more than 60% compared to the legacy coal-fired H.R. Milner facility.\n\nAt this time, MAXIM forecasts it has sufficient liquidity to complete both the CCGT expansion of M2 and the replacement of the air inlet filter house and will fund these costs using cash on hand, available funds through the existing senior and subordinated credit facilities, and anticipated insurance proceeds, as required.\n\nFINANCING UPDATE\n\nMAXIM has amended and received consent for certain terms and conditions under the senior and subordinated credit facilities to make the necessary changes to maintain compliance and appropriately address the impact from the Incident at M2 and timing of the commissioning of the CCGT expansion of M2. Changes of most significance include revising the timing of the completion of the CCGT expansion of M2, including the air inlet filter house repair program, pausing the Corporation’s normal course issuer bid until after the CCGT expansion of M2 has achieved substantial completion and addressing other standard administrative changes for an event of this nature.\n\nThere were no changes to the availability of the senior and subordinated credit facilities which give access to an additional $92 million of funding under various terms and conditions.\n\nINSURANCE INFORMATION UPDATE\n\nAs previously reported, MAXIM reaffirms insurance coverage for the Incident, subject to the terms and conditions of the Corporation’s Property Insurance (“PI”) policy, including Business Interruption (“BI”) provisions. The Corporation continues to progress an insurance claim for property damage and lost earnings under the PI policy. The PI policy provides $200 million in total coverage, including BI. The PI insurance coverage related to the property damage from the Incident is subject to a customary deductible. The sub-limitations on the BI provision of the PI policy include a 45-day deductible, a monthly cap of $5.5 million gross margin (plus 10% margin allowance), and a policy cap of $66 million total gross margin. The Corporation is comfortable that the PI policy limit of $200 million, less any coverage related to the BI provision, is sufficient to cover the property damage related to the Incident.\n\nTo date, MAXIM has submitted claims for $45.8 million, of which $36.3 million relates to BI and $9.5 million relates to PI. To date, $25.0 million has been paid by the insurance company in relation to these claims. The Corporation continues to progress the insurance claims for damages and future lost earnings.\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nManagement evaluates MAXIM’s performance using a variety of measures. The non-GAAP measure discussed below should not be considered as an alternative to or to be more meaningful than net income of the Corporation, as determined in accordance with GAAP, when assessing MAXIM’s financial performance or liquidity.\n\nThis measure does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is provided to assist management and investors in determining the Corporation's approximate operating cash flows before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization and certain other non-recurring income and expenses.\n\nThree months ended March 31 ($000's)20232022GAAP Measures from Condensed Consolidated Interim Statement of Income (Loss)Net income7,75116,898Income tax expense2,2805,105Finance expense, net1,3561,683Depreciation and amortization2,0092,10513,39625,791Adjustments:Other income(19,963)-Unrealized gain on commodity swaps-(10,017)Business interruption insurance claim18,150-Share-based compensation148119Adjusted EBITDA11,73115,893\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as described above from its most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, and adjusts for specific items that are not reflective of the Corporation’s underlying operations and excluding other non-cash items.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is provided to assist management and investors in determining the Corporation’s approximate operating cash flows attributable to shareholders before finance expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and certain other non-recurring or non-cash income and expenses. Financing expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization are excluded from the Adjusted EBITDA calculation, as they do not represent cash expenditures that are directly affected by operations. Management believes that presentation of this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors and shareholders as it assists in the evaluation of performance trends. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to compare financial results among reporting periods and to evaluate MAXIM’s operating performance and ability to generate funds from operating activities.\n\nIn calculating Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 management included business interruption insurance claim proceeds as it reflects a portion of earnings that would have been earned if M2 was operational and excluded certain non-cash and non-recurring transactions. In both 2023 and 2022, Adjusted EBITDA excluded all items of other income and expense including: unrealized gains on commodity swaps and share-based compensation.\n\nAbout MAXIM\n\nBased in Calgary, Alberta, MAXIM is one of Canada’s largest truly independent power producers. MAXIM is now focused entirely on power projects in Alberta. Its core asset – the 204 MW H.R. Milner Plant, M2, in Grande Cache, AB – is a state-of-the-art natural gas-fired power plant that commissioned in Q2, 2020. MAXIM is currently increasing the capacity of M2 to approximately 300 MW and concurrently will realize an improvement in the efficiency of the plant by investing in heat recovery combined cycle technology. In addition, MAXIM continues to explore additional development options in Alberta including its currently permitted gas-fired generation projects and the permitting of its wind power generation project. MAXIM trades on the TSX under the symbol “MXG”. For more information about MAXIM, visit our website at www.maximpowercorp.com.
