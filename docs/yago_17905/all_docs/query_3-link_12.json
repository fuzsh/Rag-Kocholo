        "text": "What feels like a lifetime ago, I came up with a character called Cornelia for a short story in my PARIS NOIR anthology for Serpent’s Tail. Anyone familiar with my reviews and criminal tastes will of course know what inspired her name: the late, great Cornell Woolrich, that sad poet and chronicler of fate and despair whose noir writings still outshine much of contemporary crime fiction today. Overt plug: my anthology of stories inspired by Woolrich, BLACK IS THE NIGHT, appears in paperback format in January 2024…\n\nCornelia was a hitwoman, with a hobby for collecting books. Again, no surprise coming from the keyboard of an author whose motto has often been one of ‘sex, books and rock n’roll’, if only by virtue of the fact that my feeble attempts at experimenting with (very) soft drugs in my youth had no effect whatsoever on me (but then neither had alcohol, making me into the Coca Cola and fruit juice sort of guy I am today and which my friends in and out of the mystery community find quite amusing…). Call me the man with odd physiology…\n\nI perversely identified closely with Cornelia, even though she is a woman and the books I relentlessly accumulate are not financed by blood money! I wanted to explore her further and she appeared as a side character in two of my novels, as well as a trio of additional short stories as an endearing angel of death. I finally collected all my Cornelia short stories as a section of last year’s collection DEATH HAS A THOUSAND FACES. Was this the end of Cornelia?\n\nIn the meantime, TV had introduced the wonderful Jodie Comer as Villanelle in KILLING EVE. The character has of course nothing in common with my Cornelia but, all of a sudden, female hitwomen were now all the vogue and once again I felt I had been an unwitting and unsung pioneer in that very particular field!\n\nI usually pen a novel every two years and, following my tale of dangerous mermaids and the Pied Piper of Hamelin, THE PIPER’S DANCE, thought my time as a novelist was over. I had no ideas what to write further, and due to personal circumstances little desire to swim in that sea again. I’d always much preferred writing short stories anyway: faster gratification, less procrastination and despair about the ‘what comes next’, easier to plot and, normally done and dusted within the space of a week or two, unlike the unending and anguished slog a novel represents for me. However, an insistent voice at the back of my head kept on insidiously whispering that if had to close the metaphorical book on my novel writing days, I couldn’t vacate the scene with my last two novels being a dystopian thriller (THE LOUISIANA REPUBLIC) and the aforementioned fantasy of castrating mermaids and the devil himself. Surely, the then Chair of the Crime Writers’ Association should surely bow out with a proper, bonafide crime novel?\n\nI deliberately selected a long sea cruise (to the Caribbean and Cuba) which would last 42 days and reckoned that I could complete the first draft of a new, probably final novel, at the rate of 2,000 words a day. I’d previously completed writing an earlier book on a voyage from Tilbury to Sydney and I knew that the isolation of being at sea worked as a perfect spur to my writing; no distractions, the soothing effect of the vast sea beyond my cabin window; everyday life banished beyond the far horizon… I’m actually not the only one to have made a habit of writing whilst isolated at sea, as I’m aware that both Lawrence Block and Felix Francis write on cruises, so who am I to buck the trend!\n\nBut what to write? And then it came to me: Cornelia’s last bow… Eat your deerstalker, Sherlock…\n\nI came up with the skeleton of the plot, cannibalised a few of the preceding short stories in which she appears, adjusted the chronology and there it was, clear as blue sky, Cornelia’s last hurrah. As a character she had always had a coldness of heart necessary for the killing jobs she undertook, but I was aware that there was a mystery at her centre, and she was the way she was because something was missing from her life. So Cornelia would fall in love! How had I not thought of this before? I’d be writing a love story alongside a crime thriller. And when love is involved in a Jakubowski book, naturally erotic elements creep in under cover of darkness. The solution to my dilemma was perfect.\n\nSo, without giving too much away, Cornelia falls in love with a man who also happens to be a contract killer for an organisation she happens to freelance for, and sinister elements in search of revenge blame him for a murder she had actually committed and the two of them have to navigate a difficult path between the demands of their paymasters and a lounge piano player in search of retribution and with a cruel penchant for BDSM. It’s an impossible love story between improbable protagonists, an insight into a secret corporation whose business is death and traces its origins to pirates duelling in Cuba, both guilty and innocent people die, rare books appear and disappear, and a writer who bears uncanny similarities to me is introduced as a character! It’s twisted; it’s violent; it’s unashamedly sentimental; it’s explicit; it’s full of devious twists and characters you’ll either love or hate or both; it’s JUST A GIRL WITH A GUN.\n\nSam and David Howe at Telos quickly acquired it and when I mentioned that my vision of the book was akin to an Edward Hopper painting, happily suggested we actually use a Hopper image for the cover artwork. Sadly, the many suitable images that would have suited the mood of the novel were still in copyright and would have been too expensive to licence, so David had the brilliant idea of commissioning a variation on Hopper which works perfectly and is without a doubt one of the favourite covers for one of my books I’ve benefitted from.\n\nI was ahead of my time in creating a female hitwoman and years behind the trend for having a ‘girl’ in the title, but no one is perfect!\n\nThe novel is being marketed as MR. AND MRS. SMITH MEETS KILLING EVE, because we all need a hook. I hope it finds its readership.\n\nJUST A GIRL WITH A GUN is published by Telos"
