        "text": "Pennywise will be back sooner than you think.\n\nPrepare to float in 2019.\n\nNew Line Cinema and Warner Bros. has at long last announced a release date for its sequel to its Stephen King box-office monster IT: Sept. 6, 2019.\n\nIT has earned $266.1 million domestically and $478.1 million globally to date, making it the top-earning horror film of all time… not adjusted for inflation. All it took was a killer clown to revitalize the box office after a lackluster summer.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n” tml-embed-width=”640″ tml-embed-height=”360″ tml-render-layout=”inline\n\nGary Dauberman, who co-wrote the first, will reportedly write the second while director Andy Muschietti is likely to return.\n\nMuschietti’s master plan is to split Stephen King’s doorstopper into two films: one exclusively dedicated to the Loser’s Club as kids and the second following them into adulthood, with a few flashbacks.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n” tml-embed-width=”640″ tml-embed-height=”410″ tml-render-layout=”inline\n\nThe sequel will likely be darker in tone than the first, which focused primarily on visceral scares and slapstick laughs.\n\nWhat’s more, fans can look forward to A-list actors taking on the adult Loser’s Club roles. Muschietti has already said he’s eyeing Jessica Chastain to play redheaded heroine Beverly.\n\nAll will be revealed in two year’s time."
