        "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, Aug. 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Maxim Power Corp. (\"MAXIM\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX: MXG) announced today the release of financial and operating results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, accompanying notes and Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) will be available on SEDAR+ and on MAXIM's website on August 6, 2024. All figures reported herein are Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated.\n\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\nOPERATING RESULTS\n\nDuring the second quarter and first six months of 2024, revenues increased, while Adjusted EBITDA(1) and net income decreased as compared to 2023. Revenue increased primarily due to Milner 2 (“M2”) continuing operations in the second quarter and first six months of 2024, while it was offline in the comparable periods of 2023 due to the non-injury fire that occurred at Milner on September 30, 2022 (“Non-Injury Fire”). Decreases to net income and Adjusted EBITDA(1) in the second quarter and first six months 2024 were primarily due to the cessation of business interruption claims in 2024, partially offset by the net impacts of operations of M2 in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 during which it was offline due to the Non-Injury Fire. Average realized power prices compared to average market power prices were lower in the first six months of 2024, primarily due to an unplanned outage in January 2024 at M2 coinciding with higher market power prices.\n\nM2 CCGT OPERATIONS\n\nM2 has been experiencing a temporary capability derate of the legacy cooling tower system. In late May 2024, M2 came offline for a planned outage to address routine maintenance items and management took the opportunity to aggressively expedite cleaning efforts on the legacy cooling tower system during the planned outage window. M2 came back on-line during the first half of June, with the temporary capability derate largely restored. As a result, generation from M2 decreased in the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the first quarter of 2024. Management continues to actively address the remaining derate through corrective measures which has resulted, and will continue to result in, variable plant output during this period until output is fully restored. Management anticipates it will have the capability derate addressed in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nNORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID UPDATE\n\nMAXIM’s current normal course issuer bid (“NCIB”) program is for the August 31, 2023 to August 30, 2024 period. Under this NCIB, the Corporation may purchase for cancellation up to 2,526,477 common shares of the Corporation. Collectively under this program and as of the date of this press release, the Corporation has repurchased and cancelled 252,176 common shares for $1.1 million at a weighted average price of $4.45 per share. MAXIM’s NCIB program is limited to $2.0 million for the 2024 calendar year under the senior credit facility. Any excess is subject to approval from the lenders under the senior credit facility.\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nManagement evaluates MAXIM’s performance using a variety of measures. Adjusted EBITDA, as discussed below is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered as an alternative to or to be more meaningful than net income of the Corporation, as determined in accordance with GAAP, when assessing MAXIM’s financial performance or liquidity. This measure does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is provided to assist management and investors in determining the Corporation's approximate operating cash flow before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization and certain other non-recurring income and expenses.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as described above from its most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, and adjusts for specific items that are not reflective of the Corporation’s underlying operations and excludes other non-cash items.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is provided to assist management and investors in determining the Corporation’s approximate operating cash flows attributable to shareholders before finance expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and certain other non-recurring or non-cash income and expenses. Financing expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, loss on write-off of asset and impairment charges are excluded from the Adjusted EBITDA calculation, as they do not represent cash expenditures that are directly affected by operations. Management believes that presentation of this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors and shareholders as it assists in the evaluation of performance trends. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to compare financial results among reporting periods and to evaluate MAXIM’s operating performance and ability to generate funds from operating activities.\n\nIn calculating Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter and first six months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 management excluded certain non-cash and non-recurring transactions. In both 2024 and 2023, Adjusted EBITDA excluded unrealized gains or losses on commodity swaps, share-based compensation and all items of other income and expense except for business interruption insurance as it reflects a portion of earnings that would have been earned if M2 was operational.\n\nAbout MAXIM\n\nBased in Calgary, Alberta, MAXIM is one of Canada’s largest truly independent power producers. MAXIM is now focused entirely on power projects in Alberta. Its core asset – the 300 MW H.R. Milner Plant, M2, in Grande Cache, AB – is a state-of-the-art combined cycle gas-fired power plant that commissioned in Q4, 2023. MAXIM continues to explore additional development options in Alberta including its currently permitted gas-fired generation project and the permitting of its wind power generation project. MAXIM trades on the TSX under the symbol “MXG”. For more information about MAXIM, visit our website at www.maximpowercorp.com.
