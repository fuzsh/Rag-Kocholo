        "text": "Russian Producer and Composer, Maxim Fadeev has announced the creation of the Evroaziya Contest.\n\nFollowing the announcement that the Russian Government is reviving Intervision, the Producer and Composer Maxim Fadeev has revealed he is also working on a new song contest. Posting on his Telegram channel he announced Evroaziya, which is to be held in Uzbekistan next August.\n\nHe told his followers on Telegram that:\n\n“It will be hosted by three countries – Russia , Uzbekistan and Turkey . Russia will be represented by your humble servant, Uzbekistan by Yulduz Usmanova, and Turkey by probably the most popular representative of the creative profession there today. I’m sure his name will be a shock to everyone.”\n\nMr Fadeev added that:\n\n“Visually, Evroazija is conceived as an International Music Olympiad. We will hold the festival annually in August. Headquarters in three countries have already begun working to organize the acceptance of applications from participating countries.”\n\nMaxim Fadeev has links to the Eurovision Song Contest which Russia is currently banned from competing in. He was the composer of the Russian entry in 2004 and 2007, and sat on the jury in the Russian selection in 2005, 2008 and 2010. In 2010, he also was involved with the Belarusian entry for Oslo.\n\nContext\n\nRTR, Channel One and Radio Dom Ostankino are all currently suspended from the European Broadcasting Union, following a unanimous decision from the Executive Committee in late May 2022. Russia’s participation in Junior Eurovision had been organised by RTR. This followed Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022."
