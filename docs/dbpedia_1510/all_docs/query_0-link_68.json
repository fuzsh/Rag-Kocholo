But there were dozens of signers of the Declaration of Independence and delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1787, many of whom had noteworthy careers in law, politics, and the military. Most of their names are known only to historians or devotees of the period.\n\nThere were dozens of people who played key roles in the founding of America, but their names have been overshadowed by the most famous of the Founders. Here's your chance to vote up the Founders that you think have been unfairly forgotten by history, or that people just don't know enough about. Likewise, if you think a Founding Father is overrated or maybe wasn't as important as people think, give them a down vote.\n\nThe Founding Fathers were a pretty interesting bunch of guys, learn more about them (including a cool essay Benjamin Franklin wrote about flatulence!) on this list of Founding Fathers facts!\n\nFebruary 22, 1732—Westmoreland County, Virginia\n\n3,259 votes\n\nGeorge Washington was the first President of the United States, the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He presided over the convention that drafted the United States Constitution, which replaced the Articles of Confederation and remains the supreme law of the land. Washington was unanimously elected President by the electors in both the 17881789 and 1792 elections.\n\nJanuary 17, 1706—Boston, MA\n\n2,938 votes\n\nBenjamin Franklin was a Founding Father of the United States and a polymath with many talents and accomplishments. He was a leading author, printer, political theorist, politician, Freemason, postmaster, scientist, inventor, humorist, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. He founded many civic organizations, including the Library Company, Philadelphia's first fire department, and the University of Pennsylvania. As a scientist, he made significant contributions to the American Enlightenment and the history of physics, particularly in the area of electricity. He invented the lightning rod, bifocals, and the Franklin stove, among other things. Franklin played an important role in defining the American ethos as a blend of practical values and scientific and tolerant values. He was instrumental in uniting the colonies and was the first United States Ambassador to France. He was a successful newspaper editor and author of Poor Richard's Almanack.\n\nApril 13, 1743—Shadwell, VA\n\n2,925 votes\n\nParty (if partisan) : Democratic-Republican Party\n\nThomas Jefferson, one of the most influential Founding Fathers of the United States, was born on April 13, 1743, in Shadwell, Virginia. Raised in a well-to-do family with six sisters and one brother, he was afforded an excellent education, studying under notable figures like Reverend James Maury and William Small. His intellectual curiosity drove him to explore a wide variety of subjects, from philosophy and mathematics to horticulture and mechanics. This love for learning paved the way for his future roles as a statesman, architect, and inventor. Jefferson's political career began in earnest when he was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1769. He made his mark early on as a fervent advocate for colonial rights, gaining recognition for his articulate arguments against British taxation. However, it was his role in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776 that truly solidified his place in American history. As the primary author of this pivotal document, Jefferson articulated the fundamental principles that would guide the emerging nation, emphasizing the ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Outside of politics, Jefferson was a man of many talents. He had a passion for architecture, designing his own home, Monticello, as well as the University of Virginia. His love for horticulture was evident in the extensive gardens he cultivated at Monticello, where he experimented with a variety of plants and crops. Moreover, as an inventor, he devised practical solutions to everyday problems, creating devices like the dumbwaiter and the plow moldboard of least resistance. Despite his many accomplishments, Jefferson remained a humble and dedicated public servant until his death on July 4, 1826. His enduring legacy continues to shape the American landscape, reflecting his profound impact on the nation's founding principles and cultural fabric.\n\nJanuary 11, 1757—Charlestown, Saint Kitts and Nevis\n\n3,381 votes\n\nBorn on January 11, 1755, on the island of Nevis in the British West Indies, Alexander Hamilton's life was a testament to the power of determination and intelligence. Despite facing numerous adversities early in his life, including being orphaned as a child, he managed to carve out an impressive career that significantly shaped the formation of the United States. Hamilton's intellect shone from a young age. Recognized by community leaders in Nevis for his potential, they pooled resources to send him to America for education. He attended King's College (now Columbia University) in New York City. During the American Revolution, Hamilton served as aide-de-camp to General George Washington, displaying exceptional strategic skills and administrative prowess. Post-war, Hamilton's influence further grew as a key contributor to the Federalist Papers, a series of essays advocating for the ratification of the Constitution. In 1789, he was appointed the first Secretary of the Treasury by President Washington, where he implemented financial systems that are still in place today. His vision of a strong central government and industrial economy often clashed with contemporaries like Thomas Jefferson, igniting debates that continue to resonate in American politics. Alexander Hamilton's legacy extends far beyond his untimely death in a duel against Aaron Burr in 1804; his foundational work in establishing modern American fiscal policy and constitutional interpretation leaves an indelible mark on the country's history.\n\nMarch 16, 1751—Port Conway, VA\n\n2,081 votes\n\nParty (if partisan) : Democratic-Republican Party\n\nJames Madison Jr. (March 16, 1751 – June 28, 1836) was an American statesman, lawyer, diplomat, philosopher, and Founding Father who served as the fourth president of the United States from 1809 to 1817. He is hailed as the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his pivotal role in drafting and promoting the Constitution of the United States and the United States Bill of Rights. He also co-wrote The Federalist Papers, co-founded the Democratic-Republican Party, and served as the fifth United States secretary of State from 1801 to 1809. Born into a prominent Virginia planter family, Madison served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and the Continental Congress during and after the American Revolutionary War. He became dissatisfied with the weak national government established by the Articles of Confederation and helped organize the Constitutional Convention, which produced a new constitution to supplant the Articles of Confederation. Madison's Virginia Plan served as the basis for the Constitutional Convention's deliberations, and he was one of the most influential individuals at the convention. Madison became one of the leaders in the movement to ratify the Constitution, and he joined with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay in writing The Federalist Papers, a series of pro-ratification essays that is widely considered to be one of the most influential works of political science in American history. After the ratification of the Constitution, Madison emerged as an important leader in the United States House of Representatives and served as a close adviser to President George Washington. He was the main force behind the ratification of the United States Bill of Rights, which enshrines guarantees of personal freedoms and rights within the Constitution. During the early 1790s, Madison came to oppose the economic program and accompanying centralization of power favored by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton. Along with Thomas Jefferson, Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party, which was, alongside Hamilton's Federalist Party, one of the nation's first major political parties. After Jefferson won the 1800 presidential election, Madison served as secretary of State from 1801 to 1809. In that position, he supervised the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the size of the United States. Madison succeeded Jefferson with a victory in the 1808 presidential election. After diplomatic protests and a trade embargo failed to end British attacks against American shipping, he led the United States into the War of 1812. The war was an administrative morass and ended inconclusively, but many Americans saw it as a successful \"second war of independence\" against Britain. The war convinced Madison of the necessity of a stronger federal government, and he presided over the creation of the Second Bank of the United States and the enactment of the protective Tariff of 1816. He retired from public office in 1817 and died in 1836. Madison is considered to be one of the most important Founding Fathers of the United States, and historians have generally ranked him as an above-average president.\n\nOctober 30, 1735—Quincy, MA\n\n2,192 votes\n\nParty (if partisan) : Federalist Party\n\nJohn Adams Jr. (October 30, 1735 – July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, attorney, diplomat, writer, and Founding Father who served as the second president of the United States from 1797 to 1801. Before his presidency, he was a leader of the American Revolution that achieved independence from Great Britain and served as the first vice president of the United States. Adams was a dedicated diarist and regularly corresponded with many important figures in early American history, including his wife and adviser, Abigail. His letters and other papers serve as an important source of historical information about the era. A lawyer and political activist prior to the revolution, Adams was devoted to the right to counsel and presumption of innocence. He defied anti-British sentiment and successfully defended British soldiers against murder charges arising from the Boston Massacre. Adams was a Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress and became a principal leader of the Revolution. He assisted in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and was its foremost advocate in Congress. As a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate the peace treaty with Great Britain and secured vital governmental loans. Adams was the primary author of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780, which influenced the United States' own constitution, as did his earlier Thoughts on Government. Adams was elected to two terms as vice president under President George Washington and was elected as the United States' second president in 1796. During his single term, Adams encountered fierce criticism from the Jeffersonian Republicans and from some in his own Federalist Party, led by his rival Alexander Hamilton. Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts and built up the Army and Navy in the undeclared \"Quasi-War\" with France. The main accomplishment of his presidency was a peaceful resolution of this conflict in the face of public anger and Hamilton's opposition. During his term, he became the first president to reside in the executive mansion now known as the White House. In his bid for reelection, opposition from Federalists and accusations of despotism from Republicans led to Adams's loss to his former friend Thomas Jefferson, and he retired to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed his friendship with Jefferson by initiating a correspondence that lasted fourteen years. He and his wife generated a family of politicians, diplomats, and historians now referred to as the Adams political family, which includes their son John Quincy Adams, the sixth president of the United States. John Adams died on July 4, 1826 – the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence – hours after Jefferson's death. Surveys of historians and scholars have favorably ranked his administration."
