        "text": "Delegates to the Constitutional Convention\n\nIn May 1787, 55 delegates arrived in Philadelphia. They came from every state except Rhode Island, where the state legislature opposed any changes to the Articles of Confederation to increase central authority. The delegates were men of property: merchants, slaveholding planters, and other men of wealth and means.\n\nSome delegates, such as Benjamin Franklin, had been early advocates of independence. Others such as George Washington and Robert Morris had risen in popularity during the war. Some influential patriots embroiled in the cause for independence missed the Convention. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were in Britain and France, serving as ministers. Massachusetts rejected Samuel Adams as a delegate as he vehemently opposed a stronger national government.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nVirginian Patrick Henry famously refused to attend because he “smelled a rat,” meaning he felt the growing wave of a nationalist faction to overthrow the government of the Articles of Confederation.\n\nListed below are all 55 Delegates to the Constitutional Convention, organized by state. The (*) indicates delegates who attended but did not sign or ratify the Constitution. These delegates are often referred to as the “Framers” of the Constitution, as it is their summer of debate that shaped the current government of the United States.1\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOliver Ellsworth (Elsworth)*\n\nWilliam Samuel Johnson\n\nRoger Sherman\n\nDavid Brearly (Brearley)\n\nJonathan Dayton\n\nWilliam C. Houston*\n\nWilliam Livingston\n\nWilliam Paterson (Patterson)\n\nDelaware\n\nNew York\n\nRichard Bassett\n\nGunning Bedford, Jr.\n\nJacob Broom\n\nJohn Dickinson\n\nGeorge Read\n\nAlexander Hamilton\n\nJohn Lansing, Jr.*\n\nRobert Yates*\n\nGeorgia\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAbraham Baldwin\n\nWilliam Few\n\nWilliam Houston*\n\nWilliam L.

Randolph*\n\nGeorge Washington\n\nGeorge Wythe*\n\nPresident of the Constitutional Convention\n\nThe delegates unanimously elected George Washington to preside over the convention. They chose Washington as he was an immensely popular figure due to his successful command of the Continental Army and his respect as a politician from Virginia.\n\nWashington's Influence on the Convention\n\nWashington made it clear before he agreed to attend the convention that he wanted to remain impartial, not use his newfound celebrity to influence the proceedings. As president of the convention, he remained neutral and gave very little input, living up to his convictions to stay as non-influential as possible.\n\nOnly at the end of the convention as the delegates moved to present the new Constitution to Congress did Washington insert his thoughts and sway. Penning a letter to accompany the document. The following is a brief excerpt from the letter in which Washington expresses his support of the new U.S. Constitution:\n\n\"In all our deliberations on this subject, we kept steadily in our view, that which appears to us the greatest interest of every true American, the consolidation of our Union, in which is involved our prosperity, felicity, safety, perhaps our national existence, This important consideration, seriously and deeply impressed on our minds, led each State in the Convention to be less rigid on points of inferior magnitude, than might have been otherwise expected; and thus the Constitution, which we now present, is the result of a spirit of amity, and of that mutual deference and concession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensable.\"2\n\nThe Virginia Plan vs. The New Jersey Plan\n\nJames Madison arrived at the Constitutional Convention prepared to present a case for an entirely new form of government. What he proposed is called the Virginia plan. His plan was multifaceted and addressed many of the issues of representation, the structure of government, and nationalist sentiments he felt were lacking in the Articles of Confederation.\n\nThe Virginia Plan\n\nThe Virginia plan presented three critical points of debate and a solution for each.\n\nFirst, the plan rejected state sovereignty in favor of a superior national government, including the power to override state laws.\n\nSecond, the people would establish the federal government, not the states that established the Articles of Confederation, and national laws would operate directly on the citizens of the varying states.\n\nThird, Madison’s plan proposed a three-tiered election system and a bicameral legislature to address representation. Ordinary voters would elect only the lower house of the national legislature, naming the upper house members. Then both houses would choose the executive and judicial branches.\n\nIssues with the Virginia Plan\n\nMadison's plan had two major flaws for those delegates not yet convinced of the nationalist agenda:\n\nThe notion that the federal government could veto state laws was aberrant to most state politicians and citizens.\n\nThe Virginia plan would give most federal power to the populous states because representation in the lower house depended on the state's population. Many smaller states objected to this plan and rallied behind William Paterson of New Jersey’s proposed plan.\n\nThe New Jersey Plan\n\nThe New Jersey Plan held onto the structure of the Articles of Confederation and was strongly supported by the smaller states. It would give the Confederation the power to raise revenue, control commerce, and make binding resolutions on the states, but it preserved the state’s control of their laws. It also guaranteed state equality in the federal government by maintaining that each state would have one vote in a unicameral legislature.\n\nThis debate over representation between large and small states became the most critical discussion of the convention. Many delegates realized that no other compromises could be made over any additional questions without resolving this issue. The debate over representation lasted two months. Only a few states had agreed to use Madison’s plans as the basis of discussion, let alone how to structure representation in the government.\n\nIn mid-summer, The delegates from Connecticut proposed a resolution.\n\nThe upper house, the Senate, would comprise two representatives from each state, elected by state legislatures, maintaining the equality in the legislative branch demanded by the smaller states.\n\nThe lower chamber, the House of Representatives, is apportioned by state population- through a national census every ten years.\n\nThe debate over this proposal lasted another few weeks, such as discussion over each chamber’s powers and control began, such as giving the lower house the ability of the “purse” to control legislature involving taxes, tariffs, and funding while giving the upper house the power of approving executive appointments to office and courts. After bitter debate, delegates from the populous states reluctantly agreed to this “Great Compromise.”\n\nSlavery: The Three-Fifths Clause and Compromise\n\nOnce the delegates had settled the structure of representation, delegates began to address the looming issue of slavery that hovered over many of the debates. Many northern delegates, such as Gouverneur Morris, saw slavery as a horrible institution and directly conflicted with the sentiments of free markets and personal liberty instilled in the new national government.\n\nFinally, a compromise was made regarding slave populations and voting. Because enslaved peoples lacked the right to vote, northern anti-slavery delegates wanted to exclude their populations from appropriating seats in the House of Representatives, while - though hypocritically- southern delegates wanted enslaved peoples to be counted as full citizens. The compromise was that the delegates agreed to count each slave as three-fifths of a free person for representation and taxation.\n\nDid you know?\n\nA significant consequence of the 3/5 Compromise was that it helped southern planters dominate national politics until the 1860s. The southern states got the power and control of the House of Representatives they sought by having a portion of enslaved peoples count towards representation. Though it was not overwhelming control, it came out to approximately 18 additional representatives in the House.\n\nRatification: The Supremacy Clause v The Bill of Rights: The final Compromise.\n\nHaving addressed the concerns of the small states and slave states, the delegates created a structure for a strong national government. To ensure the sovereign power of the central government, the delegates created the “Supremacy Clause,” that the Constitution and national laws would be the supreme law of the land, and the power to create any laws “necessary and proper” to implement provisions to taxation, defense, and commerce.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe delegates created a procedure to ratify the Constitution. As many knew the possibly controversial compromises in the document and that under the Articles of Confederation - still the current law of the land in September 1787- they would need the unanimous consent of the states, the delegates did not submit the document to the state legislatures. Instead, they arbitrarily specified that the Constitution would be ratified by the approval of nine of the thirteen states in special voting conventions.\n\nThe ratification debate began in early 1788, and factions supporting and opposing the Constitution quickly arose. Supporters called themselves the Federalists, and opponents called themselves the Antifederalists- early precursors of the political parties that would form during the creation of the U.S. government under the Constitution. Among the many issues, the most important for the Antifederalists was a lack of a declaration of individual rights to protect citizens from the “supremacy” of the federal government.\n\nFederalists: Those who advocated for a strong federal government after the American Revolution and during the Constitutional Convention and the early administrations of the U.S. Government.\n\nAnti-Federalists: Those who opposed the strong central government created in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn a final act of compromise to ensure states with strong Antifederalist sentiment would ratify the new government, it was proposed that the first act of the government would also be to ratify a Bill of Rights, protecting explicit freedoms, protecting state's rights, and limited the extent of the federal government.\n\nWith that final compromise, the state conventions began their debates over the ratification of the new government and, over the next two years, approved the U.S. Constitution:\n\nDelaware: December 7, 1787,\n\nPennsylvania: December 12, 1787\n\nNew Jersey: December 18, 1787\n\nGeorgia: January 2, 1788\n\nConnecticut: January 9, 1788\n\nMassachusetts: February 6, 1788\n\nMaryland: April 28, 1788\n\nSouth Carolina: May 23, 1788\n\nNew Hampshire: June 21, 1788\n\nVirginia: June 25, 1788\n\nNew York: July 26, 1788\n\nNorth Carolina: November 21, 1789\n\nRhode Island: May 29, 1790\n\nThe Constitutional Convention - Key takeaways\n\nIn 1786, several events exposed the inherent weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation. In August, Shays’ Rebellion broke out in Massachusetts, showing the ineptitude of the federal government to intervene during a national crisis.\n\nIn May 1787, 55 delegates arrived in Philadelphia. They came from every state except Rhode Island, where the state legislature opposed any changes to the Articles of Confederation to increase central authority. The delegates were men of property: merchants, slaveholding planters, and other men of wealth and means.\n\nThe delegates unanimously elected George Washington to preside over the convention.\n\nThe delegates debated a number of compromises to create a new government, the major compromises are known as the Great Compromise (about representation) and the three-fifths Compromise (about slavery).\n\nThe Convention quickly settled other state-related issues by restricting the extent of Federal control\n\nThe final compromise was the addition of the Bill of Rights explicitly protecting individual rights from the Federal government, this compromise was made to ensure the Constitution would be ratified by the required 9 out of 13 states.\n\n1.
