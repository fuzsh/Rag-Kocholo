        "text": "For over 230 years, the Constitution has served as the supreme law of the United States. Before the Constitution, the Articles of Confederation was the ruling document. But it had its problems, including the extremely limited power it gave to the central government.\n\nSo, the founding fathers decided to write the Constitution to create an effective, powerful federal government with checks and balances.\n\nBut when was the Constitution written and when was it ratified? Here is what you need to know about the U.S. Constitution's creation, plus a rundown of the Bill of Rights.\n\nWhen was the Constitution written?\n\nThe United States Constitution was written in 1787.\n\nIt was written during the Philadelphia Convention, now known as the Constitutional Convention. This took place from May 25 to Sept. 17, 1787.\n\nWhat are the requirements to be president? Qualifications to be the Commander-in-Chief\n\nHow many stripes are on the American flag? Here's what the 13 stripes on the US flag represent.\n\nWhat is the Constitution?\n\nThe Constitution is the United States' main framework, defining how the country and its government operates. It is \"the world’s longest surviving written charter of government.\"\n\nThe Constitution lays out the structure of the government into three branches: the legislative, executive and judicial. It provides a system of checks and balances for separation of power.\n\nIt also contains laws, regulations and rules under which the U.S., its citizens and government are provided and must follow.\n\nWhen was the Constitution ratified?\n\nThe Constitution was ratified in 1788. In order for the Constitution to be adopted, nine of the 13 states had to ratify it.\n\nRatification is \"the process of making an agreement official,\" according to the Cambridge Dictionary. In order for something to be ratified, the state must approve whatever the item is, whether it be a constitution, treaty or contract law. After ratification, the document is made law and must be followed.\n\nDelaware was the first state to ratify the Constitution on Dec. 7, 1787. After it was ratified by New Hampshire – the ninth state – on June 22, 1788, the Constitution was made official. March 9, 1789, became the official date the Confederation Congress operated under the Constitution.\n\nThe last state to ratify the Constitution was Rhode Island on May 29, 1790.\n\nJust Curious? We're here to help with life's everyday questions\n\nWhat are the three branches of government? Executive, Judicial, Legislative branches explained.\n\nWho wrote the Constitution?\n\nJames Madison is often considered the \"Father of the Constitution\"since he wrote the document that served as the model for the Constitution. Although his ideas and notes were influential, Madison was not the only one to contribute to the Constitution.\n\nAccording to the Constitution Center, many others made important contributions, especially those on the Committee of Detail and Committee of Style. These include:\n\nOliver Ellsworth\n\nNathaniel Gorham\n\nEdmund Randolph\n\nJohn Rutledge\n\nJames Wilson\n\nAlexander Hamilton\n\nWilliam Johnson\n\nRufus King\n\nGouverneur Morris\n\nAdditionally, George Washington and Benjamin Franklin are noted as other significant delegates who were involved in writing the Constitution.\n\nHow old do you have to be to be president? What running for the highest office requires.\n\nHow many amendments does the Constitution have?\n\nWhen the founders wrote the Constitution, they laid out a process where it could be amended, or changed. Today, there are 27 amendments to the Constitution.\n\nWhat is the highest court in the United States? About the US court system.\n\nWhat is the Bill of Rights?\n\nThe first 10 amendments are known as the Bill of Rights. They were ratified on Dec. 15, 1791. The Bill of Rights outlines civil rights and individual liberties guaranteed to those who live in the U.S.\n\nIn simple terms, the Bill of Rights states:\n\nFirst Amendment: Freedom of speech, press, assembly, protest and religion\n\nSecond Amendment: Right to bear arms\n\nThird Amendment: Prohibits military from quartering in private homes\n\nFourth Amendment: Prohibits government from unreasonable search and seizure of individuals or their private property\n\nFifth Amendment: Provides rights for criminal and civil proceedings, such as grand jury and no imprisonment without due process of law\n\nSixth Amendment: Gives additional protections to those accused of crimes, including the right to speedy and public trial and trial by an impartial jury\n\nSeventh Amendment: The right to a jury trial in federal civil cases\n\nEighth Amendment: Prohibits excessive bail and fines, and cruel and unusual punishment\n\nNinth Amendment: States that people are guaranteed other rights even if not explicitly listed in the Constitution\n\nTenth Amendment: States the federal government only has power based on the Constitution.
