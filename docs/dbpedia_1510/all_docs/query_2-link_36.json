        "text": "Amdt27.2.1 Debates in the Federal Convention on Congressional Compensation\n\nTwenty-Seventh Amendment:\n\nNo law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.\n\nThe concerns that motivated the proposal and ratification of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment grew out of debates at the Federal Convention about compensating Members of Congress. Prior to the Constitution’s drafting, many of Great Britain’s American colonies—and, later, the states in their constitutions—adopted the British House of Common’s “ancient practice” of compensating legislators for their services. Generally, state legislators set their compensation by law, which was paid out of the state’s treasury. Similarly, under the Articles of Confederation, states were responsible for compensating their delegates to the Confederation Congress. As Justice Joseph Story noted in his Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, the American preference for compensating legislators had a longstanding pedigree. Its purposes were to ensure that a pool of talented people from all economic backgrounds would serve as legislators and to reduce the potential for corruption that might result if legislators received compensation from other sources. These historical practices informed the Framers’ deliberations at the 1787 Constitutional Convention.\n\nAt the beginning of the Federal Convention in Philadelphia, Virginia Governor and Convention delegate Edmund Randolph proposed a blueprint for the national government in a series of resolutions known as the “Virginia Plan.” This plan addressed compensation for Members of the proposed bicameral national legislature. An early draft stated that Members of the Senate and House of Representatives would receive “liberal stipends, by which they may be compensated for the devotion of their time to public service.”\n\nConvention delegates debated the issue of congressional compensation on many occasions. Concerns about legislator corruption featured prominently in these discussions. During several debates, the delegates argued about whether Members of Congress’ compensation should be determined by the Constitution, the Members themselves, or the state governments. An ancillary debate about Congress’ power to set its pay grew out of these discussions.\n\nOne group of delegates maintained that the Constitution should “fix” salaries for Members of Congress according to an objective standard. During one June 1787 debate, James Madison argued that it would be “an indecent thing” to permit Members of Congress to “regulate their own wages.” Madison believed that the Members of the national legislature would be “too much interested to ascertain their own compensation” and that they might “put their hands into the public purse for the sake of their own pockets.” Instead of adopting this “dangerous” path, Madison proposed tying Members’ salaries to the average price of a commodity, such as wheat.\n\nOther delegates disagreed with Madison’s view and argued that Members of Congress should determine their compensation by law. For example, Nathaniel Gorham, a delegate from Massachusetts, contended that Members of Congress should have the flexibility to adjust their salaries “from time to time,” noting that state legislators had often done so without incident. Under this proposal, Members’ salaries would be paid out of the national treasury and Congress could adjust its compensation in order to take account of future circumstances.\n\nA third group of Convention delegates argued that each state government—rather than the Constitution or Congress—should determine compensation for its Members of Congress, which would be paid out of the state’s treasury. Delegates who supported this arrangement argued that it would allow each state to adopt the amount of compensation that it deemed reasonable and prevent states from unwillingly contributing a disproportionate amount of funds to Members’ salaries. Proponents also maintained that, by setting Members’ compensation, states could ensure that Senators, whom state legislatures would elect, would not “lose sight of their constituents” when serving in the nation’s capital.\n\nDelegates who opposed allowing each state to determine its own Members’ compensation independently of the other states, such as Alexander Hamilton, contended that this arrangement would allow state legislatures to exercise too much control over Members of Congress. In this vein, opponents noted that individual states would control Members’ salaries despite the fact that “the whole nation has an interest in the attendance and services of [all of] the members.” Opponents also argued that frugal states might reduce salaries to such a degree that talented people would not want to serve in Congress."
