        "text": "The Constitutional Convention, also known as the Philadelphia Convention, met in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from May 25 to September 17, 1787. It is considered one of the most significant events in the history of the United States as it created the United States Constitution.\n\nOf the 13 original states only Rhode Island did not send representatives. Twelve states appointed 70 individuals to the Constitutional Convention, only 55 attended and 39 signed the Constitution.\n\nBenjamin Franklin was the oldest delegate at 81 years old. The youngest was Jonathan Dayton, representative from New Jersey, he was 26.\n\nFranklin had written a speech that he planned giving on the last day of the Convention, Monday September 17, 1787, before the signing of the Constitution. He was too weak to deliver it and had James Wilson read it to the audience.\n\nThe original document did not include many rights and freedoms considered part of the American identity and did not resolve slavery. Many representatives feared the new federal government would overpower the state governments and the liberties that many states had put into their own laws.\n\nThe need for a union was necessary. Many states could not agree on a border, others wanted to expand to the west. The purpose of the new constitutions was to work together to defeat the British\n\nDelegates to the Constitutional Convention\n\nConnecticut\n\nOliver Ellsworth\n\nWilliam Samuel Johnson\n\nRoger Sherman\n\nDelaware\n\nRichard Bassett\n\nGunning Bedford Jr.\n\nJacob Broom\n\nJohn Dickinson\n\nGeorge Read\n\nGeorgia\n\nAbraham Baldwin\n\nWilliam Few\n\nWilliam Houstoun\n\nWilliam Pierce\n\nMaryland\n\nDaniel Carroll\n\nLuther Martin\n\nJames McHenry\n\nJohn Francis Mercer\n\nDaniel of St Thomas Jenifer\n\nMassachusetts\n\nElbridge Gerry\n\nNathaniel Gorham\n\nRufus King\n\nCaleb Strong\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNicholas Gilman\n\nJohn Langdon\n\nNew Jersey\n\nDavid Brearley\n\nJonathan Dayton\n\nWilliam Houston\n\nWilliam Livingston\n\nWilliam Paterson\n\nNew York\n\nAlexander Hamilton\n\nJohn Lansing Jr.\n\nRobert Yates\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilliam Blount\n\nWilliam Richardson Davie\n\nAlexander Martin\n\nRichard Dobbs Spaight\n\nHugh Wiliamson\n\nPennsylvania\n\nGeorge Clymer\n\nThomas Fitzsimons\n\nBenjamin Franklin\n\nJared Ingersoll\n\nThomas Mifflin\n\nGouverneur Morris\n\nRobert Morris\n\nJames Wilson\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nPierce Butler\n\nCharles Cotesworth Pinckney\n\nCharles Pinckney\n\nJohn Rutledge\n\nVirginia\n\nJohn Blair\n\nJames Madison\n\nGeorge Mason\n\nJames McClurg\n\nEdmund Randolph\n\nGeorge Washington\n\nGeorge Wythe\n\nRhode Island did not send representatives to the Convention.\n\nBenjamin Franklin’s Speech at the Constitutional Convention\n\nI confess that there are several parts of this constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them: For having lived long, I have experienced many instances of being obliged by better information, or fuller consideration, to change opinions even on important subjects, which I once thought right, but found to be otherwise. It is therefore that the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment, and to pay more respect to the judgment of others. Most men indeed as well as most sects in Religion, think themselves in possession of all truth, and that wherever others differ from them it is so far error. Steele a Protestant in a Dedication tells the Pope, that the only difference between our Churches in their opinions of the certainty of their doctrines is, the Church of Rome is infallible and the Church of England is never in the wrong. But though many private persons think almost as highly of their own infallibility as of that of their sect, few express it so naturally as a certain french lady, who in a dispute with her sister, said “I don’t know how it happens, Sister but I meet with no body but myself, that’s always in the right-Il n’y a que moi qui a toujours raison.”\n\nIn these sentiments, Sir, I agree to this Constitution with all its faults, if they are such; because I think a general Government necessary for us, and there is no form of Government but what may be a blessing to the people if well administered, and believe farther that this is likely to be well administered for a course of years, and can only end in Despotism, as other forms have done before it, when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic Government, being incapable of any other. I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able to make a better Constitution. For when you assemble a number of men to have the advantage of their joint wisdom, you inevitably assemble with those men, all their prejudices, their passions, their errors of opinion, their local interests, and their selfish views. From such an assembly can a perfect production be expected? It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies, who are waiting with confidence to hear that our councils are confounded like those of the Builders of Babel; and that our States are on the point of separation, only to meet hereafter for the purpose of cutting one another’s throats. Thus I consent, Sir, to this Constitution because I expect no better, and because I am not sure, that it is not the best. The opinions I have had of its errors, I sacrifice to the public good. I have never whispered a syllable of them abroad. Within these walls they were born, and here they shall die. If every one of us in returning to our Constituents were to report the objections he has had to it, and endeavor to gain partizans in support of them, we might prevent its being generally received, and thereby lose all the salutary effects & great advantages resulting naturally in our favor among foreign Nations as well as among ourselves, from our real or apparent unanimity. Much of the strength & efficiency of any Government in procuring and securing happiness to the people, depends, on opinion, on the general opinion of the goodness of the Government, as well as well as of the wisdom and integrity of its Governors. I hope therefore that for our own sakes as a part of the people, and for the sake of posterity, we shall act heartily and unanimously in recommending this Constitution (if approved by Congress & confirmed by the Conventions) wherever our influence may extend, and turn our future thoughts & endeavors to the means of having it well administred.\n\nOn the whole, Sir, I can not help expressing a wish that every member of the Convention who may still have objections to it, would with me, on this occasion doubt a little of his own infallibility, and to make manifest our unanimity, put his name to this instrument.-"
