        "text": "Content Description Notes that Mr. [Rufus] King will inform Knox of \"everything,\" that is, events that recently transpired at the Massachusetts State ratifying convention. Writes, \"The [sic] was a necessity in the Convention of mentioning Rhode Island as having prohibited the attendance of their members in Congress- an advertizm has appeared in order to give a false colour to that business- and a use is intended to be made of it at the meeting of the Legislature- I have therefore written in the inclosed Letter to Mr K requesting him to get me copies of every thing relative to that affair & to forward it through you by the first Post...\" Signatory of the U.S. Constitution. Additional Information Gorham was a delegate to the Massachusetts state convention, which ratified the Federal Constitution in February 1788. Rhode Island declined attending the Philadelphia Convention that ratified the Federal Constitution; as a state, Rhode Island was last to ratify the Constitution, doing so in May 1790."
