        "text": "Gorham enters his senior year as a co-captain and the vocal team leader. He has missed two full seasons on the court due to an NCAA ruling and a torn ACL, but his knowledge of the sport and his leadership skills will be vital to the Bears’ young squad. With 44 career wins and a Bruno Award for his team-minded and tenacious attitude, Gorham has looked great this past fall and is primed to lead the Bears to the post season this spring.\n\nAs a junior, Gorham came in with much to prove. Coming off a major injury, he demonstrated that his hard work and great athleticism were still there. In his first event of the year, he advanced to the finals of the Northeast Intercollegiate Championships, and then led Brown at the Bruno Classic in Memory of Margaux Powers with a 6-0 weekend record. Gorham’s game was getting to an extremely high level as he was leading his team to a near upset of #17 Wake Forest, but a fluke shoulder injury on the team’s Florida trip plagued him during the Ivy Season. Even so, he was able to clinch a huge home win against Princeton in a 7-6 in the third triumph at #3 singles to take the Bears to a 2-0 Ivy record at the time.\n\nGorham is from Los Altos Hills, California where he graduated from Los Altos Hills High School. He trained at the Weil Academy in Southern California, where he achieved the #1 ranking in the section in the 14's and was #5 in the US. At one point he broke Pete Sampras’ junior record for most consecutive Southern California tournament championships. He also trained in Barcelona, Spain as well as at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. While traveling across the world playing in the 16 and under age group, he earned an ITF rank of #583. Gorham ended his junior career ranked #10 in the Northern California section and #47 in the nation in the 18's age group.\n\nGorham is concentrating his studies in history. His interests include music, movies, and playing guitar. His favorite food is anything out of the sea, and he plays golf whenever he can. He enjoys solitaire and big-game hunting.\n\nGorham's parents are Nathaniel Gorham and Jan Shuler. They currently reside in Los Altos Hills, California."
