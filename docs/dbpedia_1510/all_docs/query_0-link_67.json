        "text": "Introduction\n\nBilly Jo Lara, a Turtle Mountain Native American, struck a federal officer on the Spirit Lake Reservation. He was then tried, in succession, before the Spirit Lake Tribal Court and the Federal District Court for the District of North Dakota. Having already served ninety days in prison for his tribal conviction, Lara claimed double jeopardy before the federal tribunal, triggering two questions: (1) whether the tribal conviction was issued by a separate sovereign (thus precluding the double jeopardy claim), and (2) whether Congress had the power to adjust trfibal sovereignty as it had in 1991, permitting one tribe (Spirit Lake) jurisdiction over a member of another tribe (Turtle Mountain).\n\nUpon arrival at the Supreme Court, United States v. Lara required the Court to address the largest controversy in Native American law: the tension between tribal sovereignty and congressional plenary power over tribes. Justice Stephen Breyer, writing for the Court, summarily concluded that the tribes are sovereign, resting on Congress’s acceptance of Chief Justice John Marshall’s designation of the tribes as “domestic dependent nations.” Justice Breyer then turned to the more convoluted history of congressional plenary power over tribes. He recognized that plenary power had traditionally derived from the combined weight of the Indian Commerce Clause and the treaty power. In elaborating on the grants of both constitutional provisions, Justice Breyer rested on previous Court decisions in affirming that the “central function of the Indian Commerce Clause . . . is to provide Congress with plenary power to legislate in the field of Indian affairs.” The treaty power, on the other hand, “does not literally authorize Congress to act legislatively, for it is an Article II power authorizing the President, not Congress, ‘to make Treaties.’” However, “treaties made pursuant to that power can authorize Congress to deal with matters with which otherwise Congress could not deal.”\n\nYet the treaty power was no longer doing the textual work for Indian affairs: as Justice Breyer admitted, “in 1871 Congress ended the practice of entering into treaties with the Indian tribes.” No matter, however, as “this Court has explicitly stated that the statute in no way affected Congress’ plenary powers to legislate on problems of Indians.” Additionally, as Indian affairs “were more an aspect of military and foreign policy than a subject of domestic or municipal law” during the nation’s first century, “Congress’ legislative authority would rest in part, not upon affirmative grants of the Constitution, but upon the Constitution’s adoption of preconstitutional powers necessarily inherent in any Federal Government, namely, powers that this Court has described as necessary concomitants of nationality.” Thus, with the evisceration of the president’s power to treat with the tribes, the plenary power to regulate Indian affairs was lodged in the Indian Commerce Clause and in “necessary,” “preconstitutional” powers that had some origin in foreign and military policy.\n\nAlthough concurring in the judgment, Justice Clarence Thomas castigated the majority for “utterly” failing to find any enumerated power justifying Congress’s plenary power to alter tribal sovereignty. With regard to the treaty power, he thought it “the one mechanism that the Constitution clearly provides for the Federal Government to interact with sovereigns other than the States” and thus regarded the congressional act abrogating tribal treaty-making with alarm. With regard to the Indian Commerce Clause, Justice Thomas was adamant that it did not provide plenary power over Indian affairs, and noted that the Court in United States v. Kagama had held such a construction of the Clause to be “very strained.” Elsewhere, Justice Thomas has regarded assertions of Congress’s plenary power as “inconsistent” with Indian Commerce Clause history. For the Founders, Indian commerce was Indian trade, and was further limited to tribes, not persons.\n\nJustices Breyer and Thomas’s debate in Lara not only encapsulates the tensions between tribal sovereignty and congressional plenary power, but also the array of scholarly opinions on point. While all modern scholars accept tribal sovereignty as a given, there is much disagreement over the origins of plenary power. Taking his cue from Justice Breyer, one scholar on the far left preaches Indian affairs as a “preconstitutional” federal power; whatever power the Indian Commerce Clause excludes is imbibed into the Constitution by “necessity.” Another pragmatist approach relies on international law and notions of “inherent sovereignty” that are outside of but not inconsistent with the Constitution to supply needed federal power over tribal affairs. A more moderate position draws on both pragmatist approaches and adds to them the totality of the Constitution’s discrete texts as grounded in the Washington administration’s accommodation in asserting general federal power to treat with and prospectively legislate concerning Natives. Yet another scholar looks carefully at the same textual sources before determining that no general power over Native Americans exists, but that each tribe requires individual treatment. Liberal originalists conclude that the Indian Commerce Clause may be read broadly to embrace all Indian affairs, while most conservative originalists follow Justice Thomas’s line that “commerce” is synonymous with “trade,” and that any expansive powers over Indian affairs are illegitimate. Each theory claims historical legitimacy, but none has been able to explain why the Indian Affairs Clause from the Articles of Confederation failed to appear in the Constitution.\n\nWhatever their disagreement over federal power as it touches Natives, all scholars and Indian affairs historians can agree with Justice Thomas when, in addressing the inherent inconsistencies between tribal sovereignty and congressional plenary power, he concluded: “Federal Indian policy is, to say the least, schizophrenic. And this confusion continues to infuse federal Indian law and our cases.” Commenting on the tension, Professor Philip Frickey decried the entire genre as “rooted in conflicting principles that leave the field in a morass of doctrinal and normative incoherence” and thus anomalous. Similarly, Professor Steven McSloy called the field “chaotic” and “confused,” and Professor Joseph Singer noted that the area of law is known for its “[c]onflicting lines of precedent and conflicting philosophies.” In this unique area of the law, the disharmony between sovereignty and plenary power is perpetuated by an unexplained textual shrinkage between the Articles of Confederation and Constitution that seems to suggest that the Framers made a mistake in drafting the Constitution.\n\nIn fact, the Framers did make a mistake, at least initially. This Article examines the drafting history of the Constitution and suggests a startling explanation for the omission of an Indian Affairs Clause: at its heart, an innocent but consequential scrivener’s error that was later made intentional. The Committee of Detail, tasked by the Constitutional Convention with producing a working draft of the Constitution, seems to have accidentally omitted an Indian Affairs Clause in preparing the first working draft of the Constitution. Not only was inclusion of a congressional power over Indian affairs compelled by its long prehistory and a unanimous vote by the Convention, but John Rutledge as Committee chair recorded a committee vote directing James Wilson to include it. The evidence indicates that Wilson meant to comply with the command: not only was he personally motivated to comply, but he placed a check mark next to the Clause. However, he simply failed to include the power in his final draft.\n\nWhen James Madison caught the mistake, this time the Committee of Detail partially fixed the omission by inserting “Indians” into the Commerce Clause at the last moment, but intentionally omitted the Indian Affairs Clause, likely to expedite the text without controversy through the Convention. The error went unnoticed by the vast majority of the Convention, state ratifying conventions, and the public at large. It was later corrected by President George Washington and his administration via a multiclause approach to the Constitution that centered on executive treaty-making power. Nearly a century later, once tribal treaty-making was terminated by statute, the Supreme Court turned to other means of justifying a noncommercial Indian affairs plenary power.\n\nThis history raises serious questions for constitutional theory and federal Indian law policy. If the omission of the Indian affairs power was intentional, how does that impact the relationship between tribes and the federal government? Does congressional plenary power survive? How will the missing clause impact other Commerce Clause provisions? Does a congressional power over Indian affairs equate to plenary power? What will it mean for tribal-state relations, and treaty powers generally? If “Indian affairs” is intentionally missing from the Constitution, is the approach adopted in Lara adequate? These questions will require new tools, new methods, and new theory. The purpose of this Article is to raise these questions and address whether congressional plenary power survives what became an intentional omission of the Indian Affairs Clause, leaving further scholarship to propose comprehensive solutions for the remainder.\n\nHere, based on the assumption that matching constitutional text to powers in practice is optimal, this Article proposes that, without an Indian Affairs Clause, congressional plenary power over tribes is dealt a mighty if not mortal blow. Instead, to enable the federal government to address Indian affairs, this Article proposes the reinitiation of tribal treaty-making. This proposal takes its cue from President Washington: interpret the Constitution holistically as written, treating with Natives on noncommercial matters via the executive’s treaty power. Such a proposal is supported by the text, history, and structure of the Constitution, the recent trends in federal Indian law precedent, and many prudential reasons—including, most importantly, respect for tribal sovereignty and Native dignity.\n\nIn the three substantive sections that follow, this Article will first summarize the scholarly debate regarding congressional plenary power over tribes and the different strains of pre- and postenactment history upon which they rely. Second, it will carefully comb through Committee of Detail, Constitutional Convention, and ratification records to reconstruct the history of the missing clause. Finally, it will discuss the significance of the missing clause and propose the reinitiation of tribal treaty-making, outlining the various reasons for doing so.\n\nI. The Confused State of Indian Affairs\n\nThe omission of an Indian Affairs Clause led to a disjuncture between Congress’s plenary power over tribes in practice and the authorizing text of the Constitution. This schism has created confusion as scholars have sought to synthesize and bring harmony to this beleaguered area of constitutional law. Scholarly opinions run the gamut, and each explicitly or implicitly partakes of a particular pre- or postconstitutional historical approach to tribes. However, all have missed the true cause of the problem, plaguing their various diagnoses and prognoses, and failing to provide clarity and direction to this chaotic area of law.\n\nA. The Pragmatists: Pre- and Extraconstitutional Powers\n\nThe ways and means by which scholars of federal Indian law have addressed the plenary power disparity between text and practice are aptly reflected or presaged by Justices Breyer’s and Thomas’s opinions in Lara. On one side of the spectrum, Professor Matthew Fletcher picks up on the verbiage utilized by Justice Breyer in identifying Indian affairs as a “preconstitutional” federal power inherited by the federal government under the new Constitution, of which the Commerce Clause vests only a part. The remainder of these powers should be ascribed to the federal government by “necessity.” Says Fletcher, “Originalists . . . [are] unwilling or unable to recognize the history of federal-tribal relations because that history is not reflected in the Constitution.” Fletcher partakes here in a much larger literature on inherent sovereignty centering on the constitutionally unfettered foreign affairs power from United States v. Curtiss-Wright, which limited the doctrine of enumerated powers to “internal affairs” and espoused international powers as “necessary concomitants of nationality” whether or not found in the Constitution. Professor Sarah Cleveland postulated that Justice George Sutherland’s inherent-sovereignty argument in Curtiss-Wright is partly founded in the expansive late nineteenth-century view of Congress’s tribal plenary power that fully flowered in Kagama: the lack of constitutional text and the fact that tribal members fell outside of the Constitution’s protections and traditional state boundaries gave rise to a plenary power rooted not in the Constitution, but in the necessities of sovereignty.\n\nAlthough Kagama claims no basis in history other than naked discovery, Fletcher’s history is largely on point: the area of Indian affairs was separate and distinct from Indian commerce, and the former did not always embrace the latter. Both operated as separate administrative structural concepts and legal terms of art, with Indian commerce being informed by the practicalities of Indian affairs. Prior to and even concurrent with the Constitution’s enactment, “Indian affairs” was a thriving area of federal and royal administration that was distinct from Indian trade or commerce. Before 1789, while Indian affairs and trade fluctuated between local and centralized control, the two bodies of law were often addressed and administered by the same personnel but treated separately based on their distinct concerns. During the earlier colonial period in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the local colonial government—under loose and sporadic oversight from the London Board of Trade and other European epicenters with colonies in North America—managed transacting with Natives, whether through learning new agricultural techniques, conducting land acquisitions, or waging war and peace. Here, the London Board of Trade’s governance role indicates that the administration of Indian affairs grew out of the need to compete with the French and regulate the fur trade with the Natives, which was conducted by licensed and independent private traders.\n\nBeginning in the early 1700s, the British Crown exercised increasing control over Indian affairs, climaxing with its Proclamation of 1763 and waning thereafter due to an excess of efficient administration. Land disputes—the most famous of them being the Mohegan’s seventy-year suit filed in 1703 with the Privy Council against Connecticut for violations of aboriginal title granted under treaties and agreements dating between 1659 and 1681—gave rise to increasing control by the Crown. Of equal importance to the British was competing with the French and Spanish for access to Indian trade routes, which helped to spark the French and Indian War. In response to disputes over Native land and trade, Archibald Kennedy, a New York Council member, recommended to the Board of Trade in 1751 that Indian affairs in the British North American colonies be overseen by a single superintendent. This recommendation ultimately resulted in the Albany Congress of 1754, wherein Benjamin Franklin reported a draft Plan of Union for the colonies, with Indian affairs featuring among the first topics addressed. Under this plan, it was proposed that the “President General” would\n\nhold or direct all Indian Treaties . . . and make peace or declare War with the Indian Nations. That they make such Laws as they judge necessary for the regulating all Indian Trade. That they make all purchases from Indians for the Crown, of lands [now] not within the bounds of particular Colonies, or that shall not be within their bounds when some of them are reduced to more convenient dimensions. That they make new settlements on such purchases by granting Lands, [in the King’s name] reserving a Quit rent to the Crown, for the use of the General Treasury.\n\nFranklin thus laid out all that was later comprehended by Indian “Trade” and “Affairs” under the Articles of Confederation, while also highlighting the complicated and delicate balance of power between central authorities and the colonies-cum-states.\n\nThe draft plan was accompanied by a report on the state of Indian affairs for the Board of Trade that complained of corruption and private gain, land fraud (or inadequate consideration for land sales), and the illegal sale of rum to the Natives. Colonel William Johnson authored a parallel report recommending more coordination “between the several [colonial] Govern[ments] . . . in regard to Indian affairs” to combat the French. Almost simultaneously, the Board of Trade recommended to the Crown that management of Indian affairs be brought under one head (Johnson’s) and, after reviewing the Albany reports, emphasized the importance of separating private trading interests and the public administration of Indian affairs. Other than Johnson’s appointment to superintend Indian affairs with the Six Nations in the North and West and, later, Edmond Atkin’s and then John Stuart’s appointments to administer affairs in the South, any action on the foregoing reports was scuttled by the outbreak of war with the French. The tide had turned, however, and the British were more active in managing Indian affairs, including proscribing private land acquisitions. Indian trade was left more to local colonial management.\n\nAfter the war, to secure its peace, Britain emphasized the importance of Indian trade as a means to improve general affairs. Emphasizing that “a well Regulated Trade with the Indians is and ever will be the most natural and the most efficacious means to improve and extend His Majesty’s Indian Interest” and that treaties regarding native lands should be “religiously observed,” Johnson recommended expanding the Crown’s management of both “Indian Affairs and Trade” through the establishment of an office in the North American colonies. Further Anglo-American settlement was halted and centralized under the Board of Trade, whereupon applications for trading outposts and settlements near French-controlled Canada (and in formerly French-controlled areas) poured in. British encroachment fomented Native rebellion in the form of Pontiac’s War, which prompted the creation of new boundary lines that featured in King George III’s Proclamation of 1763. The Proclamation also treated land acquisitions and trade separately, with the former to be managed by London, and the latter by both colonial governors—who issued trading licenses to all British subjects—and the Crown’s “Commissaries,” who regulated the trade. The Board of Trade thereafter recommended a comprehensive plan to effectuate the Proclamation, but it was stillborn. The plan failed due to high marginal costs and the lowered threat posed by the French and Native tribes made possible by the very efficiency that produced the plan.\n\nBritish understanding became American, and affairs and trade with Natives were treated as distinct concerns and even administered separately. During the Revolution, Indian affairs reached war and peace, land acquisitions, and powers incidental to these main headings: protection, border policing, and gift giving. Almost immediately after Lexington and Concord, American commissioners set out to persuade the Six Nations and other tribes to enter the war on their side. Throughout the war, the thrust of Indian affairs continued to be war and peace, but any attempts to convince Natives to side with the rebels were largely futile, with tribes opting for the familiar and stronger British ally. Beyond cultivating them as allies, Congress also attempted to devise a plan for “carrying on trade with the Indians,” designating a separate committee for the purpose.\n\nCongressional powers of treaty-making and trade with Native tribes informed the language of the Articles of Confederation, as did the confederated structure wherein states still held the balance of power. Benjamin Franklin, who had authored the Albany Plan, dealt with Native Nations in two parts of his draft of the Articles of Confederation, reported on July 21, 1775. Article X proscribed colonies (soon to be states) from waging war sua sponte, and Article XI dealt with land disputes and acquisitions and ensured the presence of agents to protect and regulate trade. No mention was made of state regulation. A later draft also treated the two related areas of law individually, giving the central government the sole and exclusive power of “[r]egulating the Indian Trade, and managing all Indian Affairs with the Indians.” The final version of the Articles of Confederation contained less detail, but also treated trade and affairs individually. Penned by John Dickinson in 1776, passed by Congress on November 15, 1777, and finally ratified by all states on March 1, 1781, Article IX read in relevant part:\n\nThe United States, in Congress assembled, shall also have the sole and exclusive right and power of . . . regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the Indians, not members of any of the States; provided that the legislative right of any State, within its own limits, be not infringed or violated.\n\nTreaty-making and legislation under the Articles followed suit. As they were not mentioned in the 1783 Treaty of Paris, Congress set about to make peace with tribes who had allied with the British in the Revolution. After lengthy discussion based on Pennsylvania’s petition to treat with western tribes in purchasing lands for war veterans, Congress approved a treaty conference with northern and western district tribes on October 15, 1783, to which Pennsylvania commissioners would be invited and provided “every assistance” in promoting state interests consistent with the “general interest of the Union.” This authorization resulted in the Treaty at Fort Stanwix with the Six Nations on October 22, 1784, which dealt with hostages, the establishment of a western boundary, land guarantees to Natives, and a cession of land to the United States. A similar treaty was entered into at Fort M’Intosh with the Wiandot, Delaware, Chippewa, and Ottawa on January 21, 1785, adding that Natives murdering or robbing a citizen of the United States would be delivered up for punishment by the same. These treaties were thus limited to nontrade matters.\n\nIn 1785, Congress issued authorization for commissioners in the South to conduct treaty conferences to establish land boundaries, regulate fair trade with Natives, and notify the governors of the affected states. This authorization resulted in three successive treaties at Hopewell with the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw. These treaties reflected similar provisions to their predecessors, but added that tribes could send delegations to Congress and assured the liberty of traders while guaranteeing that “the United States in Congress assembled shall have the sole and exclusive right of regulating the trade with the Indians, and managing all their affairs in such manner as they think proper.” A final treaty was entered into with the Shawnee on January 31, 1786, without the trade provisions; all four southern treaties were approved by Congress on April 17, 1786, a year before the convening of the Constitutional Convention.\n\nIn the aftermath of this treaty-making with the various regions, Congress turned its attention to comprehensive legislation regulating Indian trade in “An Ordinance for [R]egulating the Indian Department.” Whereas states still vied for a role in treating over Native lands, debate over the proposed statute revealed a consensus in favor of centralized Indian trade regulation. Delegates of Georgia and North Carolina, where Cherokee and other southern tribes (with whom those states had separately treated) resided, repeatedly sought without success to secure a role for states in regulating Indian trade. Yet even New York, normally opposed along with Pennsylvania and Virginia to national regulation of land cessions and border disputes, was firm in recognizing national authority to regulate trade.\n\nNow that a consensus appeared to have congealed around federal trading power with Native Nations, the next year, in 1787, efforts were made to secure another major piece of legislation. This sought to shore up confederated power over both Indian trade and affairs after attacks by Natives on Virginian frontiers and land disputes between Creeks and Georgians threatened open hostilities. Ironically, this act was discussed in the Continental Congress even while the Convention sat, forgetting and then omitting Indian affairs. The disparity in treatment between the two bodies is highlighted by the overlap in membership between Congress and the Convention. In fact, at least three members of the Constitutional Convention—William Few of Georgia, William Blount of North Carolina, and Pierce Butler of South Carolina —used the break allotted for the work of drafting the Constitution by the Committee of Detail from July 24 to August 6, 1787, to travel to New York and attend to their congressional duties. Four days before the Committee of Detail reported a draft of the Constitution that contained no mention of Indian trade or affairs, Nathan Dane of Massachusetts reported for the congressional committee on Indian affairs in New York. Responding to Henry Knox’s July 10 and 18, 1787, reports on the Virginia border and Georgia-Creek disputes, Dane identified the ambiguous language respecting Indian affairs in the Articles as “embarrassing” having set federal efforts at odds with the states. A correct interpretation of the Articles’ language, Dane maintained, was based on long-standing precedent:\n\nThe committee conceive that . . . in managing affairs with [the Natives], the principal objects have been those of making war and peace, purchasing certain tracts of their lands, fixing the boundaries between them and our people, and preventing the latter settling on lands left in possession of the former. The powers necessary to these objects appear to the committee to be indivisible, and that the parties to the confederation must have intended to give them entire to the Union, or to have given them entire to the State.\n\nPower over Indian affairs, including power over Indian trade (but which was treated individually), was indivisible due to its very nature. Dane’s argument was ultimately successful: on October 26, 1787, five weeks after the Convention adjourned (with the absent congressmen from Philadelphia again attending), the Continental Congress authorized solely northern and southern Indian commissioners to treat with tribes.\n\nThis history demonstrates that both Indian affairs and trade were preconstitutional powers as articulated by Fletcher. The two bodies of law were closely related and often (but not always) administered together, but treated separately and distinctly within the law. The law of Indian trade related to the private conduct of Indian traders, including licensing; banning unethical practices such as selling firearms, rum and other spirits, and other prohibited items to Natives; and establishing or protecting trading posts and routes. The law and administration of Indian affairs related to intergovernmental relationships between various levels of government and Native Nations, including identifying boundaries, preserving Native land and the ability to purchase it by particular governments, and maintaining legal relations between Natives and non-Natives. Indian affairs, a matter of public law, could but did not always embrace Indian trade, a matter of private law. Thus, according to Fletcher, the Indian Commerce Clause embraced all of preconstitutional Indian trade—but not all of Indian affairs.\n\nFletcher’s remaining arguments do not hold together as well. Fletcher maintains that the Constitution’s deficient statements regarding Indian Affairs give rise to a necessity that Congress, and perhaps the president, must derive power over Indian affairs from preconstitutional arrangements. Yet even despite the glaring textual problem with Fletcher’s argument, it should not end here. As explained below, preconstitutional federal powers over Natives were contested, or at least states made claims to having overlapping powers.\n\nProfessor Frickey expands on Fletcher’s pragmatist theme, but ties power over Natives more directly to the Constitution in a generalist way via international law: “[I]nherent in the Constitution, not outside the Constitution, are all those notions of inherent sovereignty under international law that are not inconsistent with constitutional text, structures, or institutional relationships.” International law, rather than direct constitutional grants, provides content for managing Native relations and guarantees to them human rights via international standards regarding indigenous peoples.\n\nB. The Holists and the Washington Settlement\n\nA more moderate approach is Professor Gregory Ablavsky’s carefully crafted holistic and intratextual reading of the Constitution’s treatment of Indian affairs in Beyond the Indian Commerce Clause. There, Ablavsky also focuses on the role of the supra- and preconstitutional law of nations, particularly on those international legal principles from the law of nations that influenced the Washington administration’s interpretation and implementation of the Constitution, in deducing plenary power. Implicitly acknowledging that affairs and commerce are not coterminous, this holistic interpretation asserts that congressional plenary power later asserted over Indian affairs did not necessarily derive from the Indian Commerce Clause, but had alternate sources of power in the Treaty, War Powers, Property, and Supremacy Clauses, as well as the extraconstitutional law of nations.\n\nAblavsky relies heavily on Secretary Henry Knox’s administration of Indian affairs both before and after the Constitution’s ratification. A month before the reinstitution of Indian affairs within the War Department under the new Constitution, Knox, the unexpectedly effective Revolutionary War artillery officer who carried over as Secretary of War, was advising President Washington of the state of tribal affairs. Importantly, Knox made a recommendation that would effectively ensure to the federal government the sole regulation of Indian affairs. After lamenting over past and ongoing state interference and Congress’s own botched tribal treaty negotiations, Knox suggested that\n\n[t]he independent nations and tribes of indians ought to be considered as foreign nations, not as the subjects of any particular state—each individual State indeed will retain the right of pre-emtion of all lands within its limits, which will not be abridged. But the general Sovereignty must possess the right of making all treaties on the execution or violation of which depend peace or war.\n\nEstablishing such a precedent, Knox continues, should be done via a “declarative Law” that would “reflect honor on the new government.” If tribes were treated as other nations, by implication, other aspects of the Constitution—the treaty power, and, Ablavsky adds, war and peace powers and the Territory and Supremacy Clauses —could be brought to bear on the federal government’s dealings with Native tribes.\n\nSurprisingly, Ablavsky does not highlight President Washington’s response, which adopted Knox’s recommendations wholesale. On this issue, President Washington initially availed himself of the advice and consent of the Senate in person, with Knox at his side, regarding a treaty with the Choctaw and Chickasaw. A month later, in a statement prepared by Knox and read by then–Vice President John Adams as Senate president on September 17, 1789, President Washington recommended that Indian tribes be treated as foreign nations:\n\nIt is said to be the general understanding and practice of nations, as a check on the mistakes and indiscretions of ministers or Commissioners, not to consider any treaty, negociated, and signed by such officers, as final and conclusive untill ratified by the sovereign or government from whom they derive their powers. [T]his practice has been adopted by the United States, respecting their treaties with european nations; and I am inclined to think it would be adviseable to observe it in the conduct of our treaties with the Indians: for tho’ such Treaties, being on their part made by their chiefs or rulers, need not be ratified by them, yet being formed on our part by the agency of subordinate officers, it seems to be both prudent and reasonable, that their acts should not be binding on the nation untill approved and ratified by the government. It strikes me that this point should be well considered and settled, so that our national proceedings in this respect may become uniform, and be directed by fixed and stable principles.\n\nThe Senate consented to President Washington’s request, and their “advice” came in the exact form Knox had anticipated: an Indian Trade and Intercourse Act passed in the summer of 1790, reflecting in modified format the “trade and affairs” language of the Articles. As a temporary act, it was reinstated in 1793, 1796, and 1799, with permanent versions enacted in 1802 and 1834. Acting through what the Senate considered as part of its executive powers under the Advice and Consent Clause, these early Congresses effectuated a legislative sleight of hand that skirted any contemporary textual qualms later raised by Justice Breyer in Lara—that the treaty power was lodged in the executive and that implementing legislation should follow ratification. Perhaps viewed as enacting legislation of the preconstitutional treaties, they incorporated language from the Hopewell Treaties into the initial 1790 legislation, albeit applying it to all tribes rather than just the Cherokee and other southern tribes.\n\nAlthough the executive continued to treat with tribes, the Trade and Intercourse Acts set a precedent of Congress legislating outside the scope of treaty negotiations, passing, in 1817 and again in 1819, acts decoupled from treaties regulating all Native Nations. The approach was also blessed by Chief Justice Marshall in Worcester v. Georgia: “From the commencement of our government, congress has passed acts to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indians; which treat them as nations, respect their rights, and manifest a firm purpose to afford that protection which treaties stipulate.” Chief Justice Marshall’s majority opinion reinforced the gloss that Congress had a concomitant legislative treaty power to match the president’s executive treaty power:\n\n[The Constitution] confers on congress the powers of war and peace; of making treaties, and of regulating commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes. These powers comprehend all that is required for the regulation of our intercourse with the Indians. They are not limited by any restrictions on their free actions.\n\nChief Justice Marshall’s decision proved durable. No new major legislation was enacted regarding Indian affairs until 1874, and the executive branch negotiated 348 treaties with Indian Tribes through 1868. Yet during Reconstruction, in 1871, Congress, through a House appropriations bill, annulled the president’s ability to treat with Native tribes, stripping them of Knox’s recognition as “independent nation[s]” and therefore deeming them unfit parties “with whom the United States may [not] contract by treaty.” Thus ended the Knox-Washington-congressional pact regarding Indian affairs and the intratextual approach subscribed to by Ablavsky.\n\nOne problem with Ablavsky’s holistic approach is his allusion to the Property Clause grounding the Washington administration’s assertion of power to treat with the Natives, implicitly empowering further administrations (and Congresses) to do likewise. Professor Saikrishna Prakash points to the practical impossibility of current Congresses regulating Indian affairs under this justification, in that the federal government owned only 0.7% of tribal land as of 2004. Indeed, even when tribes did occupy expansive tracts of U.S. territories, an antebellum Congress rejected an attempt to confederate tribal governments and subject them to a federally appointed governor under a Western Territory bill.\n\nPrakash, like Ablavsky, also looks beyond the Commerce Clause for other textual sources from which to derive power over Natives, but unlike Ablavsky, he finds the sum of the parts to be less than the whole. Prakash concludes that no part of the Constitution provides per se plenary power, but that tribes must be treated with individually, based on consummated treaties, tribal composition, and location.\n\nC. Originalists and Semantics\n\nIn contrast to the pragmatist or holistic viewpoint, liberal originalists home in on the Indian Commerce Clause to find justification for plenary power. Professor Akhil Amar looks to draft language from the Committee of Detail, the first Indian Trade and Intercourse Act passed in 1790, contemporary texts, and broad dictionary definitions to surmise that the original understanding of commerce as it pertained to Indians (and interstate and international transactions) was broad enough to encompass “all forms of intercourse in the affairs of life.” Professor Jack Balkin expands on this theme and highlights an amendment to the Virginia Plan submitted to the Committee of Detail—authorizing Congress to “legislate in all cases for the general interests of the Union, and also in those to which the States are separately incompetent”—as a guiding principle in interpreting all Commerce Clause subparts broadly. This Amar-Balkin interpretation squares with the Supreme Court’s holding in Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, quoted by Justice Breyer in Lara, that “the central function of the Indian Commerce Clause is to provide Congress with plenary power to legislate in the field of Indian affairs.” However, this view is at odds with Kagama, wherein the Court found such a broad reading “strained,” and whether implicitly conceding the point or not, the Lara Court’s decision seems to stand for the proposition that justifying full Indian affairs powers requires something more than just the Indian Commerce Clause.\n\nOther originalist scholars are not so permissive. Basing their interpretation largely on linguistics and on Professor Randy Barnett’s comprehensive word study from contemporary texts, most other originalist scholars interpret commerce as synonymous with trade, and, with Justice Thomas, believe plenary power exercised over Native tribes by means of the Indian Commerce Clause to be illegitimate. One study deals with the many iterations of the Indian Trade and Intercourse Acts and interprets each provision as falling short of recognizing a general plenary power over internal tribal relations.\n\nD. Field Preemption\n\nAblavsky’s holistic and extraconstitutional approach leads him to conclude that federal power over Indian affairs precludes state action in this area. This argument draws upon Professor Robert Clinton’s extensive treatment of Indian Affairs history in The Dormant Indian Commerce Clause. There, Clinton details the balance of power first between the British Crown and the colonials, and then between the Confederation Congress and the states. He asserts that after two centuries of controversy, a consensus arose in favor of plenary power and therefore national supremacy over Indian Affairs in the immediate prelude to the Constitutional Convention that is reflected in the Constitution’s text preempting state relations with Native Nations. Indeed, Clinton focuses upon the primary point of concern for colonies-cum-states when it came to dealing with tribes as reflected in the confused text of the Articles of Confederation. That nascent constitution recognized “sole and exclusive” power over Indian trade and affairs with two exceptions that seemed to swallow the rule: Natives who were “members” of the various states were excepted and the whole power was subject to the “legislative right[s]” of the individual states. Indeed, Madison discussed the Article’s befuddlement in Federalist 42, which “subvert[ed] a mathematical axiom, by taking away a part, and letting the whole remain.” The Confederation Congress was plagued by the controversy, and parallel vague language appeared in the 1786 Ordinance governing Indian affairs.\n\nThe controversy was even more animated out-of-doors. Just as colonies rebuffed royal efforts to consolidate power over Indian affairs between 1720 and 1776, states pushed back or wholly ignored asserted federal preeminence. In detailing the history of New York’s independent relations with Native Nations, Abraham Yates, Jr., complained bitterly of the encroachment the federal Constitution imposed on state power to treat with Natives as New York had done at Fort Stanwix prior to the federal treaty conference with the Six Nations in 1784 and during the many previous decades. Yates headed the local Indian affairs committee in Albany during the Revolution and personally treated with Native tribes in 1775. After quoting Article XXXVII of the New York Constitution, which provided that “no purchases or contracts for the sale of lands . . . with or of the Indians, within the limits of this State, shall be binding on the said Indians, or deemed valid, unless made under the authority and with the consent of the legislature of this state,” Yates condemns “the measures taken by Congress respecting the Indian affairs in this state” as violative of the quoted provision of the New York Constitution and the Articles relating to Indian affairs. Yates goes on to note the long history of New York individually treating with the “five nations” since 1664, and even earlier “whilst it was called New-Nederland under the Dutch” before quoting the language in the Articles that pertained to Indians “not members of any of the states” and listing grievances with treaties and the 1786 statute outlined above entered by Congress.\n\nGeorgia had been particularly aggressive about abrogating the Hopewell Treaties, electing instead to treat separately with the Natives, ceding land to themselves, encouraging settlement on lands allotted to tribes by federal commissioners, bringing the state to the brink of war with the Creeks on the eve of the Constitutional Convention, and unilaterally declaring war at its close in September 1787. The situation in North Carolina trailed close behind: in 1787, Henry Knox reported to Congress that unprovoked Anglo-American settlers seizing Native lands had attacked the Cherokees in that state. Virginia, where speculators laid claim to vast tracts of privately purchased Native lands, was not quite so aggressive when altercations over land broke out in its Kentucky regions, seeking the assistance of Congress before raising troops sufficient to launch their own attack. Congress later ratified the conduct and sent reinforcements. Pennsylvania also sought to treat with their western tribes in repaying veteran war debts with land, but first sought congressional approval, and respectfully demurred when its request was rebuffed. Although Clinton’s treatment of this history and that of the Convention in dealing with the Articles’ states’ rights language detailed below is quite nuanced and careful, he unsatisfactorily brushes over the textual history (at times with confused sequencing) of, and the discrepancies between, Indian commerce and affairs. In so doing, he prematurely concludes that the Indian Commerce Clause “obviously was intended to accomplish the objectives” of the Indian affairs text proposed by Madison (but not adopted) late in the Convention, supporting congressional plenary power and therefore federal preemption.\n\nIn contrast, Justice Thomas, relying on Professor Robert Natelson, reads concurrent state powers over all Native American relations outside of trade into the Indian Commerce Clause. For support, Justice Thomas and Natelson point to the many state attempts both before and after the Constitution to comanage tribal relations. As will be seen, while states generally recognized Congress’s power over treaties of war and peace, several tested the Articles to see how far Congress’s power to treat with Natives over land claims extended. Virginia attempted to condition the cessation of their western lands on the abdication of any other claims to the land via Native purchase. To this, Congress said such prejudgment would be “improper.” Pennsylvania requested time and again that Congress recognize their ability to treat with the Natives regarding land purchases “on their borders.” As many times as it importuned, Pennsylvania’s entreaties were rebuffed. New York also attempted to have Congress confirm its western land conveyances to soldiers in lieu of pay, unless such seemed to “irritate the Indians,” but in this it, too, was denied. North Carolina took greater advantage of the distance from Congress and actually treated separately with the Natives over land within its contested borders without asking for congressional permission, as did Georgia. Thus while it is true that states attempted to take advantage of the Articles’ ambiguous language, these attempts were met with varying degrees of success, and therefore Justice Thomas and Natelson’s historical conclusions are not necessarily warranted.\n\nIn another seminal article, The Savage Constitution, Ablavsky answers Clinton’s narrative identifying two competing national solutions to the federal-state contest as reflected in the Constitution: a paternalistic but diplomatic approach as executed by President Washington and an aggressive military solution expunging “savages” from coveted lands which eventually won the day under President Andrew Jackson. Professor Maggie Blackhawk accepts Ablavsky’s telling of history in building out an alternative public law paradigm. She categorizes those events that play out the diplomatic vision of the “Savage Constitution”—such as recognition of native tribes as sovereign by Chief Justice Marshall and the empowerment of tribes to self-govern under the Indian Reorganization Act—in the canon, and grounds “war powers doctrine [ ] in the Indian Wars” in the “anticanon.”\n\nYet while the controversy between centralized and localized power to treat with Natives is important in understanding the broad arc of Indian affairs, it can also prove distracting. Focusing on the intense disputes over federal-state power to treat with tribes has distracted scholars away from the puzzle of the missing clause in their attempts to explain the incoherence of Native American law, pitting tribal sovereignty, unanimously recognized, against the majority position of congressional plenary power. As will be seen, it also distracted the Framers when attempting to fix the Committee of Detail’s oversight, and perhaps rendered them reluctant to address the initial scrivener’s error head-on.\n\n* * *\n\nFor all of the flailing, scholars are failing to pinpoint the true cause of confusion. Each Indian affairs scholar highlights certain periods of history to justify their philosophy and findings regarding plenary power, yet none has made sense of it as a whole and sought to explain its glaring inconsistencies. In contrast to the long prehistory of federal Indian affairs regulation and grant of explicit power via the Articles, no corollary power is found in any discrete text of the Constitution. Though the U.S. Constitution was ostensibly designed to enlarge and empower the new Congress, in this one unexplained instance, the totality of federal powers shrank. No scholar has yet sought to synthesize and explain this historical puzzle.\n\nAdditionally, the efforts to find an alternative textual hook for plenary power and originalist backstepping demonstrate near consensus with the Kagama Court: situating plenary power in the Indian Commerce Clause strains credulity. This strain is exacerbated by the even higher stakes placed on the meaning of “commerce” in the interstate and international arenas. For, as Prakash has sought to demonstrate, the “presumption of intrasentence uniformity” means that the connotation of one portion of the Commerce Clause should translate into legal content for the other portions. Here, if Indian commerce means Indian trade, applying the presumption would dictate that Congress could only regulate interstate and international trade, undermining entire swaths of federal regulation from Gibbons v. Ogden to the present day.\n\nResolution of the confused state of Indian affairs jurisprudence and federal policy regarding plenary power is clarified through a correct diagnosis of the historical puzzle. Although talented legal minds have talked around it, hinted at it, nudged it, and nearly bumped into it, none thus far has been able to recognize the true cause of woe bedeviling the practice and legal justification for federal plenary power. The historical lurching and disjuncture between practice and text (and the ensuing two centuries of confusion) stems from a simple, significant oversight made in the bowels of the Constitutional Convention’s Committee of Detail, to which this Article now turns.\n\nII. The Missing Clause\n\nIndian affairs should be a congressional power listed separately in Article I, § 8 of the Constitution. Though both Indian affairs and trade had long preconstitutional pedigrees and were unanimously required for inclusion by the Convention, the Committee of Detail left them out by mistake, and the Convention thereafter deigned to restore only the power over Indian trade by inserting tribes in the Commerce Clause, but this time intentionally determined to omit the Indian affairs power. The initial erratum came about through the misfeasance of more than one hand. Initially, Virginia Governor Edmund Randolph erroneously left out the clause in his sketch of the Constitution. Thereafter, Committee of Detail Chair and South Carolinian John Rutledge scrawled “Indian Affairs” into the margin of Randolph’s sketch before James Wilson was tasked with producing a completed draft. The conscientious Wilson checked off the power as was his habit when working through elements of draft documents, but simply missed including “Indian Affairs” in his final draft of the Constitution.\n\nUntil now, no historian has caught the omission. The reasons are many, but, in part, the omission has eluded historians because Wilson’s check marks were inappropriately attributed to Rutledge until 2011, and published transcriptions of the document excluded the check marks until that time. Even then, binding tape on the left side of the paper obscured the particular check marks next to “Indian Affairs.” It was only in preparation for this Article that William Meigs’s facsimile of Randolph’s sketch (produced in 1899 before binding tape was added), compared to 2019 forensic imaging by the Library of Congress of the page on which Rutledge’s “Indian Affairs” appears, confirmed that Wilson checked off this congressional power as he did other powers. As newly published, analyzed, and demonstrated below, Rutledge’s marginalia was not a “proposal” or “suggestion” affirmatively rejected by the Committee of Detail, but a command that was inadvertently missed by Wilson, who was personally motivated to comply with the directive.\n\nLater, when flagged by Madison, the Committee of Detail determined, now fully cognizant of the oversight, to reinstate the power over Indian trade by inserting tribes into the Commerce Clause. However, this time the Committee intentionally omitted the Indian Affairs Clause, likely because of several factors—the lateness of the hour, the contentiousness of the underlying issues, and new reports of border skirmishes. The Committee punted, leaving it to later generations to work out the nettlesome issue as it did with the slavery question. The missing clause was never addressed by the Convention as a whole, and was passed over by the ratifiers.\n\nA. Committee of Detail Documents\n\nThe Committee of Detail’s formation was the point in the Convention when political machinations transformed into a first working draft of the Constitution. The carefully selected five-member committee was tasked with adding “details” to the Convention’s work up to that point: twenty-four rough resolutions based on the Virginia Plan. For this, the Convention halted for ten days between July 26 and August 6, 1787. There are nine extant documents from the Committee of Detail, eight of which appear in James Wilson’s hand, and one in Virginia Governor Edmund Randolph’s hand. As discussed above, while a facsimile of the document in Randolph’s hand was published in 1899 by William Meigs, the entire collection of documents was not transcribed and published until 1911 by Professor Max Farrand and retranscribed by myself and Professor William Ewald (and published together with document images) in 2011.\n\nTwo early Committee of Detail documents refer to “Indian Affairs,” though it is implicated by at least two others. The first document in the set is James Wilson’s copy of the twenty-four amended Virginia Plan resolutions referred to the Committee on July 23, 1787. Relevant to this inquiry is Resolution VI of the Virginia Plan as originally proposed by Edmund Randolph on the first day of the Convention’s substantive business, May 29, 1787. It proposed “that the National Legislature ought to be impowered to enjoy the Legislative Rights vested in Congress by the Confederation.” As anyone would have known (especially Convention delegates, many of whom had been or were concurrently serving in Congress ), these “Legislative Rights” under the Articles of Confederation included “regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the Indians” from Article IX, and thus required that both Indian trade and affairs appear in a draft text. Though Resolution VI of the Virginia Plan was significantly amended on July 17, this provision of the resolution remained uncontroversial, having passed unanimously without debate on July 16. The language remained intact until the resolution was referred to the Committee of Detail on July 23, appearing as Resolution 8.2.\n\nThe third document in the set appears to be James Wilson’s outline of the plan proposed by South Carolina delegate Charles Pinckney on May 29, 1787, the day the Virginia Plan was proposed. Even though not discussed for over two months (or at all), it too was referred to the Committee of Detail with the Virginia resolutions (along with the Patterson Plan, a complete copy of which is not found among Wilson’s Papers). The document’s brief listing of Congressional powers includes “the exclusive Power of regulating Trade and levying Imposts,” without any mention of Indian affairs.\n\nThe next document, Randolph’s sketch of the Constitution, is the second to cover Indian affairs within the series and the first wherein “Indian Affairs,” without more, can be seen, scrawled in the margin by Rutledge, the Committee’s chair, next to the power to provide punishment for “offences against the law of nations.” Importantly, “Indian Affairs” does not seem connected to “Commerce” at this point of the drafting, which appears earlier on the page. To more effectively convey the workings of the Committee, three images follow of the page where “Indian Affairs” appears: Figure 1, a high-resolution image with the binding tape provided by the Library of Congress; Figure 2, an image of Meigs’s facsimile from 1899 without binding tape; and Figure 3, a transcription of the same.\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 2\n\nFigure 3\n\nOne can see here in the transcription the main text in Randolph’s hand, emendations by Rutledge in red, and the check marks made by James Wilson as he later combed through the document in compiling his drafts. We will come back to this working method later.\n\nThe next document where one would expect to find any of the two “Indian” powers is Wilson’s first full draft of the Constitution. However, the folio page where all of the powers of Congress would have been mentioned is missing. Whether this page was lost whilst the Committee of Detail sat or at a later stage when Wilson organized his papers, Wilson here substituted excerpts he copied from the Patterson and Pinckney Plans in place of the missing folio. This inserted composite document proposes to provide Congress with the following powers:\n\n[O]f raising a military Land. Force—of equiping a Navy—of rating and causing public Taxes to be levied—of regulating the Trade of the several States as well with foreign Nations as with each other—of levying Duties upon Imports and Exports—of establishing Post-Offices, and raising a Revenue from them—of regulating Indian Affairs—of coining Money—fixing the Standard of Weights and Measures—of determining in what Species of Money the public Treasury shall be supplied.\n\nAs with Randolph’s sketch plus Rutledge’s marginal note, the nascent Commerce Clause with its three parts—states, foreign nations, and Indians—are here found in two separate clauses. Commerce is not even mentioned, but “trade” is specified in relation to states and foreign nations, and “affairs” as pertaining to Indians. It is important to note that this document is not necessarily sequential, as it featured in earlier plans submitted to the Convention and was merely copied by Wilson. When the middle portion of the draft document was lost, Wilson presumably placed the excerpts from the Patterson and Pinckney Plans there to show what he drew upon in creating the lost section of his draft.\n\nDocument IX, Wilson’s second draft of the Constitution and the final document in the Committee of Detail series, looks most like our final Constitution and identifies congressional powers in more recognizable ways. Notably, Indian affairs was entirely left out of the document:\n\nThe text in black is in Wilson’s hand, whereas the text in red is in Rutledge’s. After incorporating all of the edits to the document, the draft was published for internal circulation and reported out of committee. Though he caught the omission the first time, Rutledge missed it the second time around, and the draft Constitution submitted to the Convention did not include “Indian Affairs” or “Indian Trade” as required by the Virginia Plan resolutions.\n\nFrom these documents, we see that the Committee of Detail was compelled to incorporate Indian trade and Indian affairs as part of the “Legislative Rights vested in Congress by the Confederation.” However, neither was included in the initial sketch of the Constitution by Randolph. This was not Randolph’s only mistake: for instance, Randolph set the minimum age for senators as 25, though the Convention had approved a minimum age of 30. As Ewald points out, this was clear error, as Randolph partook of the Aristotelian view that an ideal Senate would be “august,” and thus would have preferred the older minimum age as required by the Convention. This error was later corrected, as John Rutledge attempted to do for the “Indian Affairs” omission. Rutledge inserted “Indian Affairs” (and other missing congressional powers) into the margins of Randolph’s sketch. Though it may have been included in the missing middle section of his first draft and lost even while working on it, Wilson then failed to include either “Indian Affairs” or “Indian Trade” in his final draft. Despite having Rutledge’s marginal note and the excerpts from the Patterson and Pinckney Plans to draw from (and the powers listed in the Articles of Confederation, which Resolution VI of the Virginia Plan required to be incorporated ) in writing his final draft, Wilson very clearly missed “Indian Affairs.”\n\nB. Wilson’s Mistake\n\nThat such was a mistake and not an intentional omission is buttressed by three historical factors: (1) the remit, structure, and working method of the Committee of Detail, (2) Wilson’s check marks, and (3) Wilson’s personal history and interest in lodging power over Indian affairs in the central government. Each will be addressed in turn.\n\n1. Remit, structure, and working method of the Committee of Detail.\n\nFirst, let us consider the charge, structure, and method of the Committee of Detail. As outlined above, the Committee of Detail was commissioned by the Convention to “prepare & report the Constitution,” not from whole cloth, but from nine weeks’ worth of work, a period of time that had witnessed the near complete dissolution of the Convention and the country’s hope for a workable Constitution over both representation in the Senate and the slave question. The gridlock had finally been broken over representation on July 16, and thus the memory of the rancorous debate was still fresh in the minds of Committee members when they convened on July 26, just over a week later. Indeed, on the eve of the Convention’s ten-day recess for the Committee of Detail’s work, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney “reminded the Convention that if the Committee should fail to insert some security to the Southern States agst. an emancipation of slaves, and taxes on exports, he shd. be bound by duty to his State to vote agst. their Report.” They were not there to invent a constitution but, as the uncontroversial name of the Committee dictated, to provide “Detail.” Their commission in the form of the twenty-four resolutions referred to them by the Convention was thus paramount. If they strayed too far, they knew that the risk of dissolution was all too real. Possibly the most uncontroversial requirement of the Convention was found in Resolution 8.2: the requirement to incorporate the congressional powers enjoyed under the Articles of Confederation, including the power over Indian trade and affairs. That it was uncontroversial made it no less important, though perhaps not as fresh in their minds as the vivid scenes of heated debate that threatened dissolution. Despite that they might personally disagree with one or more provisions (and did), Randolph or Wilson would not have intentionally disregarded such directives.\n\nThe structure of the Committee and Wilson’s relationship to the “Indian Affairs” marginalia’s author also underscores his oversight. As mentioned above, the Committee was chaired by John Rutledge. This is nowhere specified in the records of the Constitutional Convention, yet such attribution is based upon convention and common practice of the age. As seen throughout the Journal of the Continental Congress, it was standard practice to list committee chairs first when they were chosen by voice vote, as Rutledge was, and then for these individuals to report for the committee, as Rutledge did. Committee reports were usually in the hand of the chair, and Rutledge’s chairmanship is confirmed by edits in his hand upon documents authored by two members, Randolph and Wilson. That Rutledge was the Committee’s chair meant his edits and marginal notes carried special weight. The “Indian Affairs” marginal edit was not, as indicated by Natelson, a “suggestion” or “proposal” that was affirmatively rejected by Wilson. Instead, it was a directive or, more simply, a command by a superior that created a duty Wilson would have been remiss to ignore. Wilson did not ignore other such edits by Rutledge, and it would be highly unlikely that he would have altered course for this uncontroversial congressional power.\n\nThe working method of the Committee of Detail, as made evident through the extant documents, also confirms Wilson’s mistake. For reasons beyond the scope of this Article, the Committee of Detail has been underdiscussed and undertheorized in the literature of the Constitutional Convention. Thus, few have analyzed the workflow of the Committee as suggested in the documents, and some fairly commonsense observations have heretofore been missed. To begin, committees are universally multimember bodies that meet to discuss one or more proposals. This must have been true of the Committee of Detail; its members would have met together, most likely more than once, to discuss the Convention’s proposals and to review internal work. Additionally, as it is difficult to coherently write anything in a crowd, individual Committee members would likely have worked on their own. Thus, there would have been times when the Committee worked in concert and times when members worked in secluded cloisters. Though they feasibly could have met in smaller subcommittees, given the already intimate nature of the five-member committee, this is unlikely.\n\nOverlaying these common attributes of committees (both of committees generally and this particular committee) onto the extant documents, the workflow of the Committee and its implications for the missing Indian Affairs Clause comes into sharper focus. Of the nine Committee of Detail documents, those that would most likely be the product (or show the markings) of group discussions or meetings would logically be those with the imprints of multiple members. Here, those documents include Document IV (Randolph’s sketch with Rutledge’s emendations and Wilson’s check marks), and Document IX (Wilson’s second draft, again with Rutledge’s emendations). The likelihood that these documents witnessed or were partial products of group discussion is underscored by the presence of “agrd” twice scrawled by Rutledge next to the tax power and the prohibition on export taxes on page five of Randolph’s sketch. That contemporaneous committee reports from the Continental Congress were normally found in the handwriting of the chair indicates that, as a matter of course, committee chairs would preside over committee meetings with quill in hand. As he had many times before for committees he chaired in the Continental Congress, Rutledge indeed presided over the Committee of Detail sessions with quill in hand, and evidence of these sessions is found in the many emendations he made to Randolph’s initial sketch and Wilson’s final draft (both likely prepared alone on assignment from the Committee ). These were not Rutledge’s personal edits (though he certainly had great influence, especially upon the “deep South” provisions ), but reflected committee discussions and agreements in accord with standard forms of parliamentary procedure. For the instant inquiry, this standard working method translated into Indian affairs taking on the imprimatur not just of Rutledge in his personal capacity, but Rutledge acting as the Committee chair, as the product of Committee discussion and, likely, a Committee vote.\n\nHumble though the marginalia may appear, when analyzed within the Committee of Detail’s probable workflow as reflected by extant documents and dictated by standard committee operating procedures of the time, “Indian Affairs” had the weight of the Committee of Detail behind it, and such a command compelled a duty in the Committee member tasked with the next stage of drafting: James Wilson. He would have been untoward to shrug off this duty, and he appears at least initially to have complied, as evidenced by the check mark appearing next to “Indian Affairs,” discussed next.\n\n2. Wilson’s check marks.\n\nWilson’s mistake is also laid bare by the breadcrumb trail he left in his check marks. A classic Wilson working method found in many of his other papers was to review earlier material for inclusion in later material and check items off, much the way a modern task list would be checked off. Check marks appear on the Randolph Sketch for other powers, including one next to Rutledge’s “Indian Affairs” in the margin. The presence of the check mark here and the omission of the Clause in Wilson’s final draft is curious. If checked off, consistent with Wilson’s working method, the congressional power would presumably be found in the next document. Yet the section on congressional powers that would have included “Indian Affairs” in the next document is missing.\n\nIt might be tempting to explain the omission by postulating that Wilson included “Indian Affairs” in accord with his check mark in Randolph’s sketch in this first draft, but then the Clause was rejected by the Committee in full session. However, such is improbable if not impossible for at least three reasons. First, the Convention’s instruction to the Committee to include the Clause, as found in the unanimous July 16 vote on Resolution VI of the Virginia Plan to include “the Legislative Rights vested in Congs. by the Confederation” and the long prehistory of “Indian Trade and Affairs” regulation by Congress that antedated it, were uncontroversial. Second, as shown above, Rutledge’s directive to include “Indian Affairs” was almost certainly a Committee decision, and reversals of this kind were not otherwise found in the Committee’s work. Third, no Rutledge emendations were found on Wilson’s first draft, which points to this not being a document reviewed by the full Committee. More likely, Wilson either transposed the Committee’s requirements into a separate list no longer extant and then missed “Indian Affairs” when composing his first draft, or included “Indian Affairs” in the first draft and missed including it in the second. Of the two options, the latter is more probable, as the document elected to fill the void, the composite of Patterson and Pinckney Plans, included the Legislative power “of regulating Indian Affairs.” It is also possible that Wilson lost the relevant section even while preparing his final draft, which could be one reason why he missed including “Indian Affairs.”\n\n3. Wilson’s vested interests in a federal Indian affairs power.\n\nThe final historical factor underscoring Wilson’s scrivener’s error comes from his personal vested interests. As confirmed by evidence extrinsic to the Committee of Detail, the absence of “Indian Affairs” in the Constitution ultimately affected Wilson personally—even, perhaps, fatally. The same day that then-Colonel Washington was appointed commander of the revolutionary forces, June 16, 1775, the Continental Congress appointed a committee “relative to Indian affairs” that included the intrepid Wilson. A month later, Wilson was appointed one of the first Indian affairs commissioners and, that fall, witnessed one of the first postcolonial treaties being made with the Six Nations at Fort Pitt. Possibly through this exposure to the wide-open spaces of tribal territory, Wilson—then a frontier lawyer in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, when not serving in Congress —became seized with a vision of western White settlement, wherein European riches and labor could combine with the vast expanses in the American West.\n\nWhile riding circuit and ostensibly serving as Indian affairs commissioner and an Indian trade committeeman in the late 1770s, Wilson began buying up vast tracts of tribal lands, eventually becoming president of the ill-fated Illinois-Wabash Company. Congress later indirectly censured Wilson’s self-dealing (and did not reappoint him as an Indian affairs commissioner). The weight of western land debt ultimately proved his political downfall and contributed to his untimely death. To his credit, Wilson abstained from compounding his self-dealing by absenting himself not only from the committee making recommendations on Virginia’s western land cessions—to much of which he, through the Illinois-Wabash Company, also had claim—but also from congressional discussions and votes on the same. However, in July 1776, John Adams noted that, as a Pennsylvania Congressman, Wilson “argued eloquently for exclusive congressional jurisdiction over all Indian affairs.” Unfortunately, as Natelson writes, Wilson lost the point. As a congressman, Wilson voted to maintain federal power to treat with Native tribes and control land sales even in preference to his home state of Pennsylvania. He voted against every state attempt to individually treat with tribes, and not just when his contested titles were implicated. Wilson favored congressional control of western territory and its ability to directly treat with Native tribes. As later proved by his failed petition to Congress on behalf of the Illinois-Wabash company, this was because Wilson believed the best chances of validating his western claims lay with his many friends and connections in federal power. As shown by collective compromises in both the Continental Congress and in the constitutional texts he drafted, he was also scrupled enough to be ruled by the majority despite personal differences.\n\nIn sum, both the Convention (via its general directive to incorporate congressional powers found in the Articles) and Committee Chairman John Rutledge (via his marginal note) commanded Wilson’s obedience. Wilson would not have taken either command lightly, his check marks evince his unconsummated intention to comply, and his vested interests left him with a strong preference for federal power over Indian affairs. Wilson’s oversight in leaving out Indian affairs from the Committee of Detail’s report was therefore not intentional—at least, not at this stage of the Constitution’s history.\n\nC. The Convention’s Partial Resurrection\n\nWilson’s oversight was noticed. After Wilson’s final draft was reported out of committee by Rutledge on August 6, the omission was not mentioned for ten days. However, on August 16, with only a month remaining before the final Constitution was reported to Congress, Madison proposed to refer to the same Committee of Detail nine congressional powers, including “[t]o regulate affairs with the Indians as well within as without the limits of the U. States.” By this proposal, Madison sought to correct the Committee of Detail’s oversight and the ambiguous states’ rights language of the Articles of Confederation that had caused so much trouble. The Committee of Detail rejected Madison’s language and instead grafted “Indians” into the Commerce Clause, adding in a clause that partially reflected the states’ rights language of the Articles. Its updated report of August 22 indicates that the Committee decided on the following wording of the clause: “[To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the Several States] and with Indians, within the Limits of any State, not subject to the laws thereof.” By whatever hand the change was made, the Committee had reintroduced some of the ambiguity of the Articles into the Constitution, and resurrected its “Indian trade” language. It thereby converted its oversight into a sin of omission and created a new problem: by electing to restore the power over Indian trade but not affairs, it effectively shrank congressional power from affairs to merely commerce as respecting tribes.\n\nThe Convention did not discuss the provision, nor did it take any formal action on this latter report, having postponed the session so members could take down a copy. The language was instead taken up and amended further by a Committee of Eleven to deal with “such parts of the Constitution as have been postponed, and such parts of Reports as have not been acted on, to a Committee of a member from each State,” to which Madison had finally been appointed (after being overlooked for the Committee of Detail and the previous two “grand” committees of eleven) on August 31. Reporting on September 4, this committee removed the offensive states’ rights language, but left power to legislate over Indians saddled to the Commerce Clause. The Commerce Clause now read, “Congress shall have power . . . to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States and with the Indian tribes.”\n\nThe language was never approved as a discrete text, but was adopted without any comment or debate as part of the near-final text of the Constitution on September 10 and referred to the Committee of Style and Arrangement. Other than varying the punctuation and capitalization, this final committee made no edits to the clause, and it was approved as part of the final, unratified Constitution on September 17, 1787, when the Convention adjourned. As finally approved, the full Commerce Clause read as follows: “The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.”\n\nThese critical changes to what was once “Indian Affairs” happened where the record is most sparse: Madison’s notes, traditionally the most reliable source of the Convention, became quite thin after the Committee of Detail reported for the first time, and even more sparse after August 22. At this time, Madison was tired, sick, working around the clock on after-hour committee assignments, and, likely, depressed. All of this combined to greatly reduce the volume of his note-taking and thus the material from which any legal inferences could be made about the provenance of the Indian Commerce Clause.\n\nDespite the lack of conclusive proof from Madison’s notes or other documents, his background and vocalized concerns make him the likely antagonist for the correction of the confused states’ rights language. Madison had been invited by the Marquis de Lafayette to attend U.S. peace negotiations with the Iroquois Six Nations in the fall of 1784 at Fort Stanwix, and was not likely to forget this firsthand experience with Indian affairs. In preparation for the Convention, he had outlined the flaws of the Confederation for himself, listing “the wars and Treaties of Georgia with the Indians” as the prime example of state encroachments on federal authority. It was he who first noticed the Committee of Detail’s oversight, and it is he who should likely be credited for spearheading removing the offensive states’ rights language. It disappeared, after all, only once Madison had been appointed to the final Committee of Eleven that proposed the ultimate text.\n\nAnd it is he we have to thank for the insertion of “tribes” into the Commerce Clause. Reserving for another time a full discussion of the distinctions between commerce and trade, it is possible to say that commerce is more like trade than it is the broader connotation of affairs. As has been shown, Indian affairs sometimes embraced Indian trade and could presumably also embrace commerce within its capaciousness. Thus as Fletcher has shown, “Commerce” does not capture all that the preconstitutional “Affairs” entailed. Whereas simply incorporating “Indian Affairs” (as directed by Rutledge in his marginal note) could have supplied power over trade, providing for “Indian Commerce” supplied, at most, for no more than half of the powers vis-à-vis tribes reserved to Congress under the Articles. Thus, including “Indian Tribes” into the Commerce Clause was, at best, solving the missing Indian Affairs Clause only in part.\n\nWhat is to be made of this half resurrection and the unrecorded committee discussions that must have surrounded it? Did it absolve the Committee of Detail’s former mistake? Did those few Framers mean to restore power over Indian trade and disdain including Indian affairs, contracting the scope of congressional power in this one regard?\n\nJustice Thomas and at least two legal historians suggest that the Convention’s limiting of federal Indian authority to commerce, in the words of Professor Francis Hutchins, “could be interpreted as sanctioning state power over any and all matters relating to ‘Indians’ within state bounds other than the narrow federal power here acknowledged.” For support, one historian proffers that soon after the Convention, Nathaniel Gorham, one of the Committee of Detail’s five members, purchased preemption rights to Iroquois lands in New York State from the Bay State and negotiated a state treaty “acquiring some of these rights from the Iroquois.” Yet Gorham, though past president of Congress, was “not much improved in his education” and unlikely to be the intellectual heavyweight among the five-member committee, which contained political and legal lights Edmund Randolph, Virginia governor and sponsor of the Virginia Plan; James Wilson, who “rank[ed] among the foremost in legal and political knowledge”; John Rutledge, former first governor of South Carolina and legally trained in England; and Oliver Ellsworth, a Princeton-trained judge from Connecticut who shepherded the Great Compromise through the Convention, winning an equal vote for the small states in the Senate over the strong objection of the more populous states, and who was “much respected for his integrity.” Even if Gorham’s later actions were premeditated in the Convention and he actively sought to limit congressional power over Indians in both resurrecting the unworkable language from the Articles of Confederation and limiting congressional power over Natives to commerce, it was unlikely Gorham would have an outsized influence on his peers, let alone that he would draft any text, as his hand is not present on any other Committee of Detail documents.\n\nDespite all this, it is also unlikely that Gorham, if he had authored the Committee’s language limiting the Indian Commerce Clause to Natives “not subject to the laws” of individual states, meant for it to have the cramped reading attributed it by Justice Thomas and others. After all, he and two other members of the Committee of Detail—Ellsworth and Rutledge (the chair)—had served on the Continental Congress committee that had rejected Virginia’s limit on their western land cessation, negating alternative claims by individuals (such as Wilson) who had directly purchased land from Native tribes. Rejecting Virginia’s limitation in this way expanded congressional hegemony over tribal affairs. Gorham may have dissented from this earlier Committee’s recommendation (and later acted in his own self-interest), but it is more than likely that he and the other two members of the Congressional Committee who also served on the Committee of Detail, plus Wilson, would have, at the very least, seen Madison’s proposed language as an improvement on the Articles by omitting the obscuring language limiting congressional power over Indian affairs and trade, “provided that the legislative right of any State within its own limits be not infringed or violated,” and providing only a slim caveat to federal power for Natives who had become citizens. The language moved in the direction of federal power, and the further edits by the Grand Committee moved the dial toward federalizing Native powers over Indian commerce and trade even more.\n\nAnd yet, the Indian Affairs Clause still went missing. Unlike with Madison, the omission of “Indian Affairs” escaped the Convention’s notice or comment in full Convention. Other than the mention of Madison’s motion in the sparse official journal and his own notes on August 18, the Indian Commerce Clause and its radical departure from the Articles’ provision of power over both Indian trade and affairs received no attention by Convention members in any extant records. At most, if noted by all members of both the Committee of Detail and the final Grand Committee, only sixteen of the Convention’s fifty-five members realized the mistake.\n\nConjuring meaning from such silence is difficult at best, troublesome at worst. Although it is impossible to know with certainty, two explanations for partial restoration of Indian powers seem likely. First, the delegates may have been distracted from the larger issue at hand—the radical power shrinkage—by the nettlesome federal-state power struggles that seems to have been solved by Madison’s removal of any states’ rights language. Perhaps in their minds, the worst problem with the Articles’ treatment of tribes was solved, and in the rush of the final weeks of the Convention, half begun was well-enough done. More likely, however, especially for those involved in the text’s minutia, was a more thoughtful approach. The opening passages of Randolph’s sketch (containing Rutledge’s “Indian Affairs” marginal note) contain a guiding philosophy on the importance of textual brevity in constitution writing:\n\nIn the draught of a fundamental constitution, two things deserve attention:\n\nTo insert essential principles only; lest the operations of government should be clogged by rendering those provisions permanent and unalterable, which ought to be accommodated to times and events[.] [A]nd\n\nTo use simple and precise language, and general propositions, according to the example of the (several) constitutions of the several states. (For the construction of a constitution necessarrily differs from that of law)[.]\n\nIn this first sketch of the Constitution, Randolph had therefore established the Committee of Detail’s guiding lights: to include only essential principles, general propositions, and simple and precise language. Although the Committee was not always to follow this principle, it reigned in its August 6 report. Perhaps it also continued to guide in its decision about restoring “Indian Commerce,” but not “Indian Affairs.” Committee members might have looked at other provisions of the draft Constitution—including the treaty powers (then lodged in the Senate) and war powers—and thought such were sufficient to supply all that was needed for Indian affairs. After all, but for Natives committing crimes against non-Natives, the Continental Congress had thus far not directly legislated for Natives, but treated with them on a tribal level. Under the guiding lights of Randolph, who himself had been visited by a Cherokee chief during the Convention, “Indian Affairs” was already embraced in more general provisions of the Constitution, and was therefore no longer needed.\n\nAdditionally, as has been discussed, it is possible that “Indian Commerce” was used as a surrogate for “Indian Trade,” which committee members knew had garnered a supermajority of support in Congress. Committee members Gorham and Wilson had been present in the Confederation Congress in 1786 when national regulation of Indian trade had achieved a supermajority. These committee members therefore knew that incorporating some derivation of “Indian Trade” would likely be uncontroversial. Contrariwise, they would have been all too familiar that the broader “Affairs” language, embracing competing claims to native lands, could potentially stir up the controversy then fomenting in the halls of Congress in neighboring New York and threatening war in Georgia and North Carolina. Whereas federal power over Indian trade had achieved supermajority status by the time the Convention sat, the concomitant federal power over Indian affairs had not.\n\nYet all of this calculus was at play when the Committee of Detail first sat. Sometime around July 26, they had agreed to include “Indian Affairs” in the Constitution. What had changed? Only time. At this late stage of the Convention, delegates, most especially chairman John Rutledge, were anxious to return home. Nine of the fifty-five delegates had already left. By August 18 when Madison made his proposed insertion of “Indian Affairs” coupled with language intended to solve the states’ rights issue, the wheels of the Convention were running efficiently, and controversial matters were postponed or relegated to committees (as Madison’s was) to keep momentum going. Core provisions, such as selection of the president, were yet to be worked out. It is very likely that, once its mistake was pointed out by Madison, the Committee determined that most powers comprising Indian affairs were essentially already provided to Congress via broad strokes in the current draft. Leaving the clause out would sidestep gridlock when the Convention most required forward progress. Such was also consistent with the Committee’s guiding light of brevity. Instead, they opted to enshrine the more narrow Articles of Confederation power that would likely be (and was) noncontroversial: Indian trade via the Indian Commerce Clause. Half done was left well enough alone.\n\nThe Committee of Detail’s failure to restore both Indian Trade and Affairs proved no expiation for the original sin of omission. As history has shown, this area of law has led a torturous existence ever since, likely impacting the lives of millions of Native Americans for the worse. The sum of the parts of the Constitution has possibly proved greater than the whole when applied to Indian affairs, in that the power’s lack of discrete textual boundaries has led, inexorably, toward plenary power. If the Committee of Detail did refrain from restoring Indian affairs power for the sake of expediency, it was a different kind of mistake which, though less sinister than the Three-Fifths Clause, also compounded itself over time and papered over what was otherwise an innocent oversight. Yet, as I show, the omission of the Indian Affairs Clause may actually work to the tribes’ benefit.\n\nIn the end, no one caught the cover-up, and the broader power of “managing all affairs with the Indians” was forgotten. If delegates did catch the mistake, such conversations were had apart from the recording pen of history. What began as a scrivener’s error was only half restored, and preconstitutional powers shrank.\n\nD. The Ratifiers’ Oversight\n\nThe Convention was not alone in its oversight. The missing clause seems also to have been overlooked by the ratifiers, too. As already discussed, although Native allies, lands, and trade were frequent and important topics of state and federal legislative debates, “We the People” as convened in state ratifying conventions missed the new disparity between governmental practice and fundamental law (and tribes were omitted from the discussion altogether). True, as mentioned above, Federalists were unlikely to criticize the Constitution, especially for having too few powers. Notwithstanding this, Federalists implicate the Indian Commerce Clause only twice, both in Federalist Papers authored by Madison. In Federalist 40, Madison obliquely mentions the Clause as one of few instances wherein the federal government might directly act upon an individual. The other was a lengthier passage in Federalist 42, already mentioned. There, Madison proclaimed victory because the Clause eradicated the limitations and confusions of the Articles’ verbiage, and because Congress (not the States) had power to regulate trade with the Indians. No mention of the awkward partial restoration is made.\n\nYet Madison—or any other Federalist, for that matter—was unlikely to fault the Constitution openly for any reason, let alone for conferring too few powers on Congress. It was all they could do to overcome Anti-Federalist concerns without introducing some of their own. Surprisingly, in the following passages, Madison discusses the congressional power to regulate weights and measures that is “transferred from the Articles of Confederation,” and likely would have brought to his reader’s attention that another congressional power from the Articles, Indian affairs, had not been imported from the former document. The silence regarding the power shrinkage is highlighted and reflected in Federalist 24, where Alexander Hamilton discusses the threat on western borders posed by “savage tribes” who could join with European allies in menacing settlers from the East. If Natives posed a threat of war, by implication, they could also pose the need for less hostile forms of action, including diplomacy with its gift giving, coming to agreements regarding disputed lands, settling of Native-settler disputes, and on and on. Though Hamilton raised the specter of the necessity of noncommercial federal power to treat with Natives, he declined to address or acknowledge the problem it posed—perhaps, by implication, prefiguring the liquidation later achieved by Knox to treat tribes as foreign nations and thus activate the president’s treaty-making and foreign-relations powers. In this, Hamilton joined Madison and other Federalists who remained silent regarding the Constitution’s glaring omission.\n\nAnti-Federalists, like Federalists, were unlikely to complain of the Constitution providing too few powers to Congress, and thus the only mention of the clause by Anti-Federalists was by Abraham Yates, Jr., discussed above. Without noting that Indian commerce is quite different and a separate power from Indian affairs, Yates queries:\n\nIf this was the conduct of Congress and their officers, when possessed of powers which were declared by them to be insufficient for the purposes of government, what have we reasonably to expect will be their conduct when possessed of the powers “to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes,” when they are armed with legislative, executive and judicial powers, and their laws the supreme laws of the land[?]\n\nIt could be argued that Yates was equating commerce with affairs as some scholars are wont to do, but considering his intimacy with this domain of government, that is unlikely. Yates, along with other Federalists and Anti-Federalists, missed the true significance of the restoration of Indian trade via “Indian Commerce” but not “Indian Affairs.”\n\n* * *\n\nIn all, several factors demonstrate that leaving out Indian affairs as a distinct congressional power was a mistake turned intentional omission: the long preconstitutional history of Indian affairs as a distinct area of law from Indian trade and a choate federal structure, the Convention’s directive to include the Articles’ legislative powers, the presence of two draft texts including “Indian Affairs,” the missed insertion of the clause by Randolph and later Wilson, the partial restoration by committees on the eve of the Convention, and the lack of general debate on the federal or state convention floors. The error was first Randolph’s, then Wilson’s, then the Committee of Detail’s twice—the first time innocently, the second, intentionally—and was then passed over by the Constitutional Convention and the ratifying conventions. When Madison caught the mistake, the Committee of Detail addressed the lapse and determined to provide a partial restoration of one of the two Indian powers, and no one thereafter commented on the lapse. The Constitution is thus missing an Indian Affairs Clause.\n\nIII. Significance and the Fix\n\nA constitutional omission of this magnitude is novel. It thus raises a myriad of unprecedented and pressing questions: What does the omission of an Indian Affairs Clause mean for Congress’s tribal plenary power, for tribal sovereignty, and for the meaning of the Commerce Clause as a whole? How does it impact state-tribal relationships? What are the implications for the scope of the treaty power? These and other important questions will not be addressed here but will provide the basis for further fruitful research and scholarship. Instead, this Article concludes by discussing the significance of omitting an Indian affairs power for congressional plenary power over tribes and suggesting a practical fix to the constitutional power gap: reinitiating tribal treaty-making.\n\nA. Significance for Plenary Power\n\nThis history demonstrates that the Constitution as finalized—without an Indian Affairs Clause—was almost assuredly intentional. This has major significance for congressional plenary power. Without an Indian affairs power, plenary power is constitutionally wanting and fails. In addressing the significance of the missing Indian Affairs Clause, this Section first deals with the issue of intent, differentiating between intent on a high level of generality versus its more fine-grained variants. Second, it proposes that omission of the Indian Affairs Clause split the preconstitutional Indian affairs powers between the executive and Congress, leaving the residue to the sovereign tribes and operating as a limit if not a bar on congressional plenary power over tribes.\n\n1. The universality of broad intent.\n\nCurrently, all theories of constitutional or statutory interpretation assume that what is included and omitted in a text are results of intentional drafting processes in the broad sense. Mistakes inhere the lack of intent, and herein lies a problem: most constitutional theorists, including originalists, disfavor intent. Determining the mind and will of one individual at any given point in time is difficult. Adding the dimension of time and the complexity of a multimember drafting process (not to mention multiple multimember bodies) and determining collective intent approaches the impossible. As Professor Paul Brest said in his seminal article The Misconceived Quest for the Original Understanding:\n\n[A]n intention can only become binding—only become an institutional intention—when it is shared by at least the same number and distribution of adopters. . . .\n\nIf the only way a judge could ascertain institutional intent were to count individual intention-votes, her task would be impossible even with respect to a single multimember law-making body, and a fortiori where the assent of several such bodies were required.\n\nIntentionalism, Brest posits, is thus “problematic” when narrowly applied.\n\nHowever, central to the concept of law, especially fundamental law, is intent on a very high level of abstraction: the law was meant to be law, and interpreters assume intent for what is included and excluded in a text. Coherence and thinking are necessary predicates to legal text. It is not poetry or history or soliloquy, but law because it was meant to be law. This kind of intent—that it is an intentional law—does not pertain to or partake of individual thought processes per se, but it requires that any thought process or coherence preceded the text. The centrality of broad intentionalism is underscored by the persistent presence of interpretive canons of construction.\n\nThus broad intent is assumed for law, especially constitutional law. Yet what if this generalized intent is missing? What if the law was incoherent, or unintentional? What if what was meant to be law was left out not by virtue of this generalized intent, but because of its lack? Such a mistake is a particular form of lack of intent that is different in kind from evidence of little or no discussion, rejection of a proposal, or some other form of negative intention. It is closer to the species of unintended consequences of otherwise intentional texts, but differs still in that there are unintended consequences of unintentional texts, similar to scriveners’ errors. Had Madison not caught the Committee of Detail’s mistake, new theory of this ken would be required to supplement the missing Clause, including any analogies to the mistake doctrine for a possible sub silentio judicial fix.\n\nYet this is not the case here. As has been shown, there was intention—of the broad variety—in the determination to omit the Indian Affairs Clause. Even if the doctrine were to apply, recent case law demonstrates that Madison’s flagging of the omission would prevent application of the mistake doctrine. Thus intent is relevant, as is the lack thereof. Meaning can appropriately be derived from the intentional omission of the Indian Affairs Clause without implicating the same theoretical concerns as intent on a more finite level.\n\n2. Splitting the Indian affairs power.\n\nAssuming that the Indian Affairs Clause was intentionally omitted and that such broad intent permits constitutional meaning, where did the preconstitutional Indian affairs power go? It must yield to the Constitution’s other enumerated powers and external Indian affairs powers are therefore split between the executive and the legislature, w"
