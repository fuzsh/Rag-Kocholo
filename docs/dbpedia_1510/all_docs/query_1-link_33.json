        "text": "The Constitutional Convention\n\nWoman (to Benjamin Franklin): \"Well, Doctor, what have we got - a Republic or a Monarchy?\"\n\nBenjamin Franklin: \"A Republic, if you can keep it.\"\n\n-McHenry, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787\n\nScene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States, Oil on Canvas, Howard Chandler Christy\n\nThe hundred day debate known as the Constitutional Convention was one of the most momentous occurrences in United States Constitutional History, and the events that would take place in the Pennsylvania State House during that time would set the United States on the course towards becoming a true Constitutional Republic.\n\nThe Constitutional Convention took place from May 14 to September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The point of the event was decide how America was going to be governed.Although the Convention had been officially called to revise the existing Articles of Confederation, many delegates had much bigger plans. Men like James Madison and Alexander Hamilton wanted to create a new government rather than fix the existing one. The delegates elected George Washington to preside over the Convention.\n\n70 Delegates had been appointed by the original states to attend the Constitutional Convention, but only 55 were able to be there. Rhode Island was the only state to not send any delegates at all.\n\nAs history played out, the result of the Constitutional Convention was the United States Constitution, but it wasn't an easy path. The drafting process was grueling. They wanted the supreme law of the United States to be perfect.\n\nThe first two months of the Convention saw fierce debate over the 15 points of the \"Virginia Plan\" which had been proposed by Madison as an upgrade to the Articles of Confederation. Yet, the \"Committee of the Whole\" couldn't agree on anything. So, on July 24 of that year, the Committee of Detail was enacted to handle the drafting process.\n\nThe United States (U.S.) Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787 with 39 signatures before being distributed to the States for ratification.\n\nThe Committee of Detail\n\nThe Committee of Detail, headed by John Rutledge (nicknamed Dictator John), was in charge of drafting the Constitution. Other members included Edmund Randolph, Oliver Ellsworth, James Wilson, and Nathaniel Gorham. Other than Gorham, the committee members had all been respected lawyers, and would go on to become leading legal figures in the new government (Randolph would be the first attorney general, while Rutledge, Ellsworth and Wilson would become Supreme Court justices).\n\nThe Lost Draft of James Wilson\n\nAccording to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, the earliest surviving version of the United States Constitution was written by member of the Committee of Detail, James Wilson. However, for more than 200 years it had been \"lost to history,\" a United States Constitutional legend.\n\nIn late 2010, the unthinkable happened. Researcher Lorianne Updike Toler discovered the missing copy amongst Wilson's papers in the vault of the Pennsylvania Historical Society. It had never been lost, just misplaced.\n\nOn September 17, 2012 for one day only, this rare copy of Wilson's four page draft was put on display in Philadelphia in honor of the 225th anniversary of the adoption of the U.S. Constitution. However, because of the Documents' sensitivity to light and temperature, they remain under lock and key in the vault, only to emerge under special occasions.\n\n*All Portraits/Paintings courtesy of Wikipedia commons - licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike License 3.0.\n\n*All Images of Documents courtesy of the National Archives under the Open Government License."
