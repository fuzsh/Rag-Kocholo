(DE)\n\nJames McHenry (MD)\n\nBenjamin Franklin, George Clymer, Thomas Mifflin and Jared Ingersoll (PA)\n\nThis will be the first session Franklin is attending. Weak and ill, he does not play a very active role, but his presence confers importance to this gathering.\n\nThe Convention heard the report of the Rules Committee which it adopted as procedure. Three delegates, Rufus King (MA), Pierce Butler (SC) and Richard Dobbs Spaight (NC), made motions aimed at keeping the debates secret until the Convention ended. These motions were referred to the Rules Committee and the convention adjourned for the day.\n\nSynopsis\n\nMassachusetts and Connecticut now represented\n\nCommittee on Rules reported on their work\n\nConvention adopted 16 rules and referred additional suggested rules to the committee\n\nDelegates Today\n\nDr. Franklin received a visit from lexicographer Noah Webster \"and ladies.\"\n\nPhiladelphia Today\n\nThe weather stayed cool (59° mean), but there was no wind, and skies were fair."
