The U.S. Constitution was signed on September 17, 1787, by 39 delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, presided over by George Washington.

The biographical History Mugs were created to teach and inspire individuals to learn about our diverse and interesting history. The biographies were researched and written by history enthusiast, Robert Compton. He colorized most of the historic photos and images used on the mugs, which were originally black and white or sepia-tone. The images and biographies are imprinted on mugs at his studio in rural Vermont.
