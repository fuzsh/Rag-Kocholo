        "text": "Besides the windows, nearly all the necessary altar furniture, etc., were donated by different members of the parish. The side altar of Saint Mary was donated by The Ancient Order of Hibernians. The side altar of Saint Joseph was donated by The Saint Mary Society and The Lady of Lourdes Society. The statue of Saint Mary was donated by Henry McBride and the statue of Saint Joseph by Mrs. Thomas Brennan.\n\nTwo angels on high altar were donated by The Catholic Social Club, the altar cross by James McGlade the credence table by Mary F. Phepoe, large candlesticks on high altar by Frank Fath, large candlesticks for Saint Joseph altar by Mrs. Bridget Hughes, baptismal font by Saint Mary school children, sanctuary lamp by Miss. McFadden, ostensorium and thabor by a gentleman and lady of the parish.\n\nThree plush chairs for the sanctuary were donated by Joseph J. Gallagher, of Camden, the tabernacle lining by Mrs. Howarth, missal cover by Mary E. Gorman, vases for side altars by Mary Kelly, vases for high altar by Mrs. Julia Maloney, candelabra by Mrs.Hines, another set of candelabra by Mrs. Cloran, vestments by Henry Farrelly, cruets, of cut glass and gold mounted by Charles A.

Lenny, smaller candlesticks for Saint Joseph alter by Mrs. Annie Wittington, chime of altar bells by Mary Campbell, paschal candlesticks by Mrs. James McGlade, a brass missal stand by a lady of the parish, and a pair of candlestick brackets for high altar by William Whalen.\n\nLocated on the back wall of the church are two diorama panels illustrating scenes from the life of Saint Patrick. The panel on the right depicts Saint Patrick's arrival on the island of Ireland. He is shown preaching to King Leoghaire (Leary), and lighting the Paschal fire on the Hill of Slane to celebrate the Easter Vigil and announcing the arrival of Christianity to Ireland. Notice the bard or poet asleep and holding a harp, the symbol of Ireland. The panel on the left depicts Saint Patrick baptizing two children, perhaps children of the King. The cut wood and ax symbolize the end of the druidic religion, that centered in sacred oak groves, with the coming of Christianity. The origin of these panels is uncertain, in the meantime La Fheile Padraig!"
