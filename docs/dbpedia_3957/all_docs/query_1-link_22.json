        "text": "Travel in the footsteps of St Augustine and discover the birth of Christianity in England in the beautiful Stour Valley from Ramsgate to Canterbury.\n\nThe Way of St Augustine is approximately 19 miles long, and, while it could be done in one day, it would be a very long day! The best way to appreciate the landscape of the Stour valley, and the historic churches (and pubs) along the way is to split the route into two roughly equal halves, stopping overnight at one of the Church Conservation Trusts churches (CCT), the delightful All Saint’s Church at West Stourmouth, where you can be a pioneer of “champing” (church camping). It is essential to book your “champing” stay through the CCT (Call Chana James on 07825 178 961 or email cjames@thecct.org.uk)\n\nThe route can be walked in either direction and there are also some related itineraries such as a “river pilgrimage” from Sandwich, good local cycle routes, and the possibility of canoeing the route too. Don’t forget to pick up your pilgrim passport at the start of your journey, at the Welcome Centre in Canterbury Cathedral or the Shrine of St Augustine in Ramsgate, and to get it stamped along the way. Some restaurants are offering a discount for pilgrims on the Way of St Augustine with the passport. Pilgrims are welcome in Canterbury Cathedral free of charge, and blessings and group visits can be arranged through Cathedral House.\n\nVisit this places while on your pilgrimage and dont forget to get your passport stamped!\n\nShrine of St Augustine, Ramsgate – built by Augustus Pugin in celebration of St Augustine\n\nSt Augustine’s Cross – near Cliffsend (English Heritage, free)\n\nMinster Abbey – the chapel is always open, and it is possible to book tours in advance\n\nSt Mary’s Church, Minster – an imposing church, once on the sea shore! The church is open daily throughout the year – usually 9am-5pm. There are guided tours on most Saturdays, 12pm and 2pm and by arrangement (please call 07958 813577).\n\nWest Stourmouth Church – book with the CCT to “champ”\n\nStodmarsh Church – open to pilgrims\n\nFordwich Church – see the “Fordwich Stone”, believed to be part of St Augustine’s tomb\n\nThe World Heritage Site comprising St Martin’s Church, St Augustine’s Abbey (English Heritage), and Canterbury Cathedral.\n\nEastbridge Hospital, Canterbury – medieval pilgrim accommodation\n\nThere are also pubs and restaurants along the route, at Fordwich, Stodmarsh, Grove Ferry, Pluck’s Gutter, and Minster – perfect for stopping for refreshment!"
