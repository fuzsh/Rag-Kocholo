        "meta_description": "Fordwich near Canterbury is the smallest place in Britain with a town council and has a population of around 350 people. \n\t\n\tAlthough it now lies many miles inland, it was once the main port for Canterbury before the Wantsum Channel silted up. The Channel separated the Isle of Thanet from the rest of Kent.\n\t\n\tFordwich grew in the Middle Ages as a port for boats on their way upriver to Canterbury. The Caen stone used by the Normans to rebuild Canterbury Cathedral in the 12th and 13th centuries was landed at Fordwich. It later became a limb of the Cinque Ports, but lost its status as a town in 1880 when it no longer had a Mayor and Corporation. However, in a reorganisation in 1972, Fordwich was again  made a Town, mainly due to its prior importance in what is now a rather sleepy corner of Kent. \n\t\n\tFordwich Town Hall, the smallest Town Hall in England, dates from medieval times and was rebuilt in 1555. The ancient Church of St Mary the Virgin (see photo) is now redundant and in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It contains part of a carved sarcophagus reputed to have contained the remains of St Augustine of Canterbury. \n\t\n\tThere are two pubs in the town, the George & Dragon and Fordwich Arms. Fordwich is also known as the home of a legendary large fish: the Fordwich trout.\n\t\n\tAdapted from Wikipedia.",
