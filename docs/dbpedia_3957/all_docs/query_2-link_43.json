His speech was preceded by eloquent remarks from distinguished guests, including The Honorable Letitia James, The Honorable Kimberly Council, The Honorable Crystal Hudson, The Honorable Nydia Velazquez, and The Honorable Eric Gonzalez.\n\nThe musical segment featured outstanding performances by baritone Ricky Brackett, vocalist Courtney Long, accompanied by Asher Denberg, and the impressive choruses—The Brooklyn Contemporary Chorus and The Young People’s Chorus of New York City.
