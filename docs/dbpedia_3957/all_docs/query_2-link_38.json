Some of the steps are steep and worn. Persons with heart conditions or pre-existing medical conditions, mobility difficulties or any condition where the effort of climbing is considered hazardous should refrain from attempting this climb. You are required to exercise due care and attention during your visit and to move around the University Church at all times with proper regard for your safety.\n\nCan children visit the tower?\n\nChildren under the age of 8 are not permitted to climb the tower. All children aged 8-15 must be accompanied and supervised by an adult (anyone aged 18 or over) when accessing the Tower. All such children must remain under the control and supervision of a person aged 18 or over at all times.\n\nAre toilets and baby-changing facilities available?\n\nWe regret that toilets and baby-changing facilities are not available to the public. The nearest public toilets (including baby-changing facilities) are located in Market Street (by the Covered Market) and are open daily from 7.30am – 9.00pm.\n\nCan I visit the University Church for free?\n\nThe University Church is free to visit. The Chancel is reserved for private prayer.\n\nCan I bring food and drink into the University Church?\n\nUnfortunately food and drink cannot be consumed inside the University Church.\n\nDo you have a café?\n\nThe church café is located at the foot of the tower and offers breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea.\n\nCan I take photos?\n\nYes, provided they are for personal use and not commercial purposes. Please note that photography, audio and video recording is not permitted during services.\n\nCan I take photos for commercial purposes?\n\nAny commercial photography requires the prior written permission of the Vicar of the University Church. This includes the recording of any images and/or sound for commercial purposes and the uploading onto the internet or any online publishing of any material created or recorded in the University Church. All commercial image-use rights in all images created inside the University Church remain the property of the Parochial Church Council. To discuss commercial photography contact the Administrator: admin@universitychurch.ox.ac.uk.\n\nCan I film at the University Church?\n\nWhile short clips for social media and online blogs are fine, filming for any documentary, project, advert or commercial venture is not permitted without the full written permission of the Vicar of the University Church. To discuss filming projects, please contact the Administrator: admin@universitychurch.ox.ac.uk.\n\nCan I use a drone around the University Church?\n\nNo. Drone use for any purpose is strictly forbidden and drones may not enter any airspace within 100 metres of the building and of Radcliffe Square. Failure to adhere to this may result in prosecution.\n\nCan I bring my luggage into the University Church?\n\nWheeled bags, and bags larger than hand luggage are not permitted in the University Church. There are a number of left luggage facilities in the city. Please note that due to increased national security levels, random bag searches may be carried out when you enter the University Church.\n\nHow do I get to the University Church?\n\nThe Church is located on the High Street in Oxford. Visitors are encouraged to use the Park and Ride facility. If using public transport to visit the church, please be aware that face coverings must be worn when using public transport in England."
