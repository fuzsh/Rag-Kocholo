        "text": "Where It All Began\n\nSince 1912, St. Mary Queen of Angels has had the mission of serving the community in which they worship. Over 100 families, some of whom migrated from Czechoslovakia or Moravian, Slovakian, or Bohemian descent, came to Swartz Creek as farmers and workers. Until 1962, the parish was served by Czech-speaking priests, who, for most of those years, delivered sermons in Czech at one Mass and English at another. By April of 1953, a six-classroom school was constructed with an adjoining convent. From grades one to seven, 136 students filled the halls. In 1959, four classrooms were added on and the current church that stands today was completed and then renovated in 1984.\n\nThe school was closed in 2006. After the death of Father Amos Wischmeyer in January 2008, Bishop Carl F. Mengeling named Father Steven Mattson as pastor. In October 2008, many renovations began to foster more prayerful and beautiful Eucharistic liturgies."
