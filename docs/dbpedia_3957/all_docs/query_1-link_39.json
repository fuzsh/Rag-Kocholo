        "text": "Name and\n\ntown or village County and\n\ncoordinates Photograph Date[A] Notes Grade St Botolph\n\nBotolphs West Sussex\n\nAnglo-Saxon The nave and chancel are Saxon, and the south doorway dates from the 17th century. A north aisle was added in about 1250, but this was demolished in the early 19th century. Around the chancel arch are traces of medieval wall paintings.[6][7] I All Saints\n\nWest Stourmouth Kent\n\nAnglo-Saxon The oldest fabric in the church is Anglo-Saxon. The church was altered in the 12th century, but following earthquake damage in 1382 it was rebuilt. Windows were replaced in the 14th and 15th centuries, and the church was restored in 1845. It has been redundant since 1979. The base of a rood screen is still present inside the church.[8][9] I St Peter and St Paul (old)\n\nAlbury Surrey\n\n11th century The nave may date from the Anglo-Saxon era, and the lower part of the tower contains pre-Conquest masonry. The nave was extended in the 12th century, the chancel and south transept were added in the 13th century, followed by the south aisle in the following century. During the 19th century the Albury Park estate, in which the church stands, was owned by the banker Henry Drummond. He replaced the spire on the tower with a cupola, and commissioned A. W. N. Pugin to convert the south transept into a mortuary chapel.[10][11]\n\n[12]\n\nI St Thomas\n\nEast Shefford Berkshire\n\n11th century Norman features in the church include a north window, the font, and a piscina. Also in the church is the alabaster tomb of Sir Thomas Fettiplace, who died in 1447, and his wife, Lady Beatrice, who was a member of the Portuguese royal family. On the walls above the chancel arch are 12th-century paintings and painted texts. Worship ceased in the church in 1870, and its congregation transferred to a new church nearby.[13][14][15][16] I St Mary\n\nHigham Kent\n\n11th century The church is constructed in flint and ragstone, the flint arranged to give the appearance of horizontal stripes. The south aisle is almost as wide as the nave, and it is thought that this was added in the 14th century by a nunnery sited nearby at that time. The font is Norman, and between the nave and the Lady chapel is a 15th-century rood screen.[17][18][19] I All Saints\n\nLittle Somborne Hampshire\n\n11th century All Saints has a simple plan, consisting of a nave and a chancel in a single range. The church incorporates an Anglo-Saxon pilaster strip and a Norman round-headed doorway. In the churchyard is the grave of Thomas Sopwith, the pioneer aviator.[20][21][22] II* St Mary the Virgin\n\nNorth Stoke West Sussex\n\n11th century The ancient dedication of the church to Saint Mary the Virgin was rediscovered in 2007 by two amateur archaeologists. The church has a cruciform plan with a nave, chancel and two transepts. It contains windows in six different architectural styles. The oldest fitting is a 13th-century font.[23][24][25][26][27] I St Mary\n\nSandwich Kent\n\n11th century St Mary's has suffered from repeated damage: by the French in 1217 and again in 1457, and from an earthquake in 1578. In 1667 the central tower collapsed, and was rebuilt. In the 19th century the church was restored by Joseph Clarke. Since being made redundant it has been used as an arts centre.[28][29][30][31]\n\nI\n\nAll Saints\n\nShirburn Oxfordshire\n\n11th–12th century All Saints stands immediately to the south of Shirburn Castle, the seat of the Earls of Macclesfield. Its north chapel is the mausoleum of the Macclesfield family. The church was restored and largely rebuilt in 1876 by T. H. Wyatt.[32][33] II St Mary\n\nAshley Hampshire\n\nEarly 12th century The chancel was added later in the 12th century, and the windows date from the 15th and 16th centuries. The church was restored twice in the 19th century. Inside the church is a Norman font. There is a painting of a saint in the splay of one of the windows.[34][35] II* St Benedict\n\nPaddlesworth Kent\n\nEarly 12th century This simple church stands on the Pilgrims' Way. It closed as a church in 1678 and was then used for some 250 years for non-religious purposes, including use as a farm building. A gallery was added in the 19th century, and the church was restored twice during the 20th century.[36][37] II* St Mary\n\nBurham Kent\n\n12th century Standing on the Pilgrims' Way, this church served a now-deserted village. Its north and south aisles have been demolished. Inside the church are two Norman fonts.[38][39] I St Mary\n\nCapel-le-Ferne Kent\n\n12th century St Mary's stands in an isolated position. A stone chancel arch was added in the 14th century containing a three-bay arcade. Above the arcade is a large round-headed opening that silhouetted the rood cross, a feature unique in England. The church also contains a memorial to General Sir Charles William Dunbar Staveley, who died in 1896.[40][41] I St Margaret\n\nCatmore Berkshire\n\n12th century The Norman features in this church include two doorways and the font. The nave roof dates from 1607. During the 19th century the church was restored and Norman Revival features were added, which were more ornate than the original Norman features.[42][43][44] I Lumley Chapel\n\nCheam Greater London\n\n12th century The chapel consists of the east end of the chancel of a former church that had been converted into a memorial chapel for the Lumley family of nearby Nonsuch Palace. It contains memorials to the Lumleys and to other families. The chapel is the oldest standing building in the London Borough of Sutton.[45][46][47][48] II* St Peter ad Vincula\n\nColemore Hampshire\n\n12th century The plan of this church was formerly cruciform, but in 1669 the parishioners considered that the interior was too dark, and they successfully petitioned the bishop for the south transept to be removed. The remaining north transept has a 12th-century doorway in its west wall, a 12th-century window in the north wall, and an 11th-century window in the east wall. Inside the church are a 12th-century font made from Purbeck Marble and a 16th-century wooden screen.[49][50][51] II* St Michael\n\nEast Peckham Kent\n\n12th century St Michael's expanded to its present size in about 1300, and it was restored in the 19th century by Joseph Clarke. It contains one Norman window. Elsewhere there are Perpendicular-style windows that were renewed during the restoration.[52][53] II* St Mary\n\nFleet Marston Buckinghamshire\n\n12th century Set in an isolated position surrounded by fields, the church was restored by George Gilbert Scott in 1868. John Wesley preached a sermon here soon after his ordination in 1725. The fittings of the church include a Norman font.[54][55]\n\n[56]\n\nII* St Mary the Virgin\n\nFordwich Kent\n\n12th century Dating mainly from the Norman era, the church incorporates some Saxon material in the nave. Inside the church are box pews, and a civic pew containing a stand to hold the mayor's mace. Also in the church is the Fordwich stone, dating from about 1100 and considered to be part of the former shrine of a saint.[57][58][59] I St Bartholomew\n\nGoodnestone Kent\n\n12th century The plan of this flint church is simple, consisting of a nave with a north porch, and a chancel. The porch was rebuilt in 1837 after it had been damaged by an earth tremor. The stained glass in the east window is by Thomas Willement.[60][61] I St Mary\n\nLuddenham Kent\n\n12th century This flint church stands in a farmyard, and its structure incorporates some re-used Roman tiles.

The church was damaged in a fire in 1681 and rebuilt, then enlarged in 1831. However, by 1885 its fabric had deteriorated so much that, except for the chancel, it was demolished, and a new church with the same dedication was built nearer the centre of the village.[68][69] II* St Mary Magdalene\n\nTortington West Sussex\n\n12th century Both the doorway and the chancel arch are Norman in style, and are decorated with elaborate carvings. The font dates from the 12th century, and some of the windows contain stained glass from the Kempe studio.[70][71] II All Saints\n\nWaldershare Kent\n\n12th century Mortuary chapels were added to the church in about 1697 and in about 1712, and the main part of the church was restored and virtually rebuilt in 1886 by Ewan Christian. The chapels contain large and elaborate memorials. Also in the church are wall paintings by Clayton and Bell dating from about 1886. The North Downs Way passes through the churchyard.[72][73][74] II* St John the Baptist\n\nUpper Eldon Hampshire\n\nLate 12th century Despite repairs in the 18th century, the condition of the building was so bad by the following century that it was being used as a cowshed. Since being vested in the Trust, further repairs have been undertaken. Around the church are nine consecration cross stones, each consisting of a circle in which there are five holes that formerly held metal crosses.[75][76][77] II* St Andrew (Old)\n\nKingsbury Greater London\n\n12th-13th century The condition of this church had deteriorated towards the end of the 18th century. A major restoration was carried out in 1840, and it became a chapel of ease to a church in another part of the parish. In 1933 a new church, also dedicated to Saint Andrew, was moved from the Marylebone area of London and erected adjacent to the older church.[78][79][80] The church is now used as a place of worship by the Romanian Orthodox Church under a 20-year lease.[81] I St Giles'\n\nMerston West Sussex\n\nEarly 13th century The church is small and simple, consisting of a nave and chancel without any division, a narrow north aisle, and a south porch.

It contains a large monument dating from 1537 flanked by carvings depicting Saint George and the martyrdom of Saint Agnes. Also in the chapel is modern stained glass, including a window by Michael Farrar-Bell.[88][89] I St James\n\nCooling Kent\n\n13th century Building of the church was complete by about 1400.

The transepts and the tower were added in the middle of the 19th century. When its functions were replaced by a new parish church, it became a mortuary chapel. On its walls are the remains of 13th-century wall paintings, including one depicting Saint Christopher.[97][98][99] II* St Mary\n\nPitstone Buckinghamshire\n\n13th century St Mary's is constructed in limestone and flint. It has a three-stage tower with a stair turret, and an embattled parapet. The axis of the chancel is inclined to the north. In the church are a stoup, a squint, a piscina with a crocketted gable, a 12th-century font, and a 17th-century hexagonal pulpit with a sounding board.[100][101][102] I St Peter\n\nPreston Park East Sussex\n\n13th century This church stands in the grounds of Preston Manor. The nave was restored in 1872 by James Woodman when the south vestry was added. The chancel was restored in 1878 by Ewan Christian; this included stencil decoration of the walls. The nave was damaged by fire in 1906, and restored by P. M. Johnston. The fire damaged the 14th-century wall paintings, but fragments remain depicting, among other subjects, the martyrdom of Thomas à Becket and The Nativity.[103][104] II* St Peter\n\nSandwich Kent\n\n13th century In 1560 St Peter's became the church for a group of Dutch Protestants. The tower collapsed in 1661, destroying the south aisle. The tower was rebuilt, but the south aisle was left ruined and the south arcade was filled in. A cupola was added to the top of the tower. In the 1860s the west end was restored after it was damaged in a storm. Under the chancel is a vaulted undercroft lit by two 13th-century openings, which was probably used as a charnel house.[105][106][107] I St Peter\n\nSwingfield Kent\n\n13th century The 13th-century square tower has a circular southwest stair turret rising higher than the tower.

At the west end is a bell turret with a broach spire. It was restored in the early 18th century when a timber screen was inserted between the nave and chancel. This contains three arches, above which is a tympanum elaborately painted with the royal arms of Queen Anne. Most of the other fittings also date from this restoration.[110][111][112] I St Bartholomew\n\nLower Basildon Berkshire\n\nLate 13th century The tower was built in 1734, and during a restoration in 1875–76 the porch and north aisle were added.

The agricultural reformer Jethro Tull was christened and buried in the church.[113][114] I St Lawrence\n\nBroughton Buckinghamshire\n\n14th century The church is notable for its wall paintings dating from about 1400. When they were rediscovered during a restoration in 1849 they had been covered in plaster for 300 years. The paintings were restored in the 1930s and depict, among other subjects, Saint George and the dragon, and Saints Helena and Eligius. There is also a doom painting and a Pietà; these were intended to be a warning against swearing. The stained glass includes windows designed by A. Gibbs and C. E. Kempe.[115][116] I St Michael\n\nThornton Buckinghamshire\n\n14th century The plan of the church consists of a nave with north and south aisles. The chancel and a north chapel were demolished between 1780 and 1800 when the church was reordered. The aisles contain box pews, including a larger one for the lord of the manor. There is no seating in the nave, which is occupied by a series of memorials. One of these is a re-assembled tomb chest that had been moved out of the church in the 19th century and used to form a grotto.[117][118][119][120] I St Clement\n\nKnowlton Kent\n\n14th–15th century Originally the private chapel to Knowlton Court, it later became a parish church. It contains monuments to members of the families who lived in Knowlton Court, including the Peyton Baronets. Other memorials are one to Sir John Narborough, who died in 1688, and another to his sons, John and James, who together with Cloudesley Shovell died in a shipwreck off the Scilly Islands in 1707. The latter memorial has been attributed to Grinling Gibbons.[121][122] I St George\n\nEsher Surrey\n\n1540 Built shortly after the Reformation, this church is in Tudor style. In 1725 an extension was added to the south of the nave known as the Newcastle Pew. This was designed as a family pew by Sir John Vanbrugh for the 1st Duke of Newcastle. At its front, overlooking the nave, is a row of Corinthian columns surmounted by a pediment. The church also contains a three-decker pulpit with a tester.[123][124][125] I Chandos Mausoleum\n\nLittle Stanmore Greater London\n\n1735 The mausoleum was added to the north side of the church of St Lawrence Whitchurch for the 1st Duke of Chandos in 1735.

The Trust has carried out repairs, including rebuilding the roof in its original design using Westmorland slate.[129][130][131] II* St Katherine\n\nChiselhampton Oxfordshire\n\n1762 St Katherine's is a Georgian church with rendered walls and limestone dressings. At the west end is a two-stage turret, the lower stage containing a clock, and the upper stage being open. Other than the 17th-century pulpit, all the fittings date from the 18th century. When the church was threatened with demolition in the 1950s, its survival was supported by Sir John Betjeman who wrote a verse relating to it.[132][133] II* St Peter\n\nWallingford Oxfordshire\n\n1763 The spire, designed by Sir Robert Taylor, was added in 1776–77, and the chancel was built in 1904.

A gallery runs round the whole of the interior, with the organ at the east end. The rich sat in pews in the gallery, while the poor were on the benches below. The three-decker pulpit stands in a central position at the east end; it is circular and is carried on a spirally fluted stem.[140][141] I St Andrew\n\nHove East Sussex\n\n1827–28 This is the first church in England to be designed in Italianate style, the architect being Sir Charles Barry. In 1882 Barry's son, Edward Middleton Barry, added the chancel, and further additions were made in 1925, including baldacchinos around the altar and the font. Surmounting the west front is a clock turret. Above the crossing is a dome, the interior of which is painted blue. Under the church is a crypt. During the 19th century the church was used by members of the royal family and the aristocracy.[142][143] I St Mary\n\nLambourn Woodlands Berkshire\n\n1852 Thomas Talbot Bury, a pupil of Augustus Charles Pugin, designed the church in Gothic Revival style.

Pugin, and it has remained virtually unaltered since. In a niche above the main doorway is a sculpture of Saint Catherine, and over the vestry door is a sculpture of the Conversion of Saint Paul. All the fittings and furniture were designed by Pugin, including the stained glass, which was made by Hardman.[146][147][148] II St Mary\n\nItchen Stoke Hampshire\n\n1866 The church was designed by Henry Conybeare, the brother of its rector, in French Gothic style, and was based on La Sainte-Chapelle in Paris.
