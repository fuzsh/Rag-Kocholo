        "text": "First there was camping, then there was glamping, and now, there’s Champing. Church camping is revolutionising the traditional camping break, giving you exclusive use of some of the UK’s greatest listed buildings for the most unforgettable sleepover of your life.\n\nChamping came about in finding long term, sustainable uses for stunning churches that are no longer used for regular worship. Cared for by The Churches Conservation Trust, these magnificent buildings are some of the greatest architectural wonders our country has to offer, and often come with fascinating histories too. So what better way to appreciate one than to stay in it?\n\nFor a true Champing pilgrimage, pack your bags for a visit to The Church of St Mary the Virgin in England’s tiniest town, Fordwich. Just three miles from historic Canterbury, this Norman beauty sits on the Way of St Augustine and has welcomed pilgrims for centuries. With later medieval additions, a striking spire, and an idyllic location on the banks of the River Stour, you can look forward to a heavenly stay in this incredible ancient wonder.\n\nOnce you step inside, this incredible space is yours to enjoy. You’ll see the ChampBots will have set out everything you need for your stay – comfy, fold-out camp beds, camping chairs and cushions for an extra touch of home. If you want to move things around just to your liking, go ahead! After all, this is your home for the night, and you’re free to arrange it as you please.\n\nThose ChampBots are even kind enough to provide teabags, coffee, hot chocolate, sugar, long-life milk and all your cups and cutlery – everything you need for your well-earned cuppa on arrival. Bottled water is provided, as are camping lanterns and battery candles for when it gets dark at night. There’s even a ChampLav set up for you – a dry separating toilet to take care of all necessities.\n\nForget any preconceptions of tiptoeing round and whispering in the church; as your home for the night, you’re free to chat, laugh, sing, dance around – whatever takes your fancy. Kids can run about or play the best game of hide-and-seek ever, while adults can relax back in a camping chair with a bottle of wine (bring your own, or pre-order when booking – the ChampBots even provide the corkscrew!).\n\nThere’s also so much to look at inside The Church of St Mary the Virgin, you might not know where to start! Savour the Saxon windows in the nave, admire the ancient beams above, or bed down in a box pew for an unforgettable night’s sleep. The stunning wall fixtures date back to the 17th century and are well worth a peruse, including the Royal Arms of James II displayed proudly over the chancel arch.\n\nKeep reading\n\nMore information\n\nYou’ll also find a particularly unusual feature in The Church of St Mary the Virgin – a large block of limestone in the north aisle. Standing 1.7 metres tall, the Fordwich Stone is believed to date to 1100, and was most likely part of a former shrine to St Augustine of Canterbury. It even spent a spell at Canterbury Cathedral in the Georgian era before coming back to Fordwich in 1877. Now, you don’t get one of those in every holiday home!\n\nAfter you’ve woken to birdsong and sunlight spilling through, step beyond your church door for a wander round quaint Fordwich. It may be the smallest town England has to offer, but it has no fewer than two pubs, as well as a stunning town hall, virtually untouched since 1544.\n\nCanterbury is a must-see, and with a footpath leading directly from the church to this beautiful city, getting there couldn’t be easier. Of course a visit to the Cathedral will be on your list, but also pay a visit to the Canterbury Heritage Museum and the Eastbridge Pilgrim Hospital for a fascinating journey back in time.\n\nChamping not only gives you a break from modern life, it also gives you a break from cooking. You can’t cook inside the church or churchyard, but why not tuck in instead to delicious home-cooked comforts at Fordwich’s pubs? The George and the Dragon is a 30-second walk down the road, while The Fordwich Arms is just next door to the church – perfect. You can also order a fabulous ‘Champer Hamper’, brimming with breakfast goodies from local suppliers for an indulgent start to the day.\n\nSadly, the time will come to leave The Church of St Mary the Virgin, but it couldn’t be more hassle-free. After your departure, the ChampBots will take everything away as if by magic. You don’t get that in a camping field!\n\nWhether you’re young or young at heart, part of a group or traveling on your own, a spot of Champing should definitely be on your bucket list! And for quintessential English charm in the stunning Kent countryside, The Church of St Mary the Virgin is a wonderful place to start.\n\nThings to note\n\nChampingseason runs March – September, no minimum stay requirement, Champers should bring their own bedding including pillows, sleeping bags, duvets and blankets, up to two (or three if they are small) dogs are welcome upon prior arrangement, children are welcome and encouraged to stay although they must be supervised and no ball games are permitted in the church yard, Champers are welcome to bring their own alcohol, and wine may be pre-ordered on booking. Champers have sole access to their church after 6pm and before 10am.\n\nSee the video below to find out how the Champing team transform an empty, serene church (St Thomas, Friarmere) into a cosy champ and back again, in the blink of an eye."
