Met by Vera who was most welcoming to the church. Ate dinner in The Plough and met locals in The Crown over a nightcap where we also booked bacon sarnies for the morning.… Read more “All Saints, Claverley”\n\nMyself and 4 friends heard of champing recently, and decided we’d give it a go, and so booked in for 1 night at St Mary’s in Stansted. When we arrived, it was in such a beautiful spot surrounded by countryside and fields with little nature walks, and such a beautiful churchyard, we took a while… Read more “St Mary’s Church, Stansted, Mountfitchet”\n\nWe stayed at St Andrew’s last night and it was our first time champing.

What an unusual experience. Where can you pay that money and get the whole church to yourself. The set up was very cute and they’d thought of everything in the circumstances of a big church. Loo was totally fine too. We… Read more “Stansted Mountfitchet St Mary the Virgin”\n\nWe had a very lovely welcome from Charlotte . The church is beautiful, very comfortable and peaceful . We truly had the best night’s sleep . A wonderful first Champing… Read more “Clifton St Luke’s Church”\n\nIt was a great pleasure to be here over night. Never had a sleeping room like this. A good stay after having come from Dover. Using monuments in this unconventional way is a good idea and it increases the reception of our heritage in a different context. Warm clothes during the night are indispensable. We… Read more “St. James’ Church, Cooling”\n\nMy 3rd experience champing and it was lovely to have some heating!!
