We are located in Liverpool of the Greater Syracuse Region. We welcome you to join us for worship and fellowship centered on the Gospel and Sacraments of our Lord Jesus Christ. We are Evangelistic as we share the Gospel; Catholic as we continue in Apostolic tradition; and Sacramental as we worship God through the Sacraments of the Gospel.\n\nIn today's empty society, we aim to stand as a beacon pointing to Jesus as \"the way, the truth, and the life,\" and the historic faith and life of the Church of the first centuries as the model for Christians today. We welcome all people to come and join us in worship and fellowship; to mature in Christ; and to be part of a Community of faith, family, and charity!"
