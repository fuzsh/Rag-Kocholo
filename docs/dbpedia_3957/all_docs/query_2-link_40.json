        "text": "Our church was founded in 1842 to serve the German settlers from Bavaria. Like the town, the Parish was also placed under the patronage of Mary, our most Blessed Mother. Growth came with the arrival of relatives and friends of the early settlers, then with the arrival of the Irish, who came with the early railroads. Many of the other ethnic backgrounds eventually moved to the area and worshiped in the parish eventually making it not only Catholic in faith, but Catholic in the acceptance of all enrolled as parishioners."
