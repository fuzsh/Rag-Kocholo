        "text": "Before delving into the significance of the House of the Virgin Mary, it is essential to understand the historical context of Ephesus. This ancient city, located near the Aegean Sea, was once a bustling port and a center of trade and culture in the Mediterranean region. Ephesus flourished during the Hellenistic and Roman periods and was known for its magnificent architecture, including the grand Temple of Artemis.\n\nThe Legend of the House\n\nAccording to Christian tradition, after the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, the apostle John took Mary to Ephesus for safety. It is believed that Mary lived the final years of her life in a small stone house on Bulbul Mountain, which later became known as the House of the Virgin Mary. The legend of Mary’s presence in Ephesus has been passed down through generations, attracting pilgrims who seek solace and blessings.\n\nIt is important to note that the details of these events are based on traditions and later accounts, as there is no direct biblical evidence or archaeological findings to confirm the exact circumstances of Mary’s life after the crucifixion of Jesus.\n\nMyth or Fact?\n\nAs per the Gospel of John and early Christian interpretations, Jesus entrusted John the Apostle with the care of His Mother, Mary, just before His death. Consequently, it is plausible that John would have taken her with him to Ephesus. After the crucifixion, John, Mary, and other disciples likely left Jerusalem to disseminate Jesus’ message and avoid persecution.\n\nJesus’ arrest and crucifixion on political grounds as the “King of the Jews” made his family and followers suspicious of the authorities. While some, like Jesus’ brother James, remained in Jerusalem, others scattered worldwide. Thomas went east, Mark south, and various followers dispersed around the Mediterranean. Traditions suggest that Mary Magdalene accompanied others to southern France, and a well-established belief places Mary, the Mother of Jesus, in Ephesus. However, historical records for these events are limited, and our understanding relies on isolated passages that reflect traditional beliefs.\n\nFirst Evidence: Synodal Letter of the Council of Ephesus\n\nThe earliest reference to the possibility of St. Mary residing in Ephesus can be traced back to the synodal letter of the Council of Ephesus in 431. This letter mentions the city of Ephesians as the place where John the Theologian and St. Mary, the Virgin Mother of God, lived and were buried.\n\nSecond Evidence: Writings of Bar-Hebraeu\n\nAnother account comes from Bar-Hebraeus, a Jacobite bishop who wrote in the 13th century, suggesting that St. John took Mary with him to Patmos and later established the Church of Ephesus. This leaves uncertainty about whether Mary spent her final days in Patmos or in Ephesus, as the exact place of her death is not specified.\n\nThird Evidence: Pope Benedict XIV\n\nIn the 17th century, Pope Benedict XIV claimed that Mary followed St. John to Ephesus. He even had plans to remove the lessons from the Breviary that mentioned Mary’s death in Jerusalem, but unfortunately, he passed away before he could carry out this intention.\n\nThese various accounts from different historical periods have contributed to the ongoing debate about the true location of St. Mary’s residence after the crucifixion of Jesus. The lack of direct evidence from the biblical texts and the span of time between the events and the recorded accounts add complexity to the question of where St. Mary lived and died. As a result, the tradition linking St. Mary to Ephesus remains a subject of historical and religious discussion.\n\nSource: “The Enduring Goddess: Artemis and Mary, Mother of Jesus”, Carla Ionescu – 2016\n\nThe question of whether Mary actually lived in Ephesus remains a topic of debate among scholars and religious historians. While some believe the House of the Virgin Mary in Ephesus to be the place where Mary lived, the evidence supporting this claim is not considered strong enough by all scholars.\n\nThe Sacred Sanctuary\n\nDiscovery of the House\n\nCatherine Emmerich, born in 1774, was a German Augustinian nun and mystic known for her vivid visions and religious experiences. In the early 19th century, she became renowned for her accounts of the life of Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary. One of the most significant events detailed in Emmerich’s visions was the House of the Virgin Mary. According to her accounts, the House of the Virgin Mary, also known as the “Blessed House,” was the place where Mary lived during her final years. Her close friend, the German poet, and writer Clemens Brentano, meticulously recorded these visions.\n\nOn October 18, 1881, relying on the descriptions in the book by Brentano based on his conversations with Emmerich, a French priest, the Abbé Julien Gouyet discovered a small stone building on a mountain overlooking the Aegean Sea and the ruins of ancient Ephesus in Turkey. He believed it was the house described by Emmerich and where the Virgin Mary had lived the final years of her life.\n\nAbbé Gouyet’s discovery was not taken seriously by most people, but ten years later, urged by Sister Marie de Mandat-Grancey, two Lazarist missionaries, Father Poulin and Father Jung, from Smyrna rediscovered the building on July 29, 1891, using the same source for a guide. They learned that the four-walled, roofless ruin had been venerated for a long time by members of the mountain village of Sirince, 17 km distant, descended from Ephesus’s early Christians. The house is called Panaya Kapulu (“Doorway to the Virgin”). Every year pilgrims made a pilgrimage to the site on August 15, the date on which most of the Christian world celebrated Mary’s Dormition/Assumption. Source\n\nArchitecture and Design\n\nThe House of the Virgin Mary is a humble structure made of stone and brick, reflecting the simple life Mary is believed to have led in seclusion. The interior consists of a central room and a small altar, while the exterior features a courtyard and a prayer wall where visitors leave their petitions and prayers.\n\nPilgrimages and Religious Significance\n\nChristian Beliefs\n\nFor Christians, the House of the Virgin Mary holds immense religious importance as it symbolizes Mary’s role as the mother of Jesus Christ. Many believe that being in the presence of where Mary once lived brings them closer to the divine and strengthens their faith.\n\nMiraculous Stories\n\nOver the years, numerous pilgrims have reported experiencing miracles, healing, and divine interventions after visiting the House of the Virgin Mary. These stories have further solidified the sanctuary’s reputation as a place of supernatural grace and blessings.\n\nRestoration and Preservation Efforts\n\nThe annual pilgrimages to the House of St. Mary began in 1896, leading to its restoration and transformation into a pilgrimage center operated by the Lazarist order. Extensive cleanup and restoration efforts were made, and excavations were conducted to find the Virgin Mary’s grave based on visions from Catherine Emmerich, but no conclusive results were found. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the site was reconstructed as a chapel and a residence for guests and sisters.\n\nDuring World War I, the property faced challenges, but after the war, the pilgrimages resumed in 1949, aided by the Turkish government’s construction of a paved access road. The final restoration of the House of St. Mary took place in 1951. In 1952, the Association of the Friends of Ephesus and Anne Catherine Emmerich was established to promote pilgrimages. The property changed ownership several times until George B. Quatman, an American entrepreneur, purchased it in 1955, sponsoring further developments around the House of Mary, including homes for priests and nuns.\n\nVisiting the House of the Virgin Mary Today\n\nEntrance\n\nOnce you arrive at the House of Virgin Mary site, walk past the souvenir shops and café to gain entry to the site.\n\nBaptism Pool\n\nAs you go to the church, you’ll find some small souvenir shops before reaching a spacious garden. In the center of this garden is a baptismal pool designed in the shape of a key.\n\nVirgin Mary Statue\n\nNext to the baptismal pool is a small bronze statue of the Virgin Mary surrounded by olive trees planted by Lazarist priests. This statue was gifted to the area in 1867 by a religious community from Izmir.\n\nPraying Section\n\nAs you approach the house, a praying section can be found on the left. Per the Falling Asleep belief, Virgin Mary passed away peacefully without any pain and was taken to the heavens three days later. Every year, two significant rituals occur – the first on the last Sunday of May for Christians residing in Izmir and the second on August 15 at 10:30 am. These gatherings draw large crowds.\n\nHouse\n\nAfter a while, you will arrive at the house. It has a simple look with plain stone bricks and a small size, which might make it seem insignificant. The bottom half of the house is the original Virgin Mary’s house, but the Catholic church restored the top part and tried to maintain its original appearance as much as possible. Once inside, visitors go through a metal door and pick a candle before entering the main area where a statue of the Virgin Mary stands.\n\nPrayer Candles\n\nAfter leaving the house, you will find verses from the Qur’an and the Bible about the Virgin Mary, after spending time here reading verses in every language. You can light your candle.\n\nHoly Water\n\nAt the end of the visit to the Virgin Mary’s House, you will find three fountains on the right side, a few steps down. There is a small gift shop near the stairs, run by the Virgin Mary Association, which was founded by both Muslims and Christians in the area. The association relies solely on donations and the turnover of this little gift shop for revenue. You can purchase empty bottles from this gift shop.\n\nThe water from the nearby springs is believed to have healing powers, so visitors drink from the fountains and fill their bottles to take home. You can also take a sip from any metal tap and make a wish. According to local urban legends, each tap represents an aspect of life, with one reflecting wealth, another health, and the last one fertility. Although they are not labeled, whichever tap you drink from is said to come true.\n\nWishing Wall\n\nWhen you visit the Church of the Virgin Mary, you’ll notice small pieces of paper and napkins hanging on the wall. This starts right by the holy water and extends along the entire wall. Surprisingly, people come here to make wishes. They write their wishes on these napkins or pieces of paper, which are then attached to thousands of other wishes. This creates a unique wishing tradition.\n\nHouse of Virgin Mary Mass Hours\n\nOther questions you may wonder about the house\n\nWhere to sleep near Mary’s House?\n\nSelcuk and Kusadasi provide convenient options for travelers looking to explore the house surroundings, so choosing between the two depends on your personal preferences and itinerary.\n\nSelcuk\n\nSelcuk is the closest town to Ephesus, located just a few kilometers away.
