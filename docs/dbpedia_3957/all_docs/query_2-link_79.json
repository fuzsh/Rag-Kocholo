Doug Zimmerman  \nRector\n\n  \n\n\nServices at St Mary’s\n\nWe know that attending any Church Service for the first time can be scary, so we like to do our best to make you feel relaxed and at home. Here's our normal pattern of Sunday Services:\n\nSunday 8am Said Eucharist (BCP) - A Service that uses the Book of Common Prayer (loved for its older language), but without any hymns to sing. There is a short talk. Books are provided.\n\nSunday 10am Sung Eucharist - A Service that includes hymns to sing, and a talk. You'll be given a sheet as you arrive, with prayers and text that we all say together during the Service.\n\nFirst Sunday of the Month - 10am is an All-Age Eucharist - adults and children together for the whole Service. Second and Fourth Sunday of the Month - 10am we have Sunday School for the children.\n\nThere's tea and coffee served after the 10am Service. Please stay and let us get to know you better!",
