        "text": "\"From now on, will all ages call me blessed.\" (Luke 1:48-49)\n\nOn the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we celebrate the Blessed Mother's assumption into heaven, body and soul, at the end of her earthly life. Although it is the oldest of the feasts celebrating Mary, dating back to the fourth - sixth centuries, it wasn't until 1950 that Pope Pius XII formally defined it as a dogma of the Catholic Church.\n\n\"This feast shows not only that the dead body of the Blessed Virgin Mary remained incorrupt, but that she gained a triumph out of death, her heavenly glorification after the example of her only begotten Son, Jesus Christ,\" Pope Pius XII wrote in his apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus.\n\nThe dogma of the Blessed Mother's assumption, the pope wrote, \"is contained in the deposit of Christian faith entrusted to the Church.\" The proof, he said, can we found in early sacred writings, in the wisdom of theologians and doctors of the Church, and in the minds of the faithful.\n\n\"Since our Redeemer is the Son of Mary, he could not do otherwise, as the perfect observer of God's law, than to honor not only his eternal Father but also his most beloved Mother. And, since it was within his power to grant her this great honor, to preserve her from the corruption of the tomb, we must believe that he really acted in this way.\"\n\nIt is not known on which day Mary's Assumption actually took place, but the solemnity is celebrated on August 15 and is a holy day of obligation.\n\nYou will find Mass times listed by parish below.
