        "text": "The Church of St Mary the Virgin, Hemington has a long history. Originally built by the Normans it was enlarged from 1230 onwards over the next hundred years. The font inside the church dates from 1260. The Norman chancel arch inside the church is particularly fine.\n\nThe church was heavily restored in 1859 by Sir George Gilbert Scott. However on Tuesday 21 November 1899 a local labourer discovered a fire above the organ. The fire was eventually extinguished, however significant damage was caused to the medieval roof, most of which was lost. The fire is believed to have started in a small stove located in the vestry.\n\nThe church has recently reopened to the public following extensive repairs and conservation work. The total cost of these repairs, including signage, education and interpretation for the church cost in excess of Â£365,000."
