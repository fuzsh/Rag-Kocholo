        "text": "Dear Family and Friends,\n\nThe loss of a loved one is perhaps the most difficult experience that any person must bear. Please know that we are praying for you during this time of grief.\n\nIn the Christian faith we are consoled by the knowledge that death is not the last word. Rather, through Jesus Christ, resurrection is assured.\n\nIn the Episcopal tradition, therefore, a service of burial (commonly called a funeral) is rooted in the hope of resurrection. Indeed, we often refer to a funeral as “an Easter liturgy.”\n\nAs you look through this book, keep in mind the words of St. Paul, who wrote, “I am convinced that neither death nor life...nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” -Romans 8:38-39\n\nPeace and Blessings,\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Todd Cederberg"
