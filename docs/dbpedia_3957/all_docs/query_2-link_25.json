Volunteers and donation of food needed! Contact the Rector for further information.\n\nReflections on Rwanda\n\nOn Tuesday evening I returned home from “Listening and Leading: the Art and Science of Peace, Resilience and Transformational Justice from Rwanda to the World. It is the 30th anniversary year of the 1994 genocide which killed 500,000-800,000 Tutsi’s, plus moderate Hutu’s and the super minority Twa people.\n\nAt the conference we heard from UN dignitaries, clinical psychologists, genetic researchers, faith leaders, and artists for presentations about warning signs or threats of genocide, ideas about prevention, generational (including genetic) impact, strategies for supporting people who are recovering both as survivors and former perpetrators, and what it takes for a society to recover from mass trauma. Some of the conference was held at the Kigali Genocide Memorial, so we saw the memorialization and testimony that is part of the process of healing. There was so much information, so many stories and impressions, that I am quite sure I will be continuing to learn and process my experience for a long time.\n\nI share a few early learnings here:\n\nFirst, it was striking to be in a country where the government prioritized people’s mental health and recovery from trauma. Government programs offer material resources, like a home to live in or a job as well as counselors and therapists for both individuals and communities.\n\nSecond, the message in Rwanda is the government’s commitment to forgiveness and reconciliation. There is a lot to learn from people who have managed to forgive perpetrators of genocide, including the people who killed their entire family.\n\nFinally, I continue to think about what the human community needs to do in order to intervene in situations of such rampant and targeted evil. Alice Wairmu Nderitu, the UN Under-Secretary-General and Special Advisor on the Prevention of Genocide, said “we are better prepared to respond [to threats of genocide], but we are not inclined to respond.” And she called us all to pay attention and lend our voices and attention to what is happening in Sudan.\n\nI look forward to continuing to try to understand these lessons of the capacity for human evil, and the work of reconciliation.\n\nCreative Arts Project Summer Program for Children\n\nFREE arts-based summer camp\n\nlast week of August\n\nFor the second year St. Mary’s will collaborate with St. Peter’s and Church of the Heavenly Rest to offer music, dance, arts & crafts for elementary aged children.\n\nFor more information, or to register use the QR code, or contact the Rev. Lisha Epperson: 646-841-5973, lisha@stpeterschelsea.org.\n\nVolunteers welcome to help with lunch especially!\n\nConnie & Jessie Mae’s Pantry\n\nDespensa de Connie y Jessie Mae\n\nAugust 28, 2024\n\n1 pm – 3 pm\n\nSave the date!\n\nSt. Mary’s Sunday September 8\n\n10:30 am Festive Worship\n\nthe Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary\n\nour last official day of celebration of St. Mary’s 200th anniversary,\n\nincluding the unveiling and dedication of NY Landmarks Preservation Foundation plaque,\n\nand the announcement of a special campaign “A Bright Future on a Sure Foundation” for the transformation of the Undercroft!\n\nSt. Mary’s Thrift Shop is open!\n\nLa tienda de secunda mano de Sta Maria esta abierta!\n\nFRIDAYS | VIERNES 2 PM – 4 PM\n\nSATURDAYS | SABADOS 12 noon -5 PM\n\nSUNDAYS | DOMINGOS 12 noon -2 PM\n\nClothing | Ropas – Kitchen items | Cosas por la cocina – Dishes | Platos\n\nREAD MORE | LEER MAS\n\na new ministry:\n\n‘survival english’ for recent immigrants\n\non Mondays June 24 to July 29\n\nfrom 6 pm – 8 pm\n\nOver the past two years, thousands of migrants have arrived to New York City in search of asylum. While the city initially responded with welcome- setting up an Arrivals Center, launching new shelters, and creating an Asylum Application Help Center- those resources have since been stretched thin. Current, single migrants are only guaranteed 30 days of shelter unless they can prove they’ve made significant progress towards self-sustainability through attending English classes, applying for jobs, applying for asylum etc. At the same time, services such as English classes and workforce development programs now have significant waitlists.\n\nThrough an all-volunteer effort, St. Mary’s will help fill this gap by offering weekly Survival English classes and ready-to-eat meals to recently arrived migrants. Migrants will be able to use attendance at these classes as proof to shelters that they are actively working towards independence, so that they can hopefully be granted additional time in the shelter. St. Mary’s will offer our newest neighbors a place to build and participate in a supportive community.\n\nTo make this new ministry successful, we need both volunteers and donations for supplies and food.\n\nVolunteers Needed!\n\nDinner Volunteers: People who can plan and cook a dinner for 15-20 individuals on Monday night. Stipends available to help offset food costs!\n\nAssistant Teachers: Assistant teachers will work with small groups (3-5 people) to lead conversation and facilitate activities. You do not need to be a teacher to do this role- we’ll have printouts and guidelines for you to follow!\n\nHead Teacher: Head teachers will facilitate the overall flow of class. Previous teaching experience helpful.\n\nDrivers: Individuals who are willing to pick up food from Dinner volunteers and deliver to St. Marys.\n\n¡Próximamente en agosto!\n\nÚnase al diácono-en-formación Simón Morell para conocerse, disfrutar de la comunidad y planificar actividades para personas latinas en Sta. Maria en el jardín o salón parroquial dependiendo del clima.\n\nRegular Weekly/Monthly Events & Services\n\nEventos y servicios regulares\n\nIf you are not on our “parish news” list, and would like to receive weekly Friday updates, please email the Rector.\n\nSi no está en nuestra lista de “noticias parroquiales” y desea recibir actualizaciones semanales los viernes, envíe un ecorreo al rector.\n\nCommunity Fridge 24/7\n\nNevera comunitaria 24/7\n\nFree food is available to everyone in our community 24/7.
