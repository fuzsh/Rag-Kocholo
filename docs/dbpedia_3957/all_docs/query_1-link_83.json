        "text": "Holy Innocents' is a community church. The nave was reordered in 2014 to create an open space for concerts, art exhibitions, village celebrations and private receptions. The 14th-century timber roof is well displayed by modern lighting. The stone benches around the nave walls are a reminder of an era before pews were introduced. The church is part of the Barham Downs Benefice and conducts regular Sunday services. The chancel retains ancient pews and 13th-century tiles along with Victorian renovations by William White from 1869-70. The Hedgeland organ dates from 1872 and needs renovation. The stained glass windows are Victorian, apart from a few preserved fragments of medieval glass.\n\nThe present building dates from 1150 to 1350 - of local flints with stone dressings and has evolved from its foundation c.624 when the manor of Adisham was given by King Eadbald of Kent to Christchurch Cathedral. The Norman font is of Purbeck marble. It was authenticated by the Courtauld Institute in 1993. In the reign of Mary 1 the Rector, John Bland, was imprisoned in Canterbury Castle and burned at the stake in 1555 on a charge of heresy. His name is on the Martyrs' Memorial in Wincheap. The church is Grade 1 listed.\n\nTimings & Tours\n\nSaturday 14 September:\n\n10:00 - 17:00\n\nLocation & directions\n\nHoly Innocents' Church, Pond Hill, Adisham, Kent, CT3 3LH\n\nDirections:\n\nThe Church is at the top of Pond Hill.
