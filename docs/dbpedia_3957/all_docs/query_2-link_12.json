Sunday worship is the cornerstone of St. Mary's community, as we gather together to reflect, rejoice, and pray.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nMusic\n\nWe believe that music is an essential part of our worship experience and are proud of our program. St. Mary's is rich in music from a variety of genres that span several centuries. In addition to music at Sunday worship and Evensong, St. Mary's also hosts individual concerts throughout the year.\n\n​\n\n​"
