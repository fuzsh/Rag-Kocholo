We work with our students and families to help them make the right financial decisions for them.\n\nAll undergraduates take the St. Mary’s Core Curriculum, which broadens students’ knowledge and transforms their understanding of their place in the world and their social responsibilities. These courses also develop crucial skills employers seek, such as critical thinking and problem-solving.\n\nBrothers of the Society of Mary (Marianists) brought Catholic education to San Antonio in 1852. St. Mary’s University committed itself to the Marianist ideals of academic excellence, ethical commitment and service to the community."
