        "text": "pre-nuptial preparation\n\nMarriage preparation\n\nMarriage preparation at St. Mary's is in accordance with canon law and diocesan policy. While this preparation varies, it normally includes:\n\n1. The completion of church documentation and canonical forms\n\n2. Attendance at diocesan programs\n\n3. Parish mentoring\n\n4. The planning of the ceremony\n\nDocuments Needed by Parish\n\nThe following documents should be mailed (no later than one month prior to wedding date) to:\n\nSt. Mary's Church\n\nAttn: Parish Secretary\n\n1505 White Pine Canyon Rd\n\nPark City, UT 84060\n\nThese include:\n\nA copy of baptismal certificates are required of all Catholic and baptized non-Catholics. Catholics require an original certificate issued by the church of baptism dated within six months of the wedding date.\n\nAn affidavit of Marriage Freedom (to be obtained from the person conducting pre-nuptial preparation) is required of both parties.\n\nCivil Document\n\nA civil marriage license must be obtained within 30 days of the marriage date from the County Clerk of any county in Utah. Offices are open from 8:00 - 4:00 Monday through Friday. Fee is $40.00. Blood testing is no longer required. Out-of-state licenses are not valid in Utah. Civil marriage licenses may be obtained from the following offices:\n\nSalt Lake County - 2001 South State St. South Bldg. 2nd floor\n\nSummit County - 60 North Main, Coalville\n\nWasatch County - 25 North Main, Heber\n\nDiocesan Programs The Diocese of Salt Lake City offers two programs for those preparing for marriage: Catholic Engaged Encounter and Seminar on Natural Family Planning. The latter is required of all couples being married in a Catholic ceremony. For information contact: Office of Family Life Pastoral Center, 27 C St. Salt Lake City, UT 84111, (801) 328-8641\n\nParish Mentoring\n\nMost parishes offer additional sessions either with the pastor or his delegates to focus on the marriage commitment. These may include a mentor couple, the use of prenuptial questionnaires, or professional counseling services.\n\nPlanning your ceremony at St. Mary's\n\nWeddings of Catholics will be celebrated according to the rites of the Roman Catholic Church. Any additions to the rite will be evaluated by the officiating priest/deacon as to suitability and in light of cultural backgrounds of the couple.\n\nThe wedding coordinator will assist you in planning your ceremony. The readings, prayers, vows, music, flowers and decorations, and photography require careful forethought and planning. The following is meant to guide you in your planning:\n\nReadings\n\nThe Word of God always takes precedence in all ceremonies with the Gospels in the place of honor. Secular readings, poetry or personal prayers should be used sparingly and never in place of the Scriptures. A selection of readings from the scriptures appropriate for wedding ceremonies will be made available to you by the person doing your wedding preparation.\n\nPrayers\n\nA variety of prayers are used in both the Nuptial Mass and Nuptial Ceremony. Please select from the options available.\n\nVows\n\nTwo formats for consent (vows) have been approved by the Church. Either may be used. These vows should be memorized by the couple prior to the rehearsal in preparation for their wedding. You will also want to memorize the brief text used at the exchange of rings.\n\nMusic\n\nThe principles guiding music for weddings are the same as those which form the basis for music in all liturgies. Your parish wedding coordinator will assist you in the selection of attractive and appropriate compositions. The following criteria should be kept in mind:\n\n1. The liturgical judgment - Is the selection appropriate to its place in the ceremony or the Mass?\n\n2. The pastoral judgment - At this religious service, will the piece of music help people to pray and express their spirit of joyous worship? In general, the music of Broadway shows, concert hall recitals, love songs or secular ballads are best left to the wedding reception where another dimension of the celebration of marriage prevails.\n\nWedding Celebrant\n\nOne of our parish priests or deacons will be assigned to celebrate your wedding. However, if you would like to bring your own priest or deacon, you are most welcome to do so. If they are from outside of the Diocese of Salt Lake City, they will have to submit a testimonial of suitability with the marriage paperwork.\n\nMinistries for your Wedding\n\nOrganists and other musicians: Your wedding coordinator can recommend potential organists or other musicians including soloists or singing groups. The Old Town Chapel has a Rodgers C220 keyboard. The organ in the new church is a single manual tracker pipe organ. Pianos are in both churches. It is strongly recommended that musicians unfamiliar with the instruments in St. Mary's churches and the acoustics of the buildings reserve in advance a time to practice prior to your wedding.\n\nThe number of people involved in your wedding liturgy can vary. The essential participants required are the bride and groom, a priest or deacon, and two witnesses. In addition to these, you will likely want to have one or more of the following:\n\nLectors\n\nThese readers of the Word should be chosen well in advance and may be family members, friends or members of the wedding party. One or more lectors should be chosen to read the Old Testament reading, the Responsorial psalm (unless sung), the New Testament reading and the Universal Prayer/Prayers of the Faithful. Lectors should plan to attend the rehearsal. The readings will be provided at the rehearsal and the wedding.\n\nAltar Servers\n\nThe use of altar servers is optional. One or more altar servers may be present to serve the ceremony or the nuptial mass. You may select relatives or friends to fill this role if they are experienced.\n\nEucharistic Ministers\n\nFor a Nuptial Mass two Eucharistic ministers are needed for the distribution of the cup. These must be practicing Catholics in good standing, preferably with experience in this ministry in their local parish. The bride and groom may also be Eucharistic ministers. These ministers are delegated by the priest celebrating the Nuptial Mass for this specific occasion.\n\nWedding Party\n\nTwo witnesses (usually your best man and maid/matron of honor) are required to be present. You may also include others such as groomsmen and bridesmaids. If you choose to include others, due to the space at the foot of the altar, no more than a total of eight per side is requested. Sometimes Ushers are used to help seat your guests when they arrive at the church. Groomsmen may also act in this role.\n\nRing Bearers and Flower Girls\n\nBoth ring bearers and flower girls, though optional, can be used in the wedding ceremony. Their roles are ceremonial. It is wise not to use children under four years of age for these roles. Flower petals may not be dropped during the procession. It is also ill advised to have the ring bearer carry the actual rings to be used during the ceremony.\n\ndecorations, etiquette & more\n\nAltar\n\nThe altar is sacred. No candles, flowers or anything else should ever be placed on it.\n\nLiturgical Seasons\n\nDecorations regularly adorn the church, the sanctuary, reredos and Gathering Space. These decorations are never to be moved or rearranged to accommodate a wedding. Furniture, chairs, and floral displays are not to be moved. Plan your wedding colors to complement those already present in the church. As a general guide to monthly theme colors:\n\nEarly January - Christmas Red and White\n\nMid January & Early February - Ordinary Time Green\n\n*Mid to Late February - Lent Purple\n\n*March - Lent purple\n\nApril - May - Easter White, Spring Colors\n\nJune-September Ordinary Time green\n\nOctober - November Ordinary Time harvest themes\n\n*Note: the above are meant as a guide. The dates for most seasons and feasts of the church\n\ncalendar vary. If this is important to you, be sure to check your wedding date's placement in the liturgical year.\n\n*The Season of Lent is a penitential season. Weddings are discouraged. When weddings occur they should be done simply. Flowers and decorations are to be minimized.\n\nFlowers\n\nWhile there is no limit regarding the number of floral bouquets or arrangements for a wedding, in both churches, less is more effective than more. Flowers and/or ribbons may be attached to the pews if they can be easily removable without damaging the pew finish. However, no wedding flowers are permitted on the wooden dais and reredos.\n\nNO TAPE AND NO NAILS MAY EVER BE USED ON ANY SURFACES. If you are having decorations attached to the pews or elsewhere, please be sure to have a designated person who will be responsible for removing them immediately following the wedding. No flower arrangements are permitted on the wooden sanctuary platform in the new church. They may be placed on the floor at pew level. Stands are to be provided by the florist. Please insure that your designated person assumes responsibility for their prompt removal and return. St. Mary's is not responsible for returning items supplied by florists. Your wedding coordinator has been instructed to remove any flowers or decorations deemed to be in violation of these guidelines.\n\nSuggestions for flowers in the new church\n\nFlowers may be placed on the concrete floor. Because of the extreme height of the church arrangements less than 10' high with stand are of no effect. Flowers will already be present on the reredos of the new church. Small bouquets work well on the table for altar gifts at the front of the aisle, at the shrine of the Blessed Virgin. Large arrangements can be placed on stands at the entry doors, both to the church proper and the gathering space. Suggestions for flowers in the Old Town Chapel: Free standing arrangements are permitted in the sanctuary. Since the ambo is brought into the church for the wedding, allow space for it. Smaller arrangements work well in the entry way. Bouquets can be placed in the window sills. Flowers and/or ribbons on the pews are not recommended due to the narrowness of the aisle. No fresh or artificial flower petals or leaves are to be spread inside or outside the new church or Old Town Chapel. They are not only messy and can stain the floor but are dangerous and increase risk of falling.\n\nThe Unity Candle\n\nThe unity candle is not part of the Catholic celebration of matrimony. We ask that if you desire a unity candle, it be used at the rehearsal dinner or reception instead.\n\nBalloons\n\nThe use of balloons or other helium-filled devices is prohibited.\n\nRunners\n\nRunners are unnecessary and dangerous, especially in the new church. No runners are permitted in either church.\n\nGlitter\n\nGlitter in any form is not allowed, not as decoration, in makeup or as decoration on clothing.\n\nPhotographers\n\nYour wedding photos are important and precious. Time should be given to planning them carefully with your photographer prior to your wedding day. A poorly informed photographer can ruin your wedding. Inform your photographer of the 2 1/2 hour time constraint on your use of the church. Flash photography is permitted during the procession into the church at the bride's discretion. Only non-flash photographs may be taken during the wedding ceremony. The photographer must be discreet and not distract from the ceremony. The photographer should be well versed about Catholic sacred space and the reverence expected in our churches. In particular, the Blessed Sacrament chapel behind the reredos is not to be entered for photo purposes. A list of suggested photographers is available from your wedding coordinator. You are not limited to this list. However, photographers not on the list are asked to meet with the wedding coordinator prior to the wedding to clarify our expectations. Video cameras may also be used, but must be placed unobtrusively in a stationary position. No cameras or microphones are ever permitted on the sanctuary platform. Photos may be taken in the church and on the church grounds before or after the ceremony. Please inform your photographer and wedding party that the church is not a studio but a house of worship demanding due proper reverence and respect. A photographer’s formal portrait session can be quite time consuming. Since only 2 1/2 hours are allocated for each wedding, and to prevent conflict with events scheduled after your wedding, consider taking your formal portraits before the ceremony. Your photographer will appreciate it, and it will also help you begin your ceremony on time and arrive at your reception in a timely fashion. Please remember to observe proper reverence whenever you are in the church.\n\nDressing for the ceremony\n\nThe bride and her party may dress and prepare for the wedding at the church. The groom and his party should arrive at the church dressed and prepared.\n\nOld Town Chapel: the bride and her party may dress in the Chapel Hall attached to the church.\n\nSt. Mary's Church: the bride and her party may dress in the parish meeting room adjacent to the gathering space.\n\nChurch Etiquette\n\nCourtesy and respect should characterize your wedding day. The church in particular is to be honored as a place of quiet reverence. It is a place of prayer. Conduct conducive to prayer is expected. The following is a brief list of things to keep in mind:\n\n1. Please designate a friend or member of your family to oversee cleanup of the church and bridal areas after the ceremony. This includes removal of personal belongings of the wedding party; attachments to pews, cleanup of the bridal preparation area and returning all spaces to their original setup. This important person is also asked to return all areas to the cleanliness and the orderliness in which you found them by removing all boxes and hangers, make-up kits and spray bottles.\n\n2. In the Catholic Church it is proper that your guests be invited to the Nuptial Mass or the Wedding Ceremony. The physical addresses are provided below.\n\nOld Town Chapel\n\nSt. Mary of the Assumption Church\n\n121 Park Avenue\n\nPark City, UT\n\nApproximate seating 125\n\nSt. Mary of the Assumption Church\n\n1505 W. White Pine Canyon Road\n\nPark City, UT\n\nApproximate seating 600\n\n3. No rice or bird seed is to be thrown inside or outside the church. They are not only messy, but dangerous. Approved wild flower mixes used as a sign of life may be thrown outside the new church, or a tree may be planted as a perpetual memorial of your marriage.\n\n4. Rehearsal Information: The church is the House of God and the same quiet reverence that is normally displayed will be expected at the rehearsal and before the ceremony begins. Please dress appropriately. Extremely casual attire is both disrespectful and distracting. Please meet your wedding coordinator in the Chapel Hall (Old Town Chapel) or gathering space (St. Mary's Church) to begin the rehearsal. After all have gathered and been welcomed a brief introduction to the ceremony will be given and then you will proceed to enter the church. Bring your Marriage License so that it may be completed during the rehearsal.\n\n5. Other events are often scheduled in our churches on the day of the wedding. Therefore to avoid being rushed and to make the greatest use of the limited time in which you have reserved the church, please have all the members of the wedding party be prompt for both the rehearsal and the wedding.\n\n6. The presence of alcoholic beverages during the rehearsal and prior to the wedding is inappropriate. Food or beverages of any kind are never to be brought into the church.\n\nNote: Since alcohol may impair a person’s freedom and consent it may also adversely affect the validity of marriage. Accordingly, should a wedding coordinator notify the minister of the ceremony of the presence of alcohol among the members of the wedding party, the minister at his discretion may cancel the wedding immediately.\n\n*For all wedding info, contact Sandy Foley at (435) 940-5455 or via email below*\n\nEmail Parish Administrator"
