        "text": "Houston | The Houston Rockets' 21st consecutive victory gave them the second-longest winning streak in NBA history and a share of first place in the Western Conference.\n\nTracy McGrady scored 30 points as the Rockets beat the Charlotte Bobcats 89-80 on Friday night to break a tie with the 1970-71 Milwaukee Bucks for the second-best streak in league history. Only the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers, who won 33 in a row, had a longer streak.\n\nThe win also sets up Sunday's showdown with the current Lakers at the Toyota\n\nCenter. They're both 45-20.\n\nAs the final seconds ticked off, Dikembe Mutombo waved his arms, urging the capacity crowd to stand and cheer. McGrady simply stood at the free throw line near the Rockets bench, a tired grin on his face.\n\nWhen the buzzer sounded, red streamers rained down as the crowd started chanting \"M-V-P!\" for McGrady.\n\nJason Richardson scored 28 points and Emeka Okafor added 23 for the Bobcats, who've lost five in a row to Houston.\n\nRafer Alston added 17 and Shane Battier had 12 points and nine rebounds for Houston, now 9-0 since Yao Ming's season-ending foot injury."
