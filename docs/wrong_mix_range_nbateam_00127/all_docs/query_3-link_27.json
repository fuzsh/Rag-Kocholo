        "text": "Retired NBA player Shane Battier likely would have never won a championship had he not joined the Miami Heat for the 2011-12 season.\n\nThat's when he teamed with the LeBron James-led Heat that also featured Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. They won two championships in Battier's three seasons.\n\nHe spoke of James' impact during a recent appearance on the Draymond Green podcast.\n\n\"The force, the intelligence,\" Battier said of James. \"He didn't have a weakness when he was in his prime. He's still playing amazing now. There was no answer for him.\"\n\nBattier called James one of the best players he's ever played with. James won two regular season MVPs and two Finals MVPs during his Heat tenure.\n\n\"He was like a queen on the chessboard,\" Battier said. \"He could do everything ... I'll always stand for LeBron, that's my guy.\"\n\nBattier even offered his thoughts on the greatest player of all-time in league history. He chose James based on his ability to win titles with Battier at power forward.\n\n\"I love Mike, one of the greatest of all-time but LeBron did it twice with me as his bum ass power forward and dragged me across the finish line,\" Battier said. \"That speaks to how great LeBron is.\"\n\nShandel Richardson covers the Miami Heat for Inside The Heat, a Fan Nation channel for Sports Illustrated.
