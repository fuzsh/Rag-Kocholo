        "text": "BOSTON - The Boston Celtics have traded starting center Kendrick Perkins to the Oklahoma City Thunder and acquired forward Jeff Green.\n\nThe Celtics also dealt reserve Nate Robinson to the Thunder and received Nenad Krstic, a future first-round draft pick, and cash in the deal that was approved by the NBA about five hours after Thursday's trade deadline.\n\nPerkins recently returned from a knee injury he sustained in Game 6 of the NBA finals. Once loaded with interior size, the Celtics will now have to hope Shaquille O'Neal or Jermaine O'Neal get healthy in time for the playoffs.\n\nRockets trade Brooks to Suns, Battier to Memphis\n\nHOUSTON - The Rockets sent point guard Aaron Brooks to Phoenix and forward Shane Battier to Memphis in separate deals Thursday that bring guard Goran Dragic and center Hasheem Thabeet to Houston.\n\nThe Rockets also get first-round draft picks from both teams and shipped rookie guard Ish Smith to the Grizzlies. Rockets general manager Daryl Morey confirmed the deals and Grizzlies owner Michael Heisley told The Associated Press that they swapped potential for a chance to reach the playoffs this year.\n\nCavs get Baron Davis, high pick from Clippers\n\nINDEPENDENCE, Ohio - The Cleveland Cavaliers, looking to quicken their rebuilding after a stunning drop in the standings, have acquired point guard Baron Davis and a 2011 first-round draft pick from the Los Angeles Clippers for guard Mo Williams and forward Jamario Moon.\n\nAt 10-47, the Cavs have the league's worst record in their first season without two-time league MVP LeBron James. General manager Chris Grant announced the deal Thursday three hours before the NBA's trade deadline.\n\nThe Cavs currently have two first-round and two second-round picks in June's draft.\n\nIn Cleveland, Davis will be reunited with Cavs coach Byron Scott. The two clashed during their time together in New Orleans.\n\nJordan's Bobcats send Wallace to Blazers\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. - The Charlotte Bobcats traded forward Gerald Wallace to the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday for a package that includes two first-round picks as owner Michael Jordan cuts payroll and eyes the future.\n\nThe Bobcats got center Joel Przybilla and reserve forward Dante Cunningham and center Sean Marks, who are in the last year of their contracts. They also got a conditional 2011 first-round pick that Portland acquired from New Orleans, and a conditional 2013 first-rounder from the Trail Blazers.\n\nRose, Deng lead Bulls over Heat 93-89\n\nCHICAGO - Derrick Rose scored 26 points and Luol Deng added 20, including the tiebreaking 3, and the Chicago Bulls beat the Miami Heat 93-89 on Thursday night in a wild showdown between two of the Eastern Conference's top teams.\n\nIn a game that could have playoff seeding implications, the Bulls used a big third quarter to turn a nine-point halftime lead into a 71-67 advantage, then watched a nine-point lead in the fourth evaporate into a four-point deficit before pulling it out."
