        "text": "MIAMI – The Miami Heat added veteran depth to their backcourt Wednesday with the signing of free-agent guard Shannon Brown.\n\nBrown, who turns 29 on Nov. 29, recently was released by the New York Knicks. He played at Michigan State from 2003-06.\n\nThe Heat will be the fourth team for the 6-foot-4 guard in the past three seasons, having played over that span for the Phoenix Suns, San Antonio Spurs and Knicks. He previously played for the Cleveland Cavaliers, Chicago Bulls, Charlotte Bobcats and Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nBrown signed for the $1.3 million veteran minimum, the only remaining salary space the Heat have available for free agents. He joins a backcourt that also features Dwyane Wade, Mario Chalmers, Norris Cole, journeyman free-agent acquisition Reggie Williams, and rookies Shabazz Napier and Tyler Johnson. The Heat have veteran Danny Granger and rookie James Ennis available as wings, as well.\n\nIn addition, the Heat have been linked to free-agent guard Leandro Barbosa, whose 2014-15 status is expected to be addressed after he plays for Brazil in the upcoming World Cup in Spain.\n\nThe Heat also have been linked to free-agent guards Jordan Crawford, Chris Douglas-Roberts and Toure Murry, who recently signed with the Utah Jazz.\n\nThe Heat have overhauled their wing rotation since making a fourth consecutive NBA Finals appearance in June. James Jones has signed with the Cavaliers, Ray Allen also has been linked to the Cavaliers in free agency, Shane Battier has retired, and Toney Douglas signed to play in China after not receiving offseason interest from the Heat.\n\nKnown for his athleticism earlier in his career, Brown participated in the dunk contest during the 2010 All-Star Weekend. His defense figures to provide the Heat an upgrade over what Allen offered last season, although he is not nearly as polished a shooter or scorer.\n\nBrown is married to R&B singer Monica and has appeared in music videos with Toni Braxton, Nelly and Monica. He also appeared in the 2012 movie “Think Like a Man” that featured Wade’s fiance Gabrielle Union.\n\nBrown gives the Heat 16 players under contract for the Sept. 30 start of training camp, with undrafted Middle Tennessee State forward Shawn Jones also expected to be added. Teams can carry a maximum of 20 players in the offseason, a maximum of 15 during the regular season, which for the Heat opens Oct. 29 at AmericanAirlines Arena against the Washington Wizards."
