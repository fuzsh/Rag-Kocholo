        "text": "All season, Erik Spoelstra has spoken of sacrifice.\n\nThis time, though, the sacrifice wasn’t money or minutes or shots. It was sleep. The Heat’s decision to stay in Toronto to watch the Super Bowl at a local upscale sports bar, while the players’ clear preference, would come at that cost, with the weary travelers not straggling to their homes until nearly 4 a.m.\n\nOne of those players, LeBron James, had an early wakeup waiting, in order to take his sons to school.\n\nSo did he rest?\n\n“While they were at school, absolutely,” James said. “I had to take advantage of that time while they were gone.”\n\nHe did, because at night, he would have another responsibility:\n\nPutting the Bobcats to bed.\n\nThey wouldn’t go so quietly in this 99-94 Heat victory, not even after coming into Monday’s contest with a wee five road wins.\n\nIn fact, on a night in which the Heat sometimes appeared to play with little purpose, James needed to provide near-perfection. Never before in his career had he shot like this, converting 13 of 14 attempts for 31 points, with all but one of those shots coming with both feet inside the paint.\n\n“At some point, you just realize, ‘Boy, he’s getting to the rim a lot,’ ” Spoelstra said. “He did it off the dribble, off of attacking, and he had a little bit more size when he got in there.”\n\nJames, who said he felt “sleepy” when entering the building but not tired once on the court, didn’t intend to exploit the smallish Bobcats that way. It just happened. He made his first eight attempts prior to a steal in the third quarter, which he tried to finish with a 4-footer.\n\n“I got fouled on it,” James said, smiling. “But it never stopped me before.”\n\nEven while confronted with James’ excellence, the Bobcats didn’t stop coming, due largely to a strong effort from their bench, featuring Ramon Sessions, Byron Mullens and Ben Gordon.\n\nCharlotte was within 89-87 with 1:38 left. That’s when Ray Allen missed a 3-pointer, part of Miami’s 1-of-12 struggle from behind the arc. Dwyane Wade, who compensated for poor shooting with interior activity (12 rebounds), stripped a rebound from Mullens. The ball found its way to James, who found Chris Bosh (23 points) soaring through the lane for a slam.\n\nWhen Kemba Walker couldn’t connect from deep, and James drove for another layup, Miami was able to escape embarrassment. More importantly, the Heat were able to focus on the game’s most remarkable and memorable event, one for which James was merely a spectator.\n\nShane Battier’s two-handed dunk.\n\n“We’ve been waiting for one of those,” James said. “He’s been doing them in warm-ups too, like trying to get his legs ready. D-Wade gave him the best pass he could have gotten, where all he had to do was do the 1-2 and get up there. That was big time. I loved it. That was awesome.”\n\nBattier, who also credited Wade, certainly thought so.\n\n“If he had thrown the ball to me a second earlier, I would have had to dribble, and I would have dribbled it out. But he led me perfectly, I got my steps down and I made history.”\n\nIt was his first dunk of this decade, the first his son — watching from home — had ever seen.\n\n“That one was for all the old guys,” Battier said. “That one was for all the suburban dads out there, who have been told they are over the hill, and they are a step slow, not as good as they once were. I may release a DVD of that. It’s like Halley’s Comet, you may never see it again in your lifetime.”\n\nAs opposed to near-perfection from James, which seems to occur almost every night, no matter how badly he could use a good night’s sleep."
