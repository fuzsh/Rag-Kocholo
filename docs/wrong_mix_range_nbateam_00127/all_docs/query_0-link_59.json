        "text": "The 2011-2012 season has hit the third quarter mark. With playoff chases looming and tanking plans already underway, CBSSports.com's Eye On Basketball staff sat down to grade each team based on realizing their potential and expectations, graded on a curve. Here's what we came up with.\n\nThe Heat haven't been perfect this year. (Getty Images)\n\nSOUTHEAST DIVISION\n\nby Royce Young\n\nMiami Heat\n\nOther than not starting the season 9-8, it seems this Miami campaign is similar to the inaugural one. Defensive dominance, easy wins over average and below teams and some curious struggles against top flight opponents. But they do seem better. Despite a recent swoon, LeBron James is having probably the best season of his career, Chris Bosh fits better within the offense and Dwyane Wade is, well, an awesome basketball player. There's a bit more depth with Shane Battier, rookie Norris Cole and new signee Ronny Turiaf and they've had a healthy Udonis Haslem all season. All of that is nice, but it's about one question: Is this group good enough to win a championship? To be determined.\n\nGRADE: A-\n\nOrlando Magic\n\nSomehow, the Magic hung on to Dwight Howard for the rest of the season opening the opportunity for this rag tag bunch to make another run. And they've played surprisingly well all season, rising to third in the East and giving at least a drop of hope that they're good enough to challenge in the Eastern playoff picture. They aren't, but there's at least that thought. Which is saying something, considering where feelings were with the Magic two months ago.\n\nGRADE: B+\n\nAtlanta Hawks\n\nInjuries have ripped up the Hawks, but they're quietly still pushing forward. They're in that same old place though. Good enough to make the playoffs, but not anywhere close to good enough to actually do something big when they get there. They can probably win a series, but they aren't going past that. They're stuck. They're locked into a core that doesn't seem to be capable of pushing past the second round. Still, there's something to be said for overcoming injuries, which is what they're doing without Al Horford.\n\nGRADE: B-\n\nWashington Wizards\n\nThe good news? They finally washed their hands of JaVale McGee and Nick Young. The bad news? They still have Andray Blatche and they're still the Wizards. The development of John Wall has been stunted due to a toxic roster that hasn't encouraged any kind of growth. The expectation has been unfair with Wall in that he's supposed to just magically elevate a terrible group to another level. I'm not even sure LeBron could do that with this roster. They're trying something new with Nene and there's a good amount of cap space to use. So maybe it's going to start turning around. Then again, it's the Wizards.\n\nGRADE: D-\n\nCharlotte Bobcats\n\nBeing terrible is the first step in eventually being good. And the Bobcats are doing an outstanding job of being terrible. They're already almost assured of having the most ping-pong balls in the Anthony Davis lottery, which is exactly what they want. A core of Davis, Kemba Walker and Bismack Biyombo is something worth building around. There are pains in rebuilding and the Bobcats are suffering through them. But it's part of the process. They're doing a great job at what they're supposed to be doing: losing.\n\nGRADE: C-\n\nCENTRAL DIVISION\n\nby Matt Moore\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nThey went 14-3 during this quarter and have been simply phenomenal. They bring it more consistently than any team in the league and even without Derrick Rose for many of their games this quarter, they've still produced at both ends. Tom Thibodeau deserves Coach of the Year for his performance.\n\nGRADE: A+\n\nIndiana Pacers\n\nThe Pacers had some signature wins and some disastrous losses. They're just about where they've been. No one thinks they're Finals contenders, but they're a good team that could make a little run if things go right for them. A good season for Frank Vogel in his first without the interim tag.\n\nGRADE: B-\n\nMilwaukee Bucks:\n\nTraded for Monta Ellis to boost their offense and it's working out. They're winning at a decent clip and getting more contributions from Drew Gooden (who has quietly had a great year) and Ersan Ilyasova. They have defense, their offense has been the sixth best this quarter and they made their team better long-term. Things are looking up in Milwaukee.\n\nGRADE: B+\n\nCleveland Cavaliers\n\nThey haven't played well, going 4-13, but they made moves for their future, are getting their guys playing time who need it, and are tanking to improve their draft position. The Cavaliers know they have a good team going forward. It's all about the future now.\n\nGRADE: B\n\nDetroit Pistons: This team really should be better than it is. They are .500 over their last 20 games, but just have no consistency night to night. Some nights they're a scrappy squad with a great star in Greg Monroe and some dangerous supporting players. Other nights they're a doormat. There's reason to believe the future has better days ahead but Joe Dumars has to stop giving out massive contracts to veterans for that to happen.\n\nGRADE: D\n\nATLANTIC DIVISION\n\nby Ben Golliver\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n\nIt's difficult to love how the 76ers have played recently, going 8-9 since the midway point after a rip roaring hot start. The defense remains sensational but the late-game struggles are a major concern. Seeding will be huge for the Sixers, who don't stand a chance of toppling one of the conference's top seeds over a 7-game series. Turnaround time is now.\n\nGRADE: C\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nDespite weathering roughly 156,938 injuries, the Celtics reeled off a 13-6 third quarter to get themselves in position to win the Division. It's too bad, too, because this team was so much fun to write off. The offensive efficiency has been anemic, but none of the East's upstart teams wants any part of a 4 vs. 5 series with Boston.\n\nGRADE: A-\n\nNew YorkKnicks\n\nI thought the shortened season was supposed to make for less ups and downs? Not so in New York, where Linsanity gave way to the D'Antoni Divorce and now there's a new headline every day as to whether Carmelo Anthony can make this thing work. Throughout it all, New York went a solid 10-8 in the third quarter, thanks in large part to the post-D'Antoni winning streak. Things could be worse; things could be better.\n\nGRADE: B\n\nToronto Raptors Not that it matters, but the Raptors had a (relatively) great third quarter, going 8-11 and nearly matching their win total for the first half of the season. This is still seventh circle of Draft Lottery hell though. Forgive Toronto fans for cheering for late-game pizza during a loss and for looking forward to next season, when Jonas Valanciunas and another top lottery talent will be in the fold. Hit fast forward on the fourth quarter; it's ping pong ball time.\n\nGRADE: C\n\nNew JerseyNets\n\nThe Nets are still awful, going 7-11 in the third quarter, now in 13th place in the conference league-wide. The Gerald Wallace trade was a puzzler as his uncertain future was a major risk to take on in exchange for what was sure to be a quality lottery pick. Deron Williams still feels gone, as the last year since his acquisition has played out like a worst case scenario. At least the move to Brooklyn is that much closer. That's the only silver lining here.\n\nGRADE: D\n\nLakers are picking up steam. (Getty Images)"
