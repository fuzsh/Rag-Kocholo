        "text": "The Portland Trail Blazers and Houston Rockets discussed a trade that would send Aaron Brooks and Shane Battier to Portland for Marcus Camby with the trade deadline looming. According to a report from Marc Stein, the two teams were involved in trade talks, though it appears the deal is unlikely to happen. Brooks has seen his name show up in more than one trade rumor ahead of the deadline as the guard from Seattle was also linked to the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nThe Blazers have been busy this week, exploring trade options with both the Rockets and Charlotte Bobcats ahead of Thursday’s noon trade deadline. The deal with the Bobcats, which would have brought Gerald Wallace to Portland, stalled on Thursday after the Bobcats asked for Nicolas Batum. Andre Miller and Joel Przybilla were also involved in the Charlotte-Portland trade talks.\n\nWe’re half an hour away from the trade deadline and teams are exploring last-minute deals. Trade talks and rumors are continuing to heat up as the deadline approaches, though it appears the Blazers have hit a dead end in every attempt to make a deal."
