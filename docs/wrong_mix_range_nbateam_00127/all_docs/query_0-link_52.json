        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Kareem Rush scored a career-high 35 points and rookie Raymond Felton added 18 points and 10 assists in his first career start to help the Charlotte Bobcats snap a five-game losing streak with a 122-90 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night.\n\nIt was both the most points scored and the largest margin of victory for the second-year Bobcats.\n\nEmeka Okafor added 20 points and 12 rebounds for the Bobcats, who shot 53 percent. Charlotte dominated despite being without leading scorer Gerald Wallace (wrist) and Brevin Knight, who was a late scratch with tendinitis in his left knee.\n\nRon Artest scored 27 points and Stephen Jackson added 18 for the Pacers, who committed 26 turnovers in their second straight loss.\n\nSuperSonics 113, Celtics 100\n\nBOSTON — Ray Allen scored 32 points to lift Seattle over the Celtics.\n\nLuke Ridnour added 15 points and 13 assists for Seattle, which snapped a six-game losing streak in Boston.\n\nThe Sonics, who were playing their sixth game in eight days, closed out a six-game road trip with their first regulation win of the season. Seattle's previous two victories were against Minnesota and Toronto in overtime.\n\nAfter a pair of free throws by Justin Reed cut the Sonics lead to 96-85 with 7:29 remaining, Allen hit a pair of jumpers to extend the lead back to 15. Allen finished 12-of-17 from the field.\n\nNick Collison scored 19 points and grabbed 13 rebounds and Rashard Lewis added 22 points for Seattle.\n\nPaul Pierce had 22 points and Ricky Davis added 21 points for the Celtics.\n\n76ers 121, Raptors 115\n\nTORONTO — Allen Iverson scored a season-high 42 points to lead Philadelphia to its sixth straight win, beating the winless Raptors.\n\nAndre Iguodala had a career-high 26 points and 10 rebounds for the Sixers, who also beat Toronto on Tuesday night.\n\nMike James had a career-high 38 points for the Raptors, who fell to 0-8 for the first time in their 11-year history. Jalen Rose was scoreless in seven minutes of play — his first scoreless game since Feb 20, 1998 for Indiana at Orlando.\n\nToronto coach Sam Mitchell showed his frustration in the second half by throwing his clipboard into the scorer's table — smashing it into pieces.\n\nNuggets 91, Hornets 81\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY — Carmelo Anthony scored a season-high 31 points and keyed a decisive 13-point run in the fourth quarter to help Denver beat the New Orleans Hornets.\n\nThe Hornets cut into a nine-point deficit with a 9-2 run to start the fourth quarter, but Anthony scored seven points as Denver pulled away with a 13-0 surge to go up 84-69.\n\nNew Orleans closed to 86-79 before Anthony put the game away with a two-handed jam with 1:10 left.\n\nMarcus Camby added 15 points and 15 rebounds and Andre Miller also scored 15 for the Nuggets, who won their first road game.\n\nChris Paul scored 18 points and David West added 16 for New Orleans, which lost its fourth straight game.\n\nGrizzlies 115, Suns 103\n\nPHOENIX — Damon Stoudamire scored 12 of his 26 points on 5-of-6 shooting in the fourth quarter and Memphis won its third in a row.\n\nMike Miller, questionable before the game because of a bruised right knee, added 24 for the Grizzlies, who were swept by Phoenix in the first round of last season's playoffs.\n\nMiller, injured in the fourth quarter of Memphis' victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday night, scored 16 in the first half and finished 9-for-14 shooting, mostly from outside.\n\nShane Battier added 18 points and 12 rebounds, and Bobby Jackson 16 points for Memphis.\n\nPhoenix fell to 1-4 at home, 1-3 on its five-game home stand.\n\nShawn Marion had 23 points and 11 rebounds and Steve Nash 17 points and 13 assists for Phoenix.\n\nLakers 97, Knicks 92\n\nLOS ANGELES — Phil Jackson still has it over Larry Brown.\n\nKobe Bryant scored a season-high 42 points and the Lakers defeated New York, snapping a three-game losing skid.\n\nChanning Frye led the Knicks with 21 points, the second time the rookie has done so in three nights. Eddy Curry added 17 points.\n\nStephon Marbury was held to a season-low four points — 12 below his average, and had 10 assists.\n\nThe latest meeting between two of the NBA's greatest coaches was hardly vintage. Both of their clubs are struggling to regain elite status, something that once was a given.\n\nJackson improved to 26-13 in head-to-head games against Brown, whose Philadelphia team lost to Jackson's Lakers in the 2001 NBA Finals. Brown's Detroit Pistons eliminated the Lakers in the 2004 Finals.\n\nTrail Blazers 96, Bulls 93\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. — Zach Randolph had 22 points and 10 rebounds and the Trail Blazers withstood a fourth-quarter challenge by Chicago.\n\nThe Blazers, who led by as many as nine points in the second half, got hit midway through the fourth quarter when starting point guard Sebastian Telfair rolled his right ankle while turning to pass to Theo Ratliff. Telfair had to be helped off the court.\n\nAs a team, Portland seemed stunned by the injury, and the Bulls pulled within 88-87 on Michael Sweetney's turnaround jumper. Chicago took over an 89-88 lead on Luol Deng's dunk.\n\nAfter a timeout, Telfair reappeared to loud cheers from the sparse weeknight crowd and the Blazers regained some of their energy.\n\nJuan Dixon finished with 16 points for Portland, which has won three of four at the Rose Garden.\n\nSweetney had 24 points and 14 rebounds to lead Chicago.\n\nBucks 90, Warriors 87\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. — Michael Redd scored 27 points to help Milwaukee end a 17-game road losing streak against the Western Conference with a victory over Golden State.\n\nBobby Simmons had 20 points and 11 rebounds for the Bucks, who also ended a three-game losing streak to Golden State and survived a late comeback attempt by the Warriors in the final seconds.\n\nJason Richardson, who led the Warriors with 21 points, missed a 3 with just under 10 seconds to go, but Simmons missed two free throws to give Golden State another chance with 6.3 seconds on the clock. Davis missed a desperation jumper with 3.9 left, but his foot was on the 3-point line and it wouldn't have tied the game had it gone in.\n\nGrizzlies 115, Suns 103\n\nPHOENIX — Damon Stoudamire scored 12 of his 26 points on 5-of-6 shooting in the fourth quarter and Memphis won its third in a row.\n\nMike Miller, questionable before the game because of a bruised right knee, added 24 for the Grizzlies, who were swept by Phoenix in the first round of last season's playoffs.\n\nMiller, injured in the fourth quarter of Memphis' victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday night, scored 16 in the first half and finished 9-for-14 shooting, mostly from outside.\n\nShane Battier added 18 points and 12 rebounds, and Bobby Jackson 16 points for Memphis.\n\nPhoenix fell to 1-4 at home, 1-3 on its five-game home stand.\n\nShawn Marion had 23 points and 11 rebounds and Steve Nash 17 points and 13 assists for Phoenix."
