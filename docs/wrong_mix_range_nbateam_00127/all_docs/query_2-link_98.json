        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — LeBron James had 27 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists, and the Miami Heat handed the Charlotte Bobcats their 16th straight loss, 105-92 on Wednesday night.\n\nDwyane Wade scored 29 points and had nine rebounds as Miami extended its winning streak to six.\n\nCharlotte cut the Miami lead to 84-82 when Gerald Henderson completed a three-point play with 7:16 left. But James knocked down a 3-pointer, Wade hit a pair of jumpers, and Shane Battier added a 3-pointer from the right corner to complete an 11-3 run that pushed the lead to 10.\n\nKemba Walker had 27 points, and Ramon Sessions added 19 points for the Bobcats (7-21), who haven't won since Nov. 24.\n\nHornets 97, Magic 94\n\nORLANDO, Fla. — Robin Lopez had a season-high 29 points, and Greivis Vasquez scored a season-best 27 as New Orleans snapped an 11-game losing streak with a victory over Orlando.\n\nOrlando had a chance to tie the game in the closing seconds, but came up empty on a 3-point attempt by Nikola Vucevic.\n\nIt was the Hornets' first win since Dec. 3 and their fourth straight regular-season victory over the Magic.\n\nJameer Nelson had 28 points and 10 rebounds for Orlando, and Vucevic added 19 points. The Magic dropped their third consecutive game, all since starting forward Glen Davis injured his shoulder.\n\nNuggets 126, Lakers 114\n\nDENVER — Corey Brewer matched his career high with 27 points, and Denver overcame a 40-point effort by Kobe Bryant to beat the Los Angeles Lakers for its seventh straight win at home.\n\nBrewer made four of his six 3-pointers in the final 12-plus minutes, helping the Nuggets hold off the Lakers, whose five-game winning streak was snapped.\n\nBryant, who scored at least 40 points for the 116th time in his career, has netted at least 30 in 10 straight games.\n\nKenneth Faried had 21 points and 15 rebounds, and Danilo Gallinari added 19 points for Denver. Ty Lawson had 17 points to go with 14 assists. Andre Iguodala also scored 17 points.\n\nKnicks 99, Suns 97\n\nPHOENIX — J.R. Smith sank a baseline 21-footer at the buzzer after a Phoenix turnover with a second to play, giving depleted New York a victory over the Suns.\n\nSmith's tough jumper from 15 feet had tied it at 97 with 10.6 seconds left. Then, after the turnover, Jason Kidd inbounded to Smith, who got the shot off as he sailed toward the out of bounds line. Smith scored 27 and Kidd 23.\n\nJared Dudley had a career-high 36 for Phoenix, including two free throws that put the Suns ahead 97-95 with 34.5 seconds to go.\n\nNew York was without the NBA's No. 2 scorer Carmelo Anthony (hyperextended knee) and Raymond Felton (finger), both hurt in the Christmas day loss to the Lakers in Los Angeles. The Knicks said X-rays on Felton's right fifth finger revealed a fracture.\n\nChris Copeland and Tyson Chandler added 14 points apiece for the Knicks.\n\nCavaliers 87, Wizards 84\n\nWASHINGTON — Tristan Thompson's three-point play with 24.4 seconds remaining gave Cleveland a victory over Washington and its first two-game winning streak of the season.\n\nKyrie Irving, who had 26 points to lead Cleveland, made one of two free throws with 9.5 seconds left after Jordan Crawford and Garrett Temple missed jumpers for the Wizards. Crawford made two free throws with 8.5 seconds left to cut the lead to 86-84. Irving hit one of two, and Crawford missed a 3-pointer as time ran out.\n\nIrving had 20 of his 26 points in the first half for the Cavaliers, who improved to 7-23. Two of their wins are against Washington, losers of eight straight.\n\nThompson had a season-high 15 points and 12 rebounds.\n\nCrawford and Emeka Okafor led the Wizards with 17 points. Nene had 16.\n\nHawks 126, Pistons 119, 2OT\n\nATLANTA — Josh Smith scored 31 points, Al Horford added 22, and Atlanta beat Detroit in double overtime.\n\nThe Hawks blew a 22-point, fourth-quarter lead as Detroit reserves Will Bynum and Charlie Villanueva scored a combined 26 points in the final period of regulation.\n\nAtlanta has won two straight and eight of 12. Detroit has lost seven of nine.\n\nBynum finished with 31 points, one less than his career high, and assisted on the last two baskets of regulation, when Andre Drummond's dunk cut the lead to two and Austin Daye's 3-pointer gave the Pistons a 101-100 lead with 4 seconds remaining.\n\nRockets 87, Timberwolves 84\n\nMINNEAPOLIS — James Harden scored 17 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter, and Houston rallied to win its fifth straight, topping Minnesota.\n\nHarden's drive to the basket gave Houston (16-12) an 85-84 lead with 39 seconds left. He drove again to make it a three-point lead with 11.7 seconds to go and scored 15 of the Rockets' final 17 points.\n\nOmer Asik added nine points and 17 rebounds for the Rockets, who edged the Wolves after beating their previous three opponents by at least 22 points.\n\nJ.J. Barea scored 18 for Minnesota (13-13), and Shved added 16. Kevin Love had 12 rebounds, but scored just seven points on 3 of 14 shooting. He missed all seven of his 3-point attempts.\n\nIt was Rockets coach Kevin McHale's first game back in his home state since his 23-year-old daughter, Sasha, died on Nov. 24 of complications from lupus.\n\n76ers 99, Grizzlies 89\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. — Dorell Wright scored 28 points, and Spencer Hawes had 20, season-highs for both, and Philadelphia snapped a six-game road losing streak with a victory over Memphis.\n\nWright was inserted into the lineup for Jason Richardson, who sat out with a low back strain. Wright was 8 of 11 from the field, part of the Sixers shooting 52 percent, including 9 of 16 outside the arc.\n\nThaddeus Young and Jrue Holiday had 13 points each for Philadelphia, Holiday adding nine assists. Nick Young finished with 12 points. Hawes had five of Philadelphia's season-high 12 blocked shots.\n\nZach Randolph led the Grizzlies with 23 points and nine rebounds, and Marc Gasol had 18 points and eight rebounds. Memphis, which lost its second straight, played without leading scorer Rudy Gay, who was out because of \"personal reasons.\"\n\nBucks 108, Nets 93\n\nMILWAUKEE — Brandon Jennings scored 25 points, Monta Ellis added 20 points and a season-high six steals, and Milwaukee beat short-handed Brooklyn for the 13th straight time.\n\nBrook Lopez had 21 points and 10 rebounds as the Nets missed a chance to get to .500 on the road (6-7) and lost their third straight.\n\nThe Nets were without starting guard Deron Williams, who used his wrist to brace himself as he fell to the court Tuesday in a home loss to Boston. C.J. Watson made his first start of the season and 60th of his career.\n\nTrailing 78-67 after three, the Nets made it a close game in the fourth quarter, getting to 84-80, but Milwaukee answered with 3-pointers from Ersan Ilyasova, Ellis, and Mike Dunleavy to push the lead to 11.\n\nThe Nets fell to 3-10 in December.\n\nEllis and Jennings outscored Joe Johnson and Watson 45-21.\n\nSpurs 100, Raptors 80\n\nSAN ANTONIO — Tim Duncan scored 15 points, and San Antonio rolled to a victory over Toronto that snapped the Raptors' five-game winning streak.\n\nManu Ginobili added 14 points, Tony Parker 13, and Tiago Splitter and Stephen Jackson each had 10 for San Antonio (22-8), which has won three straight. Kawhi Leonard had nine points and 10 rebounds.\n\nAlan Anderson and Amir Johnson both had 12 points for Toronto (9-20).\n\nDuncan had six rebounds and was 6 for 11 from the field in only 27 minutes as the Spurs' balanced attack wore down the Raptors. None of Toronto's starters scored in double figures as San Antonio's starters outscored its counterparts 54-25.\n\nWarriors 94, Jazz 83\n\nSALT LAKE CITY — Stephen Curry scored 23 points, David Lee added 18, and Golden State beat Utah.\n\nCurry set the tone by scoring the Warriors' first 11 points. He hit two 3-pointers and made three free throws after being fouled on another shot beyond the arc — all in less than a minute. Curry added eight rebounds, seven assists and a steal.\n\nJarrett Jack and Klay Thompson had 15 points each for the Warriors, who dominated on the fast break and hit 9 of 18 3-point attempts.\n\nAl Jefferson led Utah with 18 points and 10 rebounds, and Paul Millsap added 14 points.\n\nThe Warriors led by as many as 15 points in the first half, and took a 75-58 lead into the fourth quarter.\n\nTrail Blazers 109, Kings 91\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. — LaMarcus Aldridge had 28 points and 12 rebounds, and Portland beat Sacramento to avenge a loss on Sunday.\n\nNicolas Batum scored 18 points and J.J.

Rookie point guard Damian Lillard had 17 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds.\n\nJohn Salmons led the Kings with 19 points. Reserve Isaiah Thomas had 12 points, and Jason Thompson added 11.
