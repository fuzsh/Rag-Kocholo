        "text": "I often learn things from sports that are very applicable in business and Duke Basketball Coach Mike Kryzewski’s (Coach K) 1,000th victory provided one of those moments. In all the post-victory analysis, one theme kept resonating: Coach K treats every single player differently. He takes the time to understand the player and then uses that understanding to get the most out of them (and help them develop).\n\nThe Battier story\n\nShane Battier, whom I have written about before, told the story that most resonated with me. When Shane Battier was at Duke early in his career, Coach K kept probing to determine what was important to him, and it was not how many points he scored. When Coach K asked, “are you ready to lead this to team and be an All-American,” that motivated Battier. Battier went on to be an all-American that year (2001) and Duke won a national championship.\n\nThe lesson\n\nMany books on leadership and coaching extoll a strategy of what to say to employees to motivate them, but it is not optimal to pursue a one-size-fits-all strategy. A pep talk may work great for one employee while a cynical employee may get de-motivated. Motivating by financial incentives can work great with some people while others will then just do the minimum needed to get the financial incentives. A laid back approach works fantastic with certain employees while others will take advantage and spend all their time playing Trivia Crack.\n\nIf you want to be as successful as Coach K, you should spend time with every individual employee and get to understand them. Then work with them to build a plan that works for them and optimizes their contribution to the organization.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nDuke basketball coach Mike Kryzewski’s (Coach K’s) incredible success is largely due to treating every player differently.\n\nWhat motivates one person may not motivate somebody else.\n\nThe best way to lead is to understand each individual and build a plan for each that optimizes their contribution.\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIf you were fortunate enough to see the end of the NBA playoff game Wednesday between Miami and Indiana, you saw one of the greatest plays of all time. It is also one that exemplifies how you can help your company achieve greatness. You may have seen the highlight (Below is a link to the play), but with about two seconds left in overtime, the Miami Heat were down by one point. LeBron James got the ball, blew past the defender and scored a game-winning layup with no time left to give the Heat the win and a 1-0 lead in the series.\n\nWhat you probably did not realize is that although LeBron made a great play, it would never have happened without Shane Battier, the Miami Heat player who in-bounded the ball. Battier recognized the defense and put the ball in the perfect space for LeBron to get it mid-stride and be able to make the play now shown millions of times throughout the world. Without Battier, the Heat would be down 1-0 in the series with home court advantage belonging to Indiana and people questioning the Heat’s ability to repeat as NBA Champions.\n\nIt is not a coincidence that Battier was responsible for such an important play and that the in-bound pass was not made by another player.
