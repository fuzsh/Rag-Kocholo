        "text": "American basketball player (born 1979)\n\nFor other people with similar names, see Baron Davies (disambiguation).\n\nBaron Walter Louis Davis (born April 13, 1979) is an American former professional basketball player who is a studio analyst for the NBA on TNT. He was a two-time NBA All-Star, made the All-NBA Third Team in 2004, and twice led the NBA in steals. He was drafted with the third overall pick in the 1999 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets. He also played in the NBA for the New Orleans Hornets, Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers, Cleveland Cavaliers and New York Knicks. Davis played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins, earning All-American honors before turning professional after his sophomore year. He was a star high school player while at Crossroads School. Davis holds the NBA's career playoff record for steals per game with an average of 2.28 over 50 games.[1]\n\nDavis was born in Los Angeles and grew up in the South Central area.[2] His grandmother and guardian, Lela Nicholson, was instrumental in pushing him to play basketball. With her encouragement, he eventually enrolled at Crossroads School, a prestigious private school in Santa Monica.\n\nAs a senior at Crossroads, Davis led his team to the championship of The Beach Ball Classic tournament in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, over perennial prep powerhouse Simon Gratz High School (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), while earning MVP honors and a spot on the All-Tournament team along with future St. John's standout Erick Barkley at that prestigious event. That year, Davis was also named Gatorade National Player of the Year and a Parade All-American. He was also selected to play in the prestigious McDonald's All-American High School Basketball Game in Colorado Springs in 1997, playing with future NBA players Elton Brand, Shane Battier, Larry Hughes and Ron Artest.\n\nAfter a highly contested recruiting battle that saw Kansas, Georgia Tech, Duke, and UCLA in hot pursuit for his services, Davis selected UCLA as college choice, so that he could play in front of his family and friends. During this time, Davis was involved in a minor controversy pertaining to his driving a 1991 Chevy Blazer that was a gift from his sister, then a UCLA employee. The car was sold to her by Jim Harrick's son. At the time, Harrick was the UCLA men's basketball coach, presenting both a conflict of interest and a potential recruiting violation, since rumor had it that the car was purchased below market value. The controversy subsided when it was discovered that Davis's sister had, in fact, bought the car at fair market value.[3] Davis then enrolled at UCLA in 1997 without problem. In 1998, Davis was named the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year and made the third-team All-American his sophomore year in 1999.[4]\n\nIn Davis's two years at UCLA, he averaged 13.6 points and 5.1 assists for the Bruins. While coming down from a dunk during an NCAA Tournament game his freshman year, he injured his knee and tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Surprisingly, though, he made a full recovery the next season and seemed to have regained nearly all of the speed, quickness, and explosiveness he had before the injury while doing enough on the basketball court to warrant his declaring for the 1999 NBA draft after his sophomore campaign.[5]\n\nDavis was the third pick in the 1999 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets. In his NBA debut, a 100â€“86 win over the Orlando Magic, Davis scored nine points, and added five rebounds, two assists and two steals. In Davis's first year, he backed up Eddie Jones and David Wesley, as the Hornets lost in the first round of the playoffs to the 76ers in four games.\n\nDavis saw better success the following year, as his averages in points, assists, steals and minutes per game all increased and he started all 82 games for the Hornets. Davis lead the Hornets back into the playoffs, and swept the Miami Heat before being defeated by the Ray Allen-led Milwaukee Bucks in seven games in the second round. Davis is credited with making the longest shot in NBA history at the Bradley Center on February 17, 2001, when he made an 89-foot (27 m) shot with 0.7 seconds remaining in the third quarter against the Bucks.[6] During All-Star weekend, he also participated in the Slam Dunk Contest and the Rising Stars Challenge\n\nThe next season, Davis again started all 82 games while averaging 18 points and 8.5 assists per game. He was also selected as an injury replacement for Vince Carter in the 2002 NBA All-Star Game. The Hornets made the playoffs with Davis for the third time in as many years, but after defeating the Tracy McGrady-led Orlando Magic in the opening round, they were eliminated in the second round by the Jason Kidd-led New Jersey Nets.\n\nIn the summer of 2002, the Hornets relocated from Charlotte, North Carolina, to New Orleans. In the New Orleans Hornets' inaugural season, Davis suffered multiple injuries that limited him to just 50 games. He was still able to lead the Hornets back to the playoffs, but they would fall to the Allen Iverson-led Philadelphia 76ers in the first round. Iverson would later describe Davis as the most difficult defensive assignment of his career.[7]\n\nThe following season saw injuries limited Davis to 67 games. Despite this, he led the league in steals per game, was voted an All-Star for the second time, and earned an All-NBA third team selection. Davis also won the Skills Challenge during All-Star Weekend. The Hornets were ultimately ousted in the first round of the playoffs by the Dwyane Wade-led Miami Heat in seven games.\n\nThe Hornets made the playoffs in each of Davis's five years with the team, and only advanced past the first round in the two years he started every game. After Davis was traded to Golden State, New Orleans failed to make the playoffs for three straight years. He played for the U.S. national team in the 2002 FIBA World Championship.[8]\n\nOn February 24, 2005, Davis was traded from the Hornets to the Golden State Warriors for guard Speedy Claxton and veteran forward Dale Davis after tension with the Hornets' coaching staff and several nagging injuries.[9] The move created one of the more potent backcourts in the NBA with Davis and star guard Jason Richardson. It also saw Davis's return to California, where he had craved to return since his college days at UCLA.\n\nAfter two seasons in which the Warriors underachieved under coach Mike Montgomery, the Warriors hired former coach Don Nelson for the 2006â€“07 season. His high-scoring offensive system was designed to fit Davis's up-tempo style. Although Davis suffered through knee soreness and underwent surgery during the season, he still led the league in steals per game and the Warriors to their first playoff appearance since 1994. The Warriors swept the regular season series against the Mavericks 3â€“0, giving them an advantage and won the series against the top-seeded Dallas Mavericks 4â€“2, making them the first No. 8 seed to beat a No. 1 seed since the NBA changed the 1st round from a 5-game series to a 7-game series. It was numerically the largest upset in the history of the NBA playoffs, with the 67â€“15 Mavericks' regular-season winâ€“loss record 25 games better than the 42â€“40 Warriors'. Davis averaged 25 points per game in the series.\n\nSteve Kerr, then television analyst, called Davis's performance in the 2007 NBA playoffs \"outrageous...stunningly athletic and creative and explosive.\"[10] Davis's playoff highlights included numerous acrobatic layups, a buzzer-beating half-court three-pointer, and a memorable dunk over Andrei Kirilenko. The Utah Jazz eliminated the undersized Warriors 4 games to 1.[11] Davis averaged 25.3 points, 6.5 assists, 2.9 steals, and 4.5 rebounds per game in the 2007 Playoffs.[12]\n\nIn 2008, during a playoff elimination game against the Phoenix Suns, Coach Nelson benched Davis at halftime due to his poor play (shooting 2â€“13 in 17 minutes). Down fourteen at the half, the Warriors lost by six. Some sportswriters criticized Nelson's decision to bench his team's star with an entire half left to play; other writers speculated about possible friction between Davis and Nelson, which Nelson denied.[13][14][15] After the 2007â€“08 season, in which the Warriors were narrowly edged out of playoff contention despite a record of 48â€“34 (led by Davisâ€”who remained injury-free throughout the seasonâ€”with averages of 21.8 PPG, 7.6 assists, 2.3 steals, 4.6 RPG), Davis's agent Todd Ramasar stated that Davis might opt out of his contract with the Warriors, which would have paid him $17.8 million, to pursue other options.[16] On June 30, 2008, Davis opted out of his contract with the Golden State Warriors.[17]\n\nOn July 1, 2008, Davis verbally agreed to a 5-year, $65 million deal to play for his hometown team, the Los Angeles Clippers,[18] and officially signed with the Clippers on July 10, 2008.[19] Davis initially decided to join the Clippers with the intent of playing with Elton Brand, but Brand shockingly opted out of his contract to sign with the Philadelphia 76ers. After officially signing with the Clippers, Davis said that Brand's departure had no impact on his decision to come to Los Angeles.[20][21]\n\nPrior to Davis's arrival, the Clippers had never even won their division or conference, and had only advanced past the first round of the playoffs twice since entering the league in 1970. Davis promised to change that, and despite Brand's departure, Clippers fans remained excited to have a star who could compete with crosstown rival Kobe Bryant's popularity.[22]\n\nDavis's first year with the Clippers was marked with a series of injuries and disappointments, as the Clippers struggled to a 19â€“63 record in which Davis was only able to play 65 games, and saw his points per game average and field goal percentage take a steep decline.[23] Despite this, Davis did produce a few bright spots on the year. On November 22, he scored 30 points and handed out 10 assists in a game against the New Jersey Nets.[24] He also had a pair of 20-assist games on the year.\n\nOn November 20, 2009, at a home game vs the Denver Nuggets, Baron reached and surpassed the 5,000-assist mark.[25] In his third year with the Clippers, a rejuvenated and healthy Davis saw some success playing alongside youngsters Eric Gordon, DeAndre Jordan and Rookie of the Year Blake Griffin. While Davis was finally showing the ability that prompted Clippers management to sign him, run-ins with the coaching staff and Clippers' owner Donald Sterling as well as the team's decision to get younger and rebuild, made the Clippers decide to move in a new direction.[26]\n\nOn February 24, 2011, Davis was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers along with a first-round pick (which turned out to be the first overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft, Kyrie Irving), in exchange for Mo Williams and Jamario Moon.[27] This trade to Cleveland marked a reunion between Davis and former coach Byron Scott, to which Davis was quoted as saying \"I know we're together for a reason. There's some things my game can benefit from just playing in his system\". Davis chose to wear no. 85 to honor his grandparents who raised him in Los Angeles and whose house was on 85th Street. In his debut with the Cavs, Baron scored 18 points, grabbed 4 rebounds, had 5 assists, and made four three-point shots, in a win over the New York Knicks.[28]\n\nDespite joining a Cavaliers team who at the time of the trade had the worst record in the NBA (which included a record-setting 26-game losing streak), Davis helped the Cavaliers close the season with several victories,[29] including a 102â€“90 upset victory over LeBron James and the Miami Heat,[30] to ensure that Cleveland did not have the worst record in the league at the season's end.[31]\n\nOn December 14, 2011, the Cavaliers waived Davis via the amnesty clause.[32] He still made the $30 million over the two years left on his contract, but it did not count against Cleveland's salary cap.[33] The Cavaliers had drafted Kyrie Irving with their first overall pick, and wanted to give him the starting point guard spot, allowing Davis to seek a starting job on a contending team. The Knicks, Heat and Lakers were in the market for a point guard at the time.[34]\n\nOn December 19, 2011, Davis signed a one-year contract with the New York Knicks, choosing New York over the Lakers and Heat who also expressed interest in signing Davis.[35] At the time of the signing, Davis had a herniated disk in his back.[33] He did not make his debut for the Knicks until February 20, 2012, coming off the bench to score a three-pointer along with an assist.[36]\n\nDavis took over as the Knicks' starting point guard following the season-ending injury to Jeremy Lin. He also started the four playoff games he played in. On May 6, 2012, during Game 4 of the first round of the playoffs in New York's win against the Miami Heat, Davis injured his right knee while dribbling down the court. He was carted off the court on a stretcher.[37] He underwent surgery after an MRI revealed a partial tear of the patellar tendon in his right knee and complete tears of the right ACL and MCL.[38]\n\nDavis became an unrestricted free agent in the summer of 2012, but he was expected to be out until May 2013 while recovering from his surgery.[39] He made a return to the basketball court in July 2015, scoring 44 points in the Drew League (which was the subject of his documentary The Drew: No Excuse, Just Produce),[40][41] and subsequently announced his interest in returning to the NBA.[42] On January 15, 2016, he signed a contract to play in the NBA Development League,[43] and on March 2, he was acquired by the Delaware 87ers.[44] Two days later, he made his D-League debut in a 114â€“106 loss to the Iowa Energy, recording eight points, one rebound, four assists and three steals in 19 minutes off the bench.[45] In six games for Delaware to conclude the 2015â€“16 season, Davis averaged 12.8 points, 2.5 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 1.2 steals per game.\n\nDavis participated in the NBA Celebrity All-Star Game 2017 as part of Michael Smith's West Team.[46]\n\nOn June 22, 2018, Davis made his debut for 3's Company of the Big3 league, leading the team with 17 points and 9 rebounds in a 21-point win. Davis finished the 2018 season with averages of 15.2 points, 4 rebounds, 1.2 assists, and 1 steal in five games played; he ranked 5th in the league in steals per game, 5th in 3-pointers, and 6th in 3-point percentage.[47]\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high * Led the league â€¡ NBA record\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 1999â€“00 Charlotte 82 0 18.6 .420 .225 .634 2.0 3.8 1.2 .2 5.9 2000â€“01 Charlotte 82 82* 38.9 .427 .310 .677 5.0 7.3 2.1 .4 13.8 2001â€“02 Charlotte 82 82 40.5 .417 .356 .580 4.3 8.5 2.1 .6 18.1 2002â€“03 New Orleans 50 47 37.8 .416 .350 .710 3.7 6.4 1.8 .4 17.1 2003â€“04 New Orleans 67 66 40.1 .395 .321 .673 4.3 7.5 2.4* .4 22.9 2004â€“05 New Orleans 18 13 32.9 .366 .321 .771 3.7 7.2 1.7 .2 18.9 2004â€“05 Golden State 28 19 35.3 .401 .341 .755 3.9 8.3 1.8 .4 19.5 2005â€“06 Golden State 54 48 36.5 .389 .315 .675 4.4 8.9 1.6 .3 17.9 2006â€“07 Golden State 63 62 35.3 .439 .304 .745 4.4 8.1 2.1* .5 20.1 2007â€“08 Golden State 82* 82* 39.0 .426 .330 .750 4.7 7.6 2.3 .5 21.8 2008â€“09 L.A.
