        "text": "Charlotte Hornets ATO Play for Stretch Big\n\nJacob Collins\n\nIt's never too early. I know I am itching to get back into the gym and start working with my guys. Thanks to my autorenewal of League Pass, I've been able to catch some glimpses of a few NBA teams working young guys in and trying to get timing down. This is a play for a stretch big, that came after a timeout in the 2nd half of the Charlotte-Miami preseason game on Sunday. Another resource that coaches can use in the drudgery of waiting for practice to start is NBAtv. All week last week, NBAtv's crew were running their series Inside Training Camp and it was awesome. The interaction between players is fun to watch and there is no doubt that you can take a drill from each practice.

I think it is very important to a teams success that the best players get the most looks and the best looks possible. Sometimes, you also have to get your opponents off balance. I have found the following play successful over the past few seasons, but it seems to me that the more unexpected it is the better. This is a fantastic play to get your trail big an easy bucket.

It's still burned into my mind excellent post players such as David Lee, Jo Noah, and Al Horford dominating my beloved Cats on the block. Although, those are certainly not the only posts that have excelled in his system. This is one of my personal favorites of Coach Donovan and I look forward to seeing how well it works for Kevin Durant. This play is great for multiple reasons. The first, it is a natural counter to a normal secondary break action for the Gators, a spread pick and roll. The guard rejects the screen to drive baseline. The 3 man (normally for Coach Donovan is an excellent 3pt shooter) is spaced in the corner. The key to this play, is freeing up a stretch 4 for an open look. After dishing and spacing, the 1 man leads the stagger for the 4 while the 5 man completes the stagger. What happens if there is a big to big switch? This all depends on your personnel. Let's apply this to Coach Donovan's new team, the Oklahoma City Thunder. If this play is ran for Durant at the 4, the options for the defense aren't pretty. If the screen is gapped, you run the risk of Durant having a wide open look. If you switch, you risk having a center guarding arguably thefts scorer in the league. Again, you don't have KD on your squad and I know I don't. But perhaps this can get you an isolated mismatch. Questions/comments/concerns?

The use of misdirection is key in the game of football and under-utilized in the game of basketball. The first set is what our team calls \"Uno\" because it is a play for our 1 man. You will notice that it is a common action and either you or someone in your league probably runs this play. The second play is just a counter to the action, a misdirection play based on how the defense is playing you. See More\n\nFavorite Send to FastDraw\n\nMavericks Dirk Iso\n\nJacob Collins\n\nThis is the last counter in a series that the Dallas Mavericks used against the Miami Heat in their title run in 2011. Rick Carlisle does an excellent job of recognizing the strengths of the players that he has on the floor and taking advantage of those strengths. In this play sequence Jason Kidd is the (1), JET Jason Terry is the (2), Shawn Marion is the (3), Dirk is the (4), and Tyson Chandler is the (5). This set is a great example of getting your best scorers. Dirk (4) and Jason Terry (2) in position to do some damage. See More\n\nFavorite Send to FastDraw"
