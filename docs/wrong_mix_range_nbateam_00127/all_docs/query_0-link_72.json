(2K11)\n\nAfter an hour or so of editing so teams would get their picks (for the most part..), I'm now ready to start the 2011-2012 season with the Nets.\n\nIn free agency, I was able to snag Nene (albeit in a sign-and-trade where I gave them Marcus Thornton, a backup in Outlaw, Petro as a filler, and a 1st rounder) and then sign AK47 for cheap, while retaining Kris Humphries. The Nets now have a very solid trio of big men moving forward to please Deron Williams (hopefully).\n\nMy opening game was against the Knicks, which is great for the rivalry in the works. Carmelo Anthony went off for 41 points, but Amar'e fouled out in the 4th.\n\nThat being said, I was able to pull off a 7 point win at the Garden thanks to a double-double by Deron Williams and a 23 point game by Brook Lopez (still a horrible rebounder though.. with 3 haha)\n\nMarshon Brooks and Nene both made solid debuts and I'm liking what they bring to the team which looks like this:\n\nDeron Williams / Jordan Farmar / Sundiata Gaines\n\nMarshon Brooks / Anthony Morrow / Sasha Vujacic\n\nAndrei Kirilenko / Damion James\n\nNene / Kris Humphries / Al Harrington\n\nBrook Lopez / Jordan Williams\n\nRookie\n\nOVR: 0\n\nJoin Date: Mar 2011\n\nRe: How's Your Association Going? (2K11)\n\nTo all you Cavs fans on this boards i want to share this with you. Here is my cavs association status.\n\nWe're in the first round of the 2012 eastern conference playoffs against the Miami Heat here's the breakdown\n\nMy Cavs Roster\n\nLebron James\n\nRajon Rondo\n\nWilson Chandler\n\nAlonzo Gee\n\nEddie House\n\nLamar Odom\n\nAvery Bradley\n\nHasheem Thabeet\n\nJJ Hickson\n\nJonas Jerbko\n\nGabe Tinsley\n\nIssac Warrick\n\nAj Price\n\nMiami Heat Roster\n\nDwayne Wade\n\nChris Bosh\n\nMario Chalmers\n\nOkan Izzet\n\nShane Battier\n\nNicholas Duncan\n\nMarcus Camby\n\nPatrick Beverly\n\nRyan Gomes\n\nBrevin Knight\n\nTyler Holmes\n\nJacque Micloud\n\nMike Miller\n\nJoel Anthony\n\nThe series is tied 2-2 and tonight is game 5 in Cleveland and then game 6 will be in Miami Game 7 will be in Cleveland.\n\nHere's the rest of the Eastern conference playoffs status in my association\n\nCharlotte Bobcats Vs Indiana Pacers Series Tied 2-2\n\nNew York Knicks Vs Milwaukee Bucks Series Tied 2-2\n\nChicago Bulls Vs Atlanta Chicago Leads Series 3-1\n\nWestern Conference Playoffs Round 1\n\nOklahoma Thunder Vs Memphis Grizzlies Memphis Leads Series 3-1\n\nHouston Rockets Vs Denver Nuggets Denver Leads Series 3-1\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Vs Los Angeles Clippers Series Tied 2-2\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves Vs Utah Jazz Series Tied 2-2\n\nI hope to win tonight's game Miami is tough and mario chalmers and dwayne wade are both insane with the 3pts shooting . but looking at my roster and miami roster what do you guys think of my situation and to all my cavs fans tonight is the night i need all the support in the world Cavs Fans Unite i will post and update throughout the whole series and keep you guys informed\n\nPro\n\nOVR: 6\n\nJoin Date: Dec 2010\n\nLocation: Connecticut/Brooklyn\n\nRe: How's Your Association Going? (2K11)\n\nSo I simmed up to trade deadline. I checked Kevin Love's morale dude is the happiest guy on planet smh, I really wanted to trade him away. His morale said something like how he loves the fans, the organization and he wants to work on a contract extension ASAP. I felt that it would be unrealistic if I traded him away, so I only got rid of Beasley who had his mind set on cashing on alot of fetti this summer.\n\nI tried doing the Iggy deal, but Lou Williams being injured ruined it, 2K needs to allow us to trade injured players because it happens in real life. So I decided to go after Rudy Gay in Memphis.\n\nSo the trade was:\n\nMinny receives:\n\nRudy Gay\n\n1st Rd Pick\n\nGrizzlies receives:\n\nMichael Beasley\n\nShane Battier\n\n1st Rd Pick\n\nNow my roster is:\n\nRidnour/Rubio\n\nWesley Johnson/Ellington\n\nRudy Gay/Korver\n\nKevin Love/Anthony Randolph\n\nDarko/Enes Kanter/Tolliver\n\nI'm gonna play at least 5-10 more games before I sim to the Playoffs. We currently stand 8th seed in the West, hopefully we could stay there.\n\n__________________\n\nAdd me om PSN for a good game of basketball!\n\nPSN IsomotionKing\n\n#HelloBrooklyn"
