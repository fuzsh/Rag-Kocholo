Shane Battier (@ShaneBattier), a PCA National Advisory Board Member, led Duke to the 2001 NCAA National Championship while distinguishing himself as the 2001 Academic All-American of the year. He also helped win two NBA championships with the Miami Heat in 2012 and 2013, but is more renowned for being a “no stats all-star” due to his unselfish play and ability to make his teammates better.

Here, Battier explains that the favorite team he has ever played for was his 1995 Detroit Country Day High School Basketball team. While the team won the state championship, that is not why Battier remains so fond of that team even today. Even in an illustrious career, Battier has never played for a team that worked more effectively together than that high school team.

The team was effective because everyone was accountable and no one accepted anything other than the best from one another. To Battier, this accountability not only helped them win, but also created a cohesive environment that he continued to value throughout his career.
