        "text": "Kill The Messenger has all the ingredients for success; an incredible true story, an outstanding lead actor, and some wonderful dramatic tension, but I feel as though this film did not quite reach its full potential.\n\nReview by Cherie Wheeler\n\nBased on the life of Gary Webb (Jeremy Renner), Kill The Messenger follows the exposure of one of the most shocking and controversial scandals in the history of the US government. Webb published a series of articles for the San Jose Mercury News in the 1990s that proved the CIA was importing drugs from South America to fund the war in Nicaragua. His articles sparked outrage, and rival publications responded by making every effort to discredit Webb, hence taking the spotlight off his story, and instead placing his personal life under a microscope. The resultant pressure placed upon his family and colleagues pushed Webb to his limits, but he remained determined to report the truth. Directed by Michael Cuesta, this political drama also features Rosemarie DeWitt, May Elizabeth Winstead, Andy Garcia, Oliver Platt, Michael Sheen and Ray Liotta.\n\nThere are moments of brilliance throughout this film; in certain scenes I found that my eyes were glued to the screen, and I was sitting on the edge of my seat. During these times the narrative was so engaging that it completely consumed me; I forgot that I was sitting in a cinema in the 21st century, and I felt as though I was right there in the room with the characters. Most of the scenes that provoked this response from me were directly related to Webb’s investigation, as I was equally driven to learn the truth. Of course a film must contain light and shade; however, I did find my attention waning in the less dramatic scenes, particularly those centred around the family conflict.\n\nMichael Cuesta’s direction of the film was not as strong as I would have liked, in the sense that he did not seem to know what kind of story he was trying to tell. Is this a film about how the CIA deceived the people of America? Or is it about a family man who was destroyed by bureaucratic powers? Or is it about the relationships between him and his family, and how his wife and children have been impacted by his work? The film tends to portray all three of these storylines, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but I felt that none of these plots were adequately developed to be considered the focus of the film.\n\nThe best way for me to explain this is to compare the narrative to the arrangement of the singers in a boy band. Even though there are four or more members in the band, there is always a lead singer, then a secondary lead, and the others are simply there for support. If all four members were attempting to sing the lead at the same time it would not be effective, and this is how the story came across to me in Kill The Messenger. Having said that, the narrative is not disordered or difficult to understand in any way, it’s just not as cohesive as it could have been.\n\nJeremy Renner is sheer perfection as Gary Webb. I have never been particularly impressed by Renner until now, and what I really like about him is the fact that he does not look like the typical glamorous, Hollywood actor with the flawless skin, and immaculate hair that has evidently just been touched up by a stylist moments before a new take. He truly is a chameleon both in terms of his physical appearance, and his ability to portray a character. From The Hurt Locker (2008), to American Hustle (2013), to The Bourne Legacy (2012) he completely transforms himself, and is equally convincing in all of these roles. He kind of reminds me of Russell Crowe about 10 years ago, and in actuality, Russell Crowe probably would have been first preference for the role back then.\n\nThere are some fantastic cameos throughout the film, most notably from Andy Garcia and Michael Sheen, but I must say, I found the brief appearance from Ray Liotta to be a little odd. This particular scene is not lit very well (there is a reason for this), and it took me a while to even recognise that it was Liotta, consequently it seemed kind of pointless to cast him in this role, as anyone could have done the part. The whole scene is quite bizarre in itself, but as this is a true story, I suppose it must have really happened.\n\nThe cinematography also gets a huge tick from me; I adore the use of shallow depth of field (for those who may not know, this is when the background appears blurred, and only the subject in the foreground is clear), and I think this was really effective in creating this sense of isolation that Webb experienced when he was abandoned by everyone in his life.\n\nI am also a fan of the score; I always prefer it when the music in a film uses various sounds and instruments to produce a certain atmosphere. This way the score becomes a subtle element that complements the film as a whole, rather than overpowering every scene, and drawing attention to itself.\n\nOverall, I believe this film had a lot of potential, and whilst I did enjoy it, I felt like it weighed in at 7 on a scale of 1 to 10, whereas it could have reached the highest degree. As it just fell short of greatness, I am giving Kill The Messenger 3.5 stars.\n\nThe title Pride suggests exactly what this film is about; a group of gay people wanting to shout about something. What the title doesn’t tell you is that the shouting is not about anyone’s sexuality, but about solidarity.\n\nReview by Chantal Victor\n\nPride is a beautiful story based on the true events of a group of youngsters trying to help raise funds for the miners who go on strike due to the closing of the Irish pits by Thatcher in 1984 in London. The true struggle comes when the community of miners become divided by their opinions in regards to the youngsters being gay. Director Matthew Warchus (Simpatico) does a phenomenonal job of expressing the story, and avoiding the use of stereotypical gay personas; instead, the characters come across as more in-depth people we could meet at any point in our lives. This could also be due to the amazing performances from the main actors; Ben Schnetzer (The Book Thief) and George MacKay (Defiance, Peter Pan).\n\nAs a director of a short documentary about Drag Queen’s in Perth, I understand how important the delivery of a message is when the subject revolves around homosexual people. So prior to viewing the film, my first question was; how will the story be told without offending certain audience members? At the heart of this film is not a message about sexuality, but about the solidarity between the gay activists and the miners, and the history made between them in that year. The film took me on a lovely rollercoaster of emotions as the characters, Mark, the group leader (Ben Schnetzer), Ben, the new gay (George MacKay) and Jonathan, the flamboyant actor (Dominic West) kept the general atmosphere quirky and flamboyant, whilst also allowing the occasional dip into a more serious tone to deal with issues that still arise today within our society, such as AIDS, money and family matters. The story is based on true events, but it never feels over dramatized; it’s true to the roots of the idea.\n\nI have spent many hours with the most amazing people who are homosexuals, but because of the way they are stereotyped, most people don’t take the time to get to know them. I feel this film really captured the true personalities that others seldom get to see because of what they have been brought up to believe about people’s sexual preferences. This film did not try push the idea of homosexuality onto the audience members as some films do, and I could tell by the way people were laughing and enjoying the film that they did not once feel like their own beliefs were being threatened.\n\nThe film would obviously not have been the same without the miners. The community of miners consisted of many opinionated people, which eventually divides the group in half when deciding whether they should accept the money raised, or keep their pride, and not take any help from homosexuals. The four main leaders are spectacularly played by Imelda Staunton ( Harry Potter and the deathly Hallows: Part 1), Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End), Paddy Considine ( The Bourne Ultimatum, Cinderella Man) and Jessica Gunning (Law and order :UK). These well-known actors never outshone the true heroes of the story; the activists who tried to make a change in society. I must give a special mention to the fantastic performances by Nighy and Staunton; they balanced the warmth and sternness of their characters so well, and bounced off each other with great chemistry.\n\nThis film is probably my favourite film of the year purely because of the heart behind it. I left the cinema feeling like I had made new friends because I was so emotionally invested in the film. I give this film 4.5 stars.\n\nAfter viewing Akiva Goldsman’s Winter’s Tale earlier this year, I did not think I would ever encounter an equally confusing film, but newly released war film Fury comes very close.\n\nReview by Cherie Wheeler\n\nIt’s 1945, and although World War II is coming to an end, the American troops remain in German territory, and the fighting wages on. Written and directed by action filmmaker David Ayer, Fury follows Don “Wardaddy” Collier (Brad Pitt) who commands a tight knit team that operate a tank after which the film is named. Following the death of one of their comrades, the freshly recruited Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) is ordered to join the crew, but he is not exactly welcomed with open arms. Norman struggles to cope with the horrors of war, and this coupled with his aversion to violence causes his popularity among the other men to suffer even further. After a devastating loss on the battlefield that leaves Fury as the last US tank standing, Collier convinces his men to join him on a suicide mission in which they are outnumbered by Germans, 60 to 1. Shia LaBeouf, Michael Peña and Jon Bernthal also star.\n\nLike a lot of viewers, I have certainly seen my fair share of war movies. From the earlier films (Bridge On The River Kwai ), to those released this year (Lone Survivor), to those covering the Vietnam War (Full Metal Jacket), to films about the more recent wars throughout the Middle East and Afghanistan (Black Hawk Down), from American TV shows (Band of Brothers), to Australian feature films (Beneath Hill 60); my point is that I have a lot of previous viewing experience with which to compare this latest film, and I can honestly say that Fury might just be the worst war film ever made.\n\nThe root of the problem lies with David Ayer’s utterly baffling screenplay. For the majority of the film I was sitting there wondering; why is this even happening right now? There is no plot structure or storyline; events simply unfold without any meaning or purpose. I struggled to explain the narrative in my plot synopsis above, and the suicide mission I refer to (which is marketed as the key plot point in the film) actually only takes place in the last 30 minutes.\n\nEach of the five main characters that comprise the tank team are highly underdeveloped, and riddled with inconsistencies. For example; Jon Bernthal’s character does not seem to know whether he respects his commander, loathes him, or loves him to the extent that he would die for him, and he tends to flit between each of these states without any justification. Collier is equally erratic, which becomes most apparent when he starts screaming, “I’m going to hold this crossroad,” and insists on taking on this completely pointless endeavour that will have no impact on the war whatsoever. At first his men object to his insanity, but naturally, out of loyalty to him, they eventually decide to help him in this ridiculous mission.\n\nPerhaps Ayer was simply trying to demonstrate the absurdity of war, and the madness that overcomes men as a result of being subjected to this, which may explain the irrational actions of each of the characters, but this is not just cause for the many bizarre events that comprise the overall narrative. A near half hour scene in the home of two German women is a prime example. This scene, much like the film as a whole, has so much potential, but in the end it comes across as a hot mess. Far too many ideas and subplots were packed into this scene, consequently none of them were able to be fully explored, and all of them were executed poorly.\n\nI have a lot respect and admiration for Brad Pitt and his acting abilities, but honestly, what the hell was he thinking when he agreed to take on this project? He is satisfactory in the lead role; whilst he does not excel, at least he isn’t dreadful, unlike some of his co-stars.\n\nFor almost 80 per cent of the movie Shia LaBeouf looks like he is about to burst into tears, as if he has been sniffing onions in between takes. The southern accent he puts on is so thick that most of the time you will have no idea what he is saying. All of the cast members throw an excessive amount of emotion around the screen that comes across as both contrived and at times unnecessary. Logan Lerman is the only saving grace in the film. Young Australian actor Xavier Samuel has a brief appearance early on, and at first I was a little disappointed that he did not snag Lerman’s role, but afterwards I realised that this was a blessing. A lead role in this film may have ruined Samuel’s career, which is still in its infancy.\n\nI must give credit where credit is due, however, and the sound design throughout Fury is quite good, although not as good as that in Lone Survivor. There are some interesting shots here and there, such as a pull focus from a close up of the boots of a dead man hanging in the streets, to a wide shot of the American tanks slowly rolling down the main road. The opening scene of a German soldier on horseback is also shot beautifully, and during this scene there is an instance of violence that is very confronting, which led me to believe that the rest of the film would follow in this style, but sadly it was all downhill from there.\n\nThe only reason I did not walk out of the cinema when watching this film is because of my need to write this review, consequently I am giving Fury 1.5 stars.\n\nThis month we’ve decided to take a look back at one of the most iconic films of the 1940s, Michael Curtiz’s Casablanca.\n\nReview by Cherie Wheeler\n\n“Play it once Sam, for old time’s sake,” became an immortal phrase after it was spoken by Ingrid Bergman in the 1942 film Casablanca. The film as a whole has also endured time, and is as well known today as it was when it was first released more than 7 decades ago. This black and white World War II drama is considered one of the greatest films of all time alongside other classic titles such as Citizen Kane and Gone With The Wind. Its ground breaking screenplay, as well as its phenomenal direction from Michael Curtiz earned the film 3 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and also cemented its position as a significant milestone in the history of film.\n\nHumphrey Bogart stars as Rick Blaine, the cynical owner of Rick’s Café Américain; a popular destination for those forced to remain in Morocco as a result of the war. Tensions rise when renowned fugitive and Czech Resistance leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) comes to town seeking passage to America, which is further complicated when he arrives with Rick’s ex lover, Isla Lund (Ingrid Bergman), in tow. German Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt) becomes determined to prevent Laszlo from leaving the country, and although Rick insists he is neutral in all matters of war, he inevitably becomes caught between the opposing sides. Claude Rains also features in the film as Captain Louis Renault; a local, corrupt law official who frequents Rick’s establishment.\n\nThere is a universality to Casablanca that transcends time; most notably in the well developed, multi layered relationships between the characters, and also due to the fact that it was not only set during WWII, but was also written and shot during this time. Whilst this would have been interesting to watch at the time of its release, it continues to be fascinating to later audiences.\n\nThe outstanding script by Howard E Koch, Julius J Epstein and Phillip G Epstein is an adaptation of the stage play Everybody Comes To Rick’s by Murray Burnett and Joan Allison. As the play was never produced, it is difficult to ascertain who is responsible for which stroke of genius, however, the screenwriters tend to get all the credit. The playwrights did contest their ownership of the work in the 1980s without success; however, Warner Brothers did allow them to stage the script for a limited season in the 1990s. Regardless of who is recognised as the creative owner of the script in the eyes of the law, all of these writers must be applauded for this screenplay. The dialogue is filled with many wonderfully witty lines, and is cleverly composed to contain multiple meanings. It manages to convey exactly what the characters are thinking and feeling, without stating it outright; the latter of which is a huge pet peeve of mine.\n\nThis masterful writing would have been wasted without the correct casting, but fortunately all of the performances are exceptional. Bogart is definitely the stand out, and even though he had been starring in a lot of films prior to 1942, he had not yet reached the pinnacle of his career, which arguably was kicked off by his role in Casablanca. Afterwards came a string of collaborations with his wife Lauren Bacall, such as To Have And Have Not, as well as his other hits including The African Queen. His appearance in Casablanca would have to be my favourite performance of his; he lives and breathes the character with such credibility, and he expresses the personality of the character with ease. Even when he is being pessimistic and a little antisocial, he is still likeable, and you are always on his side. Ingrid Bergman delivers a strong performance; however, she is slightly outshone by Bogart. Having said that I don’t think any other actresses of her vintage could have done justice to the role as she does. Claude Rains is just hilarious without even trying, like Bogart; it all comes so easily to him. All of the supporting cast members are equally convincing, and no matter how minor their role, none of them seem out of place.\n\nOf course, who could forget the music in Casablanca, particularly Herman Hupfeld’s As Time Goes By, which has so much significance within the narrative. I adore this song, and its nostalgic, yet melancholic tones that perfectly sum up how the main characters remember their previous time together. Max Steiner, who also composed the music for Gone With The Wind a few years earlier, also does an excellent job with the orchestral score.\n\nOverall, the direction by Michael Curtiz is probably the most superb element of all, as he is responsible for bringing all of the individual elements together to create the amazing package that is Casablanca. Prolific filmmaker from the 1920s-60s, William Wyler, was apparently the first choice for the directing position, and an obvious choice given the sorts of projects he usually led, including Wuthering Heights (1939) and Jezebel (1938), and then later Ben-Hur (1959) and Roman Holiday (1953), but Curtiz is without a doubt the right man for this film. He is literally the magical glue that holds Casablanca together and ensures that this film ranks 100% on the entertainment scale.\n\nIf you haven’t already guessed , I am a huge fan of Casablanca and it is one of my favourite films of all time. It has everything you could ever want from a film; tragedy, comedy, and twists and turns in the narrative that will suck you into the world of the film, and have you barracking for Rick and Isla to win out against the odds. A must watch for all; viewing Casablanca should be on everyone’s bucket list.\n\nAfter the disaster that was Grace of Monaco, it would have been nice to see Nicole Kidman redeem herself in this latest film of hers, but sadly, Before I Go To Sleep is filled with inconsistencies.\n\nReview by Chantal Victor\n\nBased on the best-selling novel by S J Watson, Before I Go To Sleep follows Christine Lucas (Nicole Kidman), who suffers from anterograde amnesia as a result of significant head trauma. Every night when Christine goes to bed, her mind is wiped clean of any memory created that day, leaving her with no memory of anything in her past. She has two men in her life; Ben Lucas (Colin Firth) who claims to be her husband, and psychologist Dr. Nash (Mark Strong), who tries to help her remember her past, including the person responsible for bringing about her accident. Produced by Ridley Scott (Prometheus), and directed by Rowan Joffe (28 Days Later, The American), the film revolves around Christine’s daily struggle with her memories, and her journey towards learning who she can really trust.\n\nBefore I Go To Sleep is marketed as a psychological thriller, and even though the concept of waking up every morning with no memory of your identity is suited to this genre, I don’t think this idea was conveyed to the audience as well as it could have been. A psychological thriller works well when you let the audience think about what is happening, and leave something to their imagination. Unfortunately, this film presented almost all of the information upfront; it puts all of the pieces of the puzzle together for you, and takes away all the mystery. In the end, only 10 minutes of this 92 minute film could actually be considered “thrilling”.\n\nAs always, Nicole Kidman plays the emotional damsel in distress, and does not bring anything to her performance that we have not seen before in her previous films, such as Moulin Rouge. Every day Christine records her new memories on camera, and then watches the videos back the following morning. She relives painful memories over and over again, and Nicole manages to portray this with emotional depth, however, her performance does leave the audience questioning certain actions performed by her character. At times Christine comes across as a frail married woman who is looking to men for any answers she can get, but then at other times she is a strong independent woman who is fighting for herself. I understand that characters can go through changes as a film progresses, but it should never happen at the flick of a switch, and leave audiences wondering how/why it has happened so quickly.\n\nThe performances from both Colin Firth and Mark Strong were more convincing than that of Nicole, but both showed signs of weakness at times. This may partially be because they don’t feature much in the film, and don’t really get time to develop their characters in front of the viewer. I believe if both actors had more screen time that the film may have slightly improved.\n\nTechnology plays a big role in this film purely because the only information Christine feels she can trust about her past are the videos that she records of herself. Some of the repetitive scenes of her using the camera are shot in an interesting way; one which stands out is where Christine is recording her memories of the day, and the entire frame is taken up by the LCD screen of the camera, leaving the shot as an extreme close-up. It allows the audience into her personal space, which can be very confronting.\n\nWhilst watching Before I Go To Sleep I was not left thinking about the nightmare of memory loss, or the frightening thought of losing the essence of oneself, and instead found myself focussing on the many flaws throughout the film. Even though the performances had some good moments, and the plot had a lot of potential, the execution of the narrative as a psychological thriller failed, which is why I give this film only 2 stars.\n\nSon Of A Gun is a refreshing Australian film devoid of kangaroos, heightened accents and sweeping shots of the outback. On account of its killer performances and awesome action sequences, I would easily call it the best Australian film of 2014 so far.\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐\n\nReview by Cherie Wheeler\n\nIn the action/thriller Son of A Gun, 19-year-old JR (Brenton Thwaites) is forced to strike a deal with notorious criminal Brendan Lynch (Ewan McGregor) whilst serving a short term sentence at a maximum security prison in Western Australia. In exchange for protection from some unsavoury cellmates, JR must play a key role in a daring plan that will see Brendan and his comrades escape from the jail. Upon the successful execution of the break out, JR is inducted into Brendan’s crew, and an uncanny father/son relationship develops between the pair. Despite being in hiding, Brendan insists on attempting a dangerous, multimillion dollar heist at a gold mine in Kalgoorlie. When it all goes terribly wrong, JR quickly realises that it is every man for himself, and that absolutely no one can be trusted.\n\nAustralian films generally operate on fairly modest budgets, therefore we very rarely see an attempt on genres that rely heavily on special effects or epic action sequences. In the 1980s George Miller proved through his Mad Max franchise that Australia is more than capable of producing high quality action films for a fraction of the cost of the average Hollywood blockbuster, and now for the first time since then, writer/director Julius Avery has once again demonstrated this with Son Of A Gun.\n\nAt a question and answer session at Luna Cinemas in Leederville, Western Australia, Avery referenced the works of Michael Mann, in particular his 1995 film Heat, as his inspiration for the visual style of Son Of A Gun. These films are very similar in the sense that they both stay true to the conventions of the action/thriller genre, but they also include well developed characters, as well as an emotive storyline that underpins all of the action. Avery humbly admitted that he did not think his action sequences were quite as good as those in Heat, and as a fellow worshipper of this film I would have to agree with his admission, but nevertheless, Avery’s direction throughout Son Of A Gun is still pretty damn good. Particularly noteworthy is an insane car chase that takes place in the dusty plains of the mines in Kalgoorlie. The harsh sound design, coupled with the fast, brutal editing throughout this scene causes you to feel every bump in the road, and every violent collision between vehicles, as if you are right there with the characters. Avery said that whilst audiences are accustomed to the typical car chase sequence that manages to find its way into almost every action film, it was unlikely that they would have ever seen one against a background that is so unique to Western Australia; and he is 100% right. His exploitation of this location during this scene provides a truly original viewing experience.\n\nThe Queensland-born lead actor Brenton Thwaites has been popping up all over the place of late in films such as Oculus (2013), Maleficent (2014), and most recently The Giver (2014). You may remember him as the cocky, rebellious high school kid on Home And Away a few years back, but he has certainly come a long way since then. Kudos to Avery for casting Thwaites as JR as although the young actor is able to exude the tough and surly exterior of a teenage criminal, the moment he starts talking you realise he is just a naive and innocent kid, which perfectly sums up the character.\n\nEwan McGregor is scintillating on screen; he has this presence that demands your attention, to the point where he is almost a little too convincing. All of the performances from the supporting cast are top notch, especially that of Matt Nable, Jacek Koman, and a brief, but bizarre appearance from Damon Herriman. The only weak link is in JR’s love interest played by Alicia Vikander. She certainly gives it her all during an intense action sequence where she fights for her life, and for the most part she delivers a solid performance, however, in one scene where she helplessly witnesses JR attempt to fight his way out of a dangerous situation, her emotional reaction is incredibly superficial and very distracting.\n\nI am a huge fan of minimal dialogue, or at least only using dialogue when absolutely necessary, so in this respect I am in admiration of Avery’s screenplay. On the other hand, I felt as though there were a few clunky elements in the script, such as the overuse of chess references, and the collage of a perfect life that Thwaites’ character constantly carries around. There is also a not-so-subtle inclusion of a shot of regular teenage boys hanging out and riding their bikes when JR is in the middle of a crisis. Although I understand the reasoning behind the inclusion of each of these elements, I think they could have been handled with a little more grace, but these are only minor problems that I had with the film.\n\nWhat really sold the film to me was the unexpected, dark humour; the whole audience was cracking up during certain parts. I’m not sure how much of it was intentional, but this comedic relief was really effective. I’ve already said this on Twitter, but I will say it again; Son Of A Gun is definitely the best Australian film of 2014 so far, and consequently I am giving it 4 stars.\n\nImages courtesy of EntertainmentOne\n\nThe concept of a troubled father and son relationship becoming further complicated as the latter represents the other in court has a lot of potential, but I fear the choice to tell this simple story on a grand scale budget is the film’s undoing.\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐\n\nReview by Cherie Wheeler\n\nIn David Dobkin’s “The Judge”, Robert Downey Jr sheds his Iron Man suit to take on the role of Hank Palmer; a successful lawyer who returns to his hometown in Indiana following the death of his mother. At first he intends to leave straight after the funeral, but his time back home quickly turns into an extended visit when his father (Robert Duvall), a respected local judge, is accused of murder. Old family grievances rise to the surface, and relationships are tested, as Hank takes on his father’s case, and strives to obtain a “not guilty” verdict despite the mountain of damaging evidence against him.\n\nThis is a typical Hollywood film that a lot of people will thoroughly enjoy due to the fact that it is very entertaining, the story is incredibly easy to follow, and as it is based on family relationships, most will be able to relate to its subject matter. Add Robert Downey Jr’s face into the mix, and sprinkle in some comedic scenes, and the producers must have thought they had a gold mine on their hands.\n\nOn the other hand, more sophisticated viewers will cringe at its woefully predictable storyline, and its heavy tendency toward the melodramatic, which could easily rival an average episode of The Bold And The Beautiful. Every single element of The Judge is awfully clichéd, and highly contrived, from the writing, to the performances, and even the cinematography. The epic fade to white, the slow motion footsteps, and the theatrical score that overpowers all of the natural sound in the climactic court scene is more than a little excessive. It seems Dobkin has this irrational need to drench every aspect of the film in Hollywood glamour.\n\nMy biggest problem with this film, however, would have to be the overbearing score as it is predominantly responsible for creating the melodrama throughout the intense courtroom scenes. Each track is just like all the others we have heard before in every dramatic American film that has ever existed, with an obvious selection of instruments in a mediocre arrangement. What stuns me is that Thomas Newman, the composer behind films such as The Shawshank Redemption, American Beauty, The Help and Skyfall, is responsible for this below average score, which leads me to wonder exactly how much of an influence the director had over the music.\n\nSimilarly, director of photography Janusz Kaminski has an impressive list of credits to his name, including almost every film made by Stephen Spielberg in the last twenty odd years. He has previously worked on War Horse, Lincoln and Schindler’s List, but these are all epic films that demand sweeping cinematography, and expensive shots, whereas this style of shooting throughout The Judge is far too extreme.\n\nKaminski has certainly demonstrated that he is capable of more delicate and contained cinematography, such as in the beautiful French film The Diving Bell & The Butterfly, for which he won the Vulcan Prize at Cannes Film Festival. I feel a more stripped back and raw style of shooting would have been far more effective in The Judge. Every scene was perfectly lit as though it had been shot in a controlled studio, which only added to the superficiality of the whole film. The endless crane and helicopter shots used to encapsulate the locations came across as pretentious and flashy, as if trying to remind the audience of the big budget the film had to work with, and I felt these shots were entirely unjustified.\n\nRobert Downey Jr was very convincing in the lead role, and he managed to deliver even the more poorly written dialogue with finesse. He was able to simultaneously portray both the unpleasantness and wittiness of the lawyer in the character, as well as his vulnerability as an underappreciated son. My only issue with Robert Downey Jr is his lack of suitability to the role. You can dress him in a cap and a t shirt, and attempt to pass him off as a boy from Indiana who cannot escape his past, but no matter what you do to Robert Downey Jr’s appearance, he still looks like a movie star.\n\nRobert Duvall is adequate as the stubborn, old judge, and he exhibits glimpses of greatness during his scene on the witness stand. I found it distracting to have so many well known faces in the supporting cast including Vera Farmiga, Vincent D’Onofrio, Leighton Meester, Billy Bob Thornton and Dax Shepard, and with the exception of perhaps Shepard, all of them are extremely bland on screen. Most disappointing of all is Farmiga, whose character is really just a superfluous subplot that fills in a bit of time. Jeremy Strong is definitely the stand out among the minor characters in his nuanced performance as Hank’s younger brother with a mild mental disability. It’s always a challenge to convey a character with any form of disability, and Strong does so without becoming irritating or over the top at any point.\n\nOverall, I think the downfall of The Judge is the lack of experience among the key creatives who seem to have been swallowed up by the excitement of having so much money to play with in this film. This is the first drama David Dobkin has ever attempted, with his only major credits being banal comedies Wedding Crashers and The Change-Up, and the writers have been involved in very few projects previously. Although I could not handle the melodrama in this film, I still found parts of it to be enjoyable, and I believe that it will be a well liked film among many viewers, which is why I am giving it 3 stars.\n\nImages courtesy of Warner Bros\n\nRichie Mehta’s Siddharth is far from a traditional Bollywood film in its gritty portrayal of child trafficking in present day India\n\nReview by Chantal Victor\n\nSiddharth is a warm and compelling film that is based on a true story, and directed by Richie Mehta (I’ll Follow You Down). Mehta met a man in the streets of Dehli in 2010, which became the inspiration for this drama. The man asked Mehta if he knew where ‘Dongri’ was because he had been told his son might have been sent there as a result of child trafficking. This film captures both the highs and the lows that this man and his family went through in order to try and find their son.\n\nIn the first act, Mahendra Saini (Rajesh Tailang) says goodbye to his son at the local bus station in Dehli as he sends him off to go work in an illegal factory to support the family. Once his son doesn’t return home when expected, the family does everything in their power to find him. Mahendra’s wife, Suman Saini (Tannishtha Chatterjee) even tries to sell the only expensive pair of earrings she has left.\n\nFollowing the opening scene is a montage of images that depict the streets of Delhi. The images are of ordinary people doing their daily duties, whether it be sleeping under a tree, or waiting for customers at their windows; there is nothing specific about the subjects chosen other than commenting on the gritty lifestyle of India. This is kept constant as the film moves from Dehli to Maharashtra, and then to Mumbai. I do think some of the montages could have been a bit shorter at times because it did tend to drag, however, this may have been a stylistic choice to make the viewer feel like the parents, and how they felt while searching for their son.\n\nUnlike conventional Indian films, Siddharth is not filled with hours of singing, dancing and elaborate outfits; instead, only one song is sung twice by the male characters at crucial moments in the film. This “less is more” approach had a much greater emotional impact on me as a viewer as it came across as a heartfelt cry to the gods to help find the little boy, rather than just another musical number.\n\nTraditionally, Indian films revolve around a couple who are usually in love, and needing to get married, such as the iconic Monsoon Wedding, which is based around the strong bond between families. There are many times when Mahendra suggests taking a bus to another city or even a train, but hesitates as he explains that it would take 20 days at most to raise enough money to do so. Comments like these are made throughout the film about the economy of the country, and one that stood out to me was the fact that both parents couldn’t read or write, which meant they couldn’t spell their son’s name to any authorities needing details. The illiteracy of the country is then again questioned by a police officer who asks why Mahendra’s son was sent to a factory, and not to a school in the first place. The poverty cycle keeps going; without money no family members can attend school.\n\nThere were times where I felt hopeless for the family, especially when the parents started questioning what their son looked like. As a viewer I only saw the son once really quickly in the beginning of the film. At first I thought it was strange to have the story revolve around a character that no one sees, but I’ve come to realise that I felt like the father who also couldn’t remember his son after a while, and therefore felt his pain and anguish. Not once did this film feel like it was being over dramatized as other adaptations of true stories often do.\n\nEven after having no photos to show authorities, no money to travel to all the destinations, and no contact with their son; the family manages to remain hopeful. They cry, laugh and stay optimistic together throughout the film, which is what Mehta wanted to encapsulate.\n\nI would recommend Siddharth to those who enjoy films based on true stories, as you will empathise with the Saini family, and the many families in India who go through this on a day to day basis. I give Siddharth a 3.5 star rating.\n\nImages courtesy of Pinnacle Films\n\nIt was a very unusual viewing experience to not know which character to trust, or with which to empathise, but this only adds to the twists and turns of this epic psychological thriller.\n\nBased on the best-selling novel of the same title by Gillian Flynn, Gone Girl follows Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) who is accused of murdering his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) when she mysteriously disappears. Directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button), this psychological thriller has received a lot of hype prior to its release, and I assure you, it does not disappoint.\n\nThe core concept of this film is highly reliant on the quality of the performances from the two lead actors, and at first, I was not entirely convinced by the casting choices. For the duration of the first act, I found both performances to be rather stilted, and I felt uncomfortable watching these two actors struggle to ignite non-existent chemistry. In the fairytale romance scenes that portray how this married couple first met, it was almost as if the actors were trying too hard to create unique characters with quirky personalities. I also did not find either of them to be particularly likeable, but upon a significant turning point at the commencement of the second act, both characters started to grow on me. Additionally, both performances began to dramatically improve at this point in the narrative, and continued to grow stronger as the film progressed, especially Rosamund Pike, who became eerily convincing. It was a very unusual viewing experience to not know which character to trust, or with which to empathise, but this really enhanced the twists and turns of the narrative, and I thoroughly enjoyed this technique.\n\nI have not read the novel, so I am not about to get into a debate that compares the page to the screen, however, I do know that the book is relatively thin, which is surprising considering the vast amount of content jammed into this 145 minute film. Gillian Flynn also wrote the screenplay, which leads me to believe that the adaptation must be fairly true to the original story. The narrative certainly kept me on my toes; it moves at quite a pace, and effortlessly skips back and forth through time. Each scene that is set in the past reveals new and intriguing details, which leads you to question what is occurring in the present, and I found this to be very engaging. My only criticism is a result of personal preference, as I am the type of viewer who likes to feel as though something has been accomplished by committing to view a film from start to finish. Although I found the journey in between to be utterly thrilling, I did not leave the cinema with the level of satisfaction that I would have liked.\n\nFor me, the most impressive element of the film is the tone, for which we can all thank David Fincher. Throughout the entirety of the film, even during the most benign scenes, I had this unsettling feeling in the pit of my stomach, as if I were constantly waiting for something horrific to happen. Fincher manages to maintain this disconcerting mood for the full length of the film without it ever becoming laboured or monotonous.\n\nFincher tends to reuse the same crew members on all of his films, including cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth, and composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The work of the latter is significant in supporting the eerie tone of the film, particularly in the choice to include unnerving mechanical sounds into the score. Cronenweth’s cinematography is very reminiscent of The Social Network with lots of dark, shadowy scenes lit in yellow, muddy tones that tend to make everyone look a little sickly, which of course works perfectly with the whole vibe of the film.\n\nEditors Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter, who is Australian, have also collaborated previously with Fincher, and have won Academy Awards for their work on The Social Network and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Wall is also the genius behind the epic opening credits sequences of HBO’s Game of Thrones. I would not be surprised if these two also find themselves nominated for their work on Gone Girl, as the editing in this film is absolutely outstanding. The dramatic cuts that abruptly end scenes create this fragmented feel, and yet, the editing still allows the film to flow seamlessly between the various time frames without becoming confusing, which sounds extremely contradictory, but somehow it works. There is nothing overtly spectacular about the editing, as in there are no flashy special effects that would rival the graphics in the Game of Thrones introduction, but it’s effectiveness is more in its subtlety.\n\nI would recommend Gone Girl to anyone who appreciates a solid psychological thriller, and as it kept me guessing the whole way through, I am rating it with 4 stars.\n\nImages courtesy of 20th Century Fox"
