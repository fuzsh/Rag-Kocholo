        "text": "Reasons For the Film’s Success\n\nDirectors and producers did not have high expectations for the film’s success during the filming process of Casablanca. Therefore, it was surprising to both producers and audiences that the film was an immediate hit. Released in 1942, the film is still memorable today and appreciated for its romantic yet relatable storyline. The talented cast is able to execute the script extremely well, making the entire film memorable and widely applauded. Casablanca is respected not only because it has garnered positive reviews throughout the decades, but also because of the films political background regarding WWII, it’s production history, and it’s ability to remain iconic across time.\n\nRenowned film critic, Roger Ebert, praises Casablanca in his review of the film, which focuses on the modern perspectives of the relatable romantic aspects of the screen-write. One of Ebert’s crucial points in his review picks up on the idea that no matter what decade we are in, audience members can always relate to an unattainable romance, making it adaptable to broader audiences and time frames. In real life, relationships almost never work out perfectly, especially when the counter part is already wed. This film gives a satisfying real-world illusion, allowing audience members to relate to the characters on a deeper, more personal level (Ebert, 1996).”\n\nCasablanca deviates from the typical romance film. Rather than nightclub owner, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), ceasing the opportunity to win his dream girl, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), he intentionally sends her off with husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) to further pursue their relationship. In genre films, protagonists often end up with exactly what they want. Casablanca stands out as a genre film because Blaine, the protagonist, does not end up with the woman he desires. Despite Casablanca taking the role of an untraditional genre film, audiences nonetheless appreciated the uniqueness and universal characteristics of the film. With lost love and longing being two evident parts of human experience, audience members watching the film are able to respect the unconventional production while relating to the character’s portrayal various emotions and romantic challenges. Other romantic films produced during the early 1940’s also contained flawed or failed romantic relationships, such as The Philadelphia Story, (1940) The Shop Around the Corner, (1940) and His Girl Friday (1940). While some films, like The Shop Around the Corner and Casablanca emphasize their plot set in the struggling times of World War II, only Casablanca focuses on a protagonist’s lost romance. Additionally, many films during this time were romantic comedies, setting Casablanca apart from traditional romance films during the 1940s.\n\nAside from the real-world love triangle, Variety Magazine published an article in 1942 that alluded to another idea of why Casablanca was such an immediate success. Following Marxist critique, this article suggests that one of the main attributes to the success of the film was the excessive amount of advertisement and build-up to the film. With directors and producers under the assumption that the film would be less than a hit, they made a spectacle of the film through heavy advertising. Phrases such as, “one of the most exciting films of the year,” (NYT) was used to excite people and make them believe this film is something to rave about when in reality, audiences may have reacted differently had they not been persuaded to make a spectacle of the film by advertisers (Variety, 1942). During World War II, a popular form of entertainment was going out to watch films\n\nUmberto Eco suggests in his article that Casablanca is a “cult film.” A cult film is a film with a strong fan-base that is able to identify with the film and express their knowingness of the film by quoting it, conducting studies, and identifying actors in the film. One of Casablanca’s most famous lines is spoken by Rick Blaine after he tells his lover, Ilsa Lund, to flee with her husband to continue their relationship. In this scene, Rick tells Ilsa, “maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life,” referring to her future regret if she chose to stay with Rick rather than going away with Victor, as he was encouraging her to (Eco, 1984). Cult fandom is important to the film’s longevity and because by constantly quoting, studying, and raising general knowledge of the film allows for decades.\n\nProduction History\n\nDuring the time of the film’s production, the Hollywood Studio System was in full swing. This meant that the completion of one movie meant the immediate start up of another and all aspects of the industry were controlled by a very limited number of studios in Los Angeles. Six other films were being shot at the same time as Casablanca at Warner Brothers Studio, and of those, Casablanca was not the most expensive, important or promising (Hamts, 2002). Casablanca’s iconic impact on film history was both unexpected and a shock to the producers responsible for it. The success of the film is owed to a series of happy accidents during its production. If they had not occurred, the film would not be what we know it as today.\n\nCasablanca began production in mid-May, and finished on August 3rd. The improvisation-type writing of the screenplay however, caused there to be pages of dialog still being turned in each day in July. This frustrated many of the actors, but if it were not shot in this way, the film and acting would have created a completely different film. (Encyclopedia Britanica, 2014). In fact, the actress playing Ilsa, Ingred Bergman, reportedly did not know which of the two leading men she was destined to end up with before the end of the film. (Wood, 2013). This clearly had an impact on the style of her acting if she believed that her character was going to be with Rick as opposed to Victor in the end. Warner Brothers was known as one of the most frugal studios at the time, and so it explains many of the choices for the actors and possibly the lax attitude of screenwriting. For example, Ingrid Bergman was originally not cast in the movie because Hal Wallis, the producer, wanted an actress named Michele Morgan to star in it instead. Morgan asked for $55,000 for the role, however, which was why Warner Brothers decided to drop her from the film and replace the role with Ingrid Bergman, a lesser known actress, who was willing to be paid a fraction of that salary- $25,000 (Harmets, 2002).\n\nThe film’s musical score could also be called accidental. Film composer Max Steiner wanted to replace “As Time Goes By,” the film’s major theme, with a different piece. It just so happened that by the time Steiner wanted to reshoot scenes with a different musical score, Ingrid Bergman had already been cast in a different movie, For Whom the Bell Tolls, where she had her hair cut in a different style and therefore could not re-film any material for Casablanca (Steiner, 2004). As time goes by is now a culturally iconic piece of music recognized for it’s affiliation with the film. If the song were replaced not only would the film be different due to it’s missing of that integral part of the ambiance, but the song itself wouldn’t hold as much meaning in society.\n\nAs much as Casablanca owes it’s lasting impact to the war going on at the time, WWII also caused several unexpected hiccups in the film’s production. The Screen Actors Guild was able to send over one thousand individuals who were used as extras in Warner Brother’s films off to fight against Germany in defense plants. (Archives for Casablanca, 2005). This meant that for Casablanca, the extras in the film had to be booked weeks in advanced whereas typically they were hired on the same day as filming. Again as a result of Warner Brother’s noted stinginess, the company would ensure that all of the extras they hired would work for a full hours and work as hard as possible. This meant that in several of the final cuts of the film, the same people playing extras are seen in different scenes at different times. There is an overlap because of the lack of available extras that is noticeable if the viewer looks closely enough at certain scenes like in Rick’s bar. (Harmetz, 2002.) Another effect of the war on Casablanca was that it was kept in theaters for a month whereas usually at this time, movies were only played for about a week. This meant that a wider audience got to experience the movie in theaters and they appreciated it even more because of its connection to the war that was relatable at the time. The longer period in theaters also gave viewers a chance to express to their friends how much they enjoyed it, and expand the audience in that way. (Wood, 2013). With movie tickets averaging 75 cents at this time (Archives for Casablanca, 2005), this increased the profits of the film immensely as well.\n\nHistorical Influence\n\nThere were various factors that were taken into consideration during the production of this ﬁlm. Casablanca’s production was inﬂuenced by social, economic and political factors. Casanblanca is also seen as a political allegory. During the time that the ﬁlm was being produced, history was being made as WWII raged on. It is thought that many aspects of this ﬁlm were directly related to the political decisions of the time. This movie was dubbed by Richard Armstrong as a “political propaganda” that came out months before the Allied forces took North Africa from the enemy in November of 1942. The ﬁlm takes place in Morocco which is depicted as a heaven in a world ﬁlled with war. The writers from Warner Brothers would change the script sometimes daily depending on what was currently happening in the war. Upon the release of the ﬁlm, the government realized that they could gain more support from the American people to ﬁght in WWII (Armstrong, 2007).\n\nCharacters in Casablanca are thought to relate directly to real life people and their decisions. Scholars describe Rick, the main character in Casablanca, to be important in depicting President Roosevelt. Rick parallels Roosevelt’s initial lack of involvement in the war just as Rick stood around versus taking action. Then just as Roosevelt was eventually forced to step in, so does Rick in Casablanca. Both men commit to helping the cause whole heartedly. Viewers see Rick’s lack of involvement when a man at his bar is arrested and his disinterest in helping him. However, we see a complete ﬂip when the love of his life, Ilsa, come back. Rick throws himself into helping her reach safety no matter what he has to sacriﬁce himself. Thus Rick’s eventual change of heart directly represents the U.S. involvement in WWII (Raskin, 1990). Those high ofﬁcials who were aware of President Roosevelt’s upcoming secret trip to Casablanca found this movie slightly comical when Roosevelt decided to show it at his Christmas party that year (Raskin, 1990). No one else in the world except for those men at the party new about the upcoming trip therefore the timing of the movie everyone thought was remarkably coincidental. These secret meetings dispersed throughout the time period of the war were vital to the Allied forces winning.\n\nAt the Casablanca Conference it was discussed whether to spread out forces to Japan or to continue to concentrate all efforts on beating the Third Reich. Though this ﬁlm came out prior to the conference the location was remarkably uncanny. It was established that all efforts would be put against the Third Reich and once the Allied forces were in good standing in Europe they would send forces to attack Japan (Miller). This would not have been done if there were not immense technological advancements at this time.\n\nIn terms of technological advancements in WWII, this war was considered middle level warfare where inventors, scientists, civil servants, etc. make huge advancements. Middle level warfare, primarily seen between 1943 and 1944, had three steps: the problem, the solution, and using the solution to ﬁx the problem. The Allied forces needed to dominate the skies but had no way to do so because their planes were not powerful enough. Thus the P-51 was made with Rolls Royce engines and it became the highest ﬂying plane in the sky. Viewers see the representation of these technological advancements in the ending of the movie as Ilsa and her husband take off in a plane headed for the United States. In order to stop the onslaught of U-Boats, radar was invented and Allied forces were slowly able to take over the seas again. These are a few examples of the technological improvements made during the time that Casablanca was released (Kennedy).\n\nCasablanca in Film History\n\n“Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship”. Much like the final line of Casablanca marked the start of Louis and Rick’s friendship, these iconic words marked the beginning of America’s love affair with Casablanca. Released over 70 years ago, Casablanca has remained a relevant fixture in the Western canon since its release. Whether it is through parodies, pop culture pastiche, or everyday references, Casablanca is consistently one of the most commonly referenced films in Hollywood history. Part of Casablanca’s impact comes from the accessible style of the film that lends itself to easy parody. The dramatic formal elements of film noir, the beloved theme tune of Dooley Wilson’s “As Time Goes By”, and the status of Casablanca as one of histories greatest films all create the perfect atmosphere for modern media texts to reference.\n\nOne of the greatest feats of Casablanca is that it is “…very much a product of its time and is very much a product of all time.” (Jackson, 2000) Much of the story is reliant on the current political and social norms of the time (for example, the backdrop of World War II); yet, the themes (such as love, sacrifice, and the morality of law) withstand the test of time and are relatable to generations of audiences. An example of Casablanca being a product of its time is how emblematic it is of the Hollywood Golden Age. Starring screen legends Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman and produced by powerhouse Warner Bros. Studios, Casablanca went on to win three Academy Awards: all being elements of a standard, studio film. It is, essentially, “…the epitome of the Hollywood studio film-a melodramatic, topical story…Despite its formulaic elements…Casablanca is a masterpiece of American filmmaking.” (Murray, 2005) People find comfort in the familiarity of the classic stylistic elements found in Casablanca, and in turn can better relate to the characters and story. The fact that Casablanca is ‘a product of its time’ is part of what makes the film so iconic; it crystallizes and preserves a unique moment in American film history, and each viewing of the film allows us to travel back to that moment and experience the magic once more.\n\nAn instance of Casablanca being a ‘product of all time’ would be the prevalence of its dialogue, in particular, popular culture. It would be near impossible to capture every reference to Casablanca in media texts since its release, but one of the most notable ones is Woody Allen’s film and stage productions of ‘Play It Again, Sam’. Following a neurotic mans obsession with Casablanca and it’s hero, Rick Blain; ‘Play It Again, Sam’ reaffirms the iconic status of Casablanca. By borrowing its title from one of the films most famous lines, Woody Allen plays to the audiences assumed knowledge of Casablanca to lay the base for his production. The dialogue is arguably the most iconic element of Casablanca, as the lines spoken by the characters (most often Rick) are still common in media texts and conversation to this day. In this sense Casablanca has transcended the realm of film and has reached legendary status, as its dialogue achieves the rare feat of being commonplace in Americana. Though the adapted script for Casablanca was rewritten to the point of still being incomplete upon the first day of filming, the playfully cynical tone juxtaposed with the timeless romantic themes allowed Casablanca to become revered for its wonderful dialogue. Casablanca perhaps remains rooted as one of history’s most iconic and beloved films due not only to the stand alone quality of the script, but to the ease in which the script continuously lends itself to references, as time goes by."
