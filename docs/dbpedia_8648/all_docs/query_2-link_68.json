        "text": "B.J. Novak made his directorial debut during the sixth season of The Office. An original writer, producer and star on the beloved sitcom, he first helmed the 2009 episode \"Scott's Tots\" (an instant classic), followed by additional episodes of The Office, then The Mindy Project, and then, The Premise, the Hulu anthology series that Novak created. But he always knew he wanted to be a filmmaker.\n\nNovak's debut as a feature director and screenwriter is Vengeance, in which he plays an aspiring podcaster who travels from New York to small-town Texas to attend the funeral of a woman he'd been hooking up with, only to stumble headfirst into a potential murder mystery — and the perfect story for a podcast. The movie combines some of the cringe comedy of The Office with thriller elements inspired by his own directing idols.\n\n\"All of these movies that I love, I love because they taught me what was possible,\" Novak says. \"I think the lesson I learn from every film is what is possible — and the answer is anything. You just have to always do your best to live up to it.\""
