        "text": "Another in our bi-weekly series in which we analyze movies currently in release. Why? To quote the writing mantra I coined over 5 years ago: Watch movies. Read scripts. Write pages. You will note which one comes first. Here are my reflections from that post about the importance of watching movies:\n\nTo be a good screenwriter, you need to have a broad exposure to the world of film. Every movie you see is a potential reference point for your writing, everything from story concepts you generate to characters you develop to scenes you construct. Moreover people who work in the movie business constantly reference existing movies when discussing stories you write; it’s a shorthand way of getting across what they mean or envision.\n\nBut most importantly, you need to watch movies in order to ‘get’ how movie stories work. If you immerse yourself in the world of film, it’s like a Gestalt experience where you begin to grasp intuitively scene composition, story structure, character functions, dialogue and subtext, transitions and pacing, and so on.\n\nLet me add this: It’s important to see movies as they get released so that you stay on top of the business. Decisions get made in Hollywood in large part depending upon how movies perform, so watching movies as they come out puts you in the same head space as reps, producers, execs, and buyers.\n\nThis week’s movie: Casablanca, screenplay by Julius J. Epstein & Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koch.\n\nIMDb plot summary: Set in Casablanca, Morocco during the early days of World War II: An American expatriate meets a former lover, with unforeseen complications.\n\nOur schedule for discussion this week:\n\nMonday: General Comments\n\nTuesday: Plot\n\nWednesday: Characters\n\nThursday: Themes\n\nFriday: Takeaways\n\nFor those of you who have not seen the movie, do not click MORE as we will be trafficking in major spoilers. But seriously, if you haven’t seen Casablanca, stop whatever you’re doing and watch it! If you have seen Casablanca, I invite you to join me in breaking down and analyzing the movie.\n\nSo many takeaways from this movie. Let me start things out with a seemingly minor, but telling bit of craft from the filmmakers: While the main characters are well-drawn as distinct individuals, so, too, the secondary characters. Here are some of them:\n\nSignor Ferrari\n\n“Might as well be frank, monsieur.\n\nIt would take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca,\n\nand the Germans have outlawed miracles.”\n\nUgarte\n\n“Rick! Rick! Hide me, Rick!”\n\nCarl\n\n“I have already given him the best,\n\nknowing he is German and would take it anyway.”\n\nYvonne and Sascha\n\nYvonne: Don’t listen to him, Sascha. Fill it up!\n\nSascha: Yvonne, I loff you, but he pays me.\n\nAnd of course…\n\nSam\n\nSam: Boss, ain’t you going to bed?\n\nRick: Not right now.\n\nSam: Ain’t you planning on going to bed in the near future?\n\nRick: No.\n\nSam: You ever going to bed?\n\nRick: No!\n\nSam: Well, I ain’t sleepy either.\n\nEach of these characters is distinct. Each is memorable. Each has their own subplot. Each has some notable dialogue. And each is entertaining.\n\nTakeaway: In every script we write, we should strive to make all characters well-drawn ones, even the secondary characters."
