        "text": "What happens to a few little screenplays in this crazy world may not amount to a hill of beans, but the people who write them have now come up with what they reckon are the finest ones of all time.\n\nLike every list, it will make some people mad as hell and make them feel that they're not going to take it any more. But here's looking at the top 101 screenplays in the opinion of the trade.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America yesterday published the results of a poll of its members to find the elusive finest screenplay in film history. It will come as no surprise that Casablanca - most quoted (and misquoted) film of all time - should be up there at No 1. But some other choices will raise eyebrows as high as Groucho's in his role as president of Fredonia in Duck Soup, which, puzzlingly, does not make the cut, presumably an early victim of the avian flu scare.\n\nScreenwriters are often forgotten heroes of the film trade, toiling anonymously only to see actors and directors getting the credit. After all, how many people who can do bad imitations of Humphrey Bogart instructing Sam to play As Time Goes By in Casablanca would be able to name Julius J and Philip G Epstein and Howard Koch as its authors?\n\nThe new list is an attempt to honour those sometimes neglected members of the industry. The choices from the 9,500-strong WGA membership follow fairly predictable paths. Citizen Kane, a couple of Godfathers, Some Like It Hot and Chinatown are all in the top 10. But there are also more recent and small-budget selections. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind by Charlie Kaufman makes it to 24 and Alan Ball's American Beauty to 38. Sideways, the 2004 comedy about wine and love by Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor, is at 90.\n\nFour of the films of Woody Allen - Annie Hall, Manhattan, Crimes and Misdemeanours and Hannah and Her Sisters - are listed. Francis (Ford) Coppola, who collaborated with Mario Puzo on the Godfather trilogy and also worked on Patton and Apocalypse Now, gets four mentions, too. William Goldman, who wrote what some believe to be the definitive work on screenwriting, Adventures in the Screen Trade, has three listed films (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, All the President's Men and The Princess Bride.)\n\nThree blacklisted writers are honoured, including Waldo Salt, for Midnight Cowboy, as are four sets of brothers, including Joel andEthan Coen with Fargo at 32. Almost all nominees are male, although Callie Khouri's Thelma and Louise (72) and Nora Ephron's When Harry Met Sally (40) feature.\n\nMost names are American, although British writing talent wins recognition in the shape of Robert Bolt (Lawrence of Arabia, 14) Tom Stoppard (Shakespeare in Love, 28) and Graham Greene, whose The Third Man comes in, confusingly, 33rd. Peter Shaffer's Amadeus is at 73.\n\nWhat is the magic ingredient? Julius Epstein, who co-wrote Casablanca, once suggested the screenplay contained \"more corn than the states of Kansas and Iowa combined\". But many of the scripts chosen had at their hearts a great novel or true story.\n\nThere will, inevitably, be arguments. The authors of classic Marx Brothers scripts, surveying the list from wherever they are now cracking gags, might wonder how, say, Field of Dreams made it into the top 101 when their work did not. More than likely their response will be contained in the words of the screenplay placed at number 23: \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\""
