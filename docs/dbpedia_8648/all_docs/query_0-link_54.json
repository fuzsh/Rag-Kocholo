        "text": "If movies are to be considered a form of therapy, then Casablanca is Freud. As pretentious as I’m sure that, or any reference to Freud may sound, please refrain from putting this [hopefully] stapled stack of papers down for a few minuets and allow me to explain what exactly I mean. To do this, I will need to explore a few key concepts. The first, naturally, would consist of my subjective definition of the term ‘therapy’. In this, and most cases, my use of somewhat intentionally exaggerated subjectivity is not meant to show an ambivalence towards objective fact, but rather to emphasize how the truth behind why Casablanca has achieved such an astronomical replay value, is one that is simultaneously personal and general. Carl Jung expounded on such a phenomena in his theories regarding the collective unconscious many years ago, but on a less scientific level, what I am referring to can more easily be understood as the very foundation of actions and circumstances that govern the emotional world we have all created for ourselves. Some of which we have a more active role in determining, and some of which we inherit with the gift of consciousness. So when I refer to something as being ‘therapeutic’, I am alluding to its ability to isolate the specific feelings that contribute to our individual emotional states and counter those notions with the appropriate relational anecdote. For example, most negative emotional states we experience, come from an underlying feeling of loneliness. Which is why, during this state, hearing a song or watching a movie that expresses a similar outlook or situation to the one which we are currently experiencing, whether it provides solution or indulgence, gives us the reassurance that somebody, somewhere is feeling or has felt the same thing we are. It as a very simple action that taps into a most basic human need, and more often than not, is all that is necessary to provide a sense of hope. Emotional hardships are never easy, but they are without a doubt more difficult to deal with on your own. In order for a film to effectively enter this realm of therapy, it has to successfully find a balance between reality and fantasy. Too much of one, will either leave the viewer feeling hopeless or unable to relate. Parallel to the Italian Neo-Realist movement occurring at around the same time, which portrayed a much darker, defeated portrait of authenticity, it would appear that Casablanca is one of the first movies to express this sense of hopeful reality to an American audience.\n\nThere were many things I noticed during viewings of Casablanca, that I felt must have played into its myth like status. The one thing I had trouble grasping, was the level of intention at play. I knew Curtiz and the Epsteins couldn’t have possibly set out to make a movie that would reach the heights it did, because frankly, I had seen much better movies. As Umberto Eco said in his analysis, “Nobody would have been able to achieve such a cosmic result intentionally. Nature has spoken in place of men. This, alone is a phenomenon worthy of veneration.” So if its success cannot be attributed to those that created it, what force of circumstance is responsible for such a meteoric rise? Before I delved deeper into the subject, I imagined the phenomenon that could explain the cult of Casablanca was similar to that of the Rockefeller Rothko. This specific Rothko, otherwise known as White Center, not only comes to mind because of its record breaking sale in 2007 for 72.84 million (USD), but more importantly, how its name is used to justify such a hefty price tag. At first glance White Center does not strike you as a particularly special Rothko, but what you can’t see from staring at the five or so colors present in the work, are the years they spent sitting above the desk of notorious billionaire banker and art enthusiast David Rockefeller. This simple fact is the only reason why White Center is valued above all other works by Rothko, and why when referring to the piece, Rockefeller’s name is often placed before that of the artist who painted it. This sent me on a journey to find Casablanca’s Rockefeller equivalent. What set of outside, unintended circumstances could be held accountable? What I found upon investigation was that while indeed unintended, the unique elements at play were put into motion far before it was received by the public.\n\nDescribing the mood on the set, Eco recalled that, “According to Ingrid Bergman, the film was apparently being made up at the same time that it was being shot. Until the last moment not even Michael Curtiz knew whether Ilsa would leave with Rick or with Victor, and Ingrid Bergman seems so fascinatingly mysterious because she did not know at which man she was to look with great tenderness”. In regard to shooting schedules, what Eco is referring to, was a product of a last minuet production. But what unintentionally came out of this was a dose of imperfect, authentic reality, manifested in a convincing performance by Bergman. A performance which mirrored the uncertainty of life. This must have subconsciously resonated with the audience in a way that was unique, set against the backdrop of the exaggeratedly contrived acting of the time. The reality of Bergman’s performance, goes one step further into immersing us into the situations of the film. We are in a noticeably contrived world, bearing witness to genuine emotions, and its that very legitimacy that keeps us from floating away into a world of pure fantasy. The balance keeps our perception of what we are viewing rooted in a relational projection of our personal experiences.\n\nThis subtle imperfection is key to the timeless success of Casablanca, as “a perfect movie, since it cannot be reread every time we want, from the point we choose, as happens with a book, remains in our memory as a whole, in the form of a central idea or emotion; only an unhinged movie survives as a disconnected series of images, of peaks, of visual icebergs. It should display not one central idea but many. It should not reveal a coherent philosophy of composition. It must live on, and because of, its glorious ricketiness. […] Thus one is tempted to read Casablanca as T. S. Eliot read Hamlet, attributing its fascination not to the fact that it was a successful work (actually he considered it one of Shakespeare’s less fortunate efforts) but to the imperfection of its composition. […] So both public and critics find Hamlet beautiful because it is interesting, but believe it is interesting because it is beautiful.” All during the production, Curtiz and his team were making key moves in a game they were unaware they were playing. One of the many over abundant archetypes could remind you of key figure in your own life, just as you could subconsciously relate an abrupt cut, to a spouses sudden mood swing.\n\nTo say the stars aligned for moments like this would be an understatement. Whether Curtiz knowingly set out for perfection I cannot say, [although I imagine he viewed it as not much more than another of the many films he would produce year after year] but what was born was something much more. Something that transcended the faulted prison of perfection, a concept that would be masterfully explored years later in Ingmar Bergman’s Scenes from a Marriage, that caged so many of early Hollywood’s theatrical attempts. Suspended in the extreme side of the spectrum, movies that lost their reality, alienated themselves from their audience, ultimately taking away from the very fantasy they were trying to create.\n\nWhen I was a child, there was no thought that scared me more than the idea of Heaven, as it had been described to me on countless Sunday mornings. Trying to conceptualize eternity aside, the thought of a so called perfect place, completely lacking in conflict sounded much more like purgatory than an ideal. How long would it take me to get bored of all the things I love to do? And what of love itself? How can love exist in a perfect world? My conclusion was that love can only exist in a perfect world, but in order to further our understanding we needed to stop using perfect as a synonym for sterile. True perfection is a balance; a balance of love with just enough pain to make it real. Much of this may seem very obvious to us now, but that fact in itself is owed to how far ahead of 1942 Casablanca really was. By spontaneously anticipating the future of cinema, Curiz and crew were able to prepare their little love story for a modern audience that would continue to appreciate and respond to their work as more than just historic document.\n\nWhen I watched Casablanca in the beginning of the semester, the viewing, which wasn’t my first, left quite a personal impression upon me. I was intrigued at how it flowed in a way that seemed to invite play after play without losing any of its initial thrills. Because after all, we all know what happens at the end, yet that doesn’t change the rush of the ride. In 1985 Stevie Wonder released Overjoyed, which would eventually be destined to become one of my favorite songs. Over the years, I was always amazed at how often I would hear this specific song used in films and shows during happy, love filled moments. This was odd to me, because when you listen to the lyrics of the song, they are actually quite sad. He was speaking the whole time of a one sided, unrealized love, but he was doing so over a melody and chord structure that traditionally is used to evoke feelings of happiness. I believe it is that awareness of the duality of such a situation that gives Overjoyed such potent relevancy in my life. And while the song lasts mere minuets, when watching Casablanca I felt as though I could experience that very same duality for hours. Aside from all the technical elements which I have discussed thus far that play into this achievement, Casablanca is able to sustain this feat because it is presented as a purely emotional experience.\n\nAs in every artistic discipline, a work of cinema is pulled either in the direction of intellect or emotion. Some attempting to toe the lines between, others choosing a lane and diving in head first. The two directors of the French New Wave, Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut, can be thought of as perfect personifications of these two respective sides of the coin. On one hand you have Godard, who’s main focus is that of thought and technical achievement, many times at the expense of a linear storyline. And on the other you have Truffaut, who’s goal is first and foremost to communicate a strong emotional narrative. More simply put, Godard wants you to think; Truffaut wants you to feel [and it is important to note that those two ideas do not go hand in hand]. While I love and appreciate the films of Godard, I personally find myself watching and reading the works of Truffaut on a much more regular basis, and I believe that has everything to do with his emphasis on emotion. Another comparison would be that of a novel and a poem. A lifetime of love versus an hour of passion. Filled with sentiment and stripped of intellect, the film enters the world of song, experiencing a replay value not otherwise possible.\n\nWho know’s, maybe this subtle influence of song was one of the intentional marks of Curtiz. As Aljean Harmetz would go on to say, “The song is a main character, not mere music […] it functions in the plot. And, to some extent, it implies humility in a world thrown out of kilter.” In this regard, it appears that they could have indeed been aware of the subconscious power of music, and more importantly, how to structure the context of songs to emphasize the duality of a given situation. This can be seen “During one minute and forty-six seconds of underscoring, when Rick is saying goodbye to Ilsa, [and] ‘As Time Goes By’ is transformed emotionally from a tone of tragic loss to romantic love to bittersweet resignation to a tragic and final climax as Ilsa and Laszlo turn their backs and walk toward the Lisbon plane.”\n\nIt is the accurate portrayal of this phenomenon that would come to attract one of film histories most notable neurotics, and master of duality in his own right; Woody Allen. Depressing themes dealt with in humor have become something of an omnipresent theme in his work, and when he isn’t referencing Casablanca directly as he does in Play It Again, Sam, he is functioning as a self aware evolution of the aesthetic ideas. If Casablanca is ‘movies’, instead of simply a singular movie; then Annie Hall is not one love story, but all love stories. In Play It Again, Sam he brought it up, but with Annie Hall he brought it home. If you were to play the endings of both films back to back, what you would find is the same conclusion, some 35 years apart. First you have Bergman not ending up with Bogart, then you have Keiten not taking back Allen. But despite the lead not getting the girl, they both end on the same hopeful note. On the landing strip, Ilsa and Rick part ways as she walks towards the plane and he, after watching the plane make its departure, strolls into the night with Renault. Then on the corner of 68th, Annie and Allen say a friendly goodbye before she crosses the street, leaving the frame as Allen stands watching for a moment before slowly turning and exiting in the opposite direction. For Bogart, it is the start of a beautiful friendship, and for Allen, the start of a new relationship and realizing why we all “need the eggs”. Neither may have gotten the classic Hollywood ending, but 9 times out of 10 that ending doesn’t exist. And all 9 times, you’ll survive. For the same reasons Casablanca was revolutionary in 1942; Annie Hall was in 1977.\n\nWhile the reality of films allow us to relate, the fantasy is what keeps us coming back. As Marc Auge said in his essay on Movies and Memory, “ The miracle of cinema is that I don’t imagine this image, I see it. […] To see a film again is to recover a past that retains all the vivacity of the present.” I was recently watching a documentary about virtual reality and a very interesting segment came on which went into great detail about how the technology of VR helmets is able to tap into the way we perceive reality, in order to reach new levels of immersion. They tested this by putting a subject on a virtual roller coaster and monitoring their vital signs as they experienced the ride. What they found was that right before the first large plunge, when you look down and your stomach drops, the individual’s body reacted as if they were actually on a ride. This brings up the very interesting question of what constitutes something as ‘real’. Another study done for BBC noted that all the things we perceive as consciousness, are just our brain processing a series of reactions. To this extent, anything processed by the brain in that way could be consider by effect ‘real’. But how can something virtual be real? Very simply, in order for you to understand how something could be considered real, the first thing you need to do is throw away the idea that it needs to be tangible. Most often, the very things we are unable to touch are also the most awe inspiring. Those things we know to be true, but cannot explain.\n\nIt is in this same vein that movies hold their true value. They can put us in the front seat on the roller coaster of a love affair, and just like in VR, this experience extends past the realm of pure imagination. You feel real love when Rick and Ilsa are in Paris, real betrayal when she doesn’t show up at the train station, real loss when she is forced to leave with Laszlo and real hope as Rick and Renault walk off into the night. But the real therapy of Casablanca lies in your ability to do at the credits what you wish you could at the end of every so called ‘real’ love affair; play it again.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAugé, Marc.
