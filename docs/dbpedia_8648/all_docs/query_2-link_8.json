        "text": "After the death of his twin brother in 1952, Epstein found working with a collaborator near impossible. He tried working with Billy Wilder three times, but nothing came of it.\n\nThe Epstein twins enjoyed a well-earned reputation, not only for writing witty dialogue, but also for coming up with the best impromptu wisecracks in the movie business.\n\nWoody Allen paid tribute to Epstein by using the name in two of his movies, once as character's license plate and in another as a character.\n\n[)n 'Casablanca', 1984] \"Just a routine assignment. Frankly, I can't understand it's staying power. If it were made today, line for line, each performance as good, it'd be laughed off the screen. It's such a phony picture. Not a word of truth in it. It's camp, kitsch. it's just...slick shit!\"\n\nOne of the wonderful things about working at Warners was the wealth of character actors a screenwriter could draw on. It was the greatest stock company going. Lots of times we didn't know who the leads were going to be, but often we'd write scripts with specific character actors in mind. We knew who was under contract - Frank McHugh, S.Z. Sakall, Hugh Herbert, Allen Jenkins, Ruth Donnelly - and we kept them in mind."
