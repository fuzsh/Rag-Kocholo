        "text": "I love lists. I also realize that, when it comes to ranking films, lists can be somewhat silly. I mean, how can you rank a comedy as compared to a heavy drama? But hey, I can't help that my brain works this way. I actually keep a running list on my phone of my 100 favorite films, and the list is constantly changing. I decided that, rather than keep it to myself, I should share it with you. So, over the next few weeks, I'll be posting my 100 favorite films of all time. I started this last year, and you can find last year’s version by heading over to my Movie Journal. On this year’s edition, I’ll make a note of where each film showed up the previous year (HM stands for Honorable Mention and NR stands for Not Ranked).\n\nThey'll come in increments of 25, with this post featuring numbers 50-26. Keep in mind a few things: 1) these are my personal favorites, so I'm not saying these are the 100 objectively best films ever made and 2) I am not giving a blanket recommendation for every film on this list. You should certainly keep in mind age and content maturity when viewing some of these films (for more info on that, check out this post). Also, this series will only focus on feature films, so you won't see any documentaries. Finally, for any films that I have previously reviewed, there will be a button below each title for you to click through to the original review. My plan is to post this series every year to see how my rankings have changed. But enough intro, let's get to the list! Here are numbers 50-26...\n\n49. L.A. Confidential - Curtis Hanson (1997) This film has to be on the shortlist for the greatest screenplays ever written. Its plot is labyrinthine and populated my many intriguing characters, but it never careens out of control. That is because the script gives us just the right information exactly when we need it. Specifically, this film does an incredible job of always keeping the intentions of its characters in mind. When characters make a decision, we understand why they did that. At the same time, the plot still manages to throw us for some major loops at times. This is a hard-boiled detective story and a seedy tale of corruption all rolled into one. The acting performances are pristine, particularly from Kim Basinger as the femme fatale Lynn Bracken. She won an Oscar for her performance, and it was well-deserved. She subverts many of the tropes of the typical femme fatale role by showing vulnerability and compassion and ultimately being an active agent in helping our protagonists achieve their goals. This is a fantastic noir that is endlessly re-watchable. It also should have won Best Picture at the 1998 Oscars (sorry, Titanic fans). Last year’s ranking - #39\n\n48. Inside Llewyn Davis - Joel and Ethan Coen (2013) Talk about incredible movie music! Here, not only is the film populated by many classic folk songs from the era just before Bob Dylan, but the music used in the film was all recorded live on set. And lead actor Oscar Isaac did not have someone else provide the vocals for him. No, he acted and sang as lead character Llewyn Davis in the film. Aside from the incredible production that this film was, the story is also riveting. It shows that talent alone is not enough. The road to stardom is dotted with many talented folks who simply never made it. From a technical standpoint, the direction and writing from the Coens are obviously stellar. But I must also call out the cinematography from Bruno Delbonnel. This film looks much different than other Coen Brothers' films, but that is a testament to how Delbonnel brings his own artistic touch into the story. His work perfectly captures the dinginess of the film's settings and the longing inside Llewyn Davis. Last year’s ranking - #35\n\n47. La La Land - Damien Chazelle (2016) This film is right near the top on my list of favorite movie music. I listen to the music from this film often. In fact, it pops in my head randomly throughout the day. I absolutely love it! But it's more than just music. There is a powerful story here about the rightful place that dreams should take in our lives. The cinematography is incredible (though there is a film later on in my list that I think should have gotten the Oscar instead of this film), and the direction is fantastic. Couple that with an incredible performance by Emma Stone, and there's more than enough reason to overlook Ryan Gosling's less-than-stellar singing. Oh, and I could watch the Griffith Observatory scene on a loop for the rest of my life if I had to. Last year’s ranking - #37\n\n46. Phantom Thread - Paul Thomas Anderson (2017) There's so much I love about this film, but I must first start with the score. The music here from Jonny Greenwood is so lush and evocative. It is one of the most beautiful film scores I've ever heard, and I think it should have won the Oscar for Best Score in 2017. Then you have what may be the final performance by the greatest actor of his generation and, possibly, of all time. Daniel Day-Lewis is incredible here, but...dare I say it...I don't think he gives the best performance in the film. Relative newcomer Vicky Krieps absolutely shines as Alma, the muse and love interest of fashion designer Reynolds Woodcock (Day-Lewis). Lesley Manville also gives a fantastic performance as Reynolds' sister, Cyril, but it is Krieps that takes her character on an incredible journey in the film. She comes to dominate the story despite the commanding presence of Day-Lewis. This is a dark film, but it is also incredibly funny at times. It was my favorite film of 2017, and it continues to beguile me. Last year’s ranking - #40\n\n45. Singin' in the Rain - Stanley Donen, Gene Kelly (1952) When you hear Gene Kelly start humming as he walks out into the rain in that iconic scene, you can't help but sing along. There's no other way to describe this movie except to say that it is absolutely magical. The musical numbers are some of the most classic that Hollywood has ever created, and the performances are endearing. It's also a fascinating look at a time of great change in Hollywood - the advent of \"talkies\" and the move away from silent pictures. The cinematography and the choreography work together so well and create a magical world that sucks us right in. There's a reason this film is so universally praised. \"What a glorious feelin' I'm happy again.\" Last year’s ranking - #43\n\n44. Some Like it Hot - Billy Wilder (1959) Hilarous, absolutely hilarious. I've already discussed my love for Billy Wilder's writing and Jack Lemmon's acting, and the two combine perfectly once again in this film. Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe give fine performances as well, but it is Wilder's writing that takes center stage. Set aside for a second the closing line (which must obviously be one of the most famous ever written), the film as a whole is an incredibly-intricate farce. I mentioned earlier in my list how well the film Mrs. Doubtfire plays juxtaposition for laughs, but the trick was initiated here. In fact, I highly doubt that a film like Mrs. Doubtfire would have been made if not for this comedy classic. You can try to top it, but you probably won't succeed. But, hey, nobody's perfect. Last year’s ranking - #42\n\n43. Whiplash - Damien Chazelle (2014) Rushing or dragging? Talk about an unforgettable performance! Once you've seen J.K. Simmons in this role, you will. not. forget. it. This has to be one of my favorite acting performances ever. Thankfully, he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his work here. Rightfully so. He dominates the film as Fletcher, the music teacher to Andrew (Miles Teller). Here is a story about obsession and work ethic. If you've been given a great talent, how are you supposed to go about developing it? Is that better achieved through tender love, or through grueling repetition? I think this film has a lot to say there, and I think we're left to consider the ramifications. Along the way, we're treated to some of the best movie music there is. I think this film is best summed up by letting a quote from Fletcher take the stage. \"There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job.'\" Last year’s ranking - #29\n\n42. Strangers on a Train - Alfred Hitchcock (1951) My first time seeing this Hitchcock classic remains one of my favorite moviegoing experiences. I saw it with my wife and my mother at the delightful Artcraft Theater in Franklin, Indiana. It was like going back in time with old-time popcorn machines and the small town feel. Into that quaint setting sprang this firecracker of a film. You must begin by talking about Robert Walker’s incredible performance as the villanous, Bruno Antony. Here also is possibly Hitchcock’s best example of the theme that shows up often in his films - the attempt to plan the perfect murder. This film is taught and thrilling and is very nearly the best film from the man that many consider to be the greatest director to ever live. Last year’s ranking - NR\n\n41. The Big Lebowski - Joel and Ethan Coen (1998) Name me a better character than \"The Dude\" (Jeff Bridges). Go ahead, name one. You can't, right? The Dude abides. This is a perfect example of writing and acting coming together to form something more. Certainly, The Dude is a masterfully-written character. But that writing would not have come across so well without the one-of-a-kind performance by Bridges. This film is also a wonder because it really doesn't have a coherent plot. You try to go out and write a film about an unemployed stoner with no plot and have it become a cult classic. How did the Coens do it? Well - \"Sometimes, there's a man, well, he's the man for his time and place. He fits right in there. And that's the Dude...\" They did it with great characters and some of the most quotable dialogue ever written. Oh and it helps when your film spawns conspiracy theories that launch it into cult status. Nobody besides the Coens could have written this film. It's an incredible achievement. And all I can do is echo what The Stranger (Sam Elliott) says near the end of the film. \"I don't know about you but I take comfort in that. It's good knowin' he's out there. The Dude. Takin' 'er easy for all us sinners.\" Last year’s ranking - #33\n\n40. The Parent Trap - Nancy Meyers (1998) Maybe it was inevitable for this film to slip a little bit in my rankings. Sometimes nostalgia wears off. But here’s the thing - even when the nostalgia wears off - this is still an undeniably great film. I remember revisiting this film in college for the first time in years. I was wowed by the fact that I loved it just as much if not more as an adult. Say what you will about Lindsay Lohan, but this film shows her incredible talent. At a young age, she played two different characters with two different accents. Not only that, but when the girls pull their switcheroo, she had to augment those accents slightly since she was now playing someone who was playing someone else. I also love the soundtrack to this film. It all works for me. This will forever be a favorite of mine. I also reviewed this film for InSession Film. Last year’s ranking - #26\n\n38. Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope - George Lucas (1977) It spawned the greatest cultural phenomenon of our time. From the films themselves to the toys, the costumes and now the theme parks, Star Wars is ubiquitous. Think about the massive achievement it is to create something that spawns so much love and fanatic affection. George Lucas is certainly a visionary, and his use of special effects in this film impacted filmmaking in ways that are still being felt. Would there even be a Marvel Cinematic Universe if not for the success of Star Wars? Even the notion a blockbuster was shaped by this and the release of Jaws just a few years earlier. The characters are incredible, and the storyline is classic. It took influences from Stanley Kubrick and Akira Kurosawa and made something entirely new and groundbreaking. And we're still talking about it today. Last year’s ranking - #31\n\n37. Spotlight - Tom McCarthy (2015) What an incredible ensemble cast this film has! Mark Ruffalo turns in a career performance as journalist Mike Rezendes. John Slattery is a favorite of mine, Liev Schreiber has an understated brilliance, Stanley Tucci is (as usual) a scene-stealer, and Rachel MacAdams gives the best performance of her fantastic career. Despite its difficult subject matter, I find this film incredibly rewatchable. That is a testament to the script by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer, who is one of my favorite writers thanks to his work here and on The West Wing. The film is so taut, moving along at a pace that you might not associate with a movie that focuses so much on stuffy newspaper offices and even spreadsheets. The writers won Best Original Screenplay at that year’s Oscars, and I think it was well-deserved. In fact, I think this is one of the greatest screenplays of all time. Last year’s ranking - #22\n\n36. Fargo - Joel and Ethan Coen (1996) This 1996 crime caper certainly falls into that category. Everyone starts by talking about the Minnesotan dialect and accents, but that is such a key element of the film. The Coens are always masters of rooting their stories in a place, and this may just be the best example of that. We wonder how such horrible things can happen in such a nice place and to such nice people. But those things do happen, and every day. I feel like I keep saying this every time a Coen Brothers movie comes up on this list, but its true - they simply create incredible characters. Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is one of the most memorable characters of recent movie history. Fargo has so captivated audiences that is has even now been turned into a major television series. When your story has staying power like that, you know you've got something good. I also reviewed this film for Filmotomy's series on Joel and Ethan Coen. Last year’s ranking - #27\n\n35. Inglourious Basterds - Quentin Tarantino (2009) This is my favorite Tarantino film, and it shot up the rankings this year. It is the only Tarantino film to show up in my Top 100. That is mainly due to the power of two scenes, in particular, though the film as a whole is stellar. From the very title (which Tarantino intentionally misspelled) you know this is an original work. Even by Tarantino's standards, this is a gory, violent film. However, the opening scene is one of the great examples of using tension. Here, Tarantino follows the Hitchcockian \"bomb under the table\" approach of letting the audience in on a key element to crank up the tension even further. This is explained beautifully in this YouTube analysis by Lessons from the Screenplay. Then the later scene in the tavern basement is another example of Tarantino artfully using tension. In both scenes, we get fantastic acting peformances - from Christoph Waltz as Col. Hans Landa in the first, and Michael Fassbender as Lt. Archie Hicox in the second. This is Tarantino's best-written film, and that is saying a lot. Last year’s ranking - #72\n\n33. Lawrence of Arabia - David Lean (1962) When I first saw this film, I didn’t fully appreciate it. This year, I had the distinct privilege of seeing it on the big screen. Here is a film that simply has to be viewed in this way. You cannot appreciate it fully without having the enormity of the story and the technical prowess wash over you. Interestingly enough, it wasn’t the cinematography or the editing (though both are some of the finest examples in movie history) that stood out the most when I saw it in the theater. What stood out the most was how Lean and legendary actor Peter O’Toole developed the character of T.E. Lawrence throughout the film. That this movie was even made is an absolute marvel. It is surely one of the gems of movie history. Last year’s ranking - NR\n\n32. Psycho - Alfred Hitchcock (1960) This is my personal favorite film from \"The Master of Suspense\" and it is a perfect example of how he would toy with the audience. The film is surely not as frightening today as it was when it was released, but that is a sign of its power as a film. It doesn't need to induce jump scares to evoke fear and concern, because it plays on emotions and worries that are inherent in all of us. We all know the feeling of having been caught in a lie and the lengths to which the human heart will go to cover up that embarrassment. This makes us resonate with Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) in the early parts of the film, but we cannot possibly be prepared for where the film will take us from there. Hitchcock made many incredible films, but this is his best, in my opinion. Last year’s ranking - #61\n\n31. Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark - Steven Spielberg (1981) Here's the film that started it all. The unforgettable lead character. The hat. The whip. The indelible music by John Williams. One of the great movie trilogies began with this story of our hero chasing after the Ark of the Covenant. Again, I vividly remember watching this film as a kid. Back then, I appreciated the fun storyline and the memorable music. I still appreciate those things, but the film holds up so well because there is even more to appreciate as you continue to watch it. From the callback to Casablanca in the early scene at Marion's (Karen Allen) bar to Spielberg's wonderful direction of the film's set pieces, this is an absolutely classic film. I've decided that it is my favorite Indiana Jones film, which is high praise indeed. Last year’s ranking - #34\n\n30. On the Waterfront - Elia Kazan (1954) Want to see an acting clinic? Watch Marlon Brando and Eva Marie Saint in this film. It's some of the finest acting you'll see. Kazan remains one of Hollywood's most influential directors long after his passing due to his co-founding of the Actors Studio in 1947. Along with the likes of Robert Lewis, Cheryl Crawford, and Lee Strasburg, Kazan helped introduce \"method acting\" to the United States. Kazan is also famous for testifying as part of the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1952 when fears about Communist infiltration were at their height. This film - with a main character who testifies against the mob - is thought by many to be Kazan's answer to those who ridiculed him for his own testimony. That political context adds another level of intrigue to this film, but it is a classic in its own right, thanks to the incredible talent across the board. Last year’s ranking - #55\n\n29. The Godfather Part II - Francis Ford Coppola (1974) The argument will continue to rage among cinephiles on which of the first two installments of this classic trilogy is the best. You'll just have to wait and see if this one can be topped, but it is undeniable that this is an incredible film in its own right. I find it to be the most emotional of the Godfather films, with the continuation of the trilogy's focus on family reaching a deeply personal level. Obviously Al Pacino's performance as Michael Corleone is legendary, but so too is John Cazale as Fredo Corleone. Cazale tragically died at a young age, but he showed such promise for a long and acclaimed career. Every film he appeared in was nominated for Best Picture, and this one became the very first sequel to ever win the award. Last year’s ranking - #36\n\n28. Casablanca - Michael Curtiz (1942) You knew this film would show up high on my list, right? It's high on everyone's list. And look, it stayed at the exact same spot as last year! How can one film be so universally adored? Well, it's plainly incredible, that's how. The writing is superb (As a die-hard Cubs fan, I must note that two of the screenwriters - Julius J. Epstein and Philip G. Epstein - are the great-uncle and grandfather, respectively, of Chicago Cubs President of Baseball Operations, Theo Epstein). The direction and cinematography are legendary. The acting is classic, including both Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman - two of the biggest stars of Hollywood's Golden Age. This is a timeless story, and it includes some of the most famous lines of dialogue ever put on film. I'm sorry, but I can't help it. \"Here's lookin' at you, kid.\" Last year’s ranking - #28\n\n27. The Apartment - Billy Wilder (1960) Here’s one of the biggest movers on this year’s list. It took me a second watch for it to really sink in, but this is certainly one of the best films ever made. In the pantheon of great film writers, Billy Wilder must certainly be near the top. His skills are on display beautifully here. In fact, with The Apartment, he became the first person to win Academy Awards as writer, director, AND producer for the same film. Jack Lemmon is one of my all-time favorite actors, and this has to be one of his best performances. However, from an acting perspective, this film belongs to the legendary Shirley MacLaine as elevator operator, Fran Kubelik. The film's closing is just perfect, and although the closing line from Some Like It Hot gets more acclaim, the last line spoken in The Apartment is truly classic in its own right. Last year’s ranking - #78\n\n26. The Shawshank Redemption - Frank Darabont (1994) This film has become a modern classic, and for good reason. Let’s start with the writing from Frank Darabont by way of Stephen King. The story is adapted from a novella by King, and Darabont does a fine job of adapting the material. These characters are some of the most memorable in recent movie history - from main characters Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and Red (Morgan Freeman) to smaller characters like Brooks (James Whitmore). Then, you also have to talk about the cinematography by Roger Deakins. This film has two shots in particular that are some of the most famous in movie history. There’s the shot that is featured in the header image above, and there’s the shot of the warden (Bob Gunton) finding Andy’s secret behind the poster. This is one of those films that, when you see it pop up on TV, it’s impossible to change the channel. Last year’s ranking - #24"
