        "text": "City Region BOSTON SUNDAY GLOBE DECEMBER 31, 2000 Julius Epstein, 90; penned 'Casablanca' Writer was nominee for Academy Award By Michael Blowen GLOBE STAFF Julius J. Epstein, a screenwriter with 47 films to his credit, including \"Casablanca,\" died yesterday at a. Beverly Hills, rehabilitation center. Mr. Epstein was born i in 1910 in New York City, where he spent his formative years .\n\nHe went to Penn State University on a boxing scholarship and was captain of the boxing team. He graduated in 1931 and returned to New York, where he began his career as an office boy, janitor, and press agent for a classical music conductor. \"I got $15 a week until one week I got the client's name mentioned in Mark Hellinger's column 22 times. Then he raised me to $20 and paid me every other week. That was my first lesson in show business,\" Mr .\n\nEpstein told the Globe in an interview when his film, \"Reuben, Reuben\" was released in the early 1980s. Her received an Oscar nomination for his adaptation of 1 the Peter DeVries novel. Mr. Epstein developed his sophisticated ear for dialogue by attending plays and eavesdropping on conversations. \"Many writers don't listen,\" he said .\n\n\"You must pay strict attention to language, cadence, and tone. Be sensitive to those things.\" In October 1933, Julius J. Epstein, on the basis of his ability to write dialogue, went to Hollywood as a ghostwriter on \"20 Million Sweethearts\" at Warner Brothers. His twin brother, Philip, an aspiring actor, followed him in the spring of 1934. \"I wrote an original story every night until one sold,\" said Mr .\n\nEpstein. Although Philip G. and Julius J. Epstein spent the next decade writing scripts, it wasn't until 1943 that their names became permanently bound into film history with the memorable dialogue and characterizations that became \"Casablanca.\" For years, Mr. Epstein refused to take much credit for \"Casablanca\" because he didn't want to hurt the feelings of the surviving family members of the other creators who had claimed a greater share of the creative pie than they earned .\n\nBut, after the urging of his nephew, novelist Leslie Epstein, and grandniece, Anya Epstein, a writer-producer on \"Homicide: Life on the Street,\" Mr. Epstein relented. \"I'm only setting the record straight because of Phil and the kids,\" he said. \"I don't really care. But all you have to do is listen to The way it should be It should be, first and foremost, about service personalized and compassionate service .\n\nIt should be about having a ceremony that meets your family's needs, whether that be traditional or uniquely personal. It should be about service that extends beyond the funeral with bereavement support available at the Levine Center for Loss and Healing. That's the way it should be. Paul R.

When we were working on it, it was just another picture .\n\nBut everything fell together for that one.\" According to Mr. Epstein, Jack Warner assigned him and his brother to write the script in 1942. The Epsteins had previously scored with Warner Brothers hits such as \"Four Daughters,\" \"No Time For Comedy,\" \"The Man Who Came to Dinner,\" and \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" (uncredited). \"It was fun going to work in those days,\" he said. \"The movie business is completely different now .\n\nAt Warners, when we were under contract, we did maybe three or four scripts a year. An actor would make five movies a year. A long shooting schedule like \"Casablanca\" was 28 days. Now, the movies are just like the theater and a screenwriter like a playwright. A screenwriter has more freedom the freedom to write a script the way he wants it written and the freedom to starve because no one is paying him a salary.\" Mr .\n\nEpstein was always being asked by young, aspiring screenwriters how to write scripts. \"The first question they always ask is how to write dialogue,\" he said. \"The second is how to get an agent.\" Mr. Epstein gave them the same advice. \"In the first act, get the star up a tree .\n\nToss stones at him in the second. Get him down in the third. \"It's not that hard. You can teach plot, movement, construction, and a variety of technical points, but I honestly believe that writing good, believable dialogue is an art. I tell them to listen, listen, listen .\n\nMost people watch movies, I listen to them.\" Mr. Epstein leaves his wife, Anne of Beverly Hills; a son, James of Los Angeles; a daughter, Elizabeth of California; and several grandchildren.

Foreign students greet new customs in Maine OAKLAND, Maine For Rodwell Mabaera, New Year's Eve in cold weather is a new experience. As a resident of Zimbabwe, the 21-year-old Colby College student is more accustomed to spending holidays in hot weather. Snow is virtually a foreign concept .\n\nBut though he's far from his southern Africa home, he's found ways of celebrating the holidays in his \"home away from home.\" Kulli Tamm, 18, of Estonia also is staying with host families during the holidays. Though she wasn't home for Christmas, she got to experience a different culture's holiday celebrations. On Christmas Eve, she went to church with her host family. Afterward, they shared Chinese food. On Christmas Day, they had a huge dinner with turkey and all the trimmings .\n\nIt was different from life in Estonia, where Christmas Eve is the big day, she said. \"My grandparents, cousins, aunts, and uncles gather and we have a big dinner,\" she said. \"Santa Claus comes with presents. Santa Claus sits in a big chair and you have to sing and dance or read a poem to get your present.\" Mabaera spent a week in Boston with friends from Zimbabwe and now is back in Maine, staying with Colby communications director Stephen Collins and his family in Oakland. \"In some ways, I missed the family gathering and homecooked food and everything,\" he said .\n\n\"But I was with friends in Boston and we tried to cook some African food. For college students, it went well! You think about your family a little bit, but friends are always around, and Stephen's family has been the greatest host family.\" Though homesickness has hit during the holidays, both Mabaera and Tamm say they relish going to school in the United States. (AP) Fishermen lose loan program PORTSMOUTH, N.H. Commercial fisherman Geordie King's boat needed a new $5,500 drive shaft, and without it, he would be unable to earn money to make payments on a loan he received from the New Hampshire Port Authority's Revolving Loan Fund. But last week, the Port Authority's board of directors and Citizens Bank, which administers the loan fund's federal money, suspended the program indefinitely .\n\nFishermen such as King could not borrow money anymore to keep their business afloat. \"I wouldn't have my boat if it wasn't for that program,\" said King, 40, from his home in Eliot, Maine. Fortunately, it turned out King needed only a partial replacement of the drive shaft, at a cost of about $1,800, which he was able to come up with on his own. Geno Marconi, acting port director, said he is not happy the Port Authority voted to suspend the revolving loan fund. But he agreed with chairman Robert Snover and other board members that it was \"a prudent move.\" Earlier this month, the US attorney's office in Concord and the attorney general seized all Port Authority files connected with the loan program .\n\nThe federal investigation follows an audit by the legislative budget assistant's office that was critical of the port's operations and management practices. The revolving loan fund was established in 1994 with $1 million in federal money to help fishermen improve or buy new boats and equipment. Fisherman Erik Anderson is president of the New Hampshire Commercial Fishermen's Association and a recipient of a loan. He called the program highly successful, and said it should be reinstated immediately. Without it, fishermen are in jeopardy of losing their businesses, he said .\n\n(AP) ."
