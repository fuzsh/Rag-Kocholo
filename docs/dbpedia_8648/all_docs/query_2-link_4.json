        "text": "The romance of the film Casablanca transcends the cult which has built up around it. Yet never has that 1943 Oscar-winning masterpiece been so misunderstood as by its screeenwriter, Julius Epstein, who has died aged 91. It was, he observed, \"slick shit\". As for the cult, he once suggested it had only been the death of Humphrey Bogart in 1955 that created it.\n\nRoutinely assigned to Casablanca by Warner Brothers in 1942, Epstein and his twin brother, Philip, never expected it to shake free of its chaotic creation. Not only was their work in transforming a ropey, unpublished play, Everybody Comes To Rick's, given a political twist by a third screenwriter, Howard Koch, but changes were demanded from day to day, not least for the ending. Such uncertainty was of a piece with its seemingly haphazard casting - at one point Ronald Reagan was a candidate for the role of Rick.\n\nThere is no greater symptom of the film's triumphant muddle than the fact that Dooley Wilson, who plays the theme, As Time Goes By, was a drummer; his piano-playing was dubbed by other fingers. \"We were not making art,\" said Epstein. \"We were making a living.\"\n\nBetween 1934 and 1984, Epstein worked on more than 50 films. His life was a classic rise from obscurity, with hard slog bringing a lucky break. He and his brother were born on New York's lower east side where, as schoolboys, they cleaned out their father's livery stables each day. Despite this and a penchant for boxing - both ran teams at Penn State University - Julius developed a taste for restoration comedy and Moli√®re.\n\nBroadway was his goal; the writing of press releases, a stop-gap. Such work threw up a radio columnist, Jerry Wald, who duly bluffed his way into Hollywood and was hard put to write screenplays. He summoned Julius from New York and gave him $25 a week to ghostwrite. This yielded Twenty Million Sweethearts (1934) for Dick Powell and Ginger Rogers. Epstein continued such ghosting, then, in 1935, came up with his own elegant flying drama, Living On Velvet. A contract with Warners was his, leaving Wald to call on the services of Philip Epstein, who, with his brother, had written a play which was performed in New York.\n\nIn 1938, Four Daughters got Epstein his first Oscar nomination. Meanwhile, the brothers' collaboration galvanised Philip's talent for screwball comedy, and in 1938 he wrote The Mad Miss Manton. To write of one is to write of the other, such was their bond. If The Bride Came C.O.D. (1941) now seems forced, the same can hardly be said of their 1942 versions of The Man Who Came to Dinner and The Male Animal. One of their finest adaptations was of Arsenic And Old Lace (1944) for Frank Capra, with whom they had a brief wartime propaganda stint in Washington.\n\nThey could be relied upon to give new life to scripts which a star found lacking. James Cagney insisted upon them being brought in to work on Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), to exhilarating effect.\n\nThey were keen practical jokers. A high farce could be made about the production of Casablanca. Executive producer Jack Warner complained, for example, that the brothers were not in at nine - \"Get in at nine; even bank presidents get in at nine.\" They responded by sending him part of a script with the note, \"have the bank president finish the script\". When Warner complained that one scene was the worst in motion-picture history, Epstein said: \"How is that possible? It was written at nine o'clock.\"\n\nTo one scene in Casablanca, Koch added Humprey Bogart's line, \"I don't buy or sell human beings.\" A worthy sentiment, but when it came back to the Epsteins, they gave it true life in Sydney Greenstreet's reply, \"That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity.\"\n\nSuch was the brothers' closeness that, when driving across Sunset Boulevard and Beverly Glen, Claude Rains's line, \"Round up the usual suspects\", came to them simultaneously. \"Whenever I drive past the spot, I raise my hand in salute,\" recalled Julius.\n\nWith this success, the brothers began to produce at Warners. Alas, Mr Skeffington (1946), with Bette Davis and Claude Rains, is more serviceable than inspired, as was their pleasant Doris Day vehicle, Romance On The High Seas (1948).\n\nA move to Paramount and an adaptation of JM Barrie's Forever Female (1953) had them location-hunting in a wood when Philip got poison oak badly, for which he was prescribed liquid cortisone by the bottleful. His family believes this triggered a cancer which killed him in 1952.\n\nJulius was devastated. He continued writing but, despite such successes as The Tender Trap (1955) and Fanny (1961), it was not until 1972 that his spirit met its match in a novella by that brilliant, underrated novelist Peter De Vries - the Oscar-nominated Pete 'n' Tillie, with Walter Matthau and Carol Burnett. In 1977, he collaborated, surprisingly perhaps, on the screenplay for Sam Peckinpah's violent account of life on the German side of the second world war, Cross Of Iron.\n\nRather more muted was another De Vries adaptation, the Oscar-nominated Reuben Reuben (1983). Epstein always claimed special regard for this account of a Dylan Thomas-like poet (Tom Conti) at loose in small-town New England. It appears to have been made on the cheap, and veers between comedy and drama. \"Now I thank people from the bottom of my pacemaker,\" remarked Epstein in old age, but in his heart he knew that it would always be hard to match Casablanca. Howard Koch died five years ago, so with Epstein's death, the last substantial player in the story of the film has passed.\n\nEpstein's marriage to Frances Sage ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife Ann, and two children from his first marriage. A son from his second marriage predeceased him in 1999."
