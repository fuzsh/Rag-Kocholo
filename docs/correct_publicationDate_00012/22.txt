Blurb: ”Of the six volumes of William Tenn's work now made simultaneously available, THE WOODEN STAR comes closest to being a pacifist collection, the general theme being an ironic and sometimes bitter comment on man's stupidity to man.

But Tenn's humor is irrepressible and bursts forth in a joyous political satire on the wars of the sexes titled "The Masculinist Revolt" - which may yet bring codpieces back into fashion.

And do not miss the other titles pictured below.”
