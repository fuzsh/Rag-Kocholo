Men must 'belong' to a woman to have a say in anything and have become weak and somewhat silly. William Tenn tells a delightful story here of the future where women indeed rule earth, but an entire shipload of women are on a space ship going to Venus looking for husbands because they have heard that real men are there and this idea excites them. A young boy (who 'belong' to his older sister) is among them and tells this story of the sex drive gone wrong. Or right according to some sources.",
