        "text": "January 12, 2023\n\nI am seldom gobsmacked by an SF book these days, having during the past seven years read around 150 SF novels and double the amount of short stories. When I read a novel or short story published in the 50’s, I can usually tell pretty much where it is going after the first few pages, and halfway through I can mostly narrow down my prediction of the ending to two or three well-worn tropes. Not so William Tenn’s “Time in Advance” (1952–1958).\n\nI was unaware of Mr. Tenn before I picked up this book, a collection of four novelettes dealing with the future. But almost from page 1 it was clear this was something new. Opening powerfully with a scene of a business tycoon having a meeting with a group of four telekinetic hippies speaking their own form of gibberish-English, “Firewater” deals with a world in which super-advanced aliens – small, flying “insects” – have invaded Earth. They have the power to wipe out humanity with a simple thought, but for some reason refrain from doing so, instead seeming to try to communicate with mankind. The smartest, most educated humans who seem to come close to communicating with the aliens all suddenly go “prime”, and descend into blind religious worship of the aliens, somehow also picking up some of their telekinetic powers, as their IQ’s suddenly shoot through the roof. And for some reason, the best bet for humanity seems to be our protagonist, a ruthless businessman who has made his career on (illegally) dealing with “primeys”, trading technology and knowledge between humans and aliens.\n\nThen there’s the story of a future where you can “buy” yourself the right to an act or murder by serving your prison time in advance on the brutal off-world colonies – the two men who actually survive the ordeal and come back to Earth as celebrities – and licensed murderers. And the four time travellers stuck in the 26th century because their companion refuses to return home as planned, and they cannot leave without him. Even the “ancient virus on Mars” trope is made highly original in Tenn’s retelling.\n\nJune 7, 2015\n\nI stumbled onto this old 1968 paperback edition and bought it entirely for the wrong reason, believing it was the work of James Tiptree, Jr. I had read about Tiptree some several weeks before—that she was an SF hellion during her ten-year heyday in the late 60’s and 70’s, that her identity had long been unknown and that from a male perspective she seemed to write some powerfully feminist statements—but I had forgotten the name “James Tiptree, Jr” and was willing to believe the pseudonym I’d read of was “William Tenn.”\n\nI should’ve see that the stories were all originally published in various SF magazines in the 50’s (and didn't jibe with Tiptree's heyday), but I was too elated at my misguided enthusiasm to examine more closely. In any case, I ended up not with a scathing and mordant perspective on male/female relations, but instead with four interesting and well-wrought stories of their time—not quite a literary treat, but not a thorough wash either.\n\nThe basis of these stories is a twist, whether or plot or perspective, so a too thorough description of the stories deflates their impact for the first-time reader. The premise of “Time in Advance” is that in the future a man may serve out a prison term before he’s committed a particular crime, thus upon release giving him carte blanche to freely commit his “crime”. In this instance the protagonist has served seven perilous years on a space chain gang for the crime of murder, and he returns to Earth ready to kill that man whom he believes had ruined his life. This particular twist on crime and punishment is further contorted when the protagonist confronts various people from his past before contacting the man whose death he seeks.\n\nThe twist in “Firewater” is that the typical human-alien encounter is thoroughly benign, but oddly unintelligible to both human and alien. The aliens are energy motes—dots—that have no material culture. Contact appears to make humans disoriented, making them dizzily ascetic and spiritual, while the aliens reaction is to devise variations on basic human machines and devices. The protagonist of this story is the CEO of a large multi-national conglomerate, and he secretly exploits the alien’s innovations to corner established markets and create new ones. Human society at large cannot tolerate its state of ignorance about the aliens, and paranoia spurs the growth of a movement to wipe out the aliens and the humans affected by them. The firewater analogy, an allusion to the effect of alcohol on American Indians perpetrated by Caucasian traders, is altered to include both alien and human: each is made “drunk” by contact with the other, and the protagonist has to figure out how to communicate with the aliens to protect them and his profits.\n\n“The Sickness” extrapolates from the cold war tensions of the nuclear stand-off in the 50s, when escalating nuclear arsenals in the US and USSR had everyone sensing imminent annihilation. On an international space expedition to Mars, a team of Russians, Americans, and Indians discover an old city, then one of the Russians becomes ill from an alien virus. Tensions in the crew mount, as the balance of healthy Americans to Russians shift, then continues to shift daily as either an American or Russian also succumbs to the virus. The penultimate twist is that the illness makes everyone smarter and promises world peace; the ultimate twist, however, is bitterly personal for the story’s protagonist.\n\n“Winthrop was Stubbon” is a time travel story that has a five-person party of random, late 20th century Americans stranded in the 25th century. All but one of the time travelers is eager to return to the 20th century. Each of the four individually tries to convince Winthrop to return, for they can return only as an intact group. No one in the 25th century will help to persuade or otherwise compel Winthrop to do other than what he wants; at this time social and moral imperatives dictate individuals act independently to fulfill any personal impulse, so long as it does not impinge on others. There is a tepid bit of satire in this extrapolation of rampant Millsian individualism, which ends with an ironic resolution to the time travelers’ dilemma. This is the least satisfying of the four tales, as the story's tone—comically bright and fey—contributes to make the conclusion merely a muddled implication.\n\nWhile a mixed bag, this volume is largely entertaining. Even when any given story doesn’t quite cohere, there are enough balls being kept aloft in each to keep interest. Characterization is usually seen as SF’s Achilles hell, weak because the author invests more in the set-up. Tenn, however, gets good marks with “Time in Advance” and “The Sickness”, where his protagonists’ concerns appear real enough to care about."
