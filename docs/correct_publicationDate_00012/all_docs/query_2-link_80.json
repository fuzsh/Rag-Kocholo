        "text": "Earlier today, Attorney General William P. Barr announced the results of Operation Legend, which was first launched in Kansas City, Missouri, on July 8, 2020, and then expanded to Chicago and Albuquerque, New Mexico, on July 22, 2020; to Cleveland, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on July 29, 2020; to St. Louis, Missouri, and Memphis, Tennessee, on August 6, 2020; and to Indianapolis, Indiana, on August 14, 2020.\n\n“Operation Legend removed violent criminals, domestic abusers, carjackers and drug traffickers from nine cities which were experiencing stubbornly high crime and took illegal firearms, illegal narcotics and illicit monies off the streets. By most standards, many would consider these results as a resounding success—amid a global pandemic, the results are extraordinary. I commend our federal law enforcement and prosecutors for seamlessly executing this operation in partnership with state and local law enforcement,” said Attorney General Barr. “When we launched Operation Legend, our goal was to disrupt and reduce violent crime, hold violent offenders accountable and give these communities the safety they deserve in memory of LeGend Taliferro, whose young life was claimed by violent crime, undoubtedly, we achieved it.”\n\nSince Operation Legend’s launch on July 8, 2020, over 6,000 arrests – including approximately 467 for homicide – were made; more than 2600 firearms were seized; and more than 32 kilos of heroin, more than 17 kilos of fentanyl, more than 300 kilos of methamphetamine, more than 135 kilos of cocaine, and more than $11 million in drug and other illicit proceeds were seized.\n\nOf the more than 6,000 individuals arrested, approximately 1,500 have been charged with federal offenses. Approximately 815 of those defendants have been charged with firearms offenses, while approximately 566 have been charged with drug-related crimes. The remaining defendants have been charged with various offenses.\n\nThe Attorney General launched the operation as a sustained, systematic and coordinated law enforcement initiative in which federal law enforcement agencies work in conjunction with state and local law enforcement officials to fight violent crime. Operation Legend is named in honor of four-year-old LeGend Taliferro, who was shot and killed while he slept early in the morning of June 29 in Kansas City.\n\nThe Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office) provided a total of $60 million to fund 290 officers as part of Operation Legend and related efforts. Additionally, the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) awarded nearly $9 million in grant funding to support Operation Legend.\n\nBreakdown of Operation Legend charges:\n\nKansas City, MO.\n\n196 defendants have been charged with federal crimes outlined below.\n\n75 defendants have been charged with narcotics-related offenses;\n\n107 defendants have been charged with firearms-related offenses; and\n\n14 defendants have been charged with other violent crimes.\n\nChicago, Ill.\n\n176 defendants have been charged with federal crimes outlined below.\n\n40 defendants have been charged with narcotics-related offenses;\n\n130 defendants have been charged with firearms-related offenses; and\n\nSix defendants have been charged with other violent crimes.\n\nAlbuquerque, NM.\n\n167 defendants have been charged with federal crimes outlined below.\n\n60 defendants have been charged with narcotics-related offenses;\n\n85 defendants have been charged with firearms-related offenses; and\n\n22 defendants have been charged with other violent crimes.\n\nCleveland, OH.\n\n119 defendants have been charged with federal crimes outlined below.\n\n60 defendants have been charged with narcotics-related offenses;\n\n55 defendants have been charged with firearms-related offenses; and\n\nFour defendants have been charged with other violent crimes.\n\nDetroit, MI.\n\n100 defendants have been charged with federal offenses outlined below.\n\n33 defendants have been charged with narcotics-related offenses;\n\n64 defendants have been charged with firearms-related offenses; and\n\nThree defendants have been charged with other violent crimes.\n\nMilwaukee, WI.\n\n74 defendants have been charged with federal crimes, broken down as follows:\n\n34 defendants have been charged with firearm related offenses;\n\n32 defendants have been charged with narcotic related offenses;\n\nEight defendants have been charged with other violent crimes.\n\nSt. Louis, MO.\n\n450 defendants have been charged with federal crimes.\n\n193 defendants have been charged with narcotics-related offenses;\n\n231 defendants have been charged with firearms-related offenses; and\n\n26 defendants have been charged with other violent crimes.\n\nMemphis, Tenn.\n\n124 defendants have been charged with federal offenses outlined below:\n\n53 defendants have been charged with narcotics-related offenses;\n\n47 defendants have been charged with firearms-related offenses; and\n\n24 defendants have been charged with other violent crimes.\n\nIndianapolis, IN.\n\n94 defendants have been charged with federal crimes outlined below.\n\n18 defendants have been charged with narcotics-related offenses;\n\n64 defendants have been charged with firearms-related offenses; and\n\n12 defendants have been charged with other violent crimes."
