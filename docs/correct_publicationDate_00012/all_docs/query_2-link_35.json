        "text": "It's \"Down Among the Dead Men\" by William Tenn. They were called \"blobs\" not \"globs\".\n\nFrom the SF Encyclopedia:\n\n. . . William Tenn's \"Down Among the Dead Men\" (June 1954 Galaxy), where \"human protoplasm reclamation\" creates fully human and intelligent (though sterile) new soldiers who are subject to discrimination and abuse as \"zombies\" or \"blobs\" . . .\n\nWhen the viewpoint character admits his sterility, it somewhat reconciles the resurrected soldiers to their fate.\n\nNot too sure, but could this be We All Died at Breakaway Station by Richard C. Meredith. There isn't a whole lot about it online except for various reviews, but here's an excerpt of one of them:\n\n\"Now the Jillies are massing to attack Breakaway Station. This station is only lightly defended and unless reinforcements can be delivered in time, the Jillies will take it.\n\nEarth however has no regular forces close enough to protect the station. The only possible reinforcement is a hospital ship and the two battle cruisers escorting it back to Earth. The hospital ship carries the frozen remains of thousands of solders who may still be revived and repaired. The crews of the ships are war casualties themselves, still desperately injured, temporarily repaired, some rebuilt as cyborgs.\n\nCaptain Absolom Bracer is now only half-human, his head and chest mounted upon a medical pedestal, and with one prosthetic arm and one mechanical. As captain, he needs his wits about him, he must stay alert, so he doesn't take his painkillers and he hurts.\"\n\nhttp://www.sfreviews.com/docs/Richard%20C.%20Meredith_1969_We%20All%20Died%20At%20Breakaway%20Station.htm"
