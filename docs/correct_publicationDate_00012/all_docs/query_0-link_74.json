        "text": "Robert Silverberg's collection of the \"best\" sci-fi stories written from the 20's to the 60's is one of my all time favorite books, as so many of the stories are so powerful that they just stay with you...forever. Nightfall, Microcosmic God, Flowers for Algeron, on and on. To say that these stories have been influention in shaping sci-fi is also an understatement.\n\nI have been considerably less impressed with the \"best of\" particular year books that are still published, and really havent ever come across anything like Silberberg's book. Anyone know of anything else that really impressed you?\n\nMy favorite anthology was Space Odyssey:An Anthology of Great Science Fiction Stories. I got it in 1990, but I think it first came out in GB in 1983. It had stories by Silverberg, Vonnegut Jr, Clarke, Pohl... Its hard to remember exactly what I was thinking 20 years ago at age 15, but I'm pretty sure this book started my obsession with science fiction.\n\nI have read a few newer ones and nothing in them really impressed me. The latest was Infinities: The Best of British SF. Ive tried to start almost every story in it and lost interest in all of them early on.\n\nBut like the OP if anyone has any good recommendations Id love to give them a try\n\nA couple of older ones I'd further recommend, though they are getting hard to get and especially so here in the UK. I had to order them secondhand from the States:\n\nThe Astounding Science Fiction Anthology edited by John W Campbell; A Treasury of Science Fiction and The Big Book of Science Fiction, edited by Groff Conklin and Adventures in Space and Time edited by Raymond J. Healy and J. Francis McComas (Link for details)\n\nSomeone here recommended Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Science Fiction a while back (sorry can't remember who, exactly!) and I would wholeheartedly recommend it also. A nice big book and cheap. The contents include:\n\nVOLUME ONE: THE FUTURE IN QUESTION\n\nIntroduction: The Nature of the Title, by Isaac Asimov\n\nWhat's it like out there, by Edmond Hamilton\n\nWho can replace a man, by Brian W. Aldiss\n\nWhat have I done, by Mark Clifton\n\nWho's there, by Arthur C. Clarke\n\nCan you feel anything when I do this? by Robert Sheckley\n\nWhy? by Robert Silverberg\n\nWhat's become of Screwloose? by Ron Goulart\n\nHouston, Houston, Do you read? by James Tiptree, Jr.\n\nWhere have you been Billy boy, Billy boy? by Kate Wilhelm\n\nIf all men were brothers, would you let one marry your sister? by Theodore Sturgeon\n\nWill you Wait? by Alfred Bester\n\nWho goes there? by John W. Campbell, Jr.\n\nAn eye for what? by Damon Knight\n\nI Plinglot, who you? by Frederik Pohl\n\nWill you walk a little faster? by William Tenn\n\nWho's in charge here? by James Blish\n\nThe Last Question, by Isaac Asimov\n\nVOLUME TWO: SPACE MAIL\n\nIntroduction by Isaac Asimov\n\nLETTERS\n\nI never ast no favors, by C.M Kornbluth\n\nLetter to Ellen, by Chan Davis\n\nOne rejection too many, by Patricia Nurse\n\nSpace opera, by Ray Russell\n\nThe invasion of the terrible Titans, by William Sambrot\n\nThat only a Mother, by Judith Merril\n\nItch on the Bull Run, by Sharon Webb\n\nLetter to a Phoenix, by Fredric Brown\n\nWho's Cribbing? by Jack Lewis\n\nComputers don't argue, by Godron R. Dickson\n\nLetters from Laura, by Mildred Clingerman\n\nDear Pen Pal, by A.E van Vogt\n\nDamn shame, by Dean R. Lambe\n\nThe trap, by Howard Fast\n\nDIARIES\n\nFlowers for Algernon, by Daniel Keyes\n\nThe second kind of loneliness, by George R. R. Martin\n\nMEMOS\n\nThe Lonely, by Judith Merril\n\nSecret Unattainable, by A.E van Vogt\n\nAfter the Great Space War, by Barry N. Malzberg\n\nThe Prisoner, by Christopher Anvil\n\nRequest for proposal, by Anthony R. Lewis\n\nHe walked around the horse, by H. Beam Piper\n\nThe Power, by Murray Leinster.\n\nMark\n\nRobert Silverberg's collection of the \"best\" sci-fi stories written from the 20's to the 60's is one of my all time favorite books, as so many of the stories are so powerful that they just stay with you...forever. Nightfall, Microcosmic God, Flowers for Algeron, on and on. To say that these stories have been influention in shaping sci-fi is also an understatement.\n\nI recognize all of those stories. Could you give us a complete list.\n\nBut e-book reading can change the entire concept of anthologies. There are so many stories I never ran across way back when. The publishing, marketing and distribution systems kind of randomize what we encounter. Now the problem is filtering out the flood of mediocre and bad.\n\nI remember this from ancient days:\n\nThin Edge, by Gordon Randall Garrett\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/files/30869/30869-h/30869-h.htm\n\nbut I never ran across this:\n\nThe Measure of a Man, by Randall Garrett\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/files/24135/24135-h/24135-h.htm\n\nThis stuck in my mind though:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrimage_to_Earth\n\npsik\n\nRobert Silverberg's collection of the \"best\" sci-fi stories written from the 20's to the 60's is one of my all time favorite books, as so many of the stories are so powerful that they just stay with you...forever. Nightfall, Microcosmic God, Flowers for Algeron, on and on.

Anyone know of anything else that really impressed you?\n\nJust to point out, the Silverberg \"best,\" by which I think you mean the SF Hall of Fame anthologies, were stories voted on by the SF Writers of America (real association name may vary from remembered assn. name). Those folks had multiple years of perspective that a \"year's best\" anthologist doesn't have -- most of the stories they voted in were between 20 and 40 years old at the time, and most of them had been discussed and argued over since publication, anthologized numerous times already, were well-known within the field, and their position in the anthology was really already established and voting, if not quite a formality, was nearly so.\n\nI've enjoyed Dangerous Visions, Adventures in Time and Space, and The Norton Book of Science Fiction (poking through it for years now, still haven't finished).\n\nRandy M.\n\nJust to point out, the Silverberg \"best,\" by which I think you mean the SF Hall of Fame anthologies, were stories voted on by the SF Writers of America (real association name may vary from remembered assn. name).

I never have, but should try em.\n\nLots of great stories here.\n\nThanks,\n\nRead it, remember it:\n\nHelen O'Loy -- Lester del Rey\n\nThe Roads Must Roll -- Robert A. Heinlein\n\nNightfall -- Isaac Asimov\n\nThe Weapon Shop -- A. E. van Vogt\n\nMimsy Were the Borogoves -- Lewis Padgett\n\nArena -- Fredric Brown\n\nThe Little Black Bag -- C. M. Kornbluth\n\nThe Nine Billion Names of God -- Arthur C. Clarke\n\nFlowers for Algernon -- Daniel Keyes\n\nThe Cold Equations -- Tom Godwin ---+\n\nFondly Fahrenheit -- Alfred Bester -----+------ These two should be together\n\nRemember the title but not the story, probably read it:\n\nMicrocosmic God -- Theodore Sturgeon\n\nScanners Live in Vain -- Cordwainer Smith\n\nSurface Tension -- James Blish\n\nIt's a Good Life -- Jerome Bixby\n\nA Rose for Ecclesiastes -- Roger Zelazny\n\nDon't remember the title but may have read it:\n\nHuddling Place -- Clifford D. Simak\n\nA Martian Odyssey -- Stanley G. Weinbaum\n\nTwilight -- John W. Campbell\n\nFirst Contact -- Murray Leinster\n\nThat Only a Mother -- Judith Merril\n\nMars is Heaven -- Ray Bradbury\n\nBorn of Man and Woman -- Richard Matheson\n\nComing Attraction -- Fritz Leiber\n\nThe Quest for Saint Aquin -- Anthony Boucher\n\nThe Country of the Kind -- Damon Knight\n\nWe really need some way of classifying stories and specifying and rating characteristics. What ideas are presented in a story? How can anybody tell?\n\nProblems with Modern Science Fiction\n\nhttp://www.philforhumanity.com/Science_Fiction.html\n\npsik"
