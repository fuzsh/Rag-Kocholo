        "text": "Can we talk about Ted Chiang? The guy is just such an impressive crafter of short stories. The first thing I ever read by him was Exhalation; it left me dumbfounded and marveled at his ability to pull you spiraling down into his bizarre, rational, madness... and yet the core concern of the story with mortality, with the inevitable death of all things, is so humane. But it isn't dreary or fatalistic, this idea of the end of all change is presented as something beautiful, something to admire and be astounded by: The unsuspected, wonderful, complexity of being, and the experience of uncovering this complexity. It's, at the same time, fantastical, rational and humane.\n\nI felt like I'd just gotten a hit of the most amazing drug, I needed more Chiang. After that I read Story of your life and others, The Lifecycle of Software Objects and The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate one after the other and I was surprised to find a never ending fount of amazing ideas, told in the marveling, bizarre style that is so characteristic of Chiang.\n\nEdit: Oh dang... I just realized this thread is 4 years old.... ARISE, FALLEN ONE.\n\nThese underrated threads often make me giggle, especially when people throw out recommendations for award winners (Kim Stanley Robinson, John Varley, Heinlein), Giants of the field (Heinlein agaom, possibly KSR, Philip K. Dick), and writers who have awards named after them and/or have tons of films based off their work (again, PKD for the last two).\n\nGranted, Varley doesn't get discussed much nowadays, but he was a big name in the genre at one point in time. I've only read The Golden Globe by him and really liked it.\n\nWas that enough of me talking out of both sides of my mouth?\n\nI agree with the giggling and the reason for it, but even well-known authors have books that aren't as well-known and well-regarded as their other works. Think, at the extreme, of Herman Melville and Moby Dick. His earlier novels had been well-regarded nautical adventures but the ambition behind MD was so little recognized by contemporary reviewers that it harpooned his novel-writing career. (*cough*)\n\nWhich actually, I think, segues well into William Faulkner's \"The Bear,\" which shares features with MD, and so to Greg Benford, who is not exactly unknown and disdained among sf readers, and Against Infinity which I rarely hear mentioned. It's a reinterpretation of William Faulkner's \"The Bear\" into s.f. terms and milieu and while I've no idea how I'd think of it now, when I read it years ago I thought it was re-imagined brilliantly. Don't get me wrong, Benford does not have the Faulkner way with words, but the ideas behind the book and the way he deployed them I found jaw-droppingly good.\n\nSo, yeah, famous author and relatively obscure book.\n\nRandy M.\n\nGranted, Varley doesn't get discussed much nowadays, but he was a big name in the genre at one point in time. I've only read The Golden Globe by him and really liked it.\n\nVarley's Steel Beach and Golden Globe were fabulous novels. I had hoped he would write Irontown Blues (long-rumored next 8 planets book), but afaik its still a title without a novel. That said, authors with awards can and do become unknown. I have been on a journey of adventure with NESFA and other republishers of much older authors that I had literally never heard of, and discovering that Sprague de Camp (with and without pratt) was more than just a guy who edited Conan. Varley, Chalker, , and other 80s'90s authors are only a decade or two from sinking into a similar oblivion at best. (varley is still publishing of course, which helps. Am curious to see a distribution of age of forum members and whether they have read Midnight at the Well of Souls (or ANY chalker book, for that matter) to see if my hypothesis holds up.)\n\nedit - apparently varley has stated mid-2015 that he is actually at work on Iron Town Blues!! http://varley.net/nonfiction/news/irontown-blues/\n\nMy contributions to original thread -\n\nThe Dragon Never Sleeps - Glen Cook\n\nI still re-read this every few years.\n\nedit2 - oh my, i hope I didn't just re-post my same thoughts from 4 years ago, at least as far as Glen Cook.\n\nOkay, since this has been revived I'm going to throw out a few. Here are two from a younger person's perspective:\n\n1. Silverberg and Cherryh - OK, you can't really call them underrated considering both their legacies. But I don't know anyone my age who has read them. It's not like I have a zillion friends, but I do hang out with people that read a lot of genre fiction, and these two do not seem to be on the contemporary (20 something) radar the way Clarke, PKD, LeGuin, Haldeman, etc. have managed.\n\n2. China Mountain Zhang - It doesn't seem like anyone talks about this book. I have never read anything else like it, and really loved it!\n\n3. Eon - Overshadowed by the other big dumb object books. I liked it a lot better than Rama, to be honest, but that's just me. Still think it's as good as any of them.\n\nOkay, since this has been revived I'm going to throw out a few.

Still think it's as good as any of them.\n\n1 & 3 seem to fit the category of 'newly relatively unknown,' which might be an author that older readers would regard as having been quite popular at one point, but who has lapsed into such obscurity (even though I believe all 3 of those there are still publishing) that younger forum members have not really heard of them or read a single title.\n\nI have tried to think of a sci-fi book by silverberg I really liked, and despite having read dozens of his books it can be hard to name just one. The odd juxtaposition is I usually enjoy his work a lot. Star gypsy, gilgamesh in hell, the alien years?\n\nCJ cherryh maybe is reaching the point of relative unknown with many readers. I reread many of the alliance-union stories as well as the Morgaine series in the last year or so. I don't like almost anything she has published since the very early 1990's.\n\nIf Greg Bear has graduated to the newly relatively unknown category, I would add Moving Mars and Slant. I did personally find the later Potato books harder going to get through.\n\nI will add another underrated book (or omnibus) -\n\nThe Northworld Trilogy, by David Drake. Based pretty tightly on the Prose Edda and Norse mythology, this is from earlier in his career when he was actively adapting myths/fables into sci-fi settings. It is one of my favorite 'books.'\n\nHave friend of your who enjoyed The Forever War read Armor by John Steakley?\n\nI felt like I'd just gotten a hit of the most amazing drug, I needed more Chiang. After that I read Story of your life and others, The Lifecycle of Software Objects and The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate one after the other and I was surprised to find a never ending fount of amazing ideas, told in the marveling, bizarre style that is so characteristic of Chiang.\n\nOne of my prized possessions is the little Subterranean Press hardback of Chiang's \"Lifecycle of Software Objects\". A brilliant story and a beautiful example of books as artefacts.\n\nThe story itself is available for free on the old Subterranean Online website: https://subterraneanpress.com/magaz...e_lifecycle_of_software_objects_by_ted_chiang\n\nChiang is celebrated critically but his output is small, and exclusively short stories, it seems, so I think he's a perfect example of an underrated author, and worthy of thread resurrection!"
