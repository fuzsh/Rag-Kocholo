I’ve tried to be good and not give away endings, but it’s impossible to talk about Tenn stories without talking about plot, and watching the plot unfold—and then wrap itself around your neck and strangle you—is one of the chief pleasures of reading a Tenn story.\n\nSo, go read the stories in this book, one at a time (like chocolates) or all at once (like chocolates) and then come back and talk about them with me. Read Bernie the Faust first. It’s my favorite. Or...no, wait. Read Lisbon Cubed first. No, Winthrop Was Stubborn. No, Eastward Ho! No…\n\nlater: Okay, you’re back. Now we can talk. When William Tenn (really Philip Klass) spoke at the Science Fiction Writers of America awards banquet in 1999—he had been named Writer Emeritus, an honor awarded to under-appreciated treasures of the field—he had the entire roomful of writers, editors, and agents rolling on the floor. And hoping fervently that Phil didn’t know any stories about them.\n\nThat’s because he knows everything about everyone in the entire field. He was part of science fiction in the legendary Golden Age, and he knew Fritz Leiber, Clifford Simak, and Algis Budrys, worked for John W. Campbell and the reclusive H.L. Gold, played poker with Robert Sheckley, was friends with Judith Merril, Theodore Sturgeon, and Daniel Keyes. And he has no hesitation about telling hilarious (and often scandalous) stories about all of them.\n\nHe was telling dozens of them that night at the awards banquet, and it was obvious the audience could have gone on listening to him all night. Charles N. Brown of Locus magazine says Phil Klass (really William Tenn) is the Scheherezade of science fiction, and Brown’s talking not only about Tenn’s speaking, but his writing. Because although Tenn is known for his biting wit and incisive irony, Tenn is first and foremost a storyteller.\n\nHis bio notes list acting, waiting tables, teaching at Penn State, and editing magazines and a classic anthology (Children of Wonder) as jobs he’s held, but they were, as he says, merely something to fill up the time between stories and novels.\n\nThose stories are known for their intricate plots, clever twists, and indelible characters: shady shysters, cut-rate Frankensteins, gypsies, sadly mistaken rulers of the world, advertising executives. And aliens.\n\nTenn’s aliens are perhaps his best characters: the black-tentacled suitcases of The Flat-Eyed Monster, the impossibly tall Mr. Tohu, bent forward at the hips and backwards at the shoulders, who you could have sworn popped Mr. Bohu in his pocket before departing, the seven-foot snails Andy and Dandy, the huge invaders of The Men in the Walls. Tenn’s aliens are always, in the words of George Zebrowski, \"properly terrifying, puzzling, and other.\"\n\nTenn’s most famous for his fiendishly clever endings. Some critics have called them trick endings, but they’re far more than mere tricks. In the first place, the word trick is way too mild for endings that come up and hit you in the face like a rake whose handle you’ve inadvertently stepped on. In the second place, they’re an integral part of the story, not just something tacked on for a cheap surprise.\n\nA good example is Bernie the Faust, about a con man who meets his match. The story’s not only about a con, it is a con, and we fall for it hook, line and sinker. I remember vividly the first time I read it, I reached the point where the alien with the dirty tongue mentioned wanting to buy the Golden Gate Bridge and thought smugly, \"I know what Tenn’s up to here,\" and spent the next few pages feeling smugly superior. And then I got to the ending, and found I’d been taken in just like Bernie, and we’d both been left holding the extraterrestrial bag.\n\nBut it’s not just the endings that are different from what we expect, it’s the stories themselves. In The Tenants, what seems to be a whimsical fantasy turns into a nightmarish trap. The Liberation of Earth is unlike any first-contact story you’ve ever read, and only Tenn could concoct a horror story out of lollipop trees and cotton candy clouds.\n\nWe’re not the only ones surprised. When H.L. Gold asked Tenn for a slam-bang, parsec-ricocheting space opera for Galaxy, Tenn responded with Down Among the Dead Men, which in a way was exactly what Gold had asked for, although he had to have been stunned by what he got. The reader is, too. It’s a story about zombies and intergalactic war, but it’s utterly original and has a depth of emotion you’d never expect to find in such a hard-bitten tale.\n\nIt’s ironic, though, that Down Among the Dead Men and the brilliant The Liberation of Earth are Tenn’s two most famous works because they’re both serious stories, and Tenn is primarily known as a humorous writer. Or perhaps it’s not all that surprising. Science fiction (and literature in general) has always had problems realizing just what a serious business comedy is, and how difficult it is to write. And Tenn’s comic stories look effortless and light, even though they’re incredibly complex.\n\nStories like Me, Myself, and I, The Flat-Eyed Monster, and Betelgeuse Bridge, are full of amusing situations and funny lines. People emerge from a crowded subway train somewhat like grape pips being expectorated, the Gtetans look on the Law as a delightful problem in circumvention rather than as a way of life, and the time-traveler in Flirgleflip describes the past he finds himself in as a scene from Mark Twain, Washington Irving, or Ernest Hemingway—one of the authors of that period, in any case.\n\nEven Tenn’s titles are funny: The Lemon-Green Spaghetti-Loud Dynamite Dribble Day and On Venus, Have We Got a Rabbi. Many of them, like The Human Angle and The Servant Problem have a barbed double meaning that only becomes clear after reading the story, and one of them, The Discovery of Morniel Mathaway, has a triple meaning.\n\nAnd the stories that follow those titles are hilarious. Probably my favorite (I have about fifteen favorite Tenn stories) is Party of the Two Parts, about an ameboid alien who sells pornographic pictures to an earthling who promptly puts them in a biology textbook, and the ensuing legal mess. After an ameba’s undergone fission, exactly who do you charge with the crime? And what exactly counts as pornography anyway? As the amebas ask, Are the most sacred and intimate details of our sex life to be shamelessly flaunted from one end of the universe to the other?\n\nBut even though Party of the Two Parts is laugh-out-loud funny, it’s also thought-provoking. (It’s no accident that the quotation at the beginning of Tenn’s short story collection Of All Possible Worlds is from Candide, and involves a discussion of effects and causes, this best of all possible worlds, the origin of evil, the nature of the soul, and pre-established harmony.) All of Tenn’s stories raise serious issues about us and the world we live in.\n\nThe nightmarish situation the people in A Man of Family find themselves in raises important questions about population control and our obsession with status. The Flat-Eyed Monster makes us look at the standard bug-eyed monster story from an entirely different point of view and makes us not only wonder what the monster was really doing when it carried the girl off, but whether the endings of all those bug-eyed monster stories were really as happy as we thought they were.\n\nEven in a straightforward Boo! story like The Human Angle, the little girl’s comment—I mean, if a person’s a vampire, what can they do about it? I mean, they can’t help themselves, can they?—seems to linger in the air, raising troubling questions about ourselves and about free will. Tenn’s stories are always a bit disturbing at some level, even when they are breathlessly readable, amusing, or cute, George Zebrowski, writing in Twentieth Century Science Fiction Writers, says.\n\nPerhaps Tenn’s most thought-provoking stories are his tales of first contact with aliens, which he calls his Here Comes Civilization! stories. They include Betelgeuse Bridge, Firewater, The Men in the Walls, and The Liberation of Earth, and they are nothing at all like the standard invading-monster or noble-aliens-who-have-come-to-share-their-advanced-technology-with-us stories.\n\nIf they’re technologically advanced enough to get here, Tenn reasons, then they’re advanced enough to roll right over us, and he shows us how, with scenes that make us think about Vietnam and the Warsaw ghetto and even the island of Manhattan, with us as the natives giving away the whole show for a handful of beads.\n\nThey’re stories that make us think, but we’re not the only ones thinking. Tenn is, too, about human foibles, about the ironies of life, sometimes even about the loose ends in his own stories. In Child’s Play, an all-too-plausible Frankenstein story, the hero accidentally receives a toy Bild-a-Man kit from the future and proceeds to play with it. His first clumsy attempt results in an amateurish baby, which he leaves on an orphanage doorstep. Then, troubled by the consequences of the hero’s actions (and his own), he wrote another story, Wednesday’s Child, about what happened to that abandoned baby.\n\nThat meticulous attention to detail reflects the seriousness with which he takes his writing. Anyone who doubts his commitment to his writing, or to science fiction, should read his essay, On the Fiction in Science Fiction. In it he shares his passionate belief in science fiction as a means of literary experience that has particular validity and significance in this age, an experience with an infinity of concept as well as cosmos where the author is limited only by his skills, his sensitivity, and the thematic range of his intellect.\n\nBut his love of science fiction doesn’t mean he feels all warm and fuzzy toward it. He’s sharply critical of its follies and shortcomings, and his stories are often angry or sarcastic responses to its silly conventions and ill-thought-out premises.\n\nThe Flat-Eyed Monster is clearly a response to pulp space operas, The Servant Problem to all those absolute-ruler-of-the-universe stories, The Discovery of Morniel Mathaway to the fantasy where someone goes back in time and meets Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nQuite a few of Tenn’s stories are about time travel. The time-travel story was a flourishing sub-genre in the fifties, usually revolving (sometimes literally) around the closed time loop, in which the hero goes back in time and, using his knowledge of the future, proceeds to invent that future or else becomes the historical figure he went back to study. Such stories were great fun—and in the hands of masters like Michael Moorcock (Behold the Man) and Ward Moore (Bring the Jubilee), classics.\n\nBut many of them were no more than elaborate chess games with no connection to reality or logic. It’s these Tenn is clearly responding to in stories like Me, Myself, and I, It Ends with a Flicker, and The Brooklyn Project, in which, as Fritz Leiber says, a trip to the past changes everything in the universe except (universal!) human nature with all its wearisome foibles and absurdities.\n\nAnd Tenn’s logic is unassailable. He knows full well that if we had time travel, we wouldn’t be able to resist messing with history. And that if we accidentally messed it up and went back to fix it, we’d have to contend not only with the mess, but with the self (or selves) who had gone back earlier. And our fantasy of meeting the historical figure we most admire is probably doomed to disappointment, human nature being what it is.\n\nTenn knows a lot about human nature. He knows that the person most likely to play Frankenstein is not a tortured genius but a person with an only partially formed personality himself, that revenge is a hard emotion to hang onto, that humans are frequently greedy, dishonest, easily gulled, and out for the main chance.\n\nThis last opinion is what gets Tenn his reputation as a cynic. He’s described as bitter, fundamentally a pessimist, and having an essentially bleak view of man.\n\nWell, of course it’s bleak. Who do you know that knows a lot about human nature and who has a high opinion of humankind? But I don’t agree that Tenn is cynical. Bernie the Faust may be a low-life, but he’s not venial enough to sell out his planet. The hero of Time in Advance doesn’t commit murder, even though he’s got ample justification and has already served his time. And the sergeant in Down Among the Dead Men is a far more decent person than most of us would be in his place, and so are the zombies.\n\nTrue, Frankenstein gets his, and so does the reporter in The Human Angle, but they both deserve it, and it’s nearly always the characters’ lust or acquisitiveness or conviction that they’re smarter than everybody else that gets them in the messes they find themselves in.\n\nAnd many of Tenn’s stories end far more happily than we expect. Lisa isn’t given up for adoption in A Man of Family, and the custodian manages not only to save the kid but the Mona Lisa and a piece of the Sistine Chapel.\n\nSome of his less-than-likeable narrators may also have been a response to the stalwart heroes and flawless heroines the genre is full of. And so many of his stories, like Everybody Loves Irving Bommer and Venus and the Seven Sexes were written in such a spirit of pure fun they couldn’t have been created by a humanity-hater.\n\nTenn’s stories are witty, clever, thought-provoking, ironic, intensely intelligent, touching, and hilarious. And too few and far between. Most of the stories in this collection were written in the fifties and sixties, and, until now, have been hard to find. I’m overjoyed that they will all be in print again and all in one place (though it’s also delightful to come across one in an anthology when you least expect it, and having him seduce or surprise or swindle you all over again), but I wish there were more of them.\n\nAnd I wish he’d write some new ones. (Are you listening, Phil?) I think there’s an excellent chance he might. As Damon Knight said of Tenn, he won’t stop till he’s had the last word.\n\nI hope so. Like Scheherazade’s sultan, I could go on listening to him all night.\n\nAliens, Aliens, Aliens\n\nFirewater\n\nThe hairiest, dirtiest and oldest of the three visitors from Arizona scratched his back against the plastic off the webfoam chair. Insinuations are lavender nearly, he remarked by way of opening the conversation.\n\nHis two companions—the thin young man with dripping eyes, and the woman whose good looks were marred chiefly by incredibly decayed teeth—giggled and relaxed. The thin young man said Gabble, gabble, honk! under his breath, and the other two nodded emphatically.\n\nGreta Seidenheim looked up from the tiny stenographic machine resting on a pair of the most exciting knees her employer had been able to find in Greater New York. She swiveled her blonde beauty at him. That too, Mr. Hebster?\n\nThe president of Hebster Securities, Inc., waited until the memory of her voice ceased to tickle his ears; he had much clear thinking to do. Then he nodded and said resonantly, That too, Miss Seidenheim. Close phonetic approximations of the gabble-honk and remember to indicate when it sounds like a question and when like an exclamation.\n\nHe rubbed his recently manicured fingernails across the desk drawer containing his fully loaded Parabellum. Check. The communication buttons with which he could summon any quantity of Hebster Securities personnel up to the nine hundred working at present in the Hebster Building lay some eight inches from the other hand. Check. And there were the doors here, the doors there, behind which his uniformed bodyguard stood poised to burst in at a signal which would blaze before them the moment his right foot came off the tiny spring set in the floor. And check.\n\nAlgernon Hebster could talk business—even with Primeys.\n\nCourteously, he nodded at each one of his visitors from Arizona; he smiled ruefully at what the dirty shapeless masses they wore on their feet were doing to the almost calf-deep rug that had been woven specially for his private office. He had greeted them when Miss Seidenheim had escorted them in. They had laughed in his face.\n\nSuppose we rattle off some introductions. You know me. I’m Hebster, Algernon Hebster—you asked for me specifically at the desk in the lobby. If it’s important to the conversation, my secretary’s name is Greta Seidenheim. And you, sir?\n\nHe had addressed the old fellow, but the thin young man leaned forward in his seat and held out a taut, almost transparent hand. Names? he inquired. \"Names are round if not revealed. Consider names. How many names? Consider names, reconsider names!\"\n\nThe woman leaned forward too, and the smell from her diseased mouth reached Hebster even across the enormous space of his office. Rabble and reaching and all the upward clash, she intoned, spreading her hands as if in agreement with an obvious point. Emptiness derogating itself into infinity—\n\nInto duration, the older man corrected.\n\nInto infinity, the woman insisted.\n\nGabble, gabble, honk? the young man queried bitterly.\n\nListen! Hebster roared. When I asked for—\n\nThe communicator buzzed and he drew a deep breath and pressed a button. His receptionist’s voice boiled out rapidly, fearfully:\n\nI remember your orders, Mr. Hebster, but those two men from the UM Special Investigating Commission are here again and they look as if they mean business. I mean they look as if they’ll make trouble.\n\nYost and Funatti?\n\nYes, sir. From what they said to each other, I think they know you have three Primeys in there. They asked me what are you trying to do—deliberately inflame the Firsters? They said they’re going to invoke full supranational powers and force an entry if you don’t—\n\nStall them.\n\n\"But, Mr. Hebster, the UM Special Investigating—\"\n\n\"Stall them, I said. Are you a receptionist or a swinging door? Use your imagination, Ruth. You have a nine-hundred-man organization and a ten-million-dollar corporation at your disposal. You can stage any kind of farce in that outer office you want—up to and including the deal where some actor made up to look like me walks in and drops dead at their feet. Stall them and I’ll nod a bonus at you. Stall them.\" He clicked off, looked up.\n\nHis visitors, at least, were having a fine time. They had turned to face each other in a reeking triangle of gibberish. Their voices rose and fell argumentatively, pleadingly, decisively; but all Algernon Hebster’s ears could register of what they said were very many sounds similar to gabble and an occasional, indisputable honk!\n\nHis lips curled contempt inward. Humanity Prime! These messes? Then he lit a cigarette and shrugged. Oh, well. Humanity Prime. And business is business.\n\nJust remember they’re not supermen, he told himself. They may be dangerous, but they’re not supermen. Not by a long shot. Remember that epidemic of influenza that almost wiped them out, and how you diddled those two other Primeys last month. They’re not supermen, but they’re not humanity either. They’re just different.\n\nHe glanced at his secretary and approved. Greta Seidenheim clacked away on her machine as if she were recording the curtest, the tritest of business letters. He wondered what system she was using to catch the intonations. Trust Greta, though, she’d do it.\n\nGabble, honk! Gabble, gabble, gabble, honk, honk. Gabble, honk, gabble, gabble, honk? Honk.\n\nWhat had precipitated all this conversation? He’d only asked for their names. Didn’t they use names in Arizona? Surely, they knew that it was customary here. They claimed to know at least as much as he about such matters.\n\nMaybe it was something else that had brought them to New York this time—maybe something about the Aliens? He felt the short hairs rise on the back of his neck and he smoothed them down self-consciously.\n\nTrouble was it was so easy to learn their language. It was such a very simple matter to be able to understand them in these talkative moments. Almost as easy as falling off a log—or jumping off a cliff.\n\nWell, his time was limited. He didn’t know how long Ruth could hold the UM investigators in his outer office. Somehow he had to get a grip on the meeting again without offending them in any of the innumerable, highly dangerous ways in which Primeys could be offended.\n\nHe rapped the desk top—gently. The gabble-honk stopped short at the hyphen. The woman rose slowly.\n\nOn this question of names, Hebster began doggedly, keeping his eyes on the woman, since you people claim—\n\nThe woman writhed agonizingly for a moment and sat down on the floor. She smiled at Hebster. With her rotted teeth, the smile had all the brilliance of a dead star.\n\nHebster cleared his throat and prepared to try again.\n\nIf you want names, the older man said suddenly, you can call me Larry.\n\nThe president of Hebster Securities shook himself and managed to say Thanks in a somewhat weak but not too surprised voice. He looked at the thin young man.\n\nYou can call me Theseus. The young man looked sad as he said it.\n\nTheseus? Fine! One thing about Primeys, when you started clicking with them, you really moved along. But Theseus! Wasn’t that just like a Primey? Now the woman, and they could begin.\n\nThey were all looking at the woman, even Greta with a curiosity which had sneaked up past her beauty-parlor glaze.\n\nName, the woman whispered to herself. Name a name.\n\nOh, no, Hebster groaned. Let’s not stall here.\n\nLarry evidently had decided that enough time had been wasted. He made a suggestion to the woman. Why not call yourself Moe?\n\nThe young man—Theseus, it was now—also seemed to get interested in the problem. Rover’s a good name, he announced helpfully.\n\nHow about Gloria? Hebster asked desperately.\n\nThe woman considered. Moe, Rover, Gloria, she mused. Larry, Theseus, Seidenheim, Hebster, me. She seemed to be running a total.\n\nAnything might come out, Hebster knew. But at least they were not acting snobbish any more: they were talking down on his level now. Not only no gabble-honk, but none of this sneering double-talk which was almost worse. At least they were making sense—of a sort.\n\nFor the purposes of this discussion, the woman said at last, \"my name will be…will be— My name is S.S. Lusitania.\"\n\nFine! Hebster roared, letting the word he’d kept bubbling on his lips burst out. \"That’s a fine name. Larry, Theseus and…er, S.S. Lusitania. Fine bunch of people. Sound. Let’s get down to business. You came here on business, I take it?\"\n\nRight, Larry said. We heard about you from two others who left home a month ago to come to New York. They talked about you when they got back to Arizona.\n\nThey did, eh? I hoped they would.\n\nTheseus slid off his chair and squatted next to the woman who was making plucking motions at the air. They talked about you, he repeated. They said you treated them very well, that you showed them as much respect as a thing like you could generate. They also said you cheated them.\n\nOh, well, Theseus. Hebster spread his manicured hands. I’m a businessman.\n\nYou’re a businessman, S.S. Lusitania agreed, getting to her feet stealthily and taking a great swipe with both hands at something invisible in front of her face. \"And here, in this spot, at this moment, so are we. You can have what we’ve brought, but you’ll pay for it. And don’t think you can cheat us.\"\n\nHer hands, cupped over each other, came down to her waist. She pulled them apart suddenly and a tiny eagle fluttered out. It flapped toward the fluorescent panels glowing in the ceiling. Its flight was hampered by the heavy, striped shield upon its breast, by the bunch of arrows it held in one claw, by the olive branch it grasped with the other. It turned its miniature bald head and gasped at Algernon Hebster, then began to drift rapidly down to the rug. Just before it hit the floor, it disappeared.\n\nHebster shut his eyes, remembering the strip of bunting that had fallen from the eagle’s beak when it had turned to gasp. There had been words printed on the bunting, words too small to see at the distance, but he was sure the words would have read E Pluribus Unum. He was as certain of that as he was of the necessity of acting unconcerned over the whole incident, as unconcerned as the Primeys. Professor Kleimbocher said Primeys were mental drunkards. But why did they give everyone else the D.T.s?\n\nHe opened his eyes. Well, he said, what have you to sell?\n\nSilence for a moment. Theseus seemed to forget the point he was trying to make; S.S. Lusitania stared at Larry.\n\nLarry scratched his right side through heavy, stinking cloth.\n\n\"Oh, an infallible method for defeating anyone who attempts to apply the reductio ad absurdum to a reasonable proposition you advance.\" He yawned smugly and began scratching his left side.\n\nHebster grinned because he was feeling so good. No. Can’t use it.\n\nCan’t use it? The old man was trying hard to look amazed. He shook his head. He stole a sideways glance at S.S. Lusitania.\n\nShe smiled again and wriggled to the floor. Larry still isn’t talking a language you can understand, Mr. Hebster, she cooed, very much like a fertilizer factory being friendly. We came here with something we know you need badly. Very badly.\n\nYes? They’re like those two Primeys last month, Hebster exulted: they don’t know what’s good and what isn’t. Wonder if their masters would know. Well, and if they did—who does business with Aliens?\n\nWe…have, she spaced the words carefully, trying pathetically for a dramatic effect, \"a new shade of red, but not merely that. Oh, no! A new shade of red, and a full set of color values derived from it! A complete set of color values derived from this one shade of red, Mr. Hebster! Think what a non-objectivist painter can do with such a—\"\n\nDon’t sell me, lady. Theseus, do you want to have a go now?\n\nTheseus had been frowning at the green foundation of the desk. He leaned back, looking satisfied. Hebster realized abruptly that the tension under his right foot had disappeared. Somehow, Theseus had become cognizant of the signal-spring set in the floor; and, somehow, he had removed it.\n\nHe had disintegrated it without setting off the alarm to which it was wired.\n\nGiggles from three Primey throats and a rapid exchange of gabble-honk. Then they all knew what Theseus had done and how Hebster had tried to protect himself. They weren’t angry, though—and they didn’t sound triumphant. Try to understand Primey behavior!\n\nNo need to get unduly alarmed—the price of dealing with these characters was a nervous stomach. The rewards, on the other hand—\n\nAbruptly, they were businesslike again.\n\nTheseus snapped out his suggestion with all the finality of a bazaar merchant making his last, absolutely the last offer. A set of population indices which can be correlated with—\n\nNo, Theseus, Hebster told him gently.\n\nThen, while Hebster sat back and enjoyed, temporarily forgetting the missing coil under his foot, they poured out more, desperately, feverishly, weaving in and out of each other’s sentences.\n\nA portable neutron stabilizer for high altit—\n\nMore than fifty ways of saying ‘however’ without—\n\n\"…So that every housewife can do an entrechat while cook—\"\n\n…Synthetic fabric with the drape of silk and manufactura—\n\n…Decorative pattern for bald heads using the follicles as—\n\n…Complete and utter refutation of all pyramidologists from—\n\nAll right! Hebster roared, \"All right! That’s enough!\"\n\nGreta Seidenheim almost forgot herself and sighed with relief. Her stenographic machine had been sounding like a centrifuge.\n\nNow, said the executive. What do you want in exchange?\n\nOne of those we said is the one you want, eh? Larry muttered. Which one—the pyramidology refutation? That’s it, I betcha.\n\nS.S. Lusitania waved her hands contemptuously. Bishop’s miters, you fool! The new red color values excited him. The new—\n\nRuth’s voice came over the communicator. Mr. Hebster, Yost and Funatti are back. I stalled them, but I just received word from the lobby receptionist that they’re back and on their way upstairs. You have two minutes, maybe three. And they’re so mad they almost look like Firsters themselves!\n\nThanks. When they climb out of the elevator, do what you can without getting too illegal. He turned to his guests. Listen—\n\nThey had gone off again.\n\n\"Gabble, gabble, honk, honk, honk? Gabble, honk, gabble, gabble! Gabble, honk, gabble, honk, gabble, honk, honk.\"\n\nCould they honestly make sense out of these throat-clearings and half-sneezes? Was it really a language as superior to all previous languages of man as…as the Aliens were supposed to be to man himself? Well, at least they could communicate with the Aliens by means of it. And the Aliens, the Aliens—\n\nHe recollected abruptly the two angry representatives of the world state who were hurtling towards his office.\n\n\"Listen, friends. You came here to sell. You’ve shown me your stock, and I’ve seen something I’d like to buy. What exactly is immaterial. The only question now is what you want for it. And let’s make it fast. I have some other business to transact.\"\n\nThe woman with the dental nightmare stamped her foot. A cloud no larger than a man’s hand formed near the ceiling, burst and deposited a pailful of water on Hebster’s fine custom-made rug.\n\nHe ran a manicured forefinger around the inside of his collar so that his bulging neck veins would not burst. Not right now, anyway. He looked at Greta and regained confidence from the serenity with which she waited for more conversation to transcribe. There was a model of business precision for you. The Primeys might pull what one of them had in London two years ago, before they were barred from all metropolitan areas—increased a housefly’s size to that of an elephant—and Greta Seidenheim would go on separating fragments of conversation into the appropriate shorthand symbols.\n\nWith all their power, why didn’t they take what they wanted? Why trudge wearisome miles to cities and attempt to smuggle themselves into illegal audiences with operators like Hebster, when most of them were caught easily and sent back to the reservation and those that weren’t were cheated unmercifully by the straight humans they encountered? Why didn’t they just blast their way in, take their weird and pathetic prizes and toddle back to their masters? For that matter, why didn’t their masters— But Primey psych was Primey psych—not for this world, nor of it.\n\nWe’ll tell you what we want in exchange, Larry began in the middle of a honk. He held up a hand on which the length of the fingernails was indicated graphically by the grime beneath them and began to tot up the items, bending a digit for each item. \"First, a hundred paper-bound copies of Melville’s Moby Dick. Then, twenty-five crystal radio sets, with earphones; two earphones for each set. Then, two Empire State Buildings or three Radio Cities, whichever is more convenient. We want those with foundations intact. A reasonably good copy of the Hermes statue by Praxiteles. And an electric toaster, circa 1941. That’s about all, isn’t it, Theseus?\"\n\nTheseus bent over until his nose rested against his knees.\n\nHebster groaned. The list wasn’t as bad as he’d expected—remarkable the way their masters always yearned for the electric gadgets and artistic achievements of Earth—but he had so little time to bargain with them. Two Empire State Buildings!\n\nMr. Hebster, his receptionist chattered over the communicator. Those SIC men— I managed to get a crowd out in the corridor to push toward their elevator when it came to this floor, and I’ve locked the…I mean I’m trying to…but I don’t think— Can you—\n\nGood girl! You’re doing fine!\n\nIs that all we want, Theseus? Larry asked again. Gabble?\n\nHebster heard a crash in the outer office and footsteps running across the floor.\n\nSee here, Mr. Hebster, Theseus said at last, \"if you don’t want to buy Larry’s reductio ad absurdum exploder, and you don’t like my method of decorating bald heads for all its innate artistry, how about a system of musical notation—\"\n\nSomebody tried Hebster’s door, found it locked. There was a knock on the door, repeated almost immediately with more urgency.\n\n\"He’s already found something he wants, S.S. Lusitania snapped. Yes, Larry, that was the complete list.\"\n\nHebster plucked a handful of hair from his already receding forehead. Good! Now, look, I can give you everything but the two Empire State Buildings and the three Radio Cities.\n\n\"Or the three Radio Cities, Larry corrected. Don’t try to cheat us! Two Empire State Buildings or three Radio Cities. Whichever is more convenient. Why…isn’t it worth that to you?\"\n\nOpen this door! a bull-mad voice yelled. Open this door in the name of United Mankind!\n\nMiss Seidenheim, open the door, Hebster said loudly and winked at his secretary, who rose, stretched and began a thoughtful, slow-motion study in the direction of the locked panel. There was a crash as of a pair of shoulders being thrown against it. Hebster knew that his office door could withstand a medium-sized tank. But there was a limit even to delay when it came to fooling around with the UM Special Investigating Commission. Those boys knew their Primeys and their Primey-dealers; they were empowered to shoot first and ask questions afterwards—as the questions occurred to them.\n\nIt’s not a matter of whether it’s worth my while, Hebster told them rapidly as he shepherded them to the exit behind his desk. For reasons I’m sure you aren’t interested in, I just can’t give away two Empire State Buildings and/or three Radio Cities with foundations intact—not at the moment. I’ll give you the rest of it, and—\n\nOpen this door or we start blasting it down!\n\nPlease, gentlemen, please, Greta Seidenheim told them sweetly. You’ll kill a poor working girl who’s trying awfully hard to let you in. The lock’s stuck. She fiddled with the door knob, watching Hebster with a trace of anxiety in her fine eyes.\n\nAnd to replace those items, Hebster was going on, I will—\n\nWhat I mean, Theseus broke in, is this. You know the greatest single difficulty composers face in the twelve-tone technique?\n\nI can offer you, the executive continued doggedly, sweat bursting out of his skin like spring freshets, complete architectural blueprints of the Empire State Building and Radio City, plus five…no, I’ll make it ten…scale models of each. And you get the rest of the stuff you asked for. That’s it. Take it or leave it. Fast!\n\nThey glanced at each other, as Hebster threw the exit door open and gestured to the five liveried bodyguards waiting near his private elevator. \"Done,\" they said in unison.\n\nGood! Hebster almost squeaked. He pushed them through the doorway and said to the tallest of the five men: Nineteenth floor!\n\nHe slammed the exit shut just as Miss Seidenheim opened the outer office door. Yost and Funatti, in the bottle-green uniform of the UM, charged through. Without pausing, they ran to where Hebster stood and plucked the exit open. They could all hear the elevator descending.\n\nFunatti, a little, olive-skinned man, sniffed. Primeys, he muttered. He had Primeys here, all right. Smell that unwash, Yost?\n\nYeah, said the bigger man. Come on. The emergency stairway. We can track that elevator!\n\nThey holstered their service weapons and clattered down the metal-tipped stairs. Below, the elevator stopped.\n\nHebster’s secretary was at the communicator. Maintenance! She waited. Maintenance, automatic locks on the nineteenth floor exit until the party Mr. Hebster just sent down gets to a lab somewhere else. And keep apologizing to those cops until then. Remember, they’re SIC.\n\nThanks, Greta, Hebster said, switching to the personal now that they were alone. He plumped into his desk chair and blew out gustily: There must be easier ways of making a million.\n\nShe raised two perfect blond eyebrows. Or of being an absolute monarch right inside the parliament of man?\n\nIf they wait long enough, he told her lazily, \"I’ll be the UM, modern global government and all. Another year or two might do it.\"\n\nAren’t you forgetting Vandermeer Dempsey? His huskies also want to replace the UM. Not to mention their colorful plans for you. And there are an awful, awful lot of them.\n\n\"They don’t worry me, Greta. Humanity First will dissolve overnight once that decrepit old demagogue gives up the ghost. He stabbed at the communicator button. Maintenance! Maintenance, that party I sent down arrived at a safe lab yet?\"\n\nNo, Mr. Hebster. But everything’s going all right. We sent them up to the twenty-fourth floor and got the SIC men rerouted downstairs to the personnel levels. Uh, Mr. Hebster—about the SIC. We take your orders and all that, but none of us wants to get in trouble with the Special Investigating Commission. According to the latest laws, it’s practically a capital offense to obstruct them.\n\nDon’t worry, Hebster told him. I’ve never let one of my employees down yet. The boss fixes everything is the motto here. Call me when you’ve got those Primeys safely hidden and ready for questioning.\n\nHe turned back to Greta. Get that stuff typed before you leave and into Professor Kleimbocher’s hands. He thinks he may have a new angle on their gabble-honk.\n\nShe nodded. I wish you could use recording apparatus instead of making me sit over an old-fashioned click-box.\n\nSo do I. But Primeys enjoy reaching out and putting a hex on electrical apparatus—when they aren’t collecting it for the Aliens. I had a raft of tape recorders busted in the middle of Primey interviews before I decided that human stenos were the only answer. And a Primey may get around to bollixing them some day.\n\nCheerful thought. I must remember to dream about the possibility some cold night. Well, I should complain, she muttered as she went into her own little office. Primey hexes built this business and pay my salary as well as supply me with the sparkling little knicknacks I love so well.\n\nThat was not quite true, Hebster remembered as he sat waiting for the communicator to buzz the news of his recent guests’ arrival in a safe lab. Something like ninety-five percent of Hebster Securities had been built out of Primey gadgetry extracted from them in various fancy deals, but the base of it all had been the small investment bank he had inherited from his father, back in the days of the Half-War—the days when the Aliens had first appeared on Earth.\n\nThe fearfully intelligent dots swirling in their variously shaped multicolored bottles were completely outside the pale of human understanding. There had been no way at all to communicate with them for a time.\n\nA humorist had remarked back in those early days that the Aliens came not to bury man, not to conquer or enslave him. They had a truly dreadful mission—to ignore him!\n\nNo one knew, even today, what part of the galaxy the Aliens came from. Or why. No one knew what the total of their small visiting population came to. Or how they operated their wide-open and completely silent spaceships. The few things that had been discovered about them on the occasions when they deigned to swoop down and examine some human enterprise, with the aloof amusement of the highly civilized tourist, had served to confirm a technological superiority over Man that strained and tore the capacity of his richest imagination. A sociological treatise Hebster had read recently suggested that they operated from concepts as far in advance of modern science as a meteorologist sowing a drought-struck area with dry ice was beyond the primitive agriculturist blowing a ram’s horn at the heavens in a frantic attempt to wake the slumbering gods of rain.\n\nProlonged, infinitely dangerous observation had revealed, for example, that the dots-in-bottles seemed to have developed past the need for prepared tools of any sort. They worked directly on the material itself, shaping it to need, evidently creating and destroying matter at will.\n\nSome humans had communicated with them—\n\nThey didn’t stay human.\n\nMen with superb brains had looked into the whirring, flickering settlements established by the outsiders. A few had returned with tales of wonders they had realized dimly and not quite seen. Their descriptions always sounded as if their eyes had been turned off at the most crucial moments or a mental fuse had blown just this side of understanding.\n\nOthers—such celebrities as a President of Earth, a three-time winner of the Nobel Prize, famous poets—had evidently broken through the fence somehow. These, however, were the ones who didn’t return. They stayed in the Alien settlements of the Gobi, the Sahara, the American Southwest. Barely able to fend for themselves, despite newly acquired and almost unbelievable powers, they shambled worshipfully around the outsiders, speaking, with weird writhings of larynx and nasal passage, what was evidently a human approximation of their masters’ language—a kind of pidgin Alien. Talking with a Primey, someone had said, was like a blind man trying to read a page of Braille originally written for an octopus.\n\nAnd that these bearded, bug-ridden, stinking derelicts, these chattering wrecks drunk and sodden on the logic of an entirely different life-form, were the absolute best of the human race didn’t help people’s egos any.\n\nHumans and Primeys despised each other almost from the first: humans for Primey subservience and helplessness in human terms, Primeys for human ignorance and ineptness in Alien terms. And, except when operating under Alien orders and through barely legal operators like Hebster, Primeys didn’t communicate with humans any more than their masters did.\n\nWhen institutionalized, they either gabble-honked themselves into an early grave or, losing patience suddenly, they might dissolve a path to freedom right through the walls of the asylum and any attendants who chanced to be in the way. Therefore the enthusiasm of sheriff and deputy, nurse and orderly, had waned considerably and the forcible incarceration of Primeys had almost ceased.\n\nSince the two groups were so far apart psychologically as to make mating between them impossible, the ragged miracle-workers had been honored with the status of a separate classification:\n\nHumanity Prime. Not better than humanity, not necessarily worse—but different, and dangerous.\n\nWhat made them that way? Hebster rolled his chair back and examined the hole in the floor from which the alarm spring had spiraled. Theseus had disintegrated it—how? With a thought? Telekinesis, say, applied to all the molecules of the metal simultaneously, making them move rapidly and at random. Or possibly he had merely moved the spring somewhere else. Where? In space? In hyperspace? In time? Hebster shook his head and pulled himself back to the efficiently smooth and sanely useful desk surface.\n\nMr. Hebster? the communicator inquired abruptly, and he jumped a bit, this is Margritt of General Lab 23b. Your Primeys just arrived. Regular check?\n\nRegular check meant drawing them out on every conceivable technical subject by the nine specialists in the general laboratory. This involved firing questions at them with the rapidity of a police interrogation, getting them off balance and keeping them there in the hope that a useful and unexpected bit of scientific knowledge would drop.\n\nYes, Hebster told him. Regular check. But first let a textile man have a whack at them. In fact, let him take charge of the check.\n\nA pause. The only textile man in this section is Charlie Verus.\n\nWell? Hebster asked in mild irritation. Why put it like that? He’s competent, I hope. What does Personnel say about him?\n\nPersonnel says he’s competent.\n\nThen there you are. Look, Margritt, I have the SIC running around my building with blood in its enormous eye. I don’t have time to muse over your departmental feuds. Put Verus on.\n\nYes, Mr. Hebster. Hey, Bert! Get Charlie Verus. Him.\n\nHebster shook his head and chuckled. These technicians! Verus was probably brilliant and nasty.\n\nThe box crackled again: Mr. Hebster? Mr. Verus. The voice expressed boredom to the point of obvious affectation. But the man was probably good despite his neuroses. Hebster Securities, Inc., had a first-rate personnel department.\n\nVerus? Those Primeys, I want you to take charge of the check. One of them knows how to make a synthetic fabric with the drape of silk. Get that first and then go after anything else they have.\n\nPrimeys, Mr. Hebster?\n\nI said Primeys, Mr. Verus. You are a textile technician, please to remember, and not the straight or ping-pong half of a comedy routine. Get humping. I want a report on that synthetic fabric by tomorrow. Work all night if you have to.\n\n\"Before we do, Mr. Hebster, you might be interested in a small piece of information. There is already in existence a synthetic which falls better than silk—\"\n\nI know, his employer told him shortly. Cellulose acetate. Unfortunately, it has a few disadvantages: low melting point, tends to crack; separate and somewhat inferior dyestuffs have to be used for it; poor chemical resistance. Am I right?\n\nThere was no immediate answer, but Hebster could feel the dazed nod. He went on. \"Now, we also have protein fibers. They dye well and fall well, have the thermo-conductivity control necessary for wearing apparel, but don’t have the tensile strength of synthetic fabrics. An artificial protein fiber might be the answer: it would drape as well as silk, might be we could use the acid dyestuffs we use on silk which result in shades that dazzle female customers and cause them to fling wide their pocketbooks. There are a lot of ifs in that, I know, but one of those Primeys said something about a synthetic with the drape of silk, and I don’t think he’d be sane enough to be referring to cellulose acetate. Nor nylon, orlon, vinyl chloride, or anything else we already have and use.\"\n\nYou’ve looked into textile problems, Mr. Hebster.\n\nI have. I’ve looked into everything to which there are big gobs of money attached. And now suppose you go look into those Primeys. Several million women are waiting breathlessly for the secrets concealed in their beards. Do you think, Verus, that with the personal and scientific background I’ve just given you, it’s possible you might now get around to doing the job you are paid to do?\n\nUm-m-m. Yes.\n\nHebster walked to the office closet and got his hat and coat. He liked working under pressure; he liked to see people jump up straight whenever he barked. And now, he liked the prospect of relaxing.\n\nHe grimaced at the webfoam chair that Larry had used. No point in having it resquirted. Have a new one made.\n\nI’ll be at the University, he told Ruth on his way out. You can reach me through Professor Kleimbocher. But don’t, unless it’s very important. He gets unpleasantly annoyed when he’s interrupted.\n\nShe nodded. Then, very hesitantly: Those two men—Yost and Funatti—from the Special Investigating Commission? They said no one would be allowed to leave the building.\n\nDid they now? he chuckled. I think they were angry. They’ve been that way before. But unless and until they can hang something on me— And Ruth, tell my bodyguard to go home, except for the man with the Primeys. He’s to check with me, wherever I am, every two hours.\n\nHe ambled out, being careful to smile benevolently at every third executive and fifth typist in the large office. A private elevator and entrance were all very well for an occasional crisis, but Hebster liked to taste his successes in as much public as possible.\n\nIt would be good to see Kleimbocher again. He had a good deal of faith in the linguistic approach; grants from his corporation had tripled the size of the University’s philology department. After all, the basic problem between man and Primey as well as man and Alien was one of communication. Any attempt to learn their science, to adjust their mental processes and logic into safer human channels, would have to be preceded by understanding.\n\nIt was up to Kleimbocher to find that understanding, not him. I’m Hebster, he thought. \"I employ the people who solve problems. And then I make money off them.\"\n\nSomebody got in front of him. Somebody else took his arm. I’m Hebster, he repeated automatically, but out loud. \"Algernon Hebster.\"\n\nExactly the Hebster we want, Funatti said, holding tightly on to his arm. You don’t mind coming along with us?\n\nIs this an arrest? Hebster asked Yost, who now moved aside to let him pass. Yost was touching his holstered weapon with dancing fingertips.\n\nThe SIC man shrugged. Why ask such questions? he countered. Just come along and be sociable, kind of. People want to talk to you.\n\nHe allowed himself to be dragged through the lobby ornate with murals by radical painters and nodded appreciation at the doorman who, staring right through his captors, said enthusiastically, \"Good afternoon, Mr. Hebster.\" He made himself fairly comfortable on the back seat of the dark-green SIC car, a late-model Hebster Mono-wheel.\n\nSurprised to see you minus your bodyguard, Yost, who was driving, remarked over his shoulder.\n\nOh, I gave them the day off.\n\nAs soon as you were through with the Primeys? No, Funatti admitted, we never did find out where you cached them. That’s one big building you own, mister. And the UM Special Investigating Commission is notoriously understaffed.\n\nNot forgetting it’s also notoriously underpaid, Yost broke in.\n\nI couldn’t forget that if I tried, Funatti assured him. You know, Mr. Hebster, I wouldn’t have sent my bodyguard off if I’d been in your shoes. Right now there’s something about five times as dangerous as Primeys after you. I mean Humanity Firsters.\n\nVandermeer Dempsey’s crackpots? Thanks, but I think I’ll survive.\n\n\"That’s all right. Just don’t give any long odds on the proposition. Those people have been expanding fast and furious. The Evening Humanitarian alone has a tremendous circulation. And when you figure their weekly newspapers, their penny booklets and throwaway handbills, it adds up to an impressive amount of propaganda. Day after day they bang away editorially at the people who’re making money off the Aliens and Primeys. Of course, they’re really hitting at the UM, like always, but if an ordinary Firster met you on the street, he’d be as likely to cut your heart out as not. Not interested? Sorry. Well, maybe you’ll like this. The Evening Humanitarian has a cute name for you.\"\n\nYost guffawed. Tell him, Funatti.\n\nThe corporation president looked at the little man inquiringly.\n\nThey call you, Funatti said with great savoring deliberation, they call you an interplanetary pimp!\n\nEmerging at last from the crosstown underpass, they sped up the very latest addition to the strangling city’s facilities—the East Side Air-Floating Super-Duper Highway, known familiarly as Dive-Bomber Drive. At the Forty-Second Street offway, the busiest road exit in Manhattan, Yost failed to make a traffic signal. He cursed absent-mindedly, and Hebster found himself nodding the involuntary passenger’s agreement. They watched the elevator section dwindling downward as the cars that were to mount the highway spiraled up from the right. Between the two, there rose and fell the steady platforms of harbor traffic while, stacked like so many decks of cards, the pedestrian stages awaited their turn below.\n\nLook! Up there, straight ahead! See it?\n\nHebster and Funatti followed Yost’s long, waggling forefinger with their eyes. Two hundred feet north of the offway and almost a quarter of a mile straight up, a brown object hung in obvious fascination. Every once in a while a brilliant blue dot would enliven the heavy murk imprisoned in its bell-jar shape only to twirl around the side and be replaced by another.\n\nEyes? You think they’re eyes? Funatti asked, rubbing his small dark fists against each other futilely. \"I know what the scientists say—that every dot is equivalent to one person and the whole bottle is like a family or a city, maybe. But how do they know? It’s a theory, a guess. I say they’re eyes.\"\n\nYost hunched his great body half out of the open window and shaded his vision with his uniform cap against the sun. Look at it, they heard him say, over his shoulder. A nasal twang, long-buried, came back into his voice as heaving emotion shook out its cultivated accents. \"A-setting up there, a-staring and a-staring. So all-fired interested in how we get on and off a busy highway! Won’t pay us no never mind when we try to talk to it, when we try to find out what it wants, where it comes from, who it is. Oh, no! It’s too superior to talk to the likes of us! But it can watch us, hours on end, days without end, light and dark, winter and summer; it can watch us going about our business; and every time we dumb two-legged animals try to do something we find complicated, along comes a blasted ‘dots-in-bottle’ to watch and sneer and—\"\n\nHey there, man, Funatti leaned forward and tugged at his partner’s green jerkin. Easy! We’re SIC, on business.\n\nAll the same, Yost grunted wistfully, as he plopped back into his seat and pressed the power button, I wish I had Daddy’s little old M-1 Garand right now. They bowled forward, smoothed into the next long elevator section and started to descend. \"It would be worth the risk of getting pinged.\"\n\nAnd this was a UM man, Hebster reflected with acute discomfort.
