        "text": "Hours and Policies\n\nWe try our best to accommodate our patients as much as possible when scheduling appointments. We have found that children with extensive dental work or preschool children are better to be seen early in the morning when they are fresher and can have a more positive experience.\n\nWe are available by phone Monday-Thursday.\n\nWe request 24-hours notice if you need to cancel your appointment. We are aware that unforeseen events sometimes require missing an appointment, but we ask for your help as a courtesy to all of our families.\n\nWe accept most insurance. We accept Medicaid/TNCare only with referrals from General Dentists. Our office is committed to helping you maximize your insurance benefits. Because insurance policies vary greatly, we can only estimate your coverage in good faith but cannot guarantee coverage due to the complexities of insurance contracts. Your estimated patient portion must be paid at the time of service. As a service to our patients, we will bill your insurance.\n\nOur mission is to provide affordable,\n\ntop-quality treatment.\n\nWe offer a variety of payment options to meet your needs such as Medicaid, Visa, MasterCard, and CareCredit. We thoroughly explain your options, so that we can accommodate your financial situation.\n\nOur courteous team is always available for questions at 731.664.0080.\n\nDr. Williams and Dr. McCarter are a pediatric dentists, they specialize in the treatment and prevention of dental disease, as well as the overall oral health of children. Through extra years of schooling, training, experience, and certification, a pediatric dentist is uniquely qualified to treat the dental needs of infants, children, adolescents and those with special healthcare needs.\n\nWhy Choose a Pediatric Dentist?\n\nA pediatric patient not only has a different dentition than adults but he/she may have specific dental and behavioral needs that are unique to a child. These needs may include orthodontics, dental sealants, fluoride applications or home treatments, or just simply education in oral hygiene. In addition to treating existing dental problems, our office focuses on prevention through patient and parent education.\n\nWe like to feel that you and your child do not come to our office to have their âcavities fixedâ but rather to prevent them. Our mission is to provide all of the educational tools necessary for our patients to enjoy a cavity-free future.\n\nPreventive Oral Hygiene Instruction:\n\nThis includes proper brushing, flossing and eating habits, ideal fluoride levels and the use of pit and fissure sealants. We strive to provide a fun, educational environment where children learn about the importance of good dental hygiene.\n\nRestorative Dentistry:\n\nThis includes childrenâs fillings, crowns and prosthesis, including treatment of the often devastating nursing bottle decay. Our doctors are committed to discussing all options before these procedures and answering all questions you may have. Always working for the goal of a healthy smile is their priority.\n\nGrowth and Development & Braces:\n\nAs pediatric dental specialists, Dr. Williams and Dr. McCarter are experts on the growth and development of childrenâs dentition, jaws and craniofacial structures. Our doctorsâ young smile evaluation may provide your child with a more positive experience should they need orthodontic treatment."
