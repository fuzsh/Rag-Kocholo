        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Vanderbilt’s Andrew Dutkanych IV was drafted in the seventh round by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2024 MLB Draft with the 201st overall pick Monday.\n\nDutkanych made five appearances in an injury-shortened sophomore season in 2024. The righty totaled 14 strikeouts over 10.2 innings. He got the start against Eastern Kentucky on February 21, going 4.0 innings with six strikeouts.\n\nFor his career, the Indiana native has tallied 20 strikeouts over 17 innings with a 1-0 record and a 3.82 ERA.\n\nAll-time, Vanderbilt has more than 200 players selected in the MLB Draft including an NCAA-leading 149 since 2003.\n\nDutkanych is the fourth Commodore taken in the 2024 MLB Draft after Bryce Cunningham was selected by the Yankees and Carter Holton was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the second round and Greysen Carter was drafted by the Yankees in the fifth round."
