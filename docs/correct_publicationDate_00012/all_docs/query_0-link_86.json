        "text": "As William Tenn, Klass's first story – Alexander the Bait – appeared in Astounding Science Fiction in 1946, the first of more than 200 he wrote in a 60-year career. Many were written in the 1950s, a decade in which science fiction acquired some literary legitimacy.\n\nOften darkly satirical, his work appeared in other sci-fi magazines like Galaxy, and attracted critical attention from, among others, the British novelist Kingsley Amis, who cited Klass's work in his survey of American sci-fi New Maps of Hell (1961).\n\nAmis particularly commended Tenn's satire on mediocrity, Null-P, in which after an atomic war George Abnego is elected to the White House, the only man in America who incarnates the statistical average down to the state and number of the teeth in his mouth; Amis praised Tenn's \"sprightliness and an obvious delight in invention that typifies much of the best contemporary science fiction\".\n\n\"He wore a dark, rumpled suit,\" Morrell recalled. \"He had wiry, salt-and-pepper hair and a matching goatee. One hand gripped a coffee cup, the other a pipe, while an arm held a book and a bunch of letters under it.\"\n\nAlthough Morrell was not enrolled on his course, Klass gave him advice and encouragement. \" ... if not for Philip Klass and my determination to be a fiction writer, a recent edition of the Oxford English Dictionary wouldn't have cited this novel as the source for the creation of a word,\" Morrell noted in a later edition of First Blood.\n\nPhilip Klass was born in London on May 9 1920. His Jewish father, a tinsmith and dedicated Marxist, had left his native Russia for a new life in the United States, and had met his English mother, the daughter of a Whitechapel tailor and a fervent monarchist, on the way.\n\nThe couple emigrated to the United States when Phil was two and he grew up in New York in \"a moderately genteel Brooklyn slum\". During the Second World War he served in the US Army as a combat engineer in Europe, and started writing fiction during the lengthy commute to his postwar day job as a technical editor with an Air Force radar and radio laboratory in New Jersey.\n\nKlass wrote prolifically in many genres – science fiction, mystery and romance – and used different pen names for each. As William Tenn he sold dozens of short sci-fi stories.\n\nCollections of his short fiction have recently been published as Immodest Proposals and Here Comes Civilization. As William Tenn he also wrote two novels, Of Men and Monsters and A Lamp for Medusa (both 1968), and, as Philip Klass, a semi-autobiography Dancing Naked (2004).\n\nDuring the 1950s and early 1960s, Klass and his wife Fruma lived in Greenwich Village and mixed with a bohemian set of up-and-coming writers. One, Daniel Keyes, told him that an editor wanted him to change the downbeat ending of his short story Flowers for Algernon to a happy one.\n\n\"If you change one word of that story,\" Klass replied, \"I'll go break the editor's kneecaps.\" Keyes kept the ending, and his story not only went on to be published, but also to win several awards. It subsequently became a film.\n\nAt Penn State University, where he taught from the 1960s until the 1980s, Klass was one of only three professors without a college degree. As well as David Morell, many of his students went on to be writers.\n\nIn 1999 he was named author emeritus by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America."
