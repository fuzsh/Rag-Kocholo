Please see the images for more details.\n\nCover art: Unknown\n\nBlurb: ”Of the six volumes of William Tenn's work now made simultaneously available, THE WOODEN STAR comes closest to being a pacifist collection, the general theme being an ironic and sometimes bitter comment on man's stupidity to man.\n\nBut Tenn's humor is irrepressible and bursts forth in a joyous political satire on the wars of the sexes titled \"The Masculinist Revolt\" - which may yet bring codpieces back into fashion.\n\nAnd do not miss the other titles pictured below.”"
