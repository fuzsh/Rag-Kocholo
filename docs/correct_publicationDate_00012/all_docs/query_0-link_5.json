        "text": "December 6, 2016\n\nWhen you go through these complete collections of various SF writers (especially the sets that NESFA puts out, which I find pretty valuable) you often find that they're collecting writers who have either fallen in obscurity or weren't given their due during the time they were active and have only be rediscovered years later. William Tenn is a strange case, though. Pretty well regarded when he was active (from the late 40s to the late 60s) to the point where he had people like Theodore Sturgeon representing him as an agent in the early days, he wrote a bunch of stories during that timeframe before deciding that teaching was more rewarding and focused on that for the remainder of his working life. But even when he wasn't writing he stuck around for quite a while, staying active in the Pittsburgh fandom groups and living nearly until his nineties, only passing away in early 2010. So unlike a lot of other writers who died young and weren't around to hear the plaudits of another generation rediscovering their work (Kornbluth comes to mind immediately, although I'm sure everyone has their favorites), Tenn (born and died Philip Klass) got to hear everyone tell him how great he was and give him all the honors that I'd say he probably deserved.\n\nBecause his body of work was so small (fitting in two admittedly hefty volumes here, the first covering nothing but short stories, the second gathering together the rest and his scant longer fiction) yet remarkably consistent, I think Tenn gets kind of the aura of \"the one that got away\" because he retired from writing SF but clearly never stopped being a decent writer. He was also one of the few consistently successful satiristst the genre has seen, able to take a well worn trope and turn it inside out or approach it from an angle that told a good story while mocking the very cliche he was attempting to ape. Unless you're, I don't know, Mark Twain, humor is probably hard to do and sustain in stories in general and even harder in something like SF because so much of it takes itself very seriously, yet too much of the ha-ha's and you run the risk of undermining whatever point you're trying to make as it dives into ridiculousness.\n\nI have to admit, I find the satire angle intriguing but at the same time it too often dates a lot of his stories as later events in the world of science could negate the point he's trying to make or society has since evolved where we might find the very thing he's making fun of rather quaint nowadays in these jaded times we live in. I don't find him as savage as someone like Barry Malzberg, who I find skews closer to my own sensibilities (although to be fair Malzberg didn't start until Tenn had basically retired, so we may be talking about a generational thing as well) and he lacks the bizarre edge that someone like Cordwainer Smith could bring to the proceedings, which I find reads a lot easier to today's audience.\n\nBut Tenn was a good writer just from a pure prose standpoint, able to craft stories that would probably make English teachers the world over swoon. Even his early stories, while maybe a tad overwritten and not able to zero in on their targets the way the best of his stories did, generally have something to recommend. Interestingly Tenn is often his best critic . . . he contributes a sometimes detailed afterword for every single story and his memory alone is impressive but he's also good at pointing out which stories he didn't think worked very well. And while you may be able to accuse him of self-deprecation or being too hard on himself, surprisingly his criticism after the fact are often spot-on (something probably all those years of teaching college English helped with).\n\nAs I said, his best stories often take apart SF cliches and have some fun with them. Many of them deal with aliens and he's quite capable of writing some pretty weird alien stories where the aliens actually do feel like aliens instead of people wearing funny costumes (although that happens too in \"Lisbon Cubed\", the one with probably the best \"oh no he didn't\" ending). A lot of the stories actually have surprise or \"gotcha\" endings (\"The Flat Eyed Monster\" sharing the aforementioned \"Lisbon Cubed\"'s sense of deadpan tragedy), and he's quite good at that and a good enough writer that even knowing the ending in advance doesn't make it less enjoyable to read). Two of the funniest ones have to do with alien sex (\"Venus of the Seven Sexes\" and the immensely amusing \"Party of the One Part\", showcasing the best use for naughty pictures of amoebas doing whatever it is they do on Discovery Channel series that focus on microscopes and one celled organisms).\n\nOther ones act as future histories of sorts, generally about things going terribly wrong (\"The Liberation of Earth\" and \"Eastward Ho!\", both ridiculous in their own way although I find the latter a bit more fleshed out) while others take a single idea and run it right into the ground (the still amusing \"Null-P\", although lately I think we'd all crave a political landscape stuffed with boring people) . . . strangely a lot of his stories seem to end right where other people would start (\"Generation of Noah\",\" \"The Sickness\", although that nicely inverts a \"we're doomed\" scenario, \"A Man of Family\" which focuses I think on the wrong aspect of the scenario but manages to barely save itself with an ending that falls on the right side of sappy) which sometimes makes them feel a bit unfinished even if the central idea is still fairly interesting. When they do work, its because he almost makes it a closed loop, like the machinations of \"The Servant Problem\", where everyone operates under the assumption that they're in control only to be busted by their own carefully managed system.\n\nYou've also got at least a couple satires on gender relations which I think probably fall under the \"aw, that's quaint\" category . . . \"The Masculinist Revolt\" and \"Venus is a Man's World\", although its probably safe to say a lesser author might have been quite a bit more hamfisted in his approach. I find his attempts at sheer weirdness don't work quite as well either, with something like \"Wednesday's Child\" probably having more impact in the hands of someone able to convey emotion better, like Sturgeon and stuff like \"My Mother Was a Witch\" barely registering, or like \"The Tenants\" feeling like a low budget \"Twilight Zone\" episode.\n\nPart of the problem sometimes why it may be hard to get into Tenn's stories is because he's an author more interested in ideas than characters, with the people in his plot basically there to get us to the twist or the satire (its not that his more personal stories fall flat, although \"The Custodian\" left me cold despite it apparently being his favorite). I think that's why stories like \"Down Among the Dead Men\", where a new commander has to bond with his zombie crew (and is a good example of a space opera that doesn't ever really go into space) or even more lighthearted stuff like \"On Venus, Have We Got a Rabbi\" which delves underneath all the humor with the more serious question of \"what makes a Jew?\" Or even \"The Dark Star\" which brings a human element to the issue of space travel and comes at it from an angle that unexpectedly and surprisingly emotional (similar to the more brutal and far more sobering \"The Last Bounce\" which takes that scenario even further and probably has a better payoff)\n\nHe has some time related stories as well. \"Time in Advance\" deals more with a future scenario that again trends back toward \"Twilight Zone\" territory (two convicts serve time in prison for crimes they're going to commit later, earning the right to actually go through with the crime) while \"Winthrop was Stubborn\" (one of my favorites from the set) is an amusing twist on time travel where everyone is at risk of being stuck in a future they don't find that appealing because one guy thinks its the bees' knees.\n\nBut there's a rather startling amount of variety in this collection, as Tenn seems to understand that he's only going to be in SF for a limited amount of time and wants to cover as much territory as possible. And despite the stories not quite being in order (they appear to be organized by collection so the chronology is jumbled) you can easily pick out the more mature works from the ones where the prose is there but he's still finding his voice. And its that voice that kept his name alive in SF even when he stopped being an active contributor to the canon, one that, much like a lot of the other greats, is a necessary building block to a lot of the satire and expectation mangling that came later. That the best of the bunch still stand up today shows you how effective he was at getting his points across and how little the basics of SF have changed where we can still recognize the tropes he's poking fun at. While not quite as barbed as he could be, he's daring in his own way and a witty, welcome voice in a genre where too often writers take themselves ploddingly serious.\n\nFebruary 5, 2013\n\n8 “Down Among the Dead Men”\n\nTold from the POV of a weary veteran. Humanity is at war with an insectoid race that breeds prolifically. To compete, scientists have found methods to recycle tissue from casualties into human clones. The first clones are blank-eyed, emotionless, and can only perform mundane chores. The human crews take to calling the clones “zombies” and treat them with disdain. The protagonist is given command of a new ship. He prepares to meet with his all-zombie crew. The new clones appear to be perfect human facsimiles. The captain’s crew greets him with hostility. They resent being treated like sub-human animals. They seethe believing the scientists intentionally made them sterile. The captain, attempting to convince his crew that science has not conquered the reconstitution of reproductive organs, confesses that one of his war wounds has rendered him sterile, a condition no doctor has been able to repair. The crew finally bonds with him. Savage depiction of the cost of war and a thoughtful examination of cloning.\n\n9 “The Liberation of Earth”\n\nEarth becomes a battlefield for two warring alien races. Each race “liberates”, then re-liberates and re-liberates Earth. Each alien race spouts propaganda against the other, but determining which race has the moral high-ground is impossible. The battles millions of human become collateral casualties. Earth’s ecology is devastated. Eventually the aliens depart, taking their battle elsewhere. Humanity has been reduced to a stone-age existence, the Earth permanently crippled. The narrator concludes: “We about as liberated as a race or planet can be.”\n\n6 “Flirgleflip”\n\nScientist, frustrated that the Temporal Embassy has ordered him to cease work on his time-travel device, sends a colleague back to the 20th century to ensure that his name goes down in history as the inventor of time travel. The colleague is an old man with no useful skills for employment or survival in the 20th century. He hooks up with a reporter to try to gain the attention of a temporal agent to rescue him. The reporter exposes the scientist’s story, making him appear insane. Afterward, the reporter confesses that he is a temporal agent, but no rescue will take place. The poor scientist must live out his days in the 20th century, such is the grand design of the Temporal Embassy.\n\n6 “The Tenants”\n\nThe new tenants want to rent the 13th floor of an office building, which the manager insists does not exist. They arrange tenancy anyway and occupy their new offices. The manager becomes obsessed with visiting the 13th floor, but can never find it. He figures out that only people who have official business on the 13th floor can actually find it. When the tenants move out, he has his pretense to go visit the floor: an official inspection. While he examines the office space, the tenants depart, leaving him trapped on the 13th floor. A clever but silly yarn.\n\n8 “The Custodian”\n\nHumanity has abandoned the planet after discovering that the sun will go nova in a few years. The populace polarizes between Affirmers (those determined to evacuate humanity from Earth, leaving behind all nonessential artifacts), and Custodians (those who believe an effort must be made to preserve objects of artistic, cultural, or sentimental value.) The protagonist, a custodian, is the last man on Earth. He travels the world, viewing the great works of art. One day his scanner detects another human. He investigates and finds a hidden band of Custodians. All have died save one infant. The protagonist rescues the child and takes for it. The child inspires him to make an effort to escape Earth. He procures an abandoned spaceship. As he prepares to leave, he fills the ship with as many great works of art as he can carry. Elegiac, but ultimately life-affirming tale."
