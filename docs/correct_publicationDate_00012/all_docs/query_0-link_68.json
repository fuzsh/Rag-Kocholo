        "text": "On by Adam Roberts\n\nreviewed by Nick Gevers\n\nThis book is all about vertigo. The world has turned at 90 degrees; gravity now operates horizontally. Humans and other creatures, compelled to adapt to this horrifying disequilibrium, inhabit ledges, crevices, and caverns, whatever niches remain to them; and as the centuries pass and the new barbarism takes hold, the golden age, the time when everything was reassuringly level, fades into legend. One false step, and you fall off the Worldwall, and you may fall forever.\n\nColonization: Aftershocks by Harry Turtledove\n\nreviewed by Greg L. Johnson\n\nThis is the latest novel in a series that began with Worldwar: In the Balance, and portrays an Earth in which an alien invasion interrupted World War II. By the time of this book, it is the 60s, much of the planet is occupied by the aliens, known to themselves as The Race, to humans as the Lizards. The author does a masterful job of meshing his world's history with our own, and it's a lot of fun spotting the differences in people's lives.\n\nGeeks With Books\n\na column by Rick Klaw\n\nRick Klaw gives us a look at how things work from behind the counter of a book store. This time, he tells us whether movie tie-ins actually help book sales. And guest reviewer Peggy Hailey gives us her opinion of some new Terry Pratchett covers.\n\nQuantum Musings by Michael Gallant, Raymond M. Coulombe and Timothy O. Goyette\n\nreviewed by Lisa DuMond\n\nWhen's the last time you just had a really good time reading a book? Have you ever finished an anthology and thought, \"I'd really like to hang out with those guys!\"? If it's been far too long -- for instance, if your answer was something like never -- you're long overdue for a treat. Fortunately, if you're in the mood for a bit of fun, this is just what you need.\n\nThief of Time by Terry Pratchett\n\nreviewed by Steven H Silver\n\nIt begins with a strange woman approaching Jeremy Clockson, a clockmaker who is such a stickler for accuracy that he drives the other clockmakers crazy. Jeremy quickly takes up the challenge to create the most accurate timepiece ever conceived, the mythical glass clock. This challenge brings him into conflict with the Monks of History as he threatens to bring the world to an end through no intentions of his own.\n\nDislocated Fictions\n\na column by Gabriel Chouinard\n\nGabriel Chouinard's column is dedicated to exposing the risk-takers working in SF and fantasy. He calls them the Next Wave, in a nod to the obvious influences that the New Wave writers had upon them. Here, he gives us some ideas on changing a publisher's mind after they scuppered a book and he tells us what titles have got him buzzed.\n\nThe Sacred Pool by L. Warren Douglas\n\nreviewed by Regina Lynn Preciado\n\nThis is not really a fantasy novel. It's a history book, set in a time of change, when Romans clash with Gauls, and Christians merge with pagans. Magic is math and time is mutable and as our heroine Pierrette observes, many complicated concepts become \"self-evident, once you know about zero and infinity.\"\n\nSewerelf by Dan Weiss\n\nreviewed by Lisa DuMond\n\nAsher Archer's daughter wants desperately not to grow up. True, the technology to keep her young is there; she can remain 5 years old indefinitely, but it's going to require a mighty effort on Archer's part to obtain the extra time. First, he's going to have to get them back from a rival company after an extremely hostile takeover that has taken him far away. Fortunately -- or maybe, unfortunately -- a mysterious face from his past has returned to lend a hand.\n\nForthcoming Books\n\ncompiled by Neil Walsh\n\nHere's a sampling of some of the F&SF books that are headed our way in the coming months...\n\nPerdido Street Station by China Mi√©ville\n\nreviewed by Hank Luttrell\n\nThe first few pages are from the viewpoint of a bitter and alien character, and written in a dark and obscure style. This voice seems appropriate and accurate, even accessible, after you get to know the character. Next up, the protagonist Isaac and his insect-girlfriend are introduced. He is big and blustery, an eccentric, obsessive, maverick scientist. She is a bohemian artist, outcast from her exotic race of hominid bugs. Their relationship is incredibly romantic and also forbidden and dangerous.\n\nSummers at Castle Auburn by Sharon Shinn\n\nreviewed by Victoria Strauss\n\nCoriel Halsing is the illegitimate child of a noble line. She lives a divided life: nine months of the year with her grandmother, a village wise woman and healer to whom she is apprenticed, and the three months of summer at Castle Auburn, where she lives the life of a highborn courtier.\n\nTreasure at the Heart of the Tanglewood by Meredith Ann Pierce\n\nreviewed by Victoria Strauss\n\nBrown Hannah lives at the edge of the Tanglewood, a dark, trackless forest surrounded by barren moors. According to the peasants who eke a meager existence at the Tanglewood's edges, a great treasure lies at the forest's heart, though none of them know what the treasure is. Mounted knights come from faraway to seek it, riding into the wood as if bespelled, never returning. Only Hannah knows the truth: there's no treasure in the Tanglewood, just the powerful wizard she has served ever since she can remember.\n\nJune Books\n\ncompiled by Neil Walsh\n\nRecent arrivals on the shelves include a new collection from Kevin J. Anderson; new novels from Andre Norton and Sasha Miller, Jacqueline Carey, Juliet Marillier, Adam Roberts, Julie E. Czerneda, and Robert Silverberg; and classic reprints from Fritz Leiber, Ward Moore, James White, Phyllis Ann Karr, Jennifer Roberson, and Guy Gavriel Kay.\n\nMiller Lau\n\nA Conversation With Miller Lau\n\nAn interview with John Berlyne\n\nOn growing up in Edinburgh:\n\n\"Well, I grew up in Edinburgh -- it's my home town. In fact, you could say I am a survivor of Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting generation. I grew up at the same time, in the same housing estates he talks about in his novels. What I feel Walsh chooses to ignore is the strength and warmth of the Scots character -- qualities which I hope are evident in my own writing -- and that's sad. He chooses not to focus on our dignity and humour but rather on the grimness of growing up in that environment.\"\n\nTalisker by Miller Lau\n\nreviewed by John Berlyne\n\nWe meet Duncan Talisker just as he is released from an Edinburgh prison, having served 15 years for a series of murders that he didn't commit. No sooner is he back on the streets than another death occurs with the very same modus operandi. We also learn that this story also takes place on Sutra, a place that very much conforms to Tolkien's definition of a secondary world. Sutra's indigenous race are The Fine -- a Celtic people who seem to be living around the time of Highlander. Sutra is also home to The Sidhe, a race of magic-wielding shape-shifters (and Lau's elaboration on the Sidhe of Celtic mythology) who interact and co-exist with The Fine, but clearly have origins and agendas all of their very own.\n\nBabylon 5.1\n\nTV reviews by Rick Norwood\n\nRick tells us what is planned following the success of the TV adaptation of Dune and offers his thoughts on the recent DVD release of Close Encounters of the Third Kind written and directed by Steven Spielberg.\n\nImmodest Proposals by William Tenn\n\nreviewed by Nick Gevers\n\nOne of NESFA's worthiest projects yet is a two-volume Complete SF of William Tenn, of which this is the first installment. To discover, or rediscover, these remarkable stories from the 40s and 50s is to realize all over again just how fresh and powerful the SF published in the pulp magazines could be: how open its world-view was, how flexible its conventions and \"sense of wonder\" were in the hands of laconic witty philosophers like William Tenn.\n\nDark Universe by Daniel F. Galouye\n\nreviewed by Hank Luttrell\n\nThe surviving humans have been reduced to living underground in subsistence circumstances; after generations of hiding underground they have forgotten most of their history. The failure of some of their life support systems has forced them to live in complete darkness. In compensation for the loss of vision, the sense of hearing has gained great acuity.\n\nAstronomy by Richard Wadholm\n\nreviewed by Lisa DuMond\n\nEverything about this debut novel recalls the dime novels of the early part of the 20th century. Tough and tender babes. Villainous foes. Strong, silent heroes. Pure good versus evil stuff. Now, instead of \"penny dreadfuls\" you can get all the action via ebook -- not a bad idea, not bad at all.\n\nStar Wars: The Essential Guide to Alien Species by Ann Margaret Lewis\n\nreviewed by David Maddox\n\nEver wonder why the Ugnaughts ended up on Cloud City? Or how the Gungan language developed? Well, someone did and now all those Star Wars questions you have (and dozens upon dozens you never knew you did) will be answered."
