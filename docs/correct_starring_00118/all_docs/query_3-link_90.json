        "text": "Did you know that James Cameron originally envisioned Lance Henriksen for the main role of the T-800 in 1984’s The Terminator? The now-iconic role of course ended up being played by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the classic film, while Henriksen ended up playing the character Hal Vukovich. But what if Henriksen had been cast in the role of The Terminator?\n\nArtist Peter Murphy has gone ahead and done the work necessary to imagine such an alternate timeline, whipping up an incredible sculpture of Lance Henriksen as the T-800!\n\nThe bust is based on early concept art painted by James Cameron himself, and it depicts a heavily battle-damaged version of the Lance Henriksen Terminator we never saw.\n\nMurphy writes on Facebook, “Here are some pictures I took today of my CSM-100 or Lance Henriksen Terminator. I had always liked James Cameron’s original envisioning of Lance Henriksen playing the Terminator. I figured it was unlikely for me to ever actually see that happen, so I took a stab at sculpting this bust.\n\n“I started by sculpting Lance Henriksen, made a mold, cast a copy out of silicone, cut half of it off and sculpted the T-800 style endoskull as accurately to the first film as possible – while modifying the proportions to fit into my sculpture of Lance Henriksen. I then molded that, cast it, sanded it for countless hours – molded it again – cast it again and took it to Artcraft Plating and Finishing in Burbank to have it plated with Rhodium (aerospace chrome – the best). I then rigged up the eye with an iris, LED, and a servo and placed it back into the head.\n\n“The AMT Hardballer longslide started as a 3d print from @traywickdesigns, I made a few modifications, molded some parts and cast them in resin. I then molded my brother-in-law’s hand holding said gun (handle)…etc.,etc.,etc., you get the idea. The hand is translucent resin. The base is fiberglass and is wired to control the eye, powered by a portable USB charger. The hair is hand punched. I am probably leaving out a lot, let me know if you have any questions.”\n\nCheck out Peter Murphy’s FB post below to see his take on Lance Henriksen: Terminator!"
