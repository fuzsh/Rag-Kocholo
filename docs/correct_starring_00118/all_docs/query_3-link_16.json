        "text": "Genre icon Lance Henriksen is starring in Nevermore, a supernatural horror thriller written and being directed by Dean C. Jones.\n\nJason Cook, a mainstay of the soap operas General Hospital and Days of Our Lives, and Valerie Azlynn, who has appeared on shows like Castle, also are starring in the movie, shooing in Graham, N.C.\n\nThe movie centers on a couple who experience paranormal activity involving dead children when they move to an estate in Massachusetts.\n\nHenriksen will play a parish priest whom the couple turn to, but the move is a mistake because the priest already knows all about resurrected children.\n\nAlbert Dickerson, Michele Weisler and Starr Jones are producing, while Liliana Kligman is executive producing in association with Café Oscure Films and Atlantic & Pacific Pictures.\n\nHenriksen is perhaps best known for his work in the classic Alien quadrilogy and starring in Fox TV’s Millennium (which garnered him three Golden Globe nominations in the television drama category). He is voicing a character in Disney HD’s Tron: Uprising and has several films in the can, including Needlestick, Caretaker and Champion.\n\nHenriksen is repped by APA and Henriksen Talent Management.\n\nEmail: Borys.Kit@thr.com\n\nTwitter: @Borys_Kit"
