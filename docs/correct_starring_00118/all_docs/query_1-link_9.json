        "text": "Lance James Henriksen (born May 5, 1940) is an American actor and artist who played Bishop in the 1986 film Aliens, \"Bishop II\" in the 1992 film Alien3 and Charles Bishop Weyland in the 2004 film Alien vs. Predator. He also voiced the original Bishop in Alien3, although the actual on-screen performance was provided by an animatronic dummy modelled after the actor.\n\nOne of the most prolific figures in the Alien, Predator and Alien vs. Predator franchises, Henriksen also lent his voice and likeness to the characters of Karl Bishop Weyland in the 2010 video game Aliens vs. Predator, another Bishop android in the 2013 video game Aliens: Colonial Marines, and Bishop II in Aliens: Colonial Marines and its DLC expansion Stasis Interrupted, and reprised his role as Bishop in the 2019 audio drama Alien III. He also narrated an abridged audiobook version of the novel Alien3, released in 1992. Other notable films Henriksen has appeared in include Damien: Omen II (1978), The Terminator (1984), Near Dark (1987), Hard Target (1993) and The Quick and the Dead (1995). He is also known for his starring role as Frank Black in the television series Millennium (1996-1999).\n\nHenriksen has been nominated for three Golden Globes. He is often said to be one of only two actors (the other being Bill Paxton) who has been killed on-screen by an Alien, a Predator and a Terminator (although some argue that Henriksen's character Bishop in Aliens was not killed by an Alien, as he was technically still active after being ripped in two by the Queen).\n\nFilmography[]\n\nYear Title Notes 1961 The Outsider Uncredited 1972 It Ain't Easy 1973 Emperor of the North Uncredited 1974 To Kill the King 1975 Dog Day Afternoon 1976 Network Uncredited Mansion of the Doomed The Next Man 1977 Close Encounters of the Third Kind With Carl Weathers 1978 Damien: Omen II 1979 The Visitor 1981 The Dark End of the Street Pirhana II: The Spawning Directed by James Cameron Prince of the City 1983 Nightmares The Right Stuff With Veronica Cartwright 1984 The Terminator With Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton and Arnold Schwarzenegger, directed by James Cameron 1985 Jagged Edge Savage Dawn 1986 Aliens Choke Canyon 1987 Near Dark With Jenette Goldstein and Bill Paxton 1988 Pumpkinhead Directed by Stan Winston 1989 House III: The Horror Show Survival Quest With Mark Rolston Johnny Handsome With Henry Kingi and Gerard G.

Cameron even drew some concept art of Henriksen as the Terminator, but the character was eventually altered, becoming an unstoppable human tank instead of a stealthy infiltrator, and Arnold Schwarzenegger was cast in the role.\n\nGallery[]\n\n[]"
