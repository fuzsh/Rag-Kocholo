        "text": "Flying home across the Atlantic after his mother’s funeral, actor Viggo Mortensen started to write, sifting through memories and feelings to capture her spirit and story before it faded into fragments of the past.\n\n“I just wanted to remember as much as I could about her, because everything is so present, and intense, as happens when someone dies that you care about,” Mortensen says via Zoom from Barcelona, Spain, the country where he’s lived in recent years. “Images of her at different times. Thinking about her. Thinking about my parents, the childhood I shared with my two brothers.\n\n“Thinking about how subjective memory is, because I’d heard stories I was familiar with at her funeral, but they were slightly different versions,” he says. “How strange that is, how we think we remember accurately, but really, memory is feeling more than fact. It’s just a collection of feelings that we subconsciously edit all the time to feel comfortable in our present.”\n\nSoon, these memories and imagination produced a short story, or maybe a novella, in which the facts of his mother and father’s lives shifted through the lens of fiction and transformed into the story of an elderly father and the son he’d pushed away, says Mortensen.\n\nIn addition to being a three-time Oscar nominee as an actor, most recently for his work in the 2019 best picture winner “Green Book,” Mortensen has published books of poetry, essays and photography. But he wasn’t sure that a book was the right format.\n\n“The structure is really interesting, and I can picture so much of this. And I thought, ‘If I can picture it, maybe it’s a movie, not a book,” Mortensen says.\n\n“Falling” opens in limited theaters on digital and on-demand on Friday, Feb. 5. It’s the story of John, played by Mortensen, and his curmudgeonly father Willis, a terrific Lance Henriksen, as dementia starts to cloud the older man’s mind.\n\nMortensen makes his directing debut with the film, which he also wrote, produced and scored. “Falling” features Laura Linney as John’s sister Sarah, Sverrir Gudnason as Willis as a younger man, and Hannah Gross as wife and mother Gwen.\n\nIt’s a tough, realistic, and ultimately moving study of a father-son relationship. John, an Air Force Academy graduate turned airline pilot, is a gay man and Willis doesn’t hold back his crude opinions about that.\n\n“What are the limits of communication?” Mortensen says of the questions the film asks. “Are there any? Are there people you cannot communicate with? Don’t deserve it?\n\n“It’s not a story that’s telling you what to think and feel,” he says. “It’s not giving you answers, resolving things. I don’t like stories to do that. I prefer stories that pose questions.”\n\nLeading man Lance\n\nAt 80, Lance Henriksen is the definition of an old Hollywood hand, with more than 250 credits in film and television over the past 50 years. His best-known work includes such films as “Aliens,” “Terminator,” “Near Dark” and “Hard Target,” as well as the lead role in the TV series “Millennium.”\n\nMortensen says he didn’t write “Falling” with any particular actor in mind, but once he thought of Henriksen for Willis that was the only actor he wanted.\n\n“When I finished the script I was like, ‘Well, I could get so and so, they’re really world-famous actors,’” he says. “I mean, Lance is famous, but in a sort of genre world. He’s a cult favorite for some people.”\n\nYet no matter the type of films in which he’s often appeared, Henriksen always seemed real, Mortensen says.\n\n“Even in the weirdest things he’s always believable,” he says. “I thought it’s going to be great if he wants to do it because he’ll do something special. He’ll surprise people, maybe surprise himself.\n\n“But he went way beyond what I dreamed he might do. He inhabited that role, making no compromises.”\n\nMortensen isn’t shy about his hope that Henriksen will get awards consideration for his work as Willis, which in December earned him best actor honors at the International Film Festival & Awards in Macao.\n\nHenriksen, likewise, isn’t shy about his gratitude to Mortensen for handing him such a meaty dramatic role at this point in his long career.\n\n“It was probably the best experience I’ve ever had in my life as an actor,” Henriksen says by phone from Los Angeles. “The whole thing was amazing. The crew, everybody, we all became bonded over this story.\n\n“To try to do a role like that, I’ll be forever grateful,” he says. “I mean, this kind of role, the only thing I did that was similar was ‘Millennium,’ in the sense that it was a well-versed, bright man, and it was well-written.\n\n“But anyway, yeah, this may change things, you know.”\n\nHearts and minds\n\nWillis can seem such a hard, angry character that some viewers might find it unrealistic that John would stick around and put up with him.\n\nMortensen says that’s missing the point. John sees his last surviving parent in steep decline, both physically and mentally, and decides to stick it out.\n\n“He decides consciously, ‘I’m going to help him, and the only way I can help is by putting up with a lot of crap and not responding as I have in the past because he’ll just cut me off,’” he says.\n\n“And thanks to Lance’s incredibly layered performance, we have something special there,” Mortensen says. “It’s not easy to watch always, but I think it’s very realistic.\n\n“Lance’s performance is so real and uncompromising that it’s really remarkable,” he says.\n\nHenriksen says his own rough childhood, and a mother who he says essentially sent him out on his own before he was a teenager, informed his understanding of Willis and John.\n\n“Viggo had written something as powerful as rails under a freight train,” he says “That thing is going to go, and it’s not going to stop until it gets there.\n\n“I was praying I was capable,” Henriksen says. “I didn’t want to get caught acting. This one thing you have to live, you can’t fake it. So I drew upon things from my childhood.”\n\nNear the end of the film, Willis and John confront each other over a lifetime of shared and separate hurts. It’s the most intense scene in the movie, one Henriksen says pushed both him and Mortensen to the places few actors ever go.\n\n“We kept prodding each other and pushing at each other, and finally it blew up,” he says. “It absolutely blew up. And, you know, it’s kind of miraculous what happened.\n\n“The truth is that we really went really went to the edge, right to the edge,” Henriksen says. “And that was, I think, what it needed to be. And we found it, which is amazing.\n\n“It takes some courage to do that because the only way for a lot of people to do it is to fake it,” he says of the raw display of emotions he and Mortensen deliver. “And I wasn’t faking, and neither was Viggo.”"
