        "text": "From the very start, character actor Lance Henriksen enjoyed collaborations with some of the leading filmmakers of the time, including Sidney Lumet, Steven Spielberg and James Cameron. In fact, it was Cameron who initially envisioned Henriksen in the role of the catchphrase-spouting killer robot in \"The Terminator\" (1984). And although he was only seen in that film in a much smaller part, Cameron came through with another memorable character for him to embody in the smash hit \"Aliens\" (1986). From there it was on to a near constant output of work in films such as \"Near Dark\" (1987), \"Johnny Handsome\" (1989), \"Alien3\" (1992), \"Hard Target\" (1993), and \"The Quick and the Dead\" (1995). On television he headlined a series of his own as ex-FBI profiler Frank Black in the critically lauded, but ratings-challenged \"Millennium\" (Fox, 1996-99). Later career roles included voice work in video games and on animated television series, as well as turns in films like \"AVP: Alien vs. Predator\" (2004) and \"Appaloosa\" (2008). While the vast majority of character actors blended into the background of the public consciousness, garnering little name recognition with audiences, Henriksen managed to become a sort of working man's movie star, delivering performances just as iconic as those of the megawatt stars he appeared alongside."
