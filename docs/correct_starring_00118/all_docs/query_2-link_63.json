        "text": "LOS ANGELES â âOn Fireâ is inspired by actual events and tells the story of a man and his familyâs fight for survival as a devastating wildfire rips through their homeâs surrounding countryside.\n\nIn an interview with Spectrum News, Peter Facinelli said the movie has many takeaways, one of which is to celebrate the heroism of firefighters.\n\nâThe film also celebrates our 911 operators, first responders. They donât get a lot of credit. It was a little in-depth look at how stressful their job is and how they have to have these experiences where someoneâs life is on the line, and they canât always help them. They have to stuff that down so they can help the next person, and the next person,â he said.\n\nFacinelli is co-director of âOn Fire,â because when director Nick Lyon had COVID during the filming, Facinelli stepped into the directorâs chair.\n\n\"To Nickâs credit, he trusted me and believed I understood what we were trying to make together enough to say, 'here is the torch, carry it through,'\" he said.\n\nLance Henriksen, who also stars in âOn Fire,â said he hopes the theme of family resonates with viewers.\n\nHenriksen told Spectrum News he felt blessed with the cast.\n\nâThey were all good, and they let me be good,â he said.\n\nThe film also stars Asher Angel and Fiona Dourif.\n\nSAG-AFTRA approved an interim agreement for âOn Fireâ because the film was released by Cineverse, an independent, non-AMPTP affiliated distributor. Under the terms, members âmay work on these productions without being in violation of the strike order,â according to the guild.\n\nThe movie's team expressed gratitude to SAG-AFTRA for allowing the cast to promote the film.\n\nâOn Fireâ is now playing in theaters."
