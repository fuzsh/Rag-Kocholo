        "text": "Lance Henriksen has been thrilling audiences since 1961. He’s as seasoned as they come, and while he’s a performer capable of tackling just about any genre, he’s really found his groove in the horror genre. He is irrefutably one of the most active genre contributors alive and has more than earned our respect.\n\nAlthough he’s surfaced in a few sub-par indie efforts, he’s also had a hand in a number of marvelous pictures. If you’re a fan of the man’s work, you’ll want to read on, as these are the 10 best horror films to feature the great Lance Henriksen.\n\nAliens: The film that Henriksen may be best known for, Aliens was obviously a phenomenal piece of work. It carries the dread of its immediate predecessor but injects a load of awesome action. Unlike the cyborg featured in the first franchise film, Henriksen’s approach to the artificial lifeform of this group is pure in intent. No agendas here, and that makes him not only heroic, but insanely likable. Need I say more?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zNE0dlHcmgA\n\nAbominable: Henriksen doesn’t have a huge part in Abominable, but that doesn’t change the fact that this is a genuinely underrated picture. It could easily be labeled one of the better Bigfoot flicks on the market, and it never once seems to earn mention when discussions of such nature are sparked up. But trust this: You should look into Abominable. It relies on tension and character study more than overt violence, and the characters are anything but one-note. Look into it – it’s something of a treasure!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/cX9141gbEl8\n\nAVP: Alien vs. Predator: Henriksen’s position in AVP has essentially zero relation (well, the name and all…) to his character Bishop in Aliens. No, Charles Bishop Weyland is a character all his own, anxious to uncover something special: the find of a lifetime. But when the ailing man finds himself in the middle of a war between aliens and predators, his chances of escaping with a claim to the world’s biggest find evaporate, only a bloody mist left to remind us he was ever there. But it’s a passionate performance from Lance, and we love him in this surprisingly entertaining crossover film.\n\nMORE Lance Henriksen Movies on the NEXT page!"
