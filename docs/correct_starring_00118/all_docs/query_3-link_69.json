        "text": "In his illustrious film career, Lance Henriksen has faced off against Aliens, Predators, a Terminator, pesky piranhas, a Pumpkinhead, a Ghostface killer and Jean-Claude Van Damme and lived to tell about it. Well, maybe not on film but in real life.\n\nNot bad for a human who dropped out of high school at the age of 12. Then again, Henriksen is not your typical human and he makes most of his acting peers look “artificial” and “synthetic.”\n\nAlthough he said he is sick and tired of dying in movies, Henriksen — who is known for his deep, authoritative voice, intense stare and diverse body of work — has always loved the movies and he has become a consummate actor. When he was a kid, Henriksen a native New Yorker, used to go the movies all the time. He said the cinema was his school and the likes of Kirk Douglas and Marlon Brando were his teachers.\n\nIn his early 30s, Henriksen graduated from the prestigious Actors Studio and began his actor career.\n\n“By the time I was 30, I had lived a lot already. I was in acting classes with 20-year-olds that didn't have a life yet,” Henriksen said. “Ten years makes a big difference. I went to sea and traveled a lot and I had a lot of life experiences already. So I was really ready to put myself on the line and it took a while to really have the courage to do it.”\n\nHenriksen was illiterate until the age of 30; he learned to read by studying movie scripts. Initially, Henriksen said, he had no need for it.\n\n“I was a painter and an artist and there was no need for the written word. In fact, I kind of resented it,” he said. “I thought, why do I have to learn how to read my language? I mean, come on. I had 1,000 excuses. I'm very literate now.”\n\nToday, Henriksen not only can read, he has just self-published his autobiography, “Not Bad for a Human” (the title is a tongue-in-cheek nod to a memorable line his Bishop character utters near the end of “Aliens”) and will have limited-edition hardbound copies for sale during his appearance at this weekend's “Rock and Shock” event.\n\nOne of Henriksen's early film roles was the FBI agent who drives Al Pacino and John Cazale to the airport in Sidney Lumet's “Dog Day Afternoon” (1975).\n\n“We (Pacino, Cazale and I) all knew each other. We were all hanging out in New York and doing plays and stuff,” Henriksen said. “And I was so grateful just to be in it. That was really my first real film. I loved being a part of it. We shot that movie in continuity. It was unheard of.”\n\nHenriksen went on to portray a variety of supporting roles in noteworthy films, including Lumet's “Network” (1976), Steven Spielberg's “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” (1977), “Damien” Omen II” (1978) and Philip Kaufman's “The Right Stuff” (1983), in which he played Mercury astronaut Capt. Wally Schirra.\n\nWhen an unknown director named James Cameron was shopping around a script about a killing machine covered in human tissue (from the future, no less), he called on Henriksen (who worked on Cameron's 1981, low-budget, less-than-memorable directorial debut, “Piranha Part Two: The Spawning”) to help.\n\n“Jim asked me to go in as ‘The Terminator' when he took the meeting to pitch his movie. I was supposed to go 15 minutes before him and he would arrive and talk to them about making the movie and I would leave,” Henriksen recalled. “I said, ‘Hell, yeah! I will do that.' So I went in and scared the (expletive) out of them. I imagined Hemdale (the production company) said, we'll do the movie but with anybody but him (Henriksen).”\n\nAs film lore goes, Cameron originally envisioned Henriksen in the title role of “The Terminator,” a role that eventually went to Arnold Schwarzenegger and made him a bonafide box-office star. However, Henriksen did appear in the film, in the minor role of ill-fated Det. Hal Vukovich.\n\n“I'm never disappointed when I don't get a role,” Henriksen said. “Truthfully, man, I've done over 200 movies. How can I?”\n\nTwo years later, Cameron cast Henriksen in the role of a lifetime, benevolent android Bishop opposite Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in “Aliens.” Not only was this his big break, it was the biggest challenge yet of his film career.\n\n“I realized I couldn't compete with some of the great work that had been done, Rutger Hauer, the work he did in ‘Blade Runner' as an android and Ian Holm in the first ‘Alien,' ” Henriksen said. “You know what I got to do is forget about competing and I had to figure out a way.”\n\nAfter some serious soul-searching, Henriksen looked deep inside himself and came up with the personality trait he would use for Bishop.\n\n“I was actually playing myself emotionally, when I was about 12 years old, where adults, even if they didn't care about me or hurt my feelings, I would forgive only because I would outlive them. You could forget about it because they're getting old and you can see that. Like bad parents, kids still care about them and they forgive them for all that (expletive) that they do,” Henriksen explained. “In doing that, it gave me a place to be where everything was very similar to what Bishop had. He was in awe of anything that was alive and he was programmed, certainly, to protect humans, protect not hurt. It was a wonderful experience to play that.”\n\nAnother memorable (alas brief) role Henriksen had was that of the flamboyant gunslinger/flimflam man Ace Hanlon in “The Quick and the Dead” (1995).\n\nIn 1996, Henriksen was cast as Frank Black, a former FBI with the blessing (or the curse) to be able to see into the dark and twisted minds of violent psychopaths on “Millennium.” “The X-Files” creator Chris Carter reportedly created the role with Henriksen in mind, a role he would play for three seasons to much acclaim.\n\n“I remember our first meeting and I had read the script and I asked Chris Carter, ‘It's so dark. How is the audience going to take this every week? Where's the light in this thing?' And all he said to me was ‘the yellow house.' I said, ‘I guess I'll learn what that means,' ” Henriksen recalled. “It was ‘the yellow house,' actually the family (that lived in the yellow house), and I loved who he picked for the little girl (Brittany Tiplady, who played Henriksen's daughter) and Megan Gallager (who played his wife). They made it possible for me to do it.”\n\nIn the immediate future, Henriksen is going to be reunited with his “Right Stuff” and “Appaloosa” costar Ed Harris in “Phantom,” a Russian submarine movie, in which Henriksen has a small but significant role. In addition, Henriksen, an accomplished ceramist and potter, is working on a script on George Ohr (who was known as the “Mad Potter of Biloxi”), in which he plans to star, and the improvised comedy, “Bring Me the Head of Lance Henriksen,” about an actor (Tim Thomerson, who will also be at the “Rock and Shock”) who is always getting beat out on roles by … Lance Henriksen.\n\nIn addition to Lance Henriksen, horror stars attending this year's Rock And Shock include Robert Englund (“A Nightmare on Elm Street”), Ace Frehley (former Kiss guitarist), Norman Reedus (“Blade 2,” “The Boondock Saints,” “The Walking Dead”), Sean Patrick Flanery (“The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles,” “The Boondock Saints,” “Saw 3D”), Roddy Piper (“They Live”), Gary Busey (“Lethal Weapon,” “Predator 2,” “Celebrity Apprentice”), Heather Langen Kamp, Amanda Wyss (both of “A Nightmare on Elm Street”), Bill Moseley (“The Devil's Rejects”), Jake Busey (“Starship Troopers”), Derek Mears (“Predator,” “Friday the 13th”), Tim Thomerson (“Near Dark,” “Trancers,” “Dollman”) and others.
