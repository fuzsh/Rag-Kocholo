        "text": "Update 06/28: Digital rewards have been sent to backers!\n\nUpdate 05/09: We're delighted to announce Sigourney Weaver has joined Aliens Expanded!!\n\nUpdate 05/02: Our recent abundance of new interviewees, including James Cameron, Gale Anne Hurd, and Paul Reiser, has pushed back our schedule slightly and so we are now accepting orders until 05/13.\n\n--\n\nJoin the Aliens cast & crew, including James Cameron (Writer & Director), Gale Anne Hurd (Producer), Sigourney Weaver (Ripley), Michael Biehn (Hicks), Lance Henriksen (Bishop), Paul Reiser (Burke), Mark Rolston (Drake), Jenette Goldstein (Vasquez), William Hope (Gorman) and Carrie Henn (Newt), on a deep dive into this science-fiction classic.\n\nBrimming with stories, insight, and wonderful personal detail, this four-hour documentary is the most passionate and sophisticated exploration of Aliens ever made; a love letter to the people who made it and the communities who adore it, reflecting and enhancing the incredible legacy of this beloved epic.\n\nThis limited edition collector’s item features your name in the credits alongside the cast & crew of your favorite movie, as well as exclusive merchandise you can’t get anywhere else! Orders for this highly-collectable edition close at midnight on the 13th of May\n\nYour Ultimate Companion to James Cameron’s Aliens\n\nThe backbone of the documentary is an analysis of the crucial scenes of Aliens in chronological order. Using an innovative graphical ‘scanner’ we travel inside the movie to focus on not just scenes, but individual elements within those scenes, including characters, weaponry, and sets.\n\nAs we examine these elements, the crew, including Creature Effects Supervisors Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr., Visual Effects Supervisor Robert Skotak, Model Maker John Lee, and Graham Hartstone (Sound Department) add their own stories to those of the cast.\n\nAlong the way, we offer up a fresh and expanded take on the incredible story behind the film: the chance encounter that led to Cameron taking it on, the intense writing process, the intuitive casting of the marines, winning over Sigourney Weaver, finding Newt, the nightmare shoot, and the ultimate triumph. Famous tales are retold, but enriched with new perspectives.\n\nBut this isn’t just the story of Aliens - it’s also a story about how we relate to it. Together, we investigate the broader elements of the Aliens experience, examining how our love of Cameron’s film, then and now, has been influenced by a wide range of factors, including:\n\nThe Merchandising, including the novelisation and James Horner’s atmospheric soundtrack.\n\nThe Expanded Universe, including the books, comics, video games, film sequels, and cosplay.\n\nAnd the Fan Communities that enable us to continue to show our appreciation for the film all these years later\n\nIn these sections, Alan Dean Foster (Author, Aliens Novelization), Mark Verheiden (Author, Aliens Comics), V. Castro (Author, Vasquez), Charles de Lauzirika (Director, Superior Firepower: Making Aliens), and Derek Dafoe (Alien Theory) add their own insights to those of the cast and crew.\n\nAcross the four-hour runtime, we dive into innumerable stories that take you behind-the-scenes and under-the-skin - here are just a few of our favorites:\n\nWinning Over Ripley: Director James Cameron and the cast recall what it took to persuade Sigourney Weaver to return after her contract had lapsed, including Cameron’s cunning plan to persuade the studio to make her the highest paid actress in Hollywood.\n\nRemembering Bill Paxton: in a highly emotive segment, Jenette Goldstein (Vasquez), Mark Rolston (Drake), Cynthia Scott (Corporal Dietrich), Carrie Henn (Newt), and James Cameron recall working with Bill Paxton, and how he became the untameable, beloved, heartbeat of the production and a friend to everyone.\n\nThe Film that Never Ages: Alec Gillis (Creature Effects Coordinator, Aliens), Tom Woodruff Jr. (Creature Effects Coordinator, Aliens) and Matt Winston (Co-Founder, Stan Winston School) discuss how the sets, models, and complete lack of CGI give Aliens an authenticity that would be hard to beat with today’s technology.\n\nThe Battle with the British Crew: With great humor (in hindsight), James Cameron and his cast recall the culture clash with the dyed-in-the-wool British crew: the tensions, stand-offs, and the legendary confrontation between Cameron and a tea lady, and how the edginess on set fed into the tension within the movie.\n\nAll Hail the Queen: The cast & crew explore the creation of one of the greatest screen monsters of all time, the Alien Queen. From design concepts to the fabled “garbage bag” test to the giant, 14-foot puppet operated on set, to the amalgam of pigs, tigers, and other animals in her “vocalization,” this was a triumph of imagination realized at thrilling scale.\n\nOrders close at midnight on May 13th. Purchase your copy today to get your name in the credits as well as posters, sew-on patch and more.\n\nWe Got Nukes, We Got Knives, Sharp Sticks…\n\nIn addition to the documentary itself, our physical tiers come with a range of high-quality physical merchandise:\n\nFull Cast\n\nShipping & Fulfillment\n\nShipping: Shipping is charged at the point of fulfillment at cost (your shipping cost will be the price we pay and we will not make profit on it). In the current economic climate, shipping costs are fluctuating and hard to predict. Delaying payment for shipping benefits both sides as we avoid overcharging (bad for you) and undercharging (bad for our documentary budget).\n\nWe expect shipping prices to be $13 for domestic (US), $20 for international orders without a t-shirt, and $25 for international orders which include a t-shirt.\n\nFulfillment: Our physical merchandise is manufactured and shipped from California by a trusted partner who we have worked with for many years. Blu-rays are factory-pressed and manufactured to the highest standard possible (the same standard as AAA releases). Backers will receive a tracking number and our items are sent in very study packaging (posters rolled, not folded) to ensure everything arrives with you safely.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nWe’ve partnered with our friends at New Retro Wave again to curate our official soundtrack. NewRetroWave is one of the leading voices in the emerging Synthwave scene, providing exposure to Synthwave artists who perfectly complement the ‘80s aesthetic we’re celebrating.\n\nThe Small Print\n\nAliens Expanded is in late post-production, and even at this stage, certain creative elements may still be subject to small changes. By making a purchase you acknowledge that elements of the project, including but not limited to the artwork and content, is subject to change, and that the final project may differ slightly from what is presented while the campaign is active. All customers are welcome to join our community, but to do so they must conform to the community rules which govern appropriate behavior. Repeated failure to act appropriately in the community will result in a ban.\n\nDo you accept international orders?\n\nYes. We accept most currencies through our secure payment processing system. Although payments are processed in U.S. Dollars, you will see the equivalent charge in your currency on your bank or credit card statement.\n\nMy payment was declined, what should I do?\n\nOur payments system is hosted by Shopify, the world’s number one ecommerce platform. If you are having problems making a payment we are unable to assist. Please contact your card issuer/bank and ask them to accept the transaction.\n\nWhat is the format of the digital version?\n\nThe digital version of the movie will be MP4 (no DRM), 1080 video resolution (HD).\n\nWill the Blu-ray be region free?\n\nYes, the Blu-ray will be region free\n\nWhen will I receive my copy?\n\nYour items will be sent after we have put all the names in the credits. Digital items will be sent out in June 2024 and physical items in August 2024.\n\nWhat is your refund policy?\n\nWe offer a 14-day money-back guarantee from your date of purchase. In the event of a problem with shipping where ourselves or one of our partners is at fault (such as a damaged package) we will send out replacements.\n\nWhen will shipping be charged?\n\nShipping is charged at the point of fulfillment at cost (your shipping cost will be the price we pay and we will not make profit on it). In the current economic climate, shipping costs are fluctuating and hard to predict.

Producing physical media is prohibitively expensive at lower volumes, and after surveying ALIENS fans, there wasn't enough demand to make the option viable.\n\nWhat can I put as my username in the credits?\n\nNames in the credits are limited to 28 characters. We don’t accept bad language, racial, or sexual terms. You can include your online handle or the name of your website/blog/channel if you wish to and it fits within your 28 characters.\n\nMy question isn’t answered here - what should I do?\n\nPlease contact support@creatorvc.com for other questions\n\nUpdate 06/28: Digital rewards have been sent to backers!\n\nUpdate 05/09: We're delighted to announce Sigourney Weaver has joined Aliens Expanded!!\n\nUpdate 05/02: Our recent abundance of new interviewees, including James Cameron, Gale Anne Hurd, and Paul Reiser, has pushed back our schedule slightly and so we are now accepting orders until 05/13.\n\n--\n\nJoin the Aliens cast & crew, including James Cameron (Writer & Director), Gale Anne Hurd (Producer), Sigourney Weaver (Ripley), Michael Biehn (Hicks), Lance Henriksen (Bishop), Paul Reiser (Burke), Mark Rolston (Drake), Jenette Goldstein (Vasquez), William Hope (Gorman) and Carrie Henn (Newt), on a deep dive into this science-fiction classic.\n\nBrimming with stories, insight, and wonderful personal detail, this four-hour documentary is the most passionate and sophisticated exploration of Aliens ever made; a love letter to the people who made it and the communities who adore it, reflecting and enhancing the incredible legacy of this beloved epic.\n\nThis limited edition collector’s item features your name in the credits alongside the cast & crew of your favorite movie, as well as exclusive merchandise you can’t get anywhere else!
