His father, James Henriksen (born as Jim Marino Henriksen in TÃ¸nsberg 1910), was a Norwegian merchant sailor and boxer nicknamed \"Icewater\" who spent most of his life at sea. His mother, Margueritte, struggled to find work as a dance instructor, waitress, and model. His parents divorced when he was two years old and he was raised by his mother. As he grew up, Henriksen found himself in trouble at various schools and even saw the inside of a children's home. Henriksen left home and dropped out of school at the age of twelve; he would not learn to read until he was 30, when he taught himself by studying film scripts.\n\nCareer[]\n\nLance Henriksen began his acting career in the off-Broadway production of Three Plays of the Sea. Soon after, he landed roles in such films as Unspeakable, Powder, The Quick and the Dead, The Terminator, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and the Aliens franchise as Bishop, for which he is best known. Henriksen earned three Golden Globe nominations for his portrayal of former FBI agent Frank Black on the television series Millennium. His on-camera television guest appearances include Memphis Beat, Castle, NCIS, The X-Files, Cagney & Lacey, and The A-Team.\n\nAdding to his resume, Henriksen has also voiced characters in many video games including Aliens: Colonial Marines, Mass Effect 3, Alien vs. Predator, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena, Transformers Animated: The Game, and Mass Effect."
