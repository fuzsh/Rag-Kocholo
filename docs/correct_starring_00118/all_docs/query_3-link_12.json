        "text": "I love ensemble casts in films (particularly war films), and the ragtag group from James Cameron’s Aliens (1986) are one of the best. Even as a kid I knew every Space Marine’s name, which shows how much impact they had as a dynamic, cohesive team. Every character refused to be pushed into the background by all the monsters on display (except Pvt. Wierzbowski). And, while it’s pretty obvious what happened to the likes of Hollywood stars like Sigourney Weaver, Bill Paxton, and Lance Henriksen since the movie was release, I thought it might be interesting to take a look at what the whole cast got up to — 31 years after battling extra-terrestrials with Pulse Rifles on LV-426…\n\nSIGOURNEY WEAVER as Ellen Ripley.\n\nThen, aged 37. Now, aged 68.\n\nAlready a star by the time Aliens premiered in 1986, having obviously appeared in its seminal predecessor Alien (1979) and the smash hit comedy Ghostbusters (1984), Weaver’s Oscar-nominated performance in Aliens ensured she become one of the 1980s most successful actresses — with memorable roles in Gorillas in the Mist, Working Girl and Ghostbusters II.\n\nIn addition to starring in Alien’s subsequent sequels — Alien³ (1993) and Alien Resurrection (1997) — Weaver also appeared in the political comedy Dave (1993), thriller Copycat (1995), and award-winning drama The Ice Storm (1997), before combining her geek-comedy-sex-appeal for Galaxy Quest (1999). She later starred in rom-com Heartbreakers (2001), The Village (2004), and had a small role in the sci-fi comedy Paul. More lately, she was reunited with Cameron for another militaristic sci-fi movie, Avatar (2009), ppeared in horror-comedy The Cabin in the Woods (2012), co-starred in Neil Blomkamp’s sci-fi drama Chappie (2015), had a cameo in the reboot of Ghostbusters (2016), played Grandma in A Monster Calls (2016), and is set to return for Avatar’s many sequels.\n\nThere are also persistent rumours that Weaver will reprise her role as Ripley for a fifth and final Alien movie, too, having been impressed by director Neill Blomkamp’s concept for a conclusion… although this project keeps failing to gain traction despite the online clamour after concept art was released, partly because Ridley Scott has a ‘competing’ Alien prequel saga on the go with Prometheus and Alien: Covenant.\n\nSigourney had already married theatre director Jim Simpson in 1984 and the couple later had a daughter, Charlotte Simpson, in 1990.\n\nLANCE HENRIKSEN as Bishop.\n\nThen, aged 46. Now, aged 77.\n\nJames Cameron cast Henriksen as the android Bishop after working with the actor on Piranha II and The Terminator (where Henriksen was the original choice for Schwarzenegger’s cyborg role). Following Aliens, Henriksen has had a very busy career, alternating between low-budget (Pumpkinhead, Hellraiser: Hellworld), the mainstream (Hard Target, The Color of Night, The Quick and the Dead), and voiceover work (Tarzan, Superman: Brainiac Attacks). He is also the only actor, other than Sigourney Weaver, to appear in more than one Alien movie — with a small role in Alien³. You can also include Alien vs Predator, if you must.\n\nStill a popular character actor today, Henriksen has been steadily employed since Aliens, racking up an extensive (if not exactly glittering) filmography. An attempt to break into television with X-Files follow-up Millennium (1996-99) introduced him to new fans, but the show wasn’t a hit with the general public. This century, he appeared in the aforementioned Alien vs Predator (2004) playing the human originator of his android character in Aliens, and has largely concentrated on low-budget sci-fi and horror movies. A bit more variety has occurred on television, with appearances in NCIS, Castle, Hannibal, Into the Badlands, and Legends of Tomorrow.\n\nHenriksen is an accomplished painter and potter, and lives in Southern California with his wife Jane Pollack (whom he married in 1995), with whom he has a daughter called Sage. He married his first wife Mary Jane Evans a year before starring in Aliens, but they divorced in 1988. He has one 21-year-old daughter, Alcamy, from that first marriage.\n\nMICHAEL BIEHN as Cpl Dwayne Hicks.\n\nThen, aged 30. Now, aged 61.\n\nAnother actor brought onto Aliens from The Terminator by James Cameron, Biehn subsequently starred in Cameron’s The Abyss (1989) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), although his flashback scene was cut from the theatrical release. After appearing in a run of mainstream duds (Tombstone, Jade), Biehn has mostly focused on straight-to-video fare (Asteroid, Megiddo: The Omega Code 2, Dragon Squad), although he sometimes gets small roles in bigger films (The Rock, Cherry Falls).\n\nMore recently, Biehn’s cult appeal got him a role in Robert Rodriguez’s Planet Terror (2007) and he was in early talks to appear in Avatar, which fell through. Aliens fans will have enjoyed his reprisal of Hicks for the otherwise poorly-received Aliens: Colonial Marines video game from 2013. More recently, in 2015 he appeared in the made-for-TV movie The Scorpion King 4: Quest for Power.\n\nAt the time of making Aliens, Biehn was in a six-year marriage to Carlene Olson, but they divorced in 1987. He married Gina Marsh in 1988, but they divorced in 2004. He has a total of four children from both marriages — twins Devon and Taylor (now aged 24) with Carlene, and Caelan Michael (now aged 16) and Alexander (now aged 5) with Marsh. He’s been in relationship with actress Jennifer Blanc since 2009. Interestingly, he’s also good friends with actor Brian Austin Green, who played his Terminator character’s brother in TV spin-off Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.\n\nPAUL REISER as Carter Burke.\n\nThen, aged 29. Now, aged 60.\n\nAfter playing corporate slimeball Carter in Aliens, Reiser’s only notable big-screen roles of the past 20 years have been Beverly Hills Cop II (1987), The Story Of Us (1999) and One Night at McCool’s (2001). Instead, he chose to work steadily in a range of comedy-dramas that went straight-to-video, or received limited distribution, and has recently appeared in some original movies on cable channel Showtime.\n\nReiser’s failure to capitalise on Aliens’ success was probably down to his decision to focus on TV work. A year after Aliens he starred in the popular sitcom My Two Dads (1987-90) and followed that hit with Mad About You (1992-99), co-starring Helen Hunt. He made his theatrical debut as a director of Woody Allen’s Writer’s Block and participated in a 2005 Mad About You reunion.\n\nHe’s continued to work steadily over the years, and has staged something of a comeback just lately with appearances in movies like Whiplash (2014), Concussion (2015), and War on Everyone (2016). Right now, he’s perhaps most notable appearing in Amazon Prime’s 1980s-set comedy-drama Red Oaks, and will appear in season 2 of Netflix’s Stranger Things.\n\nBILL PAXTON as Pvt. Hudson.\n\nThen, aged 31. Now, deceased (aged 61).\n\nPaxton has arguably had more success than Sigourney Weaver, if not as much critical acclaim. Following Aliens, he never stopped working and starred alongside his Aliens co-stars Lance Henriksen and Michael Biehn in Near Dark (1987) and Tombstone (1993) respectively. He has also had roles in a mix of popular films, including Predator 2 (1990), Apollo 13 (1995), Twister (1996), Mighty Joe Young (1998), U-571 (2000), Spy Kids 2 (2002) and Thunderbirds (2004).\n\nHaving had a small role in The Terminator (he was the mouthy street punk Arnie got his clothes from) before Aliens, Paxton became something of a “lucky charm” for director James Cameron, who cast him in many of his subsequent films: True Lies (1994), Titanic (1997) and Ghosts of the Abyss (2003). In 2006, Paxton moved into TV to headline HBO’s Big Love, which earned him a Golden Globe nomination for playing the patriarch of a Mormon family, and was recently in the TV adaptation of Training Day.\n\nHe married Louise Newbury in 1987 and they had two children together (James, 23, and Lydia, 20). Tragically, Bill Paxton died unexpectedly from a stroke in February 2017 following complications from heart and aorta surgery. His family released this statement:\n\nIt is with heavy hearts we share the news that Bill Paxton has passed away due to complications from surgery. A loving husband and father, Bill began his career in Hollywood working on films in the art department and went on to have an illustrious career spanning four decades as a beloved and prolific actor and filmmaker. Bill’s passion for the arts was felt by all who knew him, and his warmth and tireless energy were undeniable. We ask to please respect the family’s wish for privacy as they mourn the loss of their adored husband and father.\n\nRest in peace.\n\nWILLIAM HOPE as Lt. Gorman.\n\nThen, aged 31. Now, aged 62.\n\nAfter playing cowardly Gorman in Aliens, Canadian-born Hope went on to appear in a number of flop films, with his most notable credit being Hellbound: Hellraiser II (1988). He moved into television in the ‘90s, appearing on many British shows such as The Vanishing Man (1996) and the sitcoms Drop the Dead Donkey (1996) and Gimme, Gimme, Gimme (1999), before dividing his time between occasional screen roles (Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow) and vocal work in video games. More recently, Hope continued to appear in straight-to-video films and TV series like Ultimate Force (2006) and Midsomer Murders (2007). He made a brief appearance in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and is the voices of the trains Edward and Toby in the new Thomas & Friends children’s series. Outside of his acting, he’s a brown belt in Jiu-Jitsu.\n\nJENETTE GOLDSTEIN as Pvt. Vasquez.\n\nThen, aged. Now, aged.\n\nAfter playing macho Vasquez in Aliens (her movie debut), Goldstein joined her Aliens co-stars Lance Henriksen and Bill Paxton in Near Dark, before going on to star in various films and TV series. Her credits include small roles in Lethal Weapon 2 (1989), Star Trek Generations (1994), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) and Clockstoppers (2002). Aliens director James Cameron also cast her as John Connor’s stepmother in Terminator 2 (1991) and as an Irish mother in Titanic (1997).\n\nThe majority of Goldstein’s work has been on the small screen, with blink-and-miss-it roles on shows like MacGyver (1991), L.A Law (1994), 7th Heaven (1998), ER (1998–00), Six Feet Under (2001), Alias (2003) and 24 (2004). Unfortunately, she’s done very little of note since 2008, beyond a guest star appearance in a 2010 episode of Medium.\n\nShe has worked in theatre throughout her entire career, appearing in plays in New York, Los Angeles and London. She’s currently writing a one-woman show for herself.\n\nMARK ROLSTON as Pvt. Drake.\n\nAge UNKNOWN.\n\nAfter appearing in Aliens, Rolston went on to have an incredibly busy career, appearing in all manner of films and TV shows, such as: RoboCop 2, Body of Evidence, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Scanner Cop, The Shawshank Redemption, Lois & Clark, ER, Babylon 5, Strange Luck, Profit, Hard Rain, Rush Hour, The X-Files, Angel, Dark Angel, Alias, The Shield, Curb Your Enthusiasm, 24, Star Trek Enterprise and CSI:NY.\n\nHis roles are usually fairly minor and he usually appears in just a few episodes of each series. More recently he has appeared in TVs Reaper, Cold Case and provided a voice in a Turko video game. He also appeared in Saw V (2009), reprised Drake for the Aliens: Colonial Marines game, and has provided the voice of Kolivan in Netflix’s Voltron animation. Away from acting, he likes to play golf and enjoys yoga.\n\nDANIEL KASH as Pvt. Spunkmeyer.\n\nThen, aged 27. Now, aged 58.\n\nAliens was Canadian Kash’s first movie. He went on to star in Street Legal (1991–92), 3 episodes of the RoboCop TV series, Law & Order, had a recurring role in Due South, appeared in 3 episodes of Goosebumps (1998), Relic Hunter (2001), Mutant X (2003) and was a bodyguard in Lucky Number Slevin (2006). He made his directorial debut in 2001 with an award-winning short film about a phobic superhero called Germgirl, following it up with the shorts Flip Phone (2003) and For Lease (2007).\n\nKash is a fitness fanatic and channels that into running, lifting weights and playing basketball, has been married to actress-producer Hayley Tyson since the mid-’80s and they divides their time between L.A and Toronto. More recently, he’s appeared in video games like Watch Dogs (2014) as antagonist Damien Brenks, and has provided multiple voices in the Metal Gear Solid series.\n\nTIP TIPPING as Pvt. Crowe.\n\nThen, aged 28. Now, deceased (aged 35 in 1993).\n\nOriginally a Royal Marine Commando and SAS soldier, Tipping became a stuntman by trade and only had a few acting credits before Aliens. Before then, he performed stunts in movies such as Octopussy (1983), Krull (1983), Never Say Never Again (1983), Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom (1984), Lifeforce (1985) and Death Wish 3 (1985).\n\nAfter appearing in Aliens as Private Crowe, Tipping embraced both aspects of his job: he helped with stunt-work on Willow (1988), Batman (1989), 7 episodes of Doctor Who (1988-89), Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves (1991) and dozens more. He also appeared in front of the camera in small roles on Doctor Who (1988), Casualty, The Bill, Boon, Inspector Morse, Bergerac, Chancer, and Bottom (he was the burglar Richie and Eddie captured in that classic episode!)\n\nTipping tragically died while filming for BBC rescue reconstruction series 999 in 1993, after his parachute failed to open during a skydive over Alnwick, England."
