        "text": "Um guys, Chrishell Stause from Selling Sunset has just landed a role in a Netflix Christmas rom-com and honestly, I didn’t know I needed this film until now. The two major comforts in life are Netflix’s trashy festive films and Selling Sunset, and now those two worlds have collided in the most perfect way ever.\n\nChrishell has been cast in (possibly the trashiest name ever) Hot Frosty, a festive romantic film which sees Lacey Chabert (Janis from Mean Girls) take the lead role. Others in the cast include Dustin Milligan (Schitt’s Creek), Craig Robinson (Killing It), Joe Lo Truglio (Brooklyn 99), Katy Mixon (Mike & Molly) and Lauren Holly (Dumb and Dumber).\n\nThe film follows a woman called Cathy, who two years after losing her husband magically brings a handsome snowman to life. Netflix, what are you doing to me! The Netflix synopsis adds: “Through his naiveté, the snowman helps Cathy to laugh, feel and love again, as the two fall for each other just in time for the holidays…and before he melts.” Yes, this is a real plot, of a real-life film.\n\nThe film is set to release on Netflix this holiday season, and speaking of her new role, Chrishell told Tudum: “I absolutely love Christmas, so to walk up to a set that is a full town completely decked out, I got instantly excited!”\n\nTalking about working alongside Lacey Chabert, she added: “She is the absolute sweetest. When someone is the star of the movie and yet so gracious to everyone regardless of how big their part is, it makes for such a happy crew and experience.”\n\nI can’t wait.\n\nFor all the latest Netflix news, drops, quizzes and memes like The Holy Church of Netflix on Facebook.\n\nRelated stories recommended by this writer:\n\n• Romances and trips together: What the Emily in Paris cast have been up to ahead of season four\n\n• Selling Sunset’s Bre sued for over $12million by previous employees over ‘vulgar behaviour’"
