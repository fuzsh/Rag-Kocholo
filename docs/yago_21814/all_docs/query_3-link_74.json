        "text": "sundown town, in U.S. history, a town that excluded nonwhite people—most frequently African Americans—from remaining in town after sunset. More generally, sundown town is used to describe a place where the resident population was through deliberate action made to be overwhelmingly composed of white people.\n\nThe methods for enforcing such racial segregation ranged from episodes of collective violence such as public lynchings to ongoing housing discrimination enacted via exclusionary covenants that prevented Black people from owning property. Most sundown towns arose between about 1890, after the Reconstruction era ended, and 1968, when the Fair Housing Act prohibited racial discrimination in the sale, rental, financing, or advertising of housing. Sundown towns coincided with a period in which Black Americans lost rights that had been gained immediately following the American Civil War (1861–65). The term sundown town originated in the numerous signs that were posted at the limits of such towns warning African Americans: “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on You in ____.”\n\nAfter the end of the American Civil War and the passage of the Reconstruction amendments, African Americans occupied political offices and, though still concentrated in the states of the South, were dispersing geographically across the country. However, from the 1870s onward, a national backlash to the increasingly racially integrated politics and economy of the country gained strength, and white supremacist control reasserted itself, both in the Deep South and elsewhere. In the West, for example, rising anti-Chinese sentiments led to the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 and the expulsion of Chinese people from many small towns, resulting in their concentration in urban Chinatowns. These actions were soon followed by the reassertion of white control in the South through the creation of the Jim Crow legal regime and its legal confirmation in Plessy v. Ferguson.\n\nSundown towns were a major consequence of this hardening of racial attitudes and the regression in basic civil rights for Black people and other minorities. The large majority of these towns were in the Midwest, Appalachia, the Ozarks, and the West, whereas relatively few existed in the Deep South. Beginning about 1890, many towns and counties across the country that had mixed populations of Black and white people found pretexts to expel their Black residents. Such expulsions were accomplished often through violence, in which an accusation against one Black person of committing a crime or misdeed would cause white residents to blame the whole local Black community, which would then be forced out through violence and arson. Other towns became sundown towns through social and economic coercion, as in those that adopted ordinances that either excluded Black people from owning property in the town or refused city services to prospective Black residents. The sundown curfew was enforced by both law enforcement and vigilante action by white residents.\n\nThe result of this movement was a narrowing of the places that Black people could safely live and the extreme concentration of Black populations in restricted urban neighborhoods (called ghettos). According to historian James Loewen in the book Sundown Towns (2005), in 39 states in which sundown towns were created, 31 states showed an increase in the number of counties with fewer than 10 Black residents from 1890 to 1930. This is all the more striking because it overlaps with the Great Migration (1916–70), in which millions of African Americans moved from the South to Northern cities. In Illinois, for example, the state’s overall Black population increased, but rural counties with sundown towns saw their Black populations decline.\n\nAfter World War II, sundown towns shifted from being primarily independent smaller towns in rural counties to being suburbs and parts of major metropolitan areas. Unlike earlier waves of sundown town creation, when towns with a demographic history that included African Americans purposefully became more white over time, many new suburbs were organized from their inception to be virtually all white. Most famously, the several massive Levittown developments—in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, which accounted for some 8 percent of all postwar suburban housing (see Levittown, New York and Levittown, Pennsylvania)—excluded African Americans and Jews from buying homes there. Sundown towns of this period also included places like Dearborn, Michigan, where in 1956 the Ford Motor Company employed 15,000 African American workers at its plant—though they were not allowed to own homes in Dearborn and instead commuted to the city from elsewhere."
