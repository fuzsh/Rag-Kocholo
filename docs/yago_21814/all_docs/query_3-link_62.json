        "text": "E-Notification Service\n\nIf you live or work in a community FilmLA serves, you deserve to know about upcoming filming before production trucks roll into your neighborhood.\n\nFilmLA offers a paper-based Neighborhood Notification service, striving to deliver Notices of Filming to nearby homes and businesses as soon as film permit details are finalized. Usually, that means we are able to provide all affected neighbors with two days’ advance notice. In some areas, we also offer a supplemental email-based notification service, which we are working to expand throughout our service area.\n\nWhether paper-based or electronic, Notices of Filming include details about the upcoming shoot, including a description of the scene to be filmed, anticipated street parking impacts, and more. Notices also include contact information for production companies and for FilmLA, so that we can troubleshoot potential problems before filming begins.\n\nE-Notification Service Areas\n\nFilmLA’s supplemental e-Notification service is not currently available in all areas.
