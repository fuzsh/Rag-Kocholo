        "text": "The city of West Hollywood announces the debut of the next exhibitions in the city’s Moving Image Media Art program. “KCosmosis,” a short film from artist Bomi Yook makes its debut on the Invisible Frame billboard, located at 8743 Sunset Blvd., and will air at the top of every hour for 10.5 minutes. “Aunties on Sunset,” a short film from niceaunties, makes its worldwide debut on the Streamlined Arbor billboard, located at 9157 Sunset Blvd., and will air at the top of and at 20- and 40- minutes past every hour for 3.5 minutes. Both works will be on exhibition from June 1-Sept. 30.\n\nMIMA is an ongoing exhibition series of moving image media artworks on multiple digital billboards at various locations along Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood. The goals of the MIMA program are to foster cultural equity, expand accessibility, inspire conversation and enhance the human experience of the Sunset Strip. The Invisible Frame billboard, located at 8743 Sunset Boulevard displays artwork that addresses issues of transparency, inclusion, perspective and illusions.\n\nThe artwork “K-Cosmosis” explores the blended nature of cosmologies within Korean mythology and metaphysics. Informed by feminist and queer philosophies, the artist invites viewers to see the world through osmosis rather than duality to reveal profound connections.\n\nBomi Yook is a Korean Canadian artist working in computer-generated immersive media, experimental animation and video performance. The historically significant building that sits at the base of the Streamlined Arbor billboard at 9157 Sunset Blvd. inspires artwork as an authentic reexamination of cultural identity, by amplifying the voices of those silenced and marginalized.\n\nSince the beginning of the moving image, women over 65 have been the punchline or invisible in contemporary media. However, the artist, niceaunties, portrays older women with fond respect and reverence. They believe (based on the 11 aunties they grew up with) that aunties should be celebrated as valuable witnesses to history. The artist understands that those who disregard the past are condemned to repeat it.\n\nBased out of Singapore, niceaunties is an artist and designer who works in new media and architectural spaces and holds a BA in Architecture from National University in Singapore. The Moving Image Media Art Program is a Hollywood exhibition series administered by the city’s arts division, as part of its Art on the Outside Program, and is presented with the Sunset Arts and Advertising Program. MIMA offers artists the opportunity, and the funding, to create immediate and ambitious works of art that engage with the unique visual landscape of the Sunset Strip.\n\nMIMA enables artists to occupy, contest and play with the definition and uses of public space and manifest moments of connection and spectacle. Artists exhibited in the program are selected from the MIMA Prequalified List, a rolling, open-call for moving image media artists, curators and non-profit arts organizations, with applications reviewed bi-annually by the city of West Hollywood’s Arts and Cultural Affairs Commission in May and November. The MIMA Prequalified List includes a diverse list of artists of all career levels; from emerging to internationally recognized.
