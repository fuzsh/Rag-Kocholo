        "text": "His Majesty King Norodom Sihamoni is the son of His Majesty the King Father Norodom\n\nSihanouk and Her Majesty the Queen Mother Norodom Monineath Sihanouk of Cambodia.\n\nThe king was born on 14 May 1953, in Phnom Penh.\n\nHe completed his primary schooling at the Norodom School and his secondary schooling\n\nat the Lycee Descartes both in Phnom Penh.\n\nKing Sihamoni is the leading artist of the Cambodian Royal Family and has always\n\nbeen devoted to the promotion of Cambodia's cultural heritage through his personal\n\nparticipation in films, classical dance, ballet, exhibitions and publications.\n\nIn 1967, at the age of fourteen, he was the star of the film \"The Little Prince\"\n\nshot in Cambodia by His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk. During his holidays the king\n\nstudied classical Khmer dance with his sister, Princess Buppha Devi.\n\nThe king then spent some time at Prague's High School in Czechoslovakia, where he\n\nobtained his High School Certificate in 1970, prior to his entering the National\n\nConservatory of Prague, where he undertook courses in dance, music and theatre. In\n\n1971, His Majesty obtained the First Prize in the course of classical dance of the\n\nNational Conservatory of Prague.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1975, the king followed higher studies in dance, music and theatre at\n\nthe Academy of Musical Art in Prague. He graduated the same year from the Academy\n\nof Musical Art of Prague.\n\nHe then proceeded to undertake higher cinematography studies at the National Academy\n\nof Cinematography of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Pyongyang.\n\nHis studies in Pyongyang were suddenly interrupted, in April 1976, by a fake telegram,\n\nsigned Norodom Sihanouk, summoning him back to Phnom Penh, where he joined his parents\n\nand other members of the Cambodian Royal Family as prisoners of the brutal regime\n\nof Pol Pot.\n\nThe king recalls that during that time they were allowed to see no one, had no staff\n\nto help them and that for food they had to grow vegetables and fruits in the gardens\n\nof the Royal Palace. Twice a week, their Khmer Rouge guards gave them rice and fish.\n\nAs the Vietnamese tanks approached Phnom Penh, the Royal Family was moved to a smaller\n\nhouse in central Phnom Penh but remained under close guard for fear that the Vietnamese\n\nmay try to seize His Majesty the King Father.\n\nThen, in early January 1979, as Phnom Penh was about to fall, the King Father, the\n\nQueen Mother and their two sons, aunt and a few other persons were taken to China\n\nby a special plane sent by the Chinese authorities.\n\nHis Majesty served then as Private Secretary to His Majesty the King Father for two\n\nyears in China and Korea, where His Majesty the King Father organized a liberation\n\nmovement.\n\nIn 1981, the king requested his parents' permission to travel to France and he became\n\nprofessor of classical dance and artistic pedagogy at the Marius Petipa Conservatory,\n\nthe Gabriel Faure Conservatory and the W. A. Mozart Conservatory of the City of Paris.\n\nThe king formed his own troupe of dancers, known as Ballet Deva, which performed\n\npieces choreographed by the king himself. The group has appeared in France, in China\n\nand the P.D.R. of Korea and has tried to keep Cambodia's cultural heritage alive.\n\nThe king also made two ballet films \"Dream\" and \"Four Elements\".\n\nIn 1990, the king became Director General and Artistic Director of the Khmer Cinematographic\n\nSociety \"Khemara Pictures\". Following the Peace Agreements of October 1991,\n\nthe king was unanimously chosen by the members of the Supreme National Council of\n\nCambodia as Ambassador, Permanent Representative of Cambodia to the United Nations.\n\nOn 30 August 1993, His Majesty was Appointed Ambassador, Permanent Representative\n\nof Cambodia to UNESCO.\n\nBut his newly acquired diplomatic functions did not prevent His Majesty from keeping\n\nup with his artistic talents. In 1992, the king was the star of a new film shot in\n\nCambodia by his father, King Norodom Sihanouk. \"My Village at Sunset\" and\n\nduring the 1994/ 1995 season of creations and new versions of the young ballet of\n\nFrance, he created \"Duel\", a ballet in which under the influence of Russian\n\nballet, he concentrated on giving an important role to men, who normally do not have\n\nsuch a role in traditional Khmer dance.\n\nHis Majesty was elevated to the rank of Sdech Krom Khun (Great Prince) on 1 February\n\n1994.\n\nThe king is fluent in Khmer, French and Czech. He has a good command of both English\n\nand Russian.\n\nHis Majesty was awarded the Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Monisaraphon and is\n\na Grand Officer of the French Legion of Honour. He was crowned as King of Cambodia\n\non October 29, 2004.\n\nReprinted with permission from the Royal House of Cambodia by Julio A.Jeldres."
