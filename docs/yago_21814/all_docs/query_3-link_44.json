Look for a viewpoint that juts into the canyon with views both east and west.\n\nOn Hermit Road, Hopi Point is unquestionably a desirable viewpoint for sunset, it attracts crowds of people and buses, especially in the summer.\n\nAlso along Hermit Road, Mohave, and Pima Points offer spectacular views of the canyon, are less congested, and allow you to see the Colorado River a mile below!\n\nPoints along Desert View Drive that offer great east and west panoramas include Yaki, Navajo, and Desert View.\n\nLipan Point, near Desert View, offers incredible views of the canyon with the San Francisco Peaks to the south, the distant Painted Desert, and extensive stretches of the river below.\n\nFor a memorable sunrise, try Mather or Yaki Points.\n\nSunrise Suggestions\n\nArrive 30 minutes before the sun clears the horizon and stay an hour or longer after. Dress warmly; even summer dawns can be quite chilly.\n\nSunset Suggestions\n\nPlan to arrive at your viewpoint as much as 90 minutes before sunset and stay at least 10 minutes after the sun has set and no longer illuminates the buttes and pinnacles in the canyon, don't rush off —the sky may light up red, pink or orange.\n\nBetter yet, stay around as the sky grows dark. Grand Canyon offers some of the blackest skies and brightest stars found anywhere.\n\nWhich is Best, Sunrise or Sunset?\n\nSunrise: If the night has been calm and clear, sunrise may offer great clarity before breezes stir dust into the atmosphere. Colder morning temperatures and the difficulty of rising early frequently result in fewer people at canyon viewpoints.\n\nSunset: During the summer viewpoints can be crowded. Late summer may bring dramatic thunderstorms, but too many clouds could mean no sunlight in the canyon. Just the right amount of dust or smoke can make a sunset more colorful.\n\nWhat Can I Expect to See?\n\nPredicting the quality of a sunset at Grand Canyon is as uncertain as predicting the weather. Air quality, clouds, time of the day, and season will all contribute to your view. Early geologist Clarence Dutton observed that at sunset \"the colossal buttes expand in every dimension.\" How do you visualize the changes of daybreak or sunset?\n\nChanges in the position of the sun and variations in the sky transform colors, shadows, and shapes in the canyon. Storm clouds may break to reveal a sunlight flooded sky or perhaps a rainbow. John Wesley Powell described clouds playing in the canyon as if they were \"the children of the heavens.\"\n\nThunderstorms are common in July, August, and early September. An exposed, rocky point is not where you want to be during a thunderstorm. A gap of less than 30 seconds between the flash of lightning and the rumble of thunder indicates that it is time to retreat to shelter. Stay away from solitary or tall trees.\n\nIn June, 2019, Grand Canyon National Parks was awarded Full International Dark Sky Status. Read the June 17, 2019 news release >\n\nGrand Canyon National Park has now become one of the most complex, highly-visited, pristine night-sky sanctuaries on the planet.\n\nWhere are Facilities Available?\n\nRestrooms: Restroom facilities are located at Yavapai and Desert View Points and the Visitor Center. Chemical toilets are placed at Hopi, Yaki and Grandview Points.\n\nWater: Water bottle filling stations can be found near: Hermit's Rest, Bright Angel Trailhead, Verkamp's Visitor Center, Yavapai Point, Grand Canyon Visitor Center, and the South Kaibab Trailhead. You should carry your own water, if you plan to spend some time at other viewpoints.\n\nAccessible Overlooks: For a listing of viewpoints that have wheelchair access and/or windshield views, download our Accessibility Guide (5.8 MB PDF file)\n\nLooking for Something Special?\n\nWalk the Canyon Rim Trail:\n\nAs you follow the mostly level, winding trail along the rim of the canyon in the late afternoon, you experience the changing light and shadows in the canyon from changing viewpoints.The Rim Trail stretches from the South Kaibab Trailhead west to Hermits Rest, a distance of approximately thirteen miles (21km) It can be reached at many points, making strolls of various lengths possible. Download the Canyon Rim Trail bulletin (287 kb PDF)\n\nWhen walking or cycling at the Grand Canyon, make sure to take your time and carry food and water with you. The South Rim of Grand Canyon averages 7,000 feet / 2,134 meters above sea level. Visitors with respiratory or heart problems may experience difficulties. Exercising at this elevation can be strenuous."
