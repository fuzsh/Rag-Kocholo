Drenched in champagne and cynicism, SUNSET BLVD. focuses the lens on the ambitions and frustrations of its characters and puts their intoxicating need for fame and adoration in stark close-up. The New York Times declares, “This bravura new revival belongs to the here and now. Nicole Scherzinger gives a career-defining performance.” And The Washington Post hails, “This killer production is theater at its devilish best. It slays you.”\n\nA sold out smash hit in London’s West End, you won’t want to miss this spectacular revival!\n\nPlease note: to receive a Member discount you MUST be registered with an online account.
