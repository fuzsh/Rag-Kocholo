        "text": "WILLIAM HOLDEN:\n\nAt some point, \"Sunset Boulevard\" (1950) played at The Silver Screen. I instantly fell in love - both with the movie itself and with its handsome 32-year old male lead, William Holden. Now I had two favorite movies - aside from \"Gone With The Wind\" of course - both from 1950, \"Sunset Boulevard\" and \"All About Eve.\"\n\n\"Mad About The boy!\"\n\nThere appears to be a distinctive pattern developing here with all my so-called \"favorite\" movies and the theatrical / Hollywood theme that runs throughout each of them. Honestly, I hadn't noticed this before. I can't say it's particularly surprising.\n\nConsistent with my good taste in film, \"Sunset Boulevard\" received high critical and popular praise when first released. Nominated for eleven Academy Awards and winning three, this movie is widely accepted as a true classic, often cited as one of the greatest films of American cinema. Deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the U.S. Library of Congress, \"Sunset Boulevard\" was included in the first group of films selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1989.\n\nNow considered an example of film noir, \" Sunset Boulevard\" was directed and co-written by Billy Wilder, and produced and co-written by Charles Brackett. According to Brackett, he and Wilder never considered anyone except Gloria Swanson for the role of Norma Desmond.\n\nWilder, however, had a different recollection. He recalled first wanting Mae West and Marlon Brando for the leads, but never approached either of them with an offer. They also asked Norma Shearer if she would portray Norma Desmond, but she rejected the role due to both her retirement and distaste for the subject matter of the film. At the time, they were considered having Shearer play Miss Desmond with Fred MacMurray as her Joe. They approached Greta Garbo with the role, but she had no interest whatsoever in the project, wanting instead to be alone. Wilder and Brackett then visited Mary Pickford, but before they even discussed the plot with her, Wilder realized she would consider their proposal of a role in which she would have an affair with a man half her age an insult, and they graciously departed without mentioning it to her. They had been considered pairing Mary Pickford and Montgomery Clift together to play Norma and Joe.\n\nAccording to Wilder, he finally asked George Cukor for advice, and Cukor brilliantly suggested Gloria Swanson, one of the most feted actresses of the silent-screen era. Known for her beauty, talent and extravagant lifestyle at the peak of her career in 1925, Swanson was said to have received 10,000 fan letters in a single week. And incidentally, from 1920 until the early 1930s she had lived on Sunset Boulevard in an elaborate Italianate palace.\n\nIn so many ways she resembled the Norma Desmond character and, like the fictitious movie character Norma, had been unable to make a smooth transition into talking pictures. The similarities between the two ended there, though, as Swanson had more graciously accepted the end of her film career and in the early 1930s moved to New York City where she worked in radio and, from the mid-1940s, in television.\n\nAlthough Swanson was not seeking a comeback (or a \"return\" as Norma Desmond would insist), she was intrigued when Wilder discussed the role with her. Swanson was chagrined at the notion of submitting to a screen test, saying she had \"made twenty films for Paramount. Why do they want me to audition?\" Her reaction was later echoed in the screenplay when Norma Desmond declares, \"without me there wouldn't be any Paramount.\" In her memoir, Swanson recalled asking Cukor if it was unreasonable to refuse the screen test. He replied that Norma Desmond was the role for which she would be remembered, \"If they ask you to do ten screen tests, do ten screen tests, or I will personally shoot you.\" His enthusiasm convinced Swanson to participate, and she signed a $50,000 contract for what has undoubtedly become the role of her lifetime. In a 1975 interview, Wilder recalled Swanson's reaction with the observation, \"There was a lot of Norma in her, you know.\"\n\nAnd so, Montgomery Clift was signed to play Joe Gillis for $5,000 per week for a guaranteed twelve weeks. Just before the start of filming, however, he withdrew from the project claiming his role of a young man involved with an older woman was too close to the character he had played in \"The Heiress\" (1949) with Olivia de Havilland, a part in which he felt he had been unconvincing. An infuriated Wilder responded, \"If he's any kind of actor, he could be convincing making love to any woman.\"\n\nForced to consider actors already available in-house at Paramount, Wilder and Brackett focused on William Holden, who had made an impressive debut in \"Golden Boy\" (1939). Following his critically acclaimed performance in \"Our Town\" (1940), Holden had served in the military during World War II. His return to the screen following the service had been fairly successful. So Holden was enthusiastic about the script and eagerly accepted the role of Joe Gillis. He did not know that his salary was $39,000 less than that offered to Montgomery Clift.\n\nErich von Stroheim, a leading film director from the 1920s who had actually directed Gloria Swanson, was signed to play Max, Norma's faithful servant and protector. For the role of Betty Schaefer, Wilder wanted a newcomer who could project a wholesome and ordinary image to contrast with Swanson's flamboyant and obsessive Desmond. He chose Nancy Olson, who had recently been considered for the role of Delilah in DeMille's \"Samson and Delilah.\"\n\nThe film takes its name from the real and rather infamous Sunset Boulevard, a roadway that runs through Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. The actual street Sunset Boulevard has been associated with Hollywood film production since 1911, when the town's first film studio opened there. Film workers lived modestly in the growing neighborhood, but during the 1920s profits and salaries rose to unprecedented levels. With the advent of the star system, luxurious homes noted for their often incongruous grandeur were built in the area. The stars were the subject of public fascination throughout the world as magazines and newspapers reported the grandiose excesses of their lives.\n\nNorma Talmadge has been described as \"the obvious if unacknowledged source of Norma Desmond, the grotesque, predatory silent movie queen\" of the film, \"itself a malignant misrepresentation of Talmadge, starring an actress [Swanson] who had been her rival in the 1920s.\" But it's also been claimed that the character's name Norma Desmond is a combination of the names of silent film actress Mabel Normand and director William Desmond Taylor, a close friend who was murdered in 1922 under suspicious circumstances.\n\nAs a young man, Billy Wilder was interested in American culture, with much of his interest fueled by the country's films. In the late 1940s, many of the grand Hollywood houses remained mired in the specter of past glory days along Sunset Boulevard, and Wilder, now a Los Angeles resident, found them to be part of his everyday world.\n\nMany former stars from the silent era still lived in these palatial residences, although most were no longer involved in the film business and many of the homes had fallen into disrepair along with their occupants' movie careers. Wilder wondered how they spent their time now that their proverbial parade had passed them by, and began imagining the story of a star who had lost her celebrity and box-office appeal.\n\nJoe to Norma: \"Norma, you're a woman of fifty. Now grow up. There's nothing tragic about being fifty. Not unless you try to be twenty-five.\"\n\nThe eleven Academy Award nominations in 1950 for \"Sunset Boulevard\" were exceeded that year only by the fourteen received by \"All About Eve.\" The Bette Davis classic won six awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Most critics and Hollywood pundits in 1950 predicted that the Best Actress award would go either to Gloria Swanson or to Bette Davis and were surprised (and not pleasantly so) that the recipient was newcomer Judy Holliday for her comedic role in \"Born Yesterday.\"\n\nSwanson would recall the reaction in the press following Holliday's win, \"It slowly dawned on me that they were asking for a larger-than-life scene, or better still, a mad scene. More accurately, they were trying to flush out Norma Desmond.\"\n\nSome years later, Bette Davis bluntly yet accurately stated that she and Swanson had \"cancelled each other out\" in the Oscar voting. And in a later 1982 interview, she spoke frankly of her admiration for Swanson's performance, saying, \"If she'd won, I'd have shouted hooray. She was sensational, just fantastic.\"\n\nAnd to my youthful eyes (even still to my middle-aged peepers), so was William Holden both sensational and fantastic!\n\nYUM!!!\n\nIt All Started With A Corpse (This article was first published in \"The Independent on Sunday\" (London) on April 4, 1999):\n\nThe great Billy Wilder's macabre fable about Hollywood lives on. David Thomson, from the Independent on Sunday in London, looks back 50 years to the making of Sunset Boulevard.\n\nIn the spring of 1949, Billy Wilder was in overdrive, cursing feeble actors and wondering if his new, tricky project could ever work. Tricky? Late in l948, when Wilder and his partner, Charles Brackett, showed Paramount the first 60 pages of script, they wrote on it, \"Due to the peculiar nature of the project, we ask all our co-workers to regard it as top secret.\"\n\nThey knew there were going to be eyebrows raised. They had one central character - a half-crazy relic from silent pictures, a diva dreaming of comeback in a mouldy mansion on Sunset. And the other was a screenwriter who'd be dead when the picture started, but telling the story to the other stiffs in the county morgue. Wilder was eager to shoot that scene. And things looked up when Montgomery Clift agreed to play the writer. He had opened that year in Red River, and no one was in greater demand.\n\nNot that this was an actors' showcase. It was one of those movies that said actors were close to nuts. There would be a sour, sardonic tone to Sunset Boulevard -- that's what they called it -- that suggested Hollywood itself was a sick place, and that the widespread human urge to be in the movies was a malaise. \"So why are you in pictures, still, Billy?\" someone might have asked. And Billy would likely have answered, \"Because I'm the sickest of them all.\"\n\nThat spring, Wilder was close to 43, and hotter than Clift. Born in a village near Krakow, he had been raised in Vienna, first as a journalist, then a screenwriter. He was a counter-punching wit, not far from cruel sometimes - a joker, a survivor, ambitious, dark in his assumptions about human nature. He had a lot of cronies, and plenty of women, but few got close to him - because he never trusted anyone. He was too volatile, too itchy with killer remarks.\n\nHe arrived in Hollywood in 1934 (his mother and other relatives would die in concentration camps), and wrote screenplays - Bluebeard's Eighth Wife for Lubitsch (written with Charles Brackett), and then, as a team, Midnight, Ninotchka, Hold Back the Dawn and Ball of Fire. By 1942, they had written The Major and the Minor, Wilder's first American directing job, and thereafter they were a production partnership on Five Graves to Cairo, The Lost Weekend and A Foreign Affair. The Lost Weekend - with Ray Milland as a drunk - had been a typical Wilder experience. Hollywood said the project was too bleak and unappealing. But he ignored them, made a tough, nasty picture and won Oscars for best picture, director, screenplay, and for Milland. There was another knock-out in Wilder's record: without Brackett, he had done Double Indemnity, which got nominations for picture, direction, script and for Barbara Stanwyck as maybe the most glowing bitch in all film noir.\n\nWilder's world view was blunt, if gloating; his best jokes left an acid aftertaste. In Double Indemnity, an easy-going insurance salesman commits murder because he's infatuated with a snake; in The Lost Weekend, a brittle charmer tells any lie to protect a bottle of booze from discovery. And in Sunset Boulevard, Wilder promised, there'd be a murder. \"Well, who murders whom?\" asked Gloria Swanson, an actress he was talking to. To tell you the truth, he said, I haven't made up my mind yet.\n\nHe was lying: he had the idea already of the hack writer whose most saleable story concerns his own death, with the great lady of the silent screen being limo'd to the nuthouse. But maybe Swanson didn't see herself as a killer. So he wouldn't offer that until he'd got her hooked and signed. After all, he and Brackett had been up to see Mary Pickford about the part first, but as they sat in one of the salons at Pickfair, and confronted America's sweetheart - then aged 56 - they couldn't admit what they had to offer her because it seemed so squalid. Who could believe in Mary losing her mind, keeping a pet monkey and a gigolo, and killing the latter when he turned on her?\n\nBut Swanson was different. There was a wild, fiery look in her eyes - there always had been. And she was not nearly as sweet, modest or practical as Mary. Gloria believed in herself. That was a vital thing about Norma Desmond - truth to tell, Norma knew it was the world that had gone crazy. Gloria Swanson was 52 in 1949, and in tigress condition. She had just rid herself of her fifth husband (with only legal violence); she had lived in Europe for a while and been a marquise for a few years. She got Wilder and Brackett in an instant: the Viennese Jew was \"elfin, witty, confident and a bit overactive\"; Brackett was \"quieter, more refined, the New York, Eastern type\". She said she wasn't sure about the part or the project - the script was unfinished, still - but she was lying, too. Like Norma Desmond, she'd have done anything for a second chance.\n\nThen Clift got cold feet, despite being offered $5,000 a week for 12 weeks. Maybe he'd reasoned that it wasn't right for his clean-cut image to play a gigolo, a bad writer, and someone who ended up dead at the end (and the beginning as it turns out) of the picture. Dead lacked dignity or class. Maybe it was Libby Holman, the New York singer with whom he was having an affair of sorts, who was nearly 50 herself, said look what people were going to say. So Clift got out of the deal - he would do \"A Place in the Sun\" with Elizabeth Taylor instead.\n\nWilder spat blood, looked around, and thought of William Holden. Holden had been a second-level star for a decade, without ever having a big picture. But Wilder liked the slippery air to Holden, his readiness for compromise, or putting on a bright face to hide shabby truths. The more he thought about it, the better - and cheaper - Holden was for Joe Gillis. But Holden knew the role was his greatest challenge. He fretted about it with Wilder, until the director said, \"Look, you know Bill Holden, don't you?\" \"Well, sure,\" said the actor.\n\n\"That's who you're playing,\" said Wilder, with that grin of his, as the hook went into the soft part of your body. It was another side of Wilder's wicked humour that this film would be full of inside touches. They'd shoot on Sunset, even if the mansion they found for Norma was actually the Getty place on Wilshire. They'd shoot at Schwab's drugstore, and on the Paramount lot. There'd even be a scene where Cecil B. DeMille (one of Swanson's directors in the 1920s) would play himself. And in the key supporting role of Max von Mayerling (Norma's butler now, as well as keeper of her flame, but director and husband in the past), Wilder cast Erich von Stroheim who had played Rommel in his \"Five Graves to Cairo\" (1943).\n\nStroheim was a sadder Hollywood outcast than Norma Desmond. He had been a master director and an unhindered ego once. He had filmed \"Greed\" (1924) as a 10- hour epic. But the system, in the form of Irving Thalberg, had humbled him and cut the picture down to two hours (in which form it remains one of the great silent films). Stroheim's career had lurched. But \"Queen Kelly\" (1929) was to be his comeback - a film starring Gloria Swanson and funded by her lover, Joseph Kennedy. But it all went wrong and Gloria had fired Stroheim. By the late 1930s he was washed up as a director. But he was a wandering actor - most notably as the prison commandant in Jean Renoir's \"La Grande Illusion\" (1937).\n\nWho better for the humiliated Max, thought Wilder. And he added one finishing touch: when Norma shows Joe one of her old movies, it's \"Queen Kelly,\" with Max working the projector. In the spring and early summer of 1949, they shot Sunset Boulevard, without too much difficulty. Swanson and Holden were as good as Wilder had guessed. People like Buster Keaton and Hedda Hopper came in for the bridge game. Nancy Olson was the new girl Gillis falls in love with. And the picture opened with Holden talking to the other corpses, and his voice-over leading you into the story.\n\nThat summer, they previewed the picture in Evanston, Illinois. As soon as the dead bodies started talking, the audience went into fits of laughter. They never sobered up for the rest of the film. In Poughkeepsie, New York, they got the same reaction. So the morgue was cut (does it exist still, in the Paramount vaults?) and the whole picture was set up on Gillis, face down in Norma's pool, dead, but, like any writer, still pitching his story. It was a striking image - with us, the audience, at the bottom of the pool, looking up at Joe and the cops. Suddenly the tone of the thing worked. There was laughter in the picture, but it was a macabre fairy tale about the magic kingdom.\n\nMonths later, at a trade screening, Louis B. Mayer, production head at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, railed at Wilder for biting the hand that fed him.\n\n\"Fuck you,\" said Wilder.\n\nHollywood rolled over. Mayer was fired a couple of years later. The system laughed at itself, and became more entranced with its sickly legend. A kind of campness was born. \"Sunset Boulevard\" played beautifully. It always has. It was nominated for 11 Oscars. But it lost in all crucial areas to Joseph Mankiewicz's \"All About Eve,\" another warning about actors. Still, \"Eve\" was made from the point of view of a band of brothers and sisters who love theatre and despise Eve Harrington. \"Sunset Boulevard\" is more entrapping. It asks whether Norma is the crazy one. Or Joe. Or us, for falling for such melodrama. That case is not settled yet. And Billy Wilder -- bless his tricky heart -- was 93 in June 1999 , and a prize guest at every Hollywood party."
