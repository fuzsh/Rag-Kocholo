        "text": "We have left Phnom Penh behind and headed to the floating village of Kampong Luong. This is just another ordinary Cambodian village with grocery shops, a school, a hospital, a petrol station and even a pagoda! The only difference from a ‘normal’ village is that the entire village is floating on the Tonlé Sap lake. Amazing! 🙂 Soon a small video about it!\n\n2020, January 28 – Phnom Penh (Cambodia)\n\nIn Phnom Penh we serviced the bike. Jorge went to the garage at 14h00 and returned at 19h00. When I asked him what took him so long, he answered: ‘The mechanic wasn’t feeling well, he was too tired and I ended up doing most of the work’. And then he showed me the proof!\n\n2020, January 25 – Koh Rong island (Cambodia)\n\nSome places are difficult to leave behind. In Koh Rong island it could have been the warm sea, it could have been the hammocks swinging under the palm trees, it could have been the tasty Amok fish or the fact that our tent had a view to the sea and to the sunrise… Eventually, we had to leave, but this place will be kept on our memories for a long long time…\n\n2020, January 21 – Koh Rong island (Cambodia)\n\nA simple night on a Cambodian island, where, when the sun sets, the backpackers on the island meet for music under the stars… The White beach is one of the prettiest beaches of this quiet island off the Cambodian coast.\n\n2020, January 19 – Phnom Penh (Cambodia)\n\nAmazing sunset light in the Neak Banh Teuk Park next to the Independence Monument and the statue of King Norodom Sihanouk. People come here at sunset to exercise or to grab a bite from one of the many street food stalls around and sit on the grass. It is a special atmosphere…\n\n2020, January 18 – Phnom Penh (Cambodia)\n\nWe have just landed in Phnom Penh and feel already immersed in the buzzing nightlife of the capital city… On Monday we head to the coast to reunite with our ‘Poderosita’. May the adventure continue soon!! In the meantime a deserved break by the pool…\n\nOctober November December 2019 – Home\n\n11 September 2019 – Japan\n\nWhat the photo doesn’t show:\n\nI (Anabela) took this photo and then the sumo wrestler looked at me and called me to follow him to the back of the building. Shit! Jorge was distracted with the wrestling practice that he followed from behind a window. Should I follow the wrestler or not? I did! Once there, he asked me for the camera (with our 2,000 EUR lens on it). No way, would I hand him our camera! I inspected his size (and the size of the two other wrestlers that were amused by the situation), thought another half a second, mentally said good-bye to our camera and gave him what he wanted. He took the viewfinder to his eye and started making sounds that sounded like excitement: ‘Wow good camera! I take photos of the three of you’. Which he did though they all ended up being out of focus!\n\n8 September 2019 – Japan\n\nWho says Japan is no country for motorcycling? You can’t see Jorge’s face, but if you could, you would see a grin that meant ‘I can’t have enough of this! Let me ride!’ We searched roads through mountains or forests for the simple reason that they were AMAZING!\n\n16 August 2019 – Japan\n\nNachi Taisha Shrine Pagoda and waterfall. If we had to choose one pagoda in Japan, this would be our selection, because of its location, near the Nachi falls. This is a 133 metres uninterrupted drop, the tallest in the country! Isn’t it beautiful?\n\n12 August 2019 – Japan\n\nThe Arashiyama Bamboo Grove is one of Kyoto’s top sights. We got lucky and witnessed a traditional marriage happening there. It is no surprise that couples choose such a beautiful place for their wedding photos, but there’s another reason for that choice. For Japanese, bamboo is symbolically associated with harmony and balance in one’s life.\n\n8 August – 2019 – South Korea\n\nWe found out that it is possible to spend the night in saunas. How does it work? You pay a ticket (around 10 dollars) to the sauna and afterwards, you head to the resting room where you can sleep as long as you like, including the entire night. Besides a towel, you are also given a pyjama and a blanket. We liked the experience and tried a few saunas in Korea.\n\n24 July – 2019 – South Korea\n\nEven though it was 35 degrees, we had a good time exploring the green tea plantations at Boseong. Besides tea and ice-cream, there’s an entire range of products made with green tea. Have we mentioned that green tea ice-cream is our absolute favourite flavour!\n\n15 July 2019 Russia\n\nWith a short transit visa of 10 days, we found a way to make this transit trip through Russia a comfortable trip. Are oyou curious? We put our motorbike on a cargo train and we boarded the Trans-Siberian for a three day railway trip through Siberia, a distance of almost 4,000 kilometres… If you would like to know more, read our article about the Trans-Siberian.\n\n14 July 2019 – Mongolia\n\nNumbers of our journey through Mongolia:\n\n– 4,150 kilometres (many of which were off-road)\n\n– 30 days\n\n– 8 nights of wild camping (very often in stunning locations)\n\n– 4 nights sleeping in gers (yurts)\n\n– 1 new passion: rose tea with jam\n\n– 2 sandstorms\n\n– 1 stomach upset\n\n– 1 amazing night of stargazing (in the desert)\n\n– 0 flat tires or other technical issues (many nearly-hit potholes)\n\n– 0 falls (yeahhh! Jorge made it without one single fall!!)\n\n– a lot of meat, a few vegetables (not voluntarily)\n\n– a few thunderstorms and some rain (with lovely rainbows)\n\n– a few river crossings, luckily small ones 🙂\n\n– and the desire to come back anytime soon to explore more of this beautiful land! 🇲🇳😍 bayarla! 🙏\n\nThis was one of the prettiest places of Mongolia, Lake Khovd. A couple of days left before we leave Mongolia and we are already nostalgic about leaving behind some of the places we saw and the wonderful people we met. Mongolia deserves a long visit, so that one can travel slow, as distances are long and are made even longer by its never-ending off-road tracks. Let the journey proceed!\n\n30 June 2019 Mongolia\n\nCutting the wool of sheep is one of the herders’ activities in spring (you should be aware that Mongolia is the second biggest producer of cashmere wool after China), but before shearing the wool, it is necessary to catch the animal, and this seems to be one of the kids’ favourite activities. If you want to help, they will be happy with all kind of help. See how Jorge had fun helping to get the sheep\n\n16 June 2019 Mongolia\n\nWe think we forgot to share that we are already in Mongolia! That is because the internet was poor for some days! We are amazed by the landscape, we have had a lot of camping and have had beautiful encounters! Here driving on one of the many dirt roads of Mongolia, with fellow travellers. What a wonderful time we spent together!\n\n10 June 2019 Russia\n\nWe made it to Russia 🇷🇺! After travelling through almost 10 Russian-speaking countries, we finally made it to mother Russia! For days the imaginary music on Anabela’s helmet has been the Russian hymn, and when we passed the border she had such an urge to sing it out loud to the officer checking our luggage! And, “Hey, I read Tolstoy’s Ana Karenina and Gorky’s Mother!”, “In Russian?”, he would probably ask. Still filled with excitement we rode to the next village for the night. When you ask a Russian “How are you”? What do you think he answers?\n\n8 June 2019 Kazakhstan\n\nWhat the photo doesn’t show:\n\nWe are standing 140 kilometres away from a forbidden and atrocious place: For 40 years (1949-89) the Soviet Union exploded more than 400 nuclear bombs at the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, in the heart of the steppe of Kazakhstan. More than 200,000 people living within 45 kms of the site were never informed of the danger they were being exposed to. There is still radioactivity at the site today and, what is more devastating – three generations later – there are still people dying because of this! The site was closed by President Nur Sultan Nazarbayev, and thanks to his politics Kazakhstan possesses no nuclear weapons!\n\n6 June 2019 Kazakhstan\n\nThis is what I call pure luck! We escaped the storm by centimetres! Once we were far enough not to risk a drop, we finally stopped to enjoy the view of this huge cloud full of rain and flashes of lightning. We are now approaching the Kazakh border to enter Russia in two days! The friendly lady at the Embassy – the one that looked at Anabela and said: ‘you on motorbike with him? You crazy!’ – ended up giving us not 5 days as she had told us, but 7 days!!! She probably had a look at the weather forecast and changed her mind! Thank you, Russian people, we love you already! Today we will be driving through what was once one of the most secretive and restricted (and saddest) places in the Soviet Union… Any ideas where we are heading to???\n\n1 June 2019 Kazakhstan\n\nA few days ago we were in Spaask. Spaask is nowadays a memorial of what was once one of the deadliest labour camps (gulags) of Siberia. Being in such a place one needs to ask oneself, why?\n\n– Why did Stalin create more than 400 gulags in Siberia?\n\n– Why did he send there more than 18 million people, and who were these people? Were they really criminals? Or were they innocent people? What was the idea behind the plan of bringing these people to Siberia? Was it another ethnical cleansing? Or was there another reason? You can find the answers to all these questions on our article about the Gulags in Siberia…\n\nMay 2019 (Kyrgyzstan-Kazakhstan)\n\nThe trip has resumed and we are back to Central Asia. After spending a few days in Bishkek to prepare all our gear, we set off to Kazakhstan, where we spent a few days in Almaty, to do some work, but also to visit this amazing city. Afterwards, we followed to the north of the country, towards Nur-Sultan (ex-Astana city). What an impressive city!\n\nMarch-April 2019 (Portugal-Luxembourg)\n\nTime to work on the next issue that will be launched in June. Time to be with family and friends. And time to prepare the trip that will resume in May and will take us to our motorbike that stood the entire winter in Bishkek. Our trip will resume to take us through Kazakhstan-Mongolia-Russia-South Korea and Japan! Come with us\n\nJanuary – February 2019 (Cuba)\n\nWe are ready for the next adventure! While our motorbike was hibernating in a cosy garage in Bishkek, we flew to Cuba, where we spent two months travelling. We got to know a lot and had many unexpected experiences, such as travelling by truck! Our Spring magazine will be entirely dedicated to Cuba.\n\nNovember to December 2018 (Luxembourg-Portugal)\n\nAfter spending two wonderful months in Kyrgyzstan, we had to have another break on this trip because winter was approaching and the first flocks of snow had already fallen when we left Bishkek. We left to Luxembourg where we will stay for one month to launch the diariesof Kyrgyzstan and then we will fly to Portugal to spend Christmas with our family.\n\nSeptember to October 2018 (Kyrgyzstan)\n\nKyrgyzstan ended up becoming another diariesof destination. We could not resist the mountains sprinkled with yurts, inhabited by the hospitable Kyrgyz nomads. Kyrgyzstan is the country of nomadism, as we could observe in the two months that we spent travelling in its mountains.\n\nAugust 2018 (Kazakhstan – Uzbekistan)\n\nThe trip resumed towards Kazakhstan through the Caspian Sea. This crossing with the ferry, from Baku to Aktau (Kazakhstan) is in itself an adventure, as you can read in our article about the Baku-Aktau crossing.\n\nAfter landing, and spending two days on the coast, we took the road, that would lead us through the desert until the Uzbek’s border. Uzbekistan would turn out to be another surprise. We meant to drive through without many stops, but that wouldn’t be so. Alone Khiva, Samarkand and Bukhara were reasons enough to travel slowly. But there was much more than these three pearls…\n\nJuly 2018 (Azerbaijan)\n\nAmazing Iran will be missed! After Iran, we spent one month in Azerbaijan working on the issue of diariesof Iran. We spent one entire month in Baku, and unfortunately did not visit much the rest of the country. We did have the time to explore the city of Baku, which impressed us so much that we hope to return to visit the rest of the country.\n\nMay to June 2018 (Iran)\n\nIran was a box of surprises. A huge box (as Iran is four times the size of Germany) and many sweet surprises, because we were not expecting to be so much spoilt by so warm-hearted people, such rich Persian architecture and such a variety of landscapes. Iran has it all!\n\nWe have dedicated an entire issue of diariesof to Iran, and have also written a few articles about the country online. You can find some of them here. We felt so well in Iran that it was difficult for us to resume the trip, and move on to Azerbaijan, our next country on our road trip map.\n\nApril 2018 (Armenia)\n\nAfter getting our visa from the Iranian Embassy in Georgia (yeahhhhh!), we drove through Armenia for a wek. Unfortunately, it was still too cold and there was also snow in the higher places, so we kind of rushed through Armenia.\n\nOur target was to reach Iran, our next big stop. We have received a 30-day visa but considering the size of Iran, we may have to ask for an extension! Inshallah we get one!\n\nAugust 2017 (Georgia)\n\nAfter a short break in Luxembourg, we were back on the road in August 2017. It took us around two weeks to reach Odessa (Ukraine) – because we travel slowly and because we took the opportunity to visit friends on the way. 🙂 In Odessa, we took a 3-day ferry that crossed the Black Sea and that brought us to Batumi, the new Pearl of the Black Sea (in Georgia).\n\nIn Georgia we spent two wonderful months discovering the country, its culture, gastronomy and people, which we simply loved. If you would like to see our highlights about Georgia click here. We fell in love with this country, so it didn’t take us long to decide that there would be a diariesof issue about this country.\n\nNovember 2016\n\nWe started our journey in Portugal in November 2016, after spending several weeks discovering the country from North to South.\n\nIf you would like to follow us on the Social Media, you can follow our trip on facebook or Instagram.\n\nWe also post our best videos on Youtube."
