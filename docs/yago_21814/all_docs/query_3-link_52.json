        "text": "Now in sole control of CBC, Harry Cohn renamed the company Columbia Pictures Corporation. What truly solidified Columbia Pictures as a respectable and high-end production company was the production and release of the Frank Capra film It Happened One Night in 1934. It swept the Academy Awards that year and was the first film in history awarded “the Big Five” (all five major Academy Awards). In addition to producing groundbreaking films such as \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", \"The Lady from Shanghai\" and \"Gidget\", it was the contracting of major stars such as Rita Haworth, Spencer Tracy and others that contributed to Columbia’s relatively new positive reputation. For Harry Cohn’s death in 1958, Columbia Pictures hosted a funeral across multiple stages on the lot. His funeral is still known to be the most attended funeral in Hollywood history. Despite the incredible success achieved at Columbia Pictures by Harry Cohn, his legacy was left unattended after his passing, and the company experienced a financial and production lull during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nColumbia Pictures left Gower Street and moved to the San Fernando Valley. Pick Vanoff Company purchased the remaining studios on Gower and renamed the property Sunset Gower Studios, thereby transforming the lot into an independent production facility. From there, Sunset Gower Studios became the home to many successful sitcom shows of the 1970s, 80s and 90s. In the 70s, popular shows such as \"The Flying Nun\", \"Bewitched\" and \"I Dream of Jeannie\" were filmed on the lot and paved the way for future productions. Fan favorite shows such as \"Saved by the Bell\", \"The Golden Girls\", \"The Newlywed Game\" and \"Who’s the Boss?\" were filmed at the studios in the 80s, with \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" and \"Full House\" following in the 90s.\n\nIn 2007, Sunset Gower was purchased by Victor Coleman and the team at Hudson Capital (later known as Hudson Pacific Properties). A year later, Hudson Pacific Properties completed construction of a state-of-the-art, six story building for Technicolor, marking the first new building on a Hollywood lot since the 1970s. Since that time, Sunset Gower has been home to groundbreaking entertainment such as \"Heroes\", \"Dexter\" and \"Newsroom\". Current award-winning productions include \"Scandal\" and \"How to Get Away with Murder\"."
