        "text": "Last Updated on December 15, 2023\n\nHere’s a strange little movie announcement – apparently, The Zellner Bros (Damsel and Kumiko: The Treasure Hunter) shot a top-secret movie called Sasquatch Sunset with two pretty big stars, Riley Keough and Jesse Eisenberg, and the film is already set for a release. Indeed, Bleeker Street just announced a 2024 theatrical release for the mystery project, which, the press release notes, centres around “a year in the life of a singular family.”\n\nNo other details were available, except that the movie stars Keough and Eisenberg, potentially sporting a lot of fur, but nothing is confirmed. In fact, it’s possible that it’s not even really a Sasquatch movie, although the Zellner Bros famously made two short films at Sundance called Sasquatch Birth Journal 1 & 2, which posed as “found footage” depicting a Sasquatch family.\n\nThe timing of this announcement is interesting as Sundance announces its official lineup tomorrow afternoon. Given the Zellner Bros’ history with the fest, this is a sure thing to be in the Premieres (or maybe Midnight) section. The Zellner Bros are an interesting duo, with both Kumiko The Treasure Hunter and Damsel being intriguing indie movies. While neither were crossover successes, they both developed cult followings, with Robert Pattinson’s performance in Damsel being particularly hailed.\n\nAs per the press release:\n\nFilmmaking brothers David and Nathan Zellner have made a name for themselves with their unique, boundary-pushing storytelling and cinematic style. Their collaborations are marked by dark humor and unconventional themes and characters. Their short film “Sasquatch Birth Journal 2” premiered at Sundance in 2011 and was nominated for the Sundance Short Filmmaking Award. They both can be found behind and in front of the camera, with David having recently acted in Riley Stearns’ The Art of Self-Defense for Bleecker Street in 2019 alongside Jesse Eisenberg, which the Zellners also executive produced. David was also nominated for Best Director at the Film Independent Spirit Awards in 2015 for Kumiko, The Treasure Hunter. Sasquatch Sunset will mark their eighth feature project together.\n\nAre you curious about Sasquatch Summer? Let us know in the comments."
