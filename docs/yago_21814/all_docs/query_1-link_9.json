        "text": "Billy Wilder was often critiqued, by twentieth century film critics, for being overly focused on his own brilliant screenplays. This focus was seen as betraying cinema as a primarily visual medium. Wilder was found wanting compared to virtuosic visual storytellers like Alfred Hitchcock, John Ford, Orson Welles or Douglas Sirk. Certainly this seems a strange pronouncement by anyone witnessing the remarkable opening scene of SUNSET BLVD. However, beyond the fact that the critical community is often prone to dramatic overstatement, I think another reason Wilder gets reduced to being a “literary” director is that the twentieth century America critical community tended to shy away from serious critical engagement with the art of film acting. This is perhaps a reaction to the majority of mainstream American audience members exclusively identifying performers as the primary creative force in filmmaking. Wilder even inserts the line in SUNSET BLVD. that most audience members believe actors are making up the lines as they go along rather than understanding films are written by screenwriters. Even today, in our era of technological sophistication, many friends and students of mine don’t really know what editors or cinematographers really do. Thus one can see the tendency of film scholars and critics to want to de-emphasize the importance of film acting as a reasonable corrective to the general public’s lack of acknowledgment of the various artistic forces that collaborate on the creation of a narrative film.\n\nWhatever the reason that so many film critics have tended to avoid serious engagement with the art of film acting, it has been a serious loss for the development of moving image culture. There have been a few notable exceptions to this rule such as James Naremore’s ACTING IN THE CINEMA and Charles Affron’s STAR ACTING: GISH, GARBO, DAVIS. Recently, a wide range of international critics and film scholars have begun to more methodically study the role of performance in moving image culture. SUNSET BLVD. is an essential film in need of more complex analysis in terms of performance. Wilder’s film intentionally plays off of the contrasting acting styles of its four leading performers. Much of the pleasure an audience derives from the film is watching the ways these styles alternately clash with and compliment each other. The strategy of casting performers with such divergent performance styles profoundly complicates and deepens what could have been simply an effective psychological thriller transforming it into something profoundly disturbing and subversive. I want to briefly summarize the basic performance styles used by the four main actors, but, will refrain from engaging in too specific of textual analysis in order to avoid spoilers for first time audience members.\n\nGloria Swanson- Norma Desmond.\n\nSwanson’s performance is the one, of the four leading characters, that has been most analyzed by film studies scholars and critics. It is rightfully considered an iconic performance. Most contemporary audience members will experience the performance very differently than audiences did at the time of the film’s release. Swanson had been a major star until the mid 1930’s and the 1950 audience would have been very familiar with her. She was only 51 years old when the film was released and she still looked very much like her younger superstar self. This is something that has often been lost in analysis of the film. Norma Desmond is still beautiful and physically agile. There really is no reason for her to be considered a “has been”. Yes, she is clearly mentally ill but part of the suggestion here is that her mental illness is, at least partially, the result of the way the industry has disposed of her. The ageist attitudes expressed by Joe Gilles (William Holden) are not reflected in what we see before us on screen. There is vivid shot of Norma’s face literally under a magnifying glass in one scene and the audience can see clearly how youthful Swanson looks. What is interesting is that many critics seem to have overly identified with the attitudes of Gilles; leading to commentary that calls the casting of Swanson an act of cruelty (and perhaps misogyny) by Wilder. In actuality, the casting of Swanson complicates the narrative in fascinating ways. She is creepy in mentality and presentation but still radiant in terms of physicality.\n\nAudience members back in 1950 would have, by and large, been familiar with Swanson’s performaces in a number of films including: Cecile B. Demile’s MALE AND FEMALE (1919), Alan Dwan’s ZAZA(1923), and Raoul Walsh’s SADIE THOMPSON (1928). Swanson was a sex symbol and an early fashion icon. Many members of the audience would remember that Swanson turned down a million dollar Paramount contract in 1927 (which would be $13.7 million in 2015 adjusting for inflation) in order to join United Artists (the production company of Charles Chaplin, Mary Pickford, D.W. Griffith and Douglas Fairbanks that was formed to challenge the control of filmmaking by business men at the major studios. Swanson wanted to control the content and form of the pictures she made. Audience members would also have known of her active love life, and especially of the scandal of her affair with Joseph Kennedy. Most would have remembered her sensational divorce from her second husband, in which, he accused her of having had affairs with thirteen men including Cecil B. Demille and Rudolph Valentino. They also might know that by 1950 she had become a staunch political conservative. Some might also have known of her famously having Erich Von Stroheim fired from QUEEN KELLY (which became one of the most famous unfinished films in Hollywood history).\n\nSwanson plays Norma with clear allusions to her own acclaimed performances from the silent era. At one point in the film we actually watch her watching a clip from the ill-fated QUEEN KELLY being projected by Max (played by Erich Von Stroheim the film’s actual writer-director). It is as if the particular performance style that catapulted Swanson to super stardom has invaded the psyche of Norma Desmond. Norma over-theatricalizes everything. I don’t just mean Norma’s penchant for melodrama and mind games, but also, her overly articulated mannerisms and seemingly choreographed movements. Her enunciation and vocal patterns seem a representation of what a silent film character would sound like if she could speak. Her gestures are always too grand, her words too precisely articulated, her facial expression always seeming to be welcoming the cameraman’s closeup. It is, as if, she has been possessed by cinema itself.\n\nThis is a big, weird, risky performance. In cinema history there are few performances as daring as this one and even fewer that leave the star performer this exposed. Perhaps the twin of this performance is Marlon Brando’s remarkable turn in Bertolucci’s LAST TANGO IN PARIS (1972). Predecessors to this kind of bravery might be a number of Katherine Hepburn’s performances in the 1930’s and 1940’s. One particular thinks of her performances in the films of her friend George Cukor (esp. Holiday, and The Philadelphia Story) and Gregory LaCava’s STAGE DOOR (1937) which uses quotes from a critically lambasted broadway production of The Lark that Hepburn had starred in. In these films Hepburn plays with the audiences perception of her star image to great artistic effect (if not always initially great box office success). Anytime a star is inserted into a narrative film the filmmakers are playing with that stars image. However, most films play it relatively safe with that image either embracing it or consciously setting out to reject that image. Sunset Blvd. does something much more dangerous and Swanson gives a performance of great courage and daring.\n\nWilliam Holden- Joe Gillis\n\nAudience members watching Sunset Blvd. in 2015 might very well have a totally different set of problems watching William Holden playing Joe Gillis. Holden was an actor whose once promising career was in serious decline by 1949. However, 1950 changed all that with three remarkable films SUNSET BLVD., Rudolph Mate’s UNION STATION and George Cukor’s BORN YESTERDAY. The modern viewer will filter Holden’s character through his post-1950 career because of his roles in classic films like SABRINA, EXECUTIVE SUITE, STALAG 13, PICNIC, THE COUNTRY GIRL BRIDGE OVER RIVER KWAI, THE WILD BUNCH, and NETWORK. A 1950 audience would see him more akin to the way Ben Affleck was viewed when he gave his spectacular performance in HOLLYWOODLAND in 2006 or the way Matthew McConaughey began to be seen post THE LINCOLN LAWYER, BERNIE and KILLER JOE in 2011.\n\nAlthough William Holden seems perfect for this role it was actually originally cast with Montgomery Clift who backed out of the film allegedly b/c of his affair with the older actress Libby Holman. Holman and Clift were both bisexual and polyamorous and there is speculation that Clift feared the film would provoke deeper inquiry into his personal life. One can only speculate about how Clift might have brought a queerness to the part that is entirely absent from Holden’s interpretation of the role. Holden is, in fact, one of the most hetero-normative handsome leading men to ever obtain major sex symbol status.\n\nOne of the amazing aspects of the film is the way Holden is eroticized by the camera in ways Swanson had been in most of her film performances. Part of the perversity of this film, and this would have been even more radical in 1950, is the way Gillis is portrayed as the sexual ideal consumed by Desmond. And the way Holden is asked to enter into an arrangement we typically watch younger women enter into in Hollywood film narratives. In many ways, his role is very similar to Linda Darnell’s in Joe Mankiewicz’s A LETTER TO THREE WIVES (1949). What becomes more interesting here is the way Holden’s possession becomes defacto a case of emasculation, whilst, for Darnell a marriage of convenience is seen as a reasonable strategy for upward mobility. However, it also creates a fascinatingly disturbing moral complexity. Regardless of the fact that Norma is wealthy and controlling there is still a queasy feeling throughout the film that Gillis is somehow manipulating the situation. Gillis’ economic plight does not neutralize his cis-gendered, heterosexual, masculine privilege. Much as male erotic dancers performing for audiences comprised of women function very differently from female erotic dancers performing for men, Gillis’ sexualization functions very differently than the traditional objectification of women in Hollywood films. Gillis still has levels of uncontestable control and domination.\n\nWilder returned to many of the themes of SUNSET BLVD. twenty eight years later with a film, also starring Holden, entitled FEDORA (1978). The demise of the Hays production code and the openings created by the sexual revolution allow Wilder far greater artistic freedoms. One of the fascinating things about this film is it shows a now mature and very weathered Holden playing Dutch, a down on his luck film producer, who becomes obsessed with a famous actress named Fedora. Dutch and Fedora had an affair during their early twenties but somehow Fedora has managed to not age. She now looks like Holden’s daughter rather than his contemporary. We get a total age and gender inversion of SUNSET BLVD. While it initially seems like Fedora is mentally ill we quickly come to suspect that she is in actuality the victim of some kind of conspiracy to keep her a prisoner in a European villa. Wilder casts the young heartthrob Stephen Collin’s to play the younger Dutch and then focuses a great deal on Holden’s aging body. This includes a startlingly long scene of Holden wearing very thin boxers that we can actually see his naked skin through. This scene obviously harkens back to Holden’s iconic semi-nude presence in films such as GOLDEN BOY, PICNIC and LOVE IS A MANY SPLENDORED THING. It also reminds us of the remarkable scene, in which, Swanson dries off Holden’s wet body after he exits her swimming pool in SUNSET BLVD.\n\nWilder’s use of Holden in SUNSET BLVD. is as a kind of cynical everyman. If Norma has lost her mind because of believing too much in the narrative of Hollywood as place where dreams are made, than, Joe understands it as simply an industry. His transition to becoming a high class sex worker is not really a transition at all. He left his artistic integrity in the gutter a long time ago and now dishes out whatever his studio producer “Johns” demand. Offering sexual services for pay pales in comparison to what has already been done to his vision of himself as an artist. Norma is under the delusion that she was a serious artist. Joe sees all too clearly that under the realities of industrial film production that are no serious artists.\n\nErich Von Stroheim- Max Von Mayerling\n\nWilder’s inspired casting of the great film director Erich Von Stroheim, as the mysterious butler Max, is a brilliant meta-textual act. Von Stroheim is the key to understanding the ethical position of the film. This is a narrative about humanities struggle to survive later capitalism. As central as Gloria Swanson and William Holden seem to this film I would argue that another actress and actor could have played their parts (obviously with different although potentially equally brilliant results). However, the film to me is unthinkable without the participation of Von Stroheim. At one point in the film Max reveals that there were three great directors that helped form US film culture D.W. Griffith, Cecil B. Demille and Max Von Mayerling. The audience is clearly supposed to understand at this moment that Von Mayerling is Von Stroheim. To make this even more clear at another moment Norma screens a film directed by Max for Joe. The film being screened is in reality QUEEN KELLY which starred Swanson and was directed by Von Stroheim. Many audience members in 1950 would remember this film as one of the most infamous “unfinished” films in Hollywood history. The film was “unfinished” because Swanson became enraged at Von Stroheim’s direction and called the film’s main financial producer, her lover, Joseph Kennedy and had Von Stroheim terminated. Von Stroheim’s legal contract dictated that unless he was granted approval of the final cut of the film it could not be screened. The contract was only legally binding in North America so Swanson directed her own more moderate ending and released the film in Europe. The scandal over this film was the final straw in Von Stroheim’s career. He would never receive major financial backing and would only officially direct one more film. Von Stroheim was able to go forward as a successful actor in French, British, American and German films. He also was able to write a number of amazing screenplays for American and French films.\n\nWilder’s use of Von Stroheim is one of the most remarkable inter-textual gestures in the entirety of narrative film. Von Mayerling/Von Stroheim function as a very harsh critique of the commercial film industry. The character’s name Von Mayerling invokes the tragic deaths of Mary Vetsera and her lover Prince Rudolph of Austira at the Imperial Hunting lodge on January 30, 1889. The lodge was located in the village of Mayerling and the affair and tragedy is generally referred to as “The Mayerling Incident”. The tragic love story has become a staple of Western cultural production including dozens of film versions, plays, historical novels, three operas, and a ballet. The incident is seen by many historians as a key event in the destabilization of the Austro-Hungarian empire that leads up to the first world war. At the time of the release of SUNSET BLVD most historians believed the deaths were a murder/suicide or a suicide pact made by the lovers. The actual incident remains a mystery to this day with forensic evidence suggesting a number of possible scenarios.\n\nI think Wilder is doing a number of tricky things with his naming of Von Stroheim’s character. First and foremost the name casts Max with an air of tragic mystery. His tragic love for Norma, while excessive and masochistic, is also touching. Max was a brilliant artist who discovered and nurtured the young Norma. He became her lover and husband. It is hinted that Norma, because of the general publics greater identification with performers than with directors, became much more financially successful than Max. Max feels responsible for creating Norma’s superstardom and has thus given up his own life to help craft the illusion that she still is a major Hollywood actress. This is a rich deconstruction of the way the film industry developed. The general public, and this is true even to this day, tend to overestimate the role of the actor in moving image production due to a lack of education about the construction of cinema. This lack of understanding has created a peculiar “superstar” driven industry where star actors have outsized salaries and inappropriate levels of power over the other creative forces involved in filmmaking. The commercial film industry turns actors into monstrous forces that dominate the public’s imaginations and can lead to personalities like Norma Desmond gaining great public influence. Norma Desmond, like the actress playing her, had the power to get her directors fired from their own films. Max, like the actor playing him, is a tragic figure but also, like the actor playing him, a figure of transcendence and forgiveness.\n\nErich Von Stroheim’s greatest film was undeniably GREED (1925). He premiered the film in a rough cut that lasted just over eight hours. This cut was only ever viewed by 12 invited audience members at an advanced screening on March 18, 1924. One of the invited guests, Harry Carr, of the Los Angeles Times wrote of this version “It is like Les Miserables. Episodes come along that you think have no bearing on the story, then 12 or 14 reels later it hits you with a crash. For stark, terrible realism and marvelous artistry, it is the greatest picture I have ever seen”. The film went through many radical re-edits because the film at eight hours was considered impossible to release to an American audience. Additionally, the studio found the tragic ending, the complicated morality and especially the bald faced critique of capitalist society distasteful. Von Stroheim worked tirelessly with editors to create a coherent shorter version but refused to compromise with the films depictions of poverty, greed and exploitation. Eventually this led to a profanity filled shouting match between Von Stroheim and studio head Louis B. Mayer which culminated in Mayer punching Von Stoheim in the face.\n\nThe initial screening of SUNSET BLVD was also a scandalous event. The majority of the invitation only audience were overwhelmed by the film. Barbara Stanwyck ran to Gloria Swanson as soon as the film was over kneeled and kissed the hem of her dress. Mary Pickford disappeared only to send a letter saying she was so overwhelmed by the majesty and truth of the film that she could not speak. Sensing the positive reception of the crowd Louis B. Mayer, still the head of MGM, became hysterically enraged and began shouting at the top of his lungs that the people responsible for this film had betrayed the very industry that supported them. Mayer, who was himself Jewish, went further saying that it was unfortunate that the world would be a much better place if Wilder, whose Mother, Stepfather, and Grandparents all died in concentration camps, had stayed with his family in Germany. This led Wilder and Stroheim to charge towards Mayer. Wilder is alleged to have said “Go fuck youself. You self-hating, ignorant, piece of shit”.\n\nI want to suggest that one aspect of Mayer’s hysterical rage was provoked by Wilder’s casting of Von Stroheim as Max. The narrative that studio moguls had created around Von Stroheim is a familiar one, it was later used against Joseph Von Sternberg and Orson Welles, Erich Von Stroheim was alleged to be his own worst enemy. Part of the reason Von Stroheim has remained a degraded figure in popular culture was the sheer audacity of what he attempted in his films. The person who creates an eight hour film is a person who believes there is a broad audience for eight hour films. Since film is a popular medium, embraced by the middle and working classes, it means that Von Stroheim believed an audience of rigorous intellectuals existed within those classes. Had Von Stroheim’s film been released in an unadulterated form and had it managed to recoup its production costs H.L. Mencken’s phrase “nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public” might never have become words most bourgeois professionals live by. Risking overstatement, I will go further and say, had Von Stroheim’s GREED been released in its unadulterated form and developed a following global history might have been changed so dramatically that Billy Wilder might never have become a political refugee working in Hollywood. What I mean by this is that a world that facilitated the distribution of a difficult film like GREED would be a world that had to facilitate the deepening of analytical skills among its global audience. These analytical skills would be precisely the kinds of skills needed to fend off fascist populism. Filmmakers like Von Stroheim (and Wilder) were exactly the kinds of artists that fascists labeled decadent. Von Stroheim’s films do not function like the films of D.W. Griffith or Cecil B. Demille. The audience watching Griffith’s BIRTH OF A NATION or DeMille’s A ROMANCE OF THE REDWOODS is not challenged in the way a audience watching Von Stroheim’s GREED, QUEEN KELLY, or THE MERRY WIDOW is. Griffith’s and DeMille’s films always align with the dominant ideology and sweep the audience along. What we get in their films is a clear indication of exactly what the filmmakers think. Von Stroheim’s films remain disturbing to this very day because his work does not think for its audience as much as engage the audience in the process of thinking and rethinking. For example, his silent reworking of the operetta THE MERRY WIDOW reads more as a deconstruction of the popular stage work rather than an illustration of its themes.\n\nNancy Olson- Betty Schaefer\n\nNancy Olson’s performance is probably the only performance in the film that can be received by audience members in 2015 similarly to the way it was perceived by audience members in 1950. This is because Olson carried no “baggage” in 1950 and although consistently working in major film and television productions right up to the present day carries no real “baggage” today. Olson was a studio contract player at Paramount Studios who had only appeared in two films prior to Sunset Blvd. Wilder was adamant that the role of Betty had to be cast with a fresh face. He also needed a remarkably gifted actress to ensure that Betty would register as a three dimensional character that the audience cared about. Betty is not simply “the girl” that Joe falls for. She is in actuality the only character that Wilder allows us to fully identify with. She is the true ethical heart of the film.\n\nBetty Schaefer represents everything that the other three major characters are not. She is the only character that has the ability to balance the knowledge of the limitations of the US film industry with a striving to transcend these limitations. Betty actually seems like a woman who has thought deeply about her role within the social structure. This becomes a rather remarkable feminist gesture within the discourse of the film. Betty is not naïve, she understands that Hollywood produces a great deal of work that is both politically problematic and aesthetically limited. However, she also doesn’t “awfulize” the situation. Betty understands that Hollywood film studios are not purely corrupt institutions that only produce banal and/or ideologically dangerous products for a less than discerning population. She recognizes that there are amazingly deep cracks within the system that allow aesthetic brilliance and subversive ideological messages to be produced and distributed. The attraction Joe and Betty have for each other is primarily sapiosexual in nature. These two dig each others minds and that they happen to have nice faces and bodies is simply icing on the cake. Betty inspires Joe to remember his actual passions as a writer. Joe’s caustic wit and cynical outlook challenges Betty to fully articulate her narrative strategies. Unfortunately, even in 2015 framing heterosexual attraction primarily via creative, intellectual engagement is shockingly rare. Norma is primarily attracted to Joe’s masculine surface, but, Betty is attracted to the profound depths of his soul.\n\nOlson was not, and never did, become a star. She is simply a very good actress. Her career is actually quite amazing. She worked with many of Hollywood’s greatest directors including; Raoul Walsh, Rudolph Mate, John Farrow, Michael Curtiz, Robert Stevenson, Buzz Kulik, William Dieterie, and on many of the most influential and popular television programs such as Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Lux Theater Showcase, Gunsmoke, The Streets of San Francisco, The Big Valley, and most recently HBO’s Big Love. Olson has managed throughout her career to be neither a star nor a character actor. She most often has played leading roles, usually in films co-starring superstar performers like John Wayne, Randolph Scott, Bing Crosby, Glenn Ford, Fred MacMurray, Jane Wyman, Van Heflin, Fred Astaire, Shelley Winters, Melvyn Douglas, Helen Hayes, Claudette Colbert and Fredric March. From 1960 through the mid 1970’s she became a regular actress used in leading roles by the Disney studio appearing in classic family films such as; The Shaggy DA, The Absent Minded Professor, and Polyanna.\n\nExamining Olson’s career, in comparison to her three co-stars, it becomes clear that her lack of star status has afforded her a greater ability to slip into the overall environment of the roles she plays on film and television. Olson is also a noted stage actress who has often appeared on Broadway. Theater functions very differently from film in many ways equalizing relationships between stars and non-star performers. Those performers, who do function as stars of the stage, often are acknowledged as such upon their first stage entrance and than allowed to slip into their roles. Olson, is the type of performer that brings a stage actors dedication to craft to her screen roles. A telling example of this would be to witness her performance in Rudolph Mate’s UNION STATION, also opposite William Holden, and released the same year as SUNSET BLVD. Olson’s performance in that film is of the same high quality as her work in Wilder’s film even though the screenplay by Sydney Boehm is of less quality. Olson’s role in that film, Joyce Willcombe, is actually rather incoherent and underwritten but she applies herself in ways that make Joyce seem credible. Holden, on the otherhand, gives a less convincing performance as Lt. William Calhoun. The inadequacies of his role’s conception are noticeable because they clash with Holden’s laid back star persona. Looking throughout Olson’s career we see this same commitment to her characters whether she is playing the Mother trapped with her seriously ill daughter (Linda Blair) on a runaway plane in the blockbuster entertainment AIRPORT 75 or essaying a role in a film by Raoul Walsh.\n\nTo really examine Olson’s craft I recommend checking out an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, “Total Loss”, that she made in 1955. Olson plays the role of Jan Manning, a struggling widowed business woman who is approached by a lecherous sales representative (a very creepy Ralph Meeker) who proposes staging a fire to collect the insurance money on Jan’s store. Olson has to communicate a complex set of emotions within less than 25 minutes of screen time. She has to make it seem credible that an ethical woman, like Jan, is being so pushed to her limit by economic realities that she would consider conspiring with an arsonist. She also has to figure out a way to make Jan’s behavior credible vis-à-vis Ralph Meeker’s very creepy performance. One misstep from Olson and Meeker would come off as entirely over-the-top. Again Olson performs the difficult task of fine acting with a star (this time a character actor star but none the less still a star). To make matters more challenging for Olson, the director Don Taylor, has cast the supporting roles with razor sharp character actors (Jan’s assistant is played by Ruth Storey, an insurance representative by Dave Willock, her sister by Barbara Lord and a friendly Fire Chief by the great Ray Teal). Taylor allows all of these actors to have a field day fleshing out their character’s eccentricities because he knows Olson will be able to keep up with them.\n\nPerformers like Nancy Olson often go underappreciated by film scholars, critics and the general public. Their work is not self-promoting. In fact, the great gift of performers like Olson is rooted in a consistent display of generosity towards fellow actors. I would argue that someone like Olson personifies a form of radical humanism akin to the work of directors like Robert Bresson, Jean Renoir and Yasujiro Ozu. Critical scrutiny of film and television acting could be of great service to increasing appreciation for these kinds of performers. This could, arguably, have profound social consequences especially for people engaged in transformative social justice based movements. In someways, a performer like Olson, gives us a model for a more collaborative form of leadership that is generally espoused by progressive social change makers. Appreciating the ways film performers support each other is as important as analyzing the more virtuosic tendencies exhibited by some film performers (ie. Greta Garbo, Judy Garland, Marlon Brando, Meryl Streep).\n\nBilly Wilder brilliantly cast and directed these four performers in ways that consistently challenge the audience. By encouraging Gloria Swanson to integrate flourishes of silent film pantomime into her performance, whilst directing Holden to maintain a cynical distance, and Von Stroheim to enact his role with a kind of clinical precision Wilder ensures that the scenes set in the Desmond mansion have a kind of unbalanced tension. This contrasts sharply with the scenes between Olson and Holden which are played with a kind of realism more associated with conventional romantic drama. SUNSET BLVD. is an exceptionally successful example of using contrasting performance styles to create a powerful and complicated film."
