        "text": "Motion pictures from the silent era to the 21st Century have shot on location in Sleepy Hollow and Tarrytown. See if you can spot landmarks from your favorite flick. Before you ask, Tim Burton’s 1999 film Sleepy Hollow was shot in England. Sorry . . . no Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, and no covered bridge.\n\nRichard the Brazen (1917), Harry T. Morey, Alice Joyce. Exterior scenes of this silent film were filmed at Edgemont, a 22-room mansion on Benedict and Prospect Avenues once owned by the Detmer family (destroyed by fire in 1971).\n\nThe Headless Horseman (1922), a silent version directed by Edward Venturini and starring Will Rogers as Ichabod Crane. Portions are said to have been filmed in what is now Sleepy Hollow. The Old Dutch Church is clearly recognizable.\n\nBUtterfield 8, in which Elizabeth Taylor drives across the original Tappan Zee Bridge. Sorry, Liz, the new bridge which opened in 2017 looks nothing like the old.\n\nThe Brain That Wouldn’t Die (1962), Jason Evers and Virginia Leith. Filmed in 1959 but not released until 1962. Exterior scenes filmed at Edgemont, a 22-room mansion on Benedict and Prospect Avenues once owned by the Detmer family (destroyed by fire in 1971).\n\nHouse of Dark Shadows (1970), directed by Dan Curtis and starring Jonathan Frid and Grayson Hall. In 1970 the creator of the Dark Shadows television series, brought his Gothic soap to the big screen. The feature length film House of Dark Shadows was shot largely at the Lyndhurst estate in Tarrytown, with additional footage in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery where cemetery’s receiving vault made its Hollywood debut as the haunt of the vampire Barnabas Collins. The Headless Horseman isn’t the only specter to haunt the hollow!\n\nNight of Dark Shadows (1971), directed by Dan Curtis, starring David Selby and Grayson Hall. Scenes filmed at Lyndhurst in Tarrytown.\n\nChild’s Play (1972), James Mason, Beau Bridges. Scenes filmed at Marymount College in Tarrytown, now a campus of EF Education First."
