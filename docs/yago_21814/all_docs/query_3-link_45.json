        "text": "Friends of River Oaks Theatre brings you the Houston premiere of Hundreds of Beavers—the cult comedy hit of the 2023 film festival circuit—for one night only, with two showtimes! In this 19th-century supernatural winter epic, a drunken applejack salesman must go from zero to hero and become the greatest fur trapper by defeating hundreds of beavers. This madcap, delirious beaver action must be seen to be believed.\n\n“Astoundingly inventive and ambitious micro-budget film that I'm so glad I got to see on the big screen ahead of its streaming release. One of the funniest films I've ever seen. The gags just don't stop, nor does the escalation of the carnage against the varying woodland creatures (and our intrepid trapper).” - Freyr\n\n“HUNDREDS OF BEAVERS isn't merely a 'homage' to silent cinema and Looney Tunes-style comedy, but an actual example of it, with a new gag every few seconds that left me howling with tears of laughter.” - Justin Decloux\n\nTHURSDAY, AUGUST 15\n\nSHOWTIMES:\n\n7:00 PM\n\n9:15 PM\n\nRUNTIME:\n\n1 hour 53 minutes\n\nLimited Amount of FREE TICKETS for Cinephile Members & Discounted General Admission Available!\n\nOn August 10, the film is introduced by Alan Cerny, Houston Film Critics Society.\n\nOne of the most thrilling movie epics of all time, Seven Samurai tells the story of a 16th-century village whose desperate inhabitants hire the eponymous warriors to protect them from invading bandits. This three-and-a-half-hour ride from Akira Kurosawa—featuring legendary actors Toshirô Mifune and Takashi Shimura—seamlessly weaves philosophy and entertainment, delicate human emotions, and relentless action into a rich, evocative, and unforgettable tale of courage and hope.\n\nThe screening includes a 15-minute intermission. 70th Anniversary 4K Restoration by Toho Co., Ltd.\n\nAbout the Speaker\n\nAlan Cerny is a member of the Houston Film Critics Society and has reviewed films for sites such as Ain’t It Cool News, Birth Movies Death, and Coming Soon. He is an accredited Rotten Tomatoes reviewer and a co-host of Matinee Heroes, a podcast with Craig Price. Cerny has hosted events at the MFAH and Alamo Drafthouse, and his upcoming plans include the video review project “The Crying Dad Reviews.” He has loved movies since his dad took him to see Jaws in 1975 and scarred him for life (in a good way).\n\nSeven Samurai (Shichinin no samurai)\n\nA samurai answers a village's request for protection after he falls on hard times. The town needs protection from bandits, so the samurai gathers six others to help him teach the people how to defend themselves, and the villagers provide the soldiers with food.\n\nFriends of River Oaks Theatre is a community nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization whose mission is to joyously help preserve and support the River Oaks Theatre as a historic ArtHouse for the enrichment of all for generations to come. We connect people through the universal language of art and storytelling. We keep the art in the ArtHouse and beyond by programming award-worthy, independent, and international filmmaker/artist work, doing calls for original work, PR, outreach, support, and education. Your volunteer activity helps make all of this possible."
