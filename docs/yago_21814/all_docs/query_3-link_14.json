        "text": "This article first appeared in The New York Times on August 11, 2000\n\nThis article reprint was made possible by Visa.\n\n'Sunset Strip': Youth Is Wasted on the Deluded\n\nBy DAVE KEHR\n\nFILM REVIEW\n\nere's something different: a youth comedy so relentlessly sordid and depressing that it's likely to send its audience straight into the arms of the nearest psycho-pharmacologist.\n\nIn fact, \"Sunset Strip\" is so different that it has been gathering dust on a shelf at 20th Century Fox for almost a year, and is now being released only to a single theater in New York, the Village East.\n\nSometimes, of course, orphan movies turn out to be imaginative and innovative films that are just too difficult for the studio to sell.\n\nThis is not one of those times.\n\nDirected by the debutant Adam Collis and written by Randall Jahnson (\"The Doors\") and Russell DeGrazier, \"Sunset Strip\" seems so fundamentally misconceived that it's hard to imagine how it ever survived the first pitch meeting.\n\nSet in a low-budget version of 1972 (which means lots of orange and brown interiors and nary a single sweeping image of the Los Angeles boulevard that gives the film its name), \"Sunset Strip\" follows seven main characters through a single late summer day.\n\nTammy (the British newcomer Anna Friel) is a clothing designer with a shop conveniently situated catty-corner from the famous L.A. rock club Whisky-a-Go-Go, which allows her to have near-simultaneous sex with an up-and-coming country rocker (Jared Leto) and a visiting Scottish superstar (Tommy J. Flanagan).\n\nZack (Nick Stahl) is a fuzzy-faced novice guitarist who believes that Jimi Hendrix came down in a dream to designate him as his successor.\n\nHe spends his day getting ready for his professional debut at the Whisky, where he'll open for Mr. Flanagan's character, and falling fruitlessly in love with an attractive older woman who lives in a mansion down the canyon.\n\nFelix (Rory Cochrane) is a booze-addled songwriter whose fondest dream is about killing himself with a mix of vodka and pills. Shapiro (Adam Goldberg) is a hustling talent agent from the Valley with a white-boy Afro that suggests a Chia pet on steroids. And Michael (Simon Baker) is the shy, color-blind photographer whose discovery that he has caught a venereal disease from a cocktail waitress kicks off the \"La Ronde\"-like plot.\n\nThe infection spreads through most of the cast -- and eventually, it appears, through most of Southern California.\n\nMr. Jahnson and Mr. DeGrazier have written the film as a series of nasty confrontations, perfunctory sex and shattering dreams, all directed by Mr. Collis with the same claustrophobic staging, shrill line readings and slack pacing.\n\nOnly a knowledge of movie conventions -- she is, after all, the lead -- allows us to determine that Ms. Friel is meant to embody a grand romantic ideal; her character's actual conduct is by turns ditzy, opportunistic and cheap.\n\nMuch like 1998's \"54,\" set at New York's chic nightclub of the 70's, Studio 54, \"Sunset Strip\" projects an oddly sour nostalgia, suggesting that the good old days were actually pretty awful.\n\nMaybe this is the message that teenage filmgoers, fed up with mom and dad's tales of their glorious youth, most deeply want to hear. \"Sunset Strip\" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes strong language, casual sex and prodigious substance abuse.\n\nSUNSET STRIP\n\nDirected by Adam Collis; written by Randall Jahnson and Russell DeGrazier, based on a story by Mr. Jahnson; director of photography, Ron Fortunato; edited by Bruce Cannon; music by Stewart Copeland; production designer, Cynthia Charette; produced by Art Linson and John Linson; released by Fox 2000 Pictures. At the Village East, Second Avenue at 12th Street, East Village. Running time: 105 minutes. This film is rated R.\n\nWITH: Simon Baker (Michael), Anna Friel (Tammy), Nick Stahl (Zach), Rory Cochrane (Felix), Adam Goldberg (Shapiro), Tommy J. Flanagan (Duncan), Darren Burrows (Bobby), John Randolph (Mr. Niederhaus), Stephanie Romanov (Christine) and Jared Leto (Glen)."
