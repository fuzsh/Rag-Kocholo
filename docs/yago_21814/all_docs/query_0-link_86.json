Places to Visit in Cambodia\n\n1. Places to Visit in Siem Reap\n\nUndoubtedly, Siem Reap stands in the first position of the must-visited list in Cambodia. It serves as the linking bridge to the ancient ruins and temples of Angkor Complex. Being defined as one of the most important archaeological sites in South-East Asia by UNESCO, Angkor Archaeological Park spreads over 400km2, with remains of the different capitals of the Khmer Empire from the 9th to the 15th century. The most highlighted temples can be listed as Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, Ta Prohm.\n\nTo meet the continuously increasing demand to visit magnificent Angkor, Siem Reap has transformed itself into a major tourist hub. It’s a vibrant town with many activities and attractions including lively Psar Chas Market, buzzing cafes, bars, traditional craft shops and plentiful nightlife. Siem Reap is also a good point to access the nearby floating villages, bird sanctuaries on the Tonle Sap Lake – the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn Siem Reap, there is a wide range of accommodation to choose, ranging from luxury or 5 star standard hotels, resorts to hundreds of guesthouses to meet every budget.\n\nThere are lots of other things to do in Siem Reap that we recommend doing while you are here.\n\n2. Places to Visit in Phnom Penh\n\nPhnom Penh is the vibrant bustling capital of the Kingdom of Cambodia. Despite recent rapid changes, the city exudes a sort of provincial charm and tranquility with French colonial mansions and tree-lined boulevards amidst monumental Angkorian architecture. The city is conveniently located at the conjunction of three grand rivers – the Tonle Sap, the Mekong and the Bassac river. Therefore, tourists are highly recommended to take the scenic cruise to witness the golden colors of Phnom Penh’s skyline at sunset. Or just simply take the leisure stroll to Phnom Penh’s historic riverfront area where stands lots of restaurants, art galleries and silk shops.\n\nCity tour in Phnom Penh can’t be completed without Royal Palace and adjacent Silver Pagoda, which provide gorgeous examples of traditional artistry and offer intriguing insight into both Cambodia’s ancient and modern history. While Tuol Sleng Museumand Choeung Ek Killing Field are the evidence for the horror and brutality the people of this country suffered under Khmer Rouge rule.\n\nShopaholics can’t miss the visit to the distinctive Central Market where you can buy jewelry, curios, clothes and souvenirs.\n\n3. Places to Visit in Battambang\n\nEven being Cambodia’s second biggest city, Battambang itself is a laidback place compared to the bustling of the capital. If Phnom Penh’s hectic buzz is a bit too much to handle, tourists can take 6-hour drive from Phnom Penh to Battambang to find quieter atmosphere.\n\nBattambang was established as a trading center in the 18th century. Later it became part of French Indochina, with some colonial buildings still in existence until now and scattered through the city’s boulevards. History lovers can take day trip to visit several Angkor-style temples and Buddhist shrines, like the temples of Phnom Sampeau, Phnom Banan, and Wat Ek Phnom. Among them, Phnom Sampeau (also known as Bat Cave) is the top site because tourists are eager to come there to witness thousands of bats making their way out of caves in the hillside to feed before returning at dawn.\n\nTaking a slow 30-minute ride on the Bamboo Train is another popular activity which only can be experienced in Battambang. It is a single-line rail track where “carriages” made from a platform of wood and bamboo travel between Battambang’s east bank and the nearby tiny village. Famed among some of the most tranquil rural scenery in Cambodia, Battambang is an ideal place to take biking trip along rice fields, visit Cambodian families and taste rice paper, dried bananas, and bamboo sticky rice which are made in traditional methods.\n\nYour night in this town will not be boring if you pay the visit to ‘Phare Ponleu Selpak Circus’, where all traditional Cambodian dances and circus music are performed live by students and young locals from nearby poor community.\n\nHere is our detailed guides for things to do in Battambang.\n\n4. Places to Visit in Sihanouk Ville\n\nBeing known as the most popular beach destination of Cambodia on the Gulf of Thailand, Sihanouk Ville was named after a former king – Norodom Sihanouk. In Sihanouk Ville, Ochheuteal Beach and the Serendipity Beach have emerged as one of Southeast Asia’s backpacker areas with party reputation. For a much quieter scene, just take 6 km to the south around Otres Beach, with huts or bungalows on the beach, a sprinkling of classy boutique hotels, and a number of up-and-coming restaurants.\n\nSihanouk Ville is also the main entry point to offshore islands of Koh Rong, Koh Rong Samloem, where are ideal places for snorkeling and thoroughly relaxing beach vacation. Blessed with pristine, wild and beautiful islands, these islands are where tourists go to enjoy the nature and stay away from the world.\n\nIf water activities are not in your list, just take a ride to pretty and pristine Ream National Park, which is an easy day trip from Sihanouk Ville and home to more than 200 different bird species, including a few threatened species.\n\n5. Places to Visit in Kampot\n\nLocated about 3 hour drive from Phnom Penh, Kampot is often chosen as a break spot on the way to access Sihanouk Ville from Cambodia’s capital. Kampot is famous for its black peppercorns around the world because of their unique flavor. A visit at pepper plantation will help you to observe the work of local community living there, as well as taste local dishes using this special ingredient.\n\nBesides being the land of black peppercorns, Kampot is a laid-back riverine town that has a number of colonial structures, some of which has been painstakingly restored. Many travelers stay here longer than they expected, having succumbed to its easygoing pace and chilled-out atmosphere. For the more active tourists, they will not feel boring because Kampot is also an excellent base for discovering the surrounding sights of the south. In this idyllic location, visitors can go boating and rafting on the river, as well as take in glistening waterfalls along the route.\n\nDay trip can be taken from the town to Bokor National Park, which is famous for the old French summer getaway of Bokor Hill Station, with its abandoned church and eerie, empty shell of a once-grand hotel. Bokor National Park is a lush primary forest with pleasant climate.\n\n6. Places to Visit in Kep\n\nLying 25km southeast of Kampot, Kep is a favourite among Cambodians for weekend getaways and foreign travelers who want to get away from the tourist crowds at Sihanouk Ville. They are attracted by its convenient location (3h30m drive from Phnom Penh), quiet beaches and friendly people. Founded as a colonial retreat for the French elite in 1908, the town is still full of ruined shells of old villas, destroyed in the Khmer Rouge days.\n\nTourists can take a lazy stroll along the shiny white shores of the Kep Beach, and enjoy some delicious, inexpensive seafood, freshly plucked from the ocean at the well-known Crab Market. Day trips to nearby Rabbit Island can be arranged for snorkelers to enjoy viewing lots of colorful fishes on the bottom of the shallow sea.\n\nA visit to the Kep National Park is also recommended for nature lovers. The park is filled with waterfalls, elusive monkeys, the Stone House and Little Buddha.\n\n7. Places to Visit in Kratie\n\nKratie is a small town spreading along the banks of the mighty Mekong River. The town itself is dominated by a central marketplace surrounded by old, French colonial buildings. Even there’s no large scale tourism in this town, plenty of backpackers pour through here during the peak season. The main reason tourists come to Kratie because it’s an excellent base for dolphin-watching tours. Kampie, over 20km north of Kratie, provides the best riverside vantage point to view a pod of rare freshwater Irrawaddy dolphins.\n\nThese dolphins are endemic to the Mekong River in ever-diminishing numbers. It is thought that there are between 66 and 86 dolphins left in the upper Cambodian Mekong area. Therefore, local authority puts environmental measures in place to try and help their dwindling numbers.\n\nIf you are willing to spend more time in this tranquil town, check out our guide on other things to do in Kratie.\n\n8. Places to Visit in Mondulkiri\n\nMondulkiri, 7 hour drive north east of Phnom Penh, is the largest but most sparsely populated in Cambodia. It is also home to the majority of country’s tribal minorities, including the Cham and Phnong people, who have maintained their way of living for centuries in the region’s forests and hills. One of the largest and easiest to access is the Phlung village inhabited by Phnong people, where their curious huts have woven, wooden walls and thatched roofs that slope almost to the floor.\n\nMondulkiri is also an interesting place to visit in Cambodia for adventures due to its wildlife and natural beauty, with thickly forested mountains, powerful waterfalls and the lush green rolling hills of the western side. Don’t miss the chance to visit the impressive, two-tiered Bou Sraa Waterfall, the highest in Cambodia.\n\nBeing known for a number of projects and sanctuaries in the region for rescuing and protecting elephants, Mondulkiri offers excellent chances for tourists to interact with elephant in an ethical way. The most popular project is included in our itinerary is The Elephant Valley Project, where helps elephants and their mahouts, as well as educate visitors about the importance of protecting these wonderful creatures.\n\nV. Where and What to Eat in Cambodia\n\nKhmer cuisine is profoundly influenced by water, rice and freshwater fish due to Cambodian geographical location and climate.

Best Time to Travel to Cambodia\n\n1. Overview of climate in Cambodia\n\nCambodia has the simpler weather system in Southeast Asia with two distinct seasons: dry and wet season.\n\nThe dry season in Cambodia runs from October to April/ early May, when hot wind caused by the dry north-east monsoon blowing across the whole country. With the average temperature at around 24°C-26°C, November to January are the coolest months of the year. Characterized by dry and sunny weather, low humidity and relatively cool temperatures, it is no surprise that dry season is when the number of tourists coming to Cambodia reaches its peak.\n\nFrom May to early October is the wet season in Cambodia. During these months, southwest monsoon brings almost 75% of annual rainfall to Cambodia. During this rainy season, daytime temperature still remains high between 25°C and 27°C. May, June and July are the hottest months and rainfalls comes infrequently in the form of short downpours. Toward the latter months of the wet season (late July – September), rains tend to be more intense and can be heaviest along the south coast.\n\n2. When is the best time to visit Cambodia?\n\nThe high season for travel in Cambodia is from November until April, with dry and favorable weather conditions throughout almost main tourism destinations. Consequently, that is also when the cost of travelling tends to increase. The travel expenses are particularly acute during special occasions, like Christmas and New Year Eve, Khmer New Year Celebration in mid-April. If traveling during this period, tourists are suggested to reserve travel services as early as possible to avoid fully booked situations.\n\nDuring November – April, Cambodia has comfortable conditions with brilliant sunshine and extremely low chance of raining. Beach and island lovers can enjoy relaxing sunny days in pristine white sand coastlines and islands, such as Sihanouk Ville – Koh Rong – Koh Rong Samloem. In north east regions of Cambodia, journey time to Mondulkiri and Ratanakiri is shorter thanks to good road conditions in dry season. Sunny daytimes and cooler temperatures make adventure activities like trekking into jungles or interact with wildlife in these places are much more pleasant.\n\nAlthough November to January are quite cool, April is one of the hottest months in Cambodia with average temperatures of 35°C. Rather than all day visits to Angkor Temples, tourists are recommended to take early morning or late afternoon tours, and have short break by the hotel swimming pool or at air-condition restaurants or tourist venues at midday. On the other hand, the summer heat somehow helps to lower the crowd numbers at the main temples in specific time of the day.\n\nYou may also like:\n\nBest time to visit Vietnam & Cambodia\n\nComing to Cambodia between May and early October, tourists can experience a quieter holiday. Actually, wet season is not as bad as the label implies because it depends on what you want to do in these countries. And sometimes, tourist numbers may be taken into consideration rather than the weather factor. Visitors can still come to Cambodia during monsoon season when the dust is gone and the countryside returns to its lush greenery thanks to downpours. The iconic tourism site – Angkor Temples, gets a severe decrease in visitor numbers. In some extends, these spectacular temples are more stunning in wet season with fully watered moats surrounding, which provides perfect chances to snap shots of temple reflections in the water.\n\nRainy season is also the perfect time of the year to visit floating villages in Tonle Sap Lake by boat. During wet season, the lake swells to six or seven times its normal size of approximately 2,600 square kilometres.\n\nOn the downside, heavy rainfalls make travelling to north east regions (Kratie, Mondulkiri, Ratanakiri) and southern coastal destinations (Sihanouk Ville, Kampot, Kep) fairly difficult. “Off the beaten path” travel should be avoided, particularly in August. Remote tracks can become unpassable due to flooding of road system there. For those who are planning some relaxing days on the beach should forget Cambodia’s south coast during these months."
