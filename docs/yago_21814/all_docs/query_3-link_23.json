        "text": "Sunset Over Selungo is a 30-minute journey into the jungle, following Dennis, Unyang, Sia and Balan of the Penan tribe. It was filmed in Sarawak, Malaysia, in 2013.\n\nIt supports a campaign to help the Penan tribe protect their rainforest home.\n\nThe full documentary is available to watch for free by clicking on the player, or on Vimeo and YouTube.\n\nScroll down for the background to the project, plus see excerpts and a video of the community reaction.\n\nThe background\n\nBorneo is the third largest island in the world. It holds some of the oldest and most precious ecosystems on the planet and is home to an amazing diversity of indigenous cultures. It is split into three countries: Indonesia, Brunei and Malaysia. Malaysian Borneo is split into the states of Sabah and Sarawak.\n\nWhat is the Baram Peace Park?\n\nIn 2009, 18 Penan villages united to create a proposal for a new protected area. The aim: to guard their lands against loggers and preserve their culture for generations to come.\n\nAlthough the Penan communities have always lived here, they do not have official title deeds to their land because the government has not provided them. There is a risk logging companies will try and bribe the villages to sign away their land rights forever, and loggers still continue to encroach further into the territory.\n\nUntil the Baram Peace Park is officially recognised and adequately protected in law, then the risk of complete deforestation remains.\n\nThe area around Selungo is one of the last untouched pockets of jungle left. The Penan villages in Upper Baram, as well as other local indigenous groups, are calling out for support as they struggle to defend their land.\n\nSee the painstaking process of carving a blowpipe, the unique hunting tool used by the Penan. The weapons are still used by some members of the tribe for hunting with poison darts, but Balan Kade was the last person in his village who knew how to make them.\n\nBalan died in 2020 and I was very sad not to get another chance to meet him. His patience, his skill and most of all the magic in his character shines through in the film. The fact that millions of people have watched his videos shows what a special man he was, and I’m sure if you haven’t seen them yet, he’ll make you smile too.\n\nThe short film was awarded a Vimeo Staff Pick, featured on National Geographic’s YouTube, The Atlantic, and various other online channels."
