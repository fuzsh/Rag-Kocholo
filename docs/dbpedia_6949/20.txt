The Saalbach is a 51-kilometre-long (32 mi) (including its source river WeiÃach) right tributary of the Rhine running through the German state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. The river source is in the Kraichgau region near the city of Bretten, formed by the confluence of the rivers WeiÃach and Salzach. It then flows through Gondelsheim to the northwest, then through Bruchsal and Dettenheim. It then turns north through Philippsburg before emptying into the Rhine.
