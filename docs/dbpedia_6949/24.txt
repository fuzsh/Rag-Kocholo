The Eckbach estuary into the Rhine is 350 meters from the Rhine Cycle Path. You leave the Rhine Cycle Path at the Eckbach Bridge and follow the path towards the Rhine. There you can linger on the pebble beach.

Our Eckbach. We almost live on the other end. It is a shame that there is no cycle path along the entire Eckbach. That would be an interesting route with a lot of variety and history (mills).

The Eckbach (in the Middle Ages Leinbach, also known as the Eck in the region, on the Unterlauf Neugraben and Leininger Graben) is a 39 km long brook and a left or western tributary of the Rhine in Rhineland-Palatinate. There it flows mainly in the northeastern Palatinate, only the last 2 km of the brook and its mouth are in the extreme southeast of Rheinhessen. The Eckbach-MÃ¼hlenwanderweg accompanies him on the first 23 km of his run. Source: WikiBy the way, you are right here at the "Wormser Sandbank". The bank consists mainly of gravel, the actual "sandbank" can only be seen in hot, dry summers.
