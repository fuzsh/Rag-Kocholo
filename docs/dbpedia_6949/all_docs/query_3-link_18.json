The aim was to make the watercourse passable again for fish and other aquatic organisms and thus to implement the EU's Water Framework Directive. Most of the 30 or so weirs and barrages, most of which can be found in this 12-kilometer stretch of stream, have been dismantled. Meanders are restored where possible; Where the straightening could not be reversed, concrete cubes with an edge length of around 50 cm placed in the streambed promote the deposition of debris so that the flow speed of the water decreases.\n\nIn heavy rain, the Eisbach quickly became too narrow. The creek crossed its banks. Flooding was the result. In order to avoid flooding in the future, a section of the Eisbach near Obrigheim was renatured in 2013. More than 26,000 cubic meters of soil were moved to make room for the stream and prevent flooding.
