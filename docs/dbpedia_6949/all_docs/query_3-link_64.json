        "text": "Increasing rates of hybridization and introgression in managed populations of freshwater fish are a major threat to the long-term viability of native species. The conservation challenge begins with identifying native gene pools. For brown trout (Salmo trutta Linnaeus, 1758) in the Upper Danube drainage, this task is complicated by the presence of both naturally and anthropogenically induced admixture of highly divergent lineages (Atlantic and Danubian). Herein, a ddRADseq protocol was used to type 377 individuals from 24 populations in the Upper Danube in Austria and Germany, and from reference populations from adjacent drainages and commercial hatcheries. High genetic differentiation at small geographic scales was found among pure Danubian-lineage populations, especially in the Kalkalpen National Park (Austria). In the Upper Danube drainage of Germany, as well as in the Rhine and Elbe drainages, brown trout populations were predominantly of Atlantic-lineage origin – as were those of all commercial hatcheries. Most populations, however, showed various degrees of admixture between Danubian and Atlantic lineages, hypothesized to be the result of both natural and anthropogenic processes. We highlight the conservation value of pure Danubian-lineage populations, and the challenges promoting conservation of naturally admixed populations, while discouraging continued stocking and admixture via management activities.\n\nThe history of brown trout Salmo trutta L. stocking has long tradition in the European Union and other countries. Hundreds of hatchery facilities on continent have artificial broodstocks used for enhancement of neighbouring and also geographically far river basins. These practices have substantial effect on wild brown trout populations. To illuminate this phenomenon, eleven hatchery stocks and wild populations from northern Poland and Carpathian region were analysed using 13 microsatellite markers. Obtained results revealed high genetic diversity between studied stocks and clear differentiation between northern and southern populations and hybridization between these two major clads. As a recommendation, the principle of treating regions as metapopulations should be applied, which, in the case of Poland, means using the division of the northern and southern genetic lines that were revealed in the present study.\n\nThe Carpathian Mountains are one of the most complex orogenetic areas of Europe, with unique fauna, including the brown trout (Salmo trutta). In this study we performed population genetic analysis of 12 differentS. truttapopulations using two types of molecular markers: nine microsatellites and mitochondrial D-loop sequences. The following working hypothesis was considered: the Romanian Carpathians and their surrounding lowlands can be key relief units based on which theS. truttagenetic diversity, spread, distribution, connectivity, relative isolation and genetic divergence can be at least partially explained. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the majority of sequences were grouped in the Danubian clade. The high haplotype diversity of the 12 analyzed brown trout populations can be explained by the high nucleotide diversity. The microsatellite analysis revealed an inbreeding event for all the loci and for the populations analyzed. The Romanian Carpathians&#39; shape and geogra..."
