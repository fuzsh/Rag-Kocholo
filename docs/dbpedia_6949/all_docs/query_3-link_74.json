        "text": "Guest Post by Martin Armstrong\n\nYour future will be utterly destroyed because of these Neocons who are consumed with personal hatred of Russians. They are pushing American policymakers, arguing that Putin is bluffing and we can, therefore, destroy Russia, and he will never fire a shot. They insist that Putin won’t put his money where his mouth is regarding escalation. Adam Kinzinger, who is the classic Neocon – a Republican congressman from Illinois who jumped ship and ran to CNN so he could preach World War III after losing the election because of his views. He is now CNN’s senior political commentator. This is the same Adam Kinzinger who insanely claimed that we could “TAKE OUT” Russia in three days! I guess we could wipe out China in 4.5 days and then rule the world so nobody will retaliate. I have NEVER heard such reckless commentary in my entire life. And he is joined by another Neocon, Ben Hodges, a retired United States Army officer who served as commanding general of United States Army Europe.\n\nWe have a very dangerous situation brewing, and Neocons are just so consumed by their personal hatred they are threatening civilization. As a hedge fund manager, you NEVER take a position without understanding where you are wrong. These people would NEVER be a trader because they clearly assume they will win and Russia and China would NEVER retaliate and just fall to their knees and beg for forgiveness and lick their shoes while they are there.\n\nIf hate crimes are to be enforced, they should drag these people out of office, lock them up in the hole, and throw away the key. They do not deserve the death penalty, for that is far too easy. People WRONGLY I think the death penalty is the worst. There are plenty of people in prison for life who would take that option if it was offered. These Neocons have weaseled their way into positions of power to manipulate the power of the United States for their personal vendettas. They are a threat to world peace and your future. People like Adam Kinzinger and Ben Hodges are very dangerous and will bring the United States to its destiny with the fall from the financial capital of the world.\n\nThis only lends credence to those telling Putin he should nuke Kiev and then ask the world is this where you want to go. They can do as the Americans did to Japan and drop leaflets, giving them a few days to get out of town. If they did what the Americans did and dropped these warnings, then they can argue they have done nothing different from the Americans. However, the argument is that then the people will see Russia is not bluffing, and they will round up these Neocons and lock them up where they belong.\n\nPerhaps that is the only way to prevent a complete all-out nuclear war. The average person has to wake up and demand that their governments back off. Should we all destroy our future and that of our children and grandchildren all for the Donbas? Since the Ukrainians are denied a right to vote to remove Zelensky, they need to storm this palace to say their own country. Nearly 10 million have fled Ukraine, and Ukrainians are not allowed to decide their own fate, for that comes from Blinken in Washington.\n\nThey are pushing this nonsense that Putin is bluffing with his threats of nuclear escalation. NATO’s Secretary General, another sad representative of humanity, Jens Stoltenberg, has also dismissed the likelihood of Western aid to Ukraine leading to Russian retaliation. Personally, to save the world, NATO should be utterly destroyed. The Biden administration is controlled by Blinken and his other conflicted Neocons with lineages back to Ukraine who all profess their families were persecuted by Russians. They have usurped the power of the United States for personal gain, and there is NOBODY in Congress with the courage to save our nation.\n\nBlinken makes the decisions, and the debate shows that Biden is not running the country. Blinken jas pushed the Biden Administration, allowing Ukraine to use US weapons to wage war inside Russia now directly —a red line the administration previously refused to cross. If I hire a hitman to tell him to kill someone, I cannot then claim innocence in court because he pulled the trigger.\n\nHistorically, let me make this perfectly clear to these people who are bringing the world to destruction. War has ALWAYS escalated when their red lines are crossed. The assumption that Putin is bluffing is self-serving is by people who just hate Russians. Historically, countries usually DO NOT bluff, and when they make such threats, they are eventually carried out. Indeed, if this morally corrupt individual ever studied history, they would discover multiple examples throughout history that show how this very proposition has led to death, destruction, and the disastrous fall of empires, nations, and city-states. Chinese general Sun Tzu has been revered for centuries for his wisdom in dealing with wars. These Neocons have waged endless wars since Vietnam under the pretense that they must defeat Russia. As Tzu warned: “There is no instance of a nation benefiting from prolonged warfare.” Nearly 2/3rds of our national debt is because of war – not social benefits. Since we NEVER pay off our debt, we then pay interest forever on every war, and the veterans have to be provided healthcare for life for their service.\n\nPutin is the ONLY wise man or adult in the room. Putin trusts Sun Tzu’s words: “Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.”This arrogance is filling the air and it is so obvious that the West will lose. Even Tzu said:\n\n“He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.”\n\nThe Roman god Janus was the god of the beginning and ending of conflict, hence war and peace. In ancient Rome, the Temple of Janus stood in the Roman Forum with doors on both ends. Inside was a statue of Janus, who is always represented as the two-faced god. The doors of his temple were open in times of war and closed to mark peace. During a war, the Romans understood that things could change politically during the war. During peace, everything was stable. Janus (Ianuarius) is depicted as having two faces because he simultaneously looks to the future and the past. So, when we celebrate New Year’s Eve, and we say goodbye to the past and hello to the future, which is a concept stemming from Janus. This ancient concept illustrated the stark difference between war and peace. During the war, you NEVER know when they will end, and you certainly are not guaranteed the outcome.\n\nOur Neocons and the press are cheering war and are telling everyone that Putin is bluffing just, and MacArthur misread the Chinese, and the Japanese, and Kruschev both misjudged America. They have thrown caution to the win and ASSUME that they will be victorious. History warns that both sides believe they will be victorious, but in the end, only one is. This is not a roulette table where we put it all in red or black and presume we will win. They are playing with the lives of so many people, all for their personal hatreds.\n\nAs an Amazon Associate I Earn from Qualifying Purchases"
