        "text": "“Thinking doesn’t pay. Just makes you discontented with what you see around you.” – Robert A. Heinlein, Stranger in a Strange Land\n\n“A hard, cold wisdom is required for goodness to accomplish good. Goodness without wisdom always accomplishes evil.” – Robert A. Heinlein, Stranger in a Strange Land\n\nI guess I think too much, because I’m terribly discontented with what I see around me. There are millions of virtue signaling liberals in this country who actually believe they are doing good by supporting the invasion of our country by third worlders who don’t share our sense of morality, community, or civic obligation to future generations. They certainly do not display wisdom in this misguided belief these invaders will strengthen the social fabric of our country. Instead they display unmitigated ignorance regarding the fact these Soros imported mutts want to destroy the country we have worked so hard to create. Destruction, chaos, and civil discord is the goal of those unleashing this assault upon our ramparts.\n\nI have tried to distance myself from coming into contact with these invaders. Many people were drawn to my website by my 30 Blocks of Squalor articles detailing the degradation of West Philly by feral blacks running amuck from 69th street to 39th street. The dirt, depravity, degeneracy, and deterioration of a once thriving white metropolis was a perfect example of where supposed goodness (LBJ’s Great Welfare Society) without wisdom only accomplishes evil. Blacks trapped in welfare slave encampments for eternity due to government policies is evil personified.\n\nI haven’t gone near West Philly since I left Wharton in 2019. My current trek to work doesn’t lead me past undesirables, so there has been little to write about. Well, it appears the undesirables are coming to me now. My township consists of 18,000 people. According to the latest census data, the demographics are: White -78%, Asian – 10%, Black -8%, Hispanic – 2%, Other – 2%. We have little to no crime – I wonder why? We’ve lived here for 29 years and have appreciated the homogeneity (aka whiteness) of our community.\n\nThere is a park two miles from our house called Fischer’s Park where we took the boys as children to play on the playgrounds, scooter along their many trails, and fish in the creek. George Washington and his troops camped here in October 1777, after their defeat at the Battle of Germantown, on their way to Valley Forge and that fateful winter. Now that the boys are grown, my wife and I go there a few times per week and walk 2 to 3 miles along their quiet scenic walking paths. This is the description on their website:\n\nLocated in the south-central portion of the Township, 77 acre Fischer’s Park is Towamencin’s largest park facility. The facilities located here include: 5 covered pavilions, 3 plus miles of walking trails with numerous benches and rest spots, 2 playgrounds with equipment for youngsters, 2 regulation bocce courts, a fishing pier, open meadow areas for children to run around and numerous game tables for chess, checkers or other table games.\n\nThe Meadow View pavilion houses restrooms. In addition, there is the Arneth Entertainment Center which provides a sheltered performance venue for Township movies and musical events in the warmer months. The audience can enjoy the entertainment while relaxing in the grass meadow having a picnic with friends.\n\nThe park is split by Towamencin Creek which contains a dam that creates a small pond. The waterway and dam are surrounded by natural areas that provide a quiet setting for meditation and add to the park’s aesthetic value. The fishing pier is available at the pond for those who want to practice their angling skills. The park is a favorite destination for people to exercise or to walk their dogs. There are over one hundred parking spaces just inside the main entrance to accommodate visitors.\n\nIt has been a delightful park for the last three decades, but within the last few months a noticeable change has taken place. I’m sure it has nothing to do with our new mail-in ballot elected African Communist Township Supervisor. Just a coincidence, I’m sure. When you live in a township with 78% white people, you could assume that 3 out of 4 people at your local park would be white. And for decades that was most certainly true at Fischer’s Park. In the summer when they have their concerts in the park with Shot of Southern and the Fab 4 Beatles cover band, you were guaranteed to have a park overflowing with white people in beach chairs.\n\nIn an attempt to reduce my chances of a heart attack from 20% in the next ten years to something lower, we have ramped up our walking in the park. We had been noticing a significant increase in foreigners roaming the park over the last couple months, with an extreme uptick in black burkas worn by the muslim women who have been allowed in public by their male masters. They aren’t there to exercise, as they mostly congregate under the pavilions, eating goat or whatever muslims eat. At first it was only a few, but now we feel like a stranger in a strange land.\n\nThis past Sunday was breathtaking to behold. The entire park was filled with muzzies in their garb, jib jabbering in whatever language they speak, playing soccer, and jamming up the walking paths because they have no manners or couth. They are ignorant, rude and entitled. I’m not exaggerating when I say 3 out of 4 people in Fischer’s Park were muslims. We were clear minorities in the park we have been frequenting for three decades. I’m expecting to see a scene like this on our next trip.\n\nWhere are they coming from? According to the census data from 2022, they don’t live in my township. Has an invasion taken place since 2022 and I now live in a community inundated with muslims? There are a couple lower end rental communities in Towamencin. Is this where the hoard of foreign invaders are holed up? They are not American citizens. They don’t speak our language. They don’t honor freedom and liberty. But you can be damn sure they know how to milk every dime they can from Biden’s welfare system.\n\nIt’s almost as if the government is secretly funneling these muslim parasites into our communities through whatever means necessary. Everything our government does pushes the country closer and closer to tyranny. If my lily white community is seeing this rampant influx of muzzies, the urban ghettos must be overflowing with parasites. My 30 Blocks of Squalor articles detailed how lazy, ignorant blacks destroyed their neighborhoods while killing each other over drugs. These muzzies are a different breed. They want to topple our Christian traditions and remake our society with their dark ages rituals. They are aggressive and dangerous and will need to be confronted sooner, rather than later. I don’t like being a stranger in my own land.\n\n“Secrecy begets tyranny.” – Robert A. Heinlein, Stranger in a Strange Land"
