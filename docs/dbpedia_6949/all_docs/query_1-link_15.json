Reutlingen District/ Baden-Wuerttenberg. History. Believed to be the oldest German horse stud farm. It dates back 500 years [maybe more].... By 1477 it belonged to Graf Eberhard V. Christoph, the Duke of Wuerttemberg, who expanded the stud farm in 1573 and named his horses line as Wuerttembergers that had been improved by local breeds. By the 1700s and 1800s, the Marbach Stud Farm, as it was known by then, was using Mecklenburger, Holstein and an English and Norman-bred studs for the heavier breeds such known to us as the Cleveland Bay, orkshire Coach Horse and m favorite the Clydesdale for the heavier work horese. The \"sport horeses\" were thoroghbred and known as Trakehner. The best known was the stallion was Julmond (1938-1965) used to formed the Wuerttemberger from the work horse into a sport horse. It was known in it's earlier times as a stud farm for \"warmblood\" horses. It still breeds what is known as he Wuerttmberger. However, today, it's known best for its Weil-Marbach Arabians. A statue of Hadban Enzahi (Arabian from Egypt) stands at the Marbach Stud Farm. They have a few \"cold blood\" thouroughbreds. [NOTE: My great grandfather in Borodino Bessarabia, S. Russia, bred horses. He had Arabians from Persia, several Clydesdale-like studs and mares and studs and mares bred for the heavier horse breed used by officers in the Tsar's Cavalry.] The one Hein family was said to have between 300 to 400 horses near Kischinev.

Next to the Boellingen's (Bellinger / Bollingers) homestead (yards) which is doc. in the 9th century. (See history of the Boellinger Mill in Wikipedia.) Earlier there was an Alemannic settelment built abt 767. In 1161 it was called Neccargardacha and mentioned in a charter of Emperor Barbarossa. In the middle ages the Castle Church was fortified and served as a shtler. By the 11th century it was under the feudal rule of the Upper Diocese of Worms. The Lords of the vineyard and village was Engelhardt in 1323 and they sold it in 1341 for 1,2000 Hellers. It then came under the fief of the Heilbronn partricaisn Feurer Bewin and Erer. In 1399 Wuerttemberg soldiers burned down the village. It rose up out of the ashes. In 1440 the town and the vineyar came under the rule of Palatinte. It was a dipute that lasted a century because Wuerttemberg believed it belonged to them along with the imperial city of Heilbronn. They did hold the monasteries in Billingen, Laulfen, Odenheim, St. Peter in Wimpfen Carle Monastery in Heilbronn as well as the hosptial and farms in Neckargartach. In 1622 te Spanish picted their tentns in Neckarartach for the battle of Wimpfen. The tales about the Spanish while in Neckargartach are filled with \"horrible atrocities\".

Their were humans here in prehistoric times. By the 7th century the area belonged to Bligger von Steinach, a fiefholder, who's sons and grandson build the four Neckrsteinach castles (so called in the wikipedia article). A member of the family known as Landschad fortified the castle known as Vorderurg. Count Palatinate Ruprecht is mentioned in the history of this village in 1377 along with the Bishop of Worms. Hans III Landschad von Steinach turned to Lutheranism in 1522. The Catholic League under Count Johann Tserclase Tilly entered the area in 1621. left and returned... From 1662 to 1908 the Evangelical church in the village held three denominations. During the Nine Years' War (1688 to 1697) the French, Saxons, Brandenburgish ad Baravia troops passed through the area during the different stages of the war. Following 1685 the \"Welsche\", known to most of us as Huguenots who had been driven out of France settled in Neckarsteinach. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714), Polish Succession (1733-1738) and the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-48) the wounded was quartered here in \"field hospitals\". In 1699 the ownership of the village, Caspar Hugo von Metternich zu Muellenark, give ownership to his heirs who in turn gave ownership in 1738 to the Baronial von Hundheim family. The villagers and lords held serious confrontations over this new situation. It was not until 1750 that Hugo Franz Wolfgang Metternich settled these disputes and upon his death in 1754 the Electoral Palatinate and the bishopric of Worms claimed the town and held on to it until 1803, when everything changed. Under Napoleon Neckarsteinach was handed to Hesse.... I .stumbled over a web site called \"Journey-to-Germany.com\" and found some information on Neckarsteinach (http://www.journey-to-german.com/neckarsteinach.html). I don't know who wrote the information but I can't give credit where the author or authors re not named. It is often a risk to quote unknown sources but I think it's pretty safe in this situation to give some quotes that are interesting to me since I have an ancestor who lived here for a time. According to the article the following is mentioned..: (1) There are four old \"Burgen\", which means they are not big enough to be called castles(=schloss) They all look down at the Neckar River and over the village. They are called \"Vorderburg\", \"Mittelburg\", \"Hinterburg\" (the oldest and built around 1100 AD) and the Schadeckburg or Burg Schadeck that carries the name \"swallow's next (=Schwalbeenest). All but the Hinterburg were built before 1376 when the village was called Steinach which changed in 1377 to Neckarsteinach (Steinarch an der Neckar). Steinach being a common name meaning \"stony\". The oldest \"Burgen\" is stands in ruins. One can seem the remains of the four walls, even >>climb some stairs in the remaining tour and have a fantastic view of the river and village\"<< is what is written in this article. The second one built was \"Vorderburg\" and the third one was the \"Mittleburg\". The lat two were built in the 12th century. And they are privately owned and are residence of the family and they do not take in visitors. The fourth, Burg Schadeck, was built in 1230 . (3) Farther back in time, the Romans were here and planted trees and vineyards. (4). >>The village itself is remarkably well preserved; with many 13th to 15th century old half timber houses overlooking the two rivers.<< There are 15 photographs shown.\n\nJohannes Rehberger migr. fr.

The first known document about Peterzell is dated 1275 in the tax book of the diocese of Konstanz. It is not sure but thought to have been founded by Duke of Teck and his wife Ute when they built a church. After 1218 the property belonged to the Zaehringian line of Teck which also acquire land in the upper Necker area and around Oberndorf in the 1200s to the 1300s. The church and it's property when through a variety of hands: Johannes of Bradneck, Falkenstein, family of Haug (Haeck) of Rottweil.... Dukes of Wuerttemberg were to make claim in the middle part of the 1500s. Farms mention around the 1500s were Breitenwieser, Roemllinsdorf, Eich, Birk, Greut and two Lindenbruch's.

There was the Country Paltine of the Rhine which was later known as the Electoral Palatinate (Kurpfalz). During the period of the Holy Roman Empire (1085-1803), the historical territory known as Palatinate was ruled by the Count of Palatine. Today it's known as the German federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate. There were parts of the Alsace, which is now in France, that were part of the Palatinate from 1418 to 1766.
