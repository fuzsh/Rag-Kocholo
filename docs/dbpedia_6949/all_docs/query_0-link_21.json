        "text": "During the transition from Late Antiquity to the Middle Ages, the Roman Empire dissolved in the West and medieval empires were founded. There has been much discussion about the role that migration played in this transition. This is especially true for the formation of the Baiuvariian tribe and the founding of this tribal dukedom, which took place from the 5 th to the 6 th century in what is now Southern Bavaria (Germany). In this study, we aimed to determine the extent of immigration during the beginning of this transformation and to shed further light on its character. To achieve this goal, we analyzed stable isotope values of strontium, carbon, and nitrogen from the teeth and bones of over 150 human remains from Southern Germany, dating from around 500 AD. This group of individuals included women with cranial modifications (ACD) which can be found sporadically in the burial grounds of this period. Our results showed an above-average migration rate for both men and women in the second half of the 5 th century. They also indicate that a foreign background may also be assumed for the women with ACD. The demonstrably different origins of the immigrants from isotopically diverse regions, and the identification of local differences in detectable migration rate, as well as indication for different timing of residential changes, highlight the complexity of immigration processes and the need for more studies at the regional level.\n\nResidential changes of people during the Migration Period are crucial for archaeological research. Within an extensive study of the migration of the Langobards, strontium isotope analysis was carried out on tooth enamel taken from 48 burials from the Thuringian cemeteries of Rathewitz and Obermöllern (Burgenlandkreis, Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany), which date to the late 5th–mid 6th century. Modern vegetation and water samples provided detailed information about the isotopic composition of the biologically available strontium of geological units in the area. Although the rich furnishing of the burials provides evidence for contacts with many different regions, only one individual (7.1 %) in Rathewitz and three (12.5 %) in Obermöllern are isotopically nonlocal to the sites. These individuals were buried among the locals and their graves were similarly equipped. In contrast, many nonlocal grave goods were found with isotopically local individuals, often in combination with local items or pieces indicating several different source areas. This suggests the existence of strong interregional ties among the members of the local elites. The cemeteries cannot overall be associated with newly arriving groups; rather, they resulted from a change of funeral customs of the indigenous population from cremation to inhumations or small-scale changes of the burial places. They reflect individual residential changes rather than large-scale movements of groups.\n\nThis paper presents the results of an investigation into the pro- cess of centralization that took place north of the Alps during the Late Hallstatt and Early Latène Culture, conducted within the framework of a special research program. The focus of the archaeozoological project was on investigating livestock farm- ing and the supply of Early Celtic hillfort sites and their rural environs. The Early Latène site Hochdorf in southwestern Germany, near the princely seat Hohenasperg, was a wealthy Introduction settlement characterized by crop farming, stock breeding, wool production, and weaving. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios in Iron Age livestock teeth from Hochdorf indicate that predominantly areas above the geo- logic unit Keuper were used for pasture, and that some portion of the livestock were probably kept at a distance of about 15–30 km from the site or were imported from further away. The intra-species, intra-individual, and intra-tooth variations reflect movements and non-permanent pastures for cattle, cap- rines, and even pigs. The high variations among the 87Sr/86Sr values found in livestock render domestic animals not always suited for use in determining the local strontium signature for the region of Hochdorf. Modern snail shell and water samples reflect the local geology nicely; though they too yield highly variable values, too, reflecting the varied geology of the region.\n\nThis paper presents the strontium (Sr) isotope composition of the teeth of Neolithic individuals from the Linearbandkeramik (LBK) pit-enclosure of Herxheim (South Palatinate, Germany). The Sr isotope analyses are vital for the comprehension of the extraordinary site of Herxheim with the abundant human bone modifications found there. The large number of dead individuals, as well as the various exotic styles of high quality pottery of the latest LBK phase, found with the fragmented human skeletons, support movement from foreign places to Herxheim. Sr isotopes of tooth enamel have been analyzed to establish the possible origins of the individuals at Herxheim. Initial results for individuals found in the regular Bandkeramik burial position and for samples from a concentration of fragmented skeletons indicate the presence of a significant amount of nonlocal individuals, in a proportion higher than reported for other LBK settlements to date. None of the modified skeletal remains from the site investigated thus far belong to indigenous individuals. The observed Sr isotope ratios often indicate basement rock signatures. A subgroup of individuals has high 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.712–0.715, suggesting similarities to a group of five juveniles found in the Neolithic settlement of Nieder-Mörlen/Hesse.\n\nIn the last forty years, continuing rescue excavations in the Lower Traisen valley (Unteres Traisental) in Lower Austria have identified about 180 burials dating to the final Neolithic (2600–2200 BC). They belong to the Corded Ware culture and Late Bell Beaker culture. Enamel from permanent teeth of a total of 49 individuals originating from Subsites I, II and III of the Franzhausen (FH) excavation area were analysed with respect to their strontium isotopic composition. The aim was to identify locals and nonlocals and to contribute to questions of mobility and migration. We applied a validated routine procedure for Sr isotope ratio measurements using solutionbased multiple collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). In addition, recent soil samples from the Franzhausen area were extracted by ammonium nitrate solutions in order to delimit the local isotope signal of bioavailable Sr in the region. 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the enamel revealed that about 88 % of the investigated individuals are autochthonous. These data were subjected to a further detailed evaluation with respect to the individuals’ age at death and sex, as well as to a possible spatial differentiation (FH I, II and III) and cultural affiliation. Sr isotope ratio data show no pattern regarding age at death. Higher mobility was found for male individuals compared to that for females. Results evaluated according to chronological and spatial subgroups imply differences in mobility. Distinct groups of representatives of the Corded Ware culture in the subsites were identified as nonlocals, whereas all of the investigated individuals assigned to the Late Bell Beaker culture were locals."
