        "text": "The Sauer is a river in France (Alsace) and Germany (Rhineland-Palatinate). A left tributary of the river Rhine, its total length is about 85 kilometres (53 mi), of which 64 km (40 mi) in France.[1] Its upper course, in Germany, is called Saarbach. Its source is in the Palatinate forest, near the French border, south of Pirmasens. It flows into France near SchÅnau, and continues through WÅrth and north of Haguenau. It flows into the Rhine in Seltz, opposite the mouth of the Murg.\n\nFor the tributary to the Moselle, see Sauer."
