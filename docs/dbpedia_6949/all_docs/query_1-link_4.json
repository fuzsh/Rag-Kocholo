        "text": "I modified this template to use a new CSS style that hides table rows if the corresponding parameters are left blank. This system also means we no longer need to call a sub-template, eliminating any conflict with WP:AUM. No article edits are required by these changes. —Papayoung ☯\n\nTemplate:River has been nominated for deletion. You are invited to comment on the discussion at Wikipedia:Templates for deletion#Template:River. Thank you.--Wikiacc (talk)\n\nNote: The original Template river has been deleted and that name is now used for the WikiProject talk page template. Rmhermen\n\nI've redirected \"basin\" to watershed, as that is the most reasonable option on the disambig page - but that makes two links to watershed in this article, so you may wish to find an alternative expression. BD2412 T\n\nI don't know anything about the creation of templates, but I've noticed that the static descriptors (Origin, Length, Basin countries, etc.) have disappeared from the finished infobox, so that now there's just a list of countries and numbers with no information about what they refer to. See the Volga example at top. What happened? Can anybody fix it? Malepheasant\n\nThe change was reverted and it's fine now, so... thanks! -- Malepheasant\n\nSorry about that. A new feature, '#if:' (see m:ParserFunctions), was built into the MediaWiki software by the developers to replace 'hiddenStructure' and 'qif'. I was converting this to that new format so it will be ready when those older methods are removed. I made a mistake in the line spacing which caused the problem, but it should be corrected now. Please let me know if there are other issues. --CBDunkerson\n\nI realize many major rivers flow into the sea, but many rivers flow into other rivers. It seems that it would be useful to include the elevation of the river at the mouth. If it is sea level, this could be left blank or entered as \"sea level\" (or whatever the accepted term is). Thanks, Ruhrfisch\n\nI agree that this would be a useful addition. Malepheasant\n\nI agree as well. This would also help us identify rivers that are essentially at risk of sea level rise vs. those that are less threatened. MCalamari\n\nIn addition to talking about river discharge as a flowrate (cfs), for water supply purposes US engineers look to the annual volume of water without any time reference. The common unit of discharge is acre-feet or thousands of acre-feet. Could we add a second discharge box called \"discharge volume\" to supplement the \"discharge flowrate\"? Discharge volumes are also very important on rivers that are dammed, as any reservoir storage volume or capacity is somewhat related (based on the design needs of the structure) to the annual discharge volume. (Flood pools will still be set to discharge flowrates, but storage pools will tend to focus on the longer time averaged volume.) MCalamari\n\nIf anybody is interested in working examples, check out Chicopee River Watershed. This has a top-level menu with links to the major rivers (as well as other waterbodies) within this river system. I think the existing template will handle just about anything one would want in an introduction, which is what an infobox really is anyway. Of course you can have rivers with three (maybe more) heads as in the Swift River entry, but I just put the longest branch for the head in the infobox, with further explaination is the text. It seems to work out okay. -- LymanSchool\n\nI noticed that there are two wikilinks to Source (river or stream) in the Template:Infobox River (\"Origin\" and \"Source Elevation\"). Per WP:MOS shouldn't there be just one link? Thanks, Ruhrfisch\n\nHello, I've created a new version for the Infobox template. For the time being it's at Template:Geobox River. It's based on the same css and logic as Template:Infobox City and Template:Infobox Country thus aiming to have all geography related infoboxes in the same layout. The new template can be used for both short local streams as well as huge river with a lot of data about such as the Amazon, where I gave it a kick-off. Let's try to use it for a while from its current location and if it proves usefull, it could, hopefully, replace this one. If you have any question feel free to post them on my talk page. Caroig\n\nI like the inclusion of source and mouth coordinates. Since there are already many rivers with infoboxes, I suggest using parameters with the same name as in the present infobox. Markussep\n\nI see the point and I've given it a thought when working on the new template but it contains (resp. can contain) much more data and so some field cannot be simply reused. Take elevation, in the old template it's used for the mouth elevation, the new template has fields for both source elevation and mouth elevation. The same applies , e.g., for caption as in the new template there can be a caption for both the map and the image. Nonetheless, some field names remain the same, 'e.g.' length, watershed.\n\nDid you announce your new template at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Rivers already? Markussep\n\nWould it be possible to include a completed sample of the visual presentation of the new version for discussion (or a link to a page on which it is being used)? My first thought is that a photograph at the top might make for a more inviting (and varied) introduction to an article than a map (as with Infobox city). --Malepheasant\n\nOkay, now I see that examples are linked from the bottom of the WikiProject Rivers page. --Malepheasant\n\nWhen using the old template, I often like to include citations for some details, such as a GNIS reference for geographic coordinates and elevations. (Monday Creek for an example.) This is especially useful for details (like geographic coordinates) that don't really flow well in the text of an article, and helps reduce the need for inline citations in the body by moving them to the infobox. Is there a way to introduce citations into a more complex template such as this one? I gave it a try just now and it seemed to cause errors and jumbled text. --Malepheasant\n\nI'm afraid this isn't possible, the new infobox acts rather like a database, so the input fields need to be just plain numeric or textual values. I haven't encountered this when creating the new infobox. It might be possible to include say source_location_citation (etc.) fields if required. – Caroig\n\nThere is at least one Featured Article, Paulins Kill, in which sources are cited within the fields of the old infobox. I also found this discussion on the Manual of Style talk page concerning the propriety of including information in the infobox that is not in the main text of the article (summary: it's an acceptable practice when presentation of the information would interfere with good prose, but sources must be cited.) So I'd be sadly opposed to entirely replacing the old template unless this could be addressed. I like having more informational fields to work with, but I think that having the flexibility to cite sources as needed is highly important, and that the new version as it exists presently would appear to be quite disruptive to existing citations. --Malepheasant\n\nI like the new infobox, but agree with Malepheasant that a picture would better first. The MOS says to start the article with a right aligned image, and while a map is certainly an image, I think a photograph is generally better. It is also easier for most editors to take a photo than to make a map, so the first image should be the one that is easier to obtain. I also think that most readers will get a better first idea of the river by seeing a picture of it than by seeing a map.\n\nDespite the labels, I suppose there is nothing to stop someone from using a photo first, then putting the map in second (any image could go in either place, with a proper caption, just the labels would be \"wrong\"). Would it make sense to label the fields Image One and Image Two (and Caption One and Caption Two)? Then the \"directions\" could explain one is for a map and the other a photo, and give a preferred order but leave it up to the editor?\n\nLast question: Is there an easy way to translate old river infoboxes to the new one, or do we just have to paste in the old data by hand? I would like to update some articles' boxes, but also want to wait until the new box is the final version. Thanks for doing this! Ruhrfisch\n\nFirst, thanks for the feedback. Before I reply let me say a few words about why I created this template. It's not so much about the graphic style but rather about the information it contains, what purpose the infobox serves. In my view, the role of infoboxes is to summarize the important data in a uniform way so no matter what the article is about, the reader should find the information (such as country, region, map, length, height etc.) in the same place. There are, as I see it, too many articles (not only about rivers), where I am rather surprised what data find in the infobox and also many others where the infoboxes contain short stories (like the stream lies some km northest from the village center) which I think belong to the article. I got inspired by the Template: Infobox Country and Template:Infobox City which too are rather strict concerning the data they can contain and don't allow for stories in them. I'm not saying this is the right view, it's how I see it and therefore I decided to rather create a new infobox from scratch than to change the current template. (I created two more templates using the same style and syntax Template:Infobox Mountain Range and Template:Infobox Mountain Summit).\n\nAnyway, as for the suggestions mentioned above:\n\nmap or picture first - I can add a switch to the template which would allow to use either map or a photograph first. Or if just a photograph exists put it first, otherwise put the map first. I would rather keep map and image fields as it is easier to manipulate the fields for an automated system (transfer to another database any future template change). I personally like the map first because the photograph is not always very representative as it shows just a selected section of the river.\n\nautomated translation of infoboxes - If there's enough interest in that, there are two ways how to achieve that. I could create an intermediary template which would analyze the old infobox (I'm not sure if MediaWiki syntax is powerful enough to achieve that) and insert the new one with the data appropriatly filled in. Or, and that might be easier for me and producing a cleaner code, write a PHP script that would read the old infobox and produce the code for the new, that would have to be on my server. In both cases it would have to somehow strip the values if they are too story-like.\n\ncitations in the infobox - Should there be a way to do so or not? Would it make the infobox again rather messy?\n\nI suggest moving this discussion to Infobox_River_Geography where it might be more appropriate. – Caroig\n\nI went and upgraded the template so that it would convert to and from imperial/US and SI. I hadn't realised that it was being replaced with a new version. I'll document the upgrade but put a depreciated tag on the page. JЇѦρ\n\nThe discussion page notes the default image size of 288px. This is great for horizontal images, but too big (in my opinion) for tall ones. Any way to override the default? See my problem at: St. Croix River (Nova Scotia) Verne Equinox (talk)\n\nI concur. This box is usefull but size is distracting. It dominates some articles I'm working on. My contributions\n\nCan one of you infobox gurus please add the operator: width= to control box size.\n\nAlso same request for Template:Infobox Waterfall. Thanks Marcus (talk)\n\nGerman Wikipedia has its own equivalent of this infobox (but with a few more parameters). It would considerably aid the transfer of articles from de.wiki if there was an infobox on en.wiki which recognised the German field names and automatically translated them into English and I could quite easily create this. However that would mean a second infobox (called Infobox Fluss) with a similar purpose. However it should be possible to expand this one to cope with the German fields by using a redirect and adding the extra coding required. Obviously the German coding would not be noticed by articles created in English from scratch. Is there merit in doing this (I might need some help) or should I create a separate template? --Bermicourt (talk)\n\nIt is possible to modify the Infobox River in order to use German infobox information. The same has been done for town infoboxes ({{Infobox German location}}). Once that has been done, {{Infobox Fluss}} can be a redirect to Infobox River. I see the German infobox has more fields than the English one, I'm not sure we need all that information. Markussep Talk\n\nSounds cool! Although the German infobox does have more fields, in some cases they display two fields as one e.g. source name and coords are separated in the infobox but display together, whereas the English infobox sticks all the data in one field. The end effect is similar. --Bermicourt (talk)\n\nLet me see which fields could be merged:\n\nNAME = river_name\n\nBILD = image_name\n\nEINZUGSGEBIET = watershed\n\nLÄNGE = length\n\nQUELLE = origin\n\nQUELLHÖHE = elevation_m\n\nMÜNDUNG = mouth\n\nMÜNDUNGSHÖHE = mouth_elevation_m\n\nABFLUSSMENGE = discharge\n\nThe other fields can't be used directly, but have to be translated or converted. Markussep Talk\n\nI've added a \"progression\" parameter; which can be seen in use on River Penk to describe the path taken by the waters of a river which is a tributary of one or more other rivers, and does not empty directly into a sea or lake.\n\nI've added a \"river system\" parameter, corresponding to the de.wiki \"Flusssystem\" one. So now German rivers at least can be easily updated. --Bermicourt (talk)\n\nI have proposed that we delete {{geobox}}. That may effect this templates. You are invited to particiapte in the Geobox deletion dicussion.\n\nCould a field be added to give the coordinates of the mouth, perhaps using the {coord} template? A field could also be added for the source coordinates using coord, useful if the source were not some other geographic feature already tagged with coordinates (EG not a lake). papageno\n\nGood idea! Markussep Talk\n\nThe other river infobox {{Geobox River}} has fields for source and mouth coordinates. You might consider converting the infobox for rivers you want to add coordinates to, to this other template. Markussep Talk\n\nPlease see discussion of coordinates at WikiProject Rivers. Andy Mabbett (User:Pigsonthewing); Andy's talk; Andy's edits\n\nThe above linked discussion is now archived here. related discussions are at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Rivers/Archive 2#Geographical coordinates and Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Rivers/Archive 2#Use of Co-ordinates on river pages. --AussieLegend (talk)\n\nIt seems, from comparing the before and after version of , that {{Geobox}} has more features for rivers than this template. I propose that we improve this template to match, then deprecate the river-specific instances of Geobox. Thoughts?\n\nStrongly oppose - what is the basis for deleting this functionality of Geobox (and I presume eventually the whole template)? What policy or even guideline says Wikipedia cannot have two similar but not identical templates? Why spend all the time and effort to change this template and then to replace Geoboxes in river articles, when we have a Geobox that already works well and (as you admit) does more than Infobox:River? By the way, glad to see that you are feeling better and back on WP Andy. Ruhrfisch ><>°°\n\nI seem to recall answering this question more than once previously. Perhaps you weren't one of those participating at the time. The rationale is to reduce the long-term maintenance overhead; unify the appearance and location of information in related articles for the convenience of our readers and data re-users, and to minimise confusion for editors. Conversely, what is the rationale for having two, different, templates for the same function? As for the work involved, feel free not to do any of it. Thank you for your kind words about my health.\n\nOh wait, you were involved. Here's what you said: \"if you want to get rid of Geobox, then 1) fix the infoboxes so they can do everything Geobox can, and 2) make sure it is as easy as possible to convert from one to the other, then ask again\". That's exactly what I'm doing. It's already been done for mountains and mountain ranges, without fuss.\n\nThanks for your reply. I have changed my mind (especially as I would have to do the work of updating the river articles I am the chief contributor to if this comes to pass). Wikipedia allows editors fairly wide leeway on how they do many different things here (please see WP:IAR). One example is that there are at least three different ways to cite references (with many similar but not identical templates). Are you going to \"unify\" those too?\n\nAlso, could you please answer my question \"What policy or even guideline says Wikipedia cannot have two similar but not identical templates?\" While you're at it, what policy or guideline says that we need to make life easier for our data re-users? This is a persistent theme in your posts Andy - do you have a conflict of interest? Are you being paid by any of these data re-users? Are you being paid to make things on WP more convenient? I am going to post about your proposal on the Geobox and Wikiproject Rivers talk pages (which I think you should have done already). Ruhrfisch ><>°°\n\nYour assertion that you would have to do any work in this regard is false; I even said as much above. My declaration of interests is available from my user page. I shan't be wasting time, attempting to answer rhetorical questions.\n\nAndy, when it says here (about you) that \"His advice has been sought recently by organisations including Google and FourSquare (on their use of Wikipedia data); and The BBC, Facebook and the London Assembly (on microformats).\" was that paid advice? Do you have a COI? Are you being paid to edit and/or get rid of templates that Google, Facebook, the BBC and other re-users do not like? These are serious questions, not rhetorical.\n\nI ask again (and not rhetorically), could you please answer my question \"What policy or even guideline says Wikipedia cannot have two similar but not identical templates?\" While you're at it, what policy or guideline says that we need to make life easier for our data re-users? I will add a question - where are there examples (on talk pages or elsewhere on WP) of users or editors confused by this template? Ruhrfisch ><>°°\n\nI refer you to my earlier answer.\n\nRE \"what policy or guideline says that we need to make life easier for our data re-users\", uhm, let's see, we what to make things harders for editors and readers so the site is used less and we have fewer editors helping, yeah right. I don't think so! PumpkinSky talk\n\nPumpkinSky - do we write Wikipedia for general readers or to make it easier for Google, etc. to mine the data? The latter is what I am asking about re data re-users (as far as I know, we have very few corporations who are editors). I am also not aware of any complaints about information presented in any Geobox by general readers. Ruhrfisch ><>°°\n\nMy impression is that this represents a huge amount of labor work that won't really add or subtract anything of value to existing river articles. I'm neutral about this change, but as an editor I'd rather spend my time on actually writing articles. Shannon\n\nI often disagree with Andy's position on deleting templates but sometimes he does have good ideas and I do believe that this template could do with some changes to enhance its functionality. I've tried using it in a number of Australian river articles and always found it to be lacking, so I've had to use Geobox. Geobox has its place, so I wouldn't support deletion. --AussieLegend (✉)\n\nAs an example, I've created a testcase here. --AussieLegend (✉)\n\nUseful, thank you.\n\n\"I'd rather spend my time on actually writing articles\" No-one is stopping you.\n\nStrongly oppose. I donate my time and skills to the general public, not to for-profit data re-users who might wish me to edit as they see fit rather than as I see fit. I doubt that many Wikipedia editors want to work for free for Google or any other outside entity. Finetooth (talk)\n\nIf you don't want data re-users - many of whom are members of the general public, or not-for-profit organisations - to reuse your work on Wikipedia - which is perfectly acceptable under the licence you grant - then why are you editing? In any case, ease of data reuse is just one, small, part of the rationale for this change. Do feel free to address the suggestions I've made, to improve this template, though.\n\nUnfortunately, I have to have emergency eye surgery tomorrow, and after that won't be able to edit Wikipedia for a week or two.\n\nAndy, the issue that concerns me here is editorial control, which should never be ceded to a subset of the whole collective. By consensus, the collective has already rejected your proposal to eliminate geoboxes entirely. Your proposal to deprecate geoboxes is essentially the same proposal. The English Wikipedia and the Commons are parts of a commons managed collectively; anyone, including Google, may reuse the product (encyclopedia articles, data, images) under the terms of the GFDL and other licenses and may participate in seeking changes to existing policies and guidelines. However, participating in policy discussions is not the same as setting policy. That power should remain in the hands of the collective, which has already spoken on this matter.\n\nI wish you a speedy recovery from the eye surgery. Finetooth (talk)\n\nStrongly support improving this template. Why wouldn't we want it to be as comprehensive as possible? The issue seems to be whether we then remove functionality from geobox. Personally I find that template confusing, unwieldy, and, often, less comprehensive. Frequently my question has been \"which parameters do I need to extract for an article on rivers/mountains/islands/lakes?\". But there seems to be divergence on that, so why don't we improve this template and then discuss the nature of geobox separately at that talkpage? Bermicourt (talk)\n\nI don't think anyone opposes improving the infoboxes or, for that matter, the geoboxes. Andy's suggestion, however, is to replace geoboxes with infoboxes. That's the idea that has already been rejected. As it stands, editors who prefer infoboxes to geoboxes are free to use infoboxes. Finetooth (talk)\n\nAndy's suggestion is \"that we improve this template to match, then deprecate the river-specific instances of Geobox\". There's no reason why we can't say yes to the first part and no to the second. It doesn't have to be an all-out oppose or support. I agree that editors should be free to use either infobox or geobox. --AussieLegend (✉)\n\nStrongly oppose - I made that edit to the Tame, and did it to improve the article, both in terms of information and as the Geobox has a better format and looks more professional. There are two other reasons I oppose this, one is that nearly 4 years have passed since someone asked for the Infobox ‘origin’ to be changed to ‘source’, yet nothing has happened. I can use the Geobox, with its extra functions and neater format today, and do not have to wait for some Infobox 2 to come around. The other reason is found at Category:Geobox usage tracking for river type which lists over 13,000 uses of the Geobox: river template, it would take forever to alter (and check) those articles for a new box. Jokulhlaup (talk)\n\nComment just to be clear, I do not oppose improving any template. What I strongly oppose is removing River (or any more) functionality from Geobox, in what I suspect is a very clever and patient and stealthy way of deleting the Geobox template (remove almost all the functionalities one by one, then say - \"look at this poor thing, hardly used and doesn't do much, let's delete it\"). I wish Andy a speedy recovery and all the best. Ruhrfisch ><>°°\n\nSince the above doesn't seem to have gained any support, I'd like to propose an alternative, based on comments above. As User:Pigsonthewing has noted, {{Geobox}} has more features for rivers than this template. I propose that we improve this template to match the functionality of {{Geobox}}, or as much of the functionality as determined by consensus, to provide a simpler alternative to the more complex Geobox. Obviously, there are situations where Geobox may be more suitable, so it should remain unaltered for those occasions. --AussieLegend (✉)\n\nFully support and would be grateful if my request above were taken into consideration as part of the improvement drive. --Bermicourt (talk)\n\nCan I suggest a simpler alternative, would it not be easier to create blank templates for {{Geobox}} rivers at different levels of complexity. You could have a Starter version for simple streams, a Mid level for larger/complex rivers, and a Full version for complex situations such as dual sources etc. It is similar to the idea used in Infobox Mountains, where they have created blank templates for different parts of the world. The unneeded commands could be removed for the simpler versions, which would remove the size and complexity issues. There would need to be some explanantion/links from the WP:Rivers page so that they could be found easily. Jokulhlaup (talk)\n\n{{Infobox Mountain}} was split out from Geobox; we can make various blank versions of Infobox river, once it's improved.\n\nNot trying to reignite any old arguments, but what's the current best practice on adding geographical coordinates (source and/or mouth) to a river article using this template? (I'm contemplating trying to add some new fields to this template for that if necessary, but if someone else already has a plan for that I don't want to step on toes / duplicate effort.) —Steve Summit (talk)\n\nsounds like a good idea, since {{geobox}} supports this. what parameters would you like to add? just |mouth_coordinates= and |source_coordinates=? Frietjes (talk)\n\nI was thinking of source_lat_d, source_lat_NS, mouth_long_d, mouth_long_EW, etc. —Steve Summit (talk)\n\nI've taken a stab at this. See below. —Steve Summit (talk)\n\nOkay, I'm adding several new parameters to make coordinate display and entry possible. For the moment I've made the changes to a sandbox copy of the template, but if there are no objections, and if no one finds any serious problems, I'll propagate the changes to the real template in a few days.\n\nI'll describe the new coordinate syntax and template usage, but then I have a couple of questions I'd appreciate people's opinions on.\n\nThere are basically four ways to enter origin and mouth coordinates: as degrees, minutes, and seconds, as decimal degrees N/S/E/W, as signed decimal degrees, and with the {{Coord}} template. I'll illustrate each of these with an example:\n\ndegrees, minutes, and seconds:\n\n| origin_lat_d = 42\n\n| origin_lat_m = 30\n\n| origin_lat_s = 40\n\n| origin_lat_NS = N\n\n| origin_long_d = 73\n\n| origin_long_m = 12\n\n| origin_long_s = 00\n\n| origin_long_EW = W\n\n| mouth_lat_d = 42\n\n| mouth_lat_m = 55\n\n| mouth_lat_s = 39\n\n| mouth_lat_NS = N\n\n| mouth_long_d = 73\n\n| mouth_long_m = 39\n\n| mouth_long_s = 35\n\n| mouth_long_EW = W\n\ndecimal degrees:\n\n| origin_lat_d = 42.5539\n\n| origin_lat_NS = N\n\n| origin_long_d = 71.1441\n\n| origin_long_EW = W\n\n| mouth_lat_d = 42.693\n\n| mouth_lat_NS = N\n\n| mouth_long_d = 70.790\n\n| mouth_long_EW = W\n\nsigned decimal degrees:\n\n| origin_lat_d = 42.1807\n\n| origin_long_d = -72.3654\n\n| mouth_lat_d = 42.1482\n\n| mouth_long_d = -72.6217\n\n{{Coord}} template:\n\n| origin_coordinates = {{Coord|42.4654|N|71.3580|W|type:river|display=inline}}\n\n| mouth_coordinates = {{Coord|42.6465|N|71.3025|W|type:river|display=inline,title}}\n\nThese examples are from the Hoosic, Ipswich, Chicopee, and Concord River articles, respectively, so you can see these new template invocations in action there.\n\nThe template puts the mouth (as opposed to the origin) coordinates at the top of the article, because that seems to be the consensus.\n\nPersonally, I think it's silly to have Geobox/type/river distinct from Infobox river, and ideally I'd hope one day we could settle on one and migrate to it. You may disagree, and I'm not trying to raise that issue today anyway, but your opinion on that question will probably influence your answer(s) to the two questions I do have:\n\nWhat should the origin coordinate parameters be called? Originally I was planning on calling them source_lat_d, source_long_d, etc., for compatibility with Geobox/type/river. But in the end I decided to name them origin_lat_d, origin_long_d, etc., since \"origin\" is what Infobox river uses for the source, and having parameters with two different naming conventions would be confusing. (Using parameter names identical to Geobox/type/river would seem to make converting from one to the other easier, but actually, any conversion from one to the other is going to involve renaming a bunch of other parameters anyway, so what's a few more?)\n\nDo we really need or want the third option, using the origin_coordinates and mouth_coordinates parameters? Some people seem to like this style, and it's supported by e.g. Infobox school. But Geobox/type/river does not support this style of coordinate entry, so any invocations of the new Infobox river that use that style would be that much harder to convert to Geobox/type/river later, if that should ever be necessary.\n\nAnyway, please comment below and let me know what you think. As I said, I expect to make the changes to the official template soon. —Steve Summit (talk)\n\nHaving used both Geobox and the individual infoboxes such as this one I prefer the latter. I found Geobox very unwieldy and difficult to use. Turning to your actual questions:\n\nWe need the ability to display either \"source\" or \"origin\" to take account of the fact that some rivers are viewed as beginning at a source and some at e.g. the confluence of two headstreams each of which has its own name.\n\nIt is useful to be able to input the coordinates using the {{coord}} format, especially e.g. when translating articles as this is often how it will come across. So both are useful.\n\n--Bermicourt (talk)\n\nMaking the label changeable would be straightforward with an origin_label parameter. You want me to add that while I'm at it? (I wonder what the default should be -- \"source\" or \"origin\"?) —Steve Summit (talk)\n\nWe should definitely deprecate the use of geobox for rivers; add any necessary features from it to this infobox, have a bot make replacements, then permanently remove river features from geobox. This is (has?) been done for mountains in Geobox. We most certainly do not need to worry about making conversions in the reverse direction.\n\nGNIS entries (such as this one: 649969) express decimal coordinates as positive/negative numbers, instead of specifying NSEW. Would there be a way to accommodate that method? It would make it speedier to copy-paste from GNIS entries.\n\n(Separately, I do have opinions regarding geoboxes vs infoboxes, and I won't share them here.) --Malepheasant (talk)\n\nYup, ±decimal works, too. (The {{Coord}} template, which all of this is built on, is pretty amazing.) —Steve Summit (talk)\n\nHmm, if I just use ±decimals in the | origin_lat_d and | origin_long_d fields (without specifying NSEW in the corresponding NS and EW fields), it breaks the template. (And it breaks doubly if I try combining ±decimals with NSEW designations.) Do I have to paste in the {{Coord}} template to be able to use the ±decimal method? --Malepheasant (talk)\n\nWell, I thought it worked, and I thought I'd tested it. Let me play with it and see. —Steve Summit (talk)\n\nOkay. Sorry for the false start. I thought I'd tested it, but obviously I didn't, because you're right, it didn't work. (I guess the {{Coord}} tempate isn't quite as amazing as I thought it was.) I've got a tentative fix in place, although I might have to move to {{Geobox coor}} instead, although it's got some issues of its own (like, evidently display= is different). Anyway, please give it another try. See Chicopee River for an example. —Steve Summit (talk)\n\nIt's working for me now, too, thanks! -- Malepheasant (talk)\n\nOkay, I've deployed the changes.[1]. The new coordinates parameters are already in use on five pages: Chicopee River, Concord River, Ipswich River, Little Bighorn River, and River Manifold. I'll update the template documentation next. There's now the task of migrating coordinates out of the random places they're in now into the template; I'll start a thread on that over on Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Rivers. Thanks for everybody's input here. —Steve Summit (talk)\n\nAs discussed above, we should improve this template by importing any beneficial (if not all) river features from {{Geobox}}. I intend to start doing so shortly; does anyone have any views as to what should or should not, be imported, and how?

Frietjes (talk)\n\nOop, after posting at the Rivers Wikiproject talk page I found this. Give me a day or two and I'll respond with some detailed comments about what I'd like to see in a river infobox. Pfly (talk)\n\nOkay, I said I'd post something, but looking at Infobox River and comparing it to Geobox River I find so much troublesome I can't address all of it. But here's some (for Geobox examples, see pages like Rogue River (Oregon) and Columbia River). I like how the Geobox groups similar things together and uses fine lines to organize information. So you get, for example, the parameter name Source in bold, then whatever other parameters relate to it below, like \"location\", \"elevation\", \"coordinates\", etc. In the Infobox information about similar things do not always appear together, like \"Mouth\" and \"Mouth elevation\". The organization of information in Geobox seems much more readable.\n\nAlso in the Infobox you get longer parameter names, which frequently wrap, making things harder to read, like \"Mouth\" and \"Mouth elevation\". Or \"Left tributaries\" and \"Right tributaries\" instead of a simple \"Tributaries\" field with \"left\" and \"right\" subfields. Same thing with \"Basin countries\" and \"Basin area\". At least the mouth coordinates are kept with the Mouth parameter in the Infobox. On the other hand there's \"Origin\", which can have coordinates just like \"Mouth\", but the related elevation parameter is not origin_elevation but source_elevation. More confusing is that both \"Origin\" and \"Source elevation\" are linked to the page River source.\n\nAlso confusing is the way footnoting works. I like how in Geobox if you want a footnote you add a parameter with _note appended for it. So \"length\" and \"length_note\". Or a slightly less obvious one, after specifying coords with \"mouth_lat_d\", \"mouth_lat_m\", etc, you can add a footnote with \"mouth_coordinates_note\". I don't see how to add a footnote to coords specified in this way in Infobox. Adding footnotes to things like \"length\" seems weird. Maybe I'm not understanding but it seems Infobox gives you a \"length\" parameter in which you use a \"Full-text length of the river, using {{convert}} template if necessary\". And you can append a footnote reference. But if you use length_mi or length_km and want a footnote, you put it under the length parameter? That's....counter-intuitive. \"length_note\" makes more sense.\n\nI'm not completely happy with the way discharge data is handled by either template, but find Geobox better. The Infobox seems to assume you want to specify \"average discharge\" for an unspecified location—presumably the mouth. Usually discharge data is calculated at stream gauges that are often not at the mouth. It is important to be able to say where the discharge data is being calculated. Geobox has a \"discharge_location\" location parameter where you can say things like \"for river mile 13\", or \"for Gage 04j, above Foo Creek\", etc. Geobox also gives you fields for average, max, and min discharge stats. Max and min values are commonly cited and important. The Infobox example somehow gives us subfields with \"annual average\", \"June\", and \"December\". That might be useful in addition to max and min. Ideally one could cite various discharge stats easily. Neither template has an easy way to do that. The subfields in the Infobox are not explained—apparently you have to edit the page and examine the code? As with other parameters I found that footnotes for discharge data go under the \"discharge\" parameter, which is weird.\n\nAlso confusing about the Infobox is the parameter names regarding pictures and maps. If you want a picture you use image_name for the file, but when you want a map you don't give the file with map_name but rather image_map?? This is particularly confusing since it clearly doesn't mean an imagemap. Also, you use caption for your image (picture) but map_caption for your map. It all seems rather inconsistent.\n\nAnother apparently inconsistent thing is \"elevation\". It appeared Infobox provided mouth_elevation fields but not source_elevation. It does provide elevation fields. I didn't see how a river could have a single elevation. I guessed the idea was to use the convert template with a range of values. However when I tried it out the elevation fields are displayed as \"Source elevation\".\n\nFinally, reading the list of Infobox parameters I saw native_name and native_name_lang. But the native_name_lang wants an ISO code? It took me a bit to figure this out. I tried it with the ISO code for the Quinault language, which according to Ethnologue is \"qun\". But nothing displays in the Infobox. I also could not get \"other_name\" to display anyway. (edit: Oops, it did work, displaying \"Other name\" like any other parameter; I guess I expected something in the box's header, near where the main name is shown) I put my pretend Infobox at User:Pfly/tests.\n\nThere are other things I could point to, but this seems plenty for now! Sorry for being so critical. One Infobox thing I did like is the \"progression\" parameter. Pfly (talk)\n\nThe ISO code of the native language is used in the lang attribute of the underlying HTML.\n\nMoved from \"Template cleanup and improvements\" section. Rehman\n\nNavigability. The examples from German Wiki that I can find have the following text: \"only during the rainy season\" and \"394 km from Koblenz to Neuves-Maisons\". I'm not hard over on this as I can see pros and cons.\n\nDischarge data. Again the German Wiki template has provision for 6 pieces of data at the source and at named gauges using parameters like \"source_discharge\", \"source_discharge_period\" (e.g. 1960/2005), \"source_discharge_reference\", \"gauge1\", \"gauge1_discharge\", \"gauge1_discharge_period\" and \"gauge1_discharge_reference\". The 10 sub-parameters of \"gaugeX_discharge\" are the name, distance from the mouth, size of the catchment (at that point), lowest discharge rate, date of the lowest discharge rate, average discharge rate, date of the average discharge rate, highest discharge rate, date of the highest discharge rate.\n\nHTH. Cheers. Bermicourt (talk)\n\nHi Bermicourt. Noted on the Navigability; I guess we'll leave that out for now. For discharge data, how about something like this: We create an entirely new header (like \"Physiognomy\") and allow that section to have from something like gauge1 to gauge10 (similar to the source1... parameters), which can have additional parameters to display location, coord, period, and min-avg-max values. Is that good? Rehman\n\nSounds fine to me. I'll also have to look at whether Infobox:Fluss can be amended to automatically display the gauge and discharge info. Bermicourt (talk)\n\nUpdate: Added as discharge1.... Pending period and coord params.
