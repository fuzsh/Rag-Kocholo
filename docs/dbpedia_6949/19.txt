Bissersheim is an Ortsgemeinde – a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality – in the Bad Dürkheim district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.

Bissersheim lies in the northwest of the Rhine-Neckar urban agglomeration. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Leiningerland, whose seat is in Grünstadt, although that town is itself not in the Verbandsgemeinde. It sits at an elevation of 141 m above sea level near the northern end of the German Wine Route. To the west rises the Haardt, the Palatinate Forest’s eastern edge, and in the east stretches the Upper Rhine Plain. Flowing through the municipality from west to east is the river Eckbach, also regionally known as die Eck.
