Robert Randolph and the Family Band

4:05-5:15 p.m. Saturday

Blues Tent

Starting his music career from the church pews, Robert Randolph is known for his skills as a pedal steel guitarist, vocalist and songwriter. Having spent much of his childhood in church, Randolph's musical style has been significantly shaped by his religious upbringing and his exposure to gospel music.

Randolph plays in the sacred steel tradition, a guitar style developed in Church of the Living God and other Christian churches in the United States. It brings a unique blues sensibility to gospel and has broadly influenced a host of rock, blues and soul musicians.

Born in 1977 in New Jersey, Randolph has pushed his music into genres including rock, funk, soul and jazz, and he has become a regular on the jam band circuit. Randolph's more recent music, including his debut album "Got Soul" for Sony Masterworks, showcases this fusion of sounds.

Randolph and his band have been nominated for four Grammy awards over their career, while Randolph has established himself as one of the world’s premier guitar players — in 2010, he was named one of Rolling Stone's 100 greatest guitar players. Randolph also has played with Los Lobos, the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Rob Thomas, Buddy Guy, Elton John and Ringo Starr. He's even performed with Ozzy Ozbourne, a far cry from his church roots.
