        "text": "The acclaimed soul/funk guitarist relishes ‘great’ Michigan connections while touring the globe and finishing up a new album. Read the Local Spins interview and check out Randolph’s playlist of favorite songs.\n\nTHE ARTIST: Robert Randolph & The Family Band\n\nTHE MUSIC: Soul, funk-rock, gospel, jam\n\nWHERE YOU CAN SEE THE BAND: 7 p.m. Thursday at Park Theatre in Holland; Friday night with Motor City Horns at Microbrew & Music Festival in Traverse City\n\nAs music’s preeminent soul and funk pedal steel guitarist – one who’s frequently shared stages with the likes of Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana and Dave Matthews – Robert Randolph loves nothing more than to get people out of their seats to dance and celebrate his explosively upbeat, smile-producing jams.\n\nHe can’t even explain what happens when he blazes through another inspirational riff or solo, other than “this thing takes over” his psyche.\n\n“There’s no better feeling than to sit around and practice music and write songs and then be able to hop on a stage and play with certain people and play in front of different audiences. It’s really one of the best feelings. It’s really joyful,” said Randolph, who grew up playing pedal steel guitar in a New Jersey House of God Church.\n\n“There was always that feeling we would get from church where we were always trying to lift people’s spirits up, to bring joy and to get people to sing along and pray along. It’s been awesome over the years to see how my music gets people through hard times.”\n\nThat ceaseless positivity even shines through when he’s sick and battling the flu, as he was earlier this week during a telephone interview as Randolph and The Family Band prepare to bring the next leg of their U.S. tour to Michigan.\n\nThe band stops first in Holland, performing at 7 p.m. Thursday in the intimate confines of Holland’s Park Theatre, 248 S. River Ave. (Tickets are $30 general admission or $50 for early access VIP tickets; get tickets online here.)\n\nOn Friday, Randolph and his band headline the Traverse City Microbrew & Music Festival at The Village at Grand Traverse Commons with The Motor City Horns. Traverse City’s Billy Strings & Don Julin and Kalamazoo’s The Mainstays also are on the bill. The Avett Brothers headline Saturday, with That 1 Guy, Sister Sparrow & The Dirty Birds and Jack Fivecoate also playing. General admission tickets are $100 for the weekend, $50 for Friday, $55 Saturday. Get details online at microbrewmusic.com.\n\nMichigan always has held special memories for Randolph, who traveled to the state regularly as a teen to visit relatives and close friends such as Calvin Cooke, formerly of Detroit, a pedal steel innovator who made a name for himself inside and outside the House of God Church. Cooke even joined Randolph on stage for his past appearances at Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park in Grand Rapids.\n\n‘MICHIGAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A GREAT STATE FOR ME’\n\n“Michigan is a rich state in music. It’s sort of like the working man’s state; there are so many down-home roots in Michigan. I’m kind of excited about the rebirth that’s been going on recently,” he said, adding that Detroit-area pedal steel players “would teach me stuff and they’d sit down and tell me stories about music. Michigan always has been a great state for me.”\n\nSince moving beyond his “sacred steel” performances in church about 15 years ago, Randolph has quickly established himself as a fiery and influential player, even being listed by Rolling Stone magazine among the 100 greatest guitarists of all time.\n\nHe’s released four studio albums and had his music used for a variety of TV network sports programs. Indeed, the “SEC Nation” college football pre-game show recently announced it will use Robert Randolph & The Family Band’s “Take the Party” as its theme song.\n\n“It’s great exposure,” said Randolph, a huge fan of University of Alabama football who also performs regularly before New York Knicks home basketball games. “I’m a big sports fan and any way I can expose myself to that audience is always a great thing.”\n\nRandolph also is finishing up work on a new album, the follow-up to 2013’s “Lickety Split.” He said the band recorded about 25 songs, including several with special guests such as Buddy Guy and Santana, with hopes of releasing it in December or January.\n\nHaving toured the globe with his band while earning international acclaim, Randolph conceded he and other players from the sacred steel tradition have marveled about that unexpected success.\n\n“They never thought I’d be this guy that I’d become. It just happened,” he said, adding he’s humbled and thrilled to “contribute to the future of music and positivity in music. … It’s been a great ride.”\n\nROBERT RANDOLPH: THE LOCAL SPINS GUEST PLAYLIST\n\nLocal Spins asked Randolph to cite a few of his favorite artists and songs for a playlist. He picked some vintage tunes by players who influenced him personally. “Those are all classics,” he told Local Spins. “Those songs really get me going.” So does this one: Local Spins couldn’t resist adding a fifth, truly infectious song by Randolph himself. There’s even a Spotify version of his list below.\n\n1. Stevie Ray Vaughan, “Texas Flood” (from “Live at the El Mocambo”)\n\n2. Eric Clapton, “Motherless Children” (from “461 Ocean Boulevard”)\n\n3. Jimi Hendrix, “Changes” (from “Band of Gypsys” live with Buddy Miles)\n\n4. The Allman Brothers Band, “Whipping Post” (from “At Fillmore East”)\n\n5. Robert Randolph & The Family Band, “Ain’t Nothing Wrong With That” (from “Colorblind”)\n\nROBERT RANDOLPH GUEST PLAYLIST: SPOTIFY EDITION"
