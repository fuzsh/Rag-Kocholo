        "text": "Album Review: ROBERT RANDOLPH & THE FAMILY BAND – Brighter Days – Released on Provogue/Mascot Label.\n\nIt feels like Robert Randolph has gone back to his musical roots on this outstanding new release. It is produced by Dave Cobb, who has produced lots of artists such as Chris Stapleton.\n\nRobert brings his family again, adding to the feeling of love and togetherness here. His cousins are here and they are bass player Danyel Morgan, and drummer Marcus Randolph, and his sister Lenesha Randolph joins them on vocals.\n\nRobert plays gospel via his pedal steel guitar, some call this sacred steel music, it certainly makes for a joyous sound and if you catch them live their shows are very eclectic, powerful and energetic which is a theme throughout this release.\n\nTen songs with one cover, Pop Staples song, Simple Man, a deep and powerful tune with hypnotic beats. It starts with Baptise Me, a redemption tune, with strong harmonies and rasping vocals.\n\nDon’t Fight It is upbeat. Have Mercy is full of soul and takes the overall sound to another dimension; lyrics are just so real and uplifting. Cut ‘Em Loose is a heavier blues-rock style. Second Hand Man is funky and there are throwbacks to the Staple Singers.\n\nTheir sound is authentic and genuine and none more so than on the haunting Cry Over Me, a highlight, and vocals are superbly sung by Lenesha. I Need You, has beautiful harmonies.\n\nI’m Living Off The Love You Give, has subtle note changes and very catchy. Lastly, Strange Train is hard-rocking blues with a twist, again harmony is the key to this song.\n\nAnother release destined for honours and they are fully deserved. Fantastic sounds and a groove throughout make this very special.\n\nAlbum Review by Colin Campbell"
