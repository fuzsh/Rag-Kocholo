        "text": "Pedal steel guitar virtuoso Robert Randolph cut his teeth playing church services in his native New Jersey before he burst into the musical world of folks like Eric Clapton, Elton John, Carlos Santana, Dave Matthews, Leanne Rhymes, John Mayer and more. How? His red-hot, fervent instrumental work and heartfelt, enthusiastic originals are absolutely phenomenal.\n\nRolling Stone named Randolph one of the “100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time” and he’s earned four Grammy nominations, Blues Music Awards, and more. On TV you might hear his theme songs for the NY Knicks called “Get There,” and NFL Thursday Night Football, with “Ain’t Nothing Wrong With That.”\n\nWhat’s more, he utilizes his passions for humanity to drive meaningful social change. In doing so, he founded the Robert Randolph Foundation, which focuses on creating platforms for youth to gain knowledge and transform their lives regardless of their cultural, social or racial backgrounds. Thank you, Mr. Randolph!!\n\nWe’re absolutely thrilled that he’s bringing his brilliance to our little festival in the hills – be prepared to get smitten!\n\nBut first, get baptized in the spirit of the Robert Randolph Band with the video “Baptise Me”:"
