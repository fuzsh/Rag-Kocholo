        "text": "Few individuals can light up a room like Robert Randolph when he walks in — and that’s nothing compared to what he does when he starts playing music.\n\nAs a virtuoso pedal steel guitarist, Randolph’s got a seemingly unlimited range of sounds at his fingertips. As an artist rooted in gospel, but one that trades in rock, Randolph's message, like his energy, is nothing but affirmative. Joined by his Family Band, Randolph lit up our Bronx studios with a couple of tunes from the group's new album, Brighter Days, which featured soul-stirring vocals from his sister, Neesha.\n\nIn between songs, he spoke about his amazing ride as an artist, from his controversial decision to take his music out of the church — and into clubs — to interacting with the likes of Prince and Eric Clapton.\n\nYou can hear the session at 8 tonight on WFUV or on demand via the player above. Be sure to watch the videos from Studio A and check the band live too. One spot to catch them here in New York is the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture on Friday, September 6.\n\n[Recorded: 7/24/19; Engineer: Jim O'Hara; Producer: Sarah Wardrop]"
