        "text": "I've sen Robert Randolph in many incarnations. The Family Band is great, although they tend to play the same show every time.\n\nFirst of all, if you haven't already, checkout the band called \"The Word\". It is John Medeski (from Medeski, Martin, and Wood), Robert Randolph, and some of the guys from the North Mississippi Allstars. Fantastic stuff.\n\nCheck out Derek Trucks Band, \"Joyful Noise\". Nephew of Butch Trucks of the Allman Bros, he is an incredible guitar player, and this is one of my favorite albums.\n\nhope that helps!\n\n_alan\n\nYou might look up the various artists collection Sacred Steel Live! on Arhoolie. If not that one, go for a Rope-a-dope comp called None But The Righteous. Medeski is credited for \"curating\" the disc, sourced from Arhoolie's artist/disc stable but issued on a Warner group imprint.\n\nTaken as a whole, I love that Campbell Brothers disc. It's called Pass Me Not, and between Katie Jackson's vocals and the way the band plays...relaxed in tempo but incendiary in execution at the same time...I can't get enough of it.\n\nAmazingly, Cracker Barrel carries a good sampler of sacred steel material, with a generous helping from the Campbell Brothers disc.\n\nThe material from the other performers besides Randolph/Family Band tends to more blues-leaning full-on gospel, whereas the Campbell Brothers get almost trance-y in their best moments. Invariably, the songs will start conventionally, if a little restrained, and then the bass cuts some weird little turn about halfway in and they're off!\n\nNot a diss on the other bands at all - there's good stuff there. But where the other bands make you want to find a church where you could at least watch them do their thing, the Campbell Brothers make you want to dance the devil completely away. There's an intensity there that comes right through the disc, and it's powerful stuff."
