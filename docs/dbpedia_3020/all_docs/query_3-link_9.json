        "text": "Robert Randolph grew up playing sacred steel music – gospel played on pedal steel guitar – in the House of God church in Orange, New Jersey, and began taking his joyous, gospel-infused music out to clubs, backed by family members who shared not only backgrounds, but blood.\n\nRobert Randolph & The Family Band first gained national attention with the release of their debut album, Live at the Wetlands, in 2002. The band was able to win a passionate fan base with their tireless touring and unforgettable performances at festivals such as Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits, and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. Randolph’s unprecedented prowess on his instrument garnered him a spot on Rolling Stone’s “100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time” list, and also gained the attention of artists like Eric Clapton, Dave Matthews, The Roots, and Jack White, who have since collaborated with Randolph on stage and in the studio."
