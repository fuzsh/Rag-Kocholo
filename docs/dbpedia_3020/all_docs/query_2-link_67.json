        "text": "Limited 180 gram vinyl LP pressing in gatefold jacket. 2017 release. Pedal-steel virtuoso Robert Randolph returns with Got Soul. The album reaffirms that Randolph and his Family Band have truly evolved into one of the most exciting and innovative outfits in contemporary music. Got Soul takes stock of Randolph's past as a church musician as it pushes the band forward into new places. There is no shortage of originality on the album with songs that run the gamut from gospel numbers to deep, funky grooves to incendiary rock-and-soul jams. The hauntingly exquisite \"Heaven's Calling\" features Randolph on solo steel while guest vocalists Darius Rucker and Anthony Hamilton lend their golden voices to \"Love Do What It Do\" and \"She Got Soul\" respectively. \"I Thank You,\" the 60s Sam & Dave R&B smash, is completely re-imagined in the hands of the Family Band and Snarky Puppy's very on Cory Henry."
