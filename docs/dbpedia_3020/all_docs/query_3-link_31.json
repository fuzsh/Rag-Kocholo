ClutchFans has been bringing fans together to talk Houston Sports since 1996. Join us!\n\nOne of my favorite bands recorded the new theme song for ABC's NBA coverage! Robert Randolph and the Family Band are a great group. He plays pedal steel guitar and they formed out of a church in New Jersey (I think).. Anyway, check these guys out! They are inspiring!\n\nActually, I would classify them as gospel..\n\nhttp://www.artistdirect.com/music/artist/card/0,,1086020,00.html\n\nSorry for the double post. It just cracked me up that anyone would think they are rednecks..\n\nhttp://www.robertrandolph.net/look/thumbs.html?07212001\n\nDude, Robert Randolph and the Family band RULES!!! He is a freaking wizard on that steel guitar. I first heard him on the Bonaroo compilation, and since then he's been popping up all over the place. I haven't yet heard the ABC song -- I'll have to keep my eyes and ears open for it."
