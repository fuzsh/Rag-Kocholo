        "text": "American gospel band\n\nRobert Randolph and the Family Band is an American gospel band led by pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph (Robert Jermaine Randolph, born August 8, 1977, Irvington, New Jersey).[2] NPR has described the band as one with an \"irresistible rock 'n' roll swagger\".[3] Rolling Stone included Randolph upon their list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time.[4] The band has released six studio albums and has been Grammy nominated four times.[5][6]\n\nBand history\n\n[edit]\n\nFrontman Robert Randolph was trained as a pedal steel guitarist in the House of God Church and makes prominent use of the instrument in the band's music. The instrument is referred to in many African-American Pentecostal churches as \"sacred steel\". Randolph was discovered while playing at a sacred steel convention in Florida.[7]\n\nThe group's sound is inspired by funk bands such as Earth, Wind & Fire and Sly & the Family Stone. Randolph himself has explained that in his adolescent years before being discovered by the secular community, he was almost completely unaware of non-religious music. He went on to exclaim in an interview that \"I grew up and saw a lot of older guys playing lap steels and pedal-steel guitars in my church. I had never heard of the Allman Brothers, or even Buddy Guy or Muddy Waters.\"[8]\n\nBefore releasing albums with The Family Band, Randolph was selected by avant-garde jazz organist John Medeski to join him and the North Mississippi Allstars on their 2001 jam project, The Word. Just prior to the release of The Word's debut album, Randolph was brought to the attention of music fans through a review[9] by Neil Strauss in The New York Times in April 2001. On their first non-church tour of the East Coast, Randolph's new Family Band opened for the North Mississippi Allstars and then rejoined the musicians after their set, with Medeski, as The Word.\n\nThe first Robert Randolph and the Family Band album, Live at the Wetlands, was released in 2002 on Family Band Records, recorded live on August 23, 2001, just prior to the club's closing. The band released their studio debut, Unclassified on August 5, 2003. They attracted the attention of Eric Clapton, and have subsequently toured as a supporting act with the English blues guitarist. Clapton later guested on their 2006 album Colorblind, playing on a cover of \"Jesus Is Just Alright\".\n\nIn 2002, they were hired by ABC to make the network's new NBA theme song. The song, \"We Got Hoops\", only appeared in three telecasts, though it was used throughout both the NBA and WNBA seasons during promotions for both leagues. In September 2003 Randolph was listed as No. 97 on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time list. Robert entered the list following Leigh Stephens and directly preceding Angus Young.[4] In February 2004 Robert Randolph and the Family Band along with the band O.A.R. released a cover version of Led Zeppelin's \"Fool in the Rain\", which was made available for online purchase through iTunes. This version was played live with O.A.R. at their June 18, 2009, show at Charter One Pavilion in Chicago.\n\nTheir third album, Colorblind, was released October 10, 2006. The song \"Ain't Nothing Wrong With That\" was used in several commercials for NBC, and used in Katherine Jenkins and Mark Ballas' jive on Dancing with the Stars.[10] In June 2008 the Discovery Channel used this same song in a popular promo entitled \"It's All Good\" for their summer lineup. The song \"Thrill of It\" was used throughout the 2007 college football season by ABC during their College Primetime games.[11]\n\nThey worked with producer T-Bone Burnett on their fourth studio album We Walk This Road, released in 2010. They released the supposed first single from that album entitled \"Get There\" but this song did not appear on the album. The first official single from the album is \"If I Had My Way.\" Randolph used his steel guitar with a wah-wah pedal[12]\n\nTheir 2019 recording, Brighter Days, was chosen as a 'Favorite Blues Album' by AllMusic.[13]\n\nLive appearances\n\n[edit]\n\nThe band made its first television appearance on Late Show with David Letterman on August 5, 2003, performing \"I Need More Love\".\n\nIn 2004, Robert Randolph and the Family Band was the opening act on the Eric Clapton tour. They are featured prominently in the Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival DVD (2004). The band also appears on Bonnaroo Music Festival DVDs. The length of the concerts can vary greatly depending on what songs are played (the band does not use a set list) and how long jams last. Concerts go over the allotted time if the band and the audience are having fun. Most concerts don't have an intermission; instead, band members will exit the stage leaving one or two members a chance to shine with solos. The one time the band does stop is so the band can relax, get hydrated, and plan the encore. On October 9, 2004, Robert Randolph and the Family Band appeared on the PBS television show Austin City Limits.[14]\n\nOn January 24, 2007, they played in Dallas at Victory Plaza outside of the American Airlines Center as part of the 2007 NHL All Star game festivities. The band also played before the start of the 2007 NHL All-Star Game. The Family Band has opened for Dave Matthews Band for some shows on their 2002–09 tours.[15] In 2005 Robert Randolph appeared on the Dave Matthews Band release Weekend on the Rocks. Robert Randolph has performed as a guest during the Dave Matthews Band set on songs such as \"All Along the Watchtower\", \"Louisiana Bayou\", \"Stand Up\", \"Smooth Rider\", \"You Might Die Trying\", and \"Two Step\", among others.\n\nIn 2007, Robert Randolph and the Family Band played at the inaugural South Padre International Music Festival. In 2008, they opened for Eric Clapton and were also one of four featured artists on the Music Builds Tour. Robert Randolph and the Family Band played in Oxford, Mississippi on April 25, 2009, as part of the 14th annual Double Decker Arts Festival. In 2009 Randolph also sat in on two live performances of Led Zeppelin's \"Fool In The Rain\" with the band O.A.R.\n\nAlso, on June 22, 2014, Robert Randolph and the Family Band played at the TD Toronto Jazz Fest, welcoming a new \"cousin\" Andrew Prince to the stage for two songs.[14][16]\n\nRobert Randolph and the Family Band played the 10th annual Rooster Walk Music and Arts Festival in May 2018.[17]\n\nOn July 30, 2022, Robert Randolph and the Family Band opened for Zac Brown Band outside the Soaring Eagle Casino in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan.\n\nIn July, 2024, Robert Randolph and the Family Band are scheduled to perform at FitzGerald's American Music Festival in Berwyn, Illinois.[18]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nGrammy Awards\n\n[edit]\n\n[5]\n\nYear Nominee / work Award Result 2003 \"Squeeze\" Best Rock Instrumental Performance Nominated 2003 Unclassified Best Rock Gospel Album Nominated 2017 Got Soul Best Contemporary Blues Album Nominated 2020 Brighter Days Best Contemporary Blues Album Nominated\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Peak chart positions Label US 200[19] US Rock[20] US Christian[21] US Blues[22] 2003 Unclassified 145 6 Warner Records[23] 2006 Colorblind 75 Warner Records[23] 2010 We Walk This Road 74 21 4 Warner Records[23] 2013 Lickety Split 135 37 Blue Note Records[23] 2017 Got Soul 2 Sony Music[23] 2019 Brighter Days 3 Mascot Label Group / Provogue\n\nLive albums\n\n[edit]\n\nLive at the Wetlands (2002)\n\nLive in Concert (2011)\n\nGuest appearances on albums\n\n[edit]\n\n2001: \"Garden of Love\" and \"Opportunity\" – Demolition String Band on Pulling Up Atlantis\n\n2002: \"Cissy Strut\", \"Ruler of My Heart\" and \"Tell It Like It Is\" – Dirty Dozen Brass Band on Medicated Magic\n\n2004: \"Mas Y Mas\" – Los Lobos on Live at the Fillmore (DVD version)\n\n2004: \"The Good Life\" – Rachael Lampa on Rachael Lampa\n\n2005: \"Crosstown Traffic\" – Soulive on Break Out\n\n2005: \"Exodus\" and \"Louisiana Bayou\" – Dave Matthews Band on Complete Weekend on the Rocks\n\n2005: \"I Am an Illusion\" – Rob Thomas on ...Something to Be\n\n2005: \"I Want to Take You Higher\" – Sly & The Family Stone on Different Strokes by Different Folks\n\n2005: \"Lay Lady Lay\" – Buddy Guy on Bring 'Em In\n\n2005: \"Mission Temple Fireworks Stand\" – Sawyer Brown on Mission Temple Fireworks Stand\n\n2005: \"Oh My Lord\" – Ringo Starr on Choose Love\n\n2005: \"Trinity\" – Santana and Kirk Hammett of Metallica on All That I Am\n\n2005: \"21st Century Schizoid Man\" – Ozzy Osbourne on Under Cover\n\n2008: \"Otherside\" – Third Day on Revelation\n\n2008: \"Out in the Woods\" and \"That's My Home\" – Buddy Guy on Skin Deep\n\n2008: \"Train's A Comin'\" – JD & The Straight Shot on Right On Time\n\n2010: \"There's No Tomorrow\" – Elton John & Leon Russell on The Union\n\n2011: \"Straight Down the Line\" – Robbie Robertson on How to Become Clairvoyant\n\n2015: \"Oh My Lord\" - Randy Bachman on Heavy Blues\n\nGuest singles\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Single Artist Country Chart Album 2004 \"Mission Temple Fireworks Stand\" Sawyer Brown 55 Mission Temple Fireworks Stand\n\nGuest appearances on soundtracks\n\n[edit]\n\n2002: NBA on ABC – \"We Got Hoops\"\n\n2004: ATV Offroad Fury 3 – \"Squeeze\"\n\n2006: NBA Live 07 – \"Thrill of It\"\n\n2007: Grey's Anatomy – \"Ain't Nothing Wrong with That\"\n\n2007: Stomp the Yard – \"Ain't Nothing Wrong with That\"\n\nOther appearances\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1999, Arhoolie Records released Sacred Steel – Live! including performances recorded live in two House of God churches in 1998 and 1999, one of which was Robert Randolph performing \"Without God\".
