        "text": "Robert Randolph is one of the foremost pedal steel guitar players in the world. He and The Family Band will release their eighth album, “Brighter Days” (Provogue/PRV), on Aug. 23. They’ll visit Sellersville Theater on July 17 for what will certainly be an exciting display of musical virtuosity combined with a positive message in their quest to make the world a better place.\n\nRandolph, now 41, grew up in Orange, New Jersey. He and his family were active members of the House of God Church. He began playing drums in his church at age 5 and then switched to pedal steel guitar. He discussed in a telephone interview how he learned the craft and became, according to Rolling Stone magazine, one of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time.\n\n“Well, in our church the pedal steel is the main instrument,” said Randolph, which fueled his desire to switch from drums to playing pedal steel. “Our church organization, which is spread all across the east coast of the United States and in the Midwest – a small Pentecostal organization – it was sort of like the old juke joints on the Chitlin’ Circuit. We had these pioneers that played pedal steel in our church for the last 90 years almost. A guy named Willie Easton started this tradition and I grew up watching all these guys… it was sort of my own Muddy Waters and Jimi Hendrixes and all that growing up at church.”\n\nRandolph added, “Different guys teach you and they show you stuff and you watch them and you listen to the tapes. It’s kind of like listening to old blues tapes.”\n\nBut Randolph didn’t know anything about Muddy Waters or Jimi Hendrix initially. He had a cloistered upbringing and all he knew was church music. And as much as secular music was a secret to Randolph, this music was a secret to those outside these churches for many years.\n\n“Our church’s history in music started to get documented in the mid-1990s,” explained Randolph. “A guy named Bob Stone started to write about it, and he coined it ‘sacred steel music.’ So, we started to have something called a sacred steel convention… and it was the first time in the church’s history that we thought there was (a) wider audience (for the music).”\n\nAround the same time is when Randolph first got exposed to secular music.\n\n“Right around that time in 1998 (I was given) a tape of Stevie Ray Vaughan’s ‘Greatest Hits’ and that was the thing that got me out and playing. (Promoters from the convention) wanted me to sort of get into some different styles of music so I started listening to (Vaughan) and that led me to listening to the Allman Brothers and Albert King and Cream and Derek and the Dominos and a lot of different stuff. So that’s when I started to sort of change my playing, how I was playing the pedal steel, writing songs and doing all these different things.”\n\nIt was at one of these conventions in Orlando, Florida where Randolph was brought to the attention of legendary organ player John Medeski. Medeski invited Randolph to join him and the North Mississippi All-Stars in a project called The Word. They released their eponymous album (Atlantic) in 1991. Publicity around this project led to notoriety for Randolph, who released his debut album with The Family Band, “Live at the Wetlands” (Warner Bros.), the following year.\n\nThis sudden exposure and taking music outside the church initially did not go over well within the church.\n\n“Early on when we were playing in church everybody was sort of disappointed that (we) wanted to take (the music) out into the world. You can keep naming names going back from Sam Cooke to Marvin Gaye to Aretha Franklin, it’s always going to be (an issue) when\n\nyou grew up in church playing music and then you decide to go out and be a recording artist, touring and different things like that. But most of the old people that that felt a certain way either died out… or they saw how we’ve sort of influenced a lot of different younger people and older people with inspirational songs.”\n\nJust as the message from his church remains important in Randolph’s life, so is continuing to play with members of his family.\n\n“It’s important, you know, because we have a vision together and a sound that comes from\n\nour musical history and where we come from in church. It’s kind of a tip of the hat to what we were doing in church, whether it’s a new song, an existing song that we cover, or something else…”\n\nAs for the new album “Better Days,” Randolph said, “it’s joyful, it’s inspirational, and it’s got a lot of great songs with great messages.”\n\nRandolph elaborated: “It’s just a real joyous album for the time that we’re in. To get people to learn to love one another, respect one another, get a sense of spirituality… because for me (I want to) add something that’s going to be a positive light. For me to be able to\n\ninspire (people) to look within ourselves, to all learn to respect, love, and bring joy to one another’s lives, that’s just a part of who I am musically.”"
