        "text": "Robert Randolph & The Family Band have announced their latest studio effort, Brighter Days, due out on Friday, May 31st via Provogue Records. Brighter Days is the follow-up to the band’s 2017 release, Got Soul.\n\nRandolph teamed up with Nashville-based producer Dave Cobb on the new record, who has worked with Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell, and Marcus King to name a few.\n\nRobert Randolph shared his thoughts on the new record in a press release. He explains,\n\nAll of these songs kind of harken back to how we started, to being known as this musical family band that comes from the church and appeals to rock, blues, gospel and soul music audiences. We wanted that good gospel, blues, R&B feel, because that’s where we started and it’s good to not only remind people of that but to actively remember it ourselves. Dave Cobb is just a guy who likes to record good music and good songs. He wanted to do something that was fun but it also gives you a gospel feeling. He knows the history of our band, coming from church and giving that fun church feeling to people.\n\nAhead of Brighter Days‘ late-May release, Robert Randolph & The Family Band have shared their forthcoming album’s lead single, “Second Hand Man”. The new track is layered with elements of classic soul, funk, rock, and blues, highlighted by some electric work by Randolph on the pedal steel. Watch the new animated video for “Second Hand Man” below:\n\nRobert Randolph & The Family Band – “Second Hand Man”\n\n[Video: Robert Randolph and The Family Band]"
