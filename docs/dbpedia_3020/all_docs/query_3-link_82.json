        "text": "STATE COLLEGE – From its humble origins in the hot fields of the Mississippi Delta to big city stages around the nation, blues music always has been about expressing strong emotions – whether it’s wailing in pain or howling with joy.\n\nNowadays, blues festivals provide an opportunity for blues fans to experience the intense emotions of talented musicians firsthand, while sampling creative and fresh variations on the same time-honored musical theme.\n\nLocal blues fans can get a taste of this experience themselves at the Blues Festival with Robert Randolph & The Family Band at 6 p.m. Nov. 14 at the State Theatre, 130 W. College Ave.\n\n“Blues festivals are a phenomenon all over the country that live music fans overwhelmingly support,” said Alex Neil, marketing assistant at the State Theatre. “While they are traditionally outdoor events during the warm summer months, we decided to carry the heat of the music into the winter with an indoor event.”\n\nThis year’s headliner, Robert Randolph & The Family band, is well-known for the intensity of their live performances. Randolph, a virtuoso pedal steel guitarist, recently released a new album called “Lickety Split” and has been listed as one of Rolling Stone’s greatest guitarists of all time.\n\nRandolph performs his funk and soul tunes in the sacred steel tradition of the African-American Pentecostal Church, while his longtime accompanists, The Family Band, back him up with their own talented instrumental performances, sometimes trading instruments during shows to showcase their proficiency.\n\nIn addition to the headliner, the Blues Festival also will showcase a variety of blues music from groups that are well-known locally, regionally and nationally.\n\n“Part of running a live entertainment venue is exposing patrons to new and exciting sights and sounds. Blues Festival plays a big role in that, as blues music in general has an interesting history with many different innovative expressions that lead us up to the present-day styles,” Neil said.\n\nAnother group performing at the festival will be the Jive Bombers, which comprises music history professor Jerry Zolten and phenomenal local harmonica player Richard Sleigh.\n\nThe duo takes a traditional blues approach, striving to recreate the feel of the original blues musicians.\n\nTriple A Blues Band, on the other hand, is known for its “down-home, old-school howlin’-growlin’ blues music,” recalling standards from swing, old folk blues and electric blues. Another Blues Festival act, Felix & The Hurricanes, takes more of a southern rock approach to the blues, with its three-member ensemble having performed on the local music scene for over 20 years.\n\nMelanie Morrison Zeigler, lead singer of Miss Melanie in the Valley Rats, has been known for her powerful, soulful voice and performance of roots, soul and New Orleans-infused grooves. She and her ensemble have shared stages with and jammed alongside B.B. King, Allen Toussaint and The Nighthawks.\n\nA more local group, the Gill Street Band, is a nine-piece ensemble that has been performing throughout Pennsylvania for the past several years, boasting “the hardest working four-piece horn section east of the Mississippi.”\n\nThis will be the second year for the State Theatre’s Blues Festival, with last year’s festival being headlined by JJ Grey & Mofro and featuring other local supporting acts.\n\nThe festival’s organizers are optimistic that this year’s festival will be as successful as the last.\n\n“We want people to call The State Theatre their home for blues music all year ’round,” Neil said.\n\nFor more information or to buy tickets, visit www.thestatetheatre.org."
