        "text": "In 2001, another African-American gospel artist moved into the secular mainstream. Following the path that Sam Cooke, Aretha Franklin, Kirk Franklin and the Winans have taken, Robert Randolph went from playing in churches to performing in clubs. But unlike his predecessors, Randolph didn't cross over as a singer, but as a sacred steel guitar player.\n\nAt the time, few outside the Pentecostal African-American House of God and the Church of the Living God had heard of sacred steel. It's a small musical sect. The instrument is usually associated with the sway of Hawaiian music or the weeping of country. In less than a decade, however, Robert Randolph and his pedal steel style are known by blues, jazz and rock fans around the globe. He plays Greenfield Lake Amphitheater on Friday with his Family Band.\n\nRandolph learned to play the pedal steel guitar in his New Jersey church and was playing for the congregation by the time he turned 9. His family didn't allow him to listen to secular music, but like most teenagers Randolph was open to popular music and sought it out.\n\n\"I was listening to inner city hip-hop and R&B,\" Randolph said during a phone interview. \"Then when I was 17 or 18, I heard Stevie Ray Vaughan and he changed my life.\"\n\nIn the mid-'80s Vaughan came out of Texas playing a potent blend of blues and rock. He quickly became a staple of mainstream rock radio and his albums sold in the millions. He died tragically in a 1990 helicopter crash. Randolph never saw him live, but Vaughan's recordings inspired the pedal steel player as he was developing his own style.\n\n\"I wanted to be like him, playing blues and rock together from the inside of my life,\" Randolph said. \"I'm a fan of the original guys – Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters are my mentors. Stevie Ray Vaughan put a whole new twist on it.\"\n\nListening to Robert Randolph and the Family Band, live or recorded, will not evoke Vaughan, Johnson or Muddy Waters. Rather, he has created a singular pedal steel sound that brings Sly Stone, Jimi Hendrix, a touch of hip-hop and the broad spectrum of blues into the studio and on to the stage. At the music's base, you can hear the gospel.\n\n\"Gospel music and blues are very similar. The only difference is the words you're singing,\" Randolph said. \"Music is all the same voicing, the only change is the lyrics: gospel, Allmans, Hendrix, Led Zeppelin.\"\n\nThough Randolph doesn't mention jazz, it was the adventurous jazz-based rock keyboardist John Medeski who exposed him to a large audience, one that appreciates many genres under the jam band umbrella. Medeski brought Randolph and the North Mississippi Allstars into a band he called The Word, in 2001. It was sacred steel instrumental music – some traditional tunes, some original – that had an improvised, experimental edge.\n\n\"Medeski had a very different style but it was a fit right away because he is such an A1 musician and composer,\" Randolph said.\n\nOn their first East Coast tour, Randolph and his new Family Band opened for the North Mississippi Allstars. Since then, the group has toured with Eric Clapton and Dave Matthews and been on the bill with many other artists. In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine listed Randolph as one of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.\n\nOne aspect of gospel that is always with Randolph and his performances with the Family Band (which includes sister Lanesha Randolph singing lead and backup and his cousin, Danyel Morgan, on bass, guitars and vocals) are revivals. The energy is immediate, as if the group is testifying. The power is positive, whether they are playing originals, Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean,\" Curtis Mayfield's \"People Get Ready\" or Hendrix's \"Voodoo Child.\" And the musicianship is sublime.\n\n\"My background is about bringing joy to yourself and everyone else, even if you're feeling down,\" Randolph said. \"Fans say it feels like being at a rock ‘n' roll show and in church at the same time. It's great to be able to do that.\"\n\nRandolph and the Family Band's current tour will feature tunes from his upcoming release \"Lickety Split,\" which will be available starting July 16. The set of originals includes \"New Orleans,\" a hip-hop soul tune made languidly romantic by the pedal steel. \"Love Rollercoaster\" is a funky, feel-good tune a la Sly and the Family Stone.\n\nWith a distorted opening and ending, a heavy beat and loose instrumentation, \"All American\" sounds like a Widespread Panic tune. Lyrically, it's an anthem for a guy from a small Southern town, \"Halfway civilized, halfway buck wild,\" Randolph sings.\n\nThe songwriter finds nothing post modern or even surprising about the song.\n\n\"I spend so much time down South they call me the chocolate cowboy,\" Randolph said with a laugh. \"Now there may be a song about that sometime.\"\n\nThat's possible, because Robert Randolph is fresh, still growing and bringing the gospel into the secular. That melting of barriers is one of the forces that has defined American popular music for most of the past century. It is what makes the music a religion.\n\nFeatures: 343-2343\n\nWho: Robert Randolph and the Family Band, with Big Something When: 6 p.m. gates, 7 p.m. show, Friday, May 10 Where: Greenfield Lake Amphitheater, 1941 Amphitheater Drive, Wilmington Tickets: $25 in advance, $30 day of show.
