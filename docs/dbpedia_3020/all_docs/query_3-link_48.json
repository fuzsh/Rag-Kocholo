While Randolph cut his teeth playing in services at the House of God Church in his native New Jersey (a domination where the pedal steel is a key part of the musical program), his talents were discovered by fans outside the church, and he made his debut with a live album recorded with his backing group the Family Band, 2001's Live at the Wetlands, that mixed gospel and full-bodied rock and blues. Randolph's first studio set, 2003's Unclassified, broadened the scope of his repertoire with flashes of funk and Caribbeansounds. His subsequent albums with the Family Band, such as 2010's When We Walk This Road (produced by T-Bone Burnett) and 2013's Lickety Split, were steeped in passion and energy that came from their heartfelt fusion of multiple genres."
