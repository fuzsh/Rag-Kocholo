        "text": "A-J ENTERTAINMENT EDITOR\n\nLubbock music fans may well be in for a treat when Robert Randolph & The Family Band takes the stage Friday at City Bank Coliseum. That said, any number of fans already may be surprised to find Randolph opening for country music favorite The Zac Brown Band.\n\nRandolph is many things - multi-cultural, rock, soul and funk among them - but he hasn't been labeled country, even if does play steel guitar to the level that Rolling Stone calls him \"one of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time.\"\n\nTaking time to give another interview right before his appearance on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon,\" Randolph, 30, said that he and headliner Zac Brown are linked by one word.\n\nRoots.\n\nRandolph said, \"I think people will appreciate an opportunity to see two artists who play American roots music. (The number of concert performers jumped to three when Oliver Wood was added to the bill on Sept. 9.) Whether those roots lie in country or blues or funk or even if you're a jam band, it doesn't matter.\n\n\"It shows when artists understand roots music.\"\n\nWhat sets Grammy Award nominee Randolph apart is that he was aware of very little secular music when he began playing. Indeed, Randolph's sound was born within the African-American Pentecostal ensemble called the House of God Church, where music is anchored by the steel guitar.\n\nThe instrument is, in fact, referred to as Sacred Steel, and Randolph, 30, was discovered while playing at a sacred steel convention in Florida.\n\nRespected producer and steel guitarist Lloyd Maines, e-mailing from Austin, shared what he has learned about \"Sacred Steel,\" saying that steel guitar \"is used in their churches like an organ or piano is used in conventional church music. When a player is learning to play steel, the main thing they try to do and are judged on, is making the steel sound like a woman's singing voice. You can hear that in every Sacred player I've heard. ...\n\n\"Robert came out of that New York Sacred scene. He has taken it into the mainstream, and I think it is a good thing. He and his Family Band take it to the edge every time they do a show.\"\n\nRandolph said, \"I grew up watching all the older guys playing pedal steel in church and, to tell the truth, I just wanted to be good enough to play like them. There have been great musicians playing steel in the House of God since the early 1900s.\"\n\nBut Randolph's music expanded, becoming something closer to an original sound \"after we got out and started playing the clubs,\" he said.\n\n\"That's when we knew we had something different, even though how we played and arranged music was because of our Pentecostal backgrounds.\"\n\nThe band's first album, \"Live at the Wetlands,\" was recorded on Aug. 23, 2001, and released on Family Band Records. One recording was all it took to gain the attention of major record labels.\n\nAnd seeing this family band live was all it took to impress other acts. Robert Randolph & The Family Band soon were opening for The Dave Matthews Band and The Allman Brothers.\n\nRandolph said, \"The head of Warner Bros. knew from day-one that he wanted me to meet up with Eric Clapton. But our schedules were off until finally, when we were both in Japan, Eric had a day off and came out to see us play.\n\n\"We've been real close ever since, even when we're not touring together.\"\n\nRandolph & The Family Band has toured with Clapton and was granted generous camera time on Clapton's \"Crossroads Guitar Festival 2004\" DVD.\n\nEven those who have not seen Robert Randolph & The Family Band in concert may have heard more than its hits. The band wrote and recorded \"We Got Hoops\" for the NBA and WNBA in 2002. \"Thrill of It\" was used throughout the 2007 ABC college football season, and by the NBA. And the band's hit \"Ain't Nothing Wrong With That\" was heard within promotions on NBC and the Discovery Channel.\n\nThe same tunes also have been heard in programs ranging from \"Grey's Anatomy\" to \"Malcolm in the Middle.\"\n\nLive performances occasionally find Randolph surprising fans with his own take on songs by Led Zeppelin, Prince, Michael Jackson or Jimi Hendrix, to name a few.\n\nConcert promoter Gary Boren pointed out that Randolph has been cast as Bo Diddley in the movie \"Who Do You Love?\"\n\nRandolph believes that his band's big break was \"a combination of everything. It was because we were traveling and being seen in so many places, because I'm a sports fan, because we wound up being loved by bands playing music in many different genres.\n\n\"It's really because the music we play is for people of all ages, all races, all creeds.\"\n\nEven diehard fans who dig the band's recordings may be surprised by live performances. Randolph said dance always plays a major role in his performance. In fact, he has stepped away from his sacred steel long enough to dance in mid-song.\n\nWomen have been encouraged to dance, even on stage - and woe to the audience that can't feel, and express, the beat.\n\nRandolph has even stopped shows if audiences are not dancing, He said, \"It even happened last night. We were playing at a theater and people would applaud after songs, but seemed to be sitting on their hands. I'm not sure if they felt they had to act that way because it was a theater. But I stopped everything and took the microphone and I told them, 'People, get on up because we're going to be breaking a few rules here tonight.' \"\n\nThe emphasis was on fun more than work while Randolph was preparing to record his newest album, \"We Walk This Road.\"\n\nA Los Angeles Times' music critic has since written, \"Since Robert Randolph's been making his joyful noise, the distance between heaven and Earth has measurably narrowed.\"\n\nOr from the Wall Street Journal: \"By assimilating his influences to come up with his own sound, Mr. Randolph in 'We Walk This Road' has given us something that already feels timeless.\"\n\nSeeking a new producer, Randolph considered such big names as Rick Rubin, Ry Cooder and Daniel Lanois. He finally hooked up with Fort Worth native T BoneBurnett.\n\n\"What T Bone told me was that, by the time we finish this record, people were going to be talking about it, and singing the songs from it, for decades to come,\" said Randolph. \"This is our Bob Dylan record - and by that I mean people did not classify or pigeonhole Dylan. He wasn't rock or country or folk or jazz. He just wrote great songs.\"\n\nRandolph wanted to make \"a great record,\" and Burnett taught him the value of research and archival music. Working together, they looked over a century of African-American music and found uplifting songs from the public domain: rock, blues, field recordings and gospel.\n\nAn almost endless stream of curious musicians dropped in, from Dylan and Robert Plant to Leon Russell and Allison Krauss. Randolph's Family Band ended up recording 40 songs, far more than what was needed. But visitors joined discussions and comparisons inspired by the music.\n\nLeon Russell (\"Salvation\"), Ben Harper (\"If I Had My Way\"), Jim Keltner (Dylan's \"Shot of Love\") and Doyle Bramhall II (John Lennon's \"I Don't Want to Be a Soldier, Mama\") are just a few who actually sat in as songs were recorded, making guest appearances.\n\nMeanwhile, days kept slipping by.\n\n\"Colorblind\" came out in October 2006. The Burnett-produced \"We Walk This Road\" was not released until June of this year. That's almost an unheard of four-year gap. How did that happen?\n\nRandolph, telling me his time was up as he was being pulled away for the Fallon progran, explained, \"After I started working with T Bone, it just got to be so much fun. People were coming by almost every day: Robbie Robertson, Dylan, everybody coming by and talking music.\n\n\"Finally, it hit me that we have got to finish some of these songs. We just got so far into rehearsals and we needed to finish some songs. We recorded 40 and we needed to make an album. At the same time, T Bone was telling me, 'Everyone wants to be a part of this. Even young artists are getting into the old songs.' \"\n\nTo comment on this story:\n\nwilliam.kerns@lubbockonline.com • 766-8712\n\nshelly.gonzales@lubbockonline.com • 766-8747"
