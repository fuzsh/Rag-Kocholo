        "text": "Robert Randolph and the Family Band are back with a new album called Brighter Days, which was produced by Dave Cobb. Randolph chose Cobb for his work with newer country stars like Chris Stapleton and Sturgill Simpson.\n\n“Dave Cobb is just a guy who likes to record good music and good songs,” says Randolph. “He wanted to do something that was fun but it also gives you a gospel feeling. He knows the history of our band, coming from church and giving that fun church feeling to people.”\n\nRandolph’s band is aptly named: each member is a relative of his. That includes bassist Danyel Morgan, who helps to deepen the groove with blues, gospel, and R&B lines. Check out his playing on “Second Hand Man”:\n\nBrighter Days is available now on CD, vinyl and as a digital download (iTunes and Amazon MP3).\n\nBrighter Days Track List:"
