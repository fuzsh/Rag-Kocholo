        "text": "Back @ 2000, steel guitar wizard Robert Randolph’s Family Band burst onto the scene. He was touted as the next guitar hero. And based on what I remember when I saw him live, he was!\n\nAt that time, he was playing everywhere. Every venue and summer festival. Sitting in with other bands. Several albums and TV appearances. His pedal steel guitar chops were just incredible. Rolling Stone cited him as one of the best guitarists of all time.\n\nNowadays, Randolph seemed to have disappeared. Is he still active in the music business? What happened?\n\nI recently dug out a few of his CDs that I haven’t played in decades. Gotta spin them and remember how good of a musician he was/is. Try to ponder why his career ultimately did not take off.\n\nRobert Randolph\n\nHere's his website.\n\nSeems like he keeps busy.\n\nI think that what a lot of people got from the robust jam band scene of the 00's they now get\n\nelsewhere - perhaps events that are more rave like, perhaps more electronic. Which is not to say\n\nthe jam band scene isn't alive, it is just not thriving as it was 20 years ago.\n\nA small piece of that may have been YouTube. Such phenomenal, hot shot musicians all over the platform - I think some fans may have realized that small doses of hot shot playing go a long way, and they just watch these performances on YouTube, and skip the concerts.\n\nGot about as big as seemed likely given that he never really made a mark as a singer or songwriter or partnered with someone who did. And throw in that pedal steel is a much less popular instrument in rock circles than guitar.\n\nHe can sure jam out nicely on his instrument but that rarely makes one a rock superstar on its own. That's why Steve Morse has settled into life as a hired gun in Deep Purple.\n\nYeah there’s another one. Grace Potter. she hasn’t done anything all year, I wonder what happened to her.\n\nummm.\n\nIsn’t there a current situation\n\nwith a worldwide Pandemic....\n\n????\n\nKinda hinders all touring, gigging musicians.....\n\nA couple of years ago he did \"Symphony on the Prairie\" here in Indianapolis which is generally relegated to older cover bands and acts like the Beach Boys. But it was awesome. I don't think that marked a decline in his career so much as the venue trying to think outside the box a bit.\n\nI was in B&N the other day and saw his new album on display.\n\nLastly, going back a few years, I saw RR in a bar setting and it remains the single loudest musical experience I have ever had. Pretty sure he owes me for some hearing loss!\n\nAlso, I would thank this thread for making me look up if there had been any follow-up to \"The Word\" which was released in 2001. There is! I will have to check out the 2015 follow-up and the original is highly recommended.\n\nThe Word (5)\n\nI don’t think Mr. Randolph considers himself or endeavors to be a “ rock superstar”........,,,whatever that term means in this day and age...\n\nHe seems to have been releasing albums every couple of years and touring very steadily right up until the early part of this year. I don't think he went anywhere. I think you just stopped paying attention to him. All he did was stop being new.\n\nNever heard of him.\n\nIf I don't have any interest in a thread or have nothing to contribute, I move along. I would consider it ill mannered of me if I gratuitously dumped on a topic of interest to a fellow SHF member.\n\nAs I write this, there are six other SHF members viewing the thread so not \"pointless\" to others.\n\nMake that 7"
