        "text": "Robert Randolph Band will take the Fifth Third Bank Center Stage on Fountain Square on Sunday, June 23rd with Lauren Eylise and The Perfect Children!\n\nA virtuoso on the pedal steel guitar, Robert Randolph burst onto the music scene in the early 2000’s with his fiery, passionate instrumental work and heartfelt music. It didn’t take long for Robert’s talents to get in front of numerous guitar legends, including Eric Clapton. Upon first listen, Clapton tapped Robert Randolph & the Family Band to tour the world opening for his band and include him in every iteration of the legendary Crossroads Festival. Clapton would also appear on Robert Randolph’s album Colorblind released in 2006 on Warner Music, a record that would also include a guest appearance from Dave Matthews.\n\nRobert’s innovative approach to the pedal steel guitar has earned him four Grammy nominations, multiple Blues Music Awards, a BMI award, and Rolling Stone named Randolph one of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.” His work can be heard on numerous TV and film broadcasts, including his long-standing theme song for the New York Knicks “Get There,” and “Ain’t Nothing Wrong With That,” the current theme song for NFL Thursday Night Football.\n\nSunday, June 23rd\n\nRobert Randolph Band - 8p\n\nThe Perfect Children - 7p\n\nLauren Eylise - 6p\n\nBe sure to visit a nearby restaurant for dinner before the show!
