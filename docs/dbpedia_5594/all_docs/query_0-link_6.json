Jordan has made his transition into Heaven,” she continued. “As my mom says, He fought a good fight and finished his race, with a smile on his face he picked up his crown at Heaven’s Gate!”\n\nSidora, 38, then thanked everyone for sharing their personal stories of caring for a loved one who has Alzheimer’s, a type of dementia that affects memory, thinking and behavior, per the Alzheimer’s Association.\n\n“I was a Daddy’s Girl and I will cherish the precious memories that will forever live in my heart and his legacy lives forever!” she added.\n\nThe “Game” alum said that Dr. Jordan was “the best pediatrician in all of Chicago” and “was passionate about helping people, saving lives and providing quality healthcare to those in the indigent community.”\n\nSidora concluded her post by thanking everyone for their condolences and asking them to keep her family in their prayers as they continue to grieve.\n\n“I thank God, knowing we will see you Daddy again!” she wrote.\n\nSeveral Bravolebrities sent their condolences to Sidora in the comments section of her post.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“I’m praying for strength for you and your family. 🙏🏾,” co-star Kandi Burruss commented.\n\n“😢😢😢 my prayers to your family during this time. 🙏🏾,” Kenya Moore added.\n\n“Sending you and your family prayers and love 🤍🕊️,” “Real Housewives of Potomac” star Dr. Wendy Osefo wrote.\n\n“I’m so sorry! I will Pray for you and your family 😞💔🙏🏾,” “RHOA” alum Porsha Williams said.\n\nShamea Morton told Sidora to let her know if there was anything she could do to help her and her family during this “difficult time,” while Dr. Contessa Metcalfe wrote, “❤️❤️❤️.”\n\nIn the midst of Sidora’s family tragedy, she is going through a divorce with her estranged husband, Ralph Pittman.\n\nThe “That’s So Raven” alum and the Call Me Daddy in the Kitchen founder both filed for divorce — 61 minutes apart — on Feb. 27 after nine years of marriage.\n\nThey share son Machai, 8, and daughter Aniya, 5.
