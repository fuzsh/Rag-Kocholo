        "text": "Fool Me Twice... I'm the Damn Fool\n\nAfter Melanie agrees to go out to dinner with Derwin, he decides to plan a surprise proposal with the help of R&B singer Musiq Soul Child. Things take a turn for the worse when Melanie sees Derwin kissing Drew at the Music Video Awards. Assuming that she has been fooled again by Derwin, an intoxicated Melanie decides to get payback and tries to sleep with Malik. Wendy Raquel Robinson, Coby Bell and Brittany Daniel also star.\n\nBaby B.S.\n\nKelly is happy when she finds out Jason wants to have another baby. But when Tasha offers her a job at her management firm, Kelly has a quick change of heart.\n\nOut of Bounds\n\nWhen Malik finds out that the love of his life, model/actress Eva Marcelle is getting married, he decides to use up-and-coming singer Drew Sidora to make Eva jealous. Learning that she has been used, Drew turns to Derwin as a shoulder to cry on.\n\nThe Many Lies of Derwin in Davis\n\nWhen Derwin is unexpectedly forced to take Melanie to singer Drew Sidora's video release party, he panics over how the meeting between them is going to turn out. Kelly and Tasha continue to grow in their work relationship, while Tasha has trouble finding new clients.\n\nExposure\n\nJack and the team look for a paparazzo after he vanishes from a celebrity shoot, and his camera is found covered in blood. They learn that the free-lance photographer, Brian Owen (John Pankow - Mad About You), was seriously questioning his profession after a minor celebrity he photographed in a compromising position committed suicide. Upon discovering that Owen has also been taking pictures for a controversial environmental group, Jack and the other investigators try to determine who was most threatened by Brian's shots--an enraged star or an industrialist who causes pollution."
