        "text": "Some say if you are around someone long enough you may start to look like them.\n\nWell “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” star Drew Sidora has her followers thinking that she’s starting to look like her cast member and friend Porsha Williams.\n\nSidora recently advertised for a shapewear brand called DaintyBabe, where she flaunted her body in one of the brand’s pieces. In the promotion, Sidora changed up her look a bit ditching her long tresses for a short bob.\n\nBesides her busty chest, which became more pronounced because of the shapewear, Sidora’s eyes had a seductive appearance after an extra dark liner was used on them, and she wore a subtle brown lip gloss. The mother of three has three promo pics uploaded to her page currently; two of them were taken inside a house, and the last one outside.\n\nIn the house photos she only tagged the company and the photographer but in the balcony shot she wrote, “When you feel good on the inside’ it shows on the outside ✨.”\n\nWhile many fans swooned over Sidora’s beautiful looks in the shots, others expressed thoughts that the singer-actress looked like others besides herself.\n\nSeveral noted that she looked like Williams. “Shes morphing into Porsha,” said one person, while another wrote, “I thought this was Porsha for a second dang Drew.” But Williams isn’t the only one fans think Sidora resembles.\n\nSomeone else said, “Chile why did I think this was KMichelle.” Others thought that Sidora’s hairstyle mimicked her co-star Kandi Burruss’ mom’s hair. “Mama Joyce wig” said one person. The signature style of Burruss’ mom, Joyce Jones, is a bob with bangs, like Sidora’s hair in the photos. Another person thought she had another motive saying, “She trying to get that peach.” A peach is what officially establishes you as a full-time housewife on the show instead of a guest/friend of the show.\n\nOther than that, fans are concerned about whether Sidora will be back for a 14th season. Right now, it’s up in the air whether she among several other cast members like Cynthia Bailey, LaToya Ali, and Williams will be returning. Ali and Sidora were newcomers last season."
