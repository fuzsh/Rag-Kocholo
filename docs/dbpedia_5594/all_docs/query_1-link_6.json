        "text": "Abdullah I (born 1882, Mecca—died July 20, 1951, Jerusalem) was a statesman who became the first ruler (1946–51) of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\n\nAbdullah, the second son of Hussein ibn Ali, the ruler of the Hejaz, was educated in Istanbul in what was then the Ottoman Empire. After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, he represented Mecca in the Ottoman parliament. Early in 1914 he joined the Arab nationalist movement, which sought independence for Arab territories in the Ottoman Empire. In 1915–16 he played a leading role in clandestine negotiations between the British in Egypt and his father that led to the proclamation (June 10, 1916) of the Arab Revolt against the Ottomans.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nUnderstanding the Ottoman Empire\n\nOn March 8, 1920, the Iraqi Congress, an organization of questionable legitimacy, proclaimed Abdullah constitutional king of Iraq. But he declined the Iraqi throne, which was given to his brother Faisal I, whom French troops had driven out of Damascus a year earlier (July 1920). Upon Faisal’s ascent to the throne, Abdullah occupied Transjordan and threatened to attack Syria. He gradually negotiated the legal separation of Transjordan from Britain’s Palestine mandate."
