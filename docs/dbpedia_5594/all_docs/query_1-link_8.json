        "text": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_(Katie_Price)\n\nKatie Price (born 22 May 1978), previously known under the pseudonym Jordan, is an English media personality, author, former glamour model, occasional singer and businesswoman.\n\nHer time at topless female glamour model pictorial Page Three in British tabloid newspaper The Sun instantly shot Price into the limelight. Her placement in the public's spotlight has allowed Price to expand into a variety of different industries including television, books, fashion and music.\n\nPrice has experienced many highly-publicised relationships in the eye of the British media and has been married twice, to singer Peter Andre in 2005 - the couple divorced in 2009 - and to professional fighter Alex Reid in 2010; the couple separated in 2011."
