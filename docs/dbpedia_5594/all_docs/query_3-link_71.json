        "text": "Agree to disagree?\n\nIn this exclusive clip from Sunday, Dec. 13's all-new The Real Housewives of Atlanta, Drew Sidora confronts her husband, Ralph Pittman, about his secretive behavior. The new Housewife calls out her spouse after an unexpected speech about his legacy.\n\n\"I came from nothing,\" Ralph starts off the conversation. \"I'm the first generation where I'm trying to create what a true legacy looks like.\"\n\nWhen Drew assures her husband \"that's why [she] married [him],\" Ralph gets heated and accuses his wife of cutting him off.\n\n\"I'm actually agreeing with you,\" Drew notes. \"We're like here, we're communicating.\"\n\nIn response, Ralph states, \"If we really were here, we wouldn't have these problems.\"\n\nNot appreciating Ralph's comment, Drew tells her husband to \"turn down.\"\n\n\"See, I knew this was a set-up,\" she continues. \"We still haven't addressed the issuesâ€¦I'm not asking for much.\"\n\nAt this point, Drew calls out Ralph for leaving without telling her where he was going.\n\n\"What planet you can leave the house and you're married, and you can't tell your wife where you're going, where you are,\" she expresses. \"Like, that's crazy.\"\n\nAccording to Ralph, he was \"always accessible.\"\n\nWhen Drew demands answers, Ralph says he went to the beach, but won't share specifics about the location.\n\n\"Where? There's a beach in all different states,\" Drew counters. \"Were you out of Georgia? Did you leave Georgia?\"\n\nRalph confesses, \"Absolutely.\"\n\nOne last time, Drew asks Ralph where he went.\n\nShe concludes, \"If you don't feel like you need to tell me where you went, then we can dead end it right there.\"\n\nWatch the heated scene in the exclusive clip below."
