        "text": "Oh boy. It looks like there’s some mess unfolding with the cast of Real Housewives of Atlanta. Porsha Williams and Drew Sidora seem to have unfollowed each other on Instagram.\n\nEverybody knows that an Instagram unfollow is the universal sign of distress in a Housewives friendship, so we’re sitting here scratching our heads trying to figure out what exactly happened.\n\nWho unfollowed who?\n\nThe last time we saw Drew and Porsha together on RHOA, they were in a good place. As Drew navigated her divorce from Ralph Pittman, Porsha publicly offered kind words of support. So what happened?\n\nTo be clear, we don’t know for sure that Porsha and Drew are going through something right now, but all the signs are there. In addition to unfollowing each other, Drew has been dropping cryptic little posts on Instagram. It’s like she’s trying to tell us something.\n\nFor example, in one post she wrote, “I grew out of calling everyone my “friend”. Some people are just cool. Hi & Bye.” In another caption, she added, “I’m really in my calm era. I’m not moved by anything or anyone.”\n\nMeanwhile, Porsha hasn’t hinted at any drama outside of the unfollowing Drew. Admittedly, her mind is probably a little occupied by her messy divorce. She can’t even film RHOA inside of her house, so a feud with Drew should be the least of her concerns.\n\nThe news of Porsha and Drew potentially feuding is just the latest in what has been a chaotic production process for Season 16. Porsha’s estranged husband has been threatening the producers with litigation. Kenya Moore walked away from the show midway through the season after a shocking allegation of engaging in revenge porn. Things are spicy right now in Atlanta, and we’re kind of terrified to see what happens next.\n\nTELL US – ARE YOU SURPRISED PORSHA AND DREW UNFOLLOWED EACH OTHER ON INSTAGRAM? DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE ENDED THEIR FRIENDSHIP?"
