The pair wed in 2014 and share son Machai, 6, and daughter Aniya, 4, and parent son Josiah, 11, from a previous relationship of Sidora’s.\n\nAccording to reports, LeBron James and his wife, Savannah James, 35, were high school sweethearts. The two got married in 2013 and share three children together — Bronny, 17, Bryce, 14, and Zhuri, 7.\n\nToday (June 13th), Drew’s sister took to social media, confirming that her sister and Lebron James did in fact date.
