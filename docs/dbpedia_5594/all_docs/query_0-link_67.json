        "text": "Drew Sidora has been rethinking some of her friendships on RHOA.\n\n“Real Housewives of Atlanta” star Drew Sidora is having an interesting season. In fact, she’s not only clashing with Ralph Pittman, but she’s been clashing with Kandi Burruss and Marlo Hampton, too. Marlo and Kandi along with Kenya Moore have been telling Drew she kissed LaToya Howard on the night of the Bolo drama. Drew said she’s being lied on. Kandi took this personally because she doesn’t like being labeled as a liar. So they have been going back and forth about this. Kandi even said things only worsened between them at the reunion during a recent interview. Bravo has since released the first trailer for the reunion.\n\nIn the video, a lot of insults were tossed around. Sheree Whitfield even got into it with Kandi at one point.\n\nKandi says, “You always talk about shots.”\n\nSheree stood up to say, “**** yeah. Let me stand up, honey because you could never!” Kandi then responded, “You put all the shots in your face!”\n\nMarlo Hampton was put on blast.\n\nKenya made a very interesting revelation about her ongoing divorce/custody battle with Marc Daly. Apparently, Marlo’s name and number came up in his court documents.\n\n“It’s a little thing called discovery. Her phone number appears in Marc’s phone records. You will have to appear in court. Here is your subpoena.”\n\nMimi Faust‘s ex Ty Young was also discussed. As we reported, Mimi caused a stir on social media when she accused Drew of messing around with Ty. Apparently, someone sent Sheree’s alleged text messages that were exchanged between Ty and Drew.\n\nAfter Drew confirms she attended Ty’s WNBA game in Texas, Sheree says, “I was given some information. It just paints a different picture.”\n\nAndy Cohen reads the messages, “These are private messages between Ty and Drew. They’re very incriminating.”\n\nKandi watches it all unfold and comes to the conclusion that Drew gaslights Ralph.\n\n“But the way you just sat here and lied on this **** chair, I for sure feel like you’ve been gaslighting Ralph.”\n\nDrew Sidora’s sister has a heated exchange with Courtney Rhodes.\n\nWhen Courtney Rhodes visits Ralph in his dressing room, she gets into it with Drew’s older sister Allison Jordan. Allison asks, “You calling me a *****?”\n\nCourtney answers, “I did.”\n\nA very heated Allison then made reference to Courtney previously saying she couldn’t have called Drew the B word because she doesn’t use the word.\n\n“Oh you don’t use the word ***** though.”\n\nRalph eventually appears on the stage with Andy and Drew for their one-on-one segment. Drew shows Andy some text messages of her own. And she claims these texts are from a conversation Ralph had with another woman.\n\nAndy says, “It said are you going to bring me back that ****?”"
