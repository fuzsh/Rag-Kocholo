        "text": "Synopsis\n\nAfter several years of marriage, the couple has decided to go separate ways. Ralph Pittman is said to have filed for the divorce.\n\nAfter being together for almost nine years, Drew Sidora and Ralph Pittman have decided to end their marriage. According to court documents obtained by a media outlet on March 1, Pittman filed for divorce from 'The Real Housewives of Atlanta' star on February 27, citing their date of separation as February 23 and stating that there is no possibility of reconciliation.\n\nSidora and Pittman got married in 2014 and have two children together, Machai and Aniya. When Sidora joined the cast of 'The Real Housewives of Atlanta' in 2020, she shared how a brief separation from her husband led them to seek marriage counseling.\n\nIn December 2020, during her debut on season 13 of the show, Sidora spoke with Us Weekly about the unexpected separation, saying that her husband left for three days and she didn't know where he was. She also shared that her mother witnessed the events unfold.\n\nThroughout the season, viewers saw Sidora and Pittman work on the issues in their marriage that they had previously put on the back burner, and have the hard conversations that they were forced to have due to their situation.\n\nAlthough Sidora and Pittman reconciled after their separation, their relationship was once again in the spotlight during season 14 of the same show. In one episode, Sidora revealed that she had discovered inappropriate texts between her husband and his assistant, which led her to pack up her children and leave for Chicago.\n\nViewers watched as the couple tried to work through their issues, including ongoing counseling sessions.\n\nIn May 2022, Sidora spoke to Us Weekly about their marriage, saying that they were still in counseling and that their relationship was not always easy. She acknowledged that as they grow together each year, they learn new things about each other. Sidora also explained that their struggles were a reflection of the reality of marriage, and that their ups and downs were something that people who knew them were aware of. She also recalled how the couple had once \"made a decision to stay committed\" at one phase of life.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhen did Ralph Pittman and Drew Sidora get married?\n\nAugust 2014\n\nHow many children does Drew Sidora have?\n\nThree; Josiah, Machai and Aniya.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
