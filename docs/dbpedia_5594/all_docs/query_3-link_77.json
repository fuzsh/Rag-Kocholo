        "text": "Family Feud is a great way to find out how many real people agree with your opinions. And who says only the contestants on the TV show can join the fun? We have just the thing to help you play your own version of the game at home.\n\nBefore you start, here's a refresher on the rules of Family Feud.\n\nTwo teams compete to guess the most popular answers to specific survey questions. Each answer has a certain point value (listed here in parenthesis after each answer) depending on how many people out of 100 gave that answer. Each question has four to eight answer options, and the first team to reach 300 points wins.\n\nAll of these questions and answers have actually appeared on the show, and you can use them to host your next game night. Just remember that this is NOT a quiz. In order to play the game with this template, one of you will have to be Steve Harvey and ask the questions/reveal the answers.
