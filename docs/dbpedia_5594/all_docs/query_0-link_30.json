        "text": "ATLANTA, GEORGIA: Dr Robert A Jordan's death has left Drew Sidora in grief. 'The Real Housewives of Atlanta' star mourned the death of her father on Instagram on August 15.\n\nDrew talked about her struggles after missing Aaron Ross' 40th birthday celebration due to a \"family emergency.\"\n\nDrew came home to her then-husband Ralph Pittman, sons Josiah \"Jojo\" and Machai, and daughter Aniya, in Episode 2 of 'RHOA' Season 15, which aired May 14.\n\n\"I've been going through it with my dad,\" Drew confessed to Ralph regarding the aforementioned emergency in the episode.\n\nShe said, “I think I’ve been pretty strong through it, but literally, when I go back to Chicago, it’s like, ‘Oh, wow, Daddy’s in a nursing home… He’s in a wheelchair,’ which is still so crazy to me that my dad’s in a wheelchair because when he went in, he was still walking.”\n\nWho is 'RHOA' star Drew Sidora's father?\n\nDr Jordan served children in south suburban neighborhoods for over 35 years, providing routine check-ups, immunizations, and essential medical consultations in an area where private practice pediatricians were few.\n\n\"He dedicated his life to taking care of those who were indigent who would not get the love and care usually given to people with means,\" his wife, Rev Jeanette Jordan, said.\n\nDr Jordan, 75, was born and raised in Laurel, Mississippi, and claimed he was inspired to become a doctor at a young age because his younger sister died from asthma problems that might not have occurred if his poor family had access to better health care.\n\nBut it wasn't until Dr Jordan was married with three children that he decided to return to Rush Medical College and acquire his medical degree.\n\nAfter finishing his residency, he established a private practice in Chicago's Roseland neighborhood, then relocated to Homewood and finally to Chicago Heights, where it had been for 17 years until his retirement in 2017.\n\nMoreover, Dr Jordan and his wife founded the Far South Side Community Health Center in 1992, which provides health education, food for the needy, mentorship, and other services.\n\nDr Jordan and his wife intended to travel after his retirement, and she would continue to conduct pastoral work with her church, Journey to the Cross Ministries. He also planned to keep helping at the Far South Side Community Health Center.\n\nWhat happened to Drew Sidora's father?\n\nDrew's father had Alzheimer's disease, as she revealed in an interview on the May 14 episode of 'RHOA'. She was also concerned about her mother's reaction to the fact that he was in a nursing home.\n\n\"Of course, as a family, we worry about my mom too, and her strength,\" Drew explained. \"It’s just a lot on us right now. It was really important for me to be there for them.\"\n\nThough Drew first had a \"breakdown\" when she met her father in person in Chicago, she remarked that as her mother came, he began to recognize her more. She also stated that he responded positively when she played him her new song.\n\n'RHOA' star Drew Sidora mourns the loss of her father\n\nDrew is mourning the loss of her father, Dr Jordan, due to Alzheimer's disease. The 'RHOA' star shared in a poignant video tribute that her father died on Friday, August 11.\n\nDrew said that the agony of losing her father had hit her hard, even though she knew it would happen eventually. \"You're never prepared for the inevitable, but here we are,\" she said.\n\nShe wrote this in the caption of an Instagram reel comprising videos and footage of the father-daughter duo over the years.\n\n\"It is with tears flowing, I announce that my father Dr Jordan has made his transition into Heaven,\" she declared, adding, \"As my mom says, He fought a good fight and finished his race, with a smile on his face he picked up his crown at Heaven’s Gate!\"\n\nThe Bravolebrity expressed appreciation to her fans, writing, \"Thank ya'll for allowing me to share my journey with my dad battling Alzheimer's Disease.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Thank you to all of you constantly messaging and writing me, sharing your own personal experiences with a loved one battling Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia,\" adding, \"We’re forever connected!!\"\n\n\"We're forever connected!!\" she wrote. \"I was a Daddy’s Girl and I will cherish the precious memories that will forever live in my heart and his legacy lives forever!\"\n\nDrew lauded her father's profession, declaring, \"He was the best pediatrician in all of Chicago and if you knew, you knew! He was passionate about helping people, saving lives and providing quality healthcare to those in the indigent community.\"\n\nShe also pledged to celebrate his life as she said, \"He served 4 generations or patients within his practice and he will truly be missed. He had the most humble and sweetest spirit and we will celebrate HIS LIFE!!!!!\"\n\n\"Thank you for your condolences and please keep my family in your prayers as we grieve,\" she said, concluding, \"I thank God, knowing we will see you Daddy again!\"\n\nFollowing her post, some of her Bravo friends commented with words of encouragement."
