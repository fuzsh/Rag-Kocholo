        "text": "The fascinating Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is an Arab kingdom in Western Asia, on the East Bank of the Jordan River. Jordan is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the east and south, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to the north, Israel, Palestine and the Dead Sea to the west and the Red Sea in its extreme south-west.\n\nJordan is considered to be among the safest of Arab countries in the Middle East, and has avoided long-term problems and instability In the midst of surrounding turmoil, it has been greatly hospitable, accepting refugees from almost all surrounding conflicts from as early as 1948, The name Jordan appears in an ancient Egyptian papyrus called Papyrus Anastasi I, dating back to around 1000 BC. The lands of modern-day Jordan were historically called \"Transjordan\", meaning \"beyond the Jordan River\".\n\nJordan is rich in Paleolithic remains, The oldest evidence of inhabitants by humans dates back around 250,000 years. The Kharanah area in eastern Jordan has evidence of human huts from about 20,000 years ago. Other Paleolithic sites include Pella and Al-Azraq. In the Neolithic period, several settlements began to develop, most notably an agricultural community called 'Ain Ghazal in what is now Amman, one of the largest known prehistoric settlements in the Near East and Plaster statues estimated to date back to around 7250 BC were uncovered there, and are among the oldest large human statues ever found.\n\nThe Royal Family of Jordan\n\nThe Ruling Monarch His Majesty King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein - and his family are very popular and much loved. His Majesty has transformed the Kingdom with his enormous efforts towards ensuring sustainable levels of economic growth and social development aimed at improving the standard of living of all Jordanians.\n\nBorn in Amman on January 30th, 1962, His Majesty King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein is the eldest son of His Majesty the late King Hussein and Her Royal Highness Princess Muna Al Hussein. He began his primary education at the Islamic Educational College in Amman, and later attended St. Edmund's School in Surrey, England. For his secondary education, he attended Eaglebrook School and Deerfield Academy in the United States of America.\n\nHer Majesty Queen Rania is an advocate for tolerance, compassion and bridge building between people of all cultures and backgrounds. She is committed to empowering communities and women\n\nand has launched many initiatives in the education sector. Undoubtedly the world's most beautiful and fashionable Queen.\n\nThe roots of the Hashemite Family reach back to the Prophet Abraham and his son, Ishmael.\n\nThe Hashemite name is derived from Hashem, a grandson of Qusai and the great-grandfather of the Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him). The Hashemites of Jordan are thus direct descendants of the Prophet through his daughter, Fatima, and her husband, Ali."
