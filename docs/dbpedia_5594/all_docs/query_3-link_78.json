The two women are both freshmen of the franchise and share a lot in common, including work in the entertainment industry and being a mother of three children. But for some reason, they did not hit it off.\n\nAli came out swinging, immediately forming an alliance with OG Kenya Moore and making fun of Sidora’s wig. Sidra shot back with shade, bringing an autographed headshot of herself to a cast trip to South Carolina to give to her “biggest fan,” Ali.\n\nShots were thrown about the two women’s relationship status, with Ali calling Sidora’s husband out for struggling financially and Sidora claiming Ali didn’t respect marriage because of Ali’s belief that if two people are legally separated, they are open to date around.\n\nThe light shade continued throughout the season, with the two bickering and making up throughout. The cast, sans Sidora, even agree that the two kissed during Cynthia Bailey’s bachelorette party. But things took a weird turn when Sidroa began facilitating rumors that Ali was allegedly in an entanglement with a “prophet” who is friends with Sidora.\n\nAccording to Sidora, Ali entered into a relationship with said “prophet” while he was engaged to someone else. The “prophet” however denied such and Ali said he was providing her spiritual counsel during a tough time. Still, Sidora ran with it, even canceling the “prophet’s” involvement in her baby’s Christening as a result. Things came to a head during the season finale when Ali threw a drink toward Sidora, leaving several cast members attempting to stop Sidora from lunging at Ali.\n\nBut alas, there is hope. During part 3 of the reunion special, Sidora and Ali appeared to call a truce. After discussing their up and down relationship with some fond memories of one another sprinkled throughout, Ali shocked her co-stars by extending an olive branch to Sidora. She expressed interest in rebuilding their relationship. Sidora agreed to do the same.\n\nIf both return to the show, hopefully, they keep their word."
