        "text": "The Real Housewives of Atlanta's Drew Sidora and Ralph Pittman are officially ending their marriage, PEOPLE can exclusively confirm.\n\n\"Love is a beautiful thing,\" Pittman, 37, said in an exclusive statement to PEOPLE. \"Unfortunately we have made the difficult decision to move on to our next chapters, independent of each other. Drew and I have decided to file for divorce. We have three amazing young children, and their mindset and growth is what is most important. As we navigate this difficult time, I ask that you please respect our privacy.\"\n\nAdded Sidora, 37, in a statement: \"After eight years of wholeheartedly fighting for my marriage, I have made the agonizing decision to release my husband with love. Although Ralph and I have decided to move forward separately, the hope is to remain friends so that we can co-parent responsibly. In spite of our very public life, I am asking for privacy during this difficult time as my children and I learn how to navigate through our new beginnings.\"\n\nAccording to documents obtained by PEOPLE, Pittman's petition for divorce was filed in Gwinnett County Superior Court on Monday. PEOPLE also obtained documents that confirm Sidora lodged her own divorce petition an hour before Pittman.\n\nPittman listed the couple's separation date as Feb. 19, while The Game actress claims they have been separated since last Thursday, Feb. 23.\n\nThough documents from Pittman request joint legal and physical custody of their children, Sidora's petition notes that \"there is no chance or hope of reconciliation\" between the spouses. She wants joint legal but temporary and permanent primary physical custody.\n\nThe Step Up actress on Wednesday submitted an amended divorcing filing with an explosive set of allegations against Pittman, claiming that he's a \"serial cheater and adulterer\" who abused her mentally, financially and at one point, got \"physically aggressive\" with her.\n\nSidora and Pittman married in August 2014. They later welcomed son Machai in June 2015 and daughter Aniya in February 2018. The That's So Raven alum also has an 11-year-old son, Josiah, from a previous relationship.\n\nMany of the couple's marital woes leading up to their divorce were chronicled on RHOA.\n\nLast year, Sidora discovered a suspicious text message between her husband and his female assistant (who was later fired). \"Finding out my husband was getting close with his assistant was really hard for me,\" she said on the show. \"I packed up my kids and we went to Chicago. I literally ran away from home.\"\n\nSidora also said she wanted Pittman to \"respect the relationship.\"\n\nRHOA castmates also took, with Kenya Moore calling Pittman \"so disrespectful\" as he faced accusations of gaslighting his wife.\n\n\"You're basically saying that she's lying and how it happened was not how it happened,\" Moore, 52, told Pittman in a 2022 episode. \"That would piss me the f--- off if somebody said that to me to my face, especially if I'm hurting. Do you not understand that? You're tearing her down.\"\n\nDespite their challenges, Sidora told BET last June that the pair planned to continue fighting for their marriage.\n\n\"I thought it was like Cinderella like a happily ever after and so we thought that's what it was going to be,\" she said. \"My parents who have been married for like 60 years made it look so easy. I'm in a situation where we have children, we're moving to a new city — life is happening and people are growing as well as changing.\"\n\nShe continued, \"It's hard because sometimes you're like, do I need to stay in this marriage or am I better off by myself? Then I think to myself when two people commit and you keep committing to each other, what can we do to fix this? You're switching counselors to find the right one — but we're committed and I think that's what keeps people together.\"\n\nSidora also noted that it's \"not that it's perfect because I'm not perfect and God knows he's not perfect,\" but they \"keep doing the work\" nonetheless.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories."
