        "text": "Drew Sidora struggles with the notion of her son, Josiah Jordan, having a relationship with his biological father. The celebrity delved into her feelings during Sunday’s episode of the Real Housewives of Atlanta (RHOA).\n\n“Josiah’s biological father was in prison when Ralph and I met and Ralph took my heart because he really loved my son,” Drew said of her blended family. Sidora married Ralph Pittman in 2014. The celebrities have two biological children, Machai and Aniya, together.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CKP0db9gjK_/\n\n“There’s been a lot of talk in our household recently about biological parents versus non-biological parents and because Josiah’s biological dad has been reaching out wanting to build a relationship with him,” Drew said during Sunday’s episode of RHOA. Ralph has advocated for Josiah to connect with his biological father. Drew, however, has expressed reservations about her son having a relationship with his dad.\n\n“I don’t even know what I’m going to say,” Sidora told her husband during the episode. “Like, I don’t want to push anything on him,” the celebrity mom added.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CH_v_iggX5J/\n\n“You are the only dad he knows,” Drew told her husband. “It’s like, he’s good,” she continued. “Like, he doesn’t need anybody else. So I just, in my mind I want to keep it like that, but it’s just not the reality.”\n\n“I just don’t want Jojo to ever grow up saying that, ‘You stopped me from having a relationship with my dad,'” Ralph said in defense of his stance to encourage Josiah to build a relationship with his biological father. “I understand how he feels right now, but I want to make sure that we don’t stand in the way from that relationship actually blossoming and them actually being able to establish something and create that real, true father-son bond,” Pittman told his wife.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CBuFuEEAtwi/j\n\nDrew and Ralph spoke with their son about the possibility of establishing a bond with his biological dad. Josiah, however, did not express a desire to meet with his father anytime soon.\n\nWatch Drew Sidora and her blended family every week on the Real Housewives of Atlanta."
