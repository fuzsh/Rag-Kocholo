        "text": "Drew Sidora and Ralph Pittman, whose relationship was featured on \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta,\" have pulled the plug on their nearly decade-long marriage.\n\nSidora and Pittman have filed for divorce, according to documents obtained by USA TODAY. Pittman also revealed his split from Sidora in a statement to People magazine Wednesday.\n\n\"Love is a beautiful thing,\" Pittman told the outlet. \"Unfortunately we have made the difficult decision to move on to our next chapters, independent of each other. Drew and I have decided to file for divorce.\"\n\nHe added: \"We have three amazing young children, and their mindset and growth is what is most important. As we navigate this difficult time, I ask that you please respect our privacy.\"\n\nBravoCon returns with30,000 fans, boos, cheers and plenty of 'Housewives'\n\n'Real Housewives of New York' Season 14 cast revealed at BravoCon: Meet the new 'Housewives'\n\nPittman filed for divorce Monday in the Gwinnett County Superior Court in Lawrenceville, Georgia, citing a marriage that's \"irretrievably broken\" and has \"no reasonable hope of reconciliation.\" The couple has been separated since Feb. 19, Pittman's petition states.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to representatives for Sidora and Pittman for comment.\n\nSidora and Pittman, who appeared on Bravo's \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\" from 2020-2022, married in August 2014. The couple have two children: son, Machai, 7, and daughter Aniya, 5. Sidora has another son, Josiah, from a previous relationship.\n\nPittman requested joint physical and legal custody of his children with Sidora in his divorce filing, as well as \"final decision-making authority\" on the children's academics and medical care.\n\nThe author and business strategist is also pushing back against payment of alimony or spousal support to Sidora, citing the success of his wife's entertainment career.\n\n\"(Sidora's) earning capacity far exceeds (Pittman's) capacity, as she is a pivotal character on this nationally syndicated franchised show that is shown on Bravo television network,\" the filing reads. \"Additionally, (Sidora) is an established professional actress and artist.\"\n\nSidora previously opened up about the difficulties of married life in an interview with BET.com in June.\n\n\"I thought it was like Cinderella, like a happily ever after, and so we thought that's what it was going to be,\" Sidora said at the time. \"My parents, who have been married for like 60 years, made it look so easy. I'm in a situation where we have children, we're moving to a new city — life is happening, and people are growing as well as changing.\"\n\n\"It's hard because sometimes you're like, ‘Do I need to stay in this marriage or am I better off by myself?'\" Sidora continued. \"Then I think to myself, when two people commit and you keep committing to each other, what can we do to fix this? You're switching counselors to find the right one — but we're committed, and I think that's what keeps people together.\"\n\nKathy Hilton, Kenya Moore, Lisa Rinna, Chanel Ayan dish on 'Housewives' drama at BravoCon\n\nJen Shah: 'Real Housewives' star sentenced to 6.5 years in prison for telemarketing scheme"
