        "text": "Claudia Jordan doesn’t tune in to “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” these days, but she isn’t ruling out returning to the show.\n\nThe actress revealed Sunday that she would be open to becoming a “Housewife” again if Bravo offered her a new contract.\n\n“It was a great experience, and I still get love to this day [from fans], and I would definitely go back,” she told “Entertainment Tonight” while attending the 2023 BET Awards.\n\nHowever, Jordan, 50, admitted, “I don’t watch ‘Housewives’ anymore. Once I wasn’t on the show, I watched it two more times. Some people go on there, and they make it their entire life.”\n\nThe model shared that “no one” from the network has “called” her “as of late” about a potential homecoming, but she is “here for the coin” in the event that her phone rings.\n\nCan’t get enough ‘Real Housewives’?\n\n10 most expensive homes owned by Housewives\n\nWhy so many Housewives divorce their husbands\n\nWhich ‘Real Housewife’ Are You Based on Your Zodiac Sign\n\nIn the meantime, Jordan is keeping busy with other projects.\n\n“I’ve done so many other things, and I’m really loving my time kind of popping in and out of ‘The Breakfast Club’ in New York, films, producing and I wrote a stage play,” she explained.\n\nThe former Bravolebrity was a full-time “Housewife” during Season 7 of “RHOA.” She also made brief appearances during Seasons 8 and 13.\n\nIn July 2022, Jordan revealed why she did not go back on the series after a fan asked her why she left.\n\n“didn’t wanna come back as a friend of the show and that was my only option if I wasn’t going to share my relationship on the show,” she replied via Instagram.\n\n“At the time and [sic] the guy I was seeing had too much to lose going on there (super successful and known but i kept it very private like usual),” she continued, “and good thing we didn’t go public on the show- turns out he was not the most honest! I woulda been humiliated! #DodgedABullet.”\n\nJordan most recently dated realtor Kendall “KJ” Dismute, whom she referred to as her “boyfriend of three years” on VH1’s “Couples Retreat” in May 2022.\n\nIt is unclear whether the couple are still together."
