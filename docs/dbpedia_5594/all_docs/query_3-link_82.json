        "text": "KENYA Moore has decided to return to the Real Housewives of Atlanta, and fans are pumped.\n\nKenya, 53, was on the main cast of RHOA from Season 5 through Season 10.\n\nShe was fired from the show after she hid her wedding from producers and her husband, Marc Daly, refused to be on the show, according to Ebony.\n\nKenya filed for divorce from Marc in 2021 and officially finished the process in 2023.\n\nShe said her relationship was \"irretrievably broken\" and cannot be reconciled.\n\nWith her ex out of the way, Kenya's free to put her life back in the limelight and take her rightful place as a Real Housewife.\n\nIt was confirmed that she will be coming back to RHOA as a main cast member in the 16th season, according to LoveBScott.\n\nPorsha Williams, who appeared on the show for nine seasons until she left in Season, will also be returning.\n\nFans on X, formerly known as Twitter, went wild when they heard the news of Kenya's return.\n\nOne said, \"Someone has to save the show #rhoa.\"\n\n\"Good! She's probably my favorite housewife. She stands up to everyone,\" added another.\n\nA third wrote, \"Duh? There’s no RHOA without our Kenya queen.\"\n\n\"I see the Kenya Moore haters are already mad that Twirl is coming back. I can’t wait to see what Kenya and Brooklyn have been up to!!\" commented a fan.\n\nA fifth said, \"Mother will reign supreme 16! Welcome back Queen @KenyaMoore.\"\n\nRHOA REVAMP\n\nPeta Phipps, a producer on RHOA spoke exclusively with The U.S. Sun to tease the upcoming season of the show.\n\nWeeks ago, it was announced that Kandi Burruss, Marlo Hampton, and Sanya Richards-Ross will not return for Season 16.\n\nKenya Moore, Sheree Whitfield, and Drew Sidora joined the three women for Season 15.\n\nPeta teased who else could be joining the cast in an exclusive chat with The U.S. Sun while hosting the ICON Travel Lounge in Beverly Hills.\n\nShe said the \"ink is drying\" on the contracts, and now it's known that Kenya was one of the surprise stars.\n\nShe didn't spill any names, but she confirmed that former and new stars would be coming to the show.\n\nPeta called Season 16 one of \"the most powerful seasons\" due to the \"eclectic mix.\"\n\nThey \"re-energized\" the series without doing a full reboot like RHONYC."
