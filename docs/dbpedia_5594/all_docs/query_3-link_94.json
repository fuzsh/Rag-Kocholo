        "text": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s relationship with the royal family has not come back from its fallout four years ago. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex now live in the United States, and Meghan has not returned to the UK since 2022; Harry has blamed it on a lack of security for his wife. But things between the royals went south years ago, and it might have had to do with one big disparity that Meghan noticed immediately upon meeting Prince William and Kate Middleton for the first time.\n\nMeghan Markle was ‘taken aback’ by Prince William and Kate Middleton’s home\n\nWhen Harry and Meghan started dating, they kept the relationship under wraps for quite a while. But during that time, Meghan did have a chance to get to know her future in-laws, and she and Harry eventually met up with William and Kate at their home. Although there were a number of things that led to the falling out between Harry and William, insiders claim that Meghan noticed something about the two brothers almost immediately upon visiting William and Kate’s home for the first time: They lived in completely different places.\n\nRobert Jobson, author of “Catherine, the Princess of Wales: The Biography,” wrote in his book, “Meghan had moved into cozy Nottingham Cottage on the Kensington Palace estate with Harry. When they went to have drinks at William and Catherine’s palatial apartment, she was apparently ‘taken aback’ at the disparity between the brothers.”\n\nAccording to Express, a source close to the couple said, “I am not saying Meghan was jealous, but she was surprised how lavishly Harry’s brother was living compared to where they were living … It was perhaps the beginning of all the tensions between the couples.”\n\nAt the time Meghan and Harry met, William and Kate had been married for several years and had two children. As the future king with a family, it might make sense that William and Kate had a slightly nicer place, but it’s also fair to question why they were living so much better than Harry.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle reportedly did not receive the same treatment in the family\n\nA big reason why Harry and Meghan left the royal family was because they felt the treatment they received did not compare to the way William and Kate were treated. Harry revealed later in interviews that the royal family would often lie to protect William and Kate’s reputations, but they would never tell the truth if it meant protecting Meghan. The media often made accusations about Meghan and her actions, which the family never disputed.\n\nThese days, Harry and Meghan hardly have a relationship with the royal family. The two are living in California and raising their two children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, and they hardly ever return to the UK as a family due to security concerns. Of course, there is still time to heal the royal rift, but it looks like it runs pretty deep."
