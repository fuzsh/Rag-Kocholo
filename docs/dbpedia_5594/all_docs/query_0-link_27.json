The post included Luther Vandross’ “Dance With My Father” in the background, as reported by Page Six.\n\n“You’re never prepared for the inevitable, but here we are…. It is with tears flowing, I announce that my father Dr. Robert A. Jordan has made his transition into Heaven.” she began the post’s caption. “As my mom says, He fought a good fight and finished his race, with a smile on his face he picked up his crown at Heaven’s Gate!”\n\nSidora also extended a token of gratitude to those who have been supportive of her throughout her father’s health struggle.\n\n“Thank you to all of you constantly messaging and writing me, sharing your own personal experiences with a loved one battling Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia. We’re forever connected,” she wrote.\n\nShe added that she will cherish the close relationship she had with her father.\n\n“I was a Daddy’s Girl and I will cherish the precious memories that will forever live in my heart and his legacy lives forever!” she wrote.\n\nDrew also shared that Jordan was more than just her father. He was a pillar in the community whose mission was to serve those in need.\n\n“He was the best pediatrician in all of Chicago and if you knew, you knew! He was passionate about helping people, saving lives and providing quality healthcare to those in the indigent community,” wrote Sidora. “He served 4 generations or patients within his practice and he will truly be missed. He had the most humble and sweetest spirit and we will celebrate HIS LIFE!!!!!”\n\nSome of Sidora’s reality TV family showered her with condolences. In the comments section of the post, Kandi Burrus wrote, “I’m praying for strength for you and your family.” And Kenya Moore said, “😢😢😢 my prayers to your family during this time. 🙏🏾.”\n\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta alum Porsha Williams added, “I’m so sorry!
