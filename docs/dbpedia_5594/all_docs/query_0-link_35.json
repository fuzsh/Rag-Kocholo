The love he showed as a husband, father, uncle, grandfather, physician, and so much more to everyone he met was truly unmatched. His legacy and memories will forever be cherished through all he met and loved, and the family asks for privacy during this time.”\n\nIn a separate post, she posted a video of her father with his family and wrote that her father passed away from Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nOur thoughts and prayers are with Drew and her family during this time."
