        "text": "The bad: Erika divorced Tom, and then they were accused of embezzlement, womp.\n\nThe good: The breakup led to the best quote of all time (*clears throat*): \"Tom’s house was broken into and he confronted the burglar and then had to go have eye surgery and then my son had to go over and help and then my son he rolled his car five times on the way home, yeah, I’m under a lot of stress.\"\n\nDavid Foster and legendary almond mom Yolanda Hadid split in 2015, when she was undergoing treatment for Lyme disease. Details on the WHY of it all were sparse, but David recently set the record straight in his documentary.\n\n\"How can I leave a sick woman?\" he said. \"The fact of the matter is that was not the reason I left. It was for a different reason—which I will never disclose—that had nothing to do with her being sick.\"\n\nSAY MORE.\n\nLemme set the scene:\n\nSummer House season 8 had wrapped up filming. The cast was gearing up for what I'm comfortable calling the \"wedding of the century\" (I said what I said!). And then—eliciting a collective gasp—Carl Radke called up Bravo and had producers film his breakup with Lindsay Hubbard on camera.\n\nMe, personally? I'm still unable to go one single day without talking about it.\n\nReal Housewives of Beverly Hills literally *began* with Kelsey Grammer peacing out of Camille's life—and before long, she was accusing him of infidelity while their divorce was played out on screen. But on the plus side, she got a $30 million settlement, so!\n\nCount Alex broke up with Countess Luann over *checks notes* email in 2009 when he was allegedly cheating with Princess Kemeria Abajobir Abajifar. I'll give you a moment to read that sentence again.\n\nFortunately, the split didn't stop her from living a life filled with gems, jets, silhouettes, and Champagne in the sky.\n\nFirst came love, then came marriage, then came awkwardly having to continue being on a show together post-divorce. But despite the perpetually emo vibes (pretty sure Tom's still down bad crying at the gym over Katie), these two have managed to stay friends. We love to see it!\n\nFWIW, Paul fully blames Real Housewives for their messy divorce.\n\n\"I don't think I'd ever do something like that again,\" he told E! News of being on the franchise. \"I think being on a reality show, it did speed up our demise and divorce. I think it was going to happen anyway, eventually.\"\n\nI mean...he didn't exactly give up reality TV, considering Botched has been on for a decade...but okay, buddy.\n\nNone of us saw Kyle and Mauricio's split coming (except Medium Allison DuBois, of course), but I guess no relationship is safe in the Bravoverse! As for why they broke up, an Us Weekly source claimed back in 2023 that the \"catalyst for the separation\" was—as the outlet put it—Mauricio’s \"wandering eye.\" 👀\n\nThey're more on-again / off-again than me and dairy.\n\nTLDR, Austin and Madison broke up in 2020, got involved in a dramatic love-square with Jay Cutler and Kristen Cavallari, and then stopped speaking.\n\nBut nowadays, things seem chill so guess ^^ that's ^^ all water under the reality TV bridge.\n\nBrittany and Jax are currently separated, and the timing raised some eyebrows, since the announcement came while they were in the midst of promoting The Valley. PR stunt? Nope, turns out the drama is real.\n\nAs Brittany told When Reality Hits back in February, \"I just want to make one thing clear and that is that my life is not a publicity stunt for anything...I just want to make that very clear: no publicity stunts here.\"\n\nBecause a mustached leopard truly never changes its spots, Tom Sandoval cheated on Kristen Doute with...Ariana Madix.\n\nSo as you might expect, Kristen was pretty vocal when Tom cheated on Ariana. By which I mean, she called him a \"trash human being.\"\n\nEva filed for divorce back in 2023 after four years of marriage (starting to think there's a Housewife curse) and told People: \"This has been one of the hardest decisions I have ever had to make, but sometimes life takes your journey in a direction you were not expecting.\"\n\nTruer! words!"
