        "text": "Drew Sidora and Ralph Pittman have yet to go their separate ways — at least, when it comes to their living situation.\n\nMore than a year after The Real Housewives of Atlanta couple filed for divorce, Drew confirmed she and her estranged husband have continued “living under the same roof.” However, it wasn’t by choice. She touched on the matter during a recent interview with People magazine, saying drawn-out court proceedings were to blame for their co-habitation.\n\n“It’s still not settled,” Drew said about her divorce battle. “I didn’t even know that could happen. I was like, ‘What?’ But yeah — he is living in the basement.\n\nDrew Sidora gets real about cohabitating with her estranged husband\n\nUnsurprisingly, Drew wasn’t pleased with the “crazy” arrangement, suggesting it hindered her ability to fully move forward.\n\n“It’d be much easier if we were able to move on separately,” she continued. “You know, out of sight, out of mind, with your own space and your own energy. But that’s clearly not in the cards. So sharing space has been a double whammy. We’re kind of like, the blueprint for a sh-tshow divorce.”\n\nShe continued: “So I’m just learning how this process can go in the worst-case scenario. And I’m taking it literally one day at a time.”\n\nHere's what you might've missed on Bravo:\n\nAnother Alum Is Returning for RHOA Season 16 — See the Complete Cast List\n\nWe Have New Details on Drew Sidora and Ralph Pittman's Divorce\n\nWho Was Porsha Williams Married To? Her Exes From Simon Guobadia to Kordell Stewart\n\nDrew Sidora and Ralph Pittman's Marriage and Family\n\nDrew and Ralph each filed for divorce in February 2023 after eight years of marriage. The two reportedly met in 2013 when Drew was a single mother to her oldest child, Josiah. The exes got engaged in June of 2014 and officially tied the knot a couple of months later.\n\nAbout a year into their marriage, Drew and Ralph began expanding their family. They welcomed a son named Machai David Pittman in 2015 and a daughter named Aniya Grace Pittman in 2018.\n\nDrew Sidora reveals what led to her and Ralph Pittman's divorce filings\n\nThe actress/singer opened up about her divorce during a June 2023 appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, saying there wasn't one specific moment that led to their split.\n\n“I think it was a culmination of just the years of enduring and enduring,” Drew said. “And as a wife, you know, my parents have been married for 60 years, so I only saw two people who loved each other and constantly fought for their marriage. That’s how I was raised. But I think at a point when it’s public humiliation and dealing with things that are now coming out in front of the camera, it was a breaking point that I reached.”\n\nHost Andy Cohen then asked Drew if Ralph had been “faithful” during their marriage.\n\n“Well, I know that wasn’t the case,” she responded."
