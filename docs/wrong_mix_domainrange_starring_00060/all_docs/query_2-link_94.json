        "text": "The omnishambles shambles on. We’re holding on until July 4 for the next round of the Toowoomba rape committal proceedings in Chapter Two of The Adventures of Bruce Lehrmann. Or is that Chapter 15?\n\nIn the latest case, Lehrmann is accused of raping a woman twice after a night out in October 2021, at a local strip club named The Vault, eight months after stories were first published suggesting Lehrmann had raped Brittany Higgins at Parliament House, Canberra.\n\nPolice have claimed the alleged Toowoomba offences took place after the woman had fallen asleep in bed while kissing Lehrmann. He is yet to enter a plea but it is believed he will contest the charges. His lawyers have submitted a 12-page outline arguing the “sufficiency of the evidence”.\n\nThe committal hearing for the Toowoomba case was conducted under a cone of silence on Monday, with the media excluded while the complainant gave evidence.\n\nThere was no reporting of Lehrmann’s name in earlier court mentions – as was the practice at that time in Queensland.\n\nWhen the media made applications for the veil of secrecy to be lifted, lawyers for the accused said their client was suicidal and it was absolutely critical his identity should not be made public.\n\nMeanwhile, a New South Wales tribunal dealing with property and other disputes has another round in the Lehrmann house damage case scheduled for June 27.\n\nGaenor Meakes, the owner of a property on Sydney’s northern beaches, leased through the Seven Network to Lehrmann, is seeking more than $13,000 for repairs.\n\nThen there was the karaoke nuisance booming from another house where Lehrmann had subsequently taken up digs – driving neighbours to distraction.\n\nMaybe there’s a lesson here somewhere. As Matilda Meakes, daughter of Gaenor, said when asked whether her family knew Lehrmann was their tenant: “I don’t think anyone would willingly rent to him, would they?”\n\nNonetheless, recent reports had him visiting the Point Piper home of Lady Penny Street, widow of the former chief justice and lieutenant-governor of NSW, Sir Laurence Street.\n\nIt’s been reported that Lady Penny is a friend of Bettina Arndt’s, the men’s rights activist who arranged for Lehrmann to address a jamboree on the presumption of innocence.\n\nThat conference was cancelled after Lehrmann was found by the Federal Court to be, more probably than not, a rapist.\n\nThe spotlight now has swung onto appeals from Justice Michael Lee’s reasons, where the trial judge upheld the truth defence of Network Ten and Lisa Wilkinson, but rejected the defence relating to the reasonableness of the journalists’ conduct.\n\nLehrmann has lodged a notice of appeal and Wilkinson a notice of contention.\n\nAt this stage Lehrmann – a law student – appears to be representing himself. It’s probable the notice of appeal has been lodged, just within the cut-off date, as a holding device while he conjures legal representation and money.\n\nHe’s claiming he has been denied procedural fairness, that Justice Lee’s findings on the truth defence were incorrect because it had not been properly pleaded by the respondents and had not been put to him in cross-examination.\n\nFurther, the meaning applied by the judge to the word “rape” is also challenged. Justice Lee used the term “non-advertent recklessness” in relation to rape in this context.\n\nLehrmann’s notice of appeal is struggling on this point, but presumably he is suggesting it is not a definition of rape understood by the ordinary, reasonable viewer of the TV program.\n\nIt has been speculated that noted appellate barrister Guy Reynolds, SC, and criminal barrister Margaret Cunneen, SC, have provided advice to Lehrmann.\n\nWhile Lehrmann has concentrated on Justice Lee’s reasons relating to truth, Wilkinson submits that the judge erred in finding she and Network Ten’s conduct was unreasonable in the way they went about producing and presenting the interview with Brittany Higgins.\n\nFor now, we have an outcome where the journalists acted unreasonably in publishing a true story.\n\nA bigger problem than the appeal points is the money. The appeal filing fee has been stumped up by someone, but funds are needed if lawyers are to take him to the full court.\n\nAlmost certainly, if the appeal goes ahead, there will be an application for security for costs. In the Ben Roberts-Smith case that came close to $1 million. Lehrmann would need something of that order to press ahead.\n\nWith the benefit of a no win, no fee agreement for his big defamation trial, he has left a raft of lawyers who represented him unpaid. Raising sufficient funds for another spin of the wheel may be a tall order – particularly as he owes a fortune to the respondents in the case he brought, and lost, against Ten.\n\nThis is not to say Lehrmann and his lawyers have been entirely unsuccessful in earlier reputational claims.\n\nIn May last year, he reached a settlement with News Life Media, publisher of Murdoch’s news.com.au. This arose from political editor Samantha Maiden’s February 2021 story that claimed there had been a rape in a ministerial office.\n\nThat settlement made no provision for payment of damages to Lehrmann, only a contribution of $295,000 towards his costs. One of Maiden’s articles appeared under the headline: “Parliament House alleged rape: How Brittany Higgins horror night unfolded”.\n\nLehrmann was not named but, as with the Network Ten case, he claimed he was nonetheless identified.\n\nMaiden’s role in the unfolding events was crucial and is often overlooked. Lehrmann’s lawyers had told her on the day he was charged in August 2021 that “nothing happened” in the parliamentary office.\n\nShe came back to Higgins with that information and up to then the young staffer only remembers at one point Lehrmann being on top of her. She has no clarity about the circumstances or her consent.\n\nIt was only when she was told Lehrmann claimed “nothing happened” she knew she must have been raped.\n\nIn late November last year, the ABC agreed to pay $150,000 as a contribution to Lehrmann’s costs for an action he brought over the live broadcast of a National Press Club address by Brittany Higgins and women’s safety advocate Grace Tame.\n\nIt included an amount of $7000 that Lehrmann was required to pay for National Press Club president Laura Tingle’s compliance with a subpoena.\n\nThe settlement included a statement that the national broadcaster did not suggest Lehrmann was guilty of the criminal charge of rape. It also removed a Facebook video of the press club address.\n\nAlso afoot are ancillary proceedings.\n\nSenator Linda Reynolds, the minister in whose office the alleged rape took place in the early hours of March 23, 2019, is suing Brittany Higgins and her husband David Sharaz.\n\nThis concerns posts on social media reflecting on Reynolds’s level of concern and care for her young female staffer.\n\nIt takes high-voltage anger and pain for a politician to sue a victim of sexual assault when the floor of parliament is available – a place where fleas can be scratched off with impunity and in public.\n\nPeter Dutton claims the senator was “vindicated” by Justice Lee and that she is a “first-class individual”. There’s another story to be told at a later time about Ten’s failure to establish a political cover-up.\n\nReynolds also wants the National Anti-Corruption Commission to unravel the government’s $2.4 million duty-of-care settlement with Higgins.\n\nBrittany Higgins herself would have various causes of action. She could have a case against Lehrmann, the Seven Network and The Australian for breach of the Harman undertaking – the rule that says documents subpoenaed specifically for judicial proceedings should not be leaked to third parties for ulterior purposes.\n\nIn Canberra, the ACT Integrity Commission is probing the relationship between Walter Sofronoff and journalists reporting on his Board of Inquiry into Lehrmann’s prosecution in the ACT Supreme Court.\n\nThe former capital territory director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, sought judicial review of Sofronoff’s report and Acting Justice Stephen Kaye later found the findings of his inquiry were infected by bias as a result of his close interaction with opinion columnist Janet Albrechtsen.\n\nThe inquiry followed the failed prosecution of Lehrmann, with an initial trial aborted due to juror misconduct and a second trial abandoned over concerns for Brittany Higgins’s mental health. Lehrmann has always maintained his innocence.\n\nIf Lehrmann hadn’t sued, he might one day have ended up as a Liberal Party member of parliament, a cabinet minister and whatever else lay beyond.\n\nThe lesson for punks and upstarts who mistakenly think their reputations should be varnished is: don’t go back for your hat."
