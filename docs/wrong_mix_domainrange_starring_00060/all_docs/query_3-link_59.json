        "text": "Death has taken many forms in media over the decades — from a Norm MacDonald-voiced Grim Reaper in Family Guy to an anthropologically-minded Brad Pitt in Meet Joe Black — but no depiction is quite like in Tuesday. For the first trailer of the upcoming film, Julia Louis-Dreyfus has the ominous fate appear in the form of a shape-shifting, gravelly-voiced talking parrot.\n\n“Madam, you need to say goodbye to your daughter,” Death warns Louis-Dreyfus.\n\nThe latest film from A24 is shaping up to be a tear-jerking drama as Lola Petticrew plays a terminally ill girl who gets a visit from the avian messenger, while Louis-Dreyfus plays Petticrew’s mother who is struggling to cope with her daughter’s impending fate. Petticrew was last featured in the 2022 drama She Said. Aside from the duo, Arinzé Kene is featured as Death’s voice.\n\n“I don’t know what I am without you, who I am without you,” Louis-Dreyfus’ character says in the trailer. “I don’t know what the world is without you in it.”\n\nThe film was written and directed by Daina Oniunas-Pusic, Pusic’s feature length debut, and it’s yet to get an official release date. Tuesday was previously showcased at the Telluride Film Festival last fall.\n\nTrending\n\nBeyond Tuesday, Louis-Dreyfus, whose recent feature films arrived last year when she starred in Netflix’s You People and in You Hurt My Feelings, is set to reprise her MCU role as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine in Thunderbolts, currently set to hit theaters in 2025.\n\nWatch the full trailer for the upcoming film below:"
