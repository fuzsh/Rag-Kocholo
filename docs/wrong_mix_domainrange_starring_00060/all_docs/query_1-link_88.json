        "text": "Hugh Laurie hasn’t just worked with some of the greatest television acting talent to ever step in front of a camera, but he’s roundly recognised as a pretty damn fine thespian himself who has mastered both comedy and drama.\n\nSo when he says that a particular actress is the best that he’s ever had the good fortune of working with you take notice. During a recent interview with TV Line Hugh Laurie revealed this individual to be Julia Louis-Dreyfus, which should come as no surprise to anyone who has seen the actress strut her stuff in the likes of ‘Seinfeld’, ‘The New Adventures Of Old Christine’ and ‘Veep’.\n\nIt was in ‘Veep’ that Hugh Laurie got to see Julia Louis Dreyfus up close and personal, as he appeared in the comedy over the course of its fourth and fifth season as Selina Meyers’ running mate Tom James. By the end of the latter Tom James’ plans to usurp Selina as President had fallen flat, and his revelation that he was planning to start a billion dollar-hedge-fund suggests that he won’t be as present in the sixth season.\n\nNot that that has quashed Laurie’s appreciation of Louis-Dreyfus’ talents, though. After admitting that he doesn’t get to watch ‘Veep’ as much anymore because he doesn’t like to watch himself, Laurie added, “But in exchange for that, I get to see Julia Louis-Dreyfus [up close]. She is the best I’ve ever seen. Ever.”\n\nWhen asked for further details about the actress’ brilliance, Laurie responded, “It’s awe-inspiring. She [plays Seilna] with such brilliance, energy and invention. And she never settles. As soon as a take is done she’s going, ‘Let’s try this.’”\n\n“She’s always pushing, until people almost have to pull her away and go, ‘Julia, it’s all right. It’s all right. We’ve got it.’ And [she doesn’t work] in an obsessive way, she does it with such good grace. She’s unbelievable.”\n\nHugh Laurie isn’t the only one to appreciate Julia Louis-Dreyfus’ efforts, as last month she won the Primetime Emmy Award For Outstanding Lead Actress In A Comedy Series for the fifth year in a row, while she’s the only actress to win an Emmy acting award for three separate comedies.\n\nAnd, having previously won the Best Actress gong for her work on ‘The New Adventures Of Old Christine’, too, her six Emmys in this category means she’s now surpassed Mary Tyler Moore and Candice Bergen for most wins, too.\n\nNo wonder Hugh Laurie wouldn’t rule out working with her again, because when he was pushed for an answer on whether he’ll feature in season six of ‘Veep’ he simply said, “If they’ll have me.”\n\nWe’ll find out if there’s room for his own rather delightful comedy talents when ‘Veep’ returns at some point in 2017."
