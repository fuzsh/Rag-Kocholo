        "text": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus is nestled into a corner booth at the San Ysidro Ranch. Airpods in, curly brown hair pinned to the nape of her neck, she’s contemplating the wildflowers that seem to grow especially tall just for the exclusive Montecito hotel— 3,000 physical and psychological miles away from Selina Meyer, the soulless DC swamp creature she’s played to perennial Emmy glory on HBO’s Veep. You might even mistake this particular diminutive lady as one of the rarefied few who can while away a Monday afternoon lunching at one of the finest establishments in all of California, or imagine that such a scene is a permanent fixture of Louis-Dreyfus’s future.\n\nWhen we meet on a gloomy, late-spring day, it’s a few weeks after Veep’s seven-season flambéing of U.S. politics has come to its ash-black finale and several months after the series wrapped shooting in December. Louis-Dreyfus has won the Emmy for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series for each of the show’s previous six seasons and is nominated again this year. Combined with another in the category for her work on The New Adventures of Old Christine in 2006, and one a decade earlier for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy for Seinfeld, Louis-Dreyfus is currently tied with Cloris Leachman for the most acting Emmys in history. It seems all but certain she will have the honor to herself as of awards night this year.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus has, in other words, had one of the most fruitful runs in American comedy history, and a little break might seem to be in order. Yet as we sit at the quaint Stonehouse Restaurant, it becomes quickly apparent that contemplating the Montecito wildflowers might be all the tranquility the 58-year-old can afford right now. There’s one last Veep Emmy campaign; postproduction on her upcoming film Downhill, a five-year passion project she produced and stars in opposite Will Ferrell; plus her youngest son’s graduation from Northwestern. Work, it turns out, and really only good work at that, is where Louis-Dreyfus seems to feel most complete. She loves grinding through a scene until the rhythm rings just right, when the jokes fly high and the insults land with finely calibrated precision. She seems to take breaks only when they are thrust upon her.\n\n“I said to my husband I’m taking July and August off, and he kind of laughed,” she says. “I’m going to try to stick to it,” she continues, then pauses. “I’m looking for a new psychiatrist as we speak.”\n\nSo there’s Louis-Dreyfus’s undeniable work ethic, but there’s also the fact that with rest comes thought—and the unenviable task of unpacking all that’s happened to her in the last three years. Her beloved father died in September 2016. The following year, doctors diagnosed her with stage II breast cancer; she underwent six rounds of chemotherapy and a double mastectomy. Then, just as Veep was ending its final season, her 44-year-old half sister died of an accidental drug overdose.\n\n“I hate to have to think about it,” she says. “But I’m very happy to be alive.”\n\nLouis-Dreyfus finds it far easier to reside in the relative comfort of her ambitions and the work they bring, a tactic she’s relied on since she was a child. Her late father, Gérard Louis-Dreyfus, was the chairman of Louis Dreyfus Energy Services and scion of the multinational merchant corporation that bears the family name. Louis-Dreyfus has tended to downplay the effect of her family’s wealth when it comes up in interviews, and the ennui that we sometimes associate with offspring of such privilege did seem to pass her right on by. “I was always dying to get to the next play that we were going to put on, I was constantly needing to do that. I was also always very busy, constantly busy. I just operate like that,” she says. “Maybe it’ll change. It may change because it may take that much time to find whatever the next thing is.”\n\nAnd there will be a next thing. Louis-Dreyfus doesn’t view her career from the outside, as in Oh, I’ve done enough. Climbed every mountain. Maybe it’s time to call it quits. Rather, it’s just about finding that next great thing she can dive into in that all-encompassing way that brings her such joy. The trick will be finding material worthy of such attention.\n\n“It’s not like wonderful ideas are low-hanging fruit,” she reminds me, as she pulls her own salt out of her purse to season her salmon bowl. “I’m hoping I’ll find even greater material, but who the fuck knows?”\n\nLouis-Dreyfus didn’t become a household name until Seinfeld hit in 1989, when she was approaching 30. Prior to that, she was living a nomadic young actor’s existence: miserable during her three-year stint on Saturday Night Live, which she left college early to pursue with her husband of 32 years, writer-director Brad Hall—and which she credits with teaching her a slew of lessons, including rethinking her definition of success.\n\n“I didn’t fail, but I didn’t succeed,” she says of that agonizing period in New York. “My ambition became clearer to me during that time. It helped me get my priorities in place in terms of what I was going to do moving forward and what I would not tolerate, [which was] nastiness or a culture of unhappiness. I didn’t want to work like that. I thought to myself, If I’m going to keep going, I’m not going to do this if it isn’t fun anymore. Fortunately, it became fun.”\n\nVeep showrunner David Mandel, who first met Louis-Dreyfus when he was a staff writer on Seinfeld, credits her relentless drive—and overall good nature—to her cultural arrival coming at a bit of an older age. When I present her with Mandel’s theory, her comedic timing belt delivers us to the punch line.\n\n“Maybe David should be my new psychiatrist.…”\n\nLast August, Louis-Dreyfus and costar Tony Hale were deep in the muggy San Fernando Valley, sweltering in a prop airplane that lost air-conditioning every time the cameras rolled. Louis-Dreyfus had just returned to work after her 11-month break for cancer treatment.\n\n“It was so unbelievably hot,” recalls Hale, who plays Meyer’s sycophantic bagman, Gary, of shooting the memorable opening moments of Veep’s seventh season. (Hale, who has previously won two Emmys for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy in the role, is nominated again this year.) Meyer and Gary open the door of the airplane prepared to greet a throng of supporters to find only an empty tarmac. Once again the Meyer campaign screwed up and sent the press, the crowds, and her prep team to the wrong Iowa town. Meyer, in the season’s first crescendo of bratty frustration, hurls her phone onto the runway.\n\n“We’re doing it. We get it. And then there’s this idea,” says Mandel. “What if Tony chases after the phone once she’s thrown it.… It would be very easy to go, ‘We’ve got it. Let’s move on.’ ”\n\nLouis-Dreyfus, however, pushed for more.\n\n“We were just absolutely giddy,” Hale says of the shoot. “Julia described being back on set as kind of an elixir. It’s like so much of her mental energy had gone into fighting cancer, now it could be redirected. What a gift that was.”\n\nWhile by outward appearances Louis-Dreyfus was fully back, she tells me at lunch that she was not yet in fighting shape when she returned to set. Still, she couldn’t bear to stay away any longer, especially with a cast and crew of 200 on hold. “I hated the idea of all these people waiting for me,” she says. “That made me really anxious.” So rather than postpone her return date, she got on the plane.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus’s diagnosis and treatment played out publicly, making her return to Veep all the more charged. In September 2017 she chose to share her cancer diagnosis with her nearly 1 million Twitter followers in a post that read, in part, “One in eight women get breast cancer. Today, I’m the one.”\n\nWhile Louis-Dreyfus was relieved that she could somewhat control the messaging and use her bully pulpit to talk about the inequities of our current health care system, she didn’t anticipate just how intense the reaction would be. The Northwestern basketball team dedicated a fund-raiser to her. Veep cast members posted Twitter videos on chemo days. Even Hillary Clinton, whom Louis-Dreyfus has never met, posted well wishes. In total, her message generated 23,000 comments, mostly from strangers.\n\nIn her own home, she was a woman fighting a terrifying disease. But for the last 30 years, Louis-Dreyfus has been a weekly fixture in our homes via multiple, very watchable and rewatchable television series. She is as close to a constant in TV as there is. And so out in the world, she was being cast as some kind of modern-day folk hero, our stalwart entertainer fashioned into a cancer warrior. The New Yorker profiled her. Time magazine made her a cover story. She was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. “Even perfect people get cancer,” says Nicole Holofcener, the writer-director who directed Louis-Dreyfus in 2013’s Enough Said. “And then we realize they are not perfect, they are human beings. I think she did us all a favor with that.”\n\nI, for one, was grateful for her candor. Last July, when I received my own breast cancer diagnosis, I was scared and confused. One of the first things I did was revisit her tweet. It gave me the courage to share my situation with my own social media network, something I likely wouldn’t have done had I not had her words to guide me.\n\nThis strange, one-sided relationship only intensified the morning of my double mastectomy, when I was scrolling through Instagram and found a new photo of Louis-Dreyfus. She had just posted a shot in which she looked beautiful, powerful, and distinctly on the other side of her grueling ordeal. At the moment, I was terrified, sitting in the hospital, waiting to undergo a four-hour operation, not yet knowing what they would find and what it would mean. As much as my husband tried to help, the only thing that seemed to ease my anxiety was that damn photo of Louis-Dreyfus. She was proof somehow that I would endure. So I posted it, just moments before the drugs started to take effect.\n\nI hesitate before telling Louis-Dreyfus this story; after all, this piece isn’t about me. But I wanted her to know that her public admission helped a lot of women, many of whom never reached out to her on social media. She leans forward, gives me a high-five, and declares, “That’s awesome!” We proceed to talk about cancer for the next half hour, sharing the highs and lows, the weird procedures, the maintenance drugs, the side effects. But she doesn’t want those details in this piece for fear that it will be too cancer-y. She still has work to do on herself, but she’s made the decision to do so privately.\n\n“There is that moment that you have when you’re like, ‘Is this it for me?’ ” she says. “Because you know everybody here in this room is going to come across that moment in their life, but you never think you will.”\n\nI ask her if her outlook on life has changed since battling the disease.\n\n“I’m still working it out, to be honest with you,” she says. “I’m glad I got through it, but there’s a part of me that’s still a little frightened, you know?”\n\nAnd I do. Because that’s the thing about cancer, even after you go through all the treatments and they tell you you’re cancer-free, the best doctors don’t know what caused it, so there is little you can do to make sure it doesn’t return. Some will advocate for a dietary change, others will tell you to stop wearing deodorant, but no one really knows. Was it stress, processed food, genetics that prompted those nasty cells to metastasize? Maybe? So you move forward through life as if you’re all better, yet part of you knows you may not be, as so many anecdotal stories have taught you.\n\nIf you’re Julia Louis-Dreyfus, that means you strap yourself into Selina Meyer’s four-inch heels and body-con dresses and get back to set. Rather than ruminate over that which she can’t control, Louis-Dreyfus returned to the place she could: work. Even if it was too early in hindsight. “It was wonderful to go back because frankly, it was a distraction from the prior year, which had been so harrowing,” she says. “To put blinders on and just focus on making the funniest fucking show possible was a great relief.”\n\nTo many viewers and critics, she succeeded even beyond the high standards Veep had set in its previous six seasons, sending a show that began in the mid-Obama era fully through a Trump-age looking glass. This season featured anti-vaxxers; Chinese meddling in American electoral politics; and the federal investigation of a shady presidential nonprofit. Even its handling of women’s issues amid the #MeToo movement was perfectly on brand for Veep. Consider one of Louis-Dreyfus’s favorite moments, when a campaign staffer suggests an all-female presidential ticket. Meyer, a misogynist down deep, replies: “I don’t think so. The American people work hard for a living, okay. They don’t need that kind of bullshit.”\n\nSpencer Kornhaber of the Atlantic wrote, “At this point in the show’s run and our democracy’s wobbles, Veep doesn’t simply evoke real life. Real life inevitably evokes Veep.” My VANITY FAIR colleague Richard Lawson called it “meta-competency porn, the thrill of watching people be so good at the job of playing people so bad at theirs.”\n\nLouis-Dreyfus loves Veep, really loves it, for the challenges it presented, the people she was able to work with, and the product they were able to create: “The DNA of the show is that it has a fast-paced, authentic messiness. That’s not an easy thing to obtain believably,” she says. “And it had to be grounded in a kind of reality, so you didn’t think you were watching a cartoon. Even though a lot of the behavior was cartoonish.”\n\nPost-Veep Louis-Dreyfus’s efforts at rest haven’t been very successful. She’s trying mindfulness: “I realized I didn’t meditate this morning—like an asshole—but I should’ve because it’s useful.” Stillness, as you might gather, is not her strong suit: “I just need time to think. So I’m thinking, formulating my next move and shit like that. Which is fun but it also requires thought. And sometimes maybe no thought. Maybe [I need time] to just look at those flowers and think: Wow, that’s amazing. What a gorgeous arrangement.”\n\nHollywood does seem to be opening up to her in ways that accommodate her expanding ambitions—primarily delving into things that aren’t necessarily comedic. “I want to expand my creative universe here. I want to do stuff that maybe people wouldn’t think I would do,” she says. That means playing against her designated type: small screen, funny roles. Her turn opposite James Gandolfini in Enough Said demonstrated that desire, allowing her to make work out of the pain she associated with sending her two grown sons off to college. Her dramatic vocabulary was also there at times in Veep, if you were paying attention, especially the moments when life isn’t going the way Meyer planned. After she loses the presidency in the season five episode “Kissing Your Sister,” we see her wandering the White House, lost and depressed, when she runs into an admiring tour group.\n\nHolofcener watches all of it with admiration, especially because Louis-Dreyfus’s staying power has run counter to the usual ageist, sexist rules of Hollywood. “Her career doesn’t seem to end,” she says. “It’s inspiring for all us old ladies, who think we have to quit after 55. I mean, first of all, not everyone looks like her and not everyone is as brilliant as she is, that’s for sure. But it’s great that she’s thriving, and it gives us all hope that we can thrive in our later years.” (“Later years,” she adds with a laugh. “Isn’t that sexy?”)\n\nHolofcener is hoping to direct Louis-Dreyfus again. Hale wants his friend to portray a cartoon heavy: “Selina was so atrocious, but then you loved her at the same time. And I think that makes a really good Disney villain.” Mandel is advocating for a more sinister role: a Marvel antagonist, an idea that sparks something in Louis-Dreyfus when I relay it to her. “Swinging around on wires and kicking people in the face,” she says with a laugh. “Shooting fire out of whatever you shoot fire out of. I would dig that.”\n\nBut that’s for another day. Today is about peace and flowers and maybe a bit of work. She races out of the restaurant with a doggie bag in hand. Mandel’s number is ringing on her phone.\n\n“We’ve got to go write something,” she says as she exits.\n\nJulia at rest may have to begin tomorrow.\n\n*HAIR BY RENATO CAMPORA; MAKEUP BY RACHEL GOODWIN; MANICURE BY EMI KUDO; ADDITIONAL HAIR BY MITCHELL CANTRELL; GROOMING BY MARCO DE SOUZA; PRODUCED ON LOCATION BY SHOTSIE PRODUCTIONS; FOR DETAILS, GO TO VF.COM/CREDITS\n\nMore Great Stories from Vanity Fair\n\n— Our September cover story: how Kristen Stewart keeps cool\n\n— The lowdown on Lion King’s billion-dollar haul\n\n— Why is Quentin Tarantino (supposedly) retiring from filmmaking?\n\n— What the surfer-mom influencers of Byron Bay reveal about our world\n\n— The horrors of Jeffrey Epstein’s private island\n\nLooking for more?
