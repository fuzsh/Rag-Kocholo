        "text": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus, famous for her roles on \"Seinfeld\" and HBO's \"Veep,\" is coming to Providence Sunday to screen a new film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival. But Louis-Dreyfus is not the star. Her father is.\n\nHe's coming to Providence, too.\n\nThe movie is a documentary called \"Generosity of Eye.\" It's about William Louis-Dreyfus, 83, a long-time art collector and former chairman of Louis Dreyfus Energy Services. He recently decided to use his art collection to help finance the Harlem Children's Zone. (The title of the film comes from painter Graham Nickson, who used it to describe William Louis-Dreyfus' approach to art.)\n\n\"My father's been collecting art for 50 years,\" Julia Louis-Dreyfus said in a phone interview Thursday. \"When he told me about his decision, I thought it was worth documenting. What we found out was so much more than met the eye â€” how he collected, how he forged relationships with artists ... he developed very deep and personal relationships with the artists in the collection.\"\n\nThe film is directed by Brad Hall, Julia Louis-Dreyfus' husband.\n\n\"When we first decided to make the movie it was mostly going to be pretty pictures about pretty pictures,\" he said. \"It became about Julia learning more about the Harlem Children's Zone and about her dad. We didn't realize how close he came to many of the artists he collected. He didn't collect for investment at all. He collected out of love for the art.\"\n\nThe Louis-Dreyfus collection, with more than 3,500 pieces, is valued at up to $50 million, depending on the vagaries of the art market.\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus said the bulk of the collection has been put into an endowment. As specific pieces become more valuable, they will be sold, so the Harlem Children's Zone will derive a continuous source of income. (She said she's not an art collector herself, although she admires her father's aesthetic.)\n\nLouis-Dreyfus said her father became aware of the Harlem Children's Zone when he saw a story on \"60 Minutes.\" The Children's Zone, started by Geoffrey Canada, is a nonprofit devoted to breaking the cycle of poverty among children in central Harlem through a continuum of programs, including parenting workshops, preschool classes and three charter schools.\n\n\"My father has always been a supporter of civil rights and educational opportunities for African-Americans,\" Louis-Dreyfus said.\n\nShe said one of the reasons for making the film is to create publicity for both the Harlem Children's Zone and the Louis-Dreyfus collection, as well as to highlight innovative forms of philanthropy.\n\nProducer for the \"Generosity of Eye\" was Rhode Island filmmaker Julie R. Snyder, who said she spends half the year in Providence and half in Los Angeles. She previously worked with Louis-Dreyfus on \"Picture Paris,\" a short film about a woman who becomes obsessed with Paris.\n\nSnyder said \"Generosity of Eye\" was shot in five days.\n\n\"Brad [Hall] is a creative genius,\" she said. \"You shoot, but then you have to spend a lot of time in the editing room to make it work.\"\n\nSnyder said she pushed to have Hall, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and William Louis-Dreyfus come to Providence for the Rhode Island International Film Festival.\n\n\"Nothing makes me happier than bringing Julia to Providence,\" she said. \"It's great for the city, great for the festival.\"\n\n\"Generosity of Eye\" will be shown Sunday at 4:45 p.m. at the Metcalf Auditorium, Chace Center, RISD Museum, 20 N. Main St., Providence. For information and tickets call (401) 861-4445 or go to www.film-festival.org.\n\nasmith@providencejournal.com\n\n(401) 277-7485\n\nOn Twitter: @asmith651"
