        "text": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus Finally Gets Her Star Turn in “Enough Said”\n\nThis is not how Hollywood careers are supposed to go. Everything we know about how the film industry treats women tells us that female actors are not supposed to work in television for 30 years and then get their first starring role in a movie at 52 years old. But that’s exactly what has happened…\n\n“Veep” – Season 2, Episode 1: “Midterms”\n\nLast season, as I reviewed and analyzed every episode of season one of Veep, I noted on more than one occasion that nothing much changed from episode to episode. Vice-President Selina Meyer continuously strove for relevance in the political arena. She was given several substantive issues to lead on, only to see POTUS downgrade her…\n\n“Veep” – Season 1, Episode 6: “Baseball”\n\nBecause Tony Hale spends much of “Baseball,’ the sixth episode of HBO’s “Veep,” awkwardly trying to impress his macho father and because there was a reference to “afternoon delight,” it was hard not to think of “Arrested Development.” Since AD is basically the funniest sitcom of all time, any show that finds itself compared to…\n\n“Veep” – Season 1, Episode 5: “Nicknames”\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus is always at her funniest when she’s pissed off. She can do a lot as an actress (she specializes in desperation), but her anger has a wonderfully madcap, absurd quality to it. In this regard, she has always been held back by the limits of network television. Here on HBO, she can let…\n\n“Veep” – Season 1, Episode 4: “Chung”\n\nThis was the week that I really started to like Selina Meyer. The fourth episode of “Veep” miraculously accomplished two things that are hugely important to creating a successful television narrative: it humanized its protagonist and raised the stakes. Last week, I wrote that “Veep” was going down a dangerous road by making Selina too…\n\n“Veep” – Season 1, Episode 3: “Catherine”\n\n“Veep” has a little bit of a problem. The world of politics is not a place that most people would like to be right now. Sure, there are still some young people who fantasize about making a difference in government, but most Americans are flat-out fed up with politicians. Currently, close to 80% of Americans…\n\n“Veep” – Season 1, Episode 2: “Frozen Yoghurt”\n\n“You guys live in your own little world with your heads stuck up your Capitol Hill asses.” – the frozen yogurt guy While I laughed several times during tonight’s second episode of “Veep,” HBO’s new comedy about a gaffe-prone vice-president, the episode basically rehashed the dynamic from pilot and added a few positive tweaks.
