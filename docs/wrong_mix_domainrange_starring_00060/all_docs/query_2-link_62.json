In 2017, she broke records for the most Emmys won by a single performer, as well as the most consecutive wins for a single role through her performance in Veep. This career highlight marked her eighth total acting win, tying Cloris Leachman's record. Most recently, The Kennedy Center awarded Louis-Dreyfus with the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in November, 2018. She has received a Golden Globe, a Television Critics Association award, a Peabody Award and the Charlie Chaplin Britannia Award for Excellence in Comedy.
