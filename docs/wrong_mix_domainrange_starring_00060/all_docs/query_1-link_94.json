        "text": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Stephen Colbert have a lot in common.\n\nThe comedic geniuses both come from privileged backgrounds, attended private schools and danced cotillion. They were theater majors at Northwestern, honed their skills at Second City in Chicago and had stints at \"Saturday Night Live.\" They are involved parents in long-term marriages.\n\nBut the most striking similarity on view Saturday night was their ability to improvise, to the delight of the 2,700 who packed the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark for the annual Montclair Film fundraiser. For nearly two hours, the two riffed off each other in an artful, effortless conversation that was by turns revealing, inspiring and hilarious.\n\nSome of the biggest laughs came when Colbert was forced to improvise, literally, after he accidentally broke a glass while mixing Louis-Dreyfus a Manhattan onstage. When he resorted to using their water mugs for the beverages, and his finger as a stirrer, Louis-Dreyfus quipped, \"You're one class act.\"\n\nIt was an easy segue into a discussion of Louis-Dreyfus' early training in improv, which she credits for her extraordinary success on \"SNL,\" \"Seinfeld\" and \"Veep.\"\n\nColbert, the host of CBS' “Late Night,” called her “the greatest comedic actor of our generation.\"\n\n\"My love of her work borders on chemical dependency,\" he said.\n\nImprov roots\n\nLouis-Dreyfus' career started about age 5, she said, when she put on plays for her mom (\"That's a tough audience,\" quipped Colbert) and continued with a neighborhood theater company called the University Players and a dance troupe called “Julia’s Umbrella People.” (When Colbert mangled the name later, she said, through mock-gritted teeth: \"Julia's Umbrella People. Get. It. Together.\")\n\nAmong her many early roles, she said, was that of Winnie the Pooh.\n\n“You had to tell us that you played the lead,” Colbert riffed.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus said she first realized she had comic potential during a fifth-grade play in which she was required to faint. When she did, the audience laughed.\n\nHoliday dining: Tasteful to tacky: North Jersey's most festive restaurants to visit during the holidays\n\nMilitary homecoming: Little Ferry welcomes home police officer from military service in Africa\n\n“I didn’t mean to get a laugh, but it didn’t bother me at all. I thought, 'Hmmmm, I’ll be repeating that again.' “ she said.\n\nShe joined Mee-ow, the prestigious improv comedy troupe at Northwestern, as a freshman.\n\n\"You and I auditioned and one of us got in, and it wasn't me,\" Colbert said.\n\n\"It was Winnie the Pooh,\" joked Dreyfus.\n\nMee-ow was where she learned to work in an ensemble of actors. It's also where she met her husband, Brad Hall.\n\n\"It informed everything going forward,\" she said. \"The very spirit of ensemble elevates the project. Ego is set aside for the greater good, for trying to create together. That gets my juices flowing as an actor.\"\n\n\"The secret to improv is called listening. You can't just be thinking about, 'What am I going to say next, how am I going to steal the thunder?' You're going to fail miserably in those circumstances.\n\n“You and I both know ‘Yes, and ... ‘\" Dreyfus said, referring to a basic improv acting technique.“You don't negate what your partner has said. It encourages the building up of trust and positivity ... blah blah blah.”\n\n'Brutal' experience at 'Saturday Night Live'\n\nAfter her junior year at Northwestern, Louis-Dreyfus went straight to \"SNL,\" but her three years there were less uplifting.\n\n\"I was incredibly naive,\" she said. \"I didn't understand how the dynamics of the place worked. It was very, very sexist. People were doing crazy drugs. I was oblivious; I just thought, 'Oh, wow, he's got a lot of energy.' \"\n\nMeeting \"Seinfeld\" creator Larry David was a silver lining to the \"brutal\" experience of \"SNL,\" Dreyfus said. \"We bonded because he was as miserable as I was. He would write these sketches and they would not see the light of day. I would go into his office and cry a lot.”\n\nHer time at \"SNL\" helped Louis-Dreyfus decide that she \"didn't have to walk and crawl through this kind of nasty glass if it’s not ultimately going to be fulfilling. I sort of applied the fun meter to every job I’ve had since.\"\n\nWhen, a couple of years later, David asked her to read for a part on \"The Seinfeld Chronicles,\" her \"fun meter\" responded.\n\nThe show was \"utterly different\" from the popular sitcoms of the time, like \"The Cosby Show\" and \"Cheers,\" Louis-Dreyfus said.\n\n\"There wasn't a beginning, middle and an end. The stories were completely bizarre.”\n\nBut \"Seinfeld\" almost didn't make it, she said. The pilot was initially picked up for only four episodes.\n\n\"We were on the verge of complete annihilation,\" she said.\n\nSaving 'Seinfeld'\n\nRick Blood, NBC's head of late-night programming, took the money out of his budget so \"Seinfeld\" could continue.\n\n\"They had to cut two Bob Hope specials,\" said Louis-Dreyfus.\n\n\"You took a special away from a 140-year-old man,\" joked Colbert.\n\n\"It's a dog-eat-dog world,\" retorted Dreyfus.\n\nThe only difficulty on the \"Seinfeld\" set was that all the laughing slowed down the filming, Louis-Dreyfus said.\n\n\"We loved that show more than people who were watching it loved that show,\" she said. \"Jerry's laughing the whole time. I mean, he can't act at all. And so he's got a huge smile on his face when anyone is saying anything. And if I looked at him and saw him doing that, then I would go up. It took a long time to shoot those things, because I was ruining all the takes.\"\n\nLouis-Dreyfus said she was “absolutely shocked” when \"Yada Yada\" became a cultural byword, and that people still ask her to shove them, dance for them and \"spare a square,\" all themes from episodes of \"Seinfeld\" that were shot more than 20 years ago.\n\nPlaying Selina Meyer\n\nColbert confessed to being \"not well when it comes to how much I love 'Veep.' \"\n\n“That show might quite possibly have saved my life,\" he said. \"I am so steeped in the show that I could probably take any line from any show and I could probably tell you what the next line is.\n\n\"I listen to it all the time. I put it on when I'm cooking. The patter is so great.\"\n\n\"You do know that it’s not a radio show,\" Louis-Dreyfus deadpanned.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus admitted that playing her \"Veep\" character is \"super-satisfying.\"\n\n\"It's like if you were 2 years old and you never, ever had to grow up and you have the whole world revolved around you and you need to get your way all the time and any mistake you make, somebody else made it, you didn't, and you get to do that in a middle-aged body? Forget it.\"\n\nColbert's slow road to stardom\n\nColbert took a bit longer than Louis-Dreyfus to achieve success. His two-week stint as a guest writer at \"SNL\" stretched to a month because of a “wonderful Montclairion\" named Steve Higgins, who found out Colbert had a new baby.\n\n\"I'll never not love him for giving me that extra two weeks of work,\" Colbert said. \"Because I was absolutely desperate, tear-your-hair-out-hide-from-your-wife-so-she-can't-see-that-you-realize-that-you-chose-the-wrong-profession. Because no one will hire you.\"\n\nBag ban: Paper or plastic? How about neither, as New Jersey moves closer to bag ban\n\nEssex: Essex County Sheriff's Office to disband K-9 unit by 2020 to cut costs\n\nColbert said he auditioned for everything that came to Chicago between 1986 and 1993, from “Ally McBeal” to “21 Jump Street,” and got “bupkis.”\n\n“I could not get arrested,\" he said. \"That’s why no one runs old tape of Stephen Colbert.\n\n“I actually started writing for myself, because nobody would trust me with their script. I said, ‘I guess I’ll have to do it. I’ll bet on me.’ ”\n\nFamily man\n\nDuring the question-and-answer period, Colbert responded to a question about managing career and family. He said he had been heading home to Montclair after taping the show “Strangers With Candy” when he thought of lyrics from the Beck song “Jack-Ass”: \"I’ve been drifting along in the same stale shoes/Loose ends tying a noose in the back of my mind.\"\n\n“That’s how I felt about the way I put my family second, and I vowed to do my best not to do it again,” he said.\n\nA question about whether Colbert ever thought his work in entertainment was \"not enough” gave him an opportunity to explain his philosophy.\n\n“I don’t necessarily think that what I do changes minds or changes politics,\" he said. \"I do think it helps people who are worried or anxious to be relieved of their anxiety.\n\n“People who don’t want you to perceive reality envelop you, like an abusive relationship, in fear, so the only reality is their reality,\" he said. \"If you’re not afraid, it’s your reality. If you’re not afraid you can think.”\n\nThe final question was: “What lessons or thoughts do you hope real-world politicians take from your work?”\n\n\"I think it's OK to say you made a mistake,\" Louis-Dreyfus said. \"People seem to be running in fear from that idea. I think there's common ground here, because we all do it, of course.\"\n\nColbert had a short answer and then a longer one.\n\n“It’s sort of simple,” he said. “Don’t lie. It’s a heresy.\n\n\"As a Catholic I was raised that heresy is the worst sin, because not only are you committing a sin, but you're convincing everybody else to join in the sin.\n\n\"And so especially what is happening right now, when you lie to us, when you try to say that this isn't reality, the reality is what I'm gonna spin, you're dragging us into a heresy against reality, and I think that's the greatest sin you can do, because you have to look reality in the face if you're going to make anything better.\"\n\nJulia Martin covers Montclair for NorthJersey.com.
