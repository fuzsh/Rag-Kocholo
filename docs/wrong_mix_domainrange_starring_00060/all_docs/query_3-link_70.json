        "text": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus is taking on her most sinister co-star yet: death itself.\n\nThe actress, who recently starred in the A24 indie “You Hurt My Feelings,” plays a grieving mother in another A24 film, the upcoming “Tuesday.” Written and directed by Daina O. Pusić, “Tuesday” centers on a parent (Louis-Dreyfus) and her teenage daughter (Lola Petticrew) as they confront Death when it arrives in the form of an astonishing talking parrot. The film marks Pusić’s directorial debut.\n\nIn the trailer, Louis-Dreyfus’ character tries to connect with her ailing daughter while discussing modern dating. However, she can’t see the bird that her daughter speaks with as she is ushered to the other side. The film is a BBC Films co-production.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus previously shut down rumors of a possible “Seinfeld” reunion and is set to appear in the continued phase of the MCU after making her debut in “Falcon and the Winter Soldier” Disney+ series.\n\nAnd speaking of streaming services, meanwhile A24 has a new partnership with Max. As announced in December 2023, A24 and HBO inked a multiyear deal for the studio’s theatrical movies to run exclusively on HBO and Cinemax, and stream only on Max. The deal also extended A24’s 2022 licensing agreement with Max for more than two dozen previously released films. Oscar-nominated films “Past Lives” and “The Zone of Interest” will be available on Max, with “Priscilla,” “Dream Scenario,” and “The Iron Claw” also streaming along with 100 other films.\n\nLooking ahead, upcoming A24 movies include Darren Aronofsky’s Elon Musk biopic, Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson’s erotic thriller two-hander “Babygirl,” Kristen Stewart in 2024 Sundance queer romance “Love Lies Bleeding,” Alex Garland’s “Civil War,” and Benny Safdie’s solo directorial debut starring Dwayne Johnson as a real-life WWE fighter. The production company also recently released a surprise documentary from Joelle Chesselet and Oscar-winning “My Octopus Teacher” documentarian Pippa Ehrlich, who co-directed “My Mercury” about the sole resident on Mercury Island who set out to bring 15,000 seals off the island and have the land be reclaimed by the critically endangered seabirds of the South Atlantic.\n\n“Tuesday” premieres in summer 2024. Check out the trailer below."
