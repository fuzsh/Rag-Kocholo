        "text": "NEW YORK (WABC) -- Julia Louis-Dreyfus has made a career out of making us laugh - however, in her latest film, she is taking a dramatic turn.\n\n\"Tuesday\" delves into the depths of death as Louis-Dreyfus plays a mother whose daughter is terminally ill.\n\nWhen she struggles to acknowledge the inevitable, death arrives in the form of a giant talking macaw.\n\nThe film is directed by Daina Pusic and also stars Lola Petticrew as Louis-Dreyfus' teenage daughter, Tuesday.\n\n\"That's what struck me about the material, the pull of the bond between parent and child,\" Louis-Dreyfus said. \"And then of course the exploration of grief and loss and denial and anger that the movie explores in a fantastical way that I think makes the conversations around these issues palatable, because it is so fantastical. And it was an opportunity to do something really dramatic.\"\n\nThe film was a departure for Louis-Dreyfus, who along with Petticrew, delivers a powerful performance.\n\n\"Yes, I wrote it, and I directed it, but it just became a beast on of its own, and it went from being something very specific to me to becoming more and more universal and had more to do with just everyone's grief a universal take on what grief and pain and connection and love is,\" Pusic said. \"I felt like I was speaking to the audience.\"\n\n----------\n\n* Get Eyewitness News Delivered\n\n* Follow us on YouTube\n\n* More local news\n\n* Send us a news tip\n\n* Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts\n\nSubmit a tip or story idea to Eyewitness News"
