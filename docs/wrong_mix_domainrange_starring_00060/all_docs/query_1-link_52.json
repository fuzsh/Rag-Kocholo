        "text": "If love means never having to say you're sorry, what are you supposed to do with all of the hurt feelings that will inevitably arise in any relationship? In writer-director Nicole Holofcener's newest observational comedy, Beth (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a novelist, finds herself out of sorts when she overhears her husband (Tobias Menzies) share his unfiltered review of her new book.\n\nYou Hurt My Feelings marks a reunion between the filmmaker (an Oscar nominee for Best Adapted Screenplay for 2018's Can You Ever Forgive Me?) and Louis-Dreyfus after 2013's Enough Said, the winning rom-com which also starred the late James Gandolfini. Their latest collaboration also stars Michaela Watkins, Arian Moayed, Jeannie Berlin, and Owen Teague.\n\n\"After Enough Said, I found Julia becoming somewhat of a muse for me,\" Holofcener says. \"Of course, it's really inspiring to picture a genius actor saying your words when you're writing. But I also knew she could evoke all the subtlety of Beth's self-searching, as well as play the more comedic side the way only she can. In my writing, there's never drama without some comedy, and vice versa â€” and that's also true of Julia's approach.\"\n\nFor Louis-Dreyfus' part, she says, \"For me, working with Nicole is sublime, because her microscopic view of human behavior is such a delicious experience for an actor. When we made Enough Said, it was like why haven't we done this before? And then, when she told me the germ of the idea for this film, it hit me right where I live. I knew it was going to touch on things that I could really sink my teeth into.\"\n\nYou Hurt My Feelings opens in theaters on May 26.
