        "text": "Henry Warren Beaty (born March 30, 1937) is an American actor, producer, screenwriter and director.[1] He has been nominated for 15 Academy Awards.[2] He won the Best Director Award.[2] He has been nominated for 16 Golden Globe Awards and won six. Beatty was nominated for four Oscars for Heaven Can Wait.[3] He won an Oscar for Reds.[3]\n\nEarly life\n\n[change | change source]\n\nBeatty was born in Richmond, Virginia. His mother was Canadian teacher Kathlyn Corinne and doctor Ira Owens. He was raised in Arlington, Virginia. His older sister is actress Shirley MacLaine. He studied at Northwestern University for a year from 1954 through 1955.\n\nBeatty enlisted in the California Air National Guard on February 11, 1960 under his original name, Henry W. Beaty.[4] On January 1, 1961, Beatty was discharged from the Air National Guard due to physical disability.\n\nBeatty started his career making appearances on television shows such as Studio One (1957), Kraft Television Theatre (1957), and Playhouse 90 (1959). He was a semi-regular on The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis during its first season (1959–60). Beatty made his movie debut in Elia Kazan's Splendor in the Grass (1961), opposite Natalie Wood.\n\nIn 1967, when he was 28, he produced and acted alongside Faye Dunaway and Gene Hackman in Bonnie and Clyde. It was a critical and commercial success, and was nominated for ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor, and seven Golden Globe Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor.\n\nAfter Bonnie and Clyde, Beatty acted with Elizabeth Taylor in The Only Game in Town (1970), directed by George Stevens; McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971), directed by Robert Altman; Dollars (1971), directed by Richard Brooks; The Parallax View (1974), directed by Alan J. Pakula; and The Fortune (1975), directed by Mike Nichols.\n\nBeatty starred in Reds (1981), an historical epic about American Communist journalist John Reed who observed the Russian October Revolution.[5] Beatty won the Golden Globe Award for Best Director.\n\nFollowing Reds, Beatty did not appear in a movie for five years until 1987's Ishtar, written and directed by Elaine May.[6]\n\nBeatty produced, directed and played the title role as comic strip based detective Dick Tracy in the 1990 movie of the same name. The movie received critical acclaim and was one of the highest-grossing movies of the year.[7] It received seven Academy Award nominations, winning three for Best Art Direction, Best Makeup, and Best Original Song.[8] It also received four Golden Globe Award nominations, including Best Motion Picture.[9] In 1998, he wrote, produced, directed and starred in the political satire Bulworth, which was critically acclaimed and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.[10]\n\nFollowing the very bad box office performance of Town & Country (2001), in which Beatty starred, he did not appear in or direct another movie for 15 years.\n\nIn 2016, Beatty returned to acting and directing in the movie Rules Don't Apply, which was about a fake romance story about Howard Hughes.[11]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[change | change source]\n\nBeatty has been married to actress Annette Bening since 1992. They have four children. His eldest son Stephen Ira came out as transgender in 2006.[12]\n\nBeatty is a longtime supporter of the Democratic Party. In 1972, Beatty was part of the \"inner circle\" of Senator George McGovern's presidential campaign.\n\nYear Film Role Notes 1961 Splendor in the Grass Bud Stamper Golden Globe for Best New Star - Actor\n\nNominated - Golden Globe for Best Actor The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone Paolo di Leo 1962 All Fall Down Berry-Berry Willart 1964 Lilith Vincent Bruce 1965 Mickey One Mickey One Promise Her Anything Harley Rummell 1966 Kaleidoscope Barney Lincoln 1967 Bonnie and Clyde Clyde Barrow David di Donatello Award for Best Actor\n\nPhotoplay Award for Best Actor\n\nPhotoplay Award for Best Film\n\nGolden Laurel Award for Best Action-Drama\n\nKansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film\n\nNominated – Academy Award for Best Actor\n\nNominated – Academy Award for Best Picture\n\nNominated - Golden Globe for Best Picture\n\nNominated – Golden Globe for Best Actor\n\nNominated – BAFTA for Best Actor\n\nNominated - National Society of Film Critics for Best Film 1970 The Only Game in Town Joe Grady 1971 McCabe & Mrs. Miller John McCabe $ Joe Collins 1974 The Parallax View Joseph Frady 1975 Shampoo George Roundy WGA Award for Best Screenplay\n\nNational Society of Film Critics Award for Best Screenplay\n\nNominated – Academy Award for Best Screenplay\n\nNominated – Golden Globe for Best Actor\n\nNominated - Golden Globe for Best Picture The Fortune Nicky Wilson 1978 Heaven Can Wait Joe Pendleton Golden Globe for Best Picture\n\nGolden Globe for Best Actor\n\nWGA Award for Best Screenplay\n\nSaturn Award for Best Film\n\nSaturn Award for Best Actor\n\nSaturn Award for Best Writing\n\nNominated – Academy Award for Best Actor\n\nNominated – Academy Award for Best Picture\n\nNominated – Academy Award for Best Director\n\nNominated – Academy Award for Best Screenplay\n\nNominated – DGA Award for Best Director\n\nNominated – Saturn Award for Best Direction 1981 Reds John Reed Academy Award for Best Director\n\nDGA Award for Best Director\n\nGolden Globe for Best Director\n\nWGA Award for Best Screenplay\n\nDavid di Donatello for Best Producer\n\nLos Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Director\n\nNew York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film\n\nNational Board of Review Award for Best Director\n\nNational Board of Review Award for Top Ten Film\n\nAmerican Movie Award for Excellence in Film\n\nNominated – Academy Award for Best Actor\n\nNominated – Academy Award for Best Picture\n\nNominated – Academy Award for Best Screenplay\n\nNominated – Golden Globe for Best Actor\n\nNominated – Golden Globe for Best Screenplay\n\nNominated - Golden Globe for Best Picture\n\nNominated – BAFTA for Best Actor\n\nNominated - Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Film\n\nNominated - Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Screenplay 1987 Ishtar Lyle Rogers 1990 Dick Tracy Dick Tracy Nominated - Golden Globe for Best Picture\n\nNominated - Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists Award for Best Director\n\nNominated - Saturn Award for Best Actor\n\nNominated - Saturn Award for Best Film 1991 Bugsy Bugsy Siegel Golden Globe for Best Picture\n\nLos Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Film\n\nNational Board of Review Award for Best Actor\n\nNational Board of Review for Top Ten Film\n\nNominated – Academy Award for Best Actor\n\nNominated – Academy Award for Best Picture\n\nNominated – Golden Globe for Best Actor\n\nNominated - Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor\n\nNominated - New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor\n\nNominated - National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor 1994 Love Affair Mike Gambril 1998 Bulworth Sen.
