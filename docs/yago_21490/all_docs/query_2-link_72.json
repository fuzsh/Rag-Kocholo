Iâ€™d rave about Nicholson, the extraordinary color palette, and some of the thorny ideas that it tangles with.\n\nFull Review | Feb 7, 2023\n\nall the richer and more meaningful because it is not static history, but rather a grenade of genuine political passion lobbed into an era of increasing conservatism and military build-up-an elegy for an ideal\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jan 6, 2022\n\nThe wait is excruciating, but the final convergence of the leads' periodically disparate paths is emotionally overwhelming - in a good way.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 9/10 | Mar 24, 2021\n\nGiven the impeccable production values, first-rate performances and epic proportions, the movie's just not as intriguing or involving as it should have been.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | May 27, 2020\n\nHere is a three and one-half hour docudrama that is claustrophobically filled with ceaseless political rhetoric and mixed with a limp, unpersuasive love story.\n\nFull Review | May 7, 2020\n\nBeatty has come up with a rich, remarkably balanced portrait of a fascinating episode in American radical politics, and the love story that rode its crest like a tiny boat braving a turbulent sea.\n\nFull Review | Feb 27, 2020\n\nReds seems like what we'd now call Oscar bait, with its epic love triangle of powerhouse stars set amid the backdrop of a massive historic moment, but the details keep it far from that.\n\nFull Review | Sep 24, 2019\n\nDespite its impeccable credentials, Reds is an overlong, often boring epic that can't decide where to focus the story.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/5 | Dec 17, 2018\n\nIf no one will learn much about politics from this film, Beatty has nonetheless put the fire of two burning lives in it. There is plenty in it about the risks that commitment entails, but it is about commitment.\n\nFull Review | Jan 8, 2018\n\nVittorio Storaro, who won an Oscar for his cinematography, keeps the long film moving at a healthy pace, mixing static shots with subtle camera movement, never showing off or detracting from the story.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/4 | Aug 5, 2007\n\nan epic love story ... As a teenager I saw it four times in the theater (which I now find pretty astonishing, considering the movie is well more than three hours long -- I had a lot more free time in 1981!)\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/4 | Jan 12, 2007"
