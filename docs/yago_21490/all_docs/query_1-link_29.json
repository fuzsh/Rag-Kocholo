        "text": "Director: Warren Beatty\n\nEntertainment grade: A–\n\nHistory grade: A–\n\nJohn Reed was an American journalist who witnessed the October revolution in Russia in 1917.\n\nSex\n\nEarnest leftie Jack Reed (Warren Beatty) meets earnest leftie Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton) in Portland, Oregon, late in 1915. He impresses her with his thoughts on the profit motive in the first world war, somewhat anticipating Lenin's Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism, written a few months later. This was exactly the way to an earnest leftie's heart in the 1910s, and if only Reed had said something more specific about dialectical materialism it would probably have been pants off straight away. As it is, that takes them until the second date. \"I'd like to see you with your pants off, Mr Reed,\" says Bryant. Aha, there we go.\n\nPeople\n\nReed persuades Bryant to follow him to New York, where they meet the film's two most shameless scene-stealers. First, there's Maureen Stapleton, doing a wickedly enjoyable turn as no-nonsense anarchist Emma Goldman. \"What do you write about?\" Goldman asks Bryant. \"Oh, everything,\" she replies nervously. \"You write about everything?\" Goldman snaps. \"Everything, yes,\" stammers Bryant. \"Everything … nothing, huh. Just…\" Goldman gives her a look that could flay the hide off a rhinoceros. Second, there's Jack Nicholson as bilious playwright and future Nobel laureate Eugene O'Neill. Actually, he's more or less just playing Jack Nicholson, but he is awfully good at that – and the quick-witted screenplay gives him plenty of brutal O'Neillish lines to snarl.\n\nRomance\n\nBryant is fleetingly seduced by O'Neill. In real life, she was not quite so ingenuous. In fact, it was she who seduced O'Neill, telling him untruthfully that Reed was seriously ill and they were no longer in a sexual relationship. Reportedly it is true, as portrayed here, that O'Neill fell hopelessly in love with her. That would be easier to believe if Reds allowed her more of the confidence and audacity she had in real life.\n\nPolitics\n\nAfter the action-packed first half, ending on the high of the October revolution, it's a slight disappointment that the film's second half begins with the internecine struggle between the American Socialist Party, the Communist Labor Party and the Communist Party of America. If you've seen Monty Python's Life of Brian, this is a lot like the schism between the People's Front of Judea and the Judean People's Front, only with no one hawking a tray of otters' noses.\n\nIdeology\n\nThe action picks up again as Reed returns to the Soviet Union. Emma Goldman is already there, and disillusioned with the Soviet project. That's convenient for the screenwriters, but it's also true. \"The situation is such that we are now going through the deepest spiritual conflict in our lives,\" she wrote to a friend at the time. Nor does Reed arrive in the glorious socialist paradise he expected. Instead, he finds food and fuel shortages, and the head of the Comintern, Grigory Zinoviev (Jerzy Kosinski), imperturbably eating a lemon. Zinoviev effectively kidnaps Reed and puts him to propaganda work. This, too, is accurate, as is the film's depiction of his doomed attempt to escape.\n\nLove\n\nBryant sets out on an odyssey from the US to the USSR to find her husband. The audience's sympathies for Reed are undiminished by the fact that he had an affair with a Russian woman, because the film tactfully leaves that out. Furthermore, the tension has been ramped up by its claim that communication between Reed and Bryant was impossible, whereas in real life they did correspond and he knew she was coming. Still, though Reds fiddles with the details, the political and emotional situations portrayed have been impressively well researched. Without spoiling the end, it too is correct – well, almost.\n\nVerdict\n\nAn engrossing, beautifully filmed and remarkably balanced portrait of a fascinating moment in history, cleverly enhanced by the intercutting of real-life documentary interviews. Reds is everything a historian could want in a movie."
