        "text": "Warren Beatty has been making a name for himself in the film world from the time he was a young actor. Today, he’s known for both his work in front of the camera, as well as behind it.\n\nAfter a year spent at Northwestern University, the actor, who is the brother of famed actress Shirley MacLaine, made the leap to New York City to pursue acting, his first credit coming in 1957 in an episode of Kraft Theatre. He continued to take on television roles in the subsequent years, including one on The Many Loves of Dobby Gills, before his debut film role in Splendor in the Grass (1961).\n\nHowever, it wasn’t until 1967’s Bonnie and Clyde that he got the recognition he deserved, the film earning 10 Academy Award nominations.\n\nAfter Bonnie and Clyde, the actor enjoyed continued success, celebrated for his work in films like Shampoo (1975), Heaven Can Wait (1978) and Reds (1981), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Director — talk about range!\n\nSince then, the actor has stayed booked and busy at 87 years old. In 2016, he wrote, directed and starred in the film Rules Don’t Apply.\n\nHere, take a walk down memory lane at these retro photos of Warren Beatty young.\n\n1974: Warren takes off\n\nIn this still from the 1974 film Shampoo, Beatty rides off on a motorcycle while playing the part of George Roundy, a Beverly Hills hairdresser.\n\n1961: Beatty and Collins\n\nWarren Beatty is pictured alongside Joan Collins in this 1961 photograph.

Look at the way wood stuns in that fur shawl — Talk about true Hollywood glamour!\n\n1962: Posing for a portrait\n\nIt’s truly no surprise that the famed actor became as popular as he did.
