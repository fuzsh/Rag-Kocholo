Razor & Tie Entertainment is releasing the disk (formerly a Columbia Records lp release), which features two pieces of music Stephen Sondheim composed for the film: \"Goodbye For Now\" and \"Marriage Proposal.\" \"Goodbye For Now,\" the main theme, both opens and closes the disk, with flautist Jean-Pierre Rampal guesting on the first version. \"Marriage Proposal\" is arranged by Jonathan Tunick.\n\nDave Grusin is credited with \"additional music\" on the soundtrack (in fact, he has sole credit on seven tracks). Other songs are either traditional or popular tunes from the era.\n\nFor information on the \"Reds\" release, due in stores April 27, check out Razor & Tie's website: http://www.razorandtie.com."
