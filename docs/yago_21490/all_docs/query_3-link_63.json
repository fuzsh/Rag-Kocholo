        "text": "STAR filmmaker Warren Beatty is often considered a living legend in the motion picture industry.\n\nWhether it's for his career in front of the camera or his life behind the scenes, Warren is the subject of several headlines.\n\nWho is Warren Beatty?\n\nWarren Beatty is a Hollywood legend who rose to prominence during the 1960s.\n\nThe younger brother of actress Shirley MacLaine, Warren made his cinematic debut starring alongside Natalie Wood and Pat Hingle in the 1961 film, Splendor in the Grass.\n\nThroughout the decade, he appeared in The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone, Lilith, All Fall Down, and Bonnie & Clyde.\n\nPop culture fans recognize Warren and Shirley as two of the key actors of the New Hollywood movement that swept the media business from the 1960s through the early 1980s.\n\nHe continued acting throughout the 1980s and beyond.\n\nThe actor's film credits include The Only Game in Town, Shampoo, Heaven Can Wait, and Dollars.\n\nAside from his on-screen portrayals, Warren is also a highly acclaimed director, producer, and screenwriter.\n\nThe filmmaker's directing credits are for the movies Dick Tracy, Bugsy, Reds, and Rules Don't Apply.\n\nIs Warren married and does he have children?\n\nOn March 3, 1992, Warren - who was 54 at the time - and actress Annette Bening tied the knot.\n\nThe two entered a relationship after starring together in the 1991 crime motion picture, Bugsy.\n\nTogether, the married couple has four children - Stephen, Benjamin, Isabel, and Ella.\n\nWarren told AARP of his family life with Annette: \"I always knew I wanted to have children.\"\n\n\"I wanted to do it well, and I wanted to do it with someone who felt the same way.\"\n\nHe added: \"My delay in forming a family, marriage, was that I felt, or maybe I would say feared, that there was an element of impermanence to relationships that were somewhat new.\"\n\n\"It's a luxury to spend time with your family. And I was always mulling projects.\"\n\n\"I'm an attentive father, I have to struggle somewhat not to be overly attentive.\"\n\n\"I want to see the world through the eyes of my children.\"\n\nWhat is Warren Beatty's net worth?\n\nIn 1965, Warren founded his own motion picture production company, Tatira Productions.\n\nThrough Tatira, Warren directed and produced Bonnie & Clyde, Rules Don't Apply, Dick Tracy, and Reds.\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, the star actor amassed an estimated fortune of $70million from his Hollywood career.\n\nFor his work on the 1981 cinematic production, Reds, he won the Best Director Oscar at the 54th Academy Awards."
