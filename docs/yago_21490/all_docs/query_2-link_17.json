        "text": "Part of Weekend Classics\n\nIn 1915, married journalist and suffragist Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton) encounters leftist firebrand John Reed (Warren Beatty) at a lecture and is swept away by his passionate idealism. When she reluctantly strikes up a relationship with him and eventually joins Reed in New York’s Greenwich Village with its bustling, progressive art scene, the two become inseparable. However, tumultuous politics and Reed’s unflinching commitment to the cause force them apart for long stretches of time. As John reports on the burgeoning Bolshevik revolution, his work takes him further and further from Louise — and the two must balance their ideals with their love for one another in this epic historical romance.\n\nBased on the lives of the real Bryant and Reed — who wrote his firsthand account of the rise of Russian communism in the much-lauded Ten Days That Shook the World — Beatty frames his reimagining with documentary interviews from the people who knew the couple. The film offers snapshots of the era’s political and artistic upheaval including foundational moments in the American labor movement — and features outstanding appearances by Jack Nicholson as a slimy Eugene O’Neil, novelist Jerzy Kosinski as Bolshevik leader Gregory Zinoviev, and the brilliant Maureen Stapelton who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her depiction of anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman.\n\nWhile the film made quite an impact upon its initial release, a new 4K restoration gives us a chance to appreciate the earnest depiction of Keaton’s long-suffering, but rarely wavering partner to Beatty’s relentlessly obsessive radical."
