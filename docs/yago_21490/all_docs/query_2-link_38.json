        "text": "Hollywood icon Warren Beatty (The Parallax View, McCabe & Mrs. Miller) co-wrote, directed and starred in this film about the life of John Reed, the American journalist and author who covered the 1917 Russian Revolution with his book, “Ten Days That Shook the World.” The film chronicles Reed’s life and work as he meets Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton, The Godfather, Annie Hall). The two fall in love and become deeply involved with the Greenwich Village art and activism scene, where they get in with the likes of famed author and anarchist Emma Goldman (Maureen Stapleton, Cocoon, Interiors) and playwright Eugene O’Neill (Jack Nicholson, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Prizzi’s Honor). Inspired by the ideas behind the Revolution, Reed attempts to bring the spirit of Communism back to the United States after growing disillusioned living in Russia. The film features a fantastic supporting cast, including appearances from Edward Herrmann, Paul Sorvino, M. Emmet Walsh, Brenda Currin, William Daniels, Jerry Hardin and Gene Hackman. It was nominated for a staggering 12 Academy Awards and won 3—Beatty was awarded Best Director, Maureen Stapleton took home Best Supporting Actress, and Vittorio Storaro (Apocalypse Now, Dick Tracy) won for Best Cinematography. The film also has the privilege of being one of only two motion pictures ever graced with a score by the legendary Stephen Sondheim—the other was Alan Resnais’ Stavisky, which we’ll play in February.\n\nTickets: $10 (members), $15 (nonmembers), $12 (seniors)"
