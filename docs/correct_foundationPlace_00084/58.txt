HEAD OVER HEELS TO PERFORM AT BERKELEY PLAYHOUSE

Performances begin May 24, 2024

BERKELEY (April 9, 2024) – Berkeley Playhouse continues its 2023/24 Season with the musical Head Over Heels, performing May 24 to June 30, 2024.

Head Over Heels includes the following credits: Original Book by Jeff Whitty; Adaptation by James Magruder; Music and Lyrics by The Go-Go’s; Directed by Mel Martinez; Music Directed by Michael Patrick Wiles; and Choreographed by Kevin Gruwell.

ABOUT HEAD OVER HEELS:

Pop rock meets poetic prose in this 16th century musical comedy about a royal family's exploration of love, friendship, gender, and sexuality as they search for their missing "beat" to the tunes of the 1980's all- female rock band The Go-Go's! From the visionaries behind Hedwig and the Angry Inch, Avenue Q, and Spring Awakening, and featuring songs like “We Got the Beat,” “Our Lips Are Sealed,” and “Vacation,” audiences will get swept up into this fiercely fun love story!

FROM THE DIRECTOR:

“I am really excited to delve into the theme of self-acceptance that Head Over Heels highlights,” said Director Mel Martinez. “To speak your truth is scary, but when you are truly yourself, everything looks better—even tastes better! It's like being in love. I also love these characters to bits! This beautiful adventure they go on helps them break the molds society is comfortable with, and I find that inspiring.”

RENT TO PERFORM AT BERKELEY PLAYHOUSE

Performances begin February 23, 2024

BERKELEY (January 9, 2024) – Berkeley Playhouse continues its 2023/24 Season with the musical Rent, performing February 23 to March 31, 2024.

Rent’s book, music, and lyrics are by Jonathan Larson. Rent is directed by Kimberly Dooley, assistant directed by Peet Cocke, music directed by Michael Patrick Wiles, and choreographed by Mel Martinez.

ABOUT RENT:

Set in the East Village of New York City, Rent is about falling in love, finding your voice, and living for today. Winner of the Tony Award for Best Musical and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, Rent has become a pop cultural phenomenon, featuring songs that rock and a meaningful story that resonates with audiences. Based loosely on Puccini's La Boheme, Jonathan Larson's Rent follows a year in the life of a group of impoverished young artists and musicians struggling to survive and create in New York's Lower East Side, under the shadow of HIV/AIDS. How these young bohemians negotiate their dreams, loves and conflicts provides the narrative thread to this groundbreaking musical.

“This show is a celebration of LIVING—of passion, creativity, justice, friendship—all in the midst of loss, disease, and hardship,” said Director Kimberly Dooley. “I’m deeply touched by the beating heart of hard-won resiliency that sings throughout the whole show. It's a choice to keep LIVING - to keep fighting for joy and connection and meaning while staying authentic to the very real, heartbreaking truths of life and loss all around us. Rent reminds us to keep connecting to our heart until our very last breath, even when it's scary and even when it's hard. We only have this one fragile, beautiful life, after all.”

CINDERELLA ENCHANTED TO PERFORM AT BERKELEY PLAYHOUSE

Performances begin November 3, 2023

BERKELEY (October 13, 2023) – Berkeley Playhouse continues its 2023/24 Season with the delightful musical Cinderella Enchanted, performing November 3 to December 22, 2023.

Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella Enchanted features Music by Richard Rodgers, Book and Lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II, is Adapted for the Stage by Tom Briggs, from the Teleplay by Robert L. Freedman.

Cinderella Enchanted is Directed and Choreographed by Khalia Davis, Vocal Directed by Erika Oba, and Conducted by Jessica Igarashi.

ABOUT CINDERELLA ENCHANTED:

Inspired by the acclaimed 1997 teleplay starring Brandy and Whitney Houston, this version of the magical fairy tale is reborn with the Rodgers & Hammerstein hallmarks of originality, charm and elegance. The prince is having a ball and all eligible young women in the kingdom are invited for a chance at their happily ever after. After meeting the beautiful Cinderella, the two share a dance but Cinderella runs away before her fairy godmother’s magic wears off, leaving a single glass slipper. The prince must seek out the owner of the shoe and be reunited with his true love so they can both achieve an enchanting fairytale ending.

A FAIRYTALE CLASSIC WITH A BAY AREA TWIST:

Berkeley Playhouse’s production of Cinderella Enchanted will feature a fun spin on the popular tale. Cinderella is a free-spirited Berkeley artist and Prince Christopher is a wealthy Silicon Valley romantic, both wishing for their happily ever after. Berkeley Playhouse is excited to present this fairytale classic featuring a modern and magical Bay Area twist.

“[The 1997 movie] was really iconic and it set the bar for what is possible when you do musicals that are magical in that way,” said Director and Choreographer Khalia Davis. “[It was important that] audiences who are very familiar with that particular version see that reflected on the stage…I’m really excited about the fact that we get to honor and celebrate being able to see Prince Christopher’s life as well as Cinderella’s and that parallel life they are living. Cinderella is this aspiring writer who is fascinated by the world and Christopher is equally fascinated by the world but wants to know what he can do to make a positive impact that is outside of being married or born into royalty…I can’t wait for audiences to experience our version of Cinderella.”

KINKY BOOTS KICKS OFF 2023/24 SEASON AT BERKELEY PLAYHOUSE

Performances begin September 8, 2023

BERKELEY (August 9, 2023) – Berkeley Playhouse opens its 2023/24 Season with the Tony Award-winning musical Kinky Boots, performing September 8 to October 15, 2023.

ABOUT THE 2023/24 SEASON:

Berkeley Playhouse’s 2023/24 Season features four professional musicals on its MainStage, including Kinky Boots (September 8-October 15, 2023); Cinderella Enchanted (November 3-December 22, 2023); Rent (February 23-March 31, 2024); and Head Over Heels (May 24-June 30, 2024); as well as the YouthStage production of Mean Girls (July 13-21, 2024), performed by youth actors. Season Passes for the 2023/24 Season are available for purchase at Berkeleyplayhouse.org.

“When I think about every show [in this season], the word that comes to mind is ‘alive’,” said Artistic Director Kimberly Dooley. “Every show is bursting with aliveness—not only the joys and beauty of life, but the heartbreaks of life, too, and the struggles that we all go through.”

ABOUT KINKY BOOTS:

Kinky Boots features a book by Harvey Fierstein, music & lyrics By Cyndi Lauper, is directed and choreographed by William Thomas Hodgson, and music directed by Kenji Harada. Kinky Boots is the big-hearted musical extravaganza that won six Tonys including Best Musical, the Grammy for Best Musical Theatre album and London’s Olivier Award for Best Musical. Kinky Boots features a joyous, Tony-winning score by pop icon Cyndi Lauper, and a hilarious, uplifting book by four-time Tony winner, Harvey Fierstein.

Kinky Boots centers around Charlie Price, who has reluctantly inherited his father's failing shoe factory. Trying to live up to his father's legacy and save his family business, Charlie finds inspiration in the form of Lola, a fabulous entertainer in need of some sturdy stilettos. As they work to turn the factory around, this unlikely pair find that they have more in common than they realized...and discover that when you change your mind, you can change your whole world.

“It’s just a heartfelt, heartwarming show about community and that’s exactly what Berkeley Playhouse is about. It’s perfect,” said Director William Thomas Hodgson. “The vision is a celebration of queerness, a community in queerness. As representative as this show has been on Broadway, on the West End, and around the world, I feel like we have our own special sauce in Berkeley. The commodity of this show, the event of this show, is radical acceptance—this love through community, this love of one’s self, and of one’s own desires even.”

WORLD PREMIERE MUSICAL BECOMING ROBIN HOOD TO PERFORM AT BERKELEY PLAYHOUSE

Performances begin May 26, 2023

BERKELEY (April 20, 2023) – Berkeley Playhouse continues its 22/23 Season with Becoming Robin Hood, an all-new musical performing May 26 to June 25, 2023.

Becoming Robin Hood’s book is by Laura Marlin, with music and lyrics by Phil Gorman. Becoming Robin Hood is directed by Kimberly Dooley, music directed by Michael Patrick Wiles, and choreographed by Cat Reyes.

Becoming Robin Hood is a new musical created by Laura Marlin and Phil Gorman, local artists with longtime ties to Berkeley Playhouse. The musical was first workshopped with youth actors in Berkeley Playhouse’s 2022 YouthStage Season and later adapted for its 2022/23 MainStage Season to be performed by both adult and youth actors.

In this hilarious musical origin story for all ages, the citizens of Nottingham are hopeless…until a few unlikely characters take on the identity of a heroic outlaw who tries to redistribute the wealthy's riches. But is it right to steal? Sherwood Forest brings mystery and intrigue as accidents beget legends, friendships get tangled, and personal dreams grow to reality.

2022/2023 SEASON AT A GLANCE

Lin-Manuel Miranda's In the Heights | September 9, 2022 - October 16, 2022

(Press night: September 10)

Book by Quiara Alegría Hudes

Music and Lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda

From the musical theater sensation behind Hamilton comes this spirited Tony and Grammy Award-winning story packed full of the rhythms of salsa, soul, hip-hop, and R&B.

Usnavi de la Vega, the owner of a small bodega in New York’s Washington Heights, introduces us to a dynamic group of neighbors and friends chasing their dreams and struggling with the pressures of modern society. Set over the course of three scorching summer days, this panoramic snapshot of a vibrant community on the brink of change is an absolute must-see production.

Roald Dahl’s Matilda the Musical | November 4, 2022 - December 23, 2022

(Press night: November 5)

Book by Dennis Kelly

Music and Lyrics by Tim Minchin

Based on the book Matilda by Roald Dahl

This Tony and Olivier Award-winning musical based on the beloved children’s book is a captivating tale that revels in the anarchy of childhood, the power of imagination, and the inspiring story of a girl who dreams of a better life.

Matilda is a young girl living in England in the late 1980s. She has incredible wit, intelligence and psychokinetic powers, but is constantly underestimated by her family and bullied by the cruel headmistress, Miss Trunchbull. Matilda finds hope in her school teacher Miss Honey, who appreciates the child’s extraordinary personality. Will Matilda find the courage to stand up to her foes, changing her life and her pupils’ for the better?

Fun Home | February 24, 2023 - April 2, 2023

(Press night: February 25)

Book and Lyrics by Lisa Kron

Music by Jeanine Tesori

Based on the Graphic Novel by Alison Bechdel

Adapted from Alison Bechdel's groundbreaking graphic novel, Fun Home is a refreshingly honest, wholly original musical about seeing your parents through grown-up eyes.

When her father dies unexpectedly, graphic novelist Alison dives deep into her past to tell the story of the volatile, brilliant, one-of-a-kind man whose temperament and secrets defined her family and her life. Moving between past and present, Alison relives her unique childhood playing at the family’s Bechdel Funeral Home, her growing understanding of her own sexuality, and the looming, unanswerable questions about her father’s hidden desires.

Becoming Robin Hood | May 26, 2023 - July 2, 2023

(Press night: May 27)

Book by Laura Marlin

Music & Lyrics by Phil Gorman

This adventurous and hilarious new musical created by local artists explores a twist on the classic story of Robin Hood. In this musical version, a few citizens of Nottingham mistakenly take on the identity of a heroic outlaw while each sets out on high-stakes journeys.

We meet Wren, a powerhouse with big plans but no audience; Phoebe, Wren’s best friend who thinks she’ll follow her to the end; and Cooper, who longs to be good at just one thing, but just can’t figure out what that is. Sherwood Forest brings mystery and intrigue as accidents beget legends, friendships get tangled, and personal dreams grow to reality.

YouthStage Spotlight Show: Disney's Newsies | July 14 - July 23, 2023

Book by Harvey Fierstein

Music by Alan Menken

Lyrics by Jack Feldman

Based on the Disney Film written by Bob Tzudiker and Noni White

Berkeley Playhouse's YouthStage Spotlight Show is performed by talented youth actors in an elevated version of its YouthStage programming.

Seize the day with this jubilant story about fighting for what is right, based on the real-life Newsboys Strike of 1899. Jack Kelly, the charming leader of a group of young newsboys, rallies newsies from all over New York City to strike together in protest of rising distribution prices and unjust conditions.

This Tony-award winning musical from the composer who brought you Little Shop of Horrors and Sister Act and the writer behind Kinky Boots is a must-see show for the entire family!

BERKELEY (May 26, 2021) – Berkeley Playhouse is pleased to announce the addition of Melissa Rivera, a California-born Latina performer, educator, and theater professional to its full time staff. Rivera will join the Berkeley Playhouse leadership team as Producing Director of Education & Mainstage.

After an extensive search, Executive Artistic Director Kimberly Dooley, Managing Director Mary K. Lins, and the Berkeley Playhouse Board of Directors confidently selected Rivera as their choice for this new position.

For several months, the leaders of Berkeley Playhouse and its Board of Directors carefully constructed the role of the Producing Director and decided to combine both education and mainstage leadership.

Melissa’s guiding values of inclusion, justice, kindness, and professionalism will undoubtedly strengthen this organization, and I'm thrilled that she is joining our staff in a leadership position.”

Following a year of difficulties and uncertainties in the world and in the theater arts industry, the organization is thrilled to move into this hybrid format and announce Rivera’s addition.

“Melissa’s effervescent passion for theater performance and arts education will contribute to an exciting, dynamic, fresh chapter for Berkeley Playhouse.” Lins said of the new hire. “We’re delighted to welcome Melissa knowing her wisdom, determination, and oversight will be invaluable in helping Berkeley Playhouse’s artistic vision and educational goals come to fruition.”
