        "text": "Oklahoma City Community Foundation gave Lyric Theatre of Oklahoma a $4,000 grant to help restore and rebuild its website through the foundation's Capacity Building Program.\n\nLyric Theatre's primary goal through the Capacity Building Program grant was to redesign the Lyric Theatre website to become more interactive through the use of social media, online videos, photos and blogs. Lyric also aimed to increase enrollment of Academy classes by offering online course information and downloadable program curriculum, to boost online ticket sales, and to raise contributed support through online giving.\n\n\"Our new site gives us the opportunity to connect with our donors, patrons and supporters like we have never been able to do before,\" says Lyric Theatre's Director of Marketing, Danyel Siler. \"Without this grant Lyric would not have been able to make this vital update.\"\n\nSince the launch of the redesigned site in May 2010, funded by the generous grant from the Oklahoma City Community Foundation, Lyric Theatre has tracked a significant increase in traffic to the organization's website. Designed by Traction Marketing, the website truly reflects the professional quality of Lyric's productions and programs. The redesign also included several enhancements, allowing Lyric's ThElma Gaylord Academy to streamline online enrollment for the convenience of busy parents. The enhanced features have also led to an increase in online ticket sales and generated hits to the site through uploaded YouTube videos and social media outlets.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Community Foundation, the metropolitan area's non-profit charity, was founded in 1969 to work with individuals to meet the charitable needs of the community through the development and administration of permanent endowment funds for non-profit organizations, scholarships and other charities. Through its Community Program Grants, the Oklahoma City community Foundation funds, initiates and leads programs that benefit the community in the area of arts, education, health and human services, beautification and community development.\n\nComments\n\nTo post a comment, you must register and login.\n\nJoin Team BroadwayWorld\n\nAre you an avid theatergoer?
