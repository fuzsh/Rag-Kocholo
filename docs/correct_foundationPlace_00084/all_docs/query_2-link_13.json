The foundation is dedicated to helping families of missing individuals and educating the community on prevention of abduction, sexual abuse & trafficking.\n\nYes! I want to help keep the tragic deaths of Lyric and Elizabeth in the public eye to find justice, help families of missing individuals and help educate the community on prevention of abduction, sexual abuse & trafficking.\n\nWith all of us working together, we can accomplish great things. To volunteer or contribute to our fundraiser, send us a message. We will get back to you soon.\n\nA community healing project.\n\nIf you haven't been to Angels Park, check out the video for a glimpse of its beauty, peace and serenity.\n\nMade especially in the memory of Lyric and Elizabeth by our good friend Bill Dedic."
