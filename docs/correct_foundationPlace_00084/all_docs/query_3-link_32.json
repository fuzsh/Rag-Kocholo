This work investigates the link between our moral values and musical choices through lyrics and audio analyses. We align the psychometric scores of 1,480 participants to acoustics and lyrics features obtained from the top 5 songs of their preferred music artists from Facebook Page Likes. We employ a variety of lyric text processing techniques, including lexicon-based approaches and BERT-based embeddings, to identify each song’s narrative, moral valence, attitude, and emotions. In addition, we extract both low- and high-level audio features to comprehend the encoded information in participants’ musical choices and improve the moral inferences. We propose a Machine Learning approach and assess the predictive power of lyrical and acoustic features separately and in a multimodal framework for predicting moral values. Results indicate that lyrics and audio features from the artists people like inform us about their morality. Though the most predictive features vary per moral value, the models that utilised a combination of lyrics and audio characteristics were the most successful in predicting moral values, outperforming the models that only used basic features such as user demographics, the popularity of the artists, and the number of likes per user. Audio features boosted the accuracy in the prediction of empathy and equality compared to textual features, while the opposite happened for hierarchy and tradition, where higher prediction scores were driven by lyrical features. This demonstrates the importance of both lyrics and audio features in capturing moral values. The insights gained from our study have a broad range of potential uses, including customising the music experience to meet individual needs, music rehabilitation, or even effective communication campaign crafting.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nMusic is one of the most fundamental forms of expression. As Victor Hugo once said, “Music expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent”. It is a part of the holistic human experience influencing our emotions [1] and cognitive performance, such as thinking, reasoning, problem-solving, creativity, and mental flexibility [2]. Besides, research has shown that people often select music that aligns with their empathy levels [3] and personality needs [4–7] and enables them to express their values [8, 9]. Such knowledge has proven to be effective for music recommendation systems and their diversity [10].\n\nFor this work, we investigate the less-attended connection between moral values and music preferences. Personality alone may not fully explain our music preferences and listening habits. While personal values are inherent motivational goals, moral values mirror traits, opinions and judgements formed under the influence of society, culture, upbringing and religion, which bring people together in groups. On the other hand, music has been considered a mechanism for fostering social relationships and bonding [11, 12]. Thus people may enjoy specific types of music because they provide stimuli that match their morality-related needs.\n\nOur research aims to investigate to what extent people’s musical choices reflect their moral worldviews. We hypothesise that both audio and lyrics features of the musical pieces people like are important proxies for inferring their moral values. Lyrics are essential in the music listening experience, as they communicate emotions [13] and convey messages related to the main societal issues like love, life, death, and political or religious concepts. Musical audio components, which comprise several abstraction levels from basic perceptual parameters (e.g., melody, tempo) to more complex aggregated features (e.g., timbre, valence), can predict music-evoked emotions [1]; viral songs [14]; and music similarity [15]. Yet audio features of songs are not used as often to predict music preferences. Some studies have used musical audio features to interpret genre-based preference dimensions (e.g., [4]), but direct links to personality traits and values have only recently started to be explored [7, 16].\n\nSimilarly, song lyrics have also received little attention in personality science (e.g., [16, 17]. In our previous work [18], we investigated the link between moral values and music preferences in terms of lyrics. Here we want to see how audio features perform in inferring moral values and whether we can improve our previous findings by combining lyrics and audio. More specifically, the two main questions we pose for this study are: To what extent are moral values reflected in the acoustical and lyrical content of one’s favourite songs? Which music characteristics (lyrics vs audio) are more impactful for moral inferences? Frequently, textual and audio features have been used together for classifying moods [19, 20] and musical genres [21, 22]. However, there is limited knowledge about how the combination of audio and lyrics may influence the association between psychological traits and music choices.\n\nTo address these questions, we used data from the LikeYouth project (https://likeyouth.org, where participants agreed to fill out psychometric surveys and share their Facebook Page Likes. We explored participants’ moral scores and their Likes on music artist Pages and integrated lyrics and audio components from the five most popular songs per artist. We analysed the lyrics’ sentiment, overarching narratives, moral valence and emotional loadings. For audio analysis, we extracted 12 main high-level audio features from Spotify and the auxiliary low-level audio features such as pitch and timbre. We then build regression models for predicting moral values using the extracted features. Results established that people’s musical preferences can, to some extent, predict their moral values, revealing a clear association between the listeners’ preferences for artists whose musical and lyrical content aligns with their moral worldviews.\n\nOur work adds to the growing body of literature on the interplay between music and psychology. Information about a person’s moral worldviews is essential for psychologically aware music recommendation systems, which can contribute to listener wellbeing [23]. On a different note, communication professionals would benefit from understanding the relationship between individuals’ moral beliefs and music choices when selecting music to accompany campaigns for social good while communicating messages through music.\n\nLinks of personality traits and personal values with music preferences\n\nIn music psychology, numerous studies investigated the relationship between music preferences and personality traits [3–5, 24] using Costa and McCrae’s Big5 model [25]. This model is widely accepted and implemented in research, and it depicts five intrinsic traits: Openness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism and Conscientiousness. Scientists in other fields have used this framework for predicting individuals’ work role performance [26], analysing the sense of humour [27] and inferring user movie preferences [28] and choices and behaviours on social media and digital platforms [29–31].\n\nPersonality and music associations were initially analysed via musical stimuli in a lab setting using musical styles (e.g., reflective and complex, upbeat, conventional, energetic [4]) that emerged from genre preferences. Later, researchers took advantage of the fast expansion of internet-based services and used naturally occurring views of musical preferences in online social media [6]. Even more sophisticated models for inferring personality dimensions emerged as a result of behavioural analysis from online music streaming platforms [7] and by implementing finer-grained content-level features including audio [32], and lyrics components [33]. Melchiorre and Schedl [32] explored correlations between listeners’ personality traits and music preferences utilising Spotify audio features (e.g., danceability, loudness, mode, key, valence). They found that individuals with high openness to experience prefer acoustic songs and instrumental music rather than loud and energetic music. While extroverts prefer music with high danceability and positive valence, which is in line with the stereotypical depiction of outgoing individuals. Regarding lyrics, some studies pointed at affinities between songwriters’ personality, mental health and their lyrical content [17, 34]. From the listeners’ point of view, studies showed that neurotic individuals prefer listening to musical pieces with more complex and less repetitive lyrics that express negative emotions [33, 35]. Whereas more conscientious individuals prefer songs with lyrics talking about achievements [33], but also about love [16].\n\nIn addition to personality, few music studies have considered the exploration of personal values (Schwartz Theory [36]), which represent broader goals that motivate and/or inhibit prosocial actions and behaviours [37]. These values define four universal dimensions, namely Openness to change (stimulation and self-direction), Conservation (conformity, tradition and security), Self-transcendence (benevolence and universalism) and Self-enhancement (achievement and power). In their study about music preference, values similarity and social attractions, Boer et al. [38] argued that social bonding through music is likely to occur via value similarity but not via similarity in personality traits. Gardikiotis and Baltzis [8] used personal values as proxies to predict people’s musical tastes. They showed that openness to change was highly associated with non-mainstream music, while self-transcendence was associated with sophisticated and complex music. Yet another study showed that individuals with self-enhancement values prefer contemporary music styles, and individuals with self-transcendence values prefer sophisticated music styles [39]. Furthermore, the authors pointed to a link between openness-to-change values and preference for music serving various personal and societal functions, while conservation values are negatively associated with these functions.\n\nEven though studies have yielded positive results concerning music, personality affiliations and personal values, moral worldviews are an essential factor that deserves additional attention from the research body. Not only do moral foundations partially reflect more dispositional personality traits [40, 41], but they also have the potential to give profound insight into why people have the musical tastes they do and how these choices align with their ethical reasoning.\n\nMoral values: From social/political perspectives to music lenses\n\nFor this work, we operationalise moral values via the Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) [42], which describes the psychological ground of morality in terms of five innate foundations, formed by a two-faced scope between so-called virtues and vices. These foundations are Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, and Purity/Degradation. These can further collapse into two superior foundations: Individualising (Care and Fairness), indicative of a more liberal perspective, and Binding (Purity, Authority and Loyalty), indicative of a more conservative outlook. As Hoover and colleagues [43] explained, the MFT framework offers the most diverse and well-rooted pluralistic model of moral values. Also, it is the only taxonomy of morality with developed term dictionaries. Several dictionary-based techniques were proposed to infer moral values within the text of tweets and social media posts, such as the Moral Foundations Dictionary [44, 45] and the MoralStrength lexicon [46].\n\nResearchers have associated morality with judgements, opinions and attitudes towards complex situations such as charitable donations [43], climate change [47], vaccination [48, 49], interpersonal exposure [50], and politics [40, 41, 51, 52]. While more recent works in computational social science have demonstrated the inference of moral values with various human behavioural digital data, including gameplay [53, 54], smartphone usage and web browsing [55]. Some researchers have investigated the potential role of morality subcultures in mediating the connection between one’s nationality and preferences for movie and TV genres [56]. While others have explored moral foundations for classifying public policies [57].\n\nGenerally, moral foundations are considered a higher psychological construct than the more typically investigated personality traits [58]. Some studies have pointed to a connection between moral values and personality attributes. In a study about the association of personality with political ideologies and moral values, Lewis and colleagues [40] found that Individualising foundations were correlated with Agreeableness and Openness. Whereas, Binding foundations were associated with Low-Openness, Extroversion and Conscientiousness. Furthermore, the authors noticed that higher levels of Neuroticism predicted higher levels of both Binding and Individualising, while these two super-foundations influence political orientation in the opposite direction [40]. Similar findings were demonstrated by Hirsh and colleagues [41].\n\n“Morality binds and blinds” writes Haidt [59]; it has a huge impact on the way a person makes decisions and evaluates circumstances. As stated in previous studies, moral rhetoric can unite, persuade and motivate people with similar values or beliefs. However, it is unlikely to be efficient if the same rhetoric is used on both sides (e.g. conservatives vs liberals) [60, 61]. Hence, researchers debated Moral reframing as a technique for framing different situations in a way that is consistent with one’s moral values. For instance, Feinberg and Willer [60] stated that same-sex marriage is likely to get more support from conservatives if framed in terms of patriotism rather than equality.\n\nSimilar rhetoric was also communicated via musical sounds and lyrics in social and political drives. Commonly, the songs used in successful campaigns contain uplifting sounds and lyrics that resonate with nations’ ideals, such as values of optimism and progress for a better future [62]. Music rhetoric has been used to advocate for what is perceived to be a necessary societal change [63], promote peace and unity [64], and raise awareness for marginalised groups [65]. These narratives are closely related to moral judgements and beliefs. Despite that, moral values have yet to be elaborated more by music scientists. There is limited research on how musical choices or specific songs may elicit strong emotional responses in individuals who prioritise, for instance, Care and Fairness compared to those who prioritise Authority, Purity, and Loyalty.\n\nLinks between moral values and musical tastes\n\nIn terms of morality and music studies, an association between moral values, demographics, and musical genres was explored by Preniqi et al. [66] using ad-hoc survey data. This study found that people with higher levels of Binding foundations tend to like country and Christian music. Those with lower levels of Binding traits tend to favour music genres such as punk and hip-hop, where lyrics are known to challenge traditional values and the status quo [8]. Individualising foundations were more difficult to predict (cf. [55]). Furthermore, the authors explained that adding demographic information (e.g., age, gender, political views, education) improved MFT predictions only to a limited degree, showing the ability of music preferences alone to describe one’s moral values [66].\n\nAnsani and colleagues [67] investigated whether listening to a musical piece can affect the harshness of moral judgement. The results of this study suggested that negative emotions enforced by certain types of music can worsen moral judgement. Although, that study did not rely on a psychometrically validated tool like the MFT [67].\n\nThe link between the lyrics component and listeners’ moral values has been explored only recently. For instance, Messick and Aranda [68] analysed the link between lyrical preferences, moral reasoning domains and personality traits. The authors found that moral values define a unique and significant part of the variance in the lyrics preferences of different metal music sub-genre that was not explained by personality traits alone. For instance, liking lyrics about celebrating metal culture and unity relates to higher levels of Loyalty foundation and Extroversion. Whereas favouring song lyrics linked to hardships, love, and emotional turmoil is related to care/harm and fairness, showing that those individuals might use these lyrics as coping mechanisms or be more empathetic to those who struggle.\n\nIn recent work, Preniqi et al. [18] investigated moral values inferences based on a set of textual features related to lyrics’ overarching narrative, moral valence, sentiment and songs’ word emotion associations. The study demonstrated that lyrics components extracted from the naturally emerging music preferences in social media, to some degree, allow for constructing reliable premises of moral values. People who value more Individualising values preferred artists whose songs’ lyrics talk about joy, anticipation and trust. Those concerned more about ingroup and Binding values liked artists whose songs contained more romantic topics and disliked lyrics that implied negative emotions such as sadness, fear, or disgust [18]. However, as in the previous studies [55, 66], the Individualising foundations remained challenging to predict. Here, we extend this work by adding a range of low- and high-level audio features separately and in a multimodal framework, together with the lyrics, to improve the present results further, building on Tagg’s socio-semantic view of musical meaning [69] and motivated by recent findings linking individual audio features of preferred music to personality traits and values [4, 7, 16].\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study explored the relationship between a person’s morals and the type of music they prefer, considering both the songs’ lyrics and acoustic features. In addition, we investigated the influence of demographics and shallow digital traces, such as artist page likes per user and artist popularity, in inferring an individual’s moral foundations. From the results of MFT questionnaires, we saw that women scored higher than men in Care, Fairness and Purity foundations. We also found that individuals with more central Binding and Ingroup values preferred more popular and mainstream artists suggesting that these individuals are more likely to be influenced by social norms and group opinions. This is consistent with the idea that music preferences play a role in social bonding, as shared musical tastes can indicate similar values and dispositions [95].\n\nWe examined various methods for analysing the lyrics of songs, including more traditional techniques such as lexicons and more complex natural language processing methods like the BERT model. We complemented the moral and lyrics analysis presented previously [18] by analysing high-level and low-level acoustic characteristics. Previously, we found that by analysing the lyrics of one’s preferred artists, reliable inferences about that individual’s moral values can be made [18]. Values associated with ethics of tradition and hierarchy were more accurately predicted by lyrics features than values related to virtues of equality and compassion.\n\nBuilding on Tagg’s socio-semantic view of musical meaning [69], we hypothesised that audio features play an important role in comprehending how people align their music preferences with moral worldviews. Despite difficulties in predicting Care and Fairness foundations reported previously [18, 66], we improved the predicting results for these foundations mainly when adding acoustic features. This was in line with correlation results which suggested that individuals with higher scores for Care and Fairness preferred artists whose songs are more acoustic and include fewer speech elements. While for Authority, Purity, and Loyalty, the prediction results with audio features improved only marginally. They did not outperform lyrics predictors, implying that individuals who value these foundations more may prioritise lyrics that align with their beliefs over the song’s musicality when selecting music to listen to.\n\nFurther, we found that models built with either timbre or pitch features had good accuracy for predicting each moral foundation. One aspect that could have led to the high accuracy of these models is the inclusion of a large number of attributes through statistical moments (mean, standard deviation, mean of first-order difference, and standard deviation of first-order difference) calculated for every dimension of pitch and timbre. This allowed us to gain a more in-depth comprehension of the information encoded in the musical compositions. Even though models built with lyrics features expressing emotions, morals, and sentiments employed significantly fewer attributes, they too demonstrated a decent accuracy in predicting overall moral proportion.\n\nOur experimentation showed that both the lyrics and audio features of songs play significant roles in describing individuals’ musical preferences. Moreover, the most accurate predictions of moral values were obtained when considering both lyrics and audio elements within a multimodal framework. From a general interpretation, our findings indicated that participants with higher Individualising scores tended to prefer music with smooth, low-arousal melodies and lyrics that express themes of trust, anticipation, and care. On the other hand, those with higher Binding scores tended to prefer more upbeat, rhythmic songs with lyrics that focus on themes of love, purity, and victory. Given the correlation between moral values and political leanings [40], these broad implications might have some similarities with Rentfrow and Gosling’s [4] results, which suggested that more liberal individuals preferred reflective and complex music (e.g. jazz, blues, and classical), while more traditional and conservative individuals preferred more traditional and upbeat music (e.g. pop and religious music).\n\nEven though we showed improvements in predicting Individualising foundations (.10 ≤ r ≤ .18) by 7% compared to the previous study [18], models predicting Binding values were more successful (.21 ≤ r ≤ .33), suggesting that binders more instinctively express their moral values through their musical choices. The results are encouraging but still fall short of reaching the desired level. The nature of the moral values being analysed is highly complex, and such attributes are often conveyed through subtle means daily and occasionally in a more intense way under certain circumstances [55].\n\nTherefore, plenty of research literature uses personality traits as a more trivial proxy for analysing the implications of musical tastes. For instance, also using music-related Facebook likes, Nave et al. [6] obtained Pearson correlations in the range of .16–.30 on their regression models for the prediction of Big-Five traits. Anderson et al. [7] achieved Big-Five inferences in the range of .26–.37 by using a more complex framework using musical moods, genres and other derived metrics derived from music listening behaviours on the Spotify platform. Our results are comparable to these studies, corroborating our motivation that moral reasoning styles are also vital in understanding musical preferences [68]. Our findings help to further increase awareness about how our music listening habits may reveal information about our values and worldviews.\n\nProspective studies should further examine the relationship between moral worldviews and music, particularly in cross-cultural contexts, as these psychological factors are crucial in the decision-making process in various societal issues process [55, 96]. In his book The Righteous Mind [59], Jonathan Haidt explained that Republicans have a better understanding of moral psychology and how it is used in political campaigns, as evidenced by their ability to use moral rhetoric in slogans and songs effectively by triggering the full range of intuitions described by the five MFT traits. Like Democrats, they can talk about innocent people and fairness, but they put more emphasis on resonating with the virtues of loyalty, authority and purity; in contrast, Democrats only focus on the ethics of empathy and equality. Caiani and Padoan [97] provide a similar account of the multiple mechanisms linking the production of pop music (as a form of popular culture) to the rise and reproduction of populism Music chosen for social and political campaigns may therefore be attuned based on the targeted audience. Our findings can serve as a guide for future research in understanding how music can be used to stimulate and influence people in social and political contexts.\n\nAnother interesting aspect would be analysing moral values as a proxy, beyond demographics, to enhance the music listening experience and improve recommendations further. Traditionally, music recommendation systems mainly relied on statistical models, learning from historical user preference data. More sophisticated recommendation algorithms measured consumption diversity, and the interplay between users’ short-term and long-term engagement with a particular streaming platform [98]. Nonetheless, music streaming services have yet to consider the psychological and emotional state of the listener. Therefore, we believe that the insights gained from our work can be incorporated into music recommendation systems that are attuned to human psychological aspects. The application of these insights can be extended beyond music to other forms of media.\n\nA critical aspect of this discussion is the ethical considerations when AI/ML systems are involved in predicting individuals’ demographics, psychological traits, music-listening habits, and preferences. Although this can be beneficial for campaigning in social and political contexts and enhancing recommendation systems, it can also be dangerous as it could be exploited for harmful purposes such as manipulation and control. To mitigate these issues, researchers and AI engineers need to share ethical usage guidelines for the deployed systems/platforms that can help users understand how their data will be used and the beneficial purposes of the data utilisation in these platforms. This way, users will have the opportunity to know how these systems work and decide whether they want to use them. Studies like ours can be used to raise awareness and increase public education about the potential AI/ML models to determine users’ preferences and psychological aspects based on their behavioural patterns.\n\nFurthermore, the algorithms used to analyse the data from digital music streaming platforms may be biased against certain groups of people who have informed their demographics or particular worldviews, which could lead to unfairness and discrimination [99, 100]. While user feedback can sometimes homogenise recommendations over time [101]. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that any analysis related to personal characteristics on digital streaming platforms is conducted transparently, with proper mechanisms in place that mitigate any potential biases related to user interaction, social attitudes, behavioural patterns, sampling, population and data representation [99].\n\nOur work has a few limitations. We crafted musical preference profiles from Facebook Page Likes which represent static data and may only reflect a snapshot of users’ music interests at a particular point in time. Digital streaming platforms could provide more detailed information about users’ music listening habits and patterns [7, 16, 102]. Furthermore, the LikeYouth project data include primarily Facebook users from Italy, so our conclusions may only partially apply to other cultures across the world. A related issue concerns the analysis of English-lyrics songs only. More specifically, because the LikeYouth app was launched primarily through the Italian language version of Facebook, the majority of the users who responded are expected to be geolocated in Italy, but this may not necessarily reflect culturally Italian users. Conversely, it is plausible that a user of Italian nationality geolocated (at the time of data collection) outside Italy may still use the Italian version of Facebook. The fact that our initial dataset of 47,580 songs comprised about 78% English lyrics indicates that our sample nonetheless had a very strong preference for English-speaking songs overall. This preference implies that English music holds a meaningful place in their regular listening habits, rather than being a random or occasional choice.\n\nIt should also be noted that the audio features available from the Spotify API are based on non-public algorithms. As such, it is not possible to quantify exactly which acoustical and musical parameters contribute to a particular audio feature. Future work will focus on custom feature extraction techniques based on existing open-source toolboxes for music content description [103]. Deep learning approaches for representing lyrical and audio content might also be of interest, for example, using state-of-the-art pre-trained audio embeddings for timbre [104] and BERT embeddings for topic modelling and moral valence [86] On a final note, although our results indicated that music preferences carry information about individuals’ moral worldviews that goes beyond basic demographics, there may be other factors not included in our study, such as socio-economic status, religion, culture, and hobbies, that could further support our findings."
