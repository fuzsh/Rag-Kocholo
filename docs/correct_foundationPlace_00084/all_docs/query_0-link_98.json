        "text": "“Poetry is a political act because it involves telling the truth.” – June Jordan\n\nJune Jordan (1936-2002) was a poet, activist, journalist, essayist, and educator. She was widely considered one of the most published and highly acclaimed Jamaican-American writers of her generation. Masterful across genres, her work was both autobiographical and that which bore witness to the human condition. A global citizen with a deep commitment to civil rights, women’s rights, LGTBQ rights and anti-war movements, she used her work to share powerful visions for the liberation and solidarity of marginalized and oppressed people.\n\nCelebrated by Toni Morrison as a writer who “has comforted, explained, described, wrestled with, taught and made us laugh out loud before we wept,” Jordan’s expansive career produced more than twenty five major works of poetry, fiction and essays in addition to numerous children’s books. Jordan also wrote the librettos for two operas and frequently collaborated with and wrote lyrics for musicians, plays and musicals. She was a regular columnist for The Progressive and was widely published in magazines and newspapers around the world.\n\nAs an educator, Jordan taught at City College of New York, Yale University and Sarah Lawrence College. She later became a professor of English at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, where she directed The Poetry Center and in 1988 was appointed professor of African-American Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, where she founded the influential poetry program Poetry for the People.\n\nShe also earned countless awards and honors, including a 1969-1970 Rockefeller grant for creative writing, a Yaddo residency (1979), a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship (1982) and the Achievement Award for International Reporting from the National Association of Black Journalists (1984). Jordan also won the Lila Wallace Reader's Digest Writers Award (1995-1998), the Ground Breakers-Dream Makers Award from The Woman's Foundation (1994), the Chancellor's Distinguished Lectureship from the University of California at Berkeley, the PEN Center USA West Freedom to Write Award (1991), a congressional citation for her outstanding contributions to literature, the progressive movement and the civil rights movement and an induction to the Stone Wall Inn’s National LGBTQ Wall of Honor.\n\nBeyond her own accolades, she valiantly fought for the recognition of others including that of writing peers James Baldwin and Toni Morrison in “Black Writers in Praise of Toni Morrison.”\n\nAs stated by Jordan, “as a Black woman, I have always had to invent the power my freedom required.” We are grateful for her genius and the many ways that she has created space for us to follow in her footsteps and invent the power that our freedom requires.\n\nTo learn more about June Jordan, please visit:\n\nJune Jordan website: http://www.junejordan.net\n\nThe Poetry Foundation: https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/june-jordan\n\nPoetry for the People: https://africam.berkeley.edu/poetry-for-the-people/\n\nTo experience some of June Jordan’s musical collaborations, please check out the following projects:\n\nMeshell Ndegeocello’s Cookie: The Anthropological Mixtape - “Interlude: 6 Legged Griot Trio (Weariness)” featuring June Jordan, Claude McKay and Etheridge Knight\n\nSweet Honey in the Rock’s …twenty-five… and Breaths - “We Are the Ones,” “Oughta Be A Woman” and “Alla That’s All Right, But”"
