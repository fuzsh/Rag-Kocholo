        "text": "By Josh Allen & Heikki 'Mike' Koskinen's Northern Winds, a benefit concert for the Berkeley Finnish Hall ADA Access project.\n\nProgram:\n\nSan Francisco-based composer-bandleader Joshua Allen and his high-energy innovative 25-piece Deconstruction Orchestra will perform Constructions #31, 32, and 33, original deconstructivist-inspired music of cell structure game compositions. Melding together post-modern, free jazz, non-idiomatic improvisation, and San Francisco’s vast highly diverse contemporary music scenes, the Deconstruction Orchestra is inspired by the large ensemble works of late 20th century composer/directors such as Marco Enedi, Cecil Taylor, and the works of Butch Morris, and Kim Richmond. Under the direction Joshua Allen, the orchestra creates a powerfully cathartic architecture of sound creating a sonic space around the listener and redefining the purpose of the large ensemble.\n\nOpening will be composer Heikki 'Mike' Koskinen's Northern Winds. A project featuring new and old Finnish music arranged in innovative new ways, exploring the universal connections between immigrants and their motherlands. They bring together musicians from many past projects and performances utilizing each musician’s unique sound in creating new sonic textures and ways to interpret these songs that are well known to the Finnish community yet arranged in non-traditional ways. Northern Winds takes the listener on a musical ride through a wide variety of styles and approaches, from written arrangements to free flowing extemporaneous group improvisations. Heikki received Finnish Music Archives’ lifetime award as “Finnish Jazz Legend #34” in September 2019.\n\nhttps://edgetonerecords.bandcamp.com/.../sis-ll-ulkona...\n\nPerforming Artists:\n\nDeconstruction Orchestra\n\nDirector Joshua Allen - Composer, tenor saxophone\n\nConstructions #31, 32, and 33\n\nJanel Wagner--electric guitar, Carla Kaufman-double bass, Dave Casini-drums\n\nNathan Corder-electric guitar, Tim Duff-double bass, Kevin Corcoran-drums\n\nSteve Adams-alto saxophone, Rent Romus-alto saxophone, Sam Flores-tenor saxophone, JAROBA-baritone saxophone\n\nAaron Bennett-soprano saxophone, Jeff Hobbs-alto saxophone, Kevin Robinson-tenor saxophone, Dan Plonsey-baritone\n\nSheldon Brown-soprano saxophone, John Ingle-alto saxophone, Joshua Marshall-tenor saxophone, John Vaughn-baritone saxophone\n\nMitch Craig-Eb horn, Matt Gaspari-flugelhorn, Matt Striech-trombone, Ron Heglin-tuba\n\nNorthern Winds\n\nHeikki 'Mike' Koskinen - Composer, e-trumpet, tenor recorder, piano, voice, midi\n\nRent Romus - alto saxophone, flutes, percussion, voice\n\nTim Duff - double bass, Elihu Knowles - drums, piano\n\nThe event is suitable for all ages.\n\nTickets: $20 -$50 General $15 Student/Senior\n\nALL PROCEEDS HELP THE HALL ADA PROJECT!!!\n\nMake a donation today!\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/berkeley-finn-hall-accessibility\n\nThe Finnish Heritage Society presents A side-by-side pairing of the stunning solo cello works of the late Grammy-wnning Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho (1952-2023) alongside other works performed by cellist Eric Moore.\n\nProgram Details\n\nThe program begins with the first piece ever written for cello with a musical fresco by Saariaho based on it. The next work is an early work by her mentor, Klaus Huber, along with a piece by Saariaho that draws heavily on what she learned working with him.\n\nSaariaho’s final work for cello, written in memoriam of the composer Oliver Knussen, is paired with Colombian cellist-composer Andrea Casarrubios’ haunting pandemic-era work Seven. Finally, Saariaho’s stunning Seven Butterflies - perhaps this century’s great masterpiece for cello - is followed by a work composed as an homage to Saariaho by the cellist himself.\n\nDuring the performance, the performer will draw parallels between each side-by-side pairing to enhance the listening experience between the works and introduce Saariaho’s unique, ethereal, and beautiful writing for cello.\n\nThis is pre-concert leading up to the August 16th-18th festival, sponsored by Napa Valley College. It is a retrospective of the late Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho (1952-2023). Her complete chamber music - 46 works - will be performed across 6 concerts.\n\nPerforming Artists:\n\nEric Moore started cello at age 10, won his first orchestral audition at 15, and at 23 had been principal cellist of four orchestras. His frequent collaborations with leading composers have lead to Album of the Year accolades.\n\nHe composed the filmscore for a Documentary of the Year nominee in addition to a cello concerto, cello duets, hundreds of pedagogical works and arrangements, and a 38-minute cello quintet.\n\nHis technique book has been required at Juilliard since 2013; professionals from three continents are currently enrolled in his year-long course about it. Teachers across the country use his 14-volume method, Cellosophy, and he teaches students in six states and Japan.\n\nEric graduated summa cum laude from the University of Michigan as a triple major: BM Cello Performance (with Richard Aaron), BM Music Theory, BM Music History. He is the Executive Director of New Music Decanted.\n\nPlease visit www.CelloLoft.com\n\nProgram:\n\nSide-by-Side Tasting: The Cello Music of Kaija Saariaho\n\nGiuseppe Colombi | Chiacona (1670)\n\nKaija Saariaho | Dreaming Chaccone after Colombi (2010)\n\n--\n\nKlaus Huber | Transpositio Ad Infinitum (1976)\n\nKaija Saariaho | Spins and Spells (1996)\n\n~ Intermission ~\n\nKaija Saariaho | Lullaby (2020)\n\nAndrea Casarrubios | Seven (2020)\n\n--\n\nKaija Saariaho | Seven Butterflies (2000)\n\nEric Moore | Postlude - Homage to K.

Many came in the great migration of the 1890s to the 1910s. The families wanted a space of their own, where they could speak Finnish, eat food from the Old Country, and celebrate important holidays such as Vappu and Finnish Independence Day. Members of that group built the Finnish Hall on Berkeley’s Chestnut Street, a beautiful and historic building that has been cared for by descendents of these Finnish settlers since its completion in 1932. Now the Hall needs all of us.\n\nPeople may ask why this is important now, in 2024. Although the Hall functions as a center for Finnish culture only a few times a year, its auditorium, stage, and meeting rooms are active every single day. While people may no longer identify or feel kinship with an ethnic group, people need community, and they find it within religious, dance, arts, and other alliances. The Hall serves LIST AT LEAST SIX DIVERSE GROUPS THAT RENT THE HALL, among many others. These groups are as important to contemporary East Bay residents as the Hall was to Finnish immigrants in decades past.\n\nFor years the Board of Trustees wanted to improve access to the Hall. Now we are embarking on a major construction project to add ADA bathrooms and access to both the auditorium and kitchen levels. We need your help.\n\nA fundraising target of $250,000 has been set, and construction will begin this June. Please become a part of this venture that will serve generations to come. The East Bay needs quality spaces where people can find themselves as well as each other, where arts and dance thrive, where community grows through talk and advocacy. Please support what our founders dreamed of: a place they can call home. Once we finish the accessibility project, that home will truly be for everyone.\n\nWe are including two attachments: one gives more details about the accessibility project and the other provides more of the Hall’s history.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Finnish Heritage Society\n\nThe Finnish Heritage Society Presents\n\nRent Romus & Heikki Koskinen’s Itkuja Suite, Invocations on lament & The Aaron Space Cosmic Orchestra\n\nFriday February 9th at 8pm\n\nThe Finnish Heritage Society presents an encore of Grammy Considered Itkuja Suite, invocations on lament a deep and rich exploration of the healing music of Finnish Nordic lament and life affirming elements of jazz. Crafted by Emmy award winning Finnish-American saxophonist Rent Romus and Finnish Jazz Legend and composer Heikki Koskinen, Itkuja will be performed by Romus’ Life’s Blood Ensemble. Also performing will be Elihu Knowles’ Aaron Space Cosmic Orchestra, a multilayered large ensemble project exploring the syntheses of acoustic and electronic as part of the FHS monthly Cultural Performance series at the Berkeley Finnish Hall\n\nPerforming Artists:\n\nLIFE’S BLOOD ENSEMBLE: Rent Romus - composition, alto & soprano saxophones, flutes, kantele, bells; Heikki \"Mike\" Koskinen - composition, tenor recorder, E-trumpet, flutes, kantele; Joshua Marshall - tenor saxophone tenor & soprano saxophones, flute; Erika Oba - flute, piccolo Ann McChesney-Young – accordion; Safa Shokrai - double bass; Eli Knowles - drums, percussion\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/rent-romus/excerpts-from-itkuja\n\nTHE AARON SPACE COSMIC ORCHESTRA: Eli Knowles – composition, piano; Hayden Dekker – alto saxophone; Rent Romus – c-melody saxophone; Ari Brown – trumpet; Dylan Ransley – guitar; Ryan Higley – drum set; Quinn Girard – bass\n\nhttps://pjce.bandcamp.com/album/night-0n-earth\n\nThe tradition of song through lament has served as a form of community expression spanning millennia, invoking processes of healing in profound ways. The Finnish word itkuja (eet-koo-yaw) literally means crying, but hidden within this translation embodies deeper undercurrents of meaning. Itkuja surpasses the biopic Western acceptance of polar opposites drawing a more all-encompassing world view of the definition of existence, loss, and change.\n\nStorytelling has a profound effect on Romus’ musical endeavors. The first of many experimental musical theatrical presentations began in the late 1990s, creating a series of works inspired by Edgar Allen Poe, Philip K Dick, and Frank Herbert. After reading multiple versions of the Finnish National Epic, the Kalevala, he discovered that music based on interpretations of his cultural heritage could serve as a path towards a deeper understanding.\n\nThe Aaron Space Cosmic Orchestra is a large jazz ensemble led by Berkeley, California-based producer/composer/multi-instrumentalist Eli Knowles. Born in Brooklyn, NY but primarily raised in Berkeley, California, Knowles is also the bandleader and lead vocalist for one of the most creative and energetic bands on the Bay Area scene, Aaron Space & His Terrestrial Underlings. The Aaron Space Cosmic Orchestra was created in Portland during his time at Reed College and became during this time an outlet for Knowles' more explicitly jazz-oriented ideas. They will perform music from his debut release “Night 0n Earth as well as new originals.\n\nProfits from this concert will benefit the Berkeley Finnish Hall 2024 ADA Project.\n\nhttp://www.finnishhall.org/access\n\nTickets: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fhs-presents-romuskoskinens-itkuja-suite-aaron-space-cosmic-orchestra-tickets-803494572897?fbclid=IwAR2Y-yyNO2JBcmUT17vIXkNN8McKuJZsTSyajPHhfFEuEvmN3EJKa6Rp4fo\n\nThe Finnish Heritage Society presents an afternoon of Finnish family music with performed by Selma Seppänen and Miska Kajanus as part of the monthly Cultural Performance Series at the Berkeley Finnish Hall.\n\nProgram:\n\nIn the first part of the show, they'll entertain the kids with some catchy Finnish children's music.

While on tour with fellow composer.musician Heikki Kosinen in 2019, he visited the Cultural Center in Joensuu Finland to see the lament exhibit. This experience sparked discussions and further research blossoming new musical ideas based on this oral-tradition.\n\nThis project completes the Otherworld Trilogy which includes the 2015 release of the Otheworld Cycle and the 2020 release of Manala on Edgetone Records.\n\nSaturday Show: Doors at 7:30 pm Performance at 8:00 pm\n\nTickets at the door and in advance at Eventbrite:\n\n$20 General, $15 Student/Senior (use FHS10 for a 10% discount)\n\nSunday Show: Doors at 3:30 pm Performance at 4:00 pm\n\nTickets at the door and in advance at Eventbrite:\n\n$20 General, $15 Student/Senior (use FHS10 for a 10% discount)\n\nSUNDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 2022 AT 4 PM\n\nKalevala & Kabbalah\n\n(Music inspired by culture, ritual, and celebration)\n\nFinnish Heritage Society presents music inspired by jazz, improvisation, Finnish and Jewish cultural expressions as part of the monthly Cultural Performance series at the Berkeley Finnish Hall, 1970 Chestnut St (University Ave).\n\nDoors at 3:30 pm Matinee at 4:00 pm\n\n4:00 pm Jordan Glenn, percussion, David Israel Katz - voice\n\nDavid Israel Katz is the founder of the foreignfire a performance ensemble that creates aesthetically powerful events in the overlapping area of performance art and Jewish ritual.\n\nJordan Glenn is a drummer, percussionist, improviser, composer, conductor, and bandleader.

The Hall is in a beautiful shape already, but now we are pushing very hard to be able to make the Hall ADA compliant.\n\nFor this year’s silent auction we have already been donated several beautiful Finnish items by Mary Ellen MacMuldren from Riku Ploe-Kaijala’s estate. Carolyn Hunt has also given us many delightful things from Wes Ludeman’s collection.\n\nIn case YOU, who are reading this, have some item or items which you would not mind donating to the Berkeley Finnish Hall, and make the highest bidder very happy and appreciative, please contact me, Kirsti Bellows. The items do not have to be Finnish, but they should be in good condition. We do not have space for used clothing or shoes. My email address is kirstikb@yahoo.com, phone 510.527.6160.\n\nAbout Vappu:\n\nVappu is celebrated traditionally on 1 May and marks the end of winter. It is also celebrated as International Labor Day in most places in the world and is one of the biggest festivals of the year in Finland alongside Midsummer's Day and Christmas. Vappu was created in the nineteenth century when engineering students would celebrate and party at midnight on 30 April, while sporting their traditional white caps. This custom has now become widespread across Finland, leading to partying in towns and cities.\n\nSunday December 2nd, 2018 2 - 4PM\n\nFree Event Admission\n\n$25 Afternoon Buffet\n\nLive Music/Guest Speakers/No Host Bar\n\nFeatured Speakers:\n\nAnja Miller: Perspectives on the future of our Finnish-American Community\n\nMichel Wendell: Honorary Consul of Finland\n\nWelcome Greeting by Fred Mork\n\nMusic featuring works by Toivo Kuula, Fredrik Pacius, & Jean Sibelius:\n\nHeikki Koskinen (e-tpt, piano)\n\nKati Pienimäki Schenker (vocal, percussion)\n\nRent Romus (alto, sopr sax, flute)\n\nKat Elliot (alto, tenor sax)\n\nJari Suomalainen (violin)\n\nPROGRAM\n\n1:30 pm Kids crafts table\n\n2:00 pm RECEPTION / PROCESSION / ANTHEMS / LIVE MUSIC\n\n2:20 pm Guest Speakers\n\n3:00 pm CATERED BUFFET\n\nMENU\n\n- Salmon sandwich: open faced sandwich on multigrain rye bread, with smoked salmon, sliced cucumber, arugula, cream cheese or herbed butter, and red onion.\n\n- Vegetarian sandwich: roasted beet and yam , herbed goat cheese, cucumber, arugula on focaccia\n\n- Ham sandwich: hickory smoked ham, cheddar cheese, lettuce, picked red onions, mustard, herbed mayonnaise\n\n- Kesäkakku & pulla\n\nCoffee, Tea, soft drinks, beer & wine\n\nManala\n\nA musical adventure inspired by the mythic prose of cultural liberation and identity found in the ancient runes of Kaleva mythology\n\nSaturday and Sunday May 25-26, 2019\n\nat the Berkeley Finnish Hall\n\nThe Finnish Heritage Society presents the East Bay debut of Rent Romus and Heikki Koskinen’s “Manala” (netherworld), a representation of cultural rediscovery through the lens of music weaving the elements of jazz, traditional folk, and free improvisation inspired by the mythic prose of cultural liberation and identity found in the Finnish and Finno-Ugric folklore and shamanic traditions.

It is a place opposite of the land of the living, a destination for the soul after this life, a place of reflection that contains answers to mysteries of the universe for the Noaidde or Noita (shaman) in Fino-Ugric cultures. It can be very dangerous for a living person to journey there, and only the most experienced shaman may successfully emerge from its dark waters richer in knowledge and song for the experience.\n\nPerforming Artists of Life’s Blood Ensemble:\n\nMark Clifford - vibraphone\n\nGabby Fluke-Mogul - violin\n\nMax Judelson - double bass\n\nHeikki \"Mike\" Kosikinen - e-trumpet, tenor recorder, kantele\n\nCheryl E.
