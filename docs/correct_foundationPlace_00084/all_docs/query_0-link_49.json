        "text": "April is a time for poetry to shine across the country as National Poetry Month, the largest literary celebration in the world, unfolds. Befitting a world-class university, UC has a long poetic tradition, but you might be surprised by exactly how deep it goes.\n\nIn fact, UC Berkeley offered the nation’s very first university-level creative writing course, according to Robert Hass, professor emeritus of English at UC Berkeley and former poet laureate of the United States.\n\n“The course was taught in 1918 by Witter Bynner,” Hass explains, “a friend of Wallace Stevens.” Bynner went on to produce one of the first English translations of Chinese literature with fellow UC Berkeley professor Jiang Kanghu, “Jade Mountain” — a book that, 100 years on, has never gone out of print.\n\nUC Berkeley was also home to early figures in the feminist poetic tradition. Josephine Miles, the first woman tenured in the English department at Cal in 1947, taught among her many students Barbara Guest, who became a storied figure in one of poetry’s major 20th century movements, the New York School (despite her having attended UC Berkeley and UCLA — talk about poetic license!).\n\nIn the decades since, UC has produced enough poets to fill multiple anthologies — including Ishmael Reed, Thom Gunn and Adrienne Rich — to name a few. But perhaps most excitingly, poetry thrives across the university today.\n\nAt UC Berkeley this year, student Carli Torres organized the first Undergraduate Poetry Festival with fellow classmates; speakers included a range of prize-winning poets, among them Shelley Wong, alum and UCSF staffer, whose first book “As She Appears” won the 2023 Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Poetry. Coming together to celebrate poetry animated them all.\n\n“You’re taken legitimately as a poet, as soon as you walk into class, by these incredible poets and teachers,” Torres said. “It makes it so easy to grow.” Inspired by a workshop taught by English professor Cathy Park Hong, Torres and a few other classmates founded the Creative Writers Association on campus for undergrads and jumped into organizing their own festival. For Wong, once an undergrad in the very same lecture halls, it was a thrill to be back as a featured poet.\n\n“It’s a dream realized to read my debut book in the Maude Fife room, 22 years after graduation, where I’ve seen so many notable poets read,” Wong said. “I’m especially honored to be part of their first undergrad poetry festival and their history of poet alumni including Mai Der Vang, Joseph Rios, Thea Matthews, and Javier Zamora. I loved interacting with the undergraduates and wish I could go back to school, as we are truly living in a time of queer writer of color abundance and community.”\n\nWhile it may not be possible to go back in time just yet, it is always possible to enjoy the work of poets springing from the page, any time of year. Check out a few of our selections of UC poets from across the system below. And if you’re still not sure if poetry is for you, give Robert Hass a chance to explain why poetry has captivated us for centuries, in this short talk for the UC Berkeley Greater Good Center.\n\nA by no means comprehensive selection for your reading lists (please feel free to write in with your favorites!):\n\nUC Berkeley\n\nRobert Hass — professor emeritus of English at UC Berkeley, Hass is a former poet laureate of the United States (1995-1997), a National Book Award winner (2007) and Pulitzer Prize winner (2008).
