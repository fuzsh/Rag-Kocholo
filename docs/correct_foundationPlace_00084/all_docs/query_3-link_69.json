        "text": "Australia’s newest and most innovative theatre.\n\nThe Sydney Lyric opened in 1997 and has a history of welcoming legendary international performers and productions. Acquired by Foundation Theatres in 2011, it has now become a staple of the NSW musical theatre scene, hosting World Premieres, including Strictly Ballroom the Musical and Dream Lover, Australian Premieres including Legally Blonde the Musical, Beautiful: The Carole King Musical and Matilda the Musical, and successful runs of smash hit musicals such as Annie, Grease, War Horse, The Book of Mormon and Saturday Night Fever.\n\nThe Sydney Lyric is one of Australia’s newest and most innovative theatres. Having recently undergone an $25 million renovation to the auditorium, foyers, bars, ticketing and merchandising facilities, it boasts state-of-the-art facilities throughout. The renovation was completed with a holistic approach to theatre design, focusing equally on the patron experience as well as those that work within its walls. The design resonates for each of these groups for its innovation, comfort and accessibility."
