The smash-hit London musical makes its U.S. premiere. It’s 1895, and Annie Londonderry wants to discover if a woman can ride a bicycle around the world. The problem? She’s only ridden one twice! As Annie and her unwitting secretary Martha share unbelievable adventures across four continents, they learn that no matter how far we ride, our past is always right behind us. With a high-energy score and a wildly versatile cast, this fresh and funny show is what Theatre Weekly called “an amazing piece of theatre and a must-watch for everyone.”\n\nThis production includes strong language.\n\nTotal running time: One hour and 30 minutes (one act with no intermission).\n\nVicki and Carl Zeiger Insights Seminar: Tuesday, April 2 at 6:00 p.m.\n\nPost Show Forum: Tuesday, April 9; Wednesday, April 10; and Wednesday, April 24 (evening performance).\n\nOpen-Caption Performance: Saturday, April 20 at 2:00 p.m.\n\nRide is supported by production sponsors The Joseph Cohen and Martha Farish New Play Development Fund and artist sponsors Alicia and Jonathan Atun (for director Sarah Meadows) Sandy and Arthur* Levinson (for music director Dan Green), Sue and Edward \"Duff\" Sanderson (for Alex Finke), and Richard and Shari Sapp (for Livvy Marcus).\n\nDigital Program\n\nDownload the program PDF"
