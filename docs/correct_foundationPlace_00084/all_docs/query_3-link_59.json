With a unique and critical perspective on the whole of the NIH, the Director is responsible for providing leadership to the Institutes and for constantly identifying needs and opportunities, especially for efforts that involve multiple Institutes.\n\nThe Director stays in touch with each Institute's priorities and accomplishments through:\n\nregular senior staff meetings,\n\ndiscussions with scientific interest groups, and\n\nbriefing sessions with Institute directors.\n\nThe Director also seeks advice from the Advisory Committee to the Director, Council of Councils, Scientific Management Review Board, and the Clinical Center Research Hospital Board. These are federal advisory committees comprised of members who are independent of NIH and have the required expertise to advise the NIH Director on major decisions on plans and policies affecting the NIH. The Director also receives advice through discussions with the Administration, usually through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and with the Congress.\n\nThe NIH Director is responsible for advising the President on his annual budget request to Congress on the basis of extensive discussions with the Institute Directors.\n\nThe position of the NIH Director became presidentially appointed with the passage of the National Cancer Act of 1971 and Senate confirmed with the National Cancer Act Amendments of 1974. Prior to 1971, all NIH Directors were appointed by the Surgeon General, with the exception of Robert Q. Marston, who was appointed by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.\n\nRelated Links"
