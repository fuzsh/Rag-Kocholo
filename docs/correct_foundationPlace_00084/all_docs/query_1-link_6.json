        "text": "The world-renowned Lyric Opera of Chicago performs in one of North America's most beautiful opera houses, the Lyric Opera House at 20 North Wacker Drive.\n\nOpened as the Civic Opera House in 1929, the building was the vision of utility magnate Samuel Insull (1859–1938), a populist billionaire known as \"the Prince of Electricity.\" Insull, the president of the Chicago Civic Opera Association, wanted to erect a new opera house to replace Louis B. Sullivan's Auditorium Building on South Michigan Avenue as the home of the Chicago Civic Opera — one that would be democratic in scope, and would be housed in and supported by a commercial office building. He mandated five requisites for the new opera house:\n\nsafety\n\nexcellent sight lines\n\ncomfortable seating\n\ngracious surroundings\n\npremium acoustics\n\nIn 1993, Lyric Opera of Chicago purchased all of the theater and backstage space in the Civic Opera Building. Previously Lyric Opera had rented the auditorium and backstage areas.\n\nA massive $100-million renovation of the backstage area commenced in 1993, and continued during Lyric's off-seasons (mid-March through early September) through 1996. The improvements made during this project allowed Lyric Opera to continue producing world-class opera well into the 21st century. The purchase and renovation was made possible by Lyric's $100-million \"Building on Greatness\" capital campaign. The Lyric Opera of Chicago/Chicago Symphony Orchestra Facilities Fund helped launch Lyric's campaign with a $50 million commitment.\n\nImprovements made during the first three phases of the renovation included:\n\nthe creation of a large rehearsal hall that duplicates the dimensions of the mainstage\n\nthe creation of a stage-level scenery handling area that ended Lyric's need to often store valuable sets on city sidewalks\n\nthe replacement of outdated stage rigging and lighting\n\nupdating of electrical and mechanical systems\n\ninstallation of new heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems throughout the backstage areas and in the Lyric Opera House itself\n\nimproved and expanded patron restrooms\n\nupdating of facilities for persons with disabilities\n\nredesign of the mezzanine lobby\n\nthe addition and renovation of dressing rooms, locker space and lounges for artists, orchestra, chorus, ballet and stagehands\n\nthe renovation of backstage office space for production and rehearsal personnel\n\nThe final phase of renovations took place between early April and early August of 1996 when all 3,563 seats, along with the carpeting, were removed from the auditorium so that artisans could clean and completely repaint. Previously, the theater had never been fully repainted since it opened in 1929 — just patched and touched up as needed over the years.\n\nDuring the summer of 1996 more than 30 highly skilled artisans from around the country worked in the Lyric Opera House six days a week, 10 hours a day, applying 2,000 gallons of gold paint to the elegant ornamentation of the auditorium, Rice Grand Foyer, and all lobbies. The painters also hand-stenciled and hand-detailed the exquisite colorful ornamentation that adorns the Lyric Opera House ceilings.\n\nEvery seat in the auditorium was beautifully refurbished for the first time since 1929. The metal portions were repainted and the wood arms were refinished; the upholstery, seat and back of each chair were replaced. 6,000 square yards of new deep-red carpeting were installed in the theater and lobbies of the Lyric Opera House. The 31 boxes on the mezzanine level were rebuilt and enlarged by 18 inches.\n\nA new 500-pound mainstage curtain was installed, made of 580 yards of heavy-weight wool velour and silk fringe to replicate the original 1929 curtain. All the bronze decorative features and railings in the Lyric Opera House were polished to a just-like-new sheen. The beautiful travertine marble was thoroughly cleaned.\n\nBackstage, a 40-foot-high, 40,000-pound soundproof door was installed to acoustically separate the scenery handling area from the mainstage. During the renovation 32 miles of new rope and cable were installed backstage to update the scenery rigging system. Additionally, 170 miles of electrical wiring and 38 miles of electrical conduit were installed throughout the Lyric Opera House."
