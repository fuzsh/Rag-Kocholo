Through time and financial support, we invite you to become a champion for the Lyric Theatre’s extensive community and invest in the future potential of our actors, writers, creatives, young people, and citizens.\n\nWe’re a not-for-profit theatre that is proud to be a charity. On top of ticket sales, we need to raise a further £2m a year to keep our doors open – to allow anyone to be able to experience, make and benefit from amazing theatre.\n\nSupporting the Lyric Theatre is an investment in the cultural life of Northern Ireland; in its talent and international reputation. There are lots of ways you can help."
