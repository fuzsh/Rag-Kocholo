        "text": "What are the lyrics to ‘Christ is Made the Sure Foundation’, the coronation hymn?\n\nThis ancient hymn will be sung during King Charles’s National Service of Thanksgiving at St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh, more than 13 decades after it was written. Here are its lyrics.\n\n‘Christ is Made the Sure Foundation’ was one of the hymns being performed at the coronation of King Charles III on Saturday 6 May 2023 at Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe historic hymn comes from the second part of the Urbs beata Jerusalem, a plainchant thought to have been written in either the 6th or 7th centuries.\n\nWhile the hymn is featured in some of the oldest hymnals in the world, today’s modern-day translation and setting is a particular favourite of the royal family, with the new British monarch also having chosen the work for his wedding ceremony to first wife, Princess Diana in 1981.\n\nHere’s everything we know about the ancient hymn which will be sung after Camilla Queen Consort is crowned alongside her husband.\n\nRead more: What is the order of service for King Charles’ coronation on 6 May?\n\nWho wrote the lyrics to ‘Christ is Made the Sure Foundation’?\n\nThe ancient hymn was translated into English from Latin by John Mason Neale, an Anglican hymn-writer and priest, in 1851.\n\nDuring Neale’s lifetime, the scholar translated over 100 different hymns from languages including Latin and Greek.\n\nPerhaps Neale’s most famous hymn is the Christmas carol ‘Good King Wenceslas’, the lyrics of which he translated from a Czech poem by Václav Alois Svoboda.\n\nThe second part of the Urbs beata Jerusalem, which ‘Christ is Made the Sure Foundation’ comes from, would have been sung at daybreak at lauds, which is a morning service within the Christian Church. King Charles III’s coronation begins at 11am on Saturday 6 May, so the programming of this piece ties in with its historic significance.\n\nRead more: Praise, my soul, the King of heaven: what are the lyrics and who wrote the hymn?\n\nWho wrote the music to ‘Christ is Made the Sure Foundation’?\n\nThere are two tunes associated with the hymn ‘Christ is Made the Sure Foundation’.\n\nThe first, which is being sung at the coronation of King Charles III, was written by Henry Purcell, and suitably is taken from his piece titled, ‘Westminster Abbey’.\n\nPurcell himself is buried in the English cathedral where King Charles III’s coronation will be taking place.\n\nThe other musical setting to which this hymn is sometimes sung is titled ‘Regent Square’ by English organist Henry Smart.\n\nRead more: Westminster Abbey – everything you need to know about Britain’s royal home of coronations\n\nWhat are the lyrics to ‘Christ is Made the Sure Foundation’?\n\nChrist is made the sure foundation,\n\nChrist the Head and corner-stone,\n\nchosen of the Lord, and precious\n\nbinding all the church in one,\n\nHoly Sion’s help for ever,\n\nand her confidence alone.\n\nAll that dedicated city,\n\ndearly loved of God on high,\n\nin exultant jubilation\n\npours perpetual melody,\n\nGod the One in Three adoring\n\nin glad hymns eternally.\n\nTo this temple, where we call thee,\n\ncome, O Lord of Hosts, to-day;\n\nwith thy wonted loving-kindness\n\nhear thy servants as they pray,\n\nand thy fullest benediction\n\nshed within its walls alway.\n\nHere vouchsafe to all thy servants\n\nwhat they ask of thee to gain,\n\nwhat they gain from thee for ever\n\nwith the blessèd to retain,\n\nand hereafter in thy glory\n\nevermore with thee to reign."
