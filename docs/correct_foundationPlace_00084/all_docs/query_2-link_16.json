See Robert Herrick’s “To Anthea, who May Command Him Anything,” John Clare’s “I Hid My Love,” Louise Bogan’s “Song for the Last Act,” or Louise Glück’s “Vita Nova.”\n\nLooking to learn about poetry?\n\nCheck out our Learn area, where we have separate offerings for children, teens, adults, and educators."
