        "text": "The Council through our foundation LEAF, Inc. supports members by providing exceptional opportunities to expand and enrich their expertise and knowledge in the area of educational administration through statewide annual events. The Winter Institute offers keynote addresses by national experts in the fields of leadership, education, advocacy and related areas; opportunities for members to share best practices with colleagues through smaller sessions; an interactive discussion with the Commissioner of Education about New York State issues and initiatives; and networking for support and collegiality among members through social interaction, group discussions, meetings and workshops. The event also hosts an exhibit hall where companies, associations, organizations and foundations can connect with school leaders from across New York State.\n\n2024 Winter Institute & Lobby Day\n\nCultivating a Culture of Excellence for ALL Students\n\nMarch 3-5, 2024\n\nAlbany Capital Center\n\nAlbany, NY\n\nThanks to Title Sponsor Utica National Insurance Group!\n\nThank you for joining us for the 2024 Winter Institute. This year’s Winter Institute was all about “Cultivating a Culture of Excellence for All Students.” The concept of ALL permeated the opening session from the impassioned message delivered by keynote speaker Dr. Anthony Muhammad to the lyrics in the songs presented by students from the Windsor High School American Bluegrass band, the Butterbeans. If you weren’t able to make Sunday’s keynote, here’s what you missed!\n\nNYSCOSS Executive Director Chuck Dedrick welcomed attendees to this year’s event and then we kicked things off with an absolutely awesome performance from the Butterbeans. The students played instruments steeped in Americana such as the mandolin, accordion, banjo and even a washboard as they delivered rousing renditions of hits like “Jolene” by Dolly Parton and “Brand New Key” by Melanie.\n\nNYSCOSS President, Dr. Jason Andrews was visibly proud of his students as he welcomed attendees and then handed the floor over to Hank Grishman, Superintendent of Jericho Schools, to introduce the recipients of the 2024 NYSCOSS Appreciation Awards, Dr. Phyllis Harrington, Superintendent of Schools, Oceanside USFD, and Dr. Cosimo Tangorra, Superintendent of Schools, New Hartford CSD.\n\nKeynote Speaker Dr. Anthony Muhammad, a renowned International Thought Leader and CEO of New Frontier Consulting, spoke to the crowd about their role in mining NYS’s most valuable natural resource - young minds. He explored the history of the field of education and examined why the ideas and concepts behind the professional learning communities process were important before the global pandemic and why they are even more important as we learn and grow post-covid. He touched a lot on the concept of “all” and the need to work together to ensure that all really means all.\n\nA lyric from the Butterbeans performance of “Brand New Key” rings true as we contemplate the meaning of collaboration and working together to serve every last one of our students:\n\n“I'm okay alone, but you've got something I need”\n\nWe’ve all got something that our colleagues need and our Winter Institute was a great time to share that something and learn from each other.\n\nWatch our Councilgram newsletter for upcoming articles on education sessions from the Winter Institute.\n\nWinter Institute Recordings\n\nSunday Opening Keynote - March 3, 2024\n\n- Appreciation Awards with Thanks to Sponsor Mosaic Associates Architects\n\n- Student Performance - Butterbeans, Windsor CSD\n\n- 2023-24 NYSCOSS President Jason A.
