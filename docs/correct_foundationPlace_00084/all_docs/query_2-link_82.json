This issue is referenced to within the fourth verse of the lyrics \"Though with a scornful wonder men see her sore oppressed, by schisms rent asunder, by heresies distressed.\" When Bishop Colenso was dismissed for his teachings, he pleaded to the higher religious authorities in England.\n\nIt was then that Samuel Stone became included in the discussion. It sparked him to draft a set of hymns based on the Apostles' Creed in 1866. He titled it, Lyra Fidelium; Twelve Hymns on the Twelve Articles of the Apostles' Creed. \"The Church's One Foundation\" is based on the ninth article, The holy Catholic Church; The Communion of Saints.\n\nPopular Hymn Lyrics with Story and Meaning\n\nDay by Day and With Each Passing Moment\n\nJesus Loves Me\n\nWhat a Friend We Have in Jesus\n\nBlessed Assurance\n\nNearer My God to Thee\n\nAbide with Me\n\nHis Eye is On the Sparrow\n\nBe Thou My Vision\n\nHoly, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty\n\nAmazing Grace"
