        "text": "Metallica Scholars\n\nIn partnership with the American Association of Community Colleges, Metallica Scholars is a major workforce education initiative that provides direct support to community colleges to enhance their career and technical education programs. These programs provide skills and services to students looking to enter a traditional trade or other applied learning program. In 2023, we announced the launch of Metallica Scholars Year Five. Reaffirming our commitment to career and technical education, 11 new colleges were added, and we now have programs at 42 schools in 33 states. MSI has impacted the lives of 6,000 students across the US so far.\n\nLearn More\n\nCombatting Food Insecurity\n\nSupporting local food banks while on tour is something Metallica has been doing quietly for years. The creation of the Foundation allowed the band to take this kind of giving to the next level. At every stop, a portion of ticket sales is donated to a local food bank, which we are connected to through our partnership with Feeding America. As the M72 World Tour makes its way through the United States, we are also partnering with The Farmlink Project, which is connecting the tour's catering to local organizations that can use the surplus food, ensuring we do not contribute further to the nationâ€™s food waste problem.\n\nLearn More\n\nDisaster Relief & Community Support\n\nWhether we're talking about natural disasters like wildfires, hurricanes, and earthquakes, a public health crisis like COVID-19, or community safety like that provided by family shelters, we know that funding and support for critical local services are needed in the immediate and long term. In order to maximize our contributions in these areas, we have two primary partners in emergent cases: Direct Relief and World Central Kitchen. For our focus on sustainable communities, the band and Foundation donate a portion of M72 World Tour ticket sales to local organizations providing relief services to women and children who are unhoused or in violent domestic situations.\n\nLearn More"
