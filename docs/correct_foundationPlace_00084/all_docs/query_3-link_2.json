Potential applicants are encouraged to use our website’s Funding Menu to explore schemes based on the career level of music creators involved.\n\nIn many cases, The Open Fund and Women Make Music are the most appropriate options because they cater for projects where music creators work at all career levels. However, there may be a need for targeted support at an earlier career stage, or for more specific next level or international support.\n\nWe have therefore updated our Funding Menu and related landing pages to list relevant schemes based on the below Groups:\n\nFunding for Organisations\n\nIncludes The Open Fund for Organisations, Beyond Borders, Resonate and New Music Biennial\n\nSupport for Music Creators grouped based on music creator career level:\n\nAll Career Levels\n\nIncludes The Open Fund for Music Creators and Women Make Music\n\nEarly Career\n\nIncludes ReBalance, Steve Reid Innovation Award, Lynsey de Paul Prize and Adopt a Composer\n\nThose supported through The Open Fund, Women Make Music or Next Steps schemes cannot apply to Early Career schemes\n\nNext Steps\n\nIncludes Momentum, The Composers’ Fund and The Writer Producer Fund\n\nInternational\n\nIncludes the International Showcase Fund, Musician in Residence programmes and Classical:NEXT Fellowships\n\nSchemes may be listed in more than one Group so that potential applicants can view any schemes which are relevant to their career level. For example, The Writer Producer Fund is listed in ‘Next Steps’ and ‘International’ Groups because it is designed for those looking for next level career support and can include both UK and International activity.\n\nWhat is an Organisation?\n\nThrough our schemes for organisations (e.g. The Open Fund for Organisations or Beyond Borders), PRS Foundation supports projects led by:\n\nPromoters\n\nTalent Development organisations\n\nFestivals\n\nVenues\n\nCurators\n\nLarge performance groups*\n\nThis might include individuals operating as promoters, festivals, venues or all of the above.\n\nThis does not include individual songwriters, composers, artists, bands or writer-producers for which we offer support for Music Creators.\n\nAn Organisation applicant’s projects must involve the creation, performance and promotion of new music and enable songwriters, composers, solo artists, bands and performers of all backgrounds to develop creatively and professionally.\n\n* Large performance groups would include orchestras, choirs, jazz bands or folk groups with 12 or more performers\n\nWhat is a Music Creator?\n\nPRS Foundation classes the following as music creators:\n\nSongwriters\n\nComposers\n\nArtists, bands, producers or performers who are writing their own music\n\nPlease see our Funding Menu and individual scheme pages to see which scheme for music creators is most appropriate for you.\n\nWhat do we mean by women and gender minority?\n\nWe acknowledge everyone who is underrepresented in music and might have encountered barriers because of their gender. As well as supporting cis women facing barriers because of their gender, we welcome applications and will support and empower minority genders including (but not limited to) agender and non-binary people. We welcome applications from trans people (AMAB and AFAB), and we are happy to speak to you if you are unsure if this targeted round is for you, so we can support your application.\n\nWe believe that inclusivity and intersectionality are vital in the steps that we make towards equality and we want to ensure all our programmes are as inclusive as possible. If you are unsure if this targeted round is for you is for you, please email info@prsfoundation.com and someone can speak to you about this targeted round.\n\nFor more information on different gender identities, please see here.\n\nHow do I access an application form?\n\nAll PRS Foundation applications are completed online unless otherwise stated and must be accessed by clicking on the link found on each scheme’s page. Once you have started a form, you can log back in using this link.\n\nAccount details for PRS for Music registrations will not work when trying to start an application with us; you must create an account for PRS Foundation. Please ensure you have read the relevant schemes Guidance pages in full before you begin your application. This will avoid submitting plans for ineligible activity.\n\nWhat sort of projects and activities can you fund?\n\nOur funding schemes support a wide range of activities, including (where relevant to each scheme) creation of new music, performance, recording, release support, commissioning, and marketing and promotion.\n\nIt is important that you check Guidance and Criteria for individual schemes to ensure that you are applying for a project and activities which are eligible.\n\nFor example, our PPL Momentum Music Fund supports UK-based activity so an application including touring in the States within a proposed budget would be ineligible.\n\nCheck out our most recent grantee page and our search facility where you can see projects supported by PRS Foundation over the past couple of years.\n\nWhat is your relationship with PRS for Music?\n\nPRS Foundation is constituted as an independent charity and PRS for Music kindly provide our largest source of income and support us with facilities and office resources.\n\nDo I have to be a member of PRS for Music to apply for funding? Am I entitled to funding if I am a PRS for Music member?\n\nYou do not have to be a member of PRS for Music in order to make an application for funding. However, you are not eligible if you are a member of another performing rights society; you should be in a position to join PRS at a later stage. Similarly, if you are a member of PRS for Music you are not guaranteed funding; all applications received are assessed according to the same criteria.\n\nHow are decisions made?\n\nPRS Foundation has a pool of 200+ independent external advisors who work at the frontline of talent development in the UK and are asked to help to assess applications.\n\nFor the majority of funding schemes, advisors are used to help shortlist applications before a decision panel is arranged featuring a small number of external advisors. Recommendations and decisions are made at those panel meetings based on our funding criteria and the opinions of our expert advisors. This allows for decisions to be made by experts in relevant fields and also enables PRS Foundation to offer constructive feedback where relevant. For some schemes, recommendations for support are taken to the PRS Foundation Board of Trustees. For others, decisions are made by advisor panels on the day. It is important to note timing of decisions before you submit any application.\n\nPRS Foundation’s Grants Team ensures that the right mix of advisors is used for each deadline or panel. We always aim for a fair balance of genre expertise, gender, region, job role/area of expertise, genre, and other areas of diversity.\n\nWe use an extended genre list to build a better picture of your music in order to assign relevant assessors. If an appropriate genre is not on this list please email applications@prsfoundation.com with your genre\n\nCan I apply on behalf of a music creators I am working with?\n\nIf you are applying to one of our schemes for Organisations (see above), then you will be applying for support for projects which involve one or more music creators. You will be asked to name example music creators and to list any confirmed or provisionally confirmed music creators taking part in your project. Our advisors will consider the music creators named in your application when making decisions and it should be noted that for projects where creators are heavily involved, we expect Organisations to have discussed funding with the creator. This is because we may limit the number of supported projects each music creator can be involved in.\n\nIf applying to our schemes for Music Creators (see above), in most cases it will be the music creator applying directly. In some cases, a close representative (e.g. an artist manager, a writer manager) is able to apply on behalf of the music creator.\n\nPlease note that for solo performers or small ensembles playing music written by other composers, please focus your application on the music creator/composer(s) you are working with.\n\nIt should be noted though that any resulting grant is offered to the music creator and that money is paid to the creator. This protects the creator in case a management relationship is discontinued. PRS Foundation does not directly support managers, labels, publishers or other representatives.\n\nFor schemes such as the Momentum Fund or International Showcase Fund, it is common for a manager or other representative to complete applications. However, it always helps for the music creator to contribute, and we often ask for quotes.\n\nBack to top\n\nELIGIBILITY\n\nI don’t think my project is eligible, but should I apply anyway?\n\nIf you’re not eligible, do not apply – your application will not be considered for funding. Check out our useful links for other sources of support.\n\nHow often can I apply? / Can I apply to two different funding programmes?\n\nPlease see our Multiple Applications page for full guidance. Re-submissions of previously declined applications are not permitted.\n\nBack to top\n\nGENERAL APPLICATION ADVICE\n\nHow important is track record and past achievements?\n\nFor the majority of schemes, because of the competitive nature of programmes, we would expect that a music creator applicant has a track record of creating or performing of over 18 months. Organisation applicants will be asked to outline track record of the organisation or individuals involved and should expect that advisors prefer to see a relevant experience of over 18 months.\n\nEarly Career support schemes such as the Steve Reid Innovation Award or Lynsey de Paul Prize may be the exceptions to the above rule but generally PRS Foundation wants to support the creation and performance of outstanding new music, and songwriters and composers who are striving to make a career from writing and performing music.\n\nWhat music examples should I give you?\n\nYour music is an essential part of your application. For most schemes, advisor scores for music are considered as 50% of your overall score. You are therefore advised to submit your most outstanding music.\n\nWe expect direct links to specific tracks or songs as opposed to a landing/profile pages where it is not clear which track an advisor should listen to.\n\nIt often helps to submit music that best represents your current style. It should also be relevant to what you are applying for.\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that links work up to 12 weeks after they’re uploaded – don’t take them down within the assessment period. If you’re using a password protected site or private link, ensure that you provide us with the relevant password.\n\nIf applying for a festival that has an emerging artist stage, please do not give musical examples from established headline acts who do not need support – show us the emerging artists that you’ll be showcasing who are representative of the activity you want us to fund.\n\nI am applying to a scheme which requires or accepts video applications. What are you looking for?\n\nFor some of our Early Career Schemes such as the Lynsey de Paul Prize, Steve Reid Innovation Award, ReBalance and Flash Funding, we require that the decisive questions are answered by video submission rather than written-only funding applications.\n\nThis allows music creators to present a case for support in a less formal way – benefitting many creators, and importantly allows an applicant to show their passion for potentially supported projects. This has been very successful in deadlines so far and as such we now offer the opportunity for applicants applying to Women Make Music or the Open Fund for Music Creators to answer decisive questions by either video submission or written application.\n\nOur tips based on the many applications we have received are:\n\nYou muststick to stated time limits which have been given to allow applicants to be as direct as possible\n\nMake sure your passion for the project comes across – advisors may not get behind your plans if you are unable to get across what the support means to you\n\nFor The Open Fund and Women Make Music ensure that you answer each question point and follow the guidance on the application form\n\nWe do not expect Hollywood standard production, professionally directed or edited video submissions. However, we welcome submissions which reflect the creativity of the applicant.\n\nPlease ensure that your voice is audible and your face is visible (and lit well enough)\n\nMake sure your video links work (e.g. YouTube links are ‘Unlisted’ not ‘Private’)\n\nMake sure your video links are available for at least 12 weeks from the deadline date\n\nI am applying to a scheme which requires written applications. What are you looking for?\n\nWe outline the main criteria within guidance pages of each scheme, and questions ask allow applicants to demonstrate how projects and resulting music will fulfil criteria. We advise making it obvious within your written application how you meet funding criteria.\n\nWhere bullet points are given, please try to answer as many of the points as succinctly as possible. Consider word counts given and try not to waste word count on only one bullet point.\n\nWe do not insist on perfect English. Clear, concise and direct language is often more effective than linguistic devices and embellishments. Please consider that your application is assessed by talent development and music experts and use language that suits the context of your project in the real world. Bullet points can enable you to be more clear and concise.\n\nI don’t know if this is the right time for this project. Should I apply anyway?\n\nNo. Our funding is highly competitive – in The Open Fund approximately 10% of applications are successful. For other schemes, the percentage varies. Please wait until your project is as strong as possible so you can make the best case for our funding. Remember that if you’re unsuccessful, you can’t reapply to us for the same project, and you can only apply once per calendar year for The Open Fund.\n\nDo we need to show scheduled performance / recording dates before we apply to you?\n\nDemand for our funding is very high. For most schemes we ask for an outline of planned activities.\n\nWithin activity charts applicants can outline the status of activity, usually with the options ‘Confirmed’, ‘Provisional’ or ‘Unconfirmed’. In most cases, ‘Confirmed’ activity is prioritised, meaning for example that a UK tour with 6 confirmed dates is more likely to receive funding than a tour with no dates confirmed.\n\nAdvisors are asked to consider activity status within the context of the project, including the context of the main genre music creators work in. This recognises the fact that for some genres, it is unlikely that all dates will be confirmed 12-18 weeks in advance of preferred performance dates.\n\nSome tips for those unable to include ‘Confirmed’ activity:\n\nin your application, show us that you have a track record of making similar projects happen\n\ntell us if you’ve had a conversation with promoters, venues, bookers, agents or performers\n\nif you don’t have exact dates, show us the timeframe and venues you have made plans with\n\nat the very least indicate the types of venues, likely locations or possible studios you might use\n\nIf you don’t have this information, consider waiting for a future deadline as this can influence the final decision.\n\nCan I apply for a programme of activity?\n\nThrough The Open Fund, we support high quality new music projects and not programmes. PRS Foundation’s definition of a project is activity which has a clearly defined start and end date and clear and tangible musical outcomes or objectives that, when attained, signify completion. A programme is defined as a group of related projects managed in a coordinated way.\n\nWe cannot support core organisational costs, salary costs or living costs. We can fund administration costs relating to the project at a maximum of 10% of total budget.\n\nWe prioritise high quality new music projects and cannot under any circumstances support core organisational costs, salary costs or living costs. In some cases we can support a of activity where there is a clear start and end date, or can contribute towards elements of a programme of activity. In this case, show us exactly where PRS Foundation funding will be used, particularly if it will support a mixed programme of already written and new work. Please highlight the performance dates of the new UK music that will be supported by PRS Foundation funding.\n\nDo you fully fund projects?\n\nNo. In view of the size of our grants, we usually expect to make a contribution to an overall budget rather than supporting the whole project.\n\nIt is good to be able to show other income sources. This can be from other Trusts and Foundations, Arts Councils, concert/gig fees, crowd-sourcing, earned income (e.g. ticket sales, record sales, digital download and streaming income, merchandise) and/or in-kind (resources that are given free of charge that have a monetary value).\n\nPlease check the criteria of individual schemes to see if there is a minimum requirement for non-PRS Foundation support (usually between 10% and 25%).\n\nCan I apply for administration and office costs?\n\nYes – you can ask for administration costs of up to 15% of the requested amount*. However, we are unable to provide core funding to organisations, salary costs or living costs.\n\n*This administration cost limit is different for venues and some other organisations for The Open Fund for Music Creators – please see ‘Support for Venues’ below\n\nWhat is the correct music creator fee?\n\nWe are unable to advise on appropriate music creator/writer/performer fees but these should reflect the music creator’s experience and the time it has taken to write the new work. We would advise that you contact the Musicians’ Union for advice on this matter. Although one-on-one advice is not available to non-members, they have free resources online as well as information about how to join.\n\nAm I allowed to make a profit?\n\nFor The Open Fund and Women Make Music at Stage 2, and for most other schemes, we ask that you show us a balanced budget sheet that shows matching income and expenditure.\n\nFor example, a project’s total costs may come to £10,000. Without support from PRS Foundation your projected income may be £5,000. You would therefore request £5,000 from PRS Foundation within your income section in order to arrive at a balanced budget. If your total income projection exceeds your total expenditure, you will not receive the full level of support as you have shown that not all the funding is needed to make the project happen.\n\nIf in your draft budget, even when you include a full request amount from PRS Foundation within the income section of your budget your total costs still exceed total income projections, it suggests that you either need to decrease projected expenditure or increase projected income from non-PRS Foundation sources.\n\nIt is expected that your project should at least break even and contribute towards making your activity self-sustaining in the future. Therefore you can ultimately make a profit – but remember to show us a balanced budget at this stage in the process.\n\nWhat else do you need to see in budgets?\n\nAdvisors have relevant and working knowledge of similar projects so like to see realistic projected costs and income projections.\n\nIt often helps to break down a cost or income projection within our ‘Detail’ column. For example, your total expenditure projection for marketing might be £3,000 so it helps within a ‘Detail’ box to break that down (e.g. “PR campaign for EP release – £1,000; Radio plugging for single – £1,000; Digital Marketing – £750; Design – £250”).\n\nAnother tip is to check that each area of expenditure has a relevant projection of income if possible. For example, if you have included costs relating to touring advisors would expect to see projected tour-related income regardless of how low the income amount may be. Another common mistake is included projected costs of recording or manufacture of releases without included projected recording related income – whether small or large. It is hard for advisors to support recording and releases if there is zero related income.\n\nDo applicants receive the full amount requested?\n\nPRS Foundation try as far as possible to fund the amount you need to make your project happen pending funds available in any particular round of assessments and as long as our panel of advisors agree that the amount requesting is realistic and suitable. In some cases, where support is agreed but a panel feels a lower amount is appropriate, PRS Foundation’s grant will be lower than your requested amount. We therefore advise you to cost accordingly and add realistic income and expenditure figures.\n\nBack to top\n\nSUPPORT FOR VENUES\n\nThe Open Fund for Organisations can support many types of activity, including programming of live music. The size of the grant, funding priorities and a need to support projects rather than year-round work means that typically a venue will apply for:\n\nLive programming (e.g. one or more gigs, all-day gigs, mini-festivals, gigs that focus on specialist areas (e.g. genre, career level, diversity, accessibility))\n\nOpportunities and projects that support the development of emerging music creators (non-programming related work you do to support emerging artists such as rehearsal spaces, workshops, etc.)\n\nMarketing support (so long as there’s still an element of creation or performance)\n\nVery few types of activity are ineligible and PRS Foundation is very willing to discuss potential applications ahead of deadlines. Please feel free to email info@prsfoundation.com for further advice.\n\nUpdated forms for The Open Fund for Organisations include an additional question on track record to allow venues (and other organisations) to show how their track record for similar projects and music creator development will give confidence for upcoming projects. Independent advisors will consider track record as well as project outlines.\n\nFor independent music venues and festivals applying to The Open Fund for Organisations, PRS Foundation recognises that ‘Associated Costs’ (i.e. expenditure not going directly to music creators which indirectly assists music creators in the long-term) may be higher and the current climate means a greater proportion of running costs may be covered. As such, venues and festivals can ask for administration costs of up to 25% of the request amount so long as higher costs are justified in a written application. This may include additional marketing spend, project management costs or other facilities that help creators.\n\nBack to top\n\nSUPPORT FOR RECORDINGS\n\nIn response to increasing demand from applicants, PRS Foundation will now support recording costs through The Open Fund, Women Make Music, Momentum and some other schemes.\n\nRecording costs that we can support:\n\nstudio recording time\n\nproducer fees\n\nlive recordings\n\nrehearsal time\n\nmastering\n\nmusician fees\n\naccommodation\n\ntravel\n\nequipment hire\n\nRelated costs we are unable or less likely to support through The Open Fund and Women Make Music:\n\nartwork\n\nmanufacturing costs\n\nbuilding a studio\n\nequipment purchase\n\nrecordings made outside of the UK\n\nartists based outside of the UK\n\nthose already funded through our Open Funding programmes in the same calendar year\n\nrosters of multiple artists, such as those signed to the same label or management company\n\nCan signed artists or music creators receive support from PRS Foundation?\n\nIt should be noted that for applicants working with record labels, it is expected that labels are making a fair contribution towards recording costs or costs associated with recordings (e.g. release costs, marketing costs).\n\nPRS Foundation recognises the valuable role of record labels and in most cases, signed artists are eligible for support. For example, 50% of Momentum Fund grantees are signed to independent labels.\n\nHowever, in some cases support from record labels – or other companies making significant investments – outweighs the need for funding. It is therefore highly unlikely that PRS Foundation schemes are relevant to those signed to major labels, and for those signed to large independent labels, a strong case is needed.\n\nFor most schemes, applicants will be asked why – if working with a label or another investor – support is still required; and applicants signed to labels are more likely to be supported where the label is making a significant contribution towards projects.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nSuccessful applicants must display the PRS Foundation logo (or relevant logo strips) clearly on the release of any recording supported by PRS Foundation. We must see proof of this before we can release the final instalment of your grant.\n\nCan I apply for funding to record in a home studio?\n\nIf you are applying to record using a home or mobile recording studio, you will be asked to provide examples of previous work created using that equipment.\n\nCan I apply for funding to record with a producer or studio based outside of the UK?\n\nIn most cases, the musician(s) and producer(s) and studio must be UK-based for all funding schemes. An exception may be made – though rarely – for the Momentum Music Fund, or where international recording can be justified (e.g. through The Writer Producer Fund).\n\nWill PRS Foundation own the recording?\n\nNo, PRS Foundation will not own any rights in relation to the recording. However, most funding offer letters include a term allowing PRS Foundation access to use publicly available recordings for promotional purposes.\n\nCan the grant award support additional costs such as travel and accommodation?\n\nYes, you can apply for support to cover the associated costs of your recording. These include: studio recording time, producer fees, live recordings, rehearsal time, mastering, musician fees, accommodation, travel and equipment hire. All additional costs outlined in our criteria are eligible to be included in the same application.\n\nI am a writer-producer/producer composing my own music, can I apply to record in a professional studio?\n\nYes, producers composing their own music can apply to record in a professional studio. We also set up The Writer Producer Fund which supports career development of songwriters and writer-producers.\n\nI am writer-producer composing my own music, can I apply on behalf of an artist I’m working with?\n\nYes, writer-producers composing their own music can apply on behalf of one other artist.\n\nBack to top\n\nSUPPORT FOR MARKETING\n\nFor most PRS Foundation schemes, funding can be allocated to marketing and promotion. This might include PR costs, radio plugging fees, digital marketing costs, design, print and advertising.\n\nFor schemes such as The Open Fund and Women Make Music, we will always prioritise Creation and Performance of outstanding music so please note that projects consisting of marketing and promotion only are unlikely to be supported. We therefore advise that budgets including marketing costs also include costs of Creation (i.e. writing, recording, commissions, rehearsal and/or development of new material) and/or Performance (i.e. at least one performance, premiere or showcase, or a tour).\n\nFor more industry-facing schemes such as Momentum, exceptions may be made allowing applicants to apply for marketing support only where creation and performance of new music has already been financed.\n\nWhen applying for projects which include marketing, it is expected that applicants show an understanding of potential audiences and how to target them.\n\nPlease check individual scheme criteria before applying for funding for marketing.\n\nBack to top\n\nAPPLICATION PROBLEMS\n\nCan you help me to access my account?\n\nIf you are having problems accessing your Flexigrant portal account, or have issues with your username or password, please contact info@prsfoundation.com\n\nHow do I continue working on an online application that I have saved?\n\nWhen working on an application on PRS Foundation’s Flexigrant portal, you are offered the option to save as you go. At any point you can access drafted applications via the ‘My Applications’ on our portal’s home page.\n\nI can’t find my evaluation when I log back into my account.\n\nHave you completed your full programme of activity for which you applied to PRS Foundation for funding? If so, your evaluation should be online and available to complete via ‘My Applications’. In some cases, forms need to be triggered by our Grants Team, or separate forms are required. Please contact applications@prsfoundation.com with any related questions. Please see our Grantee FAQ page (menu above) for further information and a step-by-step guide.\n\nFor any other problems encountered when applying, please contact info@prsfoundation.com.\n\nBack to top\n\nCONTACTING US AND COMMUNICATION OF DECISIONS\n\nCan I contact you by phone?\n\nRegrettably, we are unable to take enquiries by phone. If you email us, we will respond to your enquiry within 14 working days.\n\nCan I contact you to make sure my application has been received?\n\nNo. We receive hundreds of applications at each deadline and it can take some time before they are all processed. You will receive an automated response stating that your application has been received after submission. You can also check the status of applications via ‘My Applications’ on the portal homepage.\n\nWhen will I know the outcome of my application?\n\nDecision dates and timeframes are referenced in the relevant scheme pages on our website. Decision timeframes vary from 1-2 weeks for Flash Funding, 6-8 weeks for Momentum, to 10 weeks for The Open Fund and Women Make Music.\n\nPlease note dates on relevant pages and contact info@prsfoundation.com if you have not heard within our stated timeframe due to high demand.\n\nDecisions are always relayed by emails triggered through our application portal.\n\nIt is the applicant’s responsibility to check inbox and junk email inboxes, and you can check application status via the ‘My Applications’ portal.\n\nIf you have not received an official offer of funding, which includes a notification email and an official offer letter, you have not received support and should not proceed with your project with the expectation that PRS Foundation support is in place. Only when an offer letter is received and returned within the requested timeframe should an applicant deliver on the basis that funding is in place.\n\nDo you give feedback if my application is rejected?\n\nWe realise that everyone works very hard on their applications, but due to the high amount of submissions received we cannot always provide individual feedback.\n\nOur feedback system is as follows:\n\nEvery unsuccessful applicant will receive notification via an email from our funding portal\n\nIf it is possible to offer individual feedback, we will outline a suitable timeframe (most likely saying that we will contact the applicant within 5 weeks with direct feedback)\n\nCommon reasons for applications not being successful are outlined and we will signpost suitable support\n\nFor those in need of more specific feedback, we will highlight an appropriate date for applicants to call the Grants Team. Our Phone Feedback Days usually take place once every four months.\n\nIf the above interventions are not suitable, our notification email may outline alternative ways in which you can get in touch to request feedback. In those cases, please allow up to 5 weeks for a response before contacting the team again.\n\nPRS FOUNDATION DECISION MAKING AND GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE\n\nAll funding decisions are made by PRS Foundation and a group of independent expert advisors, with approval from PRS Foundation’s Board of Trustees.\n\nDemand for support is very high. For music creator applicants, in some cases the average success rate was 8% 2022. Decisions are made based on the criteria stated in our Guidance Pages.\n\nIf as an unsuccessful applicant you are unhappy with the funding decision and believe correct procedure has not been adhered to, please read the below Grievance Procedure. Please note, grievance must relate to procedure not to decisions made. Funding decisions made by our Board of Trustees are final.\n\nGrievance Procedure\n\nIn the first instance, please outline your grievance by emailing PRS Foundation’s Senior Grants and Programmes Manager, Becci Scotcher: becci@prsfoundation.com who has responsibility for day-to-day management of complaints received by the organisation. Becci will discuss your grievance with the relevant grant scheme manager, with funding partners for schemes such as the PPL Momentum Music Fund or International Showcase Fund, or with Senior Management and/or Link Trustees for other funding schemes, and where appropriate will respond within 14 days.\n\nIf you feel this response does not meet/has not met your expectations, please complete the below ‘Making A Complaint’ form.
