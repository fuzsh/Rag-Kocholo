        "text": "My earliest interest in science came with a squint into the plastic lens of a toy microscope where I observed the amazing microbial world of single-cell organisms crawling and swimming across my field of vision. This passion grew through high school, college and graduate school, where I learned to understand life processes at a molecular level. In 1976, my first year as a Berkeley faculty member, I had the great good fortune to attract a stellar PhD student, Peter Novick, with whom I embarked on a search for the genes that control the process of protein secretion. Our chromosomes encode ~ 23,000 genes which encode the protein molecules that make cells and catalyze the chemistry of life. All of these proteins are made inside the cell but some fraction of them, roughly 30% including molecules such as insulin, must be exported out of the cell to work elsewhere in the body. Just as commercial goods are exported by some kind of traffic conveyance, secreted proteins are packaged into membrane carriers called vesicles for traffic within and ultimately, out of the cell. My lab devised genetic and biochemical techniques to discover the secretory machinery in a simple single-cell organism, Yeast. Biological evolution has conserved this machinery such that the very genes and proteins we discovered in yeast have been found to operate throughout our body to organize the secretion of hormones, growth factors, antibodies, chemical neurotransmitters and all the things our body uses for normal physiology. As is often the case, fundamental discoveries such as this one have unexpected practical applications. Yeast cells are used to manufacture and secrete large quantities of clinically important proteins, such as recombinant human insulin. Some of the genes we discovered were also found to be the basis of human genetic diseases. I will discuss some examples of this and how our interests have evolved into a major effort to find the molecular and cellular basis of Parkinson’s Disease.\n\nUnique physical, chemical, and optical phenomena arise when materials are confined to the nano-scale. We are accustomed to making observations and predictions for the behavior of living systems on a macroscopic scale that is intuitive for the time and size scales of our day-to-day lives. However, the building blocks of life: proteins, nucleic acids, and cells, occupy different spatiotemporal scales. Our lab focuses on understanding and exploiting tunable optical and mechanical properties of nanomaterials to access information about biological systems stored at the nano-scale, from neurochemical imaging to agricultural biotechnology.\n\nThe Landry Lab’s work develops synthetic bio-mimetic nanocomposites to impart control over nanomaterial interactions with biological systems for two applications: 1) to exploit the intrinsic nanomaterial infrared fluorescence for molecular imaging, and 2) to exploit the highly tunable chemical and physical properties of nanomaterials for targeted delivery of biological cargoes.\n\nI discovered AI by reading “Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach”. What drew me in was the concept that you could specify a goal or objective for a robot, and it would be able to figure out on its own how to sequence actions in order to achieve it. In other words, we don’t have to hand-engineer the robot’s behavior — it emerges from optimal decision making. Throughout my career in robotics and AI, it has always felt satisfying when the robot would autonomously generate a strategy that I felt was the right way to solve the task, and it was even better when the optimal solution would take me a bit by surprise. In “Intro to AI” I share with students an example of this, where a mobile robot figures out it can avoid getting stuck in a pit by moving along the edge. In my group’s research, we tackle the problem of enabling robots to coordinate with and assist people: for example, autonomous cars driving among pedestrians and human-driven vehicles, or robot arms helping people with motor impairments (together with UCSF Neurology). And time and time again, what has sparked the most joy for me is when robots figure out their own strategies that lead to good interaction — when we don’t have to hand-engineer that an autonomous car should inch forward at a 4-way stop to assert its turn, for instance, but instead, the behavior emerges from optimal decision making. In this talk, I want to share how we’ve set up optimal decision making problems that require the robot to account for the people it is interacting with, and the surprising strategies that have emerged from that along the way. And I am very proud to say that you can also read a bit about these aspects now in the 4th edition of “Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach”, where I had the opportunity to edit the robotics chapter to include optimization and interaction.\n\nI am an Associate Professor in the EECS Department at UC Berkeley. My goal is to enable AI agents to work with, around, and in support of people. I run the InterACT Lab, where we focus on algorithms for human-AI interaction — algorithms that move beyond the agent’s function in isolation, and generate robot behavior that coordinates well with people, and is aligned with what we actually want the agent to do. We work across different applications, from robotics (assistive arms, quadrotors, autonomous cars), to recommender systems, to large language models, and draw from optimal control and decision theory, game theory, reinforcement learning, Bayesian inference, and cognitive science. I also helped found and serve on the steering committee for the Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) Lab, and am a co-PI of the Center for Human-Compatible AI. I’ve been honored by the Sloan Fellowship, MIT TR35, the Okawa award, an NSF CAREER award, and the PECASE award.\n\nIn this lecture I will discuss the problem of untangling cause and effect in Social Science settings, and describe some of the ideas that have been developed in Economics over the past three decades to better separate causality from correlation. Then I will discuss the use of these ideas to address questions in two areas: minimum wages, and immigration. Finally, I will overview how evidence on causal questions has or has not impacted policy makers in the U.S. and other countries.\n\nDavid Card is Professor of the Graduate School and Class of 1950 Professor Emeritus at the University of California. Before joining Berkeley he taught at University of Chicago in 1982‐83 and Princeton University from 1983 to 1996. He has held visiting appointments at Columbia University, Harvard University, UCLA, and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences.

He was President of the American Economic Association in 2021 and co‐recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 2021.\n\nDaedalus Drones, is a site-specific installation/performance work involving the partnership of three major cultural institutions in Hong Kong. The work was installed at the Asia Society of Hong Kong (here’s a link to the 3D video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiUQ-4y15IM&t=257s). The installation showed as a stand-alone installation for a week and was “instrumentalized” in the context of live performances. Towards the end of the hour-long performance, the audience encountered me, screaming with my megaphone. In the Hong Kong, post-2019, context, this is political commentary, the instrumentalization of surveillance technology (the drones), the architecture of confinement (fences) and the megaphone, the instrument of protest.\n\nKen Ueno is a composer, vocalist, sound artist, and author. His music and installations has been performed and installed around the world. He is known for inventing vocal techniques, composing “person-specific” music, instrumentalizing architecture, and for his activism in decolonizing classical music. As a vocalist, he has performed his concerto with orchestras in Boston, New York, Poland, Lithuania, Thailand, North Carolina, and California. Ueno’s writings have been published by the Oxford Handbook, the New York Times, Palgrave Macmillan, and Wiley & Sons. He holds a Ph.D. from Harvard University, and his bio appears in The Grove Dictionary of American Music. kueno@berkeley.edu\n\nI will discuss our current understanding of how the primate brain perceives the visual world, including how it represents faces and objects and how it creates a meaningful representation of a complex, dynamic scene.\n\nDoris Tsao is a professor of biology at the University of California Berkeley and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. She joined UC Berkeley in 2021, and prior to that was professor at Caltech from 2009-2021. She studied biology and mathematics at Caltech as an undergraduate and received her Ph.D. in neuroscience from Harvard in 2002. Her central interest is in understanding the neural mechanisms underlying vision. Her lab seeks to understand how visual objects and actions are represented in the brain and how these representations are used to guide behavior. Her lab is investigating mechanisms at multiple stages in the visual hierarchy, from early processes for segmenting visual input into discrete objects, to mid- and high-level perceptual processes for assigning meaningful identity to specific objects, to processes by which these perceptual representations are integrated into coherent scene representations. Techniques used include: electrophysiology, fMRI, electrical microstimulation, optogenetics, anatomical tracing, psychophysics and mathematical modeling.\n\nShe has received multiple honors including the Sofia Kovalevskaya Award (2004), Eppendorf & Science International Prize in Neurobiology (2006), MacArthur Fellowship (2018). She was elected to the National Academy of Science in 2020.\n\nBoth policymakers and scholars alike are interested in how poor health in childhood could hurt school performance and adult job outcomes, but credible answers have been difficult to come by, especially in low-income societies. In this lecture, Prof. Miguel presents results from a project he has worked on for over 25 years to shed light on how deworming treatment in Kenyan schools — a safe and cheap public health intervention – has changed recipients’ life trajectories and the lives of the next generation. The experimental research approach pioneered in this study has had an impact on economics research methods, and the findings have influenced public policy decisions affecting hundreds of millions of children around the globe.\n\nEdward Miguel is the Oxfam Professor of Environmental and Resource Economics and Faculty Director of the Center for Effective Global Action at the University of California, Berkeley, where he has taught since 2000. He earned S.B. degrees in both Economics and Mathematics from MIT, received a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University, where he was a National Science Foundation Fellow, and has been a visiting professor at Princeton University and Stanford University. Ted’s main research focus is African economic development, including work on the economic causes and consequences of violence; the impact of ethnic divisions on local collective action; interactions between health, education, environment, and productivity for the poor; and methods for transparency in social science research. He has conducted field work in Kenya, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and India. He has published over 100 articles and chapters in leading academic journals and collected volumes, and his work has been cited over 40,000 times according to Google Scholar.\n\nThe last two decades have seen unprecedented volatility in the US housing market. From the subprime boom to the foreclosure crisis, to the COVID pandemic and the new “work from home” era, the period between 2000 and 2022 has been characterized by cycles of boom, bust, and recovery, as well as government failures and policy successes. In this lecture, I’ll trace how both market trends and government actions (or inaction) over this time period have negatively impacted low-income households and communities of color, widening housing and wealth inequality. While there is growing attention to historical harms such as redlining, I will show that contemporary policies are equally complicit in preserving and deepening these housing inequities and argue for a bolder set of policies to ensure greater racial and social justice in housing.\n\nCarolina K. Reid is the I. Donald Terner Distinguished Professor in Affordable Housing and Urban Policy in the Department of City and Regional Planning at the University of California at Berkeley, and the Faculty Research Advisor at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation. Her current research projects include strategies to address homelessness in California, the role that subsidized housing plays in promoting economic mobility among low-income families, and the impact of discrimination in mortgage lending on the racial wealth gap. Her scholarship has been covered in national and international media, including the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, National Public Radio, and local outlets such as the Mercury News and San Francisco Chronicle. Before joining the faculty at UC Berkeley, Carolina worked at the Center for Responsible Lending and at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. She has a BA from Stanford University and an MA and PhD from the University of Washington, Seattle.\n\nI was lured into physics by puzzlement and by joy. Many of us are puzzled by fundamental questions. Why are we here? Where did the universe come from? By probing Nature, we learn that it is far simpler, yet much crazier (farther from our everyday intuition) than we could have imagined. Understanding this is fun, and it blows your mind. I will describe some of the insights, both historical and recent, that have changed how we think about the physical world.\n\nRaphael Bousso was born in Israel and grew up in Germany. Bousso earned his Ph.D. at Cambridge University; his doctoral advisor was Stephen Hawking. He did postdoctoral research at Stanford University and at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara. Bousso was a fellow at the Harvard University physics department and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Since 2002, he has been a professor in the physics department at UC Berkeley. In 2012, Bousso was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society “for fundamental discoveries in the field of quantum cosmology, including the covariant entropy bound and the string landscape.” He was appointed Chancellor’s Chair in Physics in 2022.\n\nEnergy consumption is the biggest source of human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The good news is that we already have many of the technologies we need to eliminate GHG emissions from our energy systems. The challenge lies in encouraging billions of households and firms to adopt and use these technologies.\n\nEnvironmental economists think a lot about how to incentivize the investments and behavior changes we need to mitigate and adapt to climate change. In this lecture, we’ll talk about the central role of energy prices. How we price energy will significantly determine how effectively we coordinate the clean energy transition and who will bear the costs. I will argue that mis-pricing of electricity, here in California and around the globe, is increasing the cost of power sector decarbonization and undermining efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. On a more positive note, I will explain how economic research is advancing some policy and pricing innovations that can support a more efficient, and more equitable, clean energy transition.\n\nMeredith Fowlie holds the Class of 1935 Chair in Energy. She is a Professor in the ARE Department and Faculty Director of the Energy Institute at Haas. Meredith’s research focuses on the economics of the clean energy transition and climate change adaptation. This includes work on carbon market design and implementation, energy market regulation, wildfire risk mitigation, and renewable energy. When she is not teaching or working on research projects, she is actively engaged in advising climate policy design and implementation at the state and federal levels.\n\nIn this fireside chat-style conversation held as part of the Brilliance of Berkeley course, Chancellor Christ and Dean Chemerinsky engage in a conversation about free speech and campus climate.\n\nLink to recording coming soon.\n\nCarol Christ began her term as the 11th chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley on July 1, 2017. Christ spent more than three decades as a professor and administrator at UC Berkeley before serving as president of Smith College, one of the country’s most distinguished liberal arts colleges, from 2002 to 2013. She returned to Berkeley in January 2015 to direct the campus’s Center for Studies in Higher Education, and was appointed interim executive vice chancellor and provost in April 2016 before being named chancellor in March 2017. Christ received her B.A. (1966) from Douglass College, and her M.Ph. (1969) and Ph.D. (1970) from Yale University. She joined the Berkeley English faculty in 1970. Christ has authored two books, The Finer Optic: The Aesthetic of Particularity in Victorian Poetry (1975) and Victorian and Modern Poetics (1994), and has edited or co-edited several others, including The Norton Anthology of English Literature. She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.\n\nErwin Chemerinsky became the 13th Dean of Berkeley Law on July 1, 2017, when he joined the faculty as the Jesse H. Choper Distinguished Professor of Law. He is the author of nineteen books, including leading casebooks and treatises about constitutional law, criminal procedure, and federal jurisdiction. His most recent major books are Worse than Nothing: The Dangerous Fallacy of Originalism (2022) and Presumed Guilty: How the Supreme Court Empowered the Police and Subverted Civil Rights (2021). In 2016, he was named a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2024, National Jurist magazine again named Dean Chemerinsky as the most influential person in legal education in the United States. In 2022, he was the President of the Association of American Law Schools. He received his B.S. at Northwestern University and his J.D. at Harvard Law School.\n\nHow do people think about, and respond to, dangers in the world around them? Does anything change when a person’s goal is to enhance national, rather than individual, security? Can national security decision-making be improved? I will discuss how brain-based research into threat perception contributes to answering these questions, as well as the implications for national security decision-making.\n\nMarika Landau-Wells is an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of California Berkeley. She holds a PhD in Political Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an AB in Government from Harvard. Prior to joining UC Berkeley, she was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the SaxeLab, a social cognitive neuroscience lab at MIT. Her research is broadly concerned with the effects of cognitive processes – including perception, attention, learning, and memory – on political behavior and decision-making. Currently, her research investigates the ways in which the psychological and neural underpinnings of threat perception influence policy preferences, with a particular focus on national security decision-making. She uses a variety of data sources including archival materials, observational and experimental studies, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\n\nIn my lecture, I explore the role of humor as a critique of racial power relations by delving into how comedian Richard Pryor personally and critically impacted the writing process for my essay collection, “Minor Feelings: An Asian American Reckoning.” Thinking in particular about the intersection between comedy and poetry, I will talk about how both forms disrupt and meddle with language as well as create pathways into the unconscious, offering deeper insights into race in America.\n\nCathy Park Hong’s New York Times bestselling book of creative nonfiction, Minor Feelings: An Asian American Reckoning, was published in Spring 2020 by One World/Random House. Minor Feelings was a Pulitzer Prize finalist, won the National Book Critics Circle Award for autobiography, the American Book Award and earned her recognition on TIME’s 100 Most Influential People of 2021 list.
