The present-day Muwekma Ohlone Tribe is comprised of all of the known surviving American Indian lineages aboriginal to the San Francisco Bay region who trace their ancestry through the Missions Dolores, Santa Clara, and San Jose; and who were also members of the historic Federally Recognized Verona Band of Alameda County. The aboriginal homeland of the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe includes the following counties: San Francisco, San Mateo, most of Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, and portions of Napa, Santa Cruz, Solano and San Joaquin. This large contiguous geographical area, which historically crosscuts aboriginal linguistic and tribal boundaries, fell under the sphere of influence of the aforementioned three missions between 1776 and 1836. The missionization policies deployed by the Catholic Church and militarily supported by the Hispanic Empire, brought many distantly related, and in some cases, already inter-married tribal groups together at the missions.\n\nComprehensive genealogical analysis of the Mission Baptism, Death, and Marriage Records from the three Bay Area Missions traces the surviving Muwekma lineages of the late 19th century through today back to their aboriginal villages. The present-day tribally enrolled Muwekma lineages are represented by the: Armija / Thompson, the Santos-Pinos / Juarez / Colos / Armija, the Guzman / Nonessa, and the Marine-Guzman-Peralta, Marine-Alvarez / Galvan, Marine-Sanchez, Marine-Munoz, Munoz-Guzman, Marine-Arellano, and Marine-Elston / Thompson / Ruano descended families.\n\nSISKÃ âE HÃEMETEYA PUICHON WOLWÃOLUM\n\nThe lands of Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve were once inhabited by the Puichon Ohlone tribe of the western regions of the San Francisco Bay Area. Randall Miliken, describes the Puichon Ohlone, in his ethnographic account of the San Francisco Bay Ohlone tribal groups, as follows:\n\nâThe Puichon were the largest local tribe on the west shore of San Francisco Bay. Their lands were along lower San Francisquito Creek [right through the heart of the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve] and lower Stevens Creek, now the areas of Palo Alto, Los Altos, and Mountain View. Their San Francisquito Creek village of SsipÃ¹tca was mentioned six times in the Mission Dolores baptismal records. At Santa Clara they were lumped into the \"San Bernardino\" district with other people from the west of Mission Santa Clara. Some of them were identified more specifically as being from the rancheria of San Francisquitoâ¦Puichon people went to mission Dolores between 1781 and 1794 and to Mission Santa Clara between 1781 and 1805.â\n\nPDF\n\nMakkin Mak Muwekma Wolwoolum, 'Akkoy Makwarep, Manne Mak Hiswi!
