        "text": "Our full-time Foundation Acting course offers a student-centered approach to learning with a strong focus on the individual and their formative journey into training and beyond.\n\nLed by Sam Gibbs, a Theatre Maker and Actor Trainer, the course, based in specialist studios at the Lyric Hammersmith, provides rigorous training that prepares students for the next step in their professional career.\n\nRegular sessions with industry professionals ensure that the intensive actor training is blended with invaluable insights into the demands and opportunities in the performing arts sector. Recent visiting tutors have included Mike Bartlett (Earthquakes in London, King Charles III), Noma Dumezweni (Disney’s The Little Mermaid Live, The Undoing, Harry Potter & the Cursed Child), Sean Kempton (Cirque du Soleil), Matthew Xia (Artistic Director of Actors Touring Company) and Morgan Lloyd Malcolm (Emelia, The Wasp).\n\nThe variety of the material used in classes and projects initiates discussions on relevant topics in today’s world, that promote students’ personal development and understanding. Tutors cultivate a safe, but challenging, environment to encourage students to experiment, explore and embrace their training journey, its failures, and successes. Students are supported in choosing, and discovering, a path that is right for them at the conclusion of the course.\n\n“An incredibly helpful and insightful course that has allowed me to develop and grow not only as an actor, but as a person too. I’ve learnt more than I could’ve imagined, and I am leaving the course feeling more than ready for my next step in life.”\n\nFull Time Foundation Acting Student (2022-23)\n\nThe Foundation course is based in specialist studios at the Lyric Hammersmith, just a 3 minute walk from Hammersmith Underground Station and a short bus ride from ArtsEd’s main building at 14 Bath Road. Foundation students have full access to the resources in the main building, these include the library, canteen, and studio and rehearsal spaces. The latter are free to book outside of timetabled hours. Foundation students also enjoy membership of Young Lyric with benefits that include access to masterclasses and subsidized tickets to main house shows.\n\nThis programme is validated by City, University of London and you will receive a City, University of London award on successful completion.\n\nApplications for September 2024 open 16th October 2023.

Throughout my time at ArtsEd I have been encouraged to take initiative, whether that be bringing my ideas and opinions to the table as an actor or creating my own work entirely. The course has enabled me to discover the power of my own voice and ability and given me both the confidence and reassurance that I will be successful in whatever I pursue with heart and dedication. Things seem a lot more possible now thanks to my year at ArtsEd.”\n\nFoundation Acting Student\n\n“Everyone on the course and all the teachers simply want the best for everyone. The constructive criticism is so clear and encouraging and I always feel like I am improving with each lesson.”\n\nFoundation Acting Student\n\n“I feel like the course was tailored well to help each student with their specific journey to improve in the way they wanted and become self-aware of their improvement.”\n\nFoundation Acting Student"
