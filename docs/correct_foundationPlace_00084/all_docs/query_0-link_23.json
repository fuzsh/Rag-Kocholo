Part rock opera, part reimagined pride parade, this epic production will stage 55 original songs. It’s both a celebration and a gift to the queer canon, expanding the archive for generations to come. Co-directed by visionaries Niegel Smith and Faye Driscoll and showcasing the extravagance of Machine Dazzle’s costume design, Bark of Millions will be brought to life at Zellerbach Hall by an international ensemble of 22 artists.\n\nBark of Millions is a transformative experience that celebrates the power of individuality and human connection. This once-in-a-lifetime event promises to shatter conventions, push boundaries, and bring a bold new perspective to our stage. As in his legendary retelling of American history A 24-Decade History of Popular Music, Mac and his artistic community use music, dance, and drag spectacle to subvert and deconstruct conventional narratives and joyfully, transgressively celebrate queerness in all its forms.\n\nNote: This party-length performance has a running time of approximately four hours and 15 minutes. While there is no traditional interval, there will be no lockouts. Patrons are welcome to take breaks as needed, including to access the bathrooms or bars, and will be admitted back to their seat at a suitable break in the performance.\n\nThis event is part of Cal Performances’ Illuminations: “Individual & Community” programming for the 2023–24 season.\n\nBark of Millions contains moments of strobe lighting, nudity and mature content, and is intended for adult audiences.\n\nProduced by Pomegranate Arts & Nature’s Darlings.\n\nBark of Millions was commissioned by Pomegranate Arts and BAM (Brooklyn Academy of Music).\n\nThe work was co-commissioned by Sydney Opera House and the Berliner Festpiele with additional support by the Ron Beller & Jennifer Moses Family Foundation and Hal Philipps. It was created during residencies at Kaatsbaan Cultural Park, MASS MoCA-North Adams, MA, Irish Arts Center-New York City, and PEAK Performances in the Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University-Montclair, NJ.\n\nLeadership support for LGBTQ+ programming at Cal Performances is provided by Michael P. N. A. Hormel."
