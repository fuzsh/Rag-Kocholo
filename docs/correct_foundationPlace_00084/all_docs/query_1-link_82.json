        "text": "Lyric Theatre of Oklahoma has been inducted into the Allied Arts Foundation as its sixth member agency, replacing the defunct Mummers organization at Stage Center.\n\nLyric will participate in the upcoming Allied Arts drive in February.\n\nThe Allied Arts Foundation brings together Oklahoma City's six major arts organizations. The Foundation raises funds that are allocated to the member agencies.\n\nBesides Lyric, member agencies of the Foundation include the State Arts Council of Oklahoma, Ballet Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Art Center, the Oklahoma Symphony Orchestra and the Omniplex.\n\n\"We are delighted to have a theater as one of our agencies, and round out the complete list of outstanding arts organizations in Oklahoma City,\" said Ray Ackerman, president of the Allied Arts Foundation.\n\nUntil recently, Stage Center was the sixth member agency of the Foundation. The announcement of Lyric's membership to the Foundation has led to comments that Lyric was selected to fill the void left after Stage Center's demise.\n\nClyde Rader, managing producer of Lyric Theatre, disagrees.\n\n\"We're not taking Stage Center's, or Mummers's, place. We applied before Mummers ran into problems,\" Rader said.\n\nAlthough the exact amount of funding Lyric will receive is yet to be determined, Rader is happy about Lyric's acceptance.\n\n\"It's a wonderful idea for Lyric to join Allied Arts. I'm a big believer in all the arts working together for a common goal,\" he said.\n\nLyric Theatre's officers are John E. Kirkpatrick, honorary chairman and founding member; Llewellyn L. Keller II, president; Jack Finley, president-elect; C. Jack Harris, vice-president and treasurer, and Gayle Freeman Cook, vice president and secretary.\n\nLyric's 1987 season will include \"My Fair Lady,\" \"George M!\"\n\n\"My One and Only,\" \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" and \"Ain't Misbehavin'.\" BIOG: NAME:\n\nArchive ID: 289025"
