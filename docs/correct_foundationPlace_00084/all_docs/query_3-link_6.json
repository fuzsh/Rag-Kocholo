O*NET provides this information by linking descriptive occupational information to statistical labor market information. This includes compensation and wage data, employment outlook, and industry size information. Much of this information is collected outside of the O*NET program's immediate scope. Collaborative efforts with organizations such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, Career One Stop, the U.S. Bureau of the Census, and the Employment and Training Administration facilitate these labor market information linkages.\n\nFolder (closedopen) Labor Market Information\n\nCurrent labor force characteristics of occupations\n\nOccupational Statistics\n\nInformation related to economic conditions and labor force characteristics of occupations\n\nFolder (closedopen) Occupational Outlook\n\nFuture labor force characteristics of occupations\n\nOccupational Projections\n\nProjections of future economic conditions and labor force characteristics of occupations\n\nOccupation-Specific Information\n\nVariables or other Content Model elements of selected or specific occupations.\n\nOccupation-specific information details a comprehensive set of elements that apply to a single occupation or a narrowly defined job family. This domain parallels other Content Model domains because it includes requirements such as work-related knowledge, skills, and tasks in addition to the machines, equipment, tools, software, and information technology workers may use in their workplace. Labor market information defined by the industry or occupation is also provided here. This domain is particularly important when developing specific applications of O*NET information. For example, it is necessary to refer to occupation-specific descriptive information to specify training, develop position descriptions, or redesign jobs."
