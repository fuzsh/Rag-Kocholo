Negotiation is an intrinsic part of any kind of joint action, problem solving, and dispute resolution, and may be verbal, nonverbal, explicit, implicit, direct, or through intermediaries.\n\nNegotiators can improve their negotiation skills through confidence-boosting training, practice, and thorough preparation. In fact, simply acknowledging your fears is an important first step in improving your negotiation skills.\n\nHere are three negotiation skills that will help you achieve better outcomes in your personal and professional negotiations.\n\nMany negotiation scholars advocate meeting in person rather than communicating by phone or e-mail. As convenient as electronic media may be, they lack the visual cues offered by body language in negotiation that help convey valuable information and forge connections in face-to-face talks.\n\nBefore talks begin, identify key questions and guarantees that you’ll need from the other side. It’s also important to form a relationship with your counterpart by spending time together and sharing information. Take a potential business partner to a sporting event or out to dinner and try to get a sense of her character.
