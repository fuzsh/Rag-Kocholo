        "text": "The theatre welcomes families but please note age restrictions may be stipulated for certain shows. Parents can use booster seats at all shows, which are available on request.\n\nIf your enjoyment of a show is hindered for any reason, please bring it to the attention of any of our staff on duty at the time who will endeavour to rectify the problem.\n\nThe Lyric Theatre encourages feedback on your theatre experience, please contact us and share your comments on GRCTheatreManagement@tsogosun.com\n\nTickets for all shows are available at the Box Office\n\nWeâ€™re very proud to offer facilities for the hearing impaired to enjoy our shows. Seats purchased in rows N â€“ U in the stalls and AA â€“ BB in the balcony allow access to the Oticon loop system for those patrons wearing hearing aids, which enables customers with a hearing impairment to fully enjoy all performances.\n\nMost hearing aids have a tele-loop option. This is particularly useful in public places such as churches, theatres and airports, where a tele-loop system transmits a sound signal directly to the hearing aid. In our case, the sound signal is fed directly off the sound desk to the hearing aid allowing users to appreciate shows on an equal footing with hearing patrons."
