PLEASE SEND ALL INQUIRIES ABOUT GRANTS TO YIPHARBURGINFO@GMAIL.COM\n\nThe Yip Harburg Lyrics Foundation funds projects that (a) work to end economic and social discrimination and social injustice; (b) provide educational opportunities to low-income and minority students; (c) advance education through the use of musical theatre; (d) preserve and enhance the socially conscious legacy of E.Y. “Yip” Harburg.\n\nTHE RAINBOW TROUPE\n\nBefore he died, Yip created a foundation to promote his vision of a just and collaborative society. Over the last two decades, Yip’s son Ernie with Deena R Harburg, Executive & Artistic Director, formed The Rainbow Troupe, a performing ensemble of all ages and backgrounds. The Rainbow Troupe presents Yip’s “elegant legacy”: to help people laugh and hope in hard times; to show people, through the power and glory of song, that they must act, not sit by passively; and to ask hard questions of society and themselves. Yip urged us all to dare to dream, and to answer the question, “Why, oh why, can’t I?” with a resounding ‘Yes, I can!\n\nThe Rainbow Troupe is a community of professional performing artist mentors and students of all ages and backgrounds. The Troupe provides workshops, performance experiences, internships, and also volunteers in many community outreach programs for the underserved."
