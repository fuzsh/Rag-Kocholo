From the visionaries behind Hedwig and the Angry Inch, Avenue Q, and Spring Awakening, and featuring songs like “We Got the Beat,” “Our Lips Are Sealed,” and “Vacation,” audiences will get swept up into this fiercely fun love story!\n\nFROM THE DIRECTOR:\n\n“I am really excited to delve into the theme of self-acceptance that Head Over Heels highlights,” said Director Mel Martinez. “To speak your truth is scary, but when you are truly yourself, everything looks better—even tastes better! It's like being in love. I also love these characters to bits! This beautiful adventure they go on helps them break the molds society is comfortable with, and I find that inspiring.”\n\nTHE HEAD OVER HEELS CAST:\n\nJessica Coker as Gynecia\n\nDC Scarpelli as Basilius\n\nJacqueline Dennis as Philoclea\n\nJas Cook as Pamela\n\nMilo Boland as Musidorus\n\nMelinda Campero as Mopsa\n\nPeter Budinger as Dametas\n\nB Noel Thomas* as Pythio\n\nNico Jaochico as Ensemble\n\nJenna Van Ommeren as Ensemble\n\nScout Del Real as Ensemble\n\nJulien Gussman as Ensemble\n\nDiella Wottrich as Ensemble\n\nMacey Cook as Ensemble\n\nMiles Meckling as Ensemble\n\nDany Benitez as Ensemble\n\nMegan Soledad as Ensemble\n\nMegan McGrath as Ensemble\n\nHana Phipps as Swing\n\nMelissa Rivera as Philoclea Understudy\n\n*Member of Actor’s Equity Association, the Union of Professional Actors and Stage Managers in the United States.\n\nPREVIEWS: Friday, May 24, at 7pm, and Saturday, May 25, at 1pm\n\nOPENS: Saturday, May 25, at 7pm\n\nPRESS: Saturday, May 25, at 7pm, through Sunday, June 16, at 2pm\n\nCLOSES: Sunday, June 30, at 2pm\n\nPERFORMANCES: Performances run Friday through Sunday, and select weekday evenings, beginning May 24, 2024.

Rent is directed by Kimberly Dooley, assistant directed by Peet Cocke, music directed by Michael Patrick Wiles, and choreographed by Mel Martinez.\n\nABOUT RENT:\n\nSet in the East Village of New York City, Rent is about falling in love, finding your voice, and living for today. Winner of the Tony Award for Best Musical and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, Rent has become a pop cultural phenomenon, featuring songs that rock and a meaningful story that resonates with audiences. Based loosely on Puccini's La Boheme, Jonathan Larson's Rent follows a year in the life of a group of impoverished young artists and musicians struggling to survive and create in New York's Lower East Side, under the shadow of HIV/AIDS. How these young bohemians negotiate their dreams, loves and conflicts provides the narrative thread to this groundbreaking musical.\n\n“This show is a celebration of LIVING—of passion, creativity, justice, friendship—all in the midst of loss, disease, and hardship,” said Director Kimberly Dooley. “I’m deeply touched by the beating heart of hard-won resiliency that sings throughout the whole show. It's a choice to keep LIVING - to keep fighting for joy and connection and meaning while staying authentic to the very real, heartbreaking truths of life and loss all around us. Rent reminds us to keep connecting to our heart until our very last breath, even when it's scary and even when it's hard. We only have this one fragile, beautiful life, after all.”\n\nTHE RENT CAST:\n\nTommy Lassiter as Mark\n\nSleiman Alahmadieh as Roger\n\nKassandra Lopez as Mimi\n\nAnthony Rollins-Mullens* as Collins\n\nAlex Rodriguez as Angel\n\nAndrea Rae as Maureen\n\nLucca Troutman as Joanne\n\nMarshall Forte as Benny / SOL Soloist\n\nIlana Sasson as Mark’s Mom / Pam / Dance Captain\n\nLeslie Chocano as Alexei Darling / Mimi’s Mother / Sue\n\nSydney Jacobs Allen as Mrs. Jefferson / Ali / Vendor / SOL Soloist\n\nBen Lauing as Gordon / The Man / Mr. Grey / Pastor\n\nDany Benitez as Sammy / Waiter / Squeegee Person\n\nMiles Meckling as Mr. Jefferson / Cop / Ensemble\n\nSerene Hammami as Roger's Mother / SOL Soloist / Ensemble\n\nScout Del Real as Cop / Ensemble\n\nSolona Husband as Joanne (3/22-3/23, 3/29-3/31)\n\n*Member of Actor’s Equity Association, the Union of Professional Actors and Stage Managers in the United States.\n\nPREVIEWS: Friday, February 23, at 7pm, and Saturday, February 24, at 1pm\n\nOPENS: Saturday, February 24, at 7pm\n\nPRESS: Saturday, February 24, at 7pm, through Sunday, March 17, at 2pm\n\nCLOSES: Sunday, March 31, at 7pm\n\nPERFORMANCES: Performances run Friday through Sunday, and select weekday evenings, beginning February 23, 2024.

Freedman.\n\nCinderella Enchanted is Directed and Choreographed by Khalia Davis, Vocal Directed by Erika Oba, and Conducted by Jessica Igarashi.\n\nABOUT CINDERELLA ENCHANTED:\n\nInspired by the acclaimed 1997 teleplay starring Brandy and Whitney Houston, this version of the magical fairy tale is reborn with the Rodgers & Hammerstein hallmarks of originality, charm and elegance. The prince is having a ball and all eligible young women in the kingdom are invited for a chance at their happily ever after. After meeting the beautiful Cinderella, the two share a dance but Cinderella runs away before her fairy godmother’s magic wears off, leaving a single glass slipper. The prince must seek out the owner of the shoe and be reunited with his true love so they can both achieve an enchanting fairytale ending.\n\nA FAIRYTALE CLASSIC WITH A BAY AREA TWIST:\n\nBerkeley Playhouse’s production of Cinderella Enchanted will feature a fun spin on the popular tale. Cinderella is a free-spirited Berkeley artist and Prince Christopher is a wealthy Silicon Valley romantic, both wishing for their happily ever after. Berkeley Playhouse is excited to present this fairytale classic featuring a modern and magical Bay Area twist.\n\n“[The 1997 movie] was really iconic and it set the bar for what is possible when you do musicals that are magical in that way,” said Director and Choreographer Khalia Davis. “[It was important that] audiences who are very familiar with that particular version see that reflected on the stage…I’m really excited about the fact that we get to honor and celebrate being able to see Prince Christopher’s life as well as Cinderella’s and that parallel life they are living. Cinderella is this aspiring writer who is fascinated by the world and Christopher is equally fascinated by the world but wants to know what he can do to make a positive impact that is outside of being married or born into royalty…I can’t wait for audiences to experience our version of Cinderella.”\n\nTHE CINDERELLA ENCHANTED CAST:\n\nKennedy Joy Fullard as Cinderella\n\nJennifer Marie Frazier as Fairy Godmother\n\nErika Coyne as Stepmother\n\nJas Cook as Grace, The Stepsister\n\nSam Topacio as Joy, The Stepsister\n\nVinh G.

Season Passes for the 2023/24 Season are available for purchase at Berkeleyplayhouse.org.\n\n“When I think about every show [in this season], the word that comes to mind is ‘alive’,” said Artistic Director Kimberly Dooley. “Every show is bursting with aliveness—not only the joys and beauty of life, but the heartbreaks of life, too, and the struggles that we all go through.”\n\nABOUT KINKY BOOTS:\n\nKinky Boots features a book by Harvey Fierstein, music & lyrics By Cyndi Lauper, is directed and choreographed by William Thomas Hodgson, and music directed by Kenji Harada. Kinky Boots is the big-hearted musical extravaganza that won six Tonys including Best Musical, the Grammy for Best Musical Theatre album and London’s Olivier Award for Best Musical. Kinky Boots features a joyous, Tony-winning score by pop icon Cyndi Lauper, and a hilarious, uplifting book by four-time Tony winner, Harvey Fierstein.\n\nKinky Boots centers around Charlie Price, who has reluctantly inherited his father's failing shoe factory. Trying to live up to his father's legacy and save his family business, Charlie finds inspiration in the form of Lola, a fabulous entertainer in need of some sturdy stilettos. As they work to turn the factory around, this unlikely pair find that they have more in common than they realized...and discover that when you change your mind, you can change your whole world.\n\n“It’s just a heartfelt, heartwarming show about community and that’s exactly what Berkeley Playhouse is about. It’s perfect,” said Director William Thomas Hodgson. “The vision is a celebration of queerness, a community in queerness. As representative as this show has been on Broadway, on the West End, and around the world, I feel like we have our own special sauce in Berkeley. The commodity of this show, the event of this show, is radical acceptance—this love through community, this love of one’s self, and of one’s own desires even.”\n\nTHE KINKY BOOTS CAST:\n\nB Noel Thomas* as Lola/Simon\n\nSeth Hanson as Charlie Price\n\nGrace Margaret Craig as Nicola\n\nNo'Eau Kahalekulu as Lauren\n\nDanny Cozart as Don\n\nMaia Campbell as Pat\n\nElena Ruggiero as Trish\n\nCJ Smith as George\n\nBilly Raphael as Mr. Price / Moishe / Us George\n\nKyle Herrera as Simon Sr. / Locke / Delivery Man / Unhoused Man / US Charlie\n\nJaron Liclican as Harry / Crispin\n\nJose Gallentes as Richard Bailey / Paddington / US Harry\n\nMarkaila Dyson as Maggie / US Lauren\n\nAustine De L­­­os Santos as Mutt / Hooligan / US Mr. Price / Richard Bailey\n\nTosca Maltzman as Gemma Louise / US Trish\n\nWill Thompson as Hooch / Hooligan\n\nSummer Vance as Marge / Stage Manager / US Nicola\n\nMiles Meckling as Angel / US Lola\n\nJesse Cortez as Angel\n\nMalcolm Leon as Angel / Dance Captain / US Simon Sr.\n\nLou Cooper as Angel\n\nKeenan Moran as Young Charlie\n\nJackson (Jack) Ranney as Young Charlie\n\nTenzin Forder as Young Lola / Simon\n\nLillith Era as Swing / Understudy\n\nScout Del Real as Swing / Understudy\n\nMatt Davis as US Don\n\n*Denotes member of Actor's Equity Association, the union of professional actors and stage managers in the United States.\n\nPREVIEWS: Friday, September 8, at 7pm, and Saturday, September 9, at 1pm\n\nOPENS: Saturday, September 9 at 7pm\n\nPRESS: Saturday, September 9, at 7pm, through Sunday, September 24, at 2pm\n\nCLOSES: Sunday, October 15, at 2pm\n\nPERFORMANCES: Performances run Friday through Sunday, and select weekday evenings, beginning September 8, 2023.

Becoming Robin Hood is directed by Kimberly Dooley, music directed by Michael Patrick Wiles, and choreographed by Cat Reyes.\n\nBecoming Robin Hood is a new musical created by Laura Marlin and Phil Gorman, local artists with longtime ties to Berkeley Playhouse. The musical was first workshopped with youth actors in Berkeley Playhouse’s 2022 YouthStage Season and later adapted for its 2022/23 MainStage Season to be performed by both adult and youth actors.\n\nIn this hilarious musical origin story for all ages, the citizens of Nottingham are hopeless…until a few unlikely characters take on the identity of a heroic outlaw who tries to redistribute the wealthy's riches. But is it right to steal? Sherwood Forest brings mystery and intrigue as accidents beget legends, friendships get tangled, and personal dreams grow to reality.\n\nTHE CAST:\n\nTosca Maltzman as Wren\n\nRomelo Urbi as Cooper\n\nErika Cospin as Phoebe\n\nDC Scarpelli as Sheriff\n\nMelinda Meeng as Aunt Ivy / Villager\n\nPeter Budinger as Uncle\n\nBilly Raphael as Friar Tuck\n\nPaul Plain as Little John\n\nChristian Arteaga as Pennyroyal / Understudy for Sheriff\n\nNicholas Jaochico as Smudgestick / Understudy for Friar Tuck & Little John\n\nVanessa Dalpiaz as Madame De La Pauvre / Villager / Ensemble\n\nDonald Martin as Guy De La Pauvre / Vendor / Villager / Ensemble / Understudy for Uncle\n\nKacie Jean Hennessy as Moxy / Ensemble / Understudy for Wren\n\nSamantha Rasler as Mugwort / Ensemble / Understudy for Madame De La Pauvre\n\nDiella Wottrich as Ensemble / Guard / Understudy for Aunt Ivy\n\nScout Del Real as Ensemble / Guard / Understudy for Guy De La Pauvre\n\nJesus Pedroza-Moreno as Understudy for Cooper\n\n“NOTTINGHAM” YOUTH CAST:\n\nDanica Ding as Ensemble\n\nCoco Ambrocente as Bramble / Ensemble / Understudy for Pennyroyal & Smudgestick\n\nGinger Dreicer as Ensemble\n\nRowen Weeramantry as Peewee / Ensemble\n\nJohanna Lins as Guard / Ensemble / Understudy for Phoebe\n\n“SHERWOOD” YOUTH CAST:\n\nCecilia Bayley as Ensemble\n\nMurphy Aldrich as Bramble / Ensemble / Understudy for Moxy & Mugwort\n\nMars Silva as Ensemble\n\nKyle Walsh as Peewee / Ensemble\n\nLily Black as Guard / Ensemble\n\nPREVIEWS: Friday, May 26, at 7pm, and Saturday, May 27, at 1pm\n\nOPENS: Saturday, May 27 at 7pm\n\nPRESS: Saturday, May 27, at 7pm, through Sunday, June 25, at 2pm\n\nCLOSES: Sunday, June 25, at 2pm\n\nPERFORMANCES: Performances run Friday through Sunday, and select weekday evenings, beginning May 26, 2023.
