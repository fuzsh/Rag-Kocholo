        "text": "FOUNDATION LYRICS\n\n1. Fireproof\n\nNothing - will break this faith. The choice - I have made. To stay - free from addictions. A story that repeats itself a hundred fold. I'm tired of telling. Seen the consequences played out in the past. Someone like you or me with insecurities, turns to the only thing they think will set them free. Instead bound by it. Lock and key. Now just another burning wreck. They're life goes down - down in flames. Nothing - would change their fate. The choice - they couldn't make. To say - enough is enough. This could have been you, and it could have been me. If I had a thousand words on a hundred pages. I couldn't tell you how much this really means. This is as personal as it gets. The war outside and within. This is as personal as it gets - this promise is my salvation. This is as personal as it gets.\n\n2. Hang Your Head\n\nThis is the death of a revolution. Like a bullet to your brain. A ceasefire of the weapons. That help us combat a world gone insane. And now this place is just as crazy, as everything we stood against; ignorance, arrogance, vanity and greed - all the bullshit that has no place. I'm losing faith inside these four walls, so I hang my head. I'm losing touch in the ones closest to me, so I hang my head. I'm losing faith in myself, all I do is hang my head. I'm losing it in my one true love so I can't just pretend. That everything is going to be alright. While we breathe our final breath. I'm still beating my fists against the same old walls I've spent my life trying to break. If this doesn't come roaring out of you like the rising sun â Hang your head. If you are doing this for me or them or anyone but yourself â Hang your head. If this is anything less than everything â Hang your head. So what can I do to protect my home. While they rip it apart. I will give every breath to this - will not hang my head. I'll keep fighting for every inch - will not hang my head. I won't let this become another place to hang my head. Live it or leave it I'll take these words to my FUCKING grave. So you can have this when you pry it from my cold dead hands. Cause the older I get the angrier I am and the harder it is to find balance. Focus it and carry it like a weapon. On my side to help me keep my head. Cause this has kept me from finding hope at the end of a gun. At the end of a fucking rope. HANG YOUR HEAD.\n\n3. Evaporate\n\nWhen I was young I used to believe. There wasnât a difference between you and me. But now the separation seems so clear. You keep searching for answers - that will never appear. Every silver lining, has its way of letting you down. It penetrates and it leaves you scarred. This life, at its end - like a building thatâs crumbling. Moving further â towards collapse. I can feel the fibres, like grains of sand. Passing through â my fingertips. And I think of my parents and how strong they used to be. But this world was too much. These addictions have them beat. Isnât it time for change before itâs too fucking late. And this world turns another shade of grey. Your friends fall from grace. And only three words come to mind. But even that doesnât feel the same. When weâre falling apart. This is about to break. This world is ripping itself to shreds. Now ask yourself, what do we have left? NOTHING.\n\n4. Heartless\n\nWhy canât I say no - temptations plague my heart. Like a steel-trap â Iâm caught can't turn away. How will I get up from these sheets and walk away. How many times can I pass through the fire, before I get burned alive? How can I hurt myself, more than anyone else. How can anyone help me If I canât help myself. Why canât I say no while guilt follows me. Like the shadows on the wall. Shame runs though me like a blade to the chest. This Fear keeps me from letting you in. So Iâll stand alone. Lost and alone. When itâs my actions to defend. And my heart the judge. Iâll find myself guilty. For the things - I have done. I am heartless.\n\n5. Pray For Atlanta\n\nI need your answers â like a hole in my head. I know these stories are nothing more than myths. I feel the only truth is one we make for ourselves. I choose to respect this life â no concern for what comes next. You just waste every second you have left. I need your truth like a rope around my neck. Your promise of âloveâ I can not trust. Your âlight in the darkâ I refuse to see. Your fucking answers. This force fed guilt. These falsehoods. I donât need. Refuse to believe. I will not surrender, or bow my head in shame. I will not bend a single knee. To uphold your tradition. Tie the knot on the noose. Kick the chair from underneath. Load one in the chamber â point the barrel and FUCKING squeeze. I need your answers like a hole in my head. This spiritual suicide I will commit.\n\nSubmits, comments, corrections are welcomed at webmaster@darklyrics.com\n\nFOUNDATION LYRICS"
