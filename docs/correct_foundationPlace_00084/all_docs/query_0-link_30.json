Biologists Gabby and Lauren are studying this centuries-old question when their University funding dries up. Determined to make a splash, they decide to take the next logical step to raise money and awareness…produce a musical!\n\nBrimming with humor, heart, and an obnoxious amount of fish puns, ARISTOTLE, FREUD, MOBSTERS, AND GONADS!: THE EEL MUSICAL is sure to hook audiences everywhere.\n\nArtist Biographies\n\nCelina Demos (Music, Lyrics, Libretto, Direction, Charlotte the Piano Player): Celina Demos is a musical theatre-loving rascal who enjoys, in no particular order: tarot cards, local politics, tattoos, her dear husband and daughter, ice cream with an extra-small spoon, Stephen Sondheim and (of course) eels. She is grateful to Tony, her dream cast of talented actors, her family, and early listeners of EELS! For making this workshop/reading possible. This is her first full-length musical.\n\nTony Eiras (Music, Arrangement): Tony Eiras is a musical director, conductor, composer and teacher. Tony Eiras’ choral compositions have been recorded by the Laudamus Singers and Orchestra, and are performed in parishes and churches throughout the United States.\n\nJulia Wright (Dr. Gabriella Cunningham): Julia is super excited to be part of EELS! And bring to life such a wild and wacky show! Some favorite past roles include Natalie in Next to Normal (Sunnyvale Community Players), Wednesday in The Addams Family (WVLO Musical Theatre), and Piggie in Elephant & Piggie’s ‘We’re in a Play” (Plethos Productions.) When Julia is not performing on stage, you can find her working as a librarian in the coastside town of Pacifica.\n\nShaneen Black (Dr. Lacy Lee): Shaneen is absolutely thrilled to be part of EELS! Some of her Bay Area credits include: “Crystal” in Little Shop of Horrors (South San Francisco High School and Ohlone College), “Marya” in The Government Inspector (Ohlone College), “Nun” in The Sound of Music (Hillbarn Theater and Conservatory), and The World Goes Round, A Musical Review from Kander and Ebb (Cal State East Bay.) She b-eel-ieves this show is hilarious and isn’t to be missed!\n\nFaustino Cadiz (Joey): Faustino Cadiz III (he/him) is a Filipino-American San Francisco Bay Area Educator and Performing Artist. He is an educational leader with a passion for creating equitable opportunities and advocating for socio-cultural diversity and representation within the field for public education in his hometown. Performance highlights include: A Chorus Line (Paul); Yellow Face (HYH & Others); Assassins (Czolgosz); Sondheim on Sondheim. He has also worked with local theatre companies across the Bay Area such as Bindlestiff Studio, SFBATCO, TVRT, CenterREP, amongst many others."
