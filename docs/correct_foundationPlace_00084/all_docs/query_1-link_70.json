        "text": "Six versions of the the song of the international workers movement.\n\nMusic by: Pierre Degeyter, 1889;\n\nWritten by: Eugène Pottier, Paris, June 1871;\n\nEugène Pottier, was a refugee from the Paris Commune, who wrote the poem while in hiding in the aftermath of the massacre of the Communards. Pottier’s poem was only set to music in 1889, two years after his death, and published in 1894, and was virtually unknown until then, so it is very unlikely that he wrote an English version. He only lived briefly in England, spending most of his post-Commune exile in New York, Philadelphia, and Newark. He did a lot of work for the various socialist parties of the time in America, all of it in French and ran a French-language school.\n\nThe International\n\nArise ye workers from your slumbers\n\nArise ye prisoners of want\n\nFor reason in revolt now thunders\n\nAnd at last ends the age of cant.\n\nAway with all your superstitions\n\nServile masses arise, arise\n\nWe’ll change henceforth the old tradition\n\nAnd spurn the dust to win the prize.\n\nRefrain:\n\nSo comrades, come rally\n\nAnd the last fight let us face\n\nThe Internationale unites the human race.\n\nNo more deluded by reaction\n\nOn tyrants only we’ll make war\n\nThe soldiers too will take strike action\n\nThey’ll break ranks and fight no more\n\nAnd if those cannibals keep trying\n\nTo sacrifice us to their pride\n\nThey soon shall hear the bullets flying\n\nWe’ll shoot the generals on our own side.\n\nNo saviour from on high delivers\n\nNo faith have we in prince or peer\n\nOur own right hand the chains must shiver\n\nChains of hatred, greed and fear\n\nE’er the thieves will out with their booty\n\nAnd give to all a happier lot.\n\nEach at the forge must do their duty\n\nAnd we’ll strike while the iron is hot.\n\nAdaptation of Charles H. Kerr translation from the original, for The IWW Songbook (34th Edition).\n\nArise ye pris’ners of starvation\n\nArise ye wretched of the earth\n\nFor justice thunders condemnation\n\nA better world’s in birth!\n\nNo more tradition’s chains shall bind us\n\nArise, ye slaves, no more in thrall;\n\nThe earth shall rise on new foundations\n\nWe have been naught we shall be all.\n\nRefrain:\n\n’Tis the final conflict\n\nLet each stand in his place\n\nThe International Union\n\nShall be the human race.\n\nWe want no condescending saviors\n\nTo rule us from their judgement hall\n\nWe workers ask not for their favors\n\nLet us consult for all.\n\nTo make the theif disgorge his booty\n\nTo free the spirit from its cell\n\nWe must ourselves decide our duty\n\nWe must decide and do it well.\n\nThe law oppresses us and tricks us,\n\nThe wage slave system drains our blood;\n\nThe rich are free from obligation,\n\nThe laws the poor delude.\n\nToo long we’ve languished in subjection,\n\nEquality has other laws;\n\n\"No rights\", says she \"without their duties,\n\nNo claims on equals without cause.\"\n\nBehold them seated in their glory\n\nThe kings of mine and rail and soil!\n\nWhat have you read in all their story,\n\nBut how they plundered toil?\n\nFruits of the workers’ toil are buried\n\nIn strongholds of the idle few\n\nIn working for their restitution\n\nThe men will only claim their due.\n\nWe toilers from all fields united\n\nJoin hand in hand with all who work;\n\nThe earth belongs to us, the workers,\n\nNo room here for the shirk.\n\nHow many on our flesh have fattened!\n\nBut if the norsome birds of prey\n\nShall vanish from the sky some morning\n\nThe blessed sunlight then will stay.\n\nThe Internationale\n\nSource: Eugène Pottier, Chants Révolutionnaires. Paris, Comité Pottier, [n.d. 1890-1900]\n\nTranslated: for marxists.org by Mitchell Abidor\n\nTranslator’s note: Eugène Pottier wrote the “Internationale” just weeks after the crushing of the Paris Commune, in June 1871. Hiding from the authorities, soon to be condemned to death in absentia, he wrote it while waiting to flee to London. Published in his 1887 collection “Chants Révolutionnaires,” it was set to music a year later by Pierre Degeyter, but did not immediately become the hymn of the international working class. In fact, in 1893, when Engels addressed the International Workers Congress in Zurich, the delegates sang the “Marseillaise.” According to the French historian Michel Winock it was the followers of Jules Guesde in the Socialist Party of France who first adopted the song at the time of the Dreyfus Affair, and it was in 1900 that they presented it at the International Congress in Paris. It was only then that the song began its conquest of the world.\n\nThe following translation is a literal one of all the song’s stanzas. Most other translations are meant to be sung, and so radically change Pottier’s original sense. This is the song as Pottier wrote it.\n\nTo Citizen Lefranςais, member of the Commune\n\n’Tis the final conflict,\n\nLet us unite and tomorrow,\n\nThe International\n\nWill be the human race\n\nArise, the damned of the earth!\n\nArise, prisoners of hunger!\n\nReason thunders in its crater,\n\n’Tis the eruption of the end.\n\nLet’s make a clean slate of the past,\n\nEnslaved mass, arise, arise!\n\nThe world’s foundation will change,\n\nWe are nothing, now let’s be all!\n\nThere are no supreme saviors,\n\nNeither God, nor Caesar nor tribune;\n\nProducers, let us save ourselves,\n\nWe decree common salvation!\n\nSo that the thief should offer us his throat\n\nSo that spirit be wrested from its cell,\n\nLet us fan the forge’s flames ourselves\n\nAnd strike while the iron is hot.\n\nThe state represses, the law cheats,\n\nTaxes bleed the poor;\n\nNo duties are imposed on the rich,\n\nThe rights of the poor are empty words,\n\nWe have languished long enough under domination,\n\nEquality wants other laws:\n\n“No rights without duties,” it says\n\n“Equals, there are no duties without rights.”\n\nHideous in their apotheosis,\n\nThe kings of mines and rails,\n\nHave they ever done aught\n\nBut rob from labor?\n\nIn the safes of that gang\n\nWhat is created is smelted,\n\nBy decreeing that they turn it over\n\nThe people only want what is their due.\n\nKings intoxicated us with smoke,\n\nPeace among us, war on tyrants!\n\nLet’s apply the strike to armies,\n\nRifle butts raised on high and breaking ranks.\n\nAnd if they insist, those cannibals,\n\nOn making heroes of us,\n\nThey’ll soon learn that our bullets\n\nAre for our own generals.\n\nWorkers, farmers, we are\n\nThe great party of the workers,\n\nThe earth belongs only to men,\n\nIdlers can go someplace else.\n\nHow many on our flesh eat their fill?\n\nBut if the ravens, the vultures\n\nOne morning disappeared\n\nThe sun would shine still!\n\n’Tis the final conflict\n\nLet us unite and tomorrow,\n\nThe International\n\nWill be the human race\n\n— Paris, June 1871\n\nThe International\n\nMarching Song of the Revolutionary Proletariat\n\nSource: The Weekly People, April 26th, 1924.\n\nAlso Published: in May Day vs. Labor Day, Olive M.

Ye galley-slaves of want.\n\nMan’s reason thunders from its crater,\n\n‘Tis th’ eruption naught can daunt.\n\nOf the past let us cleanse the tables,\n\nMass enslaved, fling back the call,\n\nOld Earth is changing her foundations,\n\nWe have been nothing, now be all.\n\n(Chorus)\n\n‘Tis the last call [Alt. “cause”[1]] to battle!\n\nClose the ranks, each in place,\n\nThe staunch old International\n\nShall be the Human race.\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\n[Evidently alternate first two lines of Chorus,\n\n“’Tis the class-strife’s triumphant,\n\nlast and mighty tug-of-war!”[2]]\n\n2.\n\nThere are no saviors e’er will help us,\n\nNor God, nor Caesar, nor Tribune,\n\n’tis ours, O workers, must the blows be\n\nThat shall win the common boon.\n\nFrom the thief to wring his stolen booty,\n\nFrom the its prison to free the soul.\n\n’tis we ourselves must ply the bellows,\n\n‘Tis we must beat the anvil’s roll.\n\n(Chorus)\n\n3.\n\nThe state is false, the law mockery,\n\nAnd exploitation bows us down;\n\nThe rich man flaunts without a duty,\n\nAnd the poor man’s rights are none.\n\nLong enough have we in swaddling languished,\n\nLo, Equality’s new law\n\n“Away with rights that know no duties,\n\nAway with duties shorn of rights.”\n\n(Chorus)\n\n4.\n\nAll hideous in their brutal lordship\n\nStand king of mill and mine and rail.\n\nWhen have they e'er performed a service,\n\nOr at work done aught but quail?\n\nIn the coffers of these robber barons,\n\nBlind the world’s great wealth is thrown,\n\nIn summ'ning them to restitution,\n\nThe people seeks but what’s its own.\n\n(Chorus)\n\n5.\n\nToilers from shop and field united,\n\nThe Party we of all who work;\n\nThe earth belongs to those who labor,\n\nHence! the idler and the shirk!\n\nSay, how many on our flesh have feasted?\n\nBut if all this vampire flight\n\nShould vanish from the sky some morning,\n\nThe sun will still shine on us as bright!\n\n(Chorus)\n\n1.
