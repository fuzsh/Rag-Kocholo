        "text": "Accessible seating is available at various price levels on the main floor including limited mobility, wheel chair transfer, wheel chair spaces and companion seats. Specific seating options and locations are available on the seating map at www.ticketmaster.com for each event or by calling the Box Office at 480-965-3434 or email at boxoffice@asugammage.com. The front accessible seats are accessed by an elevator in the North lobby. There are elevators on either side of the building allowing access to all levels of the venue, however there are not accessible seating areas on the upper levels.\n\nASU Gammage offers reserved parking spaces for patrons with disabilities.\n\nAccessible parking is available in all parking areas. For accessible seating located in the front of the Orchestra section, please plan to enter on the North side entrance for elevator access. Dedicated accessible spaces are held in the Gammage Lot. When those accessible spaces are full, there are designated drop off areas at both theater entrances. You may drop off members of your party, and then park your car at the Maroon Garage (Apache Structure).\n\nASU Gammage has sound enhancement equipment available at hat check areas for patrons with hearing impairments.\n\nSound equipment should be checked out prior to the performance.\n\nWe have a few tips and tricks for the best experience:\n\n• While headphones are available at ASU Gammage, we HIGHLY suggest bringing in your favorite pair to use with the sound equipment. All standard headphones work with our system!\n\n• Hearing aids containing a small, copper wire called a telecoil are compatible—ask a staff member for more details.\n\n• The volume is adjustable on our new system. Take some time and find the volume that works best for you!\n\nAs a service for people with hearing loss ASU Gammage is equipped with GalaPro. GalaPro provides open captioning for most of our touring Broadway Shows. It uses a text display to provide a simultaneous translation of dialogue and lyrics during a live performance. The service is open to everyone and is visible via the GalaPro App on your smart phone or via tablet which you may check out at our Hat Check rooms. GalaPro may be downloaded via your phone’s App store.\n\nMore information on Gala Pro\n\nCourtesy wheelchairs are available on a first-come, first-serve basis. Courtesy wheelchairs must be checked out and returned to either Hat Check room. Courtesy wheelchairs may be used to transport guests to and from each floor of the theater.\n\nPlease note that staff members are not able to assist patrons in transferring to or from a wheelchair, theater seat or vehicle; operate motorized mobility aids such as scooters and Segways; or provide personal attendant services such as assisting patrons in the restroom, with taking medications, or similar activities.\n\nMobility aids that cannot be stored safely within a patron's immediate seating area will be stored outside the house as close as possible to a patron's seat. At intermission and post show, ushers make every effort to check in with patrons who may need assistance in accessing their stored mobility aids."
