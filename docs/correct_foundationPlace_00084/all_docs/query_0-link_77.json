        "text": "Black History Month and Lunar New Year at Berkeley City College\n\nBerkeley City College will be kicking off its first-ever joint celebration of Black History Month and Lunar New Year with events hosted in the atrium all through this month. The opening event was held on Thursday, February 8 with President Denise Richardson providing opening remarks, followed by music, a slideshow, and a preview of upcoming events. “The influence of early Chinese immigrants on Black culture and vice versa was profound and multifaceted. As Chinese immigrants settled in the same neighborhoods as African Americans, they established a sense of camaraderie born out of shared struggles,” said President Richardson. “It is apropos that we would celebrate the Lunar New Year and Black History Month collectively, while also recognizing the individual beauty and richness of all of the cultures involved.” Students in attendance got a sweet treat from Cupcakin’!\n\nOther events include:\n\nTuesday, February 13th - Motorcycle Club Buffalo Soldiers Historian John Semien Presentation\n\nThursday, February 15th - Lunar New Year Game Day\n\nTuesday, February 20th - Lunar New Year Welcome with President Denise Richardson featuring Lion Dancing, Photo Booth, Well Wishes Wall, & Print Making\n\nWednesday, February 21st - Black History Art Gallery featuring works from Joyce Gordon Gallery & BCC students\n\nThursday, February 22nd - Guest speaker from API Coalition Chyanne Chen (Red Envelopes/Snacks/Boba Tea)\n\nThursday, February 29th - Closing Ceremony with President Denise Richardson & Oakland Artist and Journalist Pen Harshaw (Food by Everett & Jones/Phnom Penh House)\n\nBig thanks to BCC faculty and classified professionals Ramona Butler, Susan Truong, Connie Tran, Gail Pendleton, and Andrea Williams for their work in putting together this schedule of events!\n\nP2P Awareness Week\n\nFebruary 5 through February 9 was P2P Awareness Week at Berkeley City College.
