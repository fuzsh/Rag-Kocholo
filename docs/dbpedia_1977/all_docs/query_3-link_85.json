        "text": "Indians at the Pass\n\nSome writings, notes, and references by Dan Ellis\n\nHistory Buried at Pass Christian was a headline in the Daily Picayune, Thursday, May 17, 1906, on a news story dealing with a meeting of the Louisiana Historical Society.\n\nIt was held in the Progressive Union Hall with Professor Alcee Fortier presiding. Professor Charles G. Gill was recording secretary. W. O. Hart submitted a committee report dealing with a resolution to memorialize the late E. B. Kruttschnitt, General W. J. Behan introduced the lecturer for the evening, Colonel Lewis Guion.\n\nA letter was read that had been received from J. Blanc Monroe, as follows:\n\n“At the request of my aunt, Mrs. Edmund Glenny, I desire to submit to you the following facts in order that you may lay them before the Louisiana Historical Society:\n\n“Some three or four months ago while some laborers were digging a trench on the property of L.H. Watkins at Pass Christian Mississippi, they came unexpectedly upon a human skull. Around the bones of the skull was what appeared to be a crown of silver filigree work. Somewhat lower down, in the position which the shoulders should have occupied, there were found two silver epaulets, and across the chest, a silver breastplate. In addition to this, there were found quite a number of bone beads and some brass buttons, apparently suitable for an officer’s uniform.\n\n“When the digging had proceeded thus far, so much excitement had been created that the domestic servants on the place refused to stay longer, and so Mrs. Watkins ordered the digging to be discontinued and the grave to be refilled. She is, however, willing that an investigation should be made by the historical society, or others interested, and I am personally interested in the matter, because Mrs. Watkins says she can account for the ownership of her property for a large number of years, and is certain that a burial could not have taken place later than 1812 to 1820.\n\nThe crown responded to silver polish applied by Mrs. Farwell, and is undoubtedly silver.\n\nThe crown, and the epaulets, all are handcrafted, very thin. The crown is pliable, bears small\n\nperpendicular marks along the top and bottom borders, and is not a complete circle. Rather, it may be placed flat like a band. Holes at each end are some 16 inches apart. The crown is two inches wide at the trough of the wavelike top scroll and two and one-half-inches-wide from the crest of’ the waves to the bottom extremity. One of the epaulets has perpendicular marks along the edge within a narrow border. The other has just the border, without the up and down marks. The buttons are unmarked on the face, but on the reverse side are the imprinted, or stamped letters that read “Warranted Rich Gilt.” They are 5/8 of an inch in diameter. The cloth to which the buttons were attached is black, wool, and of an open weave, and rough to the touch, like tweed or homespun.\n\nMrs. Farwell said that the spot on her grandmother’s property where the skeletons were found, near an old oak tree was about three-quarters of the way back from the beach road, and near the eastern boundary fence.\n\nShe said the opinion had been expressed that the Old Rice Field, across Henderson Avenue from the Watkins property, had, in the very old days, been either a bay or a bayou\n\nHer belief is that the wearer of the crown had been a pirate and the white beads on the skeleton’s coat had been decorations on the coat.\n\nThe Louisiana Historical Society referred the matter to its executive committee and nothing further happened to disturb the bones on the ground which later became the Lynne Castle hotel.\n\nNotes included with Weigand’s donated script\n\nAt the time of the digging and discovery of’ the skeleton the property was the summer home of Judge Linn Boyd Watkins, a member of the Louisiana Supreme Court, who originally was from north Louisiana\n\nHis daughter, Lynne Watkins, married Rudolf S. Hecht. The Hecht Japanese Garden is near the old Lynne Castle site at West Beach and Henderson Avenue and which for years was a Pass Christian show place. Mr. Hecht was a president of the Hibernia Bank in New Orleans, a president of the American Bankers Association, and one of the founders of International House in New Orleans.\n\nDaughters of Mr. and Mrs. Hecht are Mrs. Evans Farwell (Lynne Hecht) and Mrs. Asabel Cooper (Dorothy Hecht). They became custodians of the silver crown, the silver epaulets, buttons, the beads, and the fragment of wool cloth to which the buttons were attached when the grave was discovered.\n\n******************************\n\nIndian Signs\n\nOne of the early signs of Indian habitation is denoted by the findings of Indian mounds. These can be found throughout the Gulf coast region of southern Mississippi, but many have been destroyed. Presence of these in the Pass Christian area were primarily in the form of Shell mounds. One large mound existed on the shore near to Market Street as shown on an English Map of 1768. Another existed at Bayou Portage near Industrial Park water way which was a natural bayou or stream. Yet, another was known as Shelly Plantation on the shore north of the Bay of St. Louis near DeLisle.\n\nFrom several documents read, these shells were used as cover on Front Street making Pass Christian the first Gulf coast community to have shell roads.\n\nSome old timers can recall Indians who would paddle across from Shieldsborough to market their goods atop a high bluff that once existed on the shores of Henderson Point. Apparently, most of the Indian tribes settled north of Bayou Portage or in Hancock County areas.\n\n**************************\n\nPre-Columbian Indians\n\nCurrent archaeological evidence suggests that man crossed a “land bridge” from Siberia to Alaska and North America long before 15,000 B.C. With the last period of glaciation, around 8000 B.C., the land bridges were closed.\n\nAn expert, carefully trained through long years of study, is required to read the story from clues found in the prehistoric remains hidden within Indian Mounds.\n\nThe Lower Coastal Region has occupation sites of Middle and Late Archaic Period peoples. The Gulf Coast Region has good occupation sites of Early, Middle, and Late Archaic Period Peoples.\n\nThe most populous tribes, the Choctaws with about 20,000 tribesmen, and the Chickasaws and Natchez each numbering about 4,500, had a common language heritage known as Muskhogean. This language was very agreeable to the ears, courteous, gentle and musical . . . . the women in particular were prone to musical sounds representing the singing of birds. There was no written language.\n\nMississippi Indians had a spiritual belief in one God and ceremonialized the sun in worship. The tribal elders maintained calendars based on collective winters. They maintained a universal calendar consisting of knoted fiber with each knot representing a time period.\n\nThe Mississippi tribes were town dwellers following the clan system of social organization with all clans belonging to a national council settleing major problems and the general welfare of the nation.\n\nThe basic foods were provided by the deer and the bear. The deer was most esteemed. Its flesh was cooked fresh or dried and smoked for winter’s use, and its skin served as the principal material for clothing. Antler tips were used for arrow points, and dried deer sinew and entrails were twisted and used for bow strings and as thread for sewing and for weaving fish nets. The deer brains were used for softening tanned skins.\n\nThe bear made heavey winter robes and bed coverings, macassins, and boot leggings. Dried bear gut was used for bow string. Bear claws used for neclaces and ornaments. Slabs of bear fat were stored in clay pots for cooking, hair dressing and body rub.\n\nThe economic life of the Indians was enriched by commerce with other tribes. In business transactions they counted quantity by tens, related to the number of theire fingers. They traded deer skins and bear oil with merchants of other tribes trading for war implements, conch shells, and sheet copper for making ornaments. A popular trade item was an Indian slave whose ankle and heal tendons were cut to keep them from fleeing.\n\nExcerpts from “A History of Mississippi”\n\nArrell M. Gibson, edited by Richard Aubrey McLemore\n\nWhite Intrusion:\n\nThe European intrusion, beginning in the middle of the sixteenth century, provoked drastic change among the Mississippi tribes and ultimately destroyed the aboriginal life style. Hernando de Soto reached the upper waters of the Tombigbee River entering the country of the Chicaza (Chickasaws) in 1540.\n\nNext came the French from Canada. In 1673 the Joliet-Marquette party made contact with several Mississippi tribes in their forages down the River seeking the mouth. Then came La Salle to connect the Gulf with the Northwest and to prevent the English at Charleston from establishing settlements. In 1698, two English traders arrived in eastern Mississippi and took back Indian captives sold as slaves in Carolina. In 1699, d’Iberville sailed into the Gulf to find the mouth of the Mississippi River and to establish settlements. The Europeans demand for pelts led to the extermination of fur-bearing animals resulting in many of the Gulf tribes moving West for new lands. Those who remained were exterminated by measles, small pox, and other diseases introduced by the intruders.\n\nThe Wars:\n\nThe Chickasaws raided other Indian tribes capturing Indians to be traded to the English for slave labor on the Eastern seaboard plantations. The French attempt to befriend the Chickasaws resulted in the French and Indian War which ended in 1763.\n\nThe Natchez Indians were eliminated by 1731 as a result of many intuding French colonists from Canada and by those who abandoned forts on the Gulf of Mexico. The Natchez Indians attacked the French fortifications killing 250 Frenchmen and capturing 300 women and children. Then, French troops recaptured the prisoners and obliterated the Natchez.\n\nThe First French-Chickasaw war began in 1720 because of the refusal of the Indians to banish the English traders from their villages. The Chickasaw waged a series of attacks on Choctaws and French trading and shipping activities. This resulted in an interruption of French commerce so the French initiated a temporary peace.\n\nThe Second French-Chickasaw war took place in 1732 with renewed French demands to expel the English traders. This again resulted in halting normal commerce. In 1736, Governor Bienville waged an all out offense which failed and resulted in the loss of many French soldiers, including friendly Choctaws and French traders.\n\nA third offensive of 3000 French regular army was initiated in 1739 which also failed.\n\nThe long struggle between the French and English colonials ended the Seven Year’s War with the Treaty of Paris in 1763, giving way to the English to take possession of the lands East of the Mississippi and Canada. The French had previously ceded the Louisiana Territory to Spain.\n\nThe new British Colony of West Florida in command by Governor George Johnstone. Because of the wars, diseases and induced slavery, the Indian population had suffered greatly. When the French withdrew their troops, many traders and trappers also withdrew to the Louisiana Territory, resulting in many Indians crossing the River.\n\nMixed Blood\n\nAnother change in the Indian Choctaw and Chickasaw nations was the proliferation of mixed blooded Indians, the Chickasaw with English bloodlines and the Choctaw with French. The growing mixed-blood community in both Indian nations had far-reaching effects on tribal economic, social, and political life. The mixed-blood groups became an aristocracy and were more assertive. The French legacy among the Choctaws is confirmed by the LeFlore line which produced such notables as Greenwood LeFlore. One of the leading Chickasaw mixed-blood families was established by James Logan Colbert, a Scotsman, who in 1729 began a forty-year residence in the Chickasaw nation. Colbert married three Chickasaw women who bore him many children. His sons were principal spokesmen for well over a century. Slowly the religious, social, and political structure of the tribes were influenced by the mixed-blooded Indians resulting in the full-blooded natives resorting to drink or moving on to other lands. With the new tribal affairs being effected by distress and discontent as they were transformed into a new order.\n\nSlaves:\n\nThe new Indian society was also affected by the role play of the Negro slaves who were also brought to perform slave labor for the mixed blood Indians and also for other Indians who looked upon the practice both as satisfying the chores that Indians felt below their dignity such as Agricultural chores and also gave them a sense of status. African slaves were introduced by traders during the 1750s. Slavery fed the aristocratic pretensions of the owners in their drive to emulate white planter neighbors. The slaves built bridges and roads which enhanced the value of the Indian properties which allowed them to negotiate better terms with the Federal government during the Removal Act. Slaves who were formerly owned by English-speaking planters learned the Indian language, thereby serving as a communication bridge.\n\nBritish:\n\nDuring the period of British suzerainty over the Mississippi tribes, British traders used Choctaws and Chickasaws to extend their commercial enterprise into Spanish Louisiana, off limits to other Europeans. Indian traders served as middle men in carrying British goods to the tribes on the Arkansas and Red rivers. Thus, British mercantile depots in the Choctaw and Chickasaw towns of Mississippi were important exporting centers for trade to the West.\n\nFollowing the British takeover of West Florida there occurred a rush of immigrants from the British Isles, West Indies, and the American seaboard colonies. The British armed the Indians to prevent secessionist Americans from invading the area.\n\nBy the Treaty of Paris 1783, Great Britain ceded the territory east of the Mississippi and north of thirty-one degrees to the US. Spain took control of the region south of thirty-one degrees which was the old British West Florida. The Spanish lured the Indians to a meeting in Natchez, Mobile and New Orleans loading them with gifts urging them to join the Creeks in turning the American advance westward.\n\nSpanish:\n\nThe Spanish attempted to disrupt the Indian relations with the Americans by inciting the Creeks in 1793 and again in 1795 to invade the Mississippi Indians. But the Creeks were repelled forcing the Spanish to relinquish their hold on south Mississippi.\n\nAmericans:\n\nFrom 1795 to 1837, the Choctaws and Chickasaws were becoming less populated while adapting to civilized ways of agriculture and cattle and sheep herding. The missionaries introduced religious training and education. The Indian lands were slowly taken away until the Indian Removal Act where all the lands were turned over to the American Government and they were forced to migrate to the Indian Territory in the West. Some remained to receive personal land allotments and remained subject to Mississippi law.\n\nThe Mississippi Indians remained loyal to the Americans during the War of 1812.\n\n*******************\n\nThe Trail of Tears\n\nby Betty Carlin, archivist for the Pass Christian Historical Society\n\nThe Indian Removal Act was signed by President Andrew Jackson in 1830. Tribes east of the Mississippi River ceded their lands for territory in the West. These included the Choctaws and Chickasaws of Mississippi. The Creeks signed another treaty stating that no Indians would be forced to move but could go or stay as they chose. Regardless, four years later they were forced to leave their homes.\n\nIn 1837, a group of Creeks on their way West stopped for five months in Pass Christian. One of their leaders was Chief Tuskina. A deed of land given by John Henderson to his daughter Julia in 1847, lists “Chief Tuskina’s Cabin” as one of the points of reference to that lot. It is believed this would have been located on land that is now north of the railroad and east of Cedar Avenue.\n\nChief Sam Moniac, another Creek leader whose wife was a sister of William “The Red Eagle” Weatherford, died while the tribe was in the Pass and was buried here. The location of his grave is unknown.\n\nA book was published in 1991, called “William Weatherford: His Country and His People” by Lynn Hasty Thompson which mentions Sam Moniac and his death in Pass Christian.\n\nAt least four people from out of state have been trying to find where he is buried during this past year (1994).\n\nIt is strange to think that a town on the Coast could have been a way-station on the infamous “Trail of Tears.” It is hoped that more information about the brief moment in our history will be found as well as the grave of Chief Moniac.\n\n********************\n\nChief Moniac\n\nSam Moniac was an Indian chief from Alabama who had been decorated by General Washington while in New York, and was reportedly buried at Pass Christian in 1837.\n\nEvery year, treasure hunters and other interested parties call the Pass Christian City Hall, the Library, or the Chamber of Commerce seeking information. One of these was the following.\n\nPresumably during the 1950s, Professor Wilbur W. Stout of the English Department of Mississippi Southern University wrote to the Pass Christian Chamber of Commerce inquiring about the location of an 1837 Pass Christian Cemetery.\n\nIn his letter, he quoted the historian Thomas E. Woodard, who wrote, “I have often seen a medal General Washington gave Moniac. He always kept it on his person, and it is with him in his grave at Pass Christian.”\n\n“He reportedly had a plantation near Montgomery, Alabama, and another at Manack (a variant spelling of Moniac) and owned an island in the Alabama River called Moniac. He raised range cattle on his properties as early as 1799.”\n\n“He was married to Betsy, a sister of Red Eagle (William Weatherford). Their son, David Moniac born in 1802, was the first non-white West Point graduate from Alabama. Attaining rank of Major in the United States Army, he was killed at the Battle of Wahoo Swamp on November 21, 1836.”\n\n“Sam Moniac’s father was William, a native of Holland, and his mother was Polly Colbert, whose name connects her with James Logan Colbert (1736-1784), the Scottish leader of the Chickasaw nation.”\n\n“Sam Moniac was mentioned during the Creek War of 1813-14, being the guide who led U.S. Army Brigadier General Ferdinand Leigh Claiborne to make the attack at Holy Ground between Montgomery and Selma near the town of Benton.”\n\nLocal lore has it that Chief Moniac actually did come to the Pass about 1837, which incidently was about the same time as the Trail of Tears.\n\nWilliam Wiegand was one of the founders and a chartering officer of the Pass Christian Historical Society. Much of the foregoing information was extracted from the Wiegand Historical Collection notes. He reported that, there was a grave discovered at the site of the old Lynne Castle Hotel, where silver adornment artifacts were taken out. “The silver ovals, that were believed to be epaulets, actually were medals of the kind shown in portraits of chiefs such as appear in the Oklahoma museum and in the volume on art collectors entitled The Proud Possessors.”\n\nAlthough there were those who claimed the skeletal body and ornaments were those of a hapless pirate having moored his boat at a live oak with an imbedded iron ring, many years prior to it becoming the Linn Watkins’ property and that entrance from the Sound was into a Bay or bayou that faced the area known as the Rice Fields.\n\nHowever, Wiegand believed other researchers who claimed that the beads and relics were more likely to have been that of an Indian.\n\nIt was well documented that Sam Moniac owned many cattle and could have been leading a herd along the southern ridge to be taken to the New Orleans market.\n\nBurial Site\n\nThere is more than enough documentary to support that Sam Moniac died and was buried in Pass Christian, but as to the actual site, many questions remain.\n\nWilliam Wiegand conjectured that the Lynne Castle site where the skeletal corpse was discovered could have been the first burial place for early Pass Christian deaths. He supports that concept with the fact from his notes that “The proprietor of Mount Vernon, John Washington, on July 10, 1843, noted that ‘Mr. C. Conrad came down here for the purpose of interring the body of his wife, formerly Angela Lewis, accompanied by Mrs Lewis, H. Dangerfield, and the Rev. H. Houston of Alexandria. Mrs. Conrad’s body and that of her child were buried near the vault. Mrs. Conrad’s body was left here yesterday by steamboat’. ”\n\nWiegand stated that the original resting place for the remains of Angela Lewis Conrad in all probability was in an all but forgotten Pass Christian cemetery on Henderson Avenue near St. Louis Street.\n\nComments by Dan Ellis\n\nThe above Weigand statement can be refuted by reference to Deed Book 1, page 324, dated July 6, 1843 which reads: “John and Lydia Minturn sold for $4000 to Stephen Franklin before Notary in New Orleans, a 250′ front by 40 arpents, subject to a 50-foot-square front portion set aside as a cemetery plot to C.M. Conrad for a burial place for his wife.”\n\nHowever, there is much to be said for an earlier cemetery which was referred to in the Deed of Gift by the Henderson’s to the Episcopal Church on April 23, 1849 in Deed Book 4, Page 276 and 277, reads that “John and Louisa Ann Henderson gave the church lot to the church Trustees for an Episcopal Church, (Trinity Church). The lot was located at the southeast corner of Live Oak and Church streets, measuring 96′ front on Live Oak by 238′ deep to Avenue St. Louis with a map platting of area drawn into the records. According to the deed description either this location was already used and known as the Cemetery of Pass Christian, or there was a previously used designated area known by that name.\n\nJohn Henderson was one of three developers who took ownership of the Pass Christian peninsula in 1836. It would have been most likely that a cemetery would have been one of the early considerations even before his turning over a burial area to the newly founded Episcopal Church. Even though a very sparse population is listed in the Census of 1820, there were signs of habitation that were shown as ruins in an English map of 1768, and the fact that the peninsula had been possessed by the Widow Asmard sometime prior to English domination in 1773.\n\nTherefore habitation by slaves, pirates, visiting mariners, homesteaders — and later by a garrison of American troops during the War of 1812 — would have lent some consideration for burials in an orderly manner or helter-skelter.\n\n****************\n\nAlabama Historical Reporter — March 1884\n\nBy J. D. Driesback, July 9th, 1883\n\nAddenda to the Paper Published by the Writer on June 28th, 1877\n\nProminent mixed-blooded Indians\n\nAmong the names of prominent white men who mingled their blood with that of the Red man, was William Moniac ( a Hollander) who came with a remnant of Natchez Indians to the Creek nation in 1756. He took a Tuskegee woman, Polly Colbert, for his wife. One of their sons, Sam Moniac, married William (Red Eagle) Weatherford’s sister. He and Sam Moniac were men of fine sense and indominable courage, strict integrity and enterprise, had considerable influence over the Indians. When Sam Moniac went with Gen. McGillivray to New York to see Washington, Moniac was presented by Washington with a medal that was buried with him at Pass Christian in 1837.\n\nSam Moniac was the father of Maj. David Moniac who was killed in the Florida war in 1836, and of whom Gen. Jessup said, that he was as brave and gallant a man as ever drew a sword or faced in enemy. He (David Moniac) was a nephew of Weatherford and David Tate, and a graduate of West Point. His descendants are highly respected citizens pf Alabama and Mississippi. His wife was a cousin of Oscelola the Florida chief, who commanded the Florida Indians when Maj. Moniac was killed. Moniac had resigned his commission in the U. S. A. many years before the Florida war of 1836, and had entered the army as a private with a Company from Claiborne, Ala., he soon rose to the rank of Major by Brevet, and was in command of 600 Creeks and Choctaws when killed, having13 bullets piercing his body, as he fought against the Seminoles in the Florida War of 1836.\n\nHis mother was Red Eagle Weatherford’s siter, which would lead to the conclusion that Weatherford sprang from heroic stock, and his uncle, Gen. McGillivray was said by Judge John R.Campbell to be a regular descendant of a noble Scotch family of a heroic clan in Scotland.\n\nSam Moniac\n\nSam Moniac, operated an “inn” on the Federal Road at Catoma Creek in Southwest Montgomery County (just south of Montgomery). When his son, David was only a year old in 1803, Sam Moniac was approached by Indian Agent Benjamin Hawkins to go with a group of men to capture William Augustus Bowles, “a bizarre character,” who was a Maryland Tory who resigned his British Army commission at Pensacola in 1778 to live among the Creeks. Bowles proclaimed himself “Director General” of the Creeks, and contended against Alexander McGillivray and others for Creek influence. Bowles travelled with sixty body guards, and despite a $4,500 reward put up by Vicente Folch, the Spanish Governor at Pensacola, “no Indian attempted to win the award” until Moniac and his group did.\n\nMoniac and his brother-in-law, Red Eagle, and Hawkins traced Bowles to an Indian Council in May of 1803 at Hickory Ground. When Indian Agent Benjamin Hawkins announced he had come to arrest Bowles, the Bowles supporters showed signs of resistance. Nevertheless, Hawkins told Red Eagle and Sam Moniac to arrest Bowles, and “to the sound of scores of rifles clicking to the cocked position”, Moniac and Red Eagle, with reckless courage, seized Bowles, spirited him out of the most sacred spot in Indian territory, and put him in a pirogue and paddled down the Alabama River. Four nights later, camping on an island near Salem, Bowles stole the boat and escaped, but they caught him in the cane across the River, took him to Pensacola and delivered Bowles to Spanish Governor Folch, who handed over the $4,500 reward, and put Bowles on a succession of ships which landed him in New Orleans and on to Cuba, where he died in a military hospital.\n\nMurder near the Inn\n\nIn the Spring of 1812, a murder occurred near the Moniac’s Inn, which became one of several “widely reported murders of whites by Indians.” Thomas Meredith, Sr., “a respectable old man”, was traveling with his family to the Mississippi Territory, when he was killed by Maumouth, and old Autossee (Creek) chief and some other Indians. Sam Moniac called the killing an accident, but Meredith’s son, an eyewitness, called it murder whilst the Indians were “in liquor”. Problems with the Creeks got worse and worse. Indian “prophets” like Josiah Francis began to stir up the Creeks toward war in the 1812-1813 period, and young David Moniac – then eleven – was most likely witness to a scene of high drama. David’s father Sam Moniac and Sam’s brother-in-law William (Red Eagle) Weatherford returned from a cattle trading expedition in Mississippi in early summer of 1813, and at Tallewassee Creek near Red Eagle’s plantation, the families of Moniac and Red Eagle were assembled (probably as hostages) with Red Stick chiefs and prophets taking “the black drink”.\n\nThe Red Stick leaders included Peter McQueen, High-Headed Jim, and the Prophet Josiah Francis, husband of Sam Moniac’s half-sister Hannah Moniac. These Red Sticks told Sam Moniac and Red Eagle that unless they joined the Red Sticks, they would immediately be put to death in front of their families. Weatherford (Red Eagle) stayed. Sam Moniac, however, refused and mounted his horse to run away. His brother-in-law the Prophet Josiah Francis grabbed his bridle, but Sam Moniac snatched Josiah Francis’ war club and clubbed him hard, riding off in a shower of rifle bullets. From that point Red Eagle fought with the Red Sticks, and Sam Moniac with the whites. On July 26, 1813, after the massacre of the whites at Burnt Corn Creek on the Road to Pensacola,U.S. Army Brigadier General Ferdinand Leigh Claiborne asked Sam Moniac, Dixon Bailey, and David Tate to lead parties in searching for the stragglers or remains of the white troops, and after fifteen days, found Col. Caller and Major Wood lost and delirious in the woods. Even more celebrated was to follow on December 23, 1813 when Sam Moniac guided General Claiborne at the Battle of Holy Ground.\n\nDavid Moniac’s West Point Career\n\nIn 1816, at the ripe age of fourteen, young David Moniac was the first so-called “non-white” to be appointed to West Point. He went to Washington to learn to read and write under Irish tutor John McLeod, and entered West Point on September 18, 1817 at age fifteen. He graduated 39th in a class of 40 on July 1, 1822, and was commissioned brevet Second Lieutenant in the Sixth Infantry.\n\nAfter six months of leave, on December 31, 1822, David Moniac resigned his Commission. Apparently, his father, Sam Moniac had been drinking heavily, and had lost much of his property and fled into the Creek nation to seek immunity from debtor and tax collectors.\n\nSam’s wife, Elizabeth (“Betsy”) Weatherford, managed to hold onto her property, but David’s uncle David Tate wrote for him to come home and take care of family affairs. David Moniac resigned his commission, returned home, acquired property, built a home, farmed cotton, and raised thoroughbred racehorses.\n\nMaj. David Moniac was killed in the Seminole Florida War in 1836.\n\n***********************\n\nFor Further Research on Grave Diggings\n\nThe Daily Picayune of Thursday, May 17, 1906, carried a news story concerning a meeting of the Louisiana Historical Society.\n\nThe news item reported the finding of a grave that could have been that of a Pirate or perhaps the Indian Chief Moniac. (Many calls, even today and throughout the years, come from parties seeking information on the medallion that the Chief always wore and was presented to him by President George Washington.\n\nA letter was read discussing the bones and skull and a crown, and silver epaulets and breastwork that were found in the grave located on the property of Lynn H. Watkins at Pass Christian. The grave was ordered refilled by the owner’s wife.\n\nThis property was later converted to become the Lynne Castle Hotel, as owned by Louisiana Supreme Court Justice, Lynne Boyd Watkins, and was previously his summer home.\n\nThe custodians of the silver archival find are the daughters of Rudolf S. Hecht who had married the Judge’s daughter.\n\nExcerpts below from Internet:\n\nSam Moniac [pronounced\n\n“Manack”], a Creek chief, son of the Dutchman William Dixon Moniac and of Polly\n\nColbert, a Tuskeegee, who was herself daughter of William Colbert, a Chickasaw\n\nchief, for whom Colbert Shoals and Colbert County on the Tennessee River are\n\nnamed.\n\nAmong the names of prominent white men who mingled their blood with that of the\n\nRed man, is the same of Wm. Moniac ( a Hollander) who came with a remnant of\n\nNatchez Indians to the Creek nation in 1756. He took a Tuskegee woman, Polly\n\nColbert, for his wife, who was the mother of Sam Moniac, who married\n\nWeatherford’s sister. He and Sam Moniac were men of fine sense and indomitable\n\ncourage, strict integrity and enterprise, had considerable influence over the\n\nIndians, went with Gen. McGillivray to New York to see Washington, was presented\n\nby Washington with a medal, which was buried with him at Pass Christian in 1837.\n\nI have included the above as a side matter of interest. Dottee Cooper claimed she knew nothing, yet a local neighbor claimed that she had shown him the Indian relics. There are dozens of queries made every year about Chief Moniac.\n\n****************************\n\nFestival of the Dead\n\nFollowing 1835 and the Trail of Tears, when the local Choctaw tribes were driven from their lands from Mississippi’s Gulf Coast, many settled in the Honey Island swamp along the Pearl River and the rivers and bayous of Hancock County and at St. Tammany Parish’s northshore.\n\nAt the invitation of Choctaw Chief Wellee, Pére Adrien Rouquette, the Poet Priest from New Orleans, had the privilege of witnessing and participating in the May 1859 Festival of The Dead on the banks of a northshore bayou which emptied into Lake Pontchartrain. The day for the local annual observance was selected by the chief, who notified other Choctaw tribes by sending out young braves as couriers. Attendance at the feast numbered about 300 Indians who came from all neighboring districts.\n\nIn the mean time, the remaining host members began the many preparations for the festival. Foods had to be secured and prepared as the chief named members of the tribe to handle all the necessary details.\n\nPére Rouquette, named Chata-Ima by the natives, which means “Choctaw-like” was the only white man to ever be invited. He described his journey across swollen bayous treading fallen logs for bridges and having arrived at his friend Kan-ho-he’s lodge where he changed from his black robe to wilderness attire.\n\nIt was near two o’clock in the afternoon. The final preparations were being completed. A temporary shed, blanketed with leaves, covered a large picturesque table laden with flowers and trays of pre-cut meats and yet uncooked foods. Twelve light-footed squaws advanced to halt at pre-marked spots surrounding the shed. They unloaded pine knots from the baskets they carried. Silently the squaws disappeared to return with baskets filled with fuel for the fire. They kindled their fires and drew out their huge kettles which were hung over the smokey flames. The kettles were filled with water as the twelve squaws would remain through the evening in cooking the foods.\n\nIn front of the shed was a large solitary fire where a woman sat in what became a sort of circle as more women arrived with robes covering their heads. In the circle they chanted lamentations in stifled tones with periods of piercing shrieks and shrilling notes of heartrending woe and anguish for remembrance of the dead.\n\nIt was midnight in the moonlit forest before the Banquet was served. The menu was simple; meat, bread and coffee. After the men had eaten their fill, then the squaws came and had their banquet. Pére Rouquette reflected that everything was in such a coordinated order that he was reminded of being in a refectory of some monastery with austere monks and nuns.\n\nSEE more in my Slidell Book – – –\n\n***********************\n\nLocal newspaper accounts regarding the Indian Cemetery are sparse.\n\nIn April 1966, reference was made to the “Indian Burial Grounds” being abused — where local citizens dumped their trash and garbage — because of its out of the way location.\n\nIn October 1973, as caption to three photographs, it was noted that the oldest marker read “Thomas. Son of L. & G. Cobb, June 7, 1890, Age 22.”\n\nIn another reference, Tony Johnson, caretaker, stated that his grandmother had told him that Indians had been buried there for hundreds of years.\n\nRonnie Caire’s Pass Christian History, — is the following:\n\nThere is a legend of the early Indian burials at this site, but there is no verification of this by document or eyewitnesses.\n\nThe Cemetery was given to Good will Baptist Church in 1901, by Guy Northrop. In 1960, the cemetery was expanded through purchase of additional property through various contributions and the special help of Misses Jane Northrop and Christine Northrop.\n\nThe caretakers were Deacon H.A. Bowser and Henry Johnson in the 1970s.\n\n**************************\n\nINDIANS\n\nMany historians report that the Native Indians of the Gulf Coast had originated from the lands across the southern waters. Presumably, the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, Land of the Mayan Indians.\n\nThe ensuing migration accounts concur with Indian legends from the Yucatan Peninsula and from the lower Mississippi valley. A young Mayan Chieftain was told to take a sacred pole and to stand it on its end each day. The direction in which the pole would lean, would be the course of travel for that day. His journey would end when the sacred spear would stand erect without leaning in any direction. Day after day, the spear continued to lead them northerly until they landed on the Gulf Coast. This account also conforms with early history of founding Baton Rouge, Louisiana. (Baton Rouge means Red Stick or Istrouma.)\n\nOver hundreds of years, their culture became greatly modified by the new terrain which consisted of marshlands and low rolling hills. The former pyramid builders altered their specifications by erecting raised mounds along the Coastal high-grounds. Even today there are signs of mounds from Indians of old that can be found in certain sections of Bay St Louis, DeLisle, Pearlington, and Pass Christian. Many of these date back to 500 to 100 B.C.\n\nThe early Spanish and French explorers encountered various tribes along the Gulf coast such as the Bylocchy, Moctoby, Ouma and the Pascoboula (as listed in Iberville’s Journals). Near the mouth of the Mississippi River they encountered the Tangipahoa, Mougoulaschas, and the Bayagoulas; and further upriver they smoked the peace pipe and celebrated the dance of the Calumet with the Nipissas and the Quinipissas. The Indians called the great Mississippi river the Malbanchya. The early Spanish called it the Rio de Palisades or Rio de Espiritu Santo. The early French called it the St. Louis River, or Missicipy or Myssysypy as recorded in Iberville’s Journals.\n\nOne of Iberville’s entourage, Andre Penicaut, reported that “during the spring of 1700, Iberville reported contacts only with small groups [of indians], a male hunting party in one instance; and nuclear or small extended families, one of which was traveling with stored maize and beans.” Indian villages lay deep in the interior far above the limits of tidewater. Native villages were located well inland and coastal sites were typically dispersed with small, seasonal encampments.\n\nChoctaws, the descendants of Chief Chakta and his followers, were by far the strongest Indian tribe in Mississippi. They lived in the Central and Southwest regions and covered the Southern half of Mississippi. Because the tribe was too large to be ruled by one man, the Choctaws divided their people into three groups each ruled by a chief known as a Mingo. Chief Tacala Yarbo ruled the Hancock tribal group from the Devil Swamp’s lower central part of the county.\n\n“The Choctaw dispersed in small, presumably family-based, groups in the Spring after the crops were planted. They subsisted on fruit and aquatic foods until the early summer when they returned to the home community for the annual Green Corn Ceremony. Following this, they dispersed again until harvest time. After the crops were harvested in the Fall, the men were away on the Fall hunt and the remaining villagers gathered nuts and other resources for Winter and early Spring consumption.”, as described by R. Barry Lewis in his Fires on the Bayous.\n\nThe Indians remained shy of the white man following their encounter with the Spaniard, DeSoto. During his 1540s trek along the Coast from Florida to the Mississippi River he killed all Indians he came in contact with. However the French finally made friends with the Indians and by 1730, the Choctaws and the French accepted each other as equals. Intermarriages even produced some Choctaw/Creole leadership as characterized by the famous Chief Greenwood LeFlore.\n\nThrough the years, Yellow Fever epidemics, warfare and colonial encroachment, greatly affected the Indian population. When the Indian Removal Act of 1830 was enacted, the tribes east of the Mississippi River were forced to exchange their home lands for new lands in the West. The Choctaws and Chickasaws of Mississippi were included, as well as the Creeks from Florida. This enforced migration was later called the Trail of Tears.\n\nMany of the mix blooded Indians dropped their Native names in favor of their European family name and discreetly remained concealed in the wooded areas. Not unusually, these names were Favre, Dedeaux, Cuevas, Ladner, Dubuisson, etc. Farve or Favre is a common name for many of today’s Indians who live in Hancock County.\n\nIndians are now, few in number along the Gulf Coast. Much of the Indian heritage has been forgotten. However, we might justly remind ourselves that many of the names of towns, counties, rivers and bayous, and even the State name of Mississippi proclaims the omnificense of their progeny.\n\nFor the amateur archaeologist or Indian lore seeker there are still traces of the native Indian habitat along the Coast. Archaeological components in Mississippi are unfortunately based entirely on the results of limited excavations thereby providing limited data. However, some Indian shell piles called middens still have potential historical significance.\n\nNative Indians created mounds long before DeSoto ever made his Pasada or bloody trek from Florida to the Mississippi River in 1541.\n\n***************************\n\nThis Second location is most probable Burial Site\n\nA church-operated graveyard within the city-limits can be found north of the railroad tracks off Church Street at the end of Toleman Place — surrounded by woods. Historically, this area was known as the Indian Cemetery, probably due to the large number of Creek Indians that had made encampments in the Pass while making their westward journey during the 1835-37 “Trail of Tears.”\n\nThrough the years, these burial grounds have slowly been absorbed by the Goodwill Missionary Baptist Church where a growing number of Negro citizens have been buried. As more and more of the land has been cleared for plots, there is no sign of any but newer tomb stones and slabs that have covered the original cemetery that may have been established there in 1837. If it were so, those sacred hallowed grounds would be the oldest burial place in Pass Christian. In more recent years, the Indian Cemetery is seldom referred to as such.\n\nIn support of the Indian Cemetery are those Information resources that reveal that Pass Christian was a way-station for Creek Indians who were being removed from Florida and Alabama by schooners. They left from Mobile Point, Alabama to stop over at Pass Christian where they reassembled, and then traveled by boat via New Orleans to access the Mississippi River in order to reach its destination at Fort Gibson, Arkansas.\n\nHistory Notes of the Time Period:\n\n● During the War of 1812, American troops had made an encampment in 1815, in the area of Henderson’s Point in preparing defenses against the British attack against New Orleans.\n\n● In 1831, under the supervision of Roger Hiern, lighthouses were built at Pass Christian and Cat Island along with the completion of the Pass Christian Hotel which was built by Charles Shipman, Hiern’s brother-in-law.\n\n● The Roger Hiern family would have been the most active and locally prominent people in Pass Christian during the emigration of Indians and more likely would have decided where the Indian camps would have been located in the years from 1835 to 1837.\n\n● Thirty five hundred Indians were packed at Mobile Point waiting for the Creek Warriors returning from Florida to join them. In July (1837), two hundred Creeks arrived on board the Merchant. Pass Christian, Mississippi was selected (as a way-station). There was such a number sick that many of them died on the wharf. Just as the first load got into the Bay (of St. Louis) many began to die, and the boat had to return to bury them. After making a successful trip the boat returned for another load. Captain Page directed them to break camp and be on the wharf by night to embark. All the sick were brought to the spot, but a violent storm came up that lasted for two days. Page ordered them to return to camp, but they refused. They said it would spoil their Physic. They were very superstitious. Once an Indian made up his mind he would rather die than change it. On July 18 the last load reached Pass Christian. Many more died the next month, which included Samuel Moniac and David Hale. On August 21, two schooners arrived with two-hundred and sixteen friendly Creek Warriors from Florida, and on September 14, two-hundred and eight more departed Tampa Bay in route for Pass Christian.\n\nA likely Scenario\n\nPresumably, as the Creeks arrived by boat from Alabama, they would have landed at the wharf near the land-based lighthouse and were trekked off to Henderson Point where that ground would have already been cleared as used by Federal troops on several occasions since 1815. It would not have been conceivable for the Indians to have been placed anywhere else.\n\nThe two prominent churches, Catholic and Episcopal, did not establish cemeteries until the 1850s. The mass grave that was necessary to provide for 84 bodies in such a short time span between March 29 to July 31, 1837, was most likely under Roger Hiern’s control. The roadway going north from the beaches was called Portage Road (now, Henderson Avenue), which would have provided access means to a hidden away burial field some few hundred yards east of the road.\n\nFurther research would prove interesting in determining exactly how many of these Creek volunteer warriors who fought the Seminole Indians in behalf of the American government under General Andrew Jackson — had died at the Pass.\n\nLocal folklore refers to Sam Moniac as Chief Moniac — perhaps because of the knowledge of the bestowal by President George Washington of a medal. However, the Muster-Roll of deceased officers and soldiers of the Mounted Regiment of Creek Indian Volunteers, refers to him simply as:\n\nNo.14 – Samuel Moniac, Rank of Private – Thlob-thlocco Tribe – Died at Pass Christian, MS, Aug. 21, 1837. Nearest relative was a son, Alexander Moniac, who was a private, No. 2 on list rolls of Co. C, Creek Vol’s.\n\n***************************\n\n“Warrior From West Point”\n\nby Captain Kenneth L. Benton\n\nOriginally published in the February 1974 edition of Soldiers Magazine.\n\nAll forward movement of the attacking force had stopped. In the complete stillness the Major crouched and looked across the obstacle that had halted the advance. The swampy stream was not very wide but he had no way of knowing how deep it was. What he was certain of was that the Seminole warriors they had been pursuing were waiting and watching on the other side of the stream, but no sign betrayed their presence.\n\nHe had to get the attack moving again. There was only one way to do it — with a yell the Major leaped to his feet and charged into the stream, his troops following close behind. War whoops and a ragged volley of shots greeted the assault and the Major’s body slipped beneath the murky waters. A well-placed Seminole musket ball had stopped the attack and ended the story of the first Indian graduate of West Point.\n\nMajor David Moniac was a Creek Indian. His grandfather was a Dutchman who had married a Creek woman. His father, Sam Manac, was raised as an Indian and as a young brave was one of the group of warriors who accompanied the great Creek chief Alexander McGillivray to New York in 1790 to meet with George Washington.\n\nThe resulting peace treaty of 1791 between the Creek Nation and the United States would have a personal impact on Sam Manac some 25 years later.\n\nWest Pointer.\n\nAbout 1800, Sam Manac married a Creek girl and established a tavern south of present-day Montgomery, Ala., where he served both red and white and where his son David was born in 1802. In 1816, young David was appointed to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. under a provision of a 1791 treaty which called for the education of a limited number of Creek children at government expense. The appointment had two immediate effects upon David’s life. The first was that the government appointment named him as David Moniac, the name he would bear for the rest of his life. The second was a trip to Washington to learn to read and write. The training he received at the hands of an Irish tutor must have been adequate for David entered West Point on September 18, 1817 at the age of 15.\n\nLittle is known of Moniac during his stay at West Point or how he adjusted to its harsh, Spartan discipline. He did receive several minor demerits; visiting or being absent during study hours accounted for more than half of his delinquencies during his 5 years. We do know he was somewhat bashful and that as an Indian, he did achieve some degree of notoriety. When the cadets marched to Boston to parade before President John Quincy Adams, people along the roadside pointed him out, saying “Look there! There’s the Indian!”\n\nAt the end of his first year he stood 19th in his class of 29 but at his own request was put back one year. In the next year he was in the upper half of his class but then for the next 3 years he fell steadily in class standing, graduating 39th in a class of 40 on July 1, 1822.\n\nAt graduation he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 6th Infantry Regiment and he left on leave. Six months later he resigned his commission, having never served as an officer in the Army.\n\nPerhaps one of the reasons for his resignation was a letter of April 2d from his uncle David Tate. The letter advised Moniac “to get home as quick as you can conveniently do it, as our presence is much wanted here.” Tate said Moniac’s father had lost almost all his property and had been forced to move on to the Creek reservation. “I took it upon myself, ” wrote Tate, “to advise your father not to waist (sic) his property but it had no effect-he kept continually drunk, and made bad trades and every advantage was taken.” Tate wanted Moniac back to secure some of his mothers’s property and ended by saying that only “hard times” were to be found.\n\nWe will never know if the hard times and danger of losing his property were the only reasons for Moniac’s resigning his commission. But he did remain in Alabama, acquiring property in the rough, inhospitable hills of southern Alabama’s Baldwin County. In this undesirable area he became a “country gentleman.” he built a home and attempted to farm while also indulging in his passion for breeding thoroughbred race horses. Sometime after graduation Moniac married Mary Powell, a cousin of Osceola, the leader of the Florida Seminoles.\n\nSeveral years later it was in a battle against these same Seminoles that Moniac lost his life.\n\nAgain, little is known about Moniac during the 14-year period from his resignation until he reentered the service in 1836. We only know he married, fathered a son and daughter and tried making a success of cotton planting. As one individual said, “He was a high-toned chivalric gentleman and cordially esteemed by all who knew him.”\n\nCreeks Displaced.\n\nThe Creeks in general had been gradually changing from a warlike tribe into one trying to earn a living from the land. Now that they were tied to the land they were beset by speculators seeking their land to sell to white settlers moving into Alabama. The settlers wanted the Creeks out of Alabama and arrangements were made for transporting them to new homes in Arkansas. In March 1832 the Creeks signed the Removal Treaty in which they gave up title to all land in Alabama and agreed to emigrate. But the treaty did not compel and Creek to move.\n\nThey could stay if they so desired. The Indians were given time by the treaty to choose land in the new territory, and they were also to receive a sum of money each year for 15 years. Before the Creeks had a chance to choose new land the white land speculators moved in and dispossessed them. This uprooting probably did not affect Moniac as much as it did many of his fellow creeks as the land he lived on was uninviting. With so much good land all around, the land agents and settlers had no inclination to seek his.\n\nUnfortunately this wasn’t the case with some Creeks and in 1836 about one-fifth of the Creek nation revolted against the land frauds being perpetuated against them. Chief Opothleyahola, a friendly Creek leader, raised a force of 1,800 braves and did most of the fighting for the Federal Commander, General Jessup.\n\nMoniac served as a guide for Jessup’s forces in eastern Alabama. The uprising was short-lived but new challenges arose for the Creek nation and David Moniac.\n\nOne result of the revolt was that now all Creeks were to be removed from Alabama to new homes in the West. The Creeks-to cover the cost of moving to their new homes-insisted upon an advancement of the Federal annuity which was due them the following year.\n\nThe Federal Government, now involved in fighting the Seminoles in Florida with no great success, agreed to the advance provided the Creeks would furnish a regiment of volunteers to fight the Seminoles. As a further inducement, the Creek soldiers were “to receive the pay and emoluments and equipment of soldiers in the Army of the U.S and such plunder as they may take from the Seminoles.”\n\nCreek Volunteers.\n\nMore than 700 Creeks volunteered to serve in the regiment, among them David Moniac. Moniac was commissioned a Captain in the Creek Regiment of Volunteers on August 17, 1836. he was the only Indian to be commissioned, all the other officers being junior officers from the regular Army or Navy. The Indian leaders were Jim Boy and Paddy Carr but the command of the regiment was given to Colonel John Lane, a hard-driving, confident young man who had already attracted President Andrew Jackson’s attention.\n\nLane led the regiment to Florida and into action. The first battle took place on September 30 a few miles from Tampa where they charged across a river and routed more than 200 Seminole warriors. The next encounter took place 15 days later and again the Creeks were successful in driving the Seminoles away and capturing 400 head of cattle.\n\nThough the Creeks were successful in their first two actions they quickly found how difficult it was to engage the enemy decisively. The Seminoles continually took refuge in the most inaccessible terrain amid twisted and gnarled trees and high grass and surrounded by swamps and rivers. They normally hid on the far side of a stream and waited for the soldiers to cross. While the soldiers were crossing, the Seminoles would disperse into small groups and fade into the\n\nswamp.\n\nThe Creek regiment finally joined the main Army of Governor Keith Call on October 19th. The march and battles must have been extremely hard on Colonel Lane for a few hours after joining Call he committed suicide by driving his sabre through his right eye. This cast a deep gloom over the regiment but Lieutenant Colonel Harvey Brown took command and led the regiment for the rest of the campaign.\n\nThe Seminoles looked upon the arrival of their old enemies the Creeks with “renewed hatred, and lost no opportunity to give vent to their malignity.” The Creeks, to distinguish themselves from the Seminoles, wore white turbans.\n\nKeith Call, governor of Florida and commander of the force, welcomed the Creeks for they comprised almost one-third of the force with which he hoped to end the Seminole war. On the 17th Call’s Tennessee troops made contact with the Seminoles in a forbidding place called Wahoo Swamp but darkness ended the engagement. The next day saw another assault with basically the same results-the Tennesseans pursued the Indians through waist-deep mud until the day ended. They then withdrew to await the arrival of the rest of Call’s forces so a combined attack could be made on the Wahoo Swamp.\n\nInto Battle.\n\nOn November 21 all Call’s forces were joined together, including the Creek Indians and their newly promoted Major, 34-year-old David Moniac. Call split his force into three elements, the Creek volunteers on the left, the Florida volunteers and regulars in the center and the Tennessee Volunteers on the right.\n\n“We marched through the open field,” recalled Jo Guild of the Tennessee Volunteers. “The hostile Indians were seen coming out of the edge of a large hammock, half naked, jumping and turning about, accompanied with yelling and the war-whoop.”\n\nThe Creeks struck the enemy flank and penetrated it while the rest of Call’s force charged the Seminole lines. The Seminoles “fell back a few yards, then rallied and poured a heavy fire into our ranks. It was with the greatest difficulty,” wrote Guild, “that we could get through the undergrowth, vines, and grass that cut like a knife.” The Seminoles kept up the battle, retreating from one position to another in the cypress swamp. The Seminoles “made their final stand behind a neck of water connecting two lakes, where…the friendly Indians, under Moniac, attacked them.”\n\nThe steam or neck of water held up the advance, the troops considering it “a deep and difficult morass,” the depth of which no one knew. Here Moniac showed his qualities of leadership. To keep the advance moving he charged into the stream with his Indians following. The Seminoles opened fire.\n\nGovernor Call wrote that ” A severe conflict ensued and while the brave Major Moniac, one of the Chiefs of the Creek Regiment, was advancing to lead the charge across the stream he was shot down and sank immediately in the stream…”\n\nAnother witness recalled: “Major Moniac, an educated Creek warrior, in attempting to force the creek, fell dead and the Seminoles were elated.”\n\nNot only had the Seminoles killed a leader of the hated Creeks but Moniac’s death had effectively put an end to the battle. None of the troops seemed inclined to try the unknown stream as Moniac had – so the Seminoles held their ground. The Army eventually retreating, taking along Moniac’s body. The loss of Moniac was deeply felt; Guild recalled that Moniac was “a man of great courage.”\n\nThey buried him not far from the battlefield but no memorial to him was ever raised. He died as he lived, in two worlds: as a Major in the service of the United States Army-and as an Indian warrior in the service of his people.\n\n*******************************"
