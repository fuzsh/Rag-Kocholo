        "text": "HISTORY\n\nSehoy I formed a union with Lachlan Marchand and from this union was born Red Shoe and Sehoy II. Red Shoe formed a union with Elizabeth Abbey/Abbot who had a son Red Shoe II. Red Shoe II had a son, Chief John Abbey, who married Salley Henderson Langley, who are the parents of our grandmother Camille Abbey/Abbot. The other family names in our tree are: Bushnell, Neville/Nevils, Lormand, Langley, Gordon, Marcantel, and Pete/Pitre. These family names are via marriage, although being of the same background.\n\nAn interesting historical quote from the “Koasati Culture Project,” states our distinguished appearance: In 1828 the Swiss-trained Botanist Jean Louis Berlandier encountered the Koasati in his travels through Texas/Louisiana and recorded the following observations about them...\n\n“The Conchates (Koasati/Coushatta) do not look like a Native people. To see them you would say they were a gathering of settlers.” Toward the beginning of the 19th century, 350 Conchatos moved out of the Opelousas territory where they had lived ever since leaving Florida many years before. They came to settle on the banks of the Sabine where they have built their houses… There is an Indian town in Florida called Bushnell, Florida.\n\nGrant you this may well be where our Bushnell family came from to the Spanish LA with Red Shoe. There is a 100-year gap in the Bushnell history by Tomlinson that cannot be explained. I was approached by Bushnells from Connecticut, they found the same thing as I, and was hoping we could link the 100 years together. Due to the dates we cannot, nor was Tomlinson able to in his book. One only has to look at us to know we are the Original Koasati. Case settled, thanks to Mr. Berlandier. This is also noted in Daniel Jacobson’s Dissertation “the Koasati Culture change.”"
