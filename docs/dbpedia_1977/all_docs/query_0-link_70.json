        "text": "McGillivray History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nScotland\n\nThe Picts of ancient Scotland were the tribe of the ancestors of the McGillivray family. The name McGillivray is derived from a personal name meaning servant of judgement. The Gaelic form of the name is Mac Gillebhrath.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the McGillivray family\n\nThe surname McGillivray was first found in Argyllshire (Gaelic erra Ghaidheal), the region of western Scotland corresponding roughly with the ancient Kingdom of DÃ¡l Riata, in the Strathclyde region of Scotland, now part of the Council Area of Argyll and Bute, but this family seat was later moved to Iona with the advent of St. Columba. From this original descendancy came Giolla Brighid, known also as Gillibride, or Gillivray. Gillivray's son, Somerled, the 8th and greatest Thane of Argyll, Lord of Kintyre, and founder of the 'Kingdom of the Isles' was instrumental in driving out the invading Norse (Vikings) from his Kingdom, commencing in 1140 AD. However, Somerled, still gave allegiance to the King of Vikings which continued until 1222, long after Somerled's death in 1164 AD. At this time, Alexander II of Scotland routed many of the Clans 'of the Isles', leaving them eastern Scotland in an area from Glasgow north to Inverness to the East Coast. The MacGillivrays were moved northwards to Lochabe. They became closely associated with their neighbors, the McInnises, the McMasters, and the MacEacherns. They also joined the great Pictish confederacy of Clans known as the Clan Chattan, an association of some twenty six Clans, during the time of Ferquhard, 5th Chief of the MacKintosh, and Chief of the Clan Chattan.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the McGillivray family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our McGillivray research.

They spelled according to sound, the result was a great number of spelling variations.
