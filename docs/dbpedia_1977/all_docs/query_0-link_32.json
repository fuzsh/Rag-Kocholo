        "meta_description": "This is a letter dated June 30, 1784 from Creek leader Alexander McGillivray to an unidentified Georgia official (possibly John Houstoun, Governor of Georgia, 1784) regarding reports of Georgians surveying land on the Oconee River that the Fat King and the Tallassie (also Tallassee) King had supposedly ceded.  McGillivray says that he called a general council, where the Tallassie (also Tallassee) King said in his own defense that he and the Fat King had been threatened with death by the Georgians in Augusta unless they signed away the land in question.  McGillivray also says that in 1782, General Anthony Wayne and Alexander Martin, Governor of North Carolina (1782-1785, 1789-1792), sent a \"liberal and generous\" talk to the Nation which he embraced as a gesture of peace but the wording was later ignominiously changed to depict the states as \"conquerors.\" McGillivray calls on the states to change their attitude towards the Creeks immediately and to respect their position as a free nation if they expect to avoid an Indian war.",

        "text": "Page: [1]\n\nLittle Tallassie\n\n30th. June 1784\n\nSir\n\nUpon a report prevailing among the Indians that the Georgians were Surveying the Land on the Oconee under the pretext that the Fat King of the Cussitahs & the Tallassie King had Ceded it to them & finding them on this Occasion on the point of rushing to war determined me to Call a general meeting of the whole nation before they Shoud [Should] -- Commence any Acts of Hostility & to endeavour [endeavor] to adjust matters in an amicable manner.\n\nThirty four of the principal Towns were assembled & the respective chiefs called upon the Tallassie King to give an account of his negotiations with the State of Georgia & for what reason he had in Concert with the Fat King granted them so large a tract of Country. the property of the Creek Nations in Common. he alledged [alleged] in his defence [defense] that when in Augusta such a demand had been made by the\n\nPage: [2]\n\npeople there & which he refused for several days. Till at length himself the Fat King with their followers were threatend [threatened] with Instant death if they did not comply. under Such circumstances wishing to preserve their own & companys lives they consented to [added text: the ] Cession demanded & which they knew the Nation woud [would] not Confirm.\n\nThe Chiefs after deliberating on the Matter Called upon me as head of the meeting to inform the Governor of Georgia with the result enclosed. --\n\nPermit me to observe that in the Summer of\n\n82 General Wayne & Governor Martin Sent a Talk to this nation which appeared so reasonable that I did not hesitate to embrace it, particularly as they expressd [expressed] terms of Conciliation & wishd [wished] to establish a peace on \"Generous & liberal principles\" & as a proof that we were willing to meet them on that ground. all Hostilities Ceased on our parts from that period.\n\nSoon after this the provisional articles toward a general peace were announced. The State alterd [altered] their tone from \"generous & liberal principles\" to that of Conquerors & Insisted on terms which the Spirit of a Free Nation coud [could]\n\nPage: [3]\n\nnot think of Submitting to. They felt the Ungenerous treatment of Brittain but are [added text: not ] so [illegible text] as to admit of such humiliating conditions as are attempted to be Imposed on them.\n\nI therefore recommend an Immediate change of measures to be adopted by the State respecting the Indians. I trust that the Gentlemen in power with you are equally desirous with us to preserve the peace & am likewise assured that the Frontier Inhabitants wish otherwise. Therefore it behoves [behooves] the Authority of Your Government to [unclear text: check ] itself to prevent the serious Consequences of an Indian War which will Certainly attend the Settling of the Oconee Lands.\n\nThere are two men of the name of Randal [added text (appears to be different hand and ink): [unclear text: Galphin ] ] who came up from Augusta in my absence -- when I was in Pensacola that Committed Some Irregularities as they report by order of the State. I recommend that Such things be put a Stop to for if more abuses of the like nature be Committed the Tra [document damaged: ders ] that come into this nation from your State will be made accountable for the Consequences. --\n\nPage: [4]\n\nI have only to add that it is matter [added text: of ] real Concern to me that there shoud [should] be any difference between us & the States & am Sorry to Say that it is their own fault. if they had behaved with more moderation the Southern Nations woud [would] not have been under the necessity of Seeking Foreign alliances.\n\nI am with the greatest Respect Sir your most Humble Servant\n\n[Signed] Alxr: [Alexander] McGillivray S. C. N [Speaker Creek Nation]\n\n30th. June 1784\n\nAlexr. [Alexander] McGillivray\n\nfrom the Creek Nation"
