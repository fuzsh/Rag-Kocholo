The first written record of their existence is in Dunmaglass in 1549, and at the great Clan Chattan gathering of 1609, the 'kin and race of Macgillivray' were represented by Malcolm of Dalcrombie.\n\nAs with other members of the Clan Chattan Confederation, the MacGillivrays supported the Jacobite Cause. In 1745, the Mackintosh Chief was serving as an officer in the Hanovarian army and Alexander MacGillivray was placed in charge of the regiment raised by Clan Chattan to fight at the Battle of Culloden, where he fell among many of his followers. After this terrible disaster, and the ensuing Highland Clearances, many MacGillivray clansmen emigrated to North America, Canada and Australia.\n\nWilliam McGillivray (1764-1825), was born at Dunlichty and became a fur trader in Canada where he was elected to the Legislative Chamber of Lower Canada.\n\nWilliam MacGillivray (1796-1852) became Professor of Natural History at Aberdeen University and became known as the Father of British Ornithology. He wrote A History of British Birds. Charles MacGillivray (1804-67) translated Pilgrim's Progress into Gaelic. James Pittendreigh MacGillivray (1856-1938) was born at Inverurie and in 1921 became King's Sculptor in Scotland.\n\nSurname distribution in Scotland: The MacGillivary name is most common in Highland (including the historic counties of Caithness, Inverness-shire, Sutherland, Nairnshire and Ross and Cromarty), Moray and Perth and Kinross (Perthshire and Kinross-shire) and Argyllshire.\n\nPlaces of Interest: Dunmaglass, Inverness-shire. Ancient lands of the MacGillivrays.\n\nAssociated family names (Septs): Gilray, Gilroy, Gilvray, MacGilroy, MacGilvra, MacGilvray, MacIlroy, MacIlvrae, Milroy, Roy.\n\nClan MacGillivary members display certificates."
