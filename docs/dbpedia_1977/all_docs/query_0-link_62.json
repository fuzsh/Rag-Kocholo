        "text": "We asked Mauriel how she got interested in the history and impact of Chief Alexander McGillivray.\n\nIt was a case of \"one thing led to another.\" I think I was researching the Scots in the South, and my Scottish ancestors who came to NC and SC before the Revolutionary War. I was also doing some research on our area for Hancock County.\n\nMcGillivray's father was quite an entrepreneur with beginning the trade on the Creek-Georgia frontier. I realized what an impact the European traders had on the Creek Nation, and how the French and Indian War led to the Creeks siding with the British in 1776. It became a Loyalist vs. Patriots with the Indians just as divided. Having sided with the British, the negotiations between Alex McGillivray and the US Government following the war was very much like two nations at odds.\n\nI guess one of the most profound things to say about Alexander McGillivray is that if he had not died so young (43 years old) there is a good chance the Creek Wars of the 1812 period would not have happened. He was so astute, no doubt he would have kept the Creeks united and in good favor with the US government. Who knows, the 1832 Indian Removal Act may not even have happened.”\n\nJoin us for this interesting history lesson and stories about the life of Chief Alexander McGillivray. Although Mauriel has not written a book about Alexander McGillivray, the museum team asked her to bring a few copies of her other books to sign and sell.\n\nAs always, the museum’s presentations are free, but donations are greatly appreciated. The lecture will take place in The Plaza auditorium.\n\nPlease stay to tour the museum and enjoy light refreshments after the lecture."
