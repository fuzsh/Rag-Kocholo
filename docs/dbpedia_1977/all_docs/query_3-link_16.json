        "text": "A surname, also known as a last name or family name, is a hereditary name passed down from one generation to another. It is used to identify and distinguish individuals within a family or lineage. Surnames often reflect a person's ancestry, occupation, or geographic origin.\n\nAncestry has partnered with Oxford University Press, whose academic researchers have studied the etymology of surnames based on historical usage, location, language, and more.\n\nThe most common last names in the world vary by region and culture. However, some of the most widespread surnames globally include Smith, Johnson, Wang, Li, and Garcia. It's important to note that the popularity of last names can change over time due to factors like migration and cultural shifts.\n\nLast names can be derived from occupations (e.g., Smith), locations (e.g., Hill), personal characteristics (e.g., Young), or paternal lineage (e.g., Johnson). In some cultures, surnames were assigned based on the father's name (e.g., O'Connor, meaning \"son of Connor\"). Over time, these naming practices evolved and were influenced by historical, cultural, and linguistic factors."
