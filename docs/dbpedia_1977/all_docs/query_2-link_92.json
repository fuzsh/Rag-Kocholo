        "text": "In June 1774, Manfred confesses to Claire Fraser that he may have gotten \"the French disease\" from a whore. Before she and Jamie can figure out what to do about him regarding his marriage to Lizzie, Manfred flees, and in the middle of the night Ute McGillivray storms into the Big House accusing Claire of slander, and declaring that the Frasers will no longer be allowed to trade with her family.\n\nIn August 1775, at a tavern Jamie, Claire, and Roger MacKenzie find Manfred in the company of a whore named Hepzibah while they are trying to find Stephen Bonnet who had kidnapped Brianna MacKenzie. Hepzibah tells them where Brianna was taken and Claire gives them both a shot of penicillin to cure their syphilis. Knowing that he will not live Manfred decides to marry Eppie (Hepzibah) and take her back home with him.\n\nHis return marked the end of Ute's shunning of the Frasers. So when Jamie called for the militia to rally, Manfred joined his father with the other men from Ardsmuir Prison.\n\nMyra was a whore from Hillsborough who Manfred had loved but knew he couldn't marry. When he went to tell her he could not see her anymore, as he was soon to wed Lizzie he found she had died from the pox. This caused him to then fear he had it as well."
