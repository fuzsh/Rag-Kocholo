        "text": "Sunday was a wonderful day for me. I joined Outlandish Vancouver (OV) for a “Party in the Suites” with none other than Dougal-in-Disguise, Graham McTavish! 🤗\n\nWhat is Outlandish Vancouver? In normal years, OV is an annual event held in Surrey, British Columbia 🇨🇦, independent from but concurrent with Surrey International Writer’s Conference (SiWC). Click the link to find Outlandish Vancouver website or, if you prefer, the OV Facebook page!\n\nWho is the mastermind behind OV? Well, it is KoKo, a.k.a. Pippi Pipkin (she is a wee lass)! She came up with this wonderful plan and now enjoys a volunteer staff including Sam and Karin (see next image).\n\nFans and OV admin folks gathered on Zoom a few minutes before the start of Graham’s session to share info about appropriate discussion topics, courtesy for virtual events, and filming/audio recording rules.\n\nWe were all smiles and delighted to be part of this wonderful event!\n\nThen, Graham appeared exactly on time, looking dashing, as always, in sweater, beard, smile and mellifluous voice. We individually introduced ourselves and then we were off on a delightful Q and A trip with Mr. McTavish. Lucky us!\n\nFirst, Graham was congratulated for Clanlands: Whisky, Warfare, and a Scottish Adventure Like No Other!, the new book authored by Graham and Sam Heughan. Graham is delighted with the book’s reception and its speedy advance to the top of multiple best seller lists! 📚\n\nWe learned an interesting fun fact about Graham’s name. One fan had the last name of Thompson. Turns out, Thompson is the anglicized version of McTavish. I didn’t know! 🤔\n\nAs a child in the 1960s, Graham lived in Vancouver, B. C. That prompted an invitation to attend the next in-person OV event. He said he would 💓 to come! Fingers crossed that this wish becomes reality once COVID is beaten back. 🤞🏻\n\nOne fan had a series of snappy questions for Graham (I think it was Keri). All her questions concerned Sam and Graham on the road for Clanlands book. Here they are:\n\nQ: Who has the messier luggage?\n\nA: Both of us are messy. But, as he thought about it, Sam’s luggage is the messiest!\n\nQ: Who is more of a chatter box?\n\nA: I am! Graham out-chatters Sam!\n\nQ: Who is the more competitive?\n\nA: Sam!!! He is competitive to a ridiculous level – very, Very VERY competitive! 😆\n\nQ: Who can do the most pushups?\n\nA: Graham couldn’t answer because he doesn’t how many Sam can do. He also did not tell us how many he can do.\n\nQ: Who is the most shy?\n\nA: Both of these fellows are shy, but Sam is more so. Graham pointed out that many actors are shy, by nature. Acting probably gives them license to express themselves while taking on another identity.\n\nQ: Who is more of a diva?\n\nA: Ha, ha. It’s Graham! He qualified that response, pointing out neither of these lads are divas and Sam puts up with more discomforts than he should. Graham perfers his creature comforts! 😃\n\nQ: Who forgets their lines more?\n\nA. Sam. 😲\n\nQ: Who was the most demanding of the Clanland crew?\n\nA: Graham! 😇\n\nQ: Who best wears the kilt?\n\nA. Graham, of course!!! 😜\n\nHow many Clanlands book plates have he and Sam signed? Graham thought for a moment and then replied – he thinks it is 8,000 – 9,000! 😳\n\nIn answer to the question, did you read Outlander book before accepting the role of clan war chief, Dougal MacKenzie? Graham replied, “No.” However, he noted, almost none of the cast had read the books before filming but did so in very quick order. Furthermore, Graham was offered the part and felt Dougal was a perfect fit for him.\n\nHave roles been easier to snag since Outlander? Graham answered, yes, it is easier now. He likes to work and keep busy. He prefers roles which involve horseback, swords, guns, cloaks, and candles. He has never played a lawyer.\n\nNow, wait just a minute! 🖐🏻 As I recall, William Buccleigh (Buck) MacKenzie is a lawyer!!! 😉\n\nWhat did you think of your wig as Buck? His daughter prefers him in the wig (she is young). I, for one, like his full beard and bald pate! 😄\n\nWhat is your favorite form of exercise? Long distance cycling, says Graham…as in many miles. He has cycled all over Scotland, Ireland, and England. Since it is an outdoors activity, he has been able to continue unabated during COVID. Although he didn’t mention it, I wager he has also cycled all over New Zealand! 🇳🇿\n\nWhat role would you like to play but haven’t as yet? Graham said he is not interested in rolls in procedural dramas such as a lawyer (too late – see above!) or a doctor. Most of all, he would love to play a cowboy in a bona fide, hay-burner western! 🤠\n\nIn Preacher, he did play a sort-of cowboy, starring as The Saint of Killers – complete with guns, horse, saber, and Stetson hat! He was thrilled that the saber he carried was of Civil War vintage and even bore the marks of battle!\n\nGraham pointed out that a Scotsman playing a cowboy isn’t farfetched. At least two Native American tribes were lead by Highlanders: Alexander McGillivray led the Creeks, and Duncan McDonald’s family were leaders of the Nez Perce tribe.\n\nQ: Are audible and printed versions of Clandlands identical?\n\nA: No, indeed, they are not! The audio version was created over a three day span in a London studio, where as the written version was a collaboration that lasted a number of weeks. Ergo, they are very similar but not identical.\n\nAfter visiting various Scottish museums with Sam, Graham became enchanted with the weaponry. He was able to handle them and assured us that Highlander weapons were perfectly balanced, well-designed killing machines! The dirk could pierce a Kevlar vest! And, the basket hilt of the broadsword not only protected the dominant hand, it was used like a metal fist to smash bones. (Pssst….. maybe it’s a guy thing) 😉\n\nGraham was so impressed with the weapons, he commissioned a New Zealand swordsmith to make him a Scottish broadsword. He thinks it might come in handy when suitors of his eldest daughter come around – she just attended her first ball. 😆\n\nBTW: The below image (Outlander, episode 209, Je Suis Prest) was written by Matt B. Roberts. The script called for Dougal, Angus, and Rupert to run butt naked in a Highland charge! This is based in history, as fighting naked has been attributed to Celtic warriors as early as 225 B. C. E. And, Highlanders carried on the tradition, dropping the kilt and fighting in sark or birthday suits. In the end (haha), Outlander opted for kilts, only! 😅\n\nI can personally vouch for Highlander weapons. Yours truly posing with spiked targe, broadsword, and dirk in 2016, Scotland! Targe and dirk were held in the non-dominant hand and broadsword in the dominant. Note the steel spike extending from the targe? That thing was almost a foot long. As the warrior struck with the broadsword, he also stabbed with dirk and slashed with targe spike! Are you scared? 😜\n\nAre you and Sam really friends? Yes! They enjoy a terrific friendship. Age difference is not a factor. 🤗\n\nAnd, the last question was excellent: When you think of Outlander, what is the first thing you think of? Without hesitation, Graham answered, “laughter!” Especially with season one combo of characters!\n\nThus ended our happy hour with Graham McTavish. Thank you, Graham, for providing us with the splendid characters of Dougal and Buck! Until next time. 🤞🏻\n\nPS: Remember, if you wish to find out more about OV, you can find them on FB or their website.\n\nPSS: Some OV images were taken by my iPhone from my iPad .
