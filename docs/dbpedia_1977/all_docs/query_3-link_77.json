Research and data collection is a slow and tedious process since many primary sources are not indexed and one has to just read the old colonial script to find pertinent information. However, in some regards, this can be the most rewarding part of the manuscript development.\n\nThe book deals with and expands on the McGillivray family members, including the McIntoshes, who were involved in the Indian trade, and not previously dealt with. The scene is primarily the old southwest, especially present-day Alabama, Mississippi and West Florida.\n\nMany questions have been left hanging and unresolved over the years by previous writers, and many are addressed in this work, but not all are resolved. Was Alexander McGillivray, the Creek Chief, poisoned by the Spanish as rumored in the Creek Nation after his death? What about the identification and fate of the Indian families left behind by the McGillivray traders?\n\nVirtually nothing was known of Jeanette McGillivray, the Creek Indian daughter of Lachlan Lia McGillivray. Now we know that she remained in Alabama after her husband LeClerc Milford deserted her. After his return to France, she soon married Ben Crook, a trader residing at Little Tallasee, the old McGillivray homeplace. The fate of Alexander, Jr., the only son of the Creek chief, who was sent to Scotland in about 1798 to be educated, has been uncovered in the parish records. The Dr. Wells that treated him for tuberculosis in London has been identified and his biography developed. Lachlan Lia’s will of 1767 has been found in the Fraser-Mackintosh Collection of the Inverness Public Library, along with an extract of his last will made in 1795 after his return to Scotland. The children of John McGillivray among the Chickasaw, and the children of James McGillivray among the Choctaw have been identified and reported on. An exhaustive search has been made for the elusive Colonel John Tate, supposedly the husband of Sehoy McGillivray. New information on John McGillivray’s plantation in Jamaica has been included.\n\nIn developing the manuscript, I frequently quote from my sources trying to avoid paraphrasing the original text. Paraphrasing may lead to erroneous interpretation and mislead the reader. I have let the record speak for itself and consequently the text may not be as smooth as desired. I have also included dates and some references in the text in order to avoid the maddening process of continually flipping pages trying to find a date or reference in the endnotes at the back of the book. Also, the manuscript is generally in chronological order.\n\nThe reader will note that family names and their relation to other family members are often repeated throughout the text. Due to the same given names among family members, this was necessary in order for the reader to be sure which person is being referred to in the text.\n\nThere is also considerable genealogical data that may interest readers, especially the lesser known McGillivrays, along with the identification of their Indian descendants.\n\nA.J.W\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nDuring the many years of collecting material for this book, I have become indebted to the many friendly people who have generously assisted me at various libraries, archives, and depositories. Their patience and professional help is greatly appreciated.\n\nSpecial thanks must go to Dr. Vernon J. Knight of the University of Alabama for his helpful review and comments on the manuscript. My son, A. J. Wright III of the University of Alabama in Birmingham has also been supportive and helpful with his comments.\n\nAlso, I wish to thank Dr. William S. Coker of the University of West Florida, now retired, for his most generous offer in allowing me to spend two days browsing through his early collection of the Panton, Leslie & Co. papers. Dr. W. W. Wallace of Mobile has been supportive in furnishing me information on Sophia McGillivray and her descendants.\n\nSpecial recognition must go to the professional researchers and genealogists that I engaged to search the almost limitless depositories in Scotland and England. Their many hours of poring over the records of Colonial America have brought forth new information of substantial benefit to this work. Graeme M. Mackenzie of Edinburgh searched the archives of the Inverness Public Library, National Library of Scotland, Scottish Public Record Office, and the Public Record Office at Kew. Mackenzie also visited the Mains of Dunmaglass and the McGillivray Cemetery at Dunlichity. Peter B. Ferguson of East Sussex searched the Society of Genealogists Library, Greater London Record Office, Surrey Record Office at Kingston, and the Public Record Office at Kew attempting to locate some information on Alexander McGillivray Jr. who died in 1802. Thanks to John F. H. Dagger of Kent for his research of the War Office records at the Public Record Office at Kew. His search of muster rolls of the 14th, 16th, 22nd, 34th, 35th and 60th regiments stationed in West Florida at various times, trying to locate the elusive Colonel John Tate. Dagger was also instrumental in locating the burial of Alexander McGillivray Jr. in the parish registers.\n\nI want to thank my dear wife, Carolyn Shores Wright, and my youngest son, Richard A. Wright of Mobile, for their continuous encouragement and support. Without their frequent questions of How is your book coming? or When are you going to finish your book? this book may never have been completed.\n\nI also want to thank Nan Hall of Huntsville for her enduring patience and advice in converting my handwriting to computer files.\n\nLast I want to thank the following people, and the staff of the following libraries and archives, without whose help I could never have completed this book:\n\nEdwin Bridges and his staff at the Alabama Department of Archives and History, Montgomery; Yvonne Crumpler and her staff at the Linn-Henley Research Library, Birmingham; Shirley L.

As these colonies vied for dominance among each other, the native inhabitants of that frontier, the Creeks, struggled to maintain their independence, while at the same time Creek men increasingly engaged in international commerce. Deer skins, destined for overseas leather goods markets, were procured in massive quantities by the Creeks and exchanged for guns, gunpowder, ammunition, iron hoes and axes, cloth, blankets, kettles, paint, glass beads, scissors, and other necessities and luxuries of European origin. By degrees, as the European and eventually American powers shifted positions around the frontier, Creek ways of life inevitably changed. The eighteenth century had begun with the English colonists prodding the Creeks to take up arms against neighboring tribes, both to procure slaves to work English plantations and to block the efforts of their colonial rivals. The century ended, in contrast, with concerted efforts by American agents to civilize the Creeks, which meant introducing modern plows, cattle and oxen, spinning wheels and looms.\n\nThe study of this important phase in the history of the old South by scholars who have sought to understand its events has proven to be a daunting task. The historian is challenged by only barely commensurate sources in French, Spanish, British, and American archives, revealing a multiplicity of perspectives and interests, and this challenge is made more difficult still by the fact that the focus of interest, the frontier, was itself at the feather edge of the literate world. Add to this the clash of New World and Old World cultures, where the anthropologist’s sensitivities prove to be of value, and the subject reveals itself to us as one that is reluctant to yield up its secrets, despite the efforts of generations of scholars. This subject is, besides, a moving target, with radically shifting contexts of politics, economics, leadership, war, and peace.\n\nWe have some fascinating vignettes. James Adair, an English trader caught up in the middle of these events, wrote a detailed history which shows an unusual interest in, and sensitivity to, the natives’ way of life. We are indeed fortunate that anyone with literary interests was there to place these matters on record, in spite of the book’s bizarre thesis that the key to Indian origins in America lay in the historical wanderings of the Lost Tribes of Israel. Then there was William Bartram, botanist, writer, and adventurer, the Homer of the eighteenth-century frontier. Bartram left an account of the Creek country which is a wonderfully fresh and almost poetic blend of romantic literature and scientific observation. Somewhat lesser known is the little book by Louis LeClerc de Milford, an amazing autobiography of a young French soldier who came to America, wandered alone into the frontier fearing cannibals. He was befriended by Alexander McGillivray and the Creeks, and rose to the rank of war chief among them. Later he returned to France where he attempted to convince Napoleon of the importance of the Creeks and their Nation. Milford’s epic story is remarkably parallel to that of the modern film Dances with Wolves, except, of course, that it is true.\n\nBut none of these writers were truly pivotal players in the drama that was unfolding around them. The present volume, in contrast, centers on two persons who very much were at the center of events on the eighteenth-century Creek frontier. They are Laughlin McGillivray and his Indian son Alexander McGillivray. To understand the lives and careers of these two men is to focus attention on both sides of the Native American–European equation in its formative years.\n\nAs the following pages show, Laughlin Lia McGillivray was a Scottish-born Indian trader in a family of traders based in colonial South Carolina. With his success in exploiting and expanding the deer skin trade, he was perhaps the prototypical merchant in the deer skin business that so altered native Creek society during the middle years of the eighteenth century. He lived a double life. In the wilderness of the Creek country, he was so well-positioned in the trade that he took as a wife Sehoy, native matriarch of the dominant Wind clan, by whom his son Alexander was born. But in urban South Carolina he was seemingly another person, a successful businessman, who gradually assumed the role of landed gentry, and who consequently abandoned and essentially forgot his progeny in the Indian country. A Loyalist during the American Revolution, he lost much of his property to the Rebel Americans and retired to a family estate in Scotland.\n\nLaughlin’s son Alexander became the most important leader the Creeks ever knew. He was educated in Charleston but soon returned to his mother’s people, where, after a time, he proved himself a formidable diplomat. As the occasion demanded, he might be seen in British, Spanish, American, or Native dress in order to negotiate agreements favorable to the Creeks. Respected as Isti Atcagagi Thlocco (Great Beloved Man), he used his authority to protect the interests of his people, particularly against land encroachment and the threat of foreign invasion. He was, in a sense, born to play this role.\n\nHistorians and anthropologists have emphasized that Alexander McGillivray’s influence among the Creeks was primarily the product of his unique skills as a culture broker, equally at ease in the Native and Western worlds. His vision was certainly broader than other, contemporary Creek leaders, and more outward-looking. And it appears to be true that he did not even have a good command of the native languages, and that he frequently made use of an interpreter. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that Alexander identified himself as a Creek Indian, and as the leader and spokesman for the Creek Nation in a time of turmoil and confusion. But there is much more to the picture than that. Prior to McGillivray’s time the Creek Confederacy as a political entity was in its infancy, a recent, ephemeral reaction of allied towns to outside aggression. McGillivray did his best to transform this into a real, permanent government. He was personally responsible for making the National Council and its officers a standing institution. In the writer’s opinion, the rise to power of Alexander McGillivray, a literate trader’s son, among this highly conservative native people is the singular, pivotal fact most in need of understanding in the context of the Creek frontier in the last quarter of the eighteenth century.\n\nIn this volume Amos J. Wright Jr. compiles and presents the source materials relating to the lives and careers of Laughlin McGillivray and Alexander McGillivray, plus those documentary materials concerning all of their close relatives and their close associates. The volume represents twenty years of meticulous detective work in the collection of reference material, during which the author has ferreted out details previously unknown, has clarified some of the problems raised by previous research, and has righted several current misconceptions. There is much here that is of genealogical interest, bearing on such matters as the relationship between the McGillivray and McIntosh clans in Scotland, and the fate of Alexander McGillivray’s son who was sent to Scotland after the death of his father. It is very revealing that the boy’s grandfather, Laughlin, who was still living, neither welcomed nor supported his native-born grandson and would-be heir. Among the many conclusions and carefully weighed opinions offered in these pages, the author has included a consideration of Alexander’s cause of death, as he was rumored to have been poisoned by a Spaniard. Mr. Wright has consulted medical specialists on the matter of McGillivray’s reported symptoms, and he discusses several possible scenarios that may be compatible with the extant evidence.\n\nPublication of these source materials is sure to further our scholarly understanding of these fascinating individuals who were born into fascinating times.\n\nVernon James Knight\n\nDepartment of Anthropology\n\nUniversity of Alabama\n\nAbbreviations\n\nASA - Alabama Department of Archives and History\n\nASP - American State Papers\n\nBFS - British, French and Spanish Records, Alabama Secretary of State\n\nCCC - Charleston County Courthouse\n\nCCJ - Clan Chattan Journal\n\nETHS - East Tennessee Historical Society\n\nFMC - Fraser-Mackintosh Collection\n\nGHQ - Georgia Historical Quarterly\n\nGSA - Georgia Department of Archives and History\n\nHR - House of Representatives\n\nHRRS - Highland Roots Research Services\n\nIPL - Inverness Public Library\n\nJA - Jamaica Archives\n\nJCTP - Journals of the Commissioners for Trade and Plantations\n\nMH - Missionary Herald\n\nMMA - Mobile Municipal Archives\n\nMPC - Mobile Probate Court\n\nNA - National Archives\n\nNLS - National Library of Scotland\n\nPAC - Public Archives of Canada\n\nPRO - Public Record Office\n\nSCA - South Carolina Department of Archives and History\n\nSCHGM - South Carolina Historical and Genealogical Magazine\n\nSCHM - South Carolina Historical Magazine\n\nSCHS - South Carolina Historical Society\n\nSRO - Scottish Public Record Office\n\nWLCL - William L. Clements Library\n\n1\n\nMcGillivrays of Scotland and Early South Carolina\n\nThe Scots are a complicated race being composed of Picts, Gaels, Britons, Angles, Normans, Flemings, and Franks. The original Scots were Gaels being a mixture of Celt and Teuton.\n\nThe concept of clanship goes back to the Celtic world particularly from ancient Ireland, where each community was a little kingdom within itself. However, the word Chief comes from the Norman-French and was introduced into Scotland by the Normans.\n\nThe word clan means children and originally each clan was made up only of the descendants. There was little emigration and the chief, being the head of the family and all his clansmen, was obligated to provide a parcel of land to each member of the clan. Generation after generation led to smaller and smaller parcels going to the most distant relative. The chief’s influence extended to all branches of his family, including those settled outside of the clan territory. He cared for the sick; both the invalid and widowed received small pensions.\n\nThe tradition of tartans and bagpipes has played, and continues to play, a very important role in the Scottish culture. The tartan and bagpipe appear as early as the 16th century. Dancing and music play an important part in their tradition.\n\nAfter the 1715 uprising, the government felt the power of the Highlanders. Accordingly, forts and blockhouses, properly garrisoned, were built throughout the Highlands. Officially the Highlanders were disarmed, but they concealed their weapons to fight another day.\n\nThe Highlanders were crushed at the battle of Culloden and the courts abolished the legal power of the chiefs in 1747. The Scots were banned from wearing the kilt and using the bagpipe. After the suppression of the clans, a population explosion took place bringing on unprecedented hardship. Scotland was originally a forested land, but during this period it was almost denuded. Emigration solved only part of the population problem and the chiefs struggled just to feed their families. At first chiefs discouraged emigration, but eventually many chiefs joined this movement and sometimes the whole family emigrated. Times were so hard that young men were forbidden to marry until they had a house and could support a family.\n\nIn relief of these hardships, many Highlanders were recruited into the army where they served throughout the world. Between 1757 and 1762 nine new Highland regiments were raised.\n\nInter-clan feelings remained alienated and bitter at the end of the 18th century, but Sir Walter Scott changed all that. His writings of the Highlands were poetic and romantic, taking the meanness out of the old feuds. The warring clans turned to fun and games which continue today.\n\nThe McGillivrays were a prominent clan family from the Valley of Nairn just southwest of Inverness, the highland capital of Scotland. They were part of Clan Chattan, a confederation of clans in the valley of Loch Ness or Nairn. The original clan members were descendants of a 13th century chief called Gillechattan Mor, and as other clans settled nearby, they too would join the confederation. Clan Chattan eventually consisted of the McIntosh, Farquhaurson, Shaw, McThomas, McPherson, Cattanachs, McGillivray, McLean, McBain, McQueen, Davidson, McPhail, McAndrew, Gow, Clark, McIntyre, Crerar, Gillespie, Gillies, Noble, Ritchie, McHardy, and Mckilligin. The confederation was led by a high chief called the Captain of Clan Chattan, usually a McIntosh.[1]\n\nIn 1609 the clan chiefs met and signed a Bond of Union putting an end to warfare among themselves and making a stronger clan for resistance to any outside foe.\n\nThey met in order to put an end to their quarrels—to sign an agreement whereby they bound themselves to live in friendship, to stand by each other and to maintain and follow the Mackintosh as their captain and chief.[2]\n\nThe McGillivrays united very early with the McIntosh. According to the Farr manuscript, Gilvray the first of this family and of whom the clan McGillivray took protection and shelter from Fargurar the 5th Laird of MacIntosh, in about the year 1263 during the Reign of King Alexander the third. The lands of Dunmaglass were obtained from Calder in 1547 and became the homeplace of the McGillivrays. They were the oldest followers of the McIntoshes and Clan Chattan.[3]\n\nA slightly different account comes from the Gaelic Society[4] where Clan Chattan was originally made up of nine families of Mackintosh. The MacGillivrays were the first and oldest to be incorporated into the clan with a name other than McIntosh. The McGillivrays came from the southwest and settled in the Valley of Nairn long before they appeared in written history. Half of Dummaglass originally belonged to Thanes of Kalder and is first mentioned in 1414. The other half belonged to the Menzies family of Aberdeenshire.\n\nDonald Calder bargained for and won possession for the Menzies half in 1421. The McGillivrays seem to be in possession of Dunmaglass as early as 1547 with the first chief being Farquhar. By 1609, when the bond of union was signed by the members of Clan Chattan, the McGillivrays were already numerous and influential. Dunmaglass had passed from the family of Calder to the McGillivrays for five thousand merks which was equivalent to about 275 pounds. Dunmaglass was the first of many estates belonging to the McGillivrays with some seventeen thousand acres distributed among several estates.[5] The old homeplace was built at Dunmaglass in about 1690 and was located on the eastern side of the River Farigaig some one hundred yards northwest of the Mains of Dunmaglass. The property was sold in 1895 or 1896 to an English gentleman who promptly leveled the old house. Today only a few stones can be found on the site. A pen and ink drawing of the house made in about 1850 turned up with the descendants in Canada, but the best description comes from the Ordnance Survey in 1870—A very large farmhouse two stories high with outbuildings attached. The former entirely thatched and the latter quite new and slated, the whole in good repair.[6]\n\nA large body of McGillivrays from early times lived on the south end of the Isle of Mull near present day Pennyghael which is located at the western entrance to Loch Ness. These McGillivrays never joined Clan Chattan nor followed any of their chiefs, but they may have been the original migrants to the Valley of Nairn.[7]\n\nThe McGillivray genealogy we are interested in starts with Farquhar, Feadhaiche, McGillivray who was the 6th chief. He married Emelia Stewart in 1681 and died in 1714. This union resulted in six children—Farquhar the eldest who became the 7th chief when his father died in 1714; Anna who married Fraser of Farraline; Magdelene who married McIntosh of Holm; David who married Margaret McGillivray; Janet who married Donald McGillivray; and Captain William Ban who married Janet McIntosh. The descendants of Farquhar and Captain Ban are the primary concern of this work.[8]\n\nThe Stuart rebellion of 1715 found many of the McGillivrays taking part and Captain Ban was a captain in the Clan Chattan regiment. He may have lived at Tomnashangan or Fairy’s Hill.[9] A story of his encounter with the fairies has descended into modern times. Captain Ban was also extensively involved in the cattle business in the valley of River Nairn.[10] Fairy’s Hill was located at the House of Daviot which is only about five miles southeast of Inverness. Dun Daviot today is just a woodland hill slowly being eaten away by a quarry.[11]\n\nMcGill family chart 12 AMcGill family chart 12 B\n\nCaptain Farquhar McGillivray, the 7th chief and elder brother to Captain Ban, was also a captain in the Clan Chattan regiment during the rebellion. After the Highlanders surrendered at Preston in November 1715, he and some fellow officers were taken to London for trial. He was brought to trial for high treason on 11 June 1716, but due to an error in his indictment he was released. In 1717 he married Elizabeth McIntosh and they had four sons and four daughters. The daughters were Janet, Ann, Catherine, and Elizabeth—all died unmarried. His eldest son Alexander, his heir and the 8th chief, died in 1746 leading the charge of the Clan Chattan regiment at the Battle of Culloden. He possessed several estates including Dunmaglass, but lived at Gask, a house used by his father and grandfather, and located in a more fertile area of the valley.[12] William, the second son, succeeded his brother Alexander as the 9th chief in 1746. He eventually came to America. John, the third son, also came to America where he was a successful merchant and Indian trader. He became a lieutenant colonel in the West Florida militia during the American Revolution. Donald, the youngest son, became a merchant seaman and died unmarried in 1777. [13]\n\nCaptain William Ban was the second son of Farquhar and therefore not the first in line to inherit the Clan Chieftainship. He was called Captain Ban due to his fair complexion. He married his cousin Janet McIntosh, the daughter of Angus McIntosh of Kyllachy, on 9 February 1714, probably just before his father died in the same year. They had four surviving children—Lachlan Lia, the eldest; William; Jean or Jean Roy; and Lucy. Lucy died in 1734, the same year as Captain Ban.[14]\n\nCaptain Ban was heavily involved with the Dalcromby family of Aberehalder in the cattle business. His inventory and testament at death was mostly a list of debts. He owed a large sum of outstanding rent to Dunmaglass and other sums to the Dalcrombies, plus smaller amounts to others. The original testament was written in 1734, at the time of his death, followed in 1755 by an additional claim on his estate by the Dalcrombies. Farquhar of Dalcromby had taken legal action against Lachlan Lia, as Captain Ban’s oldest son, to recover the money owed to his family. The outcome is unknown. Lachlan by this time was a wealthy man and had the means of paying off his father’s debts but for some reason seems to have defaulted.[15]\n\nUnder Scottish tradition Captain Ban would have named his oldest son Farquhar after his father and the next son Angus, after his wife’s father. Lucy was named after his wife’s mother and would probably be the eldest daughter; and the second daughter should be named Emilia after his mother; and there should be a Janet named after his wife before other names such as Jean. Most likely there were children with those names that did not survive which was not unusual for that time. The name Lachlan is a family name from his mother’s side—the McIntoshes of Kyllachy. Apparently Captain Ban’s sons left no legitimate issue or they would have been in line to inherit Dunmaglass and the Chieftainship when John Lachlan, the 10th chief, died in 1852.[16]\n\nMcGill family chart 13 A\n\nAfter Alexander, the 8th chief, was killed in 1746 at the Battle of Culloden, the McGillivray estates were confiscated and the family was in desperate straits for the next decade. By 1750 however, it was safe for the family to take their case to court and try to reclaim their property. Their petition was successful and the estates were restored to the McGillivrays.[17]\n\nThe clan spirit and binding of the family were very important, and clan literally means children. The children of each generation of the clan settled nearby and the clan grew from only the descendants. The clan chief was expected to furnish a parcel of land for each new member of the clan and look after the well being of all the members.[18] However, by the mid-18th century the clan as a recognizable legal entity had disappeared. The judiciary no longer recognized the clan system under the law, but the spiritual link of clanship continued and is thriving among Scots the world over today.[19]\n\nAfter the rebellion of 1715, the Crown decided to send some of the Highland rebels being held prisoner to America to help settle the colonies.[20] Braden[21] wrote that many Highlanders also voluntarily emigrated to America in 1716 with another wave following in 1735-37. However, Macgillivray[22] wrote that the Scots coming over in 1716 were all prisoners and that the voluntary migration took place in 1722. Also, considerable numbers came after the failed rebellion of 1745-46.\n\nRebel prisoners sent to South Carolina in 1716 included several McGillivrays. The ship Savannah sailed on 7 May, 1716 with 104 prisoners including a Fargus and Donald McGillivray. The ship Wakefield sailed on 21 April 1716 with eighty-one prisoners which included Laughlin, James, Owen, John, William, Alexander, Laughlin, John, John and James.[23] Another ship’s list coming to South Carolina in 1716 includes Fargus, Fargus, James, James, James, John, John, Loughlin, Loughlin, Loughlin, Owen, Owen, William, William and Alexander.[24] Many McGillivrays were in South Carolina by 1716 and with their many offspring and common given names, it is difficult to accurately trace individuals, and later writers have been confused by this problem.\n\nOne of the earliest arrivals in America was a John McGillivray who was also a trader out of South Carolina as early as 1716. He traded with the Creeks and should not be confused with the later John McGillivray who was a brother to William, the 9th chief, and a cousin to Lachlan Lia.[25] The early trader, John McGillivray, later appears in the records from a deed dated 20 October 1731, which read—John Bayly, gentleman of Goose Creek[26] to William Penant and John McGillivray Indian traders of South Carolina, for 407 pounds South Carolina money, 407 acres on west side of Pon Pon River, St. Bartholomews Parish, Colleton County.[27]\n\nOn Easter Monday 1734, John McGillivray was chosen one of the vestry men by the parishioners of St. Helen Parish, South Carolina. He was chosen again in 1735.[28] In May 1734 he was granted a tract of land by the South Carolina Council.[29] In April 1736 he advertised for sale five hundred acres and a good house in Port Royal where he was living at the time.[30]\n\nHe seemed to have gotten his start as a messenger for the South Carolina Council in 1722.[31] He married Elizabeth Hazzard in April 1736 but he apparently died soon after and his will was probated 12 June 1736 identifying him as a planter in St. Helen Parish, Granville County.[32] He married in April, died in May or June, and his widow married Ephiaim Mekell in June.[33]\n\nAnother early McGillivray trader was William who first appears in the records as a packhorseman for Robert Graham in 1717. Graham was a leading trader to the Creeks out of Charleston and was assistant factor in 1718. William was first hired by Graham on 27 December 1717 to accompany John Milborne and two slaves with twenty-three packhorses to the Creek country. Actually only twenty-two packhorses made the trip as one died at pasture before they left. Graham also made the trip and led the party west to the newly established trading post at Tallassee probably on the east bank of the Coosa River in Talladega County, Alabama. The trade goods were valued at 986 pounds.[34]\n\nPackhorsemen were paid from ten to twelve pounds per month and an allowance for expenses while in Charleston.[35] This was good pay for the times, but at fairly high risk. A thrifty person could save enough in a few years to form a partnership and start his own trading business.\n\nThe will of William was recorded on"
