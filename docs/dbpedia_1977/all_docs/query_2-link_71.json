        "text": "The Cedar school photo is the second and third grade class of about 1920 - 1923. No date on photo but the following names appear on the reverse in the following order: Walter Heck, Lawrence Rapson, Ina Pethers, Ethel Abbe, Mary Hess, Marguerite Look [the L could be an S or F], Marion Haley and Lydia Baker.\n\nSubmitted by\n\nScott Mills\n\nEdwin Alexander McGillivray family. Edwin, William J. and Alexander McGillivray were supposedly somehow involved in the founding of Elkton. They also worked together on and off as the towns blacksmith. William J. stuck with that and had a blacksmith shop in town for many years. Edwin eventually gave that up and began farming full time somewhere along the way. Names in order from left to right are: Edwin Alexander, Russell James, Bessie Faith, Mary Elizabeth, Fern Ileta and Sarah Elizabeth (Mitchell) McGillivray. In the doorway are Katherine Jane (McGillivray) Durkee and her son Stewart. Based on the apparent age of Stewart (under one) I estimate the date of the photo at about 1913 or 1914. Russell married Mary A. Shultz, Bessie married Raymond Jones, Mary married Philip Wangler, Fern married Peter McIntyre and Katherine married Samuel Durkee."
