        "text": "WOODWARD'S REMINISCENCES OF THE CREEK OR MUSCOGEE INDIANS\n\nContained in Letters to Friends in Georgia and Alabama\n\n[Source: Woodward's Reminiscences of the Creek or Muskogee Indians, by Thomas S. Woodward of Louisiana; Montgomery, Alabama (1859)\n\ntranscribed by Susan Geist]\n\nWheeling, Winn Parish, La.,\n\nJune 16th, 1858\n\nCol. John Banks:\n\nDear Sir: Your letter of the 27th ult. is as welcome as it was unexpected. Anything from those I knew in early life is consoling to my feelings in my present lonely situation, particularly when it contains such kindly expreased feelings for my welfare here and my happiness hereafter. In your P. S. you say I may have forgotten you. Your name is a familiar one to me, and it is possible I may not know which one of that name I am writing to, but it would be treating unkindly one of the best memories that man ever had to doubt it. If you are the John Banks I think I am writing to, you were born in Georgia, and in the same county I was, Elbert.\n\nIn 1818 there were two companies of soldiers from Elbert county, Ga., one commanded by Capt. Mann; the other by Capt. Ashley. You were a Lieutenant in one of them. I remember the trip to Fort Early that you speak of, as I do most of what occurred in that Florida expedition. That was a little over forty years ago. The names you mention in your letter are as familiar to me as my own. The two women whose names you mention, if the incidents connected with their lives were as well known to some as they are to myself, would afford material for a very interesting book. Mrs. Stuart (now Mrs. Dill) you saw when Capt. Brown and myself carried her to your camp; you know something of her history-at least you know something of her being a captive among the hostile Indians. And as I have nothing to do to-day, and you live in Columbus among many of my old acquaintances as well as relatives, and perhaps some of them would be willing to hear that I am living at least, I will give you a little of their (Mrs. Dill's and Mrs. Brown's) history.\n\nIn 1816 and 1817, the Florida Indians were doing mischief, and the Government found it necessary to keep troops quartered on the borders of Florida. Fort Scott and Fort Huse were erected to protect the settlers in Early county, Georgia. That was then a new and thinly settled country. The command of the troops was given to Colonel Arbuckle. He had frequent skirmishes with the Indians, under the control of Chitto-Fanna-Chula, or old Snake Bone, but known to you and the whites generally as old Ne-he-mathla. The present gallant General Twiggs was then a Brevet Major in the 7th Regiment of Infantry, and was generally the foremost in those skirmishes. Supplies for the troops had to be carried from New Orleans and Mobile by water. A very large boat with army stores was started from Mobile Point under the command of Lieut. Scott. Mrs. Stuart was among those on board; her husband, a Sergeant, and a fine looking man at that, had gone with the troops by land. The boat, having to be propelled by oars and poles, was long on the trip, and by this time the war had completely opened. The old hostile Creeks, from various portions of Florida, were engaged in it; among others the two Chief you saw hanged at St. Mark's-Josiah Francis and Ne-he-mathla Micco. They headed a party and watched the boats. As those on board were hooking and jamming (as the boatmen called it) near the bank, and opposite a thick canebrake, the Indians fired on them, killing and wounding most of those on board at the first fire. Those not disabled from the first fire of the Indians made the best fight they could, but all on board were killed except Mrs. Stuart and two soldiers-Gray, and another man whose name I have forgot, if I ever knew it; they were both shot, but made their escape by swimming to the opposite shore. I must here mention a circumstance that occurred on board the boat at the time, which I learned from one of the men who escaped, and also from some of the Indians who were present. There was a Sergeant named McIntosh, a Scotchman, on board, whom I knew well. He was with Colonel, afterwards General Thomas A. Smith, before St. Augustine, Fla., in 1812, and a Sergeant in Capt. Woodruff's company, at the beginning of the war of 1812, and was a favorite among officers and soldiers. He was an own cousin of the Indian General McIntosh you knew, whose grave you say you not long since visited. Sergeant McIntosh was a man of giant size, and perhaps more bodily strength than any man I have known in our service. When he found all on the boat were lost, and nothing more could be done, he went into a little kind of cabin that the Lieutenant had occupied as his quarters, in which was a swivel or small cannon; loaded it, took it on deck, and resting the swivel on one arm ranged it as well as he could, and (the Indians by this time were boarding the boat) with a firebrand, he set off the swivel, which cleared the boat for a few minutes of Indians. At the firing of the swivel he was thrown overboard and drowned, and this clearing of the Indians from the boat for a short time gave Gray a chance to escape. Mrs. Stuart was taken almost lifeless as well as senseless, and was a captive until the day I carried her to your camp. After taking her from the boat, they (the Indians) differed among themselves as to whose slave or servant she should be. An Indian by the name of Yellow Hair said he had many years before been sick at or near St. Mary's, and that he felt it a duty to take the woman and treat her kindly, as he was treated so by a white woman when he was among the whites. The matter was left to an old Indian by the name of Bear Head, who decided in favor of Yellow Hair. I was told by the Indians that Yellow Hair treated her with great kindness and respect. I never asked her any questions as to her treatment, and presume she never knew me from any other Indian, as Brown and myself were both dressed like Indians. We knew long before we re-captured her what band she was with, and had tried to come up with them before.\n\nThe most tiresome march I ever made was one might in company with the present Gen. Twiggs. He with some soldiers, and I with a party of Indians, trying to rescue her at old Tallahassee, but the Indians had left before we reached the place. I shall never, while I live, forget the day we took her from the Indians. Billy Mitchell, a son of the then Indian agent, Brown, Kendall Lewis, John Winslett, Sam. Hall and myself, were the only white men that were with the Indians, except old Jack Carter, my pack-horseman. The white man I have named and the Hitchetas under Noble Kenard, and the Uchees under Timpoochy Barnard, commenced the fight. Shortly after the firing commenced, we could hear a female voice in the English language calling for help, but she was concealed from our view. The hostile Indians, though greatly inferior in number to our whole force, had the advantage of the ground, it being a dense thicket, and kept the party that first attacked at bay until Gen. McIntosh arrived with the main force. McIntosh, though raised among savage, was a General; yes, he was one of God's make of Generals. I could hear his voice above the din of fire-arms-\"Save the white woman! save the Indian women and children!\" All this time Mrs. Stuart was between the fires of the combatants. McIntosh said to me, \"Chulatarla Emathla, you Brown and Mitchell, go to that woman.\" (Chulatarla Emathla was the name I was known by among the Indians.) Mitchell was a good soldier and a bad cripple from rheumatism. He dismounted from his horse and said, \"Boys, let me lead the way.\" We made the change with some Uchees and Creeks, but Mitchell, poor fellow, was soon left behind, in consequence of his inability to travel on foot. I can see her now, squatted in the saw-palmetto, among a few dwarf cabbage trees, surrounded by a group of Indian women. There I saw Brown kill an Indian, and I got my rifle-stock shot off just back of the lock. Old Jack Carter came up with my horse shortly after we cut off the woman from the warriors. I got his musket and used it until the fight ended. You saw her (Mrs. Stuart) when she reached the camp, and recollect her appearance better than I can describe it.\n\nYou say you have seen the old lady, the mother of Isaac Brown. I never saw her but once, and that was in Twiggs county, Ga., about the last of February, 1818. It was at her own house. I called there to get Isaac to go with me to Florida, as I had been ordered by General Jackson to collect as many Indians as I could and join him at Fort Scott. Isaac had no horse that was suitable for the trip. I left my horse with Gen. Wimberly, and we took it on foot to Fort Early, trusting to Providence for horses after that. When we were about to leave, the old lady said, \"Isaac, my son, the Indians killed your father, and may kill you, but I had rather hear of your being killed than to hear that my son had acted the coward.\"\n\nThis is all the acquaince I ever had with the old lady; but I have had her history from many that knew her well. When Isaac was an infant, his father, who was a fearless man, crossed the Oconee river near what is known as the Long Bluff. The Oconee was then the line between the whites and Indians. Brown built him a house, and was preparing for stock raising. He always kept on hand a number of loaded guns and some fine dogs. One morning about daylight his dogs commenced barking; he opened the door to look out and was shot dead by an Indian, who had secreted himself near the house. At the report of the gun, the Indians raised the yell. Mrs. Brown drew her lifeless husband into the house, shut the door, and commenced firing at the Indians, and succeeded in driving them off. They soon returned, and set fire to a board shelter attached to the house. She climbed up the wall on the inside; and with a basin of milk extinguished the fire; and while in the act of pouring the milk on the fire, with her arm projecting through the logs, the Indians shot at and broke her shoulder. With one arm and the aid of a small boy, the son of one James Harrison, she succeeded the second time in driving the Indians away. She then escaped across the river with her children. A company was collected and repaired to the house, and they said it had not been a sham fight, for they found the white man in the house shot dead, and not far from the house two dead Indians, and not far from their trail were discovered signs as though they had been dressing wounds. Now you can account for Isaac Brown's being a soldier as easily as to account for Lexington and his half-brother, Lecompte, being race horses-it's in the blood. The boy that was with Mrs. Brown, was the son of James Harrison, who was a man of great daring and had suffered much from the Indians, and they in return had suffered much from him. He was the man who killed the father of the present speaker of the Creeks, Hopothleyoholo, and was known to the Indians as Epha Tustanugga, or Dog Warrior, and to the whites as Davy or David Cornels. Davy Cornels, I suspect, was the cause of more mischief done to the whites by the Creek Indians than any man that ever lived in the nation. He was troublesome during the Revolution and long after. While Seagroves was agent, Cornels sent him word that he wished to be at peace, and would meet him at Colerain, not a great way from St. Mary's. Seagroves unfortunately let it be known that he was expecting a visit from Cornels. Harrison heard of it, collected a few men, and I suspect Brown's father among the rest. All had suffered long and much from the depredations of Cornels and his men; they knew his path; they watched it closely, and one day as he approached them with a white flag, Harrison killed him. So ended the life of the most bitter enemy the whites ever had among the Creek Indians, Sowanoka Jack excepted.\n\nBy the time you get through what I have here scribbled, I reckon you will be a little cautious how you write to your old Indian acquaintances who have little else to do than sit and think over old times. You say you reckon I am now an old man; you are right. Time, the common leveler of our race, has not passed me unnoticed, and according to the course of things it will not be a great while before I am turned over to the terror of kings. If you see Jack and Thacker Howard, tell them I am living. May you live as long as suits your convenience.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nT. S. W.\n\nWheeling, Winn Parish, La.,\n\nJune 21st, 1858\n\nCol. A. J. Pickett:\n\nDear Sir:--I addressed to you, in April last, a letter through the Montgomery Mail. Some few days after I forwarded that, I wrote a second one, which I intended for you, but not knowing that my first was published, I declined sending the second. But a few days back I received the number of the Mail in which my letter was published. Whether you found that either instructive or interesting, I cannot say; but inasmuch as that has been published I shall risk another, and if our friend Hooper finds it too long and uninteresting, he can do with it as he has to do with other trash-throw it aside, or commit it to the flames.\n\nIn you letter to me of February last, you mentioned something of the inquiry I made in a private letter to my friend Hanrick, about a manuscript. Why that inquiry was made, I had learned that you had had, at one time, the manuscripts of George Stiggins, and possibly I might learn something of the manuscript I loaned him. I had no idea that anything I had written would be used by you, or any one else, in the history of a country; but the manuscripts of Christian Limbo, taken from Col. Hawkins' writings, I would have been glad to have gotten hold of, as it contained much I think (if now published) that would be new to you and others, and entertaining to all who take an interest in Indian history. Besides, it contained the copies of two letters written as far back as 1735, by Sir. James or Gen. Oglethorpe. They were written at different times, but both written at Frederica, on St. Simond's Island. The letters were directed to James McQueen, requesting him to use his influence with the Indians and prevent them, if possible, from taking sides with the Spaniards who were then threatening to attack the infant colony of Georgia. The letters were written in a style very different from letters written at the present day; and the bearer of those letters was a Scotchman named Malcolm McPherson. He was the natural father of Sehoya, or Sehoy McPherson, and she was the mother of Davy Tate and Billy Weatherford, and was not the daughter of Lauchlan McGillivray, as has been represented. McPherson was the man that gave Lauchlan McGillivray his first start as a trader. McGillivray came to the Creek nation in company with John Tate and Daniel McDonald. John Tate was the father of Davy Tate, and was the last agent the English Government ever had among the Creeks. During the American revolution, Tate raised a large number of Indians on the waters of Alabama, and from almost every town (except the Tallassees and Netchez, who, through the influence of McQueen, never did take up arms against the colonies during the revolution.) Tate carried his warriors to Chattahoochee, and there joined Tusta Nuggy Hopoy, or Little Prince, with the Chattahoochee Indians, and started to Augusta, Ga., to aid a Col. Grierson, better known as Grayson, a Tory Colonel. Near the head springs of the Upatoy creek, and near old Fort Perry, Tate became deranged; the cause I never learned. He was brought back to old Cussetaw and died; he was buried on a high hill east of the old town, and near what was the residence of Gen. Woolfolk when I left the country. I have been shown his grave often, and have heard what I have stated from Little Prince, and a hundred others that were along at the time. When Tate died, the Alabama Indians mostly returned, except the Tuckabatchys under Efau Tustanuggy, or Dog Warrior. (He was known to the whites as Davy Cornels; he was the father of the present speaker of the Creeks, Hopoithleyohola, and a brother of Alexander McGillivray's last wife.) This man with his warrior accompanied the Little Prince and his party to Augusta, and did some fighting and much other mischief.\n\nThis man Davy Cornels did more mischief to the whites than any man that has lived among the Creeks, and was the most hostile and bitter enemy the whites ever had among the Creeks, Savannah Jack excepted. While Seagrove was agent, Cornels sent him word he wished to be at peace and would visit him at Colerain, near St. Mary's. It was known to some whites that Seagrove was expecting a visit from Davy Cornels-a James Harrison that had suffered much by the Indians, way-laid Cornel's path and killed him, bearing a white flag. We might go back to Lauchlan McGillivray; he was a Scotchman, as was Tate. And not long before or after Tate had left the nation for Augusta, McGillivray took his two children, Sophy and Alexander, and started for Savannah; the Americans lay around Col. Campbell's camp or fort in such numbers that he was forced to send his children back to the nation by his negro man Charles. Charles lived with and about me for years, and I have heard him and others who corroborated his statement, tell it often. Sophy was the oldest of the two. So, you see, you and I differ widely as to the time Alexander McGillivray came into existence, because Alex. McGillivray's mother was not the daughter of a Frenchman or French officer. She was a full blooded Tuskegee Indian. Your history says Alexander was the first born of Lauchlan McGillivray and Sehoy Marchand. I speak nothing but the truth when I tell you that I know my opportunities for information on this subject have been much better than yours, and that Sophy was the oldest child and an own sister to Alexander, and that will do away with the dream of so much books and papers. Your history says that the mother of Tate and Weatherford was a sister to Alexander McGillivray. I will now tell you how you have been led into that error; I see you speak of the Wind tribe of Indians, and I also see that you give Barrent Deboy's versions of it; he never could tell the difference between clan as family and a tribe. I have before this, in one of my letters to Mr. Hooper, tried to explain this family arrangement. The Creek Indians were laid off in families or clans, as were the Scots with their Campbells, McPherson, McGregers, and so on, with this difference: the Scotch clan had just as many privileges as their numbers and the strength of their arms would allow them. The privileges of the Indian clans were prescribed by their laws, but the Wind family or clan were always allowed more than the Bears, Panthers, Foxes and others; and any of these families in speaking of the family to which he or she belonged, claimed kin with the whole family as brother, sister, uncle, aunt, and at the same time be noways related by blood. And as to what family Tate and McGillivray's wives belonged, I do not pretend to say, though I am certain that's the way the relationship has come about. For I never heard of the mother of McGillivray being crossed upon the French until I saw it in your history. But always understood her to be a full Indian, and the mother of Tate and Wetherford to be a half-breed, and the most interesting woman in the nation of her time.\n\nI see in your history, for the first time I ever heard of such a thing, that Alexander McGillivray was an educated man. That's new to me as it would have been to himself, could he have been shown it in his day. The letters purporting to have been written by him which appear in the History of Alabama, are well written, and show conclusively that they emanated from no ordinary man. But could the author of those letters and McGillivray to whom they are ascribed, look back, they could say that the world is yet as credulous as in their time. If there is any one living that can or could identify the hand writing of a Scotchman by the name of Alex. F. Leslie, he could easily tell who wrote those letters. This man Leslie did McGillivray's writing and was worthy of (so far as intellect is concerned) the notice of his distinguished relation of our own country, General Alexander Hamilton.\n\nLeslie was by birth a Scotchman. He came to the Island of Barbadoes when a young man; from thence to St. Augustine, Fla. He was engaged in business with Forbes, Panthon and others; spent much of his time among the Creek Indians; and was the father of the half-breed Alexander Leslie that the Fort of Talladega was called after. That was Fort Leslie and not Fort Lashly, as they have given it to you. This much, I knew the half-breed as well as any other in the Nation. The history of his father I have had from Hamby and Irish Doyle, (not Nimrod Doyle,) both well educated men, and in the service of Panthon, Forbes and Leslie for years; besides, I heard Gov. McIntosh, of Florida, many years ago, speaking of the many shrewd men that had at an early day come to Florida, say that this man Leslie was the most talented man of the whole. I knew Gov. Clark, of Ga., Gen. Adams, Col. Sam. Alexander and (not James Alexander) all Indian fighters and frontiermen-knew McGillivray well-and all spoke of him and admitted him to be a man of great natural sense, but never learned from any of them that he was an educated man.\n\nI knew Gen. Newnan well-served with him long in the army. He was an officer at Fort Wilkinson when the meeting you speak of took place between General Pickens and others with McGillivray, at the Rock Landing. Gen. Newnan knew both the men, and said Billy McIntosh was the greatest man of the two-that is, McIntosh and McGillivray. Now, for a moment, if your history of that meeting be correct, and no doubt it is, it will prove that McGillivray was not the man of learning that you represent him to be. His quitting the Council, going off to the Ocmulgee with his people, writing back that he left to get a good feeding ground for his horses-I know every foot of ground and every branch he crossed, and through what is now Baldwin and Jones counties, was then one of the best range countries that ever existed in Georgia or Alabama. That portion of your history gives the true character of McGillivray, as it does the true character of the Indian when a talk don't suit them; break up and go off. But it was a subterfuge that so able and learned a man, so superior to those commissioners on the part of United States diplomacy, would not likely have resorted to. To detract or hide, willfully, from the world what the dead merited while living, would be unpardonable, but every thing that is said or written of those departed ones, (or even living ones,) to make them greater than they really were, that much the biographer does at his own expense. I never knew McGillivray, but I think I know his true character as well as any now living, and better than many that knew him when living, as I have mingled much with both whites and Indians that knew him well. As I once wrote to a gentleman before I ever saw your history, had Alexander McGillivray been living in the War of 1813 and '14, and could have united his people, the history of that war would have been a very different one to what it is. I know it was the opinion of Gen. Washington that McGillivray acted with duplicity towards our government, and you in your history give the reader to think that he was a treacherous man. But I differ with your history as I do with the best man that has left his name on record, as to McGillivray's true character. I know that McGillivray never liked our people or our government, but that he carried out every promise that he ever made, and in good faith too, I have no doubt. I have learned this from those that knew him-knew his feelings, and the awkward situation he was placed in, and what he had contended with. He had to deal more or less with the United States, England, and Spain, all three jealous of McGillivray, and all jealous of each other; it would have taken a man North of Mason and Dixon's line to wear a face to have suited all those that McGillivray had to deal with and make any thing of a fair show.\n\nAnother thing that satisfies me McGillivray was not the learned man, or man of letters, that you make him to be; you can find no letters from Gen. Washington to him, or from him to Gen. Washington; perhaps a letter or two to Gen. Knox, written by Leslie, with McGillivray's name attached to them, may be found, but no others. The idea of McGillivray, (with the learning you give him,) suffering himself dubbed General, in a government where the organic law of the land prohibited his being a citizen, is as absurd as any things can be. And then trapsing the streets of cities with an American uniform on, is suited to the Indian character, but not that of a profound scholar. Besides, I am very much inclined to doubt if there is a record in existence to show or prove that he ever mastered the Latin and Greek languages, in any school either in South Carolina or Georgia, and am as much inclined to doubt their being a Masonic Lodge or Chapter that can show that he was ever a member of one or both. I was raised in Georgia, but have never read its history, nor have I ever heard before I saw it in your history, of those large confiscated estates of Lauchlan McGillivray. Though I have often heard that Malcom McPherson and George Galpin lost much by the war and the British, but not by the Americans. I knew Davy Tate well and spent near seven weeks with him at one time, many years ago; he was decidedly the most sensible and well informed man I have ever seen of the Indian blood, (that is the Creek;) he was not educated; a man of much truth, and like his half-brother, a man of great firmness. He has talked to me much; I never heard him say that McGillivray was a man of letters. But he has often said to me that MbGillivray lived pretty much upon the property of his (Tate's) father, and that the man Daniel McDonald, that I have before spoken of who came to the country with Lauchlan McGillivray and John Tate, that after the disappearance of Lauchlan McGillivray from the country, he (Daniel McDonald) assumed the name of Daniel McGillivray, and fell heir to most of McGillivray's property that he left in the nation. This I have learned from others, as well as Davy Tate.\n\nThis man Daniel McDonald, or Daniel McGillivray, was the father of the chief known as Bit Nose Billy McGillivray. The Gen. Leclerk Milfort you frequently refer to as authority, I never heard of, though I have often heard of a little Frenchman by the name of Milfort Dusong, who had lived in the nation before I knew it; this man Milfort had an Indian wife and left one son, Alexander or Sandy Dusong. I knew him; he emigrated with the Creeks to Arkansas in '36 and '37. It is not unfrequently the case with Indians, as it is with the whites, to claim relationship with distinguished persons, particularly Virginians. I have not seen a little darkskined, swarthy man from Virginia, for the last thirty years, no matter what race he sprange from, but claimed kin with John Randolph, and the Powetan family.\n\nI knew Alexander McGillivray's children well; his daughter Peggy was the wife of Charles Cornels, and died before Cornels hung himself. His daughter Lizzy lived by me for years; I purchased hers and her son's land. They were located on section 16, in township 16 and range 24; it lies in Macon county, near Tuskegee; I sold it to James Dent. I lived many years by Mrs. McGirth; she was McGillivray's last wife; spoke good English,--from none of these did I ever learn that he was a scholar.\n\nI could say much more upon this subject, but this is already too long. I will close this by saying to you, that as you and I both have had to rely upon the statements of others for what we write, and you much more than myself, we will remain as we always have been, friends, and let those that read what we write judge which is most likely to be right. When I have time I will write and point out many errors that you have been led into that I know of my own knowledge, and come within the knowledge of others that still live. It is our nature when we say or write a thing, to wish the world to believe us right, (and many wish it if they know they are wrong.) But there is nothing more noble and generous in a man, than when he finds he is in error to own and abandon it. And as there has been some little interest taken or felt in what I have written, if I can, I will spend a month or two in Montgomery next winter. I could tell you many things that have been forgotten, and could point out many places that would interest you and others that are living there.\n\nYours, &c.,\n\nT. S. W.\n\nWheeling, Winn Parish, La.\n\nJuly 8, 1858\n\nJ. J. Hooper, Esq.:\n\nDear Sir: The entry of Gen. LaFayette into Alabama, was the most imposing show I witnessed while I lived in the State. In 1824, I think it was, LaFayette was looked for in Alabama. I was the first and oldest Brigadier General in Alabama, (after it became a State.) Gen. Wm. Taylor, I think, was the oldest Major General; and Israel Pickens was Governor. There may have been his equal, but there never has been his superior in that office since Alabama became a State. At the time LaFayette was expected, Gen. Taylor was absent, I think, in Mobile. The Indians were a little soured, from a treaty that had been, or was about being made with the Georgians. Gov. Pickens requested me to take an escort and conduct LaFayette through the nation. The Hon. James Abercrombie then commanded the Montgomery Troop, and Gen. Moore of Claiborne, commanded the Monroe Troop, both of whom volunteered their services. Before the escort left Alabama, (which then extended only to Line Creek, ) Gen. Taylor arrived and took the command.\n\nThat was before the day of platforms and conventions-men lived on their own money. You must guess then there was some patriotic feeling along, for there were between two and three hundred persons, all bearing their own expenses. Some in going and coming had to travel four hundred miles, and none less than two hundred miles. Besides the military, there were a number of the most respectable citizens of Alabama-among whom were Boling Hall, ex-member of Congress, ex-Gov. Murphy, John D. Bibb, John W. Freeman and Col. James Johnston, one of the best men that ever lives or died. If there are any such men these days, I have not had the pleasure of their acquaintance. Our trip to the Chattahoochee was pleasant indeed. We made our head-quarters three miles from Fort Mitchell, on big Uchee Creek, at Haynes Crabtree's. Had that been a war, and if it had continued till the present day, all of that crowd that's now living would be soldiers. After some three or four days' stay at Crabtree's we learned that Gen. LaFayette had passed White Water, and we knew at what time he would reach the river. The Indians seemed to take as much interest in the matter as the whites. All hands mustered on the west of Alabama side, where he could see the Georgia escort approach the east bank of the Chattahoochee, with their charge. On the east bank, Gen. LaFayette was met by Chilly McIntosh, son of the Indian Gen. McIntosh, with fifty Indian warriors, who were stripped naked and finely painted. They had a sulky prepared with drag-ropes, such as are commonly used to drawing cannon. The General was turned over by the Georgians to the Indians. That was the greatest show I ever saw at the crossing of any river. It beat all of Gen. Jessup's wind bridges across the Tallapoosa, and other places where there was never much more water than would swim a dog, only at a high rise. As the ferry-boat reached the Alabama side, the Indians, in two lines, seized the ropes, and the General seated in the sulky, was drawn to the top of the bank, some eighty yards, where stood the Alabama Delegation. At a proper distance from the Alabama Delegation, the Indians opened their lines, and the sulky halted.\n\nEverything, from the time the General entered the ferry, till this time, had been conducted in the most profound silence. As the sulky halted, the Indians gave three loud whoops. The General then alighted, took off his hat, and was conducted by Chilly McIntosh, a few steps, to where stood Mr. Hall, with head uncovered, white with the frost of age. I knew Mr. Hall from my boyhood. He always showed well in company; but never did I see him look so finely as on that occasion-he looked like himself-what he really was-an American gentleman. As McIntosh approached Mr. Hall, he said, \"Gen. LaFayette, the American friend\"-\"Mr. Hall, of Alabama,\" pointing to each as he called his name. Mr. Hall, in a very impressive manner, welcomed LaFayette to the shores of Alabama, and introduced him to the other gentlemen. Dandridge Bibb then addressed the General at some length. I heard a number of persons address LaFayette on his route through Alabama-none surpassed Dandridge Bibb, and none equaled him, unless it was Hitchcock and Dr. Hustis at Cahaba. I have always been looked upon as rather dry-faced; but gazing on the face of the most distinguished patriot that it had ever fallen to my lot to look upon, and the feeling remarks of Mr. Bibb on that occasion, caused me, as it did most others that were present, to shed tears like so many children.\n\nAfter the address at the river, all marched to Fort Mitchell hill, where there was an immense crowd of Indians, the Little Prince at their head. He addressed the \"French Captain,\" through Hamley, in true Indian style. I could understand much of his speech, but cannot begin to give it as Hamley could. The Prince said that he had often heard of the French Captain, \"but now I see him, I take him by the hand, I know from what I see, he is the true one I have heard spoken of; I am not deceived-too many men have come a long way to meet him. He is bound to be the very man the Americans were looking for.\" The Prince, after satisfying the General that he (the Prince) was satisfied that the General was the true man spoken of and looked for, then went on to say, that he had once warred against the Americans, and that the French Captain had warred for them, and of course they had once been enemies, but were now friends; that he (the Prince) was getting old, which his withered limbs would show-making bare his arms at the same time-that he could not live long; but he was glad to say, that his people and the whites were at peace and he hoped they would continue so.\n\nBut he had raised a set of young warriors, that he thought would prove worthy of their sires, if there should ever be a call to show themselves men; and that as a ball play was, outside of war, the most manly exercise that the Red Man could perform, he would, for the gratification of the General and his friends, make his young men play a game. The old man then turned to his people, and said to them-they were in the presence of a great man and warrior; he had commanded armies on both sides of the Big Water; that he had seen many nations of people; that he had visited the Six Nations, in Red Jacket's time, (the General told the Indians he had visited the Six Nations, ) that every man must do his best-show himself a man, and should one get hurt he must retire without complaining, and by no means show anything like ill humor. The speech ended, about two hundred stripped to the buff, paired themselves off and went at it. It was a ball play sure enough, and I would travel farther to see such a show than I would to see any other performed by man, and willingly pay high for it, at that. The play ended, and all hands went out to head quarters at Big Uchee, where we were kindly treated by our old friend Haynes Crabtree.\n\nThere was a man, then living among the Indians, Capt. Tom Anthony, who long since found a last resting place in the wilds of Arkansas. He was a man of fine sense and great humor. There was also an Indian known as Whiskey John. John was the greatest drunkard I ever saw; he would drink a quart of strong whiskey without taking the vessel that contained it from his lips, (this is Alabama history, and there are plenty now living that have seen him do it.) To see John drink was enough to have made the fabled Bacchus look out for a vacancy that frequently occurs among the Sons of Temperance. Capt. Anthony told John that all hands had addressed the French Chief, and that it was his duty to say something to him on behalf of those that loved whiskey. John could speak considerable English in a broken manner. It so happened that the General and others were walking across the Uchee Bridge when John met them. John made a low bow, as he had seen others do. The General immediately pulled off his hat, thinking he had met with another Chief. John straightening himself up to his full height, (and he was not very low,) commenced his speech in the manner that I will try to give it to you. \"My friend, you French Chief! me Whiskey John,\" (calling over the names of several white persons and Indians;) \"Col. Hawkins, Col. Crowell, Tom Crowell, Henry Crowell, Billy McIntosh, Big Warrior Indian, heap my friends, give me whiskey, drink, am good. White man my very good friend me, white man make whiskey, drink him heap, very good, I drink whiskey. You French Chief, Tom Anthony say me big Whiskey Chief. You me give one bottle full. I drink him good.\" The General informed John that he did not drink whiskey, but would have his bottle filled. John remarked \"Tom Anthony you very good man, me you give bottle full. You no drink, me drink him all, chaw tobacco little bit, give me some you.\" Now the above is an Indian speech, and no doubt will appear silly to some who have not been accustomed to those people. Should it, however, fall under the eye of those who were along at the time, they will recognized John's speech, and call to mind our old friends, Capt. Anthony and Col. James Johnson, who was the life of the crowd.\n\nWe remained that night at Crabtree's and the next day reached Fort Bainbridge, where he Indian countryman lived, by the name of Kendall Lewis, as perfect a gentleman, in principle, as ever lived in or out of the nation, and had plenty, and it in fine style. The next day we started for Line Creek.\n\nIt fell to my lot to point out many Indians, as well as places, for we were stopped at almost every settlement to shake hands, and hear Indian speeches. Among many things and places that were pointed out to the General, was the place where Lot was killed, the old \"Lettered Beech,\" at Persimmon swamp, the old Council Oak, Floyd's battle ground, the grave of James McGirth, the place where McGirth made peach brandy, many years before, and many other things. That night we reached Walter B. Lucas'. Every thing was \"done up\" better than it will ever be again; one thing only was lacking-time-we could not stay long enough. The next morning we started for Montgomery. Such a cavalcade never traveled that road before or since.\n\nOn Goat Hill, [The site of the present Capitol of Alabama] and near where Capt. John Carr fell in the well, stood Gov. Pickens, and the largest crowd I ever saw in Montgomery. Some hundred yards east of the Hill, was sand flat, where Gen. LaFayette and his attendants quit carriages and horses, formed a line and marched to the top of the hill. As we started, the band struck up the old Scottish air, \"Hail to the Chief.\" As we approached the Governor, Mr. Hill introduced the General to him. The Governor tried to welcome him, but, like the best man the books give account of, when it was announced that he was commander of the whole American forces, he was scarcely able to utter a word. So it was with Gov. Pickens. As I remarked before, Gov. P. had no superior in the State, but on that occasion he could not even make a speech. But that did not prevent Gen. LaFayette from discovering that he was a great man; it only goes to prove what is often said, that many who feel most can say least, and many who have no feeling say too much.\n\nThe people of Montgomery did their duty. Col. Arthur Hayne, who was a distinguished officer in the army in the war of 1813, and who was the politest gentleman I ever saw, was the principal manager. If the Earl of Chesterfield had happened there he would have felt as I did the first time I saw a fine carpet on a floor and was asked to walk in; I declined, saying, \"I reckon I have got in the wrong place.\" Several steamboats were in waiting at the wharf, and the next morning all hands went aboard and started for Cahaba, at thal time the Seat of Government.\n\nAt Cahaba, as in Montgomery, everything was \"done up\" as it should be. There the General met with Major Porter, whom he had known in the Revolution. There I shed more tears. The General examined the old ditch that had been cut by his countrymen many years before. An old cannon was shown him also, which was left by the French Army, when they quit the country. He remarked that those relics caused sad feelings, that there was still a pleasure, a kind of melancholy pleasure, which he could not describe.\n\nAbout this time a gentleman was wounded from the firing a cannon on a trading boat. The General visited the wounded man, and took much interest in his welfare; he was told that the gentleman had many friends who would care for him; I told him that he was an old camp mate of mine; he replied, \"one good soldier will always take care of another.\" I remained in Cahaba until the General embarked on board a steamboat for Mobile; I accompanied him on board, and on bidding him farewell, said, \"I have done what little I could to make your journey to this place as pleasant as possible, and I now have to leave you.\" He took my by the hand and said, \"I thank you kindly; may God bless and prosper the young and thriving State you live in; I shall always cherish the kindest feelings for you and the other gentlemen that escorted me through the nation, as well as all others who have taken so much trouble to make me welcome among you.\" The last words I heard him utter were, \"Farewell, my friend! Take care of that wounded man.\"\n\nYours,\n\nT. S. W.\n\nWheeling, Winn Parish, La.,\n\nAugust 12th, 1858\n\nCol. Albert J. Pickett\n\nDear Sir:-- In my letter to you of the 21st June last, which was published in Montgomery Mail of the 23d July, I see a mistake that I will here correct. In speaking of Davy Tate, it is said he was not an educated man. Mr. Tate was an educated man; and, if I am not mistaken, he informed me that he was educated near Abernethy, in Scotland, and was about ten years younger than Alexander McGillivray. As I may at some time after this, speak more of Mr. Tate and his half brother, Weatherford, I will leave them here, and give you some of my reasons for having said to Mr. Hooper, in a letter some time back, that I was more inclined to credit the Indian tradition of DeSoto's expedition through the country, than those Spanish and Portuguese authors.\n\nBefore I commence with the Indian account of DeSoto's travels through Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana, I will point out a few things, among the many, that those Spanish and Portuguese gentry have grossly erred in. They may appear to you and others as very trivial objections. But they are errors; and if a man willfully misrepresents one thing, he will another; and if he does it ignorantly once, he is liable to do it again. And as I alluded to the killing of a panther, the raising of hogs on the road, the building of brigantines, I will here speak more of these things.\n\nThe history says that the Spanish captive, Jean Ortez, one night, while guarding the Indian tombs or the dead Indians, killed a panther trying to carry off a dead child. This story does not only prove that they wrote falsely, but that they were poor zoologists; for the panther is an animal that never preys upon putrid flesh. This is a fact known to every hunter, from the days of the grand-son of Ham, down to the Englishman, Boone, the early hunter of Kentucky; Mike Shuck, of Missouri; Albert Pike and Kit Carson, of the plains of New Mexico; Winthrop Colbreath, of the Caddo Mountains of Arkansas: to John L. Winston, of Texas. Besides, the Indians that I have been acquainted with, all inhabited countries that were infested with wolves and other animals which prey upon their dead, if left exposed, and always guarded against such. And putting their dead in boxes, leaving them above the earth, is a thing I never heard of before. All that is necessary to refute the hog story, for sensible men-who know anything of hog-raising, the time they go with their young, the time it requires for them to be fit for use, and this to be done on a farm where every necessary preparation is made for raising them-is to read the narrative, notice the country they traveled through, the many rivers they had to cross-and the Mississippi among them-then the quantity of those animals left behind for the successor of DeSoto, and his men to kill and pack away, (and if packed at all, must have been without salt;) all I ask is, to examine the account given by those men, and then say if there is the slightest probability of its being true. Now, the building of seven brigantines, in the short space of seven months, fitting them out, riggings them up with sails made of Indian mantles, with the means they had for carrying on such work-this, if not a palpable fiction, is a very improbably story, particularly when we take into consideration that these vessel were made sea-worthy, and had to descend the Mississippi river from some point in Arkansas to the Gulf, and then across to some point on the coast of Mexico. It is a tale that will do to tell to marines, but old sailors, old seamen and ship carpenters, will never believe it to be true. The stories of the fine specimens of pearls and martin skins being found in the country, are equally fabulous with the others. Pearls are not to be found at the present day, nor ever have been since I knew or heard of the country; and the martin is an animal that never inhabited the country. And there is very little probability of there being any trade at that day so advantageous, among the Southern Indians, as would induce the Northern Indians (in whose country a few martins might have been found) to trade at such a great distance from home, on martin skins alone-for almost all the other animals that Indians hunted for their flesh and skins, were in as great, if not greater, abundance in the south and south-west, than in any other portion of what is now the United States. If you will notice in many of the minor occurrences of the expedition, they give the day and date, month and year; but no date is given when the hero of the expedition dies. Now if those that have made mention of DeSoto's dying at some point in Arkansas had known the time he did die, they would in all probability have given us the precise time, as well as the place of his decease. From the Indian tradition and from what those men wrote who returned to Europe, I think it more than probable they never knew what became of DeSoto and the few men that were with him when he did die. Fable is fable, and history is history and those men thought it best to mix them as they were writing for a people not unlike many of the present day-who never look into books unless it is for pictures and the marvelous yarns it contains. I will now give you the Indian account of the expedition.\n\nDeSoto commenced his march from Tampa Bay; and the first winter camped on the Apalachicola river, near Ocheese. Which place has been known in my time as Spanny-Wakee-that is the Spanish camp, or the Spaniards lay there. Their object was gold. They there divided their force into several commands under various individuals, marching in a northerly direction, through portions of Georgia and Alabama. The Indians say that none of DeSoto's men ever crossed the east of the Oconee river, unless it was some of its head branches. A portion of the Spaniards made their way up the Chattahoochee to Owe-Cowka, or the shoals of Columbus; there they called a halt, until they could correspond with the others that had gone farther east and north. Tallapoosa was then known as the river of towns; Tuckabatchee being the most important town in the nation, except Cusseta, was the point for the different commands to meet at. A portion of them had traveled the route through northern Georgia, as you describe, and then a south-westerly course, through a portion of Alabama, reaching the Tallassees who then occupied a portion of what is now Talladega. Their principal town was on a creek that bears their name to this day, by the Indians. In this time, the Spaniards had become obnoxious to the Indians; particularly those that had been quartered about where Columbus now is. This party left the Chattahoochee for Tuckabatchee and traveled pretty much the route that now leads from Columbus to Pole Cat Springs; their trail or trace passed through Tuskegee, ond has been known as DeSoto's trace ever since. I knew the country long before, and many that are now living knew it, as DeSoto's trace. The party that took this route missed their way, and instead of going to Tuckabatchee they reached the Tallapoosa lower down, where the Indians disputed their passage, and a fight ensued. The place they fought at took its name from the fight, Thlea Walla or Rolling Bullet; it is sometimes called Cuwally, and at others Hothleawally, by many, but Thlea Walla is the proper name. And it was at this place, no doubt, that that greatly exaggerated Maubile fight took place; and I will give you many good reasons for believing it. In the first place, the Indians never gave an account of any other fight with Tustanugga Hatke or White Warrior, as they called DeSoto. Another reason is that the Tallassees or Tallaces, at that time evidently occupied a portion of Talladega; and from Talladega down to Thleawalla about suits the distance that they would have had to travel. It was in Tallagdega that the Tallasses lived; and it must have been at that point where the invitation from Tuscaloosa was received by DeSoto. I have remarked somewhere long before this that the Tuckabatchy town, on Tallapoosa, was settled at least two centuries before the Tallasees settled the town that they left in 1836. I now say to you, without the fear of being contradicted by any one that knows, that the Tallasses never settled on the Tallapoosa river before 1756; they were moved to that place by James McQueen-McQueen settling himself at the same time near where Walter Lucas once had a stand, at the crossing of Line Creek; and it was at that place on Line Creek where the celebrated negro interpreter, John McQueen, was born. The Tallasses quit their old settlements in the Talladega country, and it was immediately occupied by a band of Netches, under the control of a chief called Chenubby, and a Hollander by the name of Moniac. This man was the father of Sam Moniac, whom you in your History call McNae, thinking him to be of Scotch race. The chief Chennubby lived to be a very old man. I knew him as well as I did any Indian in the Nation. He was with Gen. Jackson in the Creek War; he was with me in Florida in 1818. I have often by a camp fire sat and listened to him tell over his troubles among the French, on the Mississippi, and how the French had drove them from their old homes; and how he had helped to drive the French from their trading house at the forks of Coosa and Tallapoosa. It was his son, young Chennubby or Sarlotta Fixico, who left Fort Leslie and went to Gen. Jackson's camp. The story of the hog-skin over the Indian, is all a hoax.\n\nBut to return to the Spaniards. You see they speak of Coosa and Tallase; those names are easy to pronounce; and they no doubt visited those towns; but you never hear Tuckabatchy named, for they were not at the place. It was at Thlea Walla that the Indians picked up the copper and brass plates that you have heard spoken of. The Indians say that after DeSoto failed to find gold in the mountain countries of Georgia and Alabama, he steered his course a little north or west for the Mississippi; that his people divided; some turned to the seaboard and were picked up by the coasting vessels; some starved, and many died with disease: that DeSoto himself, with a small portion of his men, some Creeks, some Maubile or Movilla Indians, some Choctaws and others, tried to reach Mexico. He promised the Indians that accompanied him that he could make a peace with them and Cortez, or those Spaniards that had driven them from their old homes. And not far from a small lake and west of Red River, he built a fort to protect himself from the Netches, Natchitoches and Nacogdaches Indians; that he there died. This is the account given by all the Indians, and those that were acquainted with their traditions relative to the march of DeSoto through the country. The fort is yet very visible, and is known as the Azadyze; it is in Natchitoches Parish, in this State. This was Col. Silas Dinsmore's account, obtained from the Choctaws and Chicasaws, who was their agent at an early day, and a man of great intelligence. It was also the account that old Mr. Peechland gave, who lived among them many years. The Creek Indians say they once had a giant chief called Tustanugga Lusta or Black Warrior. But Tusca Loosa is a mixed word of Creek and Choctaw. Tusca is Creek, and signified a warrior-Loosa is Choctaw, and signifies black. But whether it was this man that fought DeSoto, I never heard; but have always understood that at Thlea Walla was the place they fought. The old French and Spanish settlers on Red River said that the descendants of DeSoto's men were among the natives when those nations (that is France and Spain) first commenced settling Louisiana. All this has satisfied me that Indians were more reliable in their traditions of that expedition than men that have written so much, and in so few instances have given the true Indian character as well as their modes of living. And why I am better satisfied that the Maubile fight took its origin from the Thlea Walla fight, is that there were but few remains of Indian settlements on the Alabama river below the mouth of Cahawba, and they were very small. The Coosa, Tallapoosa, and Chattahoochee and their waters were very thickly settled with Indians at an early day. The Maubile or Movillas were once a western people, but visited and settled Alabama before the Creeks did. There is yet a language the Texas Indians call the Mobilian tongue, that has been the trading language of almost all the tribes that have inhabited the country. I know white men that now speak it. There is a man now living near me that is fifty years of age, raised in Texas, that speaks the language well. It is a mixture of Creek, Choctaw, Chickasay, Netches and Apelash.\n\nFrom the time Columbus discovered the country, until DeSoto's expedition, was near a half century; and almost all the European nations that had shipping had become acquainted with the New World, and no doubt but the most of DeSoto's men that survived and reached the coast were picked up by coasting vessels, as the Indians have said. This is much more probable than that they (the Spaniards) built brigantines for that purpose. And no doubt there were occasional settlements on the coast at that time by Europeans-for Dr. Turnbull on settling a colony of Minorcans or Greeks in East Florida, south-west of St. Augustine, found the remains of civilization that the oldest natives then could give no account of. Turnbull made this settlement while the English claimed Florida. And when Lasalle settled a small colony in Texas, many years before Turnbull settled his, he (Lasalle) found the remains of civilization that he never could learn from the natives at what time or by whom they were executed. I read these account in a little book I picked up at the house of one Fashaw, in East Florida, forty-six years back. I kept the book for many years; it contained much useful information, and treated much of the early settlements in the South-West by Europeans-and much of what it contained I have heard corroborated by others.\n\nYours,\n\nT. S. W.\n\nWheeling, Winn Parish, La.,\n\nSeptember 16th, 1858\n\nTo J. J. Hooper, Esq:\n\nDear Sir-I do not take my pen in hand according to the old custom, but have it between my thumb and forefinger, and you can judge whether or not it improves my hieroglyphies. And as I have at times been detailing to you some few things about Indians and Indian customs, one thing I learned from them-that time was never an object with them; and at this time must follow their example-take my time.\n\nI received a letter the other day from my worthy friend, the Knight of the Horse-Shoe. I speak nothing but the truth when I say that I am truly glad to hear that he is still living and in good health. I hope he may live as long as suits his convenience. I don't know that I would care if he could live a thousand years, and die rich, so that I could be left to administer his estate. But he and myself will settle up long before that time, and put out; and if I continue in these piney-woods and it does not rain more, so that I can make better crops than I am making this year, I may make it convenient to die my own executor; or, at least, leave a very little job on hand for those that would undertake the settlement of my affairs.\n\nMy friend writes me that your city is improving, and that he is the only one left that settled at Montgomery as early as himself-that, I think, was in 1817. Arthur Moore, the first white man that built a house and lived in it at Motgomery, built it in the latter part of 1815, or early in 1816. The cabin stood upon the bluff above what was once called the ravine, and not far from where Gen. Scott put up a steam mill. The spot where the cabin stood had gone into the river before I left the country. And a man by the name of Tom Moore was the first settler at Selma. These are things that I know, and no matter who knows to the contrary. This is not very interesting, but as the names of the first settlers of many place have been handed down, from the first settling of the fruit garden to the present time, it will do no injury to either Montgomery or Selma to know their first settlers.\n\nI am glad to learn that your city, as well as the State, is improving. Alabama is very little in advance of what she should have been, when we look back and see who were its early settlers. No State that has come into the Union since the old thirteen, at its early settlement, equaled Alabama as to intellect or large planting interests. Alabama ought to lay off a county at least, in some important part of the State, and call it Abner McGehee; and the people of Montgomery particularly should make some mark to show to that posterity so often spoken of, that such a man as Abner McGehee had lived. I hope Alabama will continue to follow the example of her older sister-my native State-Georgia. All hands say they trust in kind Providence; and should it deny me the pleasure of ever visiting Alabama, I shall while I live cherish the kindest feeling for her, and particularly Montgomery and Selma, and more particularly that Queen or country villages, Tuskegee.\n\nI have received the Columbus paper that my friend Ned sent me. I notice the letter of a person that I recollect to have seen over forty years ago, and think I contributed a little in relieving that person from one of the most pitiable situations that it ever falls to the lot of a human being to be placed in. And I am sorry that one who in early life witnessed so many horrors, should in old age be reduced to destitution. [This refers to Mrs. Dill, to whom Gen. Woodward sent a sum of money. He was one of those who rescued her from the Indians, in 1818.] Say to my friend that I hope I know my duty, and had I not learned in early life to sympathise with and for the widow and orphan, that his many kind examples would long since have taught me my duty.\n\nI not long since received a letter purporting to be written by one George D. Taylor. I know it is not Col. George Taylor, of Coosa, for he is my friend and a gentleman. If there be such a man as George D. Taylor, and he writes to me again, I will beg permission to answer him through your paper, and will pledge myself to give as true a history of a person that he claims to be related to, as any one can give him that now lives.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. S. W.\n\nWheeling, Winn Parish, La.,\n\nOct. 20th, 1858\n\nTo J. J. Hooper, Esq.\n\nDear Sir:--Whenever a biographer, or one who writes sketches of the lives of others, no matter whether they be true or false, so long as he speaks in praise of the individual of whom he writes, he never can be charged with maliciously doing wrong, unless, by chance or otherwise, he raises the reputation of his hero at the expense of another. But if an individual from the best of motives, undertakes to correct errors to set mankind right in relation to the true history of men and things, he is often charged with being influenced by, or from, malicious motives, or something worse; particularly should he write any thing that would be the least calculated to dim in a small degree the luster thrown around some favorite by a good hearted, visionary biographer. But no truly conscientious man while living, could brook the idea of thanking a man, that after he was dead, would emblazon to the world a fame he was not entitled to, or ascribe to him deeds of daring that he had not performed while living. For what I am now going to write, I will no doubt be censured by some. But what need I care, for I am now old, and it will not be long before I appear at a place where a life time of truth will be worth more to me than all the good or bad opinions entertained of my by those I leave behind. I have just been looking over Col. Pickett's sketches relative to Gen. Sam Dale. And I find them so utterly incorrect, and the history of the man (by Col. P.) so entirely different from what I know it to have been, or know it to be, I must at least be allowed to say, that the Colonel has a very fruitful imagination, or has been most egregiously imposed upon, or perhaps both. But in justice to Col. Pickett, I must say, if I knew a man with little merit, that had seen one hostile Indian, a few teeth pulled out, a few eyes and noses operated on, and a few fingers amputated, who wished his life written while living or after he was dead, and it praised according to the most approved style, by modern light readers, I would recommend him to the Colonel, or the Colonel to him. For taking into consideration the subject of the Colonel's memoirs and the material he has had left him to work with, he can certainly color a picture as high as it will bear at least. I knew Gen. Dale before Col. P. was born, and knew him through life, and knew him well: none knew him better, and to give a true sketch of his life, would be to go back to Georgia and detail a hundred or more fist fights, and down to his last fight in Georgia, which was with John Wesley Webb, in Clinton, Jones county. Those who knew Gen. Dale, will recollect the scars on his face; they were the flesh marks of John Wesley Webb. Dale was an Indian trader, and traded with the Upper Towns in the Creek Nation, some of which I will name: the Oefuskes, Cieligees, Fish Ponds or Tatloulgees, Hillabys, Netches, Talladegas, or the people of the border. His principal partner was Col. Harrison Young. The half-breed that Col. Pickett alludes to as his partner, was his interpreter, by the name of John Berfort or Berford, and partly raised by Gen. Adams. If Dale was ever a Colonel in the Georgia line and killed two Indians at Ocfuske, on the Chattahoochee, I never heard of it. There was a trading path that crossed Chattahoochee going to Ocfuske on the Tallapoosa, and a few Indians traded at it; but the only Ocfuske town in my time was at Tallapoosa. The Horse Shoe was called Ocfuske. In point, I recollect Col. Fosh, he was once the Adjutant General of Georgia; the Georgians called him a Frenchman, but he was a Polander, and unfortunately for him and his men, the records giving an account of his exploits in Indian fighting have been lost. The only, or principal fight with whites and Creek Indians, between the Revolution and the War of 1813-14, that has been left on record, was Clark's fight at Jack's Creek; though there were some killed on both sides, before and after that. Not long after the fight with Webb, which I think was in 1810, Dale and Young moved to Mississippi Territory, near St. Stephens. It is a mistake about Dale being at the Indian Council at Tuckabatchy in 1811, at the time of Tecumseh's visit; and it is also a mistake about his having communicated to Col. Hawkins what was considered to be the object of Tecumseh's visit among the Creeks. For the Colonel had spies in the nation that watched the movements of him and the Big Warrior, and Billy McIntosh was one of them, and no white man was admitted into their councils; and could it now be ascertained to a certainty, I would hazard anything I have that Tecumseh, Seekaboo and their few followers were never seen by a half dozen white men that knew them, from the time they left the Wabash until they returned to the Warpicanatta Village. Christian Limbo, John Ward, Bob Walton and Nimrod Doyle saw Tecumseh at the Tallassee Square, opposite Tuckabatchy, and the reason why they were permitted to see him, was, that Walton and Doyle had known him in his younger days. These men have described Tecumseh to me minutely, and what well satisfied me they did so, I lived neighbor to the late Col. Clever of Arkansas, who was a Lieutenant in the last war, or war of 1812, and was at the battle of the Thames. It will be recollected by those who knew Col. Clever that he was a great friend of Col. Johnson, but denied him the credit of killing Tecumseh. He said Tecumseh was killed some time after Col. Johnson was wounded and disabled; that he was killed at least three hundred years from where the Colonel was shot. And while I am at it, I will go into a minute detail of Col. Clever's statement, as it corroborates the statement made by Doyle and Walton. He said, from the way the Indians rallied and fought around a certain Indian until he was killed, and a small trinket found on his person, that he was supposed to be a Chief. And there being but few if any among the whites that had known Tecumseh, except Gen. Harrison, it was some time after the close of the fight before it was ascertained that the dead Chief was Tecumseh; and it was only ascertained through the General. The circumstance of the bold stand made by the supposed Chief being communicated to Gen. Harrison, he visited the spot where the dead Indian lay; the body was much mangled, and as the General approached the spot a soldier was in the act of taking off a piece of skin from the Indian's thigh. The General ordered the soldier to stop, and said he regretted to know that he had such a man in his camp, and reprimanded his severely. He had some water brought, had the Indian washed and stretched his full length, examined his teeth and pronounced it to be Tecumseh. One of Tecumseh's legs was a little shorter than the other, and the foot on the short leg a little smaller, and he had a halt in his walk that was perceptible, and he had a tooth, though not decayed, of a bluish cast. This was Col. Clever's statement, that I have heard him make a hundred times; and his description corroborates that of Doyle and Walton, of Tecumseh. At all events, Tecumseh was killed at the battle of the Thames; history, or some portion of it, gives the credit to Col. Johnson; I have given Col. Clever's account of that affair, without giving my opinion as to who killed him. And there is but one man that I know of living that could give any satisfactory evidence of that matter-it is Gen. Lewis Cass, the present Secretary of State, of the United States.\n\nI will now go back to where I am better acquainted. Gen. Dale was in the Burnt Corn battle, but fomr what I have learned from the late Judge Lipscomb, of Texas, formerly of Alabama, and others, on the part of the whites, and Jim Boy, the principal War Chief, that was with McQueen, and whom Col. P. styles \"High Head Jim,\" the whole affair was but a light one. The Canoe Fight was reality-I knew all the party, that is, Gen. Dale, Col. Austill, James Smith and the negro Caesar. Col. Austill is yet living, and of course knows more of the fight than I can possibly know. But I have no doubt that he will say that the fight has been detailed by Col. Pickett to the best advantage for those engaged in it; and will also say that an Indian fight, either in a canoe or the bushes, alters its appearance very much by getting into a book or newspaper. I have heard the accounts given, from Gen. Dale down to Ceasar; it's a pity the eight big Indians killed in the canoe had not been taken to the shore for the landsmen to have looked at. Col. Pickett says a few years before that, that Gen. Dale was in the act of drinking, when two Indians tried to tomahawk him; that he knifed them, took their trail carrying five bleeding wounds, brained three more warriors, released a female prisoner and she killed the fourth. That's another exploit I never heard of. I suspect the woman's dead by now; and whether this startling event was in the Georgia wars between the Revolution and the war of 1813-14, or at what period or place, we are not told. The account only says some years before the Canoe fight. I could not help smiling when I read the Colonel's account of the Roman Consul, Acquilius, and comparing a case of Gen. Dale's in Mobile to that of the Consul's. Silence, I think, would have been the strongest appeal that persons in their situations could have made, particularly in Mobile, and would have evinced more greatness in both the General and Consul. Now, sir, let me tell you who General Dale was and what he was: he was honest, he was brave, he was kind to a fault, his mind was of the ordinary kind, now well cultivated, fond of speculation and not well fitted for it; a bad manager in money matters and often embarrassed, complained much of others for his misfortunes; was very combative, always ready to go into danger; would hazard much for a friend and was charitable in pecuniary matters, even to those he looked upon as enemies. I could relate many little frolics of his that might be interesting to a few, but as such things are witnessed almost daily, particularly where whiskey is drunk, I shall not mention them. He spent much of his time with me in 1834. He knew very little about Indian character, and entertained a good feeling for that persecuted people. So soon as he had an enemy in his power he has done, and would sympathise with and for him, and at times would cry like a child. I have given you the true character of Gen. Dale, and those that were old enough and were intimately acquainted with him, will tell you I have given a faithful account of the man as far as I have gone. What I have written is to correct error, not to detract, and you never can take from a man that which he never had. What Col. Pickett has written of Gen. Dale and others that I know, would do for a novel, but not history. Men who write history and wish to deal a little in the marvelous for the amusement of readers, should look around and see who is living, particularly if they are writing about things that have happened in their own time, and a little before.\n\nI will, in a day or two, write out and send you the true character of Billy Weatherford and the part he acted in the ear-some things I personally known, and others I obtained from Weatherford himself, and he was truly what the Indians called him. Billy Larney, or Yellow Billy, was one of his names; his other was Hoponica-futsahia, or Truth Maker or Teller. And as Col. Pickett has failed to give us a history of the war of 1836-7, in Alabama, and as I participated with him and others in that memorable struggle to see who could get first into Mr. Belser's paper, and for fear some may die off and not do it, I will write that out and send it to you.\n\nIt will be seen that I have alluded to Col. Johnson, and that there are doubts as to his killing Tecumseh; it matters not who killed Tecumseh, Col. Johnson proved himself a distinguished man, not only as a soldier, but in everything else that he has undertaken. And that is a subject I should not have alluded to here, but I see in Col. Pickett's history that he says Gen. Dale saw Tecumseh at the Council with the Creek Indians in 1811, which I am certain is incorrect. Persons that have not read Col. Picket's history of Alabama, will lose much of my meaning. And notwithstanding many of the Colonel's pictures are highly wrought and his information and knowledge of the modern Creeks and their war with the whites in 1813-14, are very imperfect, his history is very well written, and will be found by those who have not read it in interesting work. I will close this by simply remarking that it matters not whose reputation history raises, or whose character it damages, it is the duty of all that can do so, to correct its errors.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nT. S. W.\n\nWheeling, Winn Parish, La.,\n\nOctober 31st, 1858\n\nTo J. J. Hooper, Esq:\n\nDear Sir: Some months back I addressed a letter to Mr. Rutherford of Union Springs, containing some of the incidents of the life of Billy Weatherford. Not having seen it published, I have concluded to give you a few sketches of the history of that man and the part he took in the war of 1813-14. His father was Charles Weatherford, a white man, that came to the Creek Nation shortly after the close of the American Revolution, in company with Sam Mimms, who was once engaged with George Galphin in the Indian trade. Weatherford's mother was a half breed Tuskegee, her father was a Scotchman by the name of Malcolm McPherson, and a blood relation to the late Judge Berrien, of Georgia. Sehoy or Schoya McPherson was brought up in her early days by the father of Sam Moniac. She lived a part of her time with Lauchlan McGillivray and Daniel McDonald. Her first husband was Col. John Tate, the last agent the English had among the Creeks. By Tate she had one son, Davy, who is remembered by many who are yet living. Davy Tate was a man of fine sense, great firmness and very kind to those with whom he was intimate, and remarkably charitable to strangers. But circumstances caused Tate to mix but little with the world after the country fell into the hands of the whites, and he never was well known by but few after that. I have stated to you before that Col. Tate died deranged between Flint River and Chattahoochee, and was buried near old Cuseta. Charles Weatherford was the second and last husband of Sehoy McPherson. They raised four children that I knew. Betsy, the oldest child, married Sam Moniac, and was the mother of Major David Moniac, who was educated at West Point and was killed by the Seminoles in the fall of 1836-he was educated at West Point in consequences of the faithful and disinterested friendship of his father to the whites. Billy was the next oldest, Jack next, and the younger daughter whose name I have forgotten. She married Capt. Shumac, a very intelligent officer of the United State army. I had seen Billy Weatherford before the war, but only knew him from character. The circumstance of him and Moniac aiding Col. Hawkins in the arrest of Bowles, made them generally known to the people of Georgia who wished to know anything about Indians. It would be too tedious to tell you how I first became acquainted with Weatherford. I was with Gen. Floyd in the Nation, and was at his night fight at Calebee; a few days after the fight the army returned to Fort Hull. The time was about expiring for which the troops had to serve, and a call was made for volunteers to take charge of the fort until the Militia from the two Carolinas could arrive. Capt. John H. Broaduax, a very efficient and popular captain, from Putnam county, Georgia, soon raised a company of infantry; a Lieutenant Adaroin from Franklin county raised a rifle corps, and I volunteered as his Orderly Sergeant. I few days before that, the present Gen. Twiggs, then a Captain in the regular army, had forced his way through to the army with his company. The army left, and the three companies above mentioned took charge of the Fort, Col. Homer V. Milton in command. All I recollect to have done myself was to take some authority that one of my rank was not entitled to, under the rules and articles of war, and Capt. Twiggs put me in stocks. And for fear you may think the case worse than it was, I will say to you that I only rendered another Sergeant unfit for duty. I think the whole story would amuse you if you could hear it, but it would be too long for the present; I may give it to you hereafter. I was in the stocks but a few minutes before I was released, and I think after that I was rather a favorite both with the Captain and Colonel. The Colonel wanted an express sent to Gen. Graham at Fort Mitchell. It had to be taken on foot; I volunteered my service, and got George Lovitt, a tall half breed; and obtained a pair of shoes from an Irishman by the name of James Gorman, whom I had known near two years before that in Florida, in the Spanish Patriot service, under my old and intimate friend, Billy Cone. The distance was only forty-five miles. Lovitt and I went in one night, got everything ready and returned to Fort Hull the next night. The troops began to arrive at the Fort, and the Militia under Capt. Broaduax and Lieut. Adaroin, were permitted to leave for home. Col. Milton employed me to go to Fort Hawkins and bring a horse and some baggage left with Col Cook, which I did. On my return, I found the Colonel at Fort Ducatur. One the receipt of his horse and baggage, he gave me a very substantial Indian pony, and proposed to me to remain with him until he reached his regiment, the old 3d Infantry, then at Alabama Heights, under the command of Lieut. Col. Russell, and that he could procure me the appointment of Lieutenant in the army, to be attached to his regiment. I was not ambitious of military honors, and concluded to join the Indians. I had been paid for my services in the previous campaign, had a pony, and that was all I needed. I made up a mess with Sam Sells, John Winslet, Billy McIntosh, Joe Marshall, Sam Moniac and others, and went where it suited me. This gave me an orportunity of becoming acquainted with all the little hostile bands and their leaders. As I have described to you before how the most of them were situated after Gen. Jackson reached the fork of the two rivers, Coosa and Tallapoosa, it will not be necessary now to do so. Though Weatherford was still at Moniac's Island when I reached Gen. Jackson's camp, Tom Carr, or Tuskegee Emarthla, camp-up and learned through Moniac that Billy Weatherford could come in with safety, as Col. Hawkins had taken it upon himself to let the General know who and what he, Weatherford, was. I one day went out with Sucky Cornells and others to Cornell's old cow pens to see Jim Boy and Paddy Welch, who had been one of the principal leaders in the fight against Gen. Floyd. Welch was afterwards hanged near Claiborne, for killing a man by the name of Johnson, and another by the name of McCaskill or McCorkell. Jim Boy's camp was not far from Pole Cat Springs, on the Cubahatchy, and near where he built a little town after that which was called Thlopthlocco. On our return to camp, Watherford, Tom Carr, Otis Harjo, Catsa Harjo or Mad Tiger, a Coowersartda Chief, and a host of others had come in; so I missed hearing the great speech or seeing Ben Baldwin's white horse or the deer. The horse I never heard of, or him, until I found him in Col. Pickett's history of Alabama. There was a talk with the General and Weatherford and some Chiefs, and of course I did not hear it as I was not permitted to be at head quarters at that day, being looked upon as another Indian. But I think I know the purport of the talk as well as any one living or dead, for I knew both the men well, long after that, and have heard both of them talk it over; and I will give you, as near as I can, what I understood passed at their first interview. Gen. Jackson said to Weatherford, that he was astonished at a man of his good sense, and almost a white man, to take sides with an ignorant set of savages, and being led astray by men who professed to be prophets and gifted with a supernatural influence. And more than all, he had led the Indians and was one of the prime movers of the massacre at Fort Mimms. Weatherford listened attentively to the General until he was through. He then said to the General, that much had been charged to him that he was innocent of, and that he believed as little in Indian or white prophets as any man living, and that he regretted the unfortunate destruction of Fort Mimms and its inmates as much as he, the General, or any one else. He said it was true he was at Fort Mimms when the attack was made, and it was but a little while after the attack was made before the hostile Indians seemed inclined to abandon their undertaking; that those in the Fort, and particularly the half breeds under Dixon Bailey, poured such a deadly fire into their ranks as caused them to back out for a short time; at this stage of the fight he, Weatherford, advised them to draw off entirely. He then left to go some few miles to where his half brother, Davy Tate, had some negroes, to take charge of them, to keep the Indians from scattering them; after he left, the Indians succeeded in firing the Fort, and waited until it burnt so that they could enter it with but little danger. He also said to the General that if he had joined the whites it would have been attributed to cowardice and not thanked. And moreover, it was his object in joining the Indians, that he thought he would in many instances be able to prevent them from committing depredations upon defenseless persons; and but for the mismanagement of those that had charge of the Fort, he would have succeeded, and said, \"Now, sir, I have told the truth, if you think I deserve death, do as you please; I shall only beg for the protection of a starving pareel of woman and children, and those ignorant men who have been led into the war by their Chiefs.\" This is as much as I ever learned from the General, and I will proceed to give Weatherford's own statement, which I have often heard him make. But before I go further, I will here remark why I think the story of the white horse and deer have been played off on the credulity of Col. Pickett, as well as other things I see in his history that I know of my own knowledge, and so do others, to be incorrect. After it was known that Gen. Jackson would punish any one that was known to trouble an Indian coming to camp unarmed, and particularly Weatherford, the Indians were put to searching the country for something to eat, particularly those who had been lying out. Moniac was under the impression that he could find some cattle in the neighborhood of his cowpens, on the Pinchong creek. Several Indian countrymen and myself went with the Indians in search of the cattle,--Weatherford went with the crowd, and had to get a horse from Barney Riley, having none of his own; besides, had the exhibition of the white horse and deer been a reality, Major Eaton and others who made speeches for Weatherford would certainly have noticed it. It has been many years since I read what purported to be Weatherford's speech when he surrendered to Gen. Jackson; but if I recollect right, he was made to say that he would whip the Georgians on one side of the river and make his corn on the other. That was all a lie, and for effect. It reminds me of the report that the Kentuckians had arrived in the neighborhood of New Orleans, when the British made their attack. The Kentuckians were without arms-what could they do? All that can be said is, that it is easier to find a fighting man than a magnanimous one.\n\nI will go back to our cow hunt. At Moniac's cowpens we found no cattle, but killed plenty of deer and turkeys, and picked up the half brother of Jim Boy-George Goodwin.\n\nNow let us turn to Weatherford. He was a man of fine sense, great courage, and knew much about our government and mankind in general-had lived with his half brother, Davy Tate, who was an educated and well informed man-had been much with his brother-in-law, Sam Moniac, who was always looked upon as being one of the most intelligent half-breeds in the Nation, and was selected by Alexander MiGillivray for interpreter at the time he visited Gen. Washington at New York. Although it has been said that McGillivray mastered the Latin and Greek languages, and although the letters of Alexander Leslie are published to the world as McGillivray's productions, he [McG.] knew too well how matters stood, and relied on Moniac. He always kept it on his person, and it is with him in his grave at Pass Christian.\n\nSome time in April, 1814, on the West bank of the Pinchong, now in Montgomery county, Ala., and by a camp fire, I heard Weatherford relate the following particulars about the Creek war:\n\nHe said that some few years before the war, a white man came from Pensacola to Tuckabatchy. He remained some time with the Big Warrior. The white man was a European, and he thought a Scotchman; that he never knew the man's business, nor did he ever learn; that all the talks between this man and the Big Warrior were carried on through a negro interpreter that belonged to the Warrior; that he [Weatherford] had seen the man several times, and more than once the man asked how many warriors he thought the Creeks could raise. The man disappeared from the Nation, and in a short time Tuskenea, the oldest son of the Big Warrior, took a trip to the Wabash, and visited several tribes-the Shawnees or Sowanakas. (This trip Tuskenea did make, for I have often heard him speak of it, and have seen some women of the Hopungiesas and Shawnees that he carried to the Creek Nation.) Weatherford said that not long after the return of Tuskenea to the Creek Nation, Tecumseh, with the Prophet, Seekaboo, and others, made their appearance at the Tuckabatchy town. A talk was put out by the Warrior. Moniac and Weatherford attended the talk. No white man was allowed to be present. Tecumseh stated the object of his mission; that if it could be effected, the Creeks could recover all the country that the whites had taken from them, and that the British would protect them in their right. Moniac was the first to oppose Tecumseh's talk, and said that the talk was a bad one, and that he [Tecumseh] had better leave the Nation. The Big Warrior seemed inclined to take the talk. The correspondence was carried on through Seekaboo, who spoke English. After Moniac had closed, Weatherford then said to Seekaboo to say to Tecumseh, that the whites and Indians were at peace, and had been for years; that the Creek Indians were doing well, and that it would be bad policy for the Creeks, at least, to take sides either with the Americans or English, in the event of a war-(this was in 1811.) Besides, he said, that when the English had sway over the country, they were equally as oppressive as the Americans had been, if not more so; and in the American revolution the Americans were but few, and that they had got the better of the English; and that they were now very strong, and if interest was to be consulted, the Indians had better join the Americans.\n\nAfter this talk Tecumseh left for home, and prevailed on Seekaboo and one or two others to remain among the Creeks.\n\nIn 1812 the Indians killed Arthur Lott and Thomas Meridith, which I before mentioned, as well as Captain Isaacs' going with the Little Warrior to the mouth of Duck river. After this matters calmed down until the opening of 1813. Moniac and Weatherford took a trip to the Chickasawha in Mississippi Territory, trading in beef cattle. On their return, they found that several chiefs has assembled at a place that was afterwards settled by one Townsend Robinson, from Anson county, N. C. They were taking the Ussa, or black drink, and had Moniac's and Weatherford's families at the square. They told Moniac and Weatherford that they should join or be put to death. Moniac boldly refused, and mounted his horse. Josiah Francis, his brother-in-law, seized his bridle; Moniac snatched a war-club from his hand, gave him a severe blow and put out, with a shower of rifle bullets following him. Weatherford consented to remain. He told them that he disapprobated their course, and that it would be their ruin; but they were his people-he was raised with them, and he would share their fate. He was no chief, but had much influence with the Indians. He was always called by the Indian Billy Larny, or Yellow Billy; that was his boy name. His other name was Hoponika Futsahia. Hoponika Futsahia, as nigh as I can give the English of it, is a truth-maker-and he was all of that.\n\nHe then proposed to the Indians to collect up all such as intended going to war with the whites; take their women and children into the swamps of Florida; leave the old men and lads to hunt for them, and the picked warriors to collect together and operate whenever it was thought best. He said that he had several reasons for making this proposition to the Alabama river Indians; one was, that he thought by the time they could take their women and children to Florida and return, that the upper towns, which were almost to a man hostile, --except the Netches and Hillabys-and were principally controlled by the Ocfuske chief, Menauway, or Ogillis Ineha, or Fat Englishman;--(these were the names of the noted men who headed the Indians at Horse Shoe,)-that they perhaps would come to terms, and by that means his people would be spared and not so badly broken up, and would be the means of saving the lives of many whites on the thinly settled frontiers; and if the worst came to the worst, that they could carry on the war with less trouble, less danger, and less expense, than to be troubled with their women and children.\n\nBut in all this he was overruled by the chiefs. Some of their names I will give you. The oldest and principal chief, the one looked upon as the General, was a Tuskegee, called Hopie Tustanugga, or Far-off-Warrior; he was killed at Fort Mims. The others were Peter McQueen, Jim Boy, or High-head Jim, Illes Harjo, or Josiah Francis, the new made Prophet, the Otisee chief, Nehemarthla-Micco, Paddy Welch, Hossa Yoholo, and Seekaboo, the Shawnee Prophet, and many others I could name.\n\nThe first thing to be had was ammunition. Peter McQueen, with Him Boy as his war chief, with a party of Indians, started for Pensacola-(their numbers have been greatly overrated.) On their route, at Burnt Corn Springs, they took Betsy Coulter, the wife of Jim Cornells,--(not Alexander Cornells, who was the Government interpreter;) they carried her to Pensacola, and sold her to a French lady, a madame Barrone. At Pensacola they met up with Zach McGirth, and some of them wanted to kill him. Jim Boy interfered, and said that the man or men who harmed McGirth should die.\n\nNow, recollect, I lived with these people long, and have heard these things over and over. Betsy Coulter lived with me for years, as well as others, who bore their parts on one side or the other. This is history-it is as true as Gospel-for I am now and was then a living witness to much of it, and have seen the others who witnessed the balance-and the witnesses to the other have been dead a long time; and besides, what I have seen and write is nothing more than what is and has been common.\n\nBut on the return of McQueen's party from Pensacola, the fight took place at Burnt Corn creek between the Indians and at least three times their number of white men; that is, if we take the statements of the two commanders, Col. Collier and Jim Boy. Jim Boy said the war had not fairly broke out, and that they never thought of being attacked; that he did not start with a hundred men, and all of those he did start with were not in the fight. I have heard Jim tell it often, that if the whites had not stopped to gather up pack horses and plunder their camp, and had pursued the Indians a little further, they [the Indians] would have quit and gone off. But the Indians discovered the very great disorder the whites were in, searching for plunder, and they fired a few guns from the creek swamp and a general stampede was the result. McGirth always corroborated Jim Boy's statement as to the number of Indians in the Burnt Corn fight. I have seen many of those that were in the fight, and they were like the militia that were at Bladensburg-they died off soon; you never could hear much talk about the battle, unless you met with such a man as Judge Lipscomb, who used to make a laughing matter of it.\n\nEnough of the Burnt Corn battle now. A part of the Indians returned to Pensacola, and some went to the Nation. So soon as those who had gone back the second time to Pensacola returned, they commenced fitting out an expedition to Fort Mims. Weatherford said that he delayed them as much as possible on their march, in order that those in the Fort might be prepared. They took several negroes on the route, and it was made convenient to let them escape; that he had understood that an officer with some troops had reached Fort Mims, and had quite a strong force, but had no expectation of taking it whatever, until the morning they got within view of the Fort; that he was close enough to the Fort to recognize Jim Cornells-saw him as he rode up to the Fort and rode off. I have seen Cornells often since and heard him tell it; he rode to the Fort and told Maj. Beasley that he had seen some Indians, and that the Fort would be attacked that day. Maj. Beasley was drunk; he said to Cornells that he had only seen a gang of red cattle. Cornells told the Major that that gang of red cattle would give him a h-ll of a kick before night. As Cornells rode off, Zach McGirth followed him out, and went to the boat yard; they were looking for a provision boat up, and while McGirth was out the boat was attacked; that is the way he escaped. The Fort gate was open and could not be shut, and a number of the Indians followed a Shawnee (not Seekaboo) who pretended to be a Prophet; he was feathered from top to toe. Dixon Bailey ran up within a few yards of him and placed the Prophet where even the Witch of Endor could not reach him. Some of the Prophet's followers being served in the same way, the rest left the Fort. This I learned from McGirth, Sam Smith and others who were saved and escaped from the Fort, as well as from Jim Boy, Weatherford and others who were engaged in the assault.\n\nThe Indians then pretty well ceased operations, and Weatherford, as I have remarked before, left and went off to take charge of his brother's negroes. After he left, the Sawnee, Seekaboo, and some of the McGillivray negroes got behind some logs that were near the Fort, kindled a fire, and, by putting rags on their arrows and setting them on fire, would shoot them into the roof of Mim's smoke-house, which was an old building, and formed a part of one line of the Fort. It took fire and communicated it to the other buildings-and that is the way Fort Mims was destroyed.\n\nJim Boy succeeded in saving Mrs. McGirth and her daughter, but her only son, James, was killed. Weatherford's taking charge of Tate's negroes gave rise to the report by some whites that there was an understanding between him and Tate that one was to remain with the whites, and the other with the Indians. The report was, no doubt, false, but it ever after caused Tate to be very reserved with most people. I knew Tate well. He, like Weatherford, was an honest man; but many have done him great injustice.\n\nAfter the Fort fell, and Jim Boy saved Mrs. McGirth and tried to save others, the Indians ran him off, and it was some time before they would be reconciled to him. After plundering the Fort, they scattered in various directions and made their way back to the Nation, except a few.\n\nThe Indians expected after this that the whites would pour into the Nation from all quarters, and most of them that were at Fort Mims returned to where Robinson had a plantation afterwards, and the place that Moniac had escaped from. The reason why they selected that place was, that there was on the North side of the river Nocoshatchy, or Bear creek, that which afforded the most impenetrable swamps in the whole country. But the movements of the whites were so slow that the Indians grew careless, and a few Indians, with Weatherford and the chief, Hossa Yoholo, and one of two others, made what has been known as the Holy Ground their head-quarters. Some time in December, Gen. Claiborne, piloted by Sam Moniac and an old McGillivray negro, got near the place before the Indians discovered them. The Indians began to cross their wives and children over the river; they had scarcely time to do that before the army arrived-a skirmish ensued, and the Indians, losing a few men, gave way in every direction. Weatherford was among the last to quit the place. He made an attempt to go down the river-that is, down the bank of the river-but found that the soldiers would intercept his passage, and he turned up, keeping on the bluff near the river, until he reached the ravine or little branch that makes into the river above where the town used to be. There was a small foot-path that crossed the ravine near the river; he carried his horse down that path, and instead of going out of the ravine at the usual crossing, he kept up it towards its head, until he passed the lines of the whites. So, now you have the bluff-jumping story.\n\nThis story was told long before Weatherford died. Maj. Cowles and myself asked him how that report got out. He said Sam Moniac knew him, and seeing him on horse back on the brink of the bluff, and his disappearing so suddenly, caused those who saw him to believe that he had gone over the bluff. He said that he ran a greater risk in going the way he did, than he would to have gone over the bluff; and but for his horse he would have gone over it and crossed the river. But it was to save his pony that he risked passing between two lines of the whites.

He fell in with Savannah or Sowanoka Jack, and they consulted together as to what was best. Jack proposed to get as many of their people as they could; that in a few years the whites would entirely s"
