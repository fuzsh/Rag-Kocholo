        "text": "Love Actually is synonymous with Christmas time. Many of us just have to watch the 2003 classic festive film every year or it doesn't feel the same.\n\nThe movie was written and directed by Richard Curtis, and received mixed reviews from critics, but despite this it has become a modern day must-watch at Christmas.\n\nRecently, Diane Sawyer hosted an ABC special called The Laughter & Secrets of Love Actually: 20 Years Later, where she caught up with some of the stars of the film.\n\nThe movie starred incredibly successful actors and actresses who are still active today – from Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley to Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Bill Nighty.\n\nBut what happened to the other actors who starred in the romantic comedy?
