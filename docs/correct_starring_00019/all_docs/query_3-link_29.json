        "text": "'Love Actually' launched new stars, eventually\n\nWhen it was released in 2003, the romantic comedy Love Actually featured some of the biggest names in Hollywood of the day, including Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley.\n\nBut as it turns 10 this month and celebrates with the release of anniversary editions in Blue-ray and DVD, the film is serving as a time capsule for a second wave of stars who are making an impact now, including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Martin Freeman, Andrew Lincoln and January Jones.\n\n\"It's funny how the nature of the casting has changed,\" says writer-director Richard Curtis. \"When we first did it, it was sort of 50% of people you knew and 50% people you didn't know. But now the naked guy in the movie is the Hobbit,'' he says, referring to Freeman's starring role as Bilbo Baggins in the Hobbit franchise. \"It kind of looks strangely over-cast now.\"\n\nLincoln, who won the role of Mark, recalls that he, Ejiofor and Bill Nighy all performed in an English National Theatre play just before being cast in Love.\n\n\"I think Richard had seen the production and said 'Those three, get them in here,' \" says Lincoln, who stars as Rick Grimes in AMC's The Walking Dead. \"There's been maybe three roles in my career that have made me dance and bounce off walls when I got them. And Love Actually is definitely one of them.\"\n\nLincoln says he still is asked about his silent, but respectfully romantic tribute to his best friend's wife, which became an instant classic. \"There was no acting required,'' he says. \"I just had to show up at the door. Perfect.''\n\nLove opened doors for many of his then-emerging co-stars as well, including:\n\n- Chiwetel Ejiofor (Peter). Onscreen, Lincoln might have been secretly in love with Ejiofor's wife Juliet (Knightley), but today he's outwardly effusive about Ejiofor, who is generating awards buzz for his lead role in 12 Years a Slave. \"Chiwetel has been out here doing astonishing work. But it's almost like you just discovered him,\" says Lincoln.\n\n• January Jones (Jeannie). A bevy of Wisconsin beauties fell for goofy Brit Colin (Kris Marshall), including Elisha Cuthbert (who later co-starred in TV's 24), Ivana Milicevic (TV's Banshee) and Jones (Mad Men's Betty Draper).\n\n\"We just cracked up all day playing around with ridiculous ideas and lines to flirt with the Colin character,\" recalls Jones. \"This movie is one of the films I'm most asked about and I was barely in it. It's a testament to the film and how many people it touched.\"\n\n•Thomas Brodie-Sangster (Sam). Playing Liam Neeson's stepson and a romantic moppetmuppet in love, the actor, then 13, fell hard for a school classmate. He is now vying for power as Jojen Reed in HBO's Game of Thrones.\n\n• Martin Freeman (John).Freeman already was a well-respected star in the U.K. (thanks to the British version of The Office) when he starred in Love as the mostly-nude stand-in for a porn flick shoot. He returns to his Baggins role in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (out Dec. 13).\"He's hobbiting around the world,\" says Lincoln, \"and it's brilliant.\"'\n\n• Bill Nighy (Billy Mack). In Love, Nighy's aging, outrageous rocker scored the No. 1 single for the holidays, and Nighy himself nearly stole the movie himself. He re-teamed with Curtis as an eccentric father in the just-released romantic comedy About Time, in which he plays a where the character who is is closer to his true personality. \"The rocker is the man Bill might have been if Bill had not got a grip,\" says Curtis.\n\nLooking back at the film, which has become a holiday staple, Lincoln realizes that \"there were brilliant roles for all of us. It's the perfect story. And now I'm over here killing zombies.\""
