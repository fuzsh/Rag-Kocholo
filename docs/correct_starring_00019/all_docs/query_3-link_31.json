Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all remember Liam Neeson played the newly widowed character Daniel.\n\nDaniel's wife had recently died after battling an illness.\n\nNeeson went on to portray a man with a very special set of skills in \"Taken\" (and in its two sequels), as well as dozens of other notable roles.\n\nMore recently, Neeson has starred in the 2018 crime drama \"Widows\" and 2020's \"Honest Thief.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Love Actually,\" Neeson's character had a young stepson named Sam.\n\nActor Thomas Brodie-Sangster played Sam when he was 13 years old.\n\nThomas Brodie-Sangster went on to voice Ferb Fletcher in Disney's \"Phineas and Ferb,\" but most will recognize him in 2020 as Benny Watts in Netflix's \"The Queen's Gambit.\"\n\nBrodie-Sangster also costarred as Jojen Reed on \"Game of Thrones\" during seasons three and four, and had a role in the \"Maze Runner\" movie series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSam's school crush in the movie is an American girl named Joanna.\n\nJoanna sang an unforgettable rendition of \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\" at her school's holiday performance.\n\nOlivia Olson went on to costar in the animated series \"Phineas and Ferb,\" as well as in Cartoon Network's \"Adventure Time.\"\n\nShe's done other voice-acting work in \"The Powerpuff Girls\" series, and in the 2020 \"Phineas and Ferb\" movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only other American character was Sarah.\n\nSarah worked at a design firm and harbors a not-so-secret obsession with her coworker Karl.\n\nLaura Linney starred in horror movie \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" in 2005, and now you can watch her in the Netflix drama series \"Ozark.\"\n\nLinney also had supporting roles in the 2016 movies \"Sully\" and \"Nocturnal Animals,\" as well as Netflix's 2019 TV show \"Tales of the City.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSarah's memorable love interest in the movie was Karl, played by Rodrigo Santoro.\n\nTry as he might, Karl couldn't convince Sarah to break her commitment to her family so they could spend more time together.\n\nRodrigo Santoro drastically switched up his look to play the god-king Xerxes in both \"300\" movies, but was more recognizable as Hector Escaton in HBO's \"Westworld.\"\n\nSo far Santoro's \"Westworld\" character has appeared in all three seasons, and fans will have to wait and see if he'll return for the coming fourth installment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSarah and Karl's boss was Harry, a wry man who had an emotional affair with his secretary.\n\nHarry was played by the late Alan Rickman.\n\nAlan Rickman died in early 2016 after a cancer diagnosis.\n\nHis most memorable roles in the years after \"Love Actually\" were Severus Snape in the \"Harry Potter\" movie franchise and Judge Turpin in \"Sweeney Todd.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmma Thompson was cast as Karen, Harry's charming wife.\n\nHarry spends most of \"Love Actually\" emotionally cheating on Karen, much to her devastation when she finds out.\n\nThompson voiced Mrs. Potts in the 2017 \"Beauty and the Beast\" live-action remake,\n\nLike Rickman, she also played a Hogwarts schoolteacher in the \"Harry Potter\" movies (Sybil Trelawney), costarred in the HBO miniseries \"Years and Years,\" and wrote the 2019 holiday rom-com \"Last Christmas.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ex-drug addict rock star character Billy Mack helped put some raunchiness into \"Love Actually.\"\n\nThroughout \"Love Actually,\" Billy was on a mission to get his new song to the #1 spot on the music charts.\n\nBill Nighy is yet another \"Harry Potter\" alumni — he played Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour.\n\nHe also voices a character in the \"Castlevania\" TV series, and costarred in the 2019 movie \"Pokémon: Detective Pikachu.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother small character who ramped up the R-rating factor was John — a nude body double working on a movie set.\n\nJohn was a stand-in for a famous actor's sex scenes, where he met a new girlfriend named Judy.\n\nMartin Freeman had far less nudity involved in his roles as Bilbo Baggins for \"The Hobbit\" franchise and Dr. John Watson in \"Sherlock.\"\n\nFreeman is also now part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, playing Everett K.
