        "text": "Rowan Atkinson (born January 6, 1955, Newcastle upon Tyne, England) is a British actor and comedian who delighted television and film audiences with his comic creation Mr. Bean.\n\nAtkinson, the son of wealthy Durham farmers, attended Durham Cathedral Choristers’ School. At the University of Newcastle upon Tyne he studied electrical engineering; he progressed to the University of Oxford for a master’s degree. Taking to the stage to satisfy an inner urge, he began honing the facial contortions and manic comedic genius that would soon make him famous. While attending Oxford, he began working with actor Richard Curtis and composer Howard Goodall, and together they ventured to the Edinburgh Festival. There Atkinson’s classic schoolmaster sketch rocketed him to fame. In 1979 the satirical television show Not the Nine O’Clock News introduced him to millions of British viewers, and in 1981 he became the youngest person at the time to have had a one-man show in London’s West End.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nIn 1983 the first installment of Blackadder, written by Atkinson and Curtis, slithered onto British TV screens. The show featured the twisted relationship between four incarnations of the groveling, spineless Lord Blackadder and his foully fleshed retainer, Baldrick, as they cajoled their way through history from the Crusades to the end of World War I. The series established Atkinson as one of England’s finest comic actors. It also led to the television program Mr. Bean (1990–95), which starred the rubber-faced Atkinson as a pratfalling, nearly mute buffoon, bumbling his way through everyday situations made comedic by his clumsiness and scheming. Transcending both the traditional boundaries of English humour and the verbal repartee of Blackadder, the working-class Bean attracted millions of devotees. Atkinson acknowledged the influence of French film actor Jacques Tati in the creation of the role: Tati’s recurring character Monsieur Hulot displayed a similarly wordless comic ineptitude in his films of the mid-20th century. Mr. Bean won the 1990 Montreux Festival Golden Rose, a 1991 International Emmy for best popular arts program, and a 1994 American Cable Ace Award. At its peak it was British television’s most popular comedy, drawing some 18 million viewers. In 1996 the show made the transatlantic jump to American television, and in 1997 Mr. Bean hit the big screen in the motion picture Bean and later Mr. Bean’s Holiday (2007), in which the eponymous antihero takes on France. The character also inspired an animated television series in 2002.\n\nMeanwhile Atkinson appeared as Police Inspector Raymond Fowler in the television series The Thin Blue Line (1995–96). His other film credits included The Witches (1990, based on Roald Dahl’s book); Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994); Rat Race (2001); and Johnny English (2003), a spy spoof that spawned two sequels, Johnny English Reborn (2011) and Johnny English Strikes Again (2018). He also appeared in the popular romantic comedy Love Actually (2003)."
