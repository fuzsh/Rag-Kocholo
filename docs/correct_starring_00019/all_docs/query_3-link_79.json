on to star in some of the biggest films and TV shows and he is even engaged.\n\nWho is Thomas Brodie-Sangster?\n\nThomas Brodie-Sangster was born on May 16, 1990.\n\nThe English actor has already left his mark on a number of world-famous movies and TV shows - most notably Love Actually.\n\nThomas played adorable drummer Sam, who was madly in love with his classmate at school, an American schoolgirl called Joanna.\n\nThe London-based star has acting in his blood.\n\nHis mum Anastasia \"Tasha\" Bertram has starred in London's Burning, Stig Of The Dump, and Marple.\n\nDad Mark Sangster is an editor who has worked on TV shows Goodnight Sweetheart, My Hero, and Taskmaster.\n\nThomas is also linked to one of his Love Actually co-stars, Hugh Grant, who is his second cousin, once removed.\n\nAs well

reward.\n\nThere were also some tear-jerking moments between Sam and father Daniel, as the pair struggle to come to terms with the loss of Sam’s mother.\n\nHe made a return in 2017 for Red Nose Day

across England and Wales.\n\nWhat else has Thomas Brodie-Sangster been in?\n\nAfter Love Actually, Thomas starred as Simon Brown in Nanny McPhee in 2005.\n\nHe played young Tristan in 2006 film Tristan + Isolde, and was Donald Clarke in Death Of A Superhero in 2011.\n\nIn 2009, he appeared in director Jane Campion's Bright Star, a romantic tale depicting the relationship between poet John Keats and his beloved Fanny Brawne.\n\nThe same year he was hailed for his portrayal of Paul McCartney in Nowhere Boy, a cinematic exploration of John Lennon's adolescence directed by the acclaimed artist Sam Taylor-Wood.\n\nHe also played Newt in the Maze Runner franchise and has also been an officer in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\n\nHis role in Maze Runner: The Scorch Trails won him a Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie: Chemistry, which he shared with Dylan O’Brien.\n\nIn 2017, Thomas took on the role of Whitey Winn in the Netflix western drama miniseries Godless, crafted by Scott

follow-up, St Trinian's: The Legend Of Fritton's Gold.\n\nShe had a brief cameo in Christopher Nolan’s epic 2020 film Inception and played greeter Angela in the sci-fi series Westworld.\n\nSensationally the Hertfordshire-born star twice married billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nThey began dating in 2008 and married for the first time in 2010.\n\nIn July 2013, the couple remarried and stated they were living with Musk's five children from his first marriage to writer Justine Musk.\n\nThe divorce was finalised in October 2016.\n\nReports suggest that Talulah and Thomas have been
