        "text": "Love Actually officially turns 20 today, which means it has been 20 years since we first saw Hugh Grant dancing to Girls Aloud around 10 Downing Street – while also sobbing as Alan Rickman handed Emma Thompson another Joni Mitchell CD.\n\nThe Richard Curtis flick, also starring Keira Knightley, Andrew Lincoln, Bill Nighy, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson and Martine McCutcheon, first hit the big screen on November 14, 2003, and has remained a Christmas staple ever since.\n\nLet’s be honest, is it really the festive period until Rowan Atkinson has spent an alarming amount of time wrapping presents? Absolutely not.\n\nHowever, it’s fair to say that a lot has changed since the release and casting director Fiona Weir, who worked alongside the late Mary Selway on the movie, opened up about how they would portray the differences in the present day.\n\n‘The first thing is I would cast a female prime minister,’ she told Metro.co.uk when asked who would make the cut if Love Actually was released now.\n\n‘I think if we were doing it today, Richard would write it very differently. 20 years on, it’s a different country, it’s a different world, a lot has changed.\n\n‘So, I think it will be a very different script, you can’t really sort of transpose actors on it. But the one thing I can declare is that we would definitely, definitely cast a female prime minister.\n\n‘Adjoa Andoh would be brilliant. I think she’d be wonderful.’\n\nSeeing how effortlessly Adjoa rules the world as Lady Agatha Danbury in Bridgerton, we would definitely be on board with this.\n\nRichard has previously opened up about his biggest regrets while behind the camera on Love Actually, sharing that the ‘lack of diversity’ made him feel ‘uncomfortable and a bit stupid’.\n\nHe also voiced his remorse over ‘jokes’ at the expense of Martine’s character’s weight, as Natalie was described as ‘plumpy’ with ‘huge thighs’ throughout.\n\nWhen asked how she believes the film has held up over the last two decades, Fiona agreed that certain lines wouldn’t be included today, but praised the overall timelessness of the majority of the material.\n\n‘Of course, there’s a couple of things in it, which I would rather weren’t,’ she continued. ‘There’s a certain comment about Martine McCutcheon’s physicality which Richard himself would say, he’d wished that wasn’t in there.\n\n‘It was something that he felt was humorous at the time, but now realizes it’s not appropriate. I think that is obviously the case.\n\n‘But where it does hold up is that the emotion in it is completely authentic. As it says, love is all around, it’s not always seen. All the characters, they’re wonderful actors.\n\n‘Nothing is sent up, it’s not cynical in any way. It’s joyous and celebratory. I think that’s why it holds up, because it was done with a complete lack of cynicism, which is Richard.\n\n‘Richard is completely without cynicism.’\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Train company looking for drivers to navigate famous Harry Potter route\n\nMORE : Richard Curtis admits he’s ‘uncomfortable’ by lack of diversity in Love Actually: ‘Feel a bit stupid’"
