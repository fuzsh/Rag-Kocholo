        "text": "Director: Oliver Parker\n\nStarring: Rowan Atkinson, Gillian Anderson, Dominic West, Rosamund Pike\n\nProduction Company: StudioCanal, Relativity Media, Working Title Films\n\nKent Filming Locations: The A299 carriageway and Cliffs End, Ramsgate.\n\nReleased in cinemas from October 7th, Johnny English Reborn sees M17’s deadliest secret agent in his latest adventure. After a failed mission, Johnny English retreated from service to hone his skills in a remote region of Asia. But when a plot to kill the Chinese premier is discovered, the agency must track down the only man who can stop it… Johnny English.\n\nAs the clock counts down to a Heads of State conference, high-tech gadgets and the improbable skills of English reveal that the layers of conspiracy are far reaching: all the way back to MI7.\n\nAs always, Johnny English goes to show that a “little intelligence goes a long way”.\n\nRowan Atkinson (Love Actually, Bean) returns as the haphazard Johnny English with a supporting cast including Gillian Anderson (The X Files, The Last King of Scotland), Dominic West (300, The Wire) and Rosamund Pike (Jack Reacher, Die Another Day).\n\nThe A299 carriageway, that runs from Faversham to Ramsgate was used to film a high speed car chase. This was made possible by the introduction of the KCC (filming on Highways) Act 2010, which allows Kent County Council to effect road closure to facilitate filming.\n\nCliff’s End in Ramsgate was also used as a filming location. Ramsgate is a popular coastal filming location for the county and home to the only “Royal” harbour in the country. Ramsgate has previously been seen in comedy series Not Going Out (2013), drama Hancock and Joan (2008) and the independent film Gypo (2006).\n\nJohnny English Reborn was released in cinemas in October 2011 and is now available on DVD.\n\nFor more information about Kent’s Filming History please visit our Movie Map.\n\nDirected By: Peter Howitt\n\nWritten By: Neal Purvis, Robert Wade & William Davis\n\nStarring: Rowan Atkinson, Ben Miller, Natalie Imbruglia and John Malkovich\n\nProduction Company: Universal Pictures,StudioCanal,Working Title Films\n\nKent Locations Used: A2 Carriageway (leading to Jubilee Way) and the Port of Dover\n\nAfter an unexpected bomb attack on the MI5, incompetent spy Johnny English is the only agent left alive when the crown jewels are stolen. English and his sidekick Bough (Ben Miller) are assigned to the case. For English, the prime suspect is mysterious French Entrepreneur Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich). They soon learn the horrifying plan behind the theft, for Sauvage intends to wear them when he is crowned King of England.\n\nThe film is directed by Peter Howitt (Sliding Doors, Antitrust) and written by writing duo Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (SS-GB, Spectre), who met at University of Kent alongside William Davis (Puss in Boots, Ignition).\n\nRowan Atkinson (Bean, The Lion King) takes the feature role with a supporting cast of Ben Miller (Death in Paradise, The Armstrong and Miller Show), Natalie Imbruglia (Neighbours, Closed for Winter) and John Malkovich (RED, Dangerous Liaisons).\n\nJohnny English soon meets Interpol Agent, Lorna Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia). After his case is taken away from him, she tracks him down and together they vow to stop Sauvage’s plan. As English and Campbell race to France they drive down the familiar A2 carriageway leading to Jubilee Way. Kent’s brief cameo continues as we see the car drive down Marine Parade past the sign for the Port of Dover.\n\nThe cameras would not have been a strange sight to local Dover residents. The town and surrounding landmarks have played host to many productions over the years. The famous Dover Castle alone has starred in many feature films. The site can be seen replicating another iconic British landmark like the Tower of London in the films Lady Jane (1987) and The Other Boleyn Girl (2008).\n\nJohnny English is not the only spy to have visited the Port of Dover. In the famous 1971 film Diamonds Are Forever (1971), Sean Connery stars as the suave spy 007. The Port makes its appearance as 007 foils diamond smuggler Peter Franks and boards a hovercraft bound for Amsterdam.\n\nJohnny English was released in cinemas in April 2003 and can now be purchased on DVD.\n\nFor more information about Kent’s Filming History please visit our Movie Map."
