        "text": "And now, Rowan Atkinson has been spotted reprising his iconic role as pushy salesman Rufus for the reboot.\n\nHis character is best known for his hilarious present-wrapping scene, which saw him go over the top with the decoration on Harry's (played by Alan Rickman) gift.\n\nWhen Harry went to buy an expensive piece of jewellery for a work colleague, he was confronted by the salesman who insisted on going that extra mile to ensure that it looked fabulous.\n\nHarry tried to rush Rufus along but he was forced to watch on as the item was placed in a box and a bag as well as sprinkled with sequins, a cinnamon stick and a sprig of holly.\n\nOnce again, the 62-year-old was back behind a counter and doing what Rufus does best - wielding a role of gift wrap.\n\nRowan was seen filming in a West London supermarket and he appeared to be thrilled to be shooting as Rufus again.\n\nThere was a slight change in his storyline however as he was spotted wrapping up Red Noses instead of diamond necklaces.\n\nCo-writer Richard Curtis could be seen deep in conversation with the actor as they prepared for the shoot in a behind-the-scenes shot posted on social media by his wife Emma Freud.\n\nIt comes after it was revealed that there were no plans for a tribute to Alan Rickman to be included in the Comic Relief sequel.\n\nHe said that his character was \"very complicated\" and ruled out an appearance by Emma Thompson.\n\nComic Relief will air on March 24 on BBC One."
