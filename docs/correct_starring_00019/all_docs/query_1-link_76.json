I remember that I thought it’s a new Mr. Bean flick because the only thing I knew before was that Rowan Atkinson is in it. 😃\nSo I was quite surprised by this funny (and sad!) romcom that would become one of my favorite Christmas movies with a guaranteed annual rewatch. 🍿\nThis year now I’ll watch it for the 21st time and I think I might see it in Spanish or French for the sake of variety. 😉\n\nDo you remember how many times you have you watched it❓\n\nLocations shown here:\n\n🎬 Grosvenor Chapel, South Audley Street\n\n🎬 10 Downing Street \n\nThere’s no public access to 10 Downing Street, home to the British Prime Minister, and this scene with Hugh Grant was actually filmed on the studio lot. But there are two real lookalike locations in London often used as a Stand-In: 8 John Adam Street (seen in BBC’s “Bodyguard”) and 10 Adam Street (as used for the ”The Iron Lady) where I also took this pic. \n\n🎬 St Luke Mews, Notting Hill\n\n#loveactually #london #visitlondon #christmasmovie\n#setjetting #filmlocation #movielocation #filmtourism #filmtourist #filminglocation\".",
