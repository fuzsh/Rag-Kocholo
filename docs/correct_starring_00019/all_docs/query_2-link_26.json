        "text": "We're surprised too...\n\nEveryone knows that the true meaning of Christmas is sitting down to watch Love Actually - and, if you're the cynical type, to pick many holes in the many plots of the iconic Crimbo film.\n\nWhile you may know the ins and outs of Richard Curtis' phenomenally festive ensemble drama (face it, you can probably recite Hugh Grant's airport voiceover. And his prime ministerial speech...), these behind-the-scenes facts will certainly enlighten your future viewings. Grab a roll neck and some A2 paper, it's time to revisit some of this Christmas classic's lesser-known tidbits...\n\nGallery\n\n37 Things You Definitely Didn't Know About Love Actually\n\n1 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n1. Thomas Brodie Sangster (Sam) had to learn how to play the drums for the role\n\nWe call this dedication. Luckily, his dad plays drums and was able to teach him. Pretty handy if you ask us! Thomas still plays the drums even now - which is all the proof you need that Love Actually is for life, not just for Christmas.\n\n2 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n2. Bill Nighy didn't realise that he was auditioning to play ageing rocker Billy Mack\n\nOn the film's tenth anniversary, Nighy told The Daily Beast, 'I did a rehearsal reading of the script as a favour to the great casting director, Mary Selway, who had been trying to get me into a film for a long time. I thought it was simply to help her hear the script aloud and to my genuine surprise I was given the job.' Frankly, we can't picture a Love Actually universe that doesn't include Bill.\n\n3 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n3. His Christmas single was recorded in Abbey Road Studios\n\nMeaning that he was in pretty good company. We wonder if any famous faces jumped in on his 'festering turd of a record' (Billy's words, not ours).\n\n4 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n4. Richard Curtis previously had two other actors in mind for Nighy's character\n\nDifficult to believe though it may now be, Nighy wasn't a dead cert for Billy Mack - though Curtis has refused to reveal who the other contenders were, joking that he'll 'put it in [his] will.'\n\n5 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n5. The footage in the airport scenes that bookend the film is real\n\nThe camera crew set up at Heathrow airport and filmed friends and family reuniting over the course of a week. And the tears just keep on coming...\n\n6 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n6. There were initially 14 storylines planned for the film, but â€“ unsurprisingly â€“ it ended up feeling too confusing\n\nTwo of them were cut â€“ including one same-sex love story, and another featuring an African couple. Last year, Director Richard Curtis opened up about his regrets with the film, saying 'the lack of diversity makes me feel uncomfortable and a bit stupid.'\n\n7 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n7. When Sugababesâ€™ 'Too Lost In Youâ€™ is played in the UK version of the film, American audiences hear The Trouble With Love Is by Kelly Clarkson instead\n\nOur deepest sympathies go to American fans of Love Actually, who have been missing out on what is undisputedly the best Sugababes song for all these years. During those ever-so emosh scenes, US audiences are treated to a lil bit of Kelly Clarkson.\n\n8 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n8. Hugh Grant and Thomas Brodie Sangster are second cousins\n\nIt's a family affair! Their great-grandmothers were actually sisters (meaning they share a great great-grandmother). 'He'd call me cousin and ruffle my hair,' Sangster recalled to The Telegraph.\n\n9 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n9. The 'lakeâ€™ which Jamie (Colin Firth) and Aurelia (Lucia Moniz) jump into to save the manuscript was only 18 inches deep\n\nRewatching this scene brings a whole new level of awks as we imagine was was really going on beneath the surface. The two actors had to shuffle on their knees to pretend they were swimming, and Firth ended up being bitten badly by a mosquito, causing his elbow to swell to the size of 'an avocado.' This would never have happened to Mr Darcy.\n\n10 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n10. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair ended up referencing Hugh Grant's Love Actually speech in a very meta moment\n\nAlluding to the scene where Grant's character stands up to the President (played by Billy Bob Thornton) with a speech that references everything from Harry Potter to David Beckham's right foot, Blair said, 'I know there's a bit of us that would like me to do a Hugh Grant in Love Actually and tell America where to get off. But the difference between a good film and real life is that in real life, there's the next day, the next year, the next lifetime to contemplate the ruinous consequences of easy applause.' There's definitely an undergraduate dissertation title hidden in there somewhere. If anything, we're taking great joy from knowing Tony sat down to watch this masterpiece.\n\n11 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n11. Curtisâ€™ daughter Scarlett appears as one of the lobsters in the school Christmas play\n\nBecause, as we all know, there was more than one lobster present at the birth of Jesus Christ. His son also pops up as the wise man with Spiderman face paint. Keep your eyes peeled!\n\n12 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n12. That wasn't the only time that Curtis and his partner, screenwriter Emma Freud, called upon friends and family to appear in the film\n\nThe Downing Street housekeeper who greets the PM on his arrival is Freud's mother, while the music industry crowd at Billy Mack's party consists of the couple's friends. What good are some schmoozy industry connections if they can't bag you a part?\n\n13 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n13. The awkward scene with Kris Marshall and the wedding caterer wasn't originally written for Love Actually\n\nIt was actually taken from the script for an earlier Richard Curtis vehicle, Four Weddings and a Funeral, with Hugh Grant intended to speak Marshall's lines. It was cut from the final version of the 1994 film, leaving Curtis to repurpose it further down the line.\n\n14 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n14. Colin Firth's character name is a dig at Richard Curtisâ€™ brother, Jamie\n\nHe later explained that Firth's character took his brother's name so that the disgruntled kids could say 'I hate Uncle Jamie.' Classic sibling behaviour, if you ask us...\n\n15 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n15. Curtis always wanted Hugh Grant as the PM, and Emma Thompson as his put-upon sister\n\nHe wrote the screenplay with both of them in mind, having previously worked with Grant on Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill, and with Thompson on The Tall Guy. It was an impeccably casting decision, giving us the iconic duo we never knew we needed.\n\n16 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n16. Martine McCutcheon's role was written especially for her\n\nHer character, Natalie, was actually called Martine in initial drafts of the script. This was changed before her audition to keep Martine on her toes, so she didn't assume the part was already in the bag.\n\n17 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n17. The Barbie dolls that Emma Thompson's Karen wraps up as gifts are actually Ken dolls in drag\n\n'Now, which doll shall we give Daisy's little friend Emily?' We've popped them both on our Crimbo wish lists.\n\n18 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n18. Sarah (Laura Linney)'s flat was inspired by the author of Bridget Jones's Diary\n\nThe split-level apartment, which we see after Sarah's office party, is based on Helen Fielding's home. The writer is a friend of Curtis, and worked with him on the film adaptation of Bridget Jones.\n\n19 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n19. The cast didn't film together, but they shared a huge trailer park\n\nBill Nighy told The Guardian, 'There were so many famous people in there, we used to talk about being on Liam Neeson Way or Emma Thompson Road or Hugh Grant Avenue. And it was a masterpiece of diplomacy, too; we all had the same size and type of trailer.'\n\n20 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n20. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth's storylines were originally intended as two separate, standalone films\n\nSadly, we can definitely imagine ourselves watching both films and then quickly obliterating them from our Netflix viewing history. Some things don't need a full two hours to tell.\n\n21 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n21. Joanna's rendition of All I Want For Christmas Is You was seen as too good to be true\n\nThe producers were a tad worried that audiences wouldn't believe it was a child singing, so they asked her to make her next take 'a little less good.' Justice for Joanna, our little Mariah Carey!\n\n22 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n22. Claudia Schiffer's cameo was never meant to happen\n\nThe producers wanted to cast someone who looked like the legendary supermodel, but predictably found this feat pretty difficult. The solution? Going direct to Claudia herself.\n\n23 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n23. Similarly, Curtis wanted a Laura Linney-type actress to play Linney's role\n\nAgain, no one quite fit the bill - so Curtis solved the problem by going straight to Linney, writing her a letter to explain the story. 'My part was originally written for another Brit, but he asked me to do it, and I was so excited to be asked,' Linney told the Daily Beast.\n\n24 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n24. Curtis had originally wanted the entire cast to be British, but this didn't quite work out.\n\nLinney's on-screen love interest, Karl, ended up being played by Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro. 'My character, Karl, was supposed to be British, but apparently they couldn't find the right actor,' he later explained.\n\n25 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n25. The wedding scene at the start of the film is actually based on a funeral\n\nThe idea for the surprise band in the church came after Curtis attended the funeral of Muppets creator Jim Henson, where the puppeteers and the 'Muppets' sang a song. We're adding it to our wedding (and funeral?) inspo boards.\n\n26 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n26. An annoying character called Bernard appears in each of Richard Curtisâ€™ films\n\nIt's his way of getting back at Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, who 'stole' his former girlfriend. Some feuds run deep. In Love Actually, Bernard is Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman's 'horrid son.'\n\n27 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n27. Hugh Grant was not on board with his dancing scene to begin with\n\nWho'd have guessed it! According to Curtis, Hugh was 'hugely grumpy about it.' He said, 'He kept on putting it off, and he didn't like the song. It was originally a Jackson 5 song, but we couldn't get it â€“ so he was hugely unhappy about it.'\n\n28 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n28. However, he ended up getting almost too involved with the performance\n\nCurtis adds, 'We didn't shoot it until the final day, and it went so well that when we edited it, it had gone too well, and he was singing along with the words, so it was incredibly hard to edit.'\n\n29 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n29. Grant's scenes were â€“ unsurprisingly â€“ not filmed in the real 10 Downing Street\n\nTo allow for a realistic portrayal, future inhabitant Gordon Brown (then Chancellor of the Exchequer) escorted Curtis and his production designer Jim Clay on a two-hour tour of Number 10. Banned from taking photos or notes, Clay had to recreate the house from memory.\n\n30 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n30. Think the scene with the cards is painfully creepy? Mark's declaration of love had to be written five times\n\nCurtis read out different options to the women in his office, and asked them to choose the least embarrassing messages. The result is stillllll pretty cringe, so we dread to think what the previous drafts were like.\n\n31 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n31. Andrew Lincoln wrote those infamous signs himself\n\n'The art department did it, and then I said, \"Well, can I do it?\" because I like to think my handwriting is really good,' he later recalled.\n\n32 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n32. Rowan Atkinson's cameo appearance was filmed at midnight in Selfridges\n\nTo avoid the crowds of tourists usually found in the popular department store, the production team asked for it to stay open late at night.\n\n33 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n33. Emma Thompson did twelve takes of the Joni Mitchell scene\n\nAKA the most devastating scene to exist on TV screens ever. Her crying was totally unscripted. 'I've had so much bloody practise at crying in a bedroom and then having to go out and be cheerful, gathering up the pieces of my heart and putting them in a drawer,' she later said. Hear that? That's our hearts breaking.\n\n34 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n34. Thompson also filmed her scenes wearing a fat suit\n\nYes, really.\n\n35 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n35. Olivia Olson (Joanna)'s first kiss was with her co-star Thomas Brodie-Sangster\n\n'It was my first kiss and on-screen kiss too,' she explained to E! News. 'I was really nervous because I kind of had a crush on Thomas back in the day and I was also worried, because I was taller than him if it was going to look weird.'\n\n36 of 37\n\n36. The IRL age gap between Kiera Knightley and Thomas Brodie-Sangster is five years.\n\nPick those jaws up off the ground. Thomas' Sam was ten years old in the film, while Kiera played a married woman and homeowner. In real life, Thomas was 13 and Keira was 18. The film's bosses have since admitted that she was 'too young for the role,' but insisted that 'it worked.'\n\n37 of 37\n\nCREDIT: Universal Pictures\n\n37. The word 'actuallyâ€™ is said 23 times in the film\n\nLove actually is all around! Keep that one in the bank for those upcoming Christmas quizzes.\n\nREAD MORE:**** A Look Back At Colin Firth's Relationship History\n\nREAD MORE: Colin Firth Wants To Make A Love Actually Sequel"
