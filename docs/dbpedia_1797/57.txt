For the first time in 15 years, Thailand will have match officials at the AFC Champions League.

The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has confirmed that referee Sivakorn Pu-udom and assistant referees Rawut Nakrit and Thanet Choochuen will officiate in the 2019 AFC Champions League tournament.

The trio will follow in the footsteps of referee Mongkol Rungklai who performed his duty in the continental club championship in 2004.

Sivakorn said: "Of course, I am very happy because it is every referee's dream to officiate in the AFC Champions League which could be a springboard to the World Cup finals.

"I could not even remember the last Thai referee who officiated in the ACL."

Sivakorn praised Football Association of Thailand president Somyot Poompunmuang for his role in upgrading the standard of Thai referees.

"I believe that more Thai referees will be selected to officiate at the Asian level," he said.

The qualifying stages of the 2019 AFC Champions League begin next month.
