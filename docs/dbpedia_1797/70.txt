VAR made its official debut during India’s FIFA Under 17 Women’s World Cup. For the match authorities, it is, undoubtedly, still another important step in preparing the likely hosts of the FIFA Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in 2023. There will be 14 officials working as referees, assistant referees, and video match officials from seven different Asian Football Confederation (AFC) member associations. Nobody is an Indian. Hyeon Jeong from Korea, Thailand’s Pansa Chaisanit, and Uzbekistan’s Edita Mirabidova will serve as head referees for the initial time in a FIFA competition. They will be joined by deputy judges Nuannid Donjiangreed, Supawan Hinthong of Thailand, Australia’s Joanna Charaktis, Kristina Sereda of Uzbekistan, and Xie Lijun and Fang Yan of China. Hanna Hattab of Syria, Sivakorn Pu-Udom of Thailand, Omar Mohamed Al Ali of the United Arab Emirates, and Lara Lee of Australia will also provide help from the VAR room.

Four events—goals and the violations that led to them, penalties and the infractions that led to them, immediate red card occurrences, and misidentification—can change the outcome of a game. These events are supported by VAR technology. The VAR staff constantly scans a game for errors involving these four match-changing circumstances. Only when there have been severely missed opportunities or blatant mistakes will the VAR crew interact with the referee.

VAR technology supports four situations that can alter the result of a game: goals and the offences that led to them, penalties and the offences that led to them, direct red card incidents, and misidentification.

The VAR team routinely searches for mistakes involving these four potentially game-changing situations throughout a game. The VAR crew only contacts the referee when there are obvious mistakes or big missed chances.

The U-17 World Cup in India will be the third FIFA women’s event to incorporate VAR, following the U-20 World Cup in Costa Rica in 2022 and the FIFA Women’s World Cup in France in 2019.

The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) will send 14 officials, including supervisors, assistant match officials, and video match officials, to the event. Native Indians are not prominent here.
