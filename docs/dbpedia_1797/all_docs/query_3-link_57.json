        "text": "Our super-duper smart coach took 26 players to this tournament. A good number are just filling the list and cannot be trusted for an important match! Makes you wonder what went on in our coach's brain when he put the list together. What criteria did he really use.\n\nIn his list there was no consideration for including back up for the key positions. For example, with Moharrami out, we have no replacement for Ramin, should he get injured or not able to play for whatever reasons (and not that he is anything hot at the moment). But he included two backup strikers in Moghanlou and Assadi who are just not at the level to be used in this tournament. Why did he bring these two is beyond anyone's imagination.\n\nI have given this GN guy the benefit of the doubt, but at this point, I have to say I have no trust in his ability to lead the team, make proper decision on formation, player selection, or coming up with a strategy/tactics that is gonna get us anything special, no trust in his subs, Nothing! ... And worse, is the shenanigans he delivers in his interviews before and after each game. The man is always talking like he was watching a different game or he is not responsible for the mess, millions witnessed.\n\nAt this point, whatever that happens in Japan game, will rest on the shoulder of players on the field. They have to find a way to lead themselves. This man is useless.â€‹\n\nAn issue nobody talked about here was the fact that TM games stadium against Syria was not suitable for the game. We saw the players were sweating bullets because there was no A/C in this stadium. It is always harder to play in heat and this had a lot of effect on our team IMHO.\n\nI am suspicious that Qatar is responsible for all this as we saw how they put Qatar in the best bracket. Do you really think Qatar would play in the same stadium?? no way. The teams Qatar is facing and the stadiums they are using have all been cherry picked for them.\n\nIn my mind there is no doubts about this. If you think at this point of time with the AI capabilities and advanced programming, they can not change these stuff? if you say no, then it shows you are not paying attention to details."
