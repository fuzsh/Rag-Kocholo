The mens competition will begin on 24 July 2024, while the gold medal match will take place on 9 August 2024, also at the Parc des Princes.\n\nThe match officials preparation will be regularly and closely monitored before and during the Olympic Games by a team of FIFA technical trainers, including referees and video assistant referee (VAR) instructors, as well as match analysts, fitness coaches, physiotherapists and sports scientists, all of whom will provide the officials with the best possible guidance and support.\n\nWhile the Olympic Football Tournaments Paris 2024 are this years flagship football competitions, for the selected match officials they represent the next important step on the road to the FIFA World Cup 26 and the FIFA Womens World Cup 2027.\n\nReferees in both the womens and mens tournaments will be supported by goal‑line technology and the VAR system, including semi‑automated offside technology.\n\nThe complete list of match officials appointed for the Olympic Football Tournaments Paris 2024 can be found below.\n\nhttps://digitalhub.fifa.com/m/2349f106f47a627b/original/OFTs-Paris-2024-List-of-appointed-FIFA-Match-Officials.pdf\n\nREFEREES:\n\nRamon ABATTI (BRZ)\n\nAdel AL NAQBI (UAE)\n\nEdina ALVES (BRZ)\n\nDahane BEIDA (MTN)\n\nEmikar CALDERAS (VEN)\n\nEspen ESKAS (NOR)\n\nYael FALCON (ARG)\n\nDrew FISCHER (CAN)\n\nKatia GARCIA (MEX)\n\nMahmood ISMAIL (SDN)\n\nBouchra KARBOUBI (MAR)\n\nCampbell-Kirk KAWANA-WAUGH (NZL)\n\nYujeong KIM (KOR)\n\nFrancois LETEXIER (FRA)\n\nSaid MARTINEZ (HON)\n\nGlenn NYBERG (SWE)\n\nTess OLOFSSON (SWE)\n\nTori PENSO (USA)\n\nIlgiz TANTASHEV (UZB)\n\nRebecca WELCH (ENG)\n\nYoshimi YAMASHITA (JPN)\n\nASSISTANT REFEREES:\n\nLiban AHMED (DJI)\n\nSabet AL-ALI (UAE)\n\nAhmed ALRASHADI (UAE)\n\nRafael ALVES (BRZ)\n\nLyes ARFA (CAN)\n\nNeuza BACK (BRZ)\n\nMichael BARWEGEN (CAN)\n\nIsaak BASHEVKIN (NOR)\n\nMahbod BEIGI (SWE)\n\nFabrini BEVILAQUA COSTA (BRZ)\n\nMary BLANCO (COL)\n\nMakoto BOZONO (JPN)\n\nGuillerme CAMILO (BRZ)\n\nEmily CARNEY (ENG)\n\nJoanna CHARAKTIS (AUS)\n\nDiana CHIKOTESHA (ZAM)\n\nMaximiliano DEL YESSO (ARG)\n\nFrancesa DI MONTE (ITA)\n\nKaren DIAZ MEDINA (MEX)\n\nJan Erik ENGAN (NOR)\n\nTimur GAYNULLIN (UZB)\n\nFatiha JERMOUMI (MAR)\n\nWalter LOPEZ (HON)\n\nBrooke MAYO (USA)\n\nCyril MUGNIER (FRA)\n\nBernard MUTUKERA (SOL)\n\nKathryn NESBITT (USA)\n\nElvis NOUPUE (CMR)\n\nFranca OVERTOOM (NED)\n\nMisuk PARK (KOR)\n\nMehdi RAHMOUNI (FRA)\n\nChristian RAMIREZ (HON)\n\nSandra RAMIREZ (MEX)\n\nFacundo RODRIGUEZ (ARG)\n\nMigdalia RODRIGUEZ (VEN)\n\nJerson SANTOS (ANG)\n\nAndreas SODERKVIST (SWE)\n\nAlmira SPAHIC (SWE)\n\nNaomi TESHIROGI (JPN)\n\nIsaac TREVIS (NZL)\n\nAndrey TSAPENKO (UZB)\n\nStephen YIEMBE (KEN)\n\nVAR:\n\nKhamis AL MARRI (QAT)\n\nMahmoud ASHOUR (EGY)\n\nIvan BEBEK (CRO)\n\nLahlou BENBRAHIM (ALG)\n\nJerome BRISARD (FRA)\n\nRodrigo CARVAJAL (CHI)\n\nDavid COOTE (ENG)\n\nCarlos DEL CERRO GRANDE (ESP)\n\nRob DIEPERINK (NED)\n\nLeodan GONZALEZ (URU)\n\nTatiana GUZMAN (NCA)\n\nOvidiu HATEGAN (ROM)\n\nKate JACEWICZ (AUS)\n\nKatalin KULCSAR (HUN)\n\nDaiane MUNIZ (BRA)\n\nGuillermo PACHECO (MEX)\n\nHector PALETTA (ARG)\n\nDaneon PARCHMENT (JAM)\n\nSivakorn PU-UDOM (THA)\n\nPaolo VALERI (ITA)\n\nEdited to add a bit of colour! bmb\n\n« Last Edit: Wed 03 Apr 2024 18:35 by bmb »\n\nAgree x 1 View List\n\nRCG\n\nRTR Veterans\n\nHero Member\n\nPosts: 2,214\n\nRe: Olympic Football Tournaments - Paris 2024\n\n« Reply #1 on: Wed 03 Apr 2024 15:57 »\n\nCongrats to Rebecca, Emily and David\n\nAgree x 3 View List\n\nRCG\n\nRTR Veterans\n\nHero Member\n\nPosts: 2,214\n\nRe: Olympic Football Tournaments - Paris 2024\n\n« Reply #2 on: Wed 03 Apr 2024 17:15 »\n\nDespite our misgivings he had a very good FIFA tournament earlier in the season\n\nAgree x 1 View List\n\nbmb\n\nAdministrator\n\nHero Member\n\nPosts: 6,224\n\nGender:\n\nCausing mischief & mayhem!!\n\nLocation: Somewhere between Poole & Budapest!\n\nReferee Level: Observer/Mentor.\n\nRe: Olympic Football Tournaments - Paris 2024\n\n« Reply #3 on: Wed 03 Apr 2024 18:38 »\n\nCongrats to all officials chosen but especially Rebecca, Emily, David, Katalin & Ovi.\n\nHajrá Lilák.

Suggests they'll be available for both competitions, though I suspect much more likely to see female officials on mens games rather than male officials on womens games.\n\nAgree x 1 View List\n\nAcme Thunderer\n\nRTR Veterans\n\nHero Member\n\nPosts: 2,492\n\nRe: Olympic Football Tournaments - Paris 2024\n\n« Reply #5 on: Thu 04 Apr 2024 15:09 »\n\nDahane BEIDA (MTN)\n\nWas he not the young guy who made a complete mess of the African Nations Final earlier in the year?\n\nRCG\n\nRTR Veterans\n\nHero Member\n\nPosts: 2,214\n\nRe: Olympic Football Tournaments - Paris 2024\n\n« Reply #6 on: Thu 04 Apr 2024 17:01 »\n\nGood to see some British representation.\n\nIt's interesting that they've released this as one big list, rather than a men and women's competition list.
