        "text": "Odd, but maybe expected that FIFA and AFC have a difference of opinion on how to label him.\n\nEither way, he's got to hope that Iran and Australia remain on the same half of the KO bracket. That seems very likely, given their groups. And if they go through as group winners, they would (potentially) meet in the SFs, leaving the entire top of the bracket open to him. If they split and both do well, though, Faghani's opportunities will be narrow even if he performs.\n\nMakhadmah, Al-Kaf and Taqi have all been on FIFA's radar before and could be wise to bring back into the fold on the road to WC2026 as they all have (varying degrees of) merit imo. Al-Ali from Kuwait is quite good and glad he's got a chance. Most of the other names I know fairly well and would encourage others not to expect very much. Bonyadifard and Nasaruddin are completely new for me though and would be interesting to see what they will bring.\n\nCAF is also fairly bad but I wouldn't say they are much worse than before.\n\nWhat do you think of Tantashev? I’ve watched very little of him recently but thought he was ok a while back. Uzbek referees tend to be very trusted by AFC (Irmatov and Kovalenko as well, of course).\n\nKovalenko was actually very good imo but I don't like Tantashev personally. Waayyy too passive and everything seems a bit of a 'struggle' for him, even in normal-difficulty games. I don't think he has ever been to a FIFA tournament despite being around for quite a while now, and maybe that's telling.\n\nHe has in the latest assignments just been appointed to referee Indonesia vs. Iraq in this tournament, btw.\n\nEDIT: The first 'breaking' of the list that I drew up has already been made, Kim Jong-hyeok (kor) will referee Japan vs. Vietnam. He is an interesting name that I kind of forgot about who was considered by FIFA when he was very young on the road to WC2018, but then suffered serious health problems as I recall, and was out for ≈2yrs. The other Korean, Ko, is generally a solid/average official but nothing more. So on the (re-)emerging front, Kim Jong-hyeok could be an interesting point at this tournament.\n\nI disagree with the decision. He doesn’t prevent the opponent from playing the ball after the header because there was no possibility of the opponent playing the ball to begin with. The opponent’s left foot, which he would need to use to move towards the ball, isn’t even on the ground from the moment of the header until the ball’s past him. It would have been completely impossible for the defender to touch the ball.\n\nI'm kind of torn.\n\nYou're probably right as you describe things. But then again, if the attacker wasn't there at all in an OSP, the defender would have positioned himself a little differently (I mean, he's sort of being forced into the goal by the attacker as the play unfolds). That said, even if he wasn't marked at all, the likelihood of the defender reacting quickly and well enough to do anything but head the ball into the roof of his own net at best seems incredibly low.\n\nThis seems one of those ones where if you look at it with \"big picture\" glasses, you casually dismiss it and say \"no, that's obviously a goal.\" But if you look at each component as they unfold and cross-reference it with Law 11 and instructions... yeah, it's an offence. I wish \"what does football expect\" ruled the day, but on plays like this it seems to be more of nice theory than an actual principle that gets applied."
