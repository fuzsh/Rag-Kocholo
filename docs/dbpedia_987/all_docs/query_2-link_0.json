        "text": "If in the book they are talking about image sprites for the web they are images that contain multiple images, like for instance a series of icons to be used in a navigation bar. You would have one http request for the \"sprite\" and use CSS to display the icon needed. You can have sprites that contain all of the images for a given page if you wanted. The main reason for using them is to lower the amount of files to be downloaded for the website or webpage.\n\nSee CSS-tricks article\n\nHope this helped:)\n\nTechnically and historically, a sprite is an animation (not an individual frame of one). I have never seen an actual authority cite the origin of the term, but it has to do with scanline priority queues and graphic display hardware.\n\nA sprite sheet is a well-structured single image (usually a series of animation frames laid out in a grid of n Rows and n Columns, but often a grid with one row and many columns) which allows a program to store all the animation data in contiguous memory and to easily animate it by incrementing the pointer by a well-defined amount.\n\nA paper and pencil analogue to this is a roll of paper tape with drawings on it, pulled behind a frame which is set up so that only one drawing is visible through the frame at any given time. If you pull the tape rapidly enough, you see an animation.\n\nSounds a lot like a movie reel."
