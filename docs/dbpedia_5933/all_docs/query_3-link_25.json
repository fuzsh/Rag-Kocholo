        "meta_description": "It may have only been converted to a bus garage in 1980, but our base at Stamford Brook has a long history of public transport because it first opened as a tram depot. Today it is home to a busy network of services that are mainly focussed around Hammersmith. As well as providing bus services, the site houses the headquarters of RATP Dev Transit London and our central engineering works.",

        "text": "Kevin was promoted to his position as General Manager in 2022. He was previously Operations Manager at our Tolworth and Fulwell Garages.\n\nAs well as gaining extensive managerial experience, Kevin has the advantage of having started work in the industry as a bus driver in 1990. Since then, he has worked his way up the ladder to his present position.\n\n“Now that I have my own team of drivers, I can draw on my own experiences to support and guide them,” said Kevin.\n\nKevin’s hands-on knowledge, depth of experience and approachable style have already proven invaluable in the operation of the garage and building a rapport among the whole team.\n\nKevin is passionate about providing good customer service and is determined to go from strength to strength."
