        "text": "Last week, a subsidiary of a large, international public transit firm said it had pulled out of a pending deal to buy Camarillo-based Roadrunner Management Services and sister company Roadrunner Shuttle and become the new operator of the Ventura County Transportation Commission’s intercity bus lines.\n\nOn Friday, it and Roadrunner, the current operator, told the commission the proposed deal was back on.\n\nDeal falls apart: Branch of int’l firm says it has pulled out of acquisition to operate county buses\n\nDeclining ridership: Study finds less people riding SoCal, Ventura County buses\n\nPursuant to the transaction, Texas-based RATP Dev USA — a subsidiary of Paris-headquartered RATP Group — would take over the final six years of Roadrunner’s contract with the commission as soon as May 1.\n\nRATP Group is one of the world’s largest public transit firms, operating in 15 countries on four continents.\n\nThe seven bus lines RATP Dev USA would start operating run between Ventura County cities and neighboring Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties and serve about 800,000 riders a year.\n\nBlaine Rigler, president of RATP Dev USA, told the commission at its monthly meeting at Camarillo City Hall that an issue that had caused his company to pull out of the deal had been resolved.\n\nThe issue was a class-action lawsuit against Roadrunner that had been discovered during RATP Dev’s “due diligence investigation” of the Camarillo company, which hadn’t divulged the litigation to RATP Dev.\n\n“We have been on a path for some number of months now to acquire Roadrunner and had come fairly close to the finish line ... when a legal matter arose ... that proved to make the acquisition not viable,” Rigler told the commission’s board, chaired by Ventura County Supervisor Linda Parks.\n\n“We had that discussion with the Roadrunner ownership (and) they took the steps they needed to take to resolve that legal matter,” he said. “That was done this past week. Based on that, we’re in a position now to go ahead and finalize the acquisition. ... We anticipate (it could) happen as early as this week.”\n\nRoadrunner CEO Brad “Brick” Conners told the board he concurred with everything Rigler had said.\n\nNeither he nor Rigler disclosed any details about the class-action lawsuit, who filed it or what it alleged.\n\nBut in response to their assurances that the deal was on track to be finalized, the board postponed until its May 11 meeting considering two recommendations from its executive director, Darren Kettle. Kettle made the recommendations before learning from Rigler this week that the proposed transaction was back on.\n\nThose recommendations were for the board to rescind its prior approval of the pending deal and authorize a request for proposals from other contractors to take over Roadrunner’s contract to operate the bus lines.\n\nThe board tabled the recommendations until May 11 to give RATP Dev and Roadrunner time to complete the acquisition, under which Roadrunner employees will continue to drive the buses.\n\nIf in the off-chance the deal is not finalized by the May 11 meeting, the board will still be able to consider those recommendations, Kettle said.\n\nBut “our position at this point based on this recent information is that assuming this transaction moves forward,” the board’s previous approval of the pending deal “be allowed to proceed and ... we will take on the new company as our provider,” Kettle said.\n\nParks said she was heartened by the announcement that the pending deal was still alive and about to be finalized.\n\n“I must say I find this really good news,” she said.\n\nOther commissioners weren’t so thrilled.\n\n“We’re in a very difficult position because the seller (Roadrunner) didn’t divulge” the class-action lawsuit, said commissioner Claudia Bill-de la Peña, a Thousand Oaks councilwoman. Still, Bill-de la Peña voted with the other commissioners to postpone considering Kettle’s recommendations until May 11.\n\nOutside the commission’s meeting room, the Camarillo City Council’s chambers, both Rigler and Conners said they were pleased that the pending deal was back on.\n\n“I’m ecstatic,” Rigler said. “We’ve wanted this for many months, and I think we’ve gotten to the point where we can now move forward.”\n\nSaid Conners: “I’m really so happy. This is going to be a great opening of a new chapter in the long life of the company. So we’re excited to be a part of RATP Dev family.”"
