Headquartered in Paris and operating bus, rail, metro and tram services in 15 countries, RATP Dev is poised to hit a turnover of €2billion by the year 2020.\n\n​\n\nMadame Batlle began her career as an accountant in PWC, being appointed a partner at the tender age of 33. Her desire to move into a completely new industry stemmed from her desire to constantly push herself and while she began as CFO at RATP Dev, she was recently appointed as CEO. She shared her career path, was frank about the challenges she faced along the way and how she managed to overcome these."
