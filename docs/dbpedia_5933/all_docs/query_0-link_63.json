        "text": "SPEAKERS\n\n–\n\nYo Kaminagai\n\nRATP\n\nParis, France\n\nwww.ratp.fr\n\nUnder the signs: culture and strategy\n\nDesign management is a competency used for a long time in the RATP. The RATP mapping system will be presented under this angle, which will be completed by a historical vision and also as a part of the transit signs system including the signage, and the digital applications as a whole. The presentation will be concluded with the proposal of some strategic questions, which are relevant for the future of the transit maps.\n\n.\n\nJug Cerovic\n\ninat\n\nParis, France\n\nwww.inat.fr\n\nTheory and practice of complex networks maps design\n\nParis, Tokyo, Luxembourg, Takamatsu, Europe Night Trains, China Cityscape\n\n.\n\nIlya Birman\n\nIlya Birman\n\nChelyabinsk, Russian Federation\n\nilyabirman.net\n\nMap as a symbol. Aesthetics and culture in a map’s graphic design\n\nTransit maps are functional: we need to get passengers from A to B, help them get the right train and arrive on time. We know what works and what doesn’t, we know how to test what we are not sure about. This is pragmatic and logical. But there is another side: aesthetics.\n\n.\n\nJens Unger\n\nHERE Technologies\n\nBerlin, Germany\n\nwww.here.com\n\nIntermodality & Isoline Maps\n\n.\n\nHanna Kopps\n\nTransport for London – TfL\n\nLondon, UK\n\ntfl.gov.uk\n\nA digital mapping language\n\nHow will our mapping language, based on Harry Beck’s iconic Tube map, evolve and adapt to a new digital environment. We’ve been exploring this topic over the last year and will share some of our insights.\n\n.\n\nZak Zakaria\n\nDezigntechnic\n\nDubai, UAE\n\nwww.dezigntechnic.com\n\nSignage and wayfinding in the desert\n\n.\n\nFlorian Lainez\n\nJungle Bus\n\nParis, France\n\njunglebus.io\n\nCrowdsourcing transit maps: change the game of open data\n\nSharing transit data has always been nothing more but the very first step. OpenStreetMap is now becoming the hub for collaboration between public/private/academic players. Discover how the self-organized OpenStreetMap community maps public transport networks all over the world and how your business can benefit.\n\n.\n\nSimone Morgagni\n\nSNCF\n\nParis, France\n\nwww.sncf.com\n\nPassenger path decisions on complex transport networks: challenging maps design between traveler’s perception and operational constraints\n\n.\n\nIlya Petoushkoff\n\nMobilityInChain\n\nMoscow, Russian Federation\n\nwww.michain.com\n\nBehind the map: how is public transport relevant and how can we treat it better?\n\nPublic transportation is relevant to our cities. Despite all new technology, people still need to show up to each other, and to move around freely. Public transport is going to remain the most efficient way of helping them do so. Given the challenges public transport industry faces all around the world, such as under-funding, under-appreciation, lack of user-friendly approach, it is very important to think of transit more as a product that users will desire to buy, and buy into. With this in mind, mapping is a powerful instrument of communication, not only between the transit operators and the users, but also within the transit planning process. During the presentation, Ilya will give an overview of how public transport is designed and operated. He will address the resemblance in thinking process behind planning public transportation services and designing great transit maps.\n\n.\n\nSeijin Cha\n\nNaver\n\nSeoul, Republic of Korea\n\nwww.naver.com\n\nDesigning User Interface for Public Transportation Users in South Korea\n\nPeople who travel on public transportation check a wide range of information through map service. To provide better information, it is important to design the service reflecting on local public transportation and the need for its users. This talk will share how NAVER, a major search company providing map service in South Korea, has been reflecting on the tendency of Korean users and environment on the interface.\n\n.\n\nMichael Firnhaber\n\nGoogle Maps Urban Mobillity\n\nHamburg, Germany\n\nmaps.google.com\n\n.\n\nMark Ovenden\n\nMark Ovenden\n\nManchester, UK\n\nwww.markovenden.com\n\nMaptastic – The Joy of Weird and Wacky Transit Maps\n\nHow did we all get so hooked on these objects most people take for granted? What makes transit maps iconic to the city the represent? And let’s celebrate some of the weirdest and wackiest ones ever made. Design historian and broadcaster Mark Ovenden, whose first book Metro Maps of the World came from his own collection, explains how he got the idea to make the book and why it’s turned into a lot more than a hobby."
