The Parisian operator will therefore support the deployment of standards and practices for plug-and-play systems. Moreover, RATP will play a big role in contributing knowledge to the creation of new and update of existing standards.\n\nGiven the stakes for the RATP for the coming years, and especially in the context of competitive bidding, we were looking forward to joining the association ITxPT to keep our customers and suppliers informed, whether rolling stock or embedded hardware, about our commitment to innovation for the benefit of our travelers. The opportunity to work with all the actors of the association brings us a lot of possibilities strengthening us in the choices of innovation we already made several years ago. Additionally this relies on a movement of European standardization, recognized and still in full growth. In conclusion, we are expecting a lot from this collaboration, given this increasingly demanding issues and context of public transport services, conclude together RATP MRB’s departement members."
