        "text": "Taking the Paris metro for the first time can be very intimidating. But don’t worry, because, in this guide, I’m going to teach you everything you need to know in order to take the metro without stress just like a real Parisian.\n\nThe Paris Metro: Pros and Cons\n\nPros:\n\nThe metro is the fastest means of transportation to travel through the city. It avoids the busy traffic that the other means of transportation are confronted with.\n\nThe metro stations are ideally located, which makes joining highly visited places such as the museums, the department stores, and the monuments easy.\n\nThere are many metro lines (16) and stations (309) and you can reach any part of the city within a 20-minute walk from a metro station.\n\nThe metro is in service as early as 5:30 a.m. and closes as late as 1:15 a.m. from Sunday to Thursday. On Fridays and Saturdays, and on the eve of public holidays, it closes as late as 2:15 a.m.\n\nLine 14 and line 1 (which stops at important touristic sites) are automated, making them fully operational even during strikes.\n\nCons:\n\nThe large crowd during rush hours can make the trip uncomfortable or even suffocating. The risk of encountering pickpockets is also higher.\n\nThe Paris metro cruelly lacks hygiene. Unsettling smells can be a real problem.\n\nParis is quite often subject to strikes, making the metro hardly accessible.\n\nMetro trains are not adapted for travelers with massive luggage and not all stations are equipped with escalators and elevators.\n\nThe elderly, the handicapped, and families traveling with a stroller can have a harder time accessing the metro.\n\nSometimes, many links are needed in order to go from one place to another.\n\nThere are often passenger incidents, which can disrupt traffic.\n\nMy tip: prefer taking an Uber or a taxi if you’re carrying a lot of luggage or if there are major disruptions on the metro. Otherwise, the metro is an excellent means of transportation.\n\nParis Metro Map\n\nWith its 16 metro lines stopping at 309 stations, the Paris metro network is one of the most dense in the world.\n\nThe metro lines are interconnected, allowing passengers to travel through the whole of Paris via the links between the metros, but also with the RER (high-speed train linking Paris to the suburbs), the tramways, and the buses.\n\nThe Châtelet station is notably known for being linked to as many as five metro lines (1, 4, 7, 11, 14) and two RER lines (A and B).\n\nHow to take the Paris metro?\n\nThe metro entrances are easily identifiable with their signs indicating the name of the station and the metro lines that are in circulation.\n\nYou can buy train tickets right away:\n\non the machines designed for this purpose\n\ndirectly at the ticket counter\n\nThis ticket is necessary to go through the turnstiles and access the metro lines. You can also get a subscription, but I will explain that in more detail later down below.\n\nInside the station, signs across the walls or hanging from the ceiling indicate the direction for each metro line. When you arrive at the right track, you’ll find a sign showing all the stops of the metro line.\n\nBeware that the metro circulates in both directions. The direction is indicated on the sign at the entrance of the tracks as well as on the monitors hanging from the ceiling. Those monitors also tell the waiting time.\n\nA tip for those in a rush: according to your destination, it will be better to be seated at the front, the middle, or the rear of the train. Some apps like Citymapper tell you the best position.\n\nMetro schedules\n\nThe Parisian public transport network is managed by the RATP (Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens).\n\nMetro service runs from 5:30 a.m. to 1:15 a.m. from Sunday to Thursday. On Friday and Saturday nights, and on the eve of public holidays, they run until 2:15 a.m.\n\nUnfortunately, this doesn’t mean that you can hop on a train two minutes before the end of service. Usually, the last departures are between 00:30 and 00:40 a.m., to arrive at the terminus at 1:15 a.m., Or between 1:30 and 1:40 a.m. to arrive at 2:15 a.m. So keep this in mind.\n\nMetros run about every 2 minutes during rush hour (7:30 to 9:30 a.m. and 4:30 to 7:30 p.m.), and every 4 to 5 minutes the rest of the time. Late in the evening (after 11 p.m.), you’ll have to wait 7 to 10 minutes.\n\nTo find out exactly when the metro runs, you can go directly to their official website.\n\nThe most practical way is to download the Ile-de-France Mobilités app, which allows you to follow the metro traffic in real-time, but also the traffic of all the other services run by RATP (bus, RER, tramway).\n\nTraffic information (delays, line closures, suspicious packages) is regularly relayed, enabling you to anticipate your journeys as effectively as possible.\n\nTickets and Subscriptions to The Paris Metro\n\nGood to know:\n\nThe metro is free for children under 4, and children aged between 4 and 10 benefit from half-price on certain passes.\n\nThe Ile-de-France region is divided into 5 zones: zones 1-3 serve Paris and the suburbs, while zones 4 and 5 serve the rest of the region (including Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports and Disneyland Paris).\n\nSingle ticket: ticket t+\n\nThis ticket can be used on the metro, RER, bus, and tramway, and remains valid for 1 hour and 30 minutes from the time it is validated, as long as you don’t leave the network.\n\nSeveral media are compatible with the ticket t+:\n\nThe classic paper ticket\n\nThe Navigo Easy\n\nSmartphones via the Ile-de-France Mobilités app\n\nIt costs €2.10 each, and the “carnet” of 10 costs €16.90 in its digital form.\n\nThe physical form of the carnet costs €19.10, but will no longer be available for sale from September 21, 2023.\n\nThe ticket t+ is particularly practical for short stays, where the average use is at least two tickets a day.\n\nDaily tickets: Navigo Day and Mobilis Day\n\nThese tickets allow unlimited travel for a whole day in the selected zones.\n\nThe Navigo Day can be recharged on all the Navigo passes and on the Ile-de-France Mobilités app.\n\nAs for the Mobilis Day, it comes in the form of a magnetic coupon on which you have to write your name and the date of use.\n\nBoth start at €8.45 / day for two zones.\n\nMy advice: choose the one at €11.30 that covers zone 1-3. This will be more than enough to visit Paris. I also recommend the Navigo Day, which is much easier to use and can be recharged directly on your phone.\n\nWeekly ticket: Navigo Weekly\n\nThis ticket allows unlimited travel in the whole of the Ile-de-France region ( zones 1-5) for an entire week!\n\nYou can recharge this pass on the following media:\n\nNavigo travel card and Navigo Découverte travel card\n\nOn the Ile-de-France Mobilités app\n\nThe ticket costs €30 / week for all five zones. Ideal for frequent commuters.\n\nPlease note: the Navigo Weekly is only valid for the current week. This means that if you subscribe to this pass on Thursday, you’ll only be able to use it until Sunday… and not until next Thursday. Contrary to popular belief, this is not a 7-day pass.\n\nThe best for tourists: Paris Visite\n\nIf you’re planning to spend at least 5 days in Paris, this pass will be your best ally.\n\nIt allows you to visit Paris for 1 to 5 consecutive days in zones 1-3 or 1-5 depending on the package you choose.\n\nLike the Mobilis Day, the Paris Visite comes in the form of a magnetic coupon on which you have to write your name and dates of use.\n\nWhat makes it different is its sliding scale price. Starting at €13.55 / day, the 5-day pass costs €43.30, i.e. €13.20 less than if you had taken 5 Mobilis Day or 5 Navigo Day.\n\nSo, it is a very good deal if you’re planning a 5-day trip to Paris, especially since it gives you special cultural and commercial benefits.\n\nFor the young: Navigo Jeunes Week-end\n\nPeople under 26 y/o have access to a €4.60 / day ticket for zones 1-3 on Saturdays and Sundays and public holidays.\n\nIt can be recharged on all Navigo travel cards and on the Ile-de-France Mobilités app.\n\nOne-way ticket: Origin-Destination ticket\n\nPerfect for a single trip in the Ile-de-France region, its price varies according to origin and destination but does not exceed €5.\n\nIt’s also available in a “carnet” of 10 costing no more than €40, for a unit price capped at €4. Not a bad deal, is it?\n\nWhere to buy the tickets and the subscriptions?\n\nThere are several ways to buy tickets and get a subscription:\n\nAutomatic distributors\n\nThey can be found at all metro, RER, and tramway stations. They can be found at some bus stations too.\n\nOn the machine, you can buy paper tickets or recharge your Navigo travel card and pay by cash or CB.\n\nSome machines also issue Navigo Easy travel cards for €2, so you can buy one and recharge it straight away at the same machine.\n\nTicket counters\n\nLocated in all metro stations, as well as RER stations and some bus stops, ticket counters are identifiable by their blue signs. They offer ticket sales by credit card only, and subscription to Navigo Annual, Monthly, Weekly, Améthyste, and Liberté +.\n\nRATP agencies\n\nRATP agencies offer a complete service, including ticket sales, Navigo subscription, travel card recharging, and after-sales service.\n\nThey are also an information point.\n\nAgence RATP Gare de Lyon – Place Louis Armand, 75012 Paris\n\nOpening hours: Monday to Friday: 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. | Saturday: 1:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. | Sunday: closed\n\nAgence RATP Gare du Nord – Place Napoléon III, 75010 Paris\n\nOpening hours: Monday to Saturday: 7:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. | Sunday: 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.\n\nRATP Denfert-Rochereau agency – 3 place Denfert-Rochereau, 75014 Paris\n\nOpening hours: Monday to Friday: 7:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. | Closed on weekends\n\nAgence RATP Etoile – Place Charles de Gaulle, 75017 Paris\n\nOpening hours: Monday to Friday: 7 am-7 pm | Closed on weekends\n\nAgence RATP Nation – 15 Place de la Nation, 75012 Paris\n\nOpening hours: Monday to Friday: 7:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. | Closed on weekends\n\nRATP-approved shops\n\nThere are many RATP-approved shops (newspaper kiosks, tobacconists, etc.) selling t+ tickets, and travel cards for Navigo Day, Jeunes Week-end, Navigo Weekly, and Navigo Monthly.\n\nThese shops also sell Navigo Easy and Navigo Découverte travel cards.\n\nProvincial stations and airports\n\nMany shops outside Paris sell Ticket t+, Paris Visite tickets for zones 1-5, and Orlyval tickets, so you can stock up on tickets before you leave for Paris.\n\nFrom the Comité Régional du Tourisme\n\nTourist Information Points (Points Information Tourisme) are the first port of call for visitors to Paris.\n\nThey are located in the arrival terminals of Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Paris-Orly airports, as well as in Paris at the Galeries Lafayette, Versailles, and Disneyland Paris.\n\nOn the Internet\n\nVisit the iledefrance-mobilites.fr website to subscribe, recharge, and order your travel cards.\n\nMetro Lines to Paris Train Stations\n\nParis’ numerous train stations make the city accessible from all over France and even from Europe’s largest cities. They are also well connected to the public transport network, particularly the metro.\n\nGare du Nord – 112 rue de Maubeuge, 75010 Paris\n\nMetro: line 2 (stop “La Chapelle”), 4 and 5\n\nGare de l’Est – Place du 11 novembre 1918, 75010 Paris\n\nMetro: line 4, 5 and 7\n\nGare Saint Lazare – 13 rue d’Amsterdam, 75008 Paris\n\nMetro: line 3, 9 (stop “Havre-Caumartin”), 12, 13 and 14\n\nGare Montparnasse – 17 boulevard Vaugirard, 75015 Paris\n\nMetro: line 4, 6, 12 and 13\n\nGare de Lyon – Place Louis-Armand, 75012 Paris\n\nMetro: line 1 and 14\n\nGare d’Austerlitz – 7 boulevard de l’Hôpital, 75013 Paris\n\nMetro: line 5 and 10\n\nGare de Bercy – 48 bis boulevard de Bercy, 75012 Paris\n\nMetro: line 6 and 14 (stop “Bercy”)\n\nMetro Lines to Paris Touristic Sites\n\nSome metro lines are nicknamed “tourist lines” because they stop close to major tourist attractions:\n\nLine 1: passes by the Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre, Place de la Concorde, the Champs-Élysées, and Châtelet.\n\nLine 4: passes by Notre-Dame Cathedral, the Marais district, and the Latin Quarter.\n\nLine 6: passes by the Eiffel Tower, Trocadéro, Les Invalides, and the Montparnasse district.\n\nLine 7: passes by the Louvre, the Opéra Garnier, the Galeries Lafayette Haussmann, the Printemps Haussmann, and the Châtelet district.\n\nLine 12: passes through Montmartre, the Sacré-Coeur, and the Moulin Rouge.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhich metro lines are the most saturated?\n\nLine 1: serves major business districts such as La Défense and Châtelet, and passes through highly touristic areas such as the Champs-Elysées and the Louvre.\n\nLine 4: runs through central Paris, stopping at popular stations such as Châtelet, Gare du Nord, and Montparnasse-Bienvenũe.\n\nLine 13: connects the northern and southern suburbs of Paris, passing through densely populated areas. Montparnasse-Bienvenüe and Saint-Lazare stations are particularly saturated at rush hour.\n\nLine 14: serves major business districts such as Bercy, Châtelet, and Saint-Lazare, and attracts many workers.\n\nWhat are the metro rush hours?\n\nMorning: 7:30 to 9:30 a.m.\n\nEvening: 4:30 to 7:30 p.m.\n\nWhat are the best times to avoid the crowds?\n\nDuring off-peak hours, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.\n\nHow do connections work with other means of transport, such as RER, buses, or tramways?\n\nMetro/metro and metro/RER connections are made within the stations themselves. Simply follow the signs to the right platform. As you remain within the network, you don’t need to punch a new ticket.\n\nConnections with the tramway are, of course, made outside, so you need to get out of the metro. And since you’re leaving the metro network, you need to punch a new ticket. The same applies to the bus.\n\nAre there pickpockets in the metro? How can I avoid them?\n\nYes, pickpockets can be present in the metro. They’re particularly prevalent on lines like 1 and 7, which are highly frequented by tourists.\n\nThere’s no real way to avoid them, but you can protect yourself by looking after your personal belongings. Keep your belongings on you, for example. Pickpockets are very good at opening handbags and backpacks. Purse snatching is also quite common.\n\nAre there public restrooms in the Paris metro?\n\nYes, but only in a few stations. Here’s a list of the network’s public restrooms and their locations.\n\nHow can I get real-time information about delays or service interruptions on the metro?\n\nDirectly on the RATP website, or on the Ile-de-France Mobilités app.\n\nThe various metro lines all have an official Twitter account on which they relay information in real-time.\n\nAre there any baggage restrictions on the Paris metro?\n\nSuitcases, bags, and other packages must not exceed 75 cm.\n\nLong packages must not exceed 2 meters in length, and their dimensions must not exceed 20 cm (skis are accepted, for example).\n\nWhich metro stations are the prettiest?\n\nAbbesses (line 12): its entrance is in the shape of a Guimard kiosk, designed by the French artist of the same name, and its interior is decorated with colorful earthenware tiles and artistic frescoes along the corridors.\n\nArts et Métiers (line 3, 11): inspired by the world of science and invention, the walls of this station are covered with copper reminiscent of the inside of a machine, and cogs decorate the ceiling.\n\nLouvre-Rivoli (line 1): close to the famous museum, this station displays reproductions of some of its works, such as the Venus de Milo and the Pharaoh statue. There are nine statues in total.\n\nPont Neuf (line 7): from its full name “Pont Neuf La Monnaie”, it’s easy to see why huge coins decorate the station’s enclosure. Showcases of rare coins and an old money balance add to the station’s charm.\n\nConcorde (line 12): this station plunges you into the heart of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with its text inscribed right on the walls."
