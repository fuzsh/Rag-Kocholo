        "text": "We are very pleased to announce that we have signed another framework agreement with the public carrier from the French capital – Regie Autonome des Transports Parisiens, and will provide fast charging systems for electric buses to Paris.\n\nUnder the new, yet another contract, we will deliver fast charging infrastructure for zero-emission city vehicles to Paris, with a total value of up to 37 million EUR.\n\nThe first order under the new contract is for 349 charging stations. Since 2018, Ekoenergetyka has been one of the main suppliers of fast charging systems for the Paris-based carrier.\n\n“The continued cooperation with RATP is for us the best confirmation of the quality of our products, services and business relationships. Our charging infrastructure complies with the requirements of the third largest public transport operator in the world, which also proves the company’s global potential. Congratulations on the scale and systematic implementation of the entire project undertaken by RATP. I hope our solutions will mostly supply the zero-emission public transport of Paris.”\n\n– comments Bartosz Kubik, co-founder and CEO of Ekoenergetyka.\n\nThe RATP by 2025 is ambitiously committed to creating a 100% environmentally friendly, zero-emission bus fleet in the Paris region.\n\nAchieving this goal requires the conversion of half of bus depots and equipping them with the most modern charging systems.\n\nFor more information please download press release:"
