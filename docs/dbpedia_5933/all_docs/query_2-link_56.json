        "text": "The H2020 EU-funded MobiDataLab project aims to foster digitalisation for mobility stakeholders through the development of worldwide data-sharing culture, starting with Europe. The project organises problem-solving-oriented Labs to co-develop knowledge and technical solutions based on mobility data.\n\nIn this framework, the project partners invite you to join the MobiDataLab Hackathon on 15 and 16 September 2023, organised by Hove in Paris at Makesense – 11 Rue Biscornet, 75012 Paris. Hackathon participants will develop tools and processes to improve mobility services. To this end, they will collaborate with fellow experts and enthusiasts, and exploit MobiDataLab data resources. The Hackathon is the second event within MobiDataLab’s Living & Virtual labs. Participants will develop new data analytics tools, using the resources of the MobiDataLab cloud (data, APIs or software). They will also be required to demonstrate the business model of their tools, and the added value they bring to stakeholders of defined challenges.\n\nMobiDataLab provides access to a Reference Group (selected cities and mobility data providers and users), and to a catalogue of data and services via the MobiDataLab Transport Cloud.\n\nThe Hackathon's key objectives are:\n\nInnovative data analytics tools and services,\n\nKey inputs for mobility services improvement,\n\nWorkable business models and added value for defined mobility challenges and affected stakeholders.\n\nStart-ups, developers, and inventors, we need YOU here: Help us change the theory into practice!\n\nMore information\n\nThe application for the Hackathon runs through the project partner F6S. F6S is Europe’s largest start-up and entrepreneurs’ network with the leading platform for application management for commercial, corporate, government, university, and other accelerator programs.\n\nCreate an Account or Sign-in at f6s.com\n\nFill Out and Submit the Application Form\n\nThe Application Form will be open between 1 June (08:00 CEST) and 31 July (17:00 CEST). Currently, the Form collects applications only for on-site participation, in Paris. Should you want to participate virtually, stay in the know with the project channels for further news.\n\nThe participants of the MobiDataLab Datathon of May 2023 are more than welcome to join the Hackathon as well, to ensure the MobiDataLab X-athons’ continuity.
