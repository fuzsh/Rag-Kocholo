        "text": "Venture to Bruges, the “Venice of the north,” whenever you choose. An audio guide will take you on a tour through the city center.\n\nYou will leave our meeting point at 7:15 a.m. aboard an air-conditioned tour bus, and arrive at 11:00 a.m., just in time to explore part of the city before choosing a restaurant for lunch. Be sure to taste traditional Belgian food, such as moules-frites, carbonade flamande, Bruges pork fillet, salmon with asparagus, waffles, and other delicacies.\n\nNext, continue visiting the city at your rhythm. Stop to admire Gothic architecture in the historic medieval city center, which is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Explore picturesque city streets as you listen to audio guide commentary, downloaded to your mobile from our app. You’ll see Bruges’s most prominent monuments: The Markt, the Belfry of Bruges standing tall in the former market hall, the 13th-century Church of Our Lady and its striking red-brick tower, the Beguinage (a Benedictine monastery) and the impressive City Hall.\n\nDuring your walk, you may want to stop to visit museums that house illustrious Flemish artwork and local artisan craft. Take the time to taste local specialties such as Belgian chocolate.\n\nYou can also enjoy a cruise down the canals that flow through the city ( not included on the excursion). As you glide through the water, you can gaze out at extravagantly colored Flemish homes and take in Bruges’s quiet, mystical atmosphere.\n\nThe tour bus will leave Bruges at 4:30 p.m. and will arrive in Paris around 9:00 p.m."
