        "text": "For other places with the same name, see Paris (disambiguation).\n\nParis is a huge city with several district articles that contain information about specific sights, restaurants, and accommodation.\n\nParis, the cosmopolitan capital of France, is one of the largest agglomerations in Europe, with 2.2 million people living in the dense (105 km2) central city in 2022, 10 million people in the MÃ©tropole du Grand Paris (814 km2) and almost 13 million people living in the metropolitan area. In the centre-north of the country on the river Seine, Paris has the reputation of being the most beautiful and romantic of all cities, brimming with historic associations and remaining vastly influential in the realms of culture, art, fashion, food and design.\n\nDubbed the City of Light (la Ville lumiÃ¨re) and the City of Love, it is home to some of the world's finest and most luxurious fashion designers and cosmetics, such as Chanel, Christian Dior, Yves Saint-Laurent, Guerlain, LancÃ´me, L'OrÃ©al, and Clarins. A large part of the city, including the banks of the Seine, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city has the second highest number of Michelin-starred restaurants in the world (after Tokyo, which is much larger) and contains numerous iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, Notre-Dame de Paris, the Louvre, the Moulin Rouge and the Basilique du SacrÃ©-CÅ“ur, making it one of the most popular international tourist destinations in the world, with around 14 million tourists annually.\n\nDistricts\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city of Paris is divided into 20 districts called arrondissements, numbered from 1 to 20 in a clockwise spiral from the centre of the city (which is known as KilomÃ¨tre zÃ©ro and is located at the front of Notre Dame). Arrondissements are named according to their number. You might, for example, stay in the \"5th\", which would be written as 5e in French. The 12th and 16th arrondissements include large parks: the Bois de Vincennes and the Bois de Boulogne respectively.\n\nThe very best map you can get for Paris is called \"Paris Pratique par Arrondissement\" which you can buy for about â‚¬5 at any news stand. It makes navigating the city easy. The various tourist information centres and hotels in Paris also provide various city and metro maps for free and which contain all the essential details for a tourist.\n\nEach arrondissement has its own unique character and selection of attractions for the traveller:\n\nCentral Paris (1st arr., 2nd arr., 3rd arr., 4th arr.)\n\n1e: The geographical centre of Paris and a great starting point for travellers.

Schematically, those to the west of Paris (Neuilly-sur-Seine, Boulogne-Billancourt, Saint Cloud, Levallois, Versailles, Poissy, Rueil-Malmaison) are wealthy residential communities, even if some more middle class suburbs can be found. Those to the north are poorer communities, and very ethnically diverse. Those to the south are a mix of rough and poor neighbourhoods alongside very affluent communities. Finally, those to the east are usually lower-middle class mingled with a few upper-middle class communities.\n\nUnderstand\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to high expectations, a tight schedule, language barriers and large crowds and long lines at certain attractions during high season, the city might disappoint some visitors. Foreign visitors who have an idealized view of Paris might be shocked by the typical challenges of visiting any large city; crime, traffic noise, pollution, garbage, and relatively high costs. In the worst case, visitors might experience the Paris syndrome; a psychological state of delusion.\n\nTo enjoy the wonders of Paris, make realistic plans. The amounts of attractions and landmarks is overwhelming; visiting only the most famous ones (which can be overcrowded during major holidays) takes more than a week. The city also has more to offer for people who take time for a calm stroll along the backstreets. If your time in the city is short, be selective, and save some attractions for your next visit.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nParis started life as the Celto-Roman settlement of Lutetia on the ÃŽle de la CitÃ©, the island in the Seine now occupied by the CathÃ©drale de Notre Dame. It takes its present name from the name of the dominant Gallo-Celtic tribe in the region, the Parisii. At least that's what the Romans called them, when they showed up in 52 BCE and established their city Lutetia on the left bank of the Seine, in what is now called the \"Latin Quarter\" in the 5th arrondissement.\n\nThe Romans held out here for as long as anywhere else in the Western Empire, but by 508 CE they were gone, replaced by Clovis of the Franks, who is considered by the French to have been their first king. Clovis' descendants, aka the Carolingians, held onto the expanded Lutetian state for nearly 500 years through Viking raids and other calamities, which finally resulted in a forced move by most of the population back to the islands which had been the centre of the original Celtic village. The Capetian Duke of Paris was voted to succeed the last of the Carolingians as King of France, ensuring the city a premier position in the medieval world. Over the next several centuries Paris expanded onto the right bank into what was and is still called le Marais (The Marsh). Quite a few buildings from this time can be seen in the 4th arrondissement.\n\nThe medieval period also witnessed the founding of the Sorbonne. As the \"University of Paris\", it became one of the most important centres for learning in Europeâ€”if not the whole world, for several hundred years. Most of the institutions that still constitute the University are found in the 5th, and 13th arrondissements.\n\nIn the late 18th century, there was a period of political and social upheaval in France and Europe, during which the French governmental structure, previously a monarchy with feudal privileges for the aristocracy and Catholic clergy, underwent radical change to forms based on Enlightenment principles of nationalism, citizenship, and inalienable rights. Notable events during and following the revolution were the storming of the Bastille 4th arrondissements, and the rise and fall of Napoleonic France. Out of the violent turmoil that was the French Revolution, sparked by the still known Passion des FranÃ§ais, emerged the enlightened modern day France.\n\nThe Paris of today was built long after the Capetian and later the Bourbon Kings of France made their mark on Paris with the Louvre and the Palais Royal, both in the 1st. In the 19th century, Baron von Hausmann set about reconstructing the city, by adding the long straight avenues and replacing many of the then existing medieval houses, with grander and more uniform buildings.\n\nNew wonders arrived during La Belle Ã‰poque, as the Parisian golden age of the late 19th century is known. Gustave Eiffel's famous tower, the first metro lines, most of the parks, and the streetlights (which are partly believed to have given the city its epithet \"the city of light\") all come from this period. Another source of the epithet comes from Ville LumiÃ¨re, a reference not only to the revolutionary electrical lighting system implemented in the streets of Paris, but also to the prominence and aura of Enlightenment the city gained in that era.\n\nThe twentieth century was hard on Paris, but thankfully not as hard as it could have been. Both world wars took a heavy toll on the city's inhabitants, but at least Hitler's order to burn the city was ignored by the German General von Choltitz, who was quite possibly convinced by a Swedish diplomat that it would be better to surrender and be remembered as the saviour of Paris, rather than its destroyer. Following the war, the city recovered quickly at first, but slowed in the 1970s and 1980s when Paris began to experience some of the problems faced by big cities everywhere: pollution, housing shortages, and occasionally failed experiments in urban renewal.\n\nHowever, post-war Paris enjoyed considerable growth as a multi-cultural city, with new immigrants from all corners of the world, especially La Francophonie, including most of northern and western Africa as well as Indochina. These immigrants brought their foods and music, both of which are of prime interest for many travellers. Immigration and multi-culturalism continues in the 21st century with a marked increase in the arrival of people from Latin America, especially Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil. In the late 1990s, it was hard to find good Mexican food in Paris, whereas today there are dozens of possibilities from lowly taquerias in the outer arrondissements to nice sit-down restaurants on the boulevards.\n\nNevertheless, Paris remains a French city; bistros, baguettes, high-end fashion, art, accordions, Hausmann architecture, and all the stereotypes (whether good or bad) of France are alive and well in Paris. People from all over France flock to Paris for work, study, partying, and everything in between. After all, this IS the capital of France, so anything pertaining to France can be found here.\n\nThe 21st century has also seen vast improvements in the general livability of Paris, with the mayor's office concentrating on reducing pollution and improving facilities for soft forms of transportation including a huge network of cycle paths, larger pedestrian districts and new metro lines. Visitors who normally arrive car-less are the beneficiaries of these policies as much as the Parisians themselves, although tensions and doubts have emerged over the actual benefits of those measures.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nParis has an oceanic climate with moderately cold winters and warm summers. The moderating effect of the Atlantic Ocean helps to temper temperature extremes in much of western Europe, including France. Even in January, the coldest month, temperatures nearly always exceed the freezing point with an average high of 7 Â°C (45 Â°F). Snow is not common in Paris, although it can fall a few times per year. Most of Paris' precipitation comes in the form of light rain year-round. Daylight hours run from 08:45 until 16:45.\n\nSummers in Paris are moderately warm and humid, with an average high of 25 Â°C (77 Â°F) during the mid-summer months. Occasional heat waves can push temperatures above 30 Â°C (86 Â°F) and rarely even reach 35 Â°C (95 Â°F). The sun is up from 06:00 until almost 22:00.\n\nSpring and fall are normally cool and wet.\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nParis (PAR IATA) is served by two international airports.\n\nCharles de Gaulle International Airport (Roissy)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport\n\n(CDG IATA) is the main airport of the city. It is north of Paris and is connected by train, bus and taxi. For detailed information on arriving and departing Paris from this airport please consult the main article linked above.\n\nTransit Summary: The RER train line \"B\" connects CDG airport to central Paris and is the fastest and most economical option for most travellers. Signs in the airport will direct you to the platform. Self-serve electronic kiosks sell tickets. The kiosks provide service in multiple languages, including English. Some trains will stop at each station along the way to Paris. Express trains with fewer stops are available during off-peak hours. The stations Gare du Nord, ChÃ¢telet-Les Halles, Saint-Michel Notre-Dame, Luxembourg, Port-Royal, Denfert-Rochereau and CitÃ© Universitaire are always served. Your ticket will allow you to transfer at one of the aforementioned stations to the Metro and other RER lines within Paris to complete your journey. The one-way trip costs â‚¬10.30 for adults, â‚¬7.20 for children aged 4â€“9, and free for children under 4.\n\nAnother option is the RoissyBus coach service that departs from all terminals and travels non-stop to OpÃ©ra (actually stops at 11 rue scribe, next to Place Charles Garnier, and not on Place de l'OpÃ©ra itself) in Central Paris, within easy walking distance of several stations: OpÃ©ra for MÃ©tro Lines 3, 7, 8; Auber for RER Line A; ChaussÃ©e d'Antin or Havre-Caumartin for MÃ©tro Line 9. It offers great value if you're travelling with lots of luggage; as of December 2023, a one-way ticket is â‚¬16.20. The buses are frequent, departing every 15 min during the day and every 20-30 min in the evening. Journey time is typically 60 minutes, but can take longer in heavy traffic.\n\nIf you arrive to CDG Airport at night you'll need a Noctilien bus to get to the city centre. The bus stops at all three terminals (in terminal 2F it will be the second level in the departure section, difficult to find, but it really exists). The bus leaves every 30 min after 00:30 (see timetable). The buses you'll need are N140 and N143; the price is 2 T+ tickets (â‚¬4 if bought on board).\n\nOrly International Airport\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Paris Orly Airport\n\n(ORY IATA), this older international airport is southwest of the city and is used mainly by Air France for domestic departures, and for several international departures, mostly towards destinations around the Mediterranean. It consists of two terminals: Terminal Sud (south) and Terminal Ouest (west) connected by light rail. The airport is connected with Paris by bus and light rail. For detailed information on arriving and departing Paris from this airport please consult the main article linked above.\n\nFor most visitors, Metro Line 14 directly from the airport to Gare de Lyon (21 min) and ChÃ¢telet-Les Halles (25 min) is the cheapest, fastest and easiest way of getting to/from the city, a full-fare single ticket is â‚¬10.30 (Navigo fares are lower) and trains run every 3-5 minutes. See Paris Orly Airport for other rail options.\n\nIf you have luggage and don't want to take your chances on the train, the OrlyBus from MÃ©tro Denfert-Rochereau (lines 4 and 6 of the Metro and RER line \"B\") travels to the airport in 25-35 min in good traffic, although at rush hour travel times can be much longer. The price is â‚¬11.20 as of December 2023. There are buses every 8-15 minutes from the Orly Sud (Platform 4) and it stops at Orly Ouest on its way to the city. Tickets can be bought at a counter near the baggage claim area or directly at the counter in Platform 4. The tickets need to be validated once on the bus. Another option is tramway T7 that takes you to the MÃ©tro Villejuif - Louis Aragon (Metro 7) in 30 min, but it stops on the way and is designed for commuters and not for travellers. Tramway T7 costs a single T+ (metro/bus/tram) ticket and runs every 10 min, stopping at airport level -1. Passes covering zones 1â€“4 are accepted, except that Tickets Jeunes are not valid on Orlybus.\n\nThe Orly connection map shows you how you can go to Paris from the airport.\n\nConnect\n\n[edit]\n\nWi-Fi Internet access is provided free of charge.\n\nBeauvais (AÃ©roport de Beauvais TillÃ©)\n\n[edit]\n\n(BVA IATA), north of the city, is a smaller regional airport that is used by some low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and WizzAir. The airport operates a shuttle service to the MÃ©tro at Porte Maillot station. Buses run as early as 06:00. Buses leave 20 min after each flight arrives, and a few hours before each flight departs. A schedule can be found on the Beauvais Airport website. The journey will take about an hour in good traffic conditions, and costs â‚¬16.9 each way (Online) or â‚¬18 each way (Physically); there is no reduced price for children over the age of 2 years. Unless you hire a car this is the most realistic way to head toward Paris. The alternative is a train service between Gare du Nord and Beauvais, and a connecting shuttle or taxi to the airport. This journey costs more and takes longer. Missing the shuttle bus could mean a taxi fare well over â‚¬100.\n\nAirline shuttles\n\n[edit]\n\nAir France operates shuttles between Charles de Gaulle and Paris (â‚¬17), Orly and Paris (â‚¬12) and between the two airports (â‚¬20). Discounts apply for young/group travellers and online bookers. If you have connecting Air France flights that land and depart from different airports, you would still generally need to fetch your luggage after landing, catch either the Air France shuttle or a taxi (readily available at all airports) to the other airport and check-in again. This altogether could take up to 2 hours, particularly if traffic is at its worst. It is also common to lose time during disembarking, as passengers often need to get off on the tarmac and get on buses which will take them to the terminal. Be sure you have sufficient time between flights to catch your connection. Check-in counters usually close 30 min before the flight departs, longer if flights are international.\n\nPrivate aviation\n\n[edit]\n\nParis Le Bourget Airport (LBG IATA) is a 24-hour airport for private jets and business aviation 11 km northeast of Paris. Companies like Air Charter Advisors and Priority Jet offer access to a variety of aircraft rentals based at Le Bourget.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Rail travel in France\n\nParis is well connected to the rest of Europe by train. There are seven terminus stations in central Paris and although they are not all in the same district, they are all connected to the Metro and RER networks. You will probably want to know in advance at which station your train is arriving, so as to better choose a hotel and plan for transport within the city.\n\n, (10th), MÃ©tro: Gare du Nord - TGV trains to and from northern France (Lille, Amiens, Lens...), Thalys trains to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia), and Eurostar to the United Kingdom (London).\n\n, (13th), MÃ©tro: Gare d'Austerlitz - regular trains to and from the center and southwest of France (OrlÃ©ans, Limoges, Toulouse the long way) and the majority of night trains.\n\n, (10th), MÃ©tro: Gare de l'Est - TGV to and from the Grand Est region (Strasbourg, Reims, Nancy, etc.), Luxembourg, ICE/TGV to and from south Germany (SaarbrÃ¼cken, Kaiserslautern, Mannheim, Frankfurt, Karlsruhe, Stuttgart, Augsburg, and Munich), Ã–BB Nightjet night trains to Germany (Karlsruhe, Munich) and Austria (Salzburg, Vienna)\n\n, (12th), MÃ©tro: Gare de Lyon - regular and TGV trains to and from southern and eastern France: French Alps, Marseille, Lyon, Dijon, Switzerland (Basel, Geneva, Lausanne, Bern, Zurich), southwest Germany (Freiburg im Breisgau), and Italy (Turin, Milan).\n\n, (12th), MÃ©tro: Bercy. Regular trains to Auvergne and Burgundy.\n\n, (8th) MÃ©tro: St-Lazare - trains to and from Basse-Normandie, Haute-Normandie.\n\n, (15th), MÃ©tro: Montparnasse-BienvenÃ¼e - TGV and regular trains to and from the west and south-west of France (Tours, Brest, Rennes, Nantes, Bordeaux, Toulouse the fastest way, Hendaye). Gare Vaugirard is an extension of Gare Montparnasse.\n\nThe SNCF (French national railway authority) operates practically all trains within France excluding the Eurostar to London, the Thalys to Brussels and onward to the Netherlands and Germany[dead link] , and some low-cost services such as Ouigo (although owned by the SNCF, it is considered as a separate brand). There are also a few local lines of high interest to tourists which are privately owned. All SNCF, Eurostar and Thalys tickets can be bought in railway stations, city offices and travel agencies (no surcharge). SNCF relies on travel agencies for selling tickets online, the main one being SNCF Connect and Trainline (easier to use). You can also find tickets in online and physical travel agencies. You can book and buy tickets up to three months in advance. There are significant discounts if you book weeks ahead. Reduced ticket prices are different for each day and each train and can be used only on the train the reservation is for. Trains between Paris and south Germany (Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Munich) as well as the Marseille-Frankfurt TGV are jointly operated by SNCF and Deutsche Bahn, but each of the two operators will sell tickets at its own price! Make sure to check the price offered by each operator before you buy, or use Trainline since they automatically compare SNCF and DB prices.\n\nSee also: Rail travel in Europe\n\nThere are a number of different kinds of high-speed and normal trains:\n\nTER: The regional trains (Train Express RÃ©gional); cheapest tickets, though prices are variable on the time of day of departure (and the day of departure as well). TER are sometimes slower, stopping at almost all stations. TER tickets bought at the train station are valid two months from the date indicated on the ticket, as long as you travel in the right fare period (\"pÃ©riode bleue\", the cheapest, \"pÃ©riode blanche\", for high-demand hours). There is no seat reservation, so arrive early enough or you may have to travel without a seat.\n\nIntercitÃ©s: A bundling of the former IntercitÃ©s, TÃ©oz, and LunÃ©a train categories. There are two kinds: the regular trains, which are priced the same as the TER and the trains you'll find yourself on if you have a Eurail or InterRail pass and don't want to pay extra for reservations, and the trains Ã  rÃ©servation obligatoire, which require a reservation and are priced differently from the regular IntercitÃ©s trains.\n\nIntercitÃ©s de nuit: Overnight trains from destinations to and from south of France, including Latour-de-Carol, Lourdes and CerbÃ¨re via Toulouse.\n\nTGV: The world-famous French high-speed trains (Trains Ã  Grande Vitesse) run very frequently to the southeast Nice (5-6 hr), Marseille (3 hr) and Avignon (2.5 hr), the east Geneva (3hr) or Lausanne, Switzerland, Dijon (1 hr 15 min) and Strasbourg (1 hr 45 min), the southwest Bordeaux (3 hr), the west Rennes (2 hr) and the north Lille (1 hr). Thalys to Brussels (1 hr 20 min) use almost identical trains. Reservations are obligatory.\n\nICE: German high-speed trains, operating most services between Paris and Frankfurt.\n\nThalys: A high-speed train service running daily to/from the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Though it can be a bit expensive compared to normal trains, tickets can be cheap enough if you buy in advance. On-board service is usually very good.\n\nEurostar: The Eurostar service connects Paris with London St. Pancras directly and Brussels indirectly, as well as many other destinations indirectly through the various west European rail services. Travel time between Paris Gare du Nord and London St Pancras International averages 2hr 15 min. Eurail and InterRail passes are not valid for this train, though pass holders can benefit from a reduced price. You must arrive at the station at least 90 minutes, and up to two hours, before the departure of the train to complete security and passport controls.\n\nOuigo: A subsidiary of SNCF running TGVs with a second class only layout intended and marketed as a lower-cost service. Strict baggage limits and 30-minute check in times make them more like budget airlines.\n\nTrenitalia: Operates high-speed Frecciarossa trains between Paris, Lyon, ChambÃ©ry, Modane, Turin, and Milan. Prices can be cheaper than SNCF, Trainline automatically compares both options.\n\nTransfer between train stations\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom Gare d'Austerlitz\n\n[edit]\n\nGare d'Austerlitz â€“ Gare de Bercy (15 min): Bus 24 to Ã‰cole VÃ©tÃ©rinaire de Maisons-Alfort.\n\nGare d'Austerlitz â€“ Gare de l'Est (20 min): 5 , direction Bobigny.\n\nGare d'Austerlitz â€“ Gare Montparnasse (25 min): 10 direction Boulogne, change at OdÃ©on for 4 direction Mairie de Montrouge.

It is a good option when coming from the shopping area near boulevard Montparnasse.)\n\nGare Saint-Lazare â€“ Gare du Nord (15 min): RER E direction Chellesâ€“Gournay, Villiers-sur-Marne or Tournan; alternatively (slower, less walking, but more stairs) 3 direction Gallieni and change at Strasbourg-Saint-Denis for 4 direction Porte de Clignancourt.\n\nFrom Gare de Bercy\n\n[edit]\n\nFor most train stations, take the 14 to Gare de Lyon and follow the directions given from Gare de Lyon.\n\nGare de Bercy â€“ Gare d'Austerlitz (15 min): bus 24 towards gare Saint-Lazare.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile domestic bus lines were tightly regulated until 2015, they no longer are, and this has led to a heavily competitive and fast growing market. Companies that serve Paris are:\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral autoroutes (expressway, motorway) link Paris with the rest of France: and to the north, and to the south, to the east and and to the west. Not surprisingly, traffic jams are significantly worse during French school holidays.\n\nThe multi-lane highway around Paris, called the PÃ©riphÃ©rique (BP), is probably preferable to driving through the center. Another beltway nearing completion; L'A86 (also and A286) loops around Paris about 10 km further out from the PÃ©riphÃ©rique. A third, incomplete beltway is much further out and called La Francilienne (N104).\n\nIt is advised not to drive within Paris and to be wary in the metropolitan area. It is better to drive to a suburban train station with a parking lot and then use the train to continue your trip throughout Paris. Most of Paris' roads were created long before the invention of automobiles. Traffic inside the city tends to be heavy, especially at rush hour; driving, however, may be rather easy and efficient in the evening. Parking is also difficult. Furthermore, the medieval nature of parts of the city's street system makes it very confusing, and traffic will almost never allow one to stop or slow down to get one's bearings. If you are unfamiliar with the streets and still insist on driving in the city, make sure you have a navigator in the passenger seat with you. However, Paris does have several iconic boulevards that have multiple lanes, form the backbone of the cityâ€™s road network, and are useful if you do choose to bring a car â€” and are tourist attractions onto themselves.\n\nIn Paris, there are many car rental agencies offering a large number and wide range of vehicles for rental. Additionally, there are numerous car rental agencies located off-site which provide free airport transfers from their location and may offer lower prices well.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nParis walking 101\n\nTo get a great orientation of the city on foot while seeing many of Paris' major sights, you can do a West to East walk along the Axe Historique from the Arc de Triomphe to ÃŽle de la CitÃ© (Notre Dame). This walk takes about 1-2 hours without any stops. Start at the top of the Champs ElysÃ©es (at the Arc de Triomphe) and begin walking down the Champs ElysÃ©es towards Place ('square') de la Concorde.\n\nOn the way towards the obelisk on the square, you'll see the major stores and restaurants of Paris' most famous avenue.\n\nOnce you've passed the main shopping area, you'll see the Petit Palais and the Grand Palais to your right.\n\nAt Place de la Concorde, you'll be able to see many of Paris' major monuments around you. In front of you is the Tuileries, behind you is the Champs-Elysees and Arc de Triomphe, behind you to your right is the Tour Eiffel and Musee d'Orsay, and finally, to your left is the Madeleine.\n\nContinue straight ahead and enter the Tuileries Gardens passing by fountains, flowers, and lovers in the park.\n\nAs you continue straight ahead, and out of the garden, you'll see the pyramid entrance to the Louvre directly in front of you.\n\nWith the pyramid directly in front of you, and the Tuileries directly behind you, turn to your right and walk towards the Seine.\n\nNow you can walk along the Seine (eastwards) until you reach Pont Neuf. Cross Pont Neuf and walk through the Latin Quarter, cross the river again to reach Notre Dame cathedral on Ile de la CitÃ©.\n\nWalking in Paris is one of the great pleasures of visiting the City of Light. It is possible to cross the entire city in only a few hours, but only if you can somehow keep yourself from stopping at numerous cafÃ©s and shops. In fact within a few years walking combined with biking and the Metro may be the only way to get around the very centre of Paris as plans develop to reduce access to cars in the city centre.\n\nThe smartest travellers take advantage of the walk-ability of this city, and stay above ground as much as possible. A metro ride of less than 2 stops is probably best avoided since walking will take about the same amount of time and you'll be able to see more of the city. That said, pay attention to the MÃ©tro stations that you may pass by on your journey; the MÃ©tro network is very dense within the city and the lines are virtually always located directly underneath major boulevards, so if you become lost it is easy to regain your bearings by walking along a major boulevard until you find a MÃ©tro station.\n\nYou may have heard of the hazard of walking into dog droppings in Paris. The problem is now virtually nonexistent due to fines as high as â‚¬180 and extensive street cleaning operations.\n\nIt's always fun to experience the city by foot, and there are numerous walking tours around Paris, whether self-guided (with the help of a guidebook or online guide) or with a touring guide (booked through your travel agency or hotel). The city is best explored by foot, and some of the most marvelous memories you will have of Paris is walking through secret found places.\n\nPedestrian call buttons at crosswalks are activated by pressing the button underneath the call button box.\n\nBy public transport\n\n[edit]\n\nParis has an excellent underground train system, known as the MÃ©tro (short for Chemin de fer mÃ©tropolitain, Metropolitan Railway). Although you will probably take the RER suburban train from the airport to Paris, don't be confused: RER is a French-language acronym that translates to \"Regional Express Network,\" and is the suburban train network mostly used by commuters. The MÃ©tro and RER are complemented by tram and bus.\n\nRATP operates the MÃ©tro, buses, and about half of the RER A and B. SNCF operates the rest of the RER, as well as Transilien. Both companies take the same tickets, so the difference is of little interest for most people except in case of strikes. For example, RATP may strike without SNCF doing so or the other way around. You will see references to ÃŽle-de-France MobilitÃ©s, the authority that controls and coordinates the different transport companies operating in the ÃŽle-de-France region, which includes Paris. It provides information for all public transport services operating in the region including all ticket options.\n\nThe MÃ©tro and RER move staggering numbers of people into, out of, and around Paris (6.75 million people per day on average), and most of the time in reasonable comfort. However, certain lines are operating at or near capacity, sometimes being so full that you'll have to let one or two trains pass before being able to board. If you can help it, avoid MÃ©tro lines 1, 4, and 13 and RER line A and B during rush hours as these are the most congested lines in the system.\n\nStrikes, breakdown and construction are regular occurrences on the Paris public transit system. Generally during a strike, the MÃ©tro operates with reduced service and some suburban lines may stop operating altogether. Visit the RATP website for information on which routes are affected. Beware that real-time traffic information and construction announcements are often available only on the French-language version.\n\nBy metro\n\n[edit]\n\nLook for the MÃ©tro stations, marked with a large \"M\" sign or with an old-styled sign saying \"MÃ©tropolitain\".\n\nThere are 17 MÃ©tro lines (lignes) (1-14, 3bis, and 7bis) on which trains travel all day at intervals of a few minutes. Trains usually come 2â€“3 minutes apart during rush hour and 5â€“10 minutes apart during other times, depending on the line. The service starts on each end of every line at 05:30, and the last metro arrives on each end at 01:15 (service ends an hour later on Friday and Saturday nights, and the day before a holiday), stopping at all stations on the line. Some lines have rare trains that terminate at an intermediate station; if that happens, get off the train with the rest of the crowd and board the next train on the same track or on the other side of the platform (the driver will usually make an announcement in French). Lines 7 and 13 have a fork, so if you take line 13 north of La Fourche or line 7 south of Maison Blanche, make sure to board the train for the correct destination which is indicated by a lit arrow on the sign in the middle of the platform and on colour-coded binders in each carriage. Times for trains can be seen on an electronic scroll board above the platform. Scheduled times for first and last trains are posted in each station on the centre sign. Generally, except for early and late hours, travellers should not worry about specific Metro train times; just get to your station and take the next train.\n\nThe lines are named according to the names of their terminal stations (the end of the line). If you ask the locals about directions, they will answer something like: take line number n towards \"end station 1\", change at \"station\", take the line nn towards \"end station 2\" etc. The lines are also colour-coded.\n\nChanging metro lines might be difficult at times for visitors travelling to or from the airport or train stations with heavy luggage or those with impaired mobility, especially at major metro intersections. Moving from one platform to another generally involves walking up and down multiple flights of stairs. Very few stations have elevators (only the newest line 14 is wheelchair-accessible at all stations). Only the busiest ones have escalators. It might be a good idea to check out the bus routes and timings and see if one can find a convenient bus connection.\n\nEach station displays a detailed map of the surrounding area with a street list and the location of buildings (monuments, schools, places of worship, etc.,) as well as exits for that particular metro. Maps are located on the platform if the station has several exits or near the exit if there is only one exit.\n\nExcept for MÃ©tro 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 13, and 14, the doors will not open automatically. In such a case, there are handles or buttons located both inside and outside the train that you have to push or unlatch in order to open the door. Many locals may try to squeeze into the trains after the alarm has sounded to signal the closing of the doors. While one can occasionally pass through on lines with a driver, the automatic doors on MÃ©tro 1 and 14 will continue to close despite the presence of a limb or article of clothing. It is strongly advised to wait for the second train than to chance being caught between the doors.\n\nSome larger stations have secondary entrances, where there is no ticket booth. These are labelled voyageurs munis de billets (passengers with tickets).\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are five commuter train lines that cross Paris: RER A, B, C, D, and E. RER trains run at intervals varying from about 3 minutes (RER A) to 6 minutes (RER D), and stop at every station within Paris. Trains can run up to every 5 minutes during rush hour, and you will never have to wait for more than 1 hour between two trains, even on the least served lines in the evening or on the weekend.\n\nRER trains will stop at every station within Paris (zone 1), but may skip stations outside Paris, so if you're going to the suburbs make sure your RER stops where you need! Information about the stops to be made by the next incoming train is presented on a separate board also hanging from the ceiling.\n\nRER trains do not have publicly announced numbers unlike the rest of SNCF network; the four letter codes (COHI, ELAO, QYAN, VICK, etc.) take the role of the train numbers instead; the first letter indicates the station where the train terminates, and the other three indicate the route and stops. Each line has its own nomenclature. You can look up what these codes mean on information panels in the station, but the easiest and fastest way is often to check the information screens along the platforms.\n\nThe rest of the regional network, called \"Transilien\", departs from the main train stations (Lyon for line R, Est for line P, Nord for lines H and K, St-Lazare for lines J and L, Montparnasse for line N) and La DÃ©fense (line U). Trains can run up to every 5 minutes during rush hour, and you will never have to wait for more than 1 hour between two trains, even on the least served lines in the evening or on the weekend. The Transilien is marginally less crowded than the RER and the Metro.\n\nBy tram\n\n[edit]\n\nMost tourists will not encounter the trams as they run only on the outskirts of the city. Trams T3a & T3b go nearly three quarters of the way round the city at the edge. Tram line 7 connects Orly Airport with MÃ©tro line 7; it is cheap but not fast.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nA bus ride is interesting if you want to see more of the city. All stops have a name and are clearly marked on the street. At complex intersections, stops usually have a map that lets you know where other lines stop and if applicable where to find a MÃ©tro entrance. If more than one line stops, wave to the driver to let them know you want to board. All buses have a schematic map of the line on display with all stop names, bus connections and major street names. Electronic displays inside each bus tell riders its current position and what stops remain, but don't overly rely on them as they don't always work.\n\nSince the MÃ©tro is primarily structured around a hub-and-spoke model, there are some journeys for which it can be quite inefficient. In these cases it is worth seeing if a direct bus route exists, despite the complexity of the bus network.\n\nNoctilien, night buses run regularly through the central hub at Chatelet to outlying areas of greater Paris. There is also a circle line connecting the main train stations. It pays to know one's Noctilien route ahead of time in case one misses the last MÃ©tro home. Women travellers should probably avoid taking the Noctilien on their own to destinations outside Paris.\n\nFares\n\n[edit]\n\nThe ÃŽle-de-France region is divided into five concentric zones for fare purposes. Paris city centre is in zone 1, Saint-Denis and Vincennes are in zone 2, La DÃ©fense is in zone 3, Orly airport and Versailles are in zone 4, and Charles de Gaulle airport, Disneyland, Fontainebleau and Provins are in zone 5. Destinations beyond zone 5 are subject to separate fares. The limit of zone 1 is shown on public transport maps as a line break with a \"Êƒ\" symbol.\n\nThe following fares are available:\n\nFares within ÃŽle-de-France Fare in English Fare in French Price Validity Rules Ticket t+ Single Ticket t+ Ã€ l'unitÃ© â‚¬2.15 Metro\n\nRER/Transilien\n\nTram\n\nBus\n\nMontmartre Funicular\n\nValid for 90 minutes\n\nMetro/RER/Transilien transfers are free\n\nTram/Bus transfers are free\n\nExcludes Metro to/from Orly Airport\n\nExcludes RER/Transilien beyond zone 1\n\nTicket t+ Book of 10 Ticket t+ Carnet de 10 â‚¬17.35 (â‚¬1.73 each) Metro\n\nRER/Transilien\n\nTram\n\nBus\n\nMontmartre Funicular\n\nValid for 90 minutes\n\nMetro/RER/Transilien transfers are free\n\nTram/Bus transfers are free\n\nExcludes Metro to/from Orly Airport\n\nExcludes RER/Transilien beyond zone 1\n\nOrigin-Destination TicketSingle Billet Origine-Destination Ã€ l'unitÃ© Varies (capped at â‚¬5) Metro\n\nRER/Transilien\n\nExpress Tram\n\nValid for 120 minutes\n\nTransfers are free\n\nOrigin-Destination TicketBook of 10 Billet Origine-Destination Carnet de 10 Varies (capped at â‚¬40) Metro\n\nRER/Transilien\n\nExpress Tram\n\nValid for 120 minutes\n\nTransfers are free\n\nDay Ticket Forfait Jour â‚¬8.65 (two zones)\n\nâ‚¬11.60 (three zones)\n\nâ‚¬14.35 (four zones)\n\nâ‚¬20.60 (five zones)\n\nMetro\n\nRER/Transilien\n\nTram\n\nExpress Tram\n\nBus\n\nValid any day Weekly Ticket Forfait Semaine â‚¬30.75 (zones 1-5) Metro\n\nRER/Transilien\n\nTram\n\nExpress Tram\n\nBus\n\nValid from Monday to Sunday\n\nAvailable from Friday to Thursday only\n\nMonthly Ticket Forfait Mois â‚¬86.40 (zones 1-5) Metro\n\nRER/Transilien\n\nTram\n\nExpress Tram\n\nBus\n\nValid from 1st to end of month\n\nAvailable from 20th to 19th only\n\nYouth Weekend Ticket Forfait Jeunes Week-end â‚¬4.70 (zones 1-3)\n\nâ‚¬6.05 (zones 3-5)\n\nâ‚¬10.35 (zones 1-5)\n\nMetro\n\nRER/Transilien\n\nTram\n\nExpress Tram\n\nBus\n\nValid for persons under 26 years of age\n\nValid any Saturday/Sunday/Public Holiday\n\nCharles de Gaulle Airport Ticket Billet AÃ©roport Charles de Gaulle â‚¬11.80 Metro\n\nRER/Transilien\n\nExpress Tram\n\nValid to/from Charles de Gaulle Airport only\n\nTransfers are free\n\nOrly Airport Ticket Billet AÃ©roport Orly â‚¬10.30 Metro\n\nRER/Transilien\n\nExpress Tram\n\nValid to/from Orly Airport only\n\nTransfers are free\n\nRoissyBus Ticket Billet RoissyBus â‚¬16.60 RoissyBus Valid to/from Charles de Gaulle Airport only OrlyBus Ticket Billet OrlyBus â‚¬11.50 OrlyBus Valid to/from Orly Airport only\n\nNavigo smart cards\n\n[edit]\n\nNavigo smart cards are used to carry fares. The cards differ from others around the world (e.g. OMNY, Oyster or Suica) in that they're loaded with specific fares instead of monetary value. The cards need to be validated at the start of a journey or when boarding a new tram or bus. The cards do not need to be validated at the end of a journey unless required to exit the gates.\n\nThe following Navigo smart cards are available:\n\nNavigo smart cards within ÃŽle-de-France Navigo in English Navigo in French Price Locations to purchase/load Fares available to load Navigo Easy Travel Card Navigo Easy â‚¬2 Ticket Windows\n\nTicket Machines\n\nCredit cards and cash accepted\n\nNo ID/passport photo required\n\nTicket t+\n\nOrigin-Destination Tickets (coming soon)\n\nDay Ticket\n\nYouth Weekend Ticket\n\nCharles de Gaulle Airport Ticket\n\nOrly Airport Ticket\n\nRoissyBus Ticket\n\nOrlyBus Ticket\n\nNavigo on iPhone Navigo sur iPhone Free ÃŽle-de-France MobilitÃ©sapp\n\nApple Wallet app\n\nTicket t+\n\nOrigin-Destination Tickets (coming soon)\n\nDay Ticket\n\nWeekly Ticket (IdFM app only)\n\nMonthly Ticket (IdFM app only)\n\nYouth Weekend Ticket (IdFM app only)\n\nCharles de Gaulle Airport Ticket\n\nOrly Airport Ticket\n\nRoissyBus Ticket\n\nOrlyBus Ticket\n\nNavigo on Android Navigo sur Android Free ÃŽle-de-France MobilitÃ©sapp Ticket t+\n\nOrigin-Destination Tickets (coming soon)\n\nDay Ticket\n\nWeekly Ticket\n\nMonthly Ticket\n\nYouth Weekend Ticket\n\nCharles de Gaulle Airport Ticket\n\nOrly Airport Ticket\n\nRoissyBus Ticket\n\nOrlyBus Ticket\n\nPaper tickets\n\n[edit]\n\nPaper tickets are being phased out in favour of Navigo smart cards.\n\nThe following paper tickets are still available: Ticket t+ Single, Origin-Destination Ticket Single, Origin-Destination Ticket Book of 10, RoissyBus Ticket and OrlyBus Ticket.\n\nTravelling without a ticket will get you fined and the packs of inspectors who roam the system show no mercy to tourists pleading ignorance. Keep your ticket with you at all times as you may be checked. You will be cited and forced to pay on the spot if you do not have a ticket. The most likely spots for being checked are just behind the turnstiles at major metro stations or during interchanges. Inspectors may be present even on Sunday nights.\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are several excellent boat services which make use of the Seine. As well as providing easy, cheap transport to much of central Paris, excellent photo opportunities abound. You can buy a day or 3 day ticket and hop on and off the boat as needed. The boats take a circular route from the Eiffel Tower, down past the Louvre, Notre Dame, botanical gardens then back up the other bank past MusÃ©e d'Orsay. Batobus offers a regular shuttle service between the main tourist sights (closed Jan); other companies such as the famous Bateaux Mouches offer sightseeing cruises.\n\nBy bicycle\n\n[edit]\n\nRenting a bike is a very good alternative over driving or using public transport and an excellent way to see the sights. Riding a bike anywhere in the city is far safer for the moderately experienced cyclists than almost any town or city in the United States. The French are very cognizant of cyclists, almost to a point of reverence. Paris hasn't always been the easiest place to get around by bike, but that is no longer the case. The city government has taken a number of steps in strong support of improving the safety and efficiency of the urban cyclist as well, in establishing some separated bike lanes, creating a bikesharing system, and allowing cyclists to share the ample bus lanes on most major boulevards. Paris also has many riverside paths which are perfect for cycling. The Paris bike network now counts over 150 km of either unique or shared lanes for the cyclist. In addition, the narrower, medieval side streets of the central arrondissements make for rather scenic and leisurely cycling, especially during off-hours of the day when traffic is lighter. Do remember to bring a good map, since there is no grid plan to speak of and almost all of the smaller streets are one-way.\n\nWhile the streets of Paris are generally fairly easy on novice cyclists, there are some streets in the city that should be avoided by those who do not have sufficient urban cycling experience. Rue de Rivoli, Place de la Bastille, and Place de la Nation are particularly hairy, especially during weekdays and the Saturday evening rush, and should not be navigated by anyone not confident in their ability to cycle in heavy traffic. Avenue des Champs-ElysÃ©es, Place de l'Ã‰toile, and voie Georges Pompidou (the lower-level express lanes along the banks of the Seine) should be avoided at all times.\n\nYou can find an excellent map of the bike network called Paris Ã  vÃ©lo - Le bon plan[dead link] ) at the information centre in the HÃ´tel de Ville.\n\nYou can purchase the VÃ©lib pass online. An app helps finding stations and available parking slots. Green VÃ©lib bikes are normal bikes, blue VÃ©libs are ebikes.\n\nBy scooter\n\n[edit]\n\nLike many cities, Paris was in 2018 more or less flooded with free-floating electric scooters which you can rent through an app. You'll find them whizzing around and standing nearly everywhere. Examples include Bird and Lime, but several other brands are also available. If you take one, make sure to park it in a place where it doesn't obstruct any other foot or motorized traffic.\n\nBy motorbike\n\n[edit]\n\nParis is an incredibly open city, with its many \"Grands Boulevards\" and monuments with large open spaces around make it a city perfect to be explored and viewed by scooter or motorbike. Be warned that scooter/motorbike is by far the mode of transportation with the most casualties in Paris: half of victims of a collision were riding one, although they only account for about 2% of the traffic. When you're riding a scooter or motorbike in Paris, even if you see others doing so, it is not allowed to \"lane-split\" between the rows of cars waiting in traffic. At the red lights, even though a lot of scooter and motorbike drivers do not respect it, don't forget to pay attention to the bike designated area: you are not allowed to use them, and doing so is equivalent to failing to respect the red light (â‚¬135 fine). Parking-wise there are plenty of deux roues (two wheel) parking spots all over the city. Again, even though you may see plenty of scooters or motorbikes parked on the sidewalk, it is forbidden to do so. The city of Paris has dramatically increased the number of vehicles fined every day (â‚¬35), some of them even being towed away (at your own expenses).\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a word: don't. It is generally a very bad idea to rent a car to visit Paris. Traffic is very dense during the day, and parking is, on average, exceedingly difficult and expensive. This is especially true in areas surrounding points of interest, since many of these are in areas designed long before automobiles existed. A majority of Parisian households do not own cars, and many people who move to the city find themselves selling their cars within a month or two.\n\nThat said, driving may be an option for going to some sights in the suburbs such as Vaux-le-Vicomte castle or the castle and city at Fontainebleau, or for starting to other places in France. You may prefer to rent from a location outside Paris proper.\n\nTraffic rules in Paris are basically the same as elsewhere in France, with the exception of having to yield to incoming traffic on roundabouts. However, driving in dense traffic in Paris and suburbs during commute times, can be especially strenuous. Be prepared for traffic jams, cars changing lanes at short notice, and so on. Another issue is pedestrians, who tend to fearlessly jaywalk more in Paris than in other French cities. Be prepared for pedestrians crossing the street on red, and expect similar adventurous behaviour from cyclists. Remember that even if a pedestrian or cyclist crossed on red, if you hit him, you (in fact, your insurance) will have to bear civil responsibility for the damages, and possibly prosecution for failing to control your vehicle. Note that the speed limit in Paris is 30 km/h in almost every street, besides a few large avenues clearly marked as such. There are no stop signs in the city center.\n\nParis has several orbital roads. There is a series of boulevards named after Napoleonic-era generals (Boulevard MassÃ©na, Boulevard Ney, and so forth), and collectively referred to as boulevards des MarÃ©chaux. These are normal wide avenues, with traffic lights. Somewhat outside of these is the boulevard pÃ©riphÃ©rique, a controlled-access road with grade separation. The pÃ©riphÃ©rique intÃ©rieur is the inner lanes (going clockwise), the pÃ©riphÃ©rique extÃ©rieur the outer lanes (going anti-clockwise). Despite the looks, the pÃ©riphÃ©rique is not an autoroute: the speed limit is 70 km/h and, very unusually, incoming traffic has the right of way, at least theoretically (presumably because, otherwise, nobody would be able to enter during rush hour).\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nTaxis are comparatively cheap especially at night when there are no traffic jams to be expected. There are not as many as one would expect, and sometimes finding a taxi can be challenging. In the daytime, it is not always a good idea to take a taxi, as walking or taking the metro (See: MÃ©tro) will often be faster. If you know you will need one to get to the airport, or to a meeting, it is wise to book ahead by phone.\n\nThe initial fare is â‚¬2.40 and the meter increases by around â‚¬1.10 each kilometer and around 50 cents each minute spent at red lights or in traffic jams. Fares are fixed by the city law and every driver complies with them. Fares vary according to the day of the week, the hour of the day and the area you're crossing.\n\nIf you call a taxi, the meter starts when you call and not when you get in. You should expect a â‚¬5 to â‚¬10 fare on the meter when the taxi arrives after you call it.\n\nRemember if a taxi is near a 'taxi station', they're not supposed to pick you up except at the station where there may be people waiting for a taxi. Taxi stations are usually near train stations, big hotels, hospitals, and large crossings.\n\nThere are a number of services by which you can call for taxis or make a reservation in advance. The two largest fleet are Taxis G7 and Taxis Bleus:\n\nAs in many other cities a taxi can be difficult to stop; you may have to try several times. When you do get a taxi to stop, the driver will usually roll down his window to ask you where you want to go. If the driver can't (or doesn't want to) go where you want, he might tell you that he's near the end of his work day & can't possibly get you where you want before he has to go off-duty.\n\nThere is a â‚¬6.40 minimum (2012) on all taxi rides, mandated by city law, but the meter does not show this amount, which can result in being asked to pay more than the metered amount on short rides. In Paris taxis are required by law to charge for the trip with a meter, charging a flat rate is illegal, except from/to Charles de Gaulle airport (â‚¬50 from the right bank of the Seine, â‚¬55 from the left bank) and Orly airport (â‚¬35 from the right bank, â‚¬30 from the left bank). Frequently the taxi driver will not want to drive you all the way to the doorstep, but will prefer to let you out a block or so away if there are one or more one-way streets to contend with. Try to look at this as a cost-savings rather than an inconvenience. You should pay while still seated in the cab as in New York and not through the front window London style.\n\nThe driver will not let you sit in the front seat (unless there are 3 or 4 of you, which is a rare case usually expedited by more money). Taxi-drivers come in all types, some nice, some rude, some wanting to chat, some not. Smoking in taxis is generally not allowed, however it might be that the taxi driver himself wants a cigarette in which case the rule might become flexible.\n\nMany drivers prefer that you avoid using your cellphone during the ride; if you do have to, make an apologizing gesture & sound, and do make a short call.\n\nA tip is included in the fare price; If you're especially satisfied with the service, you can give something (basically 10%), but you don't have to.\n\nThere is an extra charge for baggage handling.\n\nIf for any reason you wish to file a complaint about a Paris taxi, take note of the taxi's number on the sticker on the left hand backseat window.\n\nBeware of illegal taxis (see the 'Stay Safe' section).\n\nBy chauffeur\n\n[edit]\n\nKnown as car services or livery cabs, these cars are not allowed to cruise the street or airports for fares. You need to book them before they can pick you up. They are flat rate rather than metered (ask for the fare before getting in), and there are two types of licence: the \"Grande Remise\" that allows the car & driver to pick-up & drop-off passengers anywhere in France, and the \"carte verte\" that allows pick-up & drop-off in the department or region where the company is based. The Grande Remise cars have a GR on their front plate. They provide more service than a normal cab.\n\nYou can find two kinds of cab: private and shared.\n\nShared shuttle: You have to share the shuttle with other customers. They can be delayed since the shuttle needs to pick up other customers and perhaps drop them off before you, but they are cheaper than a private shuttle.\n\nPrivate shuttle: Will pick you up on-time and drop you off directly to the address specified in the booking.\n\nWith children\n\n[edit]\n\nMetro and bus. The metro and buses are free for children under the age of 4. Older kids (4-9) can buy a carnet (a collection of 10 tickets) at half-price for discounted travel. Other passes, including the Paris-Vistes pass for unlimited travel over 1 to 5 days are also available at half-price for children below 9 years of age.\n\nTaxis. Parisian taxis tend to be standard cars (sedans or minivans) so almost all strollers will need to be folded and placed in the trunk. Be aware that taxi drivers are proud of their cars and keep them very clean and are not big fans of messy kids.\n\nVTC. All strollers will need to be folded and placed in the trunk. VTC provide you all the safety equipment for your children (baby seats and boosters).\n\nWith baggage\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen you are visiting Paris, you may need to store your luggage. You can find luggage storage in every big railway station.\n\nTalk\n\n[edit]\n\nFrench (franÃ§ais) is of course the country's official language. Any native French person will speak French and it helps if you can speak a bit of it. In the parts of the city that tourists frequent the most, the shopkeepers, information booth attendants, and other workers are likely to answer you in English, even if your French is advanced. These workers tend to deal with thousands of foreign-speaking tourists, and responding in English is often faster than repeating themselves in French. This is not the case for the rest of the city.\n\nFor most Parisians, English is something they had to study in school, and thus seems a bit of a chore. People helping you out in English are making an extra effort, sometimes a considerable one. Parisians younger than 40 are much more likely to be fluent in English. Immigrants, often working in service jobs, are less likely to speak English. If it's your first time in France you will have some problems understanding what people are saying, even with prior education in French. Unlike most language education tapes, real Parisians tend to speak fast, use slang, and swallow some letters.\n\nWhen attempting to speak French, do not be offended if people ask you to repeat, or seem not to understand you, as they are not acting out of snobbery. Keep your sense of humour, and if necessary, write down phrases or place names. And remember to speak slowly and clearly. Unless you have an advanced level and can at least sort of understand French movies, you should also assume that it will be difficult for people to understand what you are saying (imagine someone speaking English to you in an indiscernible accent).\n\nWhen in need of directions what you should do is this: find a younger person, or a person reading some book or magazine in English, who is obviously not in a hurry; say \"hello\" or \"bonjour\" (bon-zhor); start by asking if the person speaks English, \"Parlez-vous anglais?\" (Par-LAY voo on-glay?) even if the person can read something in English, speak slowly and clearly; write down place names if necessary. Smile a lot. Also, carry a map (preferably Paris par Arrondissement); given the complexity of Paris streets it is difficult to explain how to find any particular address in any language, no matter how well you speak it. If anything, the person may have an idea as to the place you are looking for, but may not know exactly where it may be, so the map always helps.\n\nOn the other hand, you will probably get the cold shoulder if you stop a random person in the mÃ©tro, fail to greet them and say \"where is place X or street Y\".\n\nNow, if you speak French, remember two magic phrases: \"Excusez-moi de vous dÃ©ranger\" [ex-kuh-zay mwuh duh voo day-rawn-ZHAY] (\"Sorry to bother you\") and \"Pourriez-vous m'aider?\" [por-EE-AY voo may-DAY] (\"Could you help me?\") especially in shops; politeness will work wonders.\n\nIt is considered polite to always say \"bonjour\" (during the day) or \"bonsoir\" (at night) to employees when entering any type of shop even if you have no intention of buying anything. Upon leaving you should say \"merci\" to thank the shopkeeper for allowing you to browse and say \"bonne journÃ©e\" (bun zhur-nay) or \"bonne soirÃ©e\" (bun swa-ray) to wish them a good day or evening. \"Bonne nuit\" is only used when telling someone \"goodnight\" when going to bed.\n\nFinally, if you speak a language other than English or French, and your French is limited or non-existent, offer to speak your second language with the phrase \"Parlez-vous anglais ou XXXX?\" (Par-LAY voo on-glay oo XXXX?) as this shows that you are making an effort to speak somebody else's language as well as your own.\n\nSee\n\n[edit]\n\nThe listings below are just some highlights of things that you really should see if you can during your visit to Paris. Detailed information can be found on each individual district page (click on the name of the sight).\n\nLandmarks\n\n[edit]\n\nMuseums and galleries\n\n[edit]\n\nAll national museums and monuments are free for all every first Sunday of the month.\n\nGeneral tips\n\n[edit]\n\nPlanning your visits: several sites have \"choke points\" that restrict the number of visitors that can flow through. These include: The Eiffel Tower, Sainte-Chapelle, and the catacombs . To avoid lines, you should start your day by arriving at one of these sites at least 30 minutes before opening time. Otherwise, expect a wait of at least an hour. Most museums and galleries are closed on either Monday or Tuesday. Examples: the Louvre museum is closed on Tuesdays while the Orsay Museum is closed on Mondays. Be sure to check museum closing dates to avoid disappointment! Also, most ticket counters close 30-45 min before final closing.\n\nAll national museums are open free of charge on the first Sunday of the month. However, this may mean long lines and crowded exhibits. Keep away from Paris during Easter week due to crowding. People have to queue up at the Eiffel Tower for several hours even early in the morning. However, this wait can be greatly reduced, if fit, by walking the first two levels, then buying an elevator ticket to the top. Entry to the permanent exhibitions at city-run museums is free at all times (admission is charged for temporary exhibitions).\n\nSightseeing passes\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of the best value and most convenient ways to see the sights of Paris is with the Paris Museum Pass[dead link] , a pre-paid entry card that allows entry into over 70 museums and monuments around Paris (and the Palace of Versailles) and comes in 2-day (â‚¬62), 4-day (â‚¬77) and 6-day (â‚¬92) denominations (August 2024). These are consecutive days. The card allows you to jump lengthy queues, a big plus during tourist season when lines can be extensive, and is available from participating museums, tourist offices, FNAC branches and all the main MÃ©tro and RER train stations. You will still need to pay to enter most special exhibitions. To avoid waiting in the first long queue to purchase the museum pass, stop to purchase your pass a day or more in advance after mid-day. The pass does not become active until your first museum or site visit when you write your start date. After that, the days covered are consecutive. Do not write your start date until you are certain you will use the pass that day and be careful to use the European date style as indicated on the card: day-month-year.\n\nAlso consider the ParisPass, a pre-paid entry card + queue jumping to 60 attractions including the Louvre, The Arc de Triomphe, as well as a river cruise which allows free metro & public transport travel.\n\nDo\n\n[edit]\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nFootball: play soccer in Ligue 1, the top tier, and often win it. But don't head for the central district of Saint-Germain-des-PrÃ©s! PSG play at Parc des Princes Stadium in the 16th arrondissement south of Bois de Boulogne. The club name derives from Saint-Germain-en-Laye 20 km west.\n\nParis FC are the poor relations, playing in Ligue 2, at Stade CharlÃ©ty on the peripherique in the 13th arrondissement.\n\nRugby: two clubs play rugby union (15 a side) in Top 14, the French top tier. Racing play at La DÃ©fense Arena (or U Arena) in Nanterre. Stade FranÃ§ais play big games at Stade de France and others at Stade Jean-Bouin, next to Parc de Princes the PSG soccer stadium.\n\nEvents\n\n[edit]\n\nIt seems like there's almost always something happening in Paris, with the possible exceptions of the school holidays in August and February, when about half of Parisians are to be found not in Paris, but in the South of France or the Alps respectively. The busiest season is probably the fall, from a week or so after la rentrÃ©e scolaire or \"back to school\" to around NoÃ«l (Christmas) theatres, cinemas and concert halls book their fullest schedule of the year.\n\nGood listings of current cultural events in Paris can be found in Pariscope or Officiel des spectacles, weekly magazines listing all concerts, art exhibitions, films, stage plays and museums. Available from all kiosks. Timeout is a good option for tourists, who don't speak French.\n\nEven so, there are a couple of annual events in the winter, starting with a furniture and interior decorating trade fair called Maison & Object in January.\n\nIn February le nouvel an chinois (Chinese New Year) is celebrated in Paris as it is in every city with a significant Chinese and Vietnamese population. There are parades in the 3rd and 4th arrondissements and especially in the Quartier Asiatique (Asian Quarter) in the 13th south of Place d'Italie. Also in February is the Six Nations Rugby Tournament[dead link] which brings together France, England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Italy.\n\nThe International Agricultural Show (Salon Internationale de l'Agriculture) usually takes place over a week around the end of February/beginning of March at the Porte de Versailles exhibition centre. It is unmissable (not just for tourists but also French politicians wanting to appear in touch with rural France), and showcases large numbers of domestic animals as well as selling speciality food products from all over France and its former colonies in Africa. Particularly recommended are the food stalls from the overseas territories where you can try regional specialities that are hard to come by even in Metropolitan France, and they will often also have performances from folk musicians/dancers. It's usually advised to buy tickets in advance as the queues for entry can be long.\n\nThe first of two Fashion weeks occurs in March: Spring Fashion Week, giving designers a platform to present women's prÃªt-Ã -porter (ready to wear) collections for the following winter.\n\nIn June, Rendez-vous au Jardin is an open house for many Parisian gardens, giving you a chance to meet real Parisian gardeners and see their creations. The FÃªte de la Musique celebrates the summer solstice (21 June) with this city-wide free musical knees-up. Finally on the 26th of June is the Gay Pride parade, featuring probably the most sincere participation by the mayor's office of any such parade on the globe.\n\nThe French national holiday Bastille Day on the 14th of July celebrates the storming of the infamous Bastille during the French Revolution. Paris hosts several spectacular events that day of which the best known is the Bastille Parade which is held on the Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es at 10:00 and broadcast to pretty much the rest of Europe by television. The entire street will be crowded with spectators so arrive early. The Bastille Day Fireworks is an exceptional treat for travellers lucky enough to be in town on Bastille Day. The Office du Tourisme et des Congress de Paris recommends gathering in or around the champ de Mars, the gardens of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nAlso in July, Cinema en Plein Air is the annual outdoor cinema event that takes place at the Parc de la Villette, in the 19th on Europe's largest inflatable screen. For most of the months of July and August, parts of both banks of the Seine are converted from expressway into an artificial beach for Paris Plages. Also in July the cycling race le Tour de France has a route that varies annually, however it always finishes on the last Sunday of July under the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nOn the last full weekend in August, a world-class music festival Rock en Seine draws international rock and pop stars to the Domaine national de Saint-Cloud, just west of Paris.\n\nDuring mid-September DJs and (usually young) fans from across Europe converge on Paris for five or six days of dancing etc. culminating in the Techno parade - a parade whose route traces roughly from Place de la Bastille to the Sorbonne, and around the same time the festival Jazz Ã  la Villette brings some of the biggest names in contemporary jazz from around the world.\n\nIn the beginning of autumn the vine harvest fest takes place. The most famous is the FÃªte des Vendanges de Montmartre, a food festival around the vine harvest of the Montmartre vineyard.\n\nThe Nuit Blanche transforms most of central Paris into a moonlit theme-park for an artsy all-nighter on the first Saturday of October, and Fashion Week returns shortly thereafter showing off Women's PrÃªt-Ã -Porter collections for the following summer; as we've noted winter collections are presented in March.\n\nThe third Thursday in November marks the release of Le Beaujolais Nouveau and the beginning of the Christmas season. This evening, the Christmas lights are lit in a ceremony on the Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es, often in the presence of hundreds (if not thousands) of people and many dignitaries, including the president of France.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no comprehensive event guides covering concerts, clubs, movies or special events. For theatre, movies and exhibitions pick up the Pariscope and L'officiel du Spectacle, available at newsstands for â‚¬0.40. For (especially smaller, alternative) concerts pick up LYLO, a small, free booklet available in some bars and at FNAC. There is no user-friendly online version of these guides.\n\nPhotography\n\n[edit]\n\nParis is considered by many as the birthplace of photography, and while one may debate the correctness of this claim, there is no debate that Paris is today a photographer's dream. The French capital offers a spectacular array of photographic expositions and opportunities to the beginner and the pro alike. It has photogenic monuments (e.g., Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower, the obelisk at Concorde, and countless others); architecture (e.g., the Louvre, Notre Dame, the Museum of the Arab World) and urban street scenes (e.g., in the Marais, Montmartre and Belleville). When you tire of taking your own photos, visit one of the many institutions dedicated to photography. At these and other institutions, you can learn the about the rich history of Paris as the place of important developments in photography (e.g., the Daguerrotype) and as the home of many of the trade's great artists (e.g., Robert Doisneau, AndrÃ© KertÃ©sz, Eugene Atget and Henri Cartier-Bresson).\n\nJeu de Paume, at the entrance of Tulerie Gardens, is one of the city's premier photography exhibition sites.\n\nParis Photo, one of the world's most important art fairs, takes place in the autumn.\n\nMovies\n\n[edit]\n\nThe CinÃ©mas of Paris are (or at least should be) the envy of the movie-going world. Of course, like anywhere else you can see big budget first-run films from France and elsewhere. That though, is just the start. During any given week there are at least half-a-dozen film festivals going on, at which you can see the entire works of a given actor or director. Meanwhile, there are some older cult films like say, What's new Pussycat or Casino Royal which you can enjoy pretty much any day you wish.\n\nMany non-French movies are subtitled (called \"version originale\" \"VO\" or \"VOstfr\" as opposed to \"VF\" for version franÃ§aise).\n\nThere are any number of ways to find out what's playing, but the most commonly used guide is Pariscope, which you can find at newsstands for â‚¬0.70. Meanwhile, there are innumerable online guides which have information on \"every\" cinema in Paris.\n\nThe CinemathÃ¨que franÃ§aise and the Forum des Images are the two public film institutions that organize retrospectives, exhibitions and festivals.\n\nTheatres\n\n[edit]\n\nThe , as well as its associated ballet company, the Paris Opera Ballet, are considered to be among the premier classical performance companies in the world.\n\nIf you are under 26, there is a flat rate of â‚¬10 for every private theatre of the town every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday night. This fare does not apply to public theatres nor opera.\n\nWith children\n\n[edit]\n\nParis MÃ´mes is a Parisian cultural guide with children's activities and events that comes out several times a year.\n\nCitÃ© des enfants in the 19th, a museum for kids within the CitÃ© des Sciences et de l'Industrie, is interactive, fun, and educational. There are two separate sections for the 3-5 set and the 5-12 set. The tots section has simple exhibits designed to be pushed, prodded, and poked. The section for older kids is more sophisticated with scientific experiments and TV studios. MÃ©tro Porte de la Villete (7)\n\nJardin du Luxembourg in the 6th. It would be counted as a travesty not to take your under 10 year old to the Jardin du Luxembourg, long a favourite with Parisian children. With its world famous merry-go-round, a pond for sail boats, a puppet theater, pony rides, chess players, children's playground, it has something for every kid (with comfortable chairs for weary parents thrown in!). The marionettes du Luxembourg, the puppet theatre, stages classic French puppet shows in French but should be easy to understand. There are numerous places for a snack. RER Luxembourg (B) or MÃ©tro OdÃ©on (4, 10)\n\nParc des Buttes-Chaumont in the 19th. Buttes-Chaumont is great for those with children that like to run, climb, and explore. Built on the site of an abandoned quarry, the park is roughly bowl-shaped with a 30-meter-tall peak situated in the middle of a pond at the park's center. There are trails up the rock, caves, waterfalls, a suspension bridge, and a small stone gazebo on the top of the rock with a 360-degree view. There is also a puppet theater and a playground. MÃ©tro Buttes-Chaumont (7bis), Botzaris (7bis), or LaumiÃ¨re (5)\n\nParc Zoologique in the 12th. This zoo is different because of a 236-foot artificial mountain bang in its center. Take elevators to the top and enjoy the view or watch the mountain goats do their stuff on the sides. Lions, tigers, and everything designed to delight kids can be found in the zoo if the mountain doesn't do it for your kids. RER/MÃ©tro Gare d'Austerlitz (5, 10, C)\n\nThe Jardin d'Acclimatation in the 16th has a number of rides, including pint-sized roller coasters suitable for children as young as three years, as well as a mini-zoo and the estimable MusÃ©e en Herbe. MÃ©tro Les Sablons (1)\n\nThe Parc Floral, in the Bois de Vincennes, has different themed playgrounds, ping pong tables and picnic areas. During winter the entrance is free.\n\nLearn\n\n[edit]\n\nParis is the seat of other places to learn about a variety of topics.\n\nCulinary\n\n[edit]\n\nHow better to get to know a culture than to learn the ins and outs of its native cuisine. After sampling your fair share of Macarons and Magret de Canard around Paris, you might enjoy taking an afternoon to learn how to make these delicacies yourself and take the recipes home with you. While there are many cooking schools around Paris, only a few offer classes in English.\n\nWork\n\n[edit]\n\nWork in Paris, especially for non-EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, entails a very long and arduous process. Unless you possess one of a number of in-demand skills, it will almost certainly be necessary to obtain a job offer from an employer before arriving. Your employer, for their part, will have to have the offer approved by the relevant governmental authorities, as well. If you opt for unreported work, such as babysitting, you need not fret about going through the process to obtain a Carte de sÃ©jour, i.e., a formal visitor's identity card. However, if you do choose a change in location, it is advisable to obtain a Carte de sÃ©jour prior to finding any job whatsoever, as the process can be longer than expected. A Carte de sÃ©jour is often necessary to open a bank account and the like, and by extension for accomplishing any number of other tasks involved in modern life, so unless you're very comfortable transacting everything in cash you should probably bite the bullet and keep things on the up-and-up.\n\nIf you go to Paris for a conference, there's a very good chance you'll end up in a meeting or exhibiting at CNIT (Centre of New Industries and Technology). This conference and convention space is one of the oldest buildings in the La Defense area of Paris and still looks modern even though it's been eclipsed in height by surrounding buildings and hotels near the CNIT are mainly catered to those staying in the area on business.\n\nRemember, the city of Paris has a huge network of immigrants coming and going, and it is always great to tap into that network. The city holds a great abundance of work ready to be found, even if the search feels nerve-wracking at first.\n\nBuy\n\n[edit]\n\nParis is one of the great fashion centres of the Western world, up there with New York, London, and Milan, making it a shopper's delight. While the Paris fashion scene is constantly evolving, the major shopping centres tend to be the same. High end couture can be found in the 8th arrondissement. In summer, there is nothing better than browsing the boutiques along Canal St-Martin, or strolling along the impressive arcades of the historic Palais-Royal, with beautifully wrapped purchases swinging on each arm.\n\nLe Marais is a mostly Jewish neighbourhood, most of the shops in Le Marais are open on Sundays. The stores in this area are intimate, boutique, \"Parisian\" style clothing stores. You will no doubt find something along each street, and it is always well worth the look.\n\nOther great areas to shop around in are around the area SÃ¨vres Babylone (MÃ©tro Line 10 and Line 12). It is in this area you will find the Le Bon MarchÃ© 7th, particularly rue de Cherche Midi 6th. The area boasts some of the major fashion houses (Chanel, Jean Paul Gaultier, Versace, etc.) and also has smaller private boutiques with handmade clothing.\n\nIn the Quartier Saint-Germain-des-PrÃ©s, you can find a handful of vintage clothing shops, carrying anything from couture early 20th century dresses, to 70s Chanel sunglasses. Walking along Boulevard Saint-Germain, you will find major brands. However, if in search of eclectic finds, opt to walk the northern side of the Boulevard, especially along rue Saint AndrÃ© des Arts, where you can always find a nice cafÃ© to stop in. The area south of Saint-Germain is just as nice, and comes with a price tag to match.\n\nIn the artsy quarters of 1 and 4, there are many bargains to be had, once again, if you are prepared to look. Souvenirs are easily found and can be fairly inexpensive as long as you don't buy from the tourist sites. For cheap books of French connection, try the University/Latin quarter as they sell books in all languages starting from half a euro each.\n\nFlea markets\n\n[edit]\n\nParis has 3 main flea markets, all on the outskirts of the central city. The most famous of these is the MarchÃ© aux Puces de St-Ouen (Porte de Clignancourt) (Clignancourt Flea Market), MÃ©tro: Porte de Clignancourt, in the 18th, a haven for lovers of antiques, second-hand goods, and retro fashion. The best days to go are Saturday and Sunday. There are particular times of the week when only antique collectors are allowed into the stalls, and there are also times of the day when the stall owners take their Parisian siesta, and enjoy a leisurely cappuccino for an hour or so. The best times to visit the flea markets are in the spring and summertime, when the area is more vibrant. In and around the metro station, you may find the area a little wild, but still safe.\n\nThe MarchÃ© aux Puce de Vanves in the 14th arrondissement is open on Saturday and Sunday from 7h-14h. The closes metro station is Porte de Vanves.\n\nMusical instruments\n\n[edit]\n\nRue de Rome, situated near Gare St. Lazare, is crowded with luthiers, brass and woodwind makers, piano sellers, and sheet music stores. Subway station Europe. The area south of the metro station Pigalle is also packed with music shops (more oriented towards guitars and drums).\n\nArtwork\n\n[edit]\n\nFor art lovers, be sure to check out Quartier Saint-Germain-des-PrÃ©s, which is renowned for its galleries, and it is impossible to turn a street without finding a gallery to cast your glance in. On Fridays, most open until late. Most even have the benefit of bottles of wine so you can wander in with your glass of wine and feel very artistique. Great roads to walk along are rue de Seine, rue Jacob, rue des Beaux Arts, Rue Bonaparte, and Rue Mazarine. Also, be sure to visit the historical district of Montparnasse and quartier Vavin where artists like Modigliani, Gauguin and Zadkine used to work.\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nIndividual listings can be found in Paris's district articles\n\nParis is one of Europe's culinary centres, where the haute cuisine has flourished since at least the French revolution. It may however come as a surprise that Paris isn't considered the culinary capital of French cuisine; many people prefer the French cooking found in small rural restaurants, outside of the city, closer to the farms and with their focus on freshness and regional specialities. Even among French cities, Paris has long been considered by the French as second to Lyon for fine dining.\n\nThere have been other challenges in the last 20 years or so as restaurateurs in places like San Francisco and Sydney briefly surpassed their Parisian fore bearers, again with an emphasis on freshness of ingredients but also borrowings from other cuisines. Parisian cooks didn't just rest on their laurels during this time, rather they travelled, taught, and studied, and together with Paris's own immigrant communities, have revitalized the restaurant trade. Today you can find hundreds of beautiful restaurants with thoughtful (or just trendy) interior design and well-planned and executed cartes and menus offering a creative mÃ©lange of French and exotic foreign cuisines. It's safe to say that Paris is once again catching up with or edging ahead of its Anglophone rivals.\n\nOf course there are also some traditional offerings, and for the budget conscious there are hundreds of traditional bistros, with their sidewalk terraces offering a choice of fairly simple (usually meat centred) meals for reasonable prices.\n\nIt is unfortunately possible to have a uniformly poor dining experience during a stay in Paris, probably because mass tourism attracts price gougers. It is frequent to hear people complaining of very high Parisian prices for very poor food and service. Since so many of the restaurants are sub-par, the best approach is to rely on a restaurant guide and personal recommendations. Do your research in advance if possible and be prepared to travel some distance. Don't just walk down the street expecting to find good food; you probably won't.\n\nMany restaurants are tiny and have tables close together - square metres are at a premium and understandably restaurateurs need to make the most of limited space. In some cases when the restaurant is crowded, you may have to sit beside strangers at the same table. If that does not appeal to you, go to a more upscale place where you will pay for the extra space.\n\nTrendy restaurants often require reservations weeks, if not months in advance. If you haven't planned far enough ahead, try to get a reservation for lunch which is generally easier and less expensive.\n\nFor an easy-to-manage eating budget while in Paris, consider: breakfast or \"petit dÃ©jeuner\" at a restaurant, possibly in your hotel, consisting of some croissants, coffee, and maybe a piece of fruit. Get a 'walking lunch' from one of Paris' many food standsâ€”a panino in the centre of the city, a crepe from a crepe stand, a felafel pita or take-out Chinese in the Marais. Traiteurs serving Chinese and/or Vietnamese food are ubiquitous in the city and good for a cheap lunch and many pÃ¢tisseries sell inexpensive coffee and sandwiches. All these are cheap (about the same as breakfast), easy, and allow you to maximize your sightseeing and walking time while enjoying delicious local or ethnic food. For dinner, stroll the streets at dusk and consider a â‚¬20-40 prix-fixe menu. This will get you 3 or 4 courses, possibly with wine, and an unhurried, candlelit, magical evening. If you alternate days like this with low-budget, self-guided eating (picnicking, snacking, street food) you will be satisfied without breaking the bank.\n\nIf one of the aims of your trip to Paris is to indulge in its fine dining, though, the most cost-effective way to do this is to make the main meal of your day lunch. Virtually all restaurants offer a good prix-fixe deal. By complementing this with a bakery breakfast and a light self-catered dinner, you will be able to experience the best of Parisian food and still stick to a budget.\n\nSelf-catering\n\n[edit]\n\nBudget travellers will be very pleased with the range and quality of products on offer at the open air markets (e.g. the biggest one on Boulevard Richard Lenoir (near the Bastille), Rue Mouffetard, Place Buci, Place de la Madeleine and over the Canal Saint-Martin in the 11th or in any other arrondissement). If your accommodation has cooking facilities you're set, especially for wine and cheese, a decent bottle of French wine will set you back all of about â‚¬3-5, while the fairly good stuff starts at around â‚¬7. Bottles for less than â‚¬3 are not recommended.\n\nThe small Ã©piceries which open until late are more expensive than the supermarchÃ©s (Casino, Monoprix, Franprix, etc.) For wine, the price difference can be up to â‚¬2.\n\nBuy a baguette, some cheese and a good bottle of wine and join the Parisian youth for a pique-nique along the Seine (especially on the ÃŽle Saint-Louis) or along the Canal Saint-Martin. The finest food stores are Lafayette Gourmet in the Galeries Lafayette or La Grande Epicerie in the luxury department store Le Bon MarchÃ©. They are worth discovering. You will find a large variety of wines there, otherwise try wine stores (cavistes) that are present everywhere in the city, and sell all kind of good French wine that you won't find in a supermarket. The owners usually know their wines and will be happy to help you choose among their huge selection. Some also sell good food. You can search for one online or ask a local. There are also some \"wine supermarkets\" such as Nicolas or Le Relais de Bacchus (all over the city) that sell more common wines.\n\nSome specialities\n\n[edit]\n\nFor seafood lovers, Paris is a great place to try moules frites (steamed mussels and French fries) (better in fall and winter), oysters, sea snails, and other delicacies. Meat specialties include venison (deer), boar, and other game (especially in the fall and winter hunting season), as well as French favourites such as lamb, veal, beef, and pork.\n\nPrices\n\n[edit]\n\nEating out in Paris can be expensive. However don't believe people when they say you can't do Paris on the cheap - you can! The key is to stay away from the beaten tracks and the obviously expensive Champs ElysÃ©es. Around the lesser visited quarters especially, there are many cheap and yummy restaurants to be found. The area around Fontaine Saint-Michel, the fountain facing Notre Dame is crowded by particularly tasty places to eat, with good ambiance, cheap prices and excellent service, with the advantage of being very centric of many places of interest. The key is to order from the prix-fixe menu, and not off the A la Carte menu unless you want to pay an arm and a leg. In many places a three course meal can be found for about â‚¬15. This way you can sample the food cheaply and is usually more \"French\". Ask for \"une carafe d'eau\" (oon karaaf doe) to get free tap water.\n\nKosher dining\n\n[edit]\n\nParis has the largest number of Kosher restaurants in any European city. Walk up and down Rue des Rosiers to see the variety and choices available from Israeli, Sushi, Italian and others. You will also find a wide assortment of Kosher restaurants in the 9th arrondissement of Paris near the rue Richer and rue Cadet areas. See the district guides for examples. Kosher restaurants and snacks usually display a big orange rectangle on their front, which ensure clients that they are Beth din certified.\n\nVegetarian dining\n\n[edit]\n\nFor vegetarians, eating traditional French food will require some improvisation, as it is heavily meat-based. That being said, it is far easier to be vegetarian in Paris than it is elsewhere in France. Paris has several excellent vegetarian restaurants, and many non-vegetarian restaurants will provide vegetarian dishes.\n\nWhen eating in a traditional restaurant, be careful before ordering dishes labelled as \"vegetarian\". Many French people presume that fish and seafood are vegetarian dishes. This is a widely spread misunderstanding all around the country. Additionally, French people tend to confuse \"real\" vegetarians with vegans. When explaining that you're a vegetarian that won't eat fish, people will often presume that you don't eat milk or egg-based products.\n\nLook for spots such as Le Grenier de Notre-Dame in the 5th. The 10th arrondissement also has quite a large variety of vegetarian restaurants, especially of Indian and East/South-East Asian fare. See the arrondissement pages for more listings. For fast food and snacks, you can always find a vegetarian sandwich or pizza, or indeed French tacos. Even a kebab shop can make you something with just cheese and salad, or perhaps falafel. And for healthier fare, it's not usually hard nowadays to find hipstery places that sell vegan poke bowls.\n\nThere are also lots of Italian, Thai, Indian, and Mezo-American places where you will have little problem. The famous South Indian chain Saravana Bhavan have their branch near Gare Du Nord. In Rue des Rosiers (4th arrondissement) you can get delicious falafel in the many Jewish restaurants. Another place to look for falafel is on Rue Oberkampf (11th arrondissement). Take away falafel usually goes for â‚¬5 or less.\n\nMoroccan and Algerian cooking is common in Paris - vegetarian couscous is lovely. Another good option for vegetarians - are traiteurs, particularly around Ledru Rollin (down the road from Bastille) take away food where you can combine a range of different options such as pomme dauphinoise, dolmas, salads, vegetables, nice breads and cheeses and so on.\n\nLebanese restaurants and snack shops abound as well, offering a number of vegetarian mezze, or small plates. The stand-bys of course are hummas, falafel, and baba-ganouche (caviar d'aubergine). A good place to look for Lebanese is in the pedestrian zone around Les Halles and Beaubourg in the 1st and 4th.\n\nAlso look out for banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) places, especially around Rue Mouffetard in the 5th, where you can often get a tofu banh mi for less than a fiver.\n\nTourists and locals\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen you are looking for a restaurant in Paris, be wary of those where the staff speak English a bit too readily. These restaurants are usually geared towards tourists. It does make a difference in the staff's service and behaviour whether they expect you to return or not.\n\nSometimes the advertised fixed price tourist menus (â‚¬10-15) are a good deal. If you're interested in the really good and more authentic stuff (and if you have learned some words of French) try one of the small bistros where the French go during lunch time.\n\nDrink\n\n[edit]\n\nThe bars scene in Paris really does have something for everyone. From bars which serve drinks in baby bottles, to ultra luxe clubs that require some name dropping, or card (black Amex) showing, and clubs where you can dance like no one's watching, (although they will be). To start your night out right, grab a drink or two in a ubiquitous dive bar, before burning up the dance floor and spreading some cash, at one of the trendy clubs.\n\nCanal St Martin. Many cozy cafÃ©s and other drinking establishments abound around the Canal St Martin in the 10th.\n\nThe Marais. The Marais has a large number of trendier new bars mostly in the 4th and to a le"
