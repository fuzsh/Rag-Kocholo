        "text": "From Charles de Gaulle (CDG) Airport, the most important airport of Paris situated about 25km north-east of the city centre:\n\n- Airport transfer service: the easiest and most relaxing way to get to the city centre is booking an airport transfer service. The driver of the car will be waiting for you at the arrival terminal with a sign with your name on it and will take you to your destination in the shortest of time.\n\n- Taxi: a taxi from Charles de Gaulle to Paris takes approximately half an hour and costs between 50 and 55 euros. There is an extra charge 15% from5pm until 10am. This supplement also applies on Sundays and public holdays.\n\n- RER: The line B of the RER train (Paris' express train) connect CDG Airport with the city centre in half an hour. The most important stops include Gare du Nord (25 minutes), Châtelet-Les-Halles (28 minutes), and Denfert-Rochereau (35 minutes). A train leaves the airport every 10 – 15 minutes. A single-journey from Charles de Gaulle to Paris costs € 10 (zones 1-5). This ticket is also valid if you need to take the metro (subway) from one of the train stations to get to your hotel.\n\n- Roissybus:\n\nThe Roissybus is a bus connecting the airport with Place Charles Garnier, next to Place de l’Opera, taking 60 minutes. A one-way ticket costs 11EUR. The bus runs from Charles de Gaulle to Paris from 6 am to 12:30 am, departing every 15-30 minutes and from 5:15 am to 12:30 am from Opéra to Charles de Gaulle.\n\nThe Roissybus stops at all the airport terminals (except 2G) before heading to the city centre, dropping its passengers off at rue Scribe at the corner of rue Auber.\n\nWe recommend this bus for those who are staying close to Place de l’Opéra and can get to their hotel by foot from the bus station.\n\n- Bus:\n\nTwo local buses connect this airport with the city centre:\n\n- Bus 350: From Charles de Gaulle to Gare de l’Est.\n\n- Bus 351: From Charles de Gaulle to Place de la Nation.\n\nBoth buses take over an hour to get to Paris and they leave the airport every 15 – 35 minutes.\n\nA one-way costs € 6 if the tickets are purchased on board.\n\n- Night Bus\n\nThere are two night buses called Noctilien, 140 and 143, connecting Charles de Gaulle with Gare de l’Est. A one-way ticket costs € 8\n\nFrom Orly Airport\n\nAirport transfer service: The easiest and most relaxing way to get to the city center is by booking an airport transfer. The driver of the car will be waiting for you at the arrival terminal with a sign with your name on it and will take you to your hotel in the shortest possible time. You can book a car for € 65.\n\n- Taxi: ataxi from Orly to the city centre costs between € 70 and € 80.\n\n- RER C + bus journey: ​​Orly Airport is connected to the train station Pont de Rungis by the “Paris par le train” bus. From the train station, the RER C takes you to the centre. The full journey takes 35 minutes. A single-way including the train and bus ride is € 6.85. It's also possible to use the Passe Navigo or the Paris Visite transport card (zone 1 - 4).\n\n- RER B + Orlyval: the Orlyval train connects Orly Airport with the train station Antony. Here, you can take the RER line B. The full journey takes 33 minutes.\n\nThe price that includes both the Orlyval and train to the centre is €10.90. In this case, the only travel card you can use is the Paris Visite. The Passe Navigo is not accepted.\n\n- Orlybus: the Orlybus connects the airport with the train station Denfert-Rochereau, in Montparnasse. Here, you can take the RER line B or the metro lines 4 and 6. It takes approximately 30 minutes to get to the centre and costs € 7.70. Both travel cards are accepted if you decide to take the Orlybus. Taking the Orlybus is a good idea if you’re staying close to Denfert-Rochereau. Otherwise, it’s faster and cheaper to take the RER C and then the metro to get to the centre.\n\n- Local buses: three local buses connect Orly with the centre from terminal Sud. A single-way ticket costs € 2 and is therefore the cheapest way to get to the airport."
