        "text": "This paper analyzes the international exhibition world's fair planning strategies despite their ephemeral characters are symbolic projects and structuring developments within the various stages of the Industrial Revolution. By landscapes and urban symbols, these shows leave a significant landmark on the urban grid of the host cities, but also in the mentality, urban representations and the techniques of construction. The symbolic aspect and the gigantic facilities will serve as guidelines for planners-architects in charge of their organization. The main political actors and the development of cities have recognized early the power and possibilities of these events to structure social life and urban landscape of cities. From the moment we decided to organize an exhibition, developers start with a dual objective, namely to build and manage the ephemeral and sustainable. Unlike the development of a large development project as the regeneration of a neighborhood, the Exhibition must be designed and constructed in three phases. There is one more step, one before (the strategy) a while (the course of the festival, usually six months) and after (the end of the exhibition, its balance sheet and reuse infrastructure or not). We are facing a much more complex Planner Action to be taken into account by decision makers or not the time and very often elected officials inheriting these fairs infrastructure. The touristic and urban history of Paris and Barcelona justified by example and comparing the uniqueness of these events. The example of Paris is exemplary through its heritage of world exhibitions of the nineteenth century and its international exhibitions of 1925, 1931 and 1937. As for Barcelona and his first experience of World Expo 1888 it turn implies a long political and urban processes leading to the Montjuic international Exhibition in 1929. The choice of these two cities is not neutral. In the early twentieth century, Paris is a model for the Catalan intelligentsia. Barcelona wants to be the \"Paris of the South of Europe.\" How not to see the realization of the Park of the Citadel in 1888 in Barcelona a replica of Park Monceau in Paris, the same view for the development of the Montjuic hill in 1929 and designed by architect Cadafalch policy on man the model of the Parisian perspective Champ de Mars / Chaillot Hill: the rule and model are at work. As such, the hill and the redemptive religious center of Montmartre and the hill of Tibidabo with its redemptive church also are parallel to consider. Organizing an exhibition is accompanied by mobilization and justification of financial and human resources, this through political actors and private public works companies. The symbolic, the political message, cultural or economic become legitimacy of public action elements. In addition, the urban grid of the restructuring deal with the issue of transience must be addressed. This is the question of choosing between the provisional (destruction) and sustainable (urban heritage) against the vision of the planners in charge of exhibition parks projects. We will close our reflection on the contribution and usefulness of these ephemeral events from the perspective of technology and innovations in the construction and the landscaping.\n\nBallester, Patrice (2018), « The 1992 Olympic and Paralympic games in Barcelona, Interview of Patrice Ballester » in Les cahiers de la chaire immobilier et développement durable, sous la direction d'Ingrid Nappi-Choulet et d'Emmanuel de la Masselière, « The Urban and Real Estate Legacy of mega-events », Cahier # 6, pp.160 – 169. Barcelona and its Olympic Games of 1992, a model of success and a critical look to take into account for future Olympics.city-planning, urban art, tourism, economic strategy. Through some twenty interviews with researchers, academics, elected officials and urban architects, this sixth edition of the Cahiers de la Chaire Immobilier et Développement Durable de l’ESSEC takes a critical look at the urban and real estate-related effects of major events on the cities that host them (Olympic and Paralympic Games and World Expos). It puts the urban and real estate legacy left behind by previous events in perspective with Paris’ expectations of the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, to which it will be host and World Expo 2025, to which it could have been hosted if Paris' candidacy had been maintained. During the bidding process, as Paris confirms, the awaited impacts on development and real estate and urban re-development are tremendous. Post-time analyses in Europe, Brazil and Japan show that they differ from case to case. In some instances, the outcomes are mixed or even negative: white elephants are marooned, and the debt left behind has an impact on city finances for decades. In others, to the contrary, the outcomes are strikingly positive: a neighbourhood is created, or a city changes dimension and trajectory. Looking at each of these situations, this Cahier brings to light the conditions for successful mega-events. The most important is that the legacy be taken into consideration already upstream, from the bidding phase. The second is the development of a strategy for maximising the value of the event: the event is not, from an urban perspective, an end-purpose, but a fantastic opportunity for development; beyond the media enthusiasm, it strengthens and speeds up a project's dynamic. Barcelone et ses jeux Olympiques de 1992, un modèle de réussite et un regard critique à prendre en compte pour les futures olympiades. Aménagement, urbanisme, art urbain, tourisme, stratégie économique. À travers une vingtaine d’entretiens avec des chercheurs, des universitaires, des élus et des architectes urbanistes, ce sixième numéro des Cahiers de la Chaire Immobilier et Développement Durable de l’ESSEC porte un regard critique sur les effets urbains et immobiliers des grands événements sur les villes qui les accueillent comme les Jeux Olympiques, Paralympiques et les Expositions universelles. Il met en perspective cet héritage urbain et immobilier d’événements antérieurs avec les attentes de Paris envers les Jeux Olympiques et Paralympiques de 2024 qu’elle accueillera et l’Exposition universelle de 2025, qu'elle aurait pu accueillir si sa candidature avait été maintenue. Au moment des candidatures, et Paris le confirme, ces impacts espérés sur le développement et l’aménagement immobiliers et urbains sont immenses. Les analyses a posteriori en Europe, au Brésil et au Japon montrent qu’ils diffèrent d’un cas à l’autre. Parfois, ils sont mitigés voire négatifs : des éléphants blancs sont à l’abandon ; la dette laissée impacte les finances de la ville pour plusieurs décennies. Parfois, au contraire, ils sont très positifs : un quartier est créé, une ville change de dimension et de trajectoire. Face à ces situations diverses, le Cahier met en lumière les conditions du succès des mega-events. La plus importante est de penser l’héritage en amont, dès la phase de candidature. La deuxième est de se doter d’une stratégie de valorisation de l’événement : l’événement n’est pas, du point de vue urbain, une finalité mais une occasion formidable de développement ; au-delà de l’engouement médiatique, il conforte et accélère une dynamique de projet.\n\nS I S e p t e m b e r 2 8-3 0 , 2 0 1 6 I B u c h a r e s t-R o m a n i a Abstract In 2015 Milan was the seat of the thirty-fourth edition of the World Expositions with the theme \" Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life \". For six months it hosted the pavilions of the 134 participating countries and in November 2015 they are in the process of dismantling. The Expo Milano area is placed immediately outside the boundaries of the city center, in the northwest suburbs and is inserted into a system that, starting from Porta Garibaldi, intercepts a series of \" urban events \" such Scalo Farini, Bovisa, the fairgrounds Milano-Rho, the Greater Cemetery and the recent intervention of Social Housing \" Cascina Merlata \" ; the area is also defined by a large infrastructure system: the high speed trains, the Milan-Turin and Milan-Lakes highways, the Rho-Monza, the road of Sempione. Expo 2015 it has provided an important opportunity to redevelop an area of Milan hinterland inheriting and enhancing the quality of Lombardy, one of many, the important system of green and water concerning the city of Milan. In particular, the area of Expo is part of a broad green band that starts from south meeting the Agricultural Regional Park up to the Regional Park of the Groane north and encountering the ancient \" Bosco della Merlata \" that started from northwest and arrived at the cemetery crossing near the center of the area. Other significant elements were the streams Guise and Tirone that joining too are called Merlata starting at the northwest and coming to the Cemetery, bordering it. This natural system of green and water has played a key role in the masterplan of the Expo, with the purpose of inheriting the stratification of the signs on the surrounding area. The masterplan consists of a geometric system of Roman memory, consisting of a decumano, approximately 1,6 km long from east to west that crosses the whole area extending ideally the Corso Sempione axis in the center of Milan. From north to south, a cardo , which ideally seems to link the suburbs. Along these two axes, in a geometric mesh , there are the pavilions. The entire lot is circumscribed by a water ring that connects the Villoresi channel with the exhibition site and by a green path remembering the aforesaid systems. What's the future of the expo area now that the pavilions will be dismantled? Hence the interesting debate on the legacy, understood as material and immaterial heritage. The future that will be intended for the expo area is definitely an opportunity for urban regeneration of an area which could gradually no longer be considered a peripheral area negatively. The material legacy that we leave the site is represented by the Italian Pavilion , the tree of life, the Open Air Theatre and Cascina Triulza farthest heritage, prior to the event of Expo 2015. About future of Expo has already begun to discuss before it was built, but today it seems certain the hypothesis that in this area it will relocate the University of Milan, now \" widespread \" in the historical center of the city, with campus residences, auditoriums and sports activities, which Assolombarda will be born there the new Silicon Valley, an innovative center for computer science and that will make a large international research center about big data, nutrition, food and sustainability. The paper intends to present the results of a project work carried out within the course of Laboratory of the course of Science in Architecture Urban Design at the University of Naples Federico II, starting from the project for Expo area, he has had the opportunity to address many of the themes from the Call of EURAU 2016: in particular, within a complex project both functionally and morphologically, connections, on the one side, between what is public, what it is collective and what is private within a new \" piece \" of the city and, on the other side, the relationship between built space and unbuilt space\n\nThe ‘eventful city’ concept developed out of the basic observation that cities are using events to achieve a growing range of policy objectives, including economic growth, image change, social cohesion and physical redevelopment. The growing importance and scale of event activity in cities is driving a rapidly changing relationship between events and the city. Cities are no longer simply containers for events; they are co-creators, innovators, directors, managers, partners and beneficiaries of events. Events in turn are shaped by the cities they take place in, with their form, duration, content and effects being determined to a large extent by urban space, place and process. Few cities illustrate this dialectic relationship between cities and events better than Barcelona, the host city for this meeting. Starting with the World Expo in 1888 and continuing through the 1929 World Expo and the 1992 Olympic Games, Barcelona has harnessed the power of events to put itself on the global map, shape perceptions and drive economic, cultural and social development. With the Mobile World Congress recently secured for a further eight year term, Barcelona is rapidly establishing itself as a global events hub. This development has not always been smooth or entirely progressive. The forging of an economic growth coalition in Post-Franco Barcelona helped to secure the Olympics, but the focus on external promotion and economic growth has also attracted increasing criticism from social partners and local citizens concerned with the globalization of the city and the loss of identity. One of the basic emerging questions is – do events serve the city, or does the city serve events? When the original eventful cities concept was developed a few years ago, few cities had experience of managing, developing and directing their event programmes to produce effective outcomes. In recent years, however, different models have emerged that show how cities can develop a constructive relationship with their events, and how the events can benefit from this relationship as well. The aim of this meeting was to review the development of ‘eventful cities’ such as Barcelona, to analyse the emerging trends in the eventful landscape and to trace potential future development directions. The meeting will bring together leading international scholars in the event studies field, as well as practitioners from the events industry and the policy field in Barcelona and beyond.\n\nWorld Expo and Tourism - a new Utopia? From London 1851 to Dubai 2020. Through the recent and past World expo and more particularly the World expo of Milan 2015 and Port-au-Prince 1949, we recall that this tourist practice of the pleasure trip in a large city dates back to the XIXth century, it accompanies the origins of Our modern tourism, while becoming an instrument of geopolitics and tourist marketing of prime importance to cities and host countries (branding). Exhibitions can be seen as an urban lever, but also a way to make travel and understand our world through a system of representation of local and global identities that always emphasizes scientific discovery and cultural experience through the national pavilion. These giant events – mega-events - are based on a staging and narrative universal theme generally questioning the concept of sustainable development and the renewed attractiveness of the destination. Our analysis focuses on the most recent of the World expos and a forgotten exhibition belonging to the cultural area of the Caribbean, which reveals three dynamics associating mega-event tourism with the utopia of initiatory journeys, namely: reinvent and regain a certain success of frequentation implying a redefinition of the fields and uses of a disrupted utopia; to make travel is an act both scenographic and symbolic through the pavilion involving artifices and more and more digital declensions, the quest for this sustainable practice of travel is confronted with its heritage and its memory at different scales and temporalities.
