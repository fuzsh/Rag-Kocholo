        "text": "Things to do in Paris\n\nAbout Paris\n\nWe all know her, the woman who arrives fashionably late at a party, turning heads of men and women alike. She’s sophisticated and elegant and she possesses a certain ‘je ne sais quoi’ that electrifies the room. As if straight out of Hemingway’s ‘A Moveable Feast’ she exudes culture, intellect, style and mystery. That woman is like Paris, the City of Light and Love.\n\nMany of Paris’ main sights are worth the hype; grande boulevards, architectural gems and iconic structure. But the city’s real charm is most palpable in its quiet alleyways and local cafés, tugged away in one of the many delightful neighborhoods. The fabric of Paris is woven together from a mix of romance, culture, style and attitude, all of which will make for a delightful experience.\n\n.\n\nPlaces of Interest in Paris\n\nThis charismatic, quirky Bohemian hilltop maze and home of ‘Amelie’ is a sterling spot to start any Paris infiltration. Le Coquelicot, a typical French boulangerie located near the Abbesses Metro station serves pastries to lust for; say their mouth-watering almond-pistachio-chocolate croissant. From here it’s all uphill, geographically speaking at the very least. Montmartre’s picturesque alleyways lead towards La Basilique du Sacré-Coeur, located high above the Paris’ rooftops. The church is one of the cities most famous sights, but it’s also the view of the French capital that’s worth every calorie you burn walking up here. The nearly adjacent art market is a mandatory stop for all art lovers: Picassos’ studio, Le Bateau-Lavoid and Mur des Je t’aime. A few oysters for lunch on the terrace of La Mascotte later and Paris may have already won you over.\n\nFrom La Place de la Concorde a walk along the Champs Élysées towards the Arc De Triomphe seems obligatory, at least for first time visitors. And if you’re a macaroon enthusiast, Ladurée is the name of the game. A sugar fueled gander through the posh 8th Arrondissement along the Seine will lead you towards the city’s most priced possession… the Eiffel Tower. No need to bothered with the lines as the view from the adjacent Trocadéro is plenty jaw dropping.\n\nAn ideal time to arrive here is around sunset when you get to appreciate this iconic landmark during magic hour and as its lights come on. Trés magnefique! Let the nearby, renowned Basque eatery L’Ami Jean treat you to a well earned, exquisite dinner, best finished with their creamy rice pudding.\n\nCulture and History of Paris\n\nThere’s nothing petit about their déjeuner, but Holybelly near the canal in the 10th Arrondissement serves the ultimate bacon pancake that will have you lust for it many moons later. The carb coma can be wandered off along the Quai de Valmy and down Rue de Marseille and Rue Beaurepaire where local designer stores and pop-up shops line the streets, enticing you to spend your Euros. Lesser known to Paris’ countless tourists and popular amongst the locals, the 10th offers a nice balance to more iconic arrondissements.\n\nFrom Place de la République it’s just a short walk into the 3rd Arrondissement, also called Le Marais. The boulevards are lined with galleries, shops and bars enticing you to bath yourself in Paris’ culture and couture. Its buzzing main artery, Rue Vielle du Temple offers a wide variety of shops plus the one of the finest crepes in town at Breizh Café. Buckwheat dough makes it completely acceptable to order a savory and a sweet crepe. Guilt-free naturally. And for your daily culture fix, Musee National Picasso is definitely worth a stop. And an espresso on the roof terrace will inject you with enough energy to continue your explorations.\n\nNightlife in Paris\n\nPont Marie is the crossing point to Isle-de-Louis, a little island on the Seine straight of out a Victor Hugo novel. The island is connected to Isle de la Cité, home of the Notre Dame and one of his most (in)famous characters Quasimodo. Pont Neuf is a must for every romanticists, after all, even Juliette Binoche fell in love on this bridge in the movie \"Lovers of Pont Neuf\". How about a bottle of vin rouge, baguette and cheese while observing the sunset with the locals along the Quai des Tuileries? Watching the colors of the city change from the bank of the Seine is definitely a journal-worthy moment.\n\nMany might object, but visiting the Louvre after sunset and only the exterior isn’t that bad of an idea. The largest museum in the world deserves its own Paris trip and especially if your stay is short, the lines are just not worth the hourlong wait. After dark considerably lesser visitors crowd the square surrounding the pyramid, allowing it’s beauty and grandeur to be absorbed properly. Brasserie Bofinger near the Place de la Bastille serves perfectly fresh seafood, to be enjoyed with art deco décor and a very French attitude from the garçons. A nightcap in the courtyard of Hotel Costes, where the iconic Coco Chanel used to sip champagne from delicate crystal flutes will put a perfect bow on another day in Paris.\n\nInteresting Facts about Paris\n\nA typical French breakfast - think Cafe au Lait, croissant, etc - in one of the cafés around Place de la Contrescarpe should fuel your explorations along cobblestoned pathways in the Quartier Latin and the Sorbonne University area. Stroll through Jardin de Luxembourg, a well-manicured park towards St-Germain. Just enough to work up an appetite again: Steak frites at Relais de L’Entrecôte Saint Germain scratches that delicious itch perfectly. To avoid a beef induced food coma, keep on trucking towards the Musee D’Orsay. The old railway station is ideal for brushing up on your knowledge of impressionist masterpieces, exhibiting some of the most famous Van Gough, Monet and Renoir paintings. Finally, a meander around Pont Alexandre III, the Esplanade des Invalides and the Grand and Petit Palais will satisfy any remaining need for Old World architectural extravagance.\n\nReturning to Montmartre - because why not! - a stop at Le Moulin de la Galette for a cosy dinner is almost imperative. Located underneath one of the two remaining historical windmills that used to dot the neighborhood, this restaurant impresses with its Parisian ambience, superb service and seasonal menu. Save room for a few scoops of ice cream at the Scaramouche stand for some of the most exquisite and unusual flavors you’ve ever experienced. Up the steep staircase at the end of the same alley is the ultimately charming Au Petit Théatre du Bonheur. Poke your head in, you might get lucky and catch a chanteuse á la Edith Piaf performing in this heartbreakingly delightful shoebox theatre. The world famous Moulin Rouge is certainly an institution and naturally a major tourist attraction. Located in the midst of the red-light district the theatre puts on two cabaret shows a night and while it’s overpriced, it is still on many bucket lists for its seductive and enjoyable can-can dance by leggy, modern-day courtesans.
