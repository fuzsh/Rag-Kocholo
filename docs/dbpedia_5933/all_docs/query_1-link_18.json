        "text": "London bus operator\n\nRATP Dev Transit London is a bus operator owned by RATP Dev in London, England. It owns London Sovereign, London United and London Transit. It commenced on 11 December 2021 as a joint venture between RATP Dev and Kelsian Group. In September 2023, it became a wholly owned RATP Dev subsidiary.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn September 2021, RATP Dev and Kelsian Group agreed to form a joint venture to combine some of their Transport for London contracted bus operations. RATP held an 87.5% shareholding, with Kelsian owning 12.5%. RATP Dev Transit London commenced with 1,250 buses on 115 routes from 10 garages.[1][2][3]\n\nRATP Dev Transit London combined all of RATP's London Sovereign and London United operations, with both retaining their existing brands, while Tower Transit's operations out of Westbourne Park garage operate under the London Transit brand. RATP Dev Transit London commenced operations on 11 December 2021.[4][5][6][7]\n\nThe RATP Group placed its London operations under review in March 2023 after reporting a €26 million (£23.2 million) loss across the group's operations in 2022, with RATP announcing they were exploring proposals to sell or dilute their shareholding in RATP Dev Transit London. RATP's London operations have been impacted by a bus driver shortage, inflation and strike action resulting in a 10% pay increase compared to the initial 2.3% offered.[8] In September 2023, RATP Dev bought out Kelsian Group's 12.5% shareholding.[9]\n\nLondon Transit garage\n\n[edit]\n\nWestbourne Park (X)\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of June 2024, Westbourne Park garage operates routes 13, 23, 295, 414 and 452.\n\nFleet\n\n[edit]\n\nAs at March 2023, the fleet comprised 1,187 buses.[10]"
