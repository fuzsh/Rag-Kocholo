        "text": "A subsidiary of a large, international public transit firm says it has pulled out of a pending deal to become the new operator of the Ventura County Transportation Commission’s intercity bus lines.\n\nTexas-based RATP Dev USA — a branch of Paris-headquartered RATP Group — has for six months been in the process of buying the lines’ current operator, Camarillo-based Roadrunner Management Services, and assuming the final six years of Roadrunner’s contract with the commission.\n\nBefore deal fell apart: Int’l firm subsidiary on track to run county buses\n\nDeclining ridership: New study finds less people taking public transit in SoCal\n\nRATP Group is one of the world’s largest public transit firms, operating in 15 countries on four continents.\n\nBut on Tuesday, RATP Dev USA President Blaine Rigler emailed the commission’s executive director, Darren Kettle, telling him the company was pulling out of the pending deal, which the commission’s board had previously given its blessings.\n\n“RATP Dev advised (Kettle) that Roadrunner and RATP Dev are unable to complete their purchase and sales transaction because of certain issues that arose during the parties’ due diligence investigations,” states a staff report for next week’s meeting of the commission’s board. “RATP Dev and Roadrunner do not intend to proceed further with their proposed transaction.”\n\nSpecifically, Rigler told Kettle, RATP Dev had discovered a pending class-action lawsuit against Airport Connections, a company doing business as Roadrunner Shuttle, “and the parties were unable to separate the potential liability from the acquisition of RMS (Roadrunner Management Services),” the staff report states.\n\nRATP Dev further advised (Kettle) that the parties “‘could not achieve a mutually agreeable solution allowing RATP Dev USA to buy Roadrunner on commercially reasonable terms,’” according to the report.\n\nBut Roadrunner Chief Operating Officer Charles Sandlin said Friday his company is still in talks with RATP Dev in hopes of salvaging the deal.\n\n“We’re still working it,” he said. “It’s not dead yet.”\n\nHe declined to discuss the class-action lawsuit, who filed it or what it alleges, but said the company hoped to resolve it before the commission’s April 6 board meeting.\n\nThat is when, based on Rigler’s email, Kettle will recommend the board rescind its prior approval of the pending deal and authorize a request for proposals from other contractors to take over Roadrunner’s contract to operate the bus lines.\n\nRigler confirmed that his company and Roadrunner are still having some communications, but said that as of Friday, the deal was off.\n\n“We continue to have conversations, but at this point, we’re not moving forward with the acquisition,” he said.\n\nKettle said he’s disappointed the deal has apparently fallen through.\n\n“We were looking forward to the new company coming on board,” he said. “A company with a tremendous amount of experience in doing public transit. So, yes, we are disappointed it didn’t materialize.”\n\nKettle said in January that his understanding was that RATP Dev and Roadrunner hoped to finalize the sale by the end of that month and that if everything went according to schedule, RATP Dev would start operating the lines March 1.\n\nThat didn’t happen.\n\nRoadrunner still operates the lines and will continue to do so until a new contractor takes over, Kettle said Friday.\n\nThe seven lines that run between Ventura County cities and neighboring Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties serve about 800,000 riders a year.\n\nRoadrunner has operated the lines since 2012, but last year had a legal falling out with the commission."
