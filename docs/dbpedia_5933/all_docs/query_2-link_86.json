        "text": "The Best Hospitals in France\n\nThe French healthcare system was named the best on the planet by the World Health Organization in both 2000 and 1997. Expats and French citizens alike reap the benefits of an all-inclusive network of hospitals in France and other medical facilities. In 2013, more than 200,000 medical doctors were practicing in France.\n\nFrance is the world leader in medical research and state hospitals in France are modernized facilities with progressive treatment strategies. All state hospitals are grouped inside the public assistance (Assistance Publique) for a particular geographic area. They can be categorized in hospital groups (groupe hospitalier), general hospitals (center hospitalier), and university hospitals (centre hospitalier universitaire).\n\nCheck with your insurance provider at home before your trip to be clear on your coverage abroad. If you need to, purchase international health insurance as primary or secondary coverage.\n\nRelated: Moving to France as an Expat and Health Insurance for Foreigners in France\n\nBest International Hospitals in France\n\nIn an annual survey of 400 hospitals in France by the publisher of Le Point, the University Hospital of Toulouse was voted to have the best record for the quality of patient care.
