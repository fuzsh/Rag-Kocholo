Nothing but the best and freshest ingredients, and beans roasted from another one of my favorite coffee places on earth – Five Elephant in Berlin! ?With floors that are totally worthwhile of the hashtag #ihaveathingwithfloors ?- as we pretend not to be hipster at all (there is no wi-fi here so don’t go expecting to set up a work space). If you don’t know, now?you know!\n\nHang with us:?FACEBOOK?**?INSTAGRAM?**?GOOGLE +?**?PINTEREST?\n\nSo yes, go but take a book instead or linger with one of the many magazines they have lining the counter. Get inspired by the green decor, eavesdrop on your neighbor if need be, but how about a new concept of living in the moment (sans instagram or snapchat?). I know I know … as much as I try it’s hard for me to do too! Look at me talking to you guys like we’re only in a digital age #slowlife dudes.\n\nWith a minimalist menu of breakfast and lunch items like toasts and salads as well as eggs (with additions of bacon or salmon) you can pair it well with the fresh squeezed juice of the day (like the kiwi, pineapple and ginger one we tried today).\n\nThe team is super friendly and speak english ad will make you the best chemex or pour-over you’ll find this part of town.\n\nTwo thumbs up for the bacon eggs with salad (btw?high-five for keeping ?the #parisunder10euros going guys – food love and democracy for the masses man!)\n\nI for one can’t wait to go back for the salmon avocado toast my freind had and the banana bread looked so yummy! If you’re vegetarian they have options for you too on the menu.\n\nSo in short – take a pal or a good book sit at the window – look in and be inspired?or people watch over a flat white.\n\nEither way you’ll enjoy an “une?agreable apres-midi” aka a pleasant afternoon at Passager Cafe Paris.?\n\n?\n\nFollow them?@PassagerCafe\n\nPassager Cafe\n\nAddress: 107 Avenue Ledru Rollin, 75011 Paris\n\nMetro?:Bastille\n\nOpens Everyday 8am to 6pm.\n\nexcept Closed Sunday and Monday.\n\nMap it:"
