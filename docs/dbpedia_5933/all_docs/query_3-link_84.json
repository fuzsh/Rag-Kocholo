        "text": "Following routine evaluations across their London bus depot network, RATP Dev became aware that some of their existing emergency lighting systems were bordering compliance regulations and incurring high maintenance costs. RATP Dev asked Powercor to help create a safer and more sustainable environment for their employees and visitors.\n\nIt became obvious that decision processes were being made by balancing three key elements:\n\nRegulatory compliance.\n\nInitial cost base of system.\n\nOngoing maintenance costs.\n\nWorking in partnership with RATP DEV and strategic partner Clevertronics, Powercor designed and installed a state-of-the-art emergency lighting system for their 11 London bus depots.\n\nHowever, budgets were a big consideration in the system that was to be put forward. What was also made clear was to consider overall flexibility of the system, and future proof, any installation to progressively move to more innovative wireless systems as and when the time arose.\n\nThe system came with a seven-year guarantee and upgraded the emergency lighting for escape routes, open areas and high-risk environments. Using energy efficient LED technology the system blended with the architectural requirements of each building."
