Jacobs has been supporting clients with water reuse programs for decades, beginning with the first applications of advanced wastewater treatment technologies in the 1960s. We provide our clients with a full range of services, from water reuse feasibility studies to design, construction and operations.\n\nDefense & Security\n\nJacobs’ deep experience with advanced technology systems and our wide-ranging program support capabilities make us a premier partner at locations across the world.

Below are some stories from Jacobs that also highlight the connections and digital solutions we are making around the world."
