He was rewarded with the start alongside Mike Conley. Lowry took career-highs in field goals attempted (8-21) and 3-pointers attempted (3-7). He added 2 rebounds, 2 assists, 1 steal, and 2 turnovers.\n\nLike Randy Foye, April was Lowry's best month of the season with averages of 13 points and 4 assists. Look for Lowry to be traded during the offseason because of the excess of young point guards in Memphis. The Grizzlies have shown throughout the season that they want Conley as their starting PG of the future, leaving either Lowry or Javaris Crittenton likely to be traded.\n\nHere's a look at his final season stats:\n\nFoye scores 32\n\nRandy Foye scored a career-high 32 points in Minnesota's season finale. Foye scored 10 of his 32 points in overtime to lead the Timberwolves to a 110-101 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. He was 13-18 from the field, 4-5 from three, and added 4 rebounds and 4 assists.\n\nFoye averaged 21.2 points and 5.6 assists in his last 5 games of the season. He got better each game since he return from knee injury, and hopefully his progress will continue through the offseason. Foye's strong finish should propel him to a breakout season next year.\n\nHere's a look at Randy's final season stats:\n\nEvans chooses Memphis\n\nVillanova lost out on top recruit Tyreke Evans, as he announced in a press conference today that he will be attending Memphis University. I'm not gonna lie and say Villanova will be better off without him, but Evans could have caused some chemistry issues if he joined the Wildcats. The kid has a huge ego and may have been more worried about his stats and his NBA draft stock than winning games and playing team ball. Just take a look at some of his comments in a recent ESPN.com chat: Aaron Arrington, Philadelphia,Pa: Who do you look up to the most? why?\n\nTyreke Evans: Me!\n\nNever mind the fact that he felt the need to call a nationally televised press conference to make his decision in the first place.\n\nEvans may have been the final piece that could have pushed Villanova over the edge and become a National Championship contender, but this isn't a major blow to the program. Next season Villanova returns every player from a team that reached the Sweet Sixteen, and they have two available scholarships in case anybody else pops up. Nova will add Taylor King and Maalik Wayns in 2009, and Jay Wright can now devote his full attention to new recruits like Dominic Cheek.\n\nIn this day and age things can change quickly. Although he agreed to a contract extension, Memphis coach John Calipari may change his mind and decide to coach elsewhere. So for now Tyreke Evans is Memphis-bound, but you never know what may happen in the future.\n\nTaylor King to Villanova\n\nDuke Freshman Taylor King has decided to transfer to Villanova. King said, \"It just couldn't be a better fit for me... I asked blunt questions, but I wanted everything they offered. They laid down their game plan for me and I couldn't resist.\"\n\nHe will sit out next season and will be eligible to play in 2009-2010 after Dante Cunningham, Shane Clark, Dwayne Anderson, and Frank Tchuisi graduate. King is a 6'6 forward noted for his 3-point shooting (37.7%). He averaged 5.5 points in his first season, with his best game coming on November 25 when he scored 27 points and made 6 of 11 threes.\n\nKing is Villanova's third McDonald's All-American, along with Scottie Reynolds and Corey Stokes. King's shooting should be a nice addition to the team. The year off should give him time to adjust to Jay Wright's system and help improve his defense and rebounding.\n\nLowry vs. Foye Part III\n\nThe Timberwolves beat the Grizzlies 114-105 at Memphis tonight in the third meeting between former Wildcats Randy Foye and Kyle Lowry.\n\nFoye had 16 points, 6 assists, 3 rebounds, 1 block, and 1 turnover. His quotes after the game: \"We were moving the ball well. It's fun to play like that. You push the ball up, swing, swing, dunk. That's so fun, man. I love playing like that.\" Randy was coming off of one his better games of the season when he had 25 points, 6 rebounds, and 4 assists in a win at Orlando. He is now averaging 17.4 points and 4.9 assists in the month of April. Foye has been impressive from 3-point range, shooting 40.3% on the season.\n\nLowry had 10 points, 5 assists, 4 rebounds, 1 steal, and 1 turnover. Kyle is averaging 9.5 points and 3.6 assists this season. Starting point guard Mike Conley had a career-high 25 points and added 5 assists in the game.\n\nLowry vs. Foye, Part II\n\nFormer Villanova teammates Kyle Lowry and Randy Foye met for the second time in their NBA careers tonight. This time Lowry and the Grizzlies came out on top with a 113-101 victory over the Timberwolves in Minnesota.\n\nLowry had 9 points, 7 assists, 2 steals, 1 rebound, and 2 turnovers in 25 minutes off the bench. Lowry was 3-8 from the field and 3-3 from the free throw line. Lowry once again out-performed starter Mike Conley, who had 4 points and 3 assists.\n\nFoye had 17 points, 4 assists, 2 rebounds, 1 steal, and 0 turnovers in 34 minutes. Randy was 8-16 from the field and 1-3 from three. He has been handling the starting point guard duties since Sebastian Telfair got injured in early February. Foye has shown solid progression each month since his return from injury.\n\nJanuary: 9.0 pts, 1.0 ast\n\nFebruary: 10.0 pts, 2.6 ast\n\nMarch: 12.5 pts, 5.3 ast\n\nApril: 14.8 pts, 4.3 ast\n\nGrant to transfer\n\nMalcolm Grant has received a release to transfer. Jay Wright stated, \"Malcolm is an integral part of our basketball family and a great young man. He has been exemplary as a student and a teammate at Villanova. However, he deserves starters' minutes. We are grateful for all that Malcolm has given to Villanova and support him in this decision.\"\n\nIt's a shame to see Malcolm leave, but I wish him the best of luck wherever he ends up. He struggled to find playing time in Villanova's crowded backcourt this season, and if Villanova lands Tyreke Evans, Grant would have had even more difficultly getting on the floor next season.\n\nI think he should have received more playing time this past season. Who knows what would have happened if Malcolm played more, but without him Villanova would have lost to LSU and Pitt at home. Those losses would have put Villanova at 18-14, and most likely out of the NCAA Tournament. So even though he played a total of two minutes in three tournament games, Villanova never could have made their Sweet Sixteen run without Malcolm Grant."
