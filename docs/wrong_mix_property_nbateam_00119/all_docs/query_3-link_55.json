        "text": "The Philadelphia 76ers were founded in 1946 and began play in Syracuse and were known as the Nationals, they moved to Philadelphia in 1963 and have called the “City of Brotherly Love” home since. Winners of three NBA titles, nine conference titles, and five division titles, the Sixers have left their mark in the city and the league.\n\nThe Sixers have had some all-time great NBA players suit up for them, some went on to other cities and continued their great careers, others stayed and retired wearing their colors.

He played 582 games for the Sixers and averaged 8.3 points per game. There will be much fancier names on this list, but Dalembert was a hard worker.\n\n22. George McGinnis - F\n\nStats: Points: 17,009, Rebounds:9,233, Assists:3,089\n\nAccolades: 3- Time NBA All-Star\n\nGeorge McGinnis was a bonafide star in the old ABA, in his three seasons with the Sixers he led the team to the 1977 championship, although came up short, he was an All-Star twice.

Iggy as he hates to be called ranks among the top 10 in defensive rebounds, steals, and assists. He was a tough defender and while he would go on to greater things with the Warriors, his time in Philadelphia will not be forgotten.\n\n15.

Ben Simmons - PG\n\nStats: Games Played: 217, Points Per Game: 16.4\n\nAccolades: 2- Time NBA All-Star, NBA All-Defensive First Team (2020), NBA Rookie of the Year (2018), NBA All-Rookie First Team (2018), NBA steals leader (2020)\n\nIn time Ben Simmons will be higher on this list, but for now, his short career looks very promising.

Billy Cunningham - PF\n\nStats: Points: 16,310, Rebounds: 7,981, Assists:3,305\n\nAccolades: 4- Time NBA All-Star (1969–1972), NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team, No. 32 retired by Philadelphia 76ers\n\nChampionships: 1\n\nBilly Cunningham did it all in a Sixers uniform, he won a championship as a player and then as a coach. He played 654 games for the team and even at 6-6 he still averaged 20.8 points per game and 10 rebounds. On the bench, he is the winningest coach in the team’s history.\n\n9. Maurice Cheeks - PG\n\nStats: Points: 12,195, Assists:7,392, Steals:2,310\n\nAccolades: 4-Time NBA All-Star, 4-Time NBA All-Defensive First Team, No. 10 retired by Philadelphia 76ers\n\nChampionships: 1\n\nMaurice Cheeks is considered by many to be one of the best point guards in NBA history. He ranks fifth in all-time steals in the NBA and first in 76ers history. He was one of the main pieces of the 1983 championship and his number was retired as a testament to the man who played 853 games for the team.\n\n8. Moses Malone - C\n\nStats: Points: 29,580, Rebounds:17,834, Assists:1,936\n\nAccolades: 3- Time NBA MVP, 12-Time NBA All-Star, 6-Time NBA rebounding leader, NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team, No. 2 retired by Philadelphia 76ers, No. 24 retired by Houston Rockets, Mr. Basketball USA (1974)\n\nChampionships: 1\n\nMoses Malone is a great, hands down. He should be much higher on this list but we are only looking at his four seasons in Philadelphia. Which were not at all bad, he was the Finals MVP and averaged 21 points per game in his four seasons. He has the honor of having his number retired by two teams, the Sixers and the Rockets. An all-time great.\n\n7. Joel Embiid - C\n\nStats: Games Played: 209, 23.9 Points per Game\n\nAccolades: 3-Time NBA All-Star\n\nJoel Embiid has built quite an impressive resume in Philadelphia.

Schayes was just 4 games shy of playing 1,000 games for the Sixers.\n\n5. Charles Barkley - PF\n\nStats: Points: 23,757, Rebounds: 12,546, Assists:4,215\n\nAccolades: NBA MVP (1993), 11-Time NBA All-Star, NBA All-Star Game MVP (1991), NBA rebounding leader (1987), No. 34 retired by Philadelphia 76ers, No. 34 retired by Phoenix Suns, NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team\n\nSir Charles Barkley, what can we say, he did it all, the only thing that was missing was a championship.

He played over 600 games and played six All-Star games representing the team. His number was retired by both the 76ers and Suns.\n\n4.

That’s all you can say when you look at the career of Wilt Chamberlain, he was a baddddd man on the Basketball court. What didn’t he do? A native of Philadelphia he brought a title home in 1967. He averaged 27.6 points per game, 23! Rebounds per game. He won NBA MVP three years in a row and just was a points machine.
