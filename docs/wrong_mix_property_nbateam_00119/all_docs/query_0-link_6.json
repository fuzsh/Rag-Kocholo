        "text": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nPHILADELPHIA — Andre Iguodala scored 19 of his 28 points in the second half, Samuel Dalembert had 11 points, 18 rebounds and five blocks, and the Philadelphia 76ers rallied for a 91-87 victory over the New Jersey Nets on Saturday night.\n\nAndre Miller had 21 points and five assists, and Lou Williams added 15 points on 4-for-6 shooting from the field for the Sixers, who have won 17 of their last 22 games.\n\nVince Carter led New Jersey with 27 points but was only 10-for-25 from the floor. Richard Jefferson was held to 11 points on 3-for-15 shooting.\n\nPhiladelphia beat New Jersey for the first time this season. The Nets had won the first two meetings this season and last three overall.\n\nThe Sixers led 49-42 at halftime after both teams, each coming off losses the night before, played poorly in the first 24 minutes. In a lethargic half, the Sixers committed 10 turnovers, while the Nets shot only 33 per cent, including 2-for-11 from 3-point range.\n\nFortunately, Saturday night was “Sci-Fi night at the Sixers.” Movie vignettes starring the Sixers players were shown on the overhead scoreboard during timeouts — and often were more entertaining than the game itself.\n\nNew Jersey woke up in the third and scored 13 straight to take a 66-58 lead. Carter muscled Miller into the paint and threw down a vintage dunk over Dalembert to give the Nets a 75-66 lead, their largest to that point.\n\nThe Sixers responded with an 8-0 spurt to regain the lead at 78-77. Marcus Williams followed with a 3 to put the Nets up one, but a three-second violation, offensive foul on Devin Harris and subsequent technical foul on Harris allowed the Sixers to go up 82-80 with 5:46 left.\n\nMiller spun by Marcus Williams for a layup, and Iguodala used a pretty crossover to get to the goal and give the Sixers an 86-83 edge with 3:34 to go. Dalembert preserved the lead with a nice block of Josh Boone in close, but Carter freed himself for a slam to make it 86-85 with 1:51 remaining.\n\nIguodala hit four straight free throws in the final 30 seconds to help seal it for the Sixers."
