        "text": "High school and college career\n\nDalembert was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti and lived there for fourteen years before moving to Montreal, where he attended Lucien-Pagé (High School). He attended high school at St. Patrick High School in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He then went on to play college basketball at Seton Hall from 1999 to 2001.\n\nProfessional career\n\nDalembert was selected with the 26th overall pick by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 2001 NBA draft. After playing 8 seasons with the 76ers, he was traded to the Sacramento Kings for Andrés Nocioni and Spencer Hawes on June 17, 2010.\n\nOn December 26, 2011, he signed a multi-year deal with the Houston Rockets.\n\nOn June 27, 2012, Dalembert was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks, along with the 14th pick in the 2012 NBA draft, for Jon Brockman, Jon Leuer, Shaun Livingston, and the 12th pick in the 2012 NBA draft.\n\nOn July 19, 2013, Dalembert signed with the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nOn June 25, 2014, Dalembert, along with Shane Larkin, Wayne Ellington, José Calderón and two 2014 second-round picks, was traded to the New York Knicks in exchange for Tyson Chandler and Raymond Felton. On January 5, 2015, he was waived by the Knicks.\n\nOn August 6, 2015, Dalembert signed with the Dallas Mavericks, returning to the franchise for a second stint. However, he was later waived by the Mavericks on October 24 prior to the start of the regular season. He appeared in four preseason games for the team, but a left leg injury forced him to miss the final three games of the preseason schedule. On December 17, 2015, he signed with Shanxi Zhongyu of the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nNational team career\n\nAfter much anticipation, Dalembert became a Canadian citizen on August 7, 2007 and joined the Canadian national team in hopes of qualifying for the Olympics. He was a part of Canada's pre-tournament training camp, taking part in games in both Toronto and Hamilton during the 2008 Jack Donohue International Classic, with wins over both Lebanon and New Zealand. However, Dalembert was later dismissed from the team during the World Olympic Qualifying Tournament due to a rift between him and coach Leo Rautins.\n\nHaiti earthquake\n\nDalembert decided to travel to Haiti to help with relief efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He also pledged $100,000 to UNICEF."
