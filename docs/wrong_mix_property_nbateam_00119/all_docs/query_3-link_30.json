        "text": "Samuel Davis Dalembert (born May 10, 1981) is a professional basketball player who plays center with the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers. \"Sammy\" as he is commonly referred to as, was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. He started playing hoops in Montreal and played his college ball at Seton Hall University.\n\nSamuel Dalembert is currently the starting center for the Philadelphia 76ers. He is a consistent double-double achiever and averages 3 blocks per game - ranking him one of the leagues elite shot blockers.\n\nHe missed the entire 2003-2004 season due to injuries.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Dalembert is a clutch free throw shooter — despite his low season free throw percentage — as demonstrated in the January 13th game against the Boston Celtics when he hit all eight attempts in the Sixers' 125-124 win.\n\nSamuel is now a Canadian citizen and Montrealer, and intends to play for Canada in 2008 for the Olympics.\n\n[]\n\nCurrent Stats\n\nMore Current Stats\n\nit:Samuel Dalembert"
