        "text": "The 76ers immediately asked the NBA to review an elbow thrown by Orlando's Dwight Howard in the first quarter of Tuesday night's Game 5.\n\nHoward threw an elbow at Philadelphia center Samuel Dalembert after the two got tangled up underneath the basket.\n\nMany expect Howard to be suspended for Game 6 because of the incident, and the 76ers claim he should have been thrown out of Game 5 following the elbow.\n\n\"I'll let the NBA deal with that,\" Dalembert said after the game. \"If it was me, I'd have been thrown out already.\"\n\nFormer 76ers general manager Billy King still believes that Allen Iverson can be a starter in the NBA, it's just a matter of him coming to terms with a reduced role.\n\n\"Any player of his stature, it has to be hard when that happens,\" King said of teams asking for Iverson to lessen his role.\n\n\"Guys who can adjust can play in the league a long time. Look at Reggie Miller. But Allen has to understand that he is not going to be the player who is going to take the most shots. He has to be able to say, 'My job is to be the leader and figure out how I can help the team win with my experience and knowledge.' \"\n\nKing hinted that it's easier said then done, and that Iverson will have to change his game slightly.\n\n\"He has to come to that realization,\" King said. \"If he wants to continue playing in the league, he has to adjust.\"\n\n76ers coach Tony DiLeo claims that you can see just how badly Andre Iguodala wants to beat the Magic in the first round by looking in his eyes.\n\nIguodala is averaging 23.3 points per game, after posting just 13.2 points in last season's first round exit.\n\n\"Andre really wants it,\" DiLeo said. \"You can see it. He's on a mission. We're seeing him grow before our eyes.\"\n\nRegardless of how determined Philadelphia is heading into Game 4 against Orlando, they are aware that the favored Magic are going to be hungry for a win as well.\n\n\"Desperation,\" point guard Andre Miller said. \"They're going to come out and play hard.\"\n\nThaddeus Young entered his name into playoff lore on Friday night with a game-winning layup for the 76ers.\n\n- Cleveland 79, Detroit 68\n\nTeam FIC Differential: Cavaliers +23.7, Pistons -23.7\n\nThe Cavaliers (3-0) clamped down defensively to push the Pistons (0-3) to the brink of elimination with a win on Friday night in Detroit.
