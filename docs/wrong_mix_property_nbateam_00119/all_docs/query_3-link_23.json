        "text": "June 19, 2015\n\nOn Monday, June 22, the Pirate Blue Athletic Fund will host the annual Hall of Fame Golf Outing and Dinnerat Fairmount Country Club in Chatham, N.J. In advance of the event, SHUPirates.com profiled the four exceptional individuals who will comprise the Seton Hall Athletics Hall of Fame Class of 2015.\n\nToday, we feature feature Samuel Dalembert, a talented center whose ongoing professional career has spanned nearly 15 seasons in the NBA. A native of Haiti, Dalembert arrived at The Hall from St. Patrick High School in Elizabeth and went on to become the top shot-blocker in program history before being selected by the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round of the 2001 NBA Draft.\n\n*Note: All-time women's tennis wins leader Kristen (Downing) Liteplo was originally announced as part of the Hall of Fame Class of 2015. She is now scheduled to be a part of the Class of 2016.\n\n- - - - -\n\nHow can someone known for philanthropy carve out a distinguished career that is largely based on rejection?\n\nSuch is the case of big man Sam Dalembert.\n\nA native of the capital city of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Dalembert eventually made his way from the island nation to nearby Elizabeth as an emergent prospect with a promising future on the hardwood.\n\nHis time as a star at the legendary St. Patrick High School earned a top-30 ranking from national recruiting services as well as the attention of coaches around the country; including current assistant coach Fred Hill who was in his first stint at The Hall.\n\nThe connection that developed between the two led to the imposing center choosing to don the blue & white, joining a talented squad that was looking to elevate its performance to the next level.\n\nPrior to Dalembert's arrival for the 1999-00 campaign, the Pirates had missed out on NCAA Tournament play in five consecutive seasons. With the addition of a 7-footer to a core that featured Seton Hall Athletics Hall of Famer Shaheen Holloway as well as stars like Rimas Kaukenas and Darius Lane, the identity of Tommy Amaker's team was immediately transformed.\n\nDalembert quickly emerged as a prolific shot blocker; the likes of which Seton Hall had not seen in decades. He was at home in the paint and uniquely adept at turning potential intruders away.\n\nDuring his freshman season, he racked up a BIG EAST-best 107 swats while helping The Hall post 20+ wins overall and 10+ wins in league play for the first time since the conference championship season of 1992-93. One of his most memorable defensive efforts came just months into his collegiate career as he rejected 11 shots in a victory over rival St. John's; a single-game school record that still stands today.\n\nA BIG EAST All-Rookie Team selection, Dalembert had helped lift SHU back in the national tournament for the first time since 1993-94. During the inspiring run that ensued, The Hall scored upset wins over seventh-seeded Oregon and second-seeded Temple to advance to the Sweet 16 for the fourth time in program history.\n\nAs a sophomore the following year, the Haitian-born standout totaled 60 more blocks, rising to first on the school's official all-time list despite only playing two seasons in a Pirate uniform. On the game's biggest stage in Madison Square Garden, he registered seven rejections against St. John's to ignite The Hall's first run to the BIG EAST Tournament semifinals since 1994.\n\nHis seven blocks in the opening round against the Red Storm are still a record-high for a Pirate at the conference tournament.\n\nHaving established himself as one of the most formidable defensive forces in the collegiate game, Dalembert was poised to take the next step in his career. On June 27, 2001, the Philadelphia 76ers selected Dalembert with the 26th pick of the NBA draft; making him just the second native of Haiti ever selected in the first round.\n\nFor the last 14 seasons, the former Pirate has consistently ranked among the league's top post defenders while shining off the court as well through extensive charitable efforts that have brought a number of programs to the people of Haiti."
