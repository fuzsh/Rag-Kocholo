        "text": "Paul George turned in a starring effort as the Indiana Pacers surprised the New York Knicks in overtime, 102-96, on Wednesday night.\n\nIt appeared New York was on its way to victory until Iman Shumpert fouled George from beyond the arc in the final seconds. At the charity stripe, George hit all three shots to tie the game and force overtime, which he took over with plays like this step-back jumper:\n\nGeorge finished the game with 35 points, five rebounds and five steals, delivering his usual impact on both sides of the court. Roy Hibbert didn't quite match that performance, recording just eight points, five rebounds and two blocks, but this buzzer-beating three was pretty nifty:\n\nThe Knicks got 30 points and 18 rebounds from Carmelo Anthony, but he needed 28 shots to get there. With the loss, New York drops to 3-8, while Indiana's record improves to 10-1.\n\nRaptors 108, 76ers 98\n\nToronto got another huge game from DeMar DeRozan on Wednesday to improve to 5-7 this season. The shooting guard scored 33 points on 10-of-19 against Philly, his third consecutive game with at least 29 points.\n\nThe Raptors didn't win the previous two games, but 14 made three-pointers helped put away the Sixers. DeRozan, Kyle Lowry and Terrence Ross each hit three from beyond the arc, while Rudy Gay hit a pair as part of a 18-point, eight-assist, eight-rebound performance.\n\nClippers 102, Timberwolves 98\n\nMinnesota nearly survived an ice-cold night from Kevin Love to get an impressive victory over the Clippers. While Kevin Martin (28 points, 10 rebounds) and Nikola Pekovic (20 and 7) both played well, the Timberwolves kept things close despite Love's miserable 2-of-14 shooting effort from the field.\n\nHowever, Chris Paul and the Clips were just too much. With 20 points and 11 assists, Paul managed to set an NBA record on Wednesday night:\n\nL.A. also got 20 points and 10 rebounds from Blake Griffin in the win.\n\nHeat 120, Magic 92\n\nBoth teams shot quite well from beyond the arc, but Orlando had little else going for it in this lopsided loss. LeBron James finished with 21 points, James Jones added 17, and the Heat ended up with a 38-20 advantage on points in the paint.\n\nArron Afflalo had another impressive scoring night for the Magic, scoring 30 points on 9-of-16 shooting, but the defense just couldn't stop Miami's well-oiled machine:\n\nWizards 98, Cavaliers 91\n\nWashington led by as many as 27 points before rallying to make things interesting, but the Wizards were able to sustain their lead and take their second straight win. Bradley Beal delivered another big game with 28 points, eight assists and seven rebounds while Nene added 24 points, eight rebounds and six assists in the win.\n\nIt appeared that the Wizards were on their way to an easy victory after extending a 75-48 lead in the second half, but the Cavaliers eventually came back to trail only 90-86 with less than two minutes remaining. For a team that's struggled to close out games this season, Washington found its footing to avoid another last-minute debacle in Cleveland.\n\nKyrie Irving led Cleveland with 28 points and six assists in another superb effort.\n\nHawks 93, Pistons 85\n\nFacing former star Josh Smith for the first time, Atlanta rode its new cornerstones to a victory on Wednesday night. Behind Jeff Teague, Paul Millsap and Al Horford, the Hawks improved to 7-5 with an eight-point victory. Teague finished with 18 points and seven assists, including this sweet dish to Millsap:\n\nMeanwhile, Smith didn't do so hot against his old teammates:\n\nThe Pistons got 21 points, seven rebounds and six assists from Brandon Jennings, but it wasn't enough on a night when Smith and Greg Monroe struggled. The two star forwards were a combined 8-of-23 for 18 points in 70 minutes on Wednesday.\n\nSpurs 104, Celtics 93\n\nSan Antonio led by as many as 19 in the fourth quarter to improve its conference-best record to 10-1. Tony Parker scored 19 points, Tiago Splitter recorded a double-double and Kawhi Leonard had a strong game with 16 points, eight rebounds and five steals.\n\nThe Celtics got 19 points apiece from Jared Sullinger, Jeff Green and Avery Bradley. Sullinger also grabbed a career-high 17 rebounds in a productive performance that could earn him a greater role going forward.\n\nTrail Blazers 91, Bucks 82\n\nPortland continues its astounding road success with a nine-point win in Milwaukee. Now 6-1 away from the Rose Garden in 2013-14, the Trail Blazers have the best road record in the NBA, and their 10-2 record trails only the Spurs and Pacers.\n\nLaMarcus Aldridge led Portland with 21 points and seven rebounds, while Damian Lillard added 19 points. Nicolas Batum only took six shots, but still made an impact with eight points, eight rebounds and eight assists.\n\nThe Bucks had a balanced scoring effort, with Luke Ridnour's 13 points leading the way. Nine different players scored at least five points for Milwaukee.\n\nBobcats 95, Nets 91\n\nAt what point do we become genuinely worried about the Brooklyn Nets? Now 3-8 this season after another loss Wednesday -- this time to Charlotte -- it's getting harder to shrug off these struggles to small sample sizes, early-season rust and the like.\n\nWhile a four-point loss on the road doesn't seem terrible, the Nets actually trailed by as many as 16 in the second half before showing some urgency. And if the team expects to depend on aging players like Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett come May, it's a tad scary when KG is getting posterized by the likes of Bismack Biyombo:\n\nGarnett played just 21 minutes in this game, while Williams left in the first half after aggravating an ankle injury.\n\nThe Bobcats got their big effort from point guard Kemba Walker, who finished with 31 points on 12-of-20 shooting. Ramon Sessions and Gerald Henderson also added 13 points apiece, the only two other Bobcats to score in double-digits.\n\nPelicans 105, Jazz 98\n\nIt always feels appropriate when the Jazz drop by New Orleans Arena, but the Anthony Davis Show remains the real attraction in the Big Easy these days. On Wednesday, the former No. 1 pick dazzled with 22 points, nine rebounds, eight blocks and four assists as the Pelicans improved to 5-6 on the season.\n\nWith so many pieces still trying to fit, Davis didn't get much help again Wednesday, but Ryan Anderson continued his hot shooting with a 19-point performance. The sweet-stroking big man hit 4-of-6 three-point attempts against Utah after dropping 26 points in his season debut earlier this week.\n\nEnes Kanter led the Jazz with 19 points and nine rebounds, while Gordon Hayward added 11 assists in the loss.\n\nMavericks 123, Rockets 120\n\nThe Mavs out-scored Houston 35-19 in the fourth quarter behind the stellar play of Dirk Nowitzki, Monte Ellis and Shawn Marion to steal an incredible win against the Rockets. Marion's corner three-pointer with :47 seconds remaining gave Dallas its first lead since 2-0 early in the first quarter. The Rockets had a chance to tie at the end, but James Harden missed a tightly contested three.\n\nEllis and Nowitzki were stellar in the victory for Dallas. Ellis went off for 37 points points on 13-of-18 shooting and added eight assists. Nowitzki finished with 35 pionts and seven rebounds.\n\nHouston was in control for the majority of the night. Faced up against the likes of Samuel Dalembert and DeJuan Blair, Rockets big man Dwight Howard had a field day against Dallas on Wednesday. Shooting 12-of-16 from the field, Howard recorded 33 points and 11 rebounds to power Houston in a losing effort.\n\nGrizzlies 88, Warriors 81 (OT)\n\nMike Conley scored 19 points, none bigger than his tie-breaking three-pointer with 1:36 remaining in overtime to give the Memphis Grizzlies a road win over the Golden State Warriors in Oakland. Zach Randolph added 21 points and 12 rebounds for Memphis, winners of four straight games.\n\nKlay Thompson scored 21 to lead the Warriors, who were without Stephon Curry, who was out with a concussion. Andrew Bogut had 12 points and 14 rebounds for Golden State, who have dropped 11 straight games to the Grizzlies.\n\nKings 113, Suns 106\n\nPowered by 44 points in the fourth quarter, Sacramento slipped by Phoenix on Wednesday. It wasn't due to a lack of fourth-quarter offensive punch by the Suns, either, as they put up 39 points in what's presumably one of the highest-scoring periods in recent memory.\n\nDespite the high scoring total, no Kings player scored more than Isaiah Thomas, who finished with 23 points on 8-of-13 shooting. 10 different players scored six or more points for Sacramento, including 19 from DeMarcus Cousins and 13 from Greivis Vasquez.\n\nMore from SB Nation NBA:\n\n• Roth: Let's improve Dwyane Wade's new TV show!\n\n• Why J.J.
