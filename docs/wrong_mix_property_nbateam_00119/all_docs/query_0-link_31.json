        "text": "They run a Philly bar on TV, and next year it will be for real.\n\nRob McElhenney and Kaitlin Olson, the husband and wife who play Mac and Sweet Dee on FX's It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, will be investors in a bar at 226 Market St. in Old City, now operating as Skinner's.\n\nCenter City lawyer William Morrin confirmed that the couple are backing prospective operators Ben Haney and Eric Vesotsky, McElhenney's friends from St. Joseph's Prep. The Upper Darby-born, South Philly-bred McElhenney graduated in 1995.\n\nOn the comedy - which cocreator McElhenney sold to the network six years ago under the high-concept description \"Seinfeld on crack\" - the Mac character is part-owner of a South Philly bar called Paddy's Pub.\n\nThe new place will be called Mac's Olde Towne Tavern, and it will maintain its feel as a drinker's bar, Morrin said. He was unsure of a timetable but said it would open early next year. The deal had been rumored at phoodie.info.\n\nSkinner's partner Peter Schriber said a closing date was not set.\n\nStepping up\n\nHe can dance, for sure, but will he graduate? University of the Arts sophomore\n\nRussell Ferguson\n\nsaid Friday that he feels like he's \"floating in a dream. . . . I think I'm about to wake up and things will be normal.\" Ferguson, 20, won Season 6 of Fox's\n\nSo You Think You Can Dance\n\n($250,000 prize, plus a national tour and an appearance on the Oscars) by \"krumping\" - a style of street dance. He's on leave from UArts, and said he's not sure he's coming back. The Boston native praised UArts' \"open environment\" and its dance faculty, especially\n\nKim Bears-Bailey\n\n,\n\nZane Booker\n\n,\n\nCrystal Frazier\n\n, and\n\nCurt Haworth\n\n. Simple career goal: \"I just want to bring a smile to people's faces,\" he said.\n\nVoilà\n\nTables at Bibou, a 32-seat French restaurant near the Italian Market, are even harder to come by now that the BYOB is seventh in critic\n\nAlan Richman\n\n's list of the nation's 10 best new restaurants in January's GQ. Richman, who eons ago wrote for the old Philadelphia Evening Bulletin, burbled on and on about the Frenchness of it all, and called Bibou's \"moist, creamy pig's-head terrine practically the French countryside on a plate.\" Compounding the reservation issue: Owners\n\nPierre and Charlotte Calmels\n\nwill close for two weeks' vacation after Jan. 17.\n\nThe circuit\n\nActress\n\nLeslie Caron\n\ngot an unexpected gift when she was here this month. The\n\nGigi\n\nstar's mother, dancer\n\nMargaret \"Peggy\" Petit\n\n, was the subject of a 1919 portrait by\n\nAmbrose McCarthy Patterson\n\n. The artist's daughter,\n\nYvonne Patterson\n\n, lives in Flourtown and wanted Caron to have it. Miss Patterson is up in years, and a friend of hers,\n\nSusan Johnson\n\nof Erdenheim, reached out to Inquirer film critic\n\nCarrie Rickey\n\nto facilitate delivery. At the Free Library before Caron's Dec. 2 appearance, Johnson gave the painting to Caron, who tucked it into her leather satchel. Caron was on her way to get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nTwo Liberty Place residents say Phillies pitcher Cole Hamels, wife Heidi, and baby son Caleb have left the fancy high-rise in favor of their new digs, a four-bedroom in Newtown Square.\n\nHeadline this: \"Pork for Duchess of York at Fork.\" Sarah Ferguson, here touting the film Young Victoria, lunched at Fork in Old City Thursday, and the menu included charcuterie, a pappardelle appetizer, salad, and grilled chicken.\n\nFilmland\n\nAt least two young locals have lead roles in films exhibiting next month at Sundance in Park City, Utah: Lower Merion-bred\n\nSarah Steele\n\n, 21, who starred in 2004's\n\nSpanglish\n\nand is a student at Columbia University, is in the comedy\n\nPlease Give\n\nwith\n\nAmanda Peet\n\n,\n\nOliver Platt\n\n, and\n\nCatherine Keener\n\n, and Bristol's\n\nCharlie Saxton\n\n, 20, is in the\n\nJoel Schumacher\n\ndrama\n\nTwelve\n\n. Both are repped by\n\nEdie Robb\n\nat Station 3 Entertainment.\n\nNolan Reese, son of Eagles voice Merrill Reese and his wife, Cindy, was an assistant visual effects editor on the new blockbuster Avatar. He's working on Iron Man 2 with Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson.\n\nLandmarks\n\nMoore College of Art and Design got a head start last week on the installation of\n\nHaustorium\n\n, a 40-foot mural by London artist\n\nPaul Morrison\n\n. The piece, part of the Philagrafika exhibition that will start Jan. 29, spans the exterior of Moore, at 20th and Race Streets. It incorporates found images of trees and shrubs culled from various sources that are manipulated, edited, and collaged to create a landscape growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk. The large tulip symbolizes a hopeful reminder of the spring yet to come - not soon enough, after this weekend's weather - and the persistence of nature.\n\nThose seeking to bunk at the new Le Méridien hotel at 1421 Arch St., across from the Municipal Services Building, should hang on to their satchels. Though it has appeared finished for some time, Starwood has moved back the grand opening to April 15 - seven months after an initial target. A spokeswoman said unexpected issues had arisen with the restoration of the 1912 Georgian Revival building, designed by Horace Trumbauer.\n\nPhilling orders\n\nHow long ago were Phillies fans swiping their credit cards to obtain\n\nCliff Lee\n\ngear? The Phillies' Majestic Clubhouse Store at Citizens Bank Park is taking 50 percent off the price of its jerseys with the pitcher's name and No. 34 as\n\nRoy Halladay\n\nmerchandise, also with No. 34, arrives. PhillyPhaithful.com founder\n\nDan Hershberg\n\nis offering coupons to those who bought \"Thanks, Cleveland\" shirts on his site when Lee arrived and now want to buy shirts reading \"The Doc Is In.\"\n\nNext step for Abraham\n\nWe have not heard the last of\n\nLynne Abraham\n\n, the outgoing district attorney, who dropped hints about her future in an interview with\n\nLarry Kane\n\nthat will be shown on his\n\nVoice of Reason\n\n(5:30 p.m. Wednesday on the Comcast Network, replayed at 11 p.m. next Sunday). She says not only that she has an unspecified job lined up, but also that she plans to seek elective office again. Governor? Attorney general? No clues."
