        "text": "The Sixers return from the All-Star break tonight, with hopes to make a run up the Eastern Conference standings and get into position to contend for the NBA Finals.\n\nBut the slow basketball week got us thinking... Who are the best players in Philadelphia 76ers history?\n\nThe franchise traces its roots back to 1946, when the Sixers were then the Syracuse Nationals. The Nationals moved to Philadelphia and became the 76ers in 1963.\n\nOver the years, a handful of Hall of Fame players have made Philadelphia their home. But in almost 80 years, there's been only three championships. Thus, finding the top 76 players meant searching through the good, the bad and the ugly.\n\nWe ranked players taking into consideration a few factors. The longer a player played with the organization, the more important they were to the team. We factored in stats like win shares and Value Over Replacement Player (VORP), as well as basic stat lines. Players who didn't play a full season with the organization were not included.\n\nHere are our picks, from No. 76 down to No. 1.\n\n76. Michael Carter-Williams\n\nThe Sixers selected the guard from Syracuse at No. 11 in the 2013 NBA Draft, and despite him winning Rookie of the Year before being traded in Year 2, MCW will always be remembered as the player the Sixers took while passing on Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nThe full worth of that 2015 trade is still being determined.\n\n75. Jim Washington\n\n\"Jumpin' Jimmy\" Washington was a Villanova and West Catholic High School (Philadelphia) grad and the sixth overall pick by St. Louis in the 1966 NBA Draft before the Sixers traded with Chicago to acquire Washington prior to the 1969-70 season. Washington averaged 12.9 points and 9.3 rebounds per game during parts of three seasons with Philadelphia.\n\n74. Ed Conlin\n\nConlin is our fist Syracuse Nationals player in the countdown to No. 1. The organization picked him No. 5 in the 1955 draft after winning a championship, and Conlin would go on to average 12.1 points, 5.9 rebounds and 2.4 assists during his three-plus seasons with Syracuse.\n\n73. Shawn Bradley\n\nTrolling? Maybe. But Bradley was probably unfairly regarded as a bust after the Sixers selected him second overall in the 1993 NBA Draft. He would go on to a pretty solid career, which included 143 games in Philadelphia. His second season was most impressive, when he averaged 9.5 points, 8 rebounds and 3.3 blocks per game, albeit on a pretty bad 1994-95 club.\n\n72. Spencer Hawes\n\nHawes was brought to Philadelphia from Sacramento in a deal that sent Samuel Dalembert (more on him later) to the Kings. Hawes, the 10th pick in the 2007 draft, developed into a pretty reliable player during his three-plus years with the Sixers. His final per-game stat line in 253 games: 10 points, 7 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1.2 blocks.\n\n71. Kenny Thomas\n\nThe Sixers brought in Thomas two years after their run to the Finals to try and get back. The power forward was solid during parts of three seasons in Philly (12 points, 8.7 rebounds per game over 167 games), but the Sixers sent him to the Kings in a deal that brought Chris Webber to Philadelphia.\n\n70. Cliff Robinson\n\nNo, the other Cliff Robinson. Robinson joined the 1986-87 Sixers on a team that featured Charles Barkley, Julius Erving, Maurice Cheeks and Andrew Toney. Somehow, that club, with Robinson chipping in nearly 15 points and more than 5 rebounds per game, didn't make it out of the first round. With Dr. J out of the picture, Robinson (19 points per game) took over a larger scoring role the following year.\n\n69. Evan Turner\n\nIt took a few years, but the Ohio State product the Sixers selected second overall in 2010 became a do-it-all point guard before Philadelphia traded him to Indiana for Danny Granger, who never played a game for the Sixers. Turner's 2013-14 season that helped raise his value featured 17.4 points, 6 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game over 54 games before the deal.\n\n68. Tom Van Arsdale\n\nVan Arsdale defines what it is to be a compiler. On Sixers teams that won 9, 25 and 34 games during his three seasons, Van Arsdale averaged 18.6 points and 5.2 rebounds per game.\n\n67. Darrall Imhoff\n\nImhoff played just two seasons for the Sixers between 1968 and 1970, but he's among the more valuable players in franchise history. In 161 regular-season games, he averaged 11.3 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game.\n\n66. Dario Saric\n\nDid anyone represent the end of The Process in a better way than Saric? During parts of three seasons on Sixers teams ready to turn the corner, Saric (13.5 points, 6.5 rebounds per game) became a fan favorite and reliable forward that helped bring Jimmy Butler to the Sixers for a playoff run in 2018-19.\n\n65. Willie Green\n\nGreen played seven seasons with the Sixers from 2003-04 to 2010, a stretch that included zero playoff series wins. But Green, a second-round pick by Seattle who was immediately traded to the Sixers, played 422 games with the club and averaged 9.4. points per game.\n\nCOLUMN: Sixers are gearing up for the stretch run\n\nSTARS SAY: 'Kind of scary how good we can be'\n\n64. Jeff Hornacek\n\nThey weren't very pretty seasons, but the 1992-93 and 1993-94 Sixers paired Hornacek's sharp shooting with Clarence Weatherspoon. Hornacek played 132 games with the 76ers and averaged a career-best 18.1 points per game.\n\n63. Robert Covington\n\nSimilar to Saric, \"RoCo\" became a fan favorite in Philly after the Sixers took a chance on a D-League player in the Houston organization. They built him into one of the game's more reliable Three-and-D perimeter players during five seasons. Covington was shooting 39% from deep before the Sixers traded him with Saric for Butler.\n\n62. Chris Webber\n\nSure, Webber is one of the better players to don a Sixers uniform, but he was 31 and had 11-plus seasons under his belt before the Sixers acquired him in 2005. Though Webber posted numbers of 17.9 points and 9.3 rebounds per game over parts of three seasons here, his pairing with Allen Iverson didn't result in much winning. The team lost in the first round in 2005 and failed to make the playoffs the next two years.\n\n61. JJ Redick\n\nRedick's value to the Sixers became a little clearer after he was gone. This year's Sixers very clearly miss the spacing that Redick's 40.7% 3-point shooting provided during his two seasons with the team. The 17.6 points per game Redick had with the Sixers is the highest average in his five-team career.\n\n60. Tobias Harris\n\nHarris just reached 82 games played with the Sixers last week, and if this list is done three years from now, the hope for Sixers fans is that he'd be much higher. Philly committed $180 million over five years to Harris, who comes out of the All-Star break averaging 19 points, 6.7 rebounds and 3 assists per game.\n\n59. Al Cervi\n\nCervi was inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1985. He leads the Sixers in win shares per 48 minutes. Cervi played four seasons with the Syracuse Nationals from 1949 to 1953 and later coached the team to a league championship in 1955.\n\n58. Johnny Dawkins\n\nDawkins played the bulk of his career – five seasons – with the Sixers from 1989 to 1994. The point guard from Duke helped lead the Sixers to the second round of the playoffs in his first season and got hurt in Year 2. Dawkins averaged 10.7 points and 5.7 assists per game in 313 games with Philadelphia.\n\n57. Jrue Holiday\n\nBoy, would Jrue Holiday look good on this current Sixers. Philadelphia drafted the guard 17th overall in 2009, arguably one of the best draft picks of the 2000s, as he has outperformed all but three players picked ahead of him that year, according to the Value Over Replacement Player stat. The rebuilding Sixers shipped Holiday in a draft-night trade in 2013 to New Orleans after four seasons (13.4 points, 5.8 assists, 3.6 rebounds per game). They acquired Nerlens Noel and a pick that would later turn into Dario Saric and other assets.\n\n56. Tyrone Hill\n\nThere was never anything overly impressive about Tyrone Hill's game, but he was an important part of a Sixers team that made a run to the NBA Finals in 2001, during which his best performance came in the deciding Game 5. Hill posted 18 points and 13 rebounds in 32 minutes in the 108-96 loss. In four seasons in Philly, Hill averaged 9.7 points and 8.4 rebounds per game.\n\n55. Ron Anderson\n\nAnderson started in just 39 of his 393 games as a Sixer, but he was a scorer and volume shooter off the bench, averaging 13 points per game on almost 12 shots a night. Anderson played five seasons in Philadelphia, from 1988 to 1993. He missed just 17 games during that stretch.\n\n54. Paul Neumann\n\nAnother player who was a member of both the Syracuse Nationals and Philadelphia 76ers, Neumann averaged 9 points, 3 assists and nearly 3 rebounds per game in 271 games with the organization. The point guard is probably most remembered for being part of the trade package that brought Wilt Chamberlain to the 76ers.\n\n53. Dana Barros\n\nBarros only played two seasons for the Sixers, and on two pretty bad teams, but his 1994-95 season remains one of the more impressive seasons in franchise history. The 5-11 point guard came to the 76ers via trade from Seattle at age 26. In Year 2, he started and played in all 82 games, averaging 40.5 minutes per game, just behind Vin Baker for the league lead. Barros averaged 20.6 points and 7.5 assists per game that year while shooting 46.4% from 3-point range.\n\n52. Armen Gilliam\n\nGilliam and Barros just missed each other by a season. Gilliam, like Barros, joined the Sixers at age 26 during the 1990-91 season. The Charles Barkley-led Sixers made the second round of the playoffs that year, and Gilliam, who would play in three seasons for the club, averaged 17 points and 6.5 rebounds per game in that postseason.\n\n51. Elton Brand\n\nThe current general manager joined the 76ers as a player in 2007 and played five of his 17 seasons with the club. He was the power forward on under-performing teams that included Holiday, Andre Iguodala, Lou Williams and Thaddeus Young. Brand averaged 12.7 points and 7.2 rebounds per game during his stint in Philadelphia. Now, he's in charge of trying to turn another team that has arguably under-performed expectations into a championship winner.\n\n50. Wali Jones\n\nJones played his high school ball at Overbrook (Wilt Chamberlain's school) and went to Villanova, so it was only fitting he ended up with the 76ers via trade before his second year in the NBA. Jones, a 6-2 point guard, played for the Sixers from 1965 to 1971 and averaged 11.5 points and 3.4 assists per game over 454 games.\n\n49. Earl Lloyd\n\nOver six seasons with the Syracuse Nationals, Lloyd, who at 6-5 played center and forward, played in 413 games and averaged 8.3 points and 6.6 rebounds. Lloyd would go on to become the third African-American coach in the NBA when he coached the Detroit Pistons for a little more than one season. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor in 2003.\n\n48. George Lynch\n\nThe three years Lynch spent with the Sixers during his 12-year career were his best years, likely a product of playing alongside Allen Iverson. Lynch was a starter in 198 of the 200 games he played with the Sixers and averaged 8.8 points and 7.3 rebounds per game as a 6-8 forward. He missed a month during the 2001 playoff run, including the first three NBA Finals games vs. the Lakers. He is now the coach at Clark Atlanta University.\n\n47. Mike Gminski\n\nWhile not in the Basketball Hall of Fame, Gminski would likely have a shot at the Athlete Hair Hall of Fame. The 6-11 big man out of Duke played in four seasons with the Sixers from 1988 to 1991. \"G-Man\" averaged nearly 15 points and 9 rebounds over 240 games with Philadelphia.\n\n46. Kyle Korver\n\nIt seemed at points this past offseason that a reunion between Korver and the Sixers was a possibility as the team looked to upgrade its shooting. What better player to do that than with the No. 2 player in franchise history in 3-point shooting percentage? Korver, who averaged 10.5 points per game while in Philadelphia, played in five seasons with the Sixers and shot 41% from beyond the arc on 1,618 attempts.\n\n45. Lou Williams\n\nIt feels like Williams' game still hasn't aged, as he's a lightning rod of a scorer off the bench to this day for the Los Angeles Clippers. Williams was selected by the Sixers out of high school in the second round of the 2005 NBA Draft. He played his first seven years in Philadelphia, starting in just 38 of his 455 games while averaging 11.3 points and 3 assists per game. He led the Sixers in scoring in 2011-12, a season that ended in the second round of the playoffs, despite not starting a game. He'd go on to win Sixth Man of the Year in 2015, '18 and '19.\n\n44. Jerry Stackhouse\n\nStackhouse played the bulk of his years away from the organization so, like Webber earlier, he'd be a lot higher on the list if he were here longer. The Sixers drafted Stackhouse third overall in 1995, the year before they selected Allen Iverson. The back-court combination didn't work out, and the Sixers opted to keep Iverson and sent Stackhouse to Detroit in December 1997. In parts of three seasons (he played 18 in the NBA) with the Sixers, Stackhouse averaged 19.5 points 3.9 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game.\n\n43. Dikembe Mutombo\n\nHis stint in Philadelphia was short (just 106 of his 1,196 career games), but Mutombo's impact was huge. The Sixers don't sniff the 2001 NBA Finals without him. Mutombo was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2015. He's one of the best shot blockers in league history.\n\n42. Al Bianchi\n\nBianchi played his entire career, 10 seasons and 687 games, with the Syracuse Nationals and Philadelphia 76ers. Those 687 games are seventh in franchise history. A point guard, Bianchi averaged 8.1 points, 2.5 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game.\n\n41. Henry Bibby\n\nBibby was part of a core group of players who had a lot of success in the late 70s and early 80s. Unfortunately for Bibby, though, he didn't get to reap the benefits of the 1983 championship. Instead, Bibby was one of a few players on those teams to lose in both the 1977 and 1980 NBA Finals. Bibby, a point guard, played four seasons and 327 regular-season games plus 56 more in the playoffs with the Sixers. Bibby was a three-time NCAA champion at UCLA.\n\nALL DECADE\n\nDelaware Online's all-decade boys basketball team\n\nDelaware Online's all-decade girls basketball team\n\n40. Derrick Coleman\n\n\"D.C.\" had two stints in Philadelphia, first in his late 20s and later in his mid-to-late 30s. Coleman averaged 13.9 and 8.4 rebounds over 283 games with the Sixers. Coleman was the top pick in the 1990 draft by New Jersey after winning Big East Player of the Year at Syracuse. Coleman is regarded by many basketball experts as a player who never reached his full potential.\n\n39 Thaddeus Young\n\nYoung, now a 31-year-old veteran on a rebuilding Chicago Bulls team, played the first six-plus seasons of his career with the 76ers and averaged 13.7 points and 5.5 rebounds per game. His 516 games played rank 19th in franchise history. The Sixers traded Young to Minnesota in a three-team deal in August 2014 as they prepared to continue to lose games and acquire assets.\n\n38. Andre Miller\n\nMiller played in three seasons with the Sixers from 2006-07 to 2008-09 during a stretch that featured two playoff appearances and first-round exits. Most famously, he was in the deal that sent Iverson to Denver. As the point guard on teams that were led by Andre Iguodala, Miller had a few really productive seasons with the club. In 221 games (220 starts), Miller averaged 15.9 points 6.9 assists and 4.3 rebounds per game.\n\n37. Lee Shaffer\n\nShaffer played just three seasons for the franchise, from 1961 to 1964, when the team moved to Philadelphia, but the 6-7 forward was their best player. During the 1963 playoffs, Shaffer averaged 27.2 points per game over a five-game series that featured outbursts of 32, 34 and 45 points, the last of which coming in a decisive Game 5 defeat. Shaffer's worth to the franchise would come when they used him as a trade chip to acquire Wilt Chamberlain from San Francisco, where Shaffer refused to report, opting to quit altogether.\n\n36. Theo Ratliff\n\nLike Mutombo, Ratliff is most remembered for his ability to protect the rim and block shots for nine different NBA franchises. A first round pick by the Pistons out of Wyoming in the 1995 draft, Ratliff would play the bulk of his career, parts of five seasons over two stints, with the Sixers. In 261 games, Ratliff averaged 10 points, 7 rebounds and 3 blocks per game. His injury in 2001 prompted the Sixers to trade for Mutombo.\n\n35. Dave Gambee\n\nIf we were going solely off win shares alone, Gambee would probably be 10 spots higher. The 6-7 forward out of Oregon State played in seven seasons with the Nationals and 76ers during the 60s and was very valuable, averaging 11.5 points and 5.5 rebounds over 475 games. The bulk of his production came in the pre-Wilt era. Reduced to a bench role thanks in part to Wilt's presence, Gambee was on the 1967 championship team.\n\n34. Aaron McKie\n\nMcKie is about as Philly as it gets as far as basketball goes. Out of Simon Gratz High and Temple University, McKie played eight seasons with the Sixers and now coaches at Temple. The 2001 Sixth Man of the Year was instrumental in helping the Sixers reach the NBA Finals. That award-winning season featured 11.6 points, 5 assists and 4.1 rebounds in 31.5 minutes per game.\n\n33. George King\n\nKing hit one of the biggest free throws in franchise history. As the story goes, time was running out on the 1955 championship's Game 7 and Fort Wayne decided to foul Syracuse's King, a mediocre free throw shooter. He made the go-ahead shot and then stole the ball away down the other end to seal the first of three franchise championships. King, a 6-foot point guard, averaged 10.4 points and 4.7 assists in 348 games with the Nationals.\n\n32. Eric Snow\n\nKnown for his assists and steals, Snow was a prototypical glue guy for the Sixers for seven seasons. He started in 403 of his 452 games with the club from 1997 to 2004. Playing with Iverson in the backcourt, Snow averaged 9.7 points, 6.6 assists, 3.2 rebounds and 1.6 steals per game during his time with the Sixers.\n\n31. World B. Free\n\nBorn as Lloyd Free, World changed his name a day before his 28th birthday and a few years after the first of his two stints with the Sixers. Free, a point guard, was selected by the 76ers 23rd overall in the 1976 draft. He played his first three seasons with the Sixers, averaging 13.6 points. He was a key bench player on the 1976 team that lost in the NBA Finals. Free returned to the Sixers at age 33 in 1986, but was waived after just 20 games.\n\n30. Clarence Weatherspoon\n\nThe Sixers traded Charles Barkley in the days leading up to the 1992 NBA Draft and they decided to replace him with Weatherspoon, selecting him ninth overall after a stellar career at Southern Miss. Weatherspoon played the bulk of his 13-year career with the Sixers, playing in 448 games. He averaged 15.3 points and 8.3 rebounds per game during his time with Philadelphia, which did not make the playoffs during Weatherspoon's six seasons.\n\n29. Caldwell Jones\n\nAfter the Sixers selected Jones in the 1973 draft, the big man known as \"Pops\" played three ABA seasons before joining them in 1976. Over the next six years, Jones averaged 7.2 points, 9.2 rebounds and 1.9 blocks per game with the Sixers. He was named to the All-NBA Defensive Team in 1981 and '82.\n\n28. Archie Clark\n\nClark, a big-time scoring point guard, joined the Sixers in 1968 after playing his first two years with the Lakers. The best of his three-plus seasons with Philadelphia was 1970-71, when he averaged 21.3 points, 5.4 assists and 4.8 rebounds over 82 games while playing nearly 40 minutes per game. The Sixers reached the playoffs in each of Clark's three seasons.\n\n27. Red Rocha\n\nRocha joined the Syracuse Nationals in 1951 and was a big (literally and figuratively, at 6-foot-9) part of the 1955 championship team. He was twice named to the All-Star team and averaged 11.3 points and 7 rebounds over 279 career games with Syracuse.\n\n26. Luke Jackson\n\nThe Sixers selected Jackson with the fourth overall pick in the 1964 draft and he immediately became an NBA All-Star, averaging 14.8 points and 12.9 rebounds his rookie season. Jackson played the entirety of his eight-year career and 522 regular-season games with the Sixers. He also playe din 56 playoff games and helped win the 1967 title next to Chamberlain.\n\n25. Samuel Dalembert\n\nYou may have read through this whole list and not thought once of Samuel Dalembert, which is fair. You may think him being in the Top 25 is crazy, which is fair. But it's not crazy. Dalembert, who the Sixers took 26th overall in 2001, played in 582 games (15th all-time in franchise history) and, after missing all of the 2002-03 season with a knee injury, was super durable. His win share total mirrors Hersey Hawkins (more on him to come). He was a skilled rebounder and shot blocker, averaging 8.3 and 1.9, respectively, during eight seasons with the Sixers. He ranks eighth all-time in franchise history in field goal percentage (.527) and second all-time in defensive rebound percentage (25.4).\n\n24. Paul Seymour\n\nPart player, part coach, Seymour did both for the Syracuse Nationals from 1956 to 1960. During his 11-year playing career, from 1949 to 1960, Seymour averaged 9.6 points, 3.9 assists and 3.1 rebounds. He once scored 67 points in a playoff game. Seymour's 600 games played are 14th in Sixers history.\n\n23. Steve Mix\n\nMix's win share number is huge, at 58.3, a testament to his longevity as a 76er. Mix played in 688 games, eighth all-time in team history. Mix, nicknamed \"The Mayor,\" joined the Sixers in 1973 as a 26-year-old. He'd stay nine seasons, averaging 11.3 points, 5.6 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game. Mix was a 1975 NBA All-Star.\n\n22. Hersey Hawkins\n\nHawkins was selected sixth overall in 1988 by the Clippers after leading the NCAA in scoring at Bradley. The Clippers traded Hawkins to the Sixers, who he played the first five of his 13 seasons for. Hawkins, a 6-3 shooting guard, was All-Rookie his first season and an All-Star in 1991. He averaged 19 points per game with the Sixers.\n\n21. George McGinnis\n\nMcGinnis made the jump from the ABA to the 76ers in 1975 and played just three seasons with Philadelphia, where he was one of the best players on the championship-losing 1977 team. Twice an All-Star, McGinnis averaged 21.6 points, 11.5 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 2.1 steals over 234 regular-season games with the Sixers.\n\n20. Fred Carter\n\nCarter was known as \"Mad Dog\" during his playing days, which spanned eight seasons, six of which being in Philadelphia, his hometown. Carter once called himself the best player on the worst team in NBA history. The 1972-73 Sixers won just nine games, but Carter averaged 20 points, six rebounds and 4.3 assists that season. He was known for being versatile, capable of guarding multiple positions even at just 6-3.\n\n19. Darryl Dawkins\n\nDawkins has one of the largest nickname lines in Basketball Reference's database. Of course, the most known is Choclate Thunder. Dawkins was the fifth pick in 1975. The Sixers took the 6-11 center in a historical selection. Dawkins was the first player to go right from high school to the NBA. He wanted to help his family financially. In seven seasons with the Sixers, Dawkins averaged 11.2 points and 6.7 rebounds per game. He broke two backboards in 1979, which led to the NBA changing its rims.\n\n18. Doug Collins\n\nCollins, who would later coach the Sixers, spent the entirety of his eight-year NBA career in Philadelphia. The Sixers drafted him first overall in 1973. A four-time All-Star, Collins averaged nearly 18 points, 3 rebounds and 3 assists per game. He played in 32 playoff games with the club and was on the 1977 Finals team. His career was cut short by injuries.\n\n17. John \"Red\" Kerr\n\nKerr played the first 11 of his 12-year professional career with Syracuse and Philadelphia. His 834 games rank fifth all-time in franchise history. Kerr, a 6-9 center, averaged 14 points and 11 rebounds per game. Kerr held a record at one point for consecutive games played (844). He was a rookie on the 1955 championship team and averaged 14 and 11 during the playoff run. Kerr was a three-time All-Star,\n\n16. Andre Iguodala\n\nThese days, Iguodala is making headlines as a veteran during the NBA's Player Empowerment Era that wants to choose where he plays. But \"Iggy,\" who hates that nickname, is one of the more underrated players in 76ers history. Consider that Iguodala ranks top 10 in franchise history in the following categories: win shares (9th); VOPR (4th); defensive rebounds (5th); steals (4th); assists (6th); and others. He was a defensive stopper who was always looked at wrong because he didn't have gaudy offensive numbers, though they were still very good, on some not-so-good Sixers teams.\n\n15. Larry Costello\n\nCostello played the first two of his 12-year career with the Philadelphia Warriors before joining the Syracuse Nationals in 1957. A six-time All-Star and 1967 NBA champion, Costello averaged 12.9 points and 4.7 rebounds per game during his 10 years with the franchise. Costello later led the Milwaukee Bucks (with Lew Alcindor) to the 1971 NBA championship as a coach. He is eighth all-time in Sixers history with 2,901 assists and 11th in games played (615).\n\n14. Andrew Toney\n\nThe Sixers selected Toney in the first round, eighth overall, in the 1980 NBA Draft. He played in just eight seasons before injuries cut his career short. Toney, a 6-3 shooting guard, was a two-time All-Star who averaged 15.9 points and 4.2 assists over 468 regular-season games. In the 1983 playoffs, which resulted in a championship, Toney averaged 18.8 points, scoring at least 19 in all four games of the sweep vs. Los Angeles.\n\n13. Chet Walker\n\nChet The Jet is a great nickname, but his consistency is what gets him this high on the list. Walker, who played one year with the Nationals before the move to Philadelphia, spent seven years with the organization and helped them reach the playoffs in every season. His best year as a 76er, Walker averaged 19.3 points per game during the 1966-67 championship year.\n\n12. Ben Simmons\n\nToo soon? Too low? Too high? It's tough to say, but the answer to the first question is a resounding no from this view. Simmons is one of the most gifted players to ever put a 76ers uniform on, even if he refuses to take jump shots. He's a walking triple-double. Simmons ranks in the top 10 all-time in more than a dozen categories for the Sixers, including field goal percentage (3rd); assists per game (1st); steals per game (7th); PER (9th); and box plus-minus (3rd). This is just his third season with the Sixers, and Simmons has the potential to climb toward the very top (bottom?) of this list.\n\n11. Bobby Jones\n\nJones played his first four professional seasons in Denver before joining the Sixers in 1978. He'd spend his final eight years with the organization, and ranks 10th all-time with 617 games played. Jones, a 6-9 small forward, spent a portion of his time in Philadelphia as a bench player and earned the inaugural Sixth Man of the Year award in 1983. His worth was on the defensive end, which earned him six consecutive first-team All-NBA Defensive Team honors. Jones stuffed the stat sheet, averaging 10.7 points 4.8 rebounds, 2.2 assits, 1.2 steals and 1.1 blocks during his 76ers career.\n\n10. Maurice Cheeks\n\nAmong the best point guards in NBA history, Cheeks ranks 13th all-time in league history in assists and first in Sixers history. He also ranks fifth all-time in steals in NBA history and first in Sixers history. The former Sixers coach and current NBA assistant helped guide the Sixers to the 1983 title. He was a four-time All-Star and four-time selection to the All-Defensive first-team. His No. 10 is retired by the 76ers, for whom he played 853 games (3rd in franchise history).\n\n9. Billy Cunningham\n\nOn a ranking of 76ers coaches, he'd be near the top, too. Cunningham won a championship as a player in 1967 and coached the Sixers to a title in 1983. In nine seasons and 654 games with the Sixers as a player over two stints, Cunningham, a 6-6 forward, averaged 20.8 points, 10.1 rebounds and 4 assists per game\n\n8. Joel Embiid\n\nLike Simmons, it's certainly not too early to have Embiid this high. Embiid is third all-time in franchise history in player-efficiency rating, behind only Wilt Chamberlain and Charles Barkley. The player who defines The Process so much that he made it his own nickname, Embiid is already one of the most talented players to play for the Sixers. He's already a three-time All-Star, two-time All-NBA Second Team and two-time second team All-NBA Defensive Team selection in just three-plus seasons with the Sixers.\n\n7. Moses Malone\n\nIf Malone played in more than four seasons with the Sixers, his body of work would likely have him atop the whole list. The Finals MVP of 1983 averaged 21 points and 12 rebounds per game in five seasons with Philadelphia. Malone was a 12-time NBA All-Star and four-time All-NBA first team selection. He was MVP three times, including two in a row with the Sixers in 1982 and '83.\n\n6. Charles Barkley\n\nThe Sixers drafted Sir Charles two picks after Michael Jordan, fifth overall in the 1984 NBA Draft. One of the best rebounders in NBA history, Barkley spent his first eight seasons with the 76ers, averaging 22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game over 610 games. Barkley was named to 11 consecutive All-Star games, the first six coming while on the Sixers. His No. 34 is retired by both the Sixers and Suns.\n\n5. Dolph Schayes\n\nSchayes played the first 14 of his 15-year professional career in Syracuse before moving to Philadelphia for his final season in 1963. A 12-time All-Star and 1955 NBA champion, Schayes ranks first all-time in Sixers history in rebounds (11,256), free throws (6,712) and win shares, where his 142.4 are far ahead of Julius Erving's 106.2. Hayes, whose No. 4 is retired by the Sixers, was inducted to the Hall of Fame in 1973.\n\n4. Hal Greer\n\nGreer has a record that's unlikely to be broken. His 1,122 games played in a 76ers uniform are far more than Schayes' 966. Greer, a point guard for the Nationals and Sixers, also played in 92 postseason games. Greer wasn't just Chamberlain's sidekick, either. He could score, as evidenced by his 20.4 career points per game average. A champion in 1967, Greer was a 10-time All-Star and was inducted to the Hall of Fame in 1982. His No. 15 is retired by the Sixers.\n\n3. Wilt Chamberlain\n\nUnfortunately, games played with the Philadelphia Warriors don't count. Chamberlain, a Philly native and Overbrook High grad, played just four seasons with the 76ers, from 1964 to 1968. His numbers, though, were simply bonkers. In a Sixers uniform, Chamberlain averaged 27.6 points, 23.9 rebounds and 6.8 assists per game. Chamberlain won the MVP award three straight years as a 76er. He was an 11-time rebounding leader, seven-time scoring leader and got bored in 1968 after winning a title here that he decided to lead the league in assists, too.\n\n2. Allen Iverson\n\nA championship is all that held Iverson back from being the best player in franchise history. There's no one you'd want on your team more in the fourth quarter of a big game. Iverson, first overall pick in 1996, ranks sixth in games played, second in minutes, third in made baskets, first in 3-pointers, second in free throw attempts, second in steals (and first in turnovers) and second in total points. The 2001 NBA MVP played in 11 seasons with the Sixers on the front end of his career and then finished his career with the club during a 25-game stint in 2009-10. In 12 total seasons in Philly, Iverson averaged 27.6 points and 6.1 assists per game.\n\n1. Julius Erving\n\nDr. J did what Iverson couldn't: He won an NBA championship in 1983. That, combined with his sustained excellence over 11 seasons with the organization is more than enough to give him the top spot. Erving made the All-Star team in all 11 seasons with the 76ers. He won the MVP award in 1981 and was first team All-NBA five times. Erving's No. 6 is retired by the Sixers. He averaged 22 points, 6.7 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 1.8 steals and 1.5 blocks per game during his time in Philadelphia, where he ranks fourth all-time in games played.\n\nContact Jeff Neiburg at jneiburg@delawareonline.com.
