        "text": "76ers Notes\n\nLou Williams wasn't alone in having a subpar game Sunday. He shot just 1 for 12, although the one basket was a three-pointer at the end of regulation that sent the game into overtime.\n\nWilliams was at a loss for an answer as to why the team didn't play well, although he did mention attending a concert on Saturday night.\n\n\"It was a combination of things, and it doesn't seem we came out ready to play,\" he said. \"We took a chance last night by going to the Lil Wayne concert.\"\n\nWilliams did not say which teammates attended Saturday's concert at the Wells Fargo Center. \"There were guys who went to the concert who played well, and guys who went who didn't play well,\" he said.\n\n\"For me it was a bad day at the office. Now we have to get ready for the next game.\"\n\nBad hands for Brand\n\nElton Brand suffered a dislocated right little finger on Feb. 27 at Cleveland. The 76ers forward later hurt his left hand as well, but he has not missed any games because of the injuries.\n\nCoach Doug Collins acknowledged after Sunday's 114-111 overtime loss to the Sacramento Kings that the injuries could be bothering Brand, who had 15 points and three rebounds in more than 39 minutes.\n\n\"It looked like he was fumbling the ball a little bit today,\" Collins said. \"His hands are bashed up.\"\n\nBrand is usually not very expansive when discussing the injuries, and he maintained that stance after the loss.\n\n\"It is definitely a problem,\" Brand said. \"It is nothing that will stop me from playing.\"\n\nTyreke and company\n\nBesides former Sixer Samuel Dalembert, who had 13 points and 19 rebounds, two other Kings with local ties made big contributions on Sunday.\n\nChester native Tyreke Evans played in only his second game back after treatment for plantar fasciitis that forced him to miss 20 games. Still shaking off the rust, he scored 10 points in more than 23 minutes. Third-year forward-center Jason Thompson, who won a state title in 2004 at Lenape High in Burlington County before starring at Rider, had a huge game off the bench.\n\nThompson had a double-double - 15 points and 11 rebounds in nearly 26 minutes.\n\n\"It's my first win in Philly, and it feels good,\" he said. \"I had pretty good games here before, but we didn't win.\"\n\nSacramento snapped a six-game losing streak to the Sixers.\n\nShort shots"
