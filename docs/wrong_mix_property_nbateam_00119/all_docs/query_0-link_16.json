        "text": "The Philadelphia 76ers made 19-year-old Ben Simmons the No. 1 overall pick in the NBA Draft Thursday night. The rookie is expected to sign a four-year deal with a maximum value of $26.6 million in the coming weeks. There shouldn't be much negotiation between the Sixers and Simmons' agent Rich Paul, who also reps LeBron James. The NBA implemented a rookie salary scale in 1995 under the collective bargaining agreement between the owners and the players union. As the No. 1 pick, Simmons would be entitled to a first-year salary of $4.9 million for the 2016-17 season with the 76ers able to surpass the capped salary by as much as 20%.\n\nIt is a long way from the 1980s and '90s when holdouts were common as draftees pushed for bigger deals. The final straw for owners regarding rookie salaries was likely the 1994 agreement between Glenn Robinson and the Milwaukee Bucks. The No. 1 overall pick inked a 10-year, $68 million pact that remains the richest rookie contract in NBA history. The owners locked the players out the following the year and rookie deals have been capped ever since.\n\nToday's NBA players cash in during their second and third contracts, which can reach nine figures for the game's elite players and will soar over the next few years with the league's new $24 billion TV contract kicking off next season.\n\nForbes scoured through the databases of Spotrac and Basketball-Reference to determine the top-earning NBA player all-time from each draft slot (see full results below). Kevin Garnett ($326 million) and Kobe Bryant ($323 million) are the NBA's top-paid players ever and were taken with the No. 5 and No. 13 picks, respectively. The No. 5 pick has been a bonanza for players with long careers who racked up fortunes with Garnett joined by Ray Allen ($182 million), Vince Carter ($155 million), Dwyane Wade ($153 million) and Juwan Howard ($149 million).\n\nTop overall picks Shaquille O'Neal (1992), Tim Duncan (1997) and James (2003) rank among the NBA's most dominant players over the past quarter-century and the trio has banked a cumulative $716 million in playing salary during their careers. Will Simmons follow this Hall of Fame financial path or that of 2013 top pick, Anthony Bennett, who might be finished in the league after four seasons and $15.5 million in earnings?\n\nThere is no rookie salary scale for second round picks, but they rarely command much more than the minimum NBA salary. A handful of second round picks have landed mega-paydays after their rookie deals expired. Gilbert Arenas ($163 million in career earnings), Rashard Lewis ($151 million), Baron Davis ($147 million) and Carlos Boozer ($143 million) all fell from the first round on draft day and earned more than $140 million during their NBA tenures.\n\nNBA rosters are tight with a maximum of 15 slots available, so it is rare that an undrafted player makes the team, but there are cases of undrafted players becoming stars with massive earnings. Brad Miller signed with the Charlotte Hornets as an undrafted free agent out of Purdue University in 1998. Miller made two All-Star teams during his 15-year career and earned $91 million.\n\nBen Wallace went undrafted after starring with Division II school Virginia Union. He signed with the then-named Washington Bullets and became a defensive force. He won the NBA's Defensive Players of the Year award four times during a 16-year career with total earnings of $91 million.\n\nBelow is the player with the highest career earnings from each draft slot, along with the team that drafted them and the year.\n\nDraft Slot, Player, Team, Year Drafted, Career Earnings\n\nShaquille O’Neal, Orland Magic (1992): $286.3 million\n\nJason Kidd, Dallas Mavericks (1994): $182 million\n\nCarmelo Anthony, Denver Nuggets (2003): $176.6 million\n\nChris Bosh, Toronto Raptors (2003): $163.2 million\n\nKevin Garnett, Minnesota Timberwolves (1995): $326.4 million\n\nAntoine Walker, Boston Celtics (2001): $106.7 million\n\nNene, Denver Nuggets (2002): $120.2 million\n\nVin Baker, Milwaukee Bucks (1993): $97.4 million\n\nDirk Nowitzki, Dallas Mavericks (1997): $216.6 million\n\nJoe Johnson, Boston Celtics (2001): $192.5 million\n\nAllan Houston, Detroit Pistons (1993): $138.3 million\n\nThaddeus Young, Philadelphia 76ers (2007): $51.9 million\n\nKobe Bryant, Charlotte Hornets (1996): $323.3 million\n\nPeja Stojakovic, Sacramento Kings (1996): $98 million\n\nSteve Nash, Phoenix Suns (1996): $144.7 million\n\nHedo Turkoglu, Sacramento Kings (2000): $83.2 million\n\nJermaine O’Neal, Portland Trail Blazers (1996): $167.6 million\n\nTheo Ratliff, Detroit Pistons (1995): $102.4 million\n\nZach Randolph, Portland Trail Blazers (2001): $162.2 million\n\nZydrunas Ilgauskas, Cleveland Cavaliers (1996): $125.3 million\n\nMichael Finley, Phoenix Suns (1995): $136.5 million\n\nKenny Thomas, Houston Rockets (1999): $54.6 million\n\nTayshaun Prince, Detroit Pistons (2002: $80.4 million\n\nAndrei Kirilenko, Utah Jazz (2001): $106.1 million\n\nGerald Wallace, Sacramento Kings (2001): $102.8 million\n\nSamuel Dalembert, Philadelphia 76ers (2001): $88.7 million\n\nKendrick Perkins, Boston Celtics (2003): $57.7 million\n\nTony Parker, San Antonio Spurs (2001): $130.9 million\n\nP.J.
