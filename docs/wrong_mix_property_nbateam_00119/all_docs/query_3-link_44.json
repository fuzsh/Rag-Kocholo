Vote below and help decide the greatest Philadelphia 76ers big man of all time.\n\nMost divisive: Shawn Bradley\n\nOver 500 Ranker voters have come together to rank this list of The Best 76ers Centers Ever\n\nBirthplace : Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nNationality : American\n\nTeam : Los Angeles Lakers, Golden State Warriors, Philadelphia 76ers, Harlem Globetrotters, San Francisco Warriors\n\nPosition : Center\n\n76ers Seasons: 1964–1968\n\nA true legend in the sport, Wilt Chamberlain joined the Philadelphia 76ers in 1965 via a blockbuster trade and quickly made an impact on the team through his offensive dominance and rebounding prowess. Towering at 7 feet 1 inch, Chamberlain's ability to score from virtually any spot on the court and grab rebounds seemingly at will made him an unstoppable force for Philadelphia. During his tenure with the team, he won three MVP awards (1966, 1967, and 1968) and an NBA championship in 1967. Wilt's record-setting 100-point game, though achieved while on a different team, stands as a testament to his greatness and solidifies his position as one of the greatest Philadelphia 76ers centers of all time.\n\nBirthplace : Yaoundé, Cameroon\n\nNationality : Cameroon\n\nTeam : Philadelphia 76ers\n\nPosition : Center\n\n76ers Seasons: 2016–2022\n\nDrafted third overall in the 2014 NBA Draft, Joel Embiid has rapidly developed into one of the most dominant centers in the league, earning the nickname \"The Process.\" Blessed with incredible size, agility, and a diverse offensive skill set, Embiid is a force to be reckoned with on both ends of the floor. A three-time NBA All-Star and two-time All-NBA Second Team selection, his impact has played a pivotal role in the resurgence of the Philadelphia 76ers as a top-tier team. While still early in his career, Embiid's potential and impressive play have fans excited for what lies ahead.\n\nBirthplace : Petersburg, Virginia\n\nNationality : American\n\nTeam : Houston Rockets, Philadelphia 76ers, Atlanta Hawks, Washington Bullets, Milwaukee Bucks\n\nPosition : Center\n\n76ers Seasons: 1982–1986, 1993–1994\n\nMoses Malone, a tenacious rebounder and dominant inside scorer, was acquired by the 76ers in 1982 through a high-profile signing. The addition of Malone to the team created a powerful duo with Julius Erving, propelling the franchise to new heights. During his first season with the 76ers, Moses earned both the regular season and Finals MVP awards while leading the team to an NBA Championship in 1983. Nicknamed \"Chairman of the Boards,\" Malone's relentless pursuit of rebounds and gritty play style cemented his place among the elite 76ers centers.\n\nBirthplace : Orlando, Florida\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Center\n\n76ers Seasons: 1975–1982\n\nDarryl Dawkins, aka \"Chocolate Thunder,\" was drafted by the 76ers as the fifth overall pick in the 1975 NBA Draft, becoming the first player ever drafted directly from high school. His trademark power-dunks and larger-than-life personality captivated fans, while his bruising play style wreaked havoc on opponents. Though never a major award winner, his contributions to the 76ers as a tenacious rebounder and shot blocker were crucial during his seven seasons with the team. Dawkins' undeniable charisma and physicality earned him a spot among the most beloved and memorable Philadelphia 76ers centers.\n\nBirthplace : Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo\n\nNationality : Democratic Republic of the Congo, United States of America\n\nTeam : Denver Nuggets, Atlanta Hawks, Philadelphia 76ers, New Jersey Nets, New York Knicks\n\nPosition : Center\n\n76ers Seasons: 2000–2002\n\nAcquired by the 76ers in a 2001 trade, Dikembe Mutombo's arrival signaled the team's commitment to bolstering their defensive presence. A four-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year, Mutombo's shot-blocking prowess and intimidating presence in the paint were instrumental in the team's run to the NBA Finals that same year. Though his tenure with the 76ers was relatively short, his impact on the defensive end was undeniable. Dikembe's leadership and trademark finger wag made him a fan favorite during his time as a Philadelphia center.\n\nBirthplace : Demopolis, Alabama\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Power forward, Center\n\n76ers Seasons: 1997–2001, 2008–2009\n\nDrafted 18th overall in the 1995 NBA Draft, Theo Ratliff quickly established himself as a dominant shot-blocker and efficient inside scorer with the Philadelphia 76ers. His athleticism and instincts enabled him to protect the rim with ferocity, garnering NBA All-Defensive Second Team honors during the 1998-99 season. Though his tenure with the team was cut short by a trade in 2001, Ratliff's impact on the defensive end left an indelible mark on the franchise. As one of the premier shot-blockers in 76ers history, Theo Ratliff more than earned his place among the great centers."
