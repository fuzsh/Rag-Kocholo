Samuel Davis Dalembert (born May 10, 1981) is a professional basketball player who plays center with the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers. "Sammy" as he is commonly referred to as, was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. He started playing hoops in Montreal and played his college ball at Seton Hall University.

Samuel Dalembert is currently the starting center for the Philadelphia 76ers. He is a consistent double-double achiever and averages 3 blocks per game - ranking him one of the leagues elite shot blockers.

He missed the entire 2003-2004 season due to injuries.

It is also worth noting that Dalembert is a clutch free throw shooter — despite his low season free throw percentage — as demonstrated in the January 13th game against the Boston Celtics when he hit all eight attempts in the Sixers' 125-124 win.

Samuel is now a Canadian citizen and Montrealer, and intends to play for Canada in 2008 for the Olympics.
