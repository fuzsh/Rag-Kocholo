        "text": "they are called corvettes in case turkey sell it to other countries(middle eastern or Azerbaijan or other central Asian countries, not to get complains from other players like USA, Russia ..\n\nİts highly related to history of project on the sizes of vessel ,once i could drop in library of university i will share picture of that design . Also in a free time,i will share the mentioned research on world's trend in military ships, that is done before milgem started.\n\nThere are further projects to be called frigate, and still will be sold to other countries .\n\nhere is the speech given by Yücel Odabaşı who is considered to be father of milgem, also the mentioned research done by him .\n\nİlk hedef: Korvetler\n\nHowever, some allegedly lost share of the cake in Israel, as a result of German and European companies lobbying persuaded the Navy MİLGEM project has been suspended.\n\nhis extensive research on the subject for months without completing Naval Forces had received shortly before a sudden decision to remove from the agenda again took over the project.\n\nThus, the coordination of all private sector university consortium between the Navy and the signing of the outer found in the middle of the road was happening.\n\nTaşkızak and puddles built in large ?? small landing craft and 80 class coast guard boats in the growing design and workmanship success, especially last generated coast guard boats 100% Turkish design to be $ 1.5 million, labor savings and nearly half of domestic material ratio Turkish engineers were excited and şevklendir. That form had the courage to start MİLGEM project.\n\nProfessor Yucel Odabaş'ı: 12 corvettes will produce\n\nHanding on the subject at the beginning of the project the most authoritative party, Prof. Dr. Yucel talked with Odabaş. Professor Odabaşı says: 'Environmental conditions, technology, the environment needs and cyclical changes in parallel with the Turkish navy in preparation for some input as to balance it. MİLGEM project was born. Enabling a remote point may seem like there is an issue. Duration of the project is the main reason behind the disruption. Is Turkey can do it, whether or not we thought for a long time? Elapsed time it has passed the evaluation. Supply industry has been the evaluation phase. To encourage a number of areas had to be uncovered. Then it was entered on financing some preparations. These are very serious matters and require large amounts. This is the case anywhere in the world. Finance costs should not be confused with the ship costs. System integration that takes certain amount of money for it. MİLGEM project and billions of dollars will be prevented from escaping to the outside. Therefore, this project is one of the biggest projects in Turkey. \"\n\nYucel Odabaş'ı currently Turkey's ship purchases on the choice of whether, in which the ship if they get him had said: \"But MİLGEM project design we will make the situation will come. Therefore preferred the right will increase. MİLGEM project currently 4 + 4 + 4 in the form of a total of 12 corvettes produce have started. single ship cost $ 160 million. Financing extent of the problem can evaluate. every ship until 2006 navy gain is planned. corvettes alone who can move, fight and manoeuvrable vessels are. these are the ideal ship for Turkey in the Aegean. Larger states outside the corvette almost all states have moved toward. Turkey on this issue is not too late. takes into consideration everything we have, \"he says.\n\n\"Gölcük and Taşkızak shipyards activities started very successful results gave. Especially the German boat design and design technology, benefiting from guided missile frigate, frigates and submarines in the construction to advanced levels reached. Taşkızak our shipyards activities started very successful results gave. Taşkızak shipyards lurs the Verft in cooperation with the Harpoon missile capacity gunboats from Doğan class 4 ships, wind class 4 ships, Star class 2 ship is made of ongoing projects under the Star class ships' construction is underway. submarine production under the German Hovaldswerk shipyard with a thousand ton class submarine production began, six submarines were produced. second stage thousand 400 ton class Preveza and Sakarya submarine produced and very special technologies, this ship two of the construction still continues. German Meko Concept of the Turkish reviews can call Yavuz class of ships started with the construction frigates in the program Blohm und Voss and Hovaldtswerk shipyard in cooperation with four ships and Barbaros class 2 vessels are manufactured. This program will be equipped with the vertical launch system the last two ship TCG TCG Salih Reis Kemal Reis F with F 246 ,F 247, the construction is ongoing.\n\nReached the boat should point design and design capabilities, as well as of the size of the Turkish Navy is one of the biggest navy in the Mediterranean. Our country is a peninsula at the same time, however, the Black Sea and the Mediterranean and the Aegean have to float the ship. Greece against Turkey tensions policy must be conducted in a controlled effort on the arms of Greece is the power, the Greek air force and navy have been working almost constantly on the alert level. Greece in the Aegean using the advantages of the lobby on the United States naval forces in terms of the balance is willing to turn in their favor. In previous years, the ship took over Greece needs. Monitor these developments closely to promote Turkey, where the technological level, to eliminate foreign dependence in order to prepare for the future and the navy has produced two important projects. These projects are TF 2000 and MİLGEM project. Turkey has achieved technological know-how at the same time assessing their own needs in the design, engineering, systems integration technologies like the 21st century, this project hopes to practice with. MİLGEM project having historical significance in this respect is a project for Turkey. \"\n\nWhat is the situation in the world fleet?\n\nProfessor Dr. Based on the information we received from Yucel Odabaşı what kind of corvette vessels that were investigated. Currently, a total of 600 working in the world's oceans close to 200 frigate under the age of 10. In addition, 100 more are being built frigates. Among them, 5 thousand 400 tons of boats, so many varieties to 200 thousand ton vessel type and tonnage of the ship's.\n\nTwo thousand - four thousand tons, on the high seas can function, four thousand nautical miles more than the cruise capable, 40 -60-day self-contained ,submarine, air defense and surface warfare used in the strong arms equipped with a large surface vessels to the \"frigate\" it said .\n\nIn recent years, the world fleet in order to eliminate the weakness of the gunboats on the very rinse and frigates will replace the alleged another platform Prof.Odabaşı well as the exalted; corvettes.\n\nThe world fleet in the \"corvette\" vessel working under the name 275 and 70 units under construction ... Corvettes of the first frigate in the background is smaller than the tonnage stands out. Therefore, some differences in weapons and equipment available. However, to be effective in each of the three main naval battles as well as the ability to move the helicopter.\n\nNew trend: Corvettes are\n\nWe met some sailors \"could sink a frigate with missile salvos when you can get a large number of gunboats, frigates buy big and expensive one is meaningless,\" they say.\n\n\"About ten years ago, some countries, small and fast gunboats are great warships predilection began. Israel's Eilat named destroyers in 1967, two Egyptian gunboats beats with missiles after the sinking of the world's smaller countries' naval forces many of the various types of assault boats have purchased . \"\n\nSmall and fast gunboats, which are very popular and the demand for this type of warship increased during the years in an extraordinary way, the makers of warships, frigates began to think of the market disappear.\n\nGunboats on the orientation of the corvette\n\nIsraeli gunboats philosophy attaches great importance to the war on closer examination, it seems that turning to classic corvettes of gunboats. For example, a frigate design with excellent Saar, left in place in case the Saar 5 corvettes and this new ship type. The same trend is seen in some other naval forces. But not without different ideas about it.\n\nFor example, in the Navy for many years, who served a retired colonel in this regard says: \"A great ship money to be spent on instead of six small warships, the idea apparently is attractive. However, modern missiles and weapon systems equipped with small vessels, is quite complex and in a variety of systems and sub-systems for the Navy a huge financial burden brings. small and fast gunboats limited size as a result of these ships more staff can not be. Hence these vessels for teaching purposes can not be used. frequent opening to the sea, this small ship large ship than they wear out quickly and the old. \"\n\nThe Soviet Union in the 1960s, its allies and Third World countries located between the friendly countries, a large number of \"Komar\" type missile gunboats, with subsequent and more complex \"Os\" type gunboats from the gave. \"Osa 1\" and \"Os 2\" types, some countries in the Navy, the former \"Shershun the\" type was used in conjunction with torpedo boats. These small vessels, the place slowly \"Pauker\" and \"Tarantule\" type corvettes and \"Matka\" class hovercraft to the left.\n\nA wide range of vessels from the Soviet navy gunboats averse, there were weapons systems. Upgrading of the size of gunboats, is seen as an inevitable trend, but at this time, and the advantages of a small assault boat had disappeared. In addition, the exact location of the missiles did not take the ball because the ball and heavy machine guns \"soft\" targets of attack and defense against air attack missions were important weapons system. Small gunboats, protection against air attack force consisted targets. Missiles, rockets and bombs against the air strikes, gunboats were unable to approach their target, they must be equipped with some air defense weapons had become. So it had to be enlarged to the size of gunboats.\n\nThis view also of the way the world navy \"corvette\" type began to turn to. For example, Israel is equipped with CIWS and lightweight helicopter carrying three LAHAV class (SAAR 5) had bought a corvette. France and Germany, a new ship from a thousand to two thousand tons of family entered into a collaboration to develop and BREE called Car 20 Corvette was offered to the world's oceans.\n\nIndia made 400 thousand ton corvette, but Pauker and Tarantule class 56 m from Russia. missile corvettes bought in the neck. Italian firm Fincantieri 660 tons 62 m. Wader class corvette made in the neck; six in Iraq, six had sold to the Ecuadorian Navy.\n\nSwedish Navy, the first class of 50 m ago in Stockholm. two in length, then the 57 m long Gothenburg class corvettes built 4.\n\nPeterson Builders company, Saudi Arabia Al Siddiq Navy 9 58 m of class A, 4 x 75 m long by Badr class corvettes were sold in that country.\n\nWhat should Turkey do?\n\nUntil recently, quite old, used US consisting of the Turkish navy ship recently made some purchases began to change with the shell. However, many of the economic life of existing platforms has been completed, performances and strike force is very low and difficult to maintain.\n\nGiven the nature of this force air defense of Turkey in particular has some shortcomings. However, the United States, although sometimes we want to pay money to remove the difficulty in making ships, Turkey's defense industry has necessitated the review of the policy. Here in this context, the Turkish Navy laid the foundations of the MİLGEM project. On the other hand the current threat by many naval officers, tasks, considering the theater is not in the Turkish navy frigates and corvettes type ships in Turkey to meet the needs of the most suitable vessels that are being expressed.\n\nWho coordinated the project, According to Yucel Odabaşı today's frigates equipped with highly sophisticated systems, large-diameter ball, with low-frequency sonar boats and helicopters. However, not too expensive, too costly supply and maintenance. Corvettes and almost joined a frigate to effectively perform all kinds of operations, the tonnages ranging from about 700 -- 1,400 tons platforms. relatively affordable cost compared to frigates are built with. So the money will be divided into two frigates and 5 corvettes can be made. 1 corvette cost of $ 160 million. To produce approximately 12 Corvettes will cost $ 2 billion to Turkey. Experts in this case Turkey will be in the billions of dollars of profit are specified. The economic and political turmoil in our country, this type of projects could adversely affect. However, with strategic insight and prescient Navy Commander Admiral Salim Dervişoğlu closely involved with the project is known.\n\nNavy pupil of the Turkish Armed Forces for a moment before realizing this project will proud up our people."
