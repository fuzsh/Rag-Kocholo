        "text": "Egypt court sentences Muslim Brotherhood chief to death\n\n|\n\nAn Egyptian court on Monday sentenced 683 alleged Islamists to death, including Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie. In another session, the same court also reversed 492 of 529 death sentences issued in a March 24 ruling.\n\nThe trials have sparked international outrage amid a continuing crackdown against Islamists by Egypt’s military authorities.\n\nThe rulings by Judge Saeed Yousef Sabry at a court in the southern province of Minya has been closely followed by international rights groups as well as Egyptians across the country – particularly among the families of the accused. According to reporters in Minya, several female relatives waiting outside the courtroom on Monday fainted on hearing news of the verdict.\n\nOn March 24, Justice Sabry sentenced 529 people to death after only one session – a one-hour hearing in which defence lawyers were prevented from presenting arguments, and the prosecution offered no evidence, according to human rights groups.\n\nUnder Egyptian law, the court pronounces a death sentence and refers the case to the country’s top Islamic scholar, who plays an advisory role. It then ratifies the sentence in a subsequent hearing.\n\nReporting from Cairo, FRANCE 24’s Kathryn Stapley explained that Egypt’s grand mufti’s decision is sent to the court, which publicly discloses the ruling. Monday’s reversal of 492 death sentences marked the first time Egypt’s top Islamic scholar had gone against a judge’s initial ruling.\n\nBut in another ruling, the court recommended the death sentence for Muslim Brotherhood leader Badie, as well as 682 alleged supporters of the group, on charges of the murder and attempted murder of several policemen during rioting by supporters of ousted president Mohammed Morsi in Minya in August 2013.\n\nThe verdict was the first major ruling against any Brotherhood leader. These death sentences must also be approved by Egypt’s grand mufti.\n\nThe US and UK governments have expressed outrage over the trials. In a statement issued a day after the March 24 verdict, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said it was “shocking even amid Egypt’s deep political repression that a court has sentenced 529 people to death without giving them any meaningful opportunity to defend themselves”.\n\n‘I have no faith in the judiciary’\n\nDays before the trial, FRANCE 24 met with Ahmed Shabib, a defence lawyer representing 30 of the 529 people sentenced to death.\n\nShabib was in the Egyptian capital of Cairo to meet some of the families of the defendants.\n\nA visibly tense Mustafa Mohammed, cousin of two of the defendants, listened as Shabib explained the details of the case.\n\n“Neither of them had anything to do with the demonstration or with anything else,” said Mohammed, referring to the August 2013 violence in Minya. “One of them was part of a charitable organization so they think he's Muslim Brotherhood. I'm hopeful the sentence will change. But I have no faith in the judiciary – that's it,” he added, shaking his head.\n\nOn August 14, 2013, the Matai police station in Minya was attacked amid mounting rage over the dispersal of pro-Morsi demonstrations in Cairo. One policeman was killed in the clashes.\n\nShabib, the lawyer, criticized the judge for violating legal procedures and pronouncing sentence after just two hearings.\n\n“To reach a verdict after reading the entire case in 48 hours – this is the crux of the mistake,” said Shabib. “He [Justice Sabry] didn't hear the defence case. He broke the law in not registering the defendants. There are many grounds to appeal.”\n\nThe March sentencing sent a chill through opponents of the military-installed regime, which has placed thousands of alleged Islamists on mass trials since Morsi's ouster.\n\nBut speaking to FRANCE 24, Ezzat Khamees, a senior Justice Ministry official, denied that the trials were politically motivated and aimed at crushing Egypt’s Islamist opposition.\n\n“There is nothing to do with politics in the judiciary and nothing to do with the judiciary in politics,” said Khamees. “Judges don't work in politics.”\n\nBut human rights groups have criticised Egyptian authorities for demonstrating “almost zero tolerance” for any form of dissent by arresting and prosecuting journalists, demonstrators and academics for peacefully expressing their views.\n\nAmong the more high profile cases is the trial of three Al Jazeera journalists – including veteran Australian reporter Peter Geste – on charges of disseminating “false information” and belonging to a “terrorist organization”.\n\nAt least 1,000 people have been sentenced since December, all in groups of 10 or more. Their prison terms range from six months to life, with two sentenced to death.\n\nAmnesty International says more than 1,400 people have been killed in the police crackdown since the army overthrew Morsi, Egypt's first elected and civilian leader.\n\nFRANCE 24:\n\nJudge’s faulty summary saves 7 cops from jail\n\n|\n\nTHE Court of Appeal has ordered the immediate release of seven police officers who were convicted and imprisoned for five years each for the manslaughter of a suspected robber, Festo Stephano.\n\nJustices January Msoffe, Nathalia Kimaro and Sauda Mjasiri reached the decision after allowing the appeal lodged by three of the seven police officers to challenge the verdict and sentence given on June 21, last year, by Judge Sam Rumanyika of the High Court at Tabora.\n\n“We find that the appeal has merit. We allow the appeal, quash the convictions and set aside the sentences. We order the release of the appellants from prison unless they are held there for lawful cause,” they ruled.\n\nAlong Inspector Baraka Hongoli, other appellants were Corporal Swahibu and Detective Constable Jerry.\n\nThe other four officers who had not lodged any appeal but benefited from the court’s decision are Police Constable Charles, Detective Constable Shamsi, Detective Constable Amran and Detective Corporal Mawazo.\n\nThe justices noted that the summary the trial judge gave in association of the police officials in the commission of the offence was not borne out by the evidence adduced and the law.\n\n“To a large extent his summary of the reasons why he convicted the appellants was speculative and self-contradictory because he also said in the judgment that the matter was not sufficiently investigated,” they said.\n\nThe justices added, “Trial courts have to be guided by the evidence before it in determining the issues which arise in the cases brought before them and not speculation.\n\nWe hope these remarks will assist the learned trial judge and others to properly conduct the trials before the trial courts.”\n\nDuring the trial, the seven police officers were charged with the murder of Stephano on August 6, 2011 in Rungwe Mpya village in Kasulu district, Kigoma region.\n\nAt the end of the trial, all the accused persons were found guilty and convicted of the lesser offence of manslaughter.\n\nIt was alleged that the deceased and his brother, Masumbuko Christian, who was among the prosecution witnesses, were arrested by militiamen in connection with a robbery committed at a tobacco plantation in the village.\n\nThey were locked up in the office of the Ward Executive Officer awaiting collection by the police. The appellants arrived from Kasulu Police Station to collect the deceased and Christian.\n\nThe court was told that the deceased was severely beaten up by the police using bamboo sticks, gun butts and also cut him with broken bottle fragments until he lost consciousness.\n\nProsecution witnesses further alleged that the duo were subsequently put into a vehicle which had ferried the appellants to the village and were driven away.\n\nThe deceased was later taken to hospital after his condition worsened, but he subsequently died shortly upon arrival at the hospital.\n\nThe death led to the arrest of the appellants and were charged with murder. The appellants denied beating either the deceased or his brother Christian.\n\nThey claimed that the deceased died while attempting to escape from police arrest when he jumped from the speeding vehicle while on the way to Kasulu police station.\n\nDaily News:\n\nWoman in Barclays ‘robbery’ seized\n\n|\n\nDar es Salaam.\n\nPolice have arrested more suspects in the Barclays Bank robbery investigation, including a 30-year-old woman who was flushed out of a bus with a reported Sh26 million stuffed in her bag.\n\nThe woman (name withheld), a resident of Tabata in Dar es Salaam, was in the police list of most wanted suspects in connection with the theft of millions of shillings at the bank’s Kinondoni Branch by conniving staff and some crooked police officers.\n\nAccording to impeccable sources close to the investigation, it is now emerging that up to Sh500 million, and not the Sh300 million reported first on April 15, may have been stolen in a hoax that was stage-managed to appear like a robbery.\n\nThe suspect was dramatically arrested on Thursday at Kabuku in Tanga Region inside an Arusha-bound Dar Express Bus. On her, the police sources confided to The Citizen, some Sh26 million in crisp banknotes in a small travelling bag was found.\n\nAlso seized, were the suspect’s younger sister and her husband from whom another stuffed bag with approximately Sh15 million was found. The couple was picked from their Kibaha town residence and are said to have led the police to arrest their travelling relative.\n\nAnother suspect whose identity has not been divulged was arrested at the Julius Nyerere International Airport as he waited to board a plane to an undisclosed destination.\n\nThe weekend round-up brings to nearly a dozen those being held at the Oyster Bay police. Efforts by The Citizen to reach out to the Kinondoni RPC, Mr Camillius Wambura, and the Dar es Salaam Special Police Zone Commander, Mr Suleiman Kova, for comment were futile as their phones went unanswered.\n\nBut The Citizen can today reveal the dramatic details of the arrest of the key woman suspect as recounted by Ms Dementria Naluyaga who witnessed the drama on Thursday.\n\nInterestingly, Ms Naluyaga was also arrested alongside the suspect at Kabuku and spent the night together with the other suspects under tight police guard at Oyster Bay.\n\nShe was, however, released on Friday evening after it was proven hers was a case of mistaken identity.\n\nIn an interview with The Citizen at a Kigamboni hotel on Saturday, Ms Naluyaga said she was travelling to Arusha to attend her sister’s pre-wedding ceremony when the events leading to her arrest begun to unfold.\n\n“I was in the same Dar Express bus with the suspect and in fact we were sharing a seat right behind the driver at the time of the arrest,” she recalled.\n\nShe said she sat alone in the bus up to Kongowe in Kibaha where the suspect was dropped off by a motorcycle and entered the bus.\n\n“She came and sat with me and we rode together as she played banter for the reminder of the journey. We somewhat bonded and she even borrowed my phone to make several calls.\n\n“A few minutes after 1pm we arrived at Kabuku and immediately noted that something was afoot.All the Dar Express buses from the city were being held and passengers detained inside.”\n\nMs Naluyaga said she overheard the crew say that the police had orders from Dar to stop all the buses from continuing with the journey.\n\nAccording to her, her woman companion was calm during the journey.\n\n“She, however, showed signs of panic and made a lot of calls when we were told about the police hunt for suspects. She made calls from a scribbled list numbers and spoke in her mother tongue.”\n\nSoon, the team from Dar arrived in a marked car at about 2pm. They did not take long to land their prized suspect. Apparently, the bodaboda cyclist had been arrested and led them to the bus that his sister in-law had boarded.\n\n“The police who were described as members of a task force came in and asked the lady to identify herself. She gave her name and they told her they were looking for her. She alighted with her bags and was taken in. But a few minutes later before we could proceed, another order came that I should also alight. I was now being accused of being an accomplice on account of my phone that was used to make calls to numbers that the police said belonged to the criminals they were looking for.”\n\nMs Naluyaga said they were held at the Kabuku station where they were interrogated and recorded statements.\n\n“At about 7.30pm we begun the journey back to the city, arriving past midnight and were led to a small room at Oyster Bay.\n\n“The police accused me of being a Kenyan and a dangerous criminal and terrorist who they have been looking for. They seized our phones and declined any request to contact my family. But I knew I was innocent and it would only be a matter of time and I would be free.”\n\nAs for the arrested woman, Ms Naluyaga said she was shocked to learn of the story behind her.\n\n“She had told me she was heading to Segera to fetch her child from her estranged husband.”\n\nThe Citizen:\n\nIndia court recognises transgender people as third gender\n\n|\n\nIndia's Supreme Court has recognised transgender people as a third gender, in a landmark ruling.\n\n\"It is the right of every human being to choose their gender,\" it said in granting rights to those who identify themselves as neither male nor female.\n\nIt ordered the government to provide transgender people with quotas in jobs and education in line with other minorities, as well as key amenities.\n\nAccording to one estimate, India has about two million transgender people.\n\nIn India, a common term used to describe transgender people, transsexuals, cross-dressers, eunuchs and transvestites is hijra.\n\nCampaigners say they live on the fringes of society, often in poverty, ostracised because of their gender identity. Most make a living by singing and dancing or by begging and prostitution.\n\nRights groups say they often face huge discrimination and that sometimes hospitals refuse to admit them.\n\nThey have been forced to choose either male or female as their gender in most public spheres.\n\n'Proud Indian'\n\n\"Recognition of transgenders as a third gender is not a social or medical issue but a human rights issue,\" Justice KS Radhakrishnan, who headed the two-judge Supreme Court bench, said in his ruling on Tuesday.\n\n\"Transgenders are also citizens of India\" and they must be \"provided equal opportunity to grow\", the court said.\n\n\"The spirit of the Constitution is to provide equal opportunity to every citizen to grow and attain their potential, irrespective of caste, religion or gender.\"\n\nThe judges asked the government to treat them in line with other minorities officially categorised as \"socially and economically backward\", to enable them to get quotas in jobs and education.\n\n\"We are quite thrilled by the judgement,\" Anita Shenoy, lawyer for the petitioner National Legal Services Authority (Nalsa), told the BBC.\n\n\"The court order gives legal sanctity to the third gender. The judges said the government must make sure that they have access to medical care and other facilities like separate wards in hospitals and separate toilets,\" she said.\n\nProminent transgender activist Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, who was among the petitioners in the case, welcomed the judgement, saying the community had long suffered from discrimination and ignorance in the traditionally conservative country, reports the Agence France-Presse news agency.\n\n\"Today, for the first time I feel very proud to be an Indian,\" Ms Tripathi told reporters outside the court in Delhi.\n\nIn 2009, India's Election Commission took a first step by allowing transgenders to choose their gender as \"other\" on ballot forms.\n\nBut India is not the first country to recognise a third gender. Nepal recognised a third gender as early as in 2007 when the Supreme Court ordered the government to scrap all laws that discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. And last year, Bangladesh also recognised a third gender.\n\nTuesday's ruling comes after the Supreme Court's decision in December which criminalised gay sex by reversing a landmark 2009 Delhi High Court order which had decriminalised homosexual acts.\n\nAccording to a 153-year-old colonial-era law - Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code - a same-sex relationship is an \"unnatural offence\" and punishable by a 10-year jail term.\n\nLegal experts say Tuesday's judgement puts transgender people in a strange situation: on the one hand, they are now legally recognised and protected under the Constitution, but on the other hand they may be breaking the law if they have consensual gay sex.\n\nBBC News:\n\nCourt orders Berlusconi to perform community service at center for elderly\n\n|\n\nAn Italian court ruled Tuesday that former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi must perform community service at a home for the elderly as his sentence for tax fraud. The order was requested by Berlusconi, a three-time prime minister, media magnate and billionaire, as a way to serve the remaining year of a four-year sentence, the first three years having been covered by amnesties. Berlusconi, 77, is legally considered too old to serve prison time and would have been subjected to house arrest had he not consented to community service. He has been assigned to work at a center run by the Fondazione Sacra Famiglia [official website, in Italian] Catholic foundation in the Lombardy region of Milan one day a week for at least four hours. The court has also restricted Berlusconi's travel, requiring him to remain in the Lombardy region of Italy, allowing him to travel only to Rome Tuesday through Thursday of each week. Berlusconi had already been required to relinquish his passport and has since twice been denied international travel.\n\nTuesday's court ruling is the latest in the legal drama that has plagued Berlusconi for several years. Having been a defendant in nearly 50 cases, Berlusconi has avoided prison through successful appeals and expired statute of limitations. He has, however suffered much political fallout as a result of his criminal charges. With regard to Berlusconi's most recent legal struggles, last month, an Italian high court upheld a two-year ban from public office for Berlusconi as a result of his tax-fraud conviction. For the same reason, the Italian Senate expelled Berlusconi from parliament last November, removing his immunity and making him prone to prosecution for other crimes. In October 2013, Berlusconi was ordered to stand trial for allegedly bribing a senator to switch political parties. The previous June, Berlusconi was convicted of paying a 17-year-old dancer for sex while he was in office and for abusing his power by asking police to release her.

And it completely messed with the psyche of the community.\"\n\nMs Sarsour along with several advocates reportedly met Mr Bratton and other police officials last week to discuss the shutting down of the covert unit.\n\nThe squad's detectives have since been reassigned, a police department spokesman said.\n\nThe head of the New York Civil Liberties Union, Donna Lieberman, told the Associated Press the surveillance had harmed community relations.\n\n\"We hope this means an end to the dragnet approach to policing... and a commitment to going after criminal suspicion, rather than innocent New Yorkers,'' she told AP.\n\nBBC News:\n\nCourt revises order on Mokiwa 300m/- case\n\n|\n\nBISHOP Valentino Mokiwa has moved the Kisutu Resident Magistrate’s Court in Dar es Salaam to revise its order, allowing his opponents to prove their alleged 300m/- dehumanising case in his absence.\n\nThe order sought to be challenged was issued by Senior Resident Magistrate Devota Kisoka on August 13, last year, in favour of three plaintiffs, Erasto Mhagama, Christopher Njavike and George Mwafalo, who are suing Bishop Mokiwa.\n\nThrough advocate Heavenlight Bethuel, the bishop has filed an application, seeking extension of time within which to apply for an order to set aside the order in question and allow the counsel to cross-examine one of the plaintiffs, who has started giving evidence in the matter.\n\nIn the main suit, the three plaintiffs are demanding the said 300m/- being damages for allegedly dehumanisation and abuse of dignity after being threatened by the bishop with a pistol.\n\nThey are also seeking for an order directing the bishop to surrender the gun he allegedly used for the dehumanisation.\n\n“(Bishop Mokiwa) be further ordered to use the Holy Bible instead of the pistol,’ reads one of the players by the plaintiffs in the plaint of the suit.\n\nIn his affidavit to support the application, advocate Bathuel, for the bishop, stated that after they were instructed to represent him, in lieu of his former counsel Dennis Msafiri, they asked for copies of pleadings and applied perusal of court case file to ascertain the status of the case.\n\nOn perusal, he learnt that on August 13, last year, the court ordered the matter to proceed ex-parte for non-appearance of the bishop and Mr Mhagama started testifying on October 19, last year, in a bid to prove the claims contained in the plaint of the suit.\n\nHe stated that the records show that advocate Msafiri had already prepared all the necessary pleadings and had actually appeared in court for the bishop severally, but for the reasons not very clear to him, he did not enter appearance on the subsequent dates before their engagement in the suit.\n\n“No official communications were made on reading the court file which indicates that the applicant (Bishop Mokiwa) was notified either by his advocate or the court of the status of his case to enable him attends in his personal capacity,” advocate Batuel narrated in the affidavit.\n\nDaily News:\n\nRwanda ex-convicts, freed suspects stuck in Arusha\n\n|\n\nArusha.\n\nSeveral Rwandans acquitted or released after serving sentences imposed by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) are stuck in Arusha because no country is ready to accept them.\n\nThey have nowhere else to go because they fear returning to their home country.\n\nThis despite the Rwandan government having stated last year that the ten men who had either been acquitted by the ICRT or completed their sentences were free to return home if no other country was ready to take them in.\n\nThose still stuck in Arusha are former Transport minister Andre Ntagerura, former Rwandan army general Gratien Kabiligi, former Health minister Casmir Bizimungu and businessman Protais Zigiranyirazo.\n\nOthers are former Foreign Affairs minister Jerome Bicamumpaka, former Commerce minister Justin Mugenzi, former Civil Servants minister Prosper Mugiraneza, former Rwandan army general Augustine Ndindiliyimana and former commander of the Reconnaissance Battalion Francis Xavier Nzuwonemeye.\n\nThe group also includes ex-convicts Anatole Ngesiyumva and Tharcisse Muvunyi, both former senior officers in the Rwandan army.\n\nRwandan Justice minister Tharcisse Karugarama last year met with the ICTR Registrar Bongani Majola and discussed the possible relocation of prisoners from Arusha to Rwanda as part of the residual mechanism of the tribunal.\n\nKigali said it would willingly take back the suspects because “they remain Rwandan citizens”. But this drew an agry reaction from a section of genocide survivors.\n\nThe UN tribunal is now having problems relocating the Rwandans because countries which had initially agreed to host them have apparently made a U-turn.\n\nMr Majola said there were seven acquitted persons and three ex-convicts who remain in safe houses in Arusha under the tribunal’s care.\n\nHe said Benin, Mali, France, Senegal, Sweden and Swaziland gad initially indicated their readiness to take in the ten men, but so far only two countries were ready to receive the acquitted persons.\n\nMr Majola said the tribunal was incurring huge expenses to keep the ex-convicts and the acquitted in safe houses in Arusha, adding that Tanzania has not been a preferred country for relocation for the former suspects of the 1994 genocide.\n\nThe Citizen:\n\nArticles of Union made public\n\n|\n\nTHE State House on Monday acknowledged the presence of the Articles of the Union and vowed to bring it to the Constituent Assembly (CA) as proof.\n\nA statement issued by the Directorate of Presidential Communications in Dar es Salaam said that apart from bringing the document to the assembly based on a special request, the government will also arrange for the same to be put in the National Museum for the public to see.\n\nThe statement was released shortly after the Chief Secretary, Ambassador Ombeni Sefue, had met the press over the matter. For quite some time, some CA members have used the absence of the Articles of the Union to question the legitimacy of the Union.\n\n“It is so sad that today, more than 50 years since we united as one republic, some people are coming with arguments that the Union is illegitimate simply because there is no Articles of the Union,” read the statement, adding:\n\n“If the CA Chairman asks for this document to be brought before the Assembly, I am sure President Jakaya Kikwete will be willing so that this chapter can now be closed once and for all.”\n\nAccording to the statement, “the document will be displayed at the National Museum to enable the people of this generation as well as the future generation in the next 50 years to see it.”\n\nThe statement added: “It is absurd that there are people who still question the act by the two founder fathers of the Union to sign the Articles of the Union on April 22, 1964, in addition to insinuating that the two had cheated simply because the document was nowhere to be easily seen.”\n\nIt admitted, however, that it is true there are very sensitive national documents that stand as symbols of the country’s sovereignty, free republic and free union that must be confidentially stored and thus not easily reached.\n\n“Such documents are Articles of the Tanganyika of 1961, Articles of the Tanganyikan Republic of 1962 and the Articles of the Union of 1964.\n\nThese documents are well safeguarded in a very safe place,” it reads further. “But due to the current situation, whereby a number of allegations keep on coming from all corners on the legitimacy of the articles, it is prudent that they are now brought openly for public scrutiny,” the statement pointed out.\n\nThe original documents, which were signed by the Union’s founders, Mwalimu Julius Kambarage Nyerere and his Zanzibar counterpart, Mzee Abeid Amani Karume, were also displayed to the media at a press conference yesterday. But according to the State House statement, President Kikwete was approached and in principle agreed for the documents to be made public.\n\n“This document has been there ever since. It has been well kept by leaders in all phases of the nation’s administration. It has been inherited by the all past phases and will be kept in safe custody forever,” the State House maintained.\n\nAllegations on the legality of the Articles of the Unions have created unnecessary tension, in addition to the dismay of many Tanzanians who have over the years cherished the Union as a model for unity in Africa.\n\nThe State House statement appealed to the people to now direct their attention to other important nation building issues and avoid apportioning blame on the Union’s founders “over the Articles that are after all there for everybody to see.”\n\nDaily News:\n\nUganda: Six women jailed for husband killing\n\n|\n\nLira, Uganda.\n\nSix women have been convicted by the High Court in Lira for killing their husbands.\n\nThe state prosecutor, Ms Sarah Amony ,asked for deterrent sentences against the convicts on account that the offences are brutal and caused painful death to the victims.\n\nHowever, trial judge, Ms Winfred Nabisinde, observed that all the crimes, committed as a result of domestic violence, were not intended by the offenders.\n\n“The circumstance was grave but the mitigation overrides the graveness.

The ruling means the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) can require SeaWorld to limit the interactions trainers have with killer whales.\n\nThe federal agency had fined the company $75,000, a sum later reduced to $12,000, after trainer Dawn Brancheau died in February 2010. She drowned after being pulled underwater by Tilikum, a 12,000-pound (5,400-kg) bull orca at the SeaWorld site in Orlando, Florida.\n\nOSHA, which is part of the U.S. Department of Labor, had told SeaWorld it could resolve the problem by requiring trainers to be protected by physical barriers or by adopting other abatement measures.\n\nSeaWorld, which operates 11 parks around the United States, said in a statement that it already has introduced new safety procedures, including removing trainers from the water during shows. Even after the court's ruling, \"there will still be human interactions and performances with killer whales,\" the statement said.\n\nThe company said it had yet to decide on whether to appeal the decision.\n\nThe Labor Department said in a statement that courts have \"consistently upheld our position that killer whales pose a danger to employees who are not adequately protected.\"\n\n\"BLACKFISH\"\n\nHuman-orca interaction has long been filled with controversy, revisited last year with the release of the movie \"Blackfish\" about Brancheau's death and Tilikum's career as an entertainer and stud for other captive whales. SeaWorld has criticized the film as \"inaccurate and misleading.\"\n\nRights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed the court decision. Jared Goodman, the group's director of animal law, said it \"brings to an end the days of trainers standing and riding on orcas for human amusement.\"\n\nSeaWorld had appealed over the federal agency's application of federal safety law to an unusual workplace situation it had not regulated before.\n\nThe appeals court concluded that OSHA did not overstep its authority in bringing the action against SeaWorld.\n\n\"Statements by SeaWorld managers do not indicate that SeaWorld's safety protocols and training made the killer whales safe; rather, they demonstrate SeaWorld's recognition that the killer whales interacting with trainers are dangerous,\" Judge Judith Rogers wrote on behalf of the court.\n\nShe played down SeaWorld's concerns about the impact on its operations, saying that improved safety \"does not change the essential nature of the business.\"\n\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion noting that people who work in dangerous fields in the sports and entertainment context are aware of the risks.\n\nOSHA has \"departed from tradition and stormed headlong into a new regulatory arena,\" he said.\n\nThe case is SeaWorld v. Dept. of Labor, 12-1375.\n\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley.

Delahanty II at a press conference after the sentencing.\n\nCourt documents seen by the Nation indicate that the defendant entered the United States on a visitor's visa which expired in 2003.\n\n“She married an American man on Dec. 30, 2003, nearly two years after her visitor’s visa expired in order to gain US citizenship more easily,” a prosecutor’s affidavit filed with the court states.\n\nHowever, the judge heard, when the man backed out of the scheme, she filed a petition under the Violence Against Women Act, alleging abuse by her spouse.\n\n“Kimani had been awarded lawful permanent residency in March 2010 based on the false information that her husband sexually, physically and emotionally abused her,” the prosecutor told the jury.\n\nCourt documents show that she was indicted by a federal grand jury in August 2012 and was arrested 13 months later when she returned from a visit to Kenya. She has been held without bail since her arrest on Sept. 5, 2013, at JFK International Airport in New York City.\n\nA jury found her guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud the US government in December 2013.\n\nOn Tuesday, tough talking US government officials sent a warning to would-be perpetrators.\n\n“America’s legal immigration system is not for sale and we will move aggressively against those who willfully compromise the integrity of that system simply to enrich themselves,” said Bruce Foucart, special agent in charge for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations in Boston, whose office headed the investigation that led to the prosecutions.\n\nAnd during a press conference outside the courthouse Tuesday, the prosecutor warned that the US government would be ruthless on scammers.\n\n“ If you commit marriage fraud, there isn’t going to be a honeymoon,” said US Attorney Delahanty.\n\nSHAM MARRIAGES\n\nThe sentencing of Margaret Kimani brings to a close a joint investigation which identified over 40 sham marriages between US citizens and nationals from Kenya, Uganda, Zambia and Cameroon.\n\nThe court heard that the scheme was hatched by a man named James Mbugua, 53, and his friend Rashid Kakande, 41. “ Immigrants seeking an American spouse would pay Mr Kakande or Mr Mbugua between $1,000 and $1,500.\n\nSpouses who provided false information, such as joint bank accounts, rent receipts and utility bills to show that the couple was living together, and attended interviews with immigration officials received further payments,” said Mr Delahanty.\n\nAssistant US Attorney Gail Malone, who prosecuted all of the cases, said at the press conference that Kakande and Mbugua targeted the state of Maine “because there is no waiting period for marriage in the state as is the case in many other states.”\n\nIn addition to prison time, Judge Woodcock sentenced Margaret Kimani to three years of supervised release. Ms Kimani, who is a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) and has a daughter who is a US citizen, is expected to be deported upon completion of her jail term.\n\nDaily Nation:\n\nTurkey's top court strikes down part of Erdogan's judiciary reform law\n\n|\n\nTurkey’s constitutional court has struck down parts of a new law designed to tighten government control of the judiciary. This follows a court decision last week to lift a government-imposed ban on Twitter.\n\n...................\n\nA statement released by the Constitutional Court on Friday said it had cancelled articles within the judicial reform law, which had granted the justice minister powers of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors, (HSYK), an independent body, responsible for judicial appointments.\n\nThe ruling came after a parliamentarian from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) had filed a complaint against the judicial reform, arguing that it violated the principle of separation of powers and the independence of the courts.\n\nThe CHP praised the court for Friday's decision.\n\n\"With its recent decisions, the Constitutional Court has turned into a body championing freedoms, which unsettles the regime,\" said the CHP's deputy chairman, Sezgin Tanrikulu, also referring to the court's earlier decision to lift a ban on Twitter.\n\n\"This law includes so many unconstitutional elements that it would be strange if (the court) gave another decision,\" Tankrikulu told the AFP news agency.\n\nThe government was critical of the court's decision.\n\n\"The legislation was constitutional. The court's decision has not changed my opinion in that regard. But we will of course abide by the ruling,\" Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said.\n\nCorruption scandal\n\nThe judicial reform introduced by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government back in February had sparked outcry from human rights groups and concern about Turkey's democratic credentials in the West.\n\nThis legislation, as well as a ban on Twitter and YouTube, have been widely seen as an attempt by Erdogan to battle through a corruption scandal, which erupted last December after police raids targeted businessmen close to him, as well as the sons of cabinet ministers. He responded by having thousands of police and judiciary officials removed from their positions.\n\nDespite the scandal, Erdogan's AK Party easily won last month's municipal elections.\n\npfd/dr (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters) DW\n\nCourt quashes govt objection on Mbagala victims case\n\n|\n\nDar es Salaam.\n\nThe High Court has thrown out an objection by the government against a case filed by victims of the Mbagala bomb blasts demanding compensation.\n\nThe plaintiffs Aulerian Temba, Athman Mtauka, Elovan Augustino and Catherine Isaya filed a civil suit against the permanent secretary in the ministry of Defence and National Service along with the Attorney General (AG). In the case, filed in 2011, the plaintiffs are opposing the ‘meagre’ compensation provided by the government after their houses were demolished by the bombs.\n\nThey are claiming that the payments were too small compared to the value of their houses and have asked the court, among other things, to order the respondents (the State) to pay them according to the valuation done by their private valuer.\n\nHowever, the government filed an objection asking the court to dismiss the case on the ground that it was filed outside the time limits of filing a civil suit. However, the High Court in its decision yesterday agreed with the plaintiffs’ arguments through their advocate Edson Mkisi that the case had been filed in time and that the republic did not verify any law that supported their objection.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Fauz Twaib said that the objection by the government lacked a legal basis.\n\nThe judge ordered the matter to proceed with the arbitration process in May 28, this year. The plaintiffs allege that the compensation paid to them and others was not enough to even buy a bag of cement, noting that some of the victims were paid money to buy bread only.\n\nThe bombs exploded on April 29, 2009, at the Tanzania People’s Defence Forces (TPDF) Camp KJ 671, causing the deaths of more than 25 people while hundreds of people were injured and many families made homeless after their houses were destroyed.\n\nThe Citizen:\n\nAzam TV saga takes new twist as Yanga go to court\n\n|\n\nDar es Salaam.\n\nThe tug-of-war between Young Africans and the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) over broadcasting rights took a new twist yesterday when the Jangwani team asked the High Court to temporarily block Azam Media Limited from televising their matches.\n\nIn a case they filed yesterday, the club argues that the TFF’s decision to grant Azam Media exclusive rights to broadcast the Vodacom Premier League matches without first seeking their consent was unjust and exploitative, and has put their sponsorship and revenue in jeopardy.\n\nSued along the TFF and Azam Media Limited is the chairman of the Tanzania Premier League Board (TPLB), Hamad Yahya.\n\nThe two sides have been embroiled in the broadcast row since August last year after the TFF awarded Azam exclusive rights to broadcast league matches.\n\nAt its annual general meeting in January, the Yanga leadership claimed that the TFF’s deal with Azam spelt doom for the club as a Sh100million package they earn per year from the latter translated to less than Sh4million per match, an amount that is meagre in light of the club’s fan base. Yesterday, the Registered Trustees of the club asked the court to temporarily bar Azam from televising their matches pending hearing of the case.\n\nYanga argue that if the court will not intervene and annul the deal, the club was likely to lose its sponsorship from Tanzania Breweries Limited (TBL) in the next three years because Azam Media is averse to alcohol advertisement.\n\n“Azam may not positively project commercial advertisements of Yanga sponsors who are beer brewers,” argues the club.\n\nYoung Africans has ignored the fact that they were the owners of all original copyrights in telecast of the games they play before sealing the deal with Azam.\n\n“Clause 4.3 of the agreement gives the TFF all the rights other than those conferred to them, hence robbing our club its copyrights in telecast of its matches,” read part of an affidavit sworn by a member of the club’s board of trustees, Francis Kifukwe.\n\n“Yanga have proprietary interest in the matches and players who have been retained to play for the club at great expenses,” it read.\n\nThe club is accusing TFF of what it described as ‘abuse of statutory dominance in football’ to enter into contracts unjust and exploitative to them.\n\nThe Citizen:\n\nDar fights to save its embassy in Nairobi\n\n|\n\nDar es Salaam.\n\nThe government is embroiled in a case in which it risks losing one of its properties in Nairobi over a Ksh42 million (Sh756 million) debt.\n\nThe case is traceable to January 31, 2000 when the High Court of Zanzibar on January 31, 2000 ordered that Kenyan businessman J. S. Kinyanjui and Lamshore Ltd be paid Sh756 million for supplying rice to the Isles government.\n\nThe businessman moved to the Kenyan High Court and sought the execution of the judgment delivered 14 years ago after he was unable to get the money in Zanzibar.\n\nMr Kinyanjui filed an application for orders to attach and sell a piece of land belonging to the United Republic of Tanzania in a prime area of Nairobi as a way of recovering the money he was awarded.\n\nAlarmed by the move and the possibility of the plot located in Upper Hill area being auctioned off, the government has asked to be joined in the case, arguing that, as owner of the property targeted for the requested auction, it is directly affected and should be part of the case.\n\nIt sought an order to stop the attachment of the land, on which Tanzania plans to build its new high commission premises, until its application is heard and determined.\n\nBoth the government and the applicant have made their submissions and are now waiting for the court to decide whether or not the land should be sold.\n\nAccording to reports reaching The Citizen from Nairobi yesterday, the Tanzanian government says in its submission in the High Court that it is in conflict with the intended sale of its property because even the initial hearing in Zanzibar took place without its involvement.\n\nThe government has further sought to convince judges in Nairobi that the Zanzibar verdict cannot be enforced against the United Republic of Tanzania. It maintained that the government of Zanzibar and the government of the United Republic of Tanzania are two separate legal entities, and one cannot carry out the responsibilities of the other.\n\nAccording to the submissions, the Union government wants the court and the applicant to pin the civil liability matter on the government of Zanzibar. Contacted for comment yesterday, Zanzibar Attorney General Othman Masoud Othman said he was aware of the case, but added that Mr Kinyanjui unsuccessfully filed an application, which sought the execution of the judgment delivered by the High Court of Zanzibar.\n\nHe said Lamshore Ltd had entered into an agreement with the now defunct Bizanje, a company formerly owned by the Zanzibar government, which was responsible for buying cereals and grains.\n\nMr Othman added that it was agreed that Lamshore Ltd supply rice to Bizanje, which had expected the Zanzibar government to provide the money, but the government made it clear that it was not ready to finance the deal.\n\nThis led to the termination of the agreement, prompting Mr Kinyanjui and Lamshore Ltd to file a lawsuit in the Zanzibar High Court, demanding compensation for breach of contract.\n\nThe court ruled in favour of the applicants, but the verdict could not be enforced because the company that terminated the contract no longer existed, according to Mr Othman.\n\nMr Othman added that since Lamshore Ltd was demanding that the Isles government should pay the damages, the applicant filed an application in the High Court of Zanzibar, but the plea was thrown out.\n\nThis prompted Mr Kinyanjui to take his case to Kenya, where he filed a fresh application in the country’s high court in Nairobi.\n\nContacted yesterday for comment, Tanzania’s High Commissioner to Kenya, Dr Batilda Burian, responded: “I can’t say anything since there is a pending court case.”\n\nThe Citizen:\n\nKenya deports 82 Somali nationals in crackdown\n\n|\n\nKenya has deported 82 Somali nationals to Mogadishu in the ongoing security operation on illegal immigrants\n\nThe deportation, coming a day after 69 others were charged in court, was facilitated by the Embassy of Somali. The suspects were deported through a chartered flight that departed from the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) Wednesday at 8.15am.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Lenku and Inspector General of Police David Kimaiyo visited the Kasarani stadium and maintained the operation would continue until the government was convinced that there was adequate security.\n\nCurrently, 472 suspects are held in different police stations in the city pending further investigations. “We can confirm that 82 Somali citizens have been deported. They were even escorted by the Somali ambassador to Kenya,” said Mr Lenku.\n\nBoth Mr Lenku and Mr Kimaiyo denied allegations that the suspects in custody were being subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment at the stations.\n\nThey said that they would continue using the stadium, which had been gazetted as a police station, for screening even after some Muslim leaders led by leader of Majority in the National Assembly Aden Duale protested, claiming that it was inhumane and was also targeting Somali Muslims.\n\nSection 40 of the National Police Service Act empowers the Inspector General, through a notice in the Kenya Gazette, to designate certain places to be police stations.\n\nBoth officials had visited the facility in company of journalist who were allowed to witness the vetting process. For the first time, the UNHCR officials led by the Country Representative Raouf Mazou, the media and human right crusaders were allowed inside the heavily guarded stadium where screening exercise is being carried out.\n\n“We use the stadium for screening suspects only and they do not spend the nights here. It has also been gazette as a police station. Those suspects found innocent are released immediately,” he said.\n\nAt the stadium the suspects were put in separate cells for the children, male and female suspects, under close guard.\n\nRegarding other allegations against the police involved in the exercise, the two maintained that the operation was being conducted professionally. “The operation will be done within the law and so far no reports of bribing or the rape allegations have been established. This is the country’s number one priority,” the cabinet secretary said.\n\nThe police boss Kimaiyo has also warned refugees who have sneaked out of the two designated camps. “We are working closely with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and anyone found to have sneaked from the camps would be dealt with firmly,” he warned.\n\nDaily Nation:\n\nReprieve for Mutua as court dismisses appeal\n\n|\n\nThe Court of Appeal on Wednesday upheld the election of Dr Alfred Mutua as Machakos Governor.\n\nJustice Daniel Musinga - who delivered the judgment on behalf of the three bench comprising of judges Erastus Githinji, Roselyne Nambuye and Kathurima M’inoti - for the second time dismissed former assistant minister Wavinya Ndeti’s appeal case challenging Dr Mutua’s triumph in the 2013 General Election.\n\nIt was a double on Ms Wavinya when the court ruled that she filed her election appeal case out of the required time frame which is within 30 days after delivery of the High Court ruling.\n\nThe judge attributed Ms Wavinya’s loss to not being vigilant enough to pursue the case as she moved to the Court of Appeal two months after the delivery of a judgment by High Court judge David Majanja on September 17 last year.\n\nThe judge upheld the fact that Dr Mutua and his deputy Mr Bernard Muia Kiala through lawyer Mutula Junior Kilonzo had opposed the manner in which the case had been moved to that court and hence struck out the case with costs.\n\n“Without going to the merits of the case, the preliminary objection of Dr Mutua and Mr Katiku is upheld and therefore the appeal is struck out with costs to the respondents,” said Justice Musinga.\n\nIn the ruling, the judge said that the proceedings were ready to be collected and had been certified by the deputy registrar yet Ms Wavinya collected and filed her petition on November 22, 2013 at the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe legal battles between Dr Mutua, who garnered 257,607 votes and Ms Wavinya who got 92,644, kicked off on March 26, 2013.\n\nMs Wavinya alleged that alleged that the County Returning Officer never declared the gubernatorial election results as required by law by reading them out in public and hence accused Dr Mutua of declaring himself the duly elected Governor at the Machakos Bus Park contrary to the provisions of the Elections Act, 2011.\n\nShe had also alleged that Dr Mutua committed several election offences including bribery, voter intimidation, violence and undue influence of voters, ballot stuffing, and illegal voter lists all of which amount to breach of the electoral code of conduct.\n\nThrough lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui, she argued that election was not carried out in a free and fair manner since Forms 35 and 36 had discrepancies which meant that the entire election ought to be cancelled besides 17 witnesses testifying.\n\nLOST TIME\n\nWhile addressing the media after the ruling, Mutua said he was pleased with the outcome of the case and the fact that court had held that he was validly elected.\n\nHe also said that he would now use lost time to focus more on development issues for his county.\n\n“I am happy with the ruling. We have more work now,” he said while accompanied by over five members of parliament from the Eastern region as well as Machakos County Assembly officials.\n\nDaily Nation:"
