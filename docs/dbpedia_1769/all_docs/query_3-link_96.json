        "text": "03/08/24\n\nThe murderer kills himself after circumstances of the crime having been detected\n\nThe body of the lawyer “Muthana Mohamed” was found with gunshot wounds and buried in a farm in in Azaz countryside which is under the control of Turkish forces and factions on “Euphrates Shield” operations room in the eastern countryside of Aleppo, a few days after having been kidnapped in Qah town in Idlib countryside.\n\nAccording to SOHR sources, the murderer, who was called “Ahmed Alloush,” killed himself when members of the military police stormed his house attempting to arrest him, after the circumstances of the crime had been detected, where he was found guilty of the murder of the lawyer.\n\nThis coincides with the escalating security chaos in all zones of influence across Syria.\n\nOn July 29, SOHR sources reported that a lawyer from Saraqeb city was kidnapped in mysterious circumstances by unidentified individuals on the vicinity of Qah town in northern Idlib countryside within HTS-held areas. The kidnapped lawyer was taken to an unknown destination and his fate and the identities of the kidnappers remain unknown.\n\n10/05/24\n\nThamer Habib al-Talla, a lawyer from Hasaka city, was arrested by Syrian regime forces in late April 2024, outside the Palace of Justice in the city, where he was working. He was then taken to the local branch of the regime’s Criminal Security branch in the city.\n\nAccording to intelligence gathered by the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), Thamer’s family learned that his health began to deteriorate a few days after his detention. Although family members urged Criminal Security personnel to transfer him to Hasaka city for urgent medical treatment, all of their appeals were turned down.\n\nOn May 8, 2024, Thamer’s family was notified by a Syrian regime official that he had died at the Criminal Security branch in Hasaka city. His body was returned to his family at the city’s Shabou Hospital later that day. SNHR can confirm that Thamer was in good health at the time of his arrest, indicating a strong probability that he died due to torture and medical negligence in the Criminal Security branch in Hasaka city.\n\nInternational law strictly prohibits torture and all other forms of cruel, degrading, or inhumane torture. The prohibition of torture is a customary rule that cannot be disputed or balanced against other rights or values, even in times of emergency. Violating this rule is a crime under international criminal law. Those who issued the orders for or assisted in carrying out torture are criminally liable for their actions.\n\n[…]\n\n07/09/23\n\nA lawyer died of his injuries after being shot by Turkish border guards while trying to cross into Turkey from Syria via the northwestern region of Idlib, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported on Thursday.\n\nThe lawyer was seeking refuge amid the worsening humanitarian crisis in Syria, where many people are forced to seek safety in neighboring countries, often taking dangerous journeys fraught with risks.\n\nAccording to SOHR, Turkish border guards have been responsible for the deaths of 23 civilians in various regions near the Syrian-Turkish border since the beginning of 2023. During the same period, 36 people, including one child and three women, were injured by gunfire from Turkish border guards.\n\nThe Syrian civil war, which began in March 2011, has killed hundreds of thousands and torn families apart. More than 585,000 people have died in the conflict, and 6.6 million have become refugees in neighboring countries and Europe, with the entire country deeply traumatized by the cruelty of the war.\n\nThe situation in the country has been exacerbated by major earthquakes that hit Turkey and Syria on Feb. 6, which killed more than 50 thousand people.\n\n[…]\n\nhttps://www.evrensel.net/haber/498320/esp-es-genel-baskani-gumustas-ve-avukat-ucar-gozaltina-alindi (TURKCE)\n\n21/12/22\n\nSOHR activists have reported that Turkish Intelligence arrested the 45 year-old lawyer “Luqman Hanan Bin Hamid” from inside his house in Al-Mahmoudiyah neighbourhood in Afrin city, where he was taken to an unknown destination.\n\nThe lawyer hails from Dalanly village in Maabatly district in Afrin countryside north eastern of Aleppo and he suffers a chronic disease, where he was arbitrarily arrested without any known crimes, and his fate remain unknown.\n\nIt is worth noting that the lawyer was previously arrested by the Turkish Intelligence.\n\nLawyers of the Turkish authorities and human rights organizations appealed to reveal the fate of the arrested lawyer and other detainees inside the prison of the Turkish authorities, and demand the instant release of the detainees.\n\n[…]\n\nhttps://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/30270-Lawyer-dies-under-torture-in-Afrin\n\n22/04/22\n\nToday is Lawyers Day in Syria, a day that is celebrated by lawyers from Syria. On this day, we would like to highlight the cases of disappeared lawyers Khalil Ma’touq and Razan Zaitouneh from Syria.\n\nKhalil Ma’touq\n\nKhalil Ma’touq, director of the Syrian Center for Legal Studies and Research, is a human rights lawyer who has been defending peaceful activists for more than 20 years. He and his colleague and assistant Mohammed Zaza have been missing since October 2, 2012, when they were en route from Ma’touq’s home in Sahanaya, a Damascus suburb, to his office in Damascus. It is believed that they were arrested at a government security checkpoint. The exact reasons for the arrest are unknown, but there is reason to believe their arrest is connected to their legitimate and peaceful work in human rights.\n\nDespite repeated requests by their families and lawyers for information about their fate, their whereabouts are still unknown. The Syrian authorities have denied that they arrested the men. However, individuals released from the government’s custody in 2015 have informed Ma’touq’s family that while in detention they spotted him in various government-operated detention facilities.\n\nRazan Zaitouneh\n\nAs a prominent human rights lawyer, activist, and journalist, Razan Zaitouneh has dedicated her life to defending political prisoners, documenting crimes against humanity, and helping others free themselves from oppression. Since the beginning of the crisis in 2011, Razan Zaitouneh has played a key role in efforts to defend human rights for all and protect independent groups and activists in Syria. She is co-founder of the Local Coordination Committees in Syria and the Violations Documentation Center, which documents human rights violations in Syria.\n\nTogether with her husband and two colleagues, Razan Zaitouneh disappeared on 9 December 2013 in Douma, after a group of armed men stormed the office of the Violations Documentation Center. Since then, no one has heard from them.\n\nhttps://www.middleeasteye.net/news/syria-opposition-spokesperson-can-face-war-crimes-french-court-says\n\nhttps://scm.bz/en/scm-statements/intwomen22\n\nhttps://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/syria-landmark-ruling-offers-hope-regime-s-victims\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razan_Zaitouneh\n\nhttps://information.tv5monde.com/info/syrie-razan-zaitouneh-toujours-disparue-4774 (FRANCAIS)\n\n08/05/21\n\nA legal team is fighting to get bond for a Dearborn man accused of being an ISIS soldier who hates America. However, the man has threatened to kill his lawyer as soon as he’s released, according to a government court filing.\n\nU.S. District Judge David Lawson in Detroit will decide the bond issue Monday for Ibraheem Musaibli, 30, held in the Livingston County Jail on charges linked to the Islamic extremist group. A trial is set for October.\n\nThe story of the bond issue was first reported by Robert Snell of The Detroit News.\n\nMusaibli was arrested on the Syrian battlefield in 2018 and subsequently indicted on allegations of knowingly providing and attempting to provide material support to ISIS. He was detained by Syrian Democratic Forces and was transferred to U.S. custody in July 2018.\n\nHe has been in federal custody nearly three years. His attorneys say he’s harassed in jail because he’s Muslim. He’s in isolation.\n\n[…]\n\nIn arguing against bond, the government questioned his ties to the community:\n\nMuch of Musaibli’s history is unremarkable: he worked for his parents’ perfume shop after dropping out of high school; he has had three failed marriages; he has rarely seen his four children (including not even having met two of them); and has few financial resources. Musaibli may have some physical and mental health issues, but none that support his release from custody.\n\nFurther more, the government wrote:\n\nMusaibli expresses that he wants to be imprisoned in an Arab country rather than “this infidel country.” Finally, over a discovery issue, Musaibli claimed that “as soon as he is out he will kill [his] attorney.\n\n[…]\n\nhttps://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/27960/dearborn_man_accused_of_isis_ties_threatened_to_kill_his_lawyer_if_freed_on_bond\n\nhttps://eu.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/wayne-county/2021/05/08/alleged-dearborn-islamic-state-soldier-vows-kill-lawyer-prosecutors-say/7348989002/\n\nhttps://eu.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/19/islamic-state-soldier-set-help-feds-prosecute-dearborn-man-caught-syria/4125093001/\n\n15/03/21\n\nHer fight against injustice made her enemies on all sides of the war. Ten years after Syria’s revolution, DW looks back on her life — and the dark fate that awaited Razan Zaitouneh in rebel-held territory.\n\nRazan Zaitouneh was beaming as she swayed among the protesters. She was caught up in defiant revelry as she joined the crowds in chanting against the Syrian regime.\n\nWhen the revolution kicked off, it was as if Zaitouneh had waited her entire life for it. She was among the first activists to call on the Syrian government to release political prisoners in an open letter published a day after the first major protests on March 15, 2011.\n\n“We are facing one of the most brutal regimes in the region and the world with peaceful protests, songs of freedom — chanting for a new Syria,” she said in a 2011 video statement. “I’m very proud to be Syrian, and to be part of these historical days, and to feel that greatness inside my people.”\n\nBut that wasn’t enough.\n\nBack then, 33-year-old Zaitouneh became directly involved in organizing protests in Damascus and other cities across the country. Her efforts would contribute to the formation of the Local Coordination Committees, which were instrumental to early democratic efforts in Syria.\n\nHer opposition to armed resistance set her apart from many of her contemporaries — some of whom would go on to support organized violence against the regime.\n\n“The most important part of her personality is her rejection of injustice and her willingness to do anything to fight injustice,” says Mazen Darwish, a longtime friend of Zaitouneh who leads the Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression.\n\n“Razan had no ambition for power,” adds Darwish, his eyes bright from remembering her.\n\nSeeds of revolution\n\nEven before she would spearhead revolutionary action in Syria, Zaitouneh championed the rights of the underserved, the marginal and those most at risk of the Assad regime’s brutal security apparatus as a human rights lawyer.\n\n“People’s rights and treating them with justice is not something open to interpretation nor is it a point of view,” Zaitouneh said in the last article she wrote before her disappearance.\n\n[…]\n\nhttps://www.dw.com/en/razan-zaitouneh-the-missing-face-of-syrias-revolution/a-56846873\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razan_Zaitouneh\n\nhttps://www.lavoixdunord.fr/949825/article/2021-03-02/la-justice-francaise-saisie-des-attaques-chimiques-en-syrie (FRANCAIS)\n\nhttps://fr.timesofisrael.com/plainte-visant-les-attaques-chimiques-en-syrie-un-pas-de-plus-contre-limpunite/\n\nhttps://lesjours.fr/obsessions/la-traque-anwar-raslan/ep16-ghouta/\n\nhttps://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razan_Zaitouneh\n\nhttps://www.dw.com/de/razan-zaitouneh-syriens-verstummte-stimme-der-revolution/a-56868567 (DEUTSCH)\n\nhttps://www.avvenire.it/mondo/pagine/quattro-donne-di-siria (ITALIANO)\n\n09/12/20\n\nCivil Society Organizations Demand the Immediate Disclosure of the Fate of Human Rights Activist Razan Zaitouneh and Her Colleagues and Accountability for the Kidnappers\n\nToday completes seven years since the disappearance of the four activists. On December 9, 2013, the joint office of the Violations Documentation Center (VDC) in Syria, the office of the Local Development and Small-Projects Support (LDSPS), and that of the Rising for Freedom magazine in the city of Douma in the countryside of Damascus were attacked by an armed group that kidnapped activists Razan ZAITOUNEH, Wael HAMADA, Samira ALKHALIL, and Nazim HAMMADI. Despite the fact that all the military factions left the area after the forces of the Syrian regime took control of it, the fate of our colleagues remains unknown to this day.\n\nAt a time when the fruits of their labor are being revealed through the documentation of violations and crimes committed, the collection of testimonies, pictures, and data about the chemical attack in Eastern Ghouta in 2013, and the filing of judicial complaints against the perpetrators of these crimes, in addition to the ongoing work in supporting local communities and free civil work in areas outside the control of the Syrian regime, the fate of these activists remains unknown. This is true despite all efforts made by families and friends of the kidnapped to reveal their fate, including communication with many parties and a legal complaint against ‘Jaysh al-Islam’, the main suspect in the kidnapping incident.\n\nOver the past seven years, no real efforts have been made by the countries concerned in the Syrian issue to reveal their fate. Some of them have a kind of guardianship over the military factions and in turn have the ability to put great pressure on them. However, the efforts of politicians, diplomats and representatives of these countries were limited to statements and condemnations that did not help in revealing the fate of the kidnapped.\n\n[…]\n\nhttps://www.dw.com/en/how-germany-could-indict-syrias-assad-for-war-crimes/a-55736276\n\nhttps://syriadirect.org/news/%e2%80%98a-person-who-believed%e2%80%99-remembering-razan-zaitouneh-on-her-41st-birthday/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razan_Zaitouneh\n\nhttps://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razan_Zaitouneh\n\nOctober 13, 2019\n\nNine people were detained by Iranian security forces outside the Turkish embassy in Tehran on Saturday while protesting against Turkey’s ongoing military offensive in northeast Syria.\n\nSince Operation Peace Spring began on Wednesday evening, protests have sprung up across Iranian Kurdistan, also known as Rojhelat, concentrated on the major Kurdish cities of Sanandaj, Baneh, Piranshar, and Marivan, amid a heavy security presence.\n\nHundreds of protesters also gathered outside the Turkish embassy in the Iranian capital Tehran on Saturday to protest Ankara’s Syria offensive. The protesters chanted “death to Turkey and Erdogan” and “Rojava is not alone”.\n\nOne protester, who wished to remain anonymous, told Rudaw at least nine people were detained by security forces.\n\n“Minutes after the protests started, security forces forced the protesters to leave the area with force,” the protester said. “The security forces detained nine protesters.”\n\nAbdullah Jahanbyn, head of a Kurdish lawyers group, and Ismail Salary, a Kurdish human rights lawyer, are among those detained, he added.\n\n…\n\nhttps://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/iran/131020191\n\nhttps://en.radiofarda.com/a/protest-at-turkish-embassy-in-tehran-iran-in-protest-to-syria-invasion/30213462.html"
