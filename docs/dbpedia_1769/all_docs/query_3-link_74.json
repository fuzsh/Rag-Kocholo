        "text": "Storytelling method is an inevitable part of English Language classes. Stories are always an inspiring pedagogical tool to develop different language skills and to inculcate values and culture. In the present technological world, students lack the initiative to read stories and improve their reading skills. They lack interest in reading which has resulted poor reading and writing skills. Thus, a case study was done by integrating a technical tool to motivate students to read and improve their language skills and creativity. The study also aims to give a better understanding of the usage of multimodal approach like Digital storytelling in language learning classrooms. Microsoft photo story 3 was chosen to develop the stories into digital and 24 students of English Foundation level 2 were selected for the study. An evaluation rubric was developed to assess student's digital story together with a survey to get students' perception about the digital storytelling device in English classrooms. The study found the effectiveness of Digital story as a tool in enhancing their involvement in learning process and improving their reading, writing and creative skills. their reading and writing skills by the end of the project. Throughout the process of story building, they developed how to organize, cooperate and collaborate to reach their goal. The tool can be implemented for blending learning purposes where the teachers or the students make their own contents and share to others.\n\n___________________________________________________________________ This study is an experimental study. It aims to find out whether teaching narrative text using digital storytelling is effective to enhance students' mastery in writing. This research also reveal the significant difference in the achievement between students who are taught using digital storytelling and those who are taught using conventional technique. In order to achieve those objectives, I conducted an experimental study. The population of this study was the eighth graders of SMPN 1 Grobogan. The experimental group was VIII-1 and the control group was VIII-2. The experimental group was taught using digital storytelling and the control group was taught using conventional technique. The result after a treatment was given shows that the mean of experimental group was higher than the control group. Therefore, there is a significant difference in students' achievement that was taught using digital storytelling and using conventional technique. It is concluded the use of digital storytelling as visual aid can improve students' mastery in writing narrative.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate whether students of English as a foreign language (EFL) at the Lebanese University (LU) can effectively improve their language proficiency by creating digital stories. To do so, the researcher introduced digital storytelling (DST) as an optional assignment in an EFL communication course offered at LU in the fall of 2017-2018. Participants were 20 second-year student-teachers majoring in EFL education. After the completion of their individual or group digital storytelling projects, all the 16 videos were uploaded on the researcher&#39;s YouTube channel and shared on Facebook and WhatsApp. Participants then answered open-ended survey questions about their experience working on DST. Results show that most participants found the activity enjoyable and educational and were eager to repeat their experience, in spite of the technical difficulties they faced. Many participants also reported having gained more self-confidence and improved their Pro...\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate whether students of English as a foreign language (EFL) at the Lebanese University (LU) can effectively improve their language proficiency by creating digital stories.

Results show that most participants found the activity enjoyable and educational and were eager to repeat their experience, in spite of the technical difficulties they faced. Many participants also reported having gained more self-confidence and improved their Pronunciation, organizational, technical and research skills, as well as their ability to deliver presentations. The majority of participants found the social aspect of DST highly rewarding and enjoyed sharing their work online with their friends and other English-speakers globally. The positive outcomes of this study suggest that DST should be included in the curriculum of university-EFL communication courses. IOJET\n\nDrawing from the theoretical context of multiliteracies & ICT implementation in the classroom, and on the theoretical basis of the Literature Teaching Research Group, the current study argues that digital storytelling is a very promising pedagogical tool for teaching literature. Findings show that the creative implementation of digital storytelling in the language arts classroom motivates students to read literature and inspires deeper reader engagement. The study suggests that students have more opportunities to produce spontaneous personal discourse for authentic communication circumstances, to of other semiotics beyond the word, exercising alongside traditional literacies, contemporary multiliteracies (media literacy, digital literacy, critical literacy etc).\n\nBased on a preliminary investigation into the reasons of pupils&#39; failure to write narrative texts. This study seeks to explain the ambiance of enhancing students&#39; story writing skills via the use of Digital Storytelling. Together, the collaborator and I created the lesson plans, implemented the activities, made observations, and reflected on the outcomes. To accomplish these aims, we performed two cycles of action research consisting of planning, implementation, observation, and reflection. Using classroom observation, interviews, questionnaires, and assessments, the data was obtained. Digital Storytelling was beneficial in enhancing students&#39; story writing skills, according to the data. This is evident from the results of three tests: the pre-test, the test after cycle 1 and the test after cycle 2. Where the typical test score is 3.57 on the first test, 5.36 on the second, and 7.01 on the third. It is also evident from the results of the survey, in which 52 percent of s...\n\nThe evolution of digital technologies implies a paradigm shift in teaching methods. The national curriculum for Portuguese language teaching at Elementary School level highlights the role of technologies, considering that these new methods require mastery of multiple literacies. In this context, we attempt to provide through student developed multimodal digital narratives, the chance to access a multiplicity of textual environments, in particular digital and visual ones. We set out a case study designed to answer the following research questions: how can multimodal texts contribute to development of the study of narrative? Which implications could the creation of digital narratives have in the improvement of writing skills? Would the use of digital resources inside the classroom interfere with the students’ motivation and mutual collaboration? In this article we provide: a brief theoretical contextualization of digital narratives in the context of mother language learning; the proje...\n\nThis article describes the implementation of digital storytelling in an English language class of eleventh graders at a private school in Mosquera, Colombia. It is a descriptive qualitative study, carried out for about six months by using digital tools to foster language production in the language learners. The implementation contained digital storytelling as a pedagogical strategy for developing the writing literacy practice. The personal stories and media literacy allowed the participants to combine both narratives and digital elements when writing in English in a collaborative work-group in which they co-constructed their stories. The data collected was analyzed by using ATLAS ti. Open questions looked for information about the writing process and the digital tools implemented when creating the stories. The findings revealed that the participants developed writing and speaking manners while assuming different roles. In addition, the digitalization of stories strengthened their multi-literacies. The participants’ recordings of their voices helped them improve their oral production without worrying about their classmates’ opinion. Finally, negotiation in the group roles, as writer, designer and media creator, played an important role when working in groups."
