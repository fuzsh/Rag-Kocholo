        "text": "In-service training is a concept that increases the productivity, motivation, employee quality and decreases labor turnover in the organizations. It is an important part of the vocational education of our country. The career plan is the professional life of an individual who wants to realize it. Education and careers are two issues that complement each other. This study was conducted to determine the effect of in-service training programs on individual career management in the organizations. The research was applied in the 3rd Organized Industrial Zone in Konya. It is hoped that it will fill the lack of the studies applied in the organizations in the literature, the universe of the study, which was conducted by simple random sampling method, consists of 610 people working in seven different enterprises. The number of the questionnaires were 298 which were returned and 289 of them were accepted as valid. The questionnaire has been consisted of 30 questions related to the perception of in-service training and 19 questions related to personal career plan scale. Cronbach's Alpha value for reliability analysis for in-service training was 0,953 and personal career plan scale was found as 0.863. As a result of the analysis, it has been determined that in-service training programs have been a significant and positive effect on individual career management and sub-dimensions of it.\n\nDiscrimination in the work environment is one of the basic problems of social policy nationally and internationally. This consists in the act of treating a person differently — negatively or positively — based on that person's race, class, religion, sexual orientation/gender or any other group to which that person belongs, rather than assessing individual needs and merits. Positive discrimination towards women refers to the act of granting them advantages in a society in which they are often treated unfairly due to sex/race/religion etc. According to the ILO, social insurances in basic social security system institutions in industrial society were regulated by men and only their needs were taken into account. After World War II, the developing service sector and increasing participation of women in the workforce (especially in atypical jobs) established essential new regulations regarding women in social insurance systems. Social insurance is defined gender-neutrally in Turkish Social Insurance Law. There are also special provisions regarding women, such as allowing them to retire earlier and maternity insurance. The unique positive discrimination regulation regarding women in the Turkish Social Insurance System is that girls qualify for orphan pensions without an age limit. In addition to this, (widow) women can qualify for widow pensions after their late husbands. Similarly, women who are both widows and not married can also qualify for pensions. However, receiving benefits from health services can be exemplified. These practices regarding women represent a women-friendly social security system. But, in 2008, by means of the Social Security Reform, some relevant practices were limited and put in order with new regulations regarding positive discrimination towards women, such as statutory maternity pay, caring for children with disabilities, maternity and parental leaves, work-life (motherhood) balance.\n\nAbstract As a result of the disappearance of the borders as well, outsourcing has become a modern management technique , which is used quite commonly by businesses wanting to increase productivity .Starting in the 1980s ,gaining momentum in the 1990s applications of subcontracting initially has a cost reducing function,but in the course of time ,with the contraction request and focus of the core competency of the companies, the use of outsourcing has become a management tool that provides competitive advantage.Nowadays businesses focus on core competencies that provide themselves advantage of competition, making goal-oriented collaborations rather than expanding corporeally.They aim at increasing quality lowering costs and thus gaining business profibility, handing over activities that directly have nothing to do with their area of specialization to outer businesses specialized in this area.This study , as a management strategy, aims at investigating the causes of outsourcing use in businesses and benefits and drawbacks brought on by the use of outsourcing. The study is comprised of four sections and the causes of outsourcing use are explained under ten sub-headings in the second chapter after introduction.The third section deals with benefits and losses that the use of outsourcing secures for businesses and finally the study comes to an end with the conclusion. Keywords: Outsourcing, Management Strategy, Core competency"
