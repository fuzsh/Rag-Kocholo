'Bimbiliki Pilapi', the first single from 'Prince', will be released in theatres in Telugu and Tamil on October 21. The news is that the song has clocked 150 million views on Chingari, the video-sharing mobile app.

For composer Thaman, this is yet another blockbuster. Crooned by Ram Miriyala, Ramya Behara and Sahithi Chaganti, the song has lyrics written by Ramajogayya Sastry.

Shot on Sivakarthikeyan and Ukrainian actress Maria Ryaboshapka, the song's success is a good sign.
