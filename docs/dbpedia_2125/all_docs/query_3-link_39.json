        "text": "Dior recently premiered a new advertisement for their \"reinvented\" Rouge Dior lipstick; it stars Natalie Portman and is soundtracked by Prince's \"Raspberry Beret\". Two years ago they also had an advertisement for one of their lipsticks which also starred Portman, and that one used Prince's \"Kiss\".\n\nDid anything similar ever happen while Prince was alive?\n\nWhile it was rare, Prince did on occasion license his music for usage in advertisements.\n\nThis is a likely incomplete list:\n\nPrince sold a clip of \"Little Red Corvette\" from his Sign O' The Times concert movie to Chevrolet.\n\nTina Turner's cover of \"Baby I'm A Star\" was used by Target (and yes, Prince had to approve that).\n\nCBS's The Super Bowl Today on 26 January 1992 featured an alternate version of the video Prince filmed for \"Willing And Able\", featuring \"footage of football players lip-syncing the lyrics\". As reported in Daily Press:\n\nThe pre-game broadcast began with the world premiere of Minneapolis native Prince’s new video for his new song ”Willing and Able.” The video contained film of Bills and Redskins players in action. However, Prince’s falsetto voice did not provide very appropriate accompaniment for this footage.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Times reported:\n\nThe lineup\n\n3:30-4 p.m.: The Super Bowl Today opening is a music video by Minneapolis native Prince, who will perform the unreleased single Willing and Able. Prince delayed the release of the single so it could be released in conjunction with the Super Bowl. Players from both the Washington Redskins and Buffalo Bills lip-sync to the rap portion of the song.\n\nPrince wrote a song titled \"Coca-Cola\".\n\nIt is believed that the track was written as a theme for the Coca-Cola Company, and most likely in particular for their Coca-Cola soft drink (the Coca-Cola Company sponsored the Act II Tour in 1993). The track's lyrics indicate that it was recorded for a commercial (including \"Life is exciting, oh yeah, but when you've got the real thing, it's better. Coca-Cola, go get some, it's the real thing. Always Coca-Cola.\")\n\nThe 1993 Act II Tour was sponsored by Coca-Cola and each concert was littered with ads for it: on the video screens, on the tickets (the image below comes courtesy of Unused-Prince-Tickets.com),... There was even a sphere with the Coca-Cola logo at the mix desk (IIRC).\n\nPrince's \"Guitar\" was used by Verizon in a video he filmed for them.\n\nsix weeks prior to the album’s release, the album version of Guitar was available for download on Verizon Wireless in the USA, and a short promotional clip of Prince and his band performing the song was used in TV advertisements.\n\nYou can find more info about the Prince/Verizon collaboration in this flyer.\n\n\"Dreamer\" was used in a Target ad for the Lotusflow3r album (this video was specifically filmed for the ad AFAIK).\n\nAllegedly \"Wow\" (a.k.a. \"The Unexpected\") was intended for a commercial for Coca-Cola or Pepsi.\n\nanswered Jan 5, 2021 at 12:03\n\nBCdotWEBBCdotWEB\n\n2,8841717 silver badges4040 bronze badges"
