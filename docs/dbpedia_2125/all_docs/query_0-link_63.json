        "text": "Almost every year Harold Prince sits on the aisle at the annual Tony Awards and makes at least one joyful trek to the stage—as he did Sunday night to receive a Tony as the producer of the season's best musical, “A Little Night Music.”\n\nWhen Mr. Prince is not claiming one of his many honors, he is watching appreciatively as one of his associates is adding to the Prince‐inspired catalogue of awards. Five additional Tonys were given to “A Little Night Music”—to the composerlyricist Stephen Sondheim, the actresses Glynis Johns and Patricia Elliott, the author Hugh Wheeler and the costume designer Florence Klotz.\n\nThis year, as has often been the case, Mr. Prince was himself nominated in two categories—as producer and director. The directing award eluded him this time, but it is an honor he has already won twice.\n\nHe is that rare person in the musical theater, a producer‐director—both a manager and a creative artist. This means, of course, that his duties are doubled and his worries are multiplied. But what other producer could be as encouraging of his innovations, and what other director would keep such a watchful eye on his budget?\n\nWith “Company” and “Follies,” Mr. Prince burnished his notion of a concept musical. His collaborator on both those shows was Mr. Sondheim, and many people expected that their next show would be, like the last two, satiric and contemporary.\n\nSetting Off Sparks\n\nInstead, “A Little Night Music” is a waltz musical, almost an operetta, with a gentle and harmonious spirit. Confirming that it was for him a change of pace, Mr. Prince said: “In the past I've lectured us on the necessity for abrasion, for things to collide, to set off sparks. I didn't want this show to be rough‐hewn. The seams couldn't show. It's like—off a spool.”\n\nAs the show unwinds (at the Shubert Theater) one can see traces of Ingmar Bergman's comedy, “Smiles of a Summer Night.” That film is the source, but not the cause, of “Night Music.”\n\nThe notion of a waltz musical was something Mr. Prince and Mr. Sondheim had been contemplating as a change of pace ever since they worked on “West Side Story.” The proposed property at that time was Jean Anouilh's “Ring Round the Moon.”\n\nAfter “Follies,” Mr. Prince dusted off the idea, and in addition to the Anouilh, he considered “Smiles of a Summer Night and Jean Renoir's “Rules of the Game,” settling on the Bergman because “it had all the qualities we wanted and perhaps a little more warmth and compassion.”\n\nMr. Bergman sold the rights when he was assured that the producer did not intend “a rigid adaptation” of his film, but rather a musical freely suggested by it. Under Mr. Prince's guidance, Mr. Wheeler followed the line of the film, and most of the characters, but there were some changes in plot.\n\nThe framework, a crucial part of any Prince show, this time was partially an accident. As Mr. Prince recalled, “The very first song Steve wrote, he said, ‘I brought in a liebesliede group, standing around a piano.’ I said, ‘Why?’ He said, ‘It looks nice.’ I proceeded to worry, about it. Then the idea of their singing the overture occurred to me.”\n\nMr. Prince filtered the group through the action. “They, relate to the audience,” he said. “They represent in our heads the people in the show who aren't wasting time.” As Mr. Prince sees it “the play is about wasting time.” “It's also about the masks people wear,” he said. “They think, ‘I am 45 so I am over the hill.’ ‘I am 18, married to a man of 45, so he's my father.’ They strip themselves of those things by the end of the show.”\n\nThe score came slowly from Mr. Sondheim. “By the time rehearsals began,” Mr. Prince said, “the score was only half finished. When it was time for the actors to sing, they would say, ‘And now I sing’.”\n\nWatching the actors walk around Boris Aronson's country setting saying their lines, instead of singing the song he was supposed to have written, Mr. Sondheim got the inspiration for his lilting “A Weekend in the Country.”\n\nAt the end of the Boston run, the composer wrote “The Miller's Son,” and it was decided that the actress who was supposed to sing it in the role of a maid did not have a strong enough voice. Mr. Prince recalled a young lady named D. Jamin‐Bartlett, who had originally been rejected for the role. He signed her up. In two weeks she made her Broadway debut and stopped the show with the song, and in the reviews won almost as much attention and praise as the principals — Glynis Johns, Len Cariou and Hermione Gingold.\n\nUntrying Experience\n\nCuriously enough, this time out Mr. Prince found that his greatest problem was not artistic but “My God, the money didn't come in as it used to.” In the past his secretary has sent letters to his backers — many of whom have been faithful since “West Side Story” — and money came back automatically.\n\nBut “Company” made only a small profit, “Follies” lost around $700,000, and Mr. Prince was forced to find new money. With a twinge of embarrassment, he admits that he was on the brink of holding backers' auditions.\n\nIn all other respects Mr. Prince found the show an untrying experience. “It was less anguishing, less cathartic and troublesome,” he concluded, attributing the fact largely to the nature of the material and of the participants—happy shows make happy producers.\n\nBut there is one lingering concern. To keep prices down and to win new audiences, every night Mr. Prince is selling 40 balcony seats for $2, and Monday through Thursday he is selling 80 orchestra seats for $6.75. Although the $6.75 seats are good ones, because of a kind of audience snobbism, half of them remain empty while the $12 seats sellout.\n\n“They must think those seats are under water,” Mr. Prince said in exasperation. It is the kind of irony that gives happy producers nightmares."
