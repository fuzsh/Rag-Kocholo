        "text": "Synopsis:\n\nDon Pedro and his soldiers, disguised in masks, dance with the ladies of Leonato’s household. While Don Pedro woos Hero, Beatrice mocks Benedick. After the dance, Don John distresses Claudio by telling him that Don Pedro has won Hero’s love. When Claudio learns that Hero has been won in his name, he wants to marry her immediately. Leonato insists that at least a week is needed to prepare for the wedding. Don Pedro proposes that the intervening time be used to trick Benedick and Beatrice into falling in love.\n\nEnter Leonato, his brother, Hero his daughter, and\n\nBeatrice his niece, ⌜with Ursula and Margaret.⌝\n\nLEONATO 0424 Was not Count John here at supper?\n\nLEONATO’S BROTHER 0425 I saw him not.\n\nBEATRICE 0426 How tartly that gentleman looks! I never\n\n0427 can see him but I am heartburned an hour after.\n\nHERO 0428 5He is of a very melancholy disposition.\n\nBEATRICE 0429 He were an excellent man that were made\n\n0430 just in the midway between him and Benedick. The\n\n0431 one is too like an image and says nothing, and the\n\n0432 other too like my lady’s eldest son, evermore\n\n0433 10 tattling.\n\nLEONATO 0434 Then half Signior Benedick’s tongue in\n\n0435 Count John’s mouth, and half Count John’s melancholy\n\n0436 in Signior Benedick’s face—\n\nBEATRICE 0437 With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and\n\n0438 15 money enough in his purse, such a man would win\n\n0439 any woman in the world if he could get her\n\n0440 goodwill.\n\nLEONATO 0441 By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a\n\n0442 husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.\n\nLEONATO’S BROTHER 0443 20In faith, she’s too curst.\n\nBEATRICE 0444 Too curst is more than curst. I shall lessen\n\n0445 God’s sending that way, for it is said “God sends a\n\np. 39\n\n0446 curst cow short horns,” but to a cow too curst, he\n\n0447 sends none.\n\nLEONATO 0448 25So, by being too curst, God will send you no\n\n0449 horns.\n\nBEATRICE 0450 Just, if He send me no husband, for the\n\n0451 which blessing I am at Him upon my knees every\n\n0452 morning and evening. Lord, I could not endure a\n\n0453 30 husband with a beard on his face. I had rather lie in\n\n0454 the woolen!\n\nLEONATO 0455 You may light on a husband that hath no\n\n0456 beard.\n\nBEATRICE 0457 What should I do with him? Dress him in my\n\n0458 35 apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman?\n\n0459 He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he\n\n0460 that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is\n\n0461 more than a youth is not for me, and he that is less\n\n0462 than a man, I am not for him. Therefore I will even\n\n0463 40 take sixpence in earnest of the bearherd, and lead\n\n0464 his apes into hell.\n\nLEONATO 0465 Well then, go you into hell?\n\nBEATRICE 0466 No, but to the gate, and there will the devil\n\n0467 meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his\n\n0468 45 head, and say “Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you\n\n0469 to heaven; here’s no place for you maids.” So deliver\n\n0470 I up my apes and away to Saint Peter; for the\n\n0471 heavens, he shows me where the bachelors sit, and\n\n0472 there live we as merry as the day is long.\n\nLEONATO’S BROTHER, ⌜to Hero⌝ 0473 50Well, niece, I trust you\n\n0474 will be ruled by your father.\n\nBEATRICE 0475 Yes, faith, it is my cousin’s duty to make\n\n0476 curtsy and say “Father, as it please you.” But yet for\n\n0477 all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or\n\n0478 55 else make another curtsy and say “Father, as it\n\n0479 please me.”\n\nLEONATO 0480 Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted\n\n0481 with a husband.\n\np. 41\n\nBEATRICE 0482 Not till God make men of some other metal\n\n0483 60 than earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be\n\n0484 overmastered with a piece of valiant dust? To make\n\n0485 an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?\n\n0486 No, uncle, I’ll none. Adam’s sons are my brethren,\n\n0487 and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.\n\nLEONATO, ⌜to Hero⌝ 0488 65Daughter, remember what I told\n\n0489 you. If the Prince do solicit you in that kind, you\n\n0490 know your answer.\n\nBEATRICE 0491 The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you\n\n0492 be not wooed in good time. If the Prince be too\n\n0493 70 important, tell him there is measure in everything,\n\n0494 and so dance out the answer. For hear me, Hero,\n\n0495 wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a\n\n0496 measure, and a cinquepace. The first suit is hot and\n\n0497 hasty like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the\n\n0498 75 wedding, mannerly modest as a measure, full of\n\n0499 state and ancientry; and then comes repentance,\n\n0500 and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster\n\n0501 and faster till he sink into his grave.\n\nLEONATO 0502 Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.\n\nBEATRICE 0503 80I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church\n\n0504 by daylight.\n\nLEONATO 0505 The revelers are entering, brother. Make\n\n0506 good room.⌜Leonato and his brother step aside.⌝\n\nEnter, ⌜with a Drum,⌝ Prince Pedro, Claudio, and\n\nBenedick, ⌜Signior Antonio,⌝ and Balthasar, ⌜all in\n\nmasks, with Borachio and Don⌝ John.\n\nPRINCE, ⌜to Hero⌝ 0507 Lady, will you walk a bout with your\n\n0508 85 friend?⌜They begin to dance.⌝\n\nHERO 0509 So you walk softly, and look sweetly, and say\n\n0510 nothing, I am yours for the walk, and especially\n\n0511 when I walk away.\n\nPRINCE 0512 With me in your company?\n\nHERO 0513 90I may say so when I please.\n\np. 43\n\nPRINCE 0514 And when please you to say so?\n\nHERO 0515 When I like your favor, for God defend the lute\n\n0516 should be like the case.\n\nPRINCE 0517 My visor is Philemon’s roof; within the house\n\n0518 95 is Jove.\n\nHERO 0519 Why, then, your visor should be thatched.\n\nPRINCE 0520 Speak low if you speak love.\n\n⌜They move aside;\n\nBenedick and Margaret move forward.⌝\n\nBENEDICK, ⌜to Margaret⌝ 0521 Well, I would you did like me.\n\nMARGARET 0522 So would not I for your own sake, for I have\n\n0523 100 many ill qualities.\n\nBENEDICK 0524 Which is one?\n\nMARGARET 0525 I say my prayers aloud.\n\nBENEDICK 0526 I love you the better; the hearers may cry\n\n0527 “Amen.”\n\nMARGARET 0528 105God match me with a good dancer.\n\n⌜They separate; Benedick moves aside;\n\nBalthasar moves forward.⌝\n\nBALTHASAR 0529 Amen.\n\nMARGARET 0530 And God keep him out of my sight when the\n\n0531 dance is done. Answer, clerk.\n\nBALTHASAR 0532 No more words. The clerk is answered.\n\n⌜They move aside;\n\nUrsula and Antonio move forward.⌝\n\nURSULA 0533 110I know you well enough. You are Signior\n\n0534 Antonio.\n\nANTONIO 0535 At a word, I am not.\n\nURSULA 0536 I know you by the waggling of your head.\n\nANTONIO 0537 To tell you true, I counterfeit him.\n\nURSULA 0538 115You could never do him so ill-well unless you\n\n0539 were the very man. Here’s his dry hand up and\n\n0540 down. You are he, you are he.\n\nANTONIO 0541 At a word, I am not.\n\nURSULA 0542 Come, come, do you think I do not know you\n\n0543 120 by your excellent wit? Can virtue hide itself? Go to,\n\np. 45\n\n0544 mum, you are he. Graces will appear, and there’s an\n\n0545 end.\n\n⌜They move aside;\n\nBenedick and Beatrice move forward.⌝\n\nBEATRICE 0546 Will you not tell me who told you so?\n\nBENEDICK 0547 No, you shall pardon me.\n\nBEATRICE 0548 125Nor will you not tell me who you are?\n\nBENEDICK 0549 Not now.\n\nBEATRICE 0550 That I was disdainful, and that I had my\n\n0551 good wit out of The Hundred Merry Tales! Well, this\n\n0552 was Signior Benedick that said so.\n\nBENEDICK 0553 130What’s he?\n\nBEATRICE 0554 I am sure you know him well enough.\n\nBENEDICK 0555 Not I, believe me.\n\nBEATRICE 0556 Did he never make you laugh?\n\nBENEDICK 0557 I pray you, what is he?\n\nBEATRICE 0558 135Why, he is the Prince’s jester, a very dull\n\n0559 fool; only his gift is in devising impossible slanders.\n\n0560 None but libertines delight in him, and the commendation\n\n0561 is not in his wit but in his villainy, for he\n\n0562 both pleases men and angers them, and then they\n\n0563 140 laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in the\n\n0564 fleet.I would he had boarded me.\n\nBENEDICK 0565 When I know the gentleman, I’ll tell him\n\n0566 what you say.\n\nBEATRICE 0567 Do, do. He’ll but break a comparison or two\n\n0568 145 on me, which peradventure not marked or not\n\n0569 laughed at strikes him into melancholy, and then\n\n0570 there’s a partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat\n\n0571 no supper that night. ⌜Music for the dance.⌝ We must\n\n0572 follow the leaders.\n\nBENEDICK 0573 150In every good thing.\n\nBEATRICE 0574 Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them\n\n0575 at the next turning.\n\nDance. ⌜Then⌝ exit ⌜all except\n\nDon John, Borachio, and Claudio.⌝\n\np. 47\n\nDON JOHN, ⌜to Borachio⌝ 0576 Sure my brother is amorous\n\n0577 on Hero, and hath withdrawn her father to break\n\n0578 155 with him about it. The ladies follow her, and but one\n\n0579 visor remains.\n\nBORACHIO 0580 And that is Claudio. I know him by his\n\n0581 bearing.\n\nDON JOHN, ⌜to Claudio⌝ 0582 Are not you Signior Benedick?\n\nCLAUDIO 0583 160You know me well. I am he.\n\nDON JOHN 0584 Signior, you are very near my brother in his\n\n0585 love. He is enamored on Hero. I pray you dissuade\n\n0586 him from her. She is no equal for his birth. You\n\n0587 may do the part of an honest man in it.\n\nCLAUDIO 0588 165How know you he loves her?\n\nDON JOHN 0589 I heard him swear his affection.\n\nBORACHIO 0590 So did I too, and he swore he would marry\n\n0591 her tonight.\n\nDON JOHN 0592 Come, let us to the banquet.\n\nThey exit. Claudio remains.\n\nCLAUDIO, ⌜unmasking⌝\n\n0593 170 Thus answer I in name of Benedick,\n\n0594 But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.\n\n0595 ’Tis certain so. The Prince woos for himself.\n\n0596 Friendship is constant in all other things\n\n0597 Save in the office and affairs of love.\n\n0598 175 Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues.\n\n0599 Let every eye negotiate for itself\n\n0600 And trust no agent, for beauty is a witch\n\n0601 Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.\n\n0602 This is an accident of hourly proof,\n\n0603 180 Which I mistrusted not. Farewell therefore, Hero.\n\nEnter Benedick.\n\nBENEDICK 0604 Count Claudio?\n\nCLAUDIO 0605 Yea, the same.\n\nBENEDICK 0606 Come, will you go with me?\n\nCLAUDIO 0607 Whither?\n\np. 49\n\nBENEDICK 0608 185Even to the next willow, about your own\n\n0609 business, county. What fashion will you wear the\n\n0610 garland of? About your neck like an usurer’s chain?\n\n0611 Or under your arm like a lieutenant’s scarf? You\n\n0612 must wear it one way, for the Prince hath got your\n\n0613 190 Hero.\n\nCLAUDIO 0614 I wish him joy of her.\n\nBENEDICK 0615 Why, that’s spoken like an honest drover; so\n\n0616 they sell bullocks. But did you think the Prince\n\n0617 would have served you thus?\n\nCLAUDIO 0618 195I pray you, leave me.\n\nBENEDICK 0619 Ho, now you strike like the blind man.\n\n0620 ’Twas the boy that stole your meat, and you’ll beat\n\n0621 the post.\n\nCLAUDIO 0622 If it will not be, I’ll leave you.He exits.\n\nBENEDICK 0623 200Alas, poor hurt fowl, now will he creep into\n\n0624 sedges. But that my Lady Beatrice should know\n\n0625 me, and not know me! The Prince’s fool! Ha, it may\n\n0626 be I go under that title because I am merry. Yea, but\n\n0627 so I am apt to do myself wrong. I am not so reputed!\n\n0628 205 It is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice\n\n0629 that puts the world into her person and so gives me\n\n0630 out. Well, I’ll be revenged as I may.\n\nEnter the Prince, Hero, ⌜and⌝ Leonato.\n\nPRINCE 0631 Now, signior, where’s the Count? Did you see\n\n0632 him?\n\nBENEDICK 0633 210Troth, my lord, I have played the part of\n\n0634 Lady Fame. I found him here as melancholy as a\n\n0635 lodge in a warren. I told him, and I think I told him\n\n0636 true, that your Grace had got the goodwill of this\n\n0637 young lady, and I offered him my company to a\n\n0638 215 willow tree, either to make him a garland, as being\n\n0639 forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to\n\n0640 be whipped.\n\nPRINCE 0641 To be whipped? What’s his fault?\n\np. 51\n\nBENEDICK 0642 The flat transgression of a schoolboy who,\n\n0643 220 being overjoyed with finding a bird’s nest, shows it\n\n0644 his companion, and he steals it.\n\nPRINCE 0645 Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The\n\n0646 transgression is in the stealer.\n\nBENEDICK 0647 Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been\n\n0648 225 made, and the garland too, for the garland he\n\n0649 might have worn himself, and the rod he might\n\n0650 have bestowed on you, who, as I take it, have stolen\n\n0651 his bird’s nest.\n\nPRINCE 0652 I will but teach them to sing and restore them\n\n0653 230 to the owner.\n\nBENEDICK 0654 If their singing answer your saying, by my\n\n0655 faith, you say honestly.\n\nPRINCE 0656 The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you. The\n\n0657 gentleman that danced with her told her she is\n\n0658 235 much wronged by you.\n\nBENEDICK 0659 O, she misused me past the endurance of a\n\n0660 block! An oak but with one green leaf on it would\n\n0661 have answered her. My very visor began to assume\n\n0662 life and scold with her. She told me, not thinking I\n\n0663 240 had been myself, that I was the Prince’s jester, that I\n\n0664 was duller than a great thaw, huddling jest upon jest\n\n0665 with such impossible conveyance upon me that I\n\n0666 stood like a man at a mark with a whole army\n\n0667 shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every\n\n0668 245 word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her\n\n0669 terminations, there were no living near her; she\n\n0670 would infect to the North Star. I would not marry\n\n0671 her though she were endowed with all that Adam\n\n0672 had left him before he transgressed. She would have\n\n0673 250 made Hercules have turned spit, yea, and have cleft\n\n0674 his club to make the fire, too. Come, talk not of her.\n\n0675 You shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I\n\n0676 would to God some scholar would conjure her, for\n\n0677 certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet\n\np. 53\n\n0678 255 in hell as in a sanctuary, and people sin upon\n\n0679 purpose because they would go thither. So indeed\n\n0680 all disquiet, horror, and perturbation follows her.\n\nEnter Claudio and Beatrice.\n\nPRINCE 0681 Look, here she comes.\n\nBENEDICK 0682 Will your Grace command me any service\n\n0683 260 to the world’s end? I will go on the slightest errand\n\n0684 now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send\n\n0685 me on. I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the\n\n0686 furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of Prester\n\n0687 John’s foot, fetch you a hair off the great Cham’s\n\n0688 265 beard, do you any embassage to the Pygmies, rather\n\n0689 than hold three words’ conference with this harpy.\n\n0690 You have no employment for me?\n\nPRINCE 0691 None but to desire your good company.\n\nBENEDICK 0692 O God, sir, here’s a dish I love not! I cannot\n\n0693 270 endure my Lady Tongue.He exits.\n\nPRINCE, ⌜to Beatrice⌝ 0694 Come, lady, come, you have lost\n\n0695 the heart of Signior Benedick.\n\nBEATRICE 0696 Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile, and I\n\n0697 gave him use for it, a double heart for his single\n\n0698 275 one. Marry, once before he won it of me with false\n\n0699 dice. Therefore your Grace may well say I have lost\n\n0700 it.\n\nPRINCE 0701 You have put him down, lady, you have put\n\n0702 him down.\n\nBEATRICE 0703 280So I would not he should do me, my lord,\n\n0704 lest I should prove the mother of fools. I have\n\n0705 brought Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.\n\nPRINCE 0706 Why, how now, count, wherefore are you sad?\n\nCLAUDIO 0707 Not sad, my lord.\n\nPRINCE 0708 285How then, sick?\n\nCLAUDIO 0709 Neither, my lord.\n\nBEATRICE 0710 The Count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry,\n\np. 55\n\n0711 nor well, but civil count, civil as an orange, and\n\n0712 something of that jealous complexion.\n\nPRINCE 0713 290I’ faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true,\n\n0714 though I’ll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is\n\n0715 false.—Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name,\n\n0716 and fair Hero is won. I have broke with her father\n\n0717 and his goodwill obtained. Name the day of marriage,\n\n0718 295 and God give thee joy.\n\nLEONATO 0719 Count, take of me my daughter, and with her\n\n0720 my fortunes. His Grace hath made the match, and\n\n0721 all grace say “Amen” to it.\n\nBEATRICE 0722 Speak, count, ’tis your cue.\n\nCLAUDIO 0723 300Silence is the perfectest herald of joy. I were\n\n0724 but little happy if I could say how much.—Lady, as\n\n0725 you are mine, I am yours. I give away myself for you\n\n0726 and dote upon the exchange.\n\nBEATRICE 0727 Speak, cousin, or, if you cannot, stop his\n\n0728 305 mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither.\n\nPRINCE 0729 In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.\n\nBEATRICE 0730 Yea, my lord. I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on\n\n0731 the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his ear\n\n0732 that he is in her heart.\n\nCLAUDIO 0733 310And so she doth, cousin.\n\nBEATRICE 0734 Good Lord for alliance! Thus goes everyone\n\n0735 to the world but I, and I am sunburnt. I may sit in a\n\n0736 corner and cry “Heigh-ho for a husband!”\n\nPRINCE 0737 Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.\n\nBEATRICE 0738 315I would rather have one of your father’s\n\n0739 getting. Hath your Grace ne’er a brother like you?\n\n0740 Your father got excellent husbands, if a maid could\n\n0741 come by them.\n\nPRINCE 0742 Will you have me, lady?\n\nBEATRICE 0743 320No, my lord, unless I might have another for\n\n0744 working days. Your Grace is too costly to wear\n\n0745 every day. But I beseech your Grace pardon me. I\n\n0746 was born to speak all mirth and no matter.\n\np. 57\n\nPRINCE 0747 Your silence most offends me, and to be merry\n\n0748 325 best becomes you, for out o’ question you were\n\n0749 born in a merry hour.\n\nBEATRICE 0750 No, sure, my lord, my mother cried, but then\n\n0751 there was a star danced, and under that was I\n\n0752 born.—Cousins, God give you joy!\n\nLEONATO 0753 330Niece, will you look to those things I told\n\n0754 you of?\n\nBEATRICE 0755 I cry you mercy, uncle.—By your Grace’s\n\n0756 pardon.Beatrice exits.\n\nPRINCE 0757 By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.\n\nLEONATO 0758 335There’s little of the melancholy element in\n\n0759 her, my lord. She is never sad but when she sleeps,\n\n0760 and not ever sad then, for I have heard my daughter\n\n0761 say she hath often dreamt of unhappiness and\n\n0762 waked herself with laughing.\n\nPRINCE 0763 340She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.\n\nLEONATO 0764 O, by no means. She mocks all her wooers\n\n0765 out of suit.\n\nPRINCE 0766 She were an excellent wife for Benedick.\n\nLEONATO 0767 O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week\n\n0768 345 married, they would talk themselves mad.\n\nPRINCE 0769 County Claudio, when mean you to go to\n\n0770 church?\n\nCLAUDIO 0771 Tomorrow, my lord. Time goes on crutches\n\n0772 till love have all his rites.\n\nLEONATO 0773 350Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence\n\n0774 a just sevennight, and a time too brief, too, to have\n\n0775 all things answer my mind.\n\nPRINCE, ⌜to Claudio⌝ 0776 Come, you shake the head at so\n\n0777 long a breathing, but I warrant thee, Claudio, the\n\n0778 355 time shall not go dully by us. I will in the interim\n\n0779 undertake one of Hercules’ labors, which is to bring\n\n0780 Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a\n\n0781 mountain of affection, th’ one with th’ other. I\n\n0782 would fain have it a match, and I doubt not but to\n\np. 59\n\n0783 360 fashion it, if you three will but minister such\n\n0784 assistance as I shall give you direction.\n\nLEONATO 0785 My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten\n\n0786 nights’ watchings.\n\nCLAUDIO 0787 And I, my lord.\n\nPRINCE 0788 365And you too, gentle Hero?\n\nHERO 0789 I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my\n\n0790 cousin to a good husband.\n\nPRINCE 0791 And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband\n\n0792 that I know. Thus far can I praise him: he is of\n\n0793 370 a noble strain, of approved valor, and confirmed\n\n0794 honesty. I will teach you how to humor your\n\n0795 cousin that she shall fall in love with Benedick.—\n\n0796 And I, with your two helps, will so practice on\n\n0797 Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his\n\n0798 375 queasy stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice.\n\n0799 If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer; his\n\n0800 glory shall be ours, for we are the only love gods. Go\n\n0801 in with me, and I will tell you my drift.\n\n⌜They⌝ exit."
