        "text": "Towing & Payload\n\nIf you’re looking to haul a large camper or a multi-horse trailer, the F-150 is up for the job with a maximum towing capacity of 14,000 pounds. The Silverado 1500 falls slightly behind. It only has a maximum towing capacity of 13,300 pounds.\n\nWhat if you’re looking to leave the trailer at home and just load up the truck bed? The F-150 can carry more there, too. It boasts a maximum payload of 3,250 pounds, while the Silverado 1500 can only carry up to 2,260 pounds. The F-150 goes one step further with available Onboard Scales. They’ll tell you exactly how much you’re hauling.\n\nGo Hybrid\n\nLooking to maximize both power and efficiency? In the Ford F-150 engine lineup, you have the option to select a hybrid motor. The 3.5L PowerBoost™ Full Hybrid V6 pairs a gas engine to an electric motor to provide 430 horsepower and 570 lb-ft of torque. A hybrid option isn’t available with the Silverado.\n\nCreature Comforts\n\nInside the cabins of these trucks, you’ll find luxurious appointments, like available leather-trimmed seats with heating and ventilation. The Ford F-150 also offers available Max Recline Seats that fold nearly all the way down, so you can take a power nap just about anywhere. Active Motion® is also available with the F-150. It provides a gentle massaging that helps reduce fatigue during long rides.\n\nThe Ford F-150 will also help you get stuff done with on the job with its available Interior Work Surface that easily folds out of way when not in use. It’s a perfect place to work on your laptop or fill out paperwork right from your truck's cabin. The Silverado doesn’t offer a similar feature.\n\nRoom to Stretch Out\n\nBoth trucks offer three cab styles that are similar in size. If you choose the F-150 you’ll be able to choose between the Regular Cab, SuperCab, and SuperCrew. The SuperCrew of the F-150 and the Crew Cab of the Silverado both provide over 43 inches of rear legroom, so your team in the back will have all the space they need.\n\nInteractive Infotainment\n\nBoth trucks offer expansive touchscreen displays, so you can take command of your favorite smartphone apps and play all the music you love. You'll be able to keep up with the world around you whether your way off the map or right in the middle of the jobsite thanks to the Wi-Fi hotspot in both models. The difference is: It only comes standard with the Ford F-150.\n\nWhen it comes to picking your desired entertainment, an available 7-speaker Bose® Premium Sound System available with the Chevy Silverado brings each song to life. For a truly immersive musical journey, though, you may want to opt for the more extensive 18-speaker B&O® Unleashed Sound System audio system offered by the Ford F-150.\n\nSmart Safety Features\n\nA blind spot monitoring system is available with both models. It’s there to act as another set of eyes whether you’re towing a trailer or flying solo. It will alert you to a vehicle driving alongside your truck, so you can change lanes with ease. They can also look out for vehicles alongside your trailer with the available trailer tow coverage."
