Powerful. Popular.\n\nThe Falcon 900LX sets the standard in its class for reliability, versatility and fuel economy. Operators appreciate its ideal balance between performance and aircraft size. The latest in the 900 series, it features a refreshed, sleek, fashion-forward interior that is equal parts beauty, comfort and functionality. With more than 500 aircraft in operation, the 900 series is serious business.\n\nDisplay measurements\n\nImperial Metric\n\nYour choice of measurement units will change the display of the following performance characteristics.\n\nMaximum number of passengers 12-14 Range (8 pax, NBAA IFR Reserves) 4,750 nm 8,800 km Maximum Operating Mach Number (MMO) .87 Maximum Certified Altitude 51,000 ft 15,545 m Takeoff Distance (Sea Level, ISA, Max Takeoff Weight) 5,360 ft 1,633 m Landing Distance (Unfactored, Sea Level, ISA, Typical Landing Weight) 2,415 ft 736 m Approach Speed, Vref (Typical Landing Weight) 110 kias 204 km/hr\n\nCabin\n\nMaking business a pleasure\n\nThe Falcon 900LX features a refined cabin that answers the needs of any business traveler. Every detail has been considered to enhance comfort, convenience and connectivity. Advanced acoustic technology makes this the quietest cabin in the 900 series. With three separate lounge areas, passengers can work, relax over a fine meal, then retire to sleep.\n\nDisplay measurements\n\nImperial Metric\n\nYour choice of measurement units will change the display of the following performance characteristics.\n\nCabin Height 74 in 1.88 m Cabin Width 92 in 2.34 m Cabin Length 33.20 ft 10.11 m Cabin Volume 1,264 ft3 35.80 m3 Baggage Volume 127 ft3 3.60 m3\n\nModern comfort for a modern world\n\nQuality craftmanship, quiet comfort\n\nThe Falcon 900LX cabin is replete with delightful design elements. Furnishings are elegant and ergonomic. Cabin management is fingertip simple, with controls smartly positioned in armrests within easy reach. Closely spaced windows let in an abundance of natural light. Advanced acoustical insulation has reduced cabin noise levels to near library-quiet levels.\n\nConnectivity for productivity\n\nYou’re never out of touch in the Falcon 900LX. Owners can opt for Dassault’s FalconConnect™ system for high-speed internet and voice calls. FalconConnect provides a single point of contact for hardware, network installation, troubleshooting and cost management, including ready access to data consumption information through the FalconConnect portal.\n\nLighting for every mood\n\nAn innovative mood lighting system allows passengers to create the perfect environment for work, rest or dining. The LED system produces high-quality white light and a selection of programmable settings for any desired ambiance. All 24 cabin windows are located within the passenger seating area for a bright daylight cabin that everyone can enjoy.\n\nEqual parts style and space\n\nWhere dreamers can recharge\n\nTechnology\n\nLeading edge, fighter spirit\n\nStrong yet light, agile yet smooth, powerful yet efficient. Many of the 900LX’s attributes are from technology developed for Dassault’s military programs. Like any good fighter jet, its design assures pilots precise and responsive aerodynamic feedback and large safety margins. And like all Falcons, the 900LX is compatible with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).\n\nAdvanced avionics for easy flying\n\nThe Falcon 9000LX has the most intuitive man-machine interface in business aviation. The EASy flight deck is a smart, integrated, feature-packed avionics system designed for teamwork. It’s the benchmark for situational awareness and better flight planning. Flight controls are ultra-smooth and responsive for easy hand-flying, passenger safety and comfort.\n\nThe all-seeing falconeye\n\nThe 900LX flight deck can be configured with Dassault’s award-winning Combined Vision System, FalconEye®, which provides flight crews unprecedented situational awareness in all weather conditions, day or night. It adds a significant margin of safety for all airport operations, especially at airfields with difficult terrain. FalconEye provides guidance on approaches down to 100 feet before the runway is sighted.\n\nA wing that goes even further\n\nWhile efficient at high speeds, the 900LX wing is equally adept at low speeds, which accounts for its impressive short-field performance and safer approaches. The leading-edge slats and double-slotted flaps of the sophisticated wing give the 900LX greater airport access than its competitors and more choices for the owner. Winglets further reduce drag to boost efficiency.\n\nThe power of efficiency\n\nThe Falcon 900LX is powered by three Honeywell TFE731-60 engines. Reliable and time-tested, these engines deliver more power with lower fuel consumption and require less maintenance.\n\nPowerful and proven\n\nEach of the engines that power the 900LX produces 5,000 pounds (22.25 kN) of thrust at sea level up to ISA +17°C and provides unbeatable efficiency in this power range, along with a reputation for low fuel consumption and quiet operation. With more than 11,000 engines entered into service and 100 million hours of operation logged, the reliability and fuel-efficient performance of the TFE731 series are well proven.\n\nPowerful and proven\n\nEach of the engines that power the 900LX produces 5,000 pounds (22.25 kN) of thrust at sea level up to ISA+17°C and provides unbeatable efficiency in its range, lower fuel consumption and quiet operation.

At Mach .80, it can take you from Geneva to Chicago, Mumbai to London City or Hong Kong to Sydney, nonstop, consuming far less fuel than its competitors. In addition to airfield agility, the three-engine 900LX allows more direct, over-water routing, an advantage that saves time and fuel while enhancing safety.\n\nDeparture List\n\nYour choice in the departure list will change how the aircraft range is displayed on the map.\n\nYour choice will change the content displayed.\n\nDeparture city\n\nPerformance and flexibility\n\nThe 900LX’s high maximum landing weight to maximum takeoff weight ratio allows short hops followed by transoceanic leaps without refueling. For example, fly from Washington, D.C. to Geneva, with a quick stop in New York. Or fly six passengers from Paris to London, then on to New York, with fuel to spare. You save time and money, avoiding the need to buy more costly fuel away from home.\n\nThe world is your headquarters\n\nWith High-Mach blended winglets extending its range to 4,750 nm (8,800 km), the 900LX crosses any ocean or continent, and sometimes both, traveling routes like London to Seattle with nonstop ease. It will fly you from Chicago to Geneva or just about anywhere on nearly one-third less fuel than its nearest competitor.\n\nChallenging fields and conditions\n\nFueled for a 3,000 nm (5,556 km) trip, the Falcon 900LX can depart runways of less than 4,000 feet (1,219 m) at sea level and less than 5,000 feet (1,524 m) in Denver-like settings a mile above sea level. It also gives you access to challenging airports, such as London City, Aspen, St. Moritz, Gstaad and Toluca. Hot or high, or both, the 900LX delivers ample range.\n\nSpecifications\n\nEvery inch a legend\n\nTrijet design largely accounts for the distinctive ramp appeal of the Falcon 900LX. But the beauty of this proven performer runs through every aspect of its rugged airframe, advanced aerodynamics, cutting-edge avionics and time-tested systems, updated for today’s environment.\n\nDisplay measurements\n\nImperial Metric\n\nYour choice of measurement units will change the display of the following performance characteristics.\n\nMaximum number of passengers 12-14 Range (8 pax, NBAA IFR Reserves) 4,750 nm 8,800 km Maximum Operating Mach Number (MMO) .87 Maximum Certified Altitude 51,000 ft 15,545 m Takeoff Distance (Sea Level, ISA, Max Takeoff Weight) 5,360 ft 1,633 m Landing Distance (Unfactored, Sea Level, ISA, Typical Landing Weight) 2,415 ft 736 m Approach Speed, Vref (Typical Landing Weight) 110 kias 204 km/hr\n\nEngines 3 Honeywell TFE731-60 Engine Thrust-SL/ISA 5,000 lb 22.25 kN Avionics EASy II Flight Deck (with Honeywell Primus Epic System)\n\nWingspan 70.17 ft 21.38 m Length 66.31 ft 20.21 m Height 25.17 ft 7.67 m\n\nCabin Height 74 in 1.88 m Cabin Width 92 in 2.34 m Cabin Length 33.20 ft 10.11 m Cabin Volume 1,264 ft3 35.80 m3 Baggage Volume 127 ft3 3.60 m3\n\nMaximum Takeoff Weight 49,000 lb 22,225 kg Maximum Landing Weight 44,500 lb 20,185 kg Maximum Fuel Weight 20,905 lb 9,482 kg Maximum Zero Fuel Weight 30,864 lb 14,000 kg\n\nSupport\n\nAlways at the ready\n\nThe Falcon 900LX comes with a worldwide support network, including FalconResponse™, a suite of Aircraft On Ground (AOG) services committed to quickly returning a grounded Falcon back into operation.
