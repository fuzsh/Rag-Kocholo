        "text": "Remember when Kim Kardashian‚Äôs shapewear brand Skims casually dropped a campaign with Sabrina Carpenter and the internet spiraled due to the musician‚Äôs close friendship with Taylor Swift? Like, spiraled to the point where people were speculating that Sabrina had asked Tay for ‚Äúpermission‚Äù to do the campaign? About that... üëÄ\n\nDuring a convo with Variety about Tay (who she called a ‚Äúrock star‚Äù), Sabrina said, ‚ÄúThe posts about me having to ‚Äòask for her permission‚Äô...no. She‚Äôs one of my best, best friends, and we grab dinner or text and catch up like you would with your best friend.‚Äù\n\nThis echoes comments the celeb previously made to Rolling Stone about the Skims campaign. Ahem: ‚ÄúIn that scenario, I‚Äôve been very, very communicative with [Taylor] about that situation, and I just love her so much and support her till the end.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo it was no weirdness for me, but I know people will just say things because that‚Äôs all they have time to do,‚Äù the ‚ÄúEspresso‚Äù singer added.\n\nOh, and Sabrina *also* told Variety the following about getting advice from Taylor: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so cool for me to get a perspective on this whole process from her and the community of artists that I feel I‚Äôm close to‚Äîto get advice from them on stuff that you can‚Äôt just ask the internet. We‚Äôre always playing each other our [music], and whenever I start to think, Maybe I‚Äôll get on Twitter and say something about this, I‚Äôm always like, Maybe I‚Äôll write a song instead.‚Äù\n\nObsessed with their friendship!"
