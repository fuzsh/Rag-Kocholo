        "text": "Lieberum: To me, that whole album (1999) is the first album that sounds like Prince and no one else. That song is maybe the most unique song on the entire album. It’s beautiful and funky and weird.\n\nRudolph: I have to agree with you on that. I might have been a tween (when it dropped) and was just starting to see darkness and light sometimes as one, and that song was very moving to me at that time.\n\nListen here.\n\nLieberum: For me, personally, that was my gateway drug to Prince. I remember where I was when I heard it the first time. I was sitting in a car in a parking lot of the supermarket while my mom was grocery shopping. It came on the radio and it just knocked my socks off. “What the hell is this?”\n\nRudolph: Your mom came in and was like, “where are your socks?”\n\nLieberum: “Mommy, they’re gone. They’re knocked off.” It’s another song that sounds like nothing else.\n\nRudolph: That was a time in the world where because of MTV and the (Purple Rain) movie, that song was such a big deal and such an exciting combination of footage from the movie. (Before then) you’d have to go back into the theater to see it, but this was like a montage of clips from the movie and this cool dance from a cool band. I have so much nostalgia for the time when music and MTV and the movies were combined. It was a beautiful explosion.\n\nWatch here.\n\nRudolph: I’ve always been a huge fan of the 12-inch of “Raspberry Beret” because there’s a secret sauce in it that gets me every time. It’s a song that you love that encapsulates the Around the World in a Day album, and now that Prince is a part of your life, it takes this melancholic turn with orchestral strings that I’m a very big fan of.\n\nLieberum: It was a radio hit and you think, “oh, it’s a Prince pop song,” but when you really listen to it, it’s really a beautiful song. Spike Lee used it in the show he did of She’s Gotta Have It. He did a whole Prince episode that’s kind of amazing.\n\nListen here.\n\nLieberum: Here’s a lighter one. It’s one of the songs that makes me so joyful and happy. That album (Parade) is a culmination of the influence of Wendy & Lisa on him. Maya and I had the pleasure of getting to know Wendy & Lisa in real life — they were our idols as kids — and then we got to know them as human beings. They shared with us how much writing they did on that album and that song in particular.\n\nRudolph: We even got to perform it with Wendy & Lisa. There’s a sound that they brought to his songwriting and brought out of him which is so deeply rooted in my love for music.\n\nListen here.\n\nLieberum: That one is incredible. I heard that one a month after he passed away in a yoga class. The teacher put it on and I just started crying in the middle of class.\n\nRudolph: I had a weird experience with it. An old, good friend sent me an email in the middle of the night, saying, “listening to Prince and thinking of you,” and then I woke up, saw it and I was like, “oh no, I hope Prince isn’t dead.” And I listened to the song and it was really moving. And then hours later, I found out he was dead.\n\nListen here.\n\nRudolph: My first album I fell in love with was Dirty Mind, and I still to this day feel like “Sexuality” is one of the greatest.\n\nLieberum: That’s got great lyrics too, especially in this day and age.\n\nRudolph: His very early stuff, when he was politically vocal, when we it play today it feels just as powerful. He was clearly so aware of the injustices going on, and they’re still alive today. That stuff is exciting to play live.\n\nListen here.\n\nLieberum: I do love “Controversy,” I think that song is more valid now than ever, lyric-wise. It’s a song that lures in non-fans. And I love performing it in this political climate.\n\nRudolph: I feel that way about “Erotic City” in terms of blowing people’s minds. It reminds me of dancing with a boy at a bar mitzvah and it’s such a f–king banger to this day. It never ceases to bang. It does slap, quite hard, to this day."
