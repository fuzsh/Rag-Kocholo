        "text": "From the cast to the plot, here’s what we know so far about 'A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms'\n\nJust as House of the Dragon season 2 came to a close, fans of the Game of Thrones franchise got a glimpse of the upcoming prequel series, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight.\n\nA first look of the Game of Thrones spinoff was shown among promos of other highly-anticipated new series, such as Dune and The Penguin, as well as returns of fan favorites, like The Last of Us and The White Lotus, in a Max coming soon reel in August 2024.\n\nThe short promo features Peter Claffey introducing himself as Ser Duncan the Tall, with snippets of sword fighting and a familiar-looking Game of Thrones landscape.\n\nRelated: Game of Thrones: All the Spinoffs in the Works and What We Know So Far\n\nBased on George R.R. Martin's Tales of Dunk and Egg novellas, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms will adapt the first of the series, The Hedge Knight, into six episodes. The latest prequel is set to be released in 2025.\n\nTaking place in between the events of House of the Dragon and Game of Thrones, Tales of Dunk and Egg concerns the \"small folk who suffer at the hands of the game of thrones as it's played by the nobles,\" executive producer Ryan Condal told Entertainment Weekly in May 2024.\n\nHere’s everything we know so far about the upcoming Game of Thrones spinoff, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nWhat is A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms about?\n\nBased on the novella by Martin, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms takes place a century before the events of Game of Thrones and centers on “a young, naïve but courageous knight, Ser Duncan the Tall, and his diminutive squire, Egg,” per the official HBO description.\n\nThe longline continues, “Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne, and the memory of the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes, and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends.”\n\nIn Martin’s novella, the story begins when Dunk, a squire, takes the possessions of a deceased knight and heads to Ashford to compete in a tournament as \"Ser Duncan the Tall.\"\n\nAccompanied by a young boy named \"Egg,\" who becomes his squire, Dunk also encounters a love interest, Tanselle. When Prince Aerion Targaryen (second son of Prince Maekar Targaryen and Lady Dyanna Dayne) — attacks Tanselle, Dunk intervenes, sparking a series of misadventures.\n\nWhile Martin is heavily involved in the project as a writer and executive producer, it’s not clear how much of the show will lend itself to the original narrative or expand beyond the pages.\n\n“A novella is considerably shorter than a novel (particularly one of my novels), so there’s less source material,” Martin wrote on his blog in June 2024.\n\nThe Hedge Knight is 164 pages, which, compared to Martin’s other novels that range between 700 to 1,000 pages, is a relatively short read.\n\nWhat are the Tales of Dunk and Egg novellas about?\n\nTales of Dunk and Egg is a series of fantasy novellas by Martin set in the same world as his A Song of Ice and Fire novels, which inspired the Game of Thrones series.\n\nThe stories take place about 90 years before the main events of the series and follow Dunk, the future Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, Ser Duncan the Tall and Egg, the future King Aegon V Targaryen.\n\nThe novellas explore the history of Westeros, providing a rich backstory to the Game of Thrones universe, detailing the lives and lineage of significant characters before the events of the main series.\n\nWhen will A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms be released?\n\nNo official date has been set, but A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is expected to be released sometime in 2025.\n\nIs there a trailer for A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms?\n\nWhile an official trailer for A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms has yet to be released, a first look was nestled between other new and returning series on Max for 2024-2025.\n\nThe promo showcases Dunk (Claffey) in his armor, introducing himself as “Ser Duncan the Tall” and Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell) by a fire.\n\nWho is in the cast of A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms?\n\nAs of right now, the cast of A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms will consist of:\n\nPeter Claffey as Dunk\n\nDexter Sol Ansell as Egg\n\nFinn Bennett as Aerion Targaryen, second son of Prince Maekar Targaryen and Lady Dyanna Dayne, nephew of Baelor Targaryen and major source of conflict for Dunk\n\nDaniel Ings as Ser Lyonel Baratheon, heir to Storm’s End during the reign of Daeron II\n\nSam Spruell as Maekar Targaryen, father of Aerion\n\nBertie Carvel as Baelor Targaryen, brother of Maekar and firstborn son and heir of King Daeron II Targaryen\n\nTanzyn Crawford as Tanselle, a young puppeteer and love interest of Dunk\n\nEdward Ashley as Ser Steffon Fossoway, a knight\n\nHenry Ashton as Daeron Targaryen, a prince of the Targaryen dynasty\n\nYoussef Kerkour as Steely Pate, a blacksmith\n\nDaniel Monks as Ser Manfred Dondarrion, a knight\n\nShaun Thomas as Raymun Fossoway, cousin and squire of Steffon\n\nTom Vaughan-Lawlor as Plummer, steward of Ashford\n\nDanny Webb as Ser Arlan of Pennytree, the knight that Dunk steals the possessions of after his death\n\nWho is directing A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms?\n\nSarah Adina Smith, known for her work on Lessons in Chemistry and Hanna, will helm three of the six episodes as director. Owen Harris, who has worked on the acclaimed dystopian Netflix series Black Mirror, will also direct three episodes and executive produce the series, per HBO.\n\nThe series will have Martin as a writer and executive producer, alongside other franchise veterans, such as Condal, Ira Parker, Vince Gerardis and My Lady Jane producer Sarah Bradshaw joining the team.\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly in May 2024, Condal said that he pitched the idea to adapt Dunk and Egg years ago before he went on to co-create House of the Dragon with Martin.\n\n\"When HBO was looking to do spinoffs for the original series — this is now like eight years ago — word got around that I was a bit of a fan,\" he said. \"They had me in and I passionately pitched them on doing Dunk and Egg for this reason.\"\n\nWhile the network at the time wanted something \"much bigger and crazier and more expensive” (enter: House of the Dragon), early development of A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms began in 2021, first reported by Variety.\n\n“I think fans are going to be rewarded with another great series in the greater A Song of Ice and Fire,\" Condal told Entertainment Weekly.\n\nWhere can I watch A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms?\n\nA Knight of the Seven Kingdoms will be released on Max in 2025, where fans can catch up on Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon in the meantime.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
