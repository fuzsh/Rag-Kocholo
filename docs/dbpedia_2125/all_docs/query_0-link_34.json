        "text": "Prince Biography\n\nPrince Rogers Nelson was a multi-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter from the United States. He was recognized for his colorful, androgynous appearance and vast vocal range, which included a far-reaching falsetto and high-pitched screams. He was widely regarded as one of the best musicians of his period. Prince created the Minneapolis sound by producing his own records. His music was influenced by funk, R&amp;B, rock, new wave, soul, synth-pop, pop, jazz, and hip hop, among other genres. On his albums, he frequently performed all or most of the instruments.\n\nPrince was born on June 7, 1958, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. When Prince was seven years old, he wrote his first song, “Funk Machine,” on his father’s piano. Prince went to Bryant Junior High and then Central High School in Minneapolis, where he participated in football, basketball, and baseball. He was a member of Central’s junior varsity basketball team and still enjoys playing hoops as an adult. He received classical ballet training at the Minnesota Dance Theater as part of the Minneapolis Public Schools’ Urban Arts Program while at Bryant. He came to be a champion for dancers, and in the 1990s, he used his fortune to salvage the struggling Joffrey Ballet in Chicago. In 1973, he met and impressed songwriter and producer Jimmy Jam with his musical talent, early knowledge of a wide range of instruments, and work ethic.\n\nAt the age of nineteen, Prince obtained a record deal with Warner Bros. Records and released the albums For You (1978) and Prince (1979). With the groundbreaking albums Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999, he went on to garner critical acclaim (1982). Purple Rain (1984), his sixth album, was recorded with the Revolution, his backup band, and served as the music to his feature acting debut of the same name. Purple Rain was a critical and commercial success for Prince, spending six months at the top of the Billboard 200 chart. The Academy Award for Best Original Song Score went to Prince. Prince’s greatest opus, Sign o’ the Times (1987), was universally lauded by reviewers after the Revolution was disbanded. In 1993, he changed his stage name to the unpronounceable sign in the midst of a contract dispute with Warner Bros (known to fans as the “Love Symbol”), and was often referred to as the Artist Formerly Known as Prince (or TAFKAP) and simply the Artist.\n\nIn 1998, the Artist signed with Arista Records, and in 2000, he resumed using the name Prince. Over the next decade, he had six top ten albums in the United States. Prince died of an accidental fentanyl overdose at his Paisley Park home and music studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota, in April 2016, at the age of 57. Prince had a prolific output, producing 39 albums during his lifetime and leaving a large array of unpublished projects, including entire albums and over 50 music videos, in a vault at his house following his death. Throughout his life, he recorded songs under many aliases, as well as writing songs that were covered by other artists, such as “Nothing Compares 2 U” and “Manic Monday.” The total number of songs written by Prince is estimated to be anywhere between 500 and over 1,000. His demo CDs Piano with a Microphone 1983 (2018) and Originals (2019) were both critically acclaimed after his death.\n\nPrince is one of the best-selling musicians of all time, having sold over 150 million records worldwide. The Grammy President’s Merit Award, the American Music Awards for Achievement and Merit, the Billboard Icon Award, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award were among the honors bestowed upon him. In 2004, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the UK Music Hall of Fame, the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, and the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame. In 2016, he was inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2022.\n\nPrince Discography\n\nTop Videos\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat Was Prince’S Biggest Hit?\n\n“Purple Rain” is Prince’s biggest hit.
