        "text": "NPG Records And Paisley Park Enterprises Release Rare Prince B-Side “United States Of Division” To Celebrate The 20th Anniversary Of Prince’s 2004 Album Musicology\n\nMakes Long-Awaited Debut On Digital Streaming Services\n\nStream “United States Of Division” HERE\n\nPrince’s Grammy winning twenty-eighth studio album Musicology received rave reviews from critics and fans alike when it was released nearly 20 years ago, and with its revolutionary direct-to-fan marketing strategy, effectively changed music promotion forever.\n\nToday, to commemorate 2 decades of Musicology, NPG Records and Paisley Park Enterprises, in partnership with Sony Music Entertainment, have released “United States Of Division,” a rare 2004 Prince recording that was initially offered as a virtual B-side download for “Cinnamon Girl” exclusively from Prince’s NPG Music Club and eventually as a non-LP bonus track for the UK CD single of “Cinnamon Girl,” but has not been distributed via streaming services until now.\n\n“United States Of Division” is a powerful protest song that sees Prince boldly confronting the social and political issues that continue to plague the nation to this day. Over a percussive backbeat and slinking bassline colored by synths and horn stabs, Prince laments the state of a fractured nation: “How far from heaven must we go? / Before the winds of change will blow and show / This world how it’s supposed to be / Land of peace and harmony.” Released in the midst of the USwar in Iraq, “United States Of Division” serves as a potent reminder of Prince’s often underappreciated passion for social commentary.\n\nStream “United States Of Division” HERE\n\nThe new spotlight on this song also celebrates the 20th anniversary of Prince’s landmark Musicology Live 2004ever tour, a remarkable run of shows that saw the trendsetting star distributing copies of his most recent album Musicology to thousands of concert attendees along the tour route. On Prince’s request, the tour featured reasonable ticket prices that encouraged fans young and old to attend shows. Devised by Prince and his longtime lawyer, confidante, and Musicology Executive Producer L. Londell McMillan this grassroots approach to album marketing profoundly changed that way the music industry viewed live performances and once again cemented Prince’s status as one of modern music’s great creative visionaries.\n\nSpeaking about this era of Prince’s career, McMillan noted: “Some called it his comeback, Prince called it Musicology. The brilliance of this classic album was coupled with the commercial success executed on his tour with ticket sales, resulting in Prince’s highest chart position since the 80s. Prince was simply awesome and the music world owes him a great debt for his creativity and innovation.“\n\nIn an archival interview clip from the Musicology era, Prince described how his creative process had changed at this stage in his career: “This record…remember it’s made by someone who’s been there and back. Hopefully people feel that and listen to it with that set of ears. Music is music ultimately. If it makes you feel good? Cool.”\n\nWatch the interview clip, along with 2004 Musicology tour performance footage HERE\n\nAlso approaching its 20th anniversary on April 20th, Musicology was praised by Rolling Stone for “its sinuous grooves and effortless swing” and earned Prince two Grammy awards in addition to being certified double platinum by the RIAA in 2005. The album came at the peak of Prince’s early 2000s resurgence, practically coinciding with his induction into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame where he performed his now iconic guitar solo on an all-star rendition of The Beatles classic, “While My Guitar Gently Weeps.” He also notably dueted with Beyoncé weeks earlier during that year’s Grammy Awards ceremony, while the Musicology tour itself was Prince’s highest-grossing US tour of his career and one of the most successful US tours of the year, performing for over 1.4 million fans.\n\nTo celebrate the legendary album’s 20th anniversary, there was a party at Prince’s Paisley Park Studios in Chanhassen, Minnesota on March 29th. The community event featured screenings of live performance footage from the 2004 tour, a DJ’d dance party, and food and beverages.\n\nAbout Prince\n\nPrince was an iconic American musician, singer, songwriter, bandleader, performer, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, actor, and a pioneer in artists’ rights and freedoms. Born Prince Rogers Nelson in Minneapolis, Minnesota, he released his debut LP For You in 1978 and went on to become one of the most successful recording artists of all time, eventually selling more than 150 million albums. Over his 40-year career, his work received unprecedented critical praise as well as official recognition of his achievements including seven Grammy Awards, seven Brit Awards, six American Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, a Grammy President’s Merit Award, a Billboard Icon Award, a Golden Globe, and an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the film Purple Rain). His albums, 1999 (1982), Purple Rain (1984), and Sign O’ The Times (1987) frequently appear in rankings of the greatest albums of all time. He was inducted into the Grammy Hall Of Fame, the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame, the U.K. Music Hall Of Fame, and the Rhythm And Blues Music Hall Of Fame, and was twice inducted into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk Of Fame.\n\nPrince was a leader in philanthropy, giving privately and without fanfare to countless charities and causes that he championed and a trailblazer in fashion, art, music and practically all forms of entertainment. Prince is considered by many to be the greatest of all time.\n\nAbout Musicology\n\n“Being an independent artist, I can speak on any issue that moves me without worry of censorship in any way. The sound you hear in Musicology is the sound of that freedom.”\n\n—Prince\n\nMusicology is the 28th studio album by Prince and was first released on March 29th, 2004 (appearing in stores in the UK on April 19, 2004, and in the US the following day). A major critical and commercial achievement, Musicology proved to be Prince’s most successful album in years, reaching #3 on the Billboard Top 200 while charting in the top 10 in many other countries, and winning two Grammy Awards. Highly influenced by the R&B and funk of Prince’s youth, Musicology was centered around the theme of providing a “musical education” to listeners.\n\n“I was listening to a lot of masters at the time,” reflected Prince. “The Motown sound, James Brown, Sly Stone… and I studied them. I studied the way they put their sounds together. And what I hope is that young musicians today will listen to how I put my sounds together on this record.”\n\nThe hugely successful Musicology Live 2004ever tour featured affordable tickets and a direct-to-fan marketing arrangement that provided each concertgoer with a copy of the CD. Celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2024, Musicology continues to delight and surprise both new listeners and longtime Prince fans with every listen."
