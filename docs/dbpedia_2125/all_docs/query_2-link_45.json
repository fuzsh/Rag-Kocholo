        "text": "Estimate the Cost of\n\nYour License\n\nStart planning your production with a cost estimate you can save and share with your team. Just answer a few questions.\n\nThis estimator is only for non-Equity/amateur productions. Equity/professional customers should contact the Licensing department directly at [email protected].\n\nImportant:\n\nThe cost quoted is an estimate only and may differ when you apply for a license.\n\nPRINCIPALS\n\nELLA – Though no one notices her beneath her rags and quiet demeanor, she is op inionated, charismatic, passionate, beautiful, and funny. Idealistic and hopeful, she courageously challenges the prince to change the policies in his kingdom – and helps him discover who he truly is. Always her late father’s daughter, she is determined to see the good in everyone despite her hardships and suffering. We see her blossom into a confident woman.\n\nTOPHER – A misguided and lost prince who longs to do something important with his life. Though brave and heroic, he feels lonely and unfulfilled. Charming but NOT a stereotypical ladies man, he is thoughtful, appealing, and innocent – with an unforced goofy streak. Moral, genuine, and kindhearted, he is at a crossroads and must take control of his kingdom and his future.\n\nMADAME – Ella’s selfish stepmother. The epitome of vanity and fashion. A ravenous social climber who values wealth, status, and material possessions above all else. Unapologetically dismissive and sometimes cruel, Madame schemes her way up the social ladder.\n\nSEBASTIAN – The kingdom’s Lord Chancellor. Though he is Topher’s trusted advisor, he is devious and selfish. Using propaganda and dishonesty, he keeps Topher isolated and in the dark about his kingdom. Sebastian rules without regard for the lower class, or anyone other than himself – and truly believes he deserves to rule the kingdom.\n\nMARIE – A friend to Ella and the town’s resident crazy lady and beggar woman, Marie is actually a fairy godmother in disguise. Wise, warm, otherworldly, and charming, Marie rewards Ella for her kindness by making her dreams a possibility.\n\nGABRIELLE – Ella’s stepsister and daughter of Madame. Encouraged by her mother and sister to value material wealth and social status, she unenthusiastically joins them in their abrasive behavior. Quietly passionate, empathetic, and witty, she is drawn to Ella and Jean-Michel. Ironically aware that she doesn’t fit in.\n\nCHARLOTTE – Ella’s stepsister and daughter of Madame. Brash, self-centered, materialistic, snooty, loud, sassy, and bratty, she has a ridiculously high, but unfounded, opinion of herself. She never passes up an opportunity to be the center of attention.\n\nJEAN-MICHEL – A feisty, passionate peasant determined to make a change for the starving class. Impetuous. A firebrand, but lacks authority and isn’t taken seriously as a revolutionary. Has a crush on Gabrielle, though their courtship is forbidden because they are from different social classes.\n\nLORD PINKLETON – The Lord Chancellor’s right-hand man. Announces royal balls, banquets, and even the weather to the villagers.\n\nENSEMBLE\n\nGiant, Fox (Puppet), Raccoon (Puppet), Footman, Coachman, Knights, Peasants, Serfs, Townspeople, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Court, Servants, etc.\n\nNOTE: In this show, the race of the characters is not pivotal to the plot. We encourage you to consider diversity and inclusion in your casting choices.\n\nAct I\n\n“Overture” – Orchestra\n\n1. “Prologue” – Ella & Chorus\n\n1a. “Battle with the Giant” – Orchestra\n\n2. “Me, Who Am I?” – Topher, Sebastian, Lord Pinkleton, Knights & Pageboys\n\n2a. “Cinderella Enters” – Orchestra\n\n2b. “Topher Rides Off” – Orchestra\n\n3. “Parade of Purchases (Cinderella March) – Orchestra\n\n4. “In My Own Little Corner” – Ella\n\n4a. “In My Own Little Corner Tag/Your Majesty” – Ella, Lord Pinkleton & Topher\n\n5. “The Prince Is Giving A Ball / Now Is The Time” – Sebastian & Jean-Michel\n\n5a. “Fol-De-Rol (Scene Change)” – Marie\n\n5b. “Venetian Glass” – Orchestra\n\n6. “Off to the Ball (Cinderella March)” – Madame, Gabrielle & Charlotte\n\n7. “In My Own Little Corner (Reprise)/Fol-De-Rol” – Ella & Marie\n\n8. “Impossible” – Marie & Ella\n\n8a. “Transformations” – Orchestra\n\n8b. “It’s Possible” – Ella, Marie & Chorus\n\n8c. “Into the Palace” – Orchestra\n\n9. “Gavotte” – Orchestra\n\n10. “Ridicule” – Lord Pinkleton & All\n\n10a. “Kindness” – Orchestra\n\n11. “Ten Minutes Ago” – Topher & Ella\n\n12. “Waltz for a Ball” – Orchestra\n\n13. “Ten Minutes Ago (Reprise)” – Ella\n\n13a.
