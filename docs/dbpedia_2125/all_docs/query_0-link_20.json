        "text": "''Purple Rain,'' which introduces Prince, the rising young rock performer, to theatrical films, is probably the flashiest album cover ever to be released as a movie. However, like many album covers, ''Purple Rain,'' though sometimes arresting to look at, is a cardboard come-on to the record it contains.\n\nPrince's soundtrack recording has already become one of the summer's big sellers, while the almost confessional single, ''When Doves Cry,'' is at the top of the charts. The movie, which opens today at the Criterion and other theaters, may also become a hit, but it's of a different caliber entirely.\n\nHere is a narrative film with music, shot and edited in the jazzily manic, staccato style favored by every rock documentary since ''Woodstock,'' at the center of which there is the small, slight, somewhat nervous figure of Prince himself. When performing onstage, as he is in much of the film, whether photographed frontally, in profile or silhouetted against a manmade aurora borealis, he can be a riveting spectacle. Off the stage, his screen presence is a pale reflection of the dynamic recording personality.\n\nWith his mass of carefully tended, black curly locks and his large, dark doe eyes, he looks, in repose, like a poster of Liza Minnelli on which someone has lightly smudged a mustache. When astride his large motorcycle, as he is from time to time, the image suggests one of Jim Henson's special effects from a Muppets movie: Kermit the Frog on a Harley- Davidson. In the depths of depression, pacing back and forth in his dressing room, he expresses all the pent-up rage of a caged mouse.\n\nThe screenplay, written by Albert Magnoli, the director, and William Blinn, and reported to contain certain autobiographical elements, focuses on the public and private torments of the Kid (Prince), a Minneapolis rocker on the rise. He's a driving young singer obsessed with getting to the top and away from his black father (Clarence Brown 3d), an alcoholic, wife-beating former musician, and his mother, played by the Greek actress Olga Karlatos, another show-biz dropout, who drinks along with dad, whom she can't quite bring herself to leave.\n\nAlso figuring in the story, which, without the music, would simply be another fantasy about teen-age angst, are Apollonia (Apollonia Kotero), a strikingly beautiful young woman, who not only is a singer but also understands the Kid's need for love; Morris (Morris Day), a cheerfully lecherous, outrageously vain, zoot- suited rock performer, who lusts after stardom and Apollonia, and other members of such Minneapolis groups as Prince's Revolution, Mr. Morris's Time and Miss Kotero's Apollonia 6.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
