        "text": "The Phantom of the Opera is one of the West End's greatest musicals of all time. Millions of theatregoers have travelled from around the world to visit His Majesty's Theatre and hear the angel of music for themselves.\n\nAs the Phantom hides his face, he tries to impress Christine, a beautiful soprano. But when a childhood sweetheart appears on the scenes, the Phantom whisks Christine away to his underground lair and chances of a happily ever after are shattered. Can the Phantom prove himself to Christine? You'll have to watch The Phantom of the Opera. Here's our complete guide to the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical The Phantom of the Opera.\n\nBook The Phantom of the Opera tickets on London Theatre.\n\nWhat is Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera about?\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera is inspired by Gaston Leroux's 1909 novel of the same name. Whisking audiences away to the lavish and luxurious lifestyle of Parisian opera, we meet a half-masked Phantom who grows obsessed with young soprano, Christine Daae. As he teaches her, so too does Christine's infatuation with the Phantom grow. But, just as the angel of music is in the palm of his hands, Raoul, Vicomte de Chagny, enters the scene.\n\nChallenging the Phantom for her affections, Christine is eventually kept hostage in an underground lair. Forced to live below the Paris Opera House, she eventually goes on to star as the lead role in an opera. But, as she takes her curtain call, an epic disaster brings down the house, quite literally.\n\nShe's forever haunted by the Phantom, but can Christine escape a potentially fatal situation? You'll have to watch The Phantom of the Opera at His Majesty's Theatre to find out.\n\nWhen did Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera premiere?\n\nEarly conversations about The Phantom of the Opera started in 1984, when Andrew Lloyd Webber proposed a romantic musical to producer Cameron Mackintosh. Webber knew he wanted to bring the Phantom, Christine, and Raoul to life, but was unsure of how the story could translate to the stage. After watching earlier film adaptations, Webber and Mackintosh decided where their inspiration would come from — the Gaston Leroux novel.\n\nWorking with Richard Stilgoe on the book and Charles Hart for the lyrics, Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera was coming to life. Just a year after those first conversations, the world premiere took place at Webber's home in Sydmonton in 1985. The show starred Colm Wilkinson as the Phantom, Sarah Brightman as Kristin (now Christine) and Clive Carter as Raoul. Evidently, first previews went down a storm, as the musical would head to the West End soon after.\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera began previews at Her Majesty's Theatre on 27 Sept. 1986, with an official opening night on 9 Oct. 1986. It's rumoured that Webber was so nervous about audience reception that he didn't watch the opening night! The West End production has been staged with the same set ever since, but in 2020, it was announced the show would return with a brand new production of the original design in a refurbished Her Majesty's.\n\nCharacters in Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera\n\nSome of musical theatre's beloved characters feature in The Phantom of the Opera. Find out more about the main characters in the musical, as well as supporting roles in the show below.\n\nThe Phantom: Born with a facial deformity, he's often hiding himself from others, hence his mask wearing. In the original novel, the Phantom wears a full-face mask, but in order to make his facial expressions easier to see on stage, artistic licence means the mask only covers half his face. His bitter jealousy is apparent when he suddenly appears on stage, duetting alongside his protegee Christine Daae. Even if his way of expressing love isn't conventional, the Phantom does care for others a great deal.\n\nChristine Daae: At just 20 years old, Christine's already formed an impressive career for herself. Chosen to replace Carlotta as the Paris Opera House's primadonna, her heavenly voice and poise means she's an object of affection. Although Christine is a fictional character, it's suggested that she's based on Swedish soprano Christina Nilsson.\n\nViscount Raoul de Chagny: Raoul was friends with Christine. He's later reunited with her when they're both at Paris Opera House. He'll go to all ends of the earth to ensure her happiness, even if he's taunted by the Phantom.\n\nOther characters in The Phantom of the Opera include Carlotta Giudicelli, Monsieur Gilles Andre, Monsieur Richard Firmin, Richard Giry, Meg Giry, Ubaldo Piangi.\n\nWho stars in The Phantom of the Opera in London?\n\nJon Robyns plays the Phantom.
