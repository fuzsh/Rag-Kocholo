        "text": "A Sadler’s Wells & Universal Music UK production with ZooNation: The Kate Prince Company\n\nChoose life, choose love, choose hope.\n\nThe peaceful village of Bebko is alive with joyous celebrations. Suddenly, under attack, everything changes forever. Three siblings, Leto, Mati and Tana, must embark on perilous journeys in order to survive.\n\nFollowing the critically acclaimed premiere in 2020, Message In A Bottle is the latest spectacular dance-theatre show from triple-Olivier Award nominee, Kate Prince. Set to the iconic hits of 17-time Grammy Award-winning artist Sting, the soundtrack includes Every Breath You Take, Roxanne, Walking On The Moon and more. With a mix of exhilarating dance styles, high-energy footwork and breath-taking athleticism, Message In A Bottle tells a unifying and uplifting story of humanity and hope.\n\nMessage In A Bottle is the latest masterpiece from the ground-breaking creator behind West End hits Some Like it Hip Hop, Into the Hoods, Everybody’s Talking About Jamie (choreography) and SYLVIA (Old Vic), and features the astonishing talents of dance storytelling powerhouse, ZooNation: The Kate Prince Company.\n\nMessage In A Bottle features haze effects and some scenes of an adult nature.\n\nCo-Produced with Birmingham Hippodrome and The Lowry, Salford. Research and development supported by The MOVEment.\n\nImage description: Against a background of buildings along a river, a woman flings a powerful bare foot into the air. Her legs are in the splits, while her arms are crossed in front of her, one raised arm seeming to hold the other in tension, like a bow and arrow. She wears a flimsy white dress and her black hair is in a short pixie cut."
