One city’s list may differ slightly from another, but there are certain tunes that are the standards among standards and can be called anywhere throughout the world.\n\nThe 50 jazz standards we’ve compiled are the “standards among standards” that will help you communicate better with other musicians on any gig or jam session.\n\nThe Snowball Effect\n\nAre you familiar with the snowball effect?\n\nA snowball starts off small, but as it rolls through the snow, it grows larger and larger. As it grows, its surface area increases, allowing it to pick up more and more snow. The more snow it accumulates, the more snow it accumulates in the future.\n\nLearning jazz standards works in exactly the same way. Many jazz standards are built from the same chord changes and progressions. In a sense, when you learn one jazz song, you are learning the parts of many other jazz songs.\n\nTherefore, the more jazz standards you learn, the easier and easier it becomes for you to learn any jazz song.\n\nThe following 50 jazz standards contain many elements that appear in most songs throughout the jazz world.
