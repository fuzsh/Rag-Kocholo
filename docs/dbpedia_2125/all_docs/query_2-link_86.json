        "text": "Taylor Swift’s hugely successful Wembley Stadium concerts in June saw fans party so hard they moved the Earth. According to the seismology team at University College London (UCL), who were invited by Wembley Park to monitor the seismic activity across the opening three nights, fans shaking their stuff to Love Story on the opening night (21st June) shook the ground with a force equivalent to an earthquake of around 0.8 magnitude.\n\nShake It Off, Look What You Made Me Do, I Can Do With A Broken Heart and Karma also inspired record numbers of Swifties to dance so hard they moved the ground beneath their feet.\n\nReady to make the Earth move again in August? Then let's kick off this ultimate guide to Taylor Swift at Wembley Stadium with a summary of what to expect, song-wise. Research from Taylor's Eras Tour reveals that \"Folklore/Evermore\" and \"Midnights\" dominated during the June concerts in London. On the flip side, \"Speak Now\" and \"Fearless\" had fewer songs featured. “Lover”, \"1989\" and \"Reputation\" were also well represented.\n\nTaylor keeps her concerts exciting with a mix of extended, shortened, and mashed-up performances. For example, \"Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince\" kicks off as a brief intro, while \"Lover\" is performed with an acoustic guitar and extended outro. \"Enchanted\" boasts a new transition intro, and \"Champagne Problems\" features a new rendition with an acoustic piano. Most tracks from \"Tortured Poets Department\" are shortened, with \"So High School\" presented as a new mashup.\n\nFollow this guide to Taylor's Swift concert at Wembley Stadium for a stress-free visit:\n\nBag Policy\n\nWembley Stadium does not allow any bag larger than an A4 piece of paper (H 297mm, W 210mm and D 210mm) – double-check before you leave the house, because you won't be able to enter with a bigger one. Find out more about Wembley Stadium's bag policy here.\n\nOfficial Merch\n\nBuying some official Taylor Swift merch to mark this momentous occasion? You'll be given a clear plastic bag. If this is inside the stadium - all good. If it is purchased outside Wembley Stadium (read below to find out where the official merch stands are), the plastic bag will be sealed and it must remain sealed until inside.\n\nArriving at Wembley Stadium\n\nWhen you arrive at the stadium, show your ticket and ID. We recommend bringing a small power bank with you to keep your phone charged up all day. Finally, no umbrellas are allowed inside, so a disposable poncho is always a good idea in case of rain.\n\nDo I Need to Bring Cash?\n\nNo. Wembley Stadium is now a cashless venue and NO kiosks will accept cash. Please bring a debit or credit card with you.\n\nAge restrictions\n\nVisitors to Taylor Swift at Wembley Stadium have a few age restrictions, so please make sure you follow them. No under 5's allowed and no under 14's to be pitch standing. All under 14's must be accompanied by an adult aged 18 or over.\n\nWhat do I need to bring with me for Taylor Swift concert at Wembley Stadium?\n\nYou’ll need your tickets and ID on you all the time you’re in Wembley Stadium. If you have electronic tickets, be sure to bring a power bank – just in case!\n\nWhat Items Are Prohibited Inside the Stadium?\n\nNote that several items are prohibited from Wembley Stadium, including selfie sticks, pushchairs, large umbrellas, alcohol and food and drink (amongst others), so all visitors are advised to read up on what is permitted in advance.\n\nPhone Coverage and Wembley Park Free Wi-Fi\n\nIf you plan to use your smartphone (who doesn't these days) when attending events at Wembley Stadium, be aware that mobile phone coverage can be hit and miss due to the high concentration of people trying to access the network simultaneously. Some providers may experience connectivity issues or even complete loss of service.\n\nTo ensure you can still use your smartphone during your visit, we recommend taking advantage of the free Wi-Fi provided by Wembley Park. Just connect to the #WembleyParkFreeWifi network, sign up and you’re set. The service is available across all the main areas in Wembley Park, including Olympic Way.\n\nYou don’t have to be a local to find the best places to eat and drink in Wembley Park. The neighbourhood is known for its excellent selection of restaurants, from twice Michelin starred chef Atul Kochhar’s Masalchi to over two dozen international street food options at BOXPARK Wembley (make a beeline for JungleBerry if you’re on a health kick or for Love Churros if you’re after pure indulgence).\n\nWembley Park is awash with flavours from across the globe. Locals looking for a Lebanese fix swear by Beirut Wonders, while pasta lovers recommend local institution Pasta Remoli. The 50s diner vibes at Big Moe’s are always a hit with younger visitors (don’t miss their chocolate milkshakes!), while those in need of a caffeine fix and a quick bite will find all they need at Black Sheep Coffee.\n\nLooking for something lighter? No problem! Head to Choppaluna for an outstanding selection of fresh salads, melts and soups. Or if indulgence is on your menu, settle in to enjoy the world-famous doughnuts at Bread Ahead.\n\nFor pre-concert drinks, The White Horse delivers the perfect traditional pub vibe, while BOXPARK’s Taylor Swift Fanpark means you can enjoy a drink and dance to get you in the mood for the concert.\n\nFans attending the Taylor Swift concerts at Wembley Stadium from August 15th to 20th will have access to four merchandise stands located on Olympic Way and the massive store across the ground floor of Green Parking (find our map to Wembley Park car parks here). No event ticket is necessary to visit these shops, which will be open throughout the duration of the Wembley concerts.\n\nOpening Times are:\n\nDate: Operation: Timings:\n\nWed 14 August - Live (non-show day) - 10:00 – 20:00\n\nThurs 15 August - Live (show day) - 10:00 – 19:00\n\nFriday 16 August - Live (show day) - 10:00 – 19:00\n\nSaturday 17 August - Live (show day) - 10:00 – 19:00\n\nSunday 18 August - Live (non-show day) - 10:00 – 20:00\n\nMonday 19 August - Live (show day) - 10:00-19:00\n\nTuesday 20 August - Live (show day) - 10:00-19:00\n\nPlenty has been revealed online about merchandise on sale at official stands for The Eras Tour, including pricing. Based on Swifties’ experiences of the June Wembley Stadium concerts, fans can expect to find plenty of merchandise at the August Wembley Stadium shows, including items such as:\n\nHoodies priced at £70\n\nQuarter zip sweaters and crew neck sweaters, both at £65\n\nT-shirts and long-sleeve tees for £40 each\n\nTote bags available for £25\n\nWater bottles selling at £15\n\nBracelets priced at £30\n\nPosters for £15\n\nFor information on merchandise stand opening times, please keep a look out for details here.\n\nIt’s important to always buy concert tickets from trustworthy sources.\n\nIn the UK, that means buying tickets from Ticketmaster or AXS.\n\nNever, ever buy tickets from a suspicious source online or outside a venue – it’s a surefire way to costly disappointment. While sites such as viagogo, Vivid Seats and StubHub provide ticket resales, sellers usually charge a premium and buying a second-hand ticket may render it void.\n\nWhat to do before the Taylor Swift concert\n\nFor more adrenalin-fuelled activities, why not try your hand at warding off the zombie apocalypse at meetspaceVR or scoring a hole in one to the pumping tunes at Pop Golf? Those seeing Taylor Swift in August will also have the chance to pop to Bubble Planet for an immersive and interactive multi-sensory bubble experience like no other. Swifties can also take a moment to snap a selfie on the ‘Swiftie Steps’ or in front of the ‘…Ready For It’ mural on the side of the stairs. The large-format photo gallery of some of Taylor’s incredible tour moments, on display in Arena Square, is also a must-visit spot for Swifties in Wembley Park this August.\n\nRelax in Union Park\n\nVisitors looking to relax in nature, meanwhile, can head to the beautiful Union Park to be surrounded by trees, wildflowers and fountains. Just 5 minutes’ walk from Wembley Stadium, the park is a celebration of the natural world – the ideal spot to centre yourself and balance your energies before joining tens of thousands of screaming Swifties!"
