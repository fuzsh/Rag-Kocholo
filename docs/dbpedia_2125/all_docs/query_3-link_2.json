        "text": "What is it about music that people like so much? Is it the sound, the feelings it evokes, or the images it conjures up? Music is so central to human life and elicits such varied reactions that it is hard to know which aspects of it underlie preferences. Theory and research in music psychology has focused considerable attention on the effects that music can have on cognitive, physiological, and neurological processes. We know that when individuals listen to their favorite music, they experience “chills” or “shivers” (Grewe, Kopiez, & Altenmüller, 2009; Sloboda, 1991), heightened levels of positive affect (Schellenberg, Peretz, & Vieillard, 2008; Sloboda & O’Neill, 2001; Zentner, Grandjean, & Scherer, 2008) that may be accompanied by dopamine release (Menon & Levitin, 2005), and mental stimulation (Emery, Hsiao, Hill, & Frid, 2003; George, Stickle, Rachid, & Wopnford, 2007; Rickard, Toukhsati, & Field, 2005). We also know that people use their favorite music as an identity badge to broadcast information about themselves to others and that such social messages influence how individuals are perceived (Rentfrow & Gosling, 2006; 2007; Rentfrow, McDonald, & Oldmeadow, 2009). Appreciation for music is regarded as a human cultural universal (Brown, 2004; Cross, 2001) and remains intact even in individuals with neurodevelopmental impairment (Levitin, et al, 2004; Levitin & Bellugi, 1998). Curiously, despite the overwhelming evidence that listening to music can have a variety of important effects, we know very little about why people like the music they do. Which aspects of music shape preferences?\n\nThe overarching aim of the present research program is to broaden our understanding of the nature of musical preferences. Toward that end, the current investigation set out to examine which aspects of music underlie individual differences in musical preferences. Specifically, we argue that research on individual differences in musical preferences has been limited by conceptual and methodological constraints that have hindered our understanding of the psychological and social factors underlying preferences in music. This work attempts to correct those methodological shortcomings with the goal of advancing theory and research in this area.\n\nThe Structure of Musical Preferences\n\nCattell and Anderson (1953) were among the first investigators to systematically examine individual differences in musical preferences. To do so, they developed a musical preference test consisting of 120 classical and jazz music excerpts, to which respondents reported their degree of liking (Cattell & Anderson, 1953; Cattell & Saunders, 1954). Factor analyses of preference ratings for the excerpts suggested 12 music-preference factors, which Cattell interpreted as dimensions of unconscious personality traits. For instance, preferences for excerpts of fast musical pieces defined one factor, labeled surgency, and preferences for excerpts of slow, melancholic musical pieces defined another factor, labeled sensitivity. Cattell’s interest in studying musical preferences had more to do with developing a method for measuring unconscious aspects of personality than with musical preferences. Specifically, Cattell posited that music evokes visceral responses that are outside conscious control; hence musical preferences were thought to reflect unconscious needs, urges, and conflicts. However, given the inherent difficulty of empirically validating unconscious processes and the growing skepticism surrounding individual differences at the time (e.g., Mischel, 1968), Cattell’s music research had no impact on mainstream psychology.\n\nOnly recently have researchers returned to examining the structure of individual differences in musical preferences. Unlike Cattell, however, current researchers are expressly interested in understanding the psychological basis of musical preferences. The assumption underlying much of this work is that individuals seek musical environments that reinforce and reflect aspects of their personalities, attitudes, and emotions (Colley, 2008; Delsing, ter Bogt, Engels, & Meeus, 2008; George et al., 2007; Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003; Rentfrow & McDonald, 2009; Schäfer & Sedlmeier, 2009). Much of the research in this area has examined the structure of musical preferences with the aim of developing a foundation on which to develop and test hypotheses about the role of music in everyday life.\n\nNearly a dozen independent investigations have examined the structure of musical preferences. Most of these investigations assessed individual differences in preferences using music-genre labels (e.g., classical, rock, rap, etc.) as proxies for listening to actual musical pieces. Despite using highly similar methods, there was little consensus about which genre labels to study or how many to measure — some studied as few as 11 (e.g., Colley, 2008; Delsing, et al., 2008) and others as many as 30 genre labels (e.g., George, et al., 2007). Nevertheless, results across these studies showed some degree of convergence at approximately five music-preference dimensions (Colley, 2008; Delsing et al., 2008; Dunn, de Ruyter, & Bouwhuis, in press; George et al., 2007; Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003; Rentfrow & McDonald, 2009; Schäfer & Sedlmeier, 2009). Careful examination of the factor structures reported across these studies suggests that there is one factor defined mainly by preferences for classical and jazz music; another factor defined by preferences for rock and heavy metal music; a third factor defined by preferences for rap and hip-hop music; a fourth factor comprising mainly preferences for country music; and a fifth factor composed mostly of preferences for new age and electronic styles of music.\n\nThese convergent findings are encouraging because they suggest that there is a robust structure underlying individual differences in musical preferences. However, a limitation of the work is that the studies situated their experiments within the system of music genre labels as defined by the recording and retail music industries. Although genres represent a level of analysis that most people are familiar with (Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003) – retail stores have been classifying music this way for 50 years – the genre categories themselves are neither logically constructed nor coherent. For example, Frank Sinatra might be found under any of the following categories: Popular, Male Vocal, Big Band, Swing, Easy Listening, Broadway, or Jazz. Indeed, in some cases, different albums by Sinatra would be classified under different headings. AC/DC and Van Halen were once considered Heavy Metal and now are considered Classic Rock. The music of Rosanne Cash has more in common with the folk-rock of early Joni Mitchell and James Taylor than the country label under which her music is typically found, due to accidents of history, birth, and the vagaries of the industry. In pilot work, we found that participants did not always agree on the genre and subgenre labels under which even their own favorite music should be placed. Thus, measurements based solely on genre labels are necessarily crude and imprecise. To push the point further, it is evident that individuals who like, for instance, classical music, do not like all classical music, and furthermore, they may like select pieces of jazz, pop, and soul. Thus a model that relies heavily on the vague and heterogeneous classification of genre labels is clearly missing an important aspect of musical preferences – aspects of the music itself, and its social construal.\n\nFurthermore, the heterogeneity of genres means that they fail to index music’s many facets; relying solely on genre labels makes it hard to know which aspects of music influence preferences. Listeners could be drawn to auditory and psychological properties that are intrinsic to the music, such as timbre, pitch, or intensity. These in turn, especially when combined with lyrics, can give rise to specific emotional reactions to the music that are genre-independent. Or they could be influenced by social connotations that are extrinsic to the music, such as whether the music is regarded as “cool” or “appropriate” for one’s social identity or group. In other words, it seems logical to assume that similar emotional reactions might occur to musical pieces from different genres, and different reactions might occur to musical pieces from within the same genre. Thus our aim was not to abandon the genre-based selection of experimental music entirely, but rather, to develop new measurement approaches that would allow us to access the diversity of music that exists within a genre, and those latent cross-genre consistencies that may exist.\n\nWhat might such cross-genre consistencies look like? There has been no comprehensive systematic analysis of how different facets of music shape musical preferences but the available research suggests that there are individual differences in preferences for vocal as opposed to instrumental music, fast vs. slow music, and loud vs. soft music (Kopacz, 2005; McCown, Keiser, Mulhearn, & Williamson, 1997; McNamara & Ballard 1999; Rentfrow & Gosling, 2006). There is also emerging evidence of individual differences in preferences for pieces of music that evoke or signify emotions such as happiness, joy, sadness, and anger (Rickard, 2004; Schellenberg et al., 2008; Zentner et al., 2008). And there is evidence that individuals are drawn to musical styles with particular social connotations, such as toughness, rebellion, distinctiveness, and sophistication (Abrams, 2009; Schwartz & Fouts, 2003; Tekman & Hortaçsu, 2002). Taken together, these findings clearly point to the need to assess musical preferences using a method that captures the many auditory and psychological aspects of music.\n\nTo address this need and establish a robust framework of musical preferences, Rentfrow, Goldberg, and Levitin (2011) recently examined individual differences in musical preferences by playing audio recordings of real music taken from a range of genres to experimental participants. Specifically, in three independent studies, participants were presented with 15-second audio excerpts of actual musical pieces and asked to indicate their degree of liking for each excerpt. The pieces used in the studies were different. In Study 1, the excerpts were from commercially released musical pieces and in Studies 2 and 3 the excerpts were from commercially unreleased musical pieces obtained from Getty Images. To identify the characteristics that defined and differentiated each of the preference dimensions, the musical pieces used in all three studies were rated by independent coders on seven auditory attributes (e.g., distorted, fast, loud) and seven psychological attributes (e.g., aggressive, intelligent, romantic).\n\nFactor analyses of the music-preference data from each of the three studies converged to reveal five robust music-preference dimensions. Analyses of the auditory and psychological attributes associated with the pieces provided clues about the properties that defined each of the factors and provided a foundation for interpreting them. The first factor was defined by pieces of music that coders described as romantic, relaxing, unaggressive, sad, slow, and quiet, and from the genres the music industry labels soft rock, R & B, and adult contemporary; on the basis of those results, we labeled this factor Mellow (or relaxed, slow, and romantic). The second factor was defined by pieces of music that were coded as uncomplicated, relaxing, unaggressive, soft, and acoustic, and primarily from the country, folk, and singer/songwriter music genres; on the basis of those findings, we labeled this factor Unpretentious (or uncomplicated, unaggressive, and soft sounding). The third factor was defined by pieces of music that were coded as inspiring, intelligent, complex, and dynamic, and were from the classical, operatic, avant-garde, world beat, and traditional jazz music genres; given those results, we labeled this factor Sophisticated (or complex, intelligent, and cultured). The fourth factor was defined by pieces of music that were coded as distorted, loud, aggressive, and not relaxing, romantic, nor inspiring, and were from the classic rock, punk, heavy metal, and power pop music genres; the characteristics of that factor led us to label it Intense (or loud, aggressive, and tense). The fifth factor was defined by pieces of music that were coded as percussive, electric, and not sad, and from the rap, electronica, Latin, acid jazz, and Euro pop music genres; on the basis of those results, we labeled the factor Contemporary (or current, rhythmic, and danceable). Taken together, the results suggested that preferences for Mellow, Unpretentious, Sophisticated, Intense, and Contemporary (or MUSIC) provide a multidimensional framework for conceptualizing and measuring individual differences in musical preferences.\n\nMoreover, the results from Rentfrow et al. (2011) indicated that the music-preference dimensions were orthogonal, meaning that preferences for each dimension were independent of preferences for the other dimensions. Although it may appear on the surface that some of the preference factors are opposites (e.g., Mellow and Intense), the results from the factor analyses indicate otherwise. Furthermore, the orthogonality of the factors converges with anecdotal and empirical evidence that people use different styles of music to satisfy different needs (North & Hargreaves, 1996; 1998). For example, someone might choose to listen to Mellow or Unpretentious music to unwind, Sophisticated music to create an ambience for dinner parties, Intense music for aerobic workouts, and Contemporary music for getting ready for a night on the town. Thus, preferences for one music dimension are independent of preferences for another.\n\nThe results from the Rentfrow et al. (2011) studies replicated findings from previous research by providing strong evidence for five robust music-preference dimensions, and also clarified past research on music-genre preferences by identifying some of the properties that are common to pieces of music on the same dimension. The findings also suggested that the structure of musical preferences is not dependent entirely upon preferences for music genres, because several musical pieces from the same genre had their primary loadings on different factors. Furthermore, results from hierarchical multiple regression analyses suggested that the attributes of a piece of music predicted its location within the multi-dimensional MUSIC space over and above its genre classification. Thus, it would appear that the structure of musical preferences is influenced more by individuals’ degree of liking for configurations of certain auditory and psychological attributes (e.g., inspiring and dynamic; distorted and aggressive) than by the social connotations of music genres (e.g., worldly; rebellious).\n\nRentfrow et al. (2011) examined preferences for audio excerpts taken from a variety of musical genres, so it is difficult to know for sure the extent to which attributes were the main force underlying musical preferences. If musical preferences are based on liking for certain combinations of musical attributes rather than the social or other extra-musical connotations associated with a particular genre, then a logical hypothesis to follow is that the MUSIC factors should emerge in a heterogeneous selection of musical pieces taken from a single genre. If, on the other hand, preferences are based on the degree to which individuals are attracted to the social-cognitive image associated with a style of music, then we should expect to find a single factor that reflects individual differences in preferences for that genre. The present research was designed to test this hypothesis."
