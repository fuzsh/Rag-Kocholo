        "text": "Running Time: Act One 1h 10 | 20 Min intermission | Act Two 1h 2\n\nSee Prince Edward Island’s iconic redhead on stage this summer! This Canadian classic is a humorous, touching, and dynamic musical that will inspire your imagination, tickle your funny bone, and mesmerize you with its graceful and exhilarating singing and dancing.\n\nThis cherished family musical tells the poignant and funny story of a freckle-faced, red-haired orphan named Anne Shirley who arrives at the Bright River Railway Station full of hope for a new life. Her destination is the home of brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert in Avonlea, Prince Edward Island. When she arrives at Green Gables, Anne is devastated when she discovers that the elderly couple is expecting a boy from the orphanage, and then ecstatic when they decide to keep her. With her fiery temper, love of melodrama and romance, and penchant for misadventure, she brings laughter, love, and more than a little consternation to the Cuthberts’ quiet lives. In return, Anne finds the happiness and the home she has longed for all her life.\n\nWith a 28-member company and a 14-member live orchestra, this legendary musical has delighted millions of people at Confederation Centre of the Arts.\n\n“Overflowing with talent…wildfire that can’t be missed.” – The Guardian\n\n“Vibrant, exciting, heartwarming… Anne is still P.E.I.’s most welcome summer visitor.” – The Buzz\n\n“The new elements also do something that is essential to the original novel, they create a sense of the scale of time that has elapsed, so when hearts swell or break or stop, you understand the weight of it.” – The Guardian\n\nAUDIENCE ADVISORY: Strobe lighting and light haze effects are used in this production.\n\nDOWNLOAD the music of Anne of Green Gables–The Musical™ on Apple Music\n\nVIEW PROGRAM (PDF)\n\nCREDITS\n\nBased upon the novel Anne of Green Gables by L.M.
