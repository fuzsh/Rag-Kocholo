        "text": "Get Blue is the fourth track on Louie Louie’s second album Let’s Get Started. The song was written by Prince (as Paisley Park) and Levi Seacer, Jr. and produced by Prince (as Paisley Park).\n\nA tape photographed in Prince’s vault at Paisley Park Studios lists it as 8 April 1991 alluding the exact date for the recording at Paisley Park Studios in Chanhassen, Minnesota. However the song was actually tracked on 17 March 1991 and mixed two days later. The April 8 date possibly refers to the work done on the track by Keith \"K.C.\" Cohen at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood, California.\n\nLouie Louie’s vocal overdubs were recorded at Sideways Recording, Santa Ana, California, but recording dates are not known.\n\nIn 2010, co-writer Levi Seacer, Jr. released a mostly-instrumental version of the track with Ric Alexander on their album 2wo 4or 1ne (crediting Prince, rather than the pseudonym Paisley Park, as co-writer), but this version did not contain input by Prince."
