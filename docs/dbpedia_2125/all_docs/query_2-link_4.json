        "text": "@Septe Thanks for following up and clarifying that with me.\n\nCould you tell me a bit more about what is happening? Are you listening to Pandora on a computer or on a device?\n\nIf you are on a computer, are you listening from:\n\nA Mac or Windows computer?\n\nOur website, or the desktop app? If you're listening from our website, what browser are you using?\n\nIf you are on a device, what is the make and model (and carrier, if applicable)?\n\nIs there an error message? If so, what does it say?\n\nCan you provide me with a screenshot/screen-recording of what you're seeing?\n\nThanks for working with me on this.\n\n@Septe Thanks for following up and clarifying that with me.\n\nCould you tell me a bit more about what is happening? Are you listening to Pandora on a computer or on a device?\n\nIf you are on a computer, are you listening from:\n\nA Mac or Windows computer?\n\nOur website, or the desktop app?

If so, what does it say?\n\nCan you provide me with a screenshot/screen-recording of what you're seeing?\n\nThanks for working with me on this.\n\nHmm...I thought I answered this but I don't see my answer so...\n\n1. I'm on Windows 10 computer using the website\n\n2. Not on device, see No. 1.\n\n3. No error message. Song gets cut off.\n\n4. Again, it's a particular song(s). I'll have to listen to the songs to see which ones get cutoff and report those.\n\n@Septe Thanks for following up.\n\nIf you're listening from our website, what browser are you using? (Ex: Google Chrome, Firefox, etc)\n\nLet me know and I'll make sure to send over some troubleshooting steps for you to try out.\n\n@Septe I moved your post over to the Desktop space since this issue sounds specific to your computer.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't support the Brave browser.\n\nPlease use one of our supported browsers for listening to Pandora, like Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Internet Explorer.\n\nYou can find the minimum specifications to run Pandora on the web here.\n\nAnother alternative is to try out the Desktop app, if you're interested.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nAgain, a case of not reading what I'm saying. Pink Floyd Brain Damage on Pandora is cutoff. Pandora shows Brain Damage to have a running time of 3:46. It's too short when the actual run length 5:54 or even longer depending on the version. There are other songs that have been cutoff and I'll post them as I go along.\n\n@Septe To clarify, does the track show that it should have a run time of 3:46, however the music stops before it ever reaches that point?\n\nLet me know.\n\nThe track shows a run time of 3:46 and runs the length, but, the actual song has a length of 5:54 or longer. A person familiar with the song will tell you that the song got cut off. Pink Floyd songs sometimes do cutoff quick as that's how it's played so I'm not surprised if this one got missed.\n\nI have seen other complaints of this, however they have been very light on details, so I will log my own complaint. Several songs have been been cut off or shortened. Specific instances that I have noticed are:\n\nThe song Cantina Band from the album Star Wars: A New Hope (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n\nThe song Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band (Remastered) from the Beatles album of the same name\n\nThe every song in the album Christmas Eve And Other Stories by Trans-Siberian Orchestra\n\nI first noticed this issue a little more than a year ago, and it has persisted since then. My device is a iPhone 7 running IOS 14.2 and the app is up to date. I am part of a Pandora premium family plan. I have not tested whether this issue persists on other apps, I will update this when I do with the results. Please look into this issue.\n\n@Darth_Skaro I moved your post over to this existing thread: Songs cut off before they are finished\n\nTo clarify, are the runtime of these tracks shorter that what you expect to see?\n\nLet me know.\n\nYes, the run time is shorter than expected. On most it’s only about 30 seconds, maybe one minute at most, but on one song I’m particular The Prince of Peace from the album Christmas Eve and other stories a good portion of the song is cut out.\n\n@Darth_Skaro Would it be possible to send me a screenshot of what you are seeing?\n\nAlso to clarify, does the song show it will play for \"X\" amount of time, however it gets cut off after only playing for 30 seconds?\n\nLet me know.\n\nHere are the song lyrics:\n\nThe song runs until the first pink line, at which point it jumps down too the second pink line, and runs until the blue line, at which point the lyrics are completely different. It is important to note that the entire time the playtime stays the same and acts normally, with the little track slider running from one end to another without jumping around or jumping forward. This leads me to my conclusion that Pandora is is playing different recordings of songs, which can vary slightly, or even majorly. There are other instances of similarly named things being conflated or confused by the app, such as albums by Fred Rogers, the kids television show host, being listed under Fred Rogers, the rapper, though this specific instance has recently been resolved.\n\n@Darth_Skaro Thanks for sending that over.\n\nYes - it is possible that the version you sent over is just a separate recording than one you are normally used to hearing.\n\nIn regards to other tracks being mislabeled or various artists having their music listed under an artist with the same name (but different genre), feel free to report any instances of those on either of these threads:\n\nIncorrect song title\n\nMusic listed under the wrong artist\n\nMusic listed under artist with similar name\n\nHope this helps!\n\nI'm running windows 10 from the website, playing the station \"70s Rock Radio,\" and the song \"American Pie\" fades out during the chorus before the third verse which begins \"Helter-skelter-in-a-summer-swelter.\" Nearly half the song is missing.\n\nI don't like paying for a service where half songs are missing."
