Mainstays on the Chicago dive bar circuit, Bobby and his band are hustling for their big break. But after their latest rejection, Bobby decides it’s “Hip to Be Square,” trades in his guitar, and starts “Workin’ for a Livin’” in corporate America. His boss, Cassandra, has struggles of her own, having sacrificed her personal life for the company. When they both get a shot at their dreams—for Bobby, another crack at rock stardom, and for Cassandra, a chance to become CEO—they must decide “If This Is It” for their careers, or if “The Power of Love” triumphs over all. The Heart of Rock & Roll celebrates the classic songs of Huey Lewis and the News in this heartwarming and hilarious new musical.\n\nClick here to listen to Huey Lewis talk about The Heart of Rock & Roll with Jimmy Kimmel\n\nClick here to read Huey Lewis talk about his world premiere musical The Heart of Rock & Roll with the San Diego Union-Tribune\n\nThe Heart of Rock & Roll is the recipient of an Edgerton Foundation New Play Award.\n\nProduction Sponsors\n\nTerry Atkinson\n\nElaine and Dave Darwin\n\nEdgerton Foundation\n\nRhona and Rick Thompson\n\nPam Wagner and Hans Tegebo\n\nSheryl and Harvey White\n\nArtist Sponsor for Brian Usifer (Music Supervision, Arrangements, and Orchestrations)\n\nMandell Weiss Charitable Trust\n\nRunning time: 2 hours, 20 minutes, which includes one 15-minute intermission.\n\nPress Release Program Song List\n\nVicki and Carl Zeiger Insights Seminars\n\nThis series provides Old Globe patrons with an opportunity to closely connect with productions both onstage and backstage.
