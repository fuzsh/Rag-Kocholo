        "text": "Is there anything better than curling up on the couch with some popcorn and having a family movie night? No, there’s not, and so I’ve put together a list of the best family movies of all time to help you create the perfect night in.\n\nWhether you need a little downtime after a busy weekend or enjoy taking time out on a weekend, here are some family-friendly movies everyone will love. You can delight kids and adults alike, while also creating long-lasting memories when you turn on one of these movies to watch with family. Here is a comprehensive collection of the best family films ever made.\n\nSpending Time Together on Family Movie Night\n\nSpending time together as a family is important because it strengthens your bonds and creates shared memories you all treasure for years to come. By engaging in an activity together, you get to know your family members better and improve your understanding of what they care about and why.\n\nWatching movies together helps you gain insights into what your family members find funny, sad or frustrating. You can discuss how others would react to a challenging situation happening to a character on-screen and discover new things to inform your own family dynamics. Movies require very little preparation or cleanup besides finding where the film is streaming and sweeping up leftover popcorn. Also, watching movies is just fun—and having fun is also a critical part of life.\n\nThe Best Movies to Watch as a Family (40-11)\n\nMost family-friendly movies are rated G Gravity or PG, suitable for ages 3-6 and up. We’ve also included a handful of PG-13 movies for families with teens. Our list has something to appeal to every taste, with everything from animation to musical to comedy to fantasy to science fiction. The oldest film is from 1977.\n\nAnd now, the top 40 family movie night movies.\n\n40. Cinderella (1997)\n\nThe PG-rated TV movie from 1997 stars then-pop princess Brandy Norwood, who became the first Black woman to play Cinderella on the big screen. The one-hour, 28-minute film follows Cinderella’s desperate attempt to escape her horrid stepmother and stepsisters by finding love with the prince—with the help of a golden-voiced fairy godmother (Whitney Houston).\n\nDirected by Robert Iscove, the film is appropriate for ages 5 and up. It was a huge ratings success and earned critical acclaim upon its release, and Cinderella has become a family favorite in the two-plus decades after its release. It’s available on Disney+ and for rent on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n39. Enchanted (2007)\n\nStarting with Cinderella and continuing with this charming 2007 film, Disney has been rewriting the princess motif with a modern flair. Cartoon princess Giselle (Amy Adams) accidentally winds up in a very real New York City, where she meets Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and finds the happily ever after that eluded her in Andalasia.\n\nThe well-reviewed Enchanted was both a parody of outdated ideas from old Disney movies and an homage to their good points, with several standout song-and-dance numbers kids will love. The PG-rated movie, directed by Kevin Lima, is appropriate for kids 5 and older. You can watch the one-hour, 47-minute film on Disney+ or rent it on AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n38. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)\n\nMarvel’s first film with an Asian director (Destin Daniel Cretton) and largely Asian cast, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings came out in 2021 and received an excellent 92% score on Rotten Tomatoes. It stars Simi Liu as Shang-Chi, a seemingly aimless young man with superpowers who is forced to return to China.\n\nThere, he confronts his father and the corrupt Ten Rings organization his dad runs, with help from best friend Katy (Awkwafina). At two hours and 12 minutes and with a PG-13 rating, the film is best suited for older tweens and teens. It’s available on Disney+ and for rent on AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n37. Coco (2017)\n\nThe beautifully animated 2017 film Coco is a fantasy focused on the Mexican holiday Day of the Dead. Young wannabe musician Miguel (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez) clashes with his grandmother about becoming a musician and becomes temporarily banished to the realm of the dead.\n\nCoco is rated PG and best for ages 7 and up at an hour and 45 minutes. With an original conceit and skillful direction by Lee Unkrich and co-director Adrian Molina, Coco is a feast for the eyes and the ears, laden with catchy original music. The film received exceptional reviews for its gorgeous animation and creative portrayal of the Day of the Dead, and it offers a chance to teach children about a treasured cultural tradition. You can watch Coco on Disney+.\n\n36. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)\n\nPerfect for older tweens and teens who enjoy animation but want something a little more sophisticated than princess films, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse follows Miles Morales, a teen who can’t seem to please his police officer father. Following a radioactive spider bite, Miles gains similar powers to Spider-Man and takes over when villains kill Spidey.\n\nShameik Moore voices Miles as a kind and confused kid trying to do the best with his newfound “great responsibility.\" Directors Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey and Rodney Rothman embrace the multiverse, which can spark great family conversations about time travel. The PG-rated, one-hour, 56-minute film and its 2023 sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, earned outstanding reviews. You can watch it on Hulu and fubo TV or rent it on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies\n\n35. Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993)\n\nOne of the great buddy movies of the ‘90s, Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey follows two dogs and a cat (voiced by Michael J. Fox, Don Ameche and Sally Field) who try to navigate back home after their owner leaves them at a friend’s ranch.\n\nBound, directed by Duwayne Dunham, is a remake of a 1963 film, and despite receiving fairly middling audience reviews at the time of its release, it has aged well and become a modern classic. The G-rated movie is appropriate for kids ages 5 and up, who will love the anthropomorphic animals and relate to feelings of missing home and wanting to feel safe. Bound has a runtime of one hour, 24 minutes, and it’s streaming on Disney+ and available to rent on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n34. West Side Story (2021)\n\nThe remake of the 1961 retelling of Romeo & Juliet in contemporary New York City features some of the best song-and-dance numbers ever put on film. Directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Rachel Zegler and Ansel Elgort as star-crossed lovers Maria and Tony, the movie explores issues of identity and family loyalty.\n\nThe sophisticated themes and love story, plus the PG-13 rating and two-hour, 26-minute run time, make this movie best for older tweens and teens. Ariana DeBose earned a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her standout portrayal of Maria’s older sister, Anita (Rita Moreno earned the same award for the same role decades earlier). The film earned mixed reviews, but West Side Story has always been a polarizing retelling. Most musical fans agree it is one of the great films. You can watch it on Hulu, Disney+, Sling and fubo TV.\n\n33. Paddington (2014)\n\nProper Paddington bear from Peru finds himself in London, where a family adopts him and chaos ensues. This utterly delightful 2014 film, directed by Paul King and with a run time of one hour, 35 minutes, earned a near-perfect 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes thanks to its fresh writing and well-imagined cinematography.\n\nDisplaced from his home in Peru, Paddington tries to track down the explorer who connected with his family there but then becomes entangled with a taxidermist determined to add him to her stuffed bear collection. The nonstop action and clever dialogue make this PG-rated film—starring Ben Whishaw, Hugh Bonneville, Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant—ideal for ages 5 and up. Paddington is available on Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, and you can rent it on YouTube and Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n32. Daddy Day Care (2003)\n\nCharlie Hinton (Eddie Murphy) is living the American dream until he gets laid off from his corporate job. Unable to find a new position, he teams with his best friend, Phil (Jeff Garlin), to open an in-home day care—but the job is not as idyllic as it seems. Hilarity, and fantastic physical comedy, ensues.\n\nDirector Steve Carr tackles issues including traditional gender roles and the value of the stay-at-home parent role while also generating nonstop laughs. The 2003 film, rated PG, is best for slightly older children ages 8 and up thanks to the slapstick bits. Though it wasn’t a critical hit, audiences loved Daddy Day Care, and it has remained popular for decades after its release. You can watch the one-hour, 32-minute movie on Max or Amazon Prime Video, or you can rent it on Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n31. Like Mike (2002)\n\nAnother beloved early 2000s film, Like Mike is a comedy about Calvin (L’il Bow Wow), a teenage orphan who discovers a pair of shoes once owned by Michael Jordan and imbued with magical powers. When Calvin dons the shoes, he suddenly plays like his basketball idol and gets an NBA contract.\n\nThe John Schultz-directed film, rated PG and running one hour, 39 minutes, has a sweet earnestness, and parents will love sharing their memories of Jordan with kids who may not know much about his basketball career. The film was a critical flop when it was released, but over the years, it’s become a great example of an underrated PG-rated winner that appeals to ages 6 and up. It’s available to stream on Starz, YouTube, Hulu, Sling, the Roku Channel and Amazon Prime Video.\n\n30. Inside Out (2015)\n\nThis gem of an animated film shows what happens when a tween girl’s conflicting emotions—including Joy (Amy Poehler), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Fear (Bill Hader)—war inside her after she moves to a new place. The PG-rated film best for kids 8 and up facilitates discussions about feelings and how to deal with them.\n\nDirected by Pete Docter (Up, Monsters Inc.), Inside Out received overwhelmingly positive reviews, especially from parents, who appreciate the opportunities it opens for frank conversations about difficult subjects and the brief one-hour, 35-minute run time. You can watch Inside Out on Disney+ or rent it on Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n29. Annie (2014)\n\nAnnie (Quvenzhané Wallis) thinks all her dreams are coming true when she’s plucked from an orphanage to live with billionaire Will (Jamie Foxx). The reality is her adventures, and heartache, are just starting, but by the end of the one-hour, 58-minute film, the two form a sweet family ready to take on the world.\n\nThough it didn’t receive great reviews upon its 2014 release, the musical has become a popular family film, especially at the holidays, as it reinforces the importance of a “found family” and sticking up for those you love. Rated PG, the movie is appropriate for kids ages 7 and up, who will love the catchy songs in director Will Gluck’s remake of the stage play (which was also a 1982 film). Annie is streaming on Starz, Hulu, YouTube, Sling, the Roku Channel and Amazon Prime Video. You can rent it on AppleTV+ or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n28. Freaky Friday (2003)\n\nThe one-hour-, 37-minute remake of the 1976 film, released at the height of then-child-star Lindsay Lohan’s popularity, features one of the best performances of Jamie Lee Curtis’ career as a stressed single mom who somehow switches bodies with her surly teenage daughter (Lohan). It’s funny and touching.\n\nThe PG-rated film, directed by Mark Walters, simplifies the often-complicated mother-daughter dynamic by showing what each side is thinking. In addition to great slapstick comedy, the film has witty one-liners and a wonderful energy. It is best for kids 7 and up who will understand the “switching” storyline. You can stream Freaky Friday, which received great reviews and earned Curtis a Golden Globe nomination, on Disney+ or rent it on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n27. The Jungle Book (2016)\n\nYet another remake, the 2016 version of The Jungle Book marked one of Disney’s first live-action retellings that have become a go-to for the media giant in recent years. Jungle boy Mowgli, a human raised by wolves, must figure out where his loyalties are, to animals or people.\n\nThough the one-hour, 46-minute film is not a musical like the 1967 animated film, a few favorites (like Bare Necessities) do make it into the remake. Still, while the film is rated PG, it’s best for kids ages 8 and older because of a few scenes with tiger Shere Khan and python Kaa could scare younger ones. Director Jon Favreau captures the beauty and intrigue of the jungle in this well-reviewed film, which is getting a sequel and was one of the top-grossing films of 2016 with a high-powered cast including Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Bill Murray, Giancarlo Esposito and Lupita Nyong'o. You can stream Jungle on Disney+ or rent it on Amazon Prime Video, AppleTV+ or Vudu.\n\n26. Bend It Like Beckham (2002)\n\nEighteen-year-old Jess (Parminder Nagra) has always dreamed of playing on a soccer team, but her strict parents, who immigrated from India to London, forbid it. Jess secretly joins a girls’ squad with the encouragement of Jules (Keira Knightley) and learns to stand up for what she loves.\n\nThis PG-13 comedy is perfect for older tweens and teens starting to push the boundaries of parental limits and can inspire conversations about responsibilities vs. passions. Beckham, directed by Gurinder Chadha, was a low-budget independent box office hit with exceptional reviews. At one hour, 52 minutes, it’s available on Disney+, Tubi and Hulu, or you can rent it on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n25. Moana (2016)\n\nWith catchy music written by Lin-Manuel Miranda for a determined heroine bound for greatness, Moana (voiced by Auliʻi Cravalho) is one of a growing number of Disney princesses of color. She uses her grit, imagination and drive to try to save her ancient Polynesian village by fulfilling an ancient prophecy.\n\nThe Rock (Dwayne Johnson) voices the trickster god Maui, who alternately helps and hinders Moana on her journey. The exceedingly popular PG-rated film received good reviews and two Oscar nominations. It fosters discussions about family loyalty and the wisdom of elders vs. free will, making it a great movie for kids 6 and up starting to question rules. It runs one hour, 46 minutes. You can rent Moana on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies or stream it with a subscription to Disney+.\n\n24. The Avengers (2012)\n\nThe original Avengers is the gold standard by which other movies in the Marvel cinematic universe are measured. The PG-13 film blends comedy, adventure and some high-stakes decision-making, guaranteed to thrill older children (ages 10 and up) as well as adults. When Loki, god of mischief, targets Earth, the Avengers assemble to take him down.\n\nStarring Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans and Mark Ruffalo, the film includes several violent but not gory fight scenes. Joss Whedon’s directorial effort received universally good reviews and is considered a favorite in the Marvel catalog. At two hours and 23 minutes, it’s one of the longest films on this list, but Avengers has held up well since its 2012 release. It is available to stream on Disney+ or rent on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n23. The Wiz (1978)\n\nThe Wiz is a joyful retelling of The Wizard of Oz featuring an all-Black cast. New twists on the old story include replacing Follow the Yellow Brick Road with Ease on Down the Road. Like the original, this one has a diva (Diana Ross) playing Dorothy.\n\nThe all-star cast also includes a young Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow, Richard Pryor as the Wizard of Oz, and Nipsey Russell as the Tin Man. The 1978 film is rated G and appropriate for ages 5 and up, though 7 and up are more likely to have the attention span for the two-hour, 16-minute movie. Kids will love the warm moments of friendship and excitement of going on a long journey. Though it wasn’t a critical hit when it was released, The Wiz is now considered a modern-day masterpiece and nostalgic favorite for many parents who watched it as children.\n\nDirector Sidney Lumet’s film is available to stream on Showtime, YouTube, fubo TV, the Roku Channel, Amazon Prime Video and Paramount+. You can rent The Wiz on AppleTV+, Vudu, Redbox or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n22. Lyle, Lyle Crocodile (2022)\n\nOne of the newest movies on the list, Lyle, Lyle Crocodile is directed by Josh Gordon and Will Speck and showcases pop superstar Shawn Mendes as Lyle, a singing crocodile with a taste for caviar. He befriends shy child Josh, and together they crusade against mean neighbor Alistair Grumps (what a name!).\n\nOther voice actors in the hybrid live action-animated film include Javier Bardem and Constance Wu. The sweet characters will draw in younger kids (it’s best for ages 6 and up), while the humor will keep older ones interested. With a run time of one hour, 46 minutes, Lyle is available to stream on Netflix, or you can rent it on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n21. Akeelah and the Bee (2006)\n\nPrecocious Akeelah (Keke Palmer) overcomes obstacle after obstacle, including objections from her widowed mother (Angela Bassett) and a rocky relationship with her coach (Laurence Fishburne), to qualify for the Scripps National Spelling Bee. Along the way, she learns to navigate grief over her father’s death and forge bonds with her peers.\n\nDoug Atchison wrote and directed the heartwarming film, which is rated PG and best for kids ages 10 and up who can stay engaged for the one-hour, 52-minute running time. It deals with important issues of race and class, which can provide entry points to insightful discussions with kids. The 2006 film is available on Showtime, Hulu, fubo TV, Sling, Paramount+, YouTube, the Roku Channel and Amazon Prime Video. You can rent Akeelah on Vudu, AppleTV+ or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n20. The Lego Movie (2014)\n\nFor a feel-good, high-energy, super-fun time, you can’t beat the 2014 animated film The Lego Movie, which follows an everyday Lego man (voiced by Chris Pratt) who’s forced to save his world after a case of mistaken identity. The movie also introduces Will Arnett’s entertaining Batman, who later received a spinoff film.\n\nDirectors Chris Miller and Phil Lord spin a happy, creative Lego universe, but some darker undertones near the end of the PG-rated film make this better for ages 8 and up. Critics and audiences alike adored the film, which earned an impressive 96% Rotten Tomatoes rating. With a run time of one hour, 35 minutes, Lego is available to stream on Max and Amazon Prime Video, while you can rent it on Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube, Redbox or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n19. Spy Kids (2001)\n\nThere are now five movies in the Spy Kids franchise, which began with the fan-favorite original in 2001. It follows the Cortez kids, whose parents (Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino) are former spies. The children are forced to save mom and dad when an evil blast from the past resurfaces.\n\nRobert Rodriguez directed the critical and box office hit, which was praised for its clever upending of traditional spy movie tropes. Kids 6 and up will enjoy the action and adventure of the PG-rated, one-hour, 28-minute film, while parents will appreciate the focus on how to balance your pre-kids self with your post-kids self. It’s available on Pluto TV and Netflix to stream, and you can rent Spy on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube, Redbox or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n18. The Greatest Showman (2017)\n\nHow about another musical? The instant-classic 2017 film, which features memorable songs such as This Is Me and The Other Side, stars Hugh Jackman as real-life showman P.T T . Barnum, showing his rise from nothing to creating the fabled circus and navigating the fame and fortune it brings. Michelle Williams stands out as his wife.\n\nDirector Michael Gracey effortlessly blends drama and over-the-top pageantry, sticking partly to the facts of Barnum’s story while embellishing some other areas. Zendaya also shines as a (Black) performer who falls in love with a (white) Barnum protégé and is forced to navigate the racism of the 1800s. That could inspire great discussions with kids about how far we’ve come but also how far we have to go in fighting discrimination. Rated PG, the movie runs one hour, 45 minutes and is best suited for kids 10 and up because of the more sophisticated themes.\n\nYou can view Showman with a subscription to Disney+, Hulu, fubo TV or Sling, or you can rent it on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n17. Spirited Away (2001)\n\nAnother animated film about a girl coping with an unwanted move, 2001’s Spirited Away has a unique fantasy element that gives the Japanese film its beating heart. Ten-year-old Chihiro must fight to return her parents to human form after a witch turns them into pigs. The original version includes subtitles, and there’s an English-dubbed edition.\n\nTweens and teens will identify with Chihiro’s quest to stand up for her family and navigate an unfair world on her own. The PG-rated film, which runs two hours and five minutes and was directed by Studio Ghibli great Hayao Miyazaki, received exceptional reviews for its clean animation and singular storyline. Rumi Hiiragi voices the main character in Japanese, while Daveigh Chase stepped in for the English dubbing. You can watch Spirited on Max and Amazon Prime or rent it on Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n16. Are We There Yet? (2005)\n\nIce Cube as a short-fused single guy trying to impress a woman by taking her mischievous kids on a long road trip? Yes, please. The rapper-turned-actor’s natural charisma and the fun slapstick humor make this PG-rated film perfect for kids 8 and up.\n\nDirector Brian Levant’s film, released in 2005, was so popular, it sparked a 2007 sequel, Are We Done Yet? The film is the perfect length for a weekday movie night at one hour, 35 minutes, and Tracy Morgan provides further comic relief as Satchel Paige. The film is streaming on Max, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video, and it is for rent on Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n15. The Nutty Professor (1996)\n\nEddie Murphy makes his second appearance on the list with this remake of the 1963 Jerry Lewis classic. Murphy plays a brilliant professor who invents a weight loss drug and tests it on himself, with dire (yet hilarious) consequences. Jada Pinkett Smith plays his love interest.\n\nDirected by Tom Shadyac, The Nutty Professor provides a platform for Murphy’s incredible talents to shine, as he also portrays all but one member of the professor’s family. The raucous comedy is rated PG-13 and is best for teens. It is available to stream on Peacock or rent on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube, Redbox or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n14. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005)\n\nImagine a pair of pants that can fit young women of all different sizes like a glove—and help give them the confidence to realize their dreams and maintain their strong connections, no matter where they go. That’s the plot of The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, a 2005 release with an all-star cast.\n\nAmerica Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn, Blake Lively and Alexis Bledel play best friends who share a pair of magical pants that keep them bonded as they figure out their life paths. The romantic comedy, rated PG, is best for kids 10 and above who will relate to the coming-of-age plotlines and sit through the two-hour, five-minute run time for director Ken Kwapis’s film. It is available to rent on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, Redbox, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n13. Hidden Figures (2016)\n\nMovies can make history come to life, as in this based-on-a-true-story film about the Black women who worked at NASA on John Glenn’s launch into orbit. The critically acclaimed box office smash stars Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe and was directed by Theodore Melfi.\n\nHidden Figures offers a way to discuss people’s behind-the-scenes contributions to some of the most famous scientific, mathematical and artistic achievements—and why those people often do not receive the credit they deserve. The movie is rated PG and appropriate for ages 8 and up, with a run time of two hours and five minutes. You can watch the 2016 film on Disney+, fubo TV, Hulu or Sling. You can also rent it on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n12. Clueless (1995)\n\nAs if we could leave this ‘90s favorite off the list! Director Amy Heckerling’s interpretation of the Jane Austen tale Emma follows Beverly Hills princess Cher on her quest to find the perfect boyfriend, maintain her A average and get her driver’s license while navigating the horrors of high school.\n\nAlicia Silverstone is pitch perfect as the main character, and the 1995 movie features Paul Rudd in one of his first significant roles. With a run time of one hour, 37 minutes and a PG-13 rating, Clueless is perfect for tweens and teens, who will appreciate Cher’s frustration (and affection) for her equally clueless dad. You can stream it on Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+, Pluto TV and the Roku Channel. You can also rent Clueless on Redbox, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n11. A Wrinkle in Time (2018)\n\nAva DuVernay’s 2018 adaptation of the beloved Madeliene L’Engle novel follows young Meg on a quest into space to find her father, a scientist who disappeared five years ago. She undertakes the epic journey with the help of astral travelers played by the all-star lineup of Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling and Reese Witherspoon.\n\nDuVernay’s direction earned critical kudos, and the PG-rated film with a two-hour run time did well at the box office. It’s best for kids 8 and older who can appreciate science fiction and fantasy themes. You can stream Wrinkle on Disney+ or rent it on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\nTop 10 Family-Friendly Movies\n\nAll the movies on this list are worth a watch, but the following 10 stand out because of their universal appeal, outstanding direction, critical kudos and ability to stand the test of time. All of them were released at least a decade ago, proving their longstanding appeal.\n\nThey all deal with themes as relevant today as they were a generation or two ago, including the desire to belong, the urge to find your purpose, and the value of friendship. You can’t go wrong with any of these 10 best family-friendly movies.\n\n10. The Princess Bride (1987)\n\nBelieve it or not, when The Princess Bride was released, the film starring Robin Wright and Cary Elwes was not an immediate hit. It took audiences a couple years to warm to the offbeat tale of Princess Buttercup and her devoted true love. The romance became a cult favorite and slowly gained widespread acclaim.\n\nIt turns the fairy tale concept on its head, with quirky characters and offbeat subplots that add to its charm. The PG-rated comedy-adventure directed by Rob Reiner runs one hour, 38 minutes, and it’s best for kids ages 8 and up, who will catch the clever references and sly humor. Bride is available to stream on Disney+ or you can rent it on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube, Redbox or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n9. Remember the Titans (2000)\n\nAnother dramatization of a true story, Remember the Titans chronicles the then-controversial integration of a high school football team in northern Virginia in the 1970s. Denzel Washington plays the tough but fair coach of the squad challenged with bringing white and Black players together for the first time.\n\nThe moving story shows their ups and downs on the way to a once-in-a-lifetime season, as directed by Boaz Yakin. The 2000 film’s cast boasts lots of familiar faces, including a young Ryan Gosling and Hayden Panettiere. It opens the door to meaningful conversations about race, making the PG-rated film ideal for kids ages 8 and up. With a run time of two hours, the critically lauded movie can be streamed on Disney+ or rented on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n8. The Sandlot (1993)\n\nComing-of-age tales don’t get much better than this: When Scottie Smalls (yes, he of the “you’re killing me, Smalls!” catchphrase) moves to a new town in 1962, he joins a ragtag group of baseball players for a summer of stealing bases, swimming and eventually facing down the neighborhood’s most feared baseball-collecting dog.\n\nThe film did fine at the box office but has really taken off since its 1993 release, becoming a universally embraced and oft-quoted classic. Most of the child stars never achieved widespread fame, but established actors Denis Leary, Karen Allen and James Earl Jones appear in the movie, directed by David Mickey Evans. Kids 6 and up will enjoy the PG-rated film, which runs one hour, 42 minutes. You can stream it on Hulu or rent it on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+ or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n7. The Parent Trap (1998)\n\nThough we’re highlighting the critically acclaimed 1998 film starring Lindsay Lohan and not the 1961 movie starring Hayley Mills, both are worthy additions to your movie night. Lohan portrays twins separated at birth who meet at camp and hatch a plan to bring their divorced parents back together.\n\nThe 1998 film directed by Nancy Meyers preserves the wholesome tone of the original. That combined with the PG rating and two-hour, eight-minute run time make it best for kids 7 and up, who will appreciate living out the fantasy of discovering a long-lost twin. You can stream the film on Disney+ or rent it on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n6. Father of the Bride (1991)\n\nThe remake of the 1950 movie captures the sometimes-strained, always-adoring relationship between a father and his daughter during one of the most exciting times of their lives: a wedding. When Annie returns from studying abroad engaged, father George is skeptical yet eventually warms to the big lift change.\n\nCharles Shyer directed the movie, which was so popular it spawned a sequel and another remake. Stars Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Martin Short and Kimberly Williams-Paisley share delightful chemistry in the PG-rated Bride, which kids ages 8 and up will appreciate. The one-hour, 45-minute film is streaming on Hulu and Sling, or you can rent it on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n5. E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)\n\nDirector Steven Spielberg makes another appearance on the list with the classic about an alien who connects with a boy and asks for his help to return home. Unfortunately, some sketchy government operatives want to keep E.T. (the titular extra-terrestrial) on this planet for their own gain.\n\nThe 1982 film featured a star-making turn by a young Drew Barrymore, and it was a massive success at the box office as well as among critics. Rated PG, E.T. tells a powerful story about found families and how we define our loyalties, and it’s best for kids ages 6 and up. You can watch the movie on Peacock or rent it on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube, Redbox or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n4. Mamma Mia (2008)\n\nIt may be physically impossible to listen to the spirited songs from this 2008 film without singing along. Based on the stage play, Mamma Mia follows a woman (Meryl Streep) whose daughter of undetermined paternity is about to get married—and she wants to include her mystery dad in the ceremony.\n\nThe paternal possibilities include Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgård. Director Phyllida Lloyd balances fun, frivolous numbers with more emotionally resonant ones, resulting in a great time for older tweens and teens who can appreciate the more sophisticated themes. The PG-13-rated film received solid critical reviews, but then it has Streep, who could carry any movie. You can rent it on Redbox, Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n3. The Goonies (1985)\n\nHey, you guys, has there ever been a comedy-adventure quite like The Goonies? The answer is no. A group of kids trying to save their homes from developers go on the mother of all treasure hunts, encountering bad guys, booby traps and pirate ships before finding what they need.\n\nThe 1985 film directed by Richard Donner stars some of the biggest names of the 1980s, including Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, Martha Plimpton, recent Oscar winner Ke Huy Quan and Josh Brolin. It is rated PG and runs one hour, 54 minutes. The fun adventure has a few suspenseful moments, making it best for kids 8 and over. You can stream it on Amazon Prime Video and Sling or rent it on Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n2. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (2001)\n\nYou knew this movie would make the list! The first in the epic fantasy series about a boy wizard finding his footing after learning he has magical powers, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone features the epic origins of the Harry-Ron-Hermione trio who battle Voldemort for seven more films.\n\nThe 2001 movie runs two hours and 32 minutes and is rated PG. It is best for kids 8 and up because of the long run time and the complexity of the plot. You can then watch the entire series at future movie nights, though a warning that they get darker further into the series. Harry served as star-making turns for Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) and Emma Watson (Hermione). You can stream the movie on Max, Peacock or Amazon Prime Video, or you can rent it on Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\n1. The Incredibles (2004)\n\nThe animated 2004 movie about a family of undercover superheroes is the epitome of a film made to please young and old audiences. Kids will appreciate the humor and parents vs. kids standoff over using super powers; adults will nod along with observations about family life and getting older.\n\nWith a run time of one hour, 55 minutes, The Incredibles is on the longer side for an animated movie, but it moves quickly and is appropriate for kids ages 6 and up. The PG-rated film features the vocal talents of Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter and Samuel L. Jackson, as well as Brad Bird, who directed the film. You can stream it on Disney+ or rent it on Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, AppleTV+, YouTube or Google Play TV & Movies.\n\nFamily movie nights are about spending time together doing something you can all enjoy. Any of these movies can contribute to insightful discussions about life and maybe help you learn things about your family, all without having to get off the couch."
