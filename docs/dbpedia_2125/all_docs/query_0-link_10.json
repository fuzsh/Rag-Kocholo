A note with a lipstick trace stamp as well as handwritten info on the shooting date, time and entrance door was distributed to the front row concert-goers.\n\nShooting started around 6:00 p.m. on 16 June 1987 at Palais Omnisport de Paris-Bercy, Paris, France and lasted until around 3:00 a.m. with a food break in the middle for which tables were set up. During the break Prince performed a 10 minute drum solo."
