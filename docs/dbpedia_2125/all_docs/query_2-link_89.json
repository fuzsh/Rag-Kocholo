        "text": "This one really does sound to me like it could have easily fit on 1999 - I can definitely hear a kinship with Automatic and DMSR. Again I love the interaction with the guitar and synths (I'm usually not a fan of synths, but I love the emotion and organic ness Prince gets out of them). The driving synth adds a frisson and urgency - underscoring the pent-up sexuality of the lyrics. 4/5\n\nIt was also released as an A-side, later.\n\nI love Drive Me Wild!\n\nJust like Make-Up, this is somewhat influenced by Gary Numan. The cold synth and robotic-like vocals by Susan are perfect for this song. Prince made a good choice to give her these type of songs. As far as I know, these songs were recorded while Susan was Prince's main girlfriend, so he made sure she had good songs. Her, limited, vocal abilities suit the song well.\n\nThe re-recorded 12” is even better. The 7” is an edit of that re-recording.\n\nThe song was the opening for their show with all the members singing.\n\nThis is a 4 out of 5 for me.\n\nSame goes for the 12” and 7” versions.\n\nDrive Me Wild is a 4 for me\n\nSusan’s voice is coldly alluring, and the synth programming is masterful, somehow funky and robotic at the same time.\n\nEven Prince fans can take his various talents for granted sometimes. For instance, what other best-of-all-time level guitarist was also one of the best drum machine programmers and synth arrangers ever?\n\nThis is a Jam, and kudos to Dave Grohl for recognizing that.\n\nYes but in a good way! She knows how to scream in the Prince style (\"for love...YEEEOW!\") which I think is fantastic. Love the Jill Jones album personally, with the only weak spot being With You. Agree with you about Ice Cream Castles and Pandemonium. I would probably rate What Time Is It higher overall than Vanity 6, but we'll see how it plays out.\n\n3x2=6 is going to affect the average for me!\n\n-George\n\nI saw that in Prince vault but I could swear I hear her in the mix of several Apollonia 6 songs. I would definitely have thought it was her in Happy Birthday Mr Christian but Prince Vault says it is Susannah....\n\n-George\n\nThe Gary Numan comparisons are obvious here, yet Prince is certainly putting his own unique spin on that sound. I like \"Drive Me Wild\" but while the groove is great it just doesn't have the killer hooks of something like Numan's \"Cars\". It does however have better hooks than all but one or two tracks on his own first two LPs, and it's at least as good as most of Dirty Mind. The vocal works for what it is, but is probably too dull - as are the lyrics - to support the extended version's runtime. I do like some of the additions made to the extended version, but 2:30 is about all something this slight can sustain.\n\nI'd give either version a 3/5 because of that tradeoff, but it's a strong 3.\n\nThe video has a crazy-long intro, a minute and a half. I played this the other day on YouTube and started to wonder if this was an instrumental...\n\nDrive Me Wild-Sorry, I gave this Song 5 Listens to see if it might get better to me, but I just find it boring. To quote Denise Matthews on ‘Nasty Girl’, “Is that it? Umm Wake me when you're done.”\n\nI rate this Song a Weak 2(again only will use a 1 rating, if I hate a Song).\n\n\"Drive Me Wild\" is another winner on Vanity 6. Susan's talk-singing is very sexy and while the lyrics aren't anything particularly special, the computerized synth beat is an interesting diversion for Prince. He never really went into this area on his own albums, at least that I can remember. I prefer the 12\" extended version overall but the short LP version has a spartan sound that works well to place the focus on the vocals. The 12\" version does sound more \"Princely\" with the drum machine and rhythm guitar/guitar solo.\n\nLP version: 3.6/5\n\n12\" version: 3.8/5\n\nToday's song is \"He's So Dull\", written by Dez Dickerson (and credited to Dez Dickerson and Vanity) and produced by Dez Dickerson.\n\nLyric.\n\nThe song was released as a B-side on the Nasty Girl single and an A-side single in 7\"and a 4'05\" 12\" version. It also featured in the classic Hollywood comedy Vacation.\n\nUnlike the last song the 7 inch and album version seems to be edited down versions of the 12 inch version and not completely re-recorded.\n\nI'll link to the 12-inch Long Mix below.\n\nIt charted at #92 and #44 in Australia and the Netherlands, respectively. Unusually, Prince is merely a session musician on this song, as it was written and produced by his long-term guitarist Dez Dickerson.\n\nVanity: lead vocal\n\nBrenda Bennett: backing vocal\n\nSusan Moonsie: backing vocal\n\nDez Dickerson: guitar and drums\n\nPrince: all other instruments\n\nI enjoy it, much like I enjoyed the other Dez Dickerson song we discussed \"After Hi School.\" It's a refreshing bit of pop/rock in the middle of this electrofied funk and though it's certainly less impressive than the other songs we've discussed it does offer a breath of a different kind of humor.\n\nWhat strikes me is that the song, unlike the other songs, seems really geared towards the same high school teen experience of \"After Hi School\" and thus is slightly incongruous in this very adult NC-17 rated album. But I still think it's irresistible.\n\n3.5/5\n\nThe 12-inch mix, however, manages to take a cute idea and nearly ruin it -- very boring aerobics music after the initial bit of the song.\n\n2.5/5 for the 12-inch mix."
