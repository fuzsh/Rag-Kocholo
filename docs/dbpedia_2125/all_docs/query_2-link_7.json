It’s no different to moving a needle or hitting skip on a CD player. HITNRUN Phase One is only a song short of 40 minutes.\n\nBut there are 11 songs for 38 minutes, so an average of about 3 minutes by songs. So that maximises the chance of a casual listener listening to it without him getting too bored and skip a song.\n\nThat's the common strategy used nowadays by many popular artists whose \"sales\" Comes mostly from streaming.\n\nRODSERLING\n\nVannormal said:\n\nSoulAlive said:\n\n\"Temptation\" is a terrible song.I hardly ever listen to it.\n\nWell, it's a fantastic song to me.\n\nI never ever skip it.\n\nIt ends in fear and desperation... as he says 'goodbye'.\n\nFantastic creepy ass song to me.\n\n\"Goodbye\", and remember it was supposed to be the end of his career.\n\nAfter founding the ladder, and understood that love was more important than sex, one cycle was over.\n\nHe came back only because he found out the reason for all that April's Snow, amd then became more spiritual.\n\ndonnadiavolo\n\nRODSERLING said:\n\n\"Goodbye\", and remember it was supposed to be the end of his career.\n\nAfter founding the ladder, and understood that love was more important than sex, one cycle was over.\n\nHe came back only because he found out the reason for all that April's Snow, amd then became more spiritual.\n\nReally?! I’ve never heard that before. What’s the story behind what was meant to be “the end of his career”?\n\nWe are the flowers growin' in God's garden\n\nAnd that is why he spreads the shit around\n\ndonnadiavolo\n\ncoldcoffeeandcocacola said:\n\ndonnadiavolo said:\n\nI'm shocked to know Temptation sits on 695k plays. It is the least played track on ATWIAD, but I get it; it's like drinking a cool glass of water after eating some pineapple. And while I'm at it, is I Wanna Melt With U really that bad? 480k plays?\n\nI love eye wanna melt with you it's such a fun song... it's crazy to me it wasn't going to be on the finished track list\n\nIf it weren’t on the album we’d probably be listening to it in solid potato quality right now\n\nWe are the flowers growin' in God's garden\n\nAnd that is why he spreads the shit around\n\nVannormal\n\nRODSERLING said:\n\nVannormal said:\n\nWell, it's a fantastic song to me.\n\nI never ever skip it.\n\nIt ends in fear and desperation... as he says 'goodbye'.\n\nFantastic creepy ass song to me.\n\n\"Goodbye\", and remember it was supposed to be the end of his career. After founding the ladder, and understood that love was more important than sex, one cycle was over. He came back only because he found out the reason for all that April's Snow, amd then became more spiritual.\n\nAll ever so true.\n\n-\n\nActually, how many times did Prince officialy announced that he would stop ?\n\nThere are at least a few times that I remember... from back in the days.\n\nAaahhhhhhh, back in the dayzzz.\n\nWhen Prince was mad as fuck, and we all took it the way it came.\n\n\"The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves. And wiser people so full of doubts\" (Bertrand Russell 1872-1972)\n\nVannormal\n\nRODSERLING said:\n\nleecaldon said:\n\nNot sure exactly how long someone has to listen for before it's considered a play, but it's not the whole song.\n\nGood point, but when you're not familiar with the artist, yyou see a 9 min song, ythat s a trial. You d rather try a shorter song Of course, Temptation is not Purple Rain. There was a reason why Prince made hit amd run 1 so short : it was his first album on streaming. He wanted to be sure people went to the end of the album amd the songs.\n\n\"albums matter, like black lives...\"\n\n-\n\nStreaming... I believe Prince didn't get that quite right imho.\n\nYet he wanted an album to be heard as an album, by making a short one for streaming ?\n\nNaaaah, nope.\n\n-\n\nMy nephew, 14yo, first gives a quick few seconds spin of each track on an album of his most favorite artist.\n\nThen he quickly selects some for his playlist, dletes te rest, thus never listens to that album again - ...is what he told me.\n\n''Why should I'', he said, \"when the rest is crap...\"\n\nQuick consumerism is a term he did not wanted to hear about, when I tried to explained that to him.\n\n...and I felt old. Very old.\n\n\"The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves.

I love how his voice fluctuates on the track, then his screaming like his mind’s in a straitjacket.\n\nI just long for a better masterred version.\n\nThe one on the LP and CD are so loud, and also not well mixed.\n\nSame for Raspberry Beret and a few others...\n\nLove that album by the way.\n\nReally do.\n\n\"The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves. And wiser people so full of doubts\" (Bertrand Russell 1872-1972)\n\nMickyDolenz\n\ncoldcoffeeandcocacola said:\n\nAll of them I just saw the figures for the modern rappers and the likes of cardi b ....oh no no no\n\nSomebody currently popular is always going to be bigger than oldies artists. It's not like Al Jolson & The Andrews Sisters was a thing for the 1980s MTV audience. There's some oldies songs that are currently big though, because they are used a lot in movies, TV shows, video games, commercials, etc. Such as:\n\nA-ha ~ Take On Me\n\nRick Astley ~ Never Gonna Give You Up\n\nMichael Jackson ~ Billie Jean\n\nWham! ~ Last Christmas\n\nMarvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell ~ Ain't No Mountain High Enough\n\nEarth Wind & Fire ~ September / Boogie Wonderland\n\nMC Hammer ~ U Can't Touch This\n\nQueen ~ Bohemian Rhapsody\n\nKool & The Gang ~ Celebration\n\nWhitney Houston ~ I Will Always Love You\n\nYou can take a black guy to Nashville from right out of the cotton fields with bib overalls, and they will call him R&B. You can take a white guy in a pin-stripe suit who’s never seen a cotton field, and they will call him country. ~ O. B. McClinton"
