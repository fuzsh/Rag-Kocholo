        "text": "Step into the enchanted world of Broadway's classic, Disney's Beauty and the Beast, an international sensation that has been produced in 37 countries worldwide. Based on the Academy Award-winning animated feature, the stage version includes all of the wonderful songs written by Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman, along with new songs by Mr. Menken and Tim Rice. The original Broadway production ran for over thirteen years and was nominated for nine Tony Awards, including Best Musical.\n\nThe classic story tells of Belle, a young woman in a provincial town, and the Beast, who is really a young prince trapped under the spell of an enchantress. If the Beast can learn to love and be loved, the curse will end and he will be transformed into his former self. But time is running out. If the Beast does not learn his lesson soon, he and his household will be doomed for all eternity.\n\nThis \"tale as old as time\" is filled with spectacular costume and set opportunities or, even more simply staged, Disney's Beauty and the Beast offers a great opportunity to bring your entire community together for family theatre at its best.\n\nAll performances of Disney’s Beauty and the Beast in North America must be performed by December 31, 2024. Any requests for performances taking place after December 31, 2024 will be denied. Learn more below.\n\nTemporary Licensing Restrictions in North America\n\nLicensing for both Disney’s Beauty and the Beast and Disney’s Beauty and the Beast JR. will have certain temporary restrictions in North America.

The character of Monsieur D’Arque has been trimmed to emphasize Gaston’s character and to cut run time of show.\n\n\"The Battle” between the villages and the enchanted objects at the end of Act 2 is now cut from the show.\n\nThe character(s) formerly named Silly Girls has been updated to Les Filles De La Ville.\n\nOptional cuts for dance breaks are now available for certain numbers. The options are clearly outlined in the production handbook (Music Direction chapter) and the Piano/Conductor score.\n\nProduction Handbook\n\nEnjoy this free downloadable Production Handbook.\n\nWatch our Town Hall \"Reimagining Disney Classics: Beauty and the Beast\"\n\nWatch the Town Hall here.\n\nEnjoy the videos featured in the Town Hall here."
