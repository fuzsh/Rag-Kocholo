        "text": "E.T.Katy Perry\n\nKaty Perry's song \"E.T.\" came from a beat originally intended for the rap group Three Six Mafia. When her producer accidentally pulled up the beat, Perry asked to use it.\n\nMan On the MoonR.E.M.\n\n\"Man On The Moon\" by R.E.M. is about the comedian Andy Kaufman, who often seemed like he was from another planet.\n\nOne DanceDrake\n\nDrake's \"One Dance\" was the first ever song to rack up one billion streams on Spotify.\n\nVenusShocking Blue\n\nThe original \"Venus\" was a #1 hit for the Dutch band Shocking Blue. Listen to the first line and you'll hear a muffed word: \"goddess\" was sung as \"goddness.\"\n\nPretty In PinkThe Psychedelic Furs\n\n\"Pretty In Pink\" by Psychedelic Furs was released in 1981. Five years later, it inspired a movie of the same name starring Molly Ringwald, Andrew McCarthy and Jon Cryer. The song was remixed for the re-release to have more Pop appeal.\n\nLike a Rolling StoneBob Dylan\n\nBob Dylan's most popular song is \"Like A Rolling Stone,\" which tells the story of a wealthy woman whose money and friends fall away. Dylan offers these mockingly encouraging words: \"When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.\"\n\nBill Medley of The Righteous BrothersSongwriter Interviews\n\nMedley looks back on \"Unchained Melody\" and \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" - his huge hits from the '60s that were later revived in movies.\n\nJesus Thinks You're a Jerk: Rock vs. TelevangelistsSong Writing\n\nWhen televangelists like Jimmy Swaggart took on rockers like Ozzy Osbourne and Metallica, the rockers retaliated. Bono could even be seen mocking the preachers.\n\nWeezerFact or Fiction\n\nDid Rivers Cuomo grow up on a commune? Why did they name their albums after colors? See how well you know your Weezer in this Fact or Fiction."
