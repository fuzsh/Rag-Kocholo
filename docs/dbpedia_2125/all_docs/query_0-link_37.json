Balancing perfectly between the small screen and big screen, this cultural icon proudly became the first Black cast member on Bravo's \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" (2020). Cementing her status as a media queen, she released a memoir titled Love Me as I Am (Harper Collins) about life, love, and the pursuit of true happiness. It quickly rose in the ranks, landing in the #1 spot on Amazon and garnering a great deal of press attention including Good Morning America, Nightline, and PEOPLE Magazine. Most recently she expanded her empire to include a home line with HSN called \"Garcelle at Home.\" Garcelle has expanded her career with a Lifetime partnership to executive producer original titles, including most recently the award-winning film \"Black Girl Missing\" (2023) and it's second installment \"Abducted at an HBCU: A Black Girl Missing Movie\" (July 20, 2024) and \"Terry McMillan Presents: Tempted By Love\" (August 17, 2024).\n\nA look back at Garcelle's career shows a hybrid of businesswoman and mother who has been a cherished face in Hollywood for over three decades. She got her start in 90s comedies \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" and \"The Jamie Foxx Show.\" She went on to appear in television on series such as SyFy's \"The Magicians,\" NBC's \"Chicago Med,\" \"NYPD Blue,\" \"Franklin & Bash,\" HBO's \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" \"Arrested Development,\" \"Power\" on Starz and many others.

The book series was re-released in April 2020 for its fifth anniversary. Garcelle is an ambassador for Cybersmile, a multi-award-winning nonprofit organization committed to digital well being and tackling all forms of bullying and abuse online and she also supports the Step Up Women's Network, a national non-profit that empowers women and girls to be strong and reach their full potential.

Nikki is probably most recognized as the bitchy cheerleader \"Whitney\" in the blockbuster mega-hit BRING IT ON, starring Kirsten Dunst.\n\n\"I am an actress who is Asian-American.

It is a non-ethnic specific role AND the female lead. Being marked by critics as \"The St. Elmo's Fire of this generation\"- LA Weekly, the film received numerous awards at all the film festivals both nationwide and internationally.

Up next...You will be able to see Nikki as \"Lisa Lawson\" in the upcoming holiday rom- com, CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF CHRISTMAS, premiering this holiday season 2022!\n\nA native of New Jersey and son of a mechanic, African-American John Amos has relied on his imposing build, eruptive nature and strong, forceful looks to obtain acting jobs, and a serious desire for better roles to earn a satisfying place in the annals of film and TV. He has found it a constant uphill battle to further himself in an industry that tends to diminish an actor's talents with severe and/or demeaning stereotypes and easy pigeonholing. A tough, often hot-headed guy with a somewhat tender side, John would succeed far better on stage than on film and TV...with one extremely noteworthy exceptions.\n\nBorn on December 27, 1939, John was first employed as an advertising copywriter, a social worker at New York's Vera Institute of Justice, and an American and Canadian semi-professional football player before receiving his calling as an actor. A stand-up comic on the Greenwich Village circuit, the work eventually took him West and, ultimately, led to his hiring as a staff writer on Leslie Uggams' musical variety show in 1969. Making his legit stage debut in a 1971 L.A. production of the comedy \"Norman, Is That You?\", John went on to earn a Los Angeles Drama Critics nomination for \"Best Actor\". As such, he formed his own theater company and produced \"Norman, Is That You?\" on tour.\n\nThe following year he returned to New York to take his first Broadway bow in \"Tough To Get Help\". By this time he had secured secondary work on the classic Oh Mary (1970) as Gordy the weatherman. His character remained on the periphery, however, and he left the show after three discouraging seasons. On the bright side, he won the recurring role of the sporadically-unemployed husband of maid Florida Evans (played by Esther Rolle) on Norman Lear's Maude (1972) starring Bea Arthur. The two characters were spun-off into their own popular series as the parental leads in Good Times (1974).\n\nGood Times (1974), a family sitcom that took place in a Chicago ghetto high-rise, initially prided itself as being the first network series ever to be created by African-Americans. But subsequent episodes were taken over by others and John was increasingly disgruntled by the lack of quality of the scripts and the direction Lear was taking the show. Once focused on the importance of family values, it was shifting more and more toward the silly antics of Jimmie 'JJ' Walker, who was becoming a runaway hit on the show as the aimless, egotistical, jive-talking teenage son JJ. John began frequently clashing with the higher-ups and, by 1976, was released from the series, with his character being killed in an off-camera car accident while finding employment out of state.\n\nAmos rebounded quickly when he won the Emmy-nominated role of the adult Kunte Kinte in the ground-breaking epic mini-series Roots: The Complete Miniseries (1977), one of the most powerful and reverential TV features ever to hit television. It was THE TV role of his career, but he found other quality roles for other black actors extremely difficult to come by. He tried his best to avoid the dim-headed lugs and crime-motivated characters that came his way. Along with a few parts (the mini-movie Willa (1979) and the films Beastmaster - Der Befreier (1982) and Der Prinz aus Zamunda (1988)), he had to endure the mediocre (guest spots on Love Boat (1977), \"The A-Team\", \"Murder, She Wrote\" \"One Life to Live\"). John also toiled through a number of action-themed films that focused more on grit and testosterone than talent.\n\nHe found one answer to this acting dilemma on the proscenium stage. In 1985, the play \"Split Second\" earned him the NAACP Award as Best Actor. He also received fine reviews in a Berkshire Theater festival production of \"The Boys Next Door\", a tour of O'Neill's towering play \"The Emperor Jones\", and in a Detroit production of Athol Fugard's \"Master Harold...and The Boys\". In addition, John directed two well-received productions, \"Miss Reardon Drinks a Little\" and \"Twelve Angry Men\", in the Bahamas. He took on Shakespeare as Sir Toby Belch in \"Twelfth Night\" at Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare and earned strong notices in the late August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play \"Fences\" at the Capital Repertory Company in Albany, New York. Overseas he received plaudits for his appearance in a heralded production of \"The Life and Death of a Buffalo Soldier\" at the Bristol's Old Vic in England. Capping his theatrical career was the 1990 inaugural of his one-man show \"Halley's Comet\", an amusing and humanistic American journey into the life of an 87-year-old who recalls, among other things, World War II, the golden age of radio, the early civil rights movement, and the sighting of the Comet when he was 11. He wrote and has frequently directed the show, which continues to play into the 2007-2008 season.\n\nIn recent years, John has enjoyed recurring parts on \"The West Wing\" and \"The District\", and is more recently appearing in the offbeat series Men in Trees (2006) starring Anne Heche. John Amos has two children by his former wife Noel Amos and two children. Son K.C. Amos director, writer, producer, editor and daughter Shannon Amos a director, writer and producer. Amos has one grand child,a grand-daughter, Quiera Williams.\n\nOften considered hip-hop's first lady, the woman behind the moniker Queen Latifah was born Dana Elaine Owens on March 18, 1970, in East Orange, New Jersey. She is the daughter of Rita (Bray), a teacher, and Lancelot Owens Sr. She came from a police family-both her father and her older brother were cops-which would later influence her rhyming style and life philosophy. Her brother died in a motorcycle accident in 1992. Owens witnessed both sides of black urban life in the USA while growing up. After a brief stint as a Burger King employee, she soon found herself making waves in the hip-hop music scene.\n\nAfter working as the human beatbox alongside Ladies Fresh, she was just 18 years old when she broke through in the late 1980s with a style that picked selectively from jazz, reggae, and soul traditions, from beats produced by D.J. Mark the 45 King. Her debut single, \"Wrath of My Madness,\" was released in 1988. A year later, her debut long-player, \"All Hail the Queen,\" enjoyed favored reviews: an old, wise head was evident on the top of her young shoulders. The former Burger King employee maintained her early commitment to answering the misogynist armory of some of her male counterparts and, at the same time, imparted musical good times to all genders. Her name means \"delicate and sensitive\" in Arabic, but she has often been anything but in her rhymes and the messages she sends out through them. One of the most prominent female hip-hop artists on the scene for over a decade, Queen Latifah has also made tremendous inroads in movies, television, and artist management, with her management company, Flavor Unit, alongside her business partner Shakim Compere. A role model who takes the responsibility to heart, Latifah has carefully constructed a fine career for herself-one that is constantly moving upward."
