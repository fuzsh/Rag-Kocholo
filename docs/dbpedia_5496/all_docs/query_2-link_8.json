Characterization of acute renal failure is based on serum creatinine level which is imprecise during and following surgery. Studies are based on various definitions of acute renal failure with different thresholds which skewed their comparisons. The RIFLE classification (risk, injury, failure, loss, end stage kidney disease) allows clinicians to distinguish in a similar manner between different stages of acute kidney injury rather than using a unique definition of acute renal failure. Acute renal failure during the perioperative period can mainly be explained by iatrogenic, hemodynamic or surgical causes and can result in an increased morbi-mortality. Prevention of this complication requires hemodynamic optimization (venous return, cardiac output, vascular resistance), discontinuation of nephrotoxic drugs but also knowledge of the different steps of the surgery to avoid further degradation of renal perfusion. Diuretics do not prevent acute renal failure and may even push it forward especially during the perioperative period when venous retourn is already reduced. Edema or weight gain following surgery are not correlated with the vascular compartment volume, much less with renal perfusion. Treatment of perioperative acute renal failure is similar to other acute renal failure. Renal replacement therapy must be mastered to prevent any additional risk of hemodynamic instability or hydro-electrolytic imbalance. Copyright Â© 2014 Association SociÃ©tÃ© de nÃ©phrologie.

To clarify diagnosis, the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative group stated its consensus on the need for a clear definition and classification system of renal dysfunction with measurable criteria. Today the term acute kidney injury has replaced the term acute renal failure, with an understanding that such injury is a common clinical problem in critically ill patients and typically is predictive of an increase in morbidity and mortality. A classification system, known as RIFLE (risk of injury, injury, failure, loss of function, and end-stage renal failure), includes specific goals for preventing acute kidney injury: adequate hydration, maintenance of renal perfusion, limiting exposure to nephrotoxins, drug protective strategies, and the use of renal replacement therapies that reduce renal injury.\n\nProfile, risk factors and outcome of acute kidney injury in paediatric acute-on-chronic liver failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nLal, Bikrant B; Alam, Seema; Sood, Vikrant; Rawat, Dinesh; Khanna, Rajeev\n\n2018-01-11\n\nThere are no studies on acute kidney injury in paediatric acute-on-chronic liver failure. This study was planned with aim to describe the clinical presentation and outcome of acute kidney injury among paediatric acute-on-chronic liver failure patients. Data of all children 1-18Â years of age presenting with acute chronic liver failure (Asia pacific association for the study of the liver definition) was reviewed. Acute kidney injury was defined as per Kidney Diseases-Improving Global Outcomes guidelines. Poor outcome was defined as death or need for liver transplant within 3Â months of development of acute kidney injury. A total of 84 children with acute-on-chronic liver failure were presented to us in the study period. Acute kidney injury developed in 22.6% of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. The median duration from acute-on-chronic liver failure to development of acute kidney injury was 4Â weeks (Range: 2-10Â weeks). The causes of acute kidney injury were hepatorenal syndrome (31.6%), sepsis (31.6%), nephrotoxic drugs (21%), dehydration (10.5%) and bile pigment related acute tubular necrosis in one patient. On univariate analysis, higher baseline bilirubin, higher international normalized ratio, higher paediatric end stage liver disease, presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and presence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis had significant association with presence of acute kidney injury. On logistic regression analysis, presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (adjusted OR: 8.659, 95% CI: 2.18-34.37, PÂ =Â .002) and higher baseline bilirubin (adjusted OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.008-1.135, PÂ =Â .025) were independently associated with presence of acute kidney injury. Of the patients with acute kidney injury, 5(26.3%) survived with native liver, 10(52.6%) died and 4 (21.1%) underwent liver transplantation.

These patients frequently develop concurrent acute kidney injury (AKI). This abrupt and sustained decline in renal function, through a number of pathogenic mechanisms such as renal hypoperfusion, direct drug-induced nephrotoxicity or sepsis/systemic inflammatory response contributes to increased morbidity and is strongly associated with a worse prognosis. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology AKI in the context of acute liver failure may be beneficial in a number of areas; the development of new and sensitive biomarkers of renal dysfunction, refining prognosis and organ allocation, and ultimately leading to the development of novel treatment strategies, these issues are discussed in more detail in this expert review.\n\nRisk factors and outcomes of acute kidney injury in patients with acute liver failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nTujios, Shannan R; Hynan, Linda S; Vazquez, Miguel A; Larson, Anne M; Seremba, Emmanuel; Sanders, Corron M; Lee, William M\n\n2015-02-01\n\nPatients with acute liver failure (ALF) frequently develop renal dysfunction, yet its overall incidence and outcomes have not been fully assessed. We investigated the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) among patients with ALF, using defined criteria to identify risk factors and to evaluate its effect on overall outcomes. We performed a retrospective review of data from 1604 patients enrolled in the Acute Liver Failure Study Group, from 1998 through 2010. Patients were classified by the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria, as well as for etiology of liver failure (acetaminophen-based, ischemic, and all others). Seventy percent of patients with ALF developed AKI, and 30% received renal replacement therapy (RRT). Patients with severe AKI had higher international normalized ratio values than those without renal dysfunction (P < .001), and a higher proportion had advanced-grade coma (coma grades 3 or 4; P < .001) or presented with hypotension requiring vasopressor therapy (PÂ < .001). A greater proportion of patients with acetaminophen-induced ALF had severe kidney injury than of patients with other etiologies of ALF; 34% required RRT, compared with 25% of patients with ALF not associated with acetaminophen or ischemia (P < .002). Of the patients with ALF who were alive at 3 weeks after study entry, significantly fewer with AKI survived for 1Â year. Although AKI reduced the overall survival time, more than 50% of patients with acetaminophen-associated or ischemic ALF survived without liver transplantation (even with RRT), compared with 19% of patients with ALF attribute to other causes (P < .001). Only 4% of patients requiring RRT became dependent on dialysis. Based on a retrospective analysis of data from more than 1600 patients, AKI is common in patients with ALF and affects short- and long-term outcomes, but rarely results in chronic kidney disease. Acetaminophen-induced kidney injury is frequent, but patients have better outcomes than those with other forms of\n\nHyperkalemia and acute kidney failure associated with preoperative uterine artery embolization for a large uterine fibroid: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nTanaka, Keiko; Koizumi, Toshimitsu; Higa, Takeru; Imai, Noriaki\n\n2016-11-01\n\nPreoperative uterine artery embolization has been shown to help reduce blood loss, with few complications. Most reports indicated that uterine artery embolization is safe for uterine fibrosis; the occurrence of hyperkalemia and acute kidney failure as complications of preoperative uterine artery embolization has not been reported previously. Here we report the occurrence of hyperkalemia and acute kidney failure after preoperative uterine artery embolization for a large uterine fibroid. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the occurrence of hyperkalemia and acute kidney failure after preoperative uterine artery embolization. A 48-year-old Japanese woman presented to our hospital complaining of compression in her abdomen and an abdominal mass. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large uterine fibroid measuring 37.5Ã27Ã13.5 cm. Therefore, we planned preoperative uterine artery embolization to help reduce blood loss. However, hyperkalemia and acute kidney failure occurred owing to the development of necrotic tissue after uterine artery embolization; therefore, emergency total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. She experienced 105 g of blood loss intraoperatively. The weight of her uterus was 10.8 kg and the volume was 9964 cm 3 , with extensive necrotic tissue. Her hyperkalemia and kidney failure resolved after the surgery. We reported the occurrence of serious complications, including hyperkalemia and acute kidney failure, after preoperative uterine artery embolization for a large uterine fibroid.\n\nAcute renal failure potentiates methylmalonate-induced oxidative stress in brain and kidney of rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchuck, P F; Alves, L; Pettenuzzo, L F; Felisberto, F; Rodrigues, L B; Freitas, B W; Petronilho, F; Dal-Pizzol, F; Streck, E L; Ferreira, G C\n\n2013-03-01\n\nTissue methylmalonic acid (MMA) accumulation is the biochemical hallmark of methylmalonic acidemia. The disease is clinically characterized by progressive neurological deterioration and kidney failure, whose pathophysiology is still unclear. In the present work we investigated the effects of acute MMA administration on various parameters of oxidative stress in cerebral cortex and kidney of young rats, as well as the influence of acute renal failure on MMA-elicited effects on these parameters. Acute renal failure was induced by gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic whose utilization over prolonged periods causes nephrotoxicity. The administration of gentamicin alone increased carbonyl content and inhibited superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in cerebral cortex, as well as increased thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBA-RS) and sulfhydryl levels and diminished glutathione peroxidase activity in kidney. On the other hand, MMA administration increased TBA-RS levels in cerebral cortex and decreased SOD activity in kidney. Furthermore, the simultaneous administration of MMA and gentamicin to the rats provoked an augment in TBA-RS levels and superoxide generation in cerebral cortex and in TBA-RS, carbonyl and sulfhydryl levels in kidney, while diminished SOD activity in both studied tissues. Finally, nitrate/nitrite content, reduced glutathione levels, 2',7'-dihydrodichlorofluorescein oxidation and catalase activity were not affected by this animal treatment in either tissue. In conclusion, our present data are in line with the hypothesis that MMA acts as a toxin in brain and kidney of rats and suggest that renal injury potentiates the toxicity of MMA on oxidative stress parameters in brain and peripheral tissues.\n\nAcute Kidney Injury in the Elderly\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAbdel-Kader, Khaled; Palevsky, Paul\n\n2009-01-01\n\nSynopsis The aging kidney undergoes a number of important anatomic and physiologic changes that increase the risk of acute kidney injury (formerly acute renal failure) in the elderly. This article reviews these changes and discusses the diagnoses frequently encountered in the elderly patient with acute kidney injury. The incidence, staging, evaluation, management, and prognosis of acute kidney injury are also examined with special focus given to older adults.

Aim This nationwide family study aimed to determine familial risks for kidney failure in Sweden. Methods The Swedish multi-generation register on 0â78-year-old subjects were linked to the Swedish patient register and the Cause of death register for 1987â2010. Individuals diagnosed with acute kidney failure (nâ=â10063), chronic kidney failure (nâ=â18668), or unspecified kidney failure (nâ=â3731) were included. Kidney failure patients with cystic kidney disease, congenital kidney and urinary tract malformations, urolithiasis, and rare inherited kidney syndromes, and hyperoxaluria were excluded. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for individuals whose parents/siblings were diagnosed with kidney failure compared to those whose parents or siblings were not. Results The concordant (same disease) familial risks (sibling/parent history) were increased for chronic kidney failure SIRâ=â2.02 (95% confidence interval, CI 1.90â2.14) but not for acute kidney failure SIRâ=â1.08 (95% CI 0.94â1.22) and for unspecified kidney failure SIRâ=â1.25 (95% CI 0.94â1.63). However, the discordant (different disease) familial risk for acute kidney failure SIRâ=â1.19 (95% CI 1.06â1.32) and unspecified kidney failure SIRâ=â1.63 (95% CI 1.40â1.90) was significantly increased in individuals with a family history of chronic kidney failure. The familial risk for chronic kidney failure was similar for males SIRâ=â2.04 (95% CI 1.90â2.20) and females SIRâ=â1.97 (95% CI 1.78â2.17). Familial risks for chronic kidney failure were highest at age of 10â19 years SIRâ=â6.33 (95% CI 4.16â9.22). Conclusions The present study shows that family history is an important risk factor for chronic kidney failure but to a lower degree for acute kidney failure and unspecified kidney failure.

In acute presentations, both brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) offer high sensitivity (>90 %) and negative predictive values (>95 %) for ruling out ADHF at thresholds of 100 and 300 pg/ml, respectively. Plasma NP rise with age. For added rule-in performance age-adjusted thresholds (450 pg/ml for under 50 years, 900 pg/ml for 50â75 years and 1,800 pg/ml for those >75 years) can be applied to NT-proBNP results. Test performance (specificity and accuracy but not sensitivity) is clearly reduced by renal dysfunction and atrial fibrillation. Obesity offsets the threshold downwards (to ~50 pg/ml for BNP), but overall discrimination is preserved. Reliable markers for impending acute kidney injury in ADHF constitute an unmet need, with candidates, such as kidney injury molecule-1 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, failing to perform sufficiently well, and new possibilities, including the cell cycle markers insulin growth factor binding protein 7 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases type 2, remain the subject of research.

In order to solve the problem of organ shortage, the selection criteria for kidney donors have been less stringent over the last years. Favorable outcome of renal transplantation from deceased donors with acute renal failure requiring dialysis may have an important role in expanding the pool of donors. We present the case of two renal transplantations from a polytraumatized 20-years old donor with acute renal failure requiring dialysis. One recipient established good diuresis from the first post-transplant day and did not require hemodialysis. The second recipient had delayed graft function and was treated with 8 hemodialysis sessions. The patient was discharged with good diuresis and normal serum creatinine. After two years of follow-up, both recipients have normal graft function. According to our experience, kidneys from deceased young donors with acute renal failure requiring dialysis may be transplanted, in order to decrease the number of patients on transplantation waiting lists.\n\nEpidemiology and Outcome of Acute Kidney Injury According to Pediatric Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Criteria in Critically Ill Children-A Prospective Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nVolpon, Leila C; Sugo, Edward K; Consulin, Julio C; Tavares, Tabata L G; Aragon, Davi C; Carlotti, Ana P C P\n\n2016-05-01\n\nWe aimed to investigate the epidemiology, risk factors, and short- and medium-term outcome of acute kidney injury classified according to pediatric Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease, and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria in critically ill children. Prospective observational cohort study. Two eight-bed PICUs of a tertiary-care university hospital. A heterogeneous population of critically ill children. None. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were collected on all patients admitted to the PICUs from August 2011 to January 2012, with at least 24 hours of PICU stay. Of the 214 consecutive admissions, 160 were analyzed. The prevalence of acute kidney injury according to pediatric Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria was 49.4% vs. 46.2%, respectively. A larger proportion of acute kidney injury episodes was categorized as Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stage 3 (50%) compared with pediatric Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease F (39.2%). Inotropic score greater than 10 was a risk factor for acute kidney injury severity. About 35% of patients with acute kidney injury who survived were discharged from the PICU with an estimated creatinine clearance less than 75âmL/min/1.73 m and one persisted with altered renal function 6 months after PICU discharge. Age 12 months old or younger was a risk factor for estimated creatinine clearance less than 75âmL/min/1.73 m at PICU discharge. Acute kidney injury and its severity were associated with increased PICU length of stay and longer duration of mechanical ventilation. Eleven patients died; nine had acute kidney injury (p < 0.05). The only risk factor associated with death after multivariate adjustment was Pediatric Risk of Mortality score greater than or equal to 10.

From January 2012 to December 2016, 30 kidneys from 15 deceased donors with severe rhabdomyolysis and ARF were accepted for transplantation at our center. The peak serum creatinine (SCr) kinase, myoglobin, and SCr of the these donors were 15Â 569Â±8597Â U/L, 37Â 092Â±42Â 100Â Î¼g/L, and 422Â±167Â Î¼mol/L, respectively. Two donors received continuous renal replacement therapy due to anuria. Six kidneys exhibited a discolored appearance (from brown to glossy black) due to myoglobin casts. The kidney transplant results from the donors with rhabdomyolysis donors were compared with those of 90 renal grafts from standard criteria donors (SCD). The estimated glomerular filtration rate at 2Â years was similar between kidney transplants from donors with rhabdomyolysis and SCD (70.3Â±14.6Â mL/min/1.73Â m 2 vs 72.3Â±15.1Â mL/min/1.73Â m 2 ). We conclude that excellent graft function can be achieved from kidneys donors with ARF caused by rhabdomyolysis. Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Retrospective cohort study. A 12-bed PICU at a tertiary referral center in Southern Brazil. All patients admitted to the study unit over a 1-year period. A database of all eligible patients was analyzed retrospectively. Patients were classified by pediatric-modified Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage renal disease score at admission and worst pediatric-modified Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage renal disease score during PICU hospitalization. The outcomes of interest were length of PICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of vasoactive drug therapy, and mortality. The Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 was used to assess overall disease severity at the time of PICU admission. Of 375 patients, 169 (45%) presented acute kidney injury at the time of admission and 37 developed acute kidney injury during PICU stay, for a total of 206 of 375 patients (55%) diagnosed with acute kidney injury during the study period. The median Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 score predicted a mortality rate of 9% among non-acute kidney injury patients versus a mortality rate of 16% among acute kidney injury patients (p = 0.006). The mortality of patients classified as pediatric-modified Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage renal disease F was double that predicted by Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 (7 vs 3.2). Patients classified as having severe acute kidney injury (pediatric-modified Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage renal disease I + F) exhibited higher mortality (14.1%; p = 0.001) and prolonged PICU length of stay (median, 7 d; p = 0.001) when compared with other patients. Acute kidney injury is a very frequent occurrence among patients admitted to PICUs.

The diagnosis is based on the increase in serum creatinine, which is delayed. It is necessary to identify and validate new biomarkers that allow for early and effective interventions. To assess the sensitivity and specificity of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in urine (uNGAL), interleukin-18 (IL-18) in urine and cystatin C in serum for the early detection of AKI in patients with acute coronary syndrome or heart failure, and who underwent cardiac surgery or catheterization. The study included 135 patients admitted to the intensive care unit for acute coronary syndrome or heart failure due to coronary or valvular pathology and who underwent coronary angiography or cardiac bypass surgery or valvular replacement. The biomarkers were determined 12 hours after surgery and serum creatinine was monitored during the next six days for the diagnosis of AKI. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for NGAL was 0.983, and for cystatin C and IL-18 the AUCs were 0.869 and 0.727, respectively. At a cut-off of 31.9 ng/ml for uNGAL the sensitivity was 100% and the specificity was 91%. uNGAL is an early marker of AKI in patients with acute coronary syndrome or heart failure and undergoing cardiac surgery and coronary angiography, with a higher predictive value than cystatin C or IL-18.\n\nAcute kidney injury and cardiovascular outcomes in acute severe hypertension.\n\nPubMed\n\nSzczech, Lynda A; Granger, Christopher B; Dasta, Joseph F; Amin, Alpesh; Peacock, W Frank; McCullough, Peter A; Devlin, John W; Weir, Matthew R; Katz, Jason N; Anderson, Frederick A; Wyman, Allison; Varon, Joseph\n\n2010-05-25\n\nLittle is known about the association of kidney dysfunction and outcome in acute severe hypertension. This study aimed to measure the association between baseline chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate), acute kidney injury (AKI, decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate > or =25% from baseline) and outcome in patients hospitalized with acute severe hypertension. The Studying the Treatment of Acute Hypertension (STAT) registry enrolled patients with acute severe hypertension, defined as > or =1 blood pressure measurement >180 mm Hg systolic and/or >110 mm Hg diastolic and treated with intravenous antihypertensive therapy. Data were compared across groups categorized by admission estimated glomerular filtration rate and AKI during admission. On admission, 79% of the cohort (n=1566) had at least mild chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min in 46%, <30 mL/min in 22%). Chronic kidney disease patients were more likely to develop heart failure (P<0.0001), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (P=0.003), and AKI (P<0.007). AKI patients were at greater risk of heart failure and cardiac arrest (P< or =0.0001 for both). Subjects with AKI experienced higher mortality at 90 days (P=0.003). Any acute loss of estimated glomerular filtration rate during hospitalization was independently associated with an increased risk of death (odds ratio, 1.05; P=0.03 per 10-mL/min decline). Other independent predictors of mortality included increasing age (P<0.0001), male gender (P=0.016), white versus black race (P=0.003), and worse baseline kidney function (P=0.003). Chronic kidney disease is a common comorbidity among patients admitted with acute severe hypertension, and AKI is a frequent form of acute target organ dysfunction, particularly in those with baseline chronic kidney disease. Any degree of AKI is associated with a greater risk of morbidity and mortality.\n\n[Acute kidney failure in infectious mononucleosis].\n\nPubMed\n\nRamelli, G P; Marone, C; Truniger, B\n\n1990-10-27\n\nOvert renal disease is a rare complication of infectious mononucleosis (MI).

There is ongoing evidence that central venous pressure (CVP) has a pivotal role in precipitating acute renal dysfunction in cardiac medical and surgical settings. We can regard this AKI driven by systemic venous hypertension as 'kidney congestive failure'. In the cardiac surgery population as a whole, when the CVP value reaches the threshold of 14 mmHg in postoperative period, the risk of AKI increases 2-fold with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.99, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 1.16-3.40. In cardiac surgery subsets where venous hypertension is a hallmark feature, the incidence of AKI is higher (tricuspid disease 30%, carcinoid valve disease 22%). Even in the non-chronically congested coronary artery bypass population, CVP measured 6 h postoperatively showed significant association to renal failure: risk-adjusted OR for AKI was 5.5 (95% CI 1.93-15.5; P = 0.001) with every 5 mmHg rise in CVP for patients with CVP <9 mmHg; for CVP increments of 5 mmHg above the threshold of 9 mmHg, the risk-adjusted OR for AKI was 1.3 (95% CI 1.01-1.65; P = 0.045). This and other clinical evidence are discussed along with the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, involving the supremacy of volume receptors in regulating the autonomic output in hypervolaemia, and the regional effect of venous congestion on the nephron. The effect of CVP on renal function was found to be modulated by ventricular function class, aetiology and acuity of venous congestion. Evidence suggests that acute increases of CVP should be actively treated to avoid a deterioration of the renal function, particularly in patients with poor ventricular fraction. Besides, the practice of treating right heart failure with fluid loading should be avoided in favour of other ways to optimize haemodynamics in this setting, because of the detrimental effects on the kidney function.

It occurs in around one-third of patients treated in intensive care unit (ICU) and is even more prevalent in cardiac surgery patients. There is a higher mortality in patients with AKI compared with non-AKI counterparts, and in severe AKI requiring renal support, the 6 month mortality is >50%. Unlike the progressive development of biomarkers in cardiology, there have been few changes in kidney diagnostic markers. Creatinine is still used as an indicator of kidney function but not of the parenchymal kidney injury. Serum creatinine (sCr) concentration does not change until around 50% of kidney function is lost, and varies with muscle mass, age, sex, medications, and hydration status. The lag time between injury and loss of function, risks missing a therapeutic opportunity, and may explain the high associated mortality. Novel biomarkers of AKI- and failure include neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, N-acetyl-Î²-d-glucosaminidase, kidney injury molecule-1, interleukin-18, and cystatin C. The pathophysiology associated with accumulation of these markers in plasma and urine is not clear, but a common denominator is inflammation. Some of these new AKI biomarkers may have clinical applicability in anaesthesia and intensive care in the future. It is possible that a 'kidney biomarker panel' will become standard before and after major surgery. If elevated or positive, the anaesthetist must take special care to optimize the patients after operation on the surgical wards or ICU to avoid further nephrotoxic insults and initiate supplementary care.\n\n[Diuretics in acute kidney failure: useful or harmful?].\n\nPubMed\n\nTataw, J; Saudan, P\n\n2011-03-02\n\nLoop diuretics are commonly prescribed within different clinical settings to prevent and or to treat acute renal failure. In most cases they facilitate fluid management following an increased urine output. Experimental models in animals revealed protective effects of loop diuretics in acute renal failure. Several clinical trials have failed to outline better outcomes associated with the use of diuretics in acute renal failure as there was no recovery in renal function nor a reduction in the number of dialysis sessions required. Glomerular filtration rate did not improve with the administration of loop diuretics after continuous renal replacement therapy. The administration of loop diuretics in the management of acute renal failure should be mainly restricted to patients with hypervolemia.\n\n[Acute renal failure due to obstructive ureteral stone associated with norovirus gastroenteritis in an infant with congenital solitary kidney].\n\nPubMed\n\nKato, Taiki; Hamano, Atsushi; Kawamura, Hideki\n\n2014-10-01\n\nWe report a 35 month-old boy with acute renal failure caused by an obstructive ureteral stone associated with norovirus gastroenteritis. He visited his family physician because of fever, abdominal pain and vomiting. He was diagnosed as acute gastroenteritis. The symptoms relieved once, but abdominal pain and vomiting recurred two days after the visit and the volume of urine decreased. He was diagnosed as norovirus gastoenteritis and acute renal failure which was unresponsive to fluid replacement. Ultrasound study of the abdomen showed a solitary kidney with mild hydronephrosis. He was then admitted to our hospital. He was finally diagnosed as acute postrenal failure due to obstructive ureteral stone with left solitary kidney by abdominal computer tomography (CT). We performed transurethral catheterization immediately. The creatinine and blood urea nitrogen returned to normal level in 2 days. The CT performed on the 28th day post operation showed disappearance of the stone after uric alkalization. Recently, some cases of postrenal failure due to bilateral obstructive ureteral stones, mainly ammonium acid urate stones, associated with viral gastroenteritis were reported. As clinical features, they are common in boys three years or younger after an episode of rotavirus gastroenteritis with high uric acid concentration. By far, the most common cause of acute renal failure in patients with severe gastroenteritis is prerenal failure resulting from hypovolemia. But postrenal cause due to bilateral obstructive stones should be taken in a consideration.\n\nAcute Kidney Injury Enhances Outcome Prediction Ability of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score in Critically Ill Patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChang, Chih-Hsiang; Fan, Pei-Chun; Chang, Ming-Yang; Tian, Ya-Chung; Hung, Cheng-Chieh; Fang, Ji-Tseng; Yang, Chih-Wei; Chen, Yung-Chang\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIntroduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and also often part of a multiple organ failure syndrome. The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score is an excellent tool for assessing the extent of organ dysfunction in critically ill patients. This study aimed to evaluate the outcome prediction ability of SOFA and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score in ICU patients with AKI. Methods A total of 543 critically ill patients were admitted to the medical ICU of a tertiary-care hospital from July 2007 to June 2008. Demographic, clinical and laboratory variables were prospectively recorded for post hoc analysis as predictors of survival on the first day of ICU admission. Results One hundred and eighty-seven (34.4%) patients presented with AKI on the first day of ICU admission based on the risk of renal failure, injury to kidney, failure of kidney function, loss of kidney function, and end-stage renal failure (RIFLE) classification. Major causes of the ICU admissions involved respiratory failure (58%). Overall in-ICU mortality was 37.9% and the hospital mortality was 44.7%. The predictive accuracy for ICU mortality of SOFA (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves: 0.815Â±0.032) was as good as APACHE III in the AKI group. However, cumulative survival rates at 6-month follow-up following hospital discharge differed significantly (p<0.001) for SOFA score â¤10 vs. â¥11 in these ICU patients with AKI. Conclusions For patients coexisting with AKI admitted to ICU, this work recommends application of SOFA by physicians to assess ICU mortality because of its practicality and low cost. A SOFA score of â¥ â11â on ICU day 1 should be considered an indicator of negative short-term outcome. PMID:25279844\n\n[Lung and kidney failure. Pathogenesis, interactions, and therapy].\n\nPubMed\n\nJohn, S; Willam, C\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe lungs and kidneys represent the most often affected organs (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS or kidney failure) in multiple organ failure (MOF) due to shock, trauma, or sepsis with a still unacceptable high mortality for both organ failures. Although the exact pathophysiological mechanisms of MOF are not completely elucidated, it appears that the lungs and kidneys share several pathophysiologic pathways and have the potential to further harm each other (kidney-lung crosstalk). Inflammatory signals in both directions and volume overload with consecutive edema formation in both organs may play a key role in this crosstalk. The organ replacement therapies used in both organ failures have the potential to further injure the other organ (ventilator trauma, dialyte trauma). On the other hand, renal replacement therapy can have positive effects on lung injury by restoring volume and acid-base homeostasis. The new development of \"low-flow\" extracorporeal CO2 removal on renal replacement therapy platforms may further help to decrease ventilator trauma in the future.\n\nAcute Kidney Failure\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... through your urine Impaired blood flow to the kidneys Diseases and conditions that may slow blood flow ... anaphylaxis) Severe burns Severe dehydration Damage to the kidneys These diseases, conditions and agents may damage the ...\n\nKidney-Heart Interactions in Acute Kidney Injury.\n\nPubMed\n\nDoi, Kent\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in critically ill patients treated in intensive care units. Renal replacement therapy (RRT)-requiring AKI occurs in approximately 5-10% patients in intensive care unit and their mortality rate is unacceptably high (50-60%), despite sufficient control of uremia using remarkably advanced modern RRT techniques. This suggests that there are unrecognized organ interactions following AKI that could worsen the outcomes. Cardiorenal syndrome has been defined based on clinical observations that acute and chronic heart failure causes kidney injury and AKI and that chronic kidney disease worsens heart diseases. Possible pathways that connect these 2 organs have been suggested; however, the precise mechanisms are yet to be clarified, particularly in AKI-induced cardiac dysfunction. This review focuses on acute cardiac dysfunction in the setting of AKI. A recent animal study demonstrated the dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics caused by an increased dynamin-related protein 1 expression and cellular apoptosis of the heart in a renal ischemia reperfusion model. Although the precise mechanisms that induce cardiac mitochondrial injury in AKI remain unclear, cardiac mitochondria injury could be a novel candidate of drug targets against high mortality in severe AKI.

Most infants that develop acute renal failure have hypotension following cardiac surgery, or multiple organ failure. Sometimes the falls in glomerular filtration and urine output are physiological and reversible, and sometimes due to kidney injury, but (illogically) it is now common to define them all as having 'acute kidney injury'. Contrary to widespread opinion, careful interpretation of the plasma creatinine concentrations can provide sensitive evidence of early acute renal failure. Conservative management frequently leads to under-nutrition or fluid overload. Acute peritoneal dialysis is often technically fraught in very small patients, and haemotherapies have been limited by vascular access and anticoagulation requirements, the need to blood-prime circuits, and serious limitations in regulating fluid removal. Newer devices, including the Nidus, have been specifically designed to reduce these difficulties. Crown Copyright Â© 2016. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This condition is often associated with increased costs of care, length of hospitalisation and high mortality. Although the clinical impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been well established, the exact clinical significance of worsening renal function (WRF) during the acute and post-hospitalisation phases is not completely understood. Therefore, it is still unclear which of the common laboratory markers are able to identify WRF at an early stage. Recent studies comparing CKD with WRF showed contradictory results; this could depend on a different WRF definition, clinical characteristics, haemodynamic disorders and the presence of prior renal dysfunction in the population enrolled. The current definition of acute cardiorenal syndrome focuses on both the heart and kidney but it lacks precise laboratory marker cut-offs and a specific diagnostic approach. WRF and CKD could represent different pathophysiological mechanisms in the setting of acute heart failure; the traditional view includes reduced cardiac output with systemic and renal vasoconstriction. Nevertheless, it has become a mixed model that encompasses both forward and backward haemodynamic dysfunction. Increased central venous pressure, renal congestion with tubular obliteration, tubulo-glomerular feedback and increased abdominal pressure are all potential additional contributors. The impact of WRF on patients who experience preserved renal function and individuals affected with CKD is currently unknown. Therefore it is extremely important to understand the origins, the clinical significance and the prognostic impact of WRF on CKD.

Depending on the underlying disease the in-house mortality is reported to be up to 80%. Several observational studies demonstrated an association between mortality and fluid overload. A primary mechanism of interest is that fluid overload causes tissue edema and subsequent reduction of perfusion, oxygenation and nutrient delivery. This results in further renal damage. In addition, fluid overload-related dilution within the extracellular space causes artificially low serum creatinine, which masks AKI diagnosis. As a consequence, renal protective management strategies are deferred, which further aggravates kidney injury. This aggravation of renal damage subsequently increases the mortality. This review discusses the role of fluid overload for outcomes in critically ill patients as described in the current literature and assesses criteria for the initiation of renal replacement therapy in this critically ill population.

Spice is not detectable upon routine drug screening, making it an increasingly popular new street drug. A 21-year-old man presented with new-onset seizures. During the next 2 days, he developed uncontrollable hypertension, agitation, respiratory failure requiring intubation, pulmonary hypertension, and acute kidney injury (AKI) with a maximum blood urea nitrogen/creatinine level of 54/7.90 mg/dL. A complete renal workup was negative, but his urine sediment revealed granular casts. A discussion with family and friends revealed that this patient had smoked Spice during the last month. His renal function started to improve with supportive therapy, and his AKI resolved by the time of discharge without renal replacement therapy. Spice differs from marijuana because it is a cannabinoid receptor type 1 and 2 agonist. The pathologic mechanism of AKI remains unclear, but the condition likely is attributable to acute tubular necrosis or acute interstitial nephritis, as proven by biopsies performed in previous case series. It is important to raise awareness that a new Spice strain that may be circulating in the Southern California Inland Empire can endanger young users who may develop seizures, respiratory failure, and AKI.\n\nClinical case report: a rare cause of acute kidney failure - tissue is the issue.\n\nPubMed\n\nHeggermont, Ward A; Verhoef, Gregor; Evenepoel, Pieter; Sprangers, Ben; Lerut, Evelyn; Tousseyn, Thomas; Claes, Kathleen\n\n2017-06-01\n\nextranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) localization.

After rehydration, correction of hyperkalaemia and stopping RAAS-inhibition and diuretics, they recovered completely. Many patients using RAAS-inhibitors have impaired renal function. In the case of dehydration due to gastroenteritis or prolonged fever they risk developing acute renal failure. The high risk groups are elderly patients, patients with atherosclerosis or heart failure and those with co-medication of diuretics or NSAIDs. The underlying mechanism is that the normal pathways to protect kidney perfusion in case of hypovolaemia are blocked by the use of RAAS-inhibitors or NSAIDs. In the case of dehydration in patients with chronic kidney disease using RAAS-inhibitors, serum creatinine and potassium levels should be monitored. Temporary discontinuation of RAAS-inhibitors or diuretics is often necessary.\n\nAcute Kidney Injury as a Risk Factor for Delirium and Coma during Critical Illness.\n\nPubMed\n\nSiew, Edward D; Fissell, William H; Tripp, Christina M; Blume, Jeffrey D; Wilson, Matthew D; Clark, Amanda J; Vincz, Andrew J; Ely, E Wesley; Pandharipande, Pratik P; Girard, Timothy D\n\n2017-06-15\n\nAcute kidney injury may contribute to distant organ dysfunction. Few studies have examined kidney injury as a risk factor for delirium and coma. To examine whether acute kidney injury is associated with delirium and coma in critically ill adults. In a prospective cohort study of intensive care unit patients with respiratory failure and/or shock, we examined the association between acute kidney injury and daily mental status using multinomial transition models adjusting for demographics, nonrenal organ failure, sepsis, prior mental status, and sedative exposure. Acute kidney injury was characterized daily using the difference between baseline and peak serum creatinine and staged according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Mental status (normal vs. delirium vs. coma) was assessed daily with the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. Among 466 patients, stage 2 acute kidney injury was a risk factor for delirium (odds ratio [OR], 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-2.26) and coma (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.25-3.34) as was stage 3 injury (OR for delirium, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.57-4.16) (OR for coma, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.85-6.03). Daily peak serum creatinine (adjusted for baseline) values were also associated with delirium (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.18-1.55) and coma (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.20-1.74). Renal replacement therapy modified the association between stage 3 acute kidney injury and daily peak serum creatinine and both delirium and coma.

We examined whether AKI is also independently associated with a higher risk of different cardiovascular events in the first year after discharge. We conducted a retrospective analysis of a cohort between 2006 and 2013 with follow-up through 2014, within Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We identified all adults admitted to 21 hospitals who had one or more in-hospital serum creatinine test result and survived to discharge. Occurrence of AKI was on the basis of Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes diagnostic criteria. Potential confounders were identified from comprehensive inpatient and outpatient, laboratory, and pharmacy electronic medical records. During the 365 days after discharge, we ascertained occurrence of heart failure, acute coronary syndromes, peripheral artery disease, and ischemic stroke events from electronic medical records. Among a matched cohort of 146,941 hospitalized adults, 31,245 experienced AKI. At 365 days postdischarge, AKI was independently associated with higher rates of the composite outcome of hospitalization for heart failure and atherosclerotic events (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.18; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.13 to 1.25) even after adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, preadmission eGFR and proteinuria, heart failure and sepsis complicating the hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of stay, and predicted in-hospital mortality. This was driven by an excess risk of subsequent heart failure (aHR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.33 to 1.56), whereas there was no significant association with follow-up atherosclerotic events (aHR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.12). AKI is independently associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events, especially heart failure, after hospital discharge.

We hypothesized that these 3 processes may interact to synergistically increase the risk of short-term perioperative mortality in patients undergoing high-risk intraabdominal general surgery procedures. We performed a retrospective, observational cohort study of data (2005-2011) from the American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, a high-quality surgical outcomes data set. High-risk procedures were those with a risk of AKI, acute respiratory failure, or sepsis greater than the average risk in all intraabdominal general surgery procedures. The effects of AKI, acute respiratory failure, and sepsis on 30-day mortality were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Additive interactions were assessed with the relative excess risk due to interaction. Of 217,994 patients, AKI, acute respiratory failure, and sepsis developed in 1.3%, 3.7%, and 6.8%, respectively. The 30-day mortality risk with sepsis, acute respiratory failure, and AKI were 11.4%, 24.1%, and 25.1%, respectively, compared with 0.85% without these complications. The adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for a single complication (versus no complication) on mortality were 7.24 (6.46-8.11), 10.8 (8.56-13.6), and 14.2 (12.8-15.7) for sepsis, AKI, and acute respiratory failure, respectively. For 2 complications, the adjusted hazard ratios were 30.8 (28.0-33.9), 42.6 (34.3-52.9), and 65.2 (53.9-78.8) for acute respiratory failure/sepsis, AKI/sepsis, and acute respiratory failure/AKI, respectively. Finally, the adjusted hazard ratio for all 3 complications was 105 (92.8-118). Positive additive interactions, indicating synergism, were found for each combination of 2 complications. The relative excess risk due to interaction for all 3 complications was not statistically significant.

Frailty is common in critical illness survivors, but little is known about the impact of acute kidney injury.

Medical/surgical ICU of a U.S. tertiary care medical center. Three hundred seventeen participants with respiratory failure and/or shock. None. Acute kidney injury was determined using Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes stages. Clinical frailty status was determined using the Clinical Frailty Scale at 3 and 12 months following discharge. Covariates included mean ICU Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score as well as baseline comorbidity (i.e., Charlson Comorbidity Index), kidney function, and Clinical Frailty Scale score. Of 317 patients, 243 (77%) had acute kidney injury and one in four patients with acute kidney injury was frail at baseline. In adjusted models, acute kidney injury stages 1, 2, and 3 were associated with higher frailty scores at 3 months (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.14-3.24; odds ratio, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.31-4.42; and odds ratio, 4.41; 95% CI, 2.20-8.82, respectively). At 12 months, a similar association of acute kidney injury stages 1, 2, and 3 and higher Clinical Frailty Scale score was noted (odds ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.11-3.14; odds ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 0.94-3.48; and odds ratio, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.34-5.66, respectively). In supplemental and sensitivity analyses, analogous patterns of association were observed. Acute kidney injury in survivors of critical illness predicted worse frailty status 3 and 12 months postdischarge.

At that time, AKI was regarded as a \"simple\" complication, but has since undergone a fundamental change and actually has become one of the central syndromes in the critically ill patient. We have analyzed elderly patients above 65 years of age with an AKI defined as serum creatinine above 3 mg/dl corresponding to modern KDIGO stage 3, most of them requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). Using an extremely complete data set the diagnosis differentiated the underlying disease entity, the dominant cause of AKI, acute and chronic risk factors (comorbidities). Special aspects such as severity of disease, early AKI at admission versus late AKI, early versus later start of RRT, AKI not treated by RRT in spite of indication for RRT, various measures of short-term and long-term prognosis, renal outcome, patients dying with resolved AKI, and causes of death were evaluated. Crude mortality was 61% which corresponds to modern studies with gross variation among the different subgroups. Age per se was not a determinant of survival either within the group of elderly patients or as compared to younger age groups. Despite an increase in mean age and disease severity during the observation period prognosis improved. A total of 17% of patients developed a chronic kidney disease. Long-term survival as compared to the general population was low. A look back at the last two decades illustrates a remarkable evolution or rather metamorphosis of a syndrome. AKI has evolved as a central syndrome in intensive care patients, a systemic disease process associated with multiple systemic sequels and extra-renal organ injury and exerting a pronounced effect on the course of disease and short- and long-term prognosis not only of the patient but also of the kidney.

Owing to the widespread use of these procedures, contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) has become one of the most common types of acute renal failures. CI-AKI is mainly mediated by mechanisms of oxidative damage, and its onset is associated with prolonged hospitalization and significant morbidity and mortality. Preexisting chronic kidney disease, diabetes, age, heart failure, and characteristics related to the procedure (primary or elective PCI, type and amount of contrast medium) are the most important risk factors for the development of post-PCI CI-AKI.For this serious complication, prevention is more important than treatment, and various preventive measures have been widely tested in recent years. However, none of the strategies so far evaluated, with the exception of pre-procedural hydration with isotonic saline, has been shown to effectively prevent CI-AKI in randomized trials in large populations. In this review, we discuss the incidence, risk factors, main pathogenetic mechanisms and current strategies for the prevention of CI-AKI.\n\nHeart failure and kidney dysfunction: epidemiology, mechanisms and management.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchefold, Joerg C; Filippatos, Gerasimos; Hasenfuss, Gerd; Anker, Stefan D; von Haehling, Stephan\n\n2016-10-01\n\nHeart failure (HF) is a major health-care problem and the prognosis of affected patients is poor. HF often coexists with a number of comorbidities of which declining renal function is of particular importance. A loss of glomerular filtration rate, as in acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD), independently predicts mortality and accelerates the overall progression of cardiovascular disease and HF. Importantly, cardiac and renal diseases interact in a complex bidirectional and interdependent manner in both acute and chronic settings. From a pathophysiological perspective, cardiac and renal diseases share a number of common pathways, including inflammatory and direct, cellular immune-mediated mechanisms; stress-mediated and (neuro)hormonal responses; metabolic and nutritional changes including bone and mineral disorder, altered haemodynamic and acid-base or fluid status; and the development of anaemia. In an effort to better understand the important crosstalk between the two organs, classifications such as the cardio-renal syndromes were developed. This classification might lead to a more precise understanding of the complex interdependent pathophysiology of cardiac and renal diseases. In light of exceptionally high mortality associated with coexisting HF and kidney disease, this Review describes important crosstalk between the heart and kidney, with a focus on HF and kidney disease in the acute and chronic settings. Underlying molecular and cellular pathomechanisms in HF, AKI and CKD are discussed in addition to current and future therapeutic approaches.\n\nGalectin 3 complements BNP in risk stratification in acute heart failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nFermann, Gregory J; Lindsell, Christopher J; Storrow, Alan B; Hart, Kimberly; Sperling, Matthew; Roll, Susan; Weintraub, Neal L; Miller, Karen F; Maron, David J; Naftilan, Allen J; McPherson, John A; Sawyer, Douglas B; Christenson, Robert; Collins, Sean P\n\n2012-12-01\n\nGalectin 3 (G3) is a mediator of fibrosis and remodeling in heart failure.

We followed 315 allograft recipients who underwent indication biopsies at 6 days to 32 years posttransplant. Sixty kidneys progressed to failure in the follow-up period (median 31.4 months). Failure was rare after T-cell-mediated rejection and acute kidney injury and common after antibody-mediated rejection or glomerulonephritis. We developed rules for using biopsy diagnoses, HLA antibody and clinical data to explain each failure. Excluding four with missing information, 56 failures were attributed to four causes: rejection 36 (64%), glomerulonephritis 10 (18%), polyoma virus nephropathy 4 (7%) and intercurrent events 6 (11%). Every rejection loss had evidence of antibody-mediated rejection by the time of failure. Among rejection losses, 17 of 36 (47%) had been independently identified as nonadherent by attending clinicians. Nonadherence was more frequent in patients who progressed to failure (32%) versus those who survived (3%). Pure T-cell-mediated rejection, acute kidney injury, drug toxicity and unexplained progressive fibrosis were not causes of loss. This prospective cohort indicates that many actual failures after indication biopsies manifest phenotypic features of antibody-mediated or mixed rejection and also underscores the major role of nonadherence.

Over the last decade, the occurrence rate of AKI has been increasing, and there has also been a growing epidemic of chronic kidney diseases (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESRD) linked to severe and repeated episodes of AKIs. The detection and management of AKI are currently far from satisfactory. A large proportion of AKI patients, especially those with preexisting CKD, are at an increased risk of non-resolving AKI and progressing to CKD and ESRD. Proposed pathological processes that contribute to the transition of AKI to CKD and ESRD include severity and frequency of kidney injury, alterations of tubular cell phenotype with cells predominantly in the G2/M phase, interstitial fibrosis and microvascular rarification related to loss of endothelial-pericyte interactions and pericyte dedifferentiation. Innate immune responses, especially dendritic cell responses related to inadequate adenosine receptor (2a)-mediated signals, autophagic insufficiency and renin-angiotensin system activation have also been implicated in the progression of AKI and transitions from AKI to CKD and ESRD. Although promising advances have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of AKI and AKI consequences, much more work needs to be done in developing biomarkers for detecting early kidney injury, prognosticating kidney disease progression and developing strategies to effectively treat AKI and to minimize AKI progression to CKD and ESRD.

Serum creatinine, with its many shortcomings, is still the main biomarker used to detect AKI. Methods This review focuses on recent advances in definition, diagnosis, risk factors, and molecular mechanisms of AKI. In addition, specific AKI syndromes such as contrast-induced AKI, hepatorenal syndrome, and acute decompensated heart failure are discussed. The connection between AKI and subsequent chronic kidney disease and recent developments in renal replacement therapy are also covered. Results Novel biomarkers such as cystatin C and neutrophil gelatinaseâassociated lipocalin (NGAL) are being investigated to replace serum creatinine in the detection of AKI. Recent studies suggest that intravenous (IV) fluid use is beneficial for the prevention of contrast-induced AKI, while N-acetylcysteine use is not as well established. Diuretics are clearly beneficial in the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure. Ultrafiltration is less promising and can lead to adverse side effects. Although terlipressin use in hepatorenal syndrome is associated with reduced mortality, it is not available in the United States; combination therapy with midodrine, octreotide, and albumin provides an alternative. Fluid resuscitation is frequently used in critically ill patients with AKI; however, overly aggressive fluid resuscitation is frequently associated with an increased risk of mortality. A 3-step approach that combines guided fluid resuscitation, establishment of an even fluid balance, and an appropriate rate of fluid removal may be beneficial. If fluid resuscitation is needed, crystalloid solutions are preferred over hetastarch solutions. Renal replacement therapy is the last resort in AKI treatment, and timing, modality, and dosing are discussed. Research suggests that AKI leads to an increased incidence of subsequent chronic kidney disease. However, this relationship has not been fully\n\n[Epidemiology of acute kidney failure in Spanish ICU. Multicenter prospective study FRAMI].\n\nPubMed\n\nHerrera-GutiÃ©rrez, M E; Seller-PÃ©rez, G; Maynar-Moliner, J; SÃ¡nchez-Izquierdo-Riera, J A\n\n2006-01-01\n\nMulticenter study oriented at establishing the incidence and prognosis of acute kidney failure (AKF) in the ICU of our country. Prospective study of adult patients admitted over 8 months in 43 Spanish ICUs to detect AKF defined as creatinine>or=2 mg/dl or diuresis<400 ml/24 hours (in chronic patients 100% increase of creatinine, excluding those with baseline creatinine>or=4 mg/dl). 901 episodes of AKF (AKF episodes (incidence 5.7%), 55% of which occurred on admission. A total of 38.4% of the episodes were due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), 36.6% to prerenal, and 21.2% to mixed. Renal depuration (RC) was required in 38%. Mortality was 42.3% during the AKF episode (34.1% in those who were admitted with AKF versus 50.9% in those who developed it after admission), 80% in patients with Hepatorenal Syndrome, 51.6% in ATN and 29.9% in prerenal. We detect an independent relationship with mortality for age (OR 1.03), background of diabetes (OR 2.06), development of AKF in the ICU (OR 2.51), oliguria (OR 5.76) and RC (OR 2.32). Recovery of the kidney function occurred in 85.6% of the survivors and RC was maintained in only 1.1% on discharge from the ICU. We calculated the area under the curve of APACHE II on admission (0.62), SOFA on onset of AKF (0.68), LiaÃ±o index (0.7) and maximum SOFA (0.79). AKF in ICU patients does not show an elevated incidence but does have high mortality, presenting greater seriousness when it appears after admission. However, recovery is elevated in patients who survive. The usual prognostic indexes are not exact in this patient group, the ISA and maximum SOFA being those which shows a closer relationship with mortality.\n\nPredicting kidney disease progression in patients with acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nMizuguchi, K Annette; Huang, Chuan-Chin; Shempp, Ian; Wang, Justin; Shekar, Prem; Frendl, Gyorgy\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe study objective was to identify patients who are likely to develop progressive kidney dysfunction (acute kidney disease) before their hospital discharge after cardiac surgery, allowing targeted monitoring of kidney function in this at-risk group with periodic serum creatinine measurements. Risks of progression to acute kidney disease (a state in between acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease) were modeled from acute kidney injury stages (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A modified Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to evaluate the association between acute kidney injury stages and the development of acute kidney disease (defined as doubling of creatinine 2-4Â weeks after surgery) in this observational study. Acute kidney disease occurred in 4.4% of patients with no preexisting kidney disease and 4.8% of patients with preexisting chronic kidney disease. Acute kidney injury predicted development of acute kidney disease in a graded manner in which higher stages of acute kidney injury predicted higher relative risk of progressive kidney disease (area under the receiver operator characteristic curveÂ =Â 0.82). This correlation persisted regardless of baseline kidney function (PÂ <Â .001). Of note, development of acute kidney disease was associated with higher mortality and need for renal replacement therapy. The degree of acute kidney injury can identify patients who will have a higher risk of progression to acute kidney disease. These patients may benefit from close follow-up of renal function because they are at risk of progressing to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.

In intensive care unit sepsis and septic shock are leading causes of AKI. Sepsis-induced AKI literally acts as a biologic indicator of clinical deterioration. AKI triggers variety of immune, inflammatory, metabolic and humoral patways; ultimately leading distant organ dysfunction and increases morbidity and mortality. Serial mesurements of creatinine and urine volume do not make it possible to diagnose AKI at early stages. Serum creatinine influenced by age, weight, hydration status and become apparent only when the kidneys have lost 50% of their function. For that reason we need new markers, and many biomarkers in the diagnosis of early AKI activity is assessed. Historically \"Risk-Injury-Failure-Loss-Endstage\" (RIFLE), \"Acute Kidney Injury Netwok\" (AKIN) and \"The Kidney Disease/ Improving Global Outcomes\" (KDIGO) classification systems are used for diagnosing easily in clinical practice and research and grading disease. Classifications including diagnostic criteria are formed for the identification of AKI. Neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), cystatin-C (Cys-C), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and also \"cell cycle arrest\" molecules has been concerned for clinical use. In this review the pathophysiology of AKI, with the relationship of sepsis and the importance of early diagnosis of AKI is evaluated.\n\nAge and treatment of kidney failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nElliott, Meghan J; Tam-Tham, Helen; Hemmelgarn, Brenda R\n\n2013-05-01\n\nThis review discusses issues related to treatment of chronic kidney disease, and kidney failure in particular, among older adults. A substantial proportion of older adults have chronic kidney disease and progress to kidney failure. There is considerable variability in treatment practices for advanced kidney disease among older adults, and evidence that treatment decisions such as dialysis initiation may be made without adequate preparation. When initiated, survival among older adults on chronic dialysis remains poor, and is associated with a significant decline in functional status. There is also evidence to suggest that dialysis initiation may not reflect overall treatment goals of elderly patients, but rather a lack of clear communication between patients and health practitioners, and underdeveloped conservative care programs in many centers. Kidney failure is common among older adults. When considering treatment options for kidney failure, patient priorities, preferences, and symptoms should be taken into account, using a shared decision-making approach.\n\n[Review of the knowledge on acute kidney failure in the critical patient].\n\nPubMed\n\nRomero GarcÃ­a, M; Delgado Hito, P; de la Cueva Ariza, L\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAcute renal failure affects from 1% to 25% of patients admitted to intensive care units. These figures vary depending on the population studied and criteria. The complications of acute renal failure (fluid overload, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, bleeding) are treated. However, mortality remains high despite the technological advances of recent years because acute renal failure is usually associated with sepsis, respiratory failure, serious injury, surgical complications or consumption coagulopathy. Mortality ranges from 30% to 90%. Although there is no universally accepted definition, the RIFLE classification gives us an operational tool to define the degree of acute renal failure and to standardize the initiation of renal replacement techniques as well as to evaluate the results. Therefore, nurses working within the intensive care unit must be familiar with this disease, with its treatment (drug or alternative) and with the prevention of possible complications. Equally, they must be capable of detecting the manifestations of dependency each one of the basic needs and to be able to identify the collaboration problems in order to achieve an individualized care plan.

The associated symptoms include hypotension in the lower half of the body, secondary hypertension in the upper half of the body, and heart failure. Here we present an 80-year-old Asian woman complaining of progressive exertional dyspnea. She was diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure and kidney injury due to severely calcified stenosis of the thoracoabdominal aorta, the so called AAC. She received hemodiafiltration, and pulmonary congestion improved in part. Generally, surgical treatments are quite invasive in elderly patients. Endovascular stent graft placement is less invasive, however, fracture and rupture should be considered at severely calcified lesions like this case. Therefore, we selected extra-anatomical axillofemoral bypass. Her recovery after the surgery was remarkable. In a few days, she became free from hemodiafiltration, intravenous diuretics, and oxygen administration. We thought the contributive factors are the increase in kidney blood flow and the correction of afterload mismatch. The decrease in pulse pressure may reflect the reduction in systemic arterial compliance by axillofemoral bypass. The operative mortality of axillofemoral bypass was reported to be acceptable, although the patency of the axillofemoral bypass graft was not high enough. In conclusion, axillofemoral bypass is effective and feasible for elderly patients with acute decompensated heart failure and kidney injury due to AAC.\n\nUrinary sodium excretion and kidney failure in non-diabetic chronic kidney disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFan, Li; Tighiouart, Hocine; Levey, Andrew S.; Beck, Gerald J.; Sarnak, Mark J.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nCurrent guidelines recommend under 2g/day sodium intake in chronic kidney disease, but there are few studies relating sodium intake to long-term outcomes. Here we evaluated the association of mean baseline 24-hour urinary sodium excretion with kidney failure and a composite outcome of kidney failure or all-cause mortality using Cox regression in 840 participants enrolled in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study. Mean 24-hour urinary sodium excretion was 3.46 g/day. Kidney failure developed in 617 and the composite outcome was reached in 723. In the primary analyses there was no association between 24-hour urine sodium and kidney failure [HR 0.99 (95% CI 0.91â1.08)] nor on the composite outcome [HR 1.01 (95% CI 0.93â1.09),] each per 1g/day higher urine sodium. In exploratory analyses there was a significant interaction of baseline proteinuria and sodium excretion with kidney failure. Using a 2-slope model, when urine sodium was under 3g/day, higher urine sodium was associated with increased risk of kidney failure in those with baseline proteinuria under 1g/day, and lower risk of kidney failure in those with baseline proteinuria of 1g/day or more. There was no association between urine sodium and kidney failure when urine sodium was 3g/day or more. Results were consistent using first baseline and time-dependent urine sodium. Thus, we noted no association of urine sodium with kidney failure. Results of the exploratory analyses need to be verified in additional studies and the mechanism explored.

A 40-year-old man presented with various complaints, including a recent hypoglycemic episode. Assessment revealed that serum creatinine was elevated at 5.5 mg/dL, from a baseline of 0.9 mg/dL. An interview revealed a 2- to 3-week history of daily ingestion of 100 to 120 oz of Red Bull energy drink. Resolution of renal dysfunction occurred within 2 days of discontinuation of Red Bull and persisted through 10 months of follow-up. Rechallenge was not attempted. Energy-drink-induced renal failure has been reported infrequently. We identified 2 case reports via a search of MEDLINE, one of which occurred in combination with alcohol and the other of which was not available in English. According to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Adverse Event Reporting System, between 2004 and 2012, the FDA has received 166 reports of adverse events associated with energy drink consumption. Only 3 of the 166 (0.18%) described renal failure, and none were reported with Red Bull specifically. A defined mechanism for injury is unknown. Assessment of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the development of acute renal failure and Red Bull ingestion in our patient. Acute kidney injury has rarely been reported with energy drink consumption. Our report describes the first English language report of acute renal failure occurring in the context of ingestion of large quantities of energy drink without concomitant alcohol.

The availability of adequate animal models may speed up the discovery of biomarkers for disease staging and therapy individualization as well as design and testing of novel therapeutic strategies. Some longstanding animal models have failed to result in therapeutic advances in the clinical setting, such as kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury and diabetic nephropathy models. In this regard, most models for diabetic nephropathy are unsatisfactory in that they do not evolve to renal failure. Satisfactory models for additional nephropathies are needed. These include anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, IgA nephropathy, anti-phospholipase-A2-receptor (PLA2R) membranous nephropathy and Fabry nephropathy. However, recent novel models hold promise for clinical translation. Thus, the AKI to CKD translation has been modeled, in some cases with toxins of interest for human CKD such as aristolochic acid. Genetically modified mice provide models for Alport syndrome evolving to renal failure that have resulted in clinical recommendations, polycystic kidney disease models that have provided clues for the development of tolvaptan, that was recently approved for the human disease in Japan; and animal models also contributed to target C5 with eculizumab in hemolytic uremic syndrome. Some ongoing trials explore novel concepts derived from models, such TWEAK targeting as tissue protection for lupus nephritis. We now review animal models reproducing diverse, genetic and acquired, causes of AKI and CKD evolving to kidney failure and discuss the contribution to clinical translation and prospects for the future.

The current study investigated the relationship between acute kidney injury and coronary heart disease prior to coronary angiography. All patients were evaluated after undergoing coronary angiography in the cardiac catheterization laboratory of the Vinzentius Hospital in Landau, Germany, in 2011. The study group included patients with both acute coronary heart disease and acute kidney injury (as defined according to the classification of the Acute Kidney Injury Group); the control group included patients without acute coronary heart disease. Serum creatinine profiles were evaluated in all patients, as were a variety of demographic and health characteristics. Of the 303 patients examined, 201 (66.34%) had coronary artery disease. Of these, 38 (18.91%) also had both acute kidney injury and acute coronary heart disease prior to and after coronary angiography, and of which in turn 34 (16.91%) had both acute kidney injury and acute coronary heart disease only prior to the coronary angiography. However, the occurrence of acute kidney injury was not significantly related to the presence of coronary heart disease (P = 0.95, Chi-square test). The results of this study indicate that acute kidney injury is not linked to acute coronary heart disease. However, physicians should be aware that many coronary heart patients may develop kidney injury while hospitalized for angiography.\n\nDecision Making by Young Transplant Surgeons Regarding Expanded-Criteria Donors With Acute Kidney Injury or Allocation Failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nJung, D; Park, S; Kim, S H; Eom, M; Kim, J S; Yang, J W; Han, B G; Choi, S O\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe utilization of expanded-criteria donors (ECDs) has increased to overcome donor shortages. Unfortunately, the discard rate has also increased, especially in ECDs with acute kidney injury (AKI). We evaluated the outcomes of kidney transplantation in ECDs and standard-criteria donors (SCDs) with and without AKI. We reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent kidney transplantation. We used the AKI definition published by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes group and reviewed the demographic characteristics of donors and recipients. We analyzed transplantation outcomes. Twenty-seven patients underwent kidney transplantation from ECDs with AKI (nÂ = 6) or without AKI (nÂ = 5) and SCDs with AKI (nÂ = 6) or without AKI (nÂ = 10). Initial creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were not significantly different between the groups. The incidence of delayed graft function was highest in ECDs with AKI (nÂ = 3; 36.4%), but this was not a significantly difference. There was no difference in the last creatinine and eGFR in ECDs with AKI (1.32Â mg/dL, 58.7Â mL/min/1.73Â m(2)), ECDsÂ without AKI (1.67Â mg/dL, 44.2Â mL/min/1.73Â m(2)), SCDs with AKI (0.94Â mg/dL, 81.5Â mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and SCDs without AKI (0.97Â mg/dL, 81.8Â mL/min/1.73Â m(2)). As the donor pool is extended to ECDs, young transplant surgeons may increasingly face decisions regarding ECDs with AKI or allocation failure. There is no consensus regarding discard criteria. However, if the donor showed initially normal creatinine levels or if dual-kidney transplantation can be performed, young transplant surgeons should not hesitate to use ECDs with AKI or allocation failure.

Observational retrospective study based on a review of medical records. The study included patients â¥ 45 years treated for heart failure from 2008 to 2010. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence/absence of KF. Main outcome variables were comorbidity, clinical status (functional class, etiology), metabolic syndrome, costs, and new cases of cardiovascular events and kidney failure. The cost model included direct and indirect health care costs. Statistical analysis included multiple regression models. The study recruited 1600 patients (prevalence, 4.0%; mean age 72.4 years; women, 59.7%). Of these patients, 70.1% had hypertension, 47.1% had dyslipidemia, and 36.2% had diabetes mellitus. We analyzed 433 patients (27.1%) with kidney failure and 1167 (72.9%) without kidney failure. Patients with kidney failure were associated with functional class III-IV (54.1% vs 40.8%) and metabolic syndrome (65.3% vs 51.9%, P<.01). The average unit cost was â¬10,711.40. The corrected cost in the presence of kidney failure was â¬14,868.20 vs â¬9,364.50 (P=.001). During follow-up, 11.7% patients developed ischemic heart disease, 18.8% developed kidney failure, and 36.1% developed heart failure exacerbation. Comorbidity associated with heart failure is high. The presence of kidney failure increases the use of health resources and leads to higher costs within the National Health System. Copyright Â© 2014 Sociedad EspaÃ±ola de CardiologÃ­a.

Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated in the validation cohort, and subgroup analyses were conducted across admission serum creatinine, acute kidney injury severity, and hospital location. Among the 121,158 included patients, 17,482 (14.4%) developed any Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes acute kidney injury, with 4,251 (3.5%) developing stage 2. The AUC (95% CI) was 0.90 (0.90-0.90) for predicting stage 2 acute kidney injury within 24 hours and 0.87 (0.87-0.87) within 48 hours. The AUC was 0.96 (0.96-0.96) for receipt of renal replacement therapy (n = 821) in the next 48 hours. Accuracy was similar across hospital settings (ICU, wards, and emergency department) and admitting serum creatinine groupings. At a probability threshold of greater than or equal to 0.022, the algorithm had a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 85% for stage 2 acute kidney injury and predicted the development of stage 2 a median of 41 hours (interquartile range, 12-141âhr) prior to the development of stage 2 acute kidney injury.

METHODS We randomly assigned critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and failure of at least one nonrenal organ or sepsis to receive intensive or less intensive renal-replacement therapy. The primary end point was death from any cause by day 60. In both study groups, hemodynamically stable patients underwent intermittent hemodialysis, and hemodynamically unstable patients underwent continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration or sustained low-efficiency dialysis. Patients receiving the intensive treatment strategy underwent intermittent hemodialysis and sustained low-efficiency dialysis six times per week and continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration at 35 ml per kilogram of body weight per hour; for patients receiving the less-intensive treatment strategy, the corresponding treatments were provided thrice weekly and at 20 ml per kilogram per hour. RESULTS Baseline characteristics of the 1124 patients in the two groups were similar. The rate of death from any cause by day 60 was 53.6% with intensive therapy and 51.5% with less-intensive therapy (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.40; P = 0.47). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the duration of renalreplacement therapy or the rate of recovery of kidney function or nonrenal organ failure. Hypotension during intermittent dialysis occurred in more patients randomly assigned to receive intensive therapy, although the frequency of hemodialysis sessions complicated by hypotension was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Intensive renal support in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury did not decrease mortality, improve recovery of kidney function, or reduce the rate of nonrenal organ failure as compared with less-intensive therapy involving a defined dose of intermittent hemodialysis three times per week and continuous renal\n\nThe Loss of GSTM1 Associates with Kidney Failure and Heart Failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nTin, Adrienne; Scharpf, Robert; Estrella, Michelle M; Yu, Bing; Grove, Megan L; Chang, Patricia P; Matsushita, Kunihiro; KÃ¶ttgen, Anna; Arking, Dan E; Boerwinkle, Eric; Le, Thu H; Coresh, Josef; Grams, Morgan E\n\n2017-11-01\n\nGlutathione S-transferase mu 1 ( GSTM1) encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the conjugation of electrophilic compounds with glutathione to facilitate their degradation or excretion. The loss of one or both copies of GSTM1 is common in many populations and has been associated with CKD progression. With the hypothesis that the loss of GSTM1 is also associated with incident kidney failure and heart failure, we estimated GSTM1 copy number using exome sequencing reads in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, a community-based prospective cohort of white and black participants. Overall, 51.2% and 39.8% of white participants and 25.6% and 48.5% of black participants had zero or one copy of GSTM1 , respectively. Over a median follow-up of 24.6 years, 256 kidney f"
