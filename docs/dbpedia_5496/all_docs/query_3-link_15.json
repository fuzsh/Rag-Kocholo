We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of ERAS in KT during the “extended-criteria donor” era, and to identify the predictive factors of prolonged hospitalization. In 2010–2019, all patients receiving KT were included in ERAS program targeting a discharge home within 5 days of surgery. Recipient, transplant, and outcomes data were analyzed. Of 454 KT [male: 280, 63.9%; age: 57 (19–77) years], 212 (46.7%) recipients were discharged within the ERAS target (≤5 days), while 242 (53.3%) were discharged later. Patients within the ERAS target (≤5 days) had comparable recipient and transplant characteristics to those with longer hospital stays, and they had similar post-operative complications, readmission rates, and 5 year graft/patient survival. In the multivariate analysis, DGF (HR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.08–4.34, p < 0.030) and in-hospital dialysis (HR: 3.68, 95% CI: 1.73–7.85, p < 0.001) were the only predictive factors for late discharge. The ERAS approach is feasible and safe in all KT candidates, and its failure is primarily related to the postoperative graft function, rather than the recipient’s clinical status. ERAS pathways, integrated with strict collaboration with local nephrologists, allow early discharge after KT, with clinical benefits.

Besides the generalised healthcare crisis, this unprecedented drop has multiple explanations such as the risk of viral transmission through the allograft, the perceived increase in SARS-CoV-2-related morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised hosts, and the virtual “safety” of dialysis while awaiting effective antiviral prophylaxis or treatment. Our institution, operating at the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, has continued the KT programme without pre-set limitations. In this single-centre retrospective observational study with one-year follow-up, we assessed the outcomes of patients who had undergone KT (KTR) or remained on the transplant waiting list (TWL), before (Pre-COV) or during (COV) the pandemic. The main demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients on the TWL or receiving a KT were very similar in the two periods. The pandemic did not affect post-transplant recipient and allograft loss rates. On the contrary, there was a trend toward higher mortality among COV-TWL patients compared to Pre-COV-TWL subjects. Such a discrepancy was primarily due to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Chronic exposure to immunosuppression, incidence of delayed allograft function, and rejection rates were comparable. However, after one year, COV-KTR showed significantly higher median serum creatinine than Pre-COV-KTR. Our data confirm that KT practice could be safely maintained during the COVID-19 pandemic, with excellent patient- and allograft-related outcomes. Strict infection control strategies, aggressive follow-up monitoring, and preservation of dedicated personnel and resources are key factors for the optimisation of the results in case of future pandemics.

CM outcomes, as well as its clinical features and radiological characteristics, have not yet been considered on a large scale in the context of kidney transplantation (KT). We performed a nationwide retrospective study of adult patients diagnosed with cryptococcosis after KT between 2002 and 2020 across 30 clinical centers in France. We sought to describe overall and graft survival based on whether KT patients with cryptococcosis developed CM or not. Clinical indicators of CNS involvement and brain radiological characteristics were assessed. Eighty-eight cases of cryptococcosis were diagnosed during the study period, with 61 (69.3%) cases of CM. Mortality was high (32.8%) at 12 months (M12) but not significantly different whether or not patients presented with CM. Baseline hyponatremia and at least one neurological symptom were independently associated with CM (p < 0.001). Positive serum cryptococcal antigen at diagnosis was also significantly associated with CM (p < 0.001). On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), three patterns of brain injury were identified: parenchymal, meningeal, and vascular lesions. Although CM does not affect graft function directly, it entails a grim prognosis.

While infective endocarditis (IE) is among such complications in KTRs, the literature is scarce. We describe the presentation, epidemiology, and factors associated with IE in KTRs. We performed a retrospective case/control study which included patients from two centers. First episodes of definite or possible IE (Duke criteria) in adult KTRs from January 2010 to December 2018 were included, as well as two controls per case, and followed until 31 December 2019. Clinical, biological, and microbiological data and the outcome were collected. Survival was studied using the Kaplan–Meier method. Finally, we searched for factors associated with the onset of IE in KTRs by the comparison of cases and controls. Seventeen cases and 34 controls were included. IE was diagnosed after a mean delay of 78 months after KT, mostly on native valves of the left heart only. Pathogens of digestive origin were most frequently involved (six Enterococcus spp, three Streptococcus gallolyticus, and one Escherichia coli), followed by Staphylococci (three cases of S. aureus and S. epidermidis each). Among the risk factors evaluated, age, vascular nephropathy, and elevated calcineurin inhibitor through levels were significantly associated with the occurrence of IE in our study. Patient and death-censored graft survival were greatly diminished five years after IE, compared to controls being 50.3% vs. 80.6% (p < 0.003) and 29.7% vs. 87.5% (p < 0.002), respectively. IE in KTRs is a disease that carries significant risks both for the survival of the patient and the transplant.

Lombardy (region of Italy), accounts for 786,324 cases as of 21 April 2021. We retrospectively describe our single Centre experience in 82 adult kidney-transplant patients with COVID-19 infection during two pandemic outbreaks: 27 (first outbreak) and 65 (second outbreak). Thirty-seven patients were hospitalized (HP) and sixty-five were home managed (HM). Infection presented with fever (80%), cough (51%), and dyspnea (33%). HP were older (60 ± 11 vs. 50 ± 14 years, p = 0.001), had more severe respiratory symptoms (dyspnea 62.1%, p < 0.0001–cough 67% p = 0.008), and a longer length of disease (30 ± 28 vs. 21 ± 10, p = 0.04). The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) was 29.7% (p < 0.0001). Steroid dosage was increased in 66% of patients (p = 0.0003), while calcineurin inhibitors were reduced by up to one third in 45% of cases, p < 0.0001. Eleven patients died (13%). HM patients recovered completely without sequelae. In the overall cohort, AKI development (p = 0.006 OR 50.4 CI 95% 3.0–836) and age (p = 0.04 OR 1.1 CI 95% 1.0–1.2) were the most important factors influencing the probability of death during the infection. Although we report a relatively low incidence of infection (5.1%) the incidence of death is almost four times higher than it is in the general population. Full article\n\n►▼ Show Figures"
