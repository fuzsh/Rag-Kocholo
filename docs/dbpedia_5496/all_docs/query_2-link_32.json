        "text": "Education Program\n\nA Little Less Conversation, a Little More Action: An Outcome Equity Roadmap for Children and AYAs With Leukemia and Lymphoma\n\nCenturies of structural racism have contributed to discrimination, environmental and social injustice, and household material hardship among historically marginalized populations. Recent studies have highlighted the impact of factors such as income and insurance status on cancer outcomes and health equity. Under-representation of specific groups has limited our understanding of cancer risk, disease biology, treatment-related toxicities, and patient-reported outcomes. The educational objective of this session is to present the latest evidence regarding modifiable factors that contribute to outcome disparities in childhood/adolescent and young adult (AYA) hematologic malignancies, and to discuss potential targets for interventions that address these disparities. Dr. Ji will present an in-depth overview of public health insurance programs in the U.S. and related implications on outcome disparities among AYAs with blood cancers. Using a case-based approach, Dr. Ji will discuss opportunities to improve access to high-quality public health insurance, subsequent to the Affordable Care Act. Dr. Umaretiya will discuss the role of social determinants of health (SDOH) as modifiable drivers of outcome inequities in pediatric oncology. She will review the prevalence of SDOH in pediatric oncology, present historically marginalized parent perspectives on unmet social needs during cancer care, and highlight novel interventions addressing this population’s SDOH and social needs. Dr. Mittal will discuss factors contributing to low rates of enrollment of AYAs with hematologic malignancies to clinical trials, including a lack of availability and accessibility. She will provide an up-to-date review of collaborative initiatives that are addressing some of these barriers to improve AYA access to cancer clinical trials.\n\nChair:\n\nMaria Monica Monica Gramatges, MD,PhD\n\nTexas Children's Hospital\n\nHouston, TX\n\nSpeakers:\n\nXu Ji, PhD\n\nEmory University School of Medicine\n\nAtlanta, GA\n\nThe Lasting Impact of the ACA: How Medicaid Expansion Reduces Outcome Disparities in AYAs With Leukemia and Lymphoma\n\nPuja J.

The approach to treating patients diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma has evolved over time with therapeutics including high dose cytarabine containing regimens prior to autologous stem cell consolidation, rituximab maintenance and the oral Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors for relapsed/refractory disease. It is recognized that not all patients benefit from these approaches. This educational session will explore the evolving treatment landscape in mantle cell lymphoma including identification and treatment of patients with high-risk disease, the role of autologous stem cell transplant consolidation in the era of novel therapies and the current and future incorporation of T-cell engaging therapies in the treatment landscape.\n\nDr. Kami Maddocks will define high-risk features in Mantle Cell Lymphoma associated with inferior prognosis to standard treatment approaches. Clinical trials incorporating Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors into initial therapy will be discussed. The role of targeted and immunotherapy combinations in a “chemotherapy-free” approach will be presented.\n\nDr. Martin Dreyling will discuss the role of autologous stem cell transplantation and additional consolidation/maintenance therapies in first line treatment. Clinical trials incorporating Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors into initial therapy will be mentioned. Differential treatment strategies according to clinically applicable biological risk factors will be suggested.\n\nDr. Lia Palomba will review T-cell engaging therapies in relapsed or refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma, including CAR T-cells and bispecific antibodies. She will review available data on the outcome of these therapies in the general MCL population and in high-risk subgroups.\n\nChair:\n\nKami J.

This educational session will delve into current clinical challenges in management of this difficult to treat population and will focus on the more common subtypes of peripheral T-cell lymphoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. The session first will discuss management, incorporation of novel agents and consideration of personalized approaches in relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphomas and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. We will also discuss the utility and timing of both autologous and allogeneic transplant in cutaneous and peripheral T-cell lymphoma.\n\nDr. Mehta-Shah will discuss current clinical challenges in the management of patients with relapsed/refractory T-cell lymphomas. In the evolving landscape of treatment and biologic considerations, we will discuss the use of both standard agents as well as novel targeted agents in the treatment of this patient population. Given that our understanding of these heterogenous diseases continues to improve, we will discuss strategies for subtypes specific or personalized therapy.\n\nDr. Horwitz will explore and detail the expanding options for treatment of CTCL.\n\nDr. Dreger will discuss the role of stem cell transplant (auto and allo) on PTCL and CTCL.\n\nChair:\n\nNeha Mehta-Shah, MD, MSCI\n\nWashington University in St. Louis\n\nSt Louis, MO\n\nSpeakers:\n\nNeha Mehta-Shah, MD, MSCI\n\nWashington University in St. Louis\n\nSt Louis, MO\n\nBV and Beyond: How to Incorporate Novel Agents into PTCL Management\n\nSteven Horwitz, MD\n\nMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center\n\nNew York, NY\n\nExpanding Options for Treatment of CTCL\n\nPeter Dreger\n\nUniversitätsklinikum\n\nHeidelberg, Germany\n\nThe Role of Stem Cell Transplant (auto and allo) in PTCL and CTCL\n\nAdult ALL Advancements: Optimizing Cure in 2024\n\nAcute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults is an aggressive condition with historically few long-term survivors. Fortunately, the outlook for ALL in adults is improving rapidly as years of scientific research and clinical investigation begins to pay dividends. Improved understanding of the heterogeneity and varied biological behavior of ALL subtypes has led to routine immunophenotypic and genetic characterization of individual ALL cases in the clinic. Profiling of ALL at diagnosis as well as better ability to track measurable residual disease (MRD) after therapy now permits personalized, risk-adapted treatment recommendations in ALL including the rational application of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In addition, multiple new targeted and immune therapies have been approved by regulatory authorities for Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) and negative B-ALL. The rapid pace of scientific and therapeutic advancement in ALL is challenging established standards of care for upfront treatment of adults with newly diagnosed ALL. In this session, the impact of scientific and therapeutic advancements in the initial treatment approach for ALL will be reviewed, with a focus on recent evidence generation.\n\nDr. Marlise Luskin will review data supporting the selection of various approaches to initial treatment of Ph+ ALL in adults. She will discuss data justifying the use of specific BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitors including dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib. In this session, she will also review evidence defining the role of conventional chemotherapy, allogeneic transplantation, and the bi-specific T-cell engager (BiTE) blinatumomab in first-line post-remissiont treatment of Ph+ ALL in adults of different ages.\n\nProf. Matthias Stelljes will discuss the role of novel antibody-based and cell-based immunotherapies in the treatment of ALL in adults. Blinatumomab, the antibody-drug conjugate inotuzumab ozogamicin, and CD19-directed CAR-T cells are current standard-of-care options for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL. The CD20-targeting monoclonal antibody rituximab and blinatumomab are established components of frontline therapy for patients with CD20-positive ALL and patients with persistent MRD, respectively. More recently, blinatumomab and inotuzumab have shown promising results in the upfront treatment of patients with B-cell ALL. These data form the basis for evaluating and defining new treatment standards, which will be discussed in this educational session.\n\nDr. Partow Kebriaei will review risk profiling in adult patients with ALL, and specifically how disease risk informs the decision to recommend transplant in first complete remission. Additionally, she will highlight advancements in GVHD prophylaxis that facilitate greater donor availability and decreased toxicity of transplant. Finally, Dr. Kebriaei will review the optimal sequence for transplant within the context of CAR T therapy.\n\nChair:\n\nMarlise R Luskin, MD, MSCE\n\nDana-Farber Cancer Institute\n\nBoston, MA\n\nSpeakers:\n\nMarlise R Luskin, MD, MSCE\n\nDana-Farber Cancer Institute\n\nBoston, MA\n\nPH+ ALL: New Approaches for Upfront Therapy\n\nMatthias Stelljes, MD\n\nUniversity Hospital Muenster\n\nMuenster, Germany\n\nPh- ALL: Impact of Immunotherapy in Upfront Treatment\n\nPartow Kebriaei, MD\n\nMD Anderson Cancer Center\n\nHouston, TX\n\nTransplant in ALL: Who, When, and How?\n\nAdult CAR-T Outcomes: Beyond the Acronyms (OS, PFS, CRS, ICANS)\n\nCAR T-cell therapy has become a standard treatment option resulting in improved progression-free and overall survival in a variety of relapsed and refractory adult hematologic malignancies. The acute toxicities, particularly CRS and ICANS, and outcomes of CAR T-cell therapy have been extensively described. However, as indications and utilization of this treatment have expanded with increasing reports of long-term survivors, it has become increasingly apparent that there are a number of clinically significant, long-term complications and toxicities that may occur in CAR T-cell recipients. Recognition and understanding of these long-term complications are imperative to patient selection, counseling, and management. This session will review and provide guidelines for monitoring and treatment of long-term complications after CAR T-cell therapy in adult patients.\n\nMeasuring disease-related and treatment-driven patient-reported outcomes (PROs) as standard of care in patients undergoing CAR T-cell therapy is both feasible and vital. As has been shown with numerous oncology therapies, the assessment of symptom and functioning PROs is now sufficiently mature to justify their contribution to treatment precision, efficiency, and standardization and national and international collaborations. Nonetheless, collaborative efforts among clinicians, symptom researchers, and electronic health system designers are needed to integrate evidence-based PROs into routine patient care after CAR-T cell therapy. This will help in capturing early toxicity and implement timely interventions with the ultimate goal of improving treatment tolerability related to symptom burden and CAR T-cell clinical outcomes.\n\nAdults receiving chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy may experience late complications distinct from those in the early CAR T-cell treatment period. Late complications include cytopenias, infections, secondary malignancies, and delayed neurotoxicities. Late cytopenias may be from prolonged recovery after lymphodepleting chemotherapy or arise anew, raising concerns for recurrent disease or a secondary malignancy. Late infections, which are predominantly viral, may require ongoing prophylaxis and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Both hematologic and solid secondary malignancies are a known risk of CAR T-cell therapy, with recent observations of T-cell cancers. It is essential to monitor for late complications in adult patients receiving CAR T-cells to improve the outcomes and quality of life.\n\nInfections following CAR-T remain a notable cause of morbidity and mortality not only in the early (<30 days) post-CAR-T but also persist through the prolonged (30-90 days) and late (>90 days) follow-up. The predisposition to infections results from immunosuppression related to underlying disease, prior cytotoxic therapies, lymphodepletion chemotherapy, delayed hematopoietic recovery, B-cell aplasia, and delayed T-cell immune reconstitution. This draft delineates risk factors and epidemiology of infections along the post-CAR-T timeline. Dr. Jain will further discuss our approach to mitigation and management of infections including antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal prophylaxis, growth factors to expedite count recovery, immunoglobulin replacement therapy, and re-vaccination programs.\n\nChair:\n\nMichael R Bishop, MD\n\nUniversity of Chicago\n\nChicago, IL\n\nSpeakers:\n\nXin Shelley Wang, MD, MPH\n\nThe University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center\n\nHouston, TX\n\nPatient-Reported Outcomes After CAR T-cell Therapy?in Patients with Hematological Malignancies\n\nMichael R Bishop, MD\n\nUniversity of Chicago\n\nChicago, IL\n\nLate Complications and Long-term Care of Adult CAR T cell Patients\n\nTania Jain, MD\n\nJohns Hopkins University School of Medicine\n\nBaltimore, MD\n\nMitigating and Managing Infection Risk\n\nALPS, CVID, and LGL: When Autoimmune Cytopenias Are a Marker of Underlying Immune Disease\n\nAutoimmune cytopenias that are chronic, refractory and multi lineage present a challenge in the clinic. However, recent advances exploring their molecular genetic underpinnings have made them more amenable to rationally targeted therapies and forestall end organ damage in the long run. Dr. V. Koneti Rao will discuss diagnosis and management of ALPS-FAS (Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome due to FAS variants) and APDS (Activated PI3Kinase Delta Syndrome due to PIK3CD and PIK3R1 genetic variants) including recently licensed targeted treatment for the latter using a PI3Kinsae inhibitor, leniolisib. Dr.Charlotte Cunnigham Rundles will discuss the impact of genetic disorders presenting as CVID (Common Variable Immune Deficiency) affecting multiple organs due to variants in transcription factors, check point inhibitors, chemokines and cytokines. CVID is one of the most common inborn errors of immunity presenting with infections due to insufficient levels of immune globulins and loss of specific antibodies. However, a significant proportion of these patients develop autoimmune multilineage cytopenias and increased susceptibility to malignancies including lymphoma. These conditions may often be the initial manifestation of the underlying immune defect in a patient who has not had significant infections, and these episodes may recur over time. Treatment of the hematologic complications may require frequent and episodic use of corticosteroids, and/or rituximab; splenectomy is discouraged. Genetic associations noted in CVID patients include CTLA4, LRBA, IKZF1, NFKB1 and NFKB2,STAT3 and STAT1 variants that might provide opportunities for targeted therapeutics. Dr.Thierry Lamy will highlight the impact of clonal evolution of T and Nk cells in LGL (large granular lymphocytosis).Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is a rare T/NK cell driven chronic lymphoproliferative disease characterized by neutropenia, anemia and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren syndrome, vasculitis, and autoimmune endocrinopathies. Recent advances in the pathogenesis of LGL leukemia have highlighted the implication of STAT3 genetic variants playing a pivotal role in the leukemic cell proliferation and survival, and autoimmunity. The genetic landscape of LGL is afflicted with gene mutations affecting NF-KB pathway (TNFAIP3), epigenome (TET2, KMT2D), and microenvironment (CCL22). Immunosuppressive agents (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and cyclosporine) constitute the foundation of first line therapy. Recent advances have led to the development of targeted approaches, including JAK-STAT inhibitors, cytokine targeting and hypomethylating agents, opening novel approaches in an otherwise incurable disease.\n\nChair:\n\nV.

This session will focus on the clinical management of AML using a comprehensive evaluation including both genetic characterization and MRD-based response assessments during therapy, to optimize the clinical outcomes of patients with AML.\n\nDr. Jerald Radich will examine the role of MRD as an indicator of treatment response, and help answer the question of why some patients with persistent MRD do not relapse, while others without detectable MRD may still relapse nonetheless. He will explore how to best use MRD to optimize patient care, and explore how the mutational landscape of AML at diagnosis and during therapy can help to explain not only the clinical utility of MRD but also key features of leukemia biology.\n\nDr. Michael Heuser will discuss the prognostic impact of MRD status in different genetic risk groups and provide an overview on the available MRD technologies to monitor treatment response in transplant-eligible patients with AML. He will help to unravel the complex matrix of MRD and mutational dependencies for practical clinical application and management decisions in patients with AML.\n\nDr. Courtney DiNardo will summarize the current treatment landscape of AML in patients ineligible for transplant, and focus on the importance of a comprehensive genomic assessment to identify optimal treatment strategies both at diagnosis and relapse. She will also highlight the role of MRD assessments and review the role of MRD measurements to guide treatment decisions in patients receiving non-intensive therapies.\n\nChair:\n\nCourtney D.

This educational session will present clinically oriented approaches to understanding and managing anticoagulation monitoring challenges associated with direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use, heparin monitoring, and anticoagulation for antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.\n\nDr. Deborah Siegal will review the potential benefits and limitations of DOAC measurement. Clinical situations in which DOAC measurement may be helpful will be discussed and DOAC testing options will be presented based on the goal of measurement.\n\nDr. Cheryl Maier will review the definition of heparin resistance which varies depending on specific measurements of anticoagulation and the type of assay used. Multiple causes of heparin resistance will be covered using a case-based approach to help providers troubleshoot heparin resistance and develop alternative management strategies when heparin resistance is encountered.\n\nProf. Hannah Cohen will summarise the use of warfarin in patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Using a case-based approach, she will highlight key considerations in the choice of oral anticoagulant, issues that may impact on accurate monitoring of warfarin anticoagulation in APS patients, and strategies to overcome these. She will also discuss the use and monitoring of low-molecular-weight/unfractionated heparin in APS patients in particular situations.\n\nChair:\n\nDeborah Siegal, MD, MSc\n\nUniversity of Ottawa\n\nOttawa, ON, Canada\n\nSpeakers:\n\nDeborah Siegal, MD, MSc\n\nUniversity of Ottawa\n\nOttawa, ON, Canada\n\nMeasuring the effect of DOACs: Why, When, and How?\n\nCheryl L Maier, MD, PhD\n\nEmory University\n\nAtlanta, GA\n\nTroubleshooting Heparin Resistance\n\nHannah Cohen, MD, FRCP, FRCPath\n\nUniversity College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust\n\nLondon, United Kingdom\n\nWarfarin and Heparin Monitoring in Antiphospholipid Syndrome\n\nBeyond TTP: “Atypical” TMAs for the Hematologist\n\nThe American Society of Hematology educational session will delve into the complexities of thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) outside the typical presentation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).\n\nThe session will address three related disease states: Transplant-Associated Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TA-TMA), atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) and Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (CAPs).\n\nThe segment on TA-TMA will cover its incidence in the post-transplant period, the challenges of distinguishing TA-TMA from other post-transplant complications, and the data on emerging treatment approaches. The session will also include a comprehensive review of aHUS, focusing on its genetic underpinnings, atypical presentations, and the latest advancements in targeted therapies, such as complement inhibitors. The discussion will encapsulate the nuances of managing these atypical TMAs, highlighting case studies and clinical trials that underscore the critical role of personalized medicine in improving patient outcomes. This session will also explore Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome (CAPS), a rare and severe subtype of antiphospholipid syndrome characterized by widespread microvascular thrombi, leading to multiple organ failure. The talk will provide an overview of the pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, and emerging treatment strategies. Discussion will also focus on distinguishing CAPS from other TMAs through clinical presentation and laboratory findings, emphasizing the importance of timely and accurate diagnosis to mitigate the high mortality rate associated with this condition.\n\nChair:\n\nMark Crowther, MS MSc LLM FRCPC FRSC\n\nMcMaster University\n\nHamilton, ON, Canada\n\nSpeakers:\n\nAnuja Java\n\nWashington University in St. Louis\n\nSt. Louis, MO\n\nAtypical HUS: Diagnosis, Management, and Discontinuation Therapy\n\nAng Li, MD,MS\n\nBaylor College of Medicine\n\nHouston, TX\n\nTransplant Associated TMA: The Conundrum of Diagnosis and Treatment\n\nMark Crowther, MS MSc LLM FRCPC FRSC\n\nMcMaster University\n\nHamilton, ON, Canada\n\nCatastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome (CAPS) and Anticoagulant-Refractory APS\n\nChallenges and Opportunities of Sickle Cell Care in Africa\n\nThis session will discuss the current state of therapies for sickle cell disease in Africa.

The case will be made to prioritize widespread use of hydroxyurea therapy as the bedrock of sickle cell anemia care in Africa.\n\nChair:\n\nIsaac Odame\n\nThe Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) and the University of Toronto\n\nToronto, ON, Canada\n\nSpeakers:\n\nObiageli E Nnodu, MD\n\nUniversity of Abuja\n\nAbuja, Nigeria\n\nNewborn Screening Initiatives for Sickle Cell Disease in Africa\n\nIsaac Odame\n\nThe Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) and the University of Toronto\n\nToronto, ON, Canada\n\nTransfusion, Disease-Modifying Treatments, and Curative Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease in Africa: Where Are We Now?\n\nKofi A. Anie\n\nLondon North West University Healthcare NHS Trust and Imperial College London\n\nLondon, ENG, United Kingdom\n\nThe Intersection of Sickle Cell Disease, Stigma, and Pain in Africa\n\nChallenges in Cancer-Associated Thrombosis\n\nPatients with cancer have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) for which anticoagulation is the treatment of choice. However, they also commonly face complications related to cancer itself or cancer therapies that create unique challenges for the management of cancer-associated thrombosis. This educational session will explore the evidence for best practices in assessing and managing challenging scenarios in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis, including patients with brain metastasis, recurrent venous thromboembolism despite anticoagulation, and thrombocytopenia.\n\nDr. Leader will summarize the evidence of anticoagulant use in patients with brain metastasis, discuss risks and benefits of anticoagulation in these patients and optimal management strategies in this high-risk population.\n\nDr. Zwicker will discuss the challenges of evaluating and managing patients with cancer and new or progressive VTE on anticoagulation. He will discuss diagnostic strategies to identify etiologies for anticoagulant failure and provide therapeutic options in this patient population.\n\nDr. Ay will address the challenge of concurrent VTE and thrombocytopenia in patients with cancer. He will summarize data from available literature, review guidance recommendations, and discuss management strategies and future directions in these patients.\n\nChair:\n\nTzu-Fei Wang, MD,MPH\n\nOttawa Hospital Research Institute, University of Ottawa\n\nOttawa, ON, Canada\n\nSpeakers:\n\nAvi Leader, MD\n\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center\n\nNew York, NY\n\nManagement of Anticoagulation in Patients With Brain Metastasis\n\nJeffrey Zwicker, MD\n\nMemorial Sloan Kettering\n\nNYC, NY\n\nTrousseau’s Syndrome: Management of Refractory VTE\n\nCihan Ay\n\nMedical University of Vienna\n\nVienna, Austria\n\nTreatment of VTE in the Thrombocytopenic Cancer Patient\n\nChasing Zebras: Navigating Rare Myeloid Neoplasms\n\nIt turns out the old adage from our medical school days, “If you hear hoofbeats, think of horses, not zebras,” was not completely correct! Indeed, the diagnosis of a “rare disease” turns out to be not as rare as we previously thought. The faculty speaking in this important session have focused their entire careers to patient care and cutting-edge research in areas of rare and even ultra-rare hematologic malignancies. The coupling of increasing pathologic technology and diagnostic methods along with augmented education and awareness have shed light on some of the more rare blood cancers in our field, especially over the past decade. In particular, in the field of myeloid neoplasms, the emerging importance of dividing these entities into specific subgroups distinguished by unique clinicopathologic characteristics has had a tremendous impact not only on diagnosis, but also on prognosis and development of novel treatment decision approaches.\n\nIn this first talk, Dr Robert P Hasserjian focuses his remarks on understanding the growing field of chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) and CSF3R-related disorders. In the decade since the elucidation by, Maxson et al (Maxson, NEJM 2013), of frequent oncogenic CSF3R mutations in patients with CNL and atypical CML, this field has rapidly expanded as we are beginning to understand that these Philadelphia negative hematologic myeloid malignancies are more commonly present than we previously thought.\n\nIn the second talk, Dr Naveen Pemmaraju highlights the encouraging developments in a rapidly emerging field in hematologic malignancies, that of Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm (BPDCN). BPDCN is a singularly unique malignancy that is known for involving cutaneous sites, followed by bone marrow/blood lymph nodes, and of interest, a high rate of CNS involvement. Despite many nomenclature and disease category changes over the past three decades, BPDCN is now recognized as its own unique entity which expresses, via flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry: CD123+, along with CD4+, CD56+, TCL-1+ and TCF-4+. The clinical pioneering of the first approved CD123-targeted agent in the field (tagraxofusp, led by Pemmaraju et al NEJM April 2019) has led to the development of a worldwide clinical/translational interest in BPDCN, targeting CD123 by various therapeutic approaches, and for interest in developing combination approaches and CNS-directed therapies for this rare blood cancer.\n\nIn the final talk of this session, Dr Olga Weinberg very nicely draws attention to acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage, a field that is rapidly growing as it benefits from deeper, faster, and more directed targeted sequencing efforts and improved patho-biologic understanding of the various subsets that make up this unique entity. Among the keys to this topic will be understanding several of the newer tests, at the level of the blood, bone marrow, flow cytometry, cytogenetics and molecular next generation sequencing that are available in the pathologists’ and clinicians’ tool kits in searching for identification and diagnosis of particular subtypes of this historically elusive diagnosis that is becoming more and more common to encounter.\n\nChair:\n\nNaveen Pemmaraju, MD\n\nMD Anderson Cancer Center\n\nHouston, TX\n\nSpeakers:\n\nRobert P Hasserjian, MD\n\nMassachusetts General Hospital\n\nBoston, MA\n\nThe Spectrum of Ph Negative Disease: CNL and CSF3R-Related Disorders\n\nNaveen Pemmaraju, MD\n\nMD Anderson Cancer Center\n\nHouston, TX\n\nBPDCN State of the Art\n\nOlga K. Weinberg, MD\n\nUT Southwestern\n\nDallas, TX\n\nHow to Think About Acute Leukemia of Ambiguous Lineage\n\nFollicular Lymphoma: Playing the Long Game\n\nThe prolonged survival for most patients with newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma in 2024 is a triumph of the introduction of rituximab a quarter of a century ago. Our improved understanding of follicular lymphoma biology, the heterogeneity of both disease and patients, and new therapeutic options help us in “choosing wisely” the sequencing of treatment for a given patient. We can now be confident of a median 10 years between first and second treatments along with an age-matched survival for patients in sustained remission after immunochemotherapy. In this session, we map the remaining challenges of identifying the minority of patients with early progression and a poor prognosis, as well as the sequencing of the highly promising T-cell immunotherapies for patients with early or multiply-relapsed disease.\n\nIn this talk, Dr. Trotman will provide the survival data to equip clinicians in framing optimistic initial conversations with most patients at diagnosis of advanced stage FL. She outlines the expectations of longevity and a “functional cure” for many. She will address considerations of both patient and FL heterogeneity when discussing initial therapy of high tumor burden disease.

TP53-mutated myeloid disease is associated with complex cytogenetic abnormalities and poor outcome, with a median survival of only 5-10 months. In this educational session, we will explore the impact of TP53 mutation type and number on outcomes and clinical management. We will review current and emerging treatment approaches for this high-risk subtype of AML/MDS.\n\nDr. Daniel Link will discuss evidence that TP53 hotspot mutations have dominant negative or gain-of function properties and discuss the potential impact on outcome and clinical management. He will review recent data establishing the importance of determining TP53 mutant allele status (monoallelic versus multi-hit).\n\nDr. Marina Konopleva will review current non-transplant therapeutic approaches for TP53-mutated myeloid disease and discuss new therapies on the horizon, including chimeric antigen receptor therapies, mutated p53 reactivators, Fc fusion protein and monoclonal antibodies targeting various myeloid antigens.\n\nDr. Hugo Fernandez will discuss the use of allogenic hematopoietic transplant in the treatment of TP53-mutated myeloid disease, including new approaches to tailor conditioning and use maintenance therapy after transplantation.\n\nChair:\n\nDaniel C Link, MD\n\nWashington University School of Medicine in St. Louis\n\nSaint Louis, MO\n\nSpeakers:\n\nDaniel C Link, MD\n\nWashington University School of Medicine in St. Louis\n\nSaint Louis, MO\n\nAre TP53 Mutations All Alike?\n\nMarina Konopleva\n\nAlbert Einstein College of Medicine\n\nHouston, TX\n\nNon-transplant Treatment Approaches for High-risk TP53 Myeloid Disease\n\nHugo Francisco Fernandez, MD\n\nMoffitt Malignant Hematology and Cellular Therapy\n\nPembroke Pines, FL\n\nTransplant Options and Outcomes for TP53 Myeloid Disease\n\nHematologic Challenges at the End-of-Life\n\nManagement of hematologic conditions for patients at the end of life is both a challenge and an opportunity to provide evidence-based, compassionate care. Care of seriously ill patients entails specific considerations—including incorporating life expectancy, addressing symptom burden, and navigating hospice—that apply across the spectrum of hematologic diseases. Further, there is a growing, multidisciplinary evidence base to support treatment decision-making that this session will review. First, we will discuss optimization of end-of-life care in transfusion-dependent hematologic malignancies. We will then focus on a strategy for management of anticoagulant medications in those with limited life expectancy. Finally, we will address prognostication and palliative care in sickle cell disease.\n\nDr. Loh will highlight challenges and barriers in implementing timely end-of-life-care and potential strategies to overcome these barriers for patients with transfusion-dependent hematologic malignancies.\n\nDr. Park's talk \"Anticoagulation at the End of Life: Whether, When, and How to Treat,\" will focus on state-of-the-art evidence from hematology and palliative care science to inform management of anticoagulant medications in patients with life-limiting illness. Dr. Parks will discuss the complexities of anticoagulation at the end of life, opportunities to enhance our knowledge, and outline an approach to care that is based on patients’ values.\n\nDr. Johnston will discuss challenges in providing high quality end-of-life care for people with SCD, including disease-related, communication-related, and systemic-related challenges and discuss strategies to overcome these challenges, including use of primary and specialty palliative care.\n\nChair:\n\nAnna L.

Due to several medical, economic and social factors, it remains a significantly underdiagnosed and undertreated condition. Hematologists play an important role in the evaluation and care of patients with anemia from chronic blood loss, and may be the first clinicians to identify HMB as its cause. This education session will describe a clinical multidisciplinary approach to the evaluation and treatment of patients presenting with HMB, with a special focus on adolescents. It will provide an overview of diagnostic and management strategies to broaden the tools available to hematologists caring for these patients in different clinical settings.\n\nDr. Allison P Wheeler will discuss the various tools available for the quantification of menstrual blood loss, including those that evaluate the effect of HMB on quality of life; followed by a description of non-surgical (hormonal and non-hormonal) treatments of HMB, their efficacy, contraindications and selection of the most appropriate therapy using shared decision-making.\n\nDr. Juliana Perez Botero will present a focused approach to laboratory testing (screening and confirmatory) for patients presenting with HMB in whom von Willebrand Disease is suspected, with emphasis on the effect of pre-analytical variables and testing methodology on the results and their clinical interpretation.\n\nDr. Janice Staber will discuss the value of multidisciplinary clinics specializing in the care of adolescents with HMB, including their critical components and different care delivery models, and share important lessons learned during the development and implementation of one of these clinics.\n\nChair:\n\nJuliana Perez Botero, MD\n\nVersiti\n\nMilwaukee, WI\n\nSpeakers:\n\nAllison P Wheeler, MD/MSCI\n\nWashington Center for Bleeding Disorders\n\nSeattle, WA\n\nQuantifying Menorrhagia and Overview of Non-Surgical Management of Heavy Menstrual Bleeding\n\nJuliana Perez Botero, MD\n\nVersiti\n\nMilwaukee, WI\n\nVon Willebrand Disease and Heavy Menstrual Bleeding: When and How to Test\n\nJanice Staber, MD\n\nUniversity of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital\n\nIowa City, IA\n\nHeavy Menstrual Bleeding Clinics for Adolescents\n\nHIT-and-Run: Challenges in Diagnosis and Management of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia\n\nIn hospitalized patients, the diagnosis and management of heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a recurrent challenge. To this end, this session will 1) provide evidence-based practical guidance in the diagnosis and management of suspected and confirmed HIT; 2) classify anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibody mediated disorders (autoimmune HIT), their relationship to heparin exposure, and the role of rapid PF4 and platelet activation assays in diagnosis; and 3) review alternative management strategies when heparin cessation and non-heparin anticoagulants are insufficient in patients who have refractory HIT, experience acute bleeding, or are planned to undergo cardiac surgery. Emphasizing evidence-based strategies, this session will provide practical approaches and system-level interventions for high-quality care.\n\nChair:\n\nToyosi Onwuemene, MD,MS\n\nDuke University\n\nDurham, NC\n\nSpeakers:\n\nJori E.

He will discuss nondesirable on-target and off-target effects, cardiovascular and other safety concerns, and provide a benefit/risk-based perspective on how this new class of oral drugs might impact current management of anemia in CKD. A clinical case is presented that highlights the clinical complexities and therapeutic challenges in the management of anemia in patients with CKD.\n\nProf. Taher will highlight persisting unmet needs in patients with non-transfusion-dependent and transfusion-dependent ß-thalassemia. His presentation will overview the current evidence base for luspatercept as a novel disease-modifying agent targeting ineffective erythropoiesis in ß-thalassemia. He will also provide guidance on best-practices for practical application of luspatercept in the real world setting and identify emerging data gaps.\n\nFor Dr. Dickey’s presentation, she will review the givosiran clinical trial data and the available clinical literature on givosiran, as well as highlight important unanswered questions.\n\nChair:\n\nAli T.

Disturbed coordination is exemplified by sideroblastic anemias, which are characterized by insufficient incorporation of iron into the end product of the prophyrin biosynthesis pathway, resulting in anemia and mitochondrial as well as systemic iron overload. Conversely, iron overload from other causes, like hereditary hemochromatosis, can have unfavourable effects on porphyrin synthesis, provoking porphyria cutanea tarda. The intricate interplay between iron and porphyrin metabolism can be disturbed by inherited or acquired causes. Therapeutic options to mitigate the ensuing clinical symptoms are highlighted by the three speakers of this session.\n\nDr. Domenico Girelli will discuss hereditary hemochromatosis according to the recent clinically oriented classification. While hyperferritinemia is common in practice, hemochromatosis accounts for few cases, typically with increased transferrin saturation. HFE-related hemochromatosis has a low penetrance, influenced by lifestyle and dysmetabolic factors. Most patients are currently identified in the early phases before life-threatening manifestations. Phlebotomy remains the mainstay for achieving iron depletion, with blood donation being an option for maintenance. The management of rare, severe non-HFE forms, requiring a comprehensive approach, will also be presented.\n\nDr. Norbert Gattermann will outline the pathophysiology of systemic iron overload in MDS as well as mitochondrial iron accumulation in patients with acquired sideroblastic anemias. He will explain how SF3B1 mutations and the subsequent missplicing and deficiency of ABCB7 may lead to impaired heme synthesis and excess mitochondrial iron. The rationale for iron chelation therapy in MDS will be considered, together with some of its practical aspects. Finally, Dr. Gattermann will assess the extent to which luspatercept might contribute to the management of iron overload in patients with MDS.\n\nDr. Rebecca Leaf will focus on porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), a disorder of heme biosynthesis that arises due to inhibition of hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase in the setting of increased liver iron content and oxidative stress. Patients with PCT invariably have siderosis on liver biopsy and up to 20% are homozygous for the HFE C282Y mutation. PCT manifests as blistering cutaneous lesions on sun-exposed areas, skin fragility, and elevated plasma and urine porphyrins. Treatment includes therapeutic phlebotomy to decrease total body iron levels and hydroxychloroquine, which reduces hepatic porphyrin content.\n\nChair:\n\nNorbert Gattermann, MD\n\nHeinrich Heine University Dusseldorf\n\nDusseldorf, Germany\n\nSpeakers:\n\nDomenico Girelli, MD,PhD\n\nUniversity of Verona\n\nVerona, Italy\n\nDiagnosis and Management of Hereditary Hemochromatosis: Lifestyle Modification, Phlebotomy, and Blood Donation\n\nNorbert Gattermann, MD\n\nHeinrich Heine University Dusseldorf\n\nDusseldorf, Germany\n\nManagement of Iron Overload in Acquired Sideroblastic Anemias and MDS: Role of Chelation and Luspatercept\n\nRebecca Leaf\n\nMass General Hospital Cancer Center\n\nBoston, MA\n\nPorphyria Cutanea Tarda: A Unique Iron-Related Disorder\n\nIt's a Different World: CLL 2024\n\nThe treatment of CLL has significantly advanced over the past decade with the introduction of novel targeted therapies. Inhibitors of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) as well as BCL2 have supplanted chemoimmunotherapy in both frontline and relapsed therapy. However, while outcomes have improved in the current era, the disease is not cured, and questions still remain about optimal therapies for frontline and relapsed disease. This education session will focus on unanswered questions in CLL, and how current and upcoming research can answer these questions and continue to move the field forward. Dr Stephan Stilgenbauer will discuss risk stratification in CLL and how genomic features influence treatment choice in the frontline setting. He will discuss the implications of genomic risk on outcomes with currently available therapies. Dr Jennifer Woyach will discuss the evidence surrounding doublets and triplets in the frontline treatment of CLL. She will discuss scenarios in which doublets or triplets might be preferred over other standard options, and current and future trials that will help elucidate the use of these treatment for patients. Dr Arnon Kater will discuss the role of immunotherapies in relapsed/refractory CLL. He will discuss the current evidence surrounding transplant, as well as newer paradigms including cellular therapies and bispecific antibodies.\n\nChair:\n\nJennifer A.

While it is clinically silent, the premalignant MGUS clone has the potential to progress to multiple myeloma or a related B-cell lymphoproliferative malignancy usually associated with high tumor burden. In contrast, monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS) is characterized by a small quiescent B-cell clone but significant symptoms caused by the monoclonal immunoglobulin affecting the skin, kidneys and/or nervous system.\n\nDr. Michaela Liedtke will present recent updates in the epidemiology of MGUS and prevalence of associated conditions based on population screening studies. Recommendations for a cost-effective diagnostic and follow-up approach will be discussed as well as diagnostic advances including mass spectrometry and revised light chain criteria. We will review updates in MGUS risk stratification related to genetics and other clone & host factors and discuss evidence for the emerging role of lifestyle interventions. The presentation will conclude with a brief overview of MGCS and highlight the clinical features and international collaboration that led to the discovery of TEMPI syndrome.\n\nDr Frank Bridoux will present the main characteristics of the different types of renal disorders associated with MGUS and introduce the concept of monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS). The classification of MGRS-related renal disorders will be presented as well as the diagnostic work-up. The principles of hematologic and renal management of MGRS will be described.\n\nDr. Maite Cibeira will talk to us about monoclonal gammopathy of neurological significance with the aim of simplifying the hematologist’s diagnostic approach, in close collaboration with the neurologist. She will also discuss the available treatment strategies taking into account the rarity of these diseases, which makes it difficult to conduct clinical trials and explains the lack of standardized treatment options, as well as the relevance of supportive care in the context of an essential multidisciplinary management.\n\nChair:\n\nMichaela Liedtke, MD\n\nStanford University Cancer Center\n\nStanford, CA\n\nSpeakers:\n\nMichaela Liedtke, MD\n\nStanford University Cancer Center\n\nStanford, CA\n\nMGUS Where Do We Stand Today?\n\nFrank Bridoux, MD, PhD\n\nCHU Poitiers\n\nPoitiers, France\n\nRenal Manifestations of MGUS\n\nM Teresa Cibeira López, MD, PhD\n\nHospital Clinic of Barcelona, University of Barcelona, IDIBAPS\n\nBarcelona, Spain\n\nNeurological Manifestations of MGUS\n\nMoving the Needle in Hodgkin Lymphoma\n\nAfter decades of small incremental shifts in the management of classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), recent studies have accelerated the pace of change in the treatment of cHL. While brentuximab vedotin (BV) has become a standard part of initial treatment for advanced stage disease, studies using PD-1 blockade in the frontline setting are leading to a re-examination of the role of these novel agents for the treatment of cHL. Meanwhile, the novel agents have led to improved outcomes for patients with relapsed/refractory cHL, leading to questions about the timing and role of stem cell transplantation and whether novel therapies alone can lead to durable remission. Dr. Lynch will address whether recent studies using PD1 blockade in frontline treatment of cHL have established a new standard of care for cHL. Dr. Advani will examine the role of BV in the initial treatment of cHL as well as for relapsed/refractory cHL in light of the recent studies in the frontline and salvage setting. Dr. Perales will discuss the evolving role of stem cell transplantation for cHL, optimal salvage regimens, timing and patient selection.\n\nChair:\n\nAlex F.

The clinical care of patients with MPN is evolving, with increasing evidence indicating that molecular genetic data is an important component of care, both at diagnosis and during follow up. Approximately three years after the approval of ropeginterferon by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Polycythemia Vera (PV), it is timely to review the role of pegylated interferon in the treatment of MPN. Finally, as the obstetric population with MPN increases, understanding how to optimize care for patients with MPN during pregnancy is increasingly relevant. Attendees can expect to learn MPN practice pearls in all three sessions!\n\nDr. Mead will discuss current approaches to molecular profiling of MPN patients, using illustrative clinical case histories to demonstrate how genetic analysis is already fully integrated into MPN diagnostic classification and prognostic risk stratification. He will discuss how molecular profiling can also be used in MPN to measure response to therapy both in clinical trials and routine clinical practice. Taking a forward look, he will discuss how molecular profiling in MPN might be used in the future to select specific molecularly targeted therapies and the role of additional genetic methodologies beyond mutation analysis.\n\nDr. Kiladjian will discuss the use of pegylated interferon for the treatment of MPN and review the different types of pegylated interferon currently available. He will review in which MPN subtypes pegylated interferon has the greatest clinical efficacy and discuss both hematological and molecular response. He will review the mechanism of action of pegylated interferon and link this to potential for disease modification and prevention of MPN progression. Finally, he will review the limitations of clinical studies with respect to their ability to measure MPN progression, as well as the need for more comprehensive assessment of molecular response.\n\nDr. Chi-Joan How will discuss practices around the management of pregnancy in MPN patients. As the obstetric population ages and MPNs are being increasingly diagnosed in younger patients, pregnancy in MPNs will become more frequently encountered. She will discuss current data surrounding pregnancy outcomes in MPNs and current recommendations for the use of anti-platelet agents, anticoagulation, and cytoreduction in the ante- and post-partum period. Using a case-based approach, Dr. How will suggest best practices in areas with limited data.\n\nChair:\n\nAnn Mullally, MD\n\nStanford University School of Medicine\n\nStanford, CA\n\nSpeakers:\n\nAdam J Mead, PhD, MRCP, FRCPath\n\nUniversity of Oxford\n\nOxford, ENG, United Kingdom\n\nMolecular Profiling in MPN: Who Should Have It and Why?\n\nJean-Jacques Kiladjian, MD, PhD\n\nHopital Saint-Louis\n\nParis, France\n\nPegylated IFN: The Who, Why, and How\n\nChi-Joan How, MD\n\nBrigham and Women's Hospital\n\nBoston, MA\n\nPregnancy: MPN Management Before, During, and After Pregnancy\n\nNewly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma: Many Choices and More Questions\n\nThe treatment of newly diagnosed myeloma has evolved rapidly with the new therapies and different combinations of these, resulting in deeper and more durable responses. The use of autologous stem cell transplantation has also evolved with this progress, and increasingly the initial treatment is being determined agnostic of the transplant eligibility and or desirability. In the decision making process, two factors play an important role, namely the underlying disease risk and the patient functional status or frailty. In particular, increasing disase risk calls for more intense treatments with the goal of achieving MRD negativity while frailty often limits the intensity of the combinations. Phase 3 trials continue to explore the role of quadruplet regimes in older patient populations with increasing depth of response and durable responses, and the nature of the combinations will evolve in the coming years with new classes of drugs being introduced, especially immunotherapies.\n\nAutologous stem cell transplant has been an integral part of myeloma therapy for the past three decades. Originally envisaged as consolidation following initial treatment of newly diagnosed MM in those eligible to undergo the procedure, its role has evolved over time with investigations exploring various aspects including the types of conditioning regimens, role of post-transplant maintenance as well as tandem autologous stem cell transplantation. While the original phase 3 trials compared ASCT with no ASCT and demonstrated improved overall survival, subsequent trials studied the paradigm of delayed ASCT at the time of first relapse, demonstrating significant improvement in PFS but no OS advantage. As the initial therapies for treatment of myeloma has improved with high rate of deep responses, the role of ACT have continued ot be debated, but have maintained its position in the treatment with most recent trials continuing to show an improvement in PFS compared with no ASCT. Dr. Perrot's talk will focus on how ASCT is positioned in the treatment paradigm of MM.\n\nThe overall survival in patients with MM over recent decades. This trend is anticipated to further advance with the emergence of T-cell redirecting therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy and T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies. Despite these therapeutic advancements, treatment-related adverse events likely impede quality of life. This underscores the imperative of optimizing supportive care strategies to maximize treatment outcomes. Such optimization is crucial not only for patient well-being but also for treatment adherence to sustain long-term disease control. Dr. Zweegmen will discuss treatment and prevention of bone disease, state of the art thrombosis prophylaxis and supportive care during T-cell redirecting therapies targeting BCMA and GPRC5d, amongst which prevention of infections.\n\nChair:\n\nShaji Kumar, MD\n\nMayo Clinic\n\nRochester, MN\n\nSpeakers:\n\nShaji Kumar, MD\n\nMayo Clinic\n\nRochester, MN\n\nWhat Is the Ideal Approach – Doublet, Triplet or Quadruplet(s)?\n\nAurore Perrot, MD, PhD\n\nCHU de Toulouse, IUCT-O, Université de Toulouse, UPS, Service d’Hématologie\n\nToulouse, France\n\nTransplant in Myeloma: Who, When, and Why?\n\nSonja Zweegman, MD, PhD\n\nAmsterdam University Medical Center, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam\n\nAmsterdam, Netherlands\n\nSupportive Care in Myeloma – When Treating the Clone Alone Is Not Enough\n\nNot All Lymphadenopathy is Lymphoma: Lymphoproliferative Diseases of Immune Dysregulation\n\nImmune dysregulation often causes lymphadenopathy that requires clinicopathological correlation for accurate diagnosis. This session will review important causes of lymphadenopathy that fall outside the typical spectrum of malignant lymphoma. Castleman disease, IgG4-Related disease and the relationship between EBV and Post-transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder will be reviewed. A common theme among these sessions is the importance of combining clinical, laboratory, and pathological “clues” to arrive at the best possible diagnosis and management plan.\n\nDr. Fajgenbaum will provide an overview on the classification, diagnosis, and management of Castleman disease. Castleman disease is a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative disorders, and idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) can be particularly difficult to diagnose and distinguish from other inflammatory causes of lymphadenopathy. Diagnostic criteria for iMCD and the subtypes of iMCD including thrombocytopenia, anasarca, (reticulin) fibrosis, renal dysfunction and organomegaly (iMCD-TAFRO), idiopathic plasmacytic lymphadenopathy (iMCD-IPL) and not otherwise specified (iMCD-NOS) will be reviewed.\n\nDr. Chen will review IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), a disease of immune dysregulation with protean manifestations including autoimmune pancreatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, lacrimal and salivary gland swelling, and tubulointerstitial nephritis. The session will focus on an approach to four key manifestations for Hematologists: Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, IgG4-positive plasma cell enriched lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, and retroperitoneal fibrosis. Practical tips for differentiating IgG4-RD from key mimickers such as Castleman disease, eosinophilic vasculitis, and histiocyte disorders will be highlighted.\n\nDr. Rouce will discuss the interplay between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Post-tranplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). The spectrum of PTLD includes three variations of lymphoproliferation: lymphoid hyperplasia, neoplasia and malignancy. Lymphoid hyperplasia is characterized by polyclonal proliferation and non-destructive lesions whereas lymphoid malignancy features monoclonal proliferation and destructive lesions. EBV is the main driver of PTLD, and management ranges from reduction in immunosuppression to intensive, lymphoma-directed therapy.\n\nChair:\n\nLuke Y. C.

This educational session will provide a practical guide for effectively using disease modifying medications, the best practices on delivering multi-modal acute pain management, and examples of successful, real-world adaptive clinical care models. Finally, it will discuss the remaining research questions to answer in these areas to optimize the outcomes of individuals with SCD.\n\nDr. Creary will discuss the disease modifying medications for SCD. The talk will offer practical guidance on how to overcome common treatment barriers and to use disease modifying medications in a way that balances the unique characteristics of these medications and the patients’ desired outcomes.\n\nDr. Brandow will discuss alternative methods for acute vaso-occlusive pain management. The talk will review recent research that support using non-opioid and non-pharmacologic interventions and the care delivery processes that have been shown to improve acute SCD pain outcomes\n\nDr. Bartolucci will discuss updating the existing clinical care models to be more personalized, adaptive, and collaborative, in response to the diverse experiences for those with SCD.

Still, in patients patients transplanted for malignant diseases, reappearance of the original cancer, or relapse, continue to represent a crucial clinical issue. This educational session will present current knowledge on the biology of relapse, on how to tailor the transplant protocol to reduce its incidence, and on the use of novel drugs to prevent or treat recurrence.\n\nDr. Luca Vago will outline available evidence on the dynamic changes occurring in cancer cells and the patient immune system upon allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, with a particular focus on how key aspects of the transplant such as donor choice and use of specific drugs impact on disease evolution, and on how state-of-the-art profiling of relapsed disease can help selecting appropriate countermeasures.\n\nDr. Ito's session begins by highlighting the current evidence of maintenance therapy for post-transplant relapse prevention, including targeted therapies, hypomethylating agents, venetoclax, and immunotherapies. The talk then shifts the focus to the role of relapse monitoring, emphasizing the importance of measurable residual disease and donor chimerism. Finally, the session will review the salvage therapies for overt relapse, including donor lymphocyte infusion, second allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and selected agents under investigation.\n\nDr. Pierini will speak on novel conditioning and prophylaxis regimens for relapse prevention.\n\nChair:\n\nLuca Vago, MD,PhD\n\nIRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele\n\nMilano, Italy\n\nSpeakers:\n\nLuca Vago, MD,PhD\n\nIRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele\n\nMilano, Italy\n\nBiology of Transplant Relapse: Actionable Features\n\nAntonio Pierini, MD,PhD\n\nUniversity of Perugia\n\nPerugia, Italy\n\nNovel Conditioning and Prophylaxis Regimens for Relapse Prevention\n\nSawa Ito, MD,PhD\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\n\nPittsburgh, PA\n\nPost-transplant Strategies for Relapse Prevention and Treatment\n\nSex Hormones, Contraceptives, and Thrombotic Risk: Where Are We Now?\n\nVenous thromboembolism is a common disease, with an incidence of one to three per 1000 individuals per year. Numerous risk factors are known, which can be divided into genetic and acquired. One of the most well-known acquired risk factors is exposure to endogenous (i.e. pregnancy) and exogenous female hormones, including oral contraceptive use, hormone substitution therapy, and gender-affirming hormone therapy. Thrombosis specialists are frequently consulted about optimal hormonal therapy in individuals with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, as well as optimal management of pregnancy-related venous thromboembolism.\n\nDr Leslie Skeith will cover contraceptive-related VTE risk by agent and by clinical scenario, including in patients with inherited thrombophilia, systemic lupus erythematosus with or without antiphospholipid antibodies or antiphospholipid syndrome, and sickle cell disease considering contraception. Relevant clinical practice guidelines are reviewed. A multidisciplinary approach to counselling is needed for patient-focused decision-making.\n\nDr Joseph Shatzel will explore the hematologic complications of gender-affirming therapy, with a particular focus on managing and mitigating the thrombotic risks linked to exogenous estrogen use. He will detail existing data on thrombotic risks reported in transgender individuals and provide insights from studies involving cisgender women and men who receive exogenous estrogen and testosterone, providing important contextual background. He will delve into strategies for addressing testosterone-induced erythrocytosis and iron deficiency in transgender individuals undergoing hormone therapy.\n\nDr Saskia Middeldorp will present clinical cases of VTE related to hormonal contraceptive use and pregnancy to illustrate key considerations for clinical practice. Practice points for primary VTE treatment and the evidence on the risk of recurrent VTE and bleeding in this population are detailed. The potential value of thrombophilia testing is described including the: “who, why, when, what and how”. We also discuss key aspects of shared decision making for anticoagulant duration, including a reduced dose anticoagulant strategy in hormone-related VTE.\n\nChair:\n\nSaskia Middeldorp, MD, PhD\n\nRadboud university medical center\n\nNijmegen, Netherlands\n\nSpeakers:\n\nLeslie Skeith\n\nUniversity of Calgary\n\nCalgary, AB, Canada\n\nEstrogen, Progestin, and Beyond: Thrombotic Risk and Contraceptive Choices\n\nJoseph J.

This has lead to an expanding number of therapeutic options for patients and physicians to consider as they embark on their therapeutic journey with ITP. Dr. Waleed Ghanima will discuss the new approaches incorporating combination strategies in management of patients with ITP including suggestions for when to consider moving beyond mono therapy for ITP. Dr. Annemarie Fogerty will then discuss updates on ITP in pregnancy, a special category of ITP with implications for both maternal and fetal health and provide the most information on both treatments and outcomes. Finally, Dr. Michele Lambert will then describe current clinical trials (or recently completed) and provide information on novel therapeutics that are in development as well as the current treatment gaps where additional study is needed.\n\nChair:\n\nMichele P.

Lambert, MD\n\nChildren's Hospital of Philadelphia\n\nPhiladelphia, PA\n\nOn the Horizon: Upcoming New Agents for the Management of ITP\n\nVascular Anomalies, Vascular Malformations, and the Role of the Hematologist\n\nVascular anomalies have traditionally been managed by surgical and interventional radiology colleagues. However, an evolving understanding of the pathophysiology, genetic landscape and hematologic outcomes will necessitate involvement from hematologists and oncologists for comprehensive care. This session will explore the molecular underpinnings and genetic factors of these conditions, highlighting the shift towards targeted medical therapies informed by recent discoveries in crucial signaling pathways. The talks will also cover the management of hemostasis and thrombosis risks, stressing the need for a multidisciplinary approach to diagnostics and treatment to enhance patient safety and outcomes. Together, these talks will shed light on the latest scientific advancements and their translation into clinical practices highlighting the pivotal role hematologists and oncologists play in this specialized care.\n\nDr. Vikkula will present an overview of the current understanding of the pathophysiological foundations of vascular anomalies. He will examine how genetic associations across various clinical cases inform the diagnostic work-up and classification of these conditions. Additionally, he will discuss the pathophysiological effects of the characterized pathogenic variants, which underlie the basis of developing targeted medical therapies for vascular anomalies.\n\nDr. Borst’s talk will review currently available medical therapies for vascular anomalies, review guidelines for drug dosing and monitoring, and introduce some novel therapeutics. The discovery of somatic pathogenic variants in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras/MAPK intracellular signaling pathways as drivers of vascular anomalies has led to a new era of precision medicine for these malformations and tumors. Hematologists/oncologists are critical to the care of patients with vascular anomalies, owing to expertise in managing targeted medical therapies.\n\nDr. Crary’s talk will focus on the evolving role of hematologists in diagnosing and managing consumptive coagulopathy associated with vascular anomalies such as kaposiform hemangioendothelioma and slow-flow vascular malformations She will emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary approaches, especially in peri-operative settings, to prevent complications like bleeding and venous thromboembolism. The talk illustrates the use of clinical signs, imaging, laboratory findings, and anticoagulation therapy to improve patient outcomes.\n\nChair:\n\nShelley E Crary, MD, MS\n\nArkansas Children's Hospital\n\nLittle Rock, AR\n\nSpeakers:\n\nMiikka Vikkula, MD, PhD\n\nUniversite Catholique De Louvain\n\nBrussels, Belgium\n\nMolecular Landscape and Classification of Vascular Anomalies\n\nAlexandra Jane Borst, MD\n\nThe Children's Hospital of Philadelphia\n\nPhiladelphia, PA\n\nTargeted Medical Therapies for Vascular Anomalies\n\nShelley E Crary, MD, MS\n\nArkansas Children's Hospital\n\nLittle Rock, AR\n\nHemostasis and Thrombosis Risks and Management in Vascular Anomalies\n\nEducation Spotlight Sessions\n\nCurative Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease: Option for Some but Not Quite All\n\nDespite substantial improvements in care, individuals with sickle cell disease continue to experience substantial morbidity and a shortened life expectancy. With recent advances in the development of curative therapies, including allogeneic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy, it is important to identify barriers to accessing these treatments and adequately define suitable candidates for curative therapies.\n\nIn this session, Dr. Santosh Saraf will review the current guidelines for curative therapies, discuss the potential benefits and risks of the different curative therapies, and provide insight on when to refer patients for curative therapy.\n\nIn the second presentation, Dr. Payal Desai will discuss the various barriers to accessing curative therapies as well as the need for development of an integrated care approach.\n\nChair:\n\nKenneth I.

Adoption of routine prophylaxis to prevent bleeding as the standard of care has led to many children growing into adulthood with normal joint function and adults with improved function and quality of life. However, there remains a continued treatment burden and bleeding events, including spontaneous hemorrhage. Newer therapeutics with regulatory approval and in late phase clinical trial may further decrease the treatment burden and improve efficacy. This session will provide an update on gene therapy for hemophilia and discuss gene therapy in the context of new and coming therapies.\n\nFrank W.G. Leebeek, MD, PhD\n\nThe Promise of Gene Therapy for Severe Hemophilia A\n\nIn the past decade enormous improvements have been made in delivering AAV-based gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A. In several phase 1 and 3 studies patients reached normal levels of FVIII after a single dose of AAV-delivered FVIII-gene construct, leading to reduced bleeding rates and patients could stop regular FVIII prophylaxis. During follow up of more than five years FVIII activity declined over time, however the majority of patients still have residual FVIII expression enabling them to refrain for prophylaxis. These promising results led to FDA and EMA approval of gene therapy for hemophilia A in 2022. Longer term follow-up is needed to show us the duration of benefits and (potential) drawbacks of gene therapy compared to current and other novel treatments.\n\nChristine L Kempton, MD, MSc\n\nUnknowns of Gene Therapy and Successes of Medical Therapies for Hemophilia A\n\nAlthough gene therapy has held the promise of a cure, a consistent cure has yet to be realized. Additionally, the beneficial results seen in hemophilia A gene therapy clinical trials have occurred with meaningful challenges. This talk will review the risks and benefits of gene therapy for hemophilia A and consider them within the context of therapies (emicizumab and Fc-VWF-XTEN fusion protein-eht) that have shown consistent benefit compared with previously available factor VIII products as well as other promising therapies (Mim8, fitusiran, concizumab, and marstacimab) in late-stage clinical trials.\n\nChair:\n\nBarbara A.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching has proved to be the most likely crucial parameter in this process. However, several additional criteria can significantly influence allo-HCT outcomes.\n\nDr. Heather Stefanski will discuss the patient’s likelihood and probability of having a fully HLA-matched donor and finding a suitable donor prior to allo-HCT. She will summarize the historical barriers to transplant, especially for racially and ethnically diverse patients. A special focus will be put on new strategies, including post-transplant cyclophosphamide and abatacept, which can allow for safe and effective use of HLA-mismatched donor sources such as haploidentical donors and mismatched unrelated donors. Dr. Stefanski will highlight the research evidence that shows alternative donors are a viable and safe option for many allo-HCT recipients.\n\nDr. Mohamad Mohty will discuss the non-HLA factors which can contribute to further optimizing the selection of a donor prior to allo-HCT. These factors include the age of the donor (especially data favoring younger donors), recipient-donor gender mismatch and its impact on graft-versus-host disease, cytomegalovirus serostatus, and blood type compatibility. Dr Mohty will also briefly discuss the potential role of killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) matching, and donor-recipient kinship.\n\nBy integrating HLA and non-HLA variables into the donor selection process, one can significantly enhance the outcome of patients who are candidates for allo-HCT.\n\nChair:\n\nMohamad Mohty, MD,PhD\n\nSaint-Antoine Hospital\n\nParis, France\n\nSpeakers:\n\nHeather E. Stefanski, MD,PhD\n\nCIBMTR® (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), NMDP\n\nMinneapolis, MN\n\nHLA: Optimizing the ’Full HLA Match’\n\nMohamad Mohty, MD,PhD\n\nSaint-Antoine Hospital\n\nParis, France\n\nBeyond HLA: Optimizing Non-HLA Variables\n\nSmoldering Myeloma: A Case for Early Intervention?\n\nSmoldering Multiple Myeloma (SMM) is a precursor plasma cell disorder characterized by the presence of an M-component concentration equal to or greater than 3 g/dL and/or bone marrow plasma cell infiltration of 10-59%, without any myeloma-defining events. The outcome is heterogeneous, especially regarding progression to active disease such as Multiple Myeloma or other plasma-cell related disorders. The current standard of care is observation, but ongoing and completed research suggests it is possible and straightforward to identify SMM patients at high risk of progression to Multiple Myeloma (50% at 2 years).\n\nThis session will feature two clinical cases that highlight the issues involved in determining whether early treatment is the optimal approach for managing this precursor plasma cell disorder and if early treatment is the only way to potentially cure Multiple Myeloma.\n\nDr. Mateos will discuss the role of early treatment in Smoldering Myeloma as a strategy to cure the disease. She will present evidence supporting the benefits of early intervention and its impact on long-term outcomes.\n\nDr. Ramasamy will provide a counterpoint to this approach, addressing the costs and toxicities associated with early treatment. He will discuss the potential downsides and argue for a more conservative management approach based on observation.\n\nWe look forward to a dynamic and educational session that will provide valuable insights into the management of Smoldering Multiple Myeloma\n\nChair:\n\nMaria-Victoria Mateos, MD, PhD\n\nUniversity Hospital of Salamanca/IBSAL/Cancer Research Center-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC)\n\nSalamanca, Spain\n\nSpeakers:\n\nMaria-Victoria Mateos, MD, PhD\n\nUniversity Hospital of Salamanca\n\nSalamanca, Spain\n\nPoint: Yes, That is the Only Way We Can Cure Myeloma?\n\nKarthik Ramasamy, MD,PhD\n\nUniversity of Oxford\n\nOxford, United Kingdom\n\nCounterpoint: No, It Just Adds Cost and Toxicity?\n\nThe Clone Wars: Myeloid Neoplasia Risk in Clonal Hematopoiesis\n\nClonal expansions in the hematopoietic system, referred to as clonal hematopoiesis (CH), is common throughout life and associated with significant clinical outcomes, including increased risk of hematologic cancers, all-cause mortality and nonmalignant conditions. Recently, clinical definitions of disorders within the spectrum of CH have been introduced, including clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS), providing the framework for harmonized classification and registration. However, while clone features and dynamics have been well described, relevant key issues remain to be clarified.\n\nIn the first presentation, Dr. Malcovati will provide an overview of biological underpinnings and clinical implications of CH. In addition, the spectrum of clonal cytopenias, as well as current classification framework and its pitfalls, will be critically discussed. Finally, the contribution of intra- and extra-clonal factors to clonal evolution, and the models developed for predicting the risk of developing myeloid neoplasms and the trajectory of evolution will be reviewed, as a basis for informing early-detection and prevention strategies.\n\nIn the second presentation, Dr Grønbæk will discuss the clinical management of CH in everyday clinical practice, focusing on how individual/patients with CH are identified, including the incidental finding, which emphasizes the need for informed consent before sequencing. She will elaborate on the importance of identifying and following high-risk individuals/patients while sparing low risk individuals unnecessary worries. The importance of enrolling these individuals/patients in clinical trials will be discussed including the optimal trials designs. Examples of ongoing trials will be presented and critically appraised.\n\nChair:\n\nLuca Malcovati, MD\n\nUniversity of Pavia and S.

India has among the highest hemoglobin S allele frequencies in the world and the third-highest birth rate for babies born with HbSS.\n\nThe Indian sickle cell haplotype is closely associated with the Arab-Indian or Asian haplotype which are associated with high fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels and hence, believed to have mild clinical presentation as compared to other population\n\nIn this lecture Dr. Dipty Jain will discuss the status of frequency, comorbidities and management of sickle cell (SCD) in India characterized by relatively high % of fetal hemoglobin accompanied by mild to severe complications as observed globally. She will also discuss targeted new born screening and the use fixed low dose hydroxyurea in managing children with sickle cell disease in India. Dr. Jain will review the milestones and progress in understanding SCD phenotype accelerated by the Government of India’s ambitious ‘’National Sickle Cell Anemia Elimination Mission 2023’’ with comprehensive guidelines and implementation of screening, treatment, counselling, education, and novel therapies including gene therapy specific to the requirement of India’s population with SCD.\n\nChair:\n\nMohandas Narla, DSc\n\nNew York Blood Center\n\nNew York, NY\n\nSpeaker:\n\nDipty Lalit Jain\n\nIndira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital\n\nNAGPUR, India\n\nSickle Cell Disease in Developing Countries\n\n2024 Presidential Symposium\n\nRed cells constitute ~70% of all cells in the human body and in healthy individuals their circulatory life span is ~ 120 days. At steady state the bone marrow produces 2.5 million red cells per second to maintain normal hemoglobin levels. Anemia characterized by decreased hemoglobin levels is a major global health problem affecting nearly 2 billion individuals. Decreased red cell life span and/or decreased red cell production in the bone marrow account for anemia in various inherited and acquired hemolytic anemias. Significant progress has been and is continuing to be made in our understanding of the mechanistic basis for anemia. The three presentations in the symposium will highlight recent advances in our understanding of red cell biology and of anemia.\n\nDr. Patrick Gallagher will discuss recent advances which have expanded understanding of the many roles of the erythrocyte membrane. An update on the diagnosis and treatment of membrane disorders and potential emerging therapies will be discussed.\n\nDr. Naomi Taylor will highlight the pivotal role of metabolite transporters and fuel choice in erythroid lineage commitment and terminal erythroid differentiation. The importance of metabolic reprogramming in diseases of disordered and ineffective erythropoiesis will be discussed.\n\nDr. Olivier Hermine will explain the mechanisms that control red cell production during terminal erythroid differentiation, focusing on the processes that determine the fate of erythroid precursors between differentiation or cell death. The discussion will also touch upon how these mechanisms are impacted in hemoglobinopathies and myelodysplastic disorders, which can result in ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia. Additionally, therapeutic implications arising from these insights will be emphasized.\n\nChair:\n\nMohandas Narla, DSc\n\nNew York Blood Center\n\nNew York, NY\n\nSpeakers:\n\nPatrick G Gallagher, MD\n\nAbigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital\n\nColumbus, OH\n\nMature Red Cell Membrane Disorders (including genome-wide screening and PK activators)\n\nNaomi Taylor, MD\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nBethesda, MD\n\nMetabolism and Erythropoiesis (including metabolism, IDH mutations and relevance to MDS, sideroblastic anemia)\n\nOlivier Hermine, MD,PhD\n\nIMAGINE institute Paris France\n\nParis, France\n\nIneffective Erythropoiesis in Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease\n\nMeet the Scientist\n\nCAR-T and CAR-NK in Therapy of Hematologic Malignancies\n\nEpigenetic Regulation in Bone Marrow Failure\n\nMechanisms of Drug Resistance in Acute Myeloid Leukemia\n\nMicroenvironment Regulation of Hematopoietic Stem Cells\n\nPluripotent Stem Cell-Based Modeling of Hematologic Malignancies\n\nProduction of Functional Hematopoietic Stem Cells from Pluripotent Cells\n\nTherapy-Related Myeloid Neoplasms\n\nTransferrin Receptor Physiology and Iron Metabolism\n\nWhat Does the Future Hold for Management of Hemophilia?\n\nScientific Program\n\nCrosstalk Between Iron Homeostasis and Metabolism\n\nScientific Committee on Iron and Heme\n\nMaintaining iron balance is fundamental to preserve metabolic functions and energy requirements. This session reflects the current understanding of the reciprocal relationship existing between iron homeostasis and energetic metabolism. It aims to highlight the regulatory role of heme and iron on glucose and lipid metabolism as well as the impact of metabolism on the modulation of the iron status. Novel findings will be presented about the physiologic and pathologic implications of iron-mediated regulation of metabolism, and metabolite-driven control of iron and heme homeostasis. The session will focus on b-thalassemia, sickle cell disease and obesity, and will have broad relevance to all hematologic and non-hematological diseases.\n\nDr. Antonella Nai will discuss the role of Transferrin Receptor2 (TFR2) in the reciprocal regulation between iron homeostasis, erythropoiesis, and glucose metabolism. TFR2 is an iron sensor acting as a brake of erythropoietin signaling in erythroid cells. Its genetic inactivation in the hematopoietic compartment enhances erythropoiesis and improves anemia in ß-thalassemia. She will present unpublished data demonstrating that Tfr2 deficiency increases the metabolic activity of erythroid cells, thus promoting glucose consumption and reducing blood glycemia. This is particularly relevant in ß-thalassemia, whereby glucose intolerance and diabetes are common and invalidating complications.\n\nDr. Wei Ying will focus on the connection between iron homeostasis and lipid metabolism. He will present findings related to the role of iron homeostasis in regulating hepatocyte lipogenesis and neighboring cell responses, including hepatic stellate cells, and describe how alterations of these mechanisms drive non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, steatohepatitis and obesity.\n\nDr. Leitinger will share how heme triggers a unique bioenergetic switch in macrophages, characterized by a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation towards glucose consumption, and its critical role in the effective clearance and detoxification of heme in sickle cell disease. Based on the previous identification of the phosphofructokinase PFKFB3 as key mediator of the metabolic switching in heme-detoxifying macrophages, he will present data about a potential therapeutic strategy involving the inhibition of PFKFB3 in a mouse model of sickle cell disease. Furthermore, the general clinical relevance of these processes for patients with hemolytic disorders will be discussed.\n\nChair:\n\nFrancesca Vinchi, PhD\n\nNew York Blood Center\n\nNew York, NY\n\nSpeakers:\n\nAntonella Nai, PhD\n\nIRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute\n\nMilan, Italy\n\nIron, Erythropoiesis, and Glucose Metabolism\n\nWei Ying, PhD\n\nUniversity of California San Diego\n\nLa Jolla, CA\n\nIron and Lipid Metabolism\n\nNorbert Leitinger\n\nUniversity of Virginia\n\nCharlottesville, VA\n\nHeme and Macrophage Metabolism.\n\nHost Factors Driving Anti-Leukemia Immunotherapy Outcomes\n\nScientific Committee on Immunology and Host Defense\n\nThis session will cover how the immune microenvironment of the host interacts with leukemia cells and how the donor immune system can exert graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects. The speakers will focus on the characterization of immune effector cells and leukemia cells using high resolution RNA and protein analysis, the characterization of metabolites that impact the GVL effect and kinase inhibition strategies to overcome immune escape mechanisms of leukemia cells.\n\nDr. Catherine Wu will discuss the components critical to devising effective immunotherapy for the treatment of myeloid leukemia, namely the identification of myeloid malignancy antigen targets, and the detection of critical immune cell effectors. The analysis of GvL responses following allogeneic stem cell transplant for AML/MDS, through single cell transcriptome and spatial analysis of marrow specimens, is a particularly instructive setting from which to detect key antigens and cell subpopulations implicated in anti-leukemia responses. The insights gained from the study of such GVL settings promise to provide a roadmap for devising new immunotherapeutic approaches for myeloid malignancies.\n\nDr. Takanori Teshima will discuss mechanisms of leukemia relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and novel strategies to prevent relapse by inhibiting immune escape of leukemic cells, restoring immune cell dysfunction, and turning “COLD” into “HOT” immune microenvironment. In addition, novel strategies to separate GVL from GVHD by controlling migration and activation of donor T cells in the vicinity of leukemic cells.\n\nChair:\n\nRobert Zeiser, MD\n\nUniversitätsklinikum Freiburg\n\nFreiburg, Germany\n\nSpeakers:\n\nCatherine J.

Understanding the underlying mechanisms of ineffective erythropoiesis is pivotal for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in hereditary anemias and adult-onset conditions. This session will explore recent breakthroughs in research related to ineffective erythropoiesis, focusing on areas of hemoglobinopathies, malaria infection, and myeloid neoplasms. By bringing together experts at the forefront of these investigations, the session will not only enhance understanding of the pathogenesis of ineffective erythropoiesis but also catalyze the development of innovative approaches to treat related diseases.\n\nChair:\n\nPeng Ji, MD,PhD\n\nNorthwestern University Medical School\n\nChicago, IL\n\nSpeakers:\n\nWassim El Nemer, PhD\n\nFrench Blood Establishment (EFS)\n\nMarseille, France\n\nPost-Transcriptional and Signaling Mechanisms in Ineffective Erythropoiesis in Hemoglobinopathies\n\nElizabeth S.
