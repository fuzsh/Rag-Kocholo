        "text": "MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nData were collected from a consecutive series of patients who underwent OLT at the University Hospital of Liege (Belgium) from January 2006 until September 2012. This analysis was limited to this time frame to avoid selection bias due to new recommendations in the handling of transplanted patients. We analyzed OLT patients developing acute renal failure (ARF) in the early postoperative course up to and including postoperative day 7 (primary outcome).\n\nData collection was based on a prospective clinical research database taking into account hospitalization data (preoperative hospital stay and infection occurrence), baseline demographic characteristics [age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and co-morbid conditions], preoperative clinical and biological data (urea, creatinine and bilirubin levels), perioperative septic status, ascites, previous treatment with β-adrenoreceptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We did not exclude patients with HRS pre-OLT from the study but we excluded patients who required preoperative renal replacement therapy (RRT).\n\nA single surgical team, all members of which were specifically trained in OLT, performed all procedures. Intraoperative collected variables included liver graft source (cardiac dead or brain dead donor), need for surgical revision, need for transfusion [type of blood product administered: Red cells concentrate (RCC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or platelet] and need for vasoactive drugs. Furthermore, we secondarily analysed the impact of the hemostatic agent used (aprotinin until October 2007, tranexamic acid later on - the only significant modification to protocol during the study period).\n\nPost operative data during the first week were collected: Need for transfusion (amount and type of blood product on days 0, 1 and 7), postoperative day 1 lactate peak level, minimum hemoglobin level, need for vasopressors, time to extubation, bilirubin peak level, aminotransferases peak levels, urea and creatinine peak levels, need for postoperative RRT and immunosuppressive drugs (tacrolimus, cyclosporine A or other immunosuppressive drug). The local triple immunosuppressive regimen consisted of a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus), an antiproliferative drug and a corticosteroid. Whole blood levels of calcineurin inhibitor were measured by chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay (Architect® from Abbott).\n\nWe separated patients into four groups according to their renal function (relying on sequential organ failure assessment score stratification), based on the highest creatinine plasma level during the first postoperative week. The first group had a creatinine level below 12 mg/L, the second group between 12 and 20 mg/L, the third group between 20 and 35 mg/L, and the fourth above 35 mg/L. Patients who needed RRT during the first week after transplantation were also classified in the fourth group.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nStatistical analysis was performed by the University’s biomedical statisticians.\n\nUnivariate analysis was performed to identify variables associated with primary outcome as potential confounders. The results are presented as mean and standard deviation for normally distributed variables or median (interquartile range) for non-normally distributed variables. Several variables underwent a logarithmic transformation in order to standardize their distributions. Normality was checked by Shapiro-Wilk’s test.\n\nRRT: Comparisons between RRT and categorized variables were made by a χ2 test whereas comparisons with continuous variables were made using logistic regression.\n\nComparisons between the 4 groups of renal dysfunction with categorized variables were made by a χ2 test whereas comparisons with continuous variables were made using ANOVA or the Kruskal-Wallis’ non-parametric test according to normality of variables. Ordinal logistic regression was performed in order to take the groups’ order into account and hence renal dysfunction severity (group 4 “more severe” than group 3 “more severe” than group 2 “more severe” than group 1).\n\nThe results are considered as significant with an uncertainty level of 5% (P < 0.05). Statistical analyses were carried out using software SAS version 9.3.\n\nMultivariate model\n\nVariables included in the model are variables with a P-value lower than 0.10 in univariate analysis.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAKI remains a common disorder after OLT, despite advances in surgical technique, anesthesia, postoperative care and immunosuppressive therapy. We found 58% of OLT recipients to have some degree of renal dysfunction highlighted by an increase in serum creatinine level during the first postoperative week. The rate of AKI varies among studies. Cabezuelo et al[4] and Rymarz et al[19] observed an AKI prevalence of around 30% over the first week after surgery, while Junge et al[10] found only 12% patients developing AKI during the first week after OLT. The incidence of post-transplantation acute renal dysfunction is related to an increased mortality rate[20,21].\n\nRRT requirement\n\nWhen focusing on AKI severity, RRT requirement concerned 20 on 187 of our patients (11%), 13 (7%) of them within the first postoperative week. Likewise, in Faenza’s study[22], 8% of OLT patients experienced ARF requiring RRT during the postoperative period. They found that ARF requiring RRT conferred an excessive risk of in-hospital mortality (n = 8, 40%). This increased risk cannot be explained solely by a more pronounced severity of illness and provides evidence that ARF is a specific, independent risk factor for a poor prognosis[22]. According to the literature, 3% to 20% of RRT-naïve patients who undergo OLT ultimately require postoperative RRT[23] with an associate increase in mortality rate[13,24].\n\nOur results identified five parameters independently associated with a postoperative increased serum creatinine level.\n\nPreoperative renal impairment\n\nSome degree of preoperative renal impairment was a main factor highlighted by our study, as shown by others[4,10,12,19], especially since biological markers are delayed and reflect advanced renal damages[25]. Intrinsic chronic kidney disease predisposes patients with end-stage liver failure to acute renal dysfunction[26]. Furthermore, hemodynamic preoperative factors promote the risk of ARF in cirrhotic patients: Kidney hypoperfusion is due to intravascular hypovolemia associated with parietal edema, hypoalbuminemia and hormone-induced vasodilatation of splanchnic circulation[26,27]. Renin angiotensin aldosterone axis is also disturbed. Edema of renal parenchyma itself can also play a role in this phenomenon[28].\n\nA link between acute liver failure (ALF) and ARF is described in the literature. Seventy percent of patients with ALF developed AKI, and 30% received RRT. Patients with severe ARF had higher international normalized ratio values, more severe encephalopathy and shock than patients without renal dysfunction[29].\n\nVasopressor requirements\n\nLike other authors, we observed an adverse role of vasoconstrictor therapy during surgery[13]. Nevertheless, maybe vasopressor requirement rather than vasopressor use is responsible for renal impairment. With cirrhosis, systemic arterial vasodilation is observed. Indeed, portal hypertension is associated with a release of vasodilatory substances (NO, prostacyclins). Moreover, vasodilation opens arteriovenous shunts. As a result, a hyperkinetic syndrome with an increase in the cardiac flow and a fall of the systemic blood pressure is observed in cirrhotic patients. During surgery, significant hemodynamic disturbances occur following liver mobilizations (dislocation), in addition to hepatomegaly in some cases, inducing a venous return decrease. Massive blood losses can occur especially in presence of adherences. Inferior cava vein clamping reduces once more venous return (up to 60%) and decreases cardiac flow (about 40% to 60%). Clamp withdrawal increases transient severe hypotension.\n\nA surgical revision is needed when significant bleeding persists after correction of biological coagulation parameters, leading to anemia, hypotension, tissue hypoperfusion and cellular oxygen deprivation. These situations are associated with greater hemodynamic instability leading to renal hypoperfusion.\n\nSepsis-associated vasodilation further increases these circulatory derangements. Sepsis-related AKI doesn’t seem to be related to renal global hypoperfusion but rather to renal hyperhemia with an intra-renal blood flow redistribution. The exact pathophysiology of sepsis-induced AKI is still not clear and seems multifaceted, with components of inflammatory injury, ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury, endothelial cell dysfunction, coagulation disturbance and apoptosis[30]. Moreover, recent findings suggest that pathophysiologic mechanisms of sepsis-induced AKI are different from non-septic AKI[31].\n\nIt is reported that vasoplegia-induced hypotension is correlated with progressive AKI during severe sepsis, relying on the Finnaki study’s results[32]. On the other hand, generous fluid infusion and fluid overload in septic patients are also associated with progressive AKI[33,34].\n\nAnemia and transfusion requirements\n\nWe found a significant impact of both postoperative anemia and transfusions on the incidence of early AKI. ARF severity was correlated to all transfused blood products in univariate analysis.\n\nData issued from literature are somewhat inconsistent regarding the effect of anemia and transfusion on renal function.\n\nVillanueva et al[35] did not found any significant repercussion on the occurrence of acute kidney injury of different transfusion strategies with hemoglobin thresholds of 7 g/dL and 9 g/dL in 921 patients with upper gastro intestinal bleeding.\n\nOn the other hand, AKI is thought to happen when a combination of insults inducing renal hypoxia, inflammation and oxidative stress occurs in vulnerable patients[36,37]. Kidneys are known to be highly vulnerable to hypoxic injury in the setting of reduced oxygen delivery because of anemia[38,39]. Decreased renal oxygen delivery is due to hypotension, hemodilution and impaired renal blood flow.\n\nOn one hand, several studies have highlighted the harmful effect of the need for transfusion on renal function of liver recipient patients[11]. As a matter of fact, transfused erythrocytes may favour kidney injury because of the functional and structural alterations that they undergo during storage[40]. These include depletion of adenosine triphosphate and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, loss of ability to generate nitric oxide, increased adhesiveness to vascular endothelium, release of pro-coagulant phospholipids, accumulation of pro-inflammatory molecules as well as free hemoglobin and iron[40,41]. Furthermore, erythrocytes undergo progressive structural changes during storage that lead a considerable proportion (up to 30%) of them to be rapidly removed from the circulation by macrophages[42], which may then release some of scavenged hemoglobin-iron complexes into circulation[43,44]. As a result, stored erythrocytes may, at least for a few hours after they are transfused, paradoxically weaken tissue oxygen delivery, enhance the inflammatory cascade, and worsen tissue oxidative stress[39,40,45,46]. Furthermore, a significant need for intraoperative transfusion of all type of blood products in previously non anaemic patient can be a reflection of either a more severe preoperative liver dysfunction with severe coagulation impairment, or a prolonged intervention with surgical difficulties and hemodynamic alterations. In contrast with what precedes, some authors even recommend an increased intraoperative vasopressor use aiming at reducing transfusion requirement. It is reported that norepinephrine can improve outcome and reduce mechanical ventilation duration without effect on renal function when comparing a restrictive fluid strategy and a liberal fluid strategy called placebo during OLT surgery[47].\n\nObviously, a particular attention must be paid for hemostasis and coagulation optimization.\n\nFinally, there is a theoretical anti ischemic preconditioning effect of aprotinin, selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and oral anti-diabetics (sulfonylurea, glitazones) which inhibit potassium channels[48]. Aprotinin is not used anymore and has been replaced by tranexamic acid to limit blood losses. The unique major modification in intraoperative management of liver transplant recipients in our center is the discontinued use of aprotinin in October 2007 (it was pulled out from international market given the concern that aprotinin increased risk of complication and death in the intraoperative period). Paradoxically, when stratifying renal data in two groups according to the antihemorrhagic agent used, we observed that the occurrence of renal failure was higher with tranexamic acid than with aprotinin, even when adjusted for preoperative creatinine level. This effect was not in relation with an increased intraoperative bleeding.\n\nHyperbilirubinemia\n\nBecause of donors’ paucity, sub optimal transplants coming from living donors, split or domino procedures and cardiac death donors often result in early hyperbilirubinemia, which is deemed to be due to suboptimal graft[49]. Hyperbilirubinemia is due to miscellaneous etiologies such as small for size syndrome and aged living donor, acute cellular rejection, graft preservation injury, surgical complications, sepsis or drug toxicity[50] with a higher prevalence in the context of living donors in the literature. Serum bilirubin level is a useful predictor of short-term (< 1 year) graft poor outcome[51].\n\nEarly postoperative hyperbilirubinemia can be considered as a sign of liver impairment from different causes (i.e., surgical complications, infection or acute graft rejection) but it may in itself also potentiate other insults such as kidney failure[52]. When early hyperbilirubinemia is not an isolated phenomenon but presents with hepatocellular failure, i.e., persistent coma, coagulopathy and elevated serum transaminase level, it is encompassed in the diagnosis of “primary non function” (or less severe early allograft dysfunction). In this particular situation, the patient also needs to be on prolonged mechanical ventilation and requires iterative transfusions. A rapid new liver transplantation is mandatory under these circumstances. Primary non function is described as more frequent after “uncontrolled DCD donors” (i.e., with a prolonged warm ischemia) and believed to be the consequence of severe I-R injury in relation with warm injury[53]. Delayed bilirubin increasing is often due to biliary complications (bile leakage and bile duct stricture).\n\nI-R\n\nBesides aforementioned hemodynamic phenomena, liver I-R injury occurs after liver transplantation and circulatory shock, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. There is substantial evidence towards hepatic I-R injury resulting in an intense inflammatory response initiated by oxidative stress in the liver parenchyma during reperfusion. Hepatic I-R injury is associated with a systemic inflammatory response syndrome through a combination of immunologic, toxic and inflammatory factors (cytokines release), which can cause AKI through hemodynamic mechanisms and direct tubular cell death[30,54-57].\n\nNevertheless, unlike previous studies[17,58,59], we did not find any significant relationship between DCD and renal dysfunction. In 2012, Leithead et al[58] published the results of a single-center study conducted on 88 consecutive DCD liver transplant recipients. During the immediate postoperative period, DCD liver transplantation was associated with an increased incidence of AKI compared with donation after brain death (DBD). Interestingly, increased perioperative peak ASAT, a surrogate marker of hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury, was the only significant predictor of renal dysfunction after DCD transplantation. Organs recovered from a DCD have some degree of oxygen deprivation during the time after the heart stops beating, which is called warm ischemia. One of the explanations of the lower impact of DCD on renal function in our data, in comparison with Leithead’s studies, may be related to the differences in the legislation between the two countries. In the United Kingdom, discontinuation of therapy for DCD is carried out in the ICU, in the same condition than withdrawal of active treatment for a patient who is not a potential donor, e.g., in the presence of the family. Organ donation may not be possible if the dying process is prolonged and may result in an unacceptable warm ischemic time[60]. Moreover, warm ischemia increases graft susceptibility to damages induced by cold injury.\n\nThe Belgian legislation authorizes treatment withdrawal (in the context of the DCD) within the operating theatre, which reduces considerably warm ischemia duration. Two minutes are awaited after circulatory arrest before establishing death followed by a 5-min “no touch” phase before skin incision[61]. This enables the warm ischemia time to be as short as possible.\n\nAnother sensitive ethical issue in DCD concerns organ preservation measures to protect organ viability until transplantation[62]. A tool to reduce I-R impact lies in preconditioning operations. Preconditioning consists of an improvement of the tolerance to ischemia (for 1 to 2 h) by brief episodes of flow occlusion or pharmacological means[63-65].\n\nPreconditioning by halogenated anesthetics is related to several cellular mechanisms partially elucidated, such as the ATP dependant potassium channel opening (preserving mitochondrial function) and mitochondrial permeability transition pore closure [reducing the amount of radical oxygen species (ROS)][66-69]. These phenomena correspond to the early phase of the cellular protection; its duration is limited to 1-2 h. Preconditioning technique is possible only for a surgery where ischemia is programmed. Sevoflurane has also a protective effect on renal function (cystatine C) after coronary bypass surgery according to a double blinded multicenter study[67]. Pharmacological preconditioning by volatile anesthetics may protect non-cardiac organs against I-R[68,69].\n\nLeithead et al[17] also showed an association between cold ischemic time (CIT) and perioperative AKI.\n\nThese findings strongly suggest that a sustained CIT is a causative factor for poor outcome (of the transplanted organ but also global) after DCD liver transplantation[70]. Cold ischemia duration corresponds to the time elapsed between infusion of preservation fluid and the moment when the graft is perfused in the receiver. Shorter the time, better the results of transplantation. Beyond 13 h of cold ischemia on a whole liver, the risk of primary non-function becomes important. In addition to its non-specific effects, cold ischemia enhances graft immunogenicity and host allo-responsiveness. The ischemic injury, a localized process of cellular metabolic disturbances, results from glycogen consumption, lack of oxygen supply and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion[71]. Reperfusion abruptly reintroduces large amount of oxygen in the previously deprived cells. The mitochondrial respiratory chain, functionally damaged by ischemia, cannot accurately use this excess of oxygen. The reactivation of the ionic pumps rapidly corrects the acidosis, but at the cost of a sodium and calcium overload, potentially very harmful for the cell. Instead of synthesizing ATP, mitochondrion produces free ROS. It leads, by lipidic peroxidation, to cellular membranes damages (including mitochondrial membrane), but also to an indirect inflammation activation by leucocytes recruitment and by stimulating cytokines production, especially tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta[72-74]. Cytokines are mainly produced in the liver by the Kuppfer cells[75] but also by the extra-hepatic macrophages[76]. TNF-α propagates the inflammatory response[77]. Cytokines induce a local and general inflammatory syndrome followed by tissue edema. At reperfusion, body is flooded by degradation substances, such as lytic enzymes (ASAT, lactate dehydrogenase), lactates, potassium, H+ ions… which can induce severe metabolic acidosis, renal failure, ARDS, heart failure or even multiple organ failure[78]. A similar situation is observed with the harmful remote effects of mesenteric I-R, where released mediators are involved in multi organ failure occurrence[79]. I-R phenomenon may clarify the stronger association we found between ASAT and AKI than between alanine amino transferase (ALAT) and AKI, even if ALAT is more liver specific than ASAT.\n\nEurotransplant is responsible for allocation of donor organs in Belgium. A match list is generated by a computer algorithm that takes into account all medical and ethical criteria. Another potential explanation of the difference between Leithead’s report and our data perhaps relies on the policy of preferential allocation by Eurotransplant of an organ coming from a DCD to the donor’s transplantation center (to reduce cold ischemic duration in those organs which have already experienced warm ischemia).\n\nThe recipient selection is also important since organs coming from a DCD are selectively reserved to uncomplicated cases to ensure short cold ischemic time (by avoiding cases with extensive history of abdominal surgery or portal-vein thrombosis)[53].\n\nLikewise in our study, a recent meta-analysis focusing on post OLT complications also failed to detect a significant difference in complication rates (including renal failure) in the subgroup of cardiac death donors[80].\n\nImmunosuppressive drugs\n\nUnexpectedly, we did not found any significant impact of immunosuppressive drugs on early AKI. Nevertheless, nephrotoxicity associated with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), e.g., cyclosporine and tacrolimus, is common and occurs either acutely or after chronic use. Acute injury is believed to be dose and concentration-dependent. However, it may be observed in patients with therapeutic blood concentrations. CNI-induced AKI is believed mainly to come from afferent glomerular arteriolar vasoconstriction, reduced renal blood flow and ultrafiltration coefficient and, as a result, decreased glomerular filtration rate. This may be attributable to an increased production of vasoconstrictive factors (such as thromboxane A2 and endothelin) together with a decrease in renal vasodilatory prostaglandins and inhibition of nitric oxide[9,18,81-84]. CNI-associated AKI may develop early in therapy. It can occur within a few days after the initiation of either cyclosporine or tacrolimus. Early CNI-induced AKI generally improves once the cyclosporine or tacrolimus dose is reduced or discontinued. In contrast, late CNI-induced chronic renal failure is associated with interstitial nephritis and is usually irreversible[18-82].\n\nIn our institution, usual immunosuppressive therapy is based on low dose tacrolimus (serum target of 5-8 ng/mL), mycophenolic acid and steroids. It corresponds to the renal sparing immunosuppression regime in other studies[17,58,59,85], where renal sparing immunosuppression could significantly reduce early kidney dysfunction in comparison with their standard immunosuppressant treatment with CNI (serum tacrolimus target of 8-10 ng/mL), azathioprine and decreasing dose of steroids.\n\nLimitations\n\nSerum creatinine is the most established, simple, and inexpensive estimation of renal function. It is the primary method of detection of all forms of renal failure. Usually, monitoring renal function mostly relies on the results of the serum creatinine level and the estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated with the use of Levey’s modification of diet in renal disease and Cockcroft-Gault formulas with an additional monitoring of diuresis. Relying on the risk injury failure loss and end-stage renal disease (RIFLE) classification introduced in 2002, modified as AKI network (AKIN) classification since 2005, the AKI term currently integrates a wide range of renal dysfunctions, starting with a very early and slight renal dysfunction with minimal changes in the serum creatinine level (stage 1, risk), through moderate changes (stage 2, injury), to an advanced renal failure (stage 3, failure).\n\nOne limitation of the study is the lack of use of the RIFLE, AKIN or more recent Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria to define the degree of acute kidney injury. Moreover, as well in our study than in all the AKI definitions mentioned above, the use of serum creatinine (sCr) as renal dysfunction marker is also questionable in the context of liver failure.\n\nEven if sCr remains the most practical biomarker and the most commonly used for renal function evaluation, it presents many weaknesses in clinical practice since it is influenced by body weight, muscle mass, race, age, gender, protein intake and muscle metabolism. Body weight and muscle mass probably explain why BMI is an independent significant factor of postoperative increased creatinine level. In the particular case of a cirrhotic patient, it is also affected by a decreased formation of creatinine from muscles (due to muscle waste)[86], a decreased hepatic capacity to produce creatinine, an increased renal tubular secretion of creatinine[87], a low dietary protein intake to avoid hyperammonemia[7], an impairment of creatinine dosage with bilirubin high level[88] and an increased volume of distribution responsible for dilution of sCr. As a consequence, measurements of sCr in patients with cirrhosis overestimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or kidney function. Even more, creatinine is not an early reflection of GFR variations (substantial rises in serum creatinine are often not witnessed until 48-72 h after the initial kidney insult[89,90]) and rapid deterioration of renal function can be underestimated in the first days. In addition, significant renal disease can exist with minimal or no change in creatinine because of renal reserve or enhanced tubular secretion of creatinine[91,92]. On the other hand, slight modifications of serum creatinine level can be due to variation of body water content, corresponding to a false positive elevation. Although a decreased urinary output is the second criteria used in all those scores, it is admitted that use of urinary output in patients with cirrhosis and ascites is inadequate since these patients suffer from sodium retention and often present oliguria, even if they have a relatively preserved GFR[93]. Moreover urinary output is frequently artificially enhanced by use of diuretics.\n\nA “troponin-like” biomarker of AKI that is easily measured, unchanged by other biological variables, and capable of both early detection and risk stratification would considerably help for the diagnosis of AKI. It has been proposed that new biomarkers of renal function may be added to the diagnosis of AKI[94]. Nevertheless, recent studies focusing on critical patients have shown disappointing conclusions regarding the impact of routine use of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) analysis[95-97].\n\nAnyway, by using serum creatinine evolution for 7 d after transplantation, we estimated that a perioperative event would be emphasized by an increase in creatinine level, even with a 48 h delay in comparison with other biomarkers such as NGAL[98]. The aim of this study was not here to detect a renal damage as quickly as possible but to highlight all the perioperative factors which may affect kidney function.\n\nOn the other hand, we only excluded from our analyses patients with previous renal failure requiring RRT (but not patients with moderate renal dysfunction). Even if it is easily conceivable that a kidney with less reserve will be more prone to functional deterioration compared to a healthy kidney, our study design reflects more real life situation in ICU management of AKI post OLT, taking into account that patients without previous oliguria or elevated serum creatinine could indeed have lost a substantial number of nephrons.\n\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrated that AKI after liver transplantation is a common complication since more than half of liver transplanted patients experienced some degree of early renal dysfunction after transplantation. BMI, hyperbilirubinemia, preoperative renal dysfunction, peroperative circulatory instability requiring the use of vasopressor and postoperative anemia are independent predictors of AKI occurrence.\n\nDespite the reputable poor quality of the graft in DCD, neither comparison between DCD and DBD, nor ASAT level were associated with post-OLT AKI by multivariate analysis.\n\nBesides targeting improvement of graft quality, a particular attention must be paid to avoid preoperative additive kidney damages, to optimize intraoperative hemodynamics and to consider treatment in order to reduce transfusion requirements."
