        "text": "This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of niraparib as maintenance in platinum sensitive ovarian cancer patients who have either gBRCAmut or a tumor with high-grade serous histology and who have responded to their most recent chemotherapy containing a platinum agent. Niraparib is an orally active PARP inhibitor. Niraparib or placebo (in a 2:1 ratio) will be administered once daily continuously during a 28-day cycle. Health-related quality of life will be measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian Symptom Index (FOSI), European Quality of Life scale, 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D), and a neuropathy questionnaire. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and safety laboratory values. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate efficacy of niraparib as maintenance therapy in patients who have platinum sensitive ovarian cancer as assessed by the prolongation of progression free survival (PFS).\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial. For more information, please contact Ashley Powell, 650-724-3308.\n\nView full details\n\nThis study, will take a subject's \"T cells\" and \"teach\" them to be able to recognize and attack the ovarian cancer cells. This is done by putting in a gene or genetic material that will change how a subject's T cells work and hopefully get them to attack and kill ovarian cancer cells. These new T cells are called \"engineered T cells\" because the new gene is causing them to become directed toward the ovarian cancer cells rather than their usual targets. These are also called \"gene-modified T cells\". For subjects who have the HLA A2 tissue-type marker, the T cells would be engineered to recognize a substance called \"NY-ESO-1\". After putting this new gene in T cells (a procedure called \"gene therapy\") the investigators will grow the cells in the laboratory and give these cells back to subjects.\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.

No efficacy analyses were performed as the trial was terminated early with incomplete enrollment of \\< 10%. The purpose of this study is to determine if an investigational cell therapy called Cvac can help epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) from returning when administered to patients who are in complete remission after surgical removal of their tumor followed by standard first-line (Part A) or second-line (Part B) chemotherapy. Following remission, patients will undergo leukapheresis for the manufacture of the study agent. After completion of chemotherapy and confirmation of remission, patients will enter the treatment phase of the study.\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.

Macrophage-secreted chemokine-ligand-23 (CCL23) induces ovarian cancer cell migration via chemokine-receptor 1 (CCR1). However, the effect of CCL23 on other immune cells in the TME is unknown.METHODS: CCL23 levels were measured by ELISA. The expression of surface markers in exhaustion assays was quantified by flow cytometry. Signalling pathways were identified by phosphokinase array and validated by western blot.RESULTS: Ascites from patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) contain high levels of CCL23. Similarly, significantly higher CCL23 levels were found in plasma from HGSC patients compared to healthy individuals. RNA-seq analysis of ovarian cancer tissues from TCGA showed that expression of CCL23 correlated with the presence of macrophages. In tissues with high levels of CCL23 and macrophage content, the fraction of CD8+T cells expressing exhaustion markers CTLA-4 and PD-1 were significantly higher compared to low-level CCL23 tissues. In vitro, CCL23 induced upregulation of immune checkpoint proteins on CD8+T cells, including CTLA-4, TIGIT, TIM-3 and LAG-3 via phosphorylation of GSK3beta in CD8+T cells.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that CCL23 produced by macrophages contributes to the immune-suppressive TME in ovarian cancer by inducing an exhausted T-cell phenotype.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41416-022-01887-3\n\nView details for PubMedID 35750747\n\nAbstract\n\nAberrant β-catenin distribution has been theorized as a predictive biomarker for recurrence in early stage, low grade endometrioid endometrial cancer.This retrospective single-institution cohort study reviewed 410 patients with endometrial cancer from May 2018 to May 2022. Only endometrioid histology was included. Demographic and clinicopathological data were collected from the medical records. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions, and sensitivity analyses for early stage, low grade and no specific molecular profile (NSMP) tumors were performed.297 patients were included for analysis. Most patients were over 60 years old, White, and with a BMI >30 and early stage low grade disease. Aberrant β-catenin distribution was found in 135 patients (45.5%) and wild type membranous β-catenin distribution in 162 (54.5%). While TP53 mutation correlated with endometrial cancer recurrence in this cohort (OR = 4.78), aberrant β-catenin distribution did not correlate in the overall population (OR = 0.75), the early stage low grade cancers (OR = 0.84), or the NSMP group (OR = 1.41) on univariate or multivariate analysis. No correlation between β-catenin distribution and local (OR = 0.61) or distant recurrences (OR = 0.90) was detected.Aberrant β-catenin distribution did not significantly correlate with recurrence in endometrioid endometrial cancer, nor in the early stage, low grade and NSMP sub-cohorts.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ygyno.2023.10.025\n\nView details for PubMedID 37944330\n\nAbstract\n\nThe PORTEC-2 update suggested that substantial lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) and abnormal p53 expression (p53abnl) predict for poorer outcomes and that these patients should be treated with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). We aim to determine if patients with these risk factors who undergo a lymph node (LN) assessment show similar outcomes.We retrospectively reviewed 126 patients with FIGO 2009 stage IA grade 3, stage IB grade 1-2, and stage IIIC (positive LN but no other stage II/III risk factors) endometrioid endometrial cancer who underwent LN assessment. Local (LR), regional recurrences (RR), and distant metastases were analyzed using competing risk methods, and overall survival (OS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier.Median follow-up time was 37.2 months. OS was significantly different between patients with and without p53abnl expression (16.7% versus 3.1% deceased), and between patients with and without LVSI (11.1% versus 1.5% deceased; p < 0.01 for both). The 2-year cumulative incidence of LR for patients with p53abnl versus wild type p53 and LVSI versus no LVSI was 11.1% (95% CI 0-25.6) versus 2.2% (95% CI 0-5.25; p = 0.04), and 11.4% (95% CI 2.0-20.9) versus 0%, respectively (p < 0.01). The 2-year cumulative RR in patients with LVSI versus no LVSI was 6.9% (95% CI 0-14.4) versus 0% (p = 0.05). No patients who completed pelvic RT experienced an in-field recurrence.Despite LN assessment, patients with high-intermediate risk early-stage or stage IIIC (with positive lymph nodes only but no other stage II or III risk factors) endometrial cancer with p53abnl expression and/or LVSI have worse outcomes. These patients may derive benefit from intensification with EBRT to improve local and pelvic control.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ygyno.2023.09.001\n\nView details for PubMedID 37696217\n\nAbstract\n\nEmerging data suggests that abnormal (nuclear) β-catenin expression in some settings is associated with poorer outcomes. Our study aimed to verify the significance of abnormal β-catenin expression in early-stage endometrial cancer patients and determine if adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) improves local control.We identified 213 patients with FIGO 2018 stage I-II endometrioid endometrial cancer who underwent surgery from 2009 to 2021 with β-catenin expression assessed. Vaginal, regional, and distant recurrences were analyzed using competing risk methods, and overall survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier.Median follow up was 53.2 months; 6.9% experienced vaginal, 8.2% regional, and 7.4% distant recurrence. For the entire cohort, abnormal β-catenin expression was significantly associated with vaginal recurrence and remained significant on multivariate analysis (p = 0.03). There were 114 patients in the no specific molecular profile (NSMP) subgroup, and abnormal β-catenin expression was present in 46.5%. In the NSMP subgroup, abnormal β-catenin expression was associated with increased rates of vaginal recurrence (p = 0.06). Abnormal β-catenin expression in the NSMP subgroup was significant on multivariate analysis for vaginal recurrence (p = 0.04). RT significantly decreased vaginal recurrences in the entire cohort in patients with abnormal β-catenin expression (0%) versus wild type expression (17.5%; p = 0.03). In the NSMP subgroup 0% of patients who received RT versus 20.9% of patients who did not receive RT experienced a vaginal recurrence (p = 0.03).Use of adjuvant RT for stage I-II NSMP endometrial cancer with abnormal β-catenin expression improved local control. RT should be considered in these patients to decrease risk of vaginal recurrences.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ygyno.2023.04.018\n\nView details for PubMedID 37149904\n\nAbstract\n\nPatients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer (OvCa) respond poorly to existing therapies. Hence there is a need for more effective treatments.The DeCidE1 trial is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, single-arm phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of maveropepimut-S (MVP-S) with cyclophosphamide (CPA) in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Median follow-up for evaluable subjects was 4.4 months. Data were collected from March 2019 to June 2021. Subjects received two injections of 0.25 mL MVP-S 3 weeks apart, followed by one 0.1 mL doses, every 8 weeks up to progression. Oral CPA, 50 mg twice daily, was administered in repeating weekly on and off cycles.Twenty-two patients were enrolled. Median age was 58 years (38-78 years). Among the evaluable population, ORR was 21% (90% CI, 7.5%-41.9%), with a DCR of 63% (90% CI, 41.8%-81.3%), including 4 (21%) patients with partial responses, 8 (42%) stable disease, and 7 (37%) progressive disease. The ORRs were consistent across subgroups based on platinum-sensitivity, and DCR was higher in the platinum-resistant subpopulation. Four stable disease patients maintained clinical benefit up to 25 months. Most treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) were grade 1 and 2 (87% of unique events). Most common AEs were injection site reactions. Eight subjects reported grade 3 and no grade 4 AEs. Survivin-specific T cell responses were observed in treated patients with clinical benefit.MVP-S with intermittent low-dose CPA is well-tolerated, with clinical benefit for patients with recurrent OvCa. Observed responses are irrespective of the platinum status.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-2595\n\nView details for PubMedID 37126016\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: This study seeks to evaluate the impact of breast cancer (BRCA) gene status on tumor dissemination pattern, surgical outcome and survival in a multicenter cohort of paired primary ovarian cancer (pOC) and recurrent ovarian cancer (rOC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records and follow-up data from 190 patients were gathered retrospectively. All patients had surgery at pOC and at least one further rOC surgery at four European high-volume centers. Patients were divided into one cohort with confirmed mutation for BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 (BRCAmut) and a second cohort with BRCA wild type or unknown (BRCAwt). Patterns of tumor presentation, surgical outcome and survival data were analyzed between the two groups.RESULTS: Patients with BRCAmut disease were on average 4 years younger and had significantly more tumor involvement upon diagnosis. Patients with BRCAmut disease showed higher debulking rates at all stages. Multivariate analysis showed that only patient age had significant predictive value for complete tumor resection in pOC. At rOC, however, only BRCAmut status significantly correlated with optimal debulking. Patients with BRCAmut disease showed significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) by 24.3 months. Progression-free survival (PFS) was prolonged in the BRCAmut group at all stages as well, reaching statistical significance during recurrence.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BRCAmut disease showed a more aggressive course of disease with earlier onset and more extensive tumor dissemination at pOC. However, surgical outcome and OS were significantly better in patients with BRCAmut disease compared with patients with BRCAwt disease. We therefore propose to consider BRCAmut status in regard to patient selection for cytoreductive surgery, especially in rOC.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1245/s10434-022-12459-3\n\nView details for PubMedID 36085390\n\nAbstract\n\nTechnetium Tc 99m tilmanocept is a synthetic radiotracer specifically designed for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping that has been FDA-approved in breast cancer, melanoma, and head and neck cancer. No published studies exist for the use of this radiotracer in endometrial cancer.The primary objective was to determine the detection rate of bilateral SLNs in endometrial cancer with the concurrent use of technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept and ICG.An open-label, single cohort, prospective feasibility study was conducted with participants receiving preoperative cervical injections of technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept followed by subsequent imaging and SPECT/CT. Intraoperative ICG injections were administered for all patients with near-infrared imaging used to visualize lymphatic vessels and nodes. A laparoscopic gamma counter was used to detect radioactive SLN intraoperatively.All six evaluated patients had FIGO grade 1 or 2 endometrioid histology. Stage IA/IB were in 33% and 66% of patients, respectively. Tilmanocept did not map any SLN in the first six patients but instead showed retention of the tracer in the cervical stroma, leading to study discontinuation for futility. ICG mapped bilateral SLN in all patients with the most common location being the external iliac region, followed by the obturator and common iliac areas. All patients had CD206 positive staining throughout the full wall thickness of ectocervix, transformation zone, endocervix, and lymphatic vessels. No patients experienced adverse events.Technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept did not detect SLN in early stage endometrial cancers and is unlikely to improve bilateral detection rate compared to ICG alone. ICG remains a standard technique for SLN detection in low stage, low grade endometrial cancer.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.gore.2022.101054\n\nView details for PubMedID 35958955\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC9361318\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most common subtype of ovarian cancer and is associated with high mortality rates. Surgical outcome is one of the most important prognostic factors. There are no valid biomarkers to identify which patients may benefit from a primary debulking approach.OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to discover and validate a predictive panel for surgical outcome of residual tumor mass after first-line debulking surgery.STUDY DESIGN: Firstly, \"In silico\" analysis of publicly available datasets identified 200 genes as predictors for surgical outcome. The top selected genes were then validated using the novel Nanostring method, which was applied for the first time for this particular research objective. 225 primary ovarian cancer patients with well annotated clinical data and a complete debulking rate of 60% were compiled for a clinical cohort. The 14 best rated genes were then validated through the cohort, using immunohistochemistry testing. Lastly, we used our biomarker expression data to predict the presence of miliary carcinomatosis patterns.RESULTS: The Nanostring analysis identified 37 genes differentially expressed between optimal and suboptimal debulked patients (p < 0.05). The immunohistochemistry validated the top 14 genes, reaching an AUC O0.650. The analysis for the prediction of miliary carcinomatosis patterns reached an AUC of O0.797.CONCLUSION: The tissue-based biomarkers in our analysis could not reliably predict post-operative residual tumor. Patient and non-patient-associated co-factors, surgical skills, and center experience remain the main determining factors when considering the surgical outcome at primary debulking in high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ygyno.2022.06.010\n\nView details for PubMedID 35738917\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum is characterised by MAPK pathway aberrations and its reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy relative to high-grade serous carcinoma. We compared the MEK inhibitor trametinib to physician's choice standard of care in patients with recurrent low-grade serous carcinoma.METHODS: This international, randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 2/3 trial was done at 84 hospitals in the USA and UK. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with recurrent low-grade serous carcinoma and measurable disease, as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1, had received at least one platinum-based regimen, but not all five standard-of-care drugs, and had received an unlimited number of previous regimens. Patients with serous borderline tumours or tumours containing low-grade serous and high-grade serous carcinoma were excluded. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral trametinib 2 mg once daily (trametinib group) or one of five standard-of-care treatment options (standard-of-care group): intravenous paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 by body surface area on days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28-day cycle; intravenous pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 40-50 mg/m2 by body surface area once every 4 weeks; intravenous topotecan 4 mg/m2 by body surface area on days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28-day cycle; oral letrozole 2·5 mg once daily; or oral tamoxifen 20 mg twice daily. Randomisation was stratified by geographical region (USA or UK), number of previous regimens (1, 2, or ≥3), performance status (0 or 1), and planned standard-of-care regimen. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival while receiving randomised therapy, as assessed by imaging at baseline, once every 8 weeks for 15 months, and then once every 3 months thereafter, in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of study therapy. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02101788, and is active but not recruiting.FINDINGS: Between Feb 27, 2014, and April 10, 2018, 260 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the trametinib group (n=130) or the standard-of-care group (n=130). At the primary analysis, there were 217 progression-free survival events (101 [78%] in the trametinib group and 116 [89%] in the standard-of-care group). Median progression-free survival in the trametinib group was 13·0 months (95% CI 9·9-15·0) compared with 7·2 months (5·6-9·9) in the standard-of-care group (hazard ratio 0·48 [95% CI 0·36-0·64]; p<0·0001). The most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the trametinib group were skin rash (17 [13%] of 128), anaemia (16 [13%]), hypertension (15 [12%]), diarrhoea (13 [10%]), nausea (12 [9%]), and fatigue (ten [8%]). The most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the standard-of-care group were abdominal pain (22 [17%]), nausea (14 [11%]), anaemia (12 [10%]), and vomiting (ten [8%]). There were no treatment-related deaths.INTERPRETATION: Trametinib represents a new standard-of-care option for patients with recurrent low-grade serous carcinoma.FUNDING: NRG Oncology, Cancer Research UK, Target Ovarian Cancer, and Novartis.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02175-9\n\nView details for PubMedID 35123694\n\nAbstract\n\nExtramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is a frequently recurring malignant neoplasm with metastatic potential that presents in older adults on the genital, perianal, and axillary skin. Extramammary Paget disease can precede or occur along with internal malignant neoplasms.To develop recommendations for the care of adults with EMPD.A systematic review of the literature on EMPD from January 1990 to September 18, 2019, was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Libraries. Analysis included 483 studies. A multidisciplinary expert panel evaluation of the findings led to the development of clinical care recommendations for EMPD.The key findings were as follows: (1) Multiple skin biopsies, including those of any nodular areas, are critical for diagnosis. (2) Malignant neoplasm screening appropriate for age and anatomical site should be performed at baseline to distinguish between primary and secondary EMPD. (3) Routine use of sentinel lymph node biopsy or lymph node dissection is not recommended. (4) For intraepidermal EMPD, surgical and nonsurgical treatments may be used depending on patient and tumor characteristics, although cure rates may be superior with surgical approaches. For invasive EMPD, surgical resection with curative intent is preferred. (5) Patients with unresectable intraepidermal EMPD or patients who are medically unable to undergo surgery may receive nonsurgical treatments, including radiotherapy, imiquimod, photodynamic therapy, carbon dioxide laser therapy, or other modalities. (6) Distant metastatic disease may be treated with chemotherapy or individualized targeted approaches. (7) Close follow-up to monitor for recurrence is recommended for at least the first 5 years.Clinical practice guidelines for EMPD provide guidance regarding recommended diagnostic approaches, differentiation between invasive and noninvasive disease, and use of surgical vs nonsurgical treatments. Prospective registries may further improve our understanding of the natural history of the disease in primary vs secondary EMPD, clarify features of high-risk tumors, and identify superior management approaches.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamaoncol.2021.7148\n\nView details for PubMedID 35050310\n\nAbstract\n\nThe comprehensive genomic analysis of endometrial carcinoma (EC) by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) led to the discovery of four distinct and prognostically significant molecular subgroups. Molecular classification has the potential to improve risk-stratification when integrated with clinicopathologic features and has recently been included in national and international patient management EC guidelines. Thus, the adoption of molecular classification into routine pathologic and clinical practice is likely to grow significantly in the upcoming years. Establishing an efficient and standardized workflow for performing molecular classification on ECs, and reporting both the molecular and histologic findings in an integrative manner, is imperative. Here we describe our effort to implement rapid and routine molecular classification on all ECs diagnosed at our institution. To this effect, we performed immunohistochemistry as a surrogate marker for identifying genetic and/or epigenetic alterations in DNA mismatch repair (e.g., MLH1, PMS2, MSH6, MSH2), and TP53 genes. In addition, we have developed and employed a single-gene POLE SNaPshot assay, which is a rapid and analytically sensitive method for detecting select POLE exonuclease domain mutations (EDMs). We report our molecular testing workflow and integrative reporting system as well as the clinicopathologic and molecular features of 310 ECs that underwent routine molecular classification at our institution. The 310 ECs were molecularly classified as follows: 15 (5%) POLE mutant (POLEmut), 79 (25%) mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd), 135 (44%) no specific molecular profile (NSMP), and 81 (26%) p53 abnormal (p53abnl). This work provides an initial framework for implementing routine molecular classification of ECs.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41379-021-00963-y\n\nView details for PubMedID 34743187\n\nAbstract\n\nDespite the favorable prognosis of early stage endometrial cancer, mortality from cardiovascular disease is high. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a Fitbit program to improve physical activity in endometrial cancer survivors.Eligible patients were diagnosed with stage IA-IIIA endometrial adenocarcinoma, ≥3 months out from treatment. Participants received a Fitbit Alta and were randomized to receive communication via telephone or electronic methods (email/text). Communication was every two weeks for two months, then once during months four and five. Average daily steps were assessed weekly for nine months.The 46 analyzable patients demonstrated a baseline of 5641 median daily average steps. Average steps increased by 22% at 6 months but decreased to baseline by nine months. Baseline activity level (daily steps and walks per week) was the greatest predictor of activity level. Only the telephone intervention participants demonstrated increased activity level at several timepoints, although not maintained by nine months. BMI was unchanged. There was mild improvement in physical and social well-being in those with low baseline well-being (p = 0.009 and 0.014, respectively), regardless of intervention group. Emotional well-being correlated with step count (p = 0.005).Activity level was low and mildly improved on the Fitbit program with the telephone intervention, but effects did not persist by study completion. The program had the greatest impact on a select group of telephone intervention patients with high baseline walking frequency and low baseline step count. Others may require more intense intervention to promote more robust/persistent lifestyle changes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ygyno.2021.01.033\n\nView details for PubMedID 33551199\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: The second decade of 2000s is witnessing a new ovarian cancer (OC) paradigm shift thanks to the results recently obtained by a new class of targeted agents: the Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP)-Inhibitors (PARPi). Aim of this meta-analysis is to analyze available results obtained with PARPi, administered alone or in combination with chemo- and/or target-therapies in terms of efficacy and safety for the treatment of recurrent and primary advanced OC.METHODS: On December 2019, all published phase II/III randomized clinical studies were systematically searched using the terms \"[Parp-Inhibitor] AND [ovar*]\". Twelve phase II/III randomized controlled trials were identified, with a total number of 5171 patients included.RESULTS: Results demonstrated that PARPi account for a significant improvement of PFS in both recurrent and primary OC setting, independently from their administration schedule and independently from patients' BRCA mutational status. Moreover, patients harboring a Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) positive testing primary or recurrent OC progress significantly later after PARPi administration/association. Results also reported that PARPi increase the occurrence of severe (G3-G4) anemia. Furthermore, severe fatigue occurred more frequently among patients subjected to PARPi combined with chemotherapy and to PARPi plus Bevacizumab. Finally, a significant increase in severe high blood pressure occurrence was observed when PARPi was added to antiangiogenetics, compared to PARPi alone but a significant decrease in G3-G4 hypertension occurrence was found in PARPi plus bevacizumab users compared to Bevacizumab alone.CONCLUSIONS: PARPi are a valid option for the treatment of both primary and relapsed OC patients, with a relative low incidence of severe side effects.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ctrv.2020.102040\n\nView details for PubMedID 32485510\n\nAbstract\n\nVulvar cancers account for 5% of all gynecologic malignancies; only 1%-3% of those vulvar cancers are primary vulvar sarcomas. Given the rarity of vulvar sarcomas, outcome data specific to histopathologic subtypes are sparse. The aim of this study was to identify clinical and pathologic factors of primary vulvar sarcomas that are associated with survival and may inform treatment decisions.The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was searched for women diagnosed with vulvar sarcoma between 1973 and 2018. We identified 315 patients and reviewed their demographic, clinicopathologic, surgical, and survival information. Statistical analyses included χ2 and t-tests, Kaplan-Meier survival, and Cox regression analyses.The most common histopathologies of vulvar sarcomas were dermatofibrosarcomas (85/315, 27%) and leiomyosarcomas (72/315, 22.9%). Rhabdomyosarcomas (18/315, 5.7%), liposarcomas (16/315, 5.1%), and malignant fibrous histiocytomas (16/315, 5.1%) were less frequent. The majority of patients underwent surgery (292/315, 92.7%), which included lymph node dissections in 21.6% (63/292). Survival and lymph node involvement varied significantly with histologic subtype. The 5-year disease-specific survival for dermatofibrosarcomas, liposarcomas, and fibrosarcomas was 100% and only 60.3% and 62.5% for malignant fibrous histiocytomas and rhabdomyosarcomas, respectively. None of the patients with (dermato)fibrosarcomas, liposarcomas, or leiomyosarcomas had positive lymph nodes, in contrast to rhabdomyosarcomas and malignant fibrous histiocytomas with 77.8% and 40% positive lymph nodes, respectively. The 5-year disease-specific survival for women with positive lymph nodes was 0%.Vulvar sarcomas are heterogeneous with survival highly dependent on the histopathologic subtype. While surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment for all vulvar sarcomas, staging lymphadenectomy should be deferred for (dermato)fibrosarcomas, liposarcomas, and leiomyosarcomas as there were no cases of lymph nodes metastases.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1136/ijgc-2020-001516\n\nView details for PubMedID 32641392\n\nAbstract\n\nDensely O-glycosylated mucin domains are found in a broad range of cell surface and secreted proteins, where they play key physiological roles. In addition, alterations in mucin expression and glycosylation are common in a variety of human diseases, such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, and inflammatory bowel diseases. These correlations have been challenging to uncover and establish because tools that specifically probe mucin domains are lacking. Here, we present a panel of bacterial proteases that cleave mucin domains via distinct peptide- and glycan-based motifs, generating a diverse enzymatic toolkit for mucin-selective proteolysis. By mutating catalytic residues of two such enzymes, we engineered mucin-selective binding agents with retained glycoform preferences. StcEE447D is a pan-mucin stain derived from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli that is tolerant to a wide range of glycoforms. BT4244E575A derived from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is selective for truncated, asialylated core 1 structures commonly associated with malignant and premalignant tissues. We demonstrated that these catalytically inactive point mutants enable robust detection and visualization of mucin-domain glycoproteins by flow cytometry, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Application of our enzymatic toolkit to ascites fluid and tissue slices from patients with ovarian cancer facilitated characterization of patients based on differences in mucin cleavage and expression patterns.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1073/pnas.2012196117\n\nView details for PubMedID 32817557\n\nAbstract\n\nOvarian cancer and triple-negative breast cancer are among the most lethal diseases affecting women, with few targeted therapies and high rates of metastasis. Cancer cells are capable of evading clearance by macrophages through the overexpression of anti-phagocytic surface proteins called 'don't eat me' signals-including CD471, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)2 and the beta-2 microglobulin subunit of the major histocompatibility class I complex (B2M)3. Monoclonal antibodies that antagonize the interaction of 'don't eat me' signals with their macrophage-expressed receptors have demonstrated therapeutic potential in several cancers4,5. However, variability in the magnitude and durability of the response to these agents has suggested the presence of additional, as yet unknown 'don't eat me' signals. Here we show that CD24 can be the dominant innate immune checkpoint in ovarian cancer and breast cancer, and is a promising target for cancer immunotherapy. We demonstrate a role for tumour-expressed CD24 in promoting immune evasion through its interaction with the inhibitory receptor sialic-acid-binding Ig-like lectin 10 (Siglec-10), which is expressed by tumour-associated macrophages. We find that many tumours overexpress CD24 and that tumour-associated macrophages express high levels of Siglec-10. Genetic ablation of either CD24 or Siglec-10, as well as blockade of the CD24-Siglec-10 interaction using monoclonal antibodies, robustly augment the phagocytosis of all CD24-expressing human tumours that we tested. Genetic ablation and therapeutic blockade of CD24 resulted in a macrophage-dependent reduction of tumour growth in vivo and an increase in survival time. These data reveal CD24 as a highly expressed, anti-phagocytic signal in several cancers and demonstrate the therapeutic potential for CD24 blockade in cancer immunotherapy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41586-019-1456-0\n\nView details for PubMedID 31367043\n\nAbstract\n\nMucin domains are densely O-glycosylated modular protein domains that are found in a wide variety of cell surface and secreted proteins. Mucin-domain glycoproteins are known to be key players in a host of human diseases, especially cancer, wherein mucin expression and glycosylation patterns are altered. Mucin biology has been difficult to study at the molecular level, in part, because methods to manipulate and structurally characterize mucin domains are lacking. Here, we demonstrate that secreted protease of C1 esterase inhibitor (StcE), a bacterial protease from Escherichia coli, cleaves mucin domains by recognizing a discrete peptide- and glycan-based motif. We exploited StcE's unique properties to improve sequence coverage, glycosite mapping, and glycoform analysis of recombinant human mucins by mass spectrometry. We also found that StcE digests cancer-associated mucins from cultured cells and from ascites fluid derived from patients with ovarian cancer. Finally, using StcE, we discovered that sialic acid-binding Ig-type lectin-7 (Siglec-7), a glycoimmune checkpoint receptor, selectively binds sialomucins as biological ligands, whereas the related receptor Siglec-9 does not. Mucin-selective proteolysis, as exemplified by StcE, is therefore a powerful tool for the study of mucin domain structure and function.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30910957\n\nAbstract\n\nTo evaluate practice patterns among gynecologic oncologists with regards to sentinel lymph node injection and biopsy in endometrial cancer.Observational study with no control group.Active members of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology.After IRB approval, we performed an online survey amongst active members of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology. Members were contacted via email and their answers anonymously captured. Study data were collected using REDCap.318 of 1216 listed members completed the online survey, The majority of respondents (82.7%) perform sentinel lymph node sampling for endometrial cancer staging. Most technical aspects of sentinel lymph node sampling were consistently applied by the vast majority of respondents, including the choice of indocyanine green (ICG) as lymphatic tracer (97.3%) and its injection into the cervix (100%). Other technical aspects of sentinel lymph node sampling, such as the depth of injection, varied amongst respondents. While 50.9% of the respondents perform an intraoperative assessment of the uterus by frozen section, only 17.9% assess sentinel lymph nodes by frozen section and/or touch prep. Some of the respondents' approaches are based on limited data, including (i) the use of sentinel lymph node injection and biopsy for high-risk histologies (performed by 69 - 75% of the respondents dependent upon the histology), (ii) omitting side-specific completion lymphadenectomy in the absence of sentinel node mapping (in up to 57.8%) or (iii) when lymph node metastases are present (in 39.9%).In summary, despite the growing use of sentinel lymph node injection and biopsy in endometrial cancer, practice patterns vary considerably among providers sampled by this survey. Some of the decisions are based on limited evidence and, in some instances, deviate from current published guidelines.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30980995\n\nAbstract\n\nCell deformability is a label-free biomarker of cell state in physiological and disease contexts ranging from stem cell differentiation to cancer progression. Harnessing deformability as a phenotype for screening applications requires a method that can simultaneously measure the deformability of hundreds of cell samples and can interface with existing high throughput facilities. Here we present a scalable cell filtration device, which relies on the pressure-driven deformation of cells through a series of pillars that are separated by micron-scale gaps on the timescale of seconds: less deformable cells occlude the gaps more readily than more deformable cells, resulting in decreased filtrate volume which is measured using a plate reader. The key innovation in this method is that we design customized arrays of individual filtration devices in a standard 96-well format using soft lithography, which enables multiwell input samples and filtrate outputs to be processed with higher throughput using automated pipette arrays and plate readers. To validate high throughput filtration to detect changes in cell deformability, we show the differential filtration of human ovarian cancer cells that have acquired cisplatin-resistance, which is corroborated with cell stiffness measurements using quantitative deformability cytometry. We also demonstrate differences in the filtration of human cancer cell lines, including ovarian cancer cells that overexpress transcription factors (Snail, Slug), which are implicated in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; breast cancer cells (malignant versus benign); and prostate cancer cells (highly versus weekly metastatic). We additionally show how the filtration of ovarian cancer cells is affected by treatment with drugs known to perturb the cytoskeleton and the nucleus. Our results across multiple cancer cell types with both genetic and pharmacologic manipulations demonstrate the potential of this scalable filtration device to screen cells based on their deformability.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1039/c8lc00922h\n\nView details for PubMedID 30566156\n\nAbstract\n\nTumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are often associated with a poor prognosis in cancer. To gain a better understanding of cellular recruitment and dynamics of TAM biology during cancer progression, we established a novel transgenic mouse model for in vivo imaging of luciferase-expressing macrophages.B6.129P2-Lyz2(tm1(cre)Ifo)/J mice, which express Cre recombinase under the control of the lysozyme M promoter (LysM) were crossed to Cre-lox Luc reporter mice (RLG), to produce LysM-LG mice whose macrophages express luciferase. Cell-type-specific luciferase expression in these mice was verified by flow cytometry, and via in vivo bioluminescence imaging under conditions where macrophages were either stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or depleted with clodronate liposomes. The distribution of activated macrophages was longitudinally imaged in two immunocompetent LysM-LG mouse models with either B16 melanoma or ID8 ovarian cancer cells.In vivo imaging of LysM-LG mice showed luciferase activity was generated by macrophages. Clodronate liposome-mediated depletion of macrophages lowered overall bioluminescence while lipopolysaccharide injection increased macrophage bioluminescence in both the B16 and ID8 models. Tracking macrophages weekly in tumor-bearing animals after intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intraovarian (i.o.) injection resulted in distinct, dynamic patterns of macrophage activity. Animals with metastatic ovarian cancer after i.p. injection exhibited significantly higher peritoneal macrophage activity compared to animals after i.o. injection.The LysM-LG model allows tracking of macrophage recruitment and activation during disease initiation and progression in a noninvasive manner. This model provides a tool to visualize and monitor the benefit of pharmacological interventions targeting macrophages in preclinical models.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s11307-017-1061-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 28233218\n\nAbstract\n\nDevelopment and implementation of robust reporting processes to systematically provide quality data to care teams in a timely manner is challenging. National cancer quality measures are useful, but the manual data collection required is resource intensive, and reporting is delayed. We designed a largely automated measurement system with our multidisciplinary cancer care programs (CCPs) to identify, measure, and improve quality metrics that were meaningful to the care teams and their patients.Each CCP physician leader collaborated with the cancer quality team to identify metrics, abiding by established guiding principles. Financial incentive was provided to the CCPs if performance at the end of the study period met predetermined targets. Reports were developed and provided to the CCP physician leaders on a monthly or quarterly basis, for dissemination to their CCP teams.A total of 15 distinct quality measures were collected in depth for the first time at this cancer center. Metrics spanned the patient care continuum, from diagnosis through end of life or survivorship care. All metrics improved over the study period, met their targets, and earned a financial incentive for their CCP.Our quality program had three essential elements that led to its success: (1) engaging physicians in choosing the quality measures and prespecifying goals, (2) using automated extraction methods for rapid and timely feedback on improvement and progress toward achieving goals, and (3) offering a financial team-based incentive if prespecified goals were met.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1200/JOP.2017.021139\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5880618\n\nAbstract\n\nWe report the effect of antiangiogenic therapy on the biodistribution of (18)F-FPPRGD2 (a surrogate biomarker of integrin αvβ3 expression), and the potential of (18)F-FPPRGD2 to predict the prognosis in patients with cervical cancer and ovarian cancer in this clinical scenario.Data from six women, age range 30 - 59 years (mean ± SD 44.0 ± 12.5 years), who had undergone a (18)F-FPPRGD2 PET/CT scan and bevacizumab-containing therapy were prospectively collected and analyzed. We compared baseline (18)F-FPPRGD2 and (18)F-FDG uptake in the lesions and tumor-to-background (T/B) ratios. The maximum and mean (18)F-FPPRGD2 standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean) were recorded for 13 normal organs, as well as in all the identified malignant lesions on the pretreatment scan and the 1-week post-treatment scan. We also measured changes in (18)F-FPPRGD2 uptake from before to 1 week after treatment, and compared them to the changes in (18)F-FDG uptake from before to 6 weeks after treatment. Treatment outcomes were correlated with these changes.The uptake in lesions and T/B ratio of (18)F-FPPRGD2 were lower than those of (18)F-FDG (SUVmax 3.7 ± 1.3 vs. 6.0 ± 1.8, P < 0.001; SUVmean 2.6 ± 0.7 vs. 4.2 ± 1.3, P < 0.001; T/B ratio based on SUVmax 2.4 ± 1.0 vs. 2.6 ± 1.0, P < 0.04; T/B ratio based on SUVmean 1.9 ± 0.6 vs. 2.4 ± 1.0, P < 0.003). One patient did not return for the follow-up scan and in another patient no lesions were identified on the pretreatment scan. (18)F-FPPRGD2 uptake in lesions in the remaining four patients had significantly changed 1 week after treatment (SUVmean 3.3 ± 1.0 vs. 2.7 ± 1.0, P < 0.001), while uptake in all normal tissues analyzed was not affected by treatment. One patient with clinical disease progression had a decrease in lesional (18)F-FPPRGD2 SUVmean of 1.6 % and in (18)F-FDG SUVmean of 9.4 %. Two patients with a clinical complete response to treatment had decreases in lesional (18)F-FPPRGD2 SUVmean of 25.2 % and 25.0 % and in (18)F-FDG SUVmean of 6.1 % and 71.8 %. One patient with a clinical partial response had a decrease in lesional (18)F-FPPRGD2 SUVmean of 7.9 % and in (18)F-FDG SUVmean of 76.4 %.This pilot study showed that (18)F-FPPRGD2 and (18)F-FDG provide independent information about the biology of ovarian and cervical cancers. Bevacizumab-containing therapy does not affect (18)F-FPPRGD2 uptake in normal organs, but does result in statistically significant changes in lesions. In addition, (18)F-FPPRGD2 may have potential for early prediction of response to such treatments. These preliminary findings have to be confirmed in larger studies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s00259-015-3263-7\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000374972900008\n\nView details for PubMedID 26611425\n\nAbstract\n\nMalignant ascites is a common complication in the late stages of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) that greatly diminishes the quality of life of patients. Malignant ascites is a known consequence of vascular dysfunction, but current approved treatments are not effective in preventing fluid accumulation. In this study, we investigated an alternative strategy of targeting macrophage functions to reverse the vascular pathology of malignant ascites using fluid from human patients and an immunocompetent murine model (ID8) of EOC that mirrors human disease by developing progressive vascular disorganization and leakiness culminating in massive ascites. We demonstrate that the macrophage content in ascites fluid from human patients and the ID8 model directly correlates with vascular permeability. To further substantiate macrophages' role in the pathogenesis of malignant ascites, we blocked macrophage function in ID8 mice using a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor kinase inhibitor (GW2580). Administration of GW2580 in the late stages of disease resulted in reduced infiltration of protumorigenic (M2) macrophages and dramatically decreased ascites volume. Moreover, the disorganized peritoneal vasculature became normalized and sera from GW2580-treated ascites protected against endothelial permeability. Therefore, our findings suggest that macrophage-targeted treatment may be a promising strategy toward a safe and effective means to control malignant ascites of EOC.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-3373\n\nView details for PubMedID 26471360\n\nAbstract\n\nExtramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is often associated with underlying or distant synchronous malignancies. The prognosis for affected patients is generally favourable; however, the risk of secondary malignancies is unknown.The goal of the study was to analyse the incidence, prognosis and pattern of secondary malignancies for patients with invasive EMPD using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program.We searched the SEER Program database for patients diagnosed with invasive EMPD between 1973 and 2008. Demographic data, outcome and secondary malignancies more than 1 year after the initial diagnosis of invasive EMPD were included in the analysis. We calculated the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and estimated the excess absolute risk (EAR) per 10 000 person-years (PY).There were 1439 patients who were diagnosed with invasive EMPD. Most patients (80·4%) had localized disease, while 17·1% had locoregional spread and 2·5% presented with distant disease. The SIR for secondary malignancies in patients with invasive EMPD was significantly elevated with an EAR of 97·4 additional malignancies per 10 000 PY. The excess risk was mostly due to a significantly increased incidence of colorectal and anal malignancies. The initial site of disease predicted the site of the secondary malignancies, with patients with colorectal, anal, vulvar and scrotal disease showing an increased risk of colorectal, anal, vulvar and scrotal malignancies, respectively.Our study identified a long-term increased risk of developing secondary malignancies in patients with invasive EMPD that are mainly related to the site of origin of this disease. Patients with invasive EMPD require prolonged follow-up and screening for these malignancies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/bjd.12635\n\nView details for PubMedID 24617434\n\nAbstract\n\nChanges in cell stiffness (Young's modulus, E), as measured via Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), is a newly recognized characteristic of cancer cells and may play a role in platinum drug resistance of ovarian cancers. We previously showed that, compared to their syngeneic cisplatin-sensitive counterpart, cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells are stiffer, and this cell stiffness was dependent on actin polymerization and presence of stress fibers. Here, we measured the correlation between Young's modulus (via AFM measurements on live, non-apoptotic cells in physiological buffer) and cisplatin-sensitivity (IC50 as determined via the XTT cell viability assay) in a panel of nine ovarian cancer cell lines representing a range of cisplatin sensitivities. We found that cisplatin-sensitive cells had a lower Young's modulus, compared to cisplatin-resistant cells and resistant cells had a cytoskeleton composed of long actin stress fibers. As Rho GTPase mediates stress fiber formation, we examined the role of Rho GTPase in cell stiffness and platinum resistance. Rho inhibition decreased cell stiffness in cisplatin-resistant CP70 cells and increased their cisplatin sensitivity while Rho activation increased cell stiffness in cisplatin-sensitive A2780 cells and decreased their cisplatin sensitivity. Based on changes in cell stiffness, IC50 and cellular actin stress fiber organization in CP70 and A2780 cells, our findings reveal a direct role of Rho mediated actin remodeling mechanism in cisplatin resistance of ovarian cancer cells. These findings suggest the potential applicability of cell mechanical phenotyping as a model for determining sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells that could have major implications in ovarian cancer diagnosis and personalized medicine.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1039/c3ib40246k\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000336835100004\n\nAbstract\n\nThyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is a DNA-binding protein that is mainly expressed in thyroid and lung tissue, but has also been found in gynecologic tissue. Recent studies have suggested that TTF-1 has tumor suppressor function in lung adenocarcinoma models. In the current study, we examined whether expression of TTF-1 in benign endometrium and endometrial hyperplasia might impact on the risk of developing endometrial cancer. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded endometrial tissues obtained from 535 cases were used to construct an endometrial tissue microarray. One hundred fifty of 207 patients had multiple serial endometrial specimens including 46 patients who progressed to endometrial cancer. The tissue microarray included a range of histopathologies including benign endometrium (n=231), simple hyperplasia (n=105), complex hyperplasia (n=36), simple atypical hyperplasia (n=10), complex atypical hyperplasia (n=44), and endometrial carcinoma (n=109). Expression of TTF-1 by immunohistochemistry in benign endometrium and endometrial hyperplasia was correlated with progression to cancer and clinical features known to be associated with increased risk of developing endometrial cancer. Carcinoma specimens showed a significantly greater expression of TTF-1 compared with benign endometrium and non-atypical hyperplasia (P=0.0007 and P=0.05). Presence of TTF-1 expression in benign endometrium was associated with a significantly decreased risk of cancer development (P=0.003, hazards ratio=0.104, 95% CI: 0.024-0.455). TTF-1 expression in hyperplasia did not significantly correlate with progression to cancer. The data from our study show that TTF-1 expression in normal endometrium is associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer development. This observation suggests that TTF-1 might function as a tumor suppressor in endometrial tissue. TTF-1 expression in normal endometrium could potentially provide clinically useful information as a biomarker for the risk of endometrial cancer.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/modpathol.2012.64\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000307222200009\n\nView details for PubMedID 22460811\n\nAbstract\n\nThe outcome of patients with invasive Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) is poorly studied. The goal of the current study was to analyze the incidence, treatment approaches and outcome of patients with invasive EMPD.We searched the SEER program database for patients diagnosed with invasive EMPD between 1973 and 2007. Demographic data, outcome and therapeutic modalities were included in the analysis. Disease specific survival (DSS) was calculated from the time of original diagnosis.1439 patients were diagnosed with invasive EMPD. Most patients (80.4%) had localized disease, while 17.1% had locoregional spread, and 2.5% had distant disease. 1230 (86.4%) patients underwent site directed surgery, and 92 (6.4%) patients radiotherapy. 139 (9.7%) patients did not undergo any surgery or radiation therapy. The 5-year DSS was 94.9% for localized disease, 84.9% for regional disease and 52.5% for distant disease. Multivariate analysis showed a significantly shorter DSS associated with older age and advanced stage treatment modality (HR for death 1.07 and 2.5). Site directed surgery was associated with a significantly improved outcome when compared to patients who underwent no intervention (HR 0.44). Patients who received radiation, alone or in combination with site directed surgery, did not fare any better than patients who underwent surgery alone.The DSS of patients with invasive EMPD is generally favorable. A poor outcome was associated with older age, advanced stage and treatment modality. The association between a shortened DSS and the use of radiotherapy, alone or in combination with surgery, is surprising and warrants further investigation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ygyno.2012.01.032\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000303227500014\n\nView details for PubMedID 22293043\n\nAbstract\n\nTo identify clinical and pathologic predictors of response to progestin treatment in premenopausal women with complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH) and Grade 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma (Grade 1 EA).Forty premenopausal patients with Grade 1 EA or CAH who underwent progestin therapy for a minimum of 8 weeks were retrospectively identified. Patient characteristics and histopathologic features of pretreatment and first follow-up endometrial specimens were evaluated as predictors of resolution, defined as absence of hyperplasia or carcinoma.Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated 63% resolution at 18 months of follow-up. Multivariate classification analysis showed that resolution rates were higher in individuals with a low pre-treatment qualitative abnormal architecture score and a BMI <35 (Standardized Resolution Ratio (SRR)=1.48, p=0.03). The diagnosis of benign endometrium or simple hyperplasia on the first follow-up specimen was highly predictive of resolution (SRR=2.25, p=0.002). Resolution rates were lower among subjects with a high pre-treatment qualitative abnormal architecture score (SRR=0.37, p<0.03) and lowest in subjects whose first follow-up specimen showed persistent complexity, atypia, or carcinoma with adjacent stromal decidualization (SRR=0.24, p=0.002).Clinical and pathologic parameters can predict response to progestin therapy in premenopausal women with CAH and Grade 1 EA. A low likelihood of resolution is predicted by an unfavorable pre-treatment architectural score and lack of pathological response in the first specimen, despite adjacent stromal decidualization.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ygyno.2011.11.004\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000300751900029\n\nView details for PubMedID 22079678\n\nAbstract\n\nScreening trials for the early detection of ovarian cancer in the general population and in patients at a high risk for this disease have so far failed to show a reduction of ovarian cancer-specific mortality. Current screening modalities include pelvic examinations, transvaginal ultrasounds, and cancer antigen 125 (CA125) serum marker levels, which are associated with a high false-positive rate. The last decade has witnessed significant modifications in the interpretation of serum CA125 that extend beyond a static CA125 cutoff point. The Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) incorporates changes of CA125 levels over time and an individual's age-specific risk. Ongoing screening trials have incorporated ROCA, but it is still unclear whether the algorithm will increase the sensitivity and specificity of early ovarian cancer diagnosis. A very recent study analyzed baseline CA125 serum marker levels from high-risk patients included in ovarian cancer screening trials conducted by the Cancer Genetics Network and the Gynecologic Oncology Group. The findings show that the distribution of CA125 serum marker levels in this population is significantly affected by various demographic and clinical factors, in particular menopausal status and oral contraceptive use in premenopausal patients. The data suggest that CA125 cutoff points might have to be stratified for subgroups of patients to reduce false-positive results. These intriguing observations will need to be validated in future screening trials for ovarian cancer.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-11-0378\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000294490100005\n\nView details for PubMedID 21893498\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study evaluates the effect of dual PI3K and mTOR inhibition using NVP-BEZ235 in preclinical models of ovarian cancer as a potential novel therapeutic strategy.Inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling by NVP-BEZ235 was demonstrated by immunoblotting. The effect on cell proliferation was assessed in 18 ovarian cancer cell lines, including four pairs of syngeneic cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant cell lines. The in vivo effects of NVP-BEZ235 on established tumor growth were evaluated using an immunocompetent, transgenic murine ovarian cancer model (LSL-K-ras(G12D/+)Pten(loxP/loxP)).NVP-BEZ235 decreased cell proliferation in all ovarian cancer cell lines assayed and sensitized cisplatin-resistant cells to the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin. Cell lines with PI3K-activating mutations or Pten deletions were significantly more sensitive to the effect of NVP-BEZ235 than cell lines without these mutations (P < 0.05). A statistically significant correlation was found between relative levels of p4E-BP1 and the IC(50) for NVP-BEZ235. In LSL-K-ras(G12D/+)Pten(loxP/loxP) mice with established intraperitoneal tumor disease, oral administration of NVP-BEZ235 decreased pAkt, p4E-BP1 and Ki67 in tumor tissue, and resulted in significantly longer survival compared to control animals (P < 0.05). NVP-BEZ235 also induced cell cycle arrest, caspase 3 activity, and reduced cell migration.Targeting PI3K and mTOR simultaneously using NVP-BEZ235 effectively inhibits ovarian cancer cell growth even in the presence of platinum resistance and prolongs survival of mice with intra-abdominal ovarian tumor disease. We propose that dual PI3K and mTOR inhibition using NVP-BEZ235 may be an effective novel therapeutic approach in patients with ovarian cancer.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2289\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000289555500030\n\nView details for PubMedID 21372221\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC3078990\n\nAbstract\n\nTargeting of the PI3K (phosphoinositide3-kinase)/Akt/mTOR pathway in human ovarian cancer cells is a promising novel therapeutic strategy. We investigated the effects of cisplatin and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 on invasion, migration and the expression of essential matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in ovarian cancer cells. SKOV3, OVCAR5 and IGROV1 human ovarian cancer cell lines were treated with cisplatin, LY294002 and a combination of both drugs. Invasion and migration of treated cells was assessed using Matrigel and uncoated PET membrane assays. Expression levels of pro-MMP2, MMP2, TIMP1, TIMP2 and MT1-MMP were determined using Western Blotting. Gel zymography was used to quantitate the functional levels of active MMP2. All three cell lines showed significantly reduced invasion and migration after treatment with cisplatin, LY294002, and the combination of both drugs compared to untreated controls. In SKOV3 cells, cisplatin alone and in combination with LY294002 resulted in a 6.3 and 7.1-fold reduction in the total amount of activated MMP2. TIMP1 expression decreased by 5.0, 6.6 and 28.4-fold with cisplatin, LY294002 and the combination respectively (P < 0.05). In contrast, only cisplatin and the combination of both drugs resulted in a significant, 3.7 and 5.1-fold reduction in the level of TIMP2. Expression levels of MT1-MMP remained unchanged. These observations were corroborated in IGROV1 cell lines that showed similar changes of activated MMP2 and TIMP2 expression, but no significant decrease in TIMP1 levels. Our data suggests that inhibition of ovarian cancer cell motility is mediated via down-regulation of activated MMP2, TIMP1 and TIMP2 expression under these treatment conditions.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/cm.20465\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000280543100006\n\nView details for PubMedID 20607860\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC3001291\n\nAbstract\n\nTo make a safe, long-lasting gene delivery vehicle, we developed a hybrid vector that leverages the relative strengths of adenovirus and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). A fully gene-deleted helper-dependent adenovirus (HDAd) is used as the delivery vehicle for its scalability and high transduction efficiency. Upon delivery, a portion of the HDAd vector is recombined to form a circular plasmid. This episome includes two elements from EBV: an EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) expression cassette and an EBNA1 binding region. Along with a human replication origin, these elements provide considerable genetic stability to the episome in replicating cells while avoiding insertional mutagenesis. Here, we demonstrate that this hybrid approach is highly efficient at delivering EBV episomes to target cells in vivo. We achieved nearly 100% transduction of hepatocytes after a single intravenous injection in mice. This is a substantial improvement over the transduction efficiency of previously available physical and viral methods. Bioluminescent imaging of vector-transduced mice demonstrated that luciferase transgene expression from the hybrid was robust and compared well to a traditional HDAd vector. Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed that the EBV episome was stable at approximately 30 copies per cell for up to 50 weeks and that it remained circular and extrachromosomal. Approaches for adapting the HDAd-EBV hybrid to a variety of disease targets and the potential benefits of this approach are discussed.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1128/JVI.01721-08\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000264046000041\n\nView details for PubMedID 19158239\n\nAbstract\n\nWe describe an inducible genetic model for degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in adults. In previous studies, knock-in mice expressing hypersensitive M2 domain Leu9'Ser (L9'S) alpha4 nicotinic receptors (nAChR) at near-normal levels displayed dominant neonatal lethality and dopaminergic deficits in embryonic midbrain, because the hypersensitive nAChR is excitotoxic. However, heterozygous L9'S mice that retain the neomycin resistance cassette (neo) in a neighboring intron express low levels of the mutant allele (approximately 25% of normal levels), and these neo-intact mice are therefore viable and fertile. The neo cassette is flanked by loxP sites. In adult animals, we locally injected helper-dependent adenovirus (HDA) expressing cre recombinase. Local excision of the neo cassette, via cre-mediated recombination, was verified by genomic analysis. In L9'S HDA-cre injected animals, locomotion was reduced both under baseline conditions and after amphetamine application. There was no effect in L9'S HDA-control treated animals or in wild-type (WT) littermates injected with either virus. Immunocytochemical analyses revealed marked losses (> 70%) of dopaminergic neurons in L9'S HDA-cre injected mice compared to controls. At 20-33 days postinjection in control animals, the coexpressed marker gene, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), was expressed in many neurons and few glial cells near the injection, emphasizing the neurotropic utility of the HDA. Thus, HDA-mediated gene transfer into adult midbrain induced sufficient functional expression of cre in dopaminergic neurons to allow for postnatal deletion of neo. This produced increased L9'S mutant nAChR expression, which in turn led to nicotinic cholinergic excitotoxicity in dopaminergic neurons.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1096/fj.05-5497com\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000240157700016\n\nView details for PubMedID 16675851\n\nAbstract\n\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) episomes are stably maintained in permissive proliferating cell lines due to EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) protein-mediated replication and segregation. Previous studies showed the ability of EBV episomes to confer long-term transgene expression and correct genetic defects in deficient cells. To achieve quantitative delivery of EBV episomes in vitro and in vivo, we developed a binary helper-dependent adenovirus (HDA)-EBV hybrid system that consists of one HDA vector for the expression of Cre recombinase and a second HDA vector that contains all of the sequences for the EBV episome flanked by loxP sites. Upon coinfection of cells, Cre expressed from the first vector recombined loxP sites on the second vector. The resulting circular EBV episomes expressed a transgene and contained the EBV-derived family of repeats, an EBNA-1 expression cassette, and 19 kb of human DNA that functions as a replication origin in mammalian cells. This HDA-EBV hybrid system transformed 40% of cultured cells. Transgene expression in proliferating cells was observed for over 20 weeks under conditions that selected for the expression of the transgene. In the absence of selection, EBV episomes were lost at a rate of 8 to 10% per cell division. Successful delivery of EBV episomes in vivo was demonstrated in the liver of transgenic mice expressing Cre from the albumin promoter. This novel gene transfer system has the potential to confer long-term episomal transgene expression and therefore to correct genetic defects with reduced vector-related toxicity and without insertional mutagenesis.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1128/JVI.78.12.6556-6566.2004\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000221772000048\n\nView details for PubMedID 15163748\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC416543\n\nAbstract\n\nWe report the immunological characterization of three colon carcinoma cell lines, COLO 205, SW620 and SW403, which we selected to combine with cytokine-secreting fibroblasts for the development of an allogeneic tumour cell vaccine. The cell lines expressed HLA-A2 as well as shared tumour-associated antigens (TAAs) representative of colon carcinomas: CEA, Ep-CAM, MUC1, HER2/neu and MAGE antigens. They did not secrete high levels of the immunosuppressive factors TGF-beta, IL-10 or prostaglandins. The lines presented TAAs in a manner recognized by immune effector cells, which was demonstrated by the lysis of SW620 by HLA-A2-restricted anti-p53 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). COLO 205 and SW620 were genetically modified to express the co-stimulatory molecule CD80 (B7.1), which increased the ability of the cells to stimulate CTL in vitro. CTL clones derived from HLA-A2+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with the CD80-expressing lines lysed the stimulator cell and an HLA-A2+ colon cancer cell line, but did not lyse an isogeneic fibroblast line or an HLA-A2- colon cancer cell line. CTL clones derived from colon carcinoma patients immunized with an allogeneic vaccine containing these lines demonstrated killing of autologous tumour cells, the vaccine cell lines and other HLA-A2+ colon cancer cell lines, but not fibroblasts isogeneic to certain of the target cell lines. Our studies demonstrate that these colon carcinoma cell lines express shared TAAs that can induce CTLs which recognize and lyse other colon carcinoma cells, and support the continued clinical evaluation of the CD80 gene modified allogeneic colon cell/cytokine-secreting fibroblast carcinoma vaccine.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000176518200014\n\nView details for PubMedID 12100028\n\nAbstract\n\nWe have evaluated whether i.p. murine ovarian tumors could be treated with an IL-2 plasmid DNA complexed with the cationic lipid, (+/-)-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-2, 3-bis(tetradecyloxy)-1-propanaminium bromide/dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DMRIE/DOPE). Reporter gene studies were initially conducted in which mice bearing i.p. murine ovarian teratocarcinoma (MOT) were injected i.p. with reporter gene plasmid DNA (pDNA):DMRIE/DOPE. Histochemical analyses revealed that transfection occurred primarily in the tumor cells of the ascites, with only a minority of other ascitic cells or surrounding tissues transfected. IL-2 levels in the MOT ascites were determined after i. p. injection of either IL-2 pDNA:DMRIE/DOPE or recombinant IL-2 protein. IL-2 was detected in tumor ascites for up to 10 days after a single i.p. injection of IL-2 pDNA:DMRIE/DOPE, but was undetectable 24 h after a single i.p. injection of IL-2 protein. In an antitumor efficacy study, MOT tumor-bearing mice injected i.p. with IL-2 pDNA:DMRIE/DOPE on days 5, 8, and 11 after tumor cell implant had a significant inhibition of tumor ascites (p = 0.001) as well as a significant increase in survival (p = 0.008). A cytokine profile of the MOT tumor ascites revealed that mice treated with IL-2 pDNA:DMRIE/DOPE had an IL-2-specific increase in the levels of IFN-gamma and GM-CSF. Taken together, these findings indicate that i. p. treatment of ovarian tumors with IL-2 pDNA:DMRIE/DOPE can lead to an increase in local IL-2 levels, a change in the cytokine profile of the tumor ascites, and a significant antitumor effect.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000084134200005\n\nView details for PubMedID 10586027\n\nAbstract\n\nThe immunosuppressive protein transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) inhibits the activation of various immune effector cells including cytotoxic T lymphocytes and may therefore inhibit the efficacy of immunostimulatory interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene therapy. In this study, we investigated the effect of TGF-beta downregulation on IL-2 gene therapy in the intraperitoneal model of murine ovarian teratoma (MOT). MOT cells, like many human ovarian carcinomas, were found to produce TGF-beta. Production of TGF-beta by MOT cells was suppressed using a TGF-beta antisense plasmid vector (pCEP4/TGF-beta antisense). Subcutaneous immunization of C3H mice with a mixture of IL-2 gene-transduced fibroblasts and TGF-beta antisense-modified MOT cells induced significantly better protection against a subsequent intraperitoneal tumor challenge compared with immunization with unmodified MOT cells alone [11/16 (69%) vs 4/21 (19%) tumor-free animals, P < 0.01]. Immunization with either a mixture of IL-2 gene modified fibroblasts and unmodified MOT cells [2/12 (17%) tumor-free animals] or TGF-beta antisense-modified MOT cells alone (0/13 tumor free animals) failed to induce significant protection compared with immunization with unmodified MOT cells. These data show that combined TGF-beta antisense and IL-2 gene therapy is required to generate effective antitumor responses in the MOT model. Our findings suggest that tumor cell expression of immunosuppressive factors may inhibit cytokine immunogene therapy and may have potential implications for the development of future clinical immunogene therapy protocols.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000077351700010\n\nView details for PubMedID 9826461\n\nAbstract\n\nTo study the combined potential of wild-type p53 gene transfer and administration of cisplatin for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, the authors used the 9L rat glioblastoma cell line, which expresses a mutant p53.Stable expression of wild-type p53 in 9L cells was achieved by transfection of the cells with a wild-type p53-expressing plasmid (pCEP4p53). The resultant cell line, 9LpCEP4p53, was found to be more sensitive to cisplatin treatment in vitro than control (9LpCEP4) cells. The in vitro growth rates of control cells and wild-type p53-modified cells were similar in the absence of cisplatin. Fischer 344 rats were implanted intracerebrally with 9LpCEP4p53 cells and intraperitoneally administered 4 mg/kg cisplatin weekly for 7 weeks. These animals survived significantly longer than animals that were implanted with 9LpCEP4p53 cells but were given no cisplatin treatment. In contrast, concurrent cisplatin treatment provided no benefit for animals implanted with 9LpCEP4 cells. Tumors that developed in animals that had been implanted with 9LpCEP4p53 cells and treated with cisplatin had lost expression of wild-type p53, indicating a correlation between expression of wild-type p53 and cisplatin sensitivity in vivo.The findings of this study suggest that p53-based gene therapy in combination with cisplatin-based chemotherapy may be superior to single-modality treatment in dealing with glioblastoma multiforme.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000072133800016\n\nView details for PubMedID 9488309\n\nAbstract\n\nSeveral investigators have employed interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene transfer to enhance the immunogenicity of tumor cell vaccines. We describe in this report the construction and characterization of retroviral vectors for IL-2 gene therapy. Human IL-2 cDNA with a chimeric rat preproinsulin/IL-2 DNA leader sequence was subcloned into the pLXSN (long terminal repeat promoter) and pLNCX (cytomegalovirus [CMV] promoter) vectors to generate the plasmids pLXSN-iIL2 and pLNCX-iIL2, respectively. Human IL-2 cDNA with a chimeric human tissue factor/IL-2 DNA leader sequence was utilized to construct the vector pLXSN-tIL2. The levels of IL-2 secreted by transduced tumor cells and fibroblasts were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of culture supernatants and compared with those of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) activated in vitro with calcium ionophore and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The highest levels of IL-2 secreted by transduced tumor cells (760 units/10(6) cells/24 h), adult fibroblasts (625 units/10(6) cells/24 h), and embryonic fibroblasts (3,975 units/10(6) cells/24 h) were 150- to 1,000-fold higher than than secreted by the activated PBMC (4 units/10(6) cells/24 h). Similar levels of IL-2 were expressed by human fibroblasts transduced with pLXSN vectors employing the preproinsulin (pLXSN-iIL2) or tissue factor (pLXSN-tIL2) leader sequences (range in IL-2 units/10(6) cells/24 h pLXSN-iIL2 = 375-625 vs. pLXSN-tIL2 = 90-440). Because IL-2-transduced cells for clinical applications are generally irradiated to prevent cellular proliferation, we evaluated the effects of radiation on IL-2 production. Radiation doses between 1,500 and 10,000 cGy resulted in gradual decreases in IL-2 secretion by transduced cells. The range of the decrease in IL-2 secretion was 7-11% by day 7, 0-29% by day 14, and 25-50% by day 35. For clinical applications, stable production of the vector in high concentrations is an important consideration. The retroviral vector pLXSN-tIL2 produced the highest viral titer and was chosen for further characterization. Southern blot analysis of SacI-digested genomic DNA from the LXSN-tIL2 producer cell line and SacI-digested pLXSN-tIL2 plasmid DNA revealed the expected 3.2-kbp fragment, suggesting the absence of transgene rearrangement and the suitability of this vector as a candidate for clinical applications.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1997YJ86800003\n\nView details for PubMedID 9409449\n\nAbstract\n\nTherapeutic and prophylactic vaccines that harness the potential of the immune system against a number of gynecologic cancers are now being developed. The therapeutic vaccines coerce the cellular components of the immune system to attack malignant tissue. The prophylactic vaccines induce the production of antibodies capable of neutralizing viral antigens before they infect host cells. However, malignant tumors are usually a heterogeneous mixture of different malignant cells, and it is likely that variant tumor clones within a tumor may not express the target antigen or may possess defects in their antigen-presenting mechanism. Ultimately, therapeutic vaccines may be better suited for the treatment of preinvasive disease or for use as an adjuvant following primary therapy. The prospects for developing efficacious vaccines to treat or prevent cervical, ovarian, uterine, and other gynecologic cancers are promising, however. This article describes the methodology of and rationale for these vaccines.\n\nView details for PubMedID 9394368\n\nAbstract\n\nWe compared the efficacy of gene therapy mediated by interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene-modified tumor cells to gene therapy mediated by IL-2 transduced fibroblasts in the CT-26 model of murine colorectal carcinoma. We transduced CT-26 tumor cells and BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts with three different retroviral vectors using three different promoters for the human IL-2 gene: DC/TKIL-2 (thymidine kinase promoter), LXSN-iIL2 (long terminal repeat promoter), and LNCX-iIL2 (cytomegalovirus promoter). These transductions resulted in CT-26 and 3T3 subclones that secreted different amounts of IL-2. Immunization of animals with either CT-26/IL-2 cells or with fibroblast/IL-2 cells mixed with CT-26 induced similar levels of immunity that protected 62-82% of animals against a subsequent tumor challenge with parental CT-26. However, mice developed tumors at the site of inoculation in 46% of the animals immunized with CT-26/IL-2 cells. In a separate experiment, CT-26/IL-2 cells were exposed to 6,000 cGy of gamma irradiation to prevent tumor growth at the site of inoculation. Although the CT-26/IL-2 cells continued to secrete IL-2 after irradiation, they were no longer effective at inducing antitumor immunity. In contrast, both irradiated and nonirradiated fibroblast/IL-2 cells, mixed with irradiated CT-26, were equally effective at inducing antitumor immunity. These data suggest that in the CT-26 model, fibroblast-mediated IL-2 gene therapy has advantages for the induction of antitumor immunity and abrogation of tumorigenic potential at the site of inoculation compared with tumor cell-mediated IL-2 gene therapy.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1995RN34600002\n\nView details for PubMedID 7582256\n\nAbstract\n\nWe have established and characterized a new glioblastoma cell line, termed GT9, from a biopsy sample of a female adult patient with glioblastoma multiforme. The line has now undergone over 60 passages and has been successfully cultured after cryopreservation. Immunofluorescence analyses with a panel of monoclonal antibodies were positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin, and negative for neurofilament, galactocerebroside, and fibronectin, a pattern typical of glial cells. Based on a tetraploid, the composite karyotype of GT9 cells included the loss of chromosome 10, gain of chromosome 7, and the presence of double minute chromosomes, three of the most common karyotypic abnormalities in glioblastoma. Sequence analysis of p53 cDNA revealed a homozygous double mutation at codon 249 (commonly mutated in aflatoxin-associated hepatocellular carcinoma) and codon 250. Moreover, there was a complete absence of wild-type p53. However, unlike the majority of human glioblastomas previously described, the expression of platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B), a potent mitogenic autocrine factor, was low in GT9 cells. The expression and phosphorylation of c-Jun and Jun-B, downstream mediators of the PDGF pathway, were also low. Thus, deregulation of the PDGF pathway does not appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of the GT9 glioblastoma. Conversely, Jun-D, a negative regulator of cell growth, was also low. In addition, Phosphorylated Egr-1, a recently reported suppressor of PDGF-B/v-sis-transformed cells, was also low, suggesting that the lack of activation of the PDGF pathway was not due to these suppressive mechanisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1995QL75600010\n\nView details for PubMedID 7757303\n\nAbstract\n\nIn 11 rats, the microcirculation of the repeatedly ischaemic (stunned) left ventricular myocardium was studied using in vivo fluorescence microscopy. Stunning was provoked by six subsequent 10 min ligations of the left anterior descending coronary artery, each of them followed by a 20 min reperfusion period. In the stunned myocardium showing hypokinetic wall motion, myocardial blood flow dropped by 55%; in this region, leukocytes often appeared in slow-flow capillaries plugging capillary branches. Closely linking to leukocyte adherence, a rise of microvascular permeability was documented by extravascular clouds of fluorescent dextran. After nifedipine treatment, in ischaemic regions marked dilatation of larger A1 and A2 arterioles was noted, in addition to the ischaemia-induced dilatation of smaller A3 and A4 arterioles. Furthermore nifedipine and nisoldipine reduced the number of adherent leukocytes in post-capillary venules and capillaries of the repeatedly ischaemic myocardium. In 12 patients with coronary one-vessel disease and without previous transmural myocardial infarction, elective coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was performed (balloon inflation for 2 min). After elective PTCA of the LAD, a significant rise in the proportion of activated neutrophils was noted. After elective 2 min PTCA of the LAD, coronary sinus blood samples showed a marked rise of FMLC stimulated superoxide anion production, whereas passive deformability decreased considerably. Furthermore, an increase in chemotactic activity in coronary sinus blood samples was observed.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1993MK92600014\n\nView details for PubMedID 8293784\n\nAbstract\n\nThe 1F7 idiotype previously defined (J Immunol 147:933;1991 and Eur J Immunol 22:1749;1992) is expressed on antibodies reactive to different proteins of HIV (gp41, p24, gp120). Since serum levels of 1F7 (IgM or IgG) are significantly higher in patients with HIV lymphoma as opposed to HIV-infected individuals, normal controls and non-HIV lymphoma patients, we hypothesized the B-cell neoplasms were the source of the idiotype. However, immunohistochemistry on cryostat sections revealed no 1F7 idiotype signal on neoplastic B-cells nor tumor infiltrative T-cells (n = 8). Interestingly, reactive lymphocytosis adjacent to tumor masses and reactive follicular hyperplastic controls (n = 5) exhibited significant 1F7 reactivity. The reactivity appeared in paracortical and perifollicular lymphoid regions, predominantly regions of B, T and antigen presenting cells in lymph nodes or tonsils. A survey of electrophoretically defined paraproteins with anti-HIV specificities derived from HIV-infected patients showed no Western blot reactivity with the 1F7 anti-idiotypic antibody. Therefore, the idiotype does not appear to be a direct product of B-cell neoplasia or abnormal B-cell proliferation, but is produced by B cell clones responding to HIV infection. This high level of serum 1F7 reactivity could be an important clue in the pathogenesis of HIV lymphomas and confers a highly predictive serological test for HIV lymphoma.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1993MG99100007\n\nView details for PubMedID 8300126\n\nAbstract\n\n1. Myocardial hypertrophy, for instance in patients with hypertensive heart disease, is characterized by a reduction of coronary vascular reserve, even in the presence of normal coronary arteries. In hypertensive animals, on the microcirculatory level functional changes can be observed before the onset of any structural rarefications. In 10 rats with renal hypertension and pressure-induced left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), the microcirculation of the left ventricular myocardium was studied using in vivo fluorescence microscopy and morphometric analysis. Renal hypertension was provoked by clipping of the left renal artery. After 8 weeks, systolic blood pressure in LVH rats averaged 172 +/- 8 mm Hg, compared to 91 +/- 2 mm Hg in 10 normotensive (NT) rats. In LVH rats, distances of plasma-perfused capillaries were significantly increased (NT = 17.7; LVH = 20 microns; p less than 0.001). Volume density, surface density, and length density of capillaries in LVH rats were reduced by 20% compared to NT rats. Capillary red cell content as measured by the ratio of capillaries filled with red cells to those containing plasma alone (Q) in LVH animals exceeded that in NT rats (LVH: Q = 0.83 +/- 0.04; NT: Q = 0.77 +/- 0.04; p less than 0.025). During hypoxia (H, 5% O2) capillary red cell recruitment in LVH rats (Q: control c = 0.83; H = 0.95) was diminished by 33% as compared to NT rats (Q: c = 0.77; H = 0.95). Thus, in addition to the decreased capillary density, the reduction of capillary red cell recruitment may be responsible for chest pain in patients with LVH and normal coronary arteries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1990EF89800002\n\nView details for PubMedID 2148154"
