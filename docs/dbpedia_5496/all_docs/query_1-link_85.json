        "meta_description": "Objectives There is little known about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on patients with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (iRMD). We examined epidemiological characteristics associated with severe disease, then with death. We also compared mortality between patients hospitalised for COVID-19 with and without iRMD.\n\nMethods Individuals with suspected iRMD-COVID-19 were included in this French cohort. Logistic regression models adjusted for age and sex were used to estimate adjusted ORs and 95% CIs of severe COVID-19. The most significant clinically relevant factors were analysed by multivariable penalised logistic regression models, using a forward selection method. The death rate of hospitalised patients with iRMD-COVID-19 (moderate–severe) was compared with a subset of patients with non-iRMD-COVID-19 from a French hospital matched for age, sex, and comorbidities.\n\nResults Of 694 adults, 438 (63%) developed mild (not hospitalised), 169 (24%) moderate (hospitalised out of the intensive care unit (ICU) and 87 (13%) severe (patients in ICU/deceased) disease. In multivariable imputed analyses, the variables associated with severe infection were age (OR=1.08, 95% CI: 1.05–1.10), female gender (OR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.25–0.80), body mass index (OR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.02–1.12), hypertension (OR=1.86, 95% CI: 1.01–3.42), and use of corticosteroids (OR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.09–3.54), mycophenolate mofetil (OR=6.6, 95% CI: 1.47–29.62) and rituximab (OR=4.21, 95% CI: 1.61–10.98). Fifty-eight patients died (8% (total) and 23% (hospitalised)). Compared with 175 matched hospitalised patients with non-iRMD-COVID-19, the OR of mortality associated with hospitalised patients with iRMD-COVID-19 was 1.45 (95% CI: 0.87–2.42) (n=175 each group).\n\nConclusions In the French RMD COVID-19 cohort, as already identified in the general population, older age, male gender, obesity, and hypertension were found to be associated with severe COVID-19. Patients with iRMD on corticosteroids, but not methotrexate, or tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 inhibitors, should be considered as more likely to develop severe COVID-19. Unlike common comorbidities such as obesity, and cardiovascular or lung diseases, the risk of death is not significantly increased in patients with iRMD.\n\nTrial registration number ClinicalTrials.gov Registry ([NCT04353609][1]).\n\n [1]: /lookup/external-ref?link_type=CLINTRIALGOV&access_num=NCT04353609&atom=%2Fannrheumdis%2F80%2F4%2F527.atom",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn December 2019, COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, emerged from Wuhan, China.1 2 Beginning 1 February 2020, France had a total of six confirmed cases and was under nationwide lockdown by 17 March,3 and now has just over 344 000 confirmed cases and over 30 000 deaths (as of 5 October 2020),4 with a mean age 68 years for hospitalised patients and 79 years for those who died.5 Stay-at-home restrictions in France decreased hospitalisations nearly 11-fold5; however, there remains an urgent need for safe, effective COVID-19 therapies.\n\nThere is a concern that patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy for inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (iRMD) could be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation than the general population, particularly in those patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal failure.6 7 Several recent studies in patients with iRMD8–10 and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)11 suggested an increased risk for hospitalisation and severe disease when using glucocorticoids, although no effect on severity or mortality was found with biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) use. A decreased risk for severe COVID-19 was suggested in such populations with respect to anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) drugs.11 12 Although these studies indicate that the incidence of immune-mediated inflammatory disease among patients with COVID-19 was consistent with the general population and not associated with worse outcomes, population size was a major limitation. Recent European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines suggested that patients with RMD are not at greater risk for developing SARS-CoV-2 infection or more severe disease,13 but as additional information is obtained through ongoing research and clinical trials, recommendations are continually updated.\n\nTaken together, to provide optimal care and ensure positive clinical outcomes in patients with RMD who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is imperative to understand how these diseases, their comorbidities and the use of immunotherapies may affect progression to severe COVID-19 or death. The primary objective of the current study, by analysing a French cohort of 694 patients with iRMD and COVID-19, was to investigate the frequency of severe infection and predictive factors associated with disease severity. The secondary objectives were to identify predictive factors associated with death and to compare the death rate in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 with and without RMD.\n\nResults\n\nPatient characteristics\n\nWe collected a total of 758 records and the final evaluation of COVID-19 severity (primary endpoint) was available for 694 patients (the 13 children were not included in the statistical analysis and are described separately). COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed in 59% of cases based on PCR or serology (408/694). Of those patients with confirmed COVID-19, approximately 47% (193/408) had a mild, 34% (138/408) moderate, and 19% (77/408) severe infection. In the other patients, COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed by typical CT scan in 6% (46/694), anosmia/ageusia in 14% (96/694), and typical clinical symptoms in 21% (144/694).\n\nPatients were mainly women (66.6%, 462/694) with a mean age of 56.1±16.4 years, and 51.6% (358/694) were over the age of 55 years (figure 1). Seventy-one percent of the population had at least one comorbidity (492/694), with hypertension (n=182, 26.3%), obesity with a BMI over 30 kg/m2 (n=146, 21%), respiratory disease (n=99, 14.3%), and cardiovascular disease (n=85, 12.3%) as the most common. Chronic inflammatory arthritis diseases were the most frequent diagnoses in the cohort (66.9%, 464/694), mostly rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis, followed by systemic autoimmune diseases (15.4%, 107/694). A detailed description of all iRMD diagnoses included in the cohort is presented in table 1.\n\nDevelopment of severe disease\n\nThe frequency of severe COVID-19 in patients with iRMD with confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 was 12.5% (87/694). Age was a driver of disease severity, as only 11 patients between 18 and 54 years developed severe COVID-19, whereas this number increased to 20 in patients between 65 and 74 years (adjusted OR (aOR)=6.46, 95% CI: 2.97–14.06), and to 45 in patients over 75 years (aOR=19.82, 95% CI: 9.69–40.52). There were no severe paediatric cases. When adjusted for age and sex, among the most common comorbidities correlated with severe disease were morbid obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m2) (aOR=4.10, 95% CI: 1.28–13.11), diabetes (aOR=2.14, 95% CI: 1.12–4.12), and hypertension (aOR=2.30, 95% CI: 1.34–3.96). Interestingly, interstitial lung disease (aOR=2.87, 95% CI: 1.06–7.80) and chronic renal failure (aOR=3.22, 95% CI: 1.51–6.90) were also associated with disease severity. Severe disease was observed more frequently in patients with vasculitis (aOR=2.25, 95% CI: 1.13–4.41) and autoinflammatory diseases (aOR=7.88, 95% CI: 1.39–37.05), compared with patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis. These results are summarised in table 2. Morbid obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic renal failure were still correlated with severe disease when the analysis was focused only on patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (online supplemental table 1). While not significant, there was also an association with interstitial lung disease (aOR=2.64, 95% CI: 0.94–7.36). In the PCR-confirmed population, severe disease was still observed more frequently in patients with vasculitis (aOR=2.39, 95% CI: 1.14–4.98), compared with patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis.\n\nSupplemental material\n\nRegarding treatments for iRMDs, more frequent severe disease was observed with the use of corticosteroids (aOR=2.25, 95% CI: 1.33–3.79), mycophenolate mofetil (aOR=7.67, 95% CI: 1.73–28.04) and rituximab (aOR=4.34, 95% CI: 1.77–10.63). It should be noted that use of TNFα blockers (n=202, aOR=0.44, 95% CI: 0.19–1.04), interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors (n=26, aOR=0.63, 95% CI: 0.12–2.28), methotrexate (n=252, aOR=0.63, 95% CI: 0.37–1.08) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (n=57, aOR=1.06, 95% CI: 0.31–2.96) were not associated with severe COVID-19 (table 3). When the same analysis was performed on the population with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, rituximab was still identified as a contributor to the development of severe disease (aOR=6.35, 95% CI: 2.23–18.11) (online supplemental table 2). However, there was no significant increase in the development of severe disease with the use of corticosteroids (aOR=1.72, 95% CI: 0.98–3.04) nor significant decrease in the development of severe disease with the use of TNF blockers (aOR=0.42, 95% CI: 0.16–1.15).\n\nSimilar results were observed in patients with RA (n=213) with respect to the severity of disease including age (aOR age ≥75=16.89, 95% CI: 4.90–88.60), hypertension (aOR=3.36, 95% CI: 1.23–8.60), and use of corticosteroids (aOR=2.57, 95% CI: 1.01–6.52) or rituximab (aOR=5.97, 95% CI: 1.18–27.63) (online supplemental tables 3 and 4).\n\nResults of the multivariable analysis are presented in table 4. Due to the number of events (87 patients with severe infection), the analysis was limited to no more than seven variables, which were selected based on clinical expertise. Older age (OR=1.08, 95% CI: 1.05–1.10), female gender (OR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.25–0.80), BMI (OR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.02–1.12), hypertension (OR=1.86, 95% CI: 1.01–3.42), and use of corticosteroids (OR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.09–3.54), mycophenolate mofetil (OR=6.6, 95% CI: 1.47–29.62) and rituximab (OR=4.21, 95% CI: 1.61–10.98) were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity. Results of the imputed analysis are similar compared with the available case analysis (see table 4).\n\nHospitalisation status\n\nHospitalisation status of the whole population (n=694) was also affected, and was more frequently related to older age (aOR age ≥75=15.51, 95% CI: 9.11–26.40) as well as the presence of coronary heart disease (aOR=2.73, 95% CI: 1.40–5.30), diabetes (aOR=5.37, 95% CI: 2.66–10.85), hypertension (aOR=1.99, 95% CI: 1.33–2.98), and chronic renal failure (aOR=2.76, 95% CI: 1.26–6.04) (online supplemental table 5). Use of corticosteroids (aOR=2.76, 95% CI: 1.90–4.02) and TNFα inhibitors (aOR=0.35, 95% CI: 0.22–0.55) also affected hospitalisation status and were harmful or protective, respectively (online supplemental table 6). Within the multivariable imputed analysis, age (OR=1.05, 95% CI: 1.04–1.07), diabetes (OR=4.33, 95% CI: 2.07–9.07), BMI (OR=1.06, 95% CI: 1.02–1.10), use of corticosteroids (OR=1.94, 95% CI: 1.24–3.05) and colchicine (OR=3.34, 95% CI: 1.14–9.79) remain associated with a higher risk of hospitalisation. Use of TNF inhibitors (OR=0.55, 95% CI: 0.32–0.95) and female gender (OR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.43–0.99) were associated with less frequent hospitalisation (online supplemental table 7).\n\nPaediatric cases\n\nThirteen patients were paediatric cases and are described in table 5.\n\nSurvival\n\nFifty-eight patients in our cohort died, resulting in an overall death rate of 8.3%, which corresponds to 22.6% of death in the hospitalised subgroup (58/256) (table 6). Of 335 patients in the LICORNE cohort (patients with non-RMD COVID-19), only 175 controls were matched for age, sex and comorbidities (cardiac disease, diabetes, hypertension, BMI and renal failure) (online supplemental table 8). By matching patients to the LICORNE cohort, a death rate of 25.1% (95% CI: 18.7–31.6) was observed in the French RMD COVID-19 compared with 18.9% (95% CI: 13.1–24.7, respectively) with an OR of 1.45 (95% CI: 0.87–2.42; n=175 in each group). In the iRMD COVID-19 cohort, death was more frequent in patients aged ≥55 years (aOR (55–64)=5.54, 95% CI: 1.62–23.13; aOR (65–74)=6.70, 95% CI: 1.95–28.07; aOR (≥75)=59.02, 95% CI: 21.79–221.45), and with the presence of interstitial lung disease (aOR=3.82, 95% CI: 1.27–11.49), coronary heart disease (aOR=2.18, 95% CI: 1.05–4.53), diabetes (aOR=2.89, 95% CI: 1.39–6.02), hypertension (aOR=3.08, 95% CI: 1.56–6.08) or chronic renal failure (aOR=5.22, 95% CI: 2.22–12.31). In addition, systemic autoimmune diseases were more frequently associated with death (aOR=2.65, 95% CI: 1.15–5.95) compared with chronic inflammatory arthritis (table 6). Regarding treatments, use of corticosteroids (aOR=2.64, 95% CI:1.36–5.12), colchicine (aOR=8.21, 95% CI: 1.60–37.97), mycophenolate mofetil (aOR=14.20, 95% CI: 2.26–70.24) or rituximab (aOR=4.04, 95% CI: 1.35–12.04) was associated with a higher frequency of death, whereas a reduced hazard was observed in patients taking methotrexate for iRMD (aOR=0.34, 95% CI: 0.16–0.70) (table 7). Of note, the use of TNFα or IL-6 inhibitors was not associated with death (aOR=0.74, 95% CI: 0.22–2.01 and aOR=0.50, 95% CI: 0.05–2.38, respectively). A detailed description of all fatalities is available in online supplemental table 9.\n\nTreatments used in French patients with iRMD who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection\n\nWith respect to COVID-19-specific treatment used in the French iRMD-COVID-19 cohort, among the total population, 18.6% (129/694) received antiviral or immunomodulating therapies, which increased to 30.2% (51/169) with moderate infection and 37.9% (33/87) with severe infection. HCQ, alone or in combination with azithromycin, was the most used therapy, in 9.4% (65/694) of the patients. Routinely available antiviral therapies (ritonavir in combination with lopinavir or darunavir) were mainly administered to hospitalised patients (10.5%; 27/256). Use of anti-cytokine therapies (tocilizumab and anakinra) was rare (0.6%) (online supplemental table 10).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe current observational, multicentre, French cohort study examined the frequency of severe COVID-19 and factors associated with outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with iRMD. Though similar in objective to the Global Rheumatology Alliance Study,23 the present investigation analysed a larger patient population with iRMD from a single country and monitored individual data for at least 21 days after the first clinical sign of disease to confirm evolution of COVID-19 and retrieve missing data. While the results do not suggest causality, they inform on treatment options for COVID-19 in patients with iRMD.\n\nUnderlying immune dysfunction and treatment with immunosuppressive agents raised the possibility of an increased COVID-19 severity in patients with iRMD. In addition to age (≥75 years), comorbidities such as chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m2), and renal failure increased the risk for severe COVID-19, again reflecting the observed trend in subjects with non-rheumatic diseases.6 7 In the present study, death was observed more frequently in patients with iRMD, but this difference in the frequency of mortality did not reach statistical significance. Systemic autoimmune diseases (mainly systemic lupus, systemic sclerosis, Sjögren syndrome and myositis) and vasculitis were found to be independent factors for severe infection and/or mortality, suggesting that a history of drug-induced immunosuppression may worsen the prognosis.24 25 For autoinflammatory diseases, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the very low number of patients (n=13). The use of higher continual doses of corticosteroids in these populations could have led to a poor outcome.\n\nWithin the current cohort, RMD treatments had a variable association with COVID-19 severity and mortality. We assessed the association of each medication separately because the number of different medications was too high to compare to a single reference group and also because of possible overlap between medications, such as conventional synthetic DMARD and biologic DMARD (bDMARD) combination therapy. Studies of patients with RMD and IBD showed that long-term corticosteroid use increased the risk of severe COVID-19 infection and death.8 11 In contrast, two other studies, CHIC26 and RECOVERY,27 recently demonstrated that methylprednisolone 250 mg or dexamethasone 6 mg were beneficial when patients with COVID-19 develop a severe form (cytokine storm syndrome), respectively. These studies and ours suggest that the beneficial or aggravating effect of corticosteroids is a matter of timing. Conversely, anti-TNFα therapies were associated with a lower frequency of severe infection or mortality and also with less frequent hospitalisation. These findings are consistent with a previous study that found lower odds of hospitalisation with bDMARD/targeted synthetic DMARD monotherapy, driven largely by anti-TNF therapies.8 Of note, similar observations have been made outside the scope of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a beneficial effect of bDMARDs on the risk of sepsis after serious infection or a fatal outcome.28 Methotrexate use significantly reduced mortality and was not associated with the risk of severe disease, yet we caution against causal inference regarding drug effects given significant potential for residual confounding, notably indication bias. Interestingly, IL-6 inhibitors did not appear to affect COVID-19 severity or related death in our study. However, the number of patients taking anti-IL-6 agents or JAK inhibitors was small and may have been insufficient to demonstrate other underlying effects. Likewise, the small number of patients treated with colchicine, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and rituximab (less than 10 patients with severe disease or death) does not allow for conclusions on a potential risk. Furthermore, potential indication bias exists since these drugs are mostly prescribed in patients with autoinflammatory, systemic autoimmune diseases, and vasculitis, all of which were associated with a higher frequency of severe infection in our cohort. Finally, as patients with active or very active iRMD tend to be more heavily medicated and we were unable to obtain information about disease activity, we cannot rule out that the higher frequencies identified with some treatments could be confounded by indication. To further explore these results, ancillary studies will be performed, with the potential merging of data with GRA and EULAR cohorts. Similarly, treatment with agents such as HCQ did not appear to have a positive impact on the frequency of severe disease or death.29 Our study shows that patients previously treated with HCQ can develop COVID-19, consistent with a report of severe COVID-19 in patients with lupus taking HCQ.30 We also collected information about the antiviral and immunomodulating therapies, notably HCQ, used by French clinicians to manage COVID-19. Our study is informative, but not built to inform on potential efficacy of antiviral and/or immunomodulating therapies in COVID-19 management.\n\nDespite communication to all French paediatric rheumatology centres, the RMD COVID-19 cohort contained only 13 children that displayed minor symptoms. This strengthens the previous reports on the lack of severe COVID-19 in children with rheumatic diseases.31 In addition, no iRMD COVID-19 paediatric case fulfilled the criteria for the recently recognised SARS-CoV-2-related paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome, a post-infection disease.32 This latter observation could suggest that inflammatory diseases in children are not a risk factor for this specific syndrome.\n\nThere are several limitations to the current study. The first limitation is that no formal sample size calculation was performed for primary and secondary objectives and we cannot exclude a lack of adequate statistical power to detect significant differences. Moreover, due to the small number of events, multivariate analysis was not performed for death. The mortality rate in our cohort (8.3%) was similar to a previous report (7.2%).23 Though the current study analysed a large patient population assessed within a single country, the impact of selection bias on the observed frequency of death cannot be dismissed. During the beginning phases of the pandemic, immense pressure on the French medical system precluded PCR testing in all patients and focused confirmatory efforts on subjects with the most severe disease. Despite this shortcoming of unconfirmed diagnosis, our cohort includes a substantial ambulatory subgroup with mild disease. Since the French RMD COVID-19 cohort is an observational multicentre cohort study, we cannot rule out that all highly suspected/confirmed symptomatic patients with COVID-19 were enrolled by comparison to LICORNE registry of all suspected/confirmed patients with COVID-19 admitted at the Lille University Hospital. A potential selection bias in favour of inclusion of more patients with severe iRMD COVID-19 could explain the observed non-significant higher mortality in hospitalised population with iRMD compared with a cohort with non-iRMD. Furthermore, the care provided for patients of LICORNE registry may be different than that delivered to patients from the French iRMD COVID-19 cohort. Indeed, even if all patients come from the same country, discrepancies could exist in the care delivered to patients across the country, with respect to the type of hospital (secondary or tertiary care, academic, non-academic), resources available (including ICU beds and ventilators), the availability of alternative care and palliative care facilities, and the treatment approach itself, especially at the beginning of the pandemic. Moreover, within countries, another variable is the differential effect of the pandemic over time across the country. Nevertheless, an increased risk of death has recently been shown in 19 patients with RA/systemic lupus erythematosus/psoriasis-COVID-19 with an adjusted HR of 1.19 (1.11–1.27).6\n\nIn conclusion, the present study assesses the frequency of mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 and mortality in a large cohort of patients with rheumatic, autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases being treated in France. In addition to monitoring the evolution of COVID-19 severity and outcomes, we confirmed the impact of comorbidities within the population with iRMD and generated preliminary data on the effects of anti-rheumatic therapies on disease prognosis following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed a higher frequency of death in the hospitalised population with iRMD compared with a cohort with non-iRMD from hospitalised patients with similar comorbidities, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Furthers studies are warranted to confirm these results."
