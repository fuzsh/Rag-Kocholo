        "text": "Methimazole-induced hypothyroidism causes cellular damage in the spleen, heart, liver, lung and kidney.\n\nPubMed\n\nCano-Europa, Edgar; Blas-Valdivia, Vanessa; Franco-Colin, Margarita; Gallardo-Casas, Carlos Angel; Ortiz-ButrÃ³n, Rocio\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIt is known that a hypothyroidism-induced hypometabolic state protects against oxidative damage caused by toxins. However, some workers demonstrated that antithyroid drug-induced hypothyroidism can cause cellular damage. Our objective was to determine if methimazole (an antithyroid drug) or hypothyroidism causes cellular damage in the liver, kidney, lung, spleen and heart. Twenty-five male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups: euthyroid, false thyroidectomy, thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroidism, methimazole-induced hypothyroidism (60 mg/kg), and treatment with methimazole (60 mg/kg) and a Tâ injection (20 Î¼g/kg/d sc). At the end of the treatments (4 weeks for the pharmacological groups and 8 weeks for the surgical groups), the animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and they were transcardially perfused with 10% formaldehyde. The spleen, heart, liver, lung and kidney were removed and were processed for embedding in paraffin wax. Coronal sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. At the end of treatment, animals with both the methimazole- and thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroidism had a significant reduction of serum concentration of thyroid hormones. Only methimazole-induced hypothyroidism causes cellular damage in the kidney, lung, liver, heart, kidney and spleen. In addition, animals treated with methimazole and Tâ showed cellular damage in the lung, spleen and renal medulla with lesser damage in the liver, renal cortex and heart. The thyroidectomy only altered the lung structure. The alterations were prevented by Tâ completely in the heart and partially in the kidney cortex. These results indicate that tissue damage found in hypothyroidism is caused by methimazole. Copyright Â© 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Stockpiles of lewisite still exist in many parts of the world and pose potential environmental and human health threat. Exposure to lewisite and similar chemicals causes intense cutaneous inflammatory response. However, morbidity and mortality in the exposed population is not only the result of cutaneous damage but is also a result of systemic injury. Here, we provide data delineating the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI) following cutaneous exposure to lewisite and its analog phenylarsine oxide (PAO) in a murine model. Both agents caused renal tubular injury, characterized by loss of brush border in proximal tubules and tubular cell apoptosis accompanied by increases in serum creatinine, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule-1. Interestingly, lewisite exposure enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the kidney and resulted in the activation of autophagic and DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathways with increased expression of beclin-1, autophagy-related gene 7, and LC-3A/B-II and increased phosphorylation of Î³-H 2 A.X and checkpoint kinase 1/2, respectively. Terminal deoxyribonucleotide-transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells were detected in renal tubules along with enhanced proapoptotic BAX/cleaved caspase-3 and reduced antiapoptotic BCL 2 . Scavenging ROS by cutaneous postexposure application of the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine reduced lewisite-induced autophagy and DNA damage. In summary, we provide evidence that topical exposure to lewisite causes AKI. The molecular mechanism underlying these changes involves ROS-dependent activation of autophagy and DDR pathway associated with the induction of apoptosis.\n\nVaried dose exposures to ultrafine particles in the motorcycle smoke cause kidney cell damages in male mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nWardoyo, Arinto Y P; Juswono, Unggul P; Noor, Johan A E\n\n2018-01-01\n\nUltrafine particles (UFPs) are one of motorcycle exhaust emissions which can penetrate the lung alveoli and deposit in the kidney. This study was aimed to investigate mice kidney cell physical damage (deformation) due to motorcycle exhaust emission exposures. The motorcycle exhaust emissions were sucked from the muffler with the rate of 33â¯cm 3 /s and passed through an ultrafine particle filter system before introduced into the mice exposure chamber. The dose concentration of the exhaust emissions was varied by setting the injected time of the 20s, 40s, 60s, 80s, and 100s. The mice were exposed to the smoke in the chamber for 100â¯s twice a day. The impact of the ultrafine particles on the kidney was observed by identifying the histological image of the kidney cell deformation using a microscope. The exposure was conducted for 10â¯days. The kidney observations were carried out on day 11. The results showed that there was a significant linear correlation between the total concentration of ultrafine particles deposited in the kidneys and the physical damage percentages. The increased concentrations of ultrafine particles caused larger cell deformation to the kidneys.\n\nSpectroscopic photoacoustics for assessing ischemic kidney damage\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBerndl, Elizabeth S. L.; He, Xiaolin; Yuen, Darren A.; Kolios, Michael C.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nIschemic reperfusion injuries (IRIs) are caused by return of blood to a tissue or organ after a period without oxygen or nutrients. Damage in the microvasculature causes an inflammatory response and heterogeneous scarring, which is associated with an increase in collagen in the extracellular matrix. Although most often associated with heart attacks and strokes, IRI also occurs when blood reperfuses a transplanted organ. Currently, monitoring for IRI is limited to biopsies, which are invasive and sample a limited area. In this work, we explored photoacoustic (PA) biomarkers of scarring. IRI events were induced in mice (n=2) by clamping the left renal artery, then re-establishing flow. At 53 days post-surgery, kidneys were saline perfused and cut in half laterally. One half was immediately imaged with a VevoX system (Fujifilm-VisualSonics, Toronto) in two near infrared ranges - 680 to 970 nm (NIR), and 1200 to 1350 nm (NIR II). The other half was decellularized and then imaged at NIR and NIR II. Regions of interest were manually identified and analyzed for each kidney. For both cellularized and decellularized samples, the PA signal ratio based on irradiation wavelengths of 715:930 nm was higher in damaged kidneys than for undamaged kidneys (p < 0.0001 for both). Damaged kidneys had ROIs with spectra indicating the presence of collagen in the NIR II range, while healthy kidneys did not. Collagen rich spectra were more apparent in decellularized kidneys, suggesting that in the cellularized samples, other components may be contributing to the signal. PA imaging using spectral ratios associated with collagen signatures may provide a non-invasive tool to determine areas of tissue damage due to IRIs.\n\nAÎ² Damages Learning and Memory in Alzheimer's Disease Rats with Kidney-Yang Deficiency\n\nPubMed Central\n\nQi, Dongmei; Qiao, Yongfa; Zhang, Xin; Yu, Huijuan; Cheng, Bin; Qiao, Haifa\n\n2012-01-01\n\nPrevious studies demonstrated that Alzheimer's disease was considered as the consequence produced by deficiency of Kidney essence. However, the mechanism underlying the symptoms also remains elusive. Here we report that spatial learning and memory, escape, and swimming capacities were damaged significantly in Kidney-yang deficiency rats. Indeed, both hippocampal AÎ² 40 and 42 increases in Kidney-yang deficiency contribute to the learning and memory impairments. Specifically, damage of synaptic plasticity is involved in the learning and memory impairment of Kidney-yang deficiency rats. We determined that the learning and memory damage in Kidney-yang deficiency due to synaptic plasticity impairment and increases of AÎ² 40 and 42 was not caused via NMDA receptor internalization induced by AÎ² increase. Î²-Adrenergic receptor agonist can rescue the impaired long-term potential (LTP) in Kidney-yang rats. Taken together, our results suggest that spatial learning and memory inhibited in Kidney-yang deficiency might be induced by AÎ² increase and the decrease of Î² 2 receptor function in glia.

Clinical studies have indeed demonstrated that the severity and rate of progression of renal damage tends to be greater among men, compared with women. Experimental studies also support the notion that female sex is protective and male sex permissive, for the development of CKD in non-diabetics, through the opposing actions of estrogens and testosterone. However, when we consider diabetes-induced kidney damage, in the setting of either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, the contribution of gender to the progression of renal disease is somewhat uncertain. Previous studies on the effects of estrogens in the pathogenesis of progressive kidney damage have primarily focused on mesangial cells. More recently, data on the effects of estrogens on podocytes, the cell type whose role may include initiation of progressive diabetic renal disease, became available. The aim of this review will be to summarize the main clinical and experimental data on the effects of estrogens on the progression of diabetes-induced kidney injury. In particular, we will highlight the possible biological effects of estrogens on podocytes, especially considering those critical for the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney damage.\n\nAutophagy sequesters damaged lysosomes to control lysosomal biogenesis and kidney injury\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMaejima, Ikuko; Takahashi, Atsushi; Omori, Hiroko; Kimura, Tomonori; Takabatake, Yoshitsugu; Saitoh, Tatsuya; Yamamoto, Akitsugu; Hamasaki, Maho; Noda, Takeshi; Isaka, Yoshitaka; Yoshimori, Tamotsu\n\n2013-01-01\n\nDiverse causes, including pathogenic invasion or the uptake of mineral crystals such as silica and monosodium urate (MSU), threaten cells with lysosomal rupture, which can lead to oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis or necrosis. Here, we demonstrate that lysosomes are selectively sequestered by autophagy, when damaged by MSU, silica, or the lysosomotropic reagent L-Leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLOMe). Autophagic machinery is recruited only on damaged lysosomes, which are then engulfed by autophagosomes. In an autophagy-dependent manner, low pH and degradation capacity of damaged lysosomes are recovered. Under conditions of lysosomal damage, loss of autophagy causes inhibition of lysosomal biogenesis in vitro and deterioration of acute kidney injury in vivo. Thus, we propose that sequestration of damaged lysosomes by autophagy is indispensable for cellular and tissue homeostasis.

This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of protective effects of curcumin against cisplatin-induced kidney inflammation and apoptosis in rats. Eighteen rats were equally divided into three groups; normal (0.5% CMC-Na), cisplatin (CDPP) (7âmg/kg i.p.), and cisplatin+curcumin (CMN100) groups. Curcumin was given at a dose of 100âmg/kg orally for nine days, starts one week before giving a single dose of cisplatin. Kidney and plasma were taken for analysis. Cisplatin challenged rats demonstrated kidney injury as shown by reduced creatinine clearance, increased of plasma BUN, plasma creatinine, and kidney MDA, decreased of kidney GSH levels, and kidney histopathology alterations. Also, cisplatin increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and NF-ÎºB expression, which subsequently increased mRNA expression of TNF-Î±, IL-6, KIM-1, NGAL, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio as well as decreased mRNA expression of IL-10 in kidney tissues. Pre-treatment with curcumin significantly ameliorated inflammation and apoptosis induced by cisplatin. In addition, curcumin downregulated Ctr1 and OCT2 drug transporters as compared to cisplatin group. Histopathological examination furthers confirmed the kidney damage protection effect of curcumin. These data indicate that curcumin has nephroprotective properties against cisplatin-induced kidney damage in rats and this effect is associated with its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis profiles, in addition to its antioxidant. Hence, curcumin may be useful for preventing kidney damage against cisplatin administration.

Hausen, Bruna; Moresco, Rafael N.; Garcia, Solange C.; da Silva, Cristiane B.; Burger, Marilise E.\n\n2015-04-01\n\nHaloperidol (HP) nanoencapsulation improves therapeutic efficacy, prolongs the drug action time, and reduces its motor side effects. However, in a view of HP toxicity in organs like liver and kidneys in addition to the lack of knowledge regarding the toxicity of polymeric nanocapsules, our aim was to verify the influence of HP-nanoformulation on toxicity and oxidative stress markers in the liver and kidneys of rats, also observing the damage caused in the blood. For such, 28 adult male Wistar rats were designated in four experimental groups ( n = 7) and treated with vehicle (C group), free haloperidol suspension (FH group), blank nanocapsules suspension (B-Nc group), and haloperidol-loaded lipid-core nanocapsules suspension (H-Nc group). The nanocapsules formulation presented the size of approximately 250 nm. All suspensions were administered to the animals (0.5 mg/kg/day-i.p.) for a period of 28 days. Our results showed that FH caused damage in the liver, evidenced by increased lipid peroxidation, plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase, as well as decreased cellular integrity and vitamin C levels. In kidneys, FH treatment caused damage to a lesser extent, observed by decreased activity of Î´-aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALA-D) and levels of VIT C. In addition, FH treatment was also related to a higher DNA damage index in blood. On the other hand, animals treated with H-Nc and B-Nc did not show damage in liver, kidneys, and DNA. Our study indicates that the nanoencapsulation of haloperidol was able to prevent the sub-chronic toxicity commonly observed in liver, kidneys, and DNA, thus reflecting a pharmacological superiority in relation to free drug.\n\nAcute kidney failure\n\nMedlinePlus\n\nKidney failure; Renal failure; Renal failure - acute; ARF; Kidney injury - acute ...

In the present study we investigated whether these drugs can protect against hypoxic damage in a whole kidney preparation. Tolbutamide (200 microM) and glibenclamide (10 microM) were applied to the isolated perfused rat kidney prior to changing the gassing from oxygen to nitrogen for 30 min. Hypoxic perfusions resulted in an increased fractional excretion of glucose (FE % glucose 14.3+/-1.5 for hypoxic perfusions vs 4.9+/-1.6 for normoxic perfusions, mean +/- s.e. mean, P<0.05), which could be completely restored by 200 microM tolbutamide (5.7+/-0.4 for tolbutamide vs 14.3+/-1.5 for untreated hypoxic kidneys, P<0.01). Furthermore, tolbutamide reduced the total amount of LDH excreted in the urine (220+/-100 mU for tolbutamide vs. 1220+/-160 mU for untreated hypoxic kidneys, P<0.01). Comparable results were obtained with glibenclamide (10 microM). In agreement with the effect on functional parameters, ultrastructural analysis of proximal tubules showed increased brush border preservation in tolbutamide treated kidneys compared to untreated hypoxic kidneys. We conclude that glibenclamide and tolbutamide are both able to reduce hypoxic damage to proximal tubules in the isolated perfused rat kidney when applied in the appropriate concentrations.\n\nA case of acute kidney injury caused by granulomatous interstitial nephritis associated with sarcoidosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nHorino, Taro; Matsumoto, Tatsuki; Inoue, Kosuke; Ichii, Osamu; Terada, Yoshio\n\n2018-05-01\n\nSarcoidosis affects multiple organs including lung, heart and kidney. Sarcoidosis causes hypercalcemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, and rarely, granulomatous interstitial nephritis, resulting in renal stromal damage. Granulomatous interstitial nephritis is characterized as interstitial nephritis with noncaseating epithelioid granulomas. Diagnosing granulomatous interstitial nephritis before patient's death is challenging; hence, only few cases proven by renal biopsy have been reported till date. We present a case of acute kidney injury caused by granulomatous interstitial nephritis as a renal manifestation of sarcoidosis proven by renal biopsy, which can be confirmed by 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Glucocorticoid therapy was helpful for improving and maintaining her renal function over a 6-year period.\n\nSulphonylurea drugs reduce hypoxic damage in the isolated perfused rat kidney\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEngbersen, Richard; Moons, Miek M; Wouterse, Alfons C; Dijkman, Henry B; Kramers, Cees; Smits, Paul; Russel, Frans G M\n\n2000-01-01\n\nSulphonylurea drugs have been shown to protect against hypoxic damage in isolated proximal tubules of the kidney.

Recurrent kidney stone disease and nephrocalcinosis, particularly in pre-pubertal children, should alert the physician to the possibility of an inborn error of metabolism as the underlying cause. Unfortunately, the lack of recognition and knowledge of the five disorders has frequently resulted in an unacceptable delay in diagnosis and treatment, sometimes with grave consequences. A high index of suspicion coupled with early diagnosis may reduce or even prevent the serious long-term complications of these diseases. In this paper, we review the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of patients with APRT deficiency, cystinuria, Dent disease, FHHNC and PH with emphasis on childhood manifestations.

L.; He, Xiaolin; Yuen, Darren A.; Kolios, Michael C.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nIschemic reperfusion injuries (IRIs) occur after blood returns to a tissue or organ after a period without oxygen or nutrients, which causes an inflammatory response leading to heterogeneous scarring of the nearby tissue and vasculature. This is associated with long-term decreases blood flow, and necrosis. Although most commonly associated with heart attacks and strokes, IRIs are also a side effect of organ transplants, when the organ is reperfused in the recipient's body after being transported from the donor to the transplant hospital. Currently, the optimal method of monitoring for IRI is limited to biopsies, which are invasive and poorly monitor the spatial heterogeneity of the damage. To non-invasively identify changes in kidneys, the left renal artery in mice (n=3) was clamped for 45 minutes to create an IRI event. Both kidneys of each animal were monitored using photoacoustics (PA) with the VevoLAZR system (Fujifilm-VisualSonics, Toronto) three, four and eight weeks after surgery. IRI-treated kidneys show increased picosirius red staining, indicative of collagen (0.601 vs 0.042, p < 0.0001), decreased size as assessed by cross-sectional area (7.8 mm2 vs 35.9 mm2 , p < 0.0001), and decreased oxygen saturation (sO2; 62% vs 77%, p = 0.02). Analysis of the photoacoustic data shows that a two-point metric, the 715:930 nm ratio of the whole kidney (1.05 vs 0.57, p = 0.049) and the optical spectral slope (OSS) (0.8 * 10-3 vs 3.0 * 10-3, p = 0.013) are both able to differentiate between IRI-treated and healthy kidneys. These data suggest that photoacoustics can be used as a non-invasive method to observe in vivo changes in the kidney due to IRI.\n\nBasal damage and oxidative DNA damage in children with chronic kidney disease measured by use of the comet assay.\n\nPubMed\n\nAykanat, Banu; Demircigil, Gonca Cakmak; Fidan, Kibriya; Buyan, Necla; Gulleroglu, Kaan; Baskin, Esra; Bayrakci, Umut Selda; Sepici, Aylin; Buyukkaragoz, Bahar; Karakayali, Hamdi; Haberal, Mehmet; Burgaz, Sema\n\n2011-10-09\n\nOne consequence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an elevated risk for cancer. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is an increased incidence of at least some cancers in kidney-dialysis patients. Cancer risk after kidney transplantation has mainly been attributed to immunosuppressive therapy. There are no data evaluating DNA damage in children with CKD, in dialysis patients, or following kidney transplantation. In this study, the comet assay and the enzyme-modified comet assay - with the use of endonuclease III (Endo III) and formamidopyrimidine glycosylase (FPG) enzymes - were conducted to investigate the basal damage and the oxidative DNA damage as a result of treatment in peripheral blood lymphocytes of children. Children at various stages of treatment for kidney disease, including pre-dialysis patients (PreD) (n=17), regular hemodialysis patients (HD) (n=15), and those that received kidney transplants (Tx) (n=17), comprised the study group. They were compared with age- and gender-matched healthy children (n=20) as a control group. Our results show that the %DNA intensity, a measure of basal damage, was significantly increased in children with CKD (mean Â± SD) (5.22 Â± 1.57) and also in each of the PreD, HD, and Tx groups [(4.92 Â± 1.23), (4.91 Â± 1.35), and (5.79 Â± 1.94), respectively, vs the healthy children (2.74 Â± 2.91) (p<0.001). Significant increases in oxidative DNA damage were only found in the FPG-sensitive sites for the PreD and Tx groups, compared with control and HD groups (p<0.05), suggesting that basal DNA damage was more evident for the PreD, HD, and Tx groups. The findings of the present study indicate a critical need for further research on genomic damage with different endpoints and also for preventive measures and improvements in treatment of pediatric patients, in order to improve their life expectancy. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The kidneys are the primary organs involved in the excretion and retention of NaF. The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of NaF treatment on renal cell apoptosis, DNA damage, and the protein expression levels of cytosolic cytochrome C (Cyt C) and cleaved caspases 9, 8, and 3 in vivo. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into four groups (control, low fluoride, medium fluoride, and high fluoride) and administered 0, 50, 100, and 200 mg/L of NaF, respectively, via drinking water for 120 days. Histopathological changes in the kidneys were visualized using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Renal cell apoptosis was examined using flow cytometry, and renal cell DNA damage was detected using the comet assay. Cytosolic Cyt C and cleaved caspases 9, 8, and 3 protein expression levels were visualized using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The results showed that NaF treatment increased apoptosis and DNA damage. In addition, NaF treatment increased the protein expression levels of cytosolic Cyt C and cleaved caspases 9, 8, and 3. These results indicated that NaF induces apoptosis in the kidney of rats through caspase-mediated pathway, and DNA damage may be involved in this process.\n\nKidney damage in extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy: a numerical approach for different shock profiles.\n\nPubMed\n\nWeinberg, Kerstin; Ortiz, Michael\n\n2009-08-01\n\nIn shock-wave lithotripsy--a medical procedure to fragment kidney stones--the patient is subjected to hypersonic waves focused at the kidney stone. Although this procedure is widely applied, the physics behind this medical treatment, in particular the question of how the injuries to the surrounding kidney tissue arise, is still under investigation. To contribute to the solution of this problem, two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations of a human kidney under shock-wave loading are presented. For this purpose a constitutive model of the bio-mechanical system kidney is introduced, which is able to map large visco-elastic deformations and, in particular, material damage. The specific phenomena of cavitation induced oscillating bubbles is modeled here as an evolution of spherical pores within the soft kidney tissue. By means of large scale finite element simulations, we study the shock-wave propagation into the kidney tissue, adapt unknown material parameters and analyze the resulting stress states. The simulations predict localized damage in the human kidney in the same regions as observed in animal experiments. Furthermore, the numerical results suggest that in first instance the pressure amplitude of the shock wave impulse (and not so much its exact time-pressure profile) is responsible for damaging the kidney tissue.\n\nAltered paracellular cation permeability due to a rare CLDN10B variant causes anhidrosis and kidney damage.\n\nPubMed\n\nKlar, Joakim; Piontek, JÃ¶rg; Milatz, Susanne; Tariq, Muhammad; Jameel, Muhammad; Breiderhoff, Tilman; Schuster, Jens; Fatima, Ambrin; Asif, Maria; Sher, Muhammad; MÃ¤bert, Katrin; Fromm, Anja; Baig, Shahid M; GÃ¼nzel, Dorothee; Dahl, Niklas\n\n2017-07-01\n\nClaudins constitute the major component of tight junctions and regulate paracellular permeability of epithelia. Claudin-10 occurs in two major isoforms that form paracellular channels with ion selectivity. We report on two families segregating an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by generalized anhidrosis, severe heat intolerance and mild kidney failure. All affected individuals carry a rare homozygous missense mutation c.144C>G, p.(N48K) specific for the claudin-10b isoform. Immunostaining of sweat glands from patients suggested that the disease is associated with reduced levels of claudin-10b in the plasma membranes and in canaliculi of the secretory portion. Expression of claudin-10b N48K in a 3D cell model of sweat secretion indicated perturbed paracellular Na+ transport. Analysis of paracellular permeability revealed that claudin-10b N48K maintained cation over anion selectivity but with a reduced general ion conductance. Furthermore, freeze fracture electron microscopy showed that claudin-10b N48K was associated with impaired tight junction strand formation and altered cis-oligomer formation. These data suggest that claudin-10b N48K causes anhidrosis and our findings are consistent with a combined effect from perturbed TJ function and increased degradation of claudin-10b N48K in the sweat glands. Furthermore, affected individuals present with Mg2+ retention, secondary hyperparathyroidism and mild kidney failure that suggest a disturbed reabsorption of cations in the kidneys. These renal-derived features recapitulate several phenotypic aspects detected in mice with kidney specific loss of both claudin-10 isoforms. Our study adds to the spectrum of phenotypes caused by tight junction proteins and demonstrates a pivotal role for claudin-10b in maintaining paracellular Na+ permeability for sweat production and kidney function.\n\nDNA damage response in nephrotoxic and ischemic kidney injury\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nYan, Mingjuan; Tang, Chengyuan\n\nDNA damage activates specific cell signaling cascades for DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, senescence, and/or cell death. Recent studies have demonstrated DNA damage response (DDR) in experimental models of acute kidney injury (AKI). In cisplatin-induced AKI or nephrotoxicity, the DDR pathway of ATR/Chk2/p53 is activated and contributes to renal tubular cell apoptosis. In ischemic AKI, DDR seems more complex and involves at least the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family, and p53; however, while ATM may promote DNA repair, p53 may trigger cell death. Targeting DDR for kidney protection in AKI therefore reliesmoreÂ Â» on a thorough elucidation of the DDR pathways in various forms of AKI.Â«Â less\n\nMitoQ blunts mitochondrial and renal damage during cold preservation of porcine kidneys.\n\nPubMed\n\nParajuli, Nirmala; Campbell, Lia H; Marine, Akira; Brockbank, Kelvin G M; Macmillan-Crow, Lee Ann\n\n2012-01-01\n\nCold preservation has greatly facilitated the use of cadaveric kidneys for transplantation but damage occurs during the preservation episode. It is well established that oxidant production increases during cold renal preservation and mitochondria are a key target for injury. Our laboratory has demonstrated that cold storage of renal cells and rat kidneys leads to increased mitochondrial superoxide levels and mitochondrial electron transport chain damage, and that addition of Mitoquinone (MitoQ) to the preservation solutions blunted this injury. In order to better translate animal studies, the inclusion of large animal models is necessary to develop safe preclinical protocols. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that addition of MitoQ to cold storage solution preserves mitochondrial function by decreasing oxidative stress, leading to less renal tubular damage during cold preservation of porcine kidneys employing a standard criteria donor model. Results showed that cold storage significantly induced oxidative stress (nitrotyrosine), renal tubular damage, and cell death. Using High Resolution Respirometry and fresh porcine kidney biopsies to assess mitochondrial function we showed that MitoQ significantly improved complex II/III respiration of the electron transport chain following 24 hours of cold storage. In addition, MitoQ blunted oxidative stress, renal tubular damage, and cell death after 48 hours. These results suggested that MitoQ decreased oxidative stress, tubular damage and cell death by improving mitochondrial function during cold storage. Therefore this compound should be considered as an integral part of organ preservation solution prior to transplantation.\n\nMitoQ Blunts Mitochondrial and Renal Damage during Cold Preservation of Porcine Kidneys\n\nPubMed Central\n\nParajuli, Nirmala; Campbell, Lia H.; Marine, Akira; Brockbank, Kelvin G.

Six groups of five Wistar-Albino rats each were assigned as controls (C), acute kidney deficiency (AKD), zinc-supplemented (+Zn), acute kidney deficiency, zinc-supplemented (AKDÂ +Â Zn), chronic kidney deficiency (CKD) and zinc-supplemented chronic kidney deficiency (CKDÂ +Â Zn). The levels of 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were determined, being the lowest in the CKD group (pÂ <Â 0.05), higher in the C group than those of rats with CKD but lower than that of all the other groups (pÂ <Â 0.05). There were no significant differences between the controls and the CKDÂ +Â Zn group, or between the AKD and the +Zn groups. Among all groups, the highest 8-OHdG level was found in the AKDÂ +Â Zn group (pÂ <Â 0.05). DNA damage was greater in acute renal failure than in rats with chronic renal failure. The DNA damage in the zinc group was significantly higher than in the controls.\n\nQuantification of vascular damage in acute kidney injury with fluorine magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoore, Jeremy K; Chen, Junjie; Pan, Hua; Gaut, Joseph P; Jain, Sanjay; Wickline, Samuel A\n\n2018-06-01\n\nTo design a fluorine MRI/MR spectroscopy approach to quantify renal vascular damage after ischemia-reperfusion injury, and the therapeutic response to antithrombin nanoparticles (NPs) to protect kidney function. A total of 53 rats underwent 45âmin of bilateral renal artery occlusion and were treated at reperfusion with either plain perfluorocarbon NPs or NPs functionalized with a direct thrombin inhibitor (PPACK:phenyalanine-proline-arginine-chloromethylketone). Three hours after reperfusion, kidneys underwent ex vivo fluorine MRI/MR spectroscopy at 4.7âT to quantify the extent and volume of trapped NPs, as an index of vascular damage and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Microscopic evaluation of structural damage and NP trapping in non-reperfused renal segments was performed. Serum creatinine was quantified serially over 7 days. The damaged renal cortico-medullary junction trapped a significant volume of NPs (Pâ=â0.04), which correlated linearly (râ=â0.64) with the severity of kidney injury 3âh after reperfusion. Despite global large vessel reperfusion, non-reperfusion in medullary peritubular capillaries was confirmed by MRI and microscopy, indicative of continuing hypoxia due to vascular compromise. Treatment of animals with PPACK NPs after acute kidney injury did not accelerate kidney functional recovery. Quantification of ischemia-reperfusion injury after acute kidney injury with fluorine MRI/MR spectroscopy of perfluorocarbon NPs objectively depicts the extent and severity of vascular injury and its linear relationship to renal dysfunction. The lack of kidney function improvement after early posttreatment thrombin inhibition confirms the rapid onset of ischemia-reperfusion injury as a consequence of vascular damage and non-reperfusion. The prolongation of medullary ischemia renders cortico-medullary tubular structures susceptible to continued necrosis despite restoration of large vessel flow, which suggests limitations to acute interventions after\n\nAzilsartan improves glycemic status and reduces kidney damage in zucker diabetic fatty rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nHye Khan, Md Abdul; NeckÃ¡Å, Jan; Haines, Jasmine; Imig, John D\n\n2014-08-01\n\nAzilsartan medoxomil (AZL-M), an angiotensin II receptor blocker, demonstrates antihypertensive and organ protective effects in hypertension. We investigated the efficacy of AZL-M to ameliorate metabolic syndrome and kidney damage associated with type 2 diabetes using Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. ZDF rats were treated with vehicle or AZL-M for 8 weeks. Zucker diabetic lean (ZDL) rats were used as controls. Urine and plasma samples were collected for biochemical analysis, and kidney tissues were used for histopathological and immunohistopathological examination at the end of the 8-week protocol. ZDF rats were diabetic with hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance, and AZL-M ameliorated the diabetic phenotype. ZDF rats were hypertensive compared with ZDL rats (181Â±6 vs. 129Â±7mm Hg), and AZL-M decreased blood pressure in ZDF rats (116Â±7mm Hg). In ZDF rats, there was marked renal damage with elevated proteinuria, albuminuria, nephrinuria, 2-4-fold higher tubular cast formation, and glomerular injury compared with ZDL rats. AZL-M treatment reduced renal damage in ZDF rats. ZDF rats demonstrated renal inflammation and oxidative stress with elevated urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 excretion, renal infiltration of macrophages, and elevated kidney malondialdehyde levels. AZL-M reduced oxidative stress and inflammation in ZDF rats. Overall, we demonstrate that AZL-M attenuates kidney damage in type 2 diabetes. We further demonstrate that anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activities of AZL-M contribute to its kidney protective action. Â© American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2014. All rights reserved.

We therefore treated kidney-irradiated mice with the anti-inflammatory and angiogenesis-modulating drug thalidomide in an attempt to prevent the development of late normal tissue damage and radiation nephropathy in the mouse kidney. Methods and Materials: Kidneys of C57Bl/6 mice were irradiated with a single dose of 14Â Gy. Starting from week 16 after irradiation, the mice were fed with thalidomide-containing chow (100Â mg/kg body weight/day). Gene expression and kidney histology were analyzed at 40Â weeks and blood samples at 10, 20, 30, andmoreÂ Â» 40Â weeks after irradiation. Results: Thalidomide improved the vascular structure and vessel perfusion after irradiation, associated with a normalization of pericyte coverage. The drug also reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells but could not suppress the development of fibrosis. Irradiation-induced changes in hematocrit and blood urea nitrogen levels were not rescued by thalidomide. Moreover, thalidomide worsened tubular damage after irradiation and also negatively affected basal tubular function. Conclusions: Thalidomide improved the inflammatory and vascular side effects of kidney irradiation but could not reverse tubular toxicity, which probably prevented preservation of kidney function.Â«Â less\n\nIntermittent hypoxia causes histological kidney damage and increases growth factor expression in a mouse model of obstructive sleep apnea\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAyas, Najib T.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nEpidemiological studies demonstrate an association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and accelerated loss of kidney function. It is unclear whether the decline in function is due to OSA per se or to other confounding factors such as obesity. In addition, the structural kidney abnormalities associated with OSA are unclear. The objective of this study was to determine whether intermittent hypoxia (IH), a key pathological feature of OSA, induces renal histopathological damage using a mouse model. Ten 8-week old wild-type male CB57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to receive either IH or intermittent air (IA) for 60 days. After euthanasia, one kidney per animal was paraformaldehyde-fixed and then sectioned for histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Measurements of glomerular hypertrophy and mesangial matrix expansion were made in periodic acidâSchiff stained kidney sections, while glomerular transforming growth factor-Î²1 (TGF-Î²1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) proteins were semi-quantified by immunohistochemistry. The antigen-antibody reaction was detected by 3,3â²-diaminobenzidine chromogen where the color intensity semi-quantified glomerular protein expression. To enhance the accuracy of protein semi-quantification, the percentage of only highly-positive staining was used for analysis. Levels of TGF-Î², CTGF and VEGF-A proteins in the kidney cortex were further quantified by western blotting. Cellular apoptosis was also investigated by measuring cortical antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) proteins by western blotting. Further investigation of cellular apoptosis was carried out by fluorometric terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) staining. Finally, the levels of serum creatinine and 24-hour urinary albumin were measured as a general index of renal function.

Eucalyptus globules, a rich source of bioactive compounds, and have been shown to possess antioxidative properties. The purpose of this study, carried out on male Wistar rats, was to evaluate the beneficial effects of Eucalyptus globulus extract upon acetaminophen-induced damages in kidney. Our study is realized in the Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences of Sfax (Tunisia). 32 Wistar male rats; were divided into 4 batches: a control group (n=8), a group of rats treated with acetaminophen (goomg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection during 4 days (n=8), a group receiving Eucalyptus globulus extract (130 mg of dry leaves/kg/day) in drinking water during 42 days after 2 hours of acetaminophen administration (during 4 days) (n=8) and group received only Eucalyptus (n=8) during 42 days. After 6 weeks, animals from each group were rapidly sacrificed by decapitation. Blood serum was obtained by centrifugation. Under our experimental conditions, acetaminophen poisoning resulted in an oxidative stress evidenced by statistically significant losses in the activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide-dismutase (SOD), glutathione-peroxidase (GPX) activities and an increase in lipids peroxidation level in renal tissue of acetaminophen-treated group compared with the control group. Acetaminophen also caused kidney damage as evident by statistically significant (p<0.05) increase in levels of creatinine and urea and decreased levels of uric acid and proteins in blood. Histological analysis demonstrated alteration of proximal tubules, atrophy of the glomerule and dilatation of urinary space. Previous administration of plant extract is found to alleviate this acetaminophen-induced damage.

Both traditional and non-traditional risk factors contribute to CV damage in CKD. The systemic role of the microbiota as a central player in the pathophysiology of many organs is progressively emerging in the literature: the microbiota is indeed involved in a complex, bi-directional network between many organs, including the kidney and heart connection, although many of these relationships still need to be elucidated through in-depth mechanistic studies. The aim of this review is to provide evidence that microbiota metabolites influence non-traditional risk factors, such as inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in CKD-associated CV damage. Here, we report our current understanding and hypotheses on the gut-kidney and gut-heart axes and provide details on the potential mechanisms mediated by microbial metabolites. More specifically, we summarize some novel hypotheses linking the microbiota to blood pressure regulation and hypertension. We also emphasise the idea that the nutritional management of CKD should be redesigned and include the new findings from research on the intrinsic plasticity of the microbiota and its metabolites in response to food intake. The need is felt to integrate the classical salt and protein restriction approach for CKD patients with foods that enhance intestinal wellness. Finally, we discuss the new perspectives, especially the importance of taking care of the microbiota in order to prevent the risk of developing CKD and hypertension, as well as the still not tested but very promising CKD innovative treatments, such as postbiotic supplementation and bacteriotherapy. This interesting area of research offers potential complementary approaches to the management of CKD and CV damage assuming that the causal mechanisms underlying the gut-kidney and gut-heart axes are clarified. This will pave the way to the design\n\nIncreased risk of kidney damage among Chinese adults with simple renal cyst.\n\nPubMed\n\nKong, Xianglei; Ma, Xiaojing; Zhang, Chengyin; Su, Hong; Gong, Xiaojie; Xu, Dongmei\n\n2018-05-04\n\nThe presence of simple renal cyst (SRC) has been related to hypertension, the early and long-term allograft function, and aortic disease, but the relationship with kidney damage was still controversial. Accordingly, we conducted a large sample cross-sectional study to explore the association of SRC with indicators of kidney damage among Chinese adults. A total of 42,369 adults (aged 45.8âÂ±â13.67 years, 70.6% males) who visited the Health Checkup Clinic were consecutively enrolled. SRC was assessed by ultrasonography according to Bosniak category. Multiple regression models were applied to explore the relationships between SRC and indicators of kidney damage [proteinuria (dipstick urine proteinââ¥â1+) and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (DeGFR)â<â60Â ml/min/1.73Â m 2 ]. Among all participants in the study, the prevalence of SRC was 10.5%. As a categorical outcome, participants with more 1 cyst and with 1 cyst had higher percentage of proteinuria [53 (5.3%) and 93 (2.7%) vs. 596 (1.6%), pâ<â0.001] and DeGFR [57 (5.7%) and 85 (2.5%) vs. 278 (0.7%), pâ<â0.001] compared with participants with no cyst. SRC significantly correlated with proteinuria [OR 1.59 (95% CI 1.30-1.95)] and DeGFR [OR 1.97 (95% CI 1.56-2.47)] after adjusting for potential confounders. Furthermore, the results also demonstrated that maximum diameter (per 1Â cm increase), bilateral location, and multiple cysts significantly correlated with DeGFR in the multiple logistic regression analysis. The study revealed that SRC significantly correlated with kidney damage and special attention should be paid among Chinese adults with SRC.\n\nThe role of fetal-maternal microchimerism as a natural-born healer in integrity improvement of maternal damaged kidney.\n\nPubMed\n\nKajbafzadeh, Abdol-Mohammad; Sabetkish, Shabnam; Sabetkish, Nastaran\n\n2018-01-01\n\nTo identify the fetal stem cell (FSC) response to maternal renal injury with emphasis on renal integrity improvement and Y chromosome detection in damaged maternal kidney. Eight non-green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic Sprague- Dawley rats were mated with GFP-positive transgenic male rats. Renal damage was induced on the right kidney at gestational day 11. The same procedure was performed in eight non-pregnant rats as control group. Three months after delivery, right nephrectomy was performed in order to evaluate the injured kidney. The fresh perfused kidneys were stained with anti-GFP antibody. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was also performed for the Y chromosome detection. Cell culture was performed to detect the GFP-positive cells. Technetium-99m-DMSA renal scan and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were performed after renal damage induction and 3 months later to evaluate the improvement of renal integrity. The presence of FSCs was confirmed by immune histochemical staining as well as immunofluorescent imaging of the damaged part. Gradient PCR of female rat purified DNA demonstrated the presence of Y-chromosome in the damaged maternal kidney. Moreover, the culture of kidney cells showed GPF- positive cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. The acute renal scar was repaired and the integrity of damaged kidney reached to near normal levels in experimental group as shown in DMSA scan. However, no significant improvement was observed in control group. FSC seems to be the main mechanism in repairing of the maternal renal injury during pregnancy as indicated by Y chromosome and GFP-positive cells in the sub-cultured medium.

To evaluate the effects of drinking water fluoride levels on the liver and kidney functions in children with and without dental fluorosis, we identified 210 children who were divided into seven groups with 30 each based on different drinking water fluoride levels in the same residential area. We found that the fluoride levels in serum and urine of these children increased as the levels of drinking water fluoride increased. There were no significant differences in the levels of total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), aspartate transamine (AST), and alanine transamine (ALT) in serum among these groups. However, the activities of serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), urine N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG), and urine gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) in children with dental fluorosis and having water fluoride of 2.15-2.96 mg/L and in children having water fluoride of 3.15-5.69 mg/L regardless of dental fluorosis were significantly higher than children exposed to water fluoride of 0.61-0.87 mg/L in a dose-response manner. In contrast to children with dental fluorosis and having water fluoride of 2.15-2.96 and 3.10-5.69 mg/L, serum LDH activity of children without dental fluorosis but exposed to the same levels of water fluoride as those with dental fluorosis were also markedly lower, but the activities of NAG and gamma-GT in their urine were not. Therefore, our results suggest that drinking water fluoride levels over 2.0mg/L can cause damage to liver and kidney functions in children and that the dental fluorosis was independent of damage to the liver but not the kidney. Further studies on the mechanisms and significance underlying damage to the liver without dental fluorosis in the exposed children are warranted.\n\nChronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology in Sri Lanka: Are leptospirosis and Hantaviral infection likely causes?\n\nPubMed\n\nGamage, Chandika Damesh; Sarathkumara, Yomani Dilukshi\n\n2016-06-01\n\nChronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu) has been a severe burden and a public health crisis in Sri Lanka over the past two decades. Many studies have established hypotheses to identify potential risk factors although causative agents, risk factors and etiology of this disease are still uncertain. Several studies have postulated that fungal and bacterial nephrotoxins are a possible etiological factor; however, the precise link between hypothesized risk factors and the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease has yet to be proven in prior studies. Leptospirosis and Hantavirus infections are important zoonotic diseases that are naturally maintained and transmitted via infected rodent populations and which present similar clinical and epidemiological features. Both infections are known to be a cause of acute kidney damage that can proceed into chronic renal failure. Several studies have reported presence of both infections in Sri Lanka. Therefore, we hypothesized that pathogenic Leptospira or Hantavirus are possible causative agents of acute kidney damage which eventually progresses to chronic kidney disease in Sri Lanka. The proposed hypothesis will be evaluated by means of an observational study design. Past infection will be assessed by a cross-sectional study to detect the presence of IgG antibodies with further confirmatory testing among chronic kidney disease patients and individuals from the community in selected endemic areas compared to low prevalence areas. Identification of possible risk factors for these infections will be followed by a case-control study and causality will be further determined with a cohort study. If the current hypothesis is true, affected communities will be subjected for medical interventions related to the disease for patient management while considering supportive therapies. Furthermore and possibly enhance their preventive and control measures to improve vector control to decrease the risk of infection.

In this study we tested the hypothesis that a tetrapeptide EA-230 (AQGV), might improve survival and attenuate loss of kidney function in a mouse model of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) and ischemia-induced delayed graft function after allogenic kidney transplantation. IRI was induced in male C57Bl/6N mice by transient bilateral renal pedicle clamping for 35 min. Treatment with EA-230 (20â50mg/kg twice daily i.p. for four consecutive days) was initiated 24 hours after IRI when acute kidney injury (AKI) was already established. The treatment resulted in markedly improved survival in a dose dependent manner. Acute tubular injury two days after IRI was diminished and tubular epithelial cell proliferation was significantly enhanced by EA-230 treatment. Furthermore, CTGF up-regulation, a marker of post-ischemic fibrosis, at four weeks after IRI was significantly less in EA-230 treated renal tissue. To learn more about these effects, we measured renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at 28 hours after IRI. EA-230 improved both GFR and RBF significantly. Next, EA-230 treatment was tested in a model of ischemia-induced delayed graft function after allogenic kidney transplantation. The recipients were treated with EA-230 (50 mg/kg) twice daily i.p. which improved renal function and allograft survival by attenuating ischemic allograft damage. In conclusion, EA-230 is a novel and promising therapeutic agent for treating acute kidney injury and preventing IRI-induced post-transplant ischemic allograft injury. Its beneficial effect is associated with improved renal perfusion after IRI and enhanced regeneration of tubular epithelial cells.

HMH prevents the progression of chronic kidney disease in rats when a sufficient amount is taken orally. We assessed whether intrinsic and higher levels of HMH could protect tubular epithelial cells, LLC-PK(1) cells, against known cellular damage caused by xenobiotics, such as cisplatin and cephaloridine, or by hypoxia/reoxygenation treatment. Both cell damage and peroxidation, monitored as the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA), respectively, from cells into the media, were inhibited by HMH in a concentration-dependent manner. The minimum effective concentration of HMH (2.5 Î¼M) seemed to be too low for HMH to only be a direct hydroxyl radical scavenger. Additional antioxidant effect(s) inhibiting reactive oxygen species generation and/or modulating signal transduction pathways were suggested. The possibility that intrinsic HMH could be a protectant for the kidney was indicated. At the same time, for sufficient inhibition, higher concentrations than intrinsic HMH concentrations may be necessary. Patterns of efficacies of HMH on LDH and MDA against different kinds of cellular damage were compared with our reported data on those of corresponding, naturally occurring antioxidants. A common and specific inhibitory mechanism as well as common target(s) in kidney injuries were indicated. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

Chronic RVD induces renal injury partly by promoting renal microvascular (MV) damage and blunting MV repair in the stenotic kidney. We tested the hypothesis that superoxide anion plays a pivotal role in MV dysfunction, reduction of MV density, and progression of renal injury in the stenotic kidney. RAS was induced in 14 domestic pigs and observed for 6 wk. Seven RAS pigs were chronically treated with the superoxide dismutase mimetic tempol (RAS+T) to reduce oxidative stress. Single-kidney hemodynamics and function were quantified in vivo using multidetector computer tomography (CT) and renal MV density was quantified ex vivo using micro-CT. Expression of angiogenic, inflammatory, and apoptotic factors was measured in renal tissue, and renal apoptosis and fibrosis were quantified in tissue sections. The degree of RAS and blood pressure were similarly increased in RAS and RAS+T. Renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were reduced in the stenotic kidney (280.1 Â± 36.8 and 34.2 Â± 3.1 ml/min, P < 0.05 vs. control). RAS+T kidneys showed preserved GFR (58.5 Â± 6.3 ml/min, P = not significant vs. control) but a similar decreases in RBF (293.6 Â± 85.2 ml/min) and further decreases in MV density compared with RAS. These changes were accompanied by blunted angiogenic signaling and increased apoptosis and fibrosis in the stenotic kidney of RAS+T compared with RAS. The current study shows that tempol administration provided limited protection to the stenotic kidney. Despite preserved GFR, renal perfusion was not improved by tempol, and MV density was further reduced compared with untreated RAS, associated with increased renal apoptosis and fibrosis. These results suggest that a tight balance of the renal redox status is necessary for a normal MV repair response to injury, at least at the early stage of RVD, and raise caution\n\nEarly superoxide scavenging accelerates renal microvascular rarefaction and damage in the stenotic kidney\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKelsen, Silvia; He, Xiaochen\n\n2012-01-01\n\nRenal artery stenosis (RAS), the main cause of chronic renovascular disease (RVD), is associated with significant oxidative stress.

To determine whether the causes of DWGF, characteristics of donors and recipients and complications of RTx have changed in the last two decades. Cooperative study of a cohort of 418 kidney grafts performed between 1968 and 2010. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether their kidney transplants were performed between 1968 and 1992 (Group 1) or 1993 and 2010 (Group 2). Sixty eight patients experienced DWGF. Infections were the leading cause of DWGF in both groups (38 and 41%, respectively), followed by cardiovascular diseases (24 and 23% respectively), gastrointestinal disorders (21 and 26% respectively) and cancer (17 and 10% respectively). There were no significant differences in causes of death between the two groups according to the time elapsed since the renal transplantation. In patients in Group 1, the interval between diagnosis of renal failure and dialysis (HD) and the interval between the start of HD and kidney transplantation were significantly lower than in Group 2. The former had also an increased number of acute rejections in the first five years of kidney transplantation (p < 0.001). In Group 2, patients more often received their kidneys from deceased donors, had previous kidney transplantation, higher rate of antibodies to a panel of lymphocytes and an increased incidence of cardiovascular disorders after five years of RTx. The proportion of graft loss due to DWGF has increased over the last 2 decades, but its causes have not changed significantly. Infections are the most common causes of DWGF followed by cardiovascular and digestive diseases.\n\n[Combined heart-kidney transplantation in Mexic].\n\nPubMed\n\nCareaga-Reyna, Guillermo; Zetina-Tun, Hugo JesÃºs; Lezama-Urtecho, Carlos Alberto; HernÃ¡ndez-DomÃ­nguez, JosÃ© Mariano; Santos-Caballero, Marlene\n\nIn our country, heart and kidney transplantation is a novel option for treatment of combined terminal heart and kidney failure.

Description of cases: Between January 1, 2012 and April 30, 2016, we made 92 orthotopic heart transplantations. In five of these cases the heart transplantation was combined with kidney transplantation. There were three male and two female patients with a mean age 25.6 Â± 5.2 years (range, 17-29). The patients improved their renal function and the heart transplantation was successful with an improved quality of life. One patient died from abdominal sepsis. The other patients are doing well.

Serum levels of electrolytes (Na+, K+, Cl(-), HCO3(-)), urea and creatinine were determined. Renal tissue reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), superoxide (SOD) activities were also assessed. The histopathological changes in kidneys were determined using standard methods. In CCl4 treated rats the results showed significant (p<0.05) increases in serum Na+, K+, Cl(-), urea and creatinine. CCl4 also caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in renal tissue SOD, CAT and GSH and significant (p<0.05) increases in MDA.

CAKUT encompass a spectrum of developmental kidney defects, including renal agenesis, hypoplasia, and cystic and non-cystic dysplasia. More than 50 genes have been reported as mutated in CAKUT-affected case subjects. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to bilateral kidney agenesis (BKA) remain largely elusive. Whole-exome or targeted exome sequencing of 183 unrelated familial and/or severe CAKUT-affected case subjects, including 54 fetuses with BKA, led to the identification of 16 heterozygous variants in GREB1L (growth regulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1-like), a gene reported as a target of retinoic acid signaling. Four loss-of-function and 12 damaging missense variants, 14 being absent from GnomAD, were identified. Twelve of them were present in familial or simplex BKA-affected case subjects. Female BKA-affected fetuses also displayed uterus agenesis. We demonstrated a significant association between GREB1L variants and BKA. By in situ hybridization, we showed expression of Greb1l in the nephrogenic zone in developing mouse kidney. We generated a Greb1l knock-out mouse model by CRISPR-Cas9. Analysis at E13.5 revealed lack of kidneys and genital tract anomalies in male and female Greb1l -/- embryos and a slight decrease in ureteric bud branching in Greb1l +/- embryos. We showed that Greb1l invalidation in mIMCD3 cells affected tubulomorphogenesis in 3D-collagen culture, a phenotype rescued by expression of the wild-type human protein. This demonstrates that GREB1L plays a major role in early metanephros and genital development in mice and humans. Copyright Â© 2017 American Society of Human Genetics. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, complete staghorn calculus is rare in polycystic kidney disease and predicts a gloomy prognosis of kidney. For general population, recent data showed metabolic factors were the dominant causes for staghorn calculus, but for polycystic kidney disease patients, the cause for staghorn calculus remained elusive. We report a case of complete staghorm calculus in a polycystic kidney disease patient induced by repeatedly urinary tract infections. This 37-year-old autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease female with positive family history was admitted in this hospital for repeatedly upper urinary tract infection for 3 years. CT scan revealed the existence of a complete staghorn calculus in her right kidney, while there was no kidney stone 3 years before, and the urinary stone component analysis showed the composition of calculus was magnesium ammonium phosphate. UTI is an important complication for polycystic kidney disease and will facilitate the formation of staghorn calculi. As staghorn calculi are associated with kidney fibrosis and high long-term renal deterioration rate, prompt control of urinary tract infection in polycystic kidney disease patient will be beneficial in preventing staghorn calculus formation.\n\nA Short-Term Biological Indicator for Long-Term Kidney Damage after Radionuclide Therapy in Mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPellegrini, Giovanni; Siwowska, Klaudia; Haller, Stephanie; Antoine, Daniel J.; Schibli, Roger; Kipar, Anja; MÃ¼ller, Cristina\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFolate receptor (FR)-targeted radionuclide therapy using folate radioconjugates is of interest due to the expression of the FR in a variety of tumor types. The high renal accumulation of radiofolates presents, however, a risk of radionephropathy. A potential option to address this challenge would be to use radioprotectants, such as amifostine. Methods for early detection of kidney damage thatâin this caseâcannot be predicted based on dose estimations, would facilitate the development of novel therapies. The aim of this study was, therefore, to assess potentially changing levels of plasma and urine biomarkers and to determine DNA damage at an early stage after radiofolate application. The identification of an early indicator for renal damage in mice would be useful since histological changes become apparent only several months after treatment. Mice were injected with different quantities of 177Lu-folate (10 MBq, 20 MBq and 30 MBq), resulting in mean absorbed kidney doses of ~23 Gy, ~46 Gy and ~69 Gy, respectively, followed by euthanasia two weeks (>85% of the mean renal radiation dose absorbed) or three months later. Whereas all investigated biomarkers remained unchanged, the number of Î³-H2AX-positive nuclei in the renal cortex showed an evident dose-dependent increase as compared to control values two weeks after treatment. Comparison with the extent of kidney injury determined by histological changes five to eight months after administration of the same 177Lu-folate activities suggested that the quantitative assessment of double-strand breaks can be used as a biological indicator for long-term radiation effects in the kidneys. This method may, thus, enable faster assessment of radiopharmaceuticals and protective measures by preventing logistically challenging long-term investigations to detect kidney damage.

Converging evidence suggests that GBH, such as Roundup, pose a particular health risk to liver and kidneys although low environmentally relevant doses have not been examined. To address this issue, a 2-year study in rats administering 0.1 ppb Roundup (50 ng/L glyphosate equivalent) via drinking water (giving a daily intake of 4 ng/kg bw/day of glyphosate) was conducted. A marked increased incidence of anatomorphological and blood/urine biochemical changes was indicative of liver and kidney structure and functional pathology. In order to confirm these findings we have conducted a transcriptome microarray analysis of the liver and kidneys from these same animals. The expression of 4224 and 4447 transcript clusters (a group of probes corresponding to a known or putative gene) were found to be altered respectively in liver and kidney (p < 0.01, q < 0.08). Changes in gene expression varied from -3.5 to 3.7 fold in liver and from -4.3 to 5.3 in kidneys. Among the 1319 transcript clusters whose expression was altered in both tissues, ontological enrichment in 3 functional categories among 868 genes were found. First, genes involved in mRNA splicing and small nucleolar RNA were mostly upregulated, suggesting disruption of normal spliceosome activity. Electron microscopic analysis of hepatocytes confirmed nucleolar structural disruption. Second, genes controlling chromatin structure (especially histone-lysine N-methyltransferases) were mostly upregulated. Third, genes related to respiratory chain complex I and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were mostly downregulated. Pathway analysis suggests a modulation of the mTOR and phosphatidylinositol signalling pathways. Gene disturbances associated with the chronic administration of ultra-low dose Roundup reflect a liver and kidney lipotoxic condition and increased cellular growth that may be linked with regeneration in response to toxic effects causing damage\n\nReduced Renal Methylarginine Metabolism Protects against Progressive Kidney Damage\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCaplin, Ben; Boruc, Olga; Bruce-Cobbold, Claire; Cutillas, Pedro; Dormann, Dirk; Faull, Peter; Grossman, Rebecca C.; Khadayate, Sanjay; Mas, Valeria R.; Nitsch, Dorothea D.; Wang, Zhen; Norman, Jill T.; Wilcox, Christopher S.; Wheeler, David C.; Leiper, James\n\n2015-01-01\n\nNitric oxide (NO) production is diminished in many patients with cardiovascular and renal disease. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthesis, and elevated plasma levels of ADMA are associated with poor outcomes. Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH1) is a methylarginine-metabolizing enzyme that reduces ADMA levels. We reported previously that a DDAH1 gene variant associated with increased renal DDAH1 mRNA transcription and lower plasma ADMA levels, but counterintuitively, a steeper rate of renal function decline. Here, we test the hypothesis that reduced renal-specific ADMA metabolism protects against progressive renal damage. Renal DDAH1 is expressed predominately within the proximal tubule. A novel proximal tubuleâspecific Ddah1 knockout (Ddah1PTâ/â) mouse demonstrated tubular cell accumulation of ADMA and lower NO concentrations, but unaltered plasma ADMA concentrations. Ddah1PTâ/â mice were protected from reduced kidney tissue mass, collagen deposition, and profibrotic cytokine expression in two independent renal injury models: folate nephropathy and unilateral ureteric obstruction. Furthermore, a study of two independent kidney transplant cohorts revealed higher levels of human renal allograft methylarginine-metabolizing enzyme gene expression associated with steeper function decline. We also report an association among DDAH1 expression, NO activity, and uromodulin expression supported by data from both animal and human studies, raising the possibility that kidney DDAH1 expression exacerbates renal injury through uromodulin-related mechanisms. Together, these data demonstrate that reduced renal tubular ADMA metabolism protects against progressive kidney function decline. Thus, circulating ADMA may be an imprecise marker of renal methylarginine metabolism, and therapeutic ADMA reduction may even be deleterious to kidney function.

In the current study, the protective effect of ginger extract on ethanol-induced damage was evaluated through determining 8-OHdG, cystatin C, glomerular filtration rate, and pathological changes such as cell proliferation and fibrosis in rats' kidneys. Male wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups and were treated as follows: (1) control, (2) ethanol and (3) ginger extract treated ethanolic (GETE) groups. After a six weeks period of treatment, the results revealed proliferation of glomerular and tubular cells, fibrosis in glomerular and peritubular and a significant rise in the level of 8-OHdG, cystatin C, plasma urea and creatinine. Moreover, compared to the control group, the ethanol group showed a significant decrease in the urine creatinine and creatinine clearance. In addition, significant amelioration of changes in the structure of kidneys, along with restoration of the biochemical alterations were found in the ginger extract treated ethanolic group, compared to the ethanol group. These findings indicate that ethanol induces kidneys abnormality by oxidative DNA damage and oxidative stress, and that these effects can be alleviated using ginger as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.

However, over the past 20Â years a large and consistent body of evidence has been produced suggesting that CV risk progressively increases as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) declines and is already significantly elevated even in the earliest stages of renal damage. Data was supported by the very large collaborative meta-analysis of the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium, which provided undisputable evidence that there is an inverse association between eGFR and CV risk. It is important to remember that in evaluating CV disease using renal parameters, GFR should be assessed simultaneously with albuminuria.Indeed, data from the same meta-analysis indicate that also increased urinary albumin levels or proteinuria carry an increased risk of all-cause and CV mortality. Thus, lower eGFR and higher urinary albumin values are not only predictors of progressive kidney failure, but also of all-cause and CV mortality, independent of each other and of traditional CV risk factors.Although subjects with ESRD are at the highest risk of CV diseases, there will likely be more events in subjects with mil-to-moderate renal dysfunction, because of its much higher prevalence.These findings are even more noteworthy when one considers that a mild reduction in renal function is very common in hypertensive patients.The current European Society of Hypertension (ESH)/European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension recommend to sought in every patient signs of subclinical (or asymptomatic) renal damage. This was defined by the detection of eGFR between 30Â mL/min/1.73Â m 2 and 60Â mL/min/1.73Â m 2 or the\n\nComparison of Aerobic Preservation by Venous Systemic Oxygen Persufflation or Oxygenated Machine Perfusion of Warm-Ischemia-Damaged Porcine Kidneys.\n\nPubMed\n\nKalenski, Julia; Mancina, Elina; Paschenda, Pascal; Beckers, Christian; Bleilevens, Christian; TÃ³thovÃ¡, Ä½ubomÃ­ra; Boor, Peter; Gross, Dominik; Tolba, RenÃ© H; Doorschodt, Benedict M\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe global shortage of donor organs for transplantation has necessitated the expansion of the organ pool through increased use of organs from less ideal donors. Venous systemic oxygen persufflation (VSOP) and oxygenated machine perfusion (OMP) have previously demonstrated beneficial results compared to cold storage (CS) in the preservation of warm-ischemia-damaged kidney grafts. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of VSOP and OMP for the preservation of warm-ischemia-damaged porcine kidneys using the recently introduced Ecosol preservation solution compared to CS using Ecosol or histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution (HTK). Kidneys from German Landrace pigs (n = 5/group) were retrieved and washed out with either Ecosol or HTK after 45 min of clamping of the renal pedicle. As controls, kidneys without warm ischemia, cold stored for 24 h in HTK, were employed. Following 24 h of preservation by VSOP, OMP, CS-Ecosol, or CS-HTK, renal function and damage were assessed during 1 h using the isolat"
