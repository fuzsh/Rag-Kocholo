        "text": "DISCUSSION\n\nOur data from a large cohort of nephrology patients show different thresholds of GFR at onset of the metabolic complications we studied. Whereas anemia and hyperparathyroidism were observed early in stage 3 CKD, other disorders appeared later in the course of the disease. Another original finding was the identification of several factors independently associated with these complications. The importance of this study lies especially in its reliance on a sample of >1000 patients with GFR both measured with a reference method and estimated and its simultaneous assessment of the principal metabolic complications of CKD. It is the first study to examine so large a sample with such diagnostic precision, and it has important clinical and research implications.\n\nComparison of our findings with others is limited by differences in the study populations (patients with CKD versus general population), the cutoffs chosen to define the metabolic complications and the use of different GFR assessment methods; however, we note that, with a few exceptions discussed here, using eGFR in this cohort provided very similar results to those obtained with mGFR. Because our purpose was to improve knowledge of renal function levels and factors influencing the onset of CKD complications, we focused on standard criteria rather than on therapeutic targets to define abnormal values. Nevertheless, in view of the widespread use of the K/DOQI target for clinical intervention for patients who have CKD and are not on dialysis, the analysis was primarily based on anemia defined with these criteria.\n\nWe found, as other studies10–13 did, that the prevalence of anemia increased sharply as GFR decreased. This prevalence, however, was much higher—5, 9, and 7% with mGFR, eGFRcl, and eGFRms, respectively—in patients with a GFR between 60 and 89 ml/min per 1.73 m2 than would have been anticipated from population-based studies, such as National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), 1%, with K/DOQI criteria and eGFRcl.12 On the basis of WHO criteria, our prevalence of 29% for stage 2 CKD was also higher than the 5% in men and 6% in women from NHANES III,11 the 13% in participants of the New Opportunities for Early Renal Intervention by Computerised Assessment (NEOERICA) study,14 or the 15% in the targeted Kidney Early Evaluation Project (KEEP) CKD screening program cohort.33 With the exception of the last, these studies, however, did not take into account the presence of kidney damage, a key element in the definition of stage 2 CKD; this is likely to explain these discrepancies. The higher risk for anemia in black than in white patients here, although not statistically significant but this subgroup was very small, is consistent with that observed in a previous study.33 We also found, as others did, that diabetic nephropathy is related to a higher risk for anemia, independent of GFR level.29,33,34 We otherwise cannot rule out the possibility that the presence of other comorbidities in these patients with CKD may explain, at least in part, the relatively high prevalence of anemia observed in stage 2 and early stage 3, without demonstration of an erythropoietin-dependent mechanism linked to the moderate decrease in GFR. A new finding, to the best of our knowledge, is that obesity is associated with a lower risk for anemia. Although this association requires confirmation from other studies, we noted that some underlying mechanisms, such as better nutrition or less iron deficiency in obese compared with normal-weight patients, may be causal. Finally, we did not confirm the higher risk for anemia with ACEi/ARB treatment suggested by Kamper et al.35 The ROC analysis identified a diagnostic threshold for 90% sensitivity of approximately 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with either mGFR or eGFRms, which means that 90% of the patients with K/DOQI-defined anemia have a GFR lower than these values; it was >50 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with eGFRcl. As expected, GFR threshold for WHO-defined anemia was higher, close to that for hyperparathyroidism. These findings as a whole provide evidence that anemia screening should start in the upper range of GFR in patients with stage 3 CKD and possibly even earlier in those with diabetic kidney disease.\n\nRegarding bone and mineral metabolism disorders, we confirmed the finding by Levin and colleagues1,17–19 that high PTH levels can be observed at stage 2 CKD in a number of patients (17%) and that the prevalence of hyperparathyroidism rises substantially when GFR falls to <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. The detection threshold for 90% sensitivity was close to 50 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with either technique used to assess GFR. As reported elsewhere,24–26 black patients are at higher risk than white patients. A number of studies, however, showed that PTH concentration was higher in black than in white patients, both with and without CKD, at similar calcium intake and vitamin D levels.36,37 Because normal values may differ by race, it is difficult to define hyperparathyroidism in black patients.36 Although not statistically significant, the trend we observed between BMI and hyperparathyroidism is consistent with those from recent studies.38 We also found that BP >130/80 mmHg was independently related to higher PTH levels. Such a cross-sectional association is also reported in patients without CKD,39 but establishing the existence of causality would require a prospective investigation. For hyperphosphatemia, the GFR threshold at diagnosis was 37 ml/min per 1.73 m2, consistent with results from the SEEK study, which used a slightly higher cutoff (1.48 mmol/L).17 Others1,17 have reported that electrolyte disorders occur later in the course of CKD than does renal hormonal dysfunction.\n\nAn original finding of this study, however, was the existence of a higher risk for hyperphosphatemia at a younger age. One possible explanation is protein intake, which may affect plasma phosphate level in patients with CKD. This hypothesis is supported by the higher mean level of urinary urea nitrogen in the patients younger than 65. Moreover, phosphate levels were significantly higher in patients treated with active vitamin D than in those not treated, independent of PTH level and other characteristics. We therefore suggest that screening for hyperparathyroidism should start at a GFR between 50 and 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Because treatment of hyperparathyroidism will affect phosphatemia, it seems reasonable to measure phosphatemia together with PTH and not await a GFR <40 ml/min per 1.73 m2 before measuring it, as suggested by our data.\n\nThere is relatively little information about thresholds for acidosis and electrolyte disturbance in patients with CKD before ESRD. We found an mGFR threshold of approximately 40 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for detecting both metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia. Using a similar cutoff, however, NHANES III found that metabolic acidosis increased significantly at a GFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2.12,16,20 A younger age was independently associated with acidosis. This may be explained, as for hyperphosphatemia, by higher protein intake among younger patients.40 As reported by Braden et al.,41 we observed that patients with tubulointerstitial nephritis had a higher odds ratio for metabolic acidosis, but it was not statistically significant. Men were also at higher risk for hyperkalemia. Importantly, our results did not confirm the previously reported excess risk for metabolic acidosis in patients treated with ACEi or ARB.35 We did confirm such a risk for hyperkalemia with these drugs: Risk more than tripled. Overall, this study suggests that screening for metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia should begin when GFR reaches 40 ml/min per 1.73 m2, but this threshold may be higher in younger patients, in those with diabetes, and in those treated with ACEi or ARB. We, like Cirillo et al.,13 did not observe any association between proteinuria and a higher risk for metabolic complications.\n\nThe major strengths of our study include its large sample size and statistical power, its use of an unbiased measure of renal function, and the inclusion of patients with a wide range of GFR and all types of kidney disease. Moreover, because only minor differences in complication thresholds were observed between mGFR and eGFR, particularly when eGFR was based on mass spectrometry–calibrated creatinine, their relevance for clinical practice is high. The study also has several limitations. First, it enrolled nephrologist-referred patients, who may not be representative of the overall population with CKD. The percentage of diabetic nephropathy in our study was low, 13%. This is likely to reflect a combination of low prevalence of the disease in the Paris area (18% of the prevalent ESRD population has diabetic nephropathy)42 and the later referral to nephrologists, commonly at stage 5, of patients with diabetes compared with other patients with CKD, as well as recruitment bias from university hospitals. This may result in underestimating the prevalence of anemia, given its link with diabetic kidney disease. Moreover, patients at stage 1 CKD were excluded from this cohort, so we could not evaluate anemia and hyperparathyroidism at this earliest CKD stage. Nonetheless, an advantage of clinical over population-based studies is that the former consider individuals with confirmed CKD. When CKD is defined only as an eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or microalbuminuria, as in NHANES III,11,12,20 the presence of clinical CKD is uncertain for a large proportion of individuals.\n\nSecond, this cross-sectional analysis of the cohort baseline data cannot expressly demonstrate cause-and-effect relations between the clinical factors and the metabolic disorders. Finally, despite the large sample size, we may have lacked power for the study of some associations; therefore, some negative findings, such as that between tubulointerstitial nephritis and acidosis, should be interpreted with caution."
