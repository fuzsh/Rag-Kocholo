        "text": "We were fortunate during World War II to attend Laurence Olivier's never‐to‐beforgotten, electrifying performances at the New Theatre in London (“Talking with Olivier” by Curtis Bill Pepper, March 25). When the Old Vic Repertory came to New York, we were again in the audience to be mesmerized.\n\nAs his illnesses became known, I wondered how we might retain the magic that is Laurence Olivier. One way might be for him to expand the too few recordings (many of which have been dropped from the catalogues) of his most famous roles. We could then continue to enrich our lives with the timbre of voice, the inimitable diction and phrasing, the range and caliber of his acting. And think what such recordings would mean to aspiring dramatic talent.\n\nLEYLA SEFA\n\nNew York City\n\nTriumphant Stroke Victim\n\nI think it is wonderful that Chester Vogel experienced such outstanding recovery from his stroke (“A Family Works a Miracle” by D. H. Mechem, March 11). However, I hope that families of other stroke victims do not suffer unnecessary guilt and undue frustration when their aphasic and/or paralyzed family members do not demonstrate complete recovery despite never‐waning love and herculean efforts.\n\nAs a speech‐language pathologist at New York's Montefiore Hospital, I have worked closely with numerous aphasic stroke patients. It is the rare patient who recovers completely from a massive stroke. In addition, the surgical intervention that helped to restore arrested blood flow in Chester Vogel's brain is not a feasibility for all stroke victims. Many of us are thankful for the small gains which make the lives of aphasic patients, as well as their families, a little bit easier.\n\nKARIN S. RIORDAN\n\nOssining, N. Y.\n\nReaders of your article will be pleased to know that considerable progress is being made in the detection of extracranial carotid lesions before tragedy strikes. Indeed, many hospitals are acquiring equipment for noninvasive detection. Utilization of this new technology, coupled with increasing awareness, will make possible the early diagnosis and timely treatment that are so essential for reduction of disability and death. Significant advance in the fight against stroke depends upon prevention well rehabilitation.\n\nJ. E. KREMEN, M.D.\n\nBaltimore\n\nIf I can offer any advice to stroke victims, it is this: Search until you find the therapist who believes as much as you do that recovery is possible, and then cherish her or him as you would your most precious possession.\n\nWe were advised that my husband would never speak again after his stroke. Instead of accepting that prognosis, we continued to search for the “miracle worker” who would confirm Herb's faith in himself. Two years later we found the speech and hearing department of Herbert H. Lehman College, where my husband made his “recovery.” Though he still has great difficulty writing and cannot read more than a short passage at a time, he has regained 90 percent of his verbal ability.\n\nMAXINE MARC\n\nNew York City\n\nMy mother had a massive stroke and “lived” for four years and six days afterward. She heard well, but could not walk, read or talk and had blurred vision. One Christmastime she became so depressed she gave up all food and drink. She died seven weeks later, mercifully delivered from what has to be the most awful caged hell imaginable. I now wonder if the archarteriogram mentioned in your article might have helped her. We were totally unaware of the procedure at the time.\n\nHARROLD DE GROFF\n\nFarmington, Conn.\n\nDuring a time of crisis, how magnificent it is when a family joins together for the welfare of the stricken one. Bravo to you, D. H. Melhem, and to your children!\n\nJUDITH FINESMITH\n\nDix Hills, N.Y.\n\nYour story on the Vogel family's miracle really hit home. My family has been trying, unsuccessfully, to perform a similar miracle for the past six years.\n\nMy father was performing on the highest levels of his profession when he was critically injured in a motorbike accident. Although he made a remarkable physical comeback, he felt psychologically defeated, knowing he might possibly not regain his former level of professionalism. Thirty‐three doctors and therapists later, an emotionally broken family has had to give up. Mr. Vogel accepted all the help that his family provided; my father adamantly refused the same. What a difference a personality makes.\n\nJANET R. GOLDSCHMIDT\n\nMaiverne, N.Y.\n\nThe Ethics of Photojournalism\n\nHurray for Bruce Davidson! (“A Photographer's Life: Selected Frames” March 11.) What an inspiration for anyone in our profession: a photojournalist who invades people's lives but refuses to take the picture and run. He uses a camera not only to discover something inside himself but to establish an emotional relationship with his subjects. Indeed, he returns to his subjects in order not to lose “the drama of hope and sympathy” that they gave him. Bruce Davidson's ethics, combined with his artistic achievements, certainly refute Susan Sontag's deadly aim at our profession in “On Photography”: “To photograph people is to violate them.... Just as the camera is a sublimation of the gun, to photograph someone is a sublimated murder — a soft murder, appropriate to a sad,\n\nHELEN MILJAKOVICH\n\nNew York City\n\nRetro Fashions With a Flair\n\nBecause I am only 81 years old,\n\nI permit myself to be quite bold\n\nAnd offer you a poetic critique\n\nOn your presentation of fashions unique.\n\nThere's not a single one for me"
