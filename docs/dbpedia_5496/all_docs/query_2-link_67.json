But speaking in 1954, the actress complained about 'drawbacks' to the inner city cottage.\n\nShe said: 'It is in London and we’ve furnished it for our life here. It has a lot of drawbacks.\n\nHistory: The former coachman's cottage was built in 1850 and bought by Sir Laurence for him and his lover to live in while they worked together for the first time\n\n'Nobody visiting it would ever dream it could be inconvenient or that those ‘fascinating’ stairs winding around, with the landing forming a balcony in the drawing-room, could be a nuisance.\n\n'Several years ago we built on the dining-room. Before that we used to eat in the entrance hall - you can imagine the drawbacks to that.'\n\nSir Laurence and Vivien Olivier began an affair at the height of their careers, while married to other people.\n\nAfter initially concealing their relationship, they eventually split from their spouses and married in Santa Barbara, California, in 1940.\n\nLaurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh began an affair at the height of their careers, while married to other people.
