        "text": "Hmmm, maybe that title should read “Famous People Who Died from Kidney Disease.” Let’s go back a bit to see what I’m talking about. By now you know my youngest married on the 6th of this month. Thank you to everyone who sent their best wishes. She and her husband did a wonderful job of creating the wedding they wanted, just as the new Mr. & Mrs. Nielson are doing a terrific job of creating the life they want together.\n\nOf course, her sister came out from New York to join the festivities. As usual, she stayed with Bear and me. That gave us plenty of time to gab between the pre-wedding potluck at my house and all the preparations for the wedding. At one point, I casually mentioned to her that Jean Harlow died of kidney disease. That fascinated Nima for some reason. As I explained the how and why, she asked me why I hadn’t yet written a blog about famous people who died from kidney disease.\n\nAt first, I thought it a bit macabre but then I rethought that. My new thinking ran along the line of, “What a perfect blog for Halloween week.” By the way, that’s my brother’s birthday and there is nothing spooky about him. Oh, our preconceptions.\n\nBack to Jean Harlow. For those of you who don’t know, she was not only an American film actress during the 1930s, but a sex symbol as well.\n\nThis is from the official Jean Harlow website at https://www.jeanharlow.com/about/biography/\n\n“While filming Saratoga in 1937, Jean was hospitalized with uremic poisoning and kidney failure, a result of the scarlet fever she had suffered during childhood. In the days before dialysis and kidney transplants, nothing could be done and Jean died on June 7, 1937.”\n\nA couple of reminders:\n\nUremic poisoning is what we now call uremia. This type of poisoning happens when the kidneys can’t filter your blood.\n\nKidney failure means your kidneys don’t work anymore. One of their jobs is to filter urea from your blood so that it doesn’t build up resulting in uremia.\n\nAs for the scarlet fever, “In general, appropriately diagnosed and treated scarlet fever results in few if any long-term effects. However, if complications develop for whatever reason, problems that include kidney damage, hepatitis, vasculitis, septicemia, congestive heart failure, and even death may occur.“ (Courtesy of MedicineNet at https://www.medicinenet.com/scarlet_fever_scarlatina/article.htm)\n\nDialysis was invented in 1943 by Dr. Willem Kolff. It wasn’t until the 1950s before it was perfected, but for Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) only. To make matters worse, few machines were available. Dr. Belding Scribner then developed a shunt to make dialysis effective for End Stage Renal Disease patients. In other words, not only those with short term kidney injuries, but also those whose kidneys were shutting down permanently. It wasn’t until 1962 that he opened the first outpatient dialysis unit. Later on, he developed the portable dialysis machines.\n\nKeep those years in mind. Keep in mind also that there was no dialysis or transplantation when these people died of kidney disease.\n\nYou may remember the blog I wrote about the Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. He died of kidney failure back in 1792… way before dialysis or transplantation.\n\nTransplantation? You’re right; I haven’t defined it yet. You cannot live without a functioning kidney unless you are on dialysis OR a new kidney – either from a cadaver or a life donor – is placed in your body. It is not a cure for kidney failure, but a treatment. Transplantees take anti-rejection medications for the rest of their lives.\n\nHave you heard of Sarah Bernhardt? She was a French stage actress who died of kidney disease in 1923. She’d also been a silent screen actress, but reportedly didn’t care for film acting. Notice the year.\n\nEmily Dickinson, the celebrated American poet died of Bright’s disease in 1886. (She was still alive during Portal of Time. I wonder if Jesse read her work?) Oh, you forgot what Bright’s disease is? No problem. New-Medical Net at https://www.news-medical.net/health/Brights-Disease-Kidney-Disease.aspx tells us it is “… a historical term that is not currently in use. It referred to a group of kidney diseases – in modern medicine, the condition is described as acute or chronic nephritis.”\n\nIt would make sense to define nephritis now. The suffix “itis” means inflammation of and “neph” refers to the kidneys. So, nephritis is an inflammation of the kidneys and can be due to a number of causes.\n\nLet’s not forget the great Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw. He moved to London at 20 years old and became a critic and political activist as well. You’ve heard of the play ‘My Fair Lady’? It was based on his ‘Pygmalion’. He died of kidney disease just before he might have been saved… in 1950.\n\nI think the one who surprised me the most was Buffalo Bill Cody. He was not just the leader of his wild West show, but also a bison hunter, scout (as in finding the way for wagon trains), gold rush participant, possibly a Pony Express rider, and actor. He died in 1917 of kidney failure.\n\nOther famous people who have died of kidney disease include Art Tatum, Color Porter, Douglas MacArthur, Alex Karras, Manute Bol, Ernest Borgnine, Don DeLuise, Art Buchwald, Norman Mailer, Sandra Dee, Barry White, Erma Bombeck, Marlene Dietrich, and Laurence Olivier.\n\nThis blog is not meant to scare the wits out of you. Well, maybe it is in a way. Famous people from all walks of life – athletes, writers, actors, musicians, singers, military members, and others – have died of kidney disease. Many before the invention of dialysis and transplantation. Some of kidney disease in combination of other diseases. And some because they didn’t know they had kidney disease.\n\nMy point? If you belong to any of the high risk groups for kidney disease, get yourself tested. We’re talking simple blood and urine tests here. The high risk groups are “diabetes, hypertension and a family history of kidney disease. African Americans, Hispanics, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans and Seniors.” Thank you to the National Kidney Center at http://www.nationalkidneycenter.org/chronic-kidney-disease/risk-factors/ for this list.\n\nUntil next week,\n\nKeep living your life!\n\nSome people think SlowItDownCKD is a business; it’s not. Some think it’s a profit maker; it’s not. So, what is it you ask? It’s a vehicle for spreading awareness of Chronic Kidney Disease and whatever goes along with the disease. Why do I do it? Because I had no idea what it was, nor how I might have prevented the disease, nor how to deal with it effectively once I was diagnosed.\n\nAt that time I was a college instructor. My favorite course to teach was Research Writing. I was also a writer with an Academic Certificate in Creative Non-Fiction and a bunch of publications under my belt. It occurred to me that I couldn’t be the only one who had no clue what this new-to-me disease was and how to handle living with it. I knew how to research and I knew how to write, so why not share what I learned?\n\nI wasn’t sure of what had to be done to share or how to do it. I learned by trial and error. People were so kind in teaching me, pointing out what might work better, even suggesting others that might be interested in what I was doing. I love people.\n\nFirst came the books. I’d written quite a few how to(s), study guides, articles, and literary guides so the writing was not new to me. I asked for suggestions as to what to do with my writing and that’s when I learned about unscrupulous, price gouging vanity publishers. I’m still paying for that mistake with my first book What Is It and How Did I Get It? Early Stage Chronic Kidney Disease, but it was a learning experience.\n\nYou already know the blog was born of necessity when an Indian doctor explained to me that he wanted his new patients to read What Is It and How Did I Early It? Early Stage Chronic Kidney Disease, but they couldn’t even afford the bus fare to the clinic. That’s when I got the bright idea of blogging a chapter a week so he could translate and print the blog post, and then the patients that did make it to the clinic could bring the blog back to their villages for others to read.\n\nIt would work! But first I had to teach myself how to blog. I made some boo-boos and lost a bunch of blogs until I got it figured out. So why do I keep blogging? There always seems to be more to share about CKD. Each week, I wonder what I’ll write… and the ideas keep coming.\n\nThen my New York daughter, Nima, started teaching me about social media. What???? You could post whatever you wanted to? And Facebook wasn’t the only way to reach the public at large? Hello LinkedIn. A friend who is a professional photographer asked me why I wasn’t using my fun photography habit to promote awareness. What??? You could do that? Hello Instagram. My step-daughters love Pinterest. That got me to thinking…. Then someone I met at a conference casually mentioned she offers Twitter workshops. What kind of workshops? She showed me how to use Twitter to raise CKD awareness.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed back in 2008, there weren’t that many reader friendly books on anything having to do with CKD. Since then, more and more books on the subject have been published. I’m laughing along with you, but I don’t mean just SlowItDownCKD 2011, SlowItDownCKD 2012 (These two were The Book of Blogs: Moderate Stage Chronic Kidney Disease, Part 1, until I realized how unwieldy both the book and the title were – another learning experience), SlowItDownCKD 2013, SlowItDownCKD 2014 (These two were formerly The Book of Blogs: Moderate Stage Chronic Kidney Disease, Part 2), SlowItDownCKD 2015, SlowItDownCKD 2016, and SlowItDownCKD 2017. By the way, I’m already working on SlowItDownCKD 2018. Each book contains the blogs for that year.\n\nHave you read the guest blogs or book review blogs to get a taste of what’s available now? Last week, Suzanne Ruff guest blogged. She wrote The Reluctant Donor, which I just wrote a review for on Amazon. Her guest blog explains what her book is about. Don’t forget Dr. Mandip S. Kang’s book, The Doctor’s Kidney Diets which also contains so much non-dietary information that we as CKD patients need to know. Another very helpful book is Drs. Raymond R. Townsend and Debbie L. Cohen’s 100 Questions & Answers About Kidney Disease and Hypertension. Neuropharmacologist Dr. Walter Hunt wrote Kidney Disease: A Guide for Living. Renal Dietitian Nina Kolbe wrote from her perspective: 10 Step Diet & Lifestyle Plan for Healthier Kidneys. Dr. Mackenzie Walser wrote Coping with Kidney Disease: A 12 – Step Treatment Program to Help You Avoid Dialysis. I also just wrote an Amazon review for Who Lives, Who Dies With Kidney Disease by Drs. Mohammad Akmal and Vasundhara Raghavan.\n\nWhile I may or may not agree with all or part of the information in these books, they have either been mentioned, reviewed, or guest blogged on SlowItDownCKD because I want you to be aware of whatever help may be available to you.\n\nThat, of course, brings us to the Facebook support groups. I miss my New York daughter and she misses me, so we sometimes have coffee together separately. She has a cup of coffee and I do at the same time. It’s not like being together in person, but it’s something. You can find support the same way via Facebook. Since I’m both running out of room and have periodically reviewed these groups, I’m just going to list a few. You can use the search bar at the top of your Facebook page for others.\n\nKidney Disease, Dialysis, and Transplant\n\nThe Transplant Community Outreach\n\nP2P\n\nKidney Disease Ideas and Diets1\n\nPeople on Dialysis\n\nChronic Kidney Disease in India\n\nFriends Sharing Positive Chronic Kidney Disease\n\nChronic Kidney Disease Awareness\n\nCKD (Kidney Failure) Support Group International\n\nKidney Warriors Foundation\n\nKidney Disease is not a Joke\n\nKidney Disease Diet Ideas and Help\n\nSharing your Kidney Journey\n\nMani Trust\n\nDialysis & Kidney Disease\n\nKidneys and Vets\n\nWomen’s Renal Failure\n\nI Hate Dialysis\n\nMark’s Private Kidney Disease Group\n\nUK Kidney Support\n\nWrap Up Warm for Kidney Disease\n\nStage 3 ‘n 4 Kidneybeaners Gathering Place\n\nUntil next week,\n\nKeep living your life!\n\nI’m pretty sure I’ve mentioned the exceedingly personable folks I met at the kidney disease think tank and then the AAKP National Patient Meeting earlier this year. Actually, you’ve already heard from one from them. This past July, Cindy Guentert-Baldo guest blogged about being a PKD patient. Today’s guest blog by Suzanne F. Ruff looks at the other side of same kidney disease. Ms. Ruff is no stranger to spreading awareness of kidney disease as you can see by her credentials:\n\nauthor of The Reluctant Donor\n\nFreelance writer for The Charlotte Observer\n\nExecutive Board of Directors American Association of Kidney Patients (AAKP)\n\nLiving Donor Council of The National Kidney Foundation (NKF)\n\nPublished in Chicken Soup for the Soul: Grieving & Recovery & Say Hello to A Better Body\n\nBefore you start reading Suzanne’s guest blog, I feel it only fair to warn you it left me in tears.\n\nWhy am I called The Reluctant Donor? A simple answer is because I cried and whined all the way into the operating room to donate a kidney to my sister. But it’s really not simple. It’s complicated.\n\nI really didn’t like my sister. Okay, okay, I know. If you have a sibling, you probably know what I’m talking about . . . siblings can drive you crazy. If you don’t have a sibling, well, it’s complicated. That’s part of the reason I titled my book, The Reluctant Donor, but not quite the whole reason.\n\nOn my journey to become a living kidney donor to a sister I didn’t like, I learned a lot of things. Probably the most important thing is that although I may not have liked my sister, I discovered how much I love her. When I didn’t like her, it was because she was crabby grouchy and scared. I learned something from that, too. My sister was crabby and grouchy because she was ill…very, very ill. That’s what happens when you don’t feel well, when your kidneys fail, and when you’re scared, terrified and afraid: you are not yourself.\n\nI also learned denial is a powerful thing. My sister was in denial. Kidney disease does that to you; my sister and I should know. We were born into a family chockful of people with kidney disease. Polycystic kidney disease or ADPKD (Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease) to be exact. This is a hereditary disease that causes cysts to grow around both kidneys causing the kidneys to fail. If one of your parents carries the gene (our mother did), you have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. My sister, along with my other sister, inherited that gene from our mother. Our mother, along with Mom’s two brothers and two sisters, inherited that gene from their mother.\n\nYes, sirreee, we were chockful of kidney disease. Over twenty-three family members now have or had the disease. We’ve had ten deaths from kidney disease, including our mother.\n\nI did not inherit the gene that causes the disease. Many people ask me if I feel guilty, sort of like survivor’s guilt, because my sisters have the disease and I don’t. I don’t feel guilty. A person has no power over what genes they inherit. But, I do feel a tremendous responsibility to do what I can to eradicate the disease that has ravaged my family. So, I wrote my book.\n\nThere is no cure for PKD. Growing up I learned I was named after my grandmother who died of polycystic kidney disease before I was born. When her kidneys failed, the doctors told her there was nothing the doctors could do for her. Mom described my grandmother’s death: Mom, a teenager then, her father, her brothers and sisters were gathered around my grandmother’s hospital bed, when my grandmother sat straight up and said, “Here I am, Lord!” and died.\n\nThe disease then hit five of my grandmother’s six children, including my mother. Through their suffering and deaths, I have learned courage and faith. One of my aunts diagnosed with PKD in the 1960’s was one of the first to be able to try the new-fangled machine called dialysis. But, alas! There were not enough dialysis machines!!!!! My aunt was a Roman Catholic nun. She offered to give up her spot on the waiting list and died a few months later. She was 45 years old.\n\nPresently, my three cousins, all brothers, suffer from polycystic kidney disease. Their eldest brother, John, passed away from polycystic kidney disease (PKD) in 1996. Two of the three brothers are on dialysis and the other brother will need dialysis soon. Their sister has offered to be a living donor to one of them, but each of them insists the other brother accept her kidney. A stalemate … as the disease progresses.\n\nI have other stories about my magnificent family, but this blog is near its end. You might even say none of this explains why I cried, kicked and screamed my way into the operating room to donate one of my kidneys to my sister.\n\nPlain and simple: I was afraid. I don’t like hospitals. I hate them. Growing up, the people I loved most died in hospitals. I don’t like needles. I don’t like blood. I was afraid I would die, afraid the surgery wouldn’t be a success, afraid my life would change because I donated. I was always afraid of polycystic kidney disease as one by one, people I loved suffered and died.\n\nSomething happened to me, though, when my sister collapsed in kidney failure. My faith kicked in and I stepped up. We are blessed. The surgery was a success. My sister is now a grandmother. Life is so precious!\n\nHaving gained both another son-in-law and my first grandchild this year, I can only agree with Suzanne… and life was precious for me before. I’m reading her book now and enjoying it. Should you decide to read Suzanne’s book (and any and all of mine), be sure to leave a review. Those are what get our books recognized… and in Suzanne and my cases, spreads awareness of kidney disease.\n\nUntil next week,\n\nKeep living your life!\n\nI’ve had so many questions lately about how clinical trials work that when Antidote asked me if I’d consider including their infograph in a blog, I jumped at the chance. There’s even more information about clinical trials at https://www.antidote.me/what-are-clinical-trial-phases.\n\nI’ve written about Antidote before… and I’ve written about clinical trials before. It seems more and more people are becoming interested in the process for a multitude of diseases, not only Chronic Kidney Disease.\n\nAs a newly diagnosed diabetes patient, I’ve noticed clinical trials for diabetes. A family member has Alzheimer’s; his neurologist keeps an eye out for clinical trials for him. Whatever your disease is, you can search for clinical trials.\n\nWhile this is not everyone’s cup of tea, it is a chance to help others who may develop the same diseases in the future. Who knows, maybe the new treatment will be FDA approved during your own lifetime and help you with your own disease.\n\nIn case you are one of those people who have always wondered just what the FDA is, their website is https://www.fda.gov. That’s right: it’s a government site which is part of the U.S. Health and Human Services. What’s that? You’d like a more precise definition?\n\nNo problem. This is from the United States of American Government website at https://www.usa.gov/federal-agencies/food-and-drug-administration and offers basic information about the FDA.\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation. The FDA also provides accurate, science-based health information to the public.\n\nAgency Details\n\nAcronym: FDA\n\nWebsite: Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\n\nContact: Contact the Food and Drug Administration\n\nReport a Problem with a Product\n\nMain Address: 10903 New Hampshire Ave.\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993\n\nToll Free: 1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332)\n\nForms: Food and Drug Administration Forms\n\nGovernment branch: Executive Department Sub-Office/Agency/Bureau\n\nBy the way, they are also responsible for both recalls and safety alerts for the treatments they’ve approved.\n\nIn the infograph above, you’ll notice, “Sometimes, only healthy volunteers participate.” in Phase 1. Should you decide to apply for a clinical trial, you need to keep this in mind to save yourself a bit of heartache. I firmly believe in paying back for the wonderful things in my life and have applied for several clinical trials for other diseases in an effort to do so. I must have missed the small print because I was rejected for having CKD.\n\nI wanted to help eradicate or ameliorate whatever the disease was. Sometimes it was a disease that was ravaging a loved one. It was just a little bit of a heartbreak not to be able to do so.\n\nAs for Phase 2, I went to the blog’s site at gailraegarwood.wordpress.com to use the antidote widget at the bottom of the right side of the page. It’s the turquoise one. You can’t miss it. Face Palm! You can also go directly to www.antidote.me to search for clinical trials.\n\nWhy Antidote? It’s simply an easier way to find a clinical trial. This is from SlowItDownCKD 2017:\n\n“Antidote Match™\n\nMatching patients to trials in a completely new way\n\nAntidote Match is the world’s smartest clinical trial matching tool, allowing patients to match to trials just by answering a few questions about their health.\n\nPutting technology to work\n\nWe have taken on the massive job of structuring all publicly available clinical trial eligibility criteria so that it is machine-readable and searchable.\n\nThis means that for the first time, through a machine-learning algorithm that dynamically selects questions, patients can answer just a few questions to search through thousands of trials within a given therapeutic area in seconds and find one that’s right for them.\n\nPatients receive trial information that is specific to their condition with clear contact information to get in touch with researchers.\n\nReaching patients where they are\n\nEven the smartest search tool is only as good as the number of people who use it, so we’ve made our search tool available free of charge to patient communities, advocacy groups, and health portals. We’re proud to power clinical trial search on more than a hundred of these sites, reaching millions of patients per month where they are already looking for health information.\n\nTranslating scientific jargon\n\nOur platform pulls information on all the trials listed on clinicaltrials.gov and presents it into a simple, patient-friendly design.\n\nYou (Gail here: this point is addressed to the ones conducting the clinical trial) then have the option to augment that content through our free tool, Antidote Bridge™, to include the details that are most important to patients – things like number of overnights, compensation, and procedures used. This additional information helps close the information gap between patients and researchers, which ultimately yields greater engagement with patients.\n\nHere’s how Antidote Match works\n\n1. Visit search engine → Patients visit either our website or one of the sites that host our search.\n\n2. Enter condition → They enter the condition in which they’re interested, and begin answering the questions as they appear\n\n3. Answer questions → As more questions are answered, the number of clinical trial matches reduces\n\n4. Get in touch: When they’re ready, patients review their matches and can get in touch with the researchers running each study directly through our tool\n\nTry it from the blog roll. I did. I was going to include my results, but realized they wouldn’t be helpful since my address, age, sex, diseases, and conditions may be different from everyone else’s. One caveat: search for Chronic Renal Insufficiency or Chronic Renal Failure (whichever applies to you) rather than Chronic Kidney Disease.”\n\nBefore I sign off, this came in from the American Association of Kidney Patients:\n\nPlease join us on Tuesday, October 9, 2018 at 1 p.m. ET for an educational webinar on Making the Perfect Team: Working with Your Dialysis Technician in partnership with National Association of Nephrology Technicians/Technologists (NANT). Keep in mind that’s tomorrow.

I’m writing for pre-menopausal women…and for anyone who wants to know what menstrual cycles have to do with Chronic Kidney Disease. I’m one of those who wants to know.\n\nI was already in my sixties when I was diagnosed with CKD, but I have many woman readers who have not yet reached that rite of passage known as menopause. Does their menses have any effect on their CKD, I wondered? Or, conversely, does their CKD have any effect on their menses?\n\nBack to the beginning for those who have just plain forgotten what the menses is and why women experience it. Thank you to the Medical Dictionary at https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/menses for starting us off today. Menses is:\n\n“the periodic discharge from the vagina of blood and tissues from a non-pregnant uterus; the culmination of the menstrual cycle. Menstruation occurs every 28 days or so between puberty and menopause, except during pregnancy, and the flow lasts about 5 days, the times varying from woman to woman.”\n\nI clearly remember the days of anxiously awaiting my period only to find I had miscalculated its start. Commence the washing-out-the-underwear-nightly-during-my-period era which lasted decades. It was messy, but apparently menstruation was necessary. Why? you ask.\n\nBack to Wikipedia. By the way, when I was teaching research writing in college, I always found this a good source to start researching from despite the fact that anyone can edit it. This is the explanation I was looking for. I found it at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle.\n\n“The menstrual cycle is the regular natural change that occurs in the female reproductive system (specifically the uterus and ovaries) that makes pregnancy possible. The cycle is required for the production of oocytes [Me here: this means an immature egg] and for the preparation of the uterus for pregnancy….”\n\nAs someone who had always planned to be a mother, you can see why I felt this was a necessary – albeit messy – function of my body. I have a biological grandchild and another being planned. Thank you, menstruation.\n\nBut what if I had developed CKD when I was premenopausal? Would things have been different for me? DaVita at https://www.davita.com/education/kidney-disease/risk-factors/womens-health-risks-and-chronic-kidney-disease-ckd explains some of what I might have had to deal with.\n\n“When a woman has chronic kidney disease her periods tend to be irregular. Once she begins dialysis her periods may even stop altogether. As kidney function drops below 20 percent of normal, a woman is less likely to conceive because dialysis doesn’t perform all of the tasks of the kidneys. The body retains a higher level of waste products than it would with a normal kidney, which can prevent egg production and affect menstruation.\n\nErythropoietin treatments will cause about 50 percent of woman on dialysis to get their periods again. This is attributed to the improved hormone levels and the treatment of anemia. Therefore, erythropoietin treatments can increase a woman’s fertility, so birth control should be used if a woman is sexually active and does not want to become pregnant.”\n\nOkay, but I’m not on dialysis and my GFR hovers in the 50-55% range. I see from the quote above that my periods might have become irregular. I also noted that a ‘higher level of waste products is being retained.” (Why does that give me the creeps?)\n\nLet’s go back to those waste products. Remember what they are? Shodor, a site for undergraduate students, at https://www.shodor.org/master/biomed/physio/dialysis/kidney.htm was helpful here:\n\n“The kidneys are the filtering devices of blood. The kidneys remove waste products from metabolism such as urea, uric acid, and creatinine by producing and secreting urine. Urine may also contain sulfate and phenol waste and excess sodium, potassium, and chloride ions. The kidneys help maintain homeostasis by regulating the concentration and volume of body fluids. For example, the amount of H+ and HCO3 – secreted by the kidneys controls the body’s pH.”\n\nWhoa! I wouldn’t want even more of these substances in my body. Not only would they make the CKD worse, but also its effects on my body. According to Medical News Today at https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/172179.php, these effects include:\n\nanemia\n\nblood in urine\n\ndark urine\n\ndecreased mental alertness\n\ndecreased urine output\n\nedema – swollen feet, hands, and ankles (face if edema is severe)\n\nfatigue (tiredness)\n\nhypertension (high blood pressure)\n\ninsomnia\n\nitchy skin, can become persistent\n\nloss of appetite\n\nmale inability to get or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction)\n\nmore frequent urination, especially at night\n\nmuscle cramps\n\nmuscle twitches\n\nnausea\n\npain on the side or mid to lower back\n\npanting (shortness of breath)\n\nprotein in urine\n\nsudden change in bodyweight\n\nunexplained headaches\n\nIs there anything else I should know?\n\nThe Huffington Post at https://www.huffingtonpost.com/leslie-spry-md-facp/women-with-chronic-kidney_b_10163148.html let Dr. Leslie Spry, Spokesman for the National Kidney Foundation, answer this one and I will, too.\n\n“Women with CKD have been shown to commonly experience menstrual irregularities. This can include excessive bleeding, missed periods, and early onset of menopause. In studies of patients with CKD, women enter menopause from 3 to 5 years earlier than patients without CKD. Treatment can be very challenging. Studies of estrogen replacement therapy have shown an increased risk of heart disease and blood clotting disorders. Kidney transplantation will usually correct these abnormalities.”\n\nNow I wonder if I’d had CKD even earlier than when I’d caught it on a lab report a decade ago. Excessive bleeding? Check. Early menopause? Check. Hmmm.\n\nBut wait. There’s some good news in here, too.\n\n“’Thus, recurring changes of sex hormone levels, as brought about by the natural menstrual cycle, might be involved in periodic tissue remodeling not only in reproductive organs, but to a certain extent in the kidneys as well,’ she added.\n\nLechner [Me here: She’s the study author – Dr. Judith Lechner, of the Medical University of Innsbruck in Austria] hypothesizes that estrogen might help to replace damaged cells. During cycle phases of high estrogen exposure, kidney cells might be induced to grow, she explained, ‘while at time points of decreasing estrogen levels damaged or simply older cells might be discarded into the urine.’”\n\nYou can read more about this small study published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology in Medical Daily at https://www.medicaldaily.com/sex-differences-menstrual-cycle-kidney-failure-384251.\n\nNow I know… and so do you. Younger women, your CKD menstrual future may not be as dismal as you’d thought.\n\nUntil next week,\n\nKeep living your life!"
