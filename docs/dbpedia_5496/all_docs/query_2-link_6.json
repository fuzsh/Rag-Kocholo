        "text": "Our greatest actor, in an unusually frank three‐day interview, discusses acting, why he left Vivien Lei! h and his will to survive.\n\nLaurence Olivier was in his dressing room in London, applying the elaborate makeup required for Richard III, when the gift box arrived — apparently long‐stemmed flowers. Opening it, he found a sword inscribed: “This sword, given him by his mother Kate Terry Gielgud, 1938, is given to Laurence Olivier by his friend John Gielgud in appreciation of his performance of Richard III at the New Theater, 1944.”\n\nOlivier was stunnned, for the sword in the box was one of the most famous in England. had belonged to the immortal Edmund Kean who had used it when playing the role of Richard III. It had then passed on to the great Henry Irving the first night he played Richard. Finally, Gielgud had been given it when he played the part. In relinquishing it to Olivier, Gielgud paid homage to Olivier's brilliant performance which, for many critics, had dethroned Gielgud from a 15‐year rule of England's stage.\n\nIt was an immortal symbol, created by a successive line of immortal names. And now, 35 years later, to whom did Olivier plan to pass the noble sword?\n\n“No one. It's mine,” he said.\n\nNo performer of Shakespeare's plays has achieved the global fame of Sir Laurence Olivier. On stage, he has been the most ambition‐haunted Macbeth, the most perfidious yet painfully human Shylock and the most primordial Othello. In films, his versions of “Henry V,” “Hamlet” and “Richard III” brought these classics to millions — millions who also remember Olivier as the brooding Heathcliff of “Wuthering Heights,” and the handsomely haughty Mr. Darcy in “Pride and Prejudice,” among other towering roles. Finally, he is the man who married Vivien Leigh, the unforgettable Scarlett O'Hara.\n\nOlivier, who will be 72 on May 22, has been acting for 54 years and is the first actor in English history to reach the House of Lords (although he prefers his lesser knighthood title of Sir Laurence to that of Lord Olivier). He is due for more honors soon. At the Academy Awards presentation in Hollywood on April 9, he will receive an honorary Oscar for his “lifelong contribution to the art of film” — to be placed alongside a 1946 Oscar for his film “Henry V,” and a best‐actor award two years later for “Hamlet.” He is now up for a fourth Academy Award for his role in “The Boys From Brazil.”\n\nSome artists have 10‐year spans of greatness — only to level off as the world moves on. Olivier, however, continues to grow while fighting off ills that would have vanquished lesser men —cancer, thrombosis, dermato‐myositis (a muscle‐wasting disease), an obstructed kidney, and, recently, pneumonia. As each of these ills has struck him, he has fought back with the rage and fury of a Shakespearean king.\n\nSeeking some clue as to how he has managed life at the top of his profession for so long, I went to see him in Venice, during the filming of “A Little Romance,” the forthcoming George Roy Hill film in which he stars. As it turned out, Olivier spoke most frankly, not just of the art of acting, but also of his loves, his guilts, of the escape provided him by acting, his traumatic separation from Vivien Leigh, why he continues to make films — and why he refuses to bow to advancing years and illness.\n\nInside a portal of St. Mark's Cathedral, the cameras were filming a young boy and girl running out of a door and down a short flight of steps. Olivier rushed out after them — but halted before taking the steps.\n\n“Cut!” cried director Hill.\n\nMoving slowly, Olivier descended the steps and sat in a chair with his legs up on another chair. The scene was then continued, beginning with Olivier's double leaping down the steps and running after the children. It did not please Olivier, however, for he called his double aside and, rising, laboriously went through the slow‐motion movements of running — spreading his legs widely to show what he wanted.\n\n“You can't just run,” he said. “You have to look as if you're running.”\n\nAs Hamlet, he had leaped 12 feet through the air to kill a king. As a dying Coriolanus, he had fallen in a backward somersault down a flight of stairs. As Othello, he had lowered his voice an octave to a baritone, and — moving with an animal's grace and power — with one arm effortlessly picked up the fallen Desdemona. Now he could only run in his head.\n\n“Larry's still weak from his last illness,” explained Hill. “We have a key scene with a bike, but he can't ride one. We had to have a special machine built for him.”\n\nOlivier, whose still dark hair had and been tinted gray for the film, came up for a polite “How do you do?” His eyes did not match the tone of his words. They are a strange gray‐green, which he described later as coming from a river bottom. Now they stared without blinking, like a shark's, primitive and threatening as though all human feeling had been anesthetized while the mind studied whatever dangers lay before it in this encounter. One sensed deep and violent emotions held in precarious balance: anger and love, sensuality and asceticism, and a driving need to create—or destroy.\n\nOlivier had once said of himself: “I'm not sure what I'm like and I'm not sure I want to know.” Nor did he want others to know: Friends found him open and intimate on stage, closed and unapproachable offstage. He hated interviews, of course, and, in agreeing to ours, had said it was to be the last major one of his life.\n\n“See you later,” he said, walking off arm in arm with an assistant director for lunch at his hotel.\n\nThat evening, we met in Olivier's suite in the Hotel Danieli. He had called earlier, saying it was “Larry,” and suggesting we have dinner together.\n\nHe pulled himself up from a divan as I walked in, and his eyes, now behind spectacles, seemed more friendly. We found some champagne in the refrigerator and sat before a window overlooking the Grand Canal. I asked if he knew what had started him off as an actor, what had driven him to the top. Moss Hart, the Broadway director and playwright, claimed he had never known an actor without an unhappy childhood. Was that true of Laurence Olivier?\n\n“Oh God, yes! There was no cruelty or unkindness, but I couldn't wait to get out. Ours was a genteel poverty, in some ways worse than real slum poverty. The idea of going on stage was heaven. And bless my father's heart, he stood behid me.”\n\nThe decision came when he was 16, on the day his brother, Richard, went to India to be a rubber planter.\n\n“I adored my brother and after he left I felt miserable and lonely — my mother had been dead for years. That evening, as usual, to save water, I got into my father's bath after he'd finished — I suppose that's where I got my mania for little economies. I asked him, ‘When can I follow Dickie out to India?’ He sat on the tub and said, ‘Don't be a fool — you're going to be an actor.’ “\n\nYoung Olivier was astonished, never suspecting that his father could read his heart, even though his inclination was plain from the age of 7, when Kim — as he was called then —converted an overturned wooden packing box into his first theater. He put up draw curtains and lit candles inside circular cigarette tins to serve as footlights.\n\nFor five generations, the Oliviers —originally French Huguenots — had sent their sons into the Church of England. Olivier's father, The Rev. Gerard Kerr Olivier, a strict High Anglican, was a dramatic preacher in the pulpit, but a remote figure at home. Still, young Olivier was touched by his father's intuition.\n\nIn that boyhood packing‐box theater, Olivier recalls, he began his dialogue with the world. He presented plays, created by himself, before an audience — or simply alone. It didn't matter. You were never really alone when you could pretend.\n\n“To pretend you're somebody else ... I suppose that's where it starts, the first impulse for acting.”\n\nHe carried the impulse along to a choir school attached to All Saints’ Church, London, and then to St. Edward's School, Oxford. At 10, he played Brutus, attracting the attention of the celebrated actress Ellen Terry, who wrote in her diary: “The small boy who played Brutus is already a great actor.”\n\nHe won a one‐year scholarship with the famous Elsie Fogerty at the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art. Then came a threeyear apprenticeship (1926‐28) with Barry Jackson's Birmingham Repertory Theater, learning all the great roles and meeting his lifelong friend, Ralph Richardson.\n\nAfter a brief, initial Hollywood stint, be returned to England and six flop plays in a year. Then Noel Coward picked him for “Private Lives,” and later John Gielgud took him on for “Romeo and Juliet,” in which Gielgud and Olivier alternately played Romeo and Mercutio. Gielgud's lyrical Romeo helped to make Olivier's earthy, Latin lover appear more real. Overnight, he became a name.\n\nAfter two years war service as a lieutenant in the Royal Fleet Air Arm, Olivier and Richardson reformed the famous Old Vic repertory company. There Olivier unexpectedly found himself committed to playing Richard III, which he did not want to do. The play had been produced with notable success 18 months before and he felt it was too soon to repeat it.\n\nNevertheless, he appeared in the role at the New Theater in London, 1944, limping slowly downstage, his misshapen body and hesitant walk projecting his innate sadomasochistic cruelty, ambition, and sardonic humor — finally to begin the famous soliloquy:\n\nNow is the winter of our discontent\n\nMade glorious summer by this sun of York...\n\nOlivier was not impressed by the first‐night cheers: “I'd had bravos many times before, and, as a rule, I don't take much notice of applause. I can't enjoy it . . . never have.”\n\nAt the following matinee, however, he sensed the audience's tremendous excitement. “For the first time in 19 years on stage, I felt it, this conjunction. I felt them saying ... “ — his voice sank to a whisper — “ ‘He's corning on!’ It went to my head and I became so conceited I didn't bother with the limp very much.”\n\nOlivier sees the great Shakespearean roles as “cannibals.” While playing Othello, he once described their consuming effect: “You give them all you've got and the author says to you: ‘You've given all you've got? Good. Now, more. Good. Now, more. More, damn you. More, more! More! More!’ Until your heart and guts and brain are pulp and the part feeds on you, eating you. Acting great parts devours you. It's a dangerous game.”\n\nHe no longer had enough in him to satisfy a cannibal role, but he wasn't giving that sword to anybody either. We refilled our glasses and I asked, “What makes one man a great actor, while another is excellent yet never great?”\n\nOlivier shook his head and glanced for a moment out onto the Grand Canal. “You must always have room for a truthful sizing up,” he said. “Once, when I was doing Oedipus, a friend of mine said, ‘You're a great actor,’ and I said, ‘No, I'm not, I know I'm not.’ He asked, ‘How do you know?’ I told him, ‘Because if I ever tried to put that belief into a performance, it would never be right.’”\n\nA great performance, Olivier indicated, often occurred without the actor being aware it was about to happen. The night before he opened in “Richard III,” he was up until A.M. in his hotel room, with Vivien Leigh and Garson ICanin feeding him his lines. “You are about to see the worst performance I've ever given,” he told a friend before going on stage. When the curtain fell, he was hailed as the greatest Shakespearean actor of his time.\n\nThe audience, Olivier believes, has its part in the acting process: “You have to feel and love not only your own role — or some element in it — but also feel and love the audience. Sounds sentimental, I'm afraid, but there you have it.”\n\nI reminded him that he had once said that an actor had to be a bit of a bastard to reach the top. Did that apply to him?\n\n“Oh! Infinitely worse than that!” he laughed. “No, I think I meant that you must have — besides intuition and sensitivity — also a cutting edge that allows you to reach what you need Also, you have to know human life, bastards included — and it takes a bit of one to know one, don't you think?”\n\nOlivier constructs a character by using selected traits, techniques, ideas, images. Assembled, they form the character in the round and this serves as a sort of shelter on stage. Then he moves inward.\n\n“There are two types of actors — external and internal,” he says. “Those who start from the inside are more likely to find themselves inside the parts they play. The others, the peripheral ones — like Alec Guinness and myself — start from the outside. They are more apt to find the part inside themselves. Those who start from the inside don't blossom until later and often the play is off before it happens.”\n\nIn creating a role, the actor — as with any artist — moves into unknown territory. In making that passage Olivier affirms, he must balance confidence and humility: “It's an impossible equation to keep in balance. If you go too far on one side, you make a fool of yourself; and going to the other, you give up and do nothing. When you're young, you're liable to go overboard. and you will do anything for attention.”\n\nAnd, I wondered, when one grew old? At 26, Michelangelo had confidently cut his great David from a near‐impossible block of marble. Yet in old age, he required many underpaintings to do his Vatican fresco of St. Paul. Was that a lack of confidence, too much humility — or was he looking for some greater truth?\n\n“Maybe,” replied Olivier, “he was just saying, ‘I don't like it yet.’ When you're 30 or 40, you have few limits. You can do Romeo or King Lear. When you're 60, you can't do Romeo without looking foolish, but you can still do Lear — better than before, because at 30 or so you can only imagine the situation. Your mind expands as your body shrinks and you adjust to it, giving in age what you couldn't give in youth.”\n\nIf the mind expands, sometimes memory shrinks — a lurking nightmare of all actors. This happened once to Olivier, but it was not a func tion of age. “I was playing lago to Ralph Richardson's Othello,” he recalls, 'and couldn't learn the lines. Ralph said, ‘My dear fellow, I'm afraid you'll have to give up sex for four or five days.’ I said, ‘What's that got to do with it?’ and he said, ‘Phosphates in the brain. You shot all yours and it's phosphates that retain the memory.’ Well, I did give it up and in four days learned the part!”\n\nAs he laughed, I was reminded of his gift for comedy. More than most actors, he had interrelated the comic and the tragic. He had drawn laughter while portraying such monsters as Titus Andronicus and Richard Ill. Had this contributed to his success?\n\n“It's frightfully important for the tragedian to be a comedian. Otherwise, he will be inhuman. I love comedy every bit as much as tragedy, perhaps more, because the whole scene of humanity is under its roof.”\n\nDame Sybil Thorndike, who had known Olivier since he played Brutus at 10, believed his capacity for tragedy was limited, due to his refusal to accept disaster in his own life, to laugh at it rather than allow it to penetrate the heart and mind.\n\n“It depends upon your sense of the tragic, doesn't it? For example, Archie Rice is a tragic figure,” he said, referring to the music‐hall comic in John Osborne's anti‐Establishment play “The Entertainer.” “Archie was an entertainer who also acted parts in his real life, which was unreal — making him even more real and tragic. The play was also a parable on the death of England. Beautifully written. Exact portrait of a man. He was a loathsome person, but I felt sorry for him ... very close. I said, ‘I know that creature, I know him better than he knows himself.’ “\n\nOsborne had said: “I suspect Olivier has a feeling sometimes of being a deeply hollow man. Not that he is hollow, but he knows what it is to feel hollow.”\n\n“Oh, Christ,” Olivier moaned. “The hollow feeling. And the guilt. Who doesn't have it'?”\n\n“So playing a role can be an escape from life?”\n\n“My God, yes! There've been times when I've been ‘most deject and wretched,’ as Ophelia puts it ... so absolutely miserable because my life has been an equal meting out of horror of what I'm going through and guilt for what I plan to go through. God, to find a remedy! And then to say, ‘Oh, thank Christ, for the next three hours I'll be Coriolanus, nothing like me, not one of my problems, nothing I can even attach myself to in any way at all. Or, if he hates himself as I hate myself, then we have a partnership.’ It can be a blessing to be an actor, really.”\n\n“How sad,” murmured Olivier, looking back into the black water. “Poor little dears.”\n\nThe dinner was pleasant, in an outdoor garden. Olivier and Hill exchanged theater stories. One turned on Olivier's conviction that lago had a homosexual love for Othello — this alone explaining his motivations. To demonstrate it forcefully to Ralph Richardson, playing Othello, Olivier during rehearsal kissed him full upon the lips. Startled, Richardson pulled back: “There, there, my dear boy Steady now ...”\n\nAnother story concerned Richard Burton's hating himself becuse he felt acting was a woman's work, not a man's. “I don't know why I go on with this bhxxly nonsense,” Burton once said to Olivier. “My dear boy,” replied Olivier. “Don't you know? If we didn't do it, we'd go mad.”\n\nI asked whether Burton's attitude might not be conditioned by something else: an androgynous quality which helped to structure all great acting. Michael Billington, in “The Modern Actor,” claimed no male actor made more creative, positive use of his femininity than Olivier.\n\n“Of course,” replied Olivier. “A man who is entirely masculine isn't really normal, is he? I'm not saying he has to be as queer as a three‐dollar bill. Ha! I mean if he hasn't a certain amount of absolute feminine in him — feminine, mind you, not femininity — I doubt he'd be very interesting.”\n\nOlivier spoke of how the stage actor, ulike the film actor, had to project an illusion of reality across 40 yards or more — and yet never appear to pull out all the stops. “If they see your limits,” he said, “they lose interest. Yvonne Printemps, that lovely lady, gave me some advice from the great basso, Chaliapin. ‘Darling, always take a breath when the audience doesn't expect it — never at the end of a phrase or a note.’ Best advice I ever got. It adds colossal power. The audience feels you have undying strength and can go on forever. If they sense you're tired, or fear for your physical self, you lose them.”\n\nIs it possible that Burton despises himself after having given up a great future on the stage for movie money? The question caused Hill to glance nervously at Olivier. Both were stage veterans now making films.\n\n“Thank God for the movies,” replied Olivier. “I can no longer be a stage actor, because I don't feel I've got the power ... the physical attributes that are absolutely necessary to be a very good, powerful, meaningful actor. So we have the movies, and I get a fortune for doing it, which is absolutely what I'm after because I've always overspent in my life and now I'd better get with it.\n\n“They criticize me in the papers. ‘Why's he doing such muck?’ I'll tell you why ... to pay for three children in school, for a family, and their future. So what should I do? Write the critics and ask them to support us? Would that satisfy them?”\n\nBack at the hotel, we said good night to the Hills, and took an elevator up toward our rooms. In the corridor, pausing to say good night, I said it had been a great evening.\n\n“The greatest heights in drama are always between two players,” Olivier said, with a smile. “And it's more common between two men than women, because women are more competitive.”\n\nI thought of Vivien Leigh and her drive to be her husband's equal on stage — until she fell away into mental illness. I asked him: “So it's dangerous to marry an actress?”\n\n“It's all right, at first,” he said. “As long as the man is master, it works. It begins to fail when the woman becomes a rival and wants to master the man. Then everything falls apart.'’\n\nIn my room, I thought of Vivien Leigh — the consuming love of Olivier's life — and of her decline into manic depression, their separation, and her death. Olivier is married now to Joan Plowright, mother of their three children — Richard, 17; Tamsin, 16; and Julie Kate, 12. (He has a son, Tarquin, by his first wife, the actiess Jill Esmond.) Joan Plowright is 22 years his junior. Olivier, commenting once on the kiss of his mother when he was 13, said: “I've been looking for her ever since and think I've found her in Joanie.”\n\nJoan Plowright is a brilliant actress but, unlike Vivien Leigh, she is not competitive with Olivier. They have seldom played opposite each other.\n\nClearly, Olivier's remark in the corridor had been a reference to Vivien Leigh's competition during their marriage. I looked through my notes and found a quote from director Peter Glenville: “Compared to ordinary men with ordinary ambitions, Larry was a sea monster. He thought about nothing but the great classical roles ... He wanted to appear with Vivien Leigh because he was very much in love with her. But his love was second ... to his obsession with acting.”\n\nIn appearing with the second love, Olivier sometimes hobbled the first, as critic Kenneth Tynan bore witness in reviewing the Olivier‐Leigh “Antony and Cleopatra': “Miss Leigh picks at her part with the daintiness of a debutante called upon to dismember a stage; and her manners are first‐rate. She plays it ... with her little finger crooked ... Sir Laurence gives the impression that he subdues his blow‐lamp ebullience to match her. Blunting his iron precision, leveling away his towering authority. he meets her halfway. Antony climbs down, and Cleopatra pats him on the head ...”\n\nDid this effect on his acting help end a legendary love story? She was his greatest love; he was, until the end of her life, her “beautiful, shining, brilliant darling Larry.” Yet he had left her, after 21 years, when she was 45, more than ever dependent upon him, bewildered by her mental illness, curiously childlike —wanting more than anything else for Larry to keep her and hold her, as she was.\n\nWhy? Somehow, it did not seem possible he had left her for his career. Not the man who looked into dark waters for dying fish.\n\nWe had lunch on the Giudecca, the island across the lagoon from St. Mark's. Sipping wine in the sunlight, Olivier finally spoke of Vivien Leigh and their parting.\n\n“You can reach a point,” he said, “where it's like a life raft that can hold only so many. You cast away the hand grasping it. You let it go. You do not take it on board beaause otherwise it's both of you. Two instead of one.\n\n“Then you go on living and there you are, with it, knowing what has happened, remembering its details. Yet what else is there to do?\n\n“Yes, it was more than my life. I was afraid of killing her. I nearly did once. She was slapping me across the face with wet flannels, striking me, until I went into my room and closed the door. She kept beating on the door, beating and beating until I couldn't take it any more. I came out and grabbed her and threw her across the room. She hit her head on the edge of the bed and it cut her just one inch below the temple. One inch higher and that would have done it.”\n\n“I knew then it had ended. If I went on, sooner or later it would go too far. I knew I had to get out. I knew I had to cut the hand away from the life raft ...”\n\nThey were words spoken quietly, revealing Olivier's compaccion and care, which many doubted. He had tried. The world would never know how it had been because he would never attempt to tell it all.\n\n“It was like that with Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe, but I think his error was to put it into a play. That was unjust, and unkind.”\n\nLove had brought him great joy in life, yet also great suffering. He had pursued it too ardently.\n\n“I've always been too romantic — constantly, absolutely, incurably. I've looked for it too much and been made extremely miserable by it, usually.”\n\nHe spoke then of his illnesses, beginning with the first, cancer of the prostate.\n\n“It was quite easy, the cancer. I literally said, ‘Oh, bug off. You're not gonna get me that way, boys.’\n\n“Then the thrombosis hit me and this leg [he pointed to the right one] weighed 20 pounds more than the other.”\n\nNext came the tough one, dermato‐myositis. “It's a wasting inflammation of the muscles. Simply eats them up. Leaves you so weak you can't stand. I tried to get up and bashed my eyes on the corner of the bed. Joanie was terrified. Thought I was done for ... and I almost was.\n\n“It creeps up on you, taking a little bit each day. When that lady doctor began bending over to listen to my breathing, I thought she was an idiot looking for tuberculosis. Then I realized ... Ah yes!. So that's how it's going to come ... my diaphragm . . . my breathing ... and that's all, brother!”\n\n“Did you have any clear thoughts on dying'?”\n\n“I suppose it was, ‘What the hell...'”\n\nWe poured more wine and talked about the way men die, about the fine Welsh actor, Stanley Baker, dying of cancer in Spain, wanting no one in the room with him. And Manolete, the bullfighter, whom Hemingway described as crawling under his bed to fight the last corrida alone. The Hindus also withdrew from the world to prepare for death. Animals go off alone.\n\nFor Olivier, that is the best way: “To go like one of the furry creatures into the forest, crawling underneath the bramble bush. It's rather more noble than wishing your family all around, somebody feeling your pulse . .. a lot of people fussing about. I find the little animal has more nobility somehow, don't you?”\n\nHe did not doubt the existence of God. He had grown up looking upward toward his father in a pulpit and, surely, there was something behind him, his words, his faith. Yet he seldom went to church now and, over the years, he had carried on an unresolved, often querulous dialogue with God — beginning in boyhood when he discovered the sudden, thrilling joy of the male potential.\n\n“I knew it was sinful to do it and it had to be resisted. So one night I got out of bed to pray for strength, but it happened while I was praying, and I said: “Now, God, don't you think that was just a little bit too tough?”\n\nWalking back to the flim set, he said he was trying to rebuild his strength. He had licked the muscle disease, emerging from the hospital in 16 weeks, instead of an anticipated six to nine months. He had improved until he could “chase Joanie around the balcony,” and he looked fine.\n\nAfter that, however, he was hit again — with a fibrous tissue wrapping itself around his urethra, blocking his kidney flow, requiring surgery. Sudden pneumonia came as a final blow.\n\n“I haven't recovered yet,” he said, “I'm hanging together by wires, rattling a bit as I go. But I can sure as hell ride a bicycle.”\n\nI said I thought he could, too, without knowing what it meant.\n\nThe silver‐gray Citroen, with a bicycle visible in the trunk, halted at the top of the hill. Inside, Olivier spoke to the driver.\n\n“Can you see him, Orestes?”\n\n“No sir,” said Orestes.\n\nOlivier spoke to the young man seated next to him. “Is he following us, John?”\n\n“I told him you wanted to do it alone,” replied John, an assistant to director Hill, the one man Olivier did not want to see. There was nothing Hill could do except make him nervous.\n\n“I don't want him hovering over me like some bloody hen.” said Olivier.\n\nJohn and Orestes nodded. They'd heard it before, ever since Olivier had taken one look at the special bicycle, produced at great expense to insure against his falling. It was built to look as if he were pedaling it; actually, it was propelled by a hidden mechanism. Clever, but odious to Olivier.\n\n“I can't mount that,” he had told Hill. “Old Blaunchkyng would turn in his grave!”\n\nHill knew Blaunchkyng was the gray gelding Olivier, as Henry V, had ridden in the filmed battle of Agincourt. However, Hill cared less for the soul of a horse — or Olivier's pride — than his film.\n\n“If you fall and bust your neck, it's mine, too — and everyone else's.”\n\nNow, atop the hill, the three men got out of the car. Orestes took out the bicycle while John looked across the valley toward Verona. He heard a car coming up the hill, but said nothing as Olivier perched himself unsteadily on the seat. It was a girl's bicycle, to spare him the problem of getting one leg over the bar. Each young man supported a handle bar.\n\n“Fear not, noble Greek,” he said to Orestes. To John, he said, “Let's go.”\n\nWith that, the two helpers ran alongside, holding him as he teetered to left and right, like a plane caught in a crosswind.\n\nBehind them, another Citroen pulled up and Hill saw Olivier pedaling away. The bicycle spokes spun like roulette wheels with two years’ work and several million dollars riding on them.\n\n“Release ... release me,” commanded Olivier as he gathered speed. Orestes dropped back, but John continued to run alongside, one finger on the handlebar.\n\n“Let go! ...
