        "text": "In September 2021, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) published new equations for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) that eliminated race-adjustment factors, including one based on creatinine (2021 CKD-EPI creatinine) and one based on creatinine and cystatin C (2021 CKD-EPI creatinine–cystatin C),1 in an effort to minimize health disparities and reduce inequity in medicine. Numerous professional organizations have endorsed the National Kidney Foundation/American Society of Nephrology Joint Task Force recommendations on incorporation of these equations in clinical practice.2-5 We assessed awareness and adoption of these equations in US clinical laboratories.\n\nMethods\n\nIn March 2022, the College of American Pathologists distributed an optional 5-question survey to clinical laboratories that participated in the first general chemistry proficiency testing survey in 2022 to assess awareness and adoption of the 2021 CKD-EPI equations. Survey respondents were clinical laboratory staff or directors in 50 US states, the District of Columbia, 3 US territories, and 51 other countries. The analysis was limited to laboratories in US states to allow assessment of representativeness. Institution-type differences were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression models with a Bonferroni adjustment. A 2-sided significance level of .05 was used with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). This study was reviewed by the University of Utah institutional review board and did not meet the definition of human participants research.\n\nResults\n\nOf 6317 laboratory proficiency testing participants, 4593 surveys were received. Of these, 295 (6.4%) were excluded due to duplicates from the same site (n = 176), missing key question responses (<3 responses or missing questions 1 and 2; n = 61), or pediatric laboratories for which the 2021 eGFR equations are not applicable (n = 58). The remaining 4298 surveys represent 68.0% of participant laboratories (US, 86.5%; international, 13.5%). Geographic distribution of US state respondents was similar to all US clinical laboratories with certificates of compliance or accreditation from the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and to US state nonrespondents6 (Table 1).\n\nOf US respondents, 76.9% reported being aware of the 2021 CKD-EPI equations and 30.3% reported that they already adopted the 2021 CKD-EPI creatinine equation (Table 2). Of the responding laboratories that had not yet adopted the 2021 CKD-EPI creatinine equation, 21.6% planned to adopt the equation before July 1, 2022, 10.7% between July 1 and December 31, 2022, 2.2% in 2023 or later, and 58.4% were unsure regarding future plans.\n\nOf US respondents, 3.4% reported that they already adopted the 2021 CKD-EPI creatinine–cystatin C equation, 8.0% reported that they planned to adopt it, 32.0% reported that they did not plan to adopt it, and 56.7% were unsure (Table 2). The 3 most common barriers to adoption of the 2021 CKD-EPI creatinine–cystatin C equation were limited cystatin C testing options, cost of testing, and staffing resources.\n\nReported awareness of the 2021 CKD-EPI equations was higher in US hospital laboratories (academic, 80.1%, P < .001; nonacademic, 76.8%, P = .02) vs physician office laboratories (68.9%) (Table 2). Nonhospital laboratory (eg, referral) respondents reported similar awareness as hospital laboratories. Adoption of the new equations by different types of laboratories also appears in Table 2.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe survey results demonstrated that most participating US state clinical laboratories reported being aware of the 2021 CKD-EPI equations and a large proportion had adopted or were planning to adopt the 2021 CKD-EPI creatinine equation as of March 2022. The 2021 CKD-EPI creatinine equation will enable standardized eGFR values for clinical practice decisions in patients with kidney disease. Guidance is now available to assist clinical laboratories with implementation.3\n\nFew laboratories reported that they have moved forward with implementation of the 2021 CKD-EPI creatinine–cystatin C equation. Referral laboratories are an option for cystatin C testing when it is not performed in-house.\n\nLimitations of this study include distribution of the survey only to laboratories that participated in this proficiency testing event, limited publicly available data on representativeness, the short interval between publication of the 2021 CKD-EPI equations and the survey, and the absence of questions regarding availability of cystatin C or why an “unsure” response was given.\n\nSection Editors: Jody W.
