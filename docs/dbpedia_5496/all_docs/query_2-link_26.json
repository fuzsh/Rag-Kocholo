A substantial proportion of older adults have chronic kidney disease and progress to kidney failure. There is considerable variability in treatment practices for advanced kidney disease among older adults, and evidence that treatment decisions such as dialysis initiation may be made without adequate preparation. When initiated, survival among older adults on chronic dialysis remains poor, and is associated with a significant decline in functional status. There is also evidence to suggest that dialysis initiation may not reflect overall treatment goals of elderly patients, but rather a lack of clear communication between patients and health practitioners, and underdeveloped conservative care programs in many centers. Kidney failure is common among older adults. When considering treatment options for kidney failure, patient priorities, preferences, and symptoms should be taken into account, using a shared decision-making approach.\n\nUrinary sodium excretion and kidney failure in non-diabetic chronic kidney disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFan, Li; Tighiouart, Hocine; Levey, Andrew S.; Beck, Gerald J.; Sarnak, Mark J.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nCurrent guidelines recommend under 2g/day sodium intake in chronic kidney disease, but there are few studies relating sodium intake to long-term outcomes. Here we evaluated the association of mean baseline 24-hour urinary sodium excretion with kidney failure and a composite outcome of kidney failure or all-cause mortality using Cox regression in 840 participants enrolled in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study. Mean 24-hour urinary sodium excretion was 3.46 g/day. Kidney failure developed in 617 and the composite outcome was reached in 723. In the primary analyses there was no association between 24-hour urine sodium and kidney failure [HR 0.99 (95% CI 0.91â1.08)] nor on the composite outcome [HR 1.01 (95% CI 0.93â1.09),] each per 1g/day higher urine sodium. In exploratory analyses there was a significant interaction of baseline proteinuria and sodium excretion with kidney failure. Using a 2-slope model, when urine sodium was under 3g/day, higher urine sodium was associated with increased risk of kidney failure in those with baseline proteinuria under 1g/day, and lower risk of kidney failure in those with baseline proteinuria of 1g/day or more. There was no association between urine sodium and kidney failure when urine sodium was 3g/day or more. Results were consistent using first baseline and time-dependent urine sodium. Thus, we noted no association of urine sodium with kidney failure. Results of the exploratory analyses need to be verified in additional studies and the mechanism explored. PMID:24646858\n\nEconomic impact of heart failure according to the effects of kidney failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nSicras Mainar, Antoni; Navarro Artieda, Ruth; IbÃ¡Ã±ez Nolla, Jordi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo evaluate the use of health care resources and their cost according to the effects of kidney failure in heart failure patients during 2-year follow-up in a population setting. Observational retrospective study based on a review of medical records. The study included patients â¥ 45 years treated for heart failure from 2008 to 2010. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence/absence of KF. Main outcome variables were comorbidity, clinical status (functional class, etiology), metabolic syndrome, costs, and new cases of cardiovascular events and kidney failure. The cost model included direct and indirect health care costs. Statistical analysis included multiple regression models. The study recruited 1600 patients (prevalence, 4.0%; mean age 72.4 years; women, 59.7%). Of these patients, 70.1% had hypertension, 47.1% had dyslipidemia, and 36.2% had diabetes mellitus. We analyzed 433 patients (27.1%) with kidney failure and 1167 (72.9%) without kidney failure. Patients with kidney failure were associated with functional class III-IV (54.1% vs 40.8%) and metabolic syndrome (65.3% vs 51.9%, P<.01). The average unit cost was â¬10,711.40. The corrected cost in the presence of kidney failure was â¬14,868.20 vs â¬9,364.50 (P=.001). During follow-up, 11.7% patients developed ischemic heart disease, 18.8% developed kidney failure, and 36.1% developed heart failure exacerbation. Comorbidity associated with heart failure is high. The presence of kidney failure increases the use of health resources and leads to higher costs within the National Health System. Copyright Â© 2014 Sociedad EspaÃ±ola de CardiologÃ­a.

In contrast, up to 16% of patients with MI have been shown to exhibit abnormalities in urinary sediment. Histological abnormalities--usually interstitial nephritis, and occasionally glomerular lesions--are rather common. Clinical symptoms include in rare cases isolated macrohematuria, occasionally a nephrotic or nephritic syndrome, and more commonly acute renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis, hepatorenal syndrome or acute interstitial nephritis. We report two observations of acute renal failure with a typically benign course and discuss these observations in the light of an updated literature survey of 34 patients.\n\nThe Loss of GSTM1 Associates with Kidney Failure and Heart Failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nTin, Adrienne; Scharpf, Robert; Estrella, Michelle M; Yu, Bing; Grove, Megan L; Chang, Patricia P; Matsushita, Kunihiro; KÃ¶ttgen, Anna; Arking, Dan E; Boerwinkle, Eric; Le, Thu H; Coresh, Josef; Grams, Morgan E\n\n2017-11-01\n\nGlutathione S-transferase mu 1 ( GSTM1) encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the conjugation of electrophilic compounds with glutathione to facilitate their degradation or excretion. The loss of one or both copies of GSTM1 is common in many populations and has been associated with CKD progression. With the hypothesis that the loss of GSTM1 is also associated with incident kidney failure and heart failure, we estimated GSTM1 copy number using exome sequencing reads in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, a community-based prospective cohort of white and black participants. Overall, 51.2% and 39.8% of white participants and 25.6% and 48.5% of black participants had zero or one copy of GSTM1 , respectively. Over a median follow-up of 24.6 years, 256 kidney failure events occurred in 5715 participants without prevalent kidney failure, and 1028 heart failure events occurred in 5368 participants without prevalent heart failure. In analysis adjusted for demographics, diabetes, and hypertension, having zero or one copy of GSTM1 associated with higher risk of kidney failure and heart failure (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] for zero or one versus two copies of GSTM1 : kidney failure, 1.66 [1.27 to 2.17]; heart failure, 1.16 [1.04 to 1.29]). Risk did not differ significantly between participants with zero and one copy of GSTM1 ( P >0.10). In summary, the loss of GSTM1 was significantly associated with incident kidney and heart failure, independent of traditional risk factors. These results suggest GSTM1 function is a potential treatment target for the prevention of kidney and heart failure.

Aim This nationwide family study aimed to determine familial risks for kidney failure in Sweden. Methods The Swedish multi-generation register on 0â78-year-old subjects were linked to the Swedish patient register and the Cause of death register for 1987â2010. Individuals diagnosed with acute kidney failure (nâ=â10063), chronic kidney failure (nâ=â18668), or unspecified kidney failure (nâ=â3731) were included. Kidney failure patients with cystic kidney disease, congenital kidney and urinary tract malformations, urolithiasis, and rare inherited kidney syndromes, and hyperoxaluria were excluded. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for individuals whose parents/siblings were diagnosed with kidney failure compared to those whose parents or siblings were not. Results The concordant (same disease) familial risks (sibling/parent history) were increased for chronic kidney failure SIRâ=â2.02 (95% confidence interval, CI 1.90â2.14) but not for acute kidney failure SIRâ=â1.08 (95% CI 0.94â1.22) and for unspecified kidney failure SIRâ=â1.25 (95% CI 0.94â1.63). However, the discordant (different disease) familial risk for acute kidney failure SIRâ=â1.19 (95% CI 1.06â1.32) and unspecified kidney failure SIRâ=â1.63 (95% CI 1.40â1.90) was significantly increased in individuals with a family history of chronic kidney failure. The familial risk for chronic kidney failure was similar for males SIRâ=â2.04 (95% CI 1.90â2.20) and females SIRâ=â1.97 (95% CI 1.78â2.17). Familial risks for chronic kidney failure were highest at age of 10â19 years SIRâ=â6.33 (95% CI 4.16â9.22). Conclusions The present study shows that family history is an important risk factor for chronic kidney failure but to a lower degree for acute kidney failure and unspecified kidney failure.

Characterization of acute renal failure is based on serum creatinine level which is imprecise during and following surgery. Studies are based on various definitions of acute renal failure with different thresholds which skewed their comparisons. The RIFLE classification (risk, injury, failure, loss, end stage kidney disease) allows clinicians to distinguish in a similar manner between different stages of acute kidney injury rather than using a unique definition of acute renal failure. Acute renal failure during the perioperative period can mainly be explained by iatrogenic, hemodynamic or surgical causes and can result in an increased morbi-mortality. Prevention of this complication requires hemodynamic optimization (venous return, cardiac output, vascular resistance), discontinuation of nephrotoxic drugs but also knowledge of the different steps of the surgery to avoid further degradation of renal perfusion. Diuretics do not prevent acute renal failure and may even push it forward especially during the perioperative period when venous retourn is already reduced. Edema or weight gain following surgery are not correlated with the vascular compartment volume, much less with renal perfusion. Treatment of perioperative acute renal failure is similar to other acute renal failure. Renal replacement therapy must be mastered to prevent any additional risk of hemodynamic instability or hydro-electrolytic imbalance. Copyright Â© 2014 Association SociÃ©tÃ© de nÃ©phrologie.

Lower serum uromodulin was recently associated with increased risk for kidney allograft failure in a preliminary, longitudinal single-center -European study involving 91 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). The Folic Acid for Vascular Outcome Reduction in Transplantation (FAVORIT) trial is a completed, large, multiethnic controlled clinical trial cohort, which studied chronic, stable KTRs. We conducted a case cohort analysis using a randomly selected subset of patients (random subcohort, n = 433), and all individuals who developed kidney allograft failure (cases, n = 226) during follow-up. Serum uromodulin was determined in this total of n = 613 FAVORIT trial participants at randomization. Death-censored kidney allograft failure was the study outcome. The 226 kidney allograft failures occurred during a median surveillance of 3.2 years. Unadjusted, weighted Cox proportional hazards modeling revealed that lower serum uromodulin, tertile 1 vs. tertile 3, was associated with a threefold greater risk for kidney allograft failure (hazards ratio [HR], 95% CI 3.20 [2.05-5.01]). This association was attenuated but persisted at twofold greater risk for allograft failure, after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, allograft type and vintage, prevalent diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease (CVD), total/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, systolic blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and natural log urinary albumin/creatinine: HR 2.00, 95% CI (1.06-3.77). Lower serum uromodulin, a possible indicator of less well-preserved renal tubular function, remained associated with greater risk for kidney allograft failure, after adjustment for major, established clinical kidney allograft failure and CVD risk factors, in a large, multiethnic cohort of long-term, stable KTRs.

Pathogenesis, interactions, and therapy].\n\nPubMed\n\nJohn, S; Willam, C\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe lungs and kidneys represent the most often affected organs (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS or kidney failure) in multiple organ failure (MOF) due to shock, trauma, or sepsis with a still unacceptable high mortality for both organ failures. Although the exact pathophysiological mechanisms of MOF are not completely elucidated, it appears that the lungs and kidneys share several pathophysiologic pathways and have the potential to further harm each other (kidney-lung crosstalk). Inflammatory signals in both directions and volume overload with consecutive edema formation in both organs may play a key role in this crosstalk. The organ replacement therapies used in both organ failures have the potential to further injure the other organ (ventilator trauma, dialyte trauma). On the other hand, renal replacement therapy can have positive effects on lung injury by restoring volume and acid-base homeostasis. The new development of \"low-flow\" extracorporeal CO2 removal on renal replacement therapy platforms may further help to decrease ventilator trauma in the future.\n\nDe Novo Heart Failure After Kidney Transplantation: Trends in Incidence and Outcomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nLenihan, Colin R; Liu, Sai; Deswal, Anita; Montez-Rath, Maria E; Winkelmayer, Wolfgang C\n\n2018-03-29\n\nHeart failure is an important cause of morbidity and mortality following kidney transplantation. Some studies in the general population have shown that the incidence of heart failure has decreased during the past 20 years. However, it is not currently known whether such a trend exists in the kidney transplantation population. Retrospective observational cohort study. Adult patients included in the US Renal Data System who underwent their first kidney transplantation in the United States between 1998 and 2010 with at least 6 months of continuous Medicare parts A and B coverage before transplantation and no prior evidence for aÂ diagnosis of heart failure before kidney transplantation. Calendar year of transplantation and calendar year of posttransplantation heart failure diagnosis. De novo posttransplantation heart failure defined using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis codes and mortality following de novo posttransplantation heart failure diagnosis. Secular trends in de novo post-kidney transplantation heart failure were examined using Cox proportional hazards analysis. Within a study cohort of 48,771 patients, 7,269 developed de novo heart failure within 3 years of kidney transplantation, with a median time to heart failure of 0.76 years. The adjusted HR for heart failure with death as competing risk comparing patients who underwent transplantation in 2010 with those who underwent transplantation in 1998 was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.60-0.79). No temporal trend in mortality following a diagnosis of post-kidney transplantation heart failure was observed. Potential residual confounding from either incorrectly ascertained or unavailable confounders. The cohort was limited to Medicare beneficiaries. Adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics, the risk for developing de novo post-kidney transplantation heart failure has declined significantly between 1998 and 2010, with no apparent change in subsequent mortality.

Patients with kidney failure receiving hemodialysis need a renewed focus on self-care, prevention, and community-based health management to reduce healthcare costs and complications, and improve outcomes and quality of life, while living with an altered lifestyle. A holistic chronic care model was applied as a guideline for healthcare professionals involved with this population to more effectively engage people with kidney failure in their management of their hemodialysis access.

It used 5% of deceased donor kidney transplanted in 2015. We evaluated the utility, defined as posttransplant kidney allograft lifespan, of this practice. Using data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we compared outcomes for all SLK transplants between January 1, 1995, and December 3, 2014, to their donor-matched kidney used in kidney-alone (Ki) or simultaneous pancreas kidney (SPK) transplants. Primary outcome was kidney allograft lifespan, defined as the time free from death or allograft failure. Secondary outcomes included death and death-censored allograft failure. We adjusted all analyses for donor, transplant, and recipient factors. The adjusted 10-year mean kidney allograft lifespan was higher in Ki/SPK compared with SLK transplants by 0.99 years in the Model for End-stage Liver Disease era and 1.71 years in the pre-Model for End-stage Liver Disease era. Death was higher in SLK recipients relative to Ki/SPK recipients: 10-year cumulative incidences 0.36 (95% confident interval 0.33-0.38) versus 0.19 (95% confident interval 0.17-0.21). SLK transplantation exemplifies the trade-off between the principles of utility and medical urgency. With each SLK transplantation, about 1 year of allograft lifespan is traded so that sicker patients, that is, SLK transplant recipients, are afforded access to the organ. These data provide a basis against which benefits derived from urgency-based allocation can be measured.\n\nUtility in Treating Kidney Failure in End-Stage Liver Disease With Simultaneous Liver-Kidney Transplantation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCheng, Xingxing S.; Stedman, Margaret R.; Chertow, Glenn M.; Kim, W.

Therefore, there is a need for a reliable tool to define permissible HLA mismatches in kidney transplantation. We previously demonstrated that donor-derived Predicted Indirectly ReCognizable HLA Epitopes presented by recipient HLA class II (PIRCHE-II) play a role in de novo donor-specific HLA antibodies formation after kidney transplantation. In the present Dutch multi-center study, we evaluated the possible association between PIRCHE-II and kidney graft failure in 2,918 donorârecipient couples that were transplanted between 1995 and 2005. For these donorsârecipients couples, PIRCHE-II numbers were related to graft survival in univariate and multivariable analyses. Adjusted for confounders, the natural logarithm of PIRCHE-II was associated with a higher risk for graft failure [hazard ratio (HR): 1.13, 95% CI: 1.04â1.23, pâ=â0.003]. When analyzing a subgroup of patients who had their first transplantation, the HR of graft failure for ln(PIRCHE-II) was higher compared with the overall cohort (HR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.10â1.34, pâ<â0.001). PIRCHE-II demonstrated both early and late effects on graft failure in this subgroup. These data suggest that the PIRCHE-II may impact graft survival after kidney transplantation. Inclusion of PIRCHE-II in donor-selection criteria may eventually lead to an improved kidney graft survival.

Among transplant-naÃ¯ve patients, those treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) show an early survival advantage compared with those treated with hemodialysis (HD). But any advantage of PD after allograft failure is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes of patients with failed allografts according to the type of dialysis modality. We reviewed medical records of patients who initiated dialysis after kidney transplant failure from November 1982 to May 2011. Demographics features, clinical data, and survival outcomes were compared between PD and HD patients who had experienced allograft failure. The 182 patients with failed allografts showed the most common cause to be chronic rejection. The median duration of function before allograft failure was 74.0 months. After allograft failure, 145 (79.7%) patients returned to HD and 37 (20.3%) to PD. Twenty-three patients (12.6%) died over the median 69.1 months duration of follow-up. During the observation period, 16 HD (11%) and 7 PD (8.9%) patients died. The survival rates of PD patients at 1 year were 91.2% and 84.4%, respectively, at 1 and 3 years, and those of HD patients 94.8% and 88.9%. There was no significant difference in the survivals of the 2 groups. The study suggests that the outcome of patients starting PD after kidney transplant failure was similar to those starting HD. Therefore, PD can be regarded to be a good treatment option for patients returning to dialysis after kidney transplant failure. Crown Copyright Â© 2013. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Few studies have investigated the relationship of urine potassium with clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Longitudinal cohort study. The MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) Study was a randomized controlled trial (NÂ = 840) conducted in 1989 to 1993 to examine the effects of blood pressure control and dietary protein restriction on kidney disease progression in adults aged 18 to 70 years with CKD stages 2 to 4. This post hoc analysis included 812 participants. The primary predictor variable was 24-hour urine potassium excretion, measured at baseline and at multiple time points (presented as time-updated average urine potassium excretion). Kidney failure, defined as initiation of dialysis therapy or transplantation, was determined from US Renal Data System data. All-cause mortality was assessed using the National Death Index. Median follow-up for kidney failure was 6.1 (IQR, 3.5-11.7) years, with 9 events/100 patient-years. Median all-cause mortality follow-up was 19.2 (IQR, 10.8-20.6) years, with 3 deaths/100 patient-years. Baseline mean urine potassium excretion was 2.39Â±0.89 (SD) g/d. Each 1-SD higher baseline urine potassium level was associated with an adjusted HR of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.87-1.04) for kidney failure and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.94) for all-cause mortality. Results were consistent using time-updated average urine potassium measurements. Analyses were performed using urine potassium excretion as a surrogate for dietary potassium intake. Results are obtained from a primarily young, nondiabetic, and advanced CKD population and may not be generalizable to the general CKD population. Higher urine potassium excretion was associated with lower risk for all-cause mortality, but not kidney failure. Copyright Â© 2016 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

To clarify diagnosis, the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative group stated its consensus on the need for a clear definition and classification system of renal dysfunction with measurable criteria. Today the term acute kidney injury has replaced the term acute renal failure, with an understanding that such injury is a common clinical problem in critically ill patients and typically is predictive of an increase in morbidity and mortality. A classification system, known as RIFLE (risk of injury, injury, failure, loss of function, and end-stage renal failure), includes specific goals for preventing acute kidney injury: adequate hydration, maintenance of renal perfusion, limiting exposure to nephrotoxins, drug protective strategies, and the use of renal replacement therapies that reduce renal injury.\n\nTranslational value of animal models of kidney failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nOrtiz, Alberto; Sanchez-NiÃ±o, Maria D; Izquierdo, Maria C; Martin-Cleary, Catalina; Garcia-Bermejo, Laura; Moreno, Juan A; Ruiz-Ortega, Marta; Draibe, Juliana; Cruzado, Josep M; Garcia-Gonzalez, Miguel A; Lopez-Novoa, Jose M; Soler, Maria J; Sanz, Ana B\n\n2015-07-15\n\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are associated with decreased renal function and increased mortality risk, while the therapeutic armamentarium is unsatisfactory. The availability of adequate animal models may speed up the discovery of biomarkers for disease staging and therapy individualization as well as design and testing of novel therapeutic strategies. Some longstanding animal models have failed to result in therapeutic advances in the clinical setting, such as kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury and diabetic nephropathy models. In this regard, most models for diabetic nephropathy are unsatisfactory in that they do not evolve to renal failure. Satisfactory models for additional nephropathies are needed. These include anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, IgA nephropathy, anti-phospholipase-A2-receptor (PLA2R) membranous nephropathy and Fabry nephropathy. However, recent novel models hold promise for clinical translation. Thus, the AKI to CKD translation has been modeled, in some cases with toxins of interest for human CKD such as aristolochic acid. Genetically modified mice provide models for Alport syndrome evolving to renal failure that have resulted in clinical recommendations, polycystic kidney disease models that have provided clues for the development of tolvaptan, that was recently approved for the human disease in Japan; and animal models also contributed to target C5 with eculizumab in hemolytic uremic syndrome. Some ongoing trials explore novel concepts derived from models, such TWEAK targeting as tissue protection for lupus nephritis. We now review animal models reproducing diverse, genetic and acquired, causes of AKI and CKD evolving to kidney failure and discuss the contribution to clinical translation and prospects for the future.

However, this question has not been addressed outside the United States so far. Our objective was to investigate whether the hazard of graft failure also increases during this age period in France irrespective of age at transplantation. Data of all first kidney transplantation performed before 30 years of age between 1993 and 2012 were extracted from the French kidney transplant database. The hazard of graft failure was estimated at each current age using a 2-stage modelling approach that accounted for both age at transplantation and time since transplantation. Hazard ratios comparing the risk of graft failure during adolescence or early adulthood to other periods were estimated from time-dependent Cox models. A total of 5983 renal transplant recipients were included. The risk of graft failure was found to increase around the age of 13 years until the age of 21 years, and decrease thereafter. Results from the Cox model indicated that the hazard of graft failure during the age period 13 to 23 years was almost twice as high as than during the age period 0 to 12 years, and 25% higher than after 23 years. Among first kidney transplant recipients younger than 30 years in France, those currently in adolescence or early adulthood have the highest risk of graft failure.\n\nAssociation between First Nations ethnicity and progression to kidney failure by presence and severity of albuminuria.\n\nPubMed\n\nSamuel, Susan M; Palacios-Derflingher, Luz; Tonelli, Marcello; Manns, Braden; Crowshoe, Lynden; Ahmed, Sofia B; Jun, Min; Saad, Nathalie; Hemmelgarn, Brenda R\n\n2014-02-04\n\nDespite a low prevalence of chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR]<60 mL/min per 1.73 m2), First Nations people have high rates of kidney failure requiring chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation. We sought to examine whether the presence and severity of albuminuria contributes to the progression of chronic kidney disease to kidney failure among First Nations people. We identified all adult residents of Alberta (ageâ¥18 yr) for whom an outpatient serum creatinine measurement was available from May 1, 2002, to Mar. 31, 2008. We determined albuminuria using urine dipsticks and categorized results as normal (i.e., no albuminuria), mild, heavy or unmeasured. Our primary outcome was progression to kidney failure (defined as the need for chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, or a sustained doubling of serum creatinine levels). We calculated rates of progression to kidney failure by First Nations status, by estimated GFR and by albuminuria category. We determined the relative hazard of progression to kidney failure for First Nations compared with non-First Nations participants by level of albuminuria and estimated GFR. Of the 1 816 824 participants we identified, 48 669 (2.7%) were First Nations. First Nations people were less likely to have normal albuminuria compared with non-First Nations people (38.7% v. 56.4%). Rates of progression to kidney failure were consistently 2- to 3-fold higher among First Nations people than among non-First Nations people, across all levels of albuminuria and estimated GFRs. Compared with non-First Nations people, First Nations people with an estimated GFR of 15.0-29.9 mL/min per 1.73 m2 had the highest risk of progression to kidney failure, with similar hazard ratios for those with normal and heavy albuminuria. Albuminuria confers a similar risk of progression to kidney failure for First Nations and non-First Nations people.\n\nProfile, risk factors and outcome of acute kidney injury in paediatric acute-on-chronic liver failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nLal, Bikrant B; Alam, Seema; Sood, Vikrant; Rawat, Dinesh; Khanna, Rajeev\n\n2018-01-11\n\nThere are no studies on acute kidney injury in paediatric acute-on-chronic liver failure. This study was planned with aim to describe the clinical presentation and outcome of acute kidney injury among paediatric acute-on-chronic liver failure patients. Data of all children 1-18Â years of age presenting with acute chronic liver failure (Asia pacific association for the study of the liver definition) was reviewed. Acute kidney injury was defined as per Kidney Diseases-Improving Global Outcomes guidelines. Poor outcome was defined as death or need for liver transplant within 3Â months of development of acute kidney injury. A total of 84 children with acute-on-chronic liver failure were presented to us in the study period. Acute kidney injury developed in 22.6% of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. The median duration from acute-on-chronic liver failure to development of acute kidney injury was 4Â weeks (Range: 2-10Â weeks). The causes of acute kidney injury were hepatorenal syndrome (31.6%), sepsis (31.6%), nephrotoxic drugs (21%), dehydration (10.5%) and bile pigment related acute tubular necrosis in one patient. On univariate analysis, higher baseline bilirubin, higher international normalized ratio, higher paediatric end stage liver disease, presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and presence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis had significant association with presence of acute kidney injury. On logistic regression analysis, presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (adjusted OR: 8.659, 95% CI: 2.18-34.37, PÂ =Â .002) and higher baseline bilirubin (adjusted OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.008-1.135, PÂ =Â .025) were independently associated with presence of acute kidney injury. Of the patients with acute kidney injury, 5(26.3%) survived with native liver, 10(52.6%) died and 4 (21.1%) underwent liver transplantation. Acute kidney injury developed in 22.6% of children with acute-on-chronic liver failure.

Our goal for renal regeneration is to establish a kidney graft derived from human embryonic tissues. In this study, we investigated the effects of host renal failure on the structure and activity of transplanted embryonic kidney and bladder, and found that diuretics effectively induced urine production in the transplanted kidney. Uremic conditions were reproduced using a 5/6 renal infarction rat model. An embryonic kidney plus bladder (embryonic day 15) was isolated from a pregnant Lewis rat and transplanted into the para-aortic area of a 5/6 renal-infarcted Lewis rat. Following growth, the embryonic bladder was successfully anastomosed to the host ureter. We assessed graft function in terms of survival rates and found no differences between normal (nÂ =Â 5) and renal failure (nÂ =Â 8) groups (median survival: 70.5 vs 74.5Â h; pÂ =Â 0.331) in terms of survival, indicating that the grafts prolonged rat survival, even under renal failure conditions. Furosemide (nÂ =Â 9) significantly increased urine volume compared with saline-treated controls (nÂ =Â 7; pÂ <Â 0.05), confirming that the grafts were functional. We also demonstrated the possibilities of an in vivo imaging system for determining the viability of transplanted embryonic kidney with bladder. The results of this study demonstrate that transplanted embryonic kidney and bladder can grow and function effectively, even under uremic conditions.\n\nHeart failure in patients with kidney disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nTuegel, Courtney; Bansal, Nisha\n\n2017-12-01\n\nHeart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the population of CKD patients with concurrent HF continues to grow. The accurate diagnosis of HF is challenging in patients with CKD in part due to a lack of validated imaging and biomarkers specifically in this population. The pathophysiology between the heart and the kidneys is complex and bidirectional. Patients with CKD have greater prevalence of traditional HF risk factors as well as unique kidney-specific risk factors including malnutrition, acid-base alterations, uraemic toxins, bone mineral changes, anemia and myocardial stunning. These risk factors also contribute to the decline of kidney function seen in patients with subclinical and clinical HF. More targeted HF therapies may improve outcomes in patients with kidney disease as current HF therapies are underutilised in this population. Further work is also needed to develop novel HF therapies for the CKD population. Â© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

Retrospective cohort study. Adult patients (agedÂ â¥18 years) who started hemodialysis therapy in Ontario, Canada, from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2010, after kidney transplant failure. Patient clinical and demographic characteristics. Proportion and timing of arteriovenous (AV) vascular access creation (fistula or graft) 12 months prior and up to 24 months after starting hemodialysis therapy. Event rates and outcome predictors. Our cohort included 683 patients with a mean age of 48 years and >50% with comorbidity index scoreÂ < 3. In the 12 months predialysis and 24 months postdialysis, 16% and 47% of patients had an AV access created, respectively. In the postdialysis period, 13%, 26%, and 38% of patients had an AV access creation at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. History of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and peritoneal dialysis use prior to transplantation were associated with a lower likelihood of AV access creation. Residual selection bias from unmeasured variables beyond the data elements. In Ontario, AV access creation, both before and after starting hemodialysis therapy, is low in patients with kidney transplant failure despite their being younger and healthier compared to the overall hemodialysis population. This highlights the need for a predialysis care pathway in the transplantation clinic and an active strategy to identify this patient cohort receiving hemodialysis to align modality and access choices.

His complaints were weakness and fatigue for more than one week. Four days before admission, he went to his general practitioner for these complaints and also for painful elbows. His physician prescribed diclofenac and esomeprazole. Upon presentation, he had high systolic/diastolic blood pressure (>180/>90Â mmÂ Hg, measured repeatedly), and otherwise normal parameters. He had gained 6.5Â kg in body weight. Clinical examination was normal, except for very mild bilateral malleolar edema. Routine blood tests showed a strongly elevated serum creatinine, hyperkalemia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Haptoglobin levels were normal. Urinalysis showed a normal sediment, urine and blood cultures remained sterile. Ophthalmoscopy was completely normal, as was a routine chest X-ray. Renal ultrasound demonstrated kidneys with a diameter of 13Â cm. Due to uncontrollable hypertension, our patient was hospitalized at the intensive care department where intravenous nifedipine was started, with good instantaneous control of blood pressure. Because of increasing potassium levels acute hemodialysis was started within 24Â h after admission. Differential diagnosis consisted of diclofenac- or esomeprazole-induced interstitial nephritis or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. A renal biopsy was performed within 72Â h after admission. The kidney biopsy showed an overwhelming inflammatory cell infiltrate consisting of a monoclonal lymphocytic cell population. However, the numerous mitotic figures, polyploidy, and prominent nucleoli present, were indicative of a lymphoma. Additional stainings confirmed a non-Hodgkin diffuse large-cell B-cell lymphoma. Treatment with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine, vincristine, and prednisolone) was initiated with very good clinical and biochemical response, yet only mild recovery of kidney function.

Our objective was to systematically review the models that have been recently developed and validated to predict graft failure in kidney transplantation recipients. We used PubMed and Scopus to search for English, German and French language articles published in 2005-15. We selected studies that developed and validated a new risk prediction model for graft failure after kidney transplantation, or validated an existing model with or without updating the model. Data on recipient characteristics and predictors, as well as modelling and validation methods were extracted. In total, 39 articles met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 34 developed and validated a new risk prediction model and 5 validated an existing one with or without updating the model. The most frequently predicted outcome was graft failure, defined as dialysis, re-transplantation or death with functioning graft. Most studies used the Cox model. There was substantial variability in predictors used. In total, 25 studies used predictors measured at transplantation only, and 14 studies used predictors also measured after transplantation. Discrimination performance was reported in 87% of studies, while calibration was reported in 56%. Performance indicators were estimated using both internal and external validation in 13 studies, and using external validation only in 6 studies. Several prediction models for kidney graft failure in adults have been published. Our study highlights the need to better account for competing risks when applicable in such studies, and to adequately account for post-transplant measures of predictors in studies aiming at improving monitoring of kidney transplant recipients.

Microbiome products, such as advanced glycation end products, phenols, and indoles, are absorbed into the circulation but are cleared by normal-functioning kidneys. These products then become toxic and contribute to the uremic load and to the progression of chronic kidney failure. In this review, we discuss the gut-kidney interaction under the state of chronic kidney failure as well as the potential mechanisms by which a change in the gut flora (termed gut dysbiosis) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) exacerbates uremia and leads to further progression of CKD and inflammation. Finally, the potential therapeutic interventions to target the gut microbiome in CKD are discussed.

There was a nominally higher HR in participants with eGFRs of 30 to 44mL/min/1.73m 2 (adjusted HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.99-1.29),Â butÂ this did not reach statistical significance.Â The relationship between uric acid concentrationÂ and all-cause mortality was J-shaped (P=0.007). Potential residual confounding through unavailable confounders; lack of follow-up measurements to adjust for changes in uric acid concentrations over time. Uric acid concentration is an independent risk factor for kidney failure in earlier stages of CKD and has a J-shaped relationship with all-cause mortality in CKD. Adequately powered randomized placebo-controlled trials in CKD are needed to test whether urate lowering may prove to be an effective approach to prevent complications and progression of CKD.

Kidney failure risk equations, including such factors as age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and calcium and phosphate concentrations, were previously developed and validated in 2 Canadian cohorts. Validation in other regions and in CKD populations not under the care of a nephrologist is needed. To evaluate the accuracy of the risk equations across different geographic regions and patient populations through individual participant data meta-analysis. Thirty-one cohorts, including 721,357 participants with CKD stages 3 to 5 in more than 30 countries spanning 4 continents, were studied. These cohorts collected data from 1982 through 2014. Cohorts participating in the CKD Prognosis Consortium with data on end-stage renal disease. Data were obtained and statistical analyses were performed between July 2012 and June 2015. Using the risk factors from the original risk equations, cohort-specific hazard ratios were estimated and combined using random-effects meta-analysis to form new pooled kidney failure risk equations. Original and pooled kidney failure risk equation performance was compared, and the need for regional calibration factors was assessed. Kidney failure (treatment by dialysis or kidney transplant). During a median follow-up of 4 years of 721,357 participants with CKD, 23,829 cases kidney failure were observed. The original risk equations achieved excellent discrimination (ability to differentiate those who developed kidney failure from those who did not) across all cohorts (overall C statistic, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.89-0.92 at 2 years; C statistic at 5 years, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.86-0.90); discrimination in subgroups by age, race, and diabetes status was similar. There was no improvement with the pooled equations. Calibration (the difference between observed and predicted risk) was adequate in North American cohorts, but the original risk\n\nUnderstanding the causes of kidney transplant failure: the dominant role of antibody-mediated rejection and nonadherence.\n\nPubMed\n\nSellarÃ©s, J; de Freitas, D G; Mengel, M; Reeve, J; Einecke, G; Sis, B; Hidalgo, L G; Famulski, K; Matas, A; Halloran, P F\n\n2012-02-01\n\nWe prospectively studied kidney transplants that progressed to failure after a biopsy for clinical indications, aiming to assign a cause to every failure. We followed 315 allograft recipients who underwent indication biopsies at 6 days to 32 years posttransplant. Sixty kidneys progressed to failure in the follow-up period (median 31.4 months). Failure was rare after T-cell-mediated rejection and acute kidney injury and common after antibody-mediated rejection or glomerulonephritis. We developed rules for using biopsy diagnoses, HLA antibody and clinical data to explain each failure. Excluding four with missing information, 56 failures were attributed to four causes: rejection 36 (64%), glomerulonephritis 10 (18%), polyoma virus nephropathy 4 (7%) and intercurrent events 6 (11%). Every rejection loss had evidence of antibody-mediated rejection by the time of failure. Among rejection losses, 17 of 36 (47%) had been independently identified as nonadherent by attending clinicians. Nonadherence was more frequent in patients who progressed to failure (32%) versus those who survived (3%). Pure T-cell-mediated rejection, acute kidney injury, drug toxicity and unexplained progressive fibrosis were not causes of loss. This prospective cohort indicates that many actual failures after indication biopsies manifest phenotypic features of antibody-mediated or mixed rejection and also underscores the major role of nonadherence.

Objective. To determine the association between fluid overload and the rate of kidney failure in a group of children with severe sepsis and septic shock. This was a prospective cohort study conducted in the intensive care unit of Hospital Universitario de PediatrÃ­a âDr. AgustÃ­n Zubillagaâ (Barquisimeto, Lara State, Venezuela), between March 2013 and May 2016, in children with severe sepsis or septic shock. One hundred and forty-nine patients were included in the analysis. Sepsis predominated in 59.7% of cases; patients' average age was 6.4 Â± 3.3 years old, their average weight was 17.8 Â± 3.6 kg, 30.2% had fluid overload, and overall mortality was 25.5%. Kidney failure occurred in 16.1% of cases. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify fluid overload (odds ratio [OR]: 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-4.9, p = 0.028) and shock for more than 2 days (OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.3-6.3, p = 0.039) as independent predictors of kidney failure. In addition, a significant increase in the risk of mortality among children with kidney failure and fluid overload was observed as per the Kaplan-Meier method (p= 0.019). Fluid overload and shock for more than 2 days increase the risk for kidney failure in critically ill children with severe sepsis and septic shock.\n\nAcute Kidney Failure\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... through your urine Impaired blood flow to the kidneys Diseases and conditions that may slow blood flow ... anaphylaxis) Severe burns Severe dehydration Damage to the kidneys These diseases, conditions and agents may damage the ...\n\nHyperkalemia and acute kidney failure associated with preoperative uterine artery embolization for a large uterine fibroid: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nTanaka, Keiko; Koizumi, Toshimitsu; Higa, Takeru; Imai, Noriaki\n\n2016-11-01\n\nPreoperative uterine artery embolization has been shown to help reduce blood loss, with few complications. Most reports indicated that uterine artery embolization is safe for uterine fibrosis; the occurrence of hyperkalemia and acute kidney failure as complications of preoperative uterine artery embolization has not been reported previously. Here we report the occurrence of hyperkalemia and acute kidney failure after preoperative uterine artery embolization for a large uterine fibroid. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the occurrence of hyperkalemia and acute kidney failure after preoperative uterine artery embolization. A 48-year-old Japanese woman presented to our hospital complaining of compression in her abdomen and an abdominal mass. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large uterine fibroid measuring 37.5Ã27Ã13.5 cm. Therefore, we planned preoperative uterine artery embolization to help reduce blood loss. However, hyperkalemia and acute kidney failure occurred owing to the development of necrotic tissue after uterine artery embolization; therefore, emergency total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. She experienced 105 g of blood loss intraoperatively. The weight of her uterus was 10.8 kg and the volume was 9964 cm 3 , with extensive necrotic tissue. Her hyperkalemia and kidney failure resolved after the surgery. We reported the occurrence of serious complications, including hyperkalemia and acute kidney failure, after preoperative uterine artery embolization for a large uterine fibroid.\n\nAcute renal failure potentiates methylmalonate-induced oxidative stress in brain and kidney of rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchuck, P F; Alves, L; Pettenuzzo, L F; Felisberto, F; Rodrigues, L B; Freitas, B W; Petronilho, F; Dal-Pizzol, F; Streck, E L; Ferreira, G C\n\n2013-03-01\n\nTissue methylmalonic acid (MMA) accumulation is the biochemical hallmark of methylmalonic acidemia. The disease is clinically characterized by progressive neurological deterioration and kidney failure, whose pathophysiology is still unclear. In the present work we investigated the effects of acute MMA administration on various parameters of oxidative stress in cerebral cortex and kidney of young rats, as well as the influence of acute renal failure on MMA-elicited effects on these parameters. Acute renal failure was induced by gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic whose utilization over prolonged periods causes nephrotoxicity. The administration of gentamicin alone increased carbonyl content and inhibited superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in cerebral cortex, as well as increased thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBA-RS) and sulfhydryl levels and diminished glutathione peroxidase activity in kidney. On the other hand, MMA administration increased TBA-RS levels in cerebral cortex and decreased SOD activity in kidney. Furthermore, the simultaneous administration of MMA and gentamicin to the rats provoked an augment in TBA-RS levels and superoxide generation in cerebral cortex and in TBA-RS, carbonyl and sulfhydryl levels in kidney, while diminished SOD activity in both studied tissues. Finally, nitrate/nitrite content, reduced glutathione levels, 2',7'-dihydrodichlorofluorescein oxidation and catalase activity were not affected by this animal treatment in either tissue. In conclusion, our present data are in line with the hypothesis that MMA acts as a toxin in brain and kidney of rats and suggest that renal injury potentiates the toxicity of MMA on oxidative stress parameters in brain and peripheral tissues.\n\nChronic kidney disease\n\nMedlinePlus\n\nKidney failure - chronic; Renal failure - chronic; Chronic renal insufficiency; Chronic kidney failure; Chronic renal failure ...

From January 2012 to December 2016, 30 kidneys from 15 deceased donors with severe rhabdomyolysis and ARF were accepted for transplantation at our center. The peak serum creatinine (SCr) kinase, myoglobin, and SCr of the these donors were 15Â 569Â±8597Â U/L, 37Â 092Â±42Â 100Â Î¼g/L, and 422Â±167Â Î¼mol/L, respectively. Two donors received continuous renal replacement therapy due to anuria. Six kidneys exhibited a discolored appearance (from brown to glossy black) due to myoglobin casts. The kidney transplant results from the donors with rhabdomyolysis donors were compared with those of 90 renal grafts from standard criteria donors (SCD). The estimated glomerular filtration rate at 2Â years was similar between kidney transplants from donors with rhabdomyolysis and SCD (70.3Â±14.6Â mL/min/1.73Â m 2 vs 72.3Â±15.1Â mL/min/1.73Â m 2 ). We conclude that excellent graft function can be achieved from kidneys donors with ARF caused by rhabdomyolysis. Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Reduced kidney function is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in this patient population. The cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) involves a bidirectional relationship between the heart and kidneys whereby dysfunction in either may exacerbate the function of the other, but this syndrome has been difficult to precisely define because it has many complex physiologic, biochemical, and hormonal abnormalities. The pathophysiology of CRS is not completely understood, but potential mechanisms include reduced kidney perfusion due to decreased forward flow, increased right ventricular and venous pressure, and neurohormonal adaptations. Treatment options include inotropic medications; diuretics; ultrafiltration; and medications, such as Î²-blockers, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and more novel treatments that focus on unique aspects of the pathophysiology. Recent observational studies suggest that treatments that result in a decrease in venous pressure and lead to hemoconcentration may be associated with improved outcomes. Patients with CRS that is not responsive to medical interventions should be considered for ventricular assist devices, heart transplantation, or combined heart and kidney transplantation.

HF often coexists with a number of comorbidities of which declining renal function is of particular importance. A loss of glomerular filtration rate, as in acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD), independently predicts mortality and accelerates the overall progression of cardiovascular disease and HF. Importantly, cardiac and renal diseases interact in a complex bidirectional and interdependent manner in both acute and chronic settings. From a pathophysiological perspective, cardiac and renal diseases share a number of common pathways, including inflammatory and direct, cellular immune-mediated mechanisms; stress-mediated and (neuro)hormonal responses; metabolic and nutritional changes including bone and mineral disorder, altered haemodynamic and acid-base or fluid status; and the development of anaemia. In an effort to better understand the important crosstalk between the two organs, classifications such as the cardio-renal syndromes were developed. This classification might lead to a more precise understanding of the complex interdependent pathophysiology of cardiac and renal diseases. In light of exceptionally high mortality associated with coexisting HF and kidney disease, this Review describes important crosstalk between the heart and kidney, with a focus on HF and kidney disease in the acute and chronic settings. Underlying molecular and cellular pathomechanisms in HF, AKI and CKD are discussed in addition to current and future therapeutic approaches.\n\nInjury - kidney and ureter\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... injury of the kidney; Bruised kidney; Ureteral injury; Pre-renal failure - injury, Post-renal failure - injury; Kidney ... or falling blood pressure Signs of kidney failure Tests that may be done include: Abdominal CT scan ...\n\nTiming of Pregnancy After Kidney Transplantation and Risk of Allograft Failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nRose, C; Gill, J; Zalunardo, N; Johnston, O; Mehrotra, A; Gill, J S\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe optimal timing of pregnancy after kidney transplantation remains uncertain. We determined the risk of allograft failure among women who became pregnant within the first 3 posttransplant years. Among 21 814 women aged 15-45 years who received a first kidney-only transplant between 1990 and 2010 captured in the United States Renal Data System, n = 729 pregnancies were identified using Medicare claims. The probability of allograft failure from any cause including death (ACGL) at 1, 3, and 5 years after pregnancy was 9.6%, 25.9%, and 36.6%. In multivariate analyses, pregnancy in the first posttransplant year was associated with an increased risk of ACGL (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00, 1.40) and death censored graft loss (DCGL) (HR:1.25; 95% CI 1.04, 1.50), while pregnancy in the second posttransplant year was associated with an increased risk of DCGL (HR: 1.26; 95% CI 1.06, 1.50). Pregnancy in the third posttransplant year was not associated with an increased risk of ACGL or DCGL. These findings demonstrate a higher incidence of allograft failure after pregnancy than previously reported and that the increased risk of allograft failure extends to pregnancies in the second posttransplant year.

It occurs in around one-third of patients treated in intensive care unit (ICU) and is even more prevalent in cardiac surgery patients. There is a higher mortality in patients with AKI compared with non-AKI counterparts, and in severe AKI requiring renal support, the 6 month mortality is >50%. Unlike the progressive development of biomarkers in cardiology, there have been few changes in kidney diagnostic markers. Creatinine is still used as an indicator of kidney function but not of the parenchymal kidney injury. Serum creatinine (sCr) concentration does not change until around 50% of kidney function is lost, and varies with muscle mass, age, sex, medications, and hydration status. The lag time between injury and loss of function, risks missing a therapeutic opportunity, and may explain the high associated mortality. Novel biomarkers of AKI- and failure include neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, N-acetyl-Î²-d-glucosaminidase, kidney injury molecule-1, interleukin-18, and cystatin C. The pathophysiology associated with accumulation of these markers in plasma and urine is not clear, but a common denominator is inflammation. Some of these new AKI biomarkers may have clinical applicability in anaesthesia and intensive care in the future. It is possible that a 'kidney biomarker panel' will become standard before and after major surgery. If elevated or positive, the anaesthetist must take special care to optimize the patients after operation on the surgical wards or ICU to avoid further nephrotoxic insults and initiate supplementary care.\n\nPeripheral arterial disease preoperatively may predict graft failure and mortality in kidney transplant recipients.\n\nPubMed\n\nPatel, Salma I; Chakkera, Harini A; Wennberg, Paul W; Liedl, David A; Alrabadi, Fadi; Cha, Stephen S; Hooley, Darren D; Amer, Hatem; Wadei, Hani M; Shamoun, Fadi E\n\n2017-06-01\n\nPatients with end-stage renal disease undergoing kidney transplant often have diffuse atherosclerosis and high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates. We analyzed the correlation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), here quantified by an abnormal ankle-brachial index (ABI) measured within the 5 years prior to kidney transplant, with graft failure and mortality rates (primary end points) after adjusting for known cardiovascular risk factors (age, sex, smoking history, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, known coronary artery disease or heart failure, years of dialysis). Of 1055 patients in our transplant population, 819 had arterial studies within the 5 years prior to transplant. Secondary end points included myocardial infarction; cerebrovascular accident; and limb ischemia, gangrene, or amputation. Low ABI was an independent and significant predictor of organ failure (OR, 2.77 (95% CI, 1.68-4.58), p<0.001), secondary end points (HR, 1.39 (95% CI, 0.97-1.99), p<0.076), and death (HR, 1.84 (95% CI, 1.26-2.68), p=0.002). PAD was common in this population: of 819 kidney transplant recipients, 46% had PAD. Low ABI was associated with a threefold greater risk of graft failure, a twofold greater risk of death after transplant, and a threefold greater risk of secondary end points. Screening for PAD is important in this patient population because of the potential impact on long-term outcomes.\n\nEffect of Early Vasopressin vs Norepinephrine on Kidney Failure in Patients With Septic Shock: The VANISH Randomized Clinical Trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nGordon, Anthony C; Mason, Alexina J; Thirunavukkarasu, Neeraja; Perkins, Gavin D; Cecconi, Maurizio; Cepkova, Magda; Pogson, David G; Aya, Hollmann D; Anjum, Aisha; Frazier, Gregory J; Santhakumaran, Shalini; Ashby, Deborah; Brett, Stephen J\n\n2016-08-02\n\nNorepinephrine is currently recommended as the first-line vasopressor in septic shock; however, early vasopressin use has been proposed as an alternative. To compare the effect of early vasopressin vs norepinephrine on kidney failure in patients with septic shock. A factorial (2Ã2), double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted in 18 general adult intensive care units in the United Kingdom between February 2013 and May 2015, enrolling adult patients who had septic shock requiring vasopressors despite fluid resuscitation within a maximum of 6 hours after the onset of shock. Patients were randomly allocated to vasopressin (titrated up to 0.06 U/min) and hydrocortisone (nâ=â101), vasopressin and placebo (nâ=â104), norepinephrine and hydrocortisone (nâ=â101), or norepinephrine and placebo (nâ=â103). The primary outcome was kidney failure-free days during the 28-day period after randomization, measured as (1) the proportion of patients who never developed kidney failure and (2) median number of days alive and free of kidney failure for patients who did not survive, who experienced kidney failure, or both. Rates of renal replacement therapy, mortality, and serious adverse events were secondary outcomes. A total of 409 patients (median age, 66 years; men, 58.2%) were included in the study, with a median time to study drug administration of 3.5 hours after diagnosis of shock. The number of survivors who never developed kidney failure was 94 of 165 patients (57.0%) in the vasopressin group and 93 of 157 patients (59.2%) in the norepinephrine group (difference, -2.3% [95% CI, -13.0% to 8.5%]). The median number of kidney failure-free days for patients who did not survive, who experienced kidney failure, or both was 9 days (interquartile range [IQR], 1 to -24) in the vasopressin group and 13 days (IQR, 1 to -25) in the norepinephrine group (difference, -4 days [95% CI, -11 to 5]). There was less use of renal replacement therapy in the vasopressin group\n\nFamilial mixed nephrocalcinosis as a cause of chronic kidney failure: two case reports.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Arruda, Pedro Francisco Ferraz; Gatti, MÃ¡rcio; de Arruda, JosÃ© Germano Ferraz; FÃ¡cio, Fernando Nestor; Spessoto, Luis Cesar Fava; de Arruda, LaÃ­sa Ferraz; de Godoy, JosÃ© Maria Pereira; Godoy, Moacir Fernandes\n\n2014-10-27\n\nNephrocalcinosis consists of the deposition of calcium salts in the renal parenchyma and is considered the mixed form when it involves the renal cortex and medulla. The main etiological agents of this condition are primary hyperparathyroidism, renal tubular acidosis, medullary sponge kidney, hyperoxaluria and taking certain drugs. These factors can lead to hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria, which can give rise to nephrocalcinosis. Patient 1 was a 48-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of bilateral nephrocalcinosis causing chronic kidney failure. Imaging examinations (X-ray, ultrasound and computed tomography of the abdomen) revealed extensive calcium deposits in the renal parenchyma, indicating nephrocalcinosis as the causal factor of the disease. Patient 2 is the 45-year-old brother of patient 1. He exhibited an advanced stage of chronic kidney failure. As nephrocalcinosis is considered to have a genetic component, a family investigation revealed this condition in patient 2. Nephrocalcinosis may be detected incidentally through diagnostic imaging studies. Whenever possible, treatment should include the base disease that caused the appearance of the calcification, as the precise etiological determination is extremely important.\n\nGDF11 induces kidney fibrosis, renal cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and kidney dysfunction and failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nPons, Marianne; Koniaris, Leonidas G; Moe, Sharon M; Gutierrez, Juan C; Esquela-Kerscher, Aurora; Zimmers, Teresa A\n\n2018-05-03\n\nGDF11 modulates embryonic patterning and kidney organogenesis. Herein, we sought to define GDF11 function in the adult kidney and in renal diseases. In vitro renal cell lines, genetic, and murine in vivo renal injury models were examined. Among tissues tested, Gdf11 was highest in normal adult mouse kidney. Expression was increased acutely after 5/6 nephrectomy, ischemia-reperfusion injury, kanamycin toxicity, or unilateral ureteric obstruction. Systemic, high-dose GDF11 administration in adult mice led to renal failure, with accompanying kidney atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of renal tubular cells, and eventually death. These effects were associated with phosphorylation of SMAD2 and could be blocked by follistatin. In contrast, Gdf11 heterozygous mice showed reduced renal Gdf11 expression, renal fibrosis, and expression of fibrosis-associated genes both at baseline and after unilateral ureteric obstruction compared with wild-type littermates. The kidney-specific consequences of GDF11 dose modulation are direct effects on kidney cells. GDF11 induced proliferation and activation of NRK49f renal fibroblasts and also promoted epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of IMCD-3 tubular epithelial cells in a SMAD3-dependent manner. Taken together, these data suggest that GDF11 and its downstream signals are critical in vivo mediators of renal injury. These effects are through direct actions of GDF11 on renal tubular cells and fibroblasts. Thus, regulation of GDF11 presents a therapeutic target for diseases involving renal fibrosis and impaired tubular function. Copyright Â© 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

So we compared time to all-cause mortality among older adults with kidney failure treated vs. not treated with chronic dialysis. Our retrospective cohort study used linked administrative and laboratory data to identify adults aged 65 or more years of age in Alberta, Canada, with kidney failure (2002-2012), defined by two or more consecutive outpatient estimated glomerular filtration rates less than 10 mL/min/1.73m 2 , spanning 90 or more days. We used marginal structural Cox models to assess the association between receipt of dialysis and all-cause mortality by allowing control for both time-varying and baseline confounders. Overall, 838 patients met inclusion criteria (mean age 79.1; 48.6% male; mean estimated glomerular filtration rate 7.8 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). Dialysis treatment (vs. no dialysis) was associated with a significantly lower risk of death for the first three years of follow-up (hazard ratio 0.59 [95% confidence interval 0.46-0.77]), but not thereafter (1.22 [0.69-2.17]). However, dialysis was associated with a significantly higher risk of hospitalization (1.40 [1.16-1.69]). Thus, among older adults with kidney failure, treatment with dialysis was associated with longer survival up to three years after reaching kidney failure, though with a higher risk of hospital admissions. These findings may assist shared decision-making about treatment of kidney failure. Crown Copyright Â© 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Identification of patients who will progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) might allow not only the implementation of kidney protective measures but also simultaneous kidney transplant. Retrospective cohort study in adults who underwent LTx at a single center. ESRD, death, and composite of ESRD or death were studied outcomes. 331 patients, who underwent LTx, were followed up for 2.6 Â± 1.4 years; 31 (10%) developed ESRD, 6 (2%) underwent kidney transplant after LTx and 25 (8%) remained on chronic hemodialysis. Patients with preoperative eGFR lesser than 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 had a 4-fold increased risk of developing ESRD after adjustment for sex, diabetes mellitus, APACHE II score, use of nephrotoxic drugs, and severe liver graft failure (HR = 3.95, 95% CI 1.73, 9.01; p = 0.001). Other independent risk factors for ESRD were preoperative diabetes mellitus and post-operative severe liver graft dysfunction. These findings emphasize low eGFR prior to LTx as a predictor for ESRD or death. The consideration for kidney after liver transplant as a treatment modality should be taken into account for those who develop chronic kidney failure after LTx.\n\nMood, body image, fear of kidney failure, life satisfaction, and decisional stability following living kidney donation: Findings from the KDOC study.\n\nPubMed\n\nRodrigue, J R; Schold, J D; Morrissey, P; Whiting, J; Vella, J; Kayler, L K; Katz, D; Jones, J; Kaplan, B; Fleishman, A; Pavlakis, M; Mandelbrot, D A\n\n2018-06-01\n\nPrior studies demonstrate that most living kidney donors (LKDs) report no adverse psychosocial outcomes; however, changes in psychosocial functioning at the individual donor level have not been routinely captured. We studied psychosocial outcomes predonation and at 1, 6, 12, and 24Â months postdonation in 193 LKDs and 20 healthy controls (HCs). There was minimal to no mood disturbance, body image concerns, fear of kidney failure, or life dissatisfaction, indicating no incremental changes in these outcomes over time and no significant differences between LKDs and HCs. The incidence of any new-onset adverse outcomes postdonation was as follows: mood disturbance (16%), fear of kidney failure (21%), body image concerns (13%), and life dissatisfaction (10%). Multivariable analyses demonstrated that LKDs with more mood disturbance symptoms, higher anxiety about future kidney health, low body image, and low life satisfaction prior to surgery were at highest risk of these same outcomes postdonation. It is important to note that some LKDs showed improvement in psychosocial functioning from pre- to postdonation. Findings support the balanced presentation of psychosocial risks to potential donors as well as the development of a donor registry to capture psychosocial outcomes beyond the mandatory 2-year follow-up period in the United States.

We present the case of two renal transplantations from a polytraumatized 20-years old donor with acute renal failure requiring dialysis. One recipient established good diuresis from the first post-transplant day and did not require hemodialysis. The second recipient had delayed graft function and was treated with 8 hemodialysis sessions. The patient was discharged with good diuresis and normal serum creatinine. After two years of follow-up, both recipients have normal graft function. According to our experience, kidneys from deceased young donors with acute renal failure requiring dialysis may be transplanted, in order to decrease the number of patients on transplantation waiting lists.\n\nEpidemiology and Outcome of Acute Kidney Injury According to Pediatric Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Criteria in Critically Ill Children-A Prospective Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nVolpon, Leila C; Sugo, Edward K; Consulin, Julio C; Tavares, Tabata L G; Aragon, Davi C; Carlotti, Ana P C P\n\n2016-05-01\n\nWe aimed to investigate the epidemiology, risk factors, and short- and medium-term outcome of acute kidney injury classified according to pediatric Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease, and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria in critically ill children. Prospective observational cohort study. Two eight-bed PICUs of a tertiary-care university hospital. A heterogeneous population of critically ill children. None. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were collected on all patients admitted to the PICUs from August 2011 to January 2012, with at least 24 hours of PICU stay. Of the 214 consecutive admissions, 160 were analyzed. The prevalence of acute kidney injury according to pediatric Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria was 49.4% vs. 46.2%, respectively. A larger proportion of acute kidney injury episodes was categorized as Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stage 3 (50%) compared with pediatric Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease F (39.2%). Inotropic score greater than 10 was a risk factor for acute kidney injury severity. About 35% of patients with acute kidney injury who survived were discharged from the PICU with an estimated creatinine clearance less than 75âmL/min/1.73 m and one persisted with altered renal function 6 months after PICU discharge. Age 12 months old or younger was a risk factor for estimated creatinine clearance less than 75âmL/min/1.73 m at PICU discharge. Acute kidney injury and its severity were associated with increased PICU length of stay and longer duration of mechanical ventilation. Eleven patients died; nine had acute kidney injury (p < 0.05). The only risk factor associated with death after multivariate adjustment was Pediatric Risk of Mortality score greater than or equal to 10. Acute kidney injury defined by both pediatric Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease and Kidney Disease\n\nAcute Kidney Injury Enhances Outcome Prediction Ability of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score in Critically Ill Patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChang, Chih-Hsiang; Fan, Pei-Chun; Chang, Ming-Yang; Tian, Ya-Chung; Hung, Cheng-Chieh; Fang, Ji-Tseng; Yang, Chih-Wei; Chen, Yung-Chang\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIntroduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and also often part of a multiple organ failure syndrome. The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score is an excellent tool for assessing the extent of organ dysfunction in critically ill patients. This study aimed to evaluate the outcome prediction ability of SOFA and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score in ICU patients with AKI. Methods A total of 543 critically ill patients were admitted to the medical ICU of a tertiary-care hospital from July 2007 to June 2008. Demographic, clinical and laboratory variables were prospectively recorded for post hoc analysis as predictors of survival on the first day of ICU admission. Results One hundred and eighty-seven (34.4%) patients presented with AKI on the first day of ICU admission based on the risk of renal failure, injury to kidney, failure of kidney function, loss of kidney function, and end-stage renal failure (RIFLE) classification. Major causes of the ICU admissions involved respiratory failure (58%). Overall in-ICU mortality was 37.9% and the hospital mortality was 44.7%. The predictive accuracy for ICU mortality of SOFA (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves: 0.815Â±0.032) was as good as APACHE III in the AKI group. However, cumulative survival rate"
