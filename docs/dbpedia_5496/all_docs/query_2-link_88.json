A broader view and more collaboration between disciplines is required.\n\nAdvancing ocean equity at the nexus of development, climate and conservation policy\n\nAchieving inclusive and sustainable ocean economies, long-term climate resilience and effective biodiversity conservation requires urgent and strategic actions from local to global scales. We discuss fundamental changes that are needed to allow equitable policy across these three domains.\n\nJoachim Claudet\n\nJessica Blythe\n\nJosheena Naggea\n\nWill AI accelerate or delay the race to net-zero emissions?\n\nAs artificial intelligence transforms the global economy, researchers need to explore scenarios to assess how it can help, rather than harm, the climate.\n\nAmy Luers\n\nJonathan Koomey\n\nEric Horvitz\n\nWe must protect the global plastics treaty from corporate interference\n\nA United Nations-backed agreement to end plastic pollution is within reach — but only if scientists, civil society and businesses unite against powerful vested interests.\n\nMartin Wagner\n\nUN plastics treaty: don’t let lobbyists drown out researchers\n\nTackling plastic pollution needs scientists to be in the negotiating room at upcoming talks.\n\nLeveraging epidemic network models towards wildfire resilience\n\nWildfires have increased in frequency and intensity due to climate change and have had severe impacts on the built environment worldwide.

Multi-drug resistant strains which do not respond to first-line antibiotics continue to emerge, putting at risk numerous public health strategies which aim to reduce incidence and mortality. Here, we speak with Professor Valerie Mizrahi, world-leading researcher and former director of the Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine at the University of Cape Town, regarding the tuberculosis burden in South Africa. We discuss the challenges faced by researchers, the lessons that need to be learnt and current innovations to better understand the overall response required to accelerate progress.\n\nA 2023 hurricane caught Mexico off guard: we must work together to prepare better\n\nHurricane Otis yields lessons for researchers and policymakers on how to reduce risks in the face of inequality.\n\nGian C.

The majority of the world’s ocean-dependent people live in low to middle-income countries in the tropics (i.e., the ‘tropical majority’). Yet the ocean governance agenda is set largely on the basis of scientific knowledge, funding, and institutions from high-income nations in temperate zones. These externally driven approaches undermine the equity and effectiveness of current solutions and hinder leadership by the tropical majority, who are well positioned to activate evidence-based and context-specific solutions to ocean-sustainability challenges. Here, we draw together diverse perspectives from the tropics to propose four actions for transformational change that are grounded in perspectives, experiences, and knowledge from the tropics: 1. Center equity in ocean governance, 2. Reconnect people and the ocean, 3. Redefine ocean literacy, and 4. Decolonize ocean research. These actions are critical to ensuring a leading role for the tropical majority in maintaining thriving ocean societies and ecosystems.\n\nAna K.
