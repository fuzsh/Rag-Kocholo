        "text": "Strenuous research has been done on pattern recognition and a huge number of research works have been published on this topic during the last few decades. The Indian ancient scripts are a golden treasure of not only Asian continent, but also the whole world. Many researchers and an organizations still working on the appropriate character recognition of Indian ancient scripts. This paper presents some research work that has been significant in the area of pattern recognition and also highlights the review of existing work done on the Indian ancient scripts. The purpose of this research work is to study the appropriate identification of the Indian ancient script using pattern recognition techniques. We have studied the different pattern recognition techniques and its categorized steps. In current research work we have used MODI script. Modi is Indian ancient script which is normally preferred in western and southern part of India. This paper shows the importance of MODI script and by using technique of pattern recognition we transliterate into the readable and an audible format for visually impaired people. The review is categorized into four sections. The Section 1 present the Background of Research paper, Section 2 covers the introduction part of MODI Script, Braille Script and Pattern Recognition Technique’s, which are the primary part of our research, Section 3 describe the review of literature, and at the end in Section 4 we conclude the paper."
