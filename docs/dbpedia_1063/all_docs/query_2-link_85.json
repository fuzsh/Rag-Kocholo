        "text": "Powered by donors, partnerships, and technology\n\nThe pace of translation is accelerating, due to partnerships and technology, all powered by visionary donors.\n\nToday we are collaborating more widely than ever, working with other translation agencies as part of Every Tribe Every Nation Collective Impact Alliance (ETEN). Meanwhile, growing momentum in Bible translation is also due to developments in translation software, and digital library technology, all of which is shared by everyone involved in Scripture translation.\n\nFollowing the Bible Translation Roadmap\n\nThis generation has the greatest opportunity ever seen in translation â€“ Pi.\n\nTo reduce Bible poverty, CBS joins the worldwide network of Bible Societies in continuing to push forward with the Bible Translation Roadmap, a 20-year vision unveiled in 2018, aiming to:\n\n> complete 1,200 translations and revisions by 2038\n\n> give to over 600 million more people, first-time access to the Scriptures in their own language.\n\nBy 2033, CBS, other Bible Societies, the ETEN Alliance and numerous other translation agencies envision all people having some access to the Word of God in their own language:\n\nDigital Bible Library adds Braille Scriptures\n\nCBS provides support each year to the Digital Bible Library, which makes translated Bible texts available to the translation world. In 2020, new Braille transcription software allowed the addition of the first Braille Scripture files to the Library, making it much faster for Bible Societies to produce Braille Scripture.\n\nAt the start of 2021, the Library contained:\n\n2,696 texts in 1,721 languages used by six billion people.\n\n53 Braille files in 41 languages, including 33 full Bibles in 27 languages.\n\nAudio Scriptures in the languages of 5.6 billion people.\n\nVideo Scriptures in 13 sign languages used by 1.8 million people."
