        "text": "Hi Billinghurst!\n\nHow I'm haven't permission to view the filter 214, I'm contacting you (the last to edit it). We have some problems with the filter 214 on ptwikipedia, with many users reporting problems to edit because of it. This is an example. What the problem with that edit?\n\nHappy new year! !Silent (talk)\n\n@!Silent: it isn't my filter, it is the stewards particularly . I have made it local only, and suggest that you follow up with them, it isn't one that I follow. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nThanks Billinghurst! !Silent (talk)\n\n@!Silent: After looking at this situation without a tired head, my reflections … This filter's update in November and operations following were below the standard expected for the communities. rate of change indicates that increase rate, and for the target of the filter that is way out of expections. In defence of the situation, global filters logs are often very busy here, and filtering down to filter level can sometimes be not be undertaken sufficiently in the busy world, or not suitably see the impacts at a local level as well as you can. (meta view of ptWP 214 and ptWP view of global-214). Noting that I forget what you can and cannot see, as it is a long time since I have no or limited rights and views.\n\nIt is my opinion that the naming or tagging of the filter didn't (and still doesn't) provide suitable information to communities to be able to know what was going on, being targeted or how it should be managed. Further that nobody in your community had any vision of the filter, or anything interpretative to be able to provide comment, feedback or anything useful to provide feedback. I believe that there are reasonable solutions to this issue.\n\nI would encourage your community to consider (discuss?) how stewards and meta administrators can provide a better service with regard to global abusefilters; also to consider how your (local) community could have better ability to understand and address the negative impacts and false positives of filters (whilst still maintaining the required security), and maybe try to address such components at Stewards' noticeboard in a helpful and solutions-focused manner. If your community does have a discussion I can provide comment or further information, though my knowledge of Portuguese is limited to the word \"Leste\" and I rely on Google Translate, though that can often be suitable.\n\nI hope that helps and we can generate something better. — billinghurst sDrewth 00:51, 5 January 2020 (UTC)\n\nAfter deleting a bot created Commons user page I decided to run the link through COI. You know how sometimes you wish you hadn't started something!! Do you know anything about issuu.com? There are literally 1000s of links and the site - I guess - seems ok. Weirdly the userpage link didn't actually connect to anything on there. Ho hum. Cheers --Herby talk thyme\n\nCOIBot and Commons are a mystery to me how or what it actually sees. I think that there is a relationship invloving the moon, solar flares, day of the week / divided by the month to the inverse power of the year, multiplied by the number of newbies x 1/number of wikis. Don't quote me exactly, there may be an exponential factor applied to one of those. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nIt seems you are the title blacklist expert! Maybe you can help me. Until phab:T238285 is resolved, we should prevent creation of accounts that end in a semicolon, since the path-style links to the users won't work (e.g. w:Special:Contributions/Printf(\"Herro_World\"); vs using a query string). It seems Title blacklist is the right place to do this. I did some testing at testwiki:MediaWiki:Titleblacklist but nothing worked. I would guess an entry like User:.*;$ <newaccountonly|errmsg=titleblacklist-forbidden-new-account-semicolon> would do the trick? MediaWiki:Titleblacklist-forbidden-new-account-semicolon hasn't been created yet, by the way. I figure we should tell the user they have to chose a username that doesn't end in a semicolon, rather than show the generic message. Any assistance is appreciated. Best, — MusikAnimal talk\n\n@MusikAnimal: [Oh dear, seriously troublesome when a nuffy like me is considered an expert from simple action repetition.] I would think that it would work though I have never tried terminating characters it is usually somewhere regex for me. Also I have not looked at xwiki errmsg'ing, wouldn't a local MW msg require the person to be creating here, and wonder whether that would need to be something set as a global msg with default text (and delivered through translatewiki). An alternative would be to use an abusefilter as done at Special:AbuseFilter/173, though again that has a generic message as it is xwiki, and we just have the one global msg. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nI did test some of the global rules with a custom errmsg on testwiki and the message showed up undefined, so you're probably right. I guess let's just use the default message, as hopefully this bug will be fixed soon. I'm confident in my regex, but I couldn't get anything to work on testwiki, which gave me pause. For instance I was able to create User:Test20200121 despite testwiki:Special:Diff/412928. Does User:.*;$ <newaccountonly> look right to you? Maybe I should just go for it? I'll of course test immediately and revert if something looks off. Also, do you know why the title blacklist log is empty? — MusikAnimal talk\n\n@MusikAnimal: Email being prepared, soon to be coming. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nThe Original Barnstar You're the best 107.77.173.58\n\nHi. Did anything end up happening with the ASBS notes? Should I file a request at Meta:Requests for deletion#Requests for undeletion? --Yair rand (talk)\n\n@Yair rand: There is content at Affiliate-selected Board seats/2019/notes that is subsequent to the deletions. Whether it is sufficient, I am loathe to comment. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nHi Billinghurst, these three accounts slipped through the blacklist, would appreciate if you can tweak it. Thanks. Minorax (talk)\n\nHi. For LTAs, there are always those that get through the blacklist, it is too easy to circumvent for a determined user. The listings that I do are primarily to stop reasonable imitations, not to stop the LTA; trying to do that game is just feeding the troll. There are better means to inhibit the LTA, or to quickly respond.\n\nTo note that the best spot for requests to be put is Talk:Title blacklist it means that any admin can manage them, and allows for good process. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nHi,\n\nCould you please replace \"utili1sateur\" with \"utilisateur\" in Special:AbuseFilter/181? The typo was introduced in Special:AbuseFilter/history/181/diff/prev/2814 and prevents all new users from writing on the page (the id gets obsolete every month because the page is archived by renaming).\n\nThanks,\n\nOrlodrim (talk)\n\n@Orlodrim: Done Ugh, not certain how I picked up that typo. I have also updated the filter for the page archiving. Noting that I am still awaiting the update to the abuse filters of the ability to filter based on wiki, which will be the best way to exclude frWP for Lomita's pages. Maybe soon. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nHello, thanks for the message on my talk page. Yes, I know that I should educate myself and I will do it in the future. Best regards, Zoranzoki21 (talk) .\n\nIs there any way to automatically find this crap (I presume this is global)? This has been going on for .. years? --Dirk Beetstra T C (en: U, T)\n\n@Beetstra: toollabs:global-search/ so livetvstrem.com search. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nI was more thinking of an abusefilter. We've been seeing a lot of this crap where the beginning of the article or a section is spammed with a link. Many of them are blacklisted on en. --Dirk Beetstra T C (en: U, T)\n\nNo idea. I would have thought that if it is problematic that enWP would have been first to find it, and to fix it. I would think that it is a more mature spamming / editing rather than a naive attempt by spambots. It is presumably a WP thing long, it isn't something that I see at the sister wikis like WSes, Commons, Meta or WD. Once they publish the abusefilter update that allows filters to pick WPs, then it might be something to consider. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nHi there,\n\nI saw you used COIBot many times, so I was wondering if you might know the answer to this. A series of accounts tried to spam several SEO ad farm-like urls on nl:wikt yesterday. We manually compiled a list of domains to search for any other spam attempts that may have gone unnoticed, but it is not unlikely that they will create more of such domains in the future. Most of these domains are hosted on 3 or 4 servers with nothing else on it, and I noticed that COIBot does do something with the hosting ip. Do you know if it is possible to add those to the monitoring list so it also reports any spam attempts with new domains hosted on those servers? Or does it not work that way? Where would we do that? Sumurai8 (talk)\n\nHi @Sumurai8: No, COIBot is not able to proactively monitor new domain names based on their creation, ie. that we constantly reverse DNS an IP address to get domains hosted. I have talked to Beetstra whether it is possible to monitor based on an underlying IP address appearing in a report (... long story ...), and at this time, the best we can do is look at the WhatLinksHere through the \"track\" in the IP part of a XWiki bot report, eg. in the following report User:COIBot/XWiki/oefentoets.nl see the IP section\n\n91.208.60.138 (LinkSearch: meta s/meta | en s/en | es s/es | de s/de | fr s/fr | ru s/ru | zh s/zh | simple s/simple | c s/c | d s/d | Wikipedias: top 20 · 40 · major wikis · gs ) (Reports: Report <-track | XWiki | Local | en | find entry) (DomainTools: whois | AboutUs | Malware? | Alexa)(Search: Google | en (G) | fr (G) | de (G) | meta (G) | backlinks | → links ←)\n\nIt would be great if we could reactively push an IP and say run all the crap that relates to this IP, but that is lots of grunt and collection.\n\nTo further assist, you can run some searches for contents of COIBot reports—I have search engine forms on my user page—so you something like \"91.208.60.138\" COIBot/Xwiki and \"91.208.60.138\" all COIBot\n\nIf you are in IRC with a cloak, do note that you can sit in and there are queries available, see Small Wiki Monitoring Team/IRC.\n\nIf you are casual spambot-fighter, please feel welcome to just put request on Poke's talk page in {{XWikiSummary}} and ping Herbythyme, myself, or your trained administrator/steward/... as we are normally going to be online during a day. If you are monitoring a lot of spam-type activity there is also scope to grant access to Poke.\n\nIf you just have a big list of crap that we are going to head straight to blacklisting, then just collectively add them to one request at Talk:Spam blacklist using {{LinkSummary}}. That becomes an easy task to process AND it will generate the COIBot reports. — billinghurst sDrewth 02:05, 16 February 2020 (UTC)\n\n@Sumurai8: what we currently can do is to ask COIBot to save a linkreport for the IP, like has been done for the server 91.208.60.138. That report then contains all the domains that have been added to Wikipedia (in this case 3), and all additions. COIBot does not detect whether other domains on the server exist (that would be work for a reverse DNS, which is linked from the linksummary template'). There is no reason why we couldn't run a report-request on a regular basis. I will add you to the list of users who are allowed to use the /Poke-functionality. --Dirk Beetstra T C (en: U, T)\n\nThank you both for your help :-) Sumurai8 (talk)\n\nThere is a typo in one regex – it should be \\blyricstranslate\\.com/ru/pechkurov-aleksej instead of \\blyricstranslate.\\com/ru/pechkurov-aleksej (the dot should be escaped). --jdx Re:\n\nDone 👍 — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nI take it it has quarantined itself just in case...? Nothing much seems to be happening --Herby talk thyme\n\n<shrug> ping Beetstra — billinghurst sDrewth\n\n@Herbythyme: It's baaaaaaack. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nHappy for you to leave them there if the bot is not playing along. I just grab them and push them through manually, which is never a fuss. I have grabbed these from the history, — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nHey, is this a mistake? Minorax (talk)\n\nYes, of course, thanks. <deskthunk> — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nHi, Billinghurst. Here we have that WMF-banned editor. This account has no edits in any wikispace, but he sends hate e-mails [2]. That account should be globally banned. If WMF requires, I can forward them the hate content sent via e-mail. Kubura (talk)\n\n(saw this by chance)\n\nHi, I just locked this account (Hasley reported it at Steward requests/Global) :-) Regards --Schniggendiller (talk)\n\n@Kubura: Whilst I can try to help, the stewards are the best to be able to assist in this regard. If it is a problem doing it in the open at Meta, or directly with a steward, do remember that you can email them at stewards wikimedia.org — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nSee the xwiki contribs of 102.42.38.92. Could you please update Special:AbuseFilter/202 and add the range 102.42.0.0/16? --WhitePhosphorus (talk)\n\nDone @WhitePhosphorus: — billinghurst sDrewth\n\n@Billinghurst: My user page was deleted by you. I try to spend more time on contribution and wanted User page to come up slowly over a period. Kindly let know if I am not supposed to maintain my User Page or if there is a specific criteria? Regards -PBT PayBackThyme (talk)\n\n[3] Kubura (talk)\n\nThe same as this one [4]. Kubura (talk)\n\n@Kubura: I haven't been either a steward or a checkuser for years, so the best you can get from me is sympathy on non-global wikis, and on global wikis some assistance with abuse filters. If we have a xwiki pest you will need to have it resolved by local checkusers and more broadly by stewards. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nThanks. Where is a page on Meta where I can report his IP and new account actions? Kubura (talk)\n\nFor stewards it will be one of SN or SRG depending on what you are trying to achieve. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nHello, I removed an external reference Dead Link from Karen Horney Quotes page and added a working Karen Horney Quote External Link but you have removed it and marked as \"unreliable source\".\n\nI think it is better to have a working Karen Horney Quote External Link instead of an external Dead Link again at Karen Horney Quotes.\n\nIs this a reliable external link on Architecture ? If these types of too many external links are valid on Wikipedia then why not other working Karen Horney Quote External Link ?\n\nIt shows 74 links by \"brainyquote\" and that are \"reliable\" on all the pages but when I added three links that all are marked as \"unreliable source\" and removed.\n\nCould you please answer to this? Template:Ping Billinghurst\n\nThanks. — The preceding unsigned comment was added by Ayaz.ashraf (talk)\n\n@Ayaz.ashraf: I am not here to argue about others use of other unreliable sources, this is not a comparative game of \"whataboutism\". Your proposed site is unreliable and out of scope. You also are repeatedly just adding the one unreliable source. I would suggest that you look to do the work for the original sources of the statements, which will make quality additions within the scope of the site, not unreliable additions which do not much add value to the site. Lift your goals to develop an authoritative product. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\n@Billinghurst: Thank you for the quick reply.\n\nHi Billinghurst, would you please state your rationale for these deletions at Template talk:Main Page/WM News? EllenCT (talk)\n\nChill your jets. Give someone an opportunity to type some paragraphs. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nCould you please clarify? I don't understand whether you have any objections independent of the discussion which has already taken place. There is a March 16 deadline for comments on the item. Please accept my apologies if I seem to be hasty. EllenCT (talk)\n\nAn administrator has said that they consider this contentious information for our main page; and this is text on the main page being discussed. When I have time to consider it and make comment, then I may, or I might keep neutral. At this point, I am returning to the status quo. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nDo you agree that the information is contentious; if so, in what way? EllenCT (talk)\n\nNow you are being pushy. Uncool. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nPlease excuse my pushiness. EllenCT (talk)\n\nHello. Please comment your decision: [5]. To whom is it adressed? --Derslek (talk)\n\n@Derslek: My closing statement is addressed to the readers of Wikimedia Forum and those who have commented\n\nThe facts, as the parties see it, have been expressed.\n\nThere is some general commentary.\n\nThat forum seems to have exhausted its ability to act.\n\nIf you think that there is a further requirement of the community, then the typical means to address some such specific matters is a request for comment. The forum has no further ability than to direct you to your options. The alternate is you address it directly to the stewards as they have acted and only they have the means to further act, use special:emailuser/stewards for that contact. — billinghurst sDrewth 20:33, 1 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nIt's did not explained on what basis I was expelled from the Tatar Wikipedia. There must be an explanation for everything and there must be Consensus on every desicion. Is not it? --Derslek (talk)\n\nDiscussion has been had on the page, and it is not the place for further conversation. I have suggested means to progress if you believe that there is more to do. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\n--Alaa :)..!\n\n@علاء: for creating a report, and from the report we can use the SBL gadget to easily blacklist. Beetstra or I can grant you that access if you wish to add domains for checking, and I am happy to take instructional remarks. I leave such comments all the time. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nHello @Billinghurst:. Thanks a lot, and yes if you can grant me this access it'll be too helpful to me, as there's a lot of Arabic spam websites that need to be listed. Thanks on advance --Alaa :)..!\n\n@علاء: Done, though it will be slow to take effect. If you think there is value in having a local page at your wiki to report matters with local control and local access, as we do with user:COIBot/Poke, then chat with Beetstra, otherwise have fun at poke adding away. Generally for a xwiki report, I use {{XWikiSummary}} at Poke. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nFurther, for the domain aliqtisadi.com there are too many hits in the history to generate a report, and I think that a request for a blacklisting should go via talk:spam blacklist. Beetstra are you able to purge the data for that domain as user:COIBot/XWiki/aliqtisadi.com says too many reports, though it seems that there have just been so many equivalent deletions as the not enormous numbers online. @Praxidicae: I think that we have an Arabic language equivalent of junk news sites we have been noting at enWP. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nThanks Billinghurst. I opened SBL request. When I found new links I'll put it on User:COIBot/Poke, and probably after few months we can make local page (need good community arrangements). Thanks again --Alaa :)..!\n\nummm... --Alaa :)..!\n\nThat talk page is controlled by many and has criteria for blacklisting. Based on its use I don't see that I have the ability to blacklist the url based on one request, no community support, and without seeing evidence of conflict of interest editing. All I can do is let the community reach a consensus. If you believe that it needs to be unarchived, and conversation continued, then feel welcome to bring it back. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nHi, I'm sysop on the french Wikinews. I reverted your delete request because it's not clear that the page is a spam. But if you have informations I dont know, could you enlighten me on this? --SleaY (talk)\n\n@SleaY: It is a spambot. I had marked 5-10 xwiki, deleted about another 10, and added the repeating component to an existing global abuse filter. Up to you what you do with it, but it is the edit of a spambot. I think that my experience and reputation around global spam management should be enough of an indication that I know spambots. FWIW I found that spambot back to early 2014 from my searches this week. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nThanks. I'm not questioning your experience (actually, I don't know you). I'm just uncomfortable with deleting a page blindly. --SleaY (talk)\n\nInteresting approach though to revert first, and then ask questions second. Always some value in checking people's rights and credentials, and Special:CentralAuth from any wiki is a great place to do that. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nThanks for the advice again. I don't want to be confrontational. I deleted dozens of pages flaggued as a been created by a spambot because it was clear that thoses pages was spam. But it usual on all wikimedia projects I know to remove a deleting request when it does not clearly satisfies criteria for speedy deletion. Also, the simple fact that you are a \"high graded\" user on wikimedia projects don't make things clear. But your answers make me believe that yours actions are not often questionned by a \"litle\" sysop like me. So I understand why you did that. --SleaY (talk)\n\n@SleaY: Apologies if I came across in a way that was seeming superior, that was not my intention. You are probably right that I am not often queried on my labelling of spambots, my muddy footprints have been on WMF wikis for years, through stewardry, and later roles. That said, I value and rank the work of all administrators equally, well I try to, and I was truly trying to provide a useful link that I regularly use when looking for user's crosswiki contributions and credentials. I have no issue being questioned on my actions, and it is right of you to challenge me if you think that I am acting that way. 👍 I did feel it a little unusual the order that you took, though you did end up here questioning the page, so all is good. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nHi! The IRC channel where I'd usually ask COIBot to make an XWiki report doesn't seem to work anymore; how do you request COIBot make reports? Regards, Vermont (talk)\n\n@Vermont: It is responding, though very tardily. I had a 12 hours response in IRC to a command yesterday. It is just working through backlogs at this time following a change to how some people scheduled jobs so that meant a lot of bots started to get monitored again. :-( Patience is all I can suggest. Beetstra is watching it, and I am guessing fiddling with the feeds. I can see it rolling through files, though don't have a count of number, so it may be a couple of days, it could be a week. When I have a chance to dig further, then I will. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nFYI I've unblocked User:Hasley - I assume the block as an open proxy or zombie was a mistake? Either way, thought I should inform you that I reverted your administrator action. --DannyS712 (talk)\n\nUgh! Thanks. <deskthunk> Multitasking fail. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nIt appears that it comes about when I am extending a block and the block link, and the change block vertically align, though with an inopportune latent screen, it bumps down just enough and wham. I have changed the screen width (again) to stop that alignment, will see what else I can do. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nWhen you have a minute :-) could you take a look at this and the associated Xwiki rep. So far so good. And then maybe run this one - spot the difference... So is the bot not working correctly on this one? Equally is the vast amount of link placement appropriate or is it just me? I was hoping I'd find a pattern in the placement but given the bot reports no such luck. Appreciated --Herby talk thyme\n\n@Herbythyme: As I understand it, the reports need a coincidence of the factors mentioned at the top of the reports. When I get an opportunity I will run report xwiki startups.co.uk through IRC, andt this way it ignores the username aspects (see Small Wiki Monitoring Team/IRC for detail). Do note the \"gs\" link in the linksummary templates as that does the globalsearch of usage, and my quick way in now. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nMany thanks. I guess there is the additional - if a site gets that much Wiki exposure is it a legit source or simply cleverly spammed...? Cheers --Herby talk thyme\n\nDon't know, either way it is back to the local wiki level, so suggest it be raised at the forums at enWP where it can be investigated who like to have a full opinion. It isn't ours to bomb. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nquestion Hello I have a problem with the titleblacklist I recently added a regular expression to the \"*.\\bwikibayer\" ... entry, as characters were frequently exchanged. According to the gggg&tbaction=new-account&tbnooverride=1 API test everything should work now, but some accounts through the titleblacklist. Example: \"WikiBayer Report me on Meta\" I prefer not to mente others Accounts now:\n\nregular expression:\n\n.*\\b[vw]iki(\\s|)b[ae](i|y*)[ae]r.* <newaccountonly|antispoof>\n\nDo you know where the problem is?--𝐖𝐢𝐤𝐢𝐁𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫 👤💬\n\n@WikiBayer: There is some quirk in antispoof <-> regex that has not been fully identified/explained. I would suggest having a duplicative approach. Have a standard .*username.* with the antispoof, and have a regex variation without antispoof. For those that sneak through we update the regex. Yes it less than perfect. Generally title blacklist is a rough tool, and the LTA responds to the angst that he sees among people. To me, as long as it is not being seen as representing me as a doppelganger account, then WGAF. I am not going to let a snivelling troll spoil my time. If I need to go and edit and enjoy why I came here for a few days, sweet! Others can manage the trolls for that time. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nThank you I have now removed antispoof and made a second entry--𝐖𝐢𝐤𝐢𝐁𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫 👤💬\n\nHi, also cc Xaosflux.

I will commit to keep what I said and I think that's all he needs to know. — regards, Revi\n\nI have zero issues with administrators taking actions that are the consensus of the community and where the outcomes are neither a surprise nor excessive to manage the situation. If someone wishes to block a long-standing member of the community for an extended period, I believe that they should alert the community to that to confirm their action; or the admin can demonstrate that there is a pre-existing consensus of the community for that sort of action. In this situation with the use of a partial block, it could have been handled without the unintended consequences.\n\nQuestion: who was aware of the extended consequences of a block at meta flowing through to those other services; and where is our documentation for admins and users? I sort of remember though it is not front and centre of my mind. We need to improve that component of our education. [I will state that we rarely do block long-standing community members.] — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nI can't speak for the original block as I'm not TSD; but for me - I don't consider partial block as an option at all, for the reason @ my userpage. — regards, Revi\n\nHi there! I was wondered about this tool. Do this tool also able to block someone from doing any actions in Wikimedia project? There's a case in mswikipedia I don't know how but I think this tool is over response and block in wide range. Most of ip address in Malaysia was blocked and I think it's the filter that block the main ip address that caused the sub-ip address being blocked too. Can it be turn off or slow down it's response? CyberTroopers (talk)\n\nActually I'm not pretty sure yet if it's happens because of this filter or not but someone told me this might be the cause of most blockage among ip user. CyberTroopers (talk)\n\n@CyberTroopers: Yes, global abuse filters are active at msWP, you can see them working at ms:Special:Abuselog. If you are interested in tracking a specific global filter, you can add \"global-nnn\" in the appropriate filter field, similarly if you are wanting to track a specific action that filters are taking. If you have specific concerns about filters, then you can ping me here, or at my talk page at msWP if we need a review. There are options we can take.\n\nIn general we do review actions taken from Special:Abuselog though it can be very busy, and drilling down to a local level to find a false positive is not easy among all the noise. With regard to disallowing edits from IP ranges, that is not usual abusefilters, while possible, we are more likely to log it. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nOh, with regard to IP blocks, that would be left to stewards and visible through special:GlobalBlockList, it is not something that I have seen that we wish to do through filters. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nArt thou Canadian or something? Why art thou reverting my edits on \"O Canada\" articles despite me adding reliable sources and cleaning up the formattings? 196.54.16.251\n\nYour additions are out of scope. Please look to understand the scope of Wikipedias as encyclopaedias, not as hosts for all language translations of the song.

I've noticed that you recently added through d:User:Magnus Manske/authority control.js some new BAV IDs (P8034) using old BAV property (P1017). This is due to a problem of obsolesce in the gadget itself, which has been recently reported but not yet solved. If you want, you can try d:User:Bargioni/moreIdentifiers, which performs the same talk of Magnus's gadget but is kept updated more frequently; it has only a little problem which prevents from adding NUKAT, but all other IDs work well. For any doubt ask me. Thank you very much! --Epìdosis\n\n15:11, 31 August 2020 (UTC)\n\nOne of the Arabic Wikipedia users accessed my account as a user and deleted it !! How is it allowed?

BASEL SANNIB.SANEEB (talk)\n\nNo idea what you are talking about. Any action at arWP will be based on a community consensus, either immediate or through local policy. Take it up at arWP. At arWP I am just a general user and do not participate in the administrative decision-making. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nNow correct me if I am wrong, but if the global community were to desire imposing a global account restriction on slowking4, then the best method to do so would be in a separate RFC. Is that correct? I couldn't help but notice that Requests for comment/Global ban for Poetlister was closed while the Global ban policy still looked like this. Could we not do a similar thing in this case with a new RFC? –MJL ‐Talk‐☖\n\n@MJL: It is my observation that RFCs often meet alternate positions than originally proposed. Cases like this are the exception and rarely would have developed policy and practice in the desired outcomes. The inputs that cause difficulty are known, however, the previous examples of resolution don't exactly fit. The closest that I see would be the cases of User:Thekohser, who was initially banned by fiat of Jimbo, though that was problematic in its implementation; or User:Ottava_Rima who just excelled in picking fights in between their good additions. Usually a problematic user has gone rogue quickly, here we have a demonstration of some restraint.\n\nAn RFC can be an open field where other discussions and policies guide thinking, practice and action. They can be the avenue for a new policy, or revision of other policy. I don't think that it needs a new RFC, it just needs a new re-purposed proposal that is addressing the needs of both parties. Others may disagree and want a new proposal. Gauge the room. An alternative is forming precedent, so iterations may still need to follow. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nCan I ask why you unhid the personal attack at User talk:158.140.169.101? --DannyS712 (talk)\n\nCan I ask why you hid something that mentioned nobody, and after it had already been reviewed. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nIt mentioned a specific user though DannyS712 (talk)\n\nNo comments on the hide / unhide, but to inform that Thegooduser is the username of an user I know. Camouflaged Mirage (talk)\n\nSeems the bot is logged out again ... —Dirk Beetstra T C (en: U, T)\n\n@Beetstra: (had to do it all from my phone) When trying from the console it is trying though spitting back a whole lot of html, which I am guessing is an indication that it isn't logging into metawiki, then it returns a statement that it has logged into enwiki. Did that five times. Stepped through the html to no effect, then did it again and it worked. So I am not certain what is happening that it is not working first time. It took two times yesterday, though I put that down to forgetting to sudo, and doing from my account. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nThat is what it does, it looks if it is logged in by reading a Wikipage, if it is not logged in, it spits that out in completion (for checking), then it does a login-attempt, and repeats. If it is logged in, it will just state that. Ideally, it should just say 'I am logged in'. If something is really wrong, it spits out only the page (then twice per wiki) without confirmation messages.\n\nI wonder what makes it log out all the time ... either WMF is resetting logins, or someone is trying to login (hack?) on-wiki?\n\nI also noticed that XLinkBot keeps crashing, something is not completely right on the box. I have to check. --Dirk Beetstra T C (en: U, T)\n\n@Beetstra: Wonder why it doesn't login though when it is pushed, 5 times seems excessive.\n\nNo issue with enWP, just metawiki.\n\nAnything particular that needs watching for xlinkbot, or pushing? I will pay more attention. Generally when not in front of my home PC then I am not watching, and I rarely fire up my phone for WMF stuff, and from work as it is a PITA due to firewalls and ports, but I can check if really required, but typically I don't IRC from the phone either, so rely on someone to prod me. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nThere is no real hurry, it is just annoying not getting the reports. I think I am in a same situation as you, at work access is limited (except for on-wiki), and doing console through my phone is too annoying.\n\nI will see if I can adapt the script, and make a syslog.login or something to dump all that data instead of to console itself. But lets hope that it is over now. --Dirk Beetstra T C (en: U, T)\n\n@Beetstra: as an FYI COIBot in IRC is listening though not speaking; well, if it is speaking it is many hours later. Is there anything that I can be doing? — billinghurst sDrewth\n\n@Billinghurst: there is something with the box, coibot logging out, being laggy, and xlinkbot crashing.

This isn't about playing games or even w:WP:DENY, I'm treating this no different from spam. I don't DENY spam, I just take out the trash. — Alexis Jazz (talk or ping me)\n\nHi, I had made further tweaks to the filter per RFH report, I will think such a filter to prevent autocreation should be better done via Title Blacklist and even the creation might need to review, per the last few logs, I see some amount of false positive and not much attack usernames in zh being filter-caught. I will think the filter needs more adjustments, specifically do we want to allow \"sex\" (I don't think any username will be productive, but can it be locally handled), I removed \"gay\" per the fact that some usernames might have gay as legit (one example given in change log) and then there are usernames such as ***gay*** (i.e. nothing to do with gay but then gay is within the username - see the filter logs I see some obvious ones). I am keen to disable such a filter and to implement it only in problematic wikis as a local filter. Ideas? Camouflaged Mirage (talk)\n\n@Camouflaged Mirage: If the problem is just Chinese language wikis, then as a temporary measure utilise wiki_language and the problem becomes very limited. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nI recalled rowiki was hit once, but that's quite some time ago.

That is not how democracy works. Chaddy (talk)\n\n@Chaddy: Who aborted anything? There was a request to close.\n\nThe original part of the RFC was a simple question, to which opinion was added. What are you expecting from such an RFC? If you want an RFC with a solid action, then the RFC needs to be scoped to provide an action that the community can demand, and that is the proposal that is advertised to all the wikis. It would be improper to draw any further conclusion from that RFC without a return to all the communities, and a significant rescope of the question. I would suggest that you may be wanting to do something like have a RFC to form a series of requirements to be put to the community-elected board members that the community is consulted on all proposals to rename the movement, etc. The RFC that I closed would certainly scope a proposal and act as a straw poll of the community who is truly interested in the name of the movement. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nI'm not here to discuss with you. I'm here to tell you that you have no right to abort the Rfc. If you want the Rfc to be closed please seek a consensus on the Rfc's talk page. The sentiment is already heated enough in the renaming case. It is not wise to heat it even more. Chaddy (talk)\n\n@Chaddy: I did not abort the RFC. There was a request to close on the page, and taken to SN. The original question was asked and answered. This does not stop any follow up subsequent RFC. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nDo you think you want to be on the Ombuds commitetee??? Another Wiki User the 2nd (talk)\n\nNope.

Would you take a look at SPI. Plus, Mariahicky has been blocked in September 2011, but she is returned to edit after eight years, a message to Anna Frodesiak in Maria's talk page. Although Anna retired in last year April, but Maria wishes Anna for unblock herself. I'm afraid she would repeat the same genre warring. 183.171.115.115\n\nWrong place. That is not my gig and enWP has all the players to work out their actions. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nWould you mind moving the collapsed content to the talk page? I actually wanted to reply, but I don't feel comfortable doing so if it is collapsed. –MJL ‐Talk‐☖\n\nIt is collapsed due to its length. My thoughts about people writing challenging commentary against someone's vote, rather than exploratory questioning, is a separate issue. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nHi there! I kinda need a help of adding legal status in the Wikimedia Community User Group Malaysia infobox. I did add it but seems like it doesn't appear there and I'm not sure if it have relations with the translate code in the template. Can you help me adding them? I'd like to add in the template about the group as non-governmental organization and also it's registration number. Please let me know if you could. Thank you. WAqil (WMYS) (talk)\n\n@WAqil (WMYS): When an edit has been made in a translatable section then it needs to be remarked for translation, which I have done for it to flow through. I should note that the information that you have added would not normally in a translatable section, it is not text that would normally be translated. Usernames are usernames not really variables, and don't need to be translated. Probably chat with who does a lot more of that stuff than me. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nThank you for a quick reply. I've talk to him but he said he's unfamiliar with the template. I don't really know about the translation section. All I want to do is to add \"|legal_status=\" in the infobox but it doesn't pop up. WAqil (WMYS) (talk)\n\nSynchronous pages to have more tools PietDux (talk)\n\nNo idea about what you're talking. I will leave a welcome message on your user talk page which should enable you to find the correct forum for your discussion. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nHello. I'm abuse filter (and sysop) on fr-wiki. I have introduce some emoji in french abuse filter 29 but I think it would be better to only have one filter to survey for this kind of vandalism. Can you add them in global filter 110 ? Supertoff (talk)\n\n@Supertoff: We definitely can add them. I will look when I am not mobile. Thanks for your thoughts, and I will let you know when I am done. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nThanks. Supertoff (talk)\n\n@Supertoff: I have added 🖕🌞🥰۩🚩✅, noting though that this filter only tags, it is a very light filter, and it is focused at main ns. I skipped the card suits and musical notation. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nThanks a lot. I deleted those emoji from our filter. If tagging is not enough, I will reintroduce them. Supertoff (talk)\n\n\"Nothing to do here\"\n\nWhere should i process this? There should be a Judge within wikipedia to Get reaches to a Healthy Wiki project Otherwise i have to Try Social media Alternative way\n\nQuestion is here: There is a wiki project which To its Roots is Biased Other's accounts gets delete Other's changes gets reverse Articles dont Obey wiki laws specially its Neutrality part Moderates are chosen from Biased Guys\n\nIf this sentences are Lie Or if they are True Within Wiki there should be a way to show it Where should i show these proofs that i have? Bigbang2024 (talk)\n\nNo idea about what you are talking. I also don't believe that I am the person to ask. I am just a simple metawiki administrator. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nHi, how are you? I am a checkuser of Wikipedia Lusophone and I observed your performance in the global blacklist. I wonder if you can help me with an unpleasant situation.\n\nIn Brazil, there is a company for the dissemination of \"news\" called Dino. It works by publishing releases in other media. Many texts attest that the company does not check the published content, being a mere \"retransmitter\". The company also remains active in numerous media, some of which are renowned.\n\nTherefore, the situation is that dozens of unreliable and paid sources are added to Wikipedia either by spammers or by lay people who believe that that promotion is in fact news. I wonder if it would be a case of adding the domains to the global blacklist. It is clear that the source has more use in the Portuguese-speaking Wikipedia, but that it is also used in others, in particular: English and Spanish.\n\nGreetings. Edmond Dantès d'un message?\n\n@Conde Edmond Dantès: The process is to add the proposal to talk:spam blacklist with each domain name in a {{LinkSummary}} with the discussion that you have provided above. COIBot will see the templates and run the analysis pages. If it is evident that there is a xwiki problem then one of the meta admins or stewards will just do it. If there are questions, then we will ask. If we think that it is limited to one wiki then we would suggest local blacklisting. If you regularly running these sort of tracers, then we can teach you how to use COIBot, and/or give you access to request reports, especially useful if you use IRC. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nAddendum. We are well aware of these blackhat spammers/unreliable sources and have been blacklisting numbers through time. The best expert with those is Praxidicae. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nI understand and my initial intention here is to know the procedures of the process. The company's website (dino.com.br) is already on the blacklist of Wikipedia Lusophone; however, the company has many contracts with the media. So the blacklist is useless (inefficient) because there are \"n\" third-party sites paid to transmit the contents of this garbage (to Wikipedia).\n\nI believe that it is indeed a case for the global list simply because a global spammer uses and abuses company calls. As I said, the largest amount is in the Wikipedia Lusophone, but I have already researched and found it in other projects. Edmond Dantès d'un message?\n\n@Conde Edmond Dantès: I have added you to the permissions list to add to User:COIBot/Poke. There if you add using {{LinkSummary}} will run a link report; using {{XWikiSummary}} will do a xwiki report. If COIBot sees a real issue (see criteria at top of each report) it will leave the report open in Category:Open XWiki reports‎‎.\n\nMy action around open reports is that I generally review a couple of times a day, and I may act, or I may leave, or I may refer to admins at the sites. Others reviewing may do similar things, or may not. We always welcome others to see and use COIBot, and if you have a particular need on your wiki, then there is stuff that can be more coordinated. There Beetstra is the master, and me just a drone doing simple tasks. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nHello, thanks for your comments, I edited the article because I checked the page and realized that a lot of information was wrong or incomplete. I can also forward resources to you. Can you help with the correct information sharing here? If I send the resources, can we edit them together? --Jeanvaljean039 (talk)"
