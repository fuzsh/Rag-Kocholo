        "text": "Superbowl Squares for the kids! In an effort to raise money for the Miles for Miracles Team from Boston Children's Hospital for the 2024 Boston Marathon I am lucky to run in, I am doing a Superbowl squares fundraiser to support these brave kids! $20 per square, 50% of the proceeds supports his fundraising goal, and 50% goes to the winners following each quarter ($250 for 1st, 2nd, 3rd quarters and final score). How it works: Once all the squares have been selected, we will randomly pick numbers from 0-9 for each team in the Super Bowl, and assign that number to a particular row or column. These numbers represent the last number in the score of each team. In other words, if the score is AFC 17 - NFC 14, then the winning square is the one with an AFC number of 7, and an NFC number of 4. Since this is a Fund Raiser, 50% of the proceeds will go to the Charity Organization, and the other 50% will be distributed among the Users with a Winning Square. GET STARTED Use the following links to either enter your picks or show the current picks.

You can see the post here: https://shorturl.at/jwBM0 This post got me thinking about the kinds of reactions I typically see in public when a child is distressed and needs comfort. I can think of many examples of folks grumbling, sometimes loudly, about the baby crying on the airplane or the child bawling on the floor at the mall. Instead of seeing a distressed child in need of comfort, or an overwhelmed parent in need of support, they see an opportunity to criticize a stranger's \"poor parenting skills\". What if we replaced reactions of shame/blame with reactions of curiosity and compassion? What if we looked for ways to model the Four Building Blocks of HOPE* in the way we chose to respond to distressed children and overwhelmed parents? What we might see? - We might ASK the parents if they could use a hand. A simple offer of support to parents can help them feel supported instead of judged, which by itself could enable the parent to rally and re-approach their distressed child with renewed energy. This also provides an example to parents that encourages them to view asking for and receiving help with parenting as safe and productive. The Rugged Individualism that American culture is organized around discourages us from asking for outside help, especially in the personal area of raising children. By providing assistance to a parent in need of support, we directly communicate to them that help is available from their community, as well as counteract the shame that we often feel when asking for help. Considering the Four Building Blocks of HOPE, this best supports the building block of Relationships by teaching parents that they can engage in relationship with their community members to receive support in parenting. - We might INTERACT with the distressed child. We could ask about what is upsetting them or distract them with something entertaining. This could help the child refocus on something other than the triggering event, which can help the child begin to calm down. This type of engagement is part of how children learn to self-regulate, which makes this a perfect example of supporting Emotional Growth, one of the Four Building Blocks of HOPE. - We might ENCOURAGE our own children, if they are present, to interact with the distressed child. Children develop self-awareness and self-regulation from interactions with other children. Like the examples above, this strategy could support the Emotional Growth and the Relationship Building Blocks of HOPE. These examples show that there are many opportunities to promote the Four Building Blocks of HOPE. As community members, we ALL have a role to play in supporting Positive Childhood Experiences. *Unfamiliar with the Four Building Blocks of HOPE?

The Braille Crew Socks have the word ‚ÄúInspire‚Äù written in raised braille lettering around the top band, while the braille alphabet covers each sock. John‚Äôs Crazy Socks will donate 10% from the sale of each pair of the Braille Crew Socks to the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind, a Long Island-based national nonprofit that provides guide dogs, free-of-charge, to individuals who are #blind or have low vision. News 12 Long Island devoted over two and a half minutes of media coverage to the introduction of the socks throughout their broadcast day: Preview: https://lnkd.in/ezFhpEux Morning: https://lnkd.in/e492aPuu Evening Segment: https://lnkd.in/eutcYgaC The inspiration for these socks comes from Holly Connor of Clayton, Missouri who submitted a design as part of John‚Äôs Crazy Sock‚Äôs 2023 Autism Can Do Scholarship contest. Holly‚Äôs design earned her a $2,500 scholarship. Holly is both blind and autistic and wanted to raise awareness about the Braille alphabet and her inspirational story. It took the design team months to produce the three-dimensional Braille Crew Socks that accurately represented the braille alphabet. John‚Äôs Crazy Socks tested each prototype for all the features they assess in a typical sock. They also needed to make sure the presentation of the braille alphabet was accurate. The Guide Dog Foundation assisted the organization in this process. #publicrelations #mediarelations #pr #media #longisland #nonprofit #b2cmarketing"
