The most unique feature of the technology is the ability to set each pin to different heights, which enables the display of topographical maps and other graphical elements such as shades and color represented as varying heights of pins that can be readily sensed by the user’s fingers.\n\nConnectable to computers, tablets, smartphones, or the Orion TI-84 Plus Talking Graphing Calculator via a USB port or Bluetooth, its open API allows developers to create apps on any platform to work with the Graphiti. Additionally, an HDMI port allows connection to any device with a video display output, making Graphiti an external tactile display monitor. This enables any device to connect seamlessly to Graphiti. The unit also includes a cursor pad for navigation, and an SD-card slot and USB port to load files for reading and editing in a standalone mode.\n\nGraphiti also features a touch interface to enable the user to “draw” on the display; tracing a shape with a fingertip raises the pins along the path traced. The touch interface allows traditional forms of touch gesture commands such as swipe to scroll. In addition, it enables novel uses such as “pushing” or “nudging” an object on the display to physically move it. Multiple Graphiti units can be connected together to provide complete and immersive interactivity through touch – what is drawn on one unit appears instantly on the other units in tactile form.\n\nThe proprietary technology is fundamentally scalable and enables development of refreshable graphic displays of any size, at a fraction of the cost of graphic displays in the market today. The first model has 2,400 pins in an array of 60 x 40 pins and can be used in a portrait or landscape orientation. Each pin is independently addressable and can also be made to individually “blink” at configurable rates.\n\n“We are tremendously excited about the opportunities Graphiti opens for the blind or visually impaired user. Our Orion family of talking scientific and graphing calculators enabled access to mainstream tools for STEM education for blind and visually impaired students. The Orbit Reader family of braille displays enables access to low-cost braille and literacy. We believe Graphiti will do for graphics what the Orbit Reader 20 did for braille.” said Dr. Gina Spagnoli, Orbit Research’s Founder. “The variable-height capability that our Tactuator technology enables will allow blind users to experience and interact with graphics and visual events like never before – live and in three dimensions, such as when they viewed the total solar eclipse of 2017 in real time on the Graphiti, making it a truly historic event. A blind user is now able to create graphics in digital form, enter them into a computing device, review and edit them, and exchange such graphics with others. To bring this revolutionary product to each and every blind person in the world, we are working with educational institutions and blindness organizations to reduce cost by increasing volumes, with the target of achieving a price point under $5,000.” she added.\n\nWith its ability to interface with computers and smartphones, the Graphiti provides instant tactile access to all forms of graphical information that is available on the internet. It also enables blind students to connect the Graphiti to any instrument that has a video output, including microscopes, telescopes, oscilloscopes and video cameras to provide a tactile depiction of the images and videos in real-time.\n\nIn the classroom, the Graphiti provides the ability to share textbooks with graphical material. It also enables blind students to actively participate in inclusive classrooms and for the first time, visualize the smartboards used in mainstream classrooms. It also allows maps and other diagrams to be labeled with braille text which can pop up dynamically when corresponding areas on the picture are touched.\n\nGraphiti charts the path towards delivering such content instantly without the need for creating tactile graphics on paper. The product also comes with a software program for Windows that provides, for the very first time, a drawing program specifically designed for individuals who are blind and visually impaired.\n\nOrbit Research is accepting orders now for the Graphiti.

People who are deaf and blind typically communicate with others through various means including tactile sign language and often require a trained interpreter since most people are not familiar with such methods. The Orbit Chat system changes this forever by offering a free solution that enables a deafblind person to use their Orbit Reader 20 braille display and an app running on a smartphone or tablet to communicate with a sighted, blind or deaf person. The system can be used in any situation – in public settings such as markets, restaurants and classrooms or in private conversations.\n\nThrough specialized interfaces on Orbit Research’s braille and tactile graphics products, and an app that runs on smartphones or tablets, the system connects via Bluetooth to provide the breakthrough ability to converse using a simple chat-style experience.\n\n“While mobile phones and refreshable braille displays have enabled deafblind people to connect to the digital world, face-to-face communication has remained a challenge. We are thrilled with the introduction of the Orbit Chat. It will be a game-changer for the deafblind community world-wide.” said Akhil Paul, Director of Sense International India, one of the world’s leading organizations working for people with deafblindness\n\n“With the Orbit Chat system, we are excited and humbled to be able to provide the basic facility of communication that most of us take for granted.” said Dr. Gina Spagnoli, Orbit Research’s founder. “With no additional hardware or software to purchase, a deafblind person can utilize her Orbit Reader 20 braille display to engage in conversation with anyone using a smartphone or tablet. Previous solutions cost thousands of dollars and required heavy and cumbersome hardware and even the most basic ones required the use of external keyboards connected to an expensive braille note-taker. Even as a complete communications-only solution, the Orbit Reader 20 coupled with the Orbit Chat app is less expensive than anything else available by an order of magnitude while offering unmatched portability, reliability and ease of use. The Orbit Chat is yet another step in our journey towards a level playing field.”\n\nThe system allows a sighted person to use a familiar chat or messaging user-interface to type messages using the phone or tablet’s on-screen keyboard, which are immediately translated and displayed on the deafblind user’s Orbit Reader 20 device in braille. The deafblind user types her messages in braille using the braille keypad on the Orbit Reader 20 and these are translated to plain text and instantly displayed on the phone or tablet. The app is self-voicing, which allows a blind person to use it to communicate with a deafblind person without needing any special screen-reading software.\n\nThe system also includes other innovative features such as a broadcast mode which allows the deafblind user to send messages to multiple people who have the app installed, the ability to save conversations on the Orbit Reader 20 as well as on the app for later review and a file transfer feature to exchange files between the Orbit Reader 20 and the phone or tablet. The system allows the use of contracted and uncontracted braille in English and offers support for other languages through localization.\n\nThe app is available now for free download from the Google Play Store and the Orbit Research website: http://www.orbitresearch.com/product/orbit-chat\n\nOrbit Research also offers a bundled solution including the Orbit Reader 20, and an Android tablet with the Orbit Chat system pre-installed, providing the most affordable full-featured communication and accessibility solution for people who are deafblind.\n\nAbout Orbit Research:\n\nOrbit Research develops and manufactures innovative and affordable products that enable an independent lifestyle for people who are blind or visually impaired.

It is the first developer and manufacturer of braille displays to support the new standard which eliminates the need for special software or drivers and enables plug-and-play operation between electronic braille displays and devices such as computers and smartphones.\n\nAs an innovator and leader in the field of refreshable braille, Orbit Research was instrumental in proposing the need in the industry for a common and open communication protocol between refreshable braille displays and screen reading software. In collaboration with industry leaders including Apple, Microsoft and Google, Orbit Research and other companies jointly worked towards creating a USB standard that allows braille displays to communicate with screen-reader software on diverse operating systems and hardware platforms. This now minimizes and possibly even eliminates the need for each refreshable braille display to be tested with each screen-reader every time a new version of the software or firmware is released.\n\nOrbit Research today released a software update for its flagship refreshable braille display product, the Orbit Reader 20, making it the first braille display in the world to support the new standard.\n\n“We are very proud to be the first braille display company to implement the new USB standard.” said Dr. Gina Spagnoli, Orbit Research’s founder. “We experienced first-hand the challenges in ensuring smooth interoperability between our first braille display product and screen-readers. The resources required to do this on an ongoing basis are enormous, especially considering the fact that there are over half a dozen popular screen-readers that our products support. Some screen-reader vendors even require substantial fees to be paid for testing compatibility, making interoperability unaffordable for smaller new players in the market who have worked very hard to produce affordable low-cost displays for the first time. We hope that the new standard will encourage more players to enter this field and look forward to the standard being adopted by all screen-reader and operating system vendors. This is yet another step towards making braille affordable for users in developing countries.”\n\nThe updated software for the Orbit Reader 20 can be downloaded from the Orbit Research website https://www.orbitresearch.com and also includes other feature enhancements.\n\nAbout Orbit Research:\n\nOrbit Research develops and manufactures innovative and affordable products that enable an independent lifestyle for people who are blind or visually impaired.

Based on the popular TI-30XS Multiview scientific calculator from Texas Instruments, the Orion TI-30XS represents a breakthrough in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education for students with vision impairment.\n\nToday, millions of scientific calculators are used in classrooms around the world and are an integral part of the high school math and science curriculum. However, the popularity and usefulness of scientific calculators has posed a challenge for students who are visually impaired since advanced models used in classrooms have not been accessible, until now. With the introduction of the Orion TI-30XS MultiView, visually impaired students now have access to the same technology as their peers as they tackle demanding subjects such as algebra, statistics and chemistry.\n\n“For TI, this is about tearing down barriers for students with disabilities and empowering them to overcome challenges and do great things,” said Scott Sedberry, director of North American Business Development for Texas Instruments Education Technology. “The identical functionality of the accessible TI-30XS MultiView enables students with vision impairment to use the same calculator as their classmates, participate in the same curriculum and take advantage of the vast knowledge base and instructional materials that are already available for this technology.”\n\nEducators who tested the calculator with their visually impaired students are eager to put it to use in the classroom. Susan Osterhaus, Statewide Mathematics Consultant at the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired and APH consultant, said, “This is going to be an awesome addition to our math toolbox and I am confident it will help our students learn and understand difficult concepts.”\n\nThe advanced, four-line scientific calculator, with higher-level math and science functionality, is ideal for middle school through college students. A clear, high-quality, recorded voice announces each key and the answer on the display, providing a choice of speech modes for quiet or verbose operation. Students will love the thin, lightweight design, and parents and teachers will love the familiar functionality that makes it easy to help with classwork and homework.\n\n“When students have the right tools to access their curricula, we all benefit,” said Dr. Tuck Tinsley III, president of APH. “This new technology empowers students who are blind and have low vision to reach their full potentials and become the next generation of STEM scholars.”\n\nThe Orion TI-30XS Talking Scientific Calculator may be used on high-stakes exams as an approved accommodation for students who are visually impaired if it is specified in the student’s Individual Education Program (IEP). Check with your school’s assessment coordinator or guidance counselor to determine the guidelines for specific tests.\n\n“The development of the Orion TI-30XS MultiView represents Orbit Research’s continuing commitment to level the playing field for visually impaired and dyslexic students,” said Dr. Gina Spagnoli, Orbit Research’s founder. “Building upon our long-term partnership with Texas Instruments, APH’s vast experience in the development of educational products, and our expertise in adapting mainstream calculators for accessibility, this product is the result of our collaborative efforts to develop game-changing technology.”\n\nThe calculator is available for purchase for the upcoming school year here (http://shop.aph.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_Orion TI-30XS MultiView Talking Scientific Calculator_34678672P_10001_11051)\n\nAbout Texas Instruments:\n\nEducation Technology, a business of Texas Instruments, provides a wide range of tools connecting the classroom experience with real-world applications, helping students and teachers to explore mathematics and science interactively.
