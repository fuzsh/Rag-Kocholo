(Check out both slides!)\n\nThink First & Stay Safe\n\ncreated by Child Lures Prevention\n\nBeginning in mid-September through October, elementary students will receive age appropriate presentations to prevent child abuse and child sexual abuse at each building. The School City of Hobart continues to educate our students how to remain safe and ask for help whenever needed. This is especially true to prevent child abuse and child sexual abuse. Senate Bill 355 requires schools to provide students every year, education for the prevention of child abuse and child sexual abuse. A presenter from Fair Haven will present to the k-5 students the Think First & Stay Safe program. The Think First & Stay Safe program is approved by the Indiana Department of Education.\n\nThis program will presents the 7 Cornerstone Lesson Concepts, in an age-appropriate manner:\n\n(1) Using Our Computer Brains\n\n(2) People are Like the Weather & Trusted Adults\n\n(3) Child Luring: Treat it Like a Fire Drill\n\n(4) Laws Protect & My Body Belongs to Me\n\n(5) Secrets & Listening to Our Instincts\n\n(6) Kindness of People\n\n(7) Dignity: Safe & Healthy Boundaries.\n\nThere are different presentation times for each school. Parent letters will be sent home 3 weeks prior to the presentation. There are training modules that parents can use that coordinate with students lessons. These can be found at https://childluresprevention.com/parent-training-modules.\n\nThe password is 4par3nts .\n\nShould you have any questions, contact the principal or school counselor at your studentâ€™s building.\n\nGrief Resources"
