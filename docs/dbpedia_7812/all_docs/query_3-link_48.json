You've heard all about this magical island, and your phone's gallery is now a treasure trove of Bali's beauty? That's awesome! But hey, if it's your first time setting your sights on Bali, I completely understand – you might have some questions. Even if it's as simple as 'Where is Bali?' – don't worry, that's perfectly okay!\n\nYou've got questions? Well, I've got answers! Consider this your Bali 101 crash course!\n\n1.WHERE IS BALI?\n\nAlright, I can hear you thinking, 'What kind of question is this?' But you'd be surprised to know it's one of the most googled questions worldwide!!\n\nBali, in case you didn't know, it’s an island located Indonesia- right in the heart of South East Asia. And if you're wondering just how close it is to other fantastic places, it's a stone's throw away from the beautiful shores of West Australia and the vibrant cityscape of Singapore\n\n2. WHAT’S THE LANGUAGE IN BALI?\n\nThere are actually two official languages in Bali: Bahasa Indonesia or Indonesian, which is spoken in every island in Indonesia, and Balinese, spoken by the locals on the Island of the Gods (Bali that is).\n\n3. DO PEOPLE IN BALI SPEAK ENGLISH?\n\nYou shouldn’t have any problems getting around and communicating with anyone in Bali! Since tourism is one of the major sources of income in Bali, most of the locals speak a decent amount of English! However, Balinese people really appreciate tourists knowing some basic Balinese words. Learn some easy phrases here:\n\nGood Morning – Selamat Pagi\n\nThank You – Terima Kasih or Suksema\n\nYou’re welcome – Sama sama\n\n4. WHAT’S THE CURRENCY IN BALI?\n\nThe currency used in Bali is the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) and the Indonesian Rupiah is the only currency accepted. However, as Bali receives a lot of tourists on vacation, Australian Dollars (AUD), American Dollars (USD) and Euros (EUR) can be exchanged for IDR on the island.\n\nTo put it into context, 100,000 IDR is roughly worth :\n\n100000 IDR =6,5 ****USD\n\n100000 IDR =6 EUR\n\n100000 IDR =10 Australian dollar\n\nNOTE: the exchange rates are always changing so be sure to check the most up-to-date rates before you go and see the next section for more on this\n\n6. DO YOU NEED A VISA TO GO TO BALI?\n\nYes you do.\n\nAs a tourist you’ll need to get a VISA ON ARRIVAL. A visa on arrival (VOA) is available to citizens of more than 60 countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Visitors from most countries are eligible for a VOA valid for 30 days and can be extended for another 30 days by paying an additional fee.\n\nThe cost of a visa on arrival is +/- USD 35 and you can get it when arriving in Bali - no need to purchase it up front (you can if you want to however) .When you land in Bali, simply go straight to passport control, where your VOA and date will be stamped in your passport.\n\n7. WHAT’S THE RELIGION IN BALI?\n\nBali is like the cool rebel in the Indonesian class. While Indonesia, as a whole, practices Islam, Bali goes, 'Nah, we've got our own thing!'\n\nIn Bali, it's all about 'Balinese Hinduism,' which is a mix of Hinduism, Buddhism, and a dash of Balinese flair.\n\nBut hold on, the plot thickens when you island-hop to places like the Gili Islands or other parts of Indonesia. You see, the rest of Indonesia, including the Gili Island neighbors, is predominantly Muslim.\n\n8. WHAT SHOULD YOU PACK FOR BALI?\n\nLucky you - I’ve created a FREE e-book with packing essentials, which you can download HERE!\n\n9. IS BALI SAFE?\n\nYES, Bali is pretty safe! Also for solo travelers.\n\nHowever, the paradise island is not completely free from safety concerns. With a small threat of natural disasters, scams and out-of-control tourists, there are a few things you should be aware of before traveling to Bali.\n\nKeep the following things in mind and you’ll be fine:\n\nWatch out for street dogs (and monkeys!)\n\nA number of scams and cons aimed at tourists have been known to happen in Bali, such as fake charity programs, overcharging, rigged money changers and unfair haggling at markets.\n\nWatch where you eat to avoid Bali Belly ( click here to see what it is and how to avoid it)\n\nAvoid driving your bike late at night as there are cases of tourist being pushed off their bikes, especially in areas such as Canggu, Berawa and Seminyak\n\nFor female solo travelers: don’t walk alone at night - it’s just common sense\n\nEarthquakes happen but they usually only last a few seconds and are not too bad\n\n10. DO I NEED TO BE VACCINATED TO GO TO BALI?\n\nCovid vaccinations are no longer mandatory.\n\nHowever, it's generally advisable to be up to date on routine vaccinations like measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (Tdap), as well as hepatitis A and typhoid, which can be contracted through contaminated food or water in some regions.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to consider vaccinations or preventive measures for diseases like hepatitis B, Japanese encephalitis, and rabies, depending on your specific travel plans, activities, and the regions you intend to visit within Bali and Indonesia.\n\nCheck with a health professional please. I am not a doctor.\n\n11. HOW MANY DAYS SHOULD YOU GO TO BALI?\n\nDepending on where in the world you live I would advice to stay at least 2 weeks. If you live in south east Asia or West Australia, you can easily go for a long weekend. But for people who are flying in from Europe and the USA, I can only say, stay at the most MINIMUM 10 days. It’s a freaking long flight to get to Bali so anything less than 10 days is a bit of a shame :(\n\n12. IS THERE MALARIA IN BALI?\n\nBali, in general, does not have any malaria warnings. Things change when you explore islands as Lombok, Flores, Sumba, Sumbawa, etc..\n\nHowever, there are still plenty mosquitoes, and there is a chance of getting dengue fever from these mosquitoes, so it is strongly advised to bring and wear repellent to minimize the risk."
