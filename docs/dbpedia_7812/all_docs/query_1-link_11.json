But what about those days when you need to tip the scale in the other direction? If you’re looking for a natural solution that can help you ease anxious thoughts and relax a restless body, this variety is just what you need.\n\nIt is one of the most popular strains in general, and definitely one of the most popular Red Vein kratom varieties! While people think it got its name for being grown in Bali, it actually earned the name for the chilled-out, laidback vibes people feel after taking it – it’ll have you feeling like you’re living life on the beach in Bali!\n\nAnd that’s not all.\n\nIt has developed a reputation as being one of the best strains for aches and pains and general discomfort, while also providing a slight energy boost. You’d be hard-pressed to find another variety – or any product, for that matter – that boasts this level of versatility!\n\nThis is due to the high quantities of Mitragynine in Red Bali, which is the Kratom alkaloid most cited as an analgesic. While it is high in Mitragynine, it isn’t very sedating as it has a decent quantity of 7-OH in it as well, which is the energy-boosting Alkaloid in Kratom.\n\nRed Bali is usually one of the first strains people try with Kratom, and for good reason! It is one of the staff favorites here at Kingdom Kratom. And overall, it’s one of the most complete strains there is. Whether you take it during the day to slow a racing mind and help you concentrate or take it in the evening to ease yourself into a relaxed state for a deep night of sleep, Red Bali is a Kratom staple. Get yours today and see what you’ve been missing out on!\n\nHere’s Why We’re Your Trusted Source for All Things Kratom…\n\nSince 2017, our brand has been known as the trusted source for all things kratom. Why? Simple – we have the best selection of high-quality products and world-class customer support to back it all up. What more could you ask for?\n\nWe’ve tested a variety of farms to find the best source for you. Our kratom is always grown to maturity and harvested using strict standards. And, you can rest assured it’s free of additives and impurities. You don’t have to just take our word for it, either.
