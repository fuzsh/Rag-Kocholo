        "text": "Best for: consistently good weather, hiking, beaches, snorkeling and diving\n\nYou can expect reliably dry and sunny weather between April and October with average daytime highs hovering in the high 80s. The dry season coincides with the high season, peaking in June and July when travelers flock from the southern hemisphere to seek winter warmth. It can be more expensive to book flights, accommodation and activities during these months.\n\nDespite the influx of tourists, the dry season is prime time for hiking, particularly multi-day hikes which aren’t safe when the ground is wet and muddy. May to September is the best time to enjoy Bali’s beautiful beaches, and the same goes for diving and snorkeling as visibility is excellent due to low rainfall and plenty of sunshine. If great weather, hiking and beaches are what you’re looking for, this is when to do it.\n\nBest for: fewer tourists, thriving jungles and rainforests, temples\n\nThe rainy season is hot and humid with heavy rain that usually falls in the morning and afternoon, however, the skies often clear for a few hours after a big downpour. There might be a few days here and there where it rains non-stop, but it’s not very common. Bali can experience heavier rains and strong winds between January and mid-April due to tropical cyclones, so this is something to be aware of when planning your trip. Aside from a brief spike in tourists in December during the festive period, Bali is much quieter during the rainy season so it’s a good chance to explore without throngs of tourists. You can also expect cheaper hotel rates and discounted holiday activities.\n\nThe rainy season isn't a great time to do water activities like diving, snorkeling and surfing as the visibility tends to be poor. However, it’s perfect weather for visiting temples, cooking classes and chilling out in Ubud’s trendy cafes and yoga studios. The rain also does wonders for the vegetation in the jungles and rice paddies, and while big hikes might be off the cards, short walks are totally fine. One thing to note is the wet weather attracts lots of moisture-loving mosquitos, so make sure you’re armed with repellent and long layers."
