We went there to eat several times because the food in our hotel right next door wasn't that convincing in the long run and we wanted to try something different.The food here is very good. Lots of Asian guests from the complex and super good food at a really good price. Right by the sea and good ambience.\n\nnusa mahendra\n\n23:39 25 Jul 24\n\nYuichi Nishihara\n\n02:05 01 Jul 24\n\nI never spent such a relaxed vacation before. I stayed at this cozy resort while my two daughters were taking the Open Water Diving course. Blue sky, blue ocean, beautiful mountain, friendly staff, tasty food, clean room, everything was perfect.

They were experts and made sure I had a great time diving. The guides were patient and helped everyone, no matter their skill level. After diving, I relaxed in my comfortable room. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for adventure and relaxation. I can't wait to come back!\n\nMuhd Isyazmi\n\n14:36 06 Mar 24\n\nHad the pleasure of staying at Pebble & Fins from 8 to 12 February this year while doing my Open Water Diver’s Course. The double bed room No.7 I was assigned for the stay is extremely spacious for me and cozy. Had a great surreal view of the beautiful sunrise every morning from my room.Definitely enjoyed my stay there since the location was quiet, the staff were very attentive as well as hospitable to everyone’s needs and were extremely helpful. The reception staff, Rara was very thorough and the resort was well managed by the Manager on site, Rendy. Food at the resort was also well prepared in huge portions and for the dive equipment, I would say it is decent.The dive guides are very experienced and knowledgeable in their craft, sharing their insight as well as advice while ensuring safety at all times. Everyone was professional and did their due diligence while maintaining discipline in the field.Overall there was a laidback vibe and the environment at the resort promoted bonding and socialising with other solo travellers to share stories and have a good evening together spending time hanging out.I would highly recommend the stay at Pebble & Fins to anyone, regardless solo or group traveller, including families. Do check out Tulamben and Amed nearby while you’re there!\n\nQihao Soh\n\n13:58 28 Feb 24\n\nNice place , service and environment\n\nchris tai\n\n08:01 28 Feb 24\n\nPebble and Fins diving resort offers an exceptional diving experience paired with top-notch accommodation and service. From the moment I arrived, the staff's warmth and professionalism set the tone for a memorable stay. The diving guide are highly skilled, catering to all levels of experience with ease. The resort's accommodations are comfortable and well-maintained, providing a perfect retreat after exhilarating dives. I highly recommend Pebble and Fins to anyone seeking a perfect blend of adventure and relaxation. Can't wait to return!\n\nAndy Wong Guan Hao\n\n12:39 27 Jan 24\n\nThe resort was very well maintained and had good vacation vibes. The deluxe room (2 singles or 1 queen), was affordable, luxurious and most importantly comfortable for somewhere far out of the tourist hub. You won't feel dirty, grossed out or unwelcome here.In addition, the staff were extremely friendly and nice. Customer service was top notch. There were always fresh towels and warm water available as soon as you return from dives. You are always greeted with smiles and warmness. An excellent way to start your vacation and mornings. Not much needs to be said about the food because its great.Finally, our instructor Robin - was an excellent coach, teacher and friend. He is always accommodating towards guest and would try his best to fulfil their needs and comfort. Providing services such as Authentic Balinese massage and other welfare services you should require. As an instructor, he has my utmost respect as he not only teaches you the SSI syallables but goes the extra mile by adding challenges to help you improve on your skills. - Not many dive instructors do this so you're definitely getting a lot of value for the standard SSI cost.Thanks Robin & your assistants (twins).\n\n7Adventure\n\n08:57 22 Jan 24\n\nPebble and fins is very nice, all staff are very nice to people too. Having different type of food that u can choose.\n\nTan Kingston\n\n07:20 22 Dec 23\n\n1. My stay with my daughter at Pebble and Fins Resort over the period of 12/12/2023 to 16/12/2023 was very pleasant and memorable.2. Upon check-in, the first thing which struck me was that our room was indeed very spacious and very clean (although I learnt later that the Resort was built some 4 years ago) with even a small hotel safe, an item which is a rare sight in most resorts.3. Both the General Manager by the name of Pamela Wang and her deputy, Rendy were most courteous and obliging to our every need during our whole stay.4. Our breakfast and dinner, all provided for under our package, were within our expectation; the attending staff members’ service were all very impeccable.5. I fully recommend Pebble and Fins Resort to all Scuba and Free Divers (like myself) as the shore dives to a beautiful ship wreck and nice corals and marine life are just outside the beach front of the Resort.6. Lastly, even those leisure free-and-easy visitors to the Resort can be fully relaxed by the swimming pool laying by the deckbeds, eyes closed merely listening to the sloshing ocean waves in the late afternoon and evening; the same resonation which stays in your memory even in the toilet and shower room which has an open concept of the skies looking at you from above.7. Kudos !\n\nJoelle Yeo\n\n13:20 19 Dec 23\n\nDid my open water cert here, highly recommend this resort. Food was amazing, it exceeded my expectations, there is a good mix of Indonesian/western/chinese food for you to choose from for your meals.Service was impeccable, the staff are always ready to serve you. Rendy, the hotel manager is also very accommodating, I requested for massage, manicure and pedicure and he helped and assisted in meeting my demands. The masseuse is also really good, even better than the ones I tried at Seminyak and it’s a fraction of the price!The dive master - Agung was also really good and patient. I was really afraid initially but he helped to calm me down and made my diving experience very enjoyable.Overall this place is amazing and has exceeded my expectations!\n\nMelody Jean Tan\n\n00:36 16 Dec 23\n\nPamela and Rendy were very friendly and welcoming. The resort staff was also very accommodating and hospitable. We really enjoyed our stay here, the rooms were clean, very well maintained and the toilet has an open air concept which was new to me. You can even hear the waves from the toilet which was quite soothing. The place is perfect to rest by the poolside / restaurant in between dives. The hot stone massage comes highly recommended after a long day of diving too.Food served everyday was a mixture of Chinese and Indonesian cuisines and delicious. The staff were great.The dives and equipment was well organised by Pamela. I went there for my advanced adventure dive course. My instructor Semut was very experienced and patient with teaching me in skill. I enjoyed learning the theory and practical skills with him. He was very patient with refreshing my open water skills as well.Definitely recommended for solo divers as everyone around the resort is so friendly so you won’t feel lonely. Leisure activities such as visiting the waterfall and Mt Agong lookout point was also arranged for us so everyday was filled with activity!We did the Day dive trips to Nusa Penida to sight Manta Rays and Mola Mola but unfortunately visibility was poor so we couldn’t see it.Overall , we were very pleased and satisfied during this trip staying in Pebbles and Fins.\n\nX Scott\n\n11:21 14 Dec 23\n\nIt was a 6 days diving trip for me. I had a wonderful stay in the resort. Feel very warm welcomed by the staff. Food served was delicious, staff is always ready to serve you and give you greetings when they see you.It is closed to dive site.

It couldn’t be better! As a diving instructor, I can responsibly say that the overall diving experience with food, accommodation and accommodation here is great, especially suitable for those who are just getting started and those who like macro photography.\n\nLuisa Serrano\n\n10:37 23 Oct 23\n\nThe resort itself was very relaxing as it has this homey feels with a Balinese culture vibe. We stayed in their glamping suite which was very cozy yet so minimalist which made it more relaxing. It exceeded our expectation including the toilet and bath - it has hot and cold water, it was spacious and basic amenities were also provided. They have a restaurant facing the sea and truly, this was our most favorite part of our trip —- the food. They serve very good food, from local cuisine to international ones. All the staff were very friendly, very helpful and very polite to everyone which makes it easier to get along with them despite the language barriers, they smile and greet you everytime they see you, so kudos to the staff of the resort. The resort also provides a lot of activities, mainly scuba diving and also land tours. They suggested to us some tourist spots and glad we took their suggestion coz we really enjoyed the waterfalls, the savana and the mountain side in Kintamani.

The place is truly awe-inspiring, offering a serene, quiet, and thoroughly relaxing environment that's perfect for unwinding.The staff at Pebble and Fins also deserve special recognition. Specially to Pamela who caters to most of our requests. They are incredibly friendly, accommodating, and always ready to assist with a warm smile.

The staff is really nice and attentive. The air conditioning is silent and you can hear the sea against the rocks. The pool is small but facing the sea, it's very nice. It is mainly a hotel for diving, not much around so few tourists. Attention food is taxed at 20% (not indicated).\n\nMichael Wulff\n\n12:40 14 Aug 23\n\nIt's very nice.\n\nbarr ningsih\n\n11:41 10 Aug 23\n\nCool\n\nEly S\n\n08:11 06 Aug 23\n\nPeaceful and relaxing dive resort with a great sunrise view located literally by the ocean - it's just a short walk right down to water for the Kubu shore dives. The beach is covered in pebbles - the challenging part is walking in/out against the waves.My instructor for the SSI Advanced Adventurer course and guide for the leisure dives were all amazing, would definitely recommend!\n\nNic Flinkenflogel\n\n07:14 06 Aug 23\n\nBeautiful dive hotel with a relaxed ambiance and great rooms, fantastic place to dive the SS Liberty.\n\nKadek Badung\n\n08:52 11 Jul 23\n\nVery good place for Berliners and diving, a place on the beach, and very close to sport diving, very friendly staff\n\nravintharan zi en\n\n07:31 20 Jun 23\n\nPebble and Fins was a delight to stay at during our days we were there for our diving trip!

Staff are very nice and friendly and are always around to help! Hats off to Robin who was always walking and around and interacting with guest to make sure their stay and diving experience was perfect. Location is pretty far from airport, but is worth it if diving is the main goal of the trip!\n\nAmir Syafiq\n\n01:16 28 Feb 23\n\nAn excellent resort to stay and dive in Bali. Great atmosphere and stunning views. Robin’s and P&F staff hospitality are awesome and very welcoming.

Their services are so on point, and they deserved more than 5 stars! The food are good, and they provided lots of value added services. The crews are details oriented, from remembering our names, to fulfilling every single requests. The dive masters are professional, great spotter! We managed to see lots of rare marine, such as pygmy seahorse, harlequin shrimp, electric clam etc. They even arranged for ours after-dives itinerary. Shout out to Robin and all crews for the amazing hospitality, lots of love! ❤️\n\nJonas Koh\n\n12:18 20 Dec 22\n\nThe resort is about 3 hours away from Bali’s airport, but super close to many dive sites like Liberty Wreck, Drop Off and Coral Garden.

Our group of divers had a lot of fun during our 4 days of stay there. Robin and his staffs went out of their ways to help us whenever we requested something, be it massage services by the masseuse ladies at the resort to hunting for pygmy seahorse during our dive. Loved our stay there, looking forward to return to the place next year!\n\nKiki\n\n04:23 30 Nov 22\n\nGreat place. The room and bathroom are very spacious, suitable for divers.

Kudos to Robbin and his management team.Pebble Fins is also lucky to have Robin, as he is a well-experienced dive instructor and ensures the teaching is of highest standards and safety. If in doubt, can approach him and he is willing to assist.Definitely will come back for more!\n\nAlbert Tamin\n\n12:19 12 Nov 22\n\nI stayed 3 nights at Pebble & Fins and did 2 days of diving.

The food is good and they give generous portion. The staff are very nice and helpful. On the first day they brought me to Les Waterfall which is refreshing. At the resort I ordered a massage and it was really good. The dive guide Dex was very good at showing macro stuff. Robin the resort manager was amazing and always making sure that everything is going well. I totally recommend Pebble & Fins.\n\nXanc C\n\n03:34 04 Sep 22\n\nDecided to drop by for a simple dive trip after Borders open..

The warm hospitality from Robin and staff made me feel welcomed. The food at the restaurant was always plentiful and delicious. I went for leisure dives and felt taken care every step of the way. I always felt safe and enjoyed all my dives. The open toilet concept took a little getting used to, it's private but is half sheltered but hey, not many people can say they showered under the stars.\n\nRebecca Choy\n\n17:16 05 Jul 22\n\nMy first time in Bali and no regrets choosing P&F as my dive resort choice!

Situated right beside the shoreline with a stunning sunrise daily, it is a great place for relaxation.Took a dive package via Gills Singapore which partnered with this resort alone and it was a good successful leap of faith. Resort staff were intentional in their role to ensure that guest are settled nicely feeling welcomed. Specific to dive-related information, dive guide held extensive knowledge and ensures your safety remains their priority.\n\nEvery fins has a journey!\n\nEvery pebble has a story.\n\nFIN WITH US!"
