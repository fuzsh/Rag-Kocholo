        "text": "The minimal and elegant entrance to the Ayana lobby\n\nThe Ayana lobby, like many others in this part of Bali, frames a view onto the endless blue ocean.\n\nWalking down the steps, towards Rock Bar, you encounter numerous dining venues such as this one. I like the idea of the overwater restaurant but the tables are way too cramped for my taste.\n\nWe got to the line for Rock Bar just as the sun was setting. There are actually two lines, one for hotel guests and another for visitors – which I think is a good call. Our waiting time was about 20 minutes. The capacity of the bar is actually pretty sizeable, the main issue is that you need to wait in line for the funicular car to take you down the cliffside, to the ocean’s edge.\n\nThe majority of the seating is obscured from above, only the two floating bars are visible whilst you wait in line\n\nFor whatever reason, we were told that one of us had to get out of the funicular, just as it was about to set off. I volunteered to let the others go ahead.\n\nOnce I got to the bottom I saw that my group had been given a table right by the cable car, bundled together with tons of other people and no view to speak of, there was also a really long line, snaking right next to these tables, of people waiting to go back up again. I spoke to a manager and asked for them to move us somewhere a little more relaxing.\n\nThe view to our right.\n\nRock Bar just seems to go on and on. This very cool looking beach section was below us, at the end of the area shown above. I think this was actually my favourite out of all the areas that we saw.\n\nThe service was very prompt, as you’d expect given our proximity to one of the bars. The drinks themselves, whilst inventively presented, were basically fruit juice. Way too sweet and no alcohol detectable. We ordered a couple of bar snacks but if you want dinner you’ll have to go elsewhere, the menu is not very extensive and is limited to very small dishes.\n\nAfter one round of drinks we figured we’d seen the place and ticked it off the list but I definitely wouldn’t recommend going out of your way to visit. The drinks are pretty bad, the bar is enormous and impersonal and the lines can get really out of control. It’s basically Disneyland for semi-adults.\n\nThe resort did look great at night though…\n\n…and gave me a chance to play with the low light settings on my new Lumix LX100\n\nSangkar Restaurant – Bulgari Bali\n\nhttps://www.bulgarihotels.com/en_US/bali/bar-and-restaurant/sangkar-restaurant\n\nA short drive away from Ayana (and right next door to The Edge!) is the Bvlgari Resort. I was really looking forward to seeing it in person as the photos I had seen all looked spectacular.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived we could tell that this was going to be several orders of magnitude above what is offered at Ayana.\n\nAs our car pulled up to the resort we were immediately wowed by the enormous lobby. Dark and brooding, it didn’t look like a modern structure. It actually felt like stepping into a painstakingly restored, ancient temple.\n\nOnce in the lobby I was surprised to be greeted by a European member of staff (the only time I’ve ever seen a Westerner in a visible front of house role in Bali). He took my name and confirmed my reservation with the restaurant. A buggy was with us almost instantly.\n\nThe decor, furniture and lighting at Bvlgari Bali are all exceptional. Conceptually flawless.\n\nThe grounds of Bvlgari are actually very extensive, I was surprised at how long it took to make it all the way down to the main restaurant area. Our buggy driver was a delight, very fluent in English and quite well versed not only in the details of the resort but also in the history and culture of our home countries.\n\nArriving at night, the setting for the bars and restaurants is absolutely enchanting. It honestly felt like we were emperors in some long forgotten kingdom. The architecture manages to perfectly blend the old and the new, so many of the stone surfaces are rough and lava-like that the impression is one of aged elegance rather than brash novelty.\n\nThis beautiful lamp marks the stopping point for buggies.\n\nOn the left is Il Ristorante, a very highly regarded Italian restaurant. We dined at Sangkar, the Indonesian restaurant on the right, which boasts spectacular ocean views from its outdoor deck.\n\nTo reach Sangkar we first had to head towards the bar. This is how busy it gets when the resort is at full capacity.\n\nI just can’t get enough of the ambiance of tranquility here.\n\nLooking across the water towards Il Ristorante\n\nSangkar is by far the larger of the two restaurants at Bvlgari Bali but that doesn’t mean that it gets overcrowded. We asked our server why the resort seemed so empty. He said that although occupancy was at 100%, most visitors were on their honeymoons and usually just ordered room service…\n\nWe opted to eat outside on the terrace, beneath the full moon. Poor Mr R, the food at The Edge really did a number on him. It’s only now, looking back at this photo that I actually remember how bad he felt.\n\nThankfully he was at least able to enjoy the fantastic basket of breads that was brought to us.\n\nEverything about the tableware was in fitting with the overall design aesthetic of the resort. I particularly loved the antique looking, bronze cutlery.\n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes a la carte and the price was considerably less than what we would pay for similar in NY or London. The value for money, given that most people eating here will be a captive audience, paying north of $1000 a night for a room, was great.\n\nI think we ordered Bebek Goreng at the majority of our meals. This was one of the better examples.\n\nThe char-grilled prawns were deliciously fresh and generously portioned\n\nMrs. R fancied a bit of a change and went with sushi. It was fairly unremarkable but nicely presented.\n\nI ordered the Ultimate Nasi Goreng served with Wagyu beef satay and lobster tail, which was really good.\n\nI have no idea what this dessert was but my notes tell me that we all loved it.\n\n(Finn’s Beach club – Semara Bali)\n\nnow: Sundays Beach Club – Ungasan Clifftop Resort\n\nwww.sundaysbeachclub.com\n\nAs we awoke on our final full day in Bali, we figured we would take it easy and finally set foot on one of Bali’s white sand beaches.\n\nWhen we visited there were a couple of beach clubs, side-by-side in Uluwatu: Finn’s and Karma Beach. Finn’s seemed to be the more popular of the two, so we decided to make that our destination.\n\nFinn’s club has since relocated to Canggu, much closer to the heaving throngs of humanity in Kuta and Seminyak. i.e. the No Go Zone.\n\nThe Semara resort itself is now under new management and is called The Ungasan Clifftop Resort and this particular beach club is now called Sunday’s Beach Club.\n\nThe pricing remains unchanged. You pay 300k IDR per person for club access, which includes transport down on the inclinator, towels, non-motorized watersports and 150k IDR of F&B credit.\n\nUnlike Rock Bar, there was no line at all for the inclinator at Finn’s, we just had to wait for it to be sent up to us from the bottom. A relaxing enough wait…\n\n…Until this absolute beast turned up. Remarkably enough, our server at Sangkar, the night before, had mentioned that one of the Uluwatu monkeys was something of a legend (the Uluwatu monkeys as a whole have a reputation as being the most aggressive in all of Bali). He said that one particular monkey was bigger and stronger than the rest, this monkey was recognisable as a result of the battle scar across his face. His name was Samson and he was not to be messed with. He didn’t seem to like us too much.\n\nThankfully, the inclinator reached us shortly after he did…\n\n…And we were able to escape to the paradise on the shoreline\n\nKarma beach is just around the next corner so you can walk from one to the other. Note: Both beach clubs still charge you the full fee, including inclinator access, even if you make your own way there (there is a regular path down near Karma Kandara and you can walk here from Alila Villas Uluwatu in low tide too)\n\nThis way to Alila Villas Uluwatu\n\nAfter the arduous task of looking left and right, we were just about ready to start drinking pitchers of icy old booze.\n\nThis is the only picture of any of us actually standing on a paddle board (there are plenty of me thrashing around in the water or flying through the air as my buoyant blue nemesis floats idly next to me)\n\nIt’s not the most cultural way to spend a day but if you’re in this neck of the woods and fancy a change from your villa, it makes for a very relaxing and fun alternative.\n\nUluwatu Temple and the Kecak Dance\n\nThere are seven Sea Temples in Bali, each visible from the next (like that awesome scene with the signal flares in LOTR). The most famous is Tanah Lot (which we visited during our stay at Bulung Daya) after that, the next most visited is Uluwatu temple.\n\nThe temple itself is rather unimpressive and can only be photographed from this adjacent walkway.\n\nUluwatu Temple\n\nThe views on the other hand are quite something. Particularly if you’ve not spent any time in Uluwatu before.\n\nThe main reason to visit though has to be the Kecak dance. This is a deeply impressive show in which an all male group creates a surging and rhythmic music, a capella, for an action packed dance performance. The show starts off quite peacefully, a tranquil soundtrack to the sun as it slowly extinguishes into the ocean.\n\nAs our surroundings got darker, so did the performance.\n\nThe Monkey god Hanoman is the principal mischief maker of the show and also quite the acrobat\n\nHe likes to interact with the crowd too\n\nAnd is soon punished for his transgressions\n\nBefore freeing himself by kicking a path clear through the flames\n\nJu-Ma-Na Restaurant – Banyan Tree Bali\n\nhttps://www.banyantree.com/en/indonesia/ungasan-bali/dining/ju-ma-na-restaurant-and-bar\n\nAfter the Kecak Dance we decided to wrap up our final evening with dinner at the Banyan Tree resort. I hadn’t really researched the available dining options in advance but figured that an all villa resort with this high a rack rate was probably going to do ok.\n\nWe were greeted at the lobby by these stone guardians.\n\nOur main goal was to dine outside under the amazing full moon, which had started to turn red.\n\nOur buggy driver took us directly to Ju-Ma-Na, the resort’s French restaurant, without asking. We were more in the mood for Indonesian food but figured we might as well go and have a drink first.\n\nJu-Ma-Na has a beautiful outdoor bar area, which was deserted.\n\nIn fact both floors were\n\nHowever, we really wanted to sit on the other side, facing the ocean and the moon. Despite the fact that the restaurant was completely empty, the manager was a complete stickler for the rules. One terrace was only for drinks and the other only for dinner. So, we called up the buggy and headed to the centre of the resort to check out the other options.\n\nThe pool had an amazing view of the ocean and the moon. (those leaf shaped loungers are everywhere nowadays!)\n\nThe Indonesian restaurant looked fairly basic and unappealing though, so we decided to head back to the Ju-Ma-Na for dinner…back where we started!\n\nI’m so glad we did.\n\nFrom the get go, this was a very special experience. It was the most expensive meal of our trip and the only time we really paid metropolitan restaurant prices in Bali but it was most certainly worth it.\n\nThe meal began with a table side Balinese hand washing.\n\nI was rather intrigued by the menu’s description of the molecular G&T. Knowing how scarce a commodity alcohol is in Indonesia, I was very dubious when reading that I would be getting three glasses of G&T, filled with molecular tonic pearls, for the price of a regular drink at Rock Bar. I needn’t have been. It was so good that I ordered a second one\n\nThe bread was super fresh\n\nIt was accompanied by two delicious dips\n\nThe amuse bouche was exquisitely plated with a taste to match\n\nThe lobster bisque cappuccino was a playful little dish with a rich, deep and utterly captivating flavour\n\nI ordered the foie gras starter which was again beautifully presented and perfectly balanced. The foie was clearly front and centre, with the small waffle pieces adding textural contrast without detracting from the mouth coating richness of the goose liver. Each piece of foie then had a different accompanying gel to add acidity and freshness to the dish. Superb.\n\nThe octopus was grilled to perfection, with a sauce that ensured that the entire table’s bread plates were left barren\n\nBecause we were sharing our dishes, I only got to eat half of a raviolo. This made me sad. It was one of the best I’ve ever eaten.\n\nWe finished the meal with a trio of cremes brûlées, finished table side – of course.\n\nIt was our last dinner so we felt it was appropriate to go all out and order the soufflé as well. This was a great idea.\n\nOverall, a spectacular meal and well worth travelling for, even if you are staying in Nusa Dua, Jimbaran or anywhere in the vicinity of DPS.\n\nBonus fact: Ju-Ma-Na also has a pepper mill which is as big as a (small) person"
