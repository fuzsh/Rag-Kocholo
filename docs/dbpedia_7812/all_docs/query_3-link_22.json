        "text": "Bali History\n\nThe history of Bali covers a period from the Paleolithic to the present, and is characterized by migrations of people and cultures from other parts of Asia.\n\nIn the 16th century, the history of Bali started to be marked by Western influence with the arrival of Europeans, to become, after a long and difficult colonial period under the Dutch, an example of the preservation of traditional cultures and a key tourist destination.\n\nBali being part of the Sunda shelf, the island had been connected to the island of Java many times through history. Even today, the two islands are only separated by a 2.4 km Bali Strait.\n\nThe ancient occupation of Java itself is accredited by the findings of the Java man, dated between 1.7 and 0.7 million years old, one of the first known specimens of Homo erectus.\n\nBali also was inhabited in Paleolithic times (1 my BCE to 200.000 BCE), testified by the finding of ancient tools such as hand axes were found in Sembiran and Trunyan villages in Bali.\n\nA Mesolithic period (200.000-30.000 BCE) has also been identified, characterized by advanced food gathering and hunting, but still by Homo Erectus.\n\nNeolithic: Austronesian migrations (3000-600 BCE)\n\nFrom around 3000 to 600 BCE, a Neolithic culture emerges, characterized by a new wave of inhabitants bringing rice-growing technology and speaking Austronesian languages.\n\nThese Austronesian peoples seem to have migrated from South China, probably through the Philippines and Sulawesi. Their tools included rectangular adzes and red slipped decorated pottery.\n\nForests and jungles were cleared for the establishment of cultures and villages.They also made some plaited craft and a small boat was also found.\n\nTheir culinary habits included pork-eating and betel-chewing. They are thought to have focused on mountain cults.\n\nThey buried some of their more prestigious dead in oval stone sarcophagi, with human heads or zoomorphic figures sculpted on them. The bodies were either deposited in the sleeping position, or folded in two or three for compactness.\n\nAn important neolithic archaeological site in Bali is that of Cekik, in the western part of the island.\n\nThese same Austronesian people are thought to have continued their expansion eastward, to occupy Melanesian and Polynesian islands around 2000 years ago.\n\nThe cultural traits of this period are still clearly visible in the culture of Bali today, and connect it to the cultures of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nBronze Age: arrival of Dong Son culture (600 BCE-800 CE)\n\nA Bronze Age period follows, from around 600 BCE to 800 CE. Between the 8th and 3rd century BCE, the island of Bali acquired the \"Dong Son\" metallurgical techniques spreading from Northern Vietnam.\n\nThese techniques involved sophisticated casting from moulds, with spiral and anthropomorphic motifs.\n\nAs mould fragments have been found in the area of Manuaba in Bali, it is thought that such implements were manufactured locally rather than imported.\n\nThe raw material to make bronze (copper and tin) had to be imported however, as it is not available on Bali.\n\nNumerous bronze tools and weapons were made (axes, cooking tools, jewellery), and ceremonial drums from that period are also found in abundance, such as the \"Moon of Pejeng\", the largest ceremonial drum yet found in Southeast Asia, dated to around 300 BCE.\n\nThe stone sarcophagi were still in use during that period, as bronze artefacts were also found in them.\n\nAncient historical period: Indianized kingdoms (800-1343 CE)\n\nThe ancient historical period is defined by the appearance of the first written records in Bali, in the form of clay pallets with Buddhist inscriptions.\n\nThese Buddhist inscriptions, found in small clay stupa figurines (called \"stupikas\") are the first known written inscriptions in Bali and date from around the 8th century CE.\n\nSuch stupikas have been found in the regency of Gianyar, in the villages of Pejeng, Tatiapi and Blahbatuh.\n\nThis period is generally closely associated with the arrival and expansion of Buddhism and Hinduism in the island of Bali.\n\nThe Belanjong pillar (\"Prasasti Blanjong\") in southern Sanur was inscribed in 914 with the mention of the reign of the Balinese king Sri Kesari.\n\nIt is written in both the Indian Sanskrit language and Old Balinese language, using two scripts, the Nagari script and the Old Balinese script (which is used to write both Balinese and Sanskrit).\n\nThe pillar testifies to the connections of Bali with the Sanjaya Dynasty in Central Java. It is dated according to the Indian Shaka calendar.\n\nAccording to the inscription, Sri Kesari was a Buddhist king of the Sailendra Dynasty leading a military expedition, to establish a Mahayana Buddhist government in Bali.\n\nThe stone temple of Goa Gajah was made around the same period, and shows a combination of Buddhist and Hindu (Shivaite) iconography.\n\nGoa Gajah in Bali, Indonesia)\n\nInter-marriages between Java and Bali royalty also occurred, as when king Udayana Warmadewa of the Warmadewa dynasty of Bali married a Javanese princess, sister of the Emperor of Java Dharmawangsa.\n\nTheir son became the great ruler of East Java Airlangga, who ruled on both Java and Bali. In the 12th century, descendant of Airlangga are also known to have ruled over Bali, such as Jayasakti (1146â50) and Jayapangus (1178â81).\n\nThe island of Java again started to encroach significantly on Bali with the invasion of Singarasi king Kertanegara in 1284.\n\nKertanegara was then toppled by Raden Wijaya, founder of the Majapahit Empire. Contacts with China were also important during this period. Chinese coins, called Kepeng were in use in Bali from the 7th century.\n\nThe traditional Barong is also thought to be derived from the Chinese dragon. In the 12th century, king Jayapangus of Bali is known to have married a Chinese princess.\n\nMiddle historical period: Majapahit dynastic rule (1343-1846)\n\nThe Majapahit Empire rule over Bali became complete when Gajah Mada, Prime Minister of the Javanese king, defeated the Balinese king in Bedulu in 1343.\n\nThe Majapahit capital in Bali was established at Samprangan and later Gelgel. Gelgel remained the paramount kingdom on Bali until the second half of the 17th century.\n\nThe rule of the Majapahit marks the strong influx of Javanese culture into Bali, most of all in architecture, dance and the theatre, in literature with the introduction of the Kawi script, in painting and sculpture and the wayang puppet theatre.\n\nThe few Balinese who did not adopt this culture are still known today as \"Bali Aga\" (\"Original Balinese\") and still live in a few isolated villages.\n\nWith the rise of Islam in the Indonesian archipelago, the Majapahit empire finally fell, and Bali became independent at the end of the 15th or beginning of the 16th century.\n\nAccording to some myth the Javanese aristocracy fled to Bali, bringing an even stronger influx of Hindu arts, literature and religion.\n\nAccording to later chronicles the dynasty of Majapahit origins, established after 1343, continued to rule Bali for 5 more centuries until 1908, when the Dutch eliminated it in the Dutch intervention in Bali (1908).\n\nIn the 16th century, the Balinese king Dalem Baturenggong even expanded in turn his rule to East Java, Lombok and western Sumbawa.\n\nAround 1540, together with the Islamic advance, a Hindu reformation movement took place, led by Dang Hyang Nirartha, leading to the introduction of the Padmasana shrine in honour of the \"Supreme God\" Acintya, and the establishment of the present shape of Shiva-worshipping in Bali.\n\nNirartha also established numerous temples, including the spectacular temple at Uluwatu.\n\nIn ancient Bali, nine Hindu sects existed, namely Pasupata, Bhairawa, Siwa Shidanta, Waisnawa, Bodha, Brahma, Resi, Sora and Ganapatya. Each sect revered a specific deity as its personal Godhead.\n\nInscriptions from 896 and 911 do not mention a king, until 914, when Sri Kesarivarma is mentioned. They also reveal an independent Bali, with a distinct dialect, where Buddhism and Sivaism were practiced simultaneously.\n\nMpu Sindok's great-granddaughter, Mahendradatta (Gunapriyadharmapatni), married the Bali king Udayana Warmadewa (Dharmodayanavarmadeva) around 989, giving birth to Airlangga around 1001.\n\nThis marriage also brought more Hinduism and Javanese culture to Bali. Princess Sakalendukirana appeared in 1098. Suradhipa reigned from 1115 to 1119, and Jayasakti from 1146 until 1150.\n\nJayapangus appears on inscriptions between 1178 and 1181, while Adikuntiketana and his son Paramesvara in 1204.\n\nBalinese culture was strongly influenced by Indian, Chinese, and particularly Hindu culture, beginning around the 1st century AD.\n\nThe name Bali dwipa (\"Bali island\") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by Sri Kesari Warmadewa in 914 AD and mentioning Walidwipa.\n\nIt was during this time that the people developed their complex irrigation system subak to grow rice in wet-field cultivation. Some religious and cultural traditions still practiced today can be traced to this period.\n\nThe Hindu Majapahit Empire (1293â1520 AD) on eastern Java founded a Balinese colony in 1343. The uncle of Hayam Wuruk is mentioned in the charters of 1384â86.\n\nA mass Javanese immigration to Bali occurred in the next century when the Majapahit Empire fell in 1520.\n\nBali's government then became an independent collection of Hindu kingdoms which led to a Balinese national identity and major enhancements in culture, arts, and economy.\n\nThe nation with various kingdoms became independent for up to 386 years until 1906, when the Dutch subjugated and repulsed the natives for economic control and took it over.\n\n(Balinese Dancer, 1936)\n\nEuropean contacts\n\nThe first direct or indirect news of Bali by some European travelers can be traced back to Marco Polo and other possible travelers and traders via the Mediterranean Sea and Asia.\n\nThe first known European contact with Bali is thought to have been made in 1512, when a Portuguese expedition led by Antonio Abreu and Francisco SerrÃ£o reached its northern coast.\n\nIt was the first expedition of a series of biannual fleets to the Moluccas, that throughout the 16th century usually traveled along the coasts of the Sunda Islands.\n\nBali was also mapped in 1512, in the chart of Francisco Rodrigues, aboard the expedition.\n\nThe Magellan expedition (1519â1522), through Elcano, is thought to have possibly sighted the island, and early Portuguese and Spanish charts mention the island under various names such as Boly, Bale and Bally.\n\nSir Francis Drake briefly visited the island in 1580. In 1585, the Portuguese government in Malacca sent a ship to establish a fort and a trading post in Bali, but the ship foundered on the reef of the Bukit peninsula and only five survivors could make it ashore.\n\nThey went into the service of the king of Gelgel, known as the Dalem, and were provided with wives and homes. In 1597, the Dutch explorer Cornelis de Houtman arrived in Bali with 89 surviving men (out of 249 who had departed).\n\nAfter visits to Kuta and Jembrana, he assembled his fleet in Padang Bai. Enthusiastic, he christened the island \"Young Holland\" (Jonck Hollandt).\n\nThey were able to meet with the Dalem, who produced for them one of the Portuguese who had been in his service since 1585, Pedro de Noronha.\n\nBali Indonesian Independence\n\nImperial Japan occupied Bali during World War II with the declared objective of forming a \"Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere\" that would liberate Asian countries from Western domination.\n\nThe harshness of war requisitions made Japanese rule more resented than Dutch rule. Most of all, independence was strongly desired among the populace.\n\nFollowing Japan's Pacific surrender in August 1945, the Balinese took over the Japanese weapons. The Dutch returned to Indonesia in 1946, including Bali, to reinstate their pre-war colonial administration.\n\n(Puputan War in Bali)\n\nOne Balinese, Colonel Gusti Ngurah Rai, formed a Balinese 'freedom army'. Colonel I Gusti Ngurah Rai, by then 29 years old, rallied his forces in east Bali at Marga Rana, where they were trapped by heavily armed Dutch troops.\n\nOn 20 November 1946, in the Battle of Marga, the Balinese battalion was entirely wiped out, breaking the last thread of Balinese military resistance.\n\nIn 1946 the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed State of East Indonesia, a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia which was proclaimed and headed by Sukarno and Hatta.\n\nBali was included in the United States of Indonesia when the Netherlands recognised Indonesian independence on 29 December 1949.\n\nThe first governor of Bali, Anak Agung Bagus Suteja, was appointed by President Sukarno in 1958, when Bali became a province.\n\nBali Tourism\n\nEvery year millions of tourists come to Bali for leisure. The island even exceeded its target of attracting 3.1 million tourists by reaching 3.27 million a couple years ago.\n\nBut when exactly did Bali become ânoticedâ by tourists and travellers?\n\nAccording to first data released by Official Netherlands Bureau there were 213 tourists visited Bali in 1924.\n\nKoninklijke Paketcart Maatsckapy (KPM) or Royal Dutch Voyage Associate built Hotel Bali in Denpasar in 1928, where the Puputan Badung 1906 (Puputan Badung war of 1906) took place.\n\nKPM started to provide weekly sailings to Bali since 1924 after previously built Baliâs transportation infrastructure in 1917.\n\nThe sailing routes were from Singapore, Batavia (Jakarta), Semarang, Surabaya, Buleleng (Singaraja Harbour), and Makassar - the route was known as Bali Express. This is considered as the starting point of tourists travelling to the island of Gods.\n\nTwo years later after 1924, magazine Tourism in Netherlands East Indies stated that on February 8th 1927, the number of travellers had increased into 480 people.\n\nSeeing the significant increase of visitors to the island, KPM decided to build Hotel Bali to cater for the tourists.\n\nFurthermore, the hotel also had an important role in Indonesian national history as it was where the Denpasar Conference was held in 1946, which resulted in the first recognition of east Indonesia.\n\nIn 1963 the Bali Beach Hotel in Sanur was built by Sukarno, and boosted tourism in Bali. Prior to it, only three hotels existed on the island.\n\n(Inna Grand Bali Beach Hotel in Sanur, Bali, Indonesia)\n\nConstruction of hotels and restaurants began to spread throughout Bali. Tourism further increased on Bali after the Ngurah Rai International Airport opened in 1970.\n\nThe Buleleng regency government encouraged the tourism sector as one of the mainstays for economic progress and social welfare.\n\nThe tourism industry is primarily focused in the south, while significant in the other parts of the island as well.\n\nThe main tourist locations are the town of Kuta (with its beach), and its outer suburbs of Legian and Seminyak (which were once independent townships), the east coast town of Sanur (once the only tourist hub).\n\nUbud towards the center of the island, to the south of the Ngurah Rai International Airport, Jimbaran, and the newer developments of Nusa Dua and Pecatu.\n\nThe United States government lifted its travel warnings in 2008. The Australian government issued an advisory on Friday, 4 May 2012, with the overall level of this advisory lowered to 'Exercise a high degree of caution'.\n\nThe Swedish government issued a new warning on Sunday, 10 June 2012 because of one tourist who died from methanol poisoning.\n\nAustralia last issued an advisory on Monday, 5 January 2015 due to new terrorist threats.\n\nAn offshoot of tourism is the growing real estate industry. Bali's real estate has been rapidly developing in the main tourist areas of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak and Oberoi.\n\nMost recently, high-end 5-star projects are under development on the Bukit peninsula, on the south side of the island.\n\n(The Edge at Uluwatu, Bali, Indonesia)\n\nMillion dollar villas are being developed along the cliff sides of south Bali, with commanding panoramic ocean views.\n\nForeign and domestic (many Jakarta individuals and companies are fairly active) investment into other areas of the island also continues to grow.\n\nLand prices, despite the worldwide economic crisis, have remained stable. In the last half of 2008, Indonesia's currency had dropped approximately 30% against the US dollar, providing many overseas visitors value for their currencies.\n\nVisitor arrivals for 2009 were forecast to drop 8% (which would be higher than 2007 levels), mainly due to the worldwide economic crisis which has also affected the global tourist industry.\n\nBali's tourism economy survived the Islamists terrorist bombings of 2002 and 2005, and the tourism industry has in fact slowly recovered and surpassed its pre-terrorist bombing levels; the longterm trend has been a steady increase of visitor arrivals.\n\n(2002 Bali Bombing Memorial at Legian, Kuta, Bali, Indonesia)\n\nThe 2002 Bali bombings occurred on 12 October 2002 in the tourist district of Kuta on the Indonesian island of Bali.\n\nThe attack killed 202 people (including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians, and people of more than 20 other nationalities). A further 209 people were injured.\n\nIn 2010, Bali received 2.57 million foreign tourists, which surpassed the target of 2.0â2.3 million tourists.\n\nThe average occupancy of starred hotels achieved 65%, so the island still should be able to accommodate tourists for some years without any addition of new rooms/hotels, although at the peak season some of them are fully booked.\n\nBali received the Best Island award from Travel and Leisure in 2010. Bali won because of its attractive surroundings (both mountain and coastal areas), diverse tourist attractions, excellent international and local restaurants, and the friendliness of the local people.\n\nThe Balinese culture and its religion are also considered as the main factor of the award. One of the most prestigious events that symbolizes a strong relationship between a god and its followers is Kecak Dance.\n\nAccording to BBC Travel released in 2011, Bali is one of the World's Best Islands, ranking second after Santorini, Greece.\n\nIn August 2010, the film Eat Pray Love was released in theatres. The movie was based on Elizabeth Gilbert's best-selling memoir Eat, Pray, Love.\n\nJulia Roberts in Ubud, Bali on Eat, Pray, Love movie\n\nIt took place at Ubud and Padang-Padang Beach at Bali. The 2006 book, which spent 57 weeks at the No. 1 spot on the New York Times paperback nonfiction best-seller list.\n\nHad already fuelled a boom in Eat, Pray, Love-related tourism in Ubud, the hill town and cultural and tourist center that was the focus of Gilbert's quest for balance through traditional spirituality and healing that leads to love.\n\nIn January 2016, after music icon David Bowie died, it was revealed that in his will, Bowie asked for his ashes to be scattered in Bali, conforming to Buddhist rituals.\n\nHe had visited and performed in a number of Southeast Asian cities early in his career, including Bangkok and Singapore.\n\nSince 2011, China has displaced Japan as the second-largest supplier of tourists to Bali, while Australia still tops the list.\n\nChinese tourists increased by 17% from last year due to the impact of ACFTA and new direct flights to Bali.\n\nIn January 2012, Chinese tourists year on year (yoy) increased by 222.18% compared to January 2011, while Japanese tourists declined by 23.54% yoy.\n\nBali reported that it welcomed 2.88 million foreign tourists and 5 million domestic tourists in 2012, marginally surpassing the expectations of 2.8 million foreign tourists.\n\nBased on a Bank Indonesia survey in May 2013, 34.39 percent of tourists are upper-middle class, spending between $1,286 to $5,592, and are dominated by Australia, France, China, Germany and the US.\n\nSome Chinese tourists have increased their levels of spending from previous years. 30.26 percent of tourists are middle class, spending between $662 to $1,285.\n\nIn 2017 it is expected that Chinese tourists will surpass Australian tourists as the most visited in Bali.\n\nBali Geography\n\nAmong 17,500 islands across the Indonesian archipelago, Bali is one of the 33 provinces of the Republic of Indonesia.\n\nThe largest archipelagic country in the world, made up of 2,000,000 km2 of land with a chain of islands stretching over 500,000 km from Sumatra to Papua, and covers territorial waters of more than 5,000,000 km2.\n\nSituated between Java and Lombok, the island of Bali is located 8 to 9 degrees south of the equator with the Java Sea to the north, the Indian Ocean to the south.\n\nBaliâs covers an area of 5,636 km2 or 0.29% of Indonesia, measuring just 90km long the north-south axis and less than about 140km from west to east.\n\nDivided into three areas of water, the North Bali Sea is about 3,168km2, the East about 3.350km2, and the West about 2,982km2.\n\nBali Sea covers an area of 9,500km2. The North Bali sea runs along the coastline of Buleleng, the East Bali Sea runs along the coastline of Karangasem.\n\nKlungkung and Gianyar, and the West Bali Sea include the coastline of Badung Tabanan and Jembrana.\n\nThe island of Bali lies 3.2 km (2.0 mi) east of Java, and is approximately 8 degrees south of the equator. Bali and Java are separated by the Bali Strait.\n\nEast to west, the island is approximately 153 km (95 mi) wide and spans approximately 112 km (70 mi) north to south; administratively it covers 5,780 km2 (2,230 sq mi).\n\nOr 5,577 km2 (2,153 sq mi) without Nusa Penida District, its population density is roughly 750 people/km2 (1,900 people/sq mi).\n\nBali's central mountains include several peaks over 2,000 metres (6,600 feet) in elevation and active volcanoes such as Mount Batur.\n\nThe highest is Mount Agung (3,031 m, 9,944 ft), known as the \"mother mountain\", which is an active volcano rated as one of the world's most likely sites for a massive eruption within the next 100 years.\n\nAs of late 2017 Mount Agung has started erupting and large numbers of people have been evacuated, the airport in Bali has been closed. The extent of the eruption is as of November 2017 impossible to predict.\n\nMountains range from centre to the eastern side, with Mount Agung the easternmost peak.\n\n(Mount Agung Viewpoint, Bali, Indonesia)\n\nBali's volcanic nature has contributed to its exceptional fertility and its tall mountain ranges provide the high rainfall that supports the highly productive agriculture sector.\n\nSouth of the mountains is a broad, steadily descending area where most of Bali's large rice crop is grown.\n\nThe northern side of the mountains slopes more steeply to the sea and is the main coffee producing area of the island, along with rice, vegetables and cattle.\n\nThe island is surrounded by coral reefs. Beaches in the south tend to have white sand while those in the north and west have black sand.\n\nBali has no major waterways, although the Ho River is navigable by small sampan boats.\n\nBlack sand beaches between Pasut and Klatingdukuh are being developed for tourism, but apart from the seaside temple of Tanah Lot, they are not yet used for significant tourism.\n\n(Tanah Lot Temple, Bali, Indonesia)\n\nThe largest city is the provincial capital, Denpasar, near the southern coast. Its population is around 491,500 (2002).\n\nBali's second-largest city is the old colonial capital, Singaraja, which is located on the north coast and is home to around 100,000 people.\n\nOther important cities include the beach resort, Kuta, which is practically part of Denpasar's urban area, and Ubud, situated at the north of Denpasar, is the island's cultural centre.\n\nThree small islands lie to the immediate south east and all are administratively part of the Klungkung regency of Bali: Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Ceningan. These islands are separated from Bali by the Badung Strait.\n\nTo the east, the Lombok Strait separates Bali from Lombok and marks the biogeographical division between the fauna of the Indomalayan ecozone and the distinctly different fauna of Australasia.\n\nThe transition is known as the Wallace Line, named after Alfred Russel Wallace, who first proposed a transition zone between these two major biomes.\n\nWhen sea levels dropped during the Pleistocene ice age, Bali was connected to Java and Sumatra and to the mainland of Asia and shared the Asian fauna.\n\nBut the deep water of the Lombok Strait continued to keep Lombok Island and the Lesser Sunda archipelago isolated.\n\nBali Climate\n\nBeing just 8 degrees south of the equator, Bali has a fairly even climate all year round.\n\nAverage year-round temperature stands at around 30 Â°C (86 Â°F) with a humidity level of about 85%.\n\nDay time temperatures at low elevations vary between 20 to 33 Â°C (68 to 91 Â°F), but the temperatures decrease significantly with increasing elevation.\n\nThe west monsoon is in place from approximately October to April, and this can bring significant rain, particularly from December to March.\n\nRainy season starts from October to March, when the West monsoon brings heavy showers and high humidity.\n\nJune to September is considered the driest season, with low humidity and it can be fairly cold in the evenings, the best time for any outdoor activities.\n\nSomething unique can be found about climate in Bali. Even when it rains most times in the most parts of Bali you can often enjoy sunny days on the âBukitâ, the hill south of Jimbaran.\n\nOn the other hand, you may expect cloudy skies and drips throughout the year in Ubud and the mountainous areas.\n\nMost interestingly perhaps, the international weather reports for âDenpasarâ or âBaliâ mention showers and rain storms all times of the year.\n\nIn higher regions such as in Bedugul or Kintamani youâll expect to wear either a sweater or jacket when evening falls.\n\nBali Religion\n\nUnlike most of Muslim-majority Indonesia, about 83.5% of Bali's population adheres to Balinese Hinduism, formed as a combination of existing local beliefs and Hindu influences from mainland Southeast Asia and South Asia.\n\nMinority religions include Islam (13.37%), Christianity (2.47%), and Buddhism (0.5%).\n\nThe general beliefs and practices of Agama Hindu Dharma are a mixture of ancient traditions and contemporary pressures placed by Indonesian laws that permit only monotheist belief under the national ideology of Panca Sila.\n\n(Hindu religion in Bali, Indonesia)\n\nTraditionally, Hinduism in Indonesia had a pantheon of deities and that tradition of belief continues in practice; further, Hinduism in Indonesia granted freedom and flexibility to Hindus as to when, how and where to pray.\n\nHowever, officially, Indonesian government considers and advertises Indonesian Hinduism as a monotheistic religion with certain officially recognised beliefs that comply with its national ideology.\n\nIndonesian school text books describe Hinduism as having one supreme being, Hindus offering three daily mandatory prayers, and Hinduism as having certain common beliefs that in part parallel those of Islam.\n\nScholars contest whether these Indonesian government recognised and assigned beliefs reflect the traditional beliefs and practices of Hindus in Indonesia before Indonesia gained independence from Dutch colonial rule.\n\nBalinese Hinduism has roots in Indian Hinduism and Buddhism, that arrived through Java. Hindu influences reached the Indonesian Archipelago as early as the first century.\n\nHistorical evidence is unclear about the diffusion process of cultural and spiritual ideas from India. Java legends refer to Saka-era, traced to 78 AD.\n\n(Ghatotkacha Statue in Tuban, Bali, Indonesia)\n\nStories from the Mahabharata Epic have been traced in Indonesian islands to the 1st century; however, the versions mirror those found in southeast Indian peninsular region (now Tamil Nadu and southern Karnataka Andhra Pradesh).\n\nThe Bali tradition adopted the pre-existing animistic traditions of the indigenous people. This influence strengthened the belief that the gods and goddesses are present in all things.\n\nEvery element of nature, therefore, possesses its own power, which reflects the power of the gods. A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil.\n\nBalinese Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualising states of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among the people, who for this reason have become famous for their graceful and decorous behaviour.\n\nApart from the majority of Balinese Hindus, there also exist Chinese immigrants whose traditions have melded with that of the locals.\n\nAs a result, these Sino-Balinese not only embrace their original religion, which is a mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism and Confucianism, but also find a way to harmonise it with the local traditions.\n\nHence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's odalan. Moreover, Balinese Hindu priests are invited to perform rites alongside a Chinese priest in the event of the death of a Sino-Balinese.\n\nNevertheless, the Sino-Balinese claim to embrace Buddhism for administrative purposes, such as their Identity Cards.\n\nBali Language\n\nBalinese language and Indonesian are the most widely spoken languages in Bali, and the vast majority of Balinese people are bilingual or trilingual.\n\nThe most common spoken language around the tourist areas is Indonesian, as many people in the tourist sector are not solely Balinese, but migrants from Java, Lombok, Sumatra, and other parts of Indonesia.\n\nThere are several indigenous Balinese languages, but most Balinese can also use the most widely spoken option: modern common Balinese.\n\nThe usage of different Balinese languages was traditionally determined by the Balinese caste system and by clan membership, but this tradition is diminishing.\n\nKawi and Sanskrit are also commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, as Hindu literature was mostly written in Sanskrit.\n\nEnglish and Chinese are the next most common languages (and the primary foreign languages) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the tourism industry.\n\nAs well as the English-speaking community and huge Chinese-Indonesian population.\n\nOther foreign languages, such as Japanese, Korean, French, Russian or German are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.\n\nSo if you are a tourist and visitor traveling to Bali speaking some English you will be fine.\n\nIn all hotels and most restaurants you will have no problems with English. And as you can see on the picture, the Balinese might translate \"creatively\", but you will still understand what they mean.\n\nInternational chain hotels also often employ staff who speak the languages of countries, where most of their guests originate from.\n\nBali Culture\n\nBalinese culture is a mix of Balinese Hindu-Buddhist religion and Balinese customs. It is perhaps most known for its dance, drama and sculpture.\n\nBalinese cuisine is also distinctive. Balinese percussion orchestra music, known as gamelan, is highly developed and varied.\n\nBalinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the Ramayana but with heavy Balinese influence.\n\n(Ramayana Dance in Bali)\n\nFamous Balinese dances include pendet, legong, baris, topeng, barong, gong keybar, and kecak (the monkey dance).\n\nBali boasts one of the most diverse and innovative performing arts cultures in the world, with paid performances at thousands of temple festivals, private ceremonies, or public shows.\n\nAccording to Mexican art historian JosÃ© Miguel Covarrubias, works of art made by amateur Balinese artists are regarded as a form of spiritual offering, and therefore these artists do not care about recognition of their works.\n\n(Balinese wood carver)\n\nBalinese artists are also skilled in duplicating art works such as carvings that resemble Chinese deities or decorating vehicles based on what is seen in foreign magazines.\n\nThe culture is noted for its use of the gamelan in music and in various traditional events of Balinese society. Each type of music is designated for a specific type of event.\n\nFor example, music for a piodalan (birthday celebration) is different from music used for a metatah (teeth grinding) ceremony, just as it is for weddings, Ngaben (cremation of the dead ceremony), Melasti (purification ritual) and so forth.\n\n>\n\n(Melasti Ceremony in Bali)\n\nThe diverse types of gamelan are also specified according to the different types of dance in Bali.\n\nAccording to Walter Spies, the art of dancing is an integral part of Balinese life as well as an endless critical element in a series of ceremonies or for personal interests.\n\nTraditionally, displaying of female breasts is not regarded as immodest. Balinese women can often be seen with bared chests; however, a display of the thigh is considered immodest.\n\nIn modern Bali these customs are normally not strictly observed, but visitors visiting Balinese temples are advised to cover their legs.\n\nBali Life Style\n\nBaliâs population of over 3,000,000 souls spread over the whole island, including those in the smaller islands of Nusa Penida, Nusa Ceningan, Nusa Lembongan, Serangan and Menjangan Island.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Balinese are Hindus, with the increasing number on non-Hindu migrating from the closest neighboring islands of Java and Lombok.\n\nThe coastal areas in the south are the most populous area with over 370,000 people living in various professions in the capital of Denpasar.\n\nBali farmers plowing the fields\n\nFarming has been the primary way of living in Balinese life. Where else fishing, trading and craftsmanship are also in fashion from generation to generation.\n\nYet with the fast growing of tourism since past few decades, young people start to build up a new touch in their living culture.\n\nLife Style in Bali is very communal under the organization of villages. Temple ceremonies, marriage, cremation, farming and even the creative art festivals are decided by the local community institution called âBanjarâ.\n\nThe responsibilities in the day-to-day life are normally administered by both the Banjar and the government.\n\nThe local government mostly responsible for schools, health clinics, hospitals and roads, and Banjar is responsible for all other aspects of life.\n\nThere is another association exists in the banjar named âSubakâ that concerns to the production of rice and organizes the complex irrigation system.\n\nEvery family who owns a rice field must be a member of their local Subak, which then ensures that every member gets his fair distribution of water.\n\nA banjar consists of an average of 50 to 150 family members, owning a meeting venue called the Bale Banjar, which is used for regular gatherings and a center for local gamelan orchestras and drama groups.\n\nBali Festival & Events\n\nThroughout the year, there are a number of festivals celebrated locally or island-wide according to the traditional calendars.\n\nThe Hindu New Year, Nyepi, is celebrated in the spring by a day of silence. On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged (or required) to remain in their hotels.\n\nOn the day before New Year, large and colourful sculptures of ogoh-ogoh monsters are paraded and finally burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese pawukon calendrical system.\n\n(Ogoh Ogoh Festival in Bali)\n\nCelebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), cremation or odalan (temple festival).\n\nOne of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of dÃ©sa kala patra, which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context.\n\nMany of the ceremonial art forms such as wayang kulit and topeng are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation.\n\nMany celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with lots of activity and the resulting aesthetic, ramÃ©, is distinctively Balinese.\n\nOften two or more gamelan ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other to be heard.\n\nLikewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance.\n\nTourism, Bali's chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers.\n\n(Bali Art Festival)\n\nThe impact of tourism is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context.\n\nSince the 1930s sacred rituals such as the barong dance have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists.\n\nThis has led to new versions of many of these performances which have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a barong mask specifically for non-ritual performances as well as an older mask which is only used for sacred performances.\n\nBali festivals and events are important features in the social landscape of the island, and also permanent fixtures in the lives of the Balinese.\n\nSome of these unique cultural festivals and events are determined by Balinese calendars from long ago, while others are highlighted schedules that take place on certain dates each year.\n\n(Bali Art Festival)\n\nThese festivals largely form part of Bali's attractions and culture, showcasing the rich arts and cultural features that sets Bali apart from any other destination.\n\nThe Provincial Government of Bali holds numerous festivals that pay tribute to this wealth, and the great thing is that you can match your visiting dates with these highlight events.\n\nBelow are the list of several popular festival & events in Bali;\n\n1. Bali Arts Festival - The annual Bali Arts Festival is held from the second Saturday of June through the second Saturday of July each year.\n\nWitness the grand parades that usually take place at the Puputan Square in Renon, Denpasar, and the schedule of art performances that run througout the weeks at the Denpasar Arts Centre.\n\n2. Bali Kites Festival - The Bali Kite Festival is an annual celebration of one of the cultural icons of Bali, the traditional Balinese kite. It is an annual feast that serves as a preservation effort of an art form.\n\nAnticipated by the international community, and involving village kite troupes from al over the island taking part in showcasing their gigantic traditional creations as well as contemporary designs.\n\nThe festival usually takes place around the start of the windy season, between the months of June and August, with dates confirmed following favourable weather conditions.\n\n3. Galungan and Kuningan - Bali's most important festival is the Galungan festival. It is a feast and festival which is held throughout the whole island and an annual event coinciding with the wuku year.\n\nIt is believed that during this ten-day period, all Balinese gods will descend to earth for the festivities. Barongs prance from temple to temple and village to village in celebration of Galungan with the gods.\n\nGalungan to the Balinese, is the most important holiday period as it symbolises the victory of Dharma, or Virtue, upon Adharma, or all that is Evil. The festivities are made extra special by the fitting of 'penjor' on the right side of the entrance to every house.\n\nA penjor is a tall bamboo pole terrifically decorated with woven young coconut leaves, cakes, fruits and flowers; and also a must for every Balinese household.\n\nThe Galungan also sees the Balinese decked in their finest clothes and jewels for the day. The last day of the 10-day festival is the most important day.\n\nKnown as Kuningan, it is the climax of the ten-day Galungan, and also serves to bringing the holiday period to a close.\n\nKuningan is a day for prayer, and a special ritual ceremony is held for the spirits of the Balinese's ancestors.\n\nJust as the Galugan ends with a day of symbolic prayer, its beginning is marked by Pagerwesi.\n\nPagerwesi literally means 'iron fence', and on Pagerwesi day every year, ceremonies and prayers are held in supplication for iron-strong mental and spiritual defense in welcoming the Galungan holiday.\n\n(The Buffalow Races of Makepung Festival in Bali)\n\n4. Makepung Buffalo Races - Makepung is Bali's famous bull race, which takes place around harvested paddy fields around the town of Jembrana in the regency of Negara in West Bali.\n\nThe official grand prix of buffaloes is designated as the Governor's Cup or 'Piala Bupati', which is scheduled every year around the month of July, and leads up to the finals and main celebrations around the month of November.\n\n5. Nyepi - Bali celebrates a new year celebrating the turn of the Saka calendar, referred to as Nyepi.\n\nNyepi falls on the day after the new moon on the ninth month, and is a new year that is celebrated uniquely - in total silence and seclusion!\n\nOn the day of Nyepi, there no activity whatsoever. No traffic at all on the roads; no amusement is held the whole day long, and no fires may be lit in observance of the religious Nyepi guidelines.\n\nOn Nyepi Eve however, it is a whole scene of contrasts, as you may witness villagers all over the island lighting fire torches and parading giant effigies called ogoh-ogoh through the streets.\n\n6. Sanur Village Festival - The Sanur Village Festival is an annual celebration of arts and culture of the Sanur beach community, featuring a week full of cultural highlights as well as food, water sports and environmental-awareness events.\n\nThe week-long festivities are usually focused in the Maisonette area of the Inna Grand Bali Beach Hotel.\n\nOver the years, the festival features additional events that involve the fashion industry, yoga and wellbeing, sports and environmental awareness programs.\n\n7. Saraswati - Saraswati is a holiday that celebrates the blessings of the namesake Hindu goddess of knowledge, arts and literature, often referred to by the Balinese as 'Dewi Saraswati'.\n\nTo mark this joyous day, books of knowledge, manuscripts and Vedic scriptures are blessed and special offerings are made. Libraries and schools also conduct joint prayers.\n\nThe day of Saraswati is the first in a series of five important religious highlights, and falls on an Umanis Watugunung Saturday on the Balinese 210-day pawukon calendar, hence its celebrations twice in a Gregorian year.\n\n8. Chinese New Year - Chinese New Year in Bali takes place around late January or mid-February each year.\n\nThis special holiday is observed by Balinese of Chinese descent as well as by most Chinese Indonesians across the nation. Baliâs Chinese cultural influences go way back throughout the islandâs history.\n\nExamples include Balinese temples bearing Chinese architectural features, the use of ancient Chinese coins in rituals, and early settlements in the Kintamani highlands where legend tells of the marriage between a Balinese king and a Chinese princess.\n\nFast forward to present day, you can visit majestic Chinese and Buddhist temples, called klenteng in the local tongue, around the island.\n\nTheyâre great places to visit on any day of the year, but are truly alive and festive during the Chinese New Year celebrations.\n\nChinese barongsai lion and dragon dance troupes, together with their drum and cymbal wielding entourage, carry out wushu performances and acrobatic stunts to cheering crowds on the street and within temple courtyards.\n\nBali Transportation\n\nAs one of the worldâs go-to vacation destinations, Bali is a paradise to be experienced.\n\nAs an Indonesian island known for its forested volcanic mountains, iconic rice paddies, beaches and coral reefs, it is a destination loved by all.\n\nMake sure you experience the best Bali has to offer and be sure to know exactly how to make your way around this picturesque island.\n\nFrom taxis to private cars to motorcycles, we have tracked down the most convenient and easiest ways to travel around the island, so you donât have to.\n\nBali is a fairly big island, and if youâre planning to travel between popular cities, such as Ubud, Kata, Legian or Seminyak, you will need to rely on some form of transportation.\n\nShuttle buses are budget friendly and travel between the major cities, but they are slow and stop frequently. Organized tours are a more popular option for visiting attractions.\n\nIf youâd prefer a more flexible form of transportation, metered taxis are available in and to major cities.\n\nA rental car is also an option, but hiring a private driver is more common and preferable if youâre unfamiliar with Balinese road rules.\n\nBelow are the list of the most popular taranspotation in Bali\n\nBemo : this is the most used transportation in Bali especially in the city of Denpasar. It is a miniature van with a routine route set by local government periodically.\n\nThis type of transportation is good for short distance around town and cities, because of its size and passenger can get in and out at any point.\n\nThey are usually employed on tours between city and suburbs and can seat up to 10 passengers per vehicle, sometimes even more than its capacity.\n\nMost importantly, it is cheaper compared to some other type of transportations, even though fairly slow.\n\nBuses : there are buses for transportation between towns that relatively bigger compared to bemo. These buses connect all towns and most places of the island through local bus stations.\n\nLikewise bemo, buses also can be stopped at any point of the routes. They mostly operate day time inter island, but some are available at night for long distances within cities.\n\nTaxi : Taxi is the most efficient and convenience transportation in the island. Either chartered or metered one, they are everywhere and quite inexpensive compared to some other countries.\n\nOjek : A motorcycle taxi, or cart bike, is a licensed form of transport in some countries. The taxi typically carries one passenger, who rides as the pillion behind the motorcycle operator.\n\nFerry and speed boat : Travel between Bali, Lombok, the Gili Islands and Lembongan is available through Bali Ferry with frequent departures during the day.\n\nGetting Around Bali\n\nThe best way to get around Bali is with a hired car and driver. This option gives you the freedom of roaming around the country without the hassle of having to drive yourself.\n\nTravel by private air-conditioned car and be assisted by an English-speaking driver. Make your Bali vacation even more blissful by exploring the island of Bali on your own terms.Â\n\nYour trip starts where you wish, get picked up from your hotel or a place of your choosing and then set off to explore the area.\n\nBiking is another option, just be prepared to weave through chaotic traffic. Boats are a great way to get to neighbouring islands, but they are not frequently used to get around Bali.\n\nMost travellers arrive through Ngurah Rai International Airport (DPS), which is located between Kuta and Jimbaran on the island's southern tip.\n\nTo reach your hotel, check in advance to see if there is a complimentary resort shuttle available. Some hotels also provide private transportation for a fee.\n\nThough it can be pricey, some visitors say it's worth the cost (especially if you're arriving at night) as the driver will know exactly where to drop you off â a convenience some say is worth the extra rupiahs.\n\n(Driving a scooter or motorbike in Bali)\n\nDriving a scooter or motorbike the best way to get around if you are not going for long trips.\n\nIf you want to go to the beach, do some shopping, visit some restaurants etc then a scooter does really make things very easy and convenient.\n\nHowever, safety is indeed an issue. As described above already the traffic itself is a challenge but other factors create additional risks.\n\nIf you plan to take a taxi, you'll prepay your fare at the airport's taxi counter. Fares range widely depending on your destination, from 45,000 IDR to 315,000 IDR.\n\nThe next option is by Buses there are buses for transportation between towns that relatively bigger compared to bemo.\n\nThese buses connect all towns and most places of the island through local bus stations. Likewise bemo, buses also can be stopped at any point of the routes.\n\nThey mostly operate day time inter island, but some are available at night for long distances within cities. Fares are between 1.500 IDR to Rp. 10.000 IDR per one stop point.\n\nWhat to Expect from Bali\n\nWhatever your expectations and desires, they all can be more than fulfilled. Bali is regularly rated one of the Top 10 tropical holiday destinations of the world.\n\nHowever, Bali is not straight forward. It is diverse, complex and sometimes unpredictable and fall short on your expectations if you don't know some basic rules.\n\n(Ulun Danu Bratan Temple in Bali, Indonesia)\n\nThe island is a vibrant, dynamic organism which is home to 4mio Indonesians and a few thousand expats living and making a living here.\n\nBali is a \"real place\", with real people. Although one can find the most luxurious resorts, pristine beaches, best cuisines, and coconut trees on Bali.\n\nIt is not like the Maldives or Bahamas, where everything is streamlined to the standards of global tourism and where Tourism Managers have invented concepts to provide \"predictable surprises\" for tourists.\n\nBali Ecology\n\nBali lies just to the west of the Wallace Line, and thus has a fauna that is Asian in character, with very little Australasian influence, and has more in common with Java than with Lombok.\n\nAn exception is the yellow-crested cockatoo, a member of a primarily Australasian family. There are around 280 species of birds, including the critically endangered Bali myna, which is endemic.\n\n(Bali myna)\n\nOthers include barn swallow, black-napped oriole, black racket-tailed tree pie, crested serpent-eagle, crested tree swift, dollar bird, Java sparrow, lesser adjutant, long-tailed shrike, and milky stork.\n\nIncluding Pacific swallow, red-rumpled swallow, sacred kingfisher, sea eagle, wood swallow, savanna nightjar, stork-billed kingfisher, yellow-vented bulbul and great egret.\n\nUntil the early 20th century, Bali was home to several large mammals: the wild banteng, leopard and the endemic Bali tiger.\n\nThe banteng still occurs in its domestic form, whereas leopards are found only in neighbouring Java, and the Bali tiger is extinct.\n\nThe last definite record of a tiger on Bali dates from 1937, when one was shot, though the subspecies may have survived until the 1940s or 1950s.\n\nSquirrels are quite commonly encountered, less often is the Asian palm civet, which is also kept in coffee farms to produce Kopi Luwak.\n\nBats are well represented, perhaps the most famous place to encounter them remaining is the Goa Lawah (Temple of the Bats) where they are worshipped by the locals and also constitute a tourist attraction.\n\nThey also occur in other cave temples, for instance at Gangga Beach. Two species of monkey occur. The crab-eating macaque, known locally as \"kera\", is quite common around human settlements and temples.\n\nWhere it becomes accustomed to being fed by humans, particularly in any of the three \"monkey forest\" temples, such as the popular one in the Ubud area.\n\n(Monkey Forest in Ubud, Bali, Indonesia)\n\nThey are also quite often kept as pets by locals. The second monkey, endemic to Java and some surrounding islands such as Bali, is far rarer and more elusive and is the Javan langur, locally known as \"lutung\".\n\nThey occur in few places apart from the Bali Barat National Park. They are born an orange colour, though by their first year they would have already changed to a more blackish colouration.\n\nIn Java however, there is more of a tendency for this species to retain its juvenile orange colour into adulthood, and a mixture of black and orange monkeys can be seen together as a family.\n\nOther rarer mammals include the leopard cat, Sunda pangolin and black giant squirrel.\n\nSnakes include the king cobra and reticulated python. The water monitor can grow to at least 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in length and 50 kg (110 lb)and can move quickly.\n\nThe rich coral reefs around the coast, particularly around popular diving spots such as Tulamben, Amed, Menjangan or neighbouring Nusa Penida, host a wide range of marine life.\n\n(Manta Bay, Nusa Penida, Bali, Indonesia)\n\nFor instance hawksbill turtle, giant sunfish, giant manta ray, giant moray eel, bumphead parrotfish, hammerhead shark, reef shark, barracuda, and sea snakes.\n\nDolphins are commonly encountered on the north coast near Singaraja and Lovina.\n\nA team of scientists conducted a survey from 29 April 2011 to 11 May 2011 at 33 sea sites around Bali.\n\nThey discovered 952 species of reef fish of which 8 were new discoveries at Pemuteran, Gilimanuk, Nusa Dua, Tulamben and Candidasa, and 393 coral species, including two new ones at Padangbai and between Padangbai and Amed.\n\nThe average coverage level of healthy coral was 36% (better than in Raja Ampat and Halmahera by 29% or in Fakfak and Kaimana by 25%) with the highest coverage found in Gili Selang and Gili Mimpang in Candidasa, Karangasem regency.\n\nAmong the larger trees the most common are: banyan trees, jackfruit, coconuts, bamboo species, acacia trees and also endless rows of coconuts and banana species.\n\nNumerous flowers can be seen: hibiscus, frangipani, bougainvillea, poinsettia, oleander, jasmine, water lily, lotus, roses, begonias, orchids and hydrangeas exist.\n\nOn higher grounds that receive more moisture, for instance around Kintamani, certain species of fern trees, mushrooms and even pine trees thrive well. Rice comes in many varieties.\n\nOther plants with agricultural value include: salak, mangosteen, corn, kintamani orange, coffee and water spinach.\n\nBali Agriculture\n\nAlthough tourism produces the GDP's largest output, agriculture is still the island's biggest employer. Fishing also provides a significant number of jobs.\n\nBali is also famous for its artisans who produce a vast array of handicrafts, including batik and ikat cloth and clothing, wooden carvings, stone carvings, painted art and silverware.\n\n(Batik weaving in Bali, Indonesia)\n\nNotably, individual villages typically adopt a single product, such as wind chimes or wooden furniture.\n\nThe Arabica coffee production region is the highland region of Kintamani near Mount Batur. Generally, Balinese coffee is processed using the wet method.\n\nThis results in a sweet, soft coffee with good consistency. Typical flavours include lemon and other citrus notes.\n\nMany coffee farmers in Kintamani are members of a traditional farming system called Subak Abian, which is based on the Hindu philosophy of \"Tri Hita Karana\".\n\nAccording to this philosophy, the three causes of happiness are good relations with God, other people, and the environment.\n\nThe Subak Abian system is ideally suited to the production of fair trade and organic coffee production.\n\nArabica coffee from Kintamani is the first product in Indonesia to request a geographical indication.\n\nUseful Tips For Your First Time In Bali\n\nThe magical island of Bali has so much to offer, from rice fields, to volcanoes, to waterfalls, to beautiful beaches, to temples, and amazing restaurants and bars.\n\nTraveling to Bali for the first time, requires some proper planning, tips and tricks to make your Bali holiday a safe, secure and fun experience.\n\nHere is a useful list of things you should know before you go compiled by several travellers who wished they had it on their first trip.\n\nFrom how to say thank you in Indonesian, what sort of electrical adaptor you'll need, to packing extra sunscreen (it can be quite $$$), and much more.\n\n1. So the fist tip that we have is get your head around the current visa situation - In early 2016, Indonesia waived its standard 30-day tourist visa-on-arrival (VOA) system for 169 countries; visitors from most other nations (including Australians) must purchase the VOA.\n\nWhile extending a 30-day visa is possible, it can be a tricky business. Speak to a reputable visa agent on the ground, or contact your nearest Indonesian consulate prior to departure.\n\nAt the time of publication, 60-day visas could be arranged in advance, but not in-country. Know more about Visa on Arrival (VoA).\n\n2. Respect religious customs - Religion rules the roost in Bali. Donât get your knickers in a knot when a street is blocked off for a ceremony or your driver pulls over mid-trip to make a blessing â this is all part of the magic of the island.\n\nPlan accordingly if your travel dates fall on Nyepi when everything in Bali (even the airport) shuts down for the day, and always dress modestly (covering the shoulders and knees) and conduct yourself appropriately when visiting temples and holy sites.\n\n3. Play by the rules - The Indonesian legal system may seem confusing and contradictory, but it's best not argue with police if you are accused of an infringement that may feel unjust, and pay âfinesâ with good grace.\n\nDo not expect any special treatment for being a foreigner, and it goes without saying that having anything to do with drugs is a very bad idea.\n\n4. Respect the ocean - Even if youâre an avid beach-goer and surf worshipper, Bali's powerful waves, strong currents and exposed rocks can be treacherous, so take care, and don't swim alone unless you are completely confident in doing so.\n\nShow equal respect for the beach by not leaving any garbage (including cigarette butts) behind â when the tide comes in, it'll be sucked into the ocean at great cost to the marine ecosystem.\n\n5. Be Aware of Added Tax in Bar or Restaurant - By law, all bars and restaurants must charge an additional 21% on their food and drink prices.\n\nWhilst some add this in to the menu price, others will include small print stating it will be added to the bill.\n\nThis is completely legit, however, it's definitely something to be aware of as will add a hearty chunk on to your bill at the end of the meal!.\n\n6. Dress for the occasion - Beachwear doesnât always cut it in Bali â many higher-end bars, restaurants and clubs enforce a dress code.\n\nIf youâre unsure, call ahead to save the potential embarrassment of being turned away.\n\n7. Currency & how to avoid money exchange scams in Bali - The main currency in Bali is Indonesian Rupees (IDR) and itâs best to always have cash with you because lots of places donât accept credit cards (mainly in the markets).\n\nMake sure to exchange your money only in âauthorizedâ money exchanges that have cameras installed inside, because there are loads of unauthorized places that can scam you right in from of your eyes.\n\nThe exchanges all look similar, but authorized ones have cameras and will always give you a receipt. Another option is to use one of the many ATM machines available in all the main areas on the island.\n\n8. On temple visits - cover up, if you donât already have a sarong to cover your legs, there is often somewhere you can borrow or hire one from.\n\nAlso make sure your shoulders are covered too, wearing a sleeved t-shirt is often the best option.\n\n9. Charging your devices - 220 Volts, 50Hz. Electrical plugs are two-pronged âEuroplugâ type.\n\n10. Get an international driver's license - If you intend to hire a car in Bali, this is a must. Always carry your insurance and registration papers with you for the hired car, when driving.\n\n11. Get an international driver's license - If you intend to hire a car in Bali, this is a must. Always carry your insurance and registration papers with you for the hired car, when driving.\n\nBali Airport\n\nBali airport (Ngurah Rai International Airport also known as Denpasar International Airport) is your main entry point to the island.\n\nThe airport is in Tuban, an approximate 15 minute drive south of Kuta. Its runway stretches along Bali's isthmus that connects the Bukit Peninsula with Bali's mainland.\n\nBali airport's code is 'DPS' for Denpasar, the provincial capital of Bali which is 13km northeast of the airport.\n\n(Bali Arport; Ngurah Rai International Airport Indonesia)\n\nNgurah Rai is the world's smallest international airport, covering only 285 hectares. The airport underwent a major expansion in 2013.\n\nNow, it comprises a domestic terminal from where most travellers venture to eastern Indonesia.\n\nThe Bali arport International terminal has a Balinese architectural theme and has separate departure and arrival halls.\n\nThe departures area has 62 check-in counters that are equipped with electronic scales and luggage conveyors.\n\nTen of the international gates have Jet Bridges and automated aircraft parking systems. The international departure lounge areas have a total capacity of 3,175 passengers.\n\nOperated since September 17, 2014, the New Domestic Terminal area is 65,800 square meter or four times larger than the old one.\n\n(Bali Arport; Ngurah Rai International Airport Indonesia)\n\nIt can serve up to 9.4 million passengers a year, has 62 check in counters, four transit and transfer counters, 19 ticketing counters, eight boarding gates and seven arrival gates which are provided by five aviobridges (garbarata), and 5 unit conveyor belts.\n\nThe Bali airport operates a fleet of buses to ferry passengers to and from aircraft operating low cost flights which do not use an airbridge.\n\nDomestic travelers and also some international travelers are often ferried to aircraft parked on the apron between the domestic terminal and the cargo terminal to the east of the International and Domestic terminals using these buses.\n\nThis terminal also has prayer rooms, smoking areas, showers and massage services. Various lounge areas are provided, some including children's play areas and movie lounges, broadcasting movies, news, variety, entertainment and sport channels.\n\nTrack the current status of flights arriving at Bali arport (DPS) Ngurah Rai International Airport → Flight Status â Arrivals and Departures.\n\nBali Weather & Seasons\n\nLocated 8Â° below the equator, Bali's weather and climate is characterised as tropical monsoon.\n\nBali has warm weather year round with 2 main seasons, the dry season (April to September) and wet season (October to March).\n\nBALI WEATHER\n\nDuring the wet season, it rains almost every day, but usually for a couple of hours, after which everything looks even more green. It does however get very hot and humid as well.\n\nThe high season is July/August which is the peak of the dry season, but the island gets extremely overcrowded and hotel prices surge pretty high compared to other months.\n\nThe best months to visit are May, June and September where you can enjoy the beautiful weather without the crowds.\n\nThe warmest day over the next 25 days in Bali is forecast to be 19th August at 35Â°C (95Â°F) and the warmest night on 7th September at 25Â°C (77Â°F).\n\nThe average temperature over the next 25 days is forecast to be 33Â°C (91Â°F) . The average for August is 27Â°C (80Â°F) in Bali.\n\nBest Time to visit Bali\n\nBest time to visit Bali depends mainly on the weather and on high and low season, which does affect the overall price for accommodation.\n\nHigh season is during the months of July and August, during Easter Holidays, and Christmas / New Year (December till 1st week of January). This is the time Bali is the busiest.\n\n(Atuh Beach in Nusa Penida Bali, Indonesia)\n\nHowever, for many reasons, best time to come to Bali is April, May, June and September, just before and just after high season.\n\nIt's still dry season, it's slightly less humid, and room prices and villa rentals can be 30-50% cheaper than during high season.\n\nMany shops offer sales and promotions, restaurants are less crowded in those mid-season months, and in general Bali is a bit more relaxed.\n\nOctober is not too bad either, still much less rain than November (usually, check the rainfall chart).\n\n(Water Sports in Bali, Indonesia)\n\nThose months are also the best time for water sport activities such as scuba diving, surfing, snorkeling, etc.\n\nWaters are clear, crowd not too bad etc. Also major activities and attractions such as the family parks and fun things to do (Bali Zoo, Bali Bird Park, Marine & Safari Park,\n\nWaterbom, White Water Rafting, Monkey Forest, etc) have less visitors which can make the experience far more enjoyable.\n\n(White Water Rafting in Bali)\n\nIf you wish to explore the island and visit the main sightseeing spots, temples and go for a day trip and tour, then those months are also perfect.\n\nAnd not to forget, in general the traffic and hustle bustle on the roads is more bearable.\n\nEspecially in Kuta, Legian and sometimes even Seminyak the narrow streets are packed during certain times in the day with cars and motorcycles.\n\nSome tourists love it that way and could not imagine a holiday otherwise, but if you like it more quiet, then Kuta and Legian during high season might not be the best choice.\n\nBali Temples\n\nThere's probably more Bali temples than homes on the island. Many temples in Bali are actually shrines. However, the number of religious compounds might well be over 10,000.\n\nThe number is spread throughout the far-flung corners of the island, from mountain and hilltops to low-lying coastal areas.\n\n(Ulun Danu Beratan Temple in Bali, Indonesia)\n\nWhile this may be hard to believe at first, it doesnât take much time on the island to notice that temples are literally everywhere.\n\nMany of the islandâs major tourist attractions, of course, are elaborate temples like a Taman Ayun Temple or Uluwatu Temple.\n\nBut a countless number of smaller ones exist in sleepy rural villages and even in each family compound.\n\nThough itâs possible that the main purpose of your trip may be to surf or party on the beach, thereâs simply no avoiding a visit to at least a couple of temples during your time in Bali.\n\nConsidering how unique Balinese temples are, learning a little bit about their symbolism and architectural features beforehand can greatly enhance the experience.\n\nBalinese temples are complex. They could even be likened to living organisms that need to be fed and cared for in the form of festivals and offerings.\n\n(Uluwatu Temple in Bali Indonesia)\n\nConsidering what an integral part they are to Balinese culture, this article is only able to scratch the surface of all there is to know.\n\nAfter learning a little bit about the basic temple layout and architectural elements, weâll then go over some of the more noteworthy temples you can visit during your time on the island.\n\nBalinese temples, or pura, have strong associations with the number three. Temples are divided into three spaces: an outer courtyard in addition to two holier inner yards.\n\nEach temple also has spaces of worship for Hinduismâs three prominent deities: Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.\n\nAnd within the context of a Balinese village, there is also something called the âthree temple system. Each Balinese village contains its own Pura Puseh, Pura Desa and Pura Dalem temples.\n\nThe Pura Puseh is dedicated to both the god Vishnu and the human founders of the village. These are usually situated facing Baliâs most sacred and largest mountain, Mt. Agung.\n\n(Pura Puseh Temple in Batuan, Bali, Indonesia)\n\nThe Pura Desa is the temple of the local spirits as well as the god Brahma. These are usually located somewhere in the middle of the village.\n\nFinally, the Pura Dalem is dubbed âthe temple of the deadâ and it typically faces the sea. Pura Dalem temples tend to be dedicated to Shiva or related deities like Kali, Durga, or even Rangda.\n\nThe whole death theme is not all somber, though, as these destructive forces are considered necessary for dissolving impurities, evil entities, and earthly illusions.\n\nThe Pura Puseh, Pura Desa and Pura Dalem temples are the bare minimum that any village in Bali must have, but itâs likely for there to be many more.\n\n(Pura Dalem Ped Temple in Nusa Penida, Bali, Indonesia)\n\nMany temples, it should be noted, fall outside these three categories, such as state temples or those belonging to the local village association. And of course, each family compound in Bali has its own temple as well.\n\nNot only are there temples in a Balinese village for each god of the Trimurti, or divine Hindu trinity, but the three main gods are also symbolized in each individual temple.\n\nThis could be in the form of three tall thatched meru towers in which case the tallest one will most likely represent Shiva.\n\nThe divine trinity is also sometimes represented by color, with red standing for Brahma, black for Vishnu and white for Shiva.\n\nThe number three also plays an important role in the overall layout of each individual temple in Bali.\n\nUpon entering a temple youâll first find yourself in the jaba pisan, the intermediate space which acts as a bridge between the sacred space and the outside world.\n\nThe next section is the jaba tengah, or middle section, where things like gamelan performances or food stalls might be situated during a festival.\n\nFinally, the most sacred and innermost area, the jero (or jeroan), is where things like the main tower and whatever important relics the temple may possess are located.\n\nIndividual shrines or towers within a temple might also be divided into three parts to represent the âthree worldsâ: the underworld, the human realm and the heavens.\n\nThis is a common theme throughout both Hindu and Buddhist temples, as can be observed at places like Borobudur.\n\nAmong the tens of thousands of temples in Bali, there are nine particular temples which are considered to be most important.\n\nConfusingly, the list of temples will change depending on who you ask, but itâs the number thatâs most important.\n\nThe Balinese consider these special temples to help balance out the forces of the entire island, like some kind of enormous version of feng shui.\n\nARCHITECTURAL ELEMENTS OF BALINESE TEMPLES\n\nWhen visiting a temple, youâll encounter all sorts of elaborate gates, shrines or other interesting looking structures. But you probably wonât always understand what youâre looking at.\n\nSome temples will have special shrines dedicated to certain deities outside the Trimurti, for example.\n\nFurthermore, youâll likely notice a number of covered pavilions within the temple compound. These might be for gamelan performances or village meetings, but itâs often unclear to the casual visitor.\n\nOne thing all Balinese temples have in common, though, is that theyâre all open to the sky.\n\nThe reasoning is so that the gods being summoned during special ceremonies can descend from the heavens into the temple before eventually returning home.\n\nThe list below is an outline of the most standard elements you're likely to find at a temple in Bali.\n\nCandi Bentar - As you approach a temple, the first thing youâll notice is the candi bentar, or split gateway. These gates resemble a mountain that was split into two exactly even parts. To fully grasp the symbolism of the candi bentar, some basic familiarity with the legend of Mt. Meru is required.\n\nMt. Meru is a mythological mountain where the gods dwell. It appears not only in Hindu mythology but in Jain and Buddhist stories also. The Balinese believe that the original Mt. Meru, located somewhere on the Indian subcontinent, was transported to Bali by Shiva, where it was then split into two.\n\nPaduraksa - Most temples also contain inner gates known as paduraksa or kori agung. These gates separate the different areas within a temple, such as the jaba pisan from the japa tengah (see above).\n\nUnlike the candi bentar, these gates are not split into two. Furthermore, youâre likely to find the face of Bhoma, the Balinese Jungle God. While the creature may look fierce, he merely acts as a protector, scaring the evil spirits away from entering the holier parts of the temple.\n\nMeru - Aside from the temple gates, the most distinguishing characteristic of Balinese temples are their multitiered pagodas of varying numbers of thatched roofs. These are situated in the holiest and innermost jero section of a temple. These towers also symbolize Mt. Meru and are even simply referred to as meru.\n\nDifferent towers may be dedicated to different gods, or sometimes even individuals or local mountains. Meru towers have either 3, 5, 7, 9 or 11 tiers â a sequence of numbers considered sacred not just in Bali but in cultures throughout the world. Itâs said that a Balinese templeâs importance can more or less be determined by the height of its highest meru.\n\nBale Kulkul - A bale kulkul is a special tower housing a drum. The drum is used to call participants for village meetings or announce deaths, among other things. During special ceremonies, when gods or spirits are believed to descend down upon the temple complex, the kulkul might be banged on to announce the deityâs arrival.\n\nThe drum itself hangs from the ceiling of the thatched roof. Itâs typically a hollow wooden cylinder with a slit down the middle, which is then struck with a special type of hammer.\n\nPadmasana - Above we went over the importance of the Trimurti, or the holy Hindu trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Ultimately, though, Balinese Hinduism is a monotheistic religion.\n\nTheir supreme god is known as Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa. This deity, however, is so beyond normal human comprehension that it cannot be symbolized by a single statue or painting.\n\nConsidering how visual and symbolic Balinese culture is, how do they go about representing something which can hardly be comprehended?\n\nThey use whatâs referred to as a padmasana, or an empty throne on which the formless Widhi Wasa is said to sit. The padmasana is unique to Bali and you wonât find it in other Hindu countries like India.\n\nItâs said to have been created by the 16th century priest Dang Hyang Nirartha, who also influenced many other aspects of what make up Balinese Hinduism today.\n\nBali Nightlife\n\nEvery night of the week, visitors and local residents hit Baliâs many pubs, clubs, and beach clubs bars.\n\nLow-key spots, with affordable drinks let you unwind and make new friends, while upscale bars and pubs attract you with delicious cocktails, imported beers, fantastic food, and world-class musical entertainment.\n\nNot keen on dressing up for the night and want to stay in your shorts and t-shirt? No worries. Bali will have a spot where youâre welcome.\n\nWant to get dressed up in your fancy gear and step out to be seen? Then youâll feel right at home here in Bali. The island offers a wide range of nightlife experiences for visitors of all type.\n\n(Boshe VVIP Club Bali)\n\nBali has long been a center for clubbing and going out at night. Nearly half a century ago, the island was a popular stop for hippies and surfers, and its relaxed and tolerant culture has allowed a thriving party scene to grow over the decades.\n\nIts relative proximity to Australia, Japan, Singapore and the continous stream of visitors from those countries turned Bali into a world-class destination for nightlife.\n\nBali has no enforced opening and closing times for clubs and discos allowing them to stay open till late, with the music sometimes still playing at sunrise.\n\nAlthough the real parties and action happens after midnight, going out might start early, with happy hours available in many restaurants, bars, and clubs, and sunset drinks are a daily pastime, whether in a luxurious beachside lounge in Seminyak or on a bench by the waves in Kuta.\n\nBali nightlife is diverse, yet certain types of crowds, venues, and music are found more in specific areas.\n\nKuta tends to pull in a younger, wilder crowd with megaclubs, ultra-cheap drinks, and a musical focus on reggae, top 40, R&B, and mainstream dance music, while Seminyak typically attracts a hipper, more refined group of clubbers.\n\nHere, also most expatriates hang out. The focus is on beautiful venues with top of the line sound systems and international DJs playing house, techno, dubstep, and other cutting edge sounds.\n\nDrinks are of a higher quality, often made by the most skilled bartenders with imported ingredients. Make no mistake though, Seminyakâs clubs can get as wild as they come.\n\nNew hot spots often pop up and then shut down as soon as they get popular. Some of Baliâs clubs are rowdy and wild, some are hip and contemporary, and other more elegant and sophisticated. These can all be sampled in one night by simply grabbing a taxi and club-hopping.\n\nSome mega clubs have made things easier for those who donât want to travel by offering restaurants, bars, and multiple dance floors with different music styles, all under one roof.\n\nLive music is available in Kuta, Sanur, and Denpasar, and tends to draw also a local crowd. Cover bands are common, as is karaoke, and the scene is more about drinking and meeting someone new than all-night dancing.\n\nWhen all of the clubs and bars shut down, clubbers can keep going at a number of afterhours spots or at one of the late-night restaurants or street food centers that cater to the night owl.\n\nBali Dances\n\nBalinese dance is an ancient dance tradition that is part of the religious and artistic expression among the Balinese people of Bali island, Indonesia.\n\nThe Balinese dance is dynamic, angular and intensely expressive.Balinese dancers express the stories of dance-drama through the bodily gestures including gestures of fingers, hands, head and eyes.\n\n(Balinese dance)\n\nThere is a great richness of dance forms and styles in Bali; and particularly notable are those ritualistic dance dramas which involve Rangda, the witch, and the great beast Barong.\n\nMost of dances in Bali are connected to Hindu rituals, such as the Sanghyang Dedari sacred dance than invoked hyang spirits that believed to possess the dancers in trance state during the performance.\n\nOther Balinese dances are not linked to religious rituals and created for certain purposes, such as Pendet welcoming dance and Joged dance that is social dance for entertainment purpose.\n\nIn Bali there are various categories of dance, including epic performances such as the omnipresent Mahabharata and Ramayana. Among the dance traditions in Bali are:\n\nBarong, king of the spirits\n\nBaris dance, war dances\n\nCendrawasih dance, the bird of paradise\n\nCondong dance, a basic dance, preface to Legong\n\nLegong dance, a refined dance\n\nKecak dance, the Ramayana monkey chant dance\n\nJanger dance, a sitting dance with swaying movements\n\nPendet dance, a simple dance performed before making an offering at a temple\n\nTopeng dance, a mask dance\n\nBali Beaches\n\nBeing the most well-known travel place in Indonesia, Bali has one of the best beaches in the world.\n\nMany come to Bali maybe for the culture, the arts, the temples, diving, surfing or even the food, but one thing for sure it is also for the beaches.\n\nTravelers visit Bali for its long stretches of white sand beach, the crystal clear sea for swimming, strong waves for surfing and volcanic black sands for sunbathing.\n\nThere are many types of beach in Bali, from those with big rocks created by corals or lava to those covered wholly with white or black sand.\n\nDepending on what you want to do at the beach, there are a number of beaches for you to choose from.\n\nWhether you are a swimmer or not or if you are with kids, you may well choose from these beautiful beaches below. Look out for the high tide when swimming.\n\nHere is a list of the most popular Bali beaches for you:\n\n#1. Kuta Beach - Further down the line from the city Kuta is the Kuta beach. The waves are higher here and the currents are strong making it a perfect beach for surfers.\n\nBut of course it means not so much for swimming. The beach is always crowded with locals or tourist, mostly for the vibe and energy that circles around here.\n\nAt night you can find the Kuta beach parties among the beach clubs that are guaranteed to entertain.\n\n(Kuta Beach Bali, Indonesia)\n\n#2. Nusa Dua Beach - A seemingly endless stretch of powder white perfection, Nusa Dua Beach is so flawless, it almost looks manmade.\n\nIt borders the coastline of Nusa Duaâs resort area, fringed by manicured lawns and five-star hotels that have been tastefully sheltered by palm trees and natural building materials.\n\nNot only are the beaches impeccably clean and the waters calm, the shoreline is full of family-friendly restaurants, watersports and even a shopping complex.\n\nSo itâs the ideal destination for a fun-filled family day out that wonât leave the little ones hot and bothered thanks to plenty of places to cool off and recharge.\n\n(Nusa Dua Beach Bali, Indonesia)\n\n#3. Seminyak Beach - If you want to be in the heart of Baliâs oceanfront action, then Seminyak Beach is the place for you.\n\nAlong this impressive 5km stretch of powdery white sand, youâll find beach bars aplenty, five-star hotels and restaurants just footsteps from the waves, and world-famous beach clubs dotting the sand.\n\nBeginning on the outskirts of crazy Kuta, trailing all the way up to the coastal corners of Canggu, Seminyak Beach is a holiday destination in itself.\n\nLearn to surf in the gentle whitewash of the waves, soak up the sunshine on a squishy sun bed, or settle into a comfy, colourful beanbag at La Plancha for a round of sundowners â Ibiza-style beats included.\n\n#4. Echo Beach - What was once the go-to destination for a romantic beachfront barbecue has now become one of the coolest oceanfront spots to see and be seen.\n\nEcho Beach is the watering hole of Canggu (quite literally) with countless surf spots in every direction and shabby-chic bars dotted along the black sands to enjoy the views.\n\nAnd what a view there is. Expect beach babes in their Brazilian-cut bikinis, scruffy haired surfer dudes with sun-kissed bods, and beloved Bali dogs with their expat owners taking a sunset stroll.\n\nThis lively, community-vibe coastline goes from a playground of sun and surf by day, to a wild party spot by night. Bring an acoustic guitar for extra street cred, and donât forget the dog treats.\n\n#5. Jimbaran Bay - This long, expansive, soft white sand beach is not only well known for its gorgeous scenery (the glittering sands stretch for a full 3km), but also as the spot where local fishermen sell their fresh-from-the-net fish each morning at the bustling markets.\n\nAs the islandâs seafood hub, itâs no surprise then that youâll also find a number of beachfront barbecues dotted along the coastline, cooking up the dayâs catch for your grazing pleasure as the sun sets.\n\nFor a romantic seafood dinner, head to the bay before dark and choose your ocean treats from the display to devour just a few minutes later, or if itâs sunshine youâre after, find a quiet spot away from the stalls and enjoy the calm waters from dawn until dusk.\n\n(Jimbaran Bay Bali, Indonesia)\n\n#6. Balangan Beach - Located in the South of Bali on the Bukit Peninsula, Balangan Beach is best known amongst the islandâs surfing crowds and those looking for a laid back beach experience without the throng of touristic beach clubs.\n\nOcean babies can enjoy the aquamarine waters at high tide, and sunbathers can lie beneath the many loungers and umbrellas that line the sandy beach.\n\nThis quiet strip is still fairly underdeveloped with just a few local warungs serving home-cooked Indonesian food and icy cold Bintangs, and since itâs blessed with awesome waves for both beginners and pros.\n\nBalangan attracts the surfy, backpacker types who prefer cool tropical vibes over a pumping party scene.\n\n(Balangan Beach, Bali, Indonesia)\n\n#7. Keramas Beach - With Mount Agung behind you and pumping waves in front of you, Keramas Beach is a sight to be seen indeed.\n\nSitting on the east coast away from the crowds, Keramas is best known for its standalone beach club destination, Komune Bali.\n\nThis resort and beach club combo sits on the sand with a stunning infinity pool at the helm, facing out to the black sand beach and sparkling ocean out yonder.\n\nSettle in to the oceanfront day beds, graze by the pool or visit at dusk when the nightime surf sessions take centre stage.\n\nDouble points if you time a visit in conjunction with the annual World Surf League competition that attracts superstar surfers from around the world.\n\n#7. Sundays Beach Club - Another South Bali gem, Sundays Beach Club at the Ungasan Clifftop Resort boasts a private white sand bay, stunning turquoise blue waters and an offshore coral reef housing Nemo and his friends.\n\nHidden discretely at the bottom of a dramatic cliff face, this paradisal spot can only be reached by an inclinator taking you directly to the club.\n\nDonât miss the bonfires on the beach at sunset, and come hungry because youâll want to tuck into Sundayâs delicious island-inspired menu by famed Aussie chef, James Viles.\n\nJust be sure to leave enough space for some serious water-based frolicking, like snorkelling, stand-up paddle boarding and kayaking the crystal clear waters.\n\n#8. Padang Padang Beach - You might recognise this beautiful bay from the ever-famous âEat, Pray, Loveâ movie, where Julia Roberts falls head over heels for her Brazilian hunk.\n\nChances are, youâll fall in love here too, not only with the bronzed surfer crowds, but with the calm cove-like waters rolling off the bright white bay, framed by dramatic rock formations and bordered by world-class waves.\n\nThough Padang Padang is a relatively small beach about 10 minutes north of Uluwatu, the setting is simply stunning.\n\nThe best time to visit is early in the morning around sunrise when you can see Padang Padang in all its dazzling, natural glory, and before the throng of visitors descend on this spot in the hope of spotting Ms Roberts.\n\n(Padang Padang Beach, Bali, Indonesia)\n\n#9. Medewi Beach - In prime position along Baliâs sunset coast, Medewi is a lesser known beach on the west side of the island that offers a glimpse of Bali before tourism struck.\n\nWith remote villages and wide open rice paddies lining the palm-studded coastline, come here for a tranquil escape not an action-packed day at the beach â that is, unless youâre a keen surfer.\n\nFlocked mostly by visitors in search of uncrowded, world-class waves, Medewi is an isolated surfing destination that doesnât require a flight to get to.\n\nBut is far enough away from the crowds to guarantee a quieter sesh in the water. Stick around for golden hour, as thatâs when Medewiâs magic really shines.\n\n#9. Suluban Beach - This dreamy destination might well be directly below the famous and bustling Single Fin bar and the main access point to the world-renowned Uluwatu surf break, but come low tide, this spot at Suluban Beach is a true hidden treasure, and the best for a secret swim.\n\nSet against stunning dramatic cliffs, the water here is as turquoise as it gets. To access this little piece of paradise, youâll need to walk down the steps at Uluwatu, through the caves and onto the sand.\n\nRemember, when itâs high tide this swimming spot is inaccessible, so youâll need to check the tide times for your trip here, and donât forget to pack your bathers.\n\n#10. Sanur Beach - If itâs a leisurely day out at the seaside that youâre after, then head to family-friendly Sanur for an easy-breezy day at the beach.\n\nBesides its seemingly never-ending stretch of white sand, Sanurâs main beachfront attraction is without doubt the coastal promenade that extends over 5km long.\n\nThis ocean path curves past resorts, beachfront cafes, wooden fishing boats under repair and quite a few elegant old villas built decades ago by the wealthy expats who fell under Baliâs spell.\n\nTake a romantic stroll with your partner, or get some exercise on a bicycle with the family â best enjoyed early in the morning as Sanur is in prime position for spectacular sunrises.\n\n(Sanur Beach, Bali, Indonesia)\n\n#11. Karma Beach - Part of the stunning Karma Kandara resort, this luxury and private beach spot brings the vibes of a swanky Mediterranean island, along with crowds of trendy globe trotters looking for exclusivity in a totally chic setting.\n\nThe sea is a perfect shade of azure blue and great for snorkelling and water sports, while the crescent white sands are sprinkled with beach babes and their baes sipping on designer cocktails, playing a spot of beach volleyball.\n\nOr simply bronzing beneath the beach-chic cabanas and tucking into delicious wood-fired pizzas from the natural bamboo restaurant. Heaven really is a place on earth.\n\n#12. White Sand Beach (Pasir Putih) - Pasir Putih, also known as White Sand Beach or Virgin Beach, is a remote, off-the-beaten-path beach that rewards the most adventurous of road trippers.\n\nItâs located on the East Coast of Bali, near to the village of Candidasa, and with its pristine soft white sands that dramatically contrast to its volcanic black sand neighbours, it seriously stands out.\n\nWhen you see the âwhite sand beachâ sign, follow the dirt track until you reach the carpark.\n\nYouâll spot the line up of local seafood BBQ stalls (perfect for a sea view lunch) and the calm, clear waters that make White Sand Beach a lovely spot for swimmers, too.\n\n#13. Bingin Beach - Look out for the signs made of recycled wood, or follow the small groups of Baliâs cool crowds with surf boards in-hand and the lack of shoes or sandals on their feet.\n\nBingin Beach is a boho hideaway thatâs hard to find unless you know where youâre going â or who to follow. With perfect waves and small sandy coves for swimming at low tide, this cliff-base beach is a favourite for Baliâs sun soakers and surfers.\n\nYouâll need to be relatively fit to get to and from the beach (there are uneven, rocky steps from the top of the cliff to the sands), but your efforts will certainly be rewarded.\n\nDozens of affordable beach stays line the cliffside too, making this a good spot for budget trips or a good old, no-frills sunset Bintang on a blanket.\n\nThere are some great healthy cafes here too, perfect for a post-surf refuel and insta-ready sunsets.\n\n#14. Gunung Payung Beach - Gunung Payung, also known as Secret Beach, is the epitome of a picture-perfect, postcard paradise.\n\nIn fact, we were a little hesitant to include this in our roundup, since weâd like to keep this little treasure to ourselves. Alas, we canât keep this gem a secret.\n\nThink powder white sands, warm tropical waters that are as flat as a duck pond at low-tide, and if youâre lucky, not another human in sight. This beach isnât for the faint-hearted though.\n\nItâs a 301 step trek up and down (we counted) and once youâre down there, thereâs no restaurants for refreshments or shady sun beds, just one local guy who sometimes has a cool-box with cold water and Cokes.\n\nAnd if heâs feeling strong enough, will also bring his single sun bed and umbrella down from the top carpark for the day for hire. Itâs well worth it though, just donât forget to hydrate.\n\n#15. Balian Beach - Home to a growing number of expats and surf fanatics, Balian Beach draws in the cool crowds with its pounding surf, instagram-friendly dunes and knolls.\n\nNew boho cafes and bars popping up every other day â all of which just so happen to overlook the world-class waves from the towering cliff face above.\n\nWhether you simply stroll along the sprawling black sands, brave the water or kick back with a sunset beer post-surf.\n\nBalian Beach has an undeniable charm that keeps us coming back every other weekend, and it just so happens to sit in prime position on Baliâs west-facing sunset coast, too.\n\n#16. Thomas Beach - Ever since the opening of some cool Uluwatu restaurants at the top of this hidden bay, Thomas Beach is no longer a secret â though itâs still one of the quietest beaches in the Bukit.\n\nAccessible only via a gravel lane and then a winding set of crumbling stairs, this secluded strip of white sand beach is well worth descending down for.\n\nFringed by turquoise waters and dramatic boulders that protrude from the sand, this is postcard-perfection to a tee.\n\nBring a sarong and some water to stay hydrated, because you wonât find any restaurants or squishy sunbeds on this remote shoreline.\n\n#17. Amed Beach - With black sands and soaring volcanoes on the horizon, Amed isnât your typical beachfront vista, but boy is it a goodâun.\n\nSitting on Baliâs northeastern coast, Amed is known for its dramatic landscapes that guarantee some awe-inspiring holiday pics.\n\nAnd if youâre into diving or snorkelling, Amed is also home to one of the islandâs most vibrant reefs â a coral garden thatâs as colourful as it is popular.\n\nAn adventure beneath the waves here often involves a trip to nearby Tulamben too, to explore the sunken US Liberty Shipwreck thatâs teaming with life and aquatic beauty.\n\n#18. Lovina Beach - Lovina is well-known for its dolphin tours: half an hour before sunrise, more than 100 boats carry tourists out to sea where, as the sun comes up, pods of dolphins frolic in the bow waves.\n\nMany tourists stay one night for the dolphin trip and then leave â missing out on Lovinaâs chilled beach-holiday vibes. The beach at Lovina is black volcanic sand and the sea very calm; lovely for wallowing.\n\nTake your camera and wander east from the main beach, and youâll come across brightly painted fishing boats resting on the sand. As the sun goes down, the silhouettes of Javaâs volcanoes are cast on to the horizon.\n\n#19. Blue Lagoon Beach - Just over the hill from Padang Bai (fast-boat terminal for the Gili Islands) there is a little secret beach surrounded by palm trees, cut off from the rest of the island by volcanic rock headlands.\n\nThe white sand is perfect for whiling away hours in the sun, and the beach is edged with trees providing some shade.\n\nCoral reaches almost all the way to the beach, so rent snorkelling equipment from one of the beachside warungs and explore the underwater world.\n\n#20. Geger Beach - Located from the highway heading to Nusa Dua, Geger beach is a beautiful white sand beach glistening in the sun.\n\nThe sea is calmer here in comparison to Kuta or Balangan beach, though sometimes it may get a bit rough by the evening so please beware.\n\nLocal seaweed farmers do their work here sometimes so if you are lucky you can enjoy watching them going about their livelihood.\n\nThere are many cafes dotted along this beach making it famous for Sunday brunch or just for drinks and there is a temple at the end.\n\n#21. Bias Tugal (Tugel) Beach - Also known as Pantai Kecil (little beach) to the locals or white sand beach to the travelers, this deserted beach is one of the best-kept secrets.\n\nTucked away near Padang Bai and west of the harbour is somewhat hidden and only accessible after a 500m trek down a rocky path.\n\nAfter the trek, you will be greeted with stretches of white sand beach and sparkling blue sea with swaying coconut trees.\n\nCurrent may be strong here and not for beginner swimmers, but you can always just soak up the sun in solitude by the sand.\n\n#22. Dream Beach in Nusa Lembongan - Lembongan is a small island about 7km out of the sea from Bali, with big rocks and small vegetation with spots of sandy bays.\n\nOne of these bays in Nusa Lembongan is Dream Beach. It is known for its serene sea lapping and white sand. Most people stay longer at this island to explore all the beauty of it.\n\nIt is still largely undeveloped unlike the rest of Bali and lets one feel the sense of going back in time, just enjoying the natural beach.\n\nHow to Get to Bali\n\nWith the increasing number of direct flight to Bali from some other parts of the world, it makes it easier to go to Bali.\n\nInternational flights arrive at an airport near the Indonesian island's capital, Denpasar.\n\nMany airlines fly from the United States to Bali, though flights usually entail at least one layover at a hub airport like Hong Kong, Changi, Singapore or Narita, Tokyo.\n\nFrom Bali, flight to Jakarta is about 1.5 hours, to Singapore and Perth (Australia) 2.5 and 3 hours, to Hong Kong about 4.5 hours, and to Sydney/Melbourne about 5.5 to 6 hours, with various airlines offering their services.\n\nPlease check at âairline infoâ for more information about flight schedules. Just make sure you look for âDenpasar (DPS)â instead of âBaliâ in airline time tables.\n\nIntrepid travelers can catch a ferry for the last leg of their trip to Bali from the nearby Indonesian island of Lombok, Gili Islands and other small islands.\n\nHow to Fly to Bali\n\nMajor airlines that fly from the United States to Bali include Singapore Airlines, Korean Air, Cathay Pacific, Delta Air and American Airlines.\n\nFor the most competitive airfares, use a comparison website like Skyscanner or Kayak and begin searching for flights three or four months before the departure date.\n\nInput the departure airport and the designation \"DPS\" as the destination airport. Due to the distances involved and time zone differences, allow two days' traveling time to arrive on the intended arrival date.\n\nGaruda Indonesia : The Airline of Bali Indonesia\n\nFor example, to arrive on July 31st, input July 29th as the start date. Layovers of 24 hours or longer help ease the effects of the long flight to Bali, and cities like Hong Kong and Singapore offer plenty to see and do on a short break.\n\nFerries to Bali\n\nThere are a number of ferry routes to Bali, all of which dock in Padang Bai on the south-east coast, Benoa the south-central coast, near Kuta, and Gilimanuk in east coast.\n\nFor many backpackers, crossing the Bali Strait between Java and Bali is the main way of reaching âparadiseâ on the Island of the Gods.\n\nWhile some people may take the more expensive and direct option of flying to Bali (usually from Surabaya or even as far back as Jakarta), the ferry is a more authentic experience.\n\nOn the Java side, the port at Ketapang is very convenient was thereâs a bus station and train station nearby, which have comprehensive services to other destinations around the island, such as Probolinggo (for Mount Bromo), Yogyakarta, Malang, and Bandung, as well as the nationâs capital.\n\nThe crossing from Java to Bali by ferry takes only 25 minutes, although this does not include the time taken for loading and unloading the cars and small amounts of cargo. The ferries run 24 hours per day and depart every 20-30 minutes.\n\nThere are ferries sail from Lombok to Bali 17 times per day, and passengers can travel from Gili Island to Bali 33 times per day.\n\nFerries also travel to Bali from the nearby small islands, Nusa Lembongan, Nusa Ceningan and Nusa Penida. The fastest and slowest ferry crossings are from Lombok to Bali.\n\nThe Freebird Express ferry completes the journey from Bangsai, Lombok, to Amed, Bali, in 45 minutes, while Scoot Fast Cruise's ferry takes four hours and 45 minutes to cross from Sengigi, Lombok, to Sanur, Bali.\n\nEmbassy & Consulates in Bali\n\nBali is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, and even though it is a small island, we are blessed that quite a few countries run consulates in Bali.\n\nNot every country has a consulate in Bali and the embassies are located in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.\n\nBut for most travellers we have good news, that in case of need of assistance, they do not need to travel to their embassy.\n\nIn most cases you will never need their services anyhow, and that's a good thing. But sometimes things happen where we will have to go to our embassy or consulate to sort things out.\n\nThe consulate helps you with services about passport and citizenship issues, child and family matters and provides you with assistance in case of an emergency.\n\nSo, if you lost your passport or it got stolen, or you end up with no more money and got stuck on the island, if you are moving to Bali or face other obstacles that seem hard to solve.\n\nThen it's pretty nice t"
