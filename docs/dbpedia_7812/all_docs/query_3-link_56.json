He was the son of Devamba and Virochana. He grew up under the tutelage of his grandfather, Prahlada, who instilled in him a strong sense of righteousness and devotion. Bali would eventually succeed his grandfather as the king of the Asuras, and his reign over the realm was characterized by peace and prosperity. He would later expand his realm – bringing the entire world under his benevolent rule – and was even able to conquer the underworld and Heaven, which he wrested from Indra and the Devas. The Devas, after their defeat at the hands of Bali, approached their patron Vishnu and entreated him to restore their lordship over Heaven.\n\nEtymology: (IAST: Mahābalī, Devanagari: महाबली, Malayalam: മാവേലി, മഹാബലി, Tamil: மாவேலி) also known as Bali or Māveli\n\nSource: Hindupedia: The Hindu Encyclopedia\n\nBali or sacrifice is the most controversial topic in yajña, because of its implications. Broadly, there are two ways to look at it: the literal sacrifice and symbolic sacrifice. Literal sacrifice involves sacrificing an animal. In symbolic sacrifice, a piṣṭa paśu is offered. This could be kūṣmānda (ash gourd) or any other consumable. Yajñas mostly involve symbolic sacrifice (piṣṭa paśu) and seldom involve a literal sacrifice.\n\nBali in a sacrifice is part of the optional rites, one of the offerings involved in kāmya rites.

Jain legends describe nine such Prativāsudevas (anti-heroes) usually appearing as powerful but evil antagonists instigating Vāsudeva by subjugating large portions of Bharata-land. As such, they are closely related with the twin brothers known as the Vāsudevas (“violent heroes”) and the Baladevas (“gentle heroes”).\n\nThe Prativāsudevas (such as Bali) fight against the twin-heroes with their cakra-weapon but at the final moment are killed by the Vāsudevas. Their stories are narrated in the Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacarita (“the lives of the sixty-three illustrious persons”), a twelfth-century Śvetāmbara work by Hemacandra.\n\nSource: archive.org: Een Kritische Studie Van Svayambhūdeva’s Paümacariu\n\nBali (बलि) participated in the war between Rāma and Rāvaṇa, on the side of the latter, as mentioned in Svayambhūdeva’s Paumacariu (Padmacarita, Paumacariya or Rāmāyaṇapurāṇa) chapter 57ff. Svayambhū or Svayambhūdeva (8th or 9th century) was a Jain householder who probably lived in Karnataka. His work recounts the popular Rāma story as known from the older work Rāmāyaṇa (written by Vālmīki).

Mandara, the home of joy.”.\n\n2) Bali (बलि) refers to one of the nine Prativāsudevas (enemies of Vāsudevas), according to chapter 1.6. Accordingly: “[...] Aśvagrīva, Tāraka, Meraka, Madhu, Niśumbha, Bali, Pralhāda (Prahlāda), Laṅkeśa, Magadheśvara, rivals of the Vāsudevas, all fighting with the cakra, will perish from their own cakras which have gone to the hands of the Vāsudevas”.\n\n3) Bali (बलि) is the name of an ancient king and a friend of king king Dhanamitra from Śrāvastī, according to chapter 4.3 [vimalanātha-caritra].—Accordingly:—“In this same Jambūdvīpa in the city Śrāvastī, the ornament of Bharata, there was a king Dhanamitra. A king, named Bali, who had come as a guest because of friendship with King Dhanamitra, lived in the same city. One day King Dhanamitra, the strength of his intellect undiminished, played akṣadyūta with Bali with gama and cara (i.e., two moves in some game played with dice and men, probably similar to backgammon).

Offerings made to local deities, particularly animal sacrifice—bali—is a practice that is much more ancient. This practice, like many others inspired by local ‘small’ or ‘folk’ traditions, serves as an important model for Tantric rites in general and Kaula rites in particular. Animal sacrifice, whether literal or by means of substitutes, is commonly integrated to varying degrees into Tantric rites of all schools. Ritual procedure in general distinguishes between offerings made to the main deity and those to its attendants. In some cases, even when the main deity accepts only vegetarian offerings, the attendants may be offered animal sacrifice.\n\nSource: Project Gutenberg: Castes and Tribes of Southern India, Volume 1\n\nBali (“fish”) refers to one of the exogamous septs (divisions) among the Mogers (the Tulu-speaking fishermen of the South Canara district).
