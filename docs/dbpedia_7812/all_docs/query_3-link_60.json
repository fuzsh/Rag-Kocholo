        "text": "The Indonesian island of Bali has always been a firm favourite on the Southeast Asia travel circuit; land in Denpasar, experience nightlife in Canggu, travel inland and stop off at the rice paddies of Ubud, before heading to the surf breaks of Uluwatu. Over time, the popularity of this route has led to rapid development around these hotspots, but adventure thirty minutes beyond these destinations and you could be in Bali thirty years ago – not a smoothie bowl or Bintang Bali tee in sight. Bali is a place where old and new coexist together in a way that (mostly) supports local communities, and the constant flow of people passing through in search of spiritual experiences, wellness, food and music has enabled the local-led creative scene to thrive, making it easy to skip the overdeveloped tourist hotspots. Expect open-air intimate club nights, holistic clinics reviving Balinese traditions, family-run warungs plating up foraged ingredients, local-owned record stores and ancient villages known for their evil warding.\n\nTrippin is powered by a global community of diverse voices that are shaping today’s cultural landscape. We're an independent platform that connects travel, culture and creativity like never before. Collaborating with our community to uncover stories that are found at the intersection of social and cultural boundaries. Combining guides and experiences with podcasts, films and the written word to create an ecosystem that empowers people to travel more consciously. It’s about championing global creativity, mapping underground scenes, unpicking cultural mosaics and connecting cultures worldwide - all through the eyes of locals."
