        "text": "Selamat datang! Welcome to Indonesia. You’ll be met by an Intrepid representative at the airport and transferred to your hotel. Your adventure begins with a welcome meeting at 6 pm today in Jakarta. If you arrive early, why not check out some of Jakarta's museums, like the Wayang (puppetry), Balai Seni Rupa (fine arts) and maritime museums. For city monuments, don't miss Si Jagur – an old Portuguese cannon ornately decorated with a disguised meaning, or the Monas (National Monument) dedicated to the spirit of the Indonesian people. After the meeting tonight, join your group for an authentic Indonesian dinner at a special restaurant that’s housed in a Dutch mansion.\n\nFamiliarise yourself with the city on a full-day tour with your expert local leader. Take in Sunda Kelapa port – where the Dutch first landed, temple-filled Chinatown and the old town of Batavia. Wander about Fatahillah Square and visit a Chinese mansion (Chandra Naya) and gain an insight into the beautiful Peranakan architecture. Enjoy lunch at a Chinese restaurant that has been serving some of the city’s best and most authentic food for more than a century. Learn the story behind the restaurant and its cuisine during an exclusive storytelling session with the owner. After lunch, explore the religious side of the city at Cathedral Church and Istiqlal Mosque – the largest mosque in Southeast Asia.\n\nCatch an early morning train to Yogyakarta this morning and drop your bags at the hotel, then travel to Prambanan – an ancient 10th-century Hindu temple on the outskirts of Yogyakarta. This magnificent UNESCO World Heritage-listed site is the largest Hindu complex in Java. Set in a tranquil park, it is the perfect spot to stroll along the river and take in the sunset. Have your camera ready, as you’re sure to get some incredible shots. This evening, join your group for a performance of the epic Ramayana ballet and dine on delicious regional dishes over dinner.\n\nLearn more about village life on a 2-hour walking tour around a local village this morning, during an exclusive agrotourism visit. Learn about the tumpangsari farming system and try your hand at playing traditional gamelan music. After you’ve enjoyed a traditional snack and brown sugar tea, sit down for lunch with your group in a pendopo (gazebo). After your village adventure, travel to Candi Borobudur, the largest Buddhist structure on earth. As you approach, you'll see the enigmatic temple rise before you, emerging from the tropical foliage. Join your leader and follow the route of ancient pilgrims, circling the mandala-shaped structure from the early realms towards Nirvana. It's truly one of Southeast Asia's treasures. After, return to the city and enjoy an evening exploring Yogyakarta your way.\n\nThis morning after breakfast, ride a pedicab to a local market and maybe pick up some small bites or souvenirs. Discover the heritage of Kota Gede – renowned for its exceptional silver art and delectable cuisine. Then, dive into the ancient art of Batik with a hands-on class in a local village – you’ll learn how to draw with wax on cloth and create a masterpiece to take home. Tonight, try some local cuisine at an exclusive dinner at Gadjah Wong, which sits alongside the Gadjah Wong River. Listen to the owner’s story as you feast on Indonesian cuisine.\n\nAfter breakfast, fly from Yogyakarta to Bali. When you arrive, drive to Ubud and your Feature Stay for the next three nights. Ubud is Bali's main arts and cultural centre – a thriving hub of markets, shops and warungs, close to rice terraces and lush jungles. With nature and well-being at its core, Ubud is a highland haven and a wonderful place to experience the magic that has made Bali such a popular destination (especially when you’re staying in a serene hotel surrounded by rainforest and rice paddies). Tonight, you might like to attend a fire dance performance at the temple or browse the lively Gianyar night market.\n\nIt’s a very early start today – you’ll have to wake at 4 am to head out to Mt Batur before sunrise, but it’s worth the early wake-up call! On a clear morning, it's possible to see all the way across the Lombok Strait to the peaks of Lombok's Mt Rinjani. Enjoy a delicious breakfast spread with your group while basking in the memorable mountain views. Your adventure continues with a trip to the village of Undisan, where you’ll tour rice fields with an expert local guide. Learn how the Balinese use herbal plants to treat different health conditions and browse homemade jewellery and craft. Then roll up your sleeves for a Balinese cooking class where you’ll learn how to make local specialties and enjoy a tasty lunch. After a day filled with adventure, tonight is yours to settle back, relax and enjoy your beautiful hotel to the fullest.\n\nAfter a relaxing day enjoying the pool, you’ll join Balinese royalty for dinner at one of the exquisite royal palaces of Ubud. Of course, you’ll have to look your best, so an appropriate traditional outfit will be provided for you to wear. Immerse yourself in the stories told by a member of the royal family as they explain royal cultural traditions and provide an insight into royal family life. You’ll also watch an intricate and culturally significant Legong dance – a special performance that’s one of the most famous in the royal court.\n\nSpend a leisurely last morning at your Feature Stay hotel. Today you will travel to Canggu, with its black sand beaches and verdant rice fields. On the way, visit Taman Ayun Temple – a 17th-century family temple of the Mengwi Empire, once only accessible to the royals. This temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its marvellous cultural architectural design. After checking into your hotel in Canggu, you’ll share a precious experience with a local healer during a blessing and purification ritual. Cleanse your mind, body and soul during this special ceremony that encapsulates the spirituality of Bali. Tonight, maybe head out to one of Canggu’s lively bars or restaurants with your group.\n\nToday is yours to enjoy Canggu your way. Maybe drop into a local warung (restaurant) for lunch, sign up for a surf lesson, take a trip to Tanah Lot temple or shop ‘til you drop at one of the area’s three markets. This afternoon, you’ll celebrate the penultimate night of your trip in style. Board a private yacht and take in Bali’s breathtaking southern coastline around Nusa Dua and the Bukit Peninsula as you set sail for one final adventure. Raise a glass of something chilled to toast your fabulous trip and enjoy a barbeque dinner onboard the yacht with your group as you watch the sunset."
