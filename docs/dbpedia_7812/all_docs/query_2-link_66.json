        "text": "klungkung\n\nKlungkung is the smallest regency on the island in terms of both land area and population.\n\nLocation: Klungkung Regency is situated on the eastern coast of Bali. It is bordered by the Badung Regency to the northwest, Bangli Regency to the north, and Karangasem Regency to the east. To the south lies the Indian Ocean.\n\nAdministrative Division: Klungkung Regency is further divided into several districts, including Klungkung, Dawan, Banjarangkan, and others.\n\nCulture and History: The regency holds historical significance as it was once the seat of the powerful Klungkung Kingdom, which played a crucial role in Bali's history. The regency is home to some ancient and culturally important landmarks and temples, which attract tourists interested in Balinese heritage and architecture.\n\nAttractions: One of the main attractions in Klungkung Regency is the Kertha Gosa, a historical court of justice known for its intricate ceiling paintings depicting various Balinese mythological stories. The nearby floating pavilion, called Bale Kambang, is another popular site. Other points of interest include Goa Lawah Temple (Bat Cave Temple) and traditional villages like Tenganan, known for preserving ancient Balinese traditions.\n\nAgriculture and Economy: The economy of Klungkung is primarily based on agriculture, with rice, coconut, and fruit being some of the main crops grown in the region. Additionally, tourism also plays a role in the local economy, as visitors come to explore its cultural heritage and natural beauty.\n\nHistory of the Klungkung Kingdom\n\nThe history of Klungkung and its kingdom is rich and deeply intertwined with the broader history of Bali, Indonesia. Here is an overview of the key historical aspects of Klungkung and its kingdom:\n\nThe Klungkung Kingdom's Founding: The Klungkung Kingdom, also known as the Gelgel Kingdom, was established in the 17th century by Dewa Agung Jambe. He was a descendant of the Majapahit Kingdom, which was a powerful empire in Java before it fell to the spread of Islam and the rise of Muslim Sultanates.\n\nRise to Power: Under the rule of Dewa Agung Jambe, the Klungkung Kingdom flourished and expanded its influence over other regions of Bali. The kingdom's golden era was during the reign of Dewa Agung Made Karna, also known as the \"Dalem Waturenggong,\" who ruled from 1710 to 1736.\n\nGelgel Dynasty: The Gelgel dynasty was the ruling dynasty of the Klungkung Kingdom. It played a crucial role in shaping the kingdom's culture, arts, and governance during its existence.\n\nDevelopment of Klungkung as the Cultural Center: Klungkung emerged as the cultural and artistic center of Bali during the Gelgel dynasty's rule. The kingdom supported the development of traditional Balinese arts, literature, and religious practices.\n\nKlungkung's Influence: The Klungkung Kingdom was not only influential on Bali but also had significant sway over neighboring islands. It maintained diplomatic relations with other kingdoms in Indonesia and traded with foreign merchants.\n\nDutch Colonization: In the late 19th century, the Dutch colonial forces began their expansion into Bali. They gradually took control of various Balinese regions, including Klungkung. The kingdom fiercely resisted Dutch rule, resulting in a series of battles known as the \"Puputan Klungkung\" in 1908.\n\nThe Puputan Klungkung: On September 28, 1908, the Dutch attacked the royal palace of Klungkung, leading to a last stand by the royal family and its followers. The ruler at the time was Dewa Agung Gusti Agung Nengah, along with his entire court and many loyal subjects. They chose ritual suicide (puputan) rather than surrendering to the Dutch. This tragic event became a symbol of Balinese resistance against colonial rule.\n\nThe End of the Kingdom: With the fall of Klungkung, the independent Klungkung Kingdom effectively came to an end. Bali eventually became a part of the Dutch East Indies, which later became Indonesia after gaining independence in the mid-20th century.\n\nToday, Klungkung remains an important cultural and historical center in Bali, with various landmarks and monuments dedicated to preserving the memory of its kingdom's past. The legacy of the Klungkung Kingdom continues to be a source of pride and inspiration for the people of Bali.\n\nKlungkung city or semarapura\n\nKlungkung, also known as Semarapura, is a town and the capital of Klungkung Regency. It is located in the eastern part of the island and holds historical and cultural significance.\n\nHistory:\n\nKlungkung has a rich history and was once the center of the Klungkung Kingdom, also known as the Gelgel Kingdom, which ruled over Bali in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The town's historical prominence is evident through its notable landmarks, palaces, and temples.\n\nKerta Gosa:\n\nOne of the most famous attractions in Klungkung is the Kerta Gosa, also known as the Hall of Justice. It is a historical landmark that served as the court of justice during the Klungkung Kingdom's reign. The main pavilion, adorned with intricate paintings on its ceilings, depicts scenes from ancient Hindu epics like the Mahabharata and Ramayana. These paintings were not only used for their aesthetic value but also to teach moral and ethical lessons to those brought before the court.\n\nPuri Semarapura:\n\nPuri Semarapura is the royal palace complex in Klungkung, which once served as the residence of the Klungkung kings. Although much of the original palace was destroyed during a Dutch colonial attack in 1908, some parts of it have been reconstructed and preserved. The palace complex offers insights into the architectural and cultural heritage of the Klungkung Kingdom.\n\nThis busy market town on the main road to Besakih and Amlapura is steeped in history and has some noteworthy sites, the Semara Pura Palace complex which houses the Hall of Justice and Kambang Pavillion.
