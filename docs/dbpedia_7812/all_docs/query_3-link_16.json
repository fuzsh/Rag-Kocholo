        "text": "Why is Bali Called the island of Gods because of the thick Hindu culture, such as the many offerings offered to guardian gods in various places in Bali.\n\nBali is a province located on a separate island, separated from other regions. Why is Bali Called the island of Gods most of the population of Bali is Hindu.\n\nBali’s tropical nature is beautiful, like a piece of heaven that fell to earth. Balinese people are also known to hold fast to their ancestors’ teachings and are loyal to guarding local cultural wisdom.\n\nIn the international world, Bali has many nicknames. It starts from the Island of the Gods, the Island of a Thousand Temples, Bali Dwipa, and other designations that have their meaning and history as the identity of the island of Bali. But among all these nicknames, the Island of the Gods is one of the most popular. Why is Bali called the Island of the Gods? Read the explanation.\n\nBali the Island of the Gods\n\nDewata in the Island of the Gods means a god with a lower position than the main gods, Shiva, Brahma, and Vishnu. While the Gods themselves in Hinduism and Buddhism are spiritual entities that have spiritual power to govern humans and the universe. Dewata can also mean the plural form of Dewa.\n\nWhy is Bali Called the Island of the Gods? Because almost an inch of land in Bali, there is a temple which is the seat of the gods, which is a manifestation of Ida Sang Hyang Widi Wasa or God Almighty in Hinduism. Every temple is believed to be the residence of the gods; the more temples mean, the more gods.\n\nBased on this, the nickname Island of the Gods can be interpreted as an island that is the abode of the gods in Hinduism. In addition, the island of Bali is known as the Island of the Gods because of the solid Hindu culture manifested through the many offerings offered to the guardian gods throughout the island of Bali.\n\nPeople on the island of Bali are mostly Hindus, who know many gods. Each Hindu caste has a patron deity, and every human activity has a divinity embodied in the spiritual realm or spiritual aspect. The gods tend to be equated with guardian spirits/angels or guardian jinn in the Abrahamic religion.\n\nBali was famous before Indonesia existed\n\nThe popularity of Bali crossed the globe long before the state of Indonesia was established. This was due to the strenuous efforts of the Dutch East Indies Colonial Government in the 1920-1930s. Bali and its people used to be an uncivilized area. Even the traditional Balinese clothes for women do not wear tops. They are also hard to beat.\n\nIn the 19th century, Bali failed to dazzle. The Dutch East Indies even considered them a threat. However, after being defeated in 1908, the Dutch East Indies realized the tourism potential of Bali. To the world, Bali was introduced as the Island of Heaven. After World War I, many figures came to Bali and produced works that tell the beauty of Bali.\n\nThe Reason Why Bali is Called the Island of the Gods\n\nWhy Bali is called the Island of the Gods because the population of Bali is predominantly Hindu.\n\nIn Hinduism, God or Ida Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa is manifested in the gods. Gods are sacred beings because they are an extension of the hand of God.\n\nDewata itself means more than one of the gods. Dewata is a word that can refer to a man or a woman.\n\nThat is, the gods concerned not only the gods but also the goddesses. In Hinduism, it is not only the male gods but many goddesses that guard every element of human life.\n\nYou may be interested to read 5 Bali Tourist Attractions You Must Visit\n\nBased on history, giving nicknames to Bali has been going on for a long time\n\nThe nickname for Bali has been around for a long time. However, the names are different. During the ancient Balinese kingdom under King Sri Kesari Warmadewa in Saka 804, Bali was known as Bali Dwipa. The golden history of Bali Dwipa was also recorded during the reign of King Udayana and Dalem Waturenggong. Until now, the symbols or symbols and writings of Bali Dwipa Jaya are still listed as symbols of the Province of Bali.\n\nOn the other hand, another view calls Bali Wali or Banten, which means offering. Regarding the nicknames of the Island of the Gods and the Thousand Temples Temple, Prof. Bantam, an academic at the Indonesian Art Institute (ISI) Denpasar, said that the Balinese people have never promoted their religion.\n\nHowever, the uniqueness of social life and Hinduism that the Balinese people carry out has attracted interest.
