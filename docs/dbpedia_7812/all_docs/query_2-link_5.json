        "text": "The Kingdom of Bali (914-1908) was an empire located on the islands of Bali and Lombok in present-day Indonesia with colonies on Java and Sumbawa. It was an uncivilized nation, and on 18 December 1858 it became a protectorate of the Netherlands. In 1908, after seven Dutch interventions on Bali, the country was occupied and annexed.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Bali Kingdom was created around 914 after Sri Kesari created the Belanjong pillar, which described his military campaign on Bali, uniting the tribes into a kingdom. Because of Bali's proximity to Java, Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism spread to Bali and shaped its culture. It was a small and peaceful empire up until the 19th century, when the Dutch East Indies carried out a series of military interventions against the minor kingdoms of Bali. In 1858, Bali was defeated at the Battle of Bali and became a protectorate, and all resistance was subdued within 50 years, when it became a region of the Netherlands' colonial empire."
