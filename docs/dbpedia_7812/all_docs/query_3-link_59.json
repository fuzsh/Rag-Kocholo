        "text": "Discovering Bali's breathtaking natural wonders is incomplete without visiting its exotic beaches. With over 300 stunning beaches to choose from in Bali alone, every beach is worth visiting, but you’d need several trips to attempt it!\n\nEngage in watersports activities like surfing while enjoying stunning views of the ocean. We have detailed articles on Bali’s best beaches (including best beaches for families, couples, honeymooners, teenagers, surfing and more!)\n\n5. Gorgeous accommodation in Bali\n\nLooking for a luxurious and private vacation in Bali? The island offers a variety of accommodation options, ranging from budget-friendly hostels to luxury villas and resorts. With stunning views of the island's natural beauty, including its beaches, rice paddies, and jungles, Bali is the perfect place to indulge in luxury while enjoying a relaxing vacation. As a bonus, most villas will have a private swimming pool so you don't have to share with anyone else.`\n\n6. Delicious food in Bali: local delicacies to international cuisine\n\nIf you are a foodie traveling to Bali, you are in for a treat when it comes to Balinese cuisine and the Bali international food scene.\n\nThe diverse and flavorful food scene with influences from Indonesian, Chinese, Indian, and European cuisines will leave you wanting more. Vegetarians and vegans will find plenty of options too since there is also a thriving vegetarian and vegan food scene. Satisfy your cravings by dining at local warungs (small family-owned restaurants) or go all-out with some fine dining experiences at one of the many luxury resorts and world-class restaurants on the island.\n\n7. Unique Balinese culture in Bali (as rich as Thailand)\n\nOne of the key things that makes Bali worth visiting is its unique and vibrant culture. Bali is home to the proud Balinese people, who are always willing to share their rich heritage with tourists.\n\nThe culture and religion, which is a beautiful blend of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Animism, can be experienced through local temples, markets, food, or by interacting with the friendly locals. If you're interested in history and traditions, then Bali is definitely on your bucket list.\n\n8. Amazing diving opportunities in Bali\n\nIf you are a diving enthusiast or want to learn how to dive in Southeast Asia's paradise Bali is worth visiting. The island offers magnificent diving opportunities with fascinating marine life such as manta rays and sea turtles amidst shipwrecks and coral reefs or visit underwater temples. From beginners to advanced divers can enjoy the dive sites on offer.\n\n9. Friendly locals in Bali\n\nWhen in Bali, you cannot miss out on experiencing the warmth and hospitality of the Balinese people. Their unique culture is evident in their traditional ceremonies, dances, and festivals which are a treat for the eyes. It's not just about their beautiful culture, but also their friendliness that makes Bali an evergreen destination for travelers. The smiling faces and helpful nature of the locals make it worth visiting Bali time and again.\n\n10. Captivating and beautiful religion\n\nEvery day, in every home, every village temple, and thousands of larger temples all over the island, Bali's Hindu religion is expressed in a million daily offerings.\n\nFrom the smallest religious gesture before starting work to the grandest ceremony like Galungan, Bali's religion inspires many travellers and broadens tolerance and understanding. Religion might not be on the top of your list of reasons to come, but I guarantee it will be a cultural aspect of your holiday you will remember the longest.\n\n11. Bali is an affordable destination\n\nBali is not only worth visiting but is also an affordable paradise in Southeast Asia. Bali offers a range of accommodations, from budget-friendly hostels to luxury villas with privacy policies that cater to all types of tourists. If you're traveling on a budget or just looking for value in Asia, Bali should be your first place to consider because of its budget-friendly lifestyle.\n\nHaving said that, Bali is currently having a debate about how it can move away from being seen as a budget destination and focus more on quality tourism. Leaders in Bali are discussing how they can attract fewer visitors who want to engage more in culture, sustainable and higher-value tourism.\n\nI’m talking about more of the sorts of experiences that Baligram promotes—cultural and natural attractions for thoughtful travelers—so you’re in the right place!\n\nOne option Bali’s leaders are discussing is a tax on visitors to discourage bad behaviour and that is sparking quite a debate, as you can imagine!\n\n12. Taking day trips to Nusa Penida or Java from Bali\n\nLooking to get beyond Bali’s hype? Consider taking day trips to nearby islands, such as Nusa Penida, or a side trip to Java from Bali. It's possible to become lost in the hype around Bali and miss experiencing some of its best nearby places.\n\nTaking a day trip or side trip can help you experience the natural wonders that Indonesia has to offer. Nusa Penida has one of the most beautiful nature scenes, with stunning landscapes and crystal-clear waters perfect for snorkeling and diving. Alternatively, head over to Java, where you can find historical places such as the Borobudur temple complex and Mount Bromo.\n\nMany of our readers want to see the Komodo Dragon, but it is not found in Bali. Instead, consider a side trip to the islands to the east of Bali, including Komodo Island and its renowned Komodo National Park. You can also find the Komodo Dragon on the islands of Rintja, Padar, and Flores.\n\n13. There are plenty of health and wellness facilities in Bali\n\nBali may be famous for its beaches and rice paddies, but it's also a paradise for those seeking health and wellness facilities. The Indonesian island offers something for everyone when it comes to yoga and meditation centers where you can rejuvenate your mind and body. Indulge in spa treatments with organic ingredients to pamper yourself. Make a beeline for healthy food cafes where you can try smoothie bowls made with tropical fruit.\n\n14. Spectacular beach clubs in Bali\n\nBali is a tropical paradise known for its magnificent beach clubs, which offer alluring views and luxurious amenities. These clubs provide an array of activities, like live music performances and fine dining experiences, that are sure to make your trip unforgettable. While enjoying your favorite cocktail during Bali's stunning sunset view, soak up the relaxed ambiance that embodies Balinese culture.\n\n15. Bali is a year-round destination\n\nBali's tropical climate makes it a popular destination all year. The island offers breathtaking scenery like lush rice paddies and stunning beaches that make it worth visiting for any traveler at any time of the year.\n\nI explore the options for the best time to visit Bali and dive even deeper in our article for the best month to visit Bali so if you are just in the planning stages, you’ll want to check these articles out.\n\n16. Bali has heaps of great shopping opportunities\n\nI don't want to preach, but I’m just saying it because there have been a few problems lately with naughty tourists!\n\nWhen exploring Bali's natural wonders and stunning scenery, I always try to remember to respect the local customs and traditions.\n\nThings like proper attire for temple visits and removing shoes before entering a temple are important. We can also avoid using our feet to point at or touch anything, as it is considered impure. Even pointing with a finger is considered inappropriate (Balinese will point with a thumb or indicate direction with a nod of the head).\n\nTourists should also consider supporting local businesses by bargaining respectfully and paying fair prices while shopping at vibrant markets. Sure, we don’t want to be ripped off either, but there’s a happy price - that’s when you and the merchant are happy!\n\nLastly, preserving the environment by avoiding littering or any activity harming wildlife and their habitats is a must-do in Bali. Sure, the locals generate a huge amount of litter and struggle with how to manage it, but that does not mean we as guests can't make the extra effort to be super good at keeping Bali clean.\n\n2. Travel sustainably\n\nTraveling to Bali is an amazing experience that should be undertaken with sustainability in mind. Some tips I try to follow are:\n\nOpt for eco-friendly accommodations that have a commitment to minimize environmental impact by reducing waste and conserving water.\n\nShow support for the local community by shopping at markets and eating at locally owned restaurants.\n\nTake public transportation or rent bicycles to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nReduce the use of plastics - embrace reusable water bottles and bring a cloth shopping bag.\n\n3. Do your research\n\nTo get the most out of your trip to Bali, it's essential to do thorough research beforehand. Begin by finding out when the best time to visit based on weather conditions and avoiding peak tourist seasons.\n\nMake sure you're aware of the visa requirements for Indonesia too. Learning about Balinese culture and customs is vital to ensuring that you don't accidentally offend locals during your stay. Finally, consider what activities you're interested in before you leave home and plan accordingly for an unforgettable trip.\n\nWhat are the cons of visiting Bali?\n\nWhile Bali has many attractions, there are some drawbacks to consider. Touristy areas can be overcrowded and traffic-heavy, while infrastructure may not meet Western standards. Visitors should also be wary of scams and petty crime, as well as the risk of getting \"Bali Belly\" from contaminated food or water.\n\n1. Traffic in Bali can be bad\n\nGetting around Bali can be a bit of a challenge due to the island's infamous traffic jams. During peak hours, you may find yourself stuck in heavy traffic that seems to move at a snail's pace. The island's infrastructure isn't the best either, which adds to the problem. However, with some planning and patience, it's still possible to enjoy all that Bali has to offer.\n\nRemember slow travel? Embrace the pace and take the journey as a chance to rest and revive (if you have a driver, that is!)\n\nTo avoid the traffic, consider hiring a motorcycle (while you still can!) or taking taxis or a private car and driver instead of driving yourself. Additionally, many areas, such as Ubud and Canggu, are easily explored on foot or bicycle. But don't be put off visiting because of traffic - it's not that bad. It keeps moving, there’s heaps to see and you'll get there eventually!\n\n2. Scams in Bali: Taxi's, ATM, Money and more\n\nWhile Bali is undoubtedly worth visiting for its stunning waterfalls and beautiful natural landscapes, tourists should also be aware of potential scams that may occur. These include ATM skimming, dodgy taxi meters, money changing scams and motorbike rental scams among others.\n\nI cover these in my article, ‘Bali Scams: Video Evidence and How To Avoid Being Fleeced’.\n\nTourists are advised to remain vigilant while keeping their valuables safe at all times to avoid falling prey to such incidents. It's essential to use reputable money changers and rent from trusted businesses while being cautious about pickpocketing or other petty crimes targeting tourists.\n\n3. Bali can be too touristy\n\nWell, as I said earlier, Bali is not too touristy, but it can be touristy at times, and it probably depends on your definition and where you choose to stay. Overcrowding, pollution, and scams are the main issues to consider.\n\nDespite these challenges, Bali still offers natural wonders such as stunning waterfalls and beautiful rice paddies.\n\nFor those who have a low tolerance for touristy locations, consider visiting East Bali and North Bali and discovering 'the real Bali'. I think these regions are the next frontier for tourism, so if you can visit soon, you will see them before they become the next hot spot.\n\n4. Bali has too many Instagram influencers\n\nFunny! Well......yes, this has become a bit of a problem, and the media is taking note.\n\nBut as long as the influencers keep their clothes on and respect the local laws, which most do, there's nothing wrong with being an influencer in Bali.\n\nInstead of sticking to hotspots like Ubud and Canggu, consider exploring lesser-known areas such as Nusa Penida, Lombok, or East and North Bali, as mentioned above, to avoid the crowds. Visiting during the less-crowded off-season can also help beat the influencer hype.\n\n5. Pollution and noise in Bali\n\nPollution and noise are two of the biggest issues facing Bali, and this is not just due to the increase in tourism. Overcrowding has led to environmental problems such as plastic pollution and sewage issues. It's important to be mindful of these challenges when exploring Bali's beautiful scenery and taking day trips to nearby destinations like Nusa Penida or Java.\n\n6. You might get Bali Belly\n\nOne risk that tourists often face is Bali Belly, an upset stomach caused by contaminated food or water. To avoid getting sick during your stay in Bali, make sure to drink bottled water and avoid ice cubes in drinks. Additionally, always peel fruits before eating them, wash your hands regularly, and carry hand sanitizer with you.\n\nBe prepared by reading our article, ‘What is Bali Belly? A Guide to Causes, Symptoms & Treatment’ and ‘What to do when you get Bali Belly: 6 Step Action Plan’\n\n7. You need a scooter or car to get around Bali (and a license!)\n\nGetting around Bali is best done with a scooter, as it is the most affordable and efficient option—at least, as long as the government does not actually go ahead and ban tourists from hiring them!\n\nScooter rental shops are widespread throughout the island; however, those who want to rent must have an international driver's license. Balinese authorities are trying to reduce foreigners' scooter rentals due to safety concerns. So make sure you rent from reputable sources only.\n\nWhere to stay in Bali\n\nBali is indeed worth visiting, and when it comes to deciding where to stay on this Indonesian island, the options are endless.\n\nUbud offers visitors a unique cultural experience with its serene rice paddies and temples, making it an ideal destination for yoga lovers.\n\nSeminyak boasts trendy bars and restaurants, perfect for digital nomads seeking inspiration.\n\nNusa Dua provides secluded resorts with pristine beaches and world-class amenities that will leave you feeling pampered and rejuvenated.\n\nMeanwhile, Canggu's laid-back surf town vibe and stunning sunsets make it an excellent choice for surfing enthusiasts.\n\nI discuss all the different areas you can stay in Bali and how to choose the best area to stay in with my article, ‘The Best Areas to Stay in Bali’ but here are a few quick tips:\n\nCanggu - A great place to stay in Bali for surfing\n\nIf you're planning to visit Bali and are a passionate surfer or just love being around beaches, Canggu is one of the best places to stay at. This beautiful destination has plenty of accommodation options that cater to all types of travelers- from budget-friendly hostels to luxurious villas. You'll be thrilled with the consistent waves that complement your surfing skills perfectly! And when you're not catching waves or sunbathing on the beach, explore the amazing restaurants and bars that Canggu has to offer. With its chilled-out atmosphere and friendly locals, Canggu is a paradise worth visiting in Bali.\n\nUbud - A great place to stay in Bali for yoga and culture\n\nIf you're looking to experience the cultural heart of Bali while immersing yourself in nature, Ubud is definitely worth visiting. Surrounded by lush green rice paddies and jungle forests, Ubud is the perfect spot for yoga enthusiasts or those interested in Balinese culture. With many yoga studios and retreats available at all levels, Ubud caters to every type of traveler. The town also boasts excellent art galleries, museums, and temples where visitors can learn about traditional Balinese art and architecture. Whether you're on a budget or looking for luxury accommodation, you'll find plenty of options in Ubud.\n\nKuta - A great place to stay in Bali for nightlife\n\nLooking for a place to party while in Bali? Consider staying in Kuta! It's a popular tourist destination that promises an unforgettable night out. From budget-friendly hostels to luxurious resorts, there are plenty of accommodation options available in this bustling area of Bali. Stepping out onto the streets of Kuta will lead you to fantastic dining experiences and exciting shopping opportunities, offering everything from unique souvenirs to high-end fashion pieces. It's also an ideal base to explore other parts of Bali, like Ubud or Seminyak, with ease. Keep in mind that while Kuta can be crowded and noisy, it's worth visiting for its lively atmosphere alone.\n\nVillas - A great accommodation option in Bali\n\nWhile exploring Bali, consider staying at one of the many villas. They offer privacy, luxury, and space and are perfect for families or groups of friends. From beachfront properties to secluded hilltop retreats, there are a wide range of options to choose from. Immerse yourself in Balinese culture while enjoying amenities like private pools and gardens and private dining as an alternative to a crowded restaurant.\n\nThis is a mere taste of all the amazing places to stay in Bali.
