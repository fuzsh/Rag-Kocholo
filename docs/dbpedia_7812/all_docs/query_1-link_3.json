        "text": "Here is everything you need to know before visit Bali\n\nThe island of Bali lies in the center of the Indonesian archipelago, between islands of Java and Lombok. Blessed with a sacred Mount Agung, countless breathtaking beaches, and incredibly beautiful nature, Bali also home for four million Indonesian Hindu populations. Local folks believe their island is the center of the spiritual universe. Balinese practice the concept of Tri Hita Karana which seeks the balance between human, natural and spirit worlds that turn the island of Bali into the exotic destination to explore.\n\nBali’s dry season spans from April to September with days characterized by clear skies and a lot of sunshine. The months of May, June, and September are arguably the best time to visit Bali when the weather conditions are idyllic but visitor numbers are not at their highest, it means the tourist attractions are less crowded. Temperatures in Bali are fairly consistent all-year-around, ranging from 26°C - 29°C.\n\nThe Majapahit Empire rule over Bali after Gajah Mada, Prime Minister of the Javanese king, defeated the Balinese king in Bedulu in 1343. The Majapahit capital in Bali was established at Samprangan and later moved to Gelgel. Gelgel remained the paramount kingdom in Bali until the second half of the 17th century. The rule of the Majapahit marks the strong of Javanese culture in Bali and influences most of the architecture, dance, theatre, literature, painting, sculpture and the wayang puppet theatre on this island. The few Balinese who didn't adopt this culture are \"Bali Aga\" (Original Balinese) who live in a few isolated villages until today.\n\nPEMUTERAN\n\nPemuteran is a fisherman village on the northern coast of West Bali. This is a small laid-back village which has become increasingly popular with visitors in recent years. As the location of the largest artificial Biorock reef project in the world, it shows there is a real spirit of marine conservation effort in this area. Not far from Pemuteran, the Menjangan island is a wonderful spot for diving and snorkeling. Here traveller can explore several coral walls and swim with thousand of tropical fish.\n\nUBUD\n\nUbud is an old town where the cultural heart of Bali lives on. Lies in the highland surrounded by beautiful nature, you only need two hours drive from the airport to reach this location. Ubud is home to Bali's royal family, you can visit the beautiful palace in the centre of town and take a stroll at the crafts centre around the Ubud Palace. There are hundreds of shops selling antiques, wood carvings, crafts, textiles, paintings and jewelry in Ubud Market. Here you will find some of the best art museums on the island."
