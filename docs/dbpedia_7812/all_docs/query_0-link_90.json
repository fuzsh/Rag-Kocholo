        "text": "Many foreign writers have expressed their fascination with Bali in their works, among them are Jamie James in Andrew and Joey: a tale of Bali and Elizabeth Gilbert in Eat, Pray, Love. The two authors wrote about Bali from their personal experience dring their stay in that island. Some images created in the works are seen and analyzed through the prespective of Postcolonialism and New Criticism. This article presents how the two authors depicts Bali as an extravagant place in Eastern country which has adopted some Western values. The negative image is delivered to oppose the idea of Bali as the perfect island; moreover, as part of Indonesia, Bali still has some weaknesses to strengthen and truly support that it is part of Indonesia. The writer admits that this article is far from perfect. Due to the limitation of thinking and time, some more aspects can be explored more profoundly in terms of the image of Bali in these two works. Hence, there are still a lot of literary works that al...\n\nThe idea of Balinese culture as a unique, largely timeless, harmonious synthesis of religion, custom and art is remarkably resistant to historical and contemporary evidence to the contrary. Such a hegemonic vision, however imaginary, conveniently underwrites both local politics and tourism, and so national and global capitalism. Against this ideal of Bali-as-Paradise, a critical analysis suggests a quite di erent metaphor—Bali-as-a-ba le eld—in many instances to be more appropriate and accurate. To understand why the Arcadian myth has proven so a ractive to both Balinese and foreigners, we need to examine the work done by social imaginaries. Hypostatizing, essentializing, then mythologizing, a largely imaginary monolithic ‘Balinese culture’ delivers a docile population which not only accepts, but enthusiastically embraces, their increasing alienation and their subjection to the political and economic forces of capitalism."
