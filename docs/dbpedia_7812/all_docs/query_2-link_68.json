        "text": "Bali is the most well-known destination among Indonesia’s 17,000 islands. We love that it offers something for everyone, whether you’re looking to chill out on the beach, find your zen in the many yoga studios, or delve into the island’s art scene. There’s also plenty to do for adventurous souls, be it hiking volcanoes at sunrise or swimming in waterfalls at sunset. Our travel experts at Plum Guide have spent plenty of time on the island, so if you’re still wondering why you should visit Bali, we’ve put together the top reasons we love it so much. We suspect you’ll book your flights well before you finish reading this article.\n\nBeaches are likely one of the first things that pop into mind when you think 'why visit Bali', and for a good reason – the island has an abundance of them, from stretches of white sands to secret coves tucked away in between dramatic cliffs. Most of the best beaches are found in the south of the island, particularly around the Bukit Peninsula.\n\nOne of our favourites is Padang Padang Beach, where the film Eat, Pray, Love was filmed. Nestled between vegetation-topped cliffs, it's a scenic little spot with clear turquoise waters. We recommend Berawa or Echo Beach for epic sunsets – you'll come across plenty of beach bars for sundowners. If you're after something a little quieter, Pandawa Beach is a lovely option with breathtaking views and fewer crowds.\n\nIt's no secret that Bali is a surfer's paradise, attracting amateurs and seasoned pros alike. Beginners will find numerous surf schools where friendly instructors guide you through the basics. Within a couple of lessons, you may even be mastering twists and turns. Some of the best spots for beginners and intermediate surfers with moderate-sized waves include Dreamland Beach, Kuta Beach and Medewi Beach.\n\nIf you're already pretty confident with a surfboard, you may want to head somewhere with bigger swells. The breaks in Uluwatu are particularly advanced, and waves can reach up to 15 feet during monsoon season. In particular, Padang Padang Beach has long tube rides and is home to the annual Rip Curl Cup, Indonesia's longest-running surf competition.\n\nIts unique and fascinating culture is one of the top reasons why you should visit Bali. Unlike the rest of Indonesia, Bali is predominantly Hindu, earning itself the nickname ‘Island of a Thousand Temples’. As well as a place for religious worship, these temples also serve as centres for cultural activities and performances like dance and gamelan, a traditional musical ensemble of percussion instruments like xylophones, gongs and drums. Pura Besakih is the largest temple on the island, but others worth seeing include Gunung Kawi, Pura Ulun Danu, Pura Lempuyang Temple and Taman Saraswati. Just keep in mind you may have to wear a sarong during your visits – you can likely pick one up from a nearby shop.\n\nIn addition to visiting temples, be sure to join in on the various festivals and celebrations taking place throughout the year. Some of the most popular include the parade before Nyepi, the day of silence. This is when huge monster floats are paraded down the streets to banish bad spirits. Another fun festival is Omed-Omedan, a ‘kissing’ festival to form friendships, meet someone, and maintain harmony and solidarity in the community.\n\nBali is one of the best places in the world to get in touch with your spiritual side. Most of the island’s yoga studios are based in Ubud, a beautiful town surrounded by verdant rainforest and lush rice paddies. You’ll find all kinds of classes, from Vinyasa and Hatha yoga to meditation, reiki and sound healing.\n\nThere are so many studios to choose from, but one of our favourite places is Ubud Yoga House, where you can practise downward dog in open-air studios overlooking the rice fields – you may get a little distracted by the view. Intuitive Flow is another popular studio tucked away in a quiet corner of Ubud with views down into the valley. For a truly unique experience, many studios on the southern coast will have sunrise or sunset yoga sessions on the beach – or, to really work your muscles, balanced atop a paddleboard.\n\nBali is a haven for shoppers looking to pick up unique souvenirs. Whatever you’re searching for, you’re bound to find it in the island’s many boutiques, shops and markets. For luxury brands and high street stores, head to the many malls such as Seminyak Village, Beachwalk Shopping Centre and Mal Bali Galeria. The island’s thriving arts scene is best explored in the many galleries, including Felizeye Art Painting Gallery Seminyak for a diverse range of art styles (they also have a store in Ubud), Nyaman Gallery for contemporary Bali-based artists, and Studio Eksotika for a blend of art and music performances. Bali also has many artisan workshops where you can browse for handmade crafts like lace, weavings, wood carvings or silver jewellery. You can even join a workshop to create a unique piece to take home.\n\nThe local food is a good enough reason why you should visit Bali. Indonesian cuisine is extremely diverse, influenced by many different cultures. Balinese food is known for its aromatic herbs, spices and fresh ingredients grown in its fertile volcanic soils. While you’re here, you must try babi guling, a spit-roasted suckling pig seasoned with local herbs and spices. Another delicious dish is ayam betutu, which is marinated chicken that has been slow-cooked in banana leaves – you can also find bebek betutu which is the same dish but with duck instead of chicken. By far, the most popular dish on the island is Nasi Goreng, consisting of stir-fried rice, vegetables and chicken or shrimp, topped with a fried egg.\n\nBeing surrounded by the sea, fresh seafood is a staple on the island. You’ll find seafood in most restaurants, but one of the best places to sample it is on Jimbaran Beach, which is known for its seafood restaurants lining the sands.\n\nWildlife enthusiasts will be in their element here in Bali. The Ubud Sacred Monkey Forest is home to thousands of long-tailed macaques, and you can watch cute baby macaques cling to their mother while others groom each other around the ancient temples. Be careful of your belongings though, as these cheeky primates are known to steal bags, hats and sunglasses. Another place to see animals in their natural habitat is the West Bali National Park. It’s home to over a hundred species of wildlife, including the endangered Bali starling, wild boars, deer and multiple bird species.\n\nFor outdoor lovers, the island’s incredible walks and hikes are one of the best reasons why you should visit Bali. Those who like a challenge will want to take on Bali’s many mountains, including the two active volcanoes of Mount Agung and Mount Batur. Mount Agung is the tallest on the island, sitting above the clouds at 3,031 metres. It’s a steep climb, and not for the faint-hearted. Mount Batur is much easier, and sunrise is the most popular time for the trek. At 1,717 metres, the summit offers jaw-dropping views of the caldera lake and across to Mount Rinjani on the neighbouring island of Lombok. Want something a little less strenuous? The trek between the two lakes of Danau Tamblingan and Danau Buyan is a fantastic option. It should take you about four hours one way, leading you through the shaded highland forest.\n\nAs well as nature trails, Bali is home to many spectacular waterfalls tucked away in the dense jungle. One of the most popular ones is Gitgit Waterfall with its 35-metre drop – but be careful when swimming here, as legend has it that couples who swim together under the falls will soon separate. Another beautiful spot is Sekumpul Waterfall. It’s a collection of seven different falls and is best admired from a distance so you can appreciate its scale. For the best swimming and photo opportunities, we highly recommend Banyumala Waterfall. With water cascading down green cliffs and boulders into a turquoise plunge pool, this waterfall is like something out of a postcard.\n\nBesides being a haven for relaxation, Bali also has a reputation for nightlife – if you’re up for a night out or two while you’re here, you won’t be disappointed. You’ll find something to suit all kinds of tastes, from rowdy clubs to chilled-out beach bars and hidden speakeasies. Kuta is the most famous party area in Bali, with its main street, Jalan Legian, lined with clubs, bars and pubs offering cheap drink deals, DJ performances, and live music. It’s a favourite with revellers, so if you’re looking for something more refined, then we recommend heading to Seminyak. It attracts a hipper crowd with more sophisticated venues."
