Felicity Shagwell, is a fictional character in the 1999 film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, portrayed by Heather Graham.[1]

Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me[]

In the film, Felicity is a CIA agent living in London in 1969, partnered with Austin Powers in order to stop Dr. Evil.[2]

She is known for having sex with Dr. Evil's accomplice Fat Bastard in order to place a tracking device inside of him. Despite this encounter, she still desires Austin and flirts with him throughout the film.

She and Austin travel to Evil's Moon base together. They separate, and when Austin enters the control room after fighting Mini-Me, Felicity is shown to have been captured, bound, and placed in a container with a glass front that is filling with gas. Austin does not have enough time to save her and stop the laser destroying Washington, causing her to die. However Dr. Evil tells Austin he can go back in time to save her, which Austin does. His past self stops the laser while Austin saves Felicity. After destroying Dr. Evil's moon base, Austin and Felicity both return to 1999 after Austin persuades her that nothing important happens between 1969 and 1999 ("There's a gas shortage and A Flock of Seagulls... that's about it!"). Fat Bastard attempts to kill Austin, but she karate chops the gun out of his hand and kicks him in the testicles. At the end she is shown having sex with Austin's past self, who also used the time machine to escape the base.

Disappearance from the series[]

Heather Graham did film a scene for the sequel, Austin Powers in Goldmember, but it was cut from the final version and did not appear on a DVD release. A book, which tied in with all three films, says that Felicity stayed in the present, but realized that Austin was still in love with Vanessa Kensington. The two parted ways, but Felicity did not travel back to the 1960s, as most of the battles against sexism had already been won.
