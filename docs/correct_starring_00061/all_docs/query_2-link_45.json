        "text": "Meet Mini-Me: Actor to be at Elmira Comic-Con\n\nWhen you’re Verne Troyer, life can get pretty strange.\n\nNot just because the actor, at 2-foot-8, is one of the shortest men in the world. And not just because he’s readily recognized as Mini-Me, the diminutive clone sidekick of Dr. Evil in two “Austin Powers” films.\n\nNo, sometimes the way that fans greet him — with an extended middle finger, one of the mute Mini-Me’s signature moves — can be a little puzzling.\n\nAt one fan convention, “a father came up and he’s holding probably a 2- or 3-year-old girl, and as soon as she saw me, she flipped me off!” Troyer recalled with a laugh last week. “I think she watched the movie with her dad and he taught her. I’m not saying that’s a good thing — she’s a little too young to be watching that type of movie.”\n\nOver the past two decades, Troyer has built an unlikely Hollywood career, starting with stuntman roles in movies such as “Baby’s Day Out” (his first big break), “Men in Black” and “Mighty Joe Young.” He became a pop-culture icon thanks to 1999’s “Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me” and its 2002 sequel, “Austin Powers in Goldmember.”\n\nSince then, he’s had starring roles in “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” “The Love Guru” and “The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.” He’s also appeared in reality shows such as “The Surreal Life,” “Celebrity Big Brother” and — earlier this year — “Celebrity Wife Swap” with girlfriend Brittney Powell, an actress and former Playboy Bunny.\n\nLocal fans will get the chance to meet Troyer this weekend at Twin Tiers Comic-Con in Elmira, where he’s the headliner among a roster of comic-book and pop-culture guests.\n\n“I think it’s important. When you’re an entertainer, you go out there and entertain people,” he said. “It’s great to meet the fans, take pictures, say ‘hi.’”\n\nWhile visiting his parents in Michigan last week, the 46-year-old actor took time to discuss his upbringing, his career and what it’s like working with Austin Powers himself, Mike Myers.\n\nQUESTION: I was reading that your family background is Amish, even though you weren’t raised in the Amish faith. That must have been a very interesting experience growing up in that community.\n\nTROYER: I was a year old when my parents switched from Amish to English. I still grew up in the community — all my grandparents, aunts and uncles were all still Amish. I would go to the Amish church with them, and it really was a different experience compared to what I’m used to now.\n\nNowadays it’s changing a little bit. They’re allowed to be able to use a cell phone as long as it’s in their barn — they can’t use it in the house.\n\nQ: Did you have any aspirations to be an actor before you started working as a stuntman? Did you ever think this is how your life was going to go?\n\nTROYER: I never imagined it would be like this. When I was growing up as a kid in high school, there was a movie that I saw called “Willow,” and I said, “I can do that.” I wanted to — I just didn’t know how to get started.\n\nA little bit later, I moved to Texas and was working as a customer service operator at Sprint for 31/2 years. Then I got my big break to be a stunt double for a 9-month-old baby in “Baby’s Day Out.”\n\nQ: As a stuntman or an actor, have you ever been asked to do any stunts where you thought, “I’m not sure I should be doing this”?\n\nTROYER: I’ve done some dangerous things, but I didn’t really think twice about it because this is something I wanted to do. If you watched “Jingle All the Way,” there’s a small Santa Claus on top of Arnold [Schwarzenegger] who gets punched. I was on a ratchet and flew back 20 feet into a bunch of boxes.\n\nQ: You have to have a lot of trust that that’s going to go well.\n\nTROYER: Yes, those were some stunt guys I knew, so I trusted them. It went well — I was just a little sore the next day. You get the aches and pains — and I’m feeling some of that now — but it was fun, and I still try to do it as much as I can.\n\nQ: Your breakout role was as Mini-Me in the “Austin Powers” movies. Were they as much fun to make as they are to watch?\n\nTROYER: I had a blast. It’s one of the best times I’ve ever had on a movie set. You never know what Mike [Myers] is going to do — he likes to improv a lot, so you have to be on your toes and respond to what he’s doing, and most of the time it’s not in the script. That makes it fun and challenging.\n\nNormally, we’d do a couple that are close but not exactly the way they are in the script, but after that, Mike like to play with it. The ones that we just played with usually ended up in the movie.\n\nQ: What do you think you learned from making those films or from your film career in general? I know you’ve said you haven’t had any formal acting training.\n\nTROYER: I’ve been in the business for a long time, so even when I was a stuntman, I watched people and what they did with camera angles and stuff like that. I know what’s going on now, and I really enjoy it more and more and more. Maybe one day I could try a stab at directing something.\n\nQ: Were you ready for the sudden fame that you had after the first “Austin Powers” movie you were in came out?\n\nTROYER: I was not prepared — and still to this day, I’m a little surprised now and then. I seem to forget and then I’m brought back to reality.\n\nI travel a lot, and one of my favorite places to go is Thailand. They can’t speak English, but they can somehow say “Mini-Me.” It’s very weird! [laughs]\n\nQ: I’m sure you get asked this all the time, but is there any word about an “Austin Powers 4”?\n\nTROYER: It’s just rumors at this point. If I knew, I’d tell you. It’s Mike’s baby, and he likes to make it bigger and better, so I don’t know how much bigger and better he can get.\n\nQ: I’m always amazed at the popularity of those films. It was only after the first one came out on home video that it became really popular.\n\nTROYER: I wasn’t in the first one but I watched it and fell in love with it, so it was quite a coincidence that I got to be in the next two. I guess it was fate.\n\nQ: At this point in your career, do you need to audition for roles, or do directors and producers know you and when you’re a good fit?\n\nTROYER: I’ve had people sometimes write things for me and put them in the script, or they think I’m the right fit when thinking outside of the box. Like in the movie “The Love Guru,” I played a professional hockey coach. You don’t see too many little people being a hockey coach! That was for a tall person, but Mike thought outside of the box and offered me the job.\n\nThat’s what’s really cool — when somebody does that so I can show them exactly what I can do.\n\nQ: And it must be flattering when someone calls up and says, “Hey, Verne — we wrote you a part!”\n\nTROYER: Very flattering — especially with the movie I did with Terry Gilliam, “The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.” He wrote it with me in mind, and working with a very talented director like that is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\n\nIf you know Terry Gilliam, he directs and produces things not in the typical way — he just does it his way and it turns out amazing. Sometimes he doesn’t get the backing that he needs, but he still figures out a way to incorporate that into the movie. I like to call him “crazy cool”! [laughs]\n\nThere are so many amazing actors who wish they had the chance just to work with him. It was a great experience for me. I actually worked with him twice — I also had a bit part in “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.”\n\nQ: Do you feel like your success is an inspiration to others who face physical challenges?\n\nTROYER: Yeah, that’s the way I was raised by my parents. They taught me that I can do anything I can set my mind to. I have an older brother and younger sister who are average size. I grew up on a farm and had to do chores and things like that, and I could do everything they had to do. That really gave me the opportunity and the ability to do what I do.\n\nI owe it to my parents. If it hadn’t been for them, I probably wouldn’t be doing what I’m doing.\n\nQ: So are there things on your agenda coming up that people should know about?\n\nTROYER: Coming out the end of this year or the beginning of next year is a comedy called “420.”\n\nQ: Gee, I wonder what that’s about?\n\nTROYER: I wonder, too! [laughs] I play a drug dealer and an arms lord named Tito — I’m supposed to be Hispanic. I don’t look Hispanic at all!\n\nAlso at T2C2\n\nIn addition to “Austin Powers” actor Verne Troyer, the second annual Twin Tiers Comic-Con — which grew out of the earlier Hero Bot Con — will bring a variety of pop-culture and comic-book guests to First Arena in Elmira this weekend.\n\nReturning for a second year is writer/director/producer Lloyd Kaufman, co-founder of Troma Entertainment — the company behind such cult films as “The Toxic Avenger” (and its sequels), “Class of Nuke ‘Em High,” “Cannibal! The Musical.”\n\nNew this year are two former cast members from children’s TV hit “The Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers”: David Yost (The Blue Ranger) and Walter Jones (The Black Ranger).\n\nMore than 20 comic-book artists and writers are also scheduled to attend, including James O’Barr (creator of “The Crow”), Rodney Ramos (penciler/inker for “Spider-Man,” “X-Men,” “Iron Man,” “Batman” and “Wonder Woman”), Dennis Calero (artist/illustrator for “X Factor” and “Legion of Superheroes”), Tom Peyer (former editor/writer for DC Comics/Vertigo), Mike Raicht (writer for “Wolverine,” “Stuff of Legend” and “Deadpool”) and Jerry and Penelope Gaylord (“Fanboys vs. Zombies”).\n\nTwin Tiers Comic-Con also will feature video game tournaments, cosplaying (costumes), gaming demonstrations, vendors, art exhibits and autograph sessions. Guests can also attend question-and-answer panels hosted by comic and film industry professionals. A costume contest will give the chance to win prizes, and there will be photo opportunities with props such as the DeLorean time machine from “Back to the Future,” the Jeep from “Jurassic Park,” the Chevy Impala from “ Supernatural” and the TARDIS from “Doctor Who.”\n\nFollow Chris Kocher on Twitter: @RealChrisKocher\n\nIf You Go\n\n•What: Twin Tiers Comic-Con\n\n•Where: First Arena, Elmira\n\n•When: 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Saturday; 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday"
