        "text": "Rumor has it she's in.\n\nHeather Graham wouldn't turn down a fourth Austin Powers movie, but she can't confirm a reboot, either.\n\nParade chatted with the actress late last week, and when we asked about her interest in rejoining the cast for the possibility of another installment, she said that \"of course\" she would want to be involved should a pitch be moved to production.\n\n\"I love working with Jay Roach and Mike Myers; they're so nice, of course,\" she said of working with the series' director, Roach, and the trilogy's co-creator, Myers, who also served as the movie's namesake lead actor.\n\nGraham, 53, portrays Felicity Shagwell in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, the second film in the franchise, which debuted in June 1999 and grossed $206,756,056 worldwide.\n\nShe noted that while fans continue chattering in hopes of another flick from franchise creators, she personally hasn't heard any talk about a reboot. Myers, however, did previously hint at the possibility of a fourth film, telling reporters, \"I don't know. I'm gonna put a big, firm, written maybe on that.\"\n\nSo while fans of the spy action comedy series patiently cross their fingers in hopes that the rumors are true and one day we could see a fourth film, the actress is more than happy to lend her talent to other projects and is actually gearing up for the big release of her newest feature, in which she portrays Terri White, a mother and survivor of an unimaginable set of circumstances.\n\nGraham, joined by cast mates Dennis Quaid and Jesse Metcalfe, is set to star in the Amazon original movie On a Wing and a Prayer, based on the extraordinary true story of a family's harrowing journey to land a plane safely after their pilot unexpectedly dies mid-flight.\n\nThe film's official synopsis reads: \"With no experience flying the twin-engine aircraft, Doug White (Quaid) struggles to save his entire family from seemingly certain tragedy. With the help of a far-flung group of determined 'angels,' including experienced pilot Kari Sorenson (Metcalfe), who join forces in a race against time and weather, the Whites learn a great deal about themselves, each other, and the miracles that simple faith can achieve.\"\n\nDirected by Sean McNamara (Soul Surfer) and written by Brian Egeston (House of Payne), the movie was produced by Marco Henry, with the story's subject, White, serving as co-producer. On a Wing and a Prayer is set to premiere on Friday, Apr. 7, exclusively via Amazon Prime Video."
