        "text": "Austin Powers, you either love him or hate him. I used to be a big fan back when the original \"International Man of Mystery\" film was released. I thought it was brilliant comedy, and Dr. Evil is a classic character. It's a good send-up of classic Bond films, which I am also a fan of.\n\nI was not all that impressed with \"The Spy Who Shagged Me\". Yes, there were some hilarious moments, but the other problems still remain:\n\n1) I hated the way they killed off Elizabeth Hurley. There could have done something-- anything-- that would have worked better than what they went with. A fembot? Completely ridiculous.\n\n2) The movie was filled with plot holes. I know it's just a silly comedy, but at least the first one was somewhat smart, and had a soul to it.\n\n3) Heather Graham is a bad, bad actress!\n\n4) Fat Bastard is not, I repeat NOT funny. Not even in the most remote possible way.\n\nMini-Me, however, was great.\n\nNow on to my questions: The new movie, Goldmember, will be released this summer. How good do you think it will be? How will it be received by the audience? Do we want another Austin Powers, or are we sick of him? I think that if the movie is good, perhaps it can redeem the franchise. Seeing as how Heather Graham and Fat Bastard are both in the film, I have little hope.\n\nI nearly wore out my original Austin Powers VHS tape, but I think I may have grown out of him. Any thoughts? Should I reconsider? Am I being to harsh on the guy? I have always been a big Mike Myers fan.\n\nIt looks as if MGM, along with the team behind the James Bond franchise, is trying to kill the title of the next Austin Powers: GOLDMEMBER. Here is a related story:\n\n007 Dis(Gold)members Austin Powers:\n\nForget Dr. Evil and Mini-Me, it's apparently James Bond that poses the biggest threat to Austin Powers.\n\nThe International Man of Mystery has been shaken, stirred and otherwise dismembered by 007. Or make that dis-Goldmember-ed.\n\nMGM and Danjaq, the British company that controls the Bond film license, have obtained a cease-and-desist order against New Line Cinema that prohibits New Line from calling the latest installment of Mike Myers' shagadelic spy series Austin Powers in Goldmember.\n\nApparently, the 007 folks weren't too keen on the double entendre of Goldmember--a takeoff on the 1964 Bond classic, Goldfinger--and released the legal hounds to force the name change.\n\n\"MGM/UA and Danjaq have a zero-tolerance policy towards anyone who tries to trade in on the James Bond franchise without authorization,\" says an MGM spokesperson.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, New Line has begun frantically recalling all promotional materials--posters, trailers, photos and anything else that bears the name Goldmember--from movie theaters, TV stations, Websites and other media outlets.\n\n\"We are currently in the arbitration process and trying to resolve this matter under the MPAA guidelines,\" the studio says in a statement. \"Until that time, we will be referring to the film as the third installment of Austin Powers.\"\n\nThe suddenly untitled flick, which began shooting late last year, could require some serious tweaking if New Line can't get the Bond folks to budge. In addition to playing Powers, Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard, Myers was reportedly going to add a new character to his repertoire. The name? Goldmember.\n\nOne of the most anticipated films of 2002, the latest Austin Powers misadventure will costar Michael Caine as Austin's dad and Destiny Child's BeyoncÃ© Knowles as the love interest. Returning cast members include Michael York, Robert Wagner, Seth Green, Mindy Sterling and Verne Troyer. Jay Roach once again mans the director's seat.\n\nNew Line is banking on the film's success. The first installment Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery grossed $88 million worldwide and its sequel, The Spy Who Shagged Me more than tripled that sum, earning $310 million, making it the highest grossing film in New Line's history. Myers reportedly netted $25 million for the third episode.\n\nMGM and Danjaq have been fiercely protective of their multibillion-dollar Bond cash cow over the years. They successfully sued Sony in 1997 after the studio tried to lauch its own 007 film.\n\nThe next Bond film, starring Pierce Brosnan and Halle Berry and tentatively titled Bond 20, began shooting in England this month for a holiday release. (end story)\n\nWell, I happen to know a little about the film industry, and entertainment law, and I know for certain that MGM can't win this case because Powers is protected under copyright law as a \"parody\". But there is always a slim chance they could win (It is Hollywood after all). What happens then? What will the new title be? And what will happen to the story, featuring a main character named Goldmember?? Can MGM also shut down this thread because it features the name \"Goldmember\" in it?? All movie posters and trailors have been destroyed!!"
