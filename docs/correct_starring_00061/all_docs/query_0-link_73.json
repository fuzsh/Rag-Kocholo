        "text": "American actress Heather Graham made her film debut in the eighties hit License to Drive.\n\nThe star, now 54, went on to become an it-girl of the nineties and early 2000s thanks to roles in the likes of Scream, Boogie Nights â€“ and even made an appearance in Lenny Kravitz's American Woman music video.\n\nShe soon achieved sex symbol status in Hollywood, appeared in the Hangover, and has just directed her new film called Chosen Family, which co-stars Julia Stiles.\n\nHere, 9honey Celebrity takes a look at what happened to Heather Graham - and where she is now.\n\nREAD MORE: What happened to the Culkin brothers?\n\nWhat is Heather doing now?\n\nIn recent years, the Hollywood star has turned to directing, celebrating the release of her new film Chosen Family this year.\n\nThe first film she wrote and directed was 2018's Half Magic, centering on a woman dealing with a chauvinistic boss and sexism.\n\nShe previously told Interview magazine about making the film, saying: \"When you make a movie you can tell a story from your own perspective and tell the story you want to tell.\"\n\n\"I wanted to inspire and empower women, and men too, by opening up a conversation about sexism, relationships, and sexuality,\" she said.\n\n\"I think women in our culture are presented with a mixed message. On one hand we're told \"your looks are the most important thing and you have to look sexy\" while we're also told \"don't be too sexy or we're gonna judge you harshly.\" '\n\nShe said culture is ''sexist\" and added: \"In film and in life, women are punished for things that men are celebrated for. \"\n\nREAD MORE: What happened to Ruby Rose?\n\nWhat movie made Heather famous?\n\n1998's Boogie Nights (released in Australia that year but '97 in the U.S.) co-starring the likes of Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore and Burt Reynolds really helped put Graham on the map.\n\nShe played adult-film star Rollergirl in the hit film.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo about the role and her nude scene in the film, she said: \"That was my first time [doing a nude scene], and I was so nervous about it.\"\n\n\"But at that point in my career I was also like, 'Beggars can't be choosers.' It was a great script and Paul was an amazing talent. I had a great time making that movie even though it was terrifying doing a nude scene.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes' relationship timeline: From how they met to their children and rumoured wedding\n\nSpeaking to Women's Health about her sex symbol status, Graham said she always thought she was a ''nerd\".\n\n''I always wanted to be the pretty girl but I thought I wasn't. When I started acting and getting pretty girl roles, I felt like I was just pretending, and nobody saw I was just this big nerd.''\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here.\n\nHeather on starting a family and relationships\n\nGraham has never been married or had kids, and she's spoken out about why she's content with her life the way it is.\n\nShe is currently dating snowboarder John de Neufville - and the pair are often taking vacations together and look happier than ever.\n\nSpeaking candidly to People last year, she said: \"I think we all have different paths.\"\n\n\"You just have to embrace the one that you're on. If, somehow, I had had kids, I'm sure that would've been cool. But at the moment, not having kids, I do feel free. And I get a lot of sleep. That is pretty great.\"\n\nShe added that there's a difference between a man and a woman saying they haven't had kids or don't want them.\n\n\"I do feel like as a woman, culturally, you're not allowed to say, 'I didn't want to have kids. Because it's like, what's wrong with you?'\" she explained.\n\nShe has been linked to Leonardo DiCaprio and Josh Lucas in the past.\n\nThe actress also dated Australian actor Heath Ledger before he died in 2008 at the age of 28.\n\n\"Going through my photos I found these. Just remembering this time. Heath Ledger was such a special person,\" she wrote on Instagram underneath snaps of the pair together.\n\nNetworth\n\nGraham reportedly has a networth of $US20million, or $AU30.6million.\n\nShe recently turned to activism and previously appeared in an advert for MoveOn.Org about the health care crisis in the U.S."
