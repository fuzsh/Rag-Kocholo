        "text": "Diana Abbott is just one of those naturally talented 21-year-olds … OK, so she has a bachelor’s degree in mass communications from UNCA, and, well, true, she wrote for the Blue Banner while in college. But in addition to her scholastic background, Diana just has a flair for the spirit of film critique. As a current employee of the Hollywood-Regal Cinema 14, Diana got to preview The Spy Who Shagged Me in advance, and it appears that the film got her mojo in gear. So, good news for the groovus maximus Mike Myers — Diana has agreed to review his latest film, and it sounds like the mad Mr. Myers has found a future shagette in the talented Ms. Abbott. Read on:\n\nYeah, baby! Mike Myers swings back onto the screen in The Spy Who Shagged Me — a movie that lives up to, and even surpasses its predecessor: 1997’s Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. And unless you’ve lived under a rock for the last couple of years, you all know that Man of Mystery first introduced audiences to the wild swinger from the ’60s, Austin Powers (Myers), and his nemesis, Dr. Evil (Myers). The Spy Who Shagged Me reunites all the old crew from the first movie (Robert Wagner, Seth Green, Mindy Sterling, Michael York and Elizabeth Hurley), while time traveling back to the swingin’ ’60s, where Dr. Evil sets out, once again, to steal Austin’s mojo. Now, should Evil rob Powers of his most-prized mojo, Austin would, in the future, be rendered powerless (and worst of all, impotent!). Privy to the intentions of his enemy, Austin also travels back to the ’60s to defend his mojo, and to stop Dr. Evil from blowing up the world with a laser. Now, there is no subject too taboo, no joke too corny, and no product endorsement too blatant, as the film’s screenplay keeps the audience gasping for air between laughs. Myers plays three roles this time around, one of whom (the biggest, weighing in at a metric ton) is Fat Bastard, who brings clever thievery and an unwholesome love for babies to the film. Heather Graham (Boogie Night‘s Roller Girl) appears as a CIA agent, Felicity Shagwell, sent to help Austin fight Dr. Evil, while also serving as his shagalicious new love interest. But, one of the funniest and most diabolical new characters is Verne Troyer, as Dr. Evil’s clone, Mini-Me, who embodies all of the doctor’s evil, but who is one-eighth the size. From its swingin’ ’60s atmosphere to its psychedelic VW Beetle time machine, every aspect of The Spy Who Shagged Me is bigger, better and more shagadelic than before. And, just for the record, director Roach proves that he can do it again, and that he’s not just a one-hit wonder. Yeah, baby, yeah!"
