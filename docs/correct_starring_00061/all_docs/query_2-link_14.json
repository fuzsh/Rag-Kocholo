        "text": "Although comedic character actress Mindy Sterling had been working in film and television for nearly two decades, it was not until she portrayed Dr. Evil's shrieking Germanic henchwoman, Frau Farbissina, in Mike Myers' spy spoof \"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery\" (1997) and its sequels that she achieved a degree of popular recognition. Sterling moved to Los Angeles from Miami in the early 1970s, where she joined the improvisational comedy troupe the Groundlings. While there, she not only improved her skills, but created long-lasting professional relationships with such notables as Phil Hartman and Lisa Kudrow. Work on high-profile series, including turns on \"The Larry Sanders Show\" (HBO, 1992-98) and \"Friends\" (NBC, 1994-2004) preceded her breakout performance as Farbissina in Myers' hit comedy and its sequel \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\" (1999). With her Hollywood stock on the rise, Sterling landed co-starring roles in features like \"Drop Dead Gorgeous\" (1999) and recurring turns on popular series like \"Desperate Housewives\" (ABC, 2004-12). Utilizing her highly animated features and razor-sharp comic sensibilities honed during her years at the Groundlings, Sterling ensured herself a lengthy career on screens big and small."
