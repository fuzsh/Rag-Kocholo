        "text": "Join Samm Levine as he sits down with actress Mindy Sterling (Austin Powers series, Con Man). Mindy chats about flunking all but theater classes in college, her preference for improv over scripted, and accidentally leaving the price tags on furniture.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Littleton Coin Co. (www.littleton.com/chatshow).\n\nWelcome to Season 2 of the new and improved The Black List Table Reads with Franklin Leonard. Expect a full earmovie in its entirety with superb sound design. There wasn’t a dry eye in the house during our recording of Jared Frieder’s moving dark comedy, Three Months: the story of a queer Miami teen who gets exposed to HIV, and must wait for his diagnosis. Three Months won the Austin Film Festival Best Comedy Screenplay award in 2014, and for good reason! Our presentation stars Mindy Sterling, Ritesh Rajan, Jee Young Han, Philip Casnoff, Kofi Siriboe, Gerald Downey, Frances Fisher, Obba Babatunde, Christopher Cousins, Jared Frieder, and Cooper Thornton.\n\nSo you guys, the Earwolf studio is being inspected for mold! Fortunately, Drew and his friends Mindy and Karen have big plans while we wait for it to be available. They’ll all do some scene study and get to know themselves better as an actor. They can catch up on the latest episode of The Actor’s Little Corner. Oh, they might even take a trip to Hawaii! Who are we kidding, they’re just going to sit around and watch Youtube videos. But while they wait, could you maybe take care of their pets?"
