        "text": "Post by ck100 on\n\nProbably my favorite of the three \"Austin Powers\" movies. Not a great or perfect comedy, but there are some inspired laughs when it hits. I remember when the movie first came out how the trailer encouraged people to go see \"The Phantom Menace\" first since the filmmakers and Mike Myers knew it was going the big movie of the summer. It's been many years since I last watched it, but I remember various things like \"Mini-Me\", Rob Lowe's dead-on Robert Wagner impression, Jerry Springer's cameo, \"Just the Two of Us\" music scene, introducing \"mojo\" in pop culture vocabulary, the phallic spaceship causing characters to have different names for it as we cut to each character, etc.\n\nLeonard Maltin Movie Guide Review:\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) - 2.5 out of 4 stars\n\n\"More swingin' '60s lunacy as Dr. Evil returns to Earth with a time-travel machine and goes back to 1969 to steal Austin's mojo. More laughs than the original--and more than enough gross-out gags--although it's still spotty. Several star cameos, though Troyer, as Mini-Me, steals the film. Myers cowrote and coproduced. Followed by AUSTIN POWERS IN GOLDMEMBER. Super 35.\"\n\nPost by JudgeJuryDredd on\n\nNot as fresh as International Man of Mystery obviously, but Rob Lowe was definitely great. Still pretty decent, and miles better than Goldmember...that thing was wretched.\n\nRob Lowe also acted for the first but his scene got cut, it was pretty funny but understandably it slowed the movie down.\n\nGoldmember has a couple of jokes that work, but otherwise it is pretty disposable. It generally forgets it is supposed to spoof spy pictures, the make-up quality is not up to par with the other two entries (you can clearly see Myers is wearing a cap as Dr. Evil, and as Fat Bastard you can tell he is wearing a suit because even in the slightest move you notice air tubes) and Beyonce Knowles, in addition to not having the acting skills at the time to keep up with Myers and everyone else, has really nothing to do, there is nothing for her to play off of with Myers like Hurley and Graham had.\n\nSpeaking of which, why hasn't Graham's deleted scene made it online already?\n\nPost by moviebuffbrad on\n\nNot as fresh as International Man of Mystery obviously, but Rob Lowe was definitely great.

Goldmember is a pretty pointed parody of Goldfinger, and Caine's casting is an homage to Harry Palmer. Foxy Cleopratra is an obvious reference to blaxploitation, but I thought those were more detective movies than spy-oriented, but I admittedly am not an expert there. Otherwise, I suppose it does kind of drop that angle.\n\nWhat was the Heather Graham scene supposed to be like?\n\nPost by JudgeJuryDredd on\n\nRob Lowe also acted for the first but his scene got cut, it was pretty funny but understandably it slowed the movie down.\n\nGoldmember has a couple of jokes that work, but otherwise it is pretty disposable.

I am pretty sure the intention was to make reference to the fact that because it was a new movie they needed a new female lead. I think everyone except the first sounds plausible, because in the opening of the second film Powers gets over the loss of his wife fairly quickly."
