        "text": "Heather Graham was brought up to be a good Catholic girl. But on screen, she played the porn star Rollergirl in Boogie Nights, the dark study of the 70s sex industry, and we are about to see her as CIA agent Felicity Shagwell (\"Shagwell by name, shag very well by reputation\") in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. Her career - like her characters - is going all the way.\n\nThe spy spoof sequel, in which Dr Evil steals Austin Powers's sexual mojo, knocked The Phantom Menace off the top slot at the US box office with a record-breaking $54.7m in its opening weekend (about as much as the first Austin Powers took in total in the cinemas). The first beneficiary is obviously Mike Myers as writer, producer, hero, villain and a 700lb Scotsman called Fat Bastard. But Austin Powers has mojo enough for two. Suddenly Heather Graham is a name in Hollywood, with street recognition, a fashion campaign for Emmanuel Ungaro and mushrooming web sites.\n\nThe Austin Powers phenomenon has been boosted by deals with Heineken, with Virgin Airlines (\"New York to London five times a day! Yeah, baby!\") and the sale of $1,000 Powers party packs on the internet. A soundtrack with Madonna, the Who and Mel G probably helps too. The States have gone shag crazy and the word has entered the lexicon, though Myers was surely taking a gamble on its comprehensibility.\n\n\"I knew what shagged meant because I've worked in England,\" says Graham rather proudly. She made Lost in Space here, and filmed for Danny Boyle recently. \"There are a lot of great English terms for doing it - boff, or shag, or screw. But Americans understand that it is something dirty and sexual. What more do you need to know?\" That didn't stop the papers having a field day with the dictionary definition of a rough-haired carpet. It rates as a joke along with British dentistry, a running gag in the first Austin Powers film. \"It's caught on with children in America - it's such a funny-sounding word.\" Anything, she says, to shake US sexual prudery.\n\nThe inspirations for Felicity Shagwell were Ursula Andress in Dr No, Jane Fonda's Barbarella and Mae West - coming back at the men with their own sexual aggression. Talking about the film, she varies between good Mae West lines (the message of the film is love conquers all but sex is better) and admitting she took it seriously as a love story. That inherent innocence shows to her advantage on screen, just as it did on Boogie Nights where director Paul Thomas Anderson told her he wanted Rollergirl to have a Tinkerbell quality.\n\n\"Austin Powers goes from being a swinger to wanting monogamy. You can change,\" she says with the earnestness of a woman who herself recently went from a succession of older men to the actor, writer and director Ed Burns. \"He's making a movie with Robert De Niro. Isn't that cool? I've never been this much in love.\"\n\nShe and Burns met in a bar last August, liberated themselves from current partners (in her case, Stephen Hopkins, British director of Lost in Space), and went on a date that lasted four days. Burns comes to her sets. \"He prayed for me when I had to sleep with Fat Bastard.\" They were both born on the same day (he's 31, she's 29); they both have an Irish Catholic upbringing with matching hang-ups. \"Troubled people have always been interesting to me,\" she admits. They both have fathers in law enforcement: Burns (who is writing a police film which may star Graham) was a policeman's child; Graham's father was an FBI agent, though presumably one with no similarities to Austin Powers.\n\n\"My dad's job seemed like every other dad who went to work, eight in the morning to six at night. Even though he did have a gun and a bulletproof vest, it didn't seem very exciting. He dealt with white-collar criminals so it wasn't like in the movies.\" She was born in Wisconsin but her father's job meant the family moved repeatedly. Her parents are devout Catholics. They wouldn't even let her watch The Love Boat because it promoted pre-marital sex. \"Every sexual thought meant I was horrible and going to hell. I was trying to pretend I was this sweet, innocent thing. I was miserable. I don't really consider myself to be religious or Catholic now - I think of that as just part of my upbringing.\"\n\nHer parents let her act at school - an escape from reality, she says frankly. When she was six they let her appear in The Swiss Family Robinson on television. But they said no to Heathers, the cult black comedy which starred Winona Ryder. When she was 18, she took a role as the naive, doomed junkie in Drugstore Cowboy and left home, almost simultaneously.\n\nGraham hasn't seen her parents in years. \"We don't speak. We had so many bust-ups when I was a teenager over just about everything. I was an unhappy teenager, and in my early 20s I had no self-esteem. Basically my inner parent was telling my inner child 'you suck' all the time. But I did my therapy\" - and transcendental meditation, yoga and detox diets - \"and now I know who I am.\"\n\nHer early career was patchy. Drugstore Cowboy didn't lead to great parts. \"I was so young and I didn't know how to handle it. I was just so excited anyone would hire me that I let my agents talk me into taking the wrong jobs.\" After a small part in Twin Peaks, she had a string of underperforming films such as Shout, with the pre-comeback Travolta, Six Degrees of Separation and Even Cowgirls Got the Blues.\n\nShe was spotted afresh playing a sparky seductress in the 1996 indie movie Swingers. A faintly sexual theme - joyful, she points out, rather than exploitative - has run through most of her work since then. A near-nude cover shoot, dipped in gold and with roller skates, for Details; a \"butt licking\" scene with Robert Downey Jr that the censors had cut from Two Girls and a Guy. She speaks of it pragmatically - \"sex sells\" - but it's hard not to think also in terms of rebellion. Or catharsis, possibly.\n\nAs well as Danny Boyle's segment of the three-director vehicle Alien Love Triangle, she will soon be appearing in Committed, as a woman who stalks her wandering husband \"for his own good\". In Bowfinger with Eddie Murphy and Steve Martin, she plays a girl who \"comes from a small town, who wants to be an actress and is prepared to go to any lengths to climb the ladder\".\n\nThough Graham's price tag has recently doubled to $2m a picture, that's not spectacular in Hollywood terms. But she has something better than spectacular: a slow but steady rise. She's got respect in the industry. Getting down and dirty onscreen has paid off for her, just as it always used to. Earlier this year, Heather Graham was given the Star of Tomorrow award by the cinema owners at the ShoWest conference. She used to be Snow White - to misquote Mae West - but she is drifting beautifully."
