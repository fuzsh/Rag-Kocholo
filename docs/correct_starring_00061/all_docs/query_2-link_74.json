        "text": "Actor Verne Troyer, best-known for his role as Mini-Me in two Austin Powers movies, has died at age 49.\n\nHe had struggled with alcoholism and reportedly had suffered from depression.\n\nHis death was confirmed Saturday afternoon on his Facebook page.\n\n\"Depression and suicide are very serious issues, the post read. \"You never know what kind of battle someone is going through inside. Be kind to one another. And always know, it's never too late to reach out to someone for help.\"\n\nAuthorities have not released the cause and circumstances of his death. Where he died was also not released; he had lived in Los Angeles.\n\nTroyer was born in 1969 in Sturgis, Mich., with achondroplasia, a genetic condition that kept him less than 3 feet tall.\n\nTroyer was once based in Arlington, where he lived for more than 10 years as an actor-stunt man. He got his start in Hollywood as a double for a 9-month-old infant in the 1994 film Baby's Day Out. He later appeared in Men in Black, Jingle All the Way and dozens of other films.\n\nTroyer became a celebrity and pop-culture phenomenon after he starred alongside Mike Myers as Mini-Me, the clone and sidekick of villain Dr. Evil, in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Austin Powers in Goldmember.\n\n\"Verne was the consummate professional and a beacon of positivity for those of us who had the honor of working with him,\" Myers said in a written statement. \"It is a sad day, but I hope he is in a better place. He will be greatly missed.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Troyer was hospitalized after a friend called police to tell them the actor was suicidal.\n\nPolice sources said they rushed to the Mini Me actor's home about 7:30 p.m. Monday night. Police described the actor as upset, drunk and suicidal. Troyer was taken to the hospital under suspicion of alcohol poisoning.\n\nIn 2017, the actor reportedly spent time at a San Fernando Valley hospital, being treated there for alcoholism. Reports are that in 2002, Troyer nearly died from alcohol poisoning."
