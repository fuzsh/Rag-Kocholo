        "text": "Mike Myers has said that he would ‘love to do’ a fourth Austin Powers movie – 20 years after the spy last hit the big screen.\n\nThe actor, who starred as the title character as well as his arch-nemesis Dr. Evil in three installments of the James Bond parody, has confirmed he wants to reprise the roles again.\n\nThe 58-year-old, who also wrote and produced the trilogy, said: ‘I can neither confirm nor deny the existence or non-existence of such a project, should it exist or not exist.’\n\nWhen he was asked if this tease was in fact a confirmation, he told SiriusXM’s Jess Cagle: ‘It was a non-confirmed, confirmation confirmation.’\n\nThe last film in the Powers franchise was 2002’s Austin Powers in Goldmember.\n\nThe previous offerings were Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery in 1997 and Austin Powers: The Spy Who S****ed Me in 1999.\n\nThe actor/producer had also spoken about the possibility of a fourth film in November 2018 when he admitted it was ‘looking good’.\n\n‘Well, you’re gonna see Dr. Evil soon, somewhere in the culture,’ he told Access Online at the time. ‘But the movie, you know I’ve had three kids under the age of seven.\n\n‘They take a long time to write, they always have. [Director] Jay [Roach]’s been super crazy. He’s doing a fantastic movie right now that he’s working on. But … it’s looking good.’\n\nThe star also previously revealed that the film series was created as a ‘tribute’ to his late father.\n\nHe added: ‘After my dad died in 1991, I was taking stock of his influence on me as a person and his influence on me with comedy in general.\n\n‘So Austin Powers was a tribute to my father, who [introduced me to] James Bond, Peter Sellers, The Beatles, The Goodies, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.\n\n‘I would love to do another, but you just have to see.\n\n‘I was devastated by my father’s death, but you have to turn that into something that makes people happy is unbelievably satisfying.\n\n‘It’s that kind of stuff you never get used to or get tired of.’\n\nHe did return as Dr Evil in a General Motors Super Bowl advert in February, reuniting with franchise stars Seth Green, Rob Lowe and Mindy Sterling.\n\nThe star, who also made a rare public appearance in Hollywood on Wednesday night for the Netflix Is a Joke Festival, where comedian Dave Chappelle was physically attacked onstage, saw his new six-episode series titled The Pentaverate debut on Netflix the same night.\n\nThe comedy sees him playing a string of new characters in a story involving a secret society made up of five men who influence world events.\n\nFans may remember that he previously referenced The Pentaverate in the 1993 dark comedy So I Married An Axe Murderer, in which he played both the lead character and his cantankerous father.\n\nIn that film, Mike claimed the secret society’s members included the Queen, the Vatican, the Getty family – and KFC fried chicken expert Colonel Sanders.\n\n‘I love creating characters, and Netflix has given me a fantastic playground to play in,’ Mike said, according to Variety.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : BGT star Jonathan Goodwin told Amanda Abbington she could walk away after life-changing accident: ‘I did say, you have a get out of jail free card’"
