        "text": "Felicity Shagwell is the secondary protagonist of the 1999 film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. She was played by Heather Graham.\n\nWhy She Rocks\n\nFelicity is considered one of Heather Graham’s most notable roles alongside Rollergirl and Jade. It went to the point where Graham got typecast to play beautiful sex symbols in a lot of films.\n\nShe is considered the most iconic Powers girl for her appeal and comedic timing.\n\nHeather Graham did an excellent job portraying her.\n\nHer leitmotif is “American Woman”, which fits perfectly because she's an American woman from the late 1960s.\n\nShe had great chemistry with Austin and felt like a couple.\n\nBad Qualities\n\nIt isn't explained why and how she and Austin broke up.\n\nHer last name is rather explicit for British audiences.\n\nTrivia\n\nThere is an unconfirmed deleted scene where Felicity dumps Austin in Goldmember.\n\nHeather Graham appears in the music video of Lenny Kravitz’ cover of “American Woman” as a tie in for the film."
