        "text": "Steve Kerr provided a strong message, just not from his usual spot on the bench: Play with urgency.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors did just that for their ailing coach watching from the locker room, and left Gregg Popovich questioning and criticizing his Spurs players for a lack of belief and feeling sorry for themselves without injured superstar Kawhi Leonard.\n\nStephen Curry had 29 points, seven rebounds and seven assists in three quarters and the Warriors trounced on the short-handed Spurs, running away from San Antonio for a 136-100 rout Tuesday night and 2-0 lead in the Western Conference finals.\n\nKevin Durant added 16 points and Draymond Green provided another impressive all-around performance with 13 points, nine rebounds, six assists, two steals and two blocks. Rookie Patrick McCaw had 18 points and five assists off the bench shooting 6 for 8 as Golden State earned its most lopsided victory of the playoffs to go to 10-0.\n\nJonathon Simmons scored 17 of his 22 points in the first half as the lone bright spot for the Spurs.\n\n“It looked pretty collective to me. I don’t think it was one guy who didn’t believe and he infected everybody else or anything like that. As a group they just let themselves down,” Popovich said. “The truth always quote-un-quote sets you free. You can’t sugarcoat it or say ‘if we had just made a couple shots we’d have been right there.’ That’s pretty lame. So, call it like it is. We didn’t come to play. We felt sorry for ourselves. We need to get slapped and come back and play Game 3 and see who we are.”\n\nLeonard re-injured his left ankle in Sunday’s 113-111 Game 1 loss after coming down on Zaza Pachulia’s foot. Popovich on Monday called out the Warriors starting center for the “dangerous” and “unsportsmanlike” closeout – which had Pachulia insisting he is not a dirty player, was only playing hard, and felt badly that the All-Star forward was injured.\n\nGame 3 in the best-of-seven series is Saturday in San Antonio.\n\nPachulia left the game injured for a Warriors team already without key reserve forward Andre Iguodala, held out because of soreness in his left knee that limited him to 10 minutes in Game 1.\n\nAn X-ray on Pachulia’s bruised right heel was clear but he was scheduled for an MRI on Wednesday. The big man played nearly seven minutes but sat the entire second quarter before Matt Barnes took his place.\n\nGolden State quickly established its pass-happy, up-tempo style to take the Spurs out from the opening tip. It was a drastic difference from a game of catch-up two days earlier when the Warriors rallied from 25 down and a 20-point halftime deficit.\n\nThe bench contributed a season-best 63 points.\n\n“They came out with a sense of urgency from the beginning and they played that way for 48 minutes,” acting Warriors coach Mike Brown said.\n\nKlay Thompson, still struggling to find his steady shooting touch, had 11 points, six rebounds and four assists. The Warriors had 39 assists – the most by any team this postseason – including 30 on their initial 38 baskets.\n\nShaun Livingston scored in double figures for the first time this postseason with 10 points for Golden State.\n\nSimmons started in Leonard’s place and made 6 of 9 shots to begin the game while the rest of the Spurs were 3 for 22.\n\nThe Warriors began 10 for 16 as Curry hit three quick 3s and Green added two more for a 25-12 lead late in the first and 33-16 advantage after one quarter."
