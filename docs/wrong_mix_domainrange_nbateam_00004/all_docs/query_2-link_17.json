        "text": "So far in the NBA playoffs, things look glittering for the Golden State Warriors and Shaun Livingston, the pride of Peoria High School.\n\nBut once this postseason run is over, might Livingston trade one coast for the other?\n\nThe 14-season veteran, who has been a key part of the Warriors' NBA Finals runs the past few years, will be a free agent once this season is over. He won't be the only Golden State player seeking a new deal. Others include superstars Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant and Springfield native Andre Iguodala.\n\nThat a lot of big bucks for the Warriors to negotiate in an effort to stay below the NBA salary cap. It might be easy to forego paying a soon-to-be 32-year-old role player, even if Livingston usually plays that role to perfection.\n\nBut if the Warriors and Livingston part ways after three seasons, it appears a team back East could use him.\n\nAt least one media source suggests the New York Knicks should pursue Livingston. The Knicks need a point guard (and a lot of other things). Livingston's play on defense also is an asset.\n\nLivingston has played in New York before, but not for the Knicks. He played for the Brooklyn Nets in the 2013-14 season, after which he headed to the Bay Area.\n\nThe case this report makes for a Livingston-Knicks union is a bit flawed. The author cites reduced statistics for Livingston, but that doesn't tell the whole story about his worth to the Warriors.\n\nIn a recent piece, columnist Tim Kawakami of the San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News cited Livingston as a calming presence in a locker room filled with diverse personalities. Kawakami also cited Livingston's resurgence from a mid-season lull, one that might have made it easier for the Warriors to pursue other, off-season options.\n\n“I’d love to come back,\" Livingston told Kawakami. \"But I do understand — it’s the business part of it. If that would happen, it wouldn’t be the first time for me. I’m not going to sit there or focus on that while we’re trying to chase something greater.”"
