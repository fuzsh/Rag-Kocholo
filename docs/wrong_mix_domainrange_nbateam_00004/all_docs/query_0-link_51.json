        "text": "SAN ANTONIO - Golden State made sure the inevitable was unavoidable.\n\nHeavily favored to beat the Spurs, especially once Kawhi Leonard sustained a series-ending injury, the Warriors completed a dominant sweep in the Western Conference final.\n\nStephen Curry scored 36 points and Golden State beat injury-ravaged San Antonio with a 129-115 victory Monday night, becoming the first team in league history to start the playoffs 12-0.\n\n“(Being) 12-0 is great, but it doesn’t mean anything going into the next series, and we understand that,” Curry said.\n\nGolden State led by as many as 22 points in cruising to its third consecutive NBA Finals. The Warriors await a possible third consecutive championship matchup with Cleveland, which leads Boston 2-1 in the East final.\n\n“It’s great to be one of the last two teams standing, we’ll see how it goes,” said Kevin Durant, who had 29 points and 12 rebounds.\n\nSan Antonio’s only lead came on the opening possession when 39-year-old Manu Ginobili tossed in a left-handed scoop shot. The Spurs started Ginobili in what could be his final game with the team. He had maintained he will not ponder whether to retire or return until after the season.\n\n“We started him tonight out of respect,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. “That was the whole reason for starting him. Before the game, you think it may or may not be his last game that he ever plays in, and I did not want to miss the opportunity to honor him in front of our home fans for his selflessness over the years.”\n\nUnsure if the beloved veteran will return, the crowd serenaded Ginobili with “Manu! Manu!” chants as the game came to a close.\n\n“He kind of worked us pretty good these four games,” said Draymond Green, who had 16 points, eight rebounds and eight assists for the Warriors. “So, I think he’s got quite a bit left in the tank. Obviously, it’s up to him how much longer he wants to go. But one thing about it, he’s definitely not a liability on the floor.”\n\nGinobili finished with 15 points in 32 minutes.\n\nKyle Anderson scored 20 points to lead the Spurs, who were without Leonard, Tony Parker and David Lee.\n\n“Obviously it (stinks) that Kawhi wasn’t there and Tony wasn’t there and David wasn’t out there,” Green said. “But, at the end of the day, a win is a win and you have to beat whoever is out there against you.”\n\nSan Antonio didn’t go down without a fight despite the injuries.\n\nAnderson dove on the court for a loose ball that the Spurs had tipped away defensively, pushing the ball upcourt to Patty Mills who fed Ginobili for a 3-pointer that pulled San Antonio to 108-94 with 7 minutes remaining.\n\nThe effort made Popovich smile and clap at times, but the Warriors’ depth and talent proved too much for short-handed San Antonio.\n\nNOTES\n\nGolden State has won five consecutive games against San Antonio, including the regular season, which is the team’s longest against the Spurs.\n\nWarriors starting center Zaza Pachulia missed his second consecutive game with a bruised right heel. Pachulia’s absence allowed him to escape the ire of the Spurs fans, who blame him for Leonard’s absence after his controversial close-out on a 3-pointer that Popovich called “dangerous” and “unsportsmanlike.”"
