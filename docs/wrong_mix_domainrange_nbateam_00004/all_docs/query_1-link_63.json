        "text": "Twitter:\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs are down 0-3 in their playoff series to the defending NBA champs Golden State Warriors and are facing an elimination game as Game 4 will tip-off tomorrow at the AT&T Center.\n\nWill game 4 be the end of the Spurs season? Can the team rally and extend the series another game?\n\nThe Spurs Zone crew discussed Game 4 and gave their predictions in this Spurs Zone Roundtable.\n\nTyler Clerkin, Spurs Zone:\n\nI think Game 4 is where the Spurs’ season ends. Based on what we’ve seen in the first three games, there is no chance the Spurs pick up the win.\n\nThe Spurs should try their best to win, but when it’s all said and done they’re just simply not as skilled as the Warriors.\n\nI think this won’t be a blowout, but the Warriors will win by at least eight to ten points.\n\nMarquez Anderson, Spurs Zone:\n\nThe Warriors have just been too much to handle, so I expect the Spurs to come up short again. Golden State has more talent across the board, but I think the Spurs will still try to pick up a win to avoid a sweep.\n\nHowever, I think it will be unlikely to do so given what we have seen throughout the series.\n\nDerek Machen, Spurs Zone:\n\nThis seems like the end of the road for the Spurs’ season.\n\nWith Pop out for Game 4, this just seems like a recipe for disaster. It’s tough to combat the likes of Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green without firepower of their own.\n\nIt was a hell of a season considering the circumstances, but San Antonio must focus this offseason on what to do with Kawhi Leonard and ultimately the direction of the franchise.\n\nJeff Garcia, Spurs Zone Manager:\n\nMercifully, the Spurs' season will end simply because the Warriors are just a superior team on both ends of the court.\n\nGolden State is averaging more than 100-points per game and defensively, have held the Spurs to under 100-points in two of the three games played.\n\nToss in the fact Kevin Durant tweaked his ankle in Game 3 as did Shaun Livingston, Golden State will want to end the series to get in rest for the second-round and not run the risk of any other injuries.\n\nThe Spurs will put up the good fight but ultimately will be swept.\n\nAgree Spurs fans?
