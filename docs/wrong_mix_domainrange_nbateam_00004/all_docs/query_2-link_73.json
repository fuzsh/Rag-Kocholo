        "text": "Ben Margot/Associated Press\n\nKevin Durant and Steph Curry are not the Golden State Warriors' only free agents this summer. The defending champs have just five players under contract going into July (not including second-round pick Jordan Bell).\n\nDurant and Curry are the obvious long-term priorities. But everyone knows they're not going anywhere. Curry will finally get his rightful max contract, and there's no way Durant will one-and-done the Warriors after winning the title. There's no suspense here; Curry and Durant may even wait to sign their max deals until later next month to keep their cap holds lower.\n\nThe real question marks here are the role players on the roster. Zaza Pachulia took a massive pay cut to come to Golden State last season and might look to cash in. Ian Clark emerged as a solid role player. Matt Barnes and David West are, well, they're still veterans who can generally play basketball.\n\nAny of them could potentially leave.\n\nBut the most concerning potential departures are Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston, who have become integral pieces of the Warriors' bench. Iguodala has regularly been part of the best Warriors lineups since his arrival, including their so-called Death Lineup. Livingston is a mid-range killer who consistently plays heady basketball.\n\nBoth are 30-plus veterans who are probably staring at their last potential payday.\n\nChris Haynes of ESPN.com reported the Minnesota Timberwolves,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Clippers,Philadelphia 76ers,Orlando Magic,Brooklyn Nets andUtah Jazz all have interest in signing Iguodala. The Clippers' interest may have tapered after the departure of Chris Paul, but that's a lot of teams—some of which have Monopoly money to burn.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Warriors general manager Bob Myers said, per Anthony Slater of the Mercury News. \"Free agency is predictably unpredictable. We love Andre. Hopefully we can find a way to make it work for not just him but all of our guys. But as far as specifics, there's not a lot—and the rules make sense—there's not a lot we can say definitively one way or the other.\"\n\nIguodala could understandably be tempted by other offers. The Warriors aren't going to be able to offer him nearly as much money as other suitors. The Sixers in particular could back up a Brinks truck of cash without hurting their long-term books and bring him back to where his career began as a do-everything veteran piece for their young core.\n\nShams Charania of The Vertical also reported the Warriors are planning to push hard to retain Livingston, who will likely have fewer suitors than Iguodala but still a robust market. He shot 57.6 percent from the floor during the playoffs and doesn't turn 32 until September."
