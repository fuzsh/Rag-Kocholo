        "text": "Twitter:\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs 2016-17 season has come to an end as the team was swept by the Warriors in the West Finals.\n\nDepleted, beaten, injured, the Spurs just didn't have enough weapons to give the Warriors a fight in Game 4.\n\nNow the team moves into the offseason with questions abound: Will Manu Ginobili retire? What is the fate of players who are free agents?\n\nAfter Game 4, the Spurs and Warriors spoke about the game.\n\nHere is a sampling of what was said after Game 4 of the West Finals:\n\nSpurs Guard Danny Green:\n\n(On if tonight was a fair fight)\n\n“It is tough to beat that team, they’re a great team. It is tough to beat that team with everybody healthy. Usually teams that win it are the healthiest team and then the team that’s creating the most. And for us, it just wasn’t there for us. I give them credit regardless. They didn’t take us lightly at all, they came out regardless of who we had on the floor. We didn’t have enough to keep up with the injuries.”\n\n(On Manu Ginobili starting tonight)\n\n“It was great. It’s just to show you how much they love him here, how much respect he has from the city; he’s earned that. He’s been great. He’s done some great things here and only half of us can dream to accomplish some of those things. We’ll see what decision he makes soon. I’m sure some guys will try to talk him into one more year. I don’t know what’s going to happen but ultimately it’s his decision. Regardless, he’s had a great career and it was a good last stage for him.”\n\n(On how invaluable the playing time was for the younger players)\n\n“It was great for them. They learned so much on the fly tonight. Bryn [Forbes], Dejounte [Murray], getting thrown in the fire and even [Jonathon] Simmons for the last series and this series trying to make plays and learning defensive coverages and switches. They had to learn a lot fast. They’re growing up fast. I think it’s going to be great for them in the future. As future Spurs, if they continue to stay here, I think it’ll be helpful for them. They’ll be ahead of the game next year coming in.”\n\nSpurs Guard Patty Mills:\n\n(On his overall feelings about the series)\n\n“It was an opportunity for everyone to step up and experience, or get a taste of what playoff basketball is like. I thought [Jonathon] Simmons, Dejounte [Murray], and everyone had an opportunity and came in and gave it their all. That’s what you look at. Big picture, it was a learning curve for all of them. Dejounte [Murray] has a lot of potential in time, Simmons as well. Great learning curve to learn against a hell of a team. They showed us what a championship team looks like. When you look at it like that, I’m glad we got to go through it.”\n\n(On how he will weigh his offseason options)\n\n“I will decide where to eat tonight. Whoever has the best wine, we will start there.”\n\n(On what he was thinking as Manu Ginobili left the floor)\n\n“I don’t know why we have such a good relationship, he is so much older than me, you know? It’s weird it’s like grandpa and grandson, but still very close. He sat down next to me, and I asked him, ‘What is everyone standing up for?’ We’ll see what he does, but it has been a great learning curve for me. To grow under him and grow on the court, and more importantly for me, off the court. It is a relationship that will go on for years beyond basketball. That is the thing you take away the most. I feel like I haven’t taken anything for granted, getting to play with him. I’ve appreciated every day.”\n\nSpurs Forward Pau Gasol:\n\n(On his overall feelings about the series)\n\n“It was a tough break for us. In the first game, we were rolling for a while, most of the game, and then our best player goes down and those guys get rolling, and they steal one from us that could have made a difference in the series. I feel probably without Kawhi [Leonard], Tony [Parker], and now David [Lee], we still could have had a hard time even if we won Game 1. I think we came out and competed, played hard, until the very last minute of the series. Golden State is very dangerous. They are full of talent. They make you pay and are hard to match up against. They make you play at a very high level. We were in a tough position from the beginning and it got tougher as we lost a couple of players.\n\n(On what Manu means to the game of basketball)\n\n“I think everyone that plays this game, that follows this game, that understands this game, respects a player like Manu [Ginobili] on every level. Manu has been a fantastic, magnificent player all his career. He’s made a huge contribution on many levels in this league and internationally. I think everyone respects what he brings to the table and how he competes. He is always classy and at the top level in every regard. It was nice to see that the fans recognize what Manu means to this city and this franchise. We’ll see what happens. I think he could continue to play from a physical standpoint because he continues to play at a high level. He had 32 minutes and 15 points in a Conference Final game. That looks good to me.”\n\n(On what his first season as a Spur has been like)\n\n“It has been a little bit of a challenge. I knew it was going to take some time to adjust to a new situation. I had to find out what my role was going to be. I try to follow the lead in the direction of the coaching staff and try to fit in at first. You try to fit in; try not to be disruptive. It was a little bit of an adjustment, changing roles. Overall, I think it was pretty positive. I had a pretty efficient season. I gave it my all from beginning to end. I look forward to continuing to grow now that the season has gone through, and I know the conditions I’m playing with and the circumstances.”\n\nSpurs Guard Dejounte Murray:\n\n(On what he learned the most from the postseason)\n\n“I think I got better. I learned. I really think I got better though, that was the important thing. I came off of injury missing 18 games and I got to play the last game in Utah. Then I was releasing in time, I started that series and then TP (Tony Parker) got hurt. I just got better. I feel I got a lot better and now it’s time to take it even more serious this offseason and take a huge step.”\n\n(On what area he wants to improve on the most)\n\n“Everything. Everything.”\n\n(On if he’s ready to be a starter)\n\n“Of course. I’m going to work, I’m going to put in the work and then I’m going to go from there.”\n\nWarriors Guard Shaun Livingston:\n\n(On what the Spurs showed in this series)\n\n“They’re a great team. Coach Popovich is one of the greatest coaches ever. He gets his guys ready to play. They showed a lot of heart. They did not quit. We didn’t take their will. They played every minute. They got every ounce of talent out of those guys that they could get. Shout out to them. They did a great job battling in this series. Even though we won four games, it still was a tough four games.”\n\n(On this potentially being the last game of Manu Ginobili’s career)\n\n“Manu Ginobli – ultimate warrior. I made an effort to go over and just congratulate him on his career, whether he comes back or not. I told him it’s an honor to be able to battle against guys like that. He’s proven one of the best guys ever to play for this organization. What he’s accomplished - what he means to this organization and to this city - it’s the same to me as Tim Duncan and David Robinson, guys like that. He’s going to go down as one of the greats. He’s just the ultimate competitor. He really pioneered his game. A lot of people kind of copied their game after his. He was the first one doing euro steps, runners, and head fakes. He’s a handful, so it was an honor to compete against him throughout his career.”\n\nWarriors Guard Patrick McCaw:\n\n(On how he thinks David West feels about reaching the NBA Finals)\n\n“I don’t know how he’s feeling right now. He’s been in the NBA for a long time. I think this is his first time, so I think we’re sharing the same room. From a veteran to a rookie, we share the same emotions. He just probably won’t show his.”\n\n(On the effort of the San Antonio Spurs)\n\n“Definitely give credit to San Antonio and Coach Popovich and how they battled all series. It was tough losing guys to injuries and things like that, but they continued to fight all series.”\n\n(On if he realized that he was guarding Manu Ginobili in possibly his last game)\n\n“I didn’t realize it was his last game. He’s one of those guys you watched growing up. It’s kind of tough. I’m excited I got to share the floor with him. He’s definitely a legend and he’s had a great career.”"
