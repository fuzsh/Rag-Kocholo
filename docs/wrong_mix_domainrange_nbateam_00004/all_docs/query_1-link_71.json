        "text": "The 2016-17 Golden State Warriors are one of the greatest NBA teams ever assembled.\n\nThe season before they went 73-9 but LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers staged a miraculous comeback from 1-3 down in the Finals.\n\nSeeking revenge, the Golden State machine wasted no time in adding Kevin Durant - one of the most formidable scorers of the modern era - to their ranks.\n\nSteve Kerr's All-Star 'Fantastic Four' tore through the league in 2016-17 and broke NBA 20 records while cruising to a title.\n\nThe Dubs finished the regular season with a 67-15 record and went 16-1 in the postseason (the best playoff record in NBA history) before demolishing LeBron's Cavs 4-1 in the Finals.\n\nThe current Warriors, who are in 9th place in the Western Conference, are virtually unrecognisable from that all-time great roster, save for a few stars who still remain.\n\nHere's what that juggernaut of a team are up to now.\n\nSteph Curry\n\nChef Curry remains as important to the Warriors franchise as ever.\n\nAt 35, the sharpshooter is still the linchpin of the Warriors' offense and led the team to their fourth title of the Steve Kerr era in 2022.\n\nGolden State beat the Boston Celtics in six games in that year's finals and Curry was named Finals MVP for the first time in his career.\n\nThe all-time leader in three-pointers was named to his tenth All-Star Game and his first as a reserve last month.\n\nKlay Thompson\n\nThompson, Golden State's other 'Splash Brother', helped the Warriors win back-to-back titles in 2017 and 2018.\n\nSadly, the five-time All-Star suffered an ACL tear in the 2019 Finals against the Toronto Raptors and missed over two and a half years of play.\n\nHe returned to action in 2022 to help the Dubs win their fifth championship overall but injuries have started to take their toll.\n\nThompson has been moved to the bench of late but recently made NBA history by becoming just the seventh player to make 2,400 career three-pointers.\n\nDraymond Green\n\nGreen is the undoubted leader of the Warriors dynasty and one of the most vocal players in the NBA.\n\nHe was the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year in 2017 and was part of the core who also won titles in 2016, 2018 and 2022.\n\nHowever, his on-court conduct and behaviour have got him in trouble in recent times, culminating in a 12-game suspension earlier this season for striking Phoenix Suns center Jusuf NurkiÄ‡ in the face.\n\nKevin Durant\n\nDurant joined the Warriors in the summer of 2016 and tipped the balance of power overwhelmingly in Golden State's favour to make them virtually unstoppable for several years.\n\nKD won back-to-back titles - and Finals MVPs - in 2017 and 2018, but joined the Brooklyn Nets in 2019 following an Achilles injury and a failed attempt at a three-peat that same year.\n\nHe formed a Big Three in Brooklyn with James Harden and Kyrie Irving but injuries and off-field issues plagued the team from the get-go.\n\nAfter numerous playoffs disappointments, Durant joined the Phoenix Suns in February 2023 where he continues to play to this day.\n\nAndre Iguodala\n\nThe 2015 Finals MVP has four championships with the Warriors, winning in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2022.\n\nHe also had a two-year stint with the Miami Heat in the middle of that and reached his sixth straight Finals in 2020 - where he lost to LeBron's Lakers.\n\nIggy returned to the Warriors in 2021 and won the chip later that year.\n\nHe retired from basketball in 2023 and in November of last year was named the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) Acting Executive Director.\n\nDavid West\n\nWest signed for the Warriors in 2016 and became a key bench player during their championship runs over the next two seasons.\n\nThe versatile big played in every playoff game in the 2016-17 season and, after winning his second ring, announced his retirement in 2018 after 15 seasons.\n\nIn 2021, he was reportedly in the second semester of pursuing a Master's degree in African American history at North Carolina Central University.\n\nIt was a three-year programme and he reportedly planned to pursue a doctorate afterwards.\n\nHeâ€™s also written two books.\n\nShaun Livingston\n\nThe former No.4 overall pick in the 2004 NBA Draft spent the final five years of his 14-year playing career with the Dubs, where he reached five straight NBA Finals and was a three-time champion.\n\nThe lethal mid-range shooter averaged 5.4 points, 2.4 assists, and 2.0 rebounds per game as a valuable backup point guard to Curry.\n\nA year after retiring in 2019, Livingston joined the Warriorsâ€™ front office as director of players affairs and engagement.\n\nIn June 2023, three years after his appointment, he stepped down from the role in order to spend more time with his family.\n\nMatt Barnes\n\nNBA journeyman Barnes won a championship with the Warriors in his last season in the league in 2017.\n\nThese days, the 43-year-old is a basketball analyst for ESPN as well as NBC Sports California for Sacramento Kings games.\n\nHe also co-hosts popular podcast 'All The Smoke' with former San Antonio Spurs man and 2003 champion Stephen Jackson.\n\nKevon Looney\n\nLooney was drafted by the Warriors with the 30th overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft and is still with the team.\n\nA strained left hip sidelined him for most of the 2016-17 playoffs but he became a regular in Kerr's rotation the next campaign as the team claimed their second straight title.\n\nHe was also one of their best players in 2022 and a key part of the team that beat the Celtics in that year's Finals.\n\nZaza Pachulia\n\nThe 6ft 11in Georgian won consecutive world titles with the Warriors in 2017 and 2018, becoming the first player from his country to win an NBA championship.\n\nHis first title run was the most controversial as he was painted as a villain by fans and media alike.\n\nHis reputation as a 'dirty' player came during Game 1 of the 2017 Western Conference Finals when he injured Spurs star Kawhi Leonard on a closeout foot slide.\n\nZaza retired in 2019 but re-joined Warriors as a front office consultant in their basketball operations department, winning a third title with the team in 2022.\n\nJaVale McGee\n\nAt one point, McGee turned into a walking meme after becoming a mainstay on Shaquille O'Neal's weekly Insider the NBA bloopers segment, 'Shaqtin' a Fool'.\n\nHis career is no joke though, having won two titles with the Dubs in 2017 and 2018 and another with the Lakers in 2020.\n\nSince then, the 36-year-old has played for the Cavs, Nuggets, Suns, Mavs, and Kings, where he currently plays.\n\nIan Clark\n\nClark, a shooting guard, was part of the Warriorsâ€™ championship winning team in 2017, playing a significant role off the bench averaging 6.8 points a game while 37.4 per cent from beyond the arc.\n\nAfter two more seasons in the NBA with the New Orleans Pelicans, he moved to Australia to join the Sydney Kings of the National Basketball League (NBL).\n\nThe 31-year-old established himself as one of the leagueâ€™s best three-point shooters and played a key role in their NBL championship triumph in 2022.\n\nClark joined the Adelaide 36ers at the end of 2022 before making the move to Melbourne United a year later for the 2023â€“24 NBL season.\n\nDamian Jones\n\nJones was selected by the Warriors with the 30th overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft.\n\nThe centre appeared in 10 regular-season games and four playoff games during the 2016â€“17 season as he won his first NBA title.\n\nThe following season he appeared in 15 regular-season games and four playoff games as the Warriors defending their championship.\n\nJones became a starter for 22 games in 2018-19 but a torn left pectoral muscle kept him out thereafter.\n\nHe has played for the Hawks, Suns, Lakers, Kings, Jazz and Cavs.\n\nHe is still part of Cleveland's roster.\n\nJames Michael McAdoo\n\nJames Michael McAdoo's father is the second cousin of Hall of Fame NBA player Bob McAdoo.\n\nThe power forward won two chips with the Warriors (2015, 2017), appearing in 108 games with the team over three seasons plus 26 playoff games.\n\nHowever, he spent most of the 2017â€“18 season with the Philadelphia 76ers' NBA G League affiliate, the Delaware 87ers.\n\nMcAdoo played in France and Turkey before joining the Sun Rockers Shibuya of Japan's B.League.\n\nIn 2021, he signed a three-year, multi-million deal with the Sun Rockers, the largest deal in the history of Japanese basketball for an American player, where he continues to play today.\n\nPatrick McCaw\n\nThe St. Louis, Missouri native was drafted 38th overall by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2018 NBA draft but was immediately traded to the Warriors.\n\nHe won a ring in his rookie season and played a significant part during the postseason.\n\nIn Game 2 of the Western Conference Finals against the Spurs, McCaw had 18 points, five assists, three rebounds, and three steals off the bench in a 136-100 win.\n\nIn doing so, he became the first rookie in the NBA with at least 18 points off the bench in a playoff game since James Harden in 2010.\n\nHe won a second title the year after and in 2019 joined the Raptors where he won another championship.\n\nMcCaw won three championships in his first three seasons in the league, and became the first player to do so with two different teams.\n\nThe guard/forward also became the first player since the likes of Shaq and Kobe Bryant in 2000-2002 with the Lakers to win three straight titles.\n\nIn 2022 he ended up in the G League with the Delaware Blue Coats."
