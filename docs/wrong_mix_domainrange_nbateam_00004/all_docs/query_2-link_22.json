        "text": "Shaun Livingston, the pride of Peoria High School, had been in a bit of a shooting slump recently for the Golden State Warriors.\n\nBut the NBA veteran now is hitting just about everything he throws toward the backboard. Even if he doesn't necessarily mean to put it through the hoop.\n\nLivingston has made many of his big-league bones on an ability to hit mid-range shots. As of earlier this week, he had made just 12 3-point baskets in his career. And he had not made one since January 2016, according to this report.\n\nThat 3-point drought ended accidentally Wednesday night in the Warriors' 120-111 victory at Phoenix.\n\nThe Warriors' Steph Curry was in a scrum on the floor with some Suns players just before the end of the first quarter. Curry came up with the ball and fed it to Livingston. He lobbed a pass to JaVale McGee, who was alone under the basket.\n\nWell, the ball never made it to McGee, as you can see in the clip below. But the result worked out just fine for Golden State.\n\n\"I asked Shaun to shoot more 3's,\" Livingston's Peoria-based father, Reggie, posted to his Facebook page. \"And he gives me this for his first 3-point shot!! Have to love it.\""
