They’re interesting inventions but I can’t see them remaining fashionable very long. —Louis Lumière Sound cinema, as it is currently practised, neglects 15 years of progress towards cinematic independence. . . . It is re-living, with juvenile inanity, all those errors that the silent cinema overcame. —Jean Epstein, Cinéa-Ciné, November 1930 Let’s not pretend like certain moralists that the cinema depraves us. It doesn’t deprave us any more than life itself, founded as it is on profit, greed, the oppression of the weak, selfishness and injustice. —Georges Altman, Ça, c’est du cinema, 1931 It’s almost true to say that a blind man faced with a genuine theatrical work or a deaf man faced with a genuine cinematic work, though they may both lose something of the work presented to them, should not lose the essence of it. —René Clair, Le Temps, 18 July 1932 Let’s identify some principles that will serve as the basis of our theory of sound film: a The silent film was the art of “printing”—of recording and disseminating—pantomime. a Just as printing had a great influence on literature, the silent film [through people like] Chaplin, Gance, Griffith and René Clair, served to re-invent pantomime. a Sound film is the art of “printing”—of recording and disseminating—theatrical works. a Sound film . . . must [therefore] re-invent the theatre.\n\n—Marcel Pagnol, Les Cahiers du film, 15 December 1933\n\nHere we have a machine capable of devouring the known universe, and all we’re allowed to feed it is scraps and leftovers. —Jacques Feyder, 1946, somewhat condensed by Chavance Carné? Just one of Prévert’s quainter inventions. —Henri Jeanson Although the avant-garde in its most extreme and typical form has disappeared, it doesn’t follow that the spirit of research and adventure is dead. If those who represent it no longer make “marginal” films it’s because for the most part the cinema industry has absorbed them, but has not by any means completely tamed them. —Jacques B. Brunius, En marge du cinéma français, 1954 It is impossible for a government that aspires to create a new social order to allow a means of propaganda as powerful as the cinema to remain in the hands of groups who may well have interests opposed to its own. —Paul Faure, confidant of Léon Blum, April 1936 Charlotte Lysès (Guitry’s wife, at the time): “I know of only two geniuses— Sacha and Hitler.” St. Exupéry (Later when she has left): “The coming war will be far worse than previous wars, because it will be a civil war that dare not speak its name.” —Carlo Rim, Mémoires d’une vieille vague, regarding April 1938 Those [Jews] that settled in Paris were essentially the worst sort of scum, the lowest grade of con-men, money-grubbing parasites cold-shouldered even by their fellow Jews of any standing. —Lucien Rebatet, Les Tribus du cinéma et du théâtre, 1941\n\nCONTENTS\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nxi\n\nIntroduction: The French Cinema in the 1930s The Introduction of Sound\n\nPART I.\n\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.\n\n1930 Prix de beauté (released 25 April) 17 Sous les toits de Paris (2 May) 19 L’Âge d’or (2 October) 22 Le Chemin du paradis (10 October) 25 Le Roi des resquilleurs (14 November) 28 La Petite Lise (4 December) 30\n\n7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12.\n\n1931 L’Opéra de quat’sous (19 February) 33 David Golder (6 March) 37 Le Million (3 April) 40 Marius (7 October) 42 La Chienne (20 November) 45 À nous la liberté (18 December) 48\n\n13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21.\n\n1932 Le Sang d’un poète (20 January) 52 Les 5 Gentlemen maudits (10 February) 54 Croix de bois (17 March) 57 L’Atlantide (8 June) 60 Les Gaietés de l’escadron (16 September) 63 Vampyr (23 September) 65 Poil de carotte (4 November) 68 Boudu sauvé des eaux (11 November) 71 L’Affaire est dans le sac (25 November) 73\n\n1\n\nPART II.\n\nThe Great Depression\n\n22. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27.\n\n1933 Quatorze juillet (13 January) 79 L’Homme à l’Hispano (24 March) 81 Théodore et Cie (7 April) 84 Zéro de conduite (7 April) 86 La Maternelle (1 September) 90 Cette vieille canaille (3 November) 93\n\n28. 29. 30. 31. 32. 33. 34. 35.\n\n1934 La Rue sans nom (26 January) 95 La Croisière jaune (18 March) 98 Ces messieurs de la Santé (23 March) 101 Le Grand Jeu (27 April) 104 L’Atalante (14 September) 106 Si j’étais le patron (1 October) 109 Angèle (26 October) 111 L’Hôtel du Libre Échange (9 November) 113\n\n36. 37. 38. 39. 40. 41. 42. 43. 44. 45.\n\n1935 Pension Mimosas (18 January) 116 Le Bonheur (8 February) 118 Toni (22 February) 121 Justin de Marseille (5 April) 124 Quelle drôle de gosse (17 May) 127 Crime et châtiment (17 May) 129 La Bandera (20 September) 131 Princesse Tam-Tam (18 October) 134 L’Équipage (25 October) 137 La Kermesse héroïque (1 December) 139\n\nPART III.

The Great Depression, which affected most of the Western world from 1929, did not strike France until somewhat later—it reached its apogee in 1932—but persisted somewhat longer. Coinciding as it did with the needs of the film industry to invest millions of francs in the conversion to sound, it caused a radical transformation of the industry. Politically, the implosion of capitalism that the Depression seemed to signal forced many to look elsewhere for an acceptable economic system or alternative ideology. The rise of fascism in Italy, then in Germany and Spain, together with the increased adhesion of left-leaning citizens to socialist or communist parties in the wake of the Russian Revolution, intensified debates around the government of France. The left-wing Popular Front under Léon Blum came to power in the crisis year of 1936, but the progressive disaffection that accompanied its three years in power, even among those who initially supported it, together with the fact that Blum himself was of Jewish extraction, ensured that political controversy would persist right through to the declaration of war in 1939. Then after six months of “phony” war, the disastrous collapse of the French Army in 1940 and the ensuing occupation would make for further national self-questioning, and impose additional constraints on the film industry as on every other area of society. Despite this extreme turbulence, during the ten years from 1929 to 1939, France managed to produce some 1,300 films. The films in this filmography have been selected from among those. Their selection was based on two or more of the following criteria: a The film has survived in a viewable form (a large percentage have not, especially from the early 1930s—only two such, #5 and 29, are included despite that). a The film is widely recognized as significant to the development of French cinema, because it was innovative, because of the personnel involved, or because of the popularity of the genre that it represents.\n\na The film can be seen as representative of certain typical themes, techniques, or procedures common to many other films of the period, or that distinguish it from other films of the period. a The film has been the subject of debate and contention within the nation or the critical community. Within these parameters, every effort has been made to include all the films of high quality that have survived. In particular, those directed by filmmakers acclaimed as “auteurs”—René Clair, Jacques Feyder, Jean Vigo, Jean Grémillon, Marcel Carné, and Jean Renoir—have been accorded due space. But an attempt has also been made to do justice to lesser-known directors such as Marc Allégret, Pierre Chenal, and Edmond T. Gréville, as well as to the prevailing genres of the age, and to promote a number of lesser-known films that deserve attention, including several of the most amusing comedies ever made in France: Sacha Guitry’s marvelous Le Roman d’un tricheur (#53); Fernandel’s neatest comedy, Tricoche et Cacolet (#80); two entertaining films with Michel Simon and Arletty, namely Fric-Frac and Circonstances atténuantes (#96); and little-known gems such as Les 5 Gentlemen maudits (#14), Monsieur Coccinelle (#83), and Quelle drôle de gosse (#40). There are others that could within the given criteria have been included, but I have resisted the temptation to continue further. The basic aim of the filmography is twofold: first, to relate all of these films to their social, political, and institutional origins, taking into account the filmmaking personnel and techniques that they used in the production of the films, in such a way as to build up a coherent overview of the French cinema of the decade and of its place and function in French society; and second, to provide sufficient information for contemporary film enthusiasts to know which of the relevant films would be of interest and of use to them. To ensure a wide coverage of the period, a limit of one thousand words per film has been imposed. This has the disadvantage of preventing full justice being done to films that have been the subject of extensive critical debate, such as Vigo’s L’Atalante and many Carné and Renoir films, where whole books have already been written on or around a given film. It would be wrong to treat this decade as a coherent and unified whole. Despite its relative mildness in France, the Great Depression (“la Crise”) had reduced economic productivity to 72 percent of its 1929 level by 1932 and had caused a series of bankruptcies (including that of Citroën and several banks), which reached a peak in 1934. These often involved scandal and corruption, as in the Stavisky, Hanau, and Ostrovsky affairs, the first of which, occurring in January 1934, brought down Camille Chautemps’s government. The sense of crisis was exacerbated by groups of right-wing demonstrators who on 6 Feb2\n\nFrench Cinema—A Critical Filmography\n\nruary 1934 massed outside the Chambre des Députés and demanded a strong government along the lines of that of Mussolini and of the recently elected Hitler. In reaction, left-wing groups (socialists, communists, radicals) began to seek an alliance where they had until recently competed, forming a united front (the “Popular Front”), and on 14 July 1935, half a million demonstrators marched through Paris demanding that democracy and the republic be protected. Elections were due on 26 April and 3 May 1936; from January, the Communist and Socialist Party leaders Maurice Thorez and Léon Blum campaigned in a concerted and effective fashion, winning 378 of the 578 seats. In the month before they could take power, however, there were widespread strikes from impatient workers (2.4 million on strike), many of whom occupied their workplaces and staged meetings—but also dances, communal songfests, and theatrical performances—in a spirit of exhilaration and expectation. On taking power, the new government introduced what became known as the Matignon Accords between employers and employees ensuring for everyone, and for the first time, paid holidays (fifteen days per year), a forty-hour work week (“the Tyranny of Idiocy,” according to the film industry), and worker representation on collective agreements for each category of work. These economic and sociopolitical events inevitably had a significant effect on the cinema of the decade, given the ideological character of film and the costly nature of cinematic production. Alongside the other industrial collapses, the four largest French production firms of the period 1930–1933—Gaumont, PathéNatan, Haïk, and Osso—collapsed, and statistics confirm a serious downturn in production in 1934 (see table 1). In all, this period of sociopolitical crisis lasted for two and a half years, from January 1934 to June 1936, so rather than as a coherent decade, we should see the 1930s as divided into three periods—1930–1933, 1934–1936, and 1937–1939. In the last of these periods, of course, frustrations encountered by the Popular Front led to the limitation then reversal of some social gains, while the possibility of war was never far from anyone’s mind. The Munich agreements, which seemed for a moment to avert that possibility, were signed on 29 September 1938, but war broke out just under a year later, on 3 September 1939. The first of the three periods was itself far from problem-free for the French cinema. Sound films had been made in the United States since 1926. When it became possible to make them in France in late 1928, the French cinema was not in a healthy position. Having invented the medium in 1895 and exploited it with unparalleled efficiency for twenty years, the French had seen their market dominance eroded by the disruptions of World War I, much of which was fought on French soil. Since that time, it had been the American cinema that had dominated the global market, while the French cinema had been reduced to little Introduction\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

The field of technical and aesthetic experimentation, the stylistic exploration of the expressive power of the image track, was the single aspect of film production of which the French could still feel proud in the period 1915 to 1929. The works that Abel Gance, Germaine Dulac, Louis Delluc, Marcel L’Herbier, Jean Epstein, René Clair, and others directed during these years can still be viewed with interest and admiration; but this was no longer a mass cinema, and the number of feature films produced each year was usually fewer than seventy. Sound changed all that by erecting semi-rigid barriers between the cinemas of different linguistic communities. The American cinema no longer had automatic access to countries such as France, and dubbed films proved less popular than native language productions. Consequently, the number of French films produced each year abruptly doubled to 150, their share of the national market tripled to 30 percent, and their percentage of box office takings soared to approach 50 percent—equal to that of the American cinema. From taking in 30 percent of receipts from all forms of entertainment in the 1920s, the French cinema leapt to 65 percent in the 1930s. In Paris in particular, which was always to contribute about a third of total French receipts (despite being only from 6–7% of the population), film receipts rose 280 percent between 1925 and 1935. Investors were intoxicated by the possibility of quick profits, and masses of small production companies were set up, often making no more than one or two films, as cheaply as possible. The demand for skilled personnel was intense in all fields, most notably those central to sound cinema—script-writing and dialogue, sound recording, and directing. This demand could not always be met, so it is not surprising that many of the resultant films are clumsy, and that the sound is often of inadequate quality. What is astonishing is that so many of them are, on the contrary, unforgettably brilliant. A large number of films were in production at the time of the introduction of sound. Foreseeing the commercial value of the new process, many producers opted to upgrade their silent films by the addition of greater or lesser degrees of sonorization. Many of the films of this period, therefore, while not silent, are not 100 percent sound films either. Early sound patents were held by American and German companies. Permission to use these patented processes largely offset the profits they attracted, reputedly resulting in a drain toward the patent-holders of 40–50 percent of the box office receipts. Moreover, in a bid to overcome the newly erected language barrier, these foreign firms set up companies to produce their films in France. For this they needed studios, because the introduction of sound had made control of the production environment even more essential than in the 1920s. Most studios were in or near Paris. The Pathé studios at Joinville-leIntroduction\n\n5\n\nPont, southeast of Paris, built in 1923 by the immigrant Polish entrepreneur Lewinsky and leased to Pathé, were bought by Natan in 1927 and equipped with RCA sound. Hundreds of films were made there during the 1930s by directors such as Julien Duvivier, Marcel Carné, Jacques Feyder, Marcel Pagnol, and Maurice Tourneur—some estimate 50 percent of all of French production between 1925 and 1950. Indeed, until 1934 it seemed possible that Pathé-Natan would develop into a vertically integrated company on the Hollywood model, since it owned three studio complexes and 15 percent of all French cinemas, and had an impressive array of actors on contract—Jean Gabin, Charles Vanel, Gaby Morlay, Victor Francen, Renée Saint-Cyr, and Gabriel Gabrio. Still hailed in December 1934 as the hero of French cinema, worthy of the Légion d’Honneur, Natan was however brought low by a trial for embezzlement at which rumors surfaced that he had been subject to bribery over pornographic activities. He was imprisoned in 1938, and when the Germans arrived, he was deported because of his Jewish ancestry, dying in Auschwitz. In April 1930, Paramount leased a Gaumont site at St. Maurice near the Pathé-Natan studio at Joinville. There they built a modern studio consisting of five or six stages, thirty production offices, forty-one actors’ lodges, and ten editing suites, with associated workshops and laboratories, where they proposed to centralize all of their European production. Equipped with RCA Photophone sound, St. Maurice was within two years producing 20 percent of all French films, sometimes using the general shots of an American original and interspersing these with close-ups retaken with a French cast. This technique allowed for cut-price production of films in any language desired, so Paramount was soon producing up to 150 “versions” of its films each year in France, in as many as fourteen different languages, for distribution throughout Europe. In 1934, however, Paramount decided that dubbing provided a more economical alternative. Until that point, St. Maurice was notorious as “Babel-sur-Seine,” where teams of actors succeeded one another on the same set to shoot the same scene, each team in its own language, thus “nationalizing” them. “The bosses are American, the administration Hungarian, the writers French, the directors Russian, the technicians German, the assistants Italian, the labourers from the Balkans. They film while eating, while sleeping, while swimming, while arguing. The great river of dollars flows endlessly. . . . It’s Babel.”1 Christian-Jaque directed twelve films there in two years. The Hungarian director Alexander Korda was hired to film Pagnol’s Marius there, with the French actors from the theatrical production playing their accustomed roles, but also in German and Swedish versions. Other American majors did the same, but based in Hollywood rather than in France. Britain was soon producing French and German versions of many of 6\n\nFrench Cinema—A Critical Filmography\n\nits films in England; the German firm UFA produced some 11 percent of the 1,300 “French” films of the 1930s, both at its Neubabelsburg studio in Berlin and at its Épinay studio just north of Paris, which it had bought in 1929 and equipped with Tobis Klangfilm sound in order to produce French films locally. UFA focused on quality rather than quantity (it was there that Clair made his first four sound films), which was, if anything, more disconcerting to the French than Paramount’s mass-market potboilers, since it challenged them in what they had hitherto held dearest. In Berlin, where the Neubabelsburg facilities were the envy of all visiting filmmakers, Raoul Ploquin was in charge of French production and had under contract Arletty, Annabella, Florelle, Jules Berry, Charles Boyer, Marie Bell, Pierre Brasseur, Fernandel, Fernand Gravey, Jean Murat, Albert Préjean, and Pierre-Richard Willm. Within a few years of the introduction of sound, over a third of the films officially labeled “French” had actually been produced in the United States, Britain, or Germany, or in France from modified American or German films. Despite serious apprehensions about this foreign “takeover,” the French cinema flourished during that decade. When the worst of the Depression finally hit France in 1932, the French cinema resisted its effects markedly better than most other areas of the economy, and remained a relatively promising target for investors throughout the decade.2 Consequently, the number of studios expanded: PathéNatan owned the other studios at Épernay, alongside those of Tobis, together with the Francœur studio inside Paris, built by Natan in 1927 and sonorized with Tobis sound in 1929. The largest studio in Paris was the Gaumont “cité LG” at Buttes-Chaumont, with nine stages. In the environs, there were studios at Courbevoie (two stages) and Billancourt, the latter of which burned down in 1933 but was rebuilt with three, then six stages. Outside of the Paris region, the most significant production facilities were on the Riviera, at Nice (La Victorine, between five and seven stages; Nicaea, two, then three), and in Marseilles, where Pagnol, flush with funds, had in 1934 cobbled together three stages and supplemented them with a property at La Treille near Aubagne for exteriors, complete with fake Provençal village. In total, there were some fifty stages available at the beginning of the decade and sixty at the end, so the production of some 150 films a year suggests a low rate of production (about 2.5–3 films per stage per year), mainly because the Riviera studios were little used. French production differed from that of other countries in these early sound years, even before the collapse of the majors, in that it consisted of several hundred small production firms, almost all of which produced no more than one or two films per year, or even in total. Moreover, very few of them owned production facilities, which had to be hired, preferably for as short a time as possible. Again, few producers had any guarantee of access either to distribution Introduction\n\n7\n\nor exhibition, which remained in separate hands throughout the rest of the decade. After 1932, therefore, there was nothing remotely resembling the array of American majors, with their vertical integration of production, distribution, and exhibition, or the single dominant firms—Rank and UFA, respectively—in Britain and Germany. Both Pathé and Gaumont could have assumed such a role within French cinema, early on absorbing a number of smaller companies that could no longer compete, but before they could begin to monopolize the market, the succession of scandals relating to financial mismanagement and banking collapses brought them both down. This “incoherence” of the French industry was exacerbated when more effective forms of dubbing influenced the foreign majors to renounce their multiple language productions and reduce the number of films made in France. Consequently, the 150 films produced in any given year were funded by as many as sixty separate small companies, which then depended on independent distribution and exhibition firms to market and screen them. These small production companies were in a constant state of crisis. One source of their problems was the diminishing returns for their product, as exhibitors sought to gain an advantage over rivals by offering a double program, or even live acts and food with their films. In extreme cases, six or ten films were offered for a single entry price. The resulting returns per film were correspondingly lower. Moreover, competition resulted in a price squeeze that made cinema a cheap form of popular entertainment: the average entry price was 6 francs, as against 25 francs for a boxing match and 35–45 francs to go to the theater or music hall. In these circumstances, despite the fact that the French cinema was probably globally profitable, the French language market was too small to guarantee adequate returns to the majority of producers, and the language barrier that had permitted the national cinema’s renaissance was threatening to stifle it. One solution to the limited national market would have been the development of an export market, yet the industry proved unable or unwilling to develop and exploit foreign markets. More systematic attempts to do so in the late 1930s, based on success in high-profile events such as the Venice Biennale, came to an end with the outbreak of World War II. As a result of these financial limitations, studio owners were reluctant or unable to invest in upgrading their facilities, and the deteriorating standard of these locations was a constant source of complaint. Furthermore, every film was a crucial financial investment for these small producers, and any miscalculation meant that the firm could go bankrupt. Since up to a third of each year’s films failed to cover costs, the 1930s saw hundreds of fly-by-night firms appear then crash, only to reappear under another name to make another (equally risky) film. The government was well aware of this chaotic situation and com8\n\nFrench Cinema—A Critical Filmography\n\nmissioned two reports in the course of the decade (by Maurice Petsche in 1934 and Guy de Carmoy in 1936) with a view to resolving it. These produced admirable recommendations, which, if followed, might well have consolidated the French cinema, but the government was never in a position to implement them. Consequently, the film industry settled into the form that it retained throughout the decade and indeed in many respects beyond: a patchwork of production, distribution, and exhibition firms, lacking any coherent legislative framework within which to operate, lacking any large-scale organizations capable of dominating and driving the industry, lacking any continuity of personnel, and lacking any assured funding for production, let alone for the modernization of facilities. French film personnel viewed 1930 as a feverish year of high hopes in their industry, while the following three years saw an enormous number of mostly incompetent productions—often remakes of theatrical works—that caused anguish among reviewers and decreasing returns to the producers. Only in the 1934–1935 season did the industry’s confidence begin to return, as a series of well-made films received both critical acclaim and encouraging box-office returns. Headlines from that season announced “Quantity diminishes, but quality seems to be improving” and “Astounding Recovery of the French Cinema.”3 As Raymond Borde said in his typically aggressive way, after the tyranny of all those bad plays, The fog lifts towards 1934: With Le Grand Jeu, L’Atalante, Toni, La Bandera and La Kermesse héroïque, French production has hit its straps, and it proceeds right through till the war to experience an astounding period. These are the years of total success, of creation in every sense of the word, and it is obvious that any national film industry capable of producing one after the other La Belle Équipe, Le Crime de Monsieur Lange, L’Homme de nulle part, Pépé le Moko, Quai des brumes, Mollenard, La Bête humaine, Regain, Le Jour se lève, Derrière la façade and La Règle du jeu is an art that has overcome its contradictions. . . . Against the films of the right (Trois de Saint-Cyr, L’Appel du silence, Un de la légion) there will now be films from the left: the Groupe Octobre, Prévert, Carné, Renoir fairly often, and sometimes Duvivier. Our screens will now reflect what they had hitherto the task of concealing—the division of France into two factions.4 The number of films included in this filmography from the final three years of the decade is sufficient indication of the degree of exhilaration and even euphoria that prevailed during that final prewar period, as festival successes and Introduction\n\n9\n\nprizes recognized the French industry’s production as second only to that of America, and as international releases began at last to supplement local box-office returns. It may be difficult to understand how, within the fragmented and chaotic system that still prevailed, so many high-quality films could have been produced, but there is no doubt that many filmmakers preferred, and even flourished in, this anarchic environment. In subsequent decades, when governmental regulation, financial stability, technical professionalism, and union regulation came to be accepted as normal and even inevitable, many looked back nostalgically to the 1930s as a heroic age—a moment when everything depended on personal contacts, and when what counted was improvisation, imagination, and the ability to get the best out of inadequate funds and technology. The procedures that the filmmakers adopted in these trying circumstances allow the resultant sound films to be grouped under three general headings: a One option was to record preexisting theatrical successes. A large number of boulevard comedies were transcribed more or less directly to film, as were vaudevilles, farces, musical comedies, and operettas, as well as more serious dramas. This strategy was favored because of its cheapness, since it required little extra work or expense; it was strongly defended, at least initially, by playwrights such as Marcel Pagnol and Sacha Guitry. One effect was to import theatrical structures and acting styles into the cinema, where they proved less appropriate. a A second option was “realism” of the sort generally seen as originating in the nineteenth-century novel, which involved the use of sound simply as a support to the image and to reinforce its credibility. An extreme form of this strategy was used in particular for the representation of working-class environments and the underworld, resulting at times in a raw documentary or social realist style, often termed “naturalism.” a The third option, which was favored by avant-garde directors who had worked in the 1920s cinema, was a more ambitious form of sound-image relationship, often described by the musical term “counterpoint,” and requiring strenuous interpretative strategies on the part of the spectators. The films best remembered from 1930–1933 are those made by this latter category of avant-garde directors—Luis Buñuel, Jean Cocteau, Carl Dreyer, 10\n\nFrench Cinema—A Critical Filmography\n\nGeorg-Wilhelm Pabst, and René Clair. Relatively few of the films from that category attracted large audiences. Moreover, most of these directors found it impossible to continue the avant-garde techniques of the 1920s beyond 1933 because of the markedly higher cost of production of sound films. Rich patrons were few and far between, and faced with the Depression, commercial producers were less and less willing to risk funds on films that had no chance of reaching mass audiences. Furthermore, initially the cumbrous nature of sound technology increased the difficulty in realizing fluid or adventurous sequences. Both Abel Gance and Marcel L’Herbier suffered from this set of problems, the latter (and even the former on occasion) resigning himself to commercial projects in order to fund the occasional more ambitious film. Already by 1931, therefore, it had become apparent that French cinema was to be dominated by theatrical translations and by more or less realistic fiction films with a coherent narrative and with conventional social and psychological characterization based on that developed in the novel during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Also, despite desperate attempts by the industry’s spokespeople to distinguish French from American cinema, which was seen as disastrously dependent on generic patterns bearing little relationship to “real life,” it is not too hard to see a number of genres emerging in France in the course of the decade. In some cases, this was because the genres already existed in the literary and theatrical worlds on which the cinema was so heavily dependent for its scripts; in others because (as in America itself) one year’s successes tended to be replicated in slightly variant forms in the following year. After 1933, however, since neither cast nor crew were on the long-term contracts available to American producers, a French producer could not call on the same writers, actors, or technicians from one year to another as they could in America. Consequently, this generic replication was less “efficient” and less formulaic in France than it was in Hollywood films. The film entries for the 1930s are organized chronologically according to the date on which they were first commercially released, except where they were not released (or not released commercially) until much later (e.g., La Vie est à nous, #49, and Une partie de campagne, # 55) or where films substantially completed in 1939 were delayed by the outbreak of war. These latter are included at the end in order of release. About 70 percent of the production of the early sound years has been lost, or is not readily viewable, including the great majority of sound feature films from 1929 and 1930, but the annual count of films lost or unavailable reduces to about 10 percent by the end of the decade. In all, about 500 of the 1,300 films are readily available for study, and a somewhat smaller number for public screening. All the films mentioned have been viewed except for the two noted as probably not surviving—#5 and 29. Most of the others can be Introduction\n\n11\n\nobtained (without subtitles) from René Chateau. The rest are viewable at the BiFi in Paris or the Cinémathèque de Toulouse. In each entry, where no English title is in common use, the French title has been literally translated and shown in parentheses on the line beneath the French title. Cross-references between entries are signalled by #, so #19 means “see entry number 19.” In conclusion, the decade of the 1930s was an exhilarating one for the French cinema. As a result of the introduction of sound, French films rediscovered their national audience. Because of France’s status as a refuge for those displaced by the Russian Revolution and the rise of fascism, the cinema was able to profit from the expertise of numerous foreign technicians. Finally, toward the end of the decade, the French cinema’s successes in international competitions and festivals brought to the attention of the world one of the great stylistic and thematic movements of all time, Poetic Realism. The theory behind that movement was best expressed by the set designers who developed it—Lazare Meerson and his three great disciples, Alexandre Trauner, Léon Barsacq, and Georges Wahkévitch, all of whom worked with him as assistants at one time or another, and assimilated his notion of stylization through simplification. As Barsacq put it, You should choose the most typical elements [of the proposed locale]. A transposition is necessary to obtain on the screen the equivalent of reality . . . ; and that transposition is only possible if one designs a decor which recreates what is most essential in a particular locale. . . . To obtain the “equivalent” reality it is necessary to bring out the rich or the sordid, the cluttered or the bare, the light or the heavy aspect of a setting, by exaggerating the dominant character of the elements that go to make it up while suppressing the useless details.5 The heightened reality that resulted would be more real than the real, more credible than the documentary. In asserting this, he was drawing on the work and pronouncements of Alexandre Trauner, who designed most of the sets for Marcel Carné and who said, “The important thing is to isolate in whatever locale one is representing the principal characteristic details, and to bring them out at the expense of those which don’t contribute to the atmosphere. . . . Sometimes it is the shape of a window, of a door, of a roof which the spectators will register immediately as a Parisian house, or a Northern house, or a Provençal house; or it may be the paving of a street, the trolley of a tramway. We seek to awaken memories inscribed in the spectator’s subconscious.” 6\n\n12\n\nFrench Cinema—A Critical Filmography\n\nNotes 1.

Bandini (Antonin), André Nicolle (secretary), Yves Glad (Maharaja), Gaston Jacquet (Duc de la Tour Chalgrin), Alex Bernard (photographer), and Marc Ziboulsky (manager). The bewildering list of credits for direction and script above give some idea of the complicated origins of this film, but the reality is even more astonishing. The film was begun in 1929 as a silent film. Most sources say the scenario was primarily René Clair’s, from an idea by Georg-Wilhelm Pabst, and that Clair intended to direct it himself, but the final scenario departed significantly from the original proposal and was rejected by the producer. Meanwhile, Clair had seen the first talkies and had revised the script to include sound. It was still rejected, however, perhaps for financial reasons, and was finally allocated to the experienced Italian director Augusto Genina. SOFAR was an Italian-German-French production company, so it decided for tactical reasons to shoot the film silent, then postsynch it in four languages, dubbing with different actors. Louise Brooks’s voice, for example, was dubbed in the French version by Hélène Regelly. It is astounding that such a multi-sourced film should be so coherent and so powerful, and no less astounding in that sound seems integral to the design of the film as it now stands. The climactic final scene, which had been central to Clair’s scenario, must nevertheless have been conceived in its present form after the decision to sonorize. The story is simple: Lucienne becomes a star, and it proves fatal to her. At first she and André are a humble working-class couple; she works as a typist in The Introduction of Sound\n\n17\n\na pressroom but dreams of a more glamorous life. Thanks to a beauty contest, she is able to achieve it; we follow her from office girl to Miss France and finally to her crowning in Spain as Miss Europe. She is courted by a prince, a duke, and a maharajah, and invited to do a screen test. The high life turns her head, and André issues an ultimatum: return to Paris and marry him, or it is all over. She is torn but accepts, and we see her trying to reconcile herself to a meager living in a sordid apartment with André. Finally, unable to endure it, she slips away to do the screen test. While she is watching the rushes with the producer, André sneaks into the projection room and shoots her dead. The film is, then, clearly reflexive: its focus is on the making of a film, and more generally on the corrupting effect of the media. It constitutes a critique of the myth of the star, which was clearly, along with the beauty contest, the “idea” suggested to Clair by Pabst. This makes the presence of Louise Brooks in the central role particularly appropriate, since her abrupt rise to fame in the preceding three years had made of her just such a star, notably in two Pabst films (Pandora’s Box and The Diary of a Lost Girl). Prix de beauté picks up on several of her previous roles as a basically good-hearted girl whose intense sexuality almost accidentally entrains fatal consequences. From our first meeting with the couple, André is intensely jealous of the admiring glances she attracts, and she attempts to defuse the situation by putting on a record of the song “Ne sois pas jaloux” (“Don’t be jealous this evening, I only have one love, and it’s you. . . . You must forgive me,” etc.). It becomes their theme song, and what outrages André in the final scene is that, in the rushes of the film, she is singing “their” song. As she collapses dead, her giant recorded image continues above the scene of the murder, singing gaily on. Here already in the form “reality versus representation” we find the contrast of recorded versus real, and public gaiety versus private grief, which were to become regular motifs of 1930s films. The final images are of the flickering light of the screen illuminating fitfully their two faces—André somber, her dead. Although this critique of the star is central to the film, what is no less fascinating is the exploration of sonorization techniques used in what had begun as a silent film. The sound-track is omnipresent, but only rarely are there moments of diegetic conversation or diegetically sourced sound and music (that is, sound for which the source is either visible on the screen or implied by the actions on the screen). The early beach and street scenes are accompanied by a babble of bathers and of traffic, out of which occasional identifiable voices arise. The pressroom scene that follows celebrates the futurist dynamism of the machines with bustling music, a player piano, the typewriters joining in a quasi-symphonic soundmix, and a loud-speaker announcing the beauty competition. All of this is accompanied by a montage of images, including documentarystyle “hidden camera” images of the street scene. Lucienne’s fashion magazines 18\n\nFrench Cinema—A Critical Filmography\n\ninspire her with apparently unrealizable yearnings, and these dreams are forcefully contrasted with her actual existence, both when we see André returning from work with grubby hands and broken fingernails, and again when she and friends visit a fairground. There, grotesque images of “the people” aggress her until she wonders what she is doing amid this crush of unlovely individuals. Throughout her ascent to Miss Europe, this montage of sounds and images accompanies and comments on her aspirations and fears, but also (once she has decided to marry André) on his jealousy and frustrations. In the bleaker central section, in their unhappy flat, her moment of fame cannot be forgotten: her image intrudes in newspapers used as wrapping, and fans inundate her with mail and photos to sign. André rips them all up and wanders disconsolate through the streets, finally spying on her encounter with the prince/producer of her film. Technically, then, this is an enormously ambitious film, including location shooting, a series of rapid camera movements, and several long tracking shots, all of which were shot with a silent camera and the likes of which were to become well-nigh impossible for the next few years, as the heavily blimped camera (that is, enclosed in soundproof casing) lumbered around the confined spaces of the studio. Genina was to direct another five films in France in the next few years, one of which, interestingly, was called Ne sois pas jalouse, while another, Paris béguin (Paris Infatuation), with Jean Gabin, likewise dealt with the preparation of a performance and ended with his murder beneath a giant poster of the star who loves him, and who has to perform smiling through her tears. Pabst was also to make five more films in French versions, two of which are included here (#7 and 16), while even as this film came out, René Clair was putting the finishing touches to his first sound film, Sous les toits de Paris, which we examine next.\n\n2.

The Introduction of Sound\n\n19\n\nRené Clair has become by far the best-known of early sound directors, which is a little surprising given that more than any other, he spoke out against the introduction of sound. He had been a journalist, writer, and film actor before making his name as a director, notably with two art films (Paris qui dort, 1923, and Entr’acte, 1924) and two adaptations of popular comedies by Eugène Labiche (Un chapeau de paille d’Italie, 1927, and Les Deux timides, 1928). Clair was responsible for both the script and direction of his first five sound films, all made in France, of which this was the first. Both here and later in Le Million (1931, #9) and Qua­ torze juillet (1933, #22), he appealed to a particular mythic view of Paris and of “the little people” who are seen as essential to its vitality—not professionals or the rich, who are consistently mocked and ridiculed, but working-class people whose hardships are never dwelt on and whose joie de vivre is irrepressible. Clair’s art director, Lazare Meerson, produced an unforgettable representation of the poorer quarters of Paris, featuring narrow streets and tall apartment buildings with steep stairwells and austere but well-lit rooms, aesthetically worn and stained, looking out over endless tiled rooftops. The male characters tend toward the artistic (street singers, accordionists, sculptors) or the mechanical (taxi drivers), while the females are usually associated with flowers or with laundering—purity or nature. Sous les toits de Paris and its “sequels” follow the entanglements of such characters from bedrooms to bars to dance halls. There is always one exotic, capricious girl (often Eastern European) who plays male friends off against each other, and this behavior invariably leads the narrative toward the margins of the law, where amiable crooks and colorful fences, casually accepted as mates, confuse the borderline between the poor and the underworld. No stigma attaches to criminality, only to wealth, and no stigma attaches to sexuality or inconstancy: the characters’ entanglements are presented as moves in an elaborate game, with momentary winners and losers, where moralizing is irrelevant. In Sous les toits de Paris, Albert is a street-singer who sees Pepe the pickpocket at work on the rich among his circle of listeners and gets paid off for holding his tongue.1 Fred is a beggar who pretends blindness to con the wealthy. Albert introduces himself to the flirtatious Pola by “finding” her purse, and from then on, she gives the narrative such direction as it has by being the object of desire of Albert, of Fred, and of Albert’s mate Louis. In Albert’s absence, Louis wins her; when they break up, however, she goes off with Fred. Consolation is never far\n\n1. This opening sequence had originally been written for Prix de beauté and been conceived while Clair was shooting Le Fantôme du Moulin Rouge in 1924. Billard, L’Âge classique du cinéma français, 153; Dale, The Films of René Clair, 1:137.\n\n20\n\nFrench Cinema—A Critical Filmography\n\naway for the “losers.” Toward the end, she attempts to play them all off against each other, but in a Clair film, the women can never be taken too seriously: their main function is to clarify and ratify the relationships among the men. Friendship will always triumph over desire. Here the men finally throw dice for Pola, and Albert cheats to allow her to go off with Fred. This foregrounding of the game-like patterning of relationships is confirmed in the final circular sequence in which Albert is back singing in the street and flirting with someone else: another day, another girl, and so it goes. If the film is, then, sentimental about the settings and atmosphere, it is far from sentimental about the characters and their relationships. No real attempt is made to exploit identification mechanisms that might invite the viewer to take seriously the characters’ losses, confusions, and infidelities. For Clair at this time, individuals were clearly less important than atmosphere and milieu. This disavowal of drama in favor of a sort of ballet-like set of advances and retreats is only heightened by the foregrounding of sound-image relationships. Much of the action is patterned on the verses of the songs or a record-player or the dance-hall orchestra. Elsewhere, non-diegetic music comments comically on the action, with a death march for instance, or with raindrops or with “cat-like tread.” Conversations that risk turning dramatic are totally drowned in orchestral sound, leaving nothing but frenetic gestures, and any threatening intimacy is distanced by being unheard—witnessed, for instance, through a glass door. There is, in fact, little synchronized dialogue. The first example is well into the film. Partly this is because sound mixing was not yet available, and the soundtrack had to be recorded integrally. But also Clair professed nostalgia (already!) for the silent film, and such was his dislike of the constant chatter that had resulted from the introduction of sound that he strove here to produce essentially a silent film with just a little supporting dialogue to avoid cumbersome subtitles. “People use dialogue,” Clair said, “when they can’t figure out how to carry off a scene visually.”2 “The sonorized film is the last hope for partisans of the silent film.”3 Indeed, in all of these early sound films, he considered dialogue so secondary that he merely gave his actors general indications, allowing them to improvise the precise phrases “as in commedia dell’arte.”4 Critically acclaimed for its exploratory use of sound, Sous les toits de Paris experienced, perhaps because of its somewhat sardonic tone, at best a desultory general release in Paris, only gradually over the following years acquiring the audi-\n\n2.

Arguably this was due to the fact that this poeticized version of Paris was more recognizable to foreigners than to the French themselves, constructed as it was, or was to be, by foreigners such as Meerson, Kertesz, and George Brassaï.6 The studio boss of the French arm of Tobis, Henckel, was so delighted with the film’s triumph in his homeland that he renewed Clair’s contract on very favorable terms, giving him a free hand to make his next three films with them. The two other Parisian films were likewise largely devoid of dramatic plot, employing analogous formal patterns. Each of the three is a musical of a sort, expressing Clair’s affection for popular ballads and his apparent conviction that their musicality was a manifestation of the working class’s vitality, sincerity, and integrity. It is one of the more interesting aspects of Clair’s films that high culture and wealthy businessmen should be so mocked by an author wedded to that very culture and born into a wealthy business family.\n\n3.

The release of L’Âge d’or was accompanied by the notorious Surrealist Manifesto, which was designed in part to promote Luis Buñuel as the only authentic surrealist filmmaker. Film had been a central focus from the beginning of the surrealist movement, both because of the analogy of screen and mirror and because of the dreamlike conditions in viewing films, which should favor the communication of the unconscious. Arising out of the Dadaist movement and deriving its 5. See Icart, La Révolution du parlant, 385–390. 6. See the argument in Bergfelder et al., Film Architecture, 174–178. 7. The two had parted company by this time, and little of Dalí subsists in the film.\n\n22\n\nFrench Cinema—A Critical Filmography\n\ntheory from a surprisingly ebullient version of Freudian dream theory, surrealism saw society as inherently repressive and the surrealist’s task as the liberation of the spectator’s repressed self. Since this neatly complemented the contemporary communist proposition that capitalist society repressed the working classes and that a revolutionary, class-based liberation was required, there was from early on a close relationship between communism and surrealism, between social and psychic revolutions, and between the two main cultural proponents of these movements in 1930s France, Louis Aragon and André Breton. Both signed the manifesto that accompanied L’Âge d’or, which foreshadowed the imminent annihilation of capitalist society and which noted that the film was being released at a moment when the rotting hulk of capitalist society was at its most enfeebled, struggling to survive through the agency of priests and of the police. The manifesto praised the film’s violent attacks on religion and its assertion of the need for a transfigurative and redemptive “Love” (i.e., uninhibited sexuality)—“that principle of Evil in the bourgeoisie’s demonology”—to achieve these twin forms of liberation. Buñuel had of course produced an earlier film based on surrealist principles —the short Un chien andalou (1928).8 No one who has seen the film will ever forget it, if only because of the prostrate priests and the dead mule carcasses draped over a grand piano that are dragged on stage (symbolizing, according to Raymond Durgnat, “the dead weight of education”9), not to mention the girl’s eye sliced open with a cut-throat razor. Sound film was to severely restrict the production of such avant-garde films as this, because of the high cost of sound production and the relatively limited audience. A private patron was one possible solution, and fortunately there were still several available at this time. René Clair (for Entr’acte) and his brother, Henri Chomette, had already received such support. Carl Dreyer was about to benefit from another patron. In 1929, the Vicomte de Noailles decided to commission a series of experimental films as a gift to his wife.10 Jean Cocteau (Le Sang d’un poète, #13) and Man Ray both benefited from his generosity, as did Buñuel for L’Âge d’or. Initially shot silent, it was subsequently sonorized. Several early accounts suggest that a silent version also circulated. L’Âge d’or has been accused of being obsessed with sacrilege. Certainly it goes out of its way to provoke and offend as many right-minded people as possible. A blind man is knocked down, a dog kicked, a son casually slaughtered by his father, the female lead’s old mother brutally slapped, and so on. But it is clearly the religious who are the main target: a Christ figure is seen emerging from one of 8. L’Âge d’or was initially to be entitled La Bête andalouse and was conceived as a sequel. 9.

The film ends with a cross decked out in grotesque ornaments, notably pubic hair. Clearly Buñuel’s religious upbringing has something to do with the satisfaction he takes in ridiculing the church and the dignitaries who revere it (here, politicians, nuns, the military, curates, etc.) and who proceed to build their church on this desolate rock. Unlike the effete esthetics of Cocteau’s films, this no less inventive film passionately attacks the bases of contemporary society. Right-minded people were justified in their desire to demolish it. Against these forces of convention and oppression, the leading male and female figures, first discovered writhing in the mud in a violently sexual embrace and ululating mating cries, struggle futilely throughout the film. Brutally separated by the outraged citizens, they strive repeatedly and angrily to be reunited but are thwarted. Arguably by the end of the film, the male lead has managed to liberate himself from the moral repressions of his social upbringing; though critic Peter Harcourt sees actor Gaston Modot’s character, on the contrary, as being at that point definitively defeated by the conventions of the society he is in rebellion against.11 It would be inappropriate, then, to give the impression that the film is structured around any readily recognizable narrative.12 What matters is the alliance of sexuality and revolt. Images succeed one another according to patterns of association rather than of temporal or logical causality, and reference to psychoanalytical theory is often necessary to interpret them. Implicitly, the film mimics the way the unconscious works. And when sound was added to the film, any tentative realist interpretation was further distanced by the lack of synchronicity. At one point, the soundtrack provides a subjective voice off; at another, the lovers, dressed and in public, are nevertheless accompanied by a bedroom dialogue. For the most part, however, the music is used to characterize or comment on silent scenes, the final blasphemous images being accompanied by a jocular dance tune.13\n\n11.

This movement, begun in 1921 by a group of directors, critics, actors, and painters meeting at Canudo’s Club des Amis du Septième Art, had been effective in creating for film an aesthetically informed audience, and a number of specialist cinemas had been established to cater to their taste.14 Founded in 1928, Studio 28 was the third of these (preceded by the Vieux Colombier and the Ursulines). On 3 December 1930, two months after L’Âge d’or opened in it, a cabal of right-wing critics (reputedly from the League of Patriots and the Anti-Jew League) disrupted the screening with shouts, smoke-bombs, and ink bombs. Cinema seats were broken, and paintings by Salvador Dalí, Max Ernst, Man Ray, Joan Miró, and Yves Tanguy were slashed. A week of agitation by the right-wing press, which denounced the film as satanic and as obscene surrealist garbage (“Âge d’or, âge d’ordure”—Golden Age, garbage age), calling it “Bolshevik propaganda dragging through the mud all that we French hold most sacred,” saw first the excision by the censors of the archbishop scenes, then on 11 December, the total prohibition of the film and temporary closure of the cinema. Officially the film remained banned until 1981—a remarkable achievement for the forces of repression given that censorship has never been particularly aggressive in France and was at its least effective in the chaotic 1930s.15\n\n4.

A 1931 poll of the French public seeking to identify the stars they thought most photogenic placed Henri Garat second (after Suzy Vernon) and Lilian Harvey third. Yet the film that established them can now seem clumsily put together and sung without much talent or panache. In 1930, sound itself was a sufficient attraction for the viewing public, regardless of story or style, and when combined with a few rousing songs, sound films rapidly came to seem to production companies a route to effortless profitability. In Le Chemin du paradis, the hit song “Avoir un bon copain” (When you have a good mate) served to promote the film on the streets and in the drawing rooms, and survived through the decade as a celebration of mateship. The film’s theme song, “Tout est permis quand on rêve” (Everything is possible in a dream), usefully defines the feel-good fantasy world in which these musicals customarily took place. Garat, like many of the stars who were to feature prominently in the musicals (and indeed the mainstream films) of the 1930s, had already made his name in the world of popular music. Several, such as Georges Milton, Maurice Chevalier, Florelle, Yvonne Printemps, Gaby Morlay, Viviane Romance, Fernandel, and Jean Gabin, had come from the music hall and caf ’conc (café concert) scene. Gabin’s first film, Chacun sa chance (Steinhoff and Pujol, 1930), was the transcription to film of a musical, and in view of his later roles, it is amusing to see a slim, sleek Gabin playing the romantic lead in that film. Garat himself was making another musical for UFA at the same time—Flagrant délit—partnering Blanche Montel, where Lilian Harvey and Willy Fritsch sang in the original German version, but it was not so successful as Le Chemin du paradis so UFA continued thereafter to record the French versions of its musicals with the Garat/ Harvey (French/British-born German) couple—successively Princesse, à vos or­ dres (Schwarz and de Vaucorbeil, 1931), La Fille et le garçon (Thiele and le Bon, 1931), Le Congrès s’amuse (Charell and Boyer, 1931), and Un rêve blond (Martin, 1932), not to mention Moi et l’impératrice (Hollaender and Martin, 1932), where Charles Boyer replaced Henri Garat. Such was the demand for these musicals that, in parallel with these films for UFA, Henri Garat was starring in a series of them for Paramount at its Saint Maurice studios with Meg Lemonnier as his partner—Rive gauche (Korda, 1931), Il est charmant (Mercanton, 1931), Une petite femme dans le train (Anton, 1932), Simone est comme ça (Anton, 1932), and finally Un soir de réveillon (Anton, 1933). This list constitutes a relatively small selection of the musicals produced in France in these three years. Certain ones among them were very popular, especially Le Congrès s’amuse, which was more efficiently narrated than its predecessor and where the music was largely integrated into the diegesis. Like Le Chemin du paradis, it has a theme song foregrounding its dreamlike nature—“Serait-ce un rêve, un joli rêve” (Could it all be a beautiful dream?)—though when the tsar is called away 26\n\nFrench Cinema—A Critical Filmography\n\nfrom his romantic dalliance to deal with Napoleon, it turns into “It was only a beautiful dream.” The storyline of Le Chemin du paradis itself is rudimentary. Three friends down on their luck—Willy, Jean, and Guy—establish a service station; one of their first customers is Liliane, daughter of a wealthy businessman. All three meet her separately and fall in love; a mild rivalry ensues until she invites them all to a restaurant where it becomes apparent she has chosen Willy (Garat, played in the German original by Willy Fritsch). Her father buys the service station and appoints the three to sinecures, where they are bored out of their minds in a gentle mockery of capitalism analogous to À nous la liberté (#12). The business is called SADE—la Société Anonyme des Dépots d’Essence, “à responsabilité extrêmement limitée” (an extremely limited company). Willy resigns in disgust, only to find he has accidentally signed a marriage contract. That one or the other of the protagonists should be wealthy or aristocratic was a prerequisite of these fantasy musicals. As their titles imply, aristocratic flirtations lie behind Le Congrès s’amuse, Moi et l’impératrice, and Princesse, à vos ordres, while Gabin in Chacun sa chance is a salesman who finds himself mistaken for a baron, courting a theater chocolate-girl under the impression she is a wealthy businesswoman. Indeed, impersonation and mistaken identity are standard narrative ploys in these frivolous musicals. Tsar Alexander I in Le Congrès s’amuse has a body double to stand in at boring or dangerous events while he circulates incognito, so the humble glove salesgirl does not realize that her beau is the great tsar. For much of the time, the spectator also is uncertain which is which, given that both are played by Garat. Along with wealth and a title, the stellar glamor of theaters, nightclubs, and balls is a common element—each film includes a visit to a glamorous nightclub or restaurant, where tap-dancers dance to a piano (or in one case on the piano), or to the Folies, where girls dance in spangled g-strings. Later in the decade, it became more common to aim for a greater degree of realism in musicals, by totally integrating the performance element into the narrative (Tino Rossi as a singer with a problem, or Mistinguett rehearsing and staging a revue, for example), but at this point, the artifice of performance was usually enjoyed for its own sake. Extra-diegetic orchestras swell up whenever the characters turn to the camera to sing, and barmen or tradesmen put down tools to sing and dance as a chorus. Indeed, tentative forms of special effects were considered appropriate to the artifice of such films: in Le Chemin du paradis, the furniture flies out the door of its own accord (which presumably was what impressed Clair when he saw it), while in Le Congrès s’amuse, the chairs sway in time to the orchestra. In Il est charmant, the law student tempted by love and the Folies Bergère daydreams a miniaturized performance on his desktop, while in Chacun sa chance, a presenter says, “Since this is a talkie, let’s talk,” and proceeds to introduce the The Introduction of Sound\n\n27\n\ncast and (otherwise extra-diegetic) orchestra in the pit in front of the stage curtain. Likewise, in Le Chemin du paradis, when the curtain closes at the end of the film, Willy and Liliane embrace, then “notice” that their audience is waiting for the obligatory finale, so they reprise the big song and dance number. Nevertheless, Le Chemin du paradis is exceptional for its time in rejecting the fantastic, the glamorous, and the aristocratic, mobilizing “ordinary human beings” in relatively realistic surroundings.16 Incidentally, René Lefebvre who here plays Willy’s gormless, bespectacled assistant, was to play the lead in Clair’s Le Million (#9), partly inspired by the success of Le Chemin du paradis, and later in Renoir’s Le Crime de Monsieur Lange (#46). During the war, he became a resistance leader in the south of France.17\n\n5. Le Roi des resquilleurs (The King of Conmen) France, 1930, unknown length, b&w Dir Pière Colombier; Asst dir Harold Earle; Prod Pathé-Natan; Scr Colombier and René Pujol; Cinematog Fédote Bourgassoff; Music Ralph Erwin and Casimir Oberfeld; Art dir Jacques Colombier; Sound Carl Livermann; Act Georges Milton (Bouboule), Pierre Nay (René Francis), Hélène Perdrière (Lulu), Hélène Robert (Arlette), Mady Berry (Madame Francis), Jean Garat (Sycleton), Henri Kerny, Bérétrot, Jim Prat, Léon Bernstein, and Bob Desmarets. This film seems to have disappeared, which is unfortunate since it was the most popular film of the whole decade in Paris, rivaled only by La Grande Illu­ sion (#60), and in the next decade, Les Enfants du paradis. Released about 15 November 1930 in a two-thousand-seat cinema, it was still in exclusive release at the end of the following year (for a total of eighteen months), at which point it was released generally into some forty-one suburban cinemas, earning in all 30 million francs. It would have been fascinating to see just what made it so successful. Aside from contemporary accounts, however, we also have a remake from 1945 that has survived, with Rellys (as Mimile) in the lead role rather than Georges Milton (as Bouboule), and since it works with roughly the same scenario as the 1930 film (but was far less successful), we can assume a reasonable similarity.\n\n16.

See his memoirs, Le Film de ma vie.\n\n28\n\nFrench Cinema—A Critical Filmography\n\nBouboule is a trickster figure straight out of vaudeville. Like so many popular characters in the early 1930s, he is a street singer, strolling through Montmartre with his mate and a small band, singing and selling their songs. Again like many contemporary popular figures, he is a master of disguise, passing himself off first as a baron, in order to impress a pretty girl. The consequent need to squire her to various elegant events while avoiding the outlay of nonexistent cash constitutes a central, ongoing joke. He bets on the wrong horse by mistake, but it wins; he bets on a boxing match but loses when his discarded apple-core rings the bell; he avoids paying for a lavish meal by anonymously telephoning the chef with the news that he and his party are government food inspectors who must on no account see the cost of the meal; he gets chucked out of one venue by the administrator who is forever hounding him, then impersonates a higher official and has that administrator chucked out in turn. His trickster characteristics are further in demand when he needs to get into the beauty parlor where his girl works. He pretends to be a plumber, bursting in on various women in states of undress, then to get out has to disguise himself in discarded female clothes, at the risk of being subjected to breast-enhancement and depilatory treatments. His final rendezvous with her is at a rugby match, which he cons his way into by dressing in the team colors. Taken for the new team member, he rather lets the side down until an accidental injection of horse-dope triggers fantastic feats of physical prowess, and he is carried off in triumph by his teammates, having been instrumental in his side winning the game. Multiple transformations of persona have allowed him to cross both class and gender barriers, finally winning the day and, if not the girl, at least her stepmother. Working-class affection for sporting events ensures that four of the six episodes which constitute the narrative line of the film take place in sporting arenas—the races, a boxing match, a bicycle race, and a horserace track. Physical, raucous, boisterous, slightly risqué, at their best headlong and unstoppable, these popular vaudevilles embody a belief in working-class vitality. The scenario of this one was primarily due to René Pujol. Author of revues and vaudevilles for the Bordeaux theater since early in the century, Pujol moved to film with the advent of the talkie, and participated in no less than seventy-six films in the course of the 1930s. “He produces one of his Pujoleries every two months,” complained an exasperated Cinémonde reviewer in 1938.18 He wrote lyrics for the songs, and was involved in scripting thirty-nine films and directing twenty others, often to his own scripts. Nearly all were lighthearted romps— vaudevilles, military vaudevilles, and farces—often with well-known comedians such as Milton, Bach, Alibert, or his Bordelais compatriot Tichadel in the lead\n\n18. Peyrusse, Le Cinéma méridional, 72.\n\nThe Introduction of Sound\n\n29\n\nroles. Pujol participated in several films figuring later in this book, notably Théo­ dore et Cie (#24) and the Fernandel vehicle Tricoche et Cacolet (#80), both directed, as was this film, by Colombier, as well as Si j’étais le patron (#33) and the Tino Rossi vehicle Marinella. Milton, for whom he wrote this script, was short, plump, balding, bouncy, a clown, singer, and acrobat who came to the cinema from cabaret and music halls. A “resquilleur” is an uninvited guest, a gate-crasher, and he made that role his own in a number of films. He was so popular as Bouboule in this film that a sequel was inevitable—indeed four sequels: he returned as Bouboule in Le Roi du cirage (1931, also directed by Colombier); La Bande à Bouboule (1931) and Bouboule 1er, roi nègre (1933), both directed by Léon Mathot; and finally Prince Bouboule (1938). The first two of these figured in the top ten of the 1931–1932 season, but the latter two were progressively less successful, as the early taste for vaudeville faded during the decade. We can get some idea of Milton and his persona from the surviving film Le Comte Obligado (1934) in which he plays Antoine, an elevator operator who inherits a fortune. This provides the film an opportunity to explore various populist themes—the taxmen and lawyers, who steal most of the money; hangers-on who try to sting him but of course get stung instead; his faked elegance as the imaginary Count Obligado, which allows him to hobnob with rich snobs who are all too ready to offer him their (largely naked) wives in return for investment in their firms. Antoine rapidly gets tired of their slimy, upper-class ways and chases them from his apartment. He ends up winning the lottery and buying the fashion house where he had worked the elevator to give to his girl. Again, the essence of the plot is a lower-class character full of joie de vivre who, through ingenuity and luck, outwits his “betters” and promotes the values of the heart over the crass preference for money—but gets the money, too.\n\n6. La Petite Lise (Young Lisa) France, 1930, 84 min, b&w Dir Jean Grémillon; Prod Pathé-Natan; Scr Charles Spaak; Cinematog Jean Bachelet and René Colas; Music Roland-Manuel; Art dir Guy de Gastyne; Sound Antoine Archaimbaud; Act Nadia Sibirskaïa (Lise), Pierre Alcover (Berthier), Julien Bertheau (André), Alexandre Mihalesco (pawnbroker), Alex Bernard (customer), and Raymond Cordy. Jean Grémillon had a documentary background and had made two feature films during the silent period. He was better prepared than most for the advent\n\n30\n\nFrench Cinema—A Critical Filmography\n\nof sound, since he had studied at the Conservatorium under Vincent d’Indy, had been a violinist in film orchestras, and was to compose some of the music for his own films. Like René Clair, he was a proponent of the ambitious use of ambient sound, music, and dialogue to integrate sound and image tracks in a kind of operatic continuum, but unlike Clair, saw sound film as a totally new art form in which all the techniques learned during the silent period would need to be rethought.19 His initial sound film, La Petite Lise, was one of the first to be made by Pathé-Natan when Natan took it over on Pathé’s retirement in March 1929, and it was scripted by that great Belgian scriptwriter Charles Spaak (thirty-four films in the decade, including La Grande Illusion and most of his compatriot Jacques Feyder’s films). In it Grémillon exploited the newly introduced RCA photophone process to develop a number of ambitious sonorization procedures. The whole first “act” of the film is set in a French Guiana jail, where Berthier has been granted a reprieve for his bravery in recent events, so opts out of an escape planned by his fellow prisoners. The soundtrack begins before the titles, with a bass chord and a ticking sound that evolve as the images open into an African-themed chant. The prisoners are being herded back into prison. The babble of unsourced voices and snatches of phrase that follow accompanies their talk of Paris and of women (graffiti), their cooking an evening meal (smoky haze of light), their amusements (tracking camera from cards to dice to “coconut shy” at a man in a barrel), then finally erupts into an extremely moving chorus that covers the escape of the other prisoners. This is one of the masterpieces of early sound cinema, and an early foreshadowing of the poetic realism of the late 1930s. It was put to music by the composer Roland-Manuel, who was to write the music for several of the more ambitious 1930s films, notably La Bandera (#42) and L’Étrange Monsieur Victor (#77). He worked with the benefit of a meticulously timed score developed by Grémillon, which integrated all visual and aural elements of the film. The rest of the narrative is less innovative, more melodramatic, but never less than interesting: Berthier returns to Paris and gradually discovers that his daughter, Lise, has in his absence been forced into prostitution but is in love with André, an unemployed man who does not know of her dubious activities. In a desperate attempt to escape from poverty, she and André try to extort money from a (parodic) Jewish pawnbroker, in the course of which Lise accidentally kills him. At a dance hall, André resolves to confess to the crime to save Lise. Berthier realizes where events are leading him: it is he who must confess to the murder of the Jew, to save his daughter and her lover. At this point, a subjective “memory” 19. See Sellier, Jean Grémillon, 69.\n\nThe Introduction of Sound\n\n31\n\nsequence of the Cayenne prison is accompanied by the voice of the governor, ironically telling Berthier that he is now a free man. He thrusts his way through the dancing crowds and enters a police station. Through its window, soundlessly, we see him confessing to the crime, while the soundtrack is still filled with the hectic celebrations of the raucous dancing crowd. This is another early instance of a trope, already mentioned in connection with Prix de beauté, that became extremely popular with the more ambitious French scriptwriters and directors— the ironic contrast between public celebration and private despair. One thinks immediately of Hôtel du Nord (#89), Au Bonheur des dames, Lumière d’été, and Sor­ tilèges, but a dozen other noteworthy examples could be cited from the period 1930–1945, not least Baptiste’s desperate attempt to pursue Garance through the celebratory throng at the end of Les Enfants du paradis. As noted elsewhere, this trope often (though not always) serves to represent the people as a communal source of vitality—the only true source—but at the same time as individually doomed to a joyless destiny.20 Moreover, the dislocation of sound and image, as we see but do not hear Berthier’s false confession, reverses an earlier occasion when we hear but do not see, because of a half-closed door, Lise returning from an assignation to find her father installed in her flat (and momentarily mistaking him for a “client”). The details of this awkward encounter are left visually to our imagination. Earlier, during the escape scene, the camera had abandoned the central dramatic elements related to the escape in order to linger on prisoners lost in lonely thought. An analogous incident later in the film has the camera linger endlessly on Lise’s blank face, obliging us to reconstruct her bitter reflections on the accidental murder of the pawnbroker, with its inevitable consequences. Jean Robin was right to emphasize the power of the silences in this film.21 Grémillon conceived the musical sequences of his film in a symphonic way, contrapuntally, with the various sonorous elements interwoven and developed as in a fugue. But quite aside from these inventive technical strategies, La Petite Lise presents us in Berthier, as played by Pierre Alcover, with the first of those stolid, bulky working-class protagonists whose unbecoming if not downright ugly exterior belies his emotional integrity, and who is trapped by a seemingly inescapable social fatality into becoming or being treated as a criminal. The bestknown of the actors to play this type was of course to be Jean Gabin, whose trajectory can be followed in later entries in this filmography, but it is worth recog20.

Its social origin was, of course, the impoverishment of a large segment of the working class in the late 1920s and early 1930s: the stress of a life on the edge, where those one loves are forced into desperate measures to stay alive, make of working-class existence a trap for which the Cayenne prison stands as a metaphor. The trap is only underlined by the circularity of the narrative, which dooms Berthier to return to the jail where we first found him. As he confesses to the crime he has not committed, the camera tracks back from the window, and a bell tolls and reverberates, uncomfortably loudly. This film takes very seriously the link between poverty and criminality that had already been sketched in lightly in René Clair’s films. Two final senses in which this film foreshadows crucial themes of the next fifteen years are first, the almost incestuous obsession of a father with his daughter, which will be taken up later, and second, the willingness of a parent to sacrifice him- or herself for a child. The Depression and later the defeat by Germany produced in different ways a sense of guilt in the older generation: without actually having done anything wrong—indeed often because they have done precisely nothing—parents feel responsible for their offspring’s having to endure an unreasonably hard existence, and they sacrifice themselves in an attempt to mitigate that suffering. The film was totally unsuccessful with the public, which (combined no doubt with the fact that it had been approved behind his back, and involved the murder of a sordid Jew) so enraged Natan, himself of course a Jew, that he swore that Grémillon, notionally contracted long-term to his company, would never again work for him.22\n\n7.

L’Opéra de quat’sous was filmed in Germany in two versions, with the French cast featuring Florelle, Albert Préjean, and Gaston Modot. The practice of importing French actors to Germany, England, or America to make “French” films had been normal when French studios were not yet equipped for sound, but continued throughout the early 1930s for French versions of local films (see L’Étrange Monsieur Victor, #77). L’Opéra de quat’sous was the first of Georg-Wilhelm Pabst’s films to be so made. It was the second in what is sometimes called his pacifist, or more accurately “social,” trilogy, coming between Westfront 18 (Quatre de l’in­ fanterie) and Kameradschaft (La Tragédie de la mine). The first of the trilogy was a war film calculated to incite a detestation of all wars, while the last was set in a mine deep below the Franco-German frontier, where during a disaster, German miners come to the help of their French colleagues. Class sympathies are stronger than national rivalries, but after a brief period of fraternization, the grills come down once again and national differences are officially reasserted. Pabst’s principal preoccupations of the time have been summarized by Lee Atwell as “the transcendent value of love and friendship, a distrust of capitalism, of bourgeois values and of the establishment in general, and a strong moral obligation to oppose . . . armed conflict.”23 A quite different style of criticism of capitalism operates in L’Opéra de quat’sous, as does a quite different set of techniques from the relatively traditional narrative and critical practices operating in Pabst’s framing films. This is undoubtedly due to the fact that it was based on the work of Bertolt Brecht, whose fundamental principle was to intervene in all forms of bourgeois culture with a view to deconstructing them, and in doing so, to ensure that the spectators’ rational independence should be respected. They should not be emotionally manipulated by being invited to identify with characters in a psychodrama, but should be distanced from the material and allowed to consider it more objectively. To achieve this, Brecht used a number of techniques, some of which are apparent in this film:\n\n23. See Atwell, G­W Pabst.\n\n34\n\nFrench Cinema—A Critical Filmography\n\na A presenter intervenes from time to time to address the audience openly, as do the characters. a Any dramatic tension is undercut and dispersed by songs that comment on the state of play. Thus, initially a street-singer sings of Mackie the murderer, while Mackie himself listens, eyeing Polly Peachum. Eight further songs ensue, set to Kurt Weill’s astringent and unromantic music. a The reality of the characters is undercut by foregrounding from time to time dummies, mechanical humans, and mannequins. a The acting style aims not to construct “real” characters by way of interior development but rather to present “typical” characters in tableaux. What results is somewhat closer to a medieval morality play than to a popular entertainment. The story dates back to John Gay’s Beggar’s Opera of 1728. Mackie is a gang boss, fence, and womanizer who wins the heart of Polly, daughter of the beggars’ leader, Peachum. Mackie is in cahoots with the police chief, who drops in to congratulate him on his forthcoming marriage, but Peachum is outraged and tries to get Mackie arrested, threatening otherwise to turn his army of the poor, the blind, and the maimed on society. Mackie prudently disappears, leaving Polly in charge of his criminal empire; she proves remarkably adept. Her mother, Mrs. Peachum, is a brothel madam. One of her girls thinks of betraying Mackie, but eventually decides to warn him, and he escapes. Nevertheless, betrayed by his former lover, he is captured, and Mrs. Peachum has to arrange his escape. Polly’s “managerial staff” organize the beggars into a massive and irresistible throng that surges through the city streets, coming into confrontation with the crowds cheering a royal procession. Mackie and Peachum will henceforth collaborate; they offer the police chief, now discredited, a job in their business empire; they will use the newly recognized power of the poor to increase their own wealth. Basically the story involves a cynical view of capitalism as a form of thuggery, just as Gay’s original involved a cynical view of the court, likening it to a criminal conspiracy: the police chief is happily corrupt and readily manipulated by the crooks; everyone worships money, however criminal the source; and the poor are dupes, manipulated by their leaders for selfish purposes. Where normally in this decade it is the poor who move easily back and forth across the frontier between legality and illegality, it is here the rich who do so. At the wedding of\n\nThe Introduction of Sound\n\n35\n\nMackie and Polly, the thugs wear frockcoats, making them very clearly a parody of capitalists, and Polly’s entrepreneurial ability extends to founding a bank. As she says, “Why risk suffering the rigor of the law when we can exercise our profession under its protection?” During the march of the beggars, the poor carry banners saying, “We too were made by God in his image,” but the final shots see them dispersing desultorily, having achieved nothing. Nevertheless, those who have seen the original German film suggest that the much shorter French version softened its incisive, satirical edge, producing something more mellow, even lackluster. This is usually attributed to the different personae and acting style of the French cast.24 The film is often visually interesting, its nocturnal scenes and baroque clutter combining elements of expressionism and surrealism, but it is painfully slow-moving and all too successful in its aspirations toward coldness. Consequently it is hard to like, or more importantly, to admire. To some extent, this may be due to disagreements between Pabst and Brecht as to how the work should be adapted to the cinema.25 Brecht and Weill took legal proceedings against Nero Films because Pabst’s film betrayed their original, though they ultimately lost and had to pay costs. Still, in a detailed analysis, film critic Thomas Elsaesser convincingly argues that their main aim in suing was to demonstrate the contradiction between an auteurist cinema and commercial ownership (in neither of which, incidentally, Brecht believed). It was, therefore, primarily an opportunity for deconstructive grandstanding.26 Clearly the film was not expected to do well, since it opened in the Ursulines, a small art theater. Banned by the censors after its corporate presentation, supposedly because of the representation of the police (or, according to Georges Altman, because it was offensive to the British crown!), the film was re-released seven months later with the excision of a minute’s running time, long after the German version’s release and even the French version’s overseas release. To everyone’s surprise, it proved sufficiently attractive to draw audiences to the Ursulines and later the Pagode for about two years. Admittedly one of the large theaters would have accumulated the same number of spectators in just four weeks, screening throughout the day, yet the film’s continuous presence month after month in Parisian cinema programs made it an inescapable element of the cultural scene during 1932 and 1933. Incidentally, the German version was also\n\n24. See Icart, La Révolution du parlant, 407–408, quoting contemporary reviews. 25. Some of these problems may also be due to the fact that surviving prints are somewhat degraded. 26. Rentschler, The Films of G. W. Pabst, 103–115.\n\n36\n\nFrench Cinema—A Critical Filmography\n\n(after several ineffectual attacks) finally banned—in August 1933, by the Filmprufstelle (the German censorship authority). Barthélémy Amengual in his account of Pabst’s films implies that this was unnecessary: “So what if Hitler comes on the scene; the old queen will happily make him Chancellor. Mackie and his gang will provide the muscle. Peachum will organize concentration camps and furnaces for him. As the hand-organ player’s song says Revolt has retreated to the wings; it will remain hidden there a long time.”27\n\n8.

It is customary for critics to speak of Julien Duvivier as an honest craftsman, an artisan with a profound understanding of his “métier.” That he was always more than that is sufficiently attested by his first sound film, David Golder, which both dramatically and technically provides evidence of a mastery far exceeding this assessment. Moreover, contrary to received opinion, he was from the first a director fascinated by ideas, and his output reveals a consistently bleak view of humanity. This film lends itself to a reading as a bitter critique of his fellow citizens, seen as cynical and r"
