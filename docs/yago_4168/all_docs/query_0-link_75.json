        "text": "Dan Aykroyd returns as Ray, while Patton Oswalt joins the party While the Hell’s Kitchen Sewer Dragon is a formidable foe in the film, Garraka is the name of the main villain in the movie. ‘He’s the character with the horns in the latest trailer,’ explains Kenan. ‘Then there’s the Death Chill, which is the power that Garraka employs to stop whatever comes in his way. It begins with something we can all relate to. It’s that feeling of cold that we experience when we’re afraid of something. It’s that chill that makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck. Garraka can employ that same thermodynamic property to destroy us, so it starts with something grounded and relatable – and it grows into something expansive and world-threatening.’ In the eyes of Ernie Hudson, the treacherous new villain is a welcome addition to the movie franchise. ‘When I first read the script, I was relieved because this is a step in a bold new direction,’ the original Ghostbusters actor explains to TF. ‘We’ve all seen Gozer and the ghosts from the original movie before, but it’s great to see Gil and Jason come up with a whole new chapter for Frozen Empire. I was very happy to see there’s a way forward without having to try and redo something from the past.’ To counteract the terror of Garraka, it’s no coincidence that three actors with a heavy background in comedy were added to the cast. Kumail Nanjiani, Patton Oswalt and British comedian James Acaster all have significant roles in Frozen Empire – and all three characters were written with the actors in mind. ‘Ghostbusters is, was and always will be a comedy brand,’ Kenan tells us. ‘The first film was one of the funniest films of its time. That’s due in no small part to the brilliance of the comic actors who were cast in the movie. In expanding this world, Jason and I knew from the initial germination of the writing phase that there was room for new comic voices.’ PAUL RUDD The Marvel star on proton packs and KitKats What excites you the most about Frozen Empire? I’m excited to see the OGs in their ghostbusting suits. Honestly, it’s the biggest thrill to be in the room when they’re doing their thing. How heavy is a proton pack? Heavier than you think. It’s not the most comfortable thing. They started to set up these stands so that we could rest the packs easily while we were standing around with them on between takes. What do you make of the movie’s newcomers? Kumail, Patton and James are hilarious. They’re all smart and funny comedians – and big Ghostbusters fans. They are also really great guys, which is nice because it’s fun to hang out with nice, funny people. What’s James Acaster like? James is a great comedian and a real foodie, as we all know from his podcast. I went to a couple of restaurants with James while we were shooting. The places he took me to were delicious. How was the on-set catering? It was really good. Every day, they set out a table filled with all kinds of delicious chocolates and biscuits. They were always a temptation. What’s your favourite British chocolate bar? I’ve always loved a Crunchie and I’m a fan of the original KitKat. We have them here in the States, but they taste better there. It’s the chocolate. AT ‘By adding these three actors, there’s a real return to the original tone of Ghostbusters,’ explains Carrie Coon. ‘People forget the fact that the original movie was released before anyone was blending genres in the way that Ghostbusters blended genres. Annie Potts talks about reading the original script and thinking, “I’ve never read anything like this before.” It was a comedy. It was sci-fi. It was an adventure story, but it was also irreverent and a little bit raunchy. Making sure there are comedians involved in the story reminds us of the tone we’re trying to capture in this franchise. I think it’s a real return to that root. Plus, it’s also about passing the torch to these new people in the story.’ With talk of passing the torch forward, the future of the fiendish franchise becomes the next topic of conversation. Kenan and Reitman are executive producers of the upcoming Ghostbusters animated series on Netflix, but Sony has yet to reveal if any additional movies have been greenlit. Kenan is certainly open to more. ‘Jason and I really love Ghostbusters,’ he enthuses. ‘We love these characters and we would be really happy if audiences were down to keep going on adventures with them. If audiences feel this way, then we know what the next stories are going to be.’ Are the actors on board for more movies? ‘Absolutely,’ states Coon without a pause. ‘There’s something so thrilling about working on these movies, especially as a woman. We’re not often asked to participate in the adventure or the physical elements of movies like this. We’re often just on the sidelines, so to be thrown into the action has been a real thrill. On top of that… Well, it’s already going to be in my obituary, so I might as well lean in.’ Mckenna Grace is equally enthusiastic. ‘As heavy as those frickin’ proton packs are, I would gladly put one on again. The proton packs weigh around 40 pounds, but I’m fine with that because it’s been a dream come true to be part of this franchise. I love these films. I love getting to be a Ghostbuster. I mean, who are you gonna call? This guy! Me.’ GHOSTBUSTERS: FROZEN EMPIRE OPENS IN CINEMAS ON 22 MARCH. Director Gil Kenan on set with Mckenna Grace and Logan Kim Well, it wouldn’t be a Ghostbusters movie without Slimer… ‘To be in a Ghostbusters flight suit and driving the Ecto-1 was a real kick’ PAUL RUDD TOTALFILM.COM MARCH 2024 | TOTAL FILM | 51 GHOSTBUSTERS: FROZEN EMPIRE\n\n52 | TOTAL FILM | MARCH 2024 MAKING OF SUBSCRIBE AT TOTALFILM.COM/SUBS\n\nAFTER DAVID BENIOFF AND D.B. WEISS ENDED GAME OF THRONES, THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY TO GO: UP. AS THEY UNVEIL THE GENRE-SPLICING, CHINESEPENNED SCI-FI 3 BODY PROBLEM, TOTAL FILM MEETS THE SHOWRUNNERS AND CAST TO TALK ABOUT THE MOST BONKERS, BRAZEN SERIES OF THE YEAR. WORDS JAMES MOTTRAM hen HBO’s wildly popular Game of Thrones concluded in 2019, it left a fantasy-shaped hole in many people’s lives. But most of all, for the show’s creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. ‘We spent 13 wonderful years in the world of that show and wouldn’t trade them for anything,’ says Weiss, 52, speaking over Zoom from a rock-star looking room bedecked with electric guitars. ‘But we really wanted NETFLIX to do something that felt different in many, many ways.’ TOTALFILM.COM MARCH 2024 | TOTAL FILM | 53 3 BODY PROBLEM\n\nAmong other projects, they considered entering the Star Wars universe with The First Jedi, a story about how the Jedi Order came to be – until Lucasfilm nixed it. Yet sci-fi was to remain central to the show they settled on: 3 Body Problem, a hugely ambitious, nearunclassifiable genre-hopping hybrid based on the Chinese trilogy Remembrance of Earth’s Past by author Liu Cixin. It came via the suggestions of Netflix exec Peter Friedlander, who met with Weiss and Benioff over the summer of 2019 as the pair were inking a reported $200 million multi-year deal with the streamer. By their own admission, neither was that familiar with Liu’s work. ‘I think we were both dimly aware that Barack Obama had blurbed the first book, which seemed unusual that he would blurb a Chinese science-fiction novel,’ says a hoodie-sporting Benioff, 53. But the moment they read it, they were hooked, ‘which’, adds the showrunner, ‘is a big part of the reason we ended up at Netflix.’ Spreading out from the Chinese Cultural Revolution to the present day and beyond, it’s an invasion story like no other. An alien race, facing its own annihilation, has set its sights on Earth. The twist? They won’t arrive for 400 years. ‘If it takes them 400 years to get here, that means that for a long time the story isn’t nearly as much about them as it is about us and our reaction to them,’ says Weiss. ‘That I’d never really seen before. I don’t think any of us had. I love a lot of those stories, they’re really fun, but War of the Worlds… you’re walking down a street in Boston and a UFO pops out… and then it’s on. In Signs, they come from out of the sky, and then they’re here. It’s all about what do we do when they’re here. This is more about us than it is about them. At least initially.’ Joining Weiss and Benioff in this creative hive was Alexander Woo, a former writer-producer on True Blood. Adapting Liu’s physics-heavy trilogy – which begins with book one, The Three-Body Problem – was always going to be tough, he acknowledges. ‘One of the things that makes it so challenging is that the timelines of the trilogy are pretty crazy. All three do start in the rough present day. And [the] second, third books certainly go far, far, far into the future. So for our show, it made a lot of sense to have characters who are contemporaneous with each other all be there in Season 1, because they all exist in the same time period.’ RESEARCHERS, ASSEMBLE Central to the eight-episode first season is a group of physicists who come together under the command of a British intelligence chief named Wade (Liam Cunningham, who played Thrones’ Ser Davos Seaworth), as they brainstorm ways of defending Earth. Among them are Jin Cheng (Jess Hong), Saul Durand (Jovan Adepo), Auggie Salazar (Eiza González), Will Downing (Alex Sharp) and Jack Rooney (John Bradley), who has just sold his crisps-and-snack company for millions. Benedict Wong stars as Da Shi Producer/writer Alexander Woo on set Jovan Adepo as Saul Durand Zine Tseng as the younger Ye Wenjie Jess Hong plays Jin Cheng 54 | TOTAL FILM | MARCH 2024 MAKING OF SUBSCRIBE AT TOTALFILM.COM/SUBS\n\n‘Even though the majority of the cast are scientists, we are all not built in this cookie-cutter form of what a scientist is like, you know what I mean?’ says Adepo, who previously featured in another doomedhumanity tale, HBO drama The Leftovers. ‘We are all individuals, and we have our own backgrounds, our own personalities. And I think that you’re dealing with people having to come out of themselves as individuals in their day-to-day lives, having to come together to face this massive threat that we could never imagine facing.’ While Adepo calls his character ‘a regular guy [who] just happens to have a really, really extraordinary brain’, he’s not the only one. Talking up Jack Rooney, ‘He’s a working-class northern boy… like myself,’ explains Bradley, 35, who previously played fan favourite Samwell Tarly in Thrones. ‘He’s come from a council estate. And now he’s a physics graduate from Oxford University, super-intelligent, in an instinctive, streetwise way.’ Now, unlike his academic friends, he’s found entrepreneurial success. ‘So he’s living high on the hog. He’s loving his life… as a super-rich man-about-town.’ Although Benioff and Weiss did take inspiration from a character found in the books, they also based Rooney around Bradley. Not least the fact the character is named after former Manchester United footballer Wayne Rooney – with Bradley an ardent fan of the club. ‘John Bradley is one of the smartest people we’ve ever met,’ says Weiss. ‘Wherever his intelligence comes from, it’s not books. I think the book that John has read the most by far would be Wayne Rooney’s My Decade in the Premier League, which I think he’s read 10 times. He would sometimes subject other actors on Game of Thrones to readings.’ Rather than make the Rooney character a Man U fan, however, the showrunners cheekily decided to make him a devotee of rival club, Manchester City. ‘I really had to do a lot of research into what it’s like to be that kind of scumbag!’ chuckles Bradley. ‘It doesn’t come naturally to me, that kind of attitude.’ Cruelly, Bradley was even made to drive around in a Rolls-Royce SUV, which was painted in Man City blue. Sadly, the scene got cut. ‘I’m glad that a lot of my Man United-supporting pals won’t get the chance to see it!’ he adds, clearly relieved. Bradley aside, 3 Body Problem gave Benioff and Weiss the chance to reunite with several key Thrones alumni. Not just Liam Cunningham and Jonathan Pryce, who played the High Sparrow in Thrones and here is a cult leader trying to commune with the aliens. Behind the camera, Thrones’ casting director Nina Gold, production designer Deborah Riley, cinematographer Jonathan Freeman and director Jeremy Podeswa, who helms the final two episodes here, all return. Newcomers, meanwhile, include Hong Kong director Derek Tsang (Better Days), who set the tone by calling the shots on the first two eps. KEEPING IT UNREAL With the first season largely set in the UK (with some scenes in China, Panama and the US), the show was primarily filmed in Britain – with Shepperton Studios acting as the base for all the green-screen work for its spectacular VR moments. As Rooney soon discovers, he has been left a headset by this advanced alien civilisation, which allows him and Jin into a fully immersive world set in Tudor England – as a way of communicating with the invading forces.

It’s in the spectacular third episode where huge swathes of VR appear, all brilliantly marshalled by Andrew Stanton (the former Pixar stalwart who directed Finding Nemo and WALL·E). ‘He was the rare director who was not daunted by that,” says Woo, who was instrumental in securing the sought-after Stanton. ‘I was surprised [that we got him]. I mean, Finding Nemo was a movie that is going to be watched long after all of us are dead, as is WALL·E,’ says Weiss. ‘When he said he wanted to do the show, I was like, “Are you sure?” I just felt like he was just dropping a lottery ticket in our laps.’ Without spoiling, this episode also taps into Benioff’s irrational Thrones-inspired fear of horses. ‘By the time we got through the final season, I had grown terrified of horses. It was never a phobia I had in my childhood, but every time one of our actors was on one of those things, I was nervous,’ he says. ‘Honestly, by the end, I was just like, “I can’t get near these things.”’ Which might explain one remarkable, gravity-defying VFX sequence, when things go haywire in VR land. ‘The floating horse, which is shitting itself…’ laughs Benioff. ‘Hard to see. But if you frame through [the sequence] you’ll see...’ The episode also includes inspired cameos from ex-League of Gentlemen stars Mark Gatiss and Reece Shearsmith. ‘One of the great opportunities of shooting in the UK… it was a chance to get all our favourite British comedic actors in the show,’ says Woo, who also geeked out by casting Taskmaster favourite Phil Wang. And then there’s the mighty Adrian Edmondson, famed for playing the punk Vyvyan in student comedy The Young Ones, who features here in one of the most menacing – and dramatic – roles of his career as a scheming tech boss. ‘In college, we wore out our video tape of The Young Ones,’ recalls Weiss, ‘because we watched every episode until we couldn’t really watch them any more, because they were too grainy. So to meet Ade and to see what Ade brought in terms of straightforward, subtle, menacing, ‘ S H O O T I N G I N T H E U K . . .

I’ve logged many hours of Ade Edmondson viewing in my brain. And they had nothing to do with the excellent work that I was seeing on our set. They were of Vyvyan smashing his head through a wall!’ HIGHER LEARNING While Woo, Benioff and Weiss were getting their kicks from comedy, there was also serious work to be done. Keen to understand the physics behind the show, Adepo spoke to on-set consultants and even went to Oxford University to meet students of the discipline. ‘The brainpower just in a small classroom is incredible,’ he notes, admiringly. So did his understanding of this very taxing science improve at all? ‘Absolutely not!’ he laughs. ‘I could probably guess in a multiple-choice quiz certain aspects of high-level physics. But I dare not disrespect the students who put countless hours in studying to get their doctorates.’ The big fear was always whether you’d need a degree to unpick 3 Body Problem. ‘It’s not just sci-fi,’ Adepo says. ‘It’s not just drama. There is comedy in the show. It’s just complex storytelling.’ Bradley remembers when the teaser dropped last summer. ‘Mates were like, “I’ve never seen a trailer before where I know less about it now than I did before I saw the trailer.” Because there are parts in space [and] parts that seemed to be in the contemporary world. There’s 1960s China, there’s Tudor England, there’s Genghis Khan’s Mongolian dynasty. And a large part of that is the virtual-reality element of it. It just kicks the doors of possibility wide open.’ As Woo notes: ‘A lot of people did say, “Oh, I don’t know what this is about, but I really want to see it,” which was exactly the effect [we wanted].’ Indeed, one of the real pleasures of the show is just how unlike anything else around it is. ‘It was not immediately obvious how [the books] could be turned into a TV show,’ admits Benioff. ‘But we knew that it was different from anything else we’d encountered. Part of the attraction was like, “How the hell do we do this?” It was similar when we read [Thrones author] George R.R. Martin’s books for the first time, just thinking, “These books are incredible. But is it possible to do this as a TV series? Is it too big, too sprawling, too expensive?”’ Ask for references and Benioff admits they watched Stanley Kubrick’s landmark 2001: A Space Odyssey ‘repeatedly’. But there were other influential sci-fi texts, too. ‘Danny Boyle did that movie Sunshine, which had moments of that awe-and-wonder feeling,’ adds Weiss. ‘It’s not just about a monster chasing you and you need to get away. It’s the feeling of wonder that comes with great science fiction.’ He also cites Tarkovsky’s Solaris. ‘That’s, in many ways, very different from this, but in terms of the feeling it gives you internally… for me that was something I would sometimes be thinking about with this.’ So are Benioff and Weiss expecting another Throneslike phenomenon? ‘I mean, the odds are it was a oncein-a-lifetime thing. It’d be insane to expect that again. And we didn’t expect it the first time, to be honest,’ shrugs Weiss. ‘I think the hope for us, more than specific numbers or anything else, is that we’re able to get to the end of the show. That we’re able to tell the whole story… that means doing well enough that Netflix decides it’s worth their time to keep paying for the show.’ Adepo concurs. ‘I think that there’s more story to be told,’ he says. ‘I’m curious to see how we continue to deal with this threat.’ Unlike Thrones, which remains an ongoing literary series as Martin continues to chip away at sixth book The Winds of Winter, Liu’s story has a definite endgame. ‘The ending did influence [us] a lot,’ says Woo. ‘It was so effective.’ As you can imagine – that alien threat will eventually materialise. Or to use a Thrones analogy: winter is coming. Weiss grins. ‘They’re faster than winter.’ 3 BODY PROBLEM STREAMS ON NETFLIX FROM 21 MARCH. TRON 1982 The granddaddy of all VR movies, Tron sees Jeff Bridges’ software engineer Kevin Flynn sucked into a mainframe computer, where programs are living entities and the so-called Master Control Program is in charge. You can even jump on a Light Cycle for the deadliest racing game you’ll ever play. THE MATRIX 1999 Mankind has been enslaved by machine-like sentinels, as Keanu Reeves’ Neo and millions of others are left to slumber inside the Matrix, a shared simulated reality modelled on the world as it was in 1999. It’s not all bad, though: you can get a pretty good VR steak there. EXISTENZ 1999 Jennifer Jason Leigh’s game designer enters her own VR masterpiece in David Cronenberg’s prophetic look at simulation gaming. Set in a world where the game is accessed by UmbiCords that attach to bio-ports in players’ spines, it plays out like a deadly game of cat and mouse. READY PLAYER ONE 2018 Real life is drab and draining. So in Spielberg’s sci-fi everyone plugs into OASIS, a VR world where people adopt avatars, break the speed limit and look cool in bars. No wonder they stick around. ‘They stay because of all the things they can be,’ says Tye Sheridan’s DeLorean-driving Wade Watts. ALTERED CARBON 2018-2020 Another Netflix show, set in a world where consciousness can be transferred to different bodies. Those who are that way inclined can head to a VR café where they can play out any scenario they want – usually violent or sexually depraved acts. Torture is also on the menu. JM VIRTUAL INSANITY The best on-screen VR A fearful Jin and Jack Saul and Auggie await the existential threat NETFLIX TOTALFILM.COM MARCH 2024 | TOTAL FILM | 57 3 BODY PROBLEM\n\nhere is a moment near the beginning of Fallout 3 – the landmark 2008 action roleplaying game from Bethesda Games Studios – that is imprinted on anyone who experienced it at the time. In it, the player-created main character opens the exit to the subterranean vault they’ve called home for 19 years, and steps into the blinding light of the Wasteland for the first time, a literal world of potential stretching as far as the eye can see. ‘I was, right out of the gate, blown away,’ says Jonathan Nolan, the co-creator of HBO’s Westworld and co-writer of The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises, The Prestige and Interstellar, alongside big brother Chris. During a conversation with Total Film in early February, Nolan is reminiscing about ‘looking for a new distraction’ in late 2008, months after Ma^y=ZkdDgb`am hit cinemas, and being drawn to a copy of hot new thing Fallout 3. ‘I was obsessed with the game, and obsessed with the world of it,’ a visibly animated Nolan says over Zoom. ‘The ambition of it, and the mythology of it, and the sophistication of the world, and the gravitas of it. What really got to me, though [was] the weirdness of it, and the gonzo, satirical, impossible-to-place tone of this thing. You very seldom see anything like this.’ Contradiction is at the heart of Fallout. Take that first in-game glimpse of the open world. The paradox of this moment is that, for all the freedom it promises, everything in front of you is extremely dead. The toxic landscape is dotted with the decrepit relics of a once-thriving civilisation, some two centuries after a nuclear judgement day has driven the haves underground and left the have-nots to fend for themselves on the surface with irradiated cockroaches the size of house cats and even more monstrous mutants. Life is as grim as it gets in the Wasteland, yet the tone of Fallout is anything but. Nolan describes the series as ‘closer to comedy’ than anything he and Lisa Joy have made to date. Leaning into Fallout’s contradictions, Nolan and Joy, who were still working on Westworld while initially developing Fallout in 2019, made the unusual decision to hire a pair of showrunners with wildly divergent backgrounds: Geneva Robertson-Dworet (Captain Marvel, Tomb Raider) and Graham Wagner (Silicon Valley, The Office). ‘Geneva comes from the comic-book world like me, whereas Graham comes from comedy,’ Nolan points out. ‘That was kind of the approach – a little bit of IN VIDEO-GAME ADAPTATION FALLOUT, THE END OF THE WORLD IS ONLY THE START OF THE FUN.

Much of Fallout’s humour comes from its deeply embedded critique of consumer corporatism. The Wasteland is littered with the retro-futuristic detritus of mega-corporations like Vault-Tec, and its grinning mascot Vault Boy, who is often glimpsed giving a big, incongruous thumbs-up. ‘There’s all this branded stuff,’ Robertson-Dworet says. ‘And it seems to imply that whatever brought the world to the end was the hyper-corporatisation of that pre-war society.’ ‘It’s given us a fair bit of joy to be able to do that on Amazon Prime Video,’ adds Wagner, with a chuckle. ‘That is the paradox of America.’ GAME CHANGER Fallout has arrived at a fascinating moment for video-game adaptations. Once the subject of a decadeslong ‘curse’, preconceptions that game-based movies and TV shows are likely to fail were well and truly upended by HBO’s acclaimed adaptation of The Last of Us a year ago. ‘Now there’s an expectation of: “No, they can actually be great. I watched some good ones,”’ says Wagner with a smile. ‘In a perverse way, I wish there was more snobbery so that we could have been the first!’ Both may be violent stories set in a post-apocalyptic America, featuring zombie-adjacent creatures, but the comparisons between TLOU and Fallout end there. Most significantly, while the former faithfully (some might say slavishly) replicates the game’s narrative on screen, Fallout is telling an original story in a new location for the series – Los Angeles – but all set in the same canonical American Wasteland as the games. ‘From the first conversation with Todd [Howard, game director of Fallout 3 & 4, and an executive producer on the show] we were most excited about an original story,’ says Nolan. ‘Fallout, in my career, is closest to the work we did in adapting Batman, where there’s so much storytelling in the Batman universe that there is no canonical version of it, so you’re free to invent your own. Each of the [Fallout] games is a discrete story – different city, distinct protagonist – within the same mythology. Our series Ella Purnell’s Lucy quickly learns that life on the surface isn’t everything she had believed sits in relation to the games as the games sit in relation to each other. It’s almost like we’re Fallout 5. I don’t want to sound presumptuous, but it’s just a noninteractive version of it, right?’ With a typical playthrough of Fallout 3 or its 2015 sequel, Fallout 4, taking upwards of 100 hours, and players afforded the freedom to engage with as little or as much of the world and its wacky inhabitants as they want, the challenge was ‘how do we evoke all the great parts of Fallout efficiently, and in a way that is meaningful to us?’ according to Wagner. ‘By telling an original story, we felt like we could welcome people who weren’t familiar with the games to the key tenets of a Fallout storyline,’ adds Robertson-Dworet. ‘Which are: a Vault-dweller going to the surface for the first time, and having their morality challenged; exploring the Power Armour through the Brotherhood of Steel; and The Ghouls, who are the most Walton Goggins as The Ghoul, a centuriesold mercenary ‘ T H E A P P R O A C H [ W A S ] A L I T T L E B I T O F D AV I D L E A N , A N D A L I T T L E B I T O F S T R A I G H T COMEDY’ JONATHAN NOLAN JOJO WHILDEN/PRIME VIDEO ©AMAZON CONTENT SERVICES LLC SUBSCRIBE AT TOTALFILM.COM/SUBS MAKING OF\n\nJonathan Nolan directed the first three episodes of the series Michael Emerson (centre) is scientist Wilzig, being tracked by The Ghoul benighted of all the people on the surface. So we wanted to look out for them, and, in fact, put our favourite actor of all time, Walton Goggins, into that role.’ GHOUL & THE GANG Goggins doesn’t have just a role; in fact, he has two. We first meet him as Cooper Howard – a down-on-his-luck former western star, who is the entertainment at a kids’ party on the day the nukes detonate and change the world of Fallout forever. Howard features throughout the show in flashbacks that will expand on how, 219 years later, he has become The Ghoul – a necrotic, gunslinging mercenary whose life has been indefinitely prolonged by exposure to radiation and a cocktail of chemicals that keep him from turning feral. A standout supporting player in The Shield, Justified and two Tarantino westerns, but with criminally few leading roles to his name, Goggins admits to having no idea TOTALFILM.COM MARCH 2024 | TOTAL FILM | 61\n\nwhat Fallout was initially. ‘All I needed to know was that Jonathan and Lisa were behind it,’ he nods. ‘Then they started describing the character. And I was like, “Really? So I don’t have any hair? I’ve been walking in a Wasteland for 200 years? OK!”’ In order to portray The Ghoul, Goggins spent an hour and 45 minutes having a deceptively thin prosthetic headpiece applied every morning, undergoing a radical transformation into a character he describes as ‘the good, the bad and the ugly’ rolled into one. ‘What we kept coming back to was that we wanted the audience to not be repulsed by the visual of The Ghoul; but, rather, to lean into it, and to look at his face, and to become obsessed with it,’ Goggins says. ‘And to make him sexy, on some level. To make him irresistible.’ Certainly, The Ghoul has a swagger and a confidence in his capabilities that make him cool, calm and collected, even when drastically outnumbered in a gunfight. Goggins turned to numerous iconic western stars for inspiration: Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, James Coburn, Alan Ladd, James Arness, Paul Newman, but in particular, ‘I really, really watched, over and over again, Henry Fonda in Once upon a Time in the West, and the way in which his energy comes into the room before he does. The way he moves with very little effort, and he never really speaks above a whisper.’ The Ghoul is hired to track down Wilzig (Michael Emerson), a scientist with a valuable secret in his head, causing him to cross paths with Ella Purnell’s former Vault-dweller Lucy and Aaron Moten’s Brotherhood of Steel squire Maximus, who make up the cast’s interconnected core trio. When we meet Lucy, a life-long resident of Vault 33, her father, Hank (Kyle MacLachlan) has arranged for her to be married to a suitor from Vault 32. Her destiny as a wife and mother is about to unfold exactly as she’s always been told it will. ‘Lucy is highly trained and smart, and is this A1 put-together type,’ Purnell says. ‘She truly is a good person, and believes in the Golden Rule, and that her children’s children will go to the surface one day, and rebuild America. She believes in doing her duty, and procreating, and creating the future. And then through a series of unfortunate events, she ends up going to the surface and leaving the Vault, and finding that may not be entirely true.’ On the surface, Lucy quickly learns that morality is a privilege. ‘Lucy is able to be this noble person back in her Vault, because she’s never wanted for anything,’ Robertson-Dworet says, ‘And as soon as she’s on the surface, every decision becomes a lot harder.’ That’s certainly true for Maximus, a member of the The Ghoul started out as a western actor, before radiation deformed his body and prolonged his life The Brotherhood of Steel seeks out pre-war technology ‘ W E ’ V E B A R E LY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE O F T H E F A L L O U T UNIVERSE’ GRAHAM WAGNER 62 | TOTAL FILM | MARCH 2024 SUBSCRIBE AT TOTALFILM.COM/SUBS\n\nquasi-religious Brotherhood of Steel – a technocratic paramilitary order whose primary aim is to locate, preserve and regulate pre-war technology. This is achieved through the use of Power Armour (see boxout, right), metal suits that turn Brotherhood Knights into walking tanks. ‘They usually use violent means in order to achieve their goals,’ says soft-spoken Moten. ‘Maximus enters as a young initiate, and is hoping to rise in the ranks of the Brotherhood.’ Max is a squire, tasked with carrying his Knight’s oversized bag into battle and, er, polishing his codpiece. But it’s all in aid of something greater than himself, Max dedicating his life to the order after being saved by the Brotherhood as a child. ‘He wants to be a hero,’ Wagner says. ‘He wants to be chivalrous. But he finds out that the Brotherhood is not quite what it seems. And so the question is: how can he actually live up to his ideals if the institution that he’s part of is so problematic?’ ARMOUR WARS Incredibly, the Brotherhood’s Power Armour was a practical costume, worn by stunt performer Adam Shippey. ‘I’ve learned this with my brother, and with all the projects that we’ve worked on over the years – it’s always better if you can make it real,’ notes Nolan, who currently has a suit of Power Armour sitting in his garage. ‘We stole a trick from the original Alien. The Xenomorph [costume] was built around one terrifically talented performer, who had a very unique build, which allowed them to sculpt the suit in such a way that it doesn’t feel like there’s a person there. Even then, I still imagined that we would have to use a bit of trickery and replace the suit with CG in a lot of places, but 99% of what you’re seeing is Adam walking around in that suit.’ For the cast, the suit was a special effect whose impact never waned. ‘It’s one of those things where you needed someone to tell you to close your mouth,’ says Moten. ‘You’re just gaping at this thing. And the way that you see people behave – whether it’s background actors or our crew – everyone needs to move out of the way.’ ‘I remember there was one point where he took a couple of fast steps towards me,’ adds Purnell. ‘I backed up off my mark and was completely out of focus, because that’s your gut reaction to this robot transformerlooking dude who’s humungous.’ Nolan himself directed the first three episodes, shooting primarily on location on the Skeleton Coast of Namibia and the Western Salt Lakes of Utah to capture a sense of the games’ ‘beauty and scope’, while staying uncompromisingly true to the series’ outrageously OTT violence (‘It’s definitely a hallmark of the game that we knew we had to translate into the series’). He also thought deeply about how to replicate the experience of playing the game in a passive medium. ‘The way in which you interact with these games, there’s as much cultural anthropology as there is violence,’ he explains. ‘You’re sifting through the leavings of a world that has been destroyed. To take that freedom and eliminate it as a filmmaker is intimidating. You’re taking away interactivity, and you’re replacing it with intentionality, which is exciting. I think that’s why there’s a place for adapting video games.’ Certainly, everyone involved is excited enough by what they’ve made that no one is ruling out a return to the Wasteland. ‘It’s an uncertain time in television. So the art form of season finales has become: provide enough closure, but leave the door open for more,’ Wagner admits. ‘But we feel we’ve barely scratched the surface of the Fallout universe. We literally have documents and documents of stuff that we’re, in success, eager to dig into. Our fingers are crossed that we’re going to get the opportunity to do all that stuff.’ FALLOUT STREAMS ON PRIME VIDEO FROM 12 APRIL. Knights of the Brotherhood of Steel wear heavy-duty suits of Power Armour Jonathan Nolan with Ella Purnell on location SUIT CASE How Fallout’s practical Power Armour was made. ‘The first meeting was so exciting,’ says costume designer Amy Westcott. ‘I was like, “This is great! This is great!” And then I started thinking, “Oh my God, this is petrifying!” The Power Armour was a collaboration with props, the art department, and then they made them out in LA. These phenomenal makers – Legacy – made all the pieces. We made sure that the performer wasn’t going to die underneath them ?in the heatA. It was a lot of collaboration in getting them on, also just so that the actors and the stunt players would actually be able to work in them. And there were under-layers that you had to see, and that had to make sense for the characters. Thec&rotherhood was so massiZe and epic that it was a lot of crossoZer with us and the art department and props to make that whole group. That whole army, I should say. And, for me, the chance to get to build a world like this is so rare. EZerything was not only made, but completely altered and touched and aged and distressed. God, the scale of it was just huge. It was a great experience that is super rare.’ JF MARCH 2024 | TOTAL FILM | 63 FALLOUT\n\n64 | TOTAL FILM | MARCH 2024 MAKING OF SUBSCRIBE AT TOTALFILM.COM/SUBS\n\nAfter a scorching debut with Saint Maud, filmmaker Rose Glass returns with a horny, brawny, magicalrealist tale of romance, regret and ’roids with Love Lies Bleeding. She and her cast tell Total Film about making a ‘strong woman’ story with a twist… WORDS JANE CROWTHER TOTALFILM.COM MARCH 2024 | TOTAL FILM | 65 LOVE LIES BLEEDING\n\nLIONSGATE/A24 risten Stewart is telling Total Film about the appeal of her new movie, Love Lies Bleeding, and her description doesn’t pull any punches. ‘There was something so nice about the nightmare fantasy of, you know, throat-fucking your evil dad with your girlfriend, and running off into the clouds,’ chuckles Stewart over Zoom from her LA home as her dog, Cole, barks up a storm. It’s days after the first of two films starring the actor has bowed at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival and Stewart, back in LA to shoot the cover of Rolling Stone, is trying to describe the allure of Rose Glass’ heightened-reality crime thriller; a film that promises to make audiences blanch as much as Maud’s thumb tacks in shoes. It’s a tale that includes bug eating, fingering, poo fishing, monstrous evolution and a luridly violent scene that is literally jaw-dropping. ‘She creates a vibe, doesn’t she?’ Stewart asks with admiration. ‘She really does know how to build something – an entire world to immerse yourself in.’ Certainly, Glass made windswept Scarborough a creepy, foreboding location for a cautionary narrative of frenzy, infatuation and the fearsome power of driven women in Saint Maud. Stewart saw the 2020 lockdown hit and knew she wanted to work with its creator. ‘We’ve really just started to allow women to make films in the scheme of things, if you really zoom out. We’re not encouraged to make icky things. It’s like, everyone needs to fill their marginal-content quota with affirmations or something. Rose definitely didn’t feel inclined to be affected by that pressure. It was almost like it pushed her in a different and new direction. I was like, “Fuck, this person has got it.”’ British director Glass is too humble to name-drop the numerous stars, directors and producers who reached out to her in the wake of her fiery calling card (‘I had some very surreal Zooms – “Oh, this very famous person is on my laptop”’) but she was keen to try a new process with her second film. ‘I took the decision to take [the success of Saint Maud] as a liberating thing and a springboard to leap wholeheartedly and confidently into something and not think too much about it, because otherwise probably that’s when the terror sinks in,’ Glass says, now sporting cropped hair that makes her look (perhaps fittingly) like Mia Farrow in Rosemary’s Baby. ‘Writing Saint Maud by myself was a quite an isolating, stressful experience. As much as I’m happy with how it turned out, I think going into this next one, I was maybe nervous about getting back into that again. So I knew I wanted to co-write, and wanted to have fun doing it.’ Teaming up with writer-director Weronika Tofilska, whom she went to a film school with, Glass began to explore the story of an 80s female bodybuilder who might spin out of control as she prepped for competition. ‘I went to [Tofilska] with a really embryonic version of what then became Love Lies Bleeding, and we just spent several months locked up in a room together, brainstorming, mapping out the story, and just seeing where it went – trying to make each other laugh and surprise each other. I knew what I wanted the tone to be, and the world, which was something quite pulpy, darkly comic and violent. People behaving badly and making terrible life decisions. A romance that sort of goes spectacularly wrong – or right, depending on how you look at it.’ FLEX AND VIOLENCE That romance, then, is the instant attraction that ignites between quiet gym manager Lou (Stewart) and musclebulging drifter Jackie (Katy O’Brian) in a dusty 80s Albuquerque crossroads town. Lou, tamped down by family trauma (dad played by Ed Harris, sis by Jena Malone, rat-tailed brother-in-law by Dave Franco) and fishing turds out of the abused gym loos, experiences love at first sight when confident, sexy Jackie prowls into the weights area. Jackie is on her way to hoped-for bodybuilding stardom in Vegas and will do anything to transform, even if that means losing her head. And though the women get hot and heavy immediately, their burgeoning love is threatened by the local mob and a crime of passion. There are guns, steroids, rock canyons and a lot of cleaning bleach involved… ‘I liked exploring the qualities that somebody who does bodybuilding would have to possess, and the different ways they had the potential to be misguided or manipulated or abused by other people in their life – Jackie’s got all this strength, energy and drive,’ says Glass. ‘There are parallels between Jackie’s character and Maud. They’re both trying to transform themselves, and arguably not in the most responsible ways.’ ‘ I K N E W I W A N T E D T H E T O N E T O B E Q U I T E P U L P Y, D A R K LY C O M I C A N D VIOLENT’ ROSE GLASS Katy O’Brian as Jackie and Kristen Stewart as Lou Anna Baryshnikov stars as Daisy 66 | TOTAL FILM | MARCH 2024 MAKING OF SUBSCRIBE AT TOTALFILM.COM/SUBS\n\nNo spoilers here, but let’s just say that Jackie hulks out in prep for her spotlight in Las Vegas… And throughout the writing process, Glass had one actor in mind to embody skittish Lou. ‘Kristen was the dream casting for that role, while the script was still being written, and before we had financiers on board. Obviously, you’re going through the exercise of imagining, “If she says no, who would we go for?” I was very nervous and I was very glad that she said yes, because I’m not sure what we would have done otherwise.’ The concept intrigued Stewart. ‘When [Glass] told me the idea for her follow-up film, I was really scared to touch it,’ the actor admits. ‘I didn’t want to let her down. ‘She told me that she had been feeling the effects of all the many conversations that happened in the wake of such an incredible first film. She was like, “Yeah, everyone’s like, ‘Make a movie about a strong woman, a strong lady. Blah blah blah blah.’ So I wrote a movie about a really strong lady.” I just thought it was kind of petulant and hilarious and exactly what I wanted to do even before I read the script. And when I read it, I was so impressed. It’s just so many different things that don’t normally go together. I mean, technically, on paper, it’s a crime thriller. She posits life and violence, but small violences – the little things that make Lou hardened. I loved the movie because I loved Lou so much, and I really vouched for her, and I really wanted her to be a good guy – but things just aren’t that simple.’ With Lou taken care of, Glass had to find her Jackie, a task she initially thought would be a ‘discovery’ role for an untested athlete. ‘That’s quite difficult, it turns out,’ the writer-director laughs. ‘We saw a lot of tapes. There’s obviously a little bit of pressure at times to go for a more famous actor, and get them to transform and get into shape. It would take months and months, which we didn’t have, and then you start having really weird conversations about: “Maybe body doubles and CGI?” Then quite close to the beginning of production we got one of Katy’s tapes. And it was just like, “Thank God. I think we’ve found her.”’ O’Brian had an athletic and martial-arts background but had been acting in projects such as The Mandalorian and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. She recognised Jackie immediately: ‘I just knew that it was about a queer bodybuilder. I was like, “Well, I’ve done bodybuilding competitions. I know that. She’s from the Midwest. I’m from the Midwest. And we’re both queer. So, cool.” I fell in love with it right away, and I was like, “I have to get this part.” I thought I have to do it even more, because I have to A) show people that I’m a serious actor, but B) this is the kind of art that I’ve wanted to make for so long and have not had the opportunities to do.’ She aced numerous auditions and a key chemistry read with Stewart, booking the role only weeks before production. Though it shouldn’t be noteworthy, it meant that a queer story would be told by queer actors. ‘The authenticity is going to be there when you’ve both had those experiences,’ O’Brian nods over Zoom, her wife moving around their house in the background. ‘I’ve worked with a girl who was straight and we were supposed to do a kissing scene. She was so thoroughly uncomfortable with the concept, or the idea, of touching me that it made me feel gross. So getting to work with someone who’s also queer, who doesn’t find the idea of being with a woman disgusting, it was a relief. And you have an unspoken understanding of what this is like. But I love that this isn’t a story about us coming out. It’s not a story where she’s with a man, and I take her away. It’s a story about two women who fall in love, and that’s it.’ Casting Stewart and O’Brian also allowed the actors to subvert their own on-screen personas, according to O’Brian. ‘Kristen’s gotten to play these really typically feminine characters. And with Lou, she’s more macho. She’s playing it tough, but is also really awkward and quirky. And I – who always has to play these military characters – get to play this nomad who comes out of nowhere. She’s sexy and she knows it – I never get to do that. So that was a lot of fun, because we were actually seeing parts of ourselves that people don’t generally cast us for.’ With only two weeks to get in shape before principle photography, O’Brian hit the gym with a trainer (‘My strength training was very film-focused, concentrating on where the camera catches light – so a lot of upperpectoral muscle, a lot of abs’), threw herself into ‘GETTING TO WORK WITH SOMEONE WHO IS ALSO Q U E E R , W H O D O E S N ’ T F I N D T H E I D E A O F B E I N G WITH A WOMAN DISGUSTING, WAS A RELIEF’ KATY O’BRIAN Ed Harris stars as Lou’s father, Lou Sr Dave Franco plays Lou’s brother-in-law, J.J.

Stewart collaborated with Glass and costume designer Olga Mill to create a skeevy-sexy look for Lou – all oversized T-shirts, mullet hair and sneakers. ‘We started off thinking that Lou would be in boots and maybe a leather belt,’ Stewart says. ‘I was like, “Lou’s a teenie guy. Lou’s a soft-shoe guy.” You can tell [Mill] the tiniest little things that maybe don’t even have detail, and she’s able to interpret it. And something about her colour choices… It’s so “come in for milk and cookies, but then get face-fucked…”’ she laughs. Together, the trifecta of Glass, Stewart and O’Brian created a realistic romance with one foot firmly in heightened reality. ‘[Glass is] willing to use her script as a diving board. She was sculpting a feeling, a sort of energy and momentum,’ recalls Stewart. ‘Some directors are like surgeons and some are a little more ephemeral. Rose is definitely able to modulate in real time. You’re not always aware of how that’s going to end up. I just felt like such a partner – anything she needed, I just wanted to hand it to her. I didn’t need to always know what was going on, because I genuinely trusted her implicitly.’ ‘ I T ’ S N O T T H AT G R A P H I C . . .

In one moment, a character is brutalised in a horribly funny way, gore (and teeth) flying – which left Sundance audiences gasping. The same could be said of hot, horny scenes of oral sex, where Lou asks Jackie to show her how she masturbates. ‘I wanted the film to be really pulpy, melodramatic, visceral and there would probably be a lot of sex and violence in it,’ says Glass. ‘But, at the same time, I basically wanted to make the most fun film that I could. It’s all done with a pretty light touch. And the world that the film takes place in, it’s got a foot in reality but it’s definitely got a foot up in the clouds somewhere else. It sort of means that you’re able to lean into the more operatic qualities of gruesome, juicy violence, which in filmmaking is just a lot of fun. Subtlety is not the quality at the forefront of many things in the film.’ WHAM, BAM, THANK YOU, MA’AMS Though Stewart had been quoted during Sundance saying that the sauce in the movie might shock some, she’s keen to point out that she doesn’t think it’s actually shocking. ‘In print, that looks so different, because I was laughing when I said that. It will shock the pearlclutchers. It’s not that graphic. It’s just that when you talk about a woman’s body, when you start talking about the orifice, people start squirming. [The sex scenes are done] in a really good, tasty way. You don’t see anything. I think you see [O’Brian’s] tits once. You see mine for a split-second. But I think it’s the verbiage. We talk about each other. We actually acknowledge what’s happening, versus burying a head under a bustle.’ The whole experience impressed Stewart, not least working with O’Brian, a relative newbie compared with her own two-decade career. ‘Something Katy brought that wasn’t necessarily in the script was a deep sweetness, and it makes it fucking weird. I was impressed MONSTERS VS ALIENS Susan is a sweet girl until a meteor hits her on her wedding day, then turns her the size of a skyscraper. You’re literally something on the bottom of her shoe. MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND G-Girl has superpowers that make her a great mate, until she’s dumped by her feckless boyfriend – a powerful, vengeful former flame. Don’t piss off a supe. WANDAVISION Wanda is a model wife to Vision, until she recalls the real reason for her creating their world. Then all hell breaks loose. Well, what is grief if not love persevering? ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN Wealthy socialite grows gargantuan and goes after her philandering, murderous ex-hubby for revenge. You do you, Nancy. And in a makeshift bikini bedsheet. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN Pre-teen first love is cute, right? Holding hands, chatting by the swings. Ripping off hands, sucking blood, swinging from the rafters… JC with her gall. Because when I first started, I was a kid. I was malleable. She’s fully formed. She’s a fucking grown-up and that can be so much scarier, to trust it all at that age, when you aren’t used to it. I think she killed it.’ Glass agrees, thrilled with the way the two women crafted a cinematic relationship that wrong-foots audiences and each other. But amid the many takeaways on offer (guilt, trauma, ambition, steroid abuse, daddy issues, breaking bad habits), she’s reluctant to tag what the overriding theme of the piece truly is. ‘I don’t want to put anything into people’s heads. If nothing else, it’s about how difficult it is to quit smoking,’ she smiles. For O’Brian, the movie explores the beauty of life glinting in the filth. ‘The film is surrounding us with disgusting situations, and the only thing that really comes in as beautiful is our [characters’] love, or how we’re looking at each other. We’re in this shithole and we’re looking at each other. That’s what’s good about it.’ Stewart sighs as she tries to parse her thoughts. ‘I think it’s about the stories we tell ourselves to get us through. None of them are true and all of them are true – and everyone is having a different experience. The thing that drives it usually is a beating heart. That can lead you to very dangerous and very beautiful and stunning places…’ LOVE LIES BLEEDING OPENS IN CINEMAS ON 3 MAY. ‘ T H E W O R L D I T TA K E S P L A C E I N . . .

After doing classic Brit TV staples (The Bill, Holby City), O’Connell showed early promise in the likes of This Is England and Eden Lake. Born in Derbyshire in 1990 to an Irish father and English mother, O’Connell almost pursued a career in football before he found drama, his working-class roots making him something of a rarity in the British acting scene.

And he’s got no plans to slow down now. ‘I’m 33,’ he says. ‘A lot of my favourite actors were turning in their best work at my age. If that applies to me, that’s something to be excited about.

And hopefully I never stop, you know?’ Amy Winehouse and Blake FielderCivil’s lives played out across the tabloids, who were reporting on their every move. What are your memories of that time? I just remember it feeling very ruthless, and that there was almost an acceptance in the public that that level of intrusion was OK. I think we’ve learned by now that it’s not. I like to think that by now we have a olwwoh#elw#ri#d#glļhuhqw#dwwlwxgh#lq#krz#zh# respect people’s privacy, albeit if they’re in the public eye or not. I don’t think Amy signed up to that level of harassment. I don’t think Blake did either. It’s something I do have quite an opinion on. I guess it is a real negative by-product of the success that she had. How did Sam Taylor-Johnson pitch her take on this to you? The fact that it was written by Matthew Greenhalgh [Ghpa^k^;hr, Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool] was a massive draw. I love Matthew’s scripts. I think he’s one of the best writers in the country. He’s a friend. It was that, basically. [Sam] just told me that it was me she had in mind for Blake, and she hadn’t really considered anyone else for it. I had to go away and think about it, naturally. And then I jumped on as part of wkh#surfhvv/#dqg#L#jrw#lqyroyhg#lq#Ľqglqj# Amy. So I was around for chemistry reads and auditions, if you will.

Even as [recently] as watching the trailers that [just came out]. I’ve seen wkh#Ľop/#dqg#vr#L#zdv#h{shulhqflqj#wkdw#d# lot, watching Marisa’s performance. It’s been one of the biggest thrills of my career, to watch her go about her work, and adopt this role, and put the amount of graft that needed to take place on her part in order to get this right. I just feel like she’s come from such a place of understanding that it’s really allowed her to do something really phenomenal. It was a wild, wild thrill to watch her go about her work. Did you have any hesitation about playing someone from such a recent moment in history? I guess so. I mean, we’re talking 20 years on. It’s still historical in that sense. It’s surprising because obviously I have lived experience of that time. That’s quite unique. I suppose the added pressure of Blake… obviously, Blake’s still around. So, naturally, there was that. It was important to me to get on a level with him. But, I feel a lot of nostalgia for this period, and it was great to bring that to the work. I’m younger than Blake, but I remember this time. I remember Camden then. I remember the music then. I remember the fashion. It was cool to be from around there. The music that was coming out of that scene was amazing. It’s still amazing today. It was amazing to apply some lived experience to the role. What was it like meeting Blake? The meeting initially for me was not to go in and study him, because I think I was just going to be guided by the writing, and guided by what’s available of him out there. In terms of how he sounds tonally, and dialect, etc – that’s all out there. I think one thing that was eye-opening to me was how much I got on with him, and how much I felt I could relate to him. Obviously, I didn’t have any preconceived notion that that would be the case, but I came away from the meeting just feeling like he was the type of geezer that I’d already met, or the type of fella that I already knew anyway.

Does that change your approach at all, compared zlwk#d#Ľfwlrqdo#fkdudfwhuB I’d like to think it was still the same. You’re still diligent. There is still that want and hunger to get it right, and the want to study, or what have you. I suppose it all depends on how much you feel the public already know about the original, and whether that sort of limits what licence you have, and how much detail you can invent, or how much detail you have to just recreate. What is it you tend to look for in a role these days, and has your approach to what you’re looking for changed much since you started out? L#wklqn#vr/#ghĽqlwho|1#Wkh#pruh#|rx#gr#lw/# the more you learn. In my case, there’s been a lot of learning on the job, and I don’t think you stop learning. New challenges are always welcome. They’re always exciting. But I think what remains the same is that I was told from a young age to be considerate as to what I’ve just done, and hope that what you do next brings a glļhuhqw#lqľhfwlrq/#dqg#eulqjv#d#glļhuhqw# set of challenges and requirements.

It still is the dream to be doing this for a living. Not many people get to do this, where I’m from. I count myself incredibly fortunate. I think when I initially started to believe it was possible was when I got into the [Televison Workshop] in Nottingham, because careers had been developed from there previously, and so it was proven that it could be done. I got into that workshop when I was 13. Whereas any experiences with drama before that might have just been fucking about at school, and just an hour where you weren’t sat at a desk. It was great that drama was compulsory at my school, and so we had to do it. I enjoyed it, and got referred to the workshop in Nottingham. I guess that’s when I started thinking, ‘Hold on, there’s a chance I could have a pop at this, and make it happen.’ When you started out in acting, did you feel like an outsider because of coming from a working-class background? I think I still do, to be honest. To be fair, I think there’s always that. It’s not typically SKINS 2009-2013 E4’s teen drama was already a cult phenomenon by the time O’Connell joined the cast as part of its second generation. Yet his hard-drinking hedonist Cook added more fuel to the fire with his boundary-pushing antics (‘Let’s go fucking mental!’). STARRED UP 2013 David Mackenzie’s prison drama gave O’Connell another powder-keg role in volatile inmate Eric, a young offender transferred to the lock-up where his estranged dad (Ben Mendelsohn) is incarcerated. ‘I wanted to give a mature depth to him,’ says the actor. ’71 2014 Having once considered a life in the army, O’Connell finally got to play soldier in Yann Demange’s drama about a British squaddie abandoned in 70s Belfast. According to the director, Jack’s ‘soulfulness and complexity’ made him perfect for the part. GODLESS 2017 O’Connell spent weeks training with genuine cowboys for his role in Netflix’s western series, an injured outlaw on the lam who finds refuge in a town run by women. ‘By the end I was one of the boys,’ he remembers. LADY CHATTERLEY’S LOVER 2022 To prepare for his part as gamekeeper Mellors, rugged lover of Emma Corrin’s titular aristo, O’Connell sought counsel from an old drama teacher at Nottingham’s Television Workshop. ‘He worships D.H. Lawrence and helped me know the character,’ the actor recalls. NS E4, ALAMY FIVE STAR TURNS 74 | TOTAL FILM | MARCH 2024 INTERVIEW SUBSCRIBE AT TOTALFILM.COM/SUBS\n\na working-class vocation. So that is omnipresent. I think any other workingclass actor would agree. That’s just the way it is, you know? It’s something to be proud of, I think. Have things improved since? L#wklqn#glyhuvlĽfdwlrq#lv#dssduhqw/#dqg/#|rx# nqrz/#L#zdqw#wr#eholhyh#wkdw#glyhuvlĽfdwlrq# is happening. But I don’t think that things are any easier for people from a workingclass background now – not compared to when I started out. If anything, I think there were more roles and more opportunities when I was starting out than there are at this current moment in time. For example, where I trained, the school wkdw#pdgh#gudpd#frpsxovru|/#fdqġw#dļrug# wr#gr#wkdw#dq|#pruh1#Wkh|#wrrn#gudpd#rļ# the curriculum about 10 years ago. It starts there, really, doesn’t it? Opportunities, and getting into the industry. All I’ve seen is those channels cease to exist. And you would have thought it would have gone the other way. Working with fellow Midlander Shane Meadows on This Is England must have been a formative experience? Oh my God, yeah, totally. Wkdw#zdv#p|#Ľuvw#Ľop/#dqg# Shane’s way of working was very improvised, and very spontaneous. I don’t think any of us really knew the narrative. I don’t think Shane did until he got into the edit.

But, you know, I think focusing on the here and now – I think every job you do is ghĽqlqj#lq#vrph#zd|1#Lwġv#orrnlqj#rxw# for the next one. I think you’re only as good as your next one. Skins was established by the time you joined, but it has proven to be such a crucible for young talent, with so many cast members who have gone on to do great things. What do you attribute that success to? I think that a lot of it was how it was cast. And now we’ve seen the Skins cohort go out and achieve brilliant things in the industry since then. It appears, coming out of it, that it’s been available to a whole new generation now. People will still approach me and want to talk about Skins, which I love, because I’m immensely proud of that show. It lives on, and I think that’s a testament to the great writing that we had. Skins employed a lot of young writers. I think it made things more authentic on the page. I jumped onto Skins when it was already two seasons in, so it was already this thing. Another great time. Another thing that I look back on and feel immense pride for. Starred Up was another big moment. Did you sense that when you were looking at that job? It felt good while we were making it, for sure. Again, it was quite a relaxed approach with the script and with the dialogue. It was very loosely structured, so we could bring our own interpretation, and no two takes, really, were the same. What was amazing about that was, because we had the one location – Crumlin Road Gaol in Belfast, and obviously it’s set in London – we just had freedom to shoot what we wanted, when we wanted. So we kept it chronological. We shot that story pretty much start to Ľqlvk/#zklfk#lv#xqkhdug# of. It’s a great luxury if you fdq#dļrug#wr#kdyh#lw1#Zh# reylrxvo|#ehqhĽwwhg#e|#mxvw#kdylqj#rqh# location to arrange for the whole shoot, which is, in itself, a rarity. It felt really good while we were making that, and I’m not surprised that it did as well as it’s done. You’ve gravitated towards a lot of lqwhqvh#urohv1#Gr#|rx#Ľqg#wkdw#vwxļ# hard to shake, or can you leave it behind at the end of each day? Not at the end of each day. I think when you’re in it, you kind of stay in it, to a degree, especially if you’re on location, and you’re not going home – you have the opportunity to stay in it. And that’s great, because you can then just bounce into the next day. You’re kind of already there. That’s an amazing sensation. But whether they’re intense or not, it’s nice to stay in that. I think at the end of a job, you put it away, and you say ‘ta-ra’, and you go and do whatever you need to do. Ehlqj#rq#d#uroo#lv#juhdw1#Erxqflqj#rļ# one job straight into another - that’s also great.

We were living in cabins on this icebreaker ship.

It was not something I ever pictured myself doing. The reality of it was mind-blowing. You’ve not done much blockbuster franchise material. Has that been a conscious choice? Just the way things have shaken out. There’s never been a conversation where I’ve turned around and said, ‘Look, I don’t want to do that.’ There’s no exclusivity involved there. It’s just literally the way it’s shaken out. The jobs I’ve ended up doing are ones that we’ve taken on board at the time, decisions we made at the time. Again, there’s never been any real want to pursue that either. Have you ever had any auditions for vxshukhur#vwxļ#wkdw#kdvqġw#zrunhg# out for whatever reason? [Laughs] No comment. Your name’s often on lists of potential James Bond actors. Is that something that would appeal? I mean, listen, if something like that comes my way, sure.

OK, let’s ghĽqlwho|#fkdw1 It’s not something I’m going to turn my nose up at. I’m sure there’s a long, long list.

But I guess by now it’s just part and parcel of what you do. If something you’re in is really that successful, then that’s great. If loads of people have taken to it, and have enjoyed it… I’m an actor. That’s the point. I don’t know. To answer your question properly, I think you’ve got to have something other than that. I think this is important for any artist. There has to be something that takes you out of that, that you can escape from and be without that. I don’t think that’s why we make things. We make things to tell stories, and to move people along the way. Any of the rwkhu#vwxļ#wkdw#|rxġuh#uhihuulqj#wr/#L#wklqn# is secondary. But, yeah, of course it would make you nervous.

Are friends electric? Snowman’s spooky strike Do androids really dream of electric sheep? Robot reveries turn out to be far more rich and soulful than Philip K. Dick suggested in Pablo Berger’s heartwarming (and sometimes heartbreaking) Oscar-nominated animation about a lonely New York City dog and his robot buddy. Surprisingly, this vibrant, moving story about the very human need for friendship and connection has zero humans in it, because Dog is pining for a pal in a bustling, Zootropolis-style animal-packed 1980s Big Apple. His solitary life of Pong-for-one and ready meals is transformed when he literally makes a friend, laboriously constructing Robot from a TV-advertised kit. The second sizeable surprise is that this cleverly compassionate film also has no dialogue. Director Pablo Berger’s lush silent-cinema take on Snow White, 2012’s Blancanieves, proved he was a whiz at visual storytelling. But here he uses Chaplinesque physical comedy to show Dog and Robot’s growing happiness, as they roller-disco dizzyingly in Central Park to Earth, Wind & Fire’s September, which becomes ‘their’ song, commemorating the month they met. Sweet, authentic facial expressions (strictly no stretchy cartoon shtick) signal Robot’s gleeful wonder at discovering the joy of skyscrapers, fat squelchy hotdogs and a groovy octopus bucket-drummer on the subway. Rather than Ron’s Gone Wrong AI-robot chaos, Dog and Robot’s happy hangForking cleverly here, the film becomes more melancholic but also pleasingly ambitious, exploring Dog’s guilty attempts at rescue and time-filling hobbies, while diving headlong into Robot’s inner yearnings. As snow-covered Robot sinks into surreal worried-or-wacky dreams about a Dog reunion, the film’s world opens wide and gets experimental. Soon he (and we) are reeling at encounters with rabbit rotters in a rowboat, twisty fantasy escapes, and a fourth-wall turnaround ROBOT DREAMS PG There are no words… DIRECTOR Pablo Berger SCREENPLAY Pablo Berger DISTRIBUTOR Curzon RUNNING TIME 102 mins THE IRON GIANT 1999 Brad Bird’s touching tale of a boy-and-bot friendship that sparks Cold War pandemonium.

Berger’s first animated outing (a passion-project adaptation of Sara Varon’s 2007 graphic novel) is also a deliciously detailed love letter to New York City, painting a note-perfect recreation of noisy, scuzzy 80s streetlife for his funky, retro animal characters. It’s all rendered in glowing colours and 2D ‘clean line’ Tintin-like animation. But when an idyllic day of Rockaway Beach swimming rusts Robot’s joints and battery into immovability, New York bites back: the NYPD and City Hall force frantic Dog to leave him stranded on the firmly fenced-off beach till next summer.

Despite some nifty plot twists (including big bird love for Robot), the film does get too overlong and dawdling for its slender story. Still, paring back Dog and Robot’s wild or wistful quests would have denied us the wealth of fun sight gags and sly detail (posturing punks, turnstile-jumpers, the sad pop-pop bubbles of microwaving a single portion of mac and cheese) that Berger loves to linger on. But his biggest whisking us into a wild Wizard of Oz tap-dancing extravaganza. If Robot’s reveries deepen the film’s emotional themes, Dog’s try-hard quests allow Berger to bring on delightful Jacques Tati-style comedy: take the soaring winter-sports slapstick with aggro anteaters for example, or Dog’s trippy bowling date with a scary snowman. Using the same clean 2D style throughout all these episodes keeps everything unified, as do different, poignant soundtrack versions of September, the musical thread connecting distant Dog and Robot throughout. The drifty, dream-punctuated second half might puzzle younger kids, though its universal themes and visual gags are perfectly all-ages appropriate. coup is not getting too hung up on the notion of ‘soulmates’; instead, he has created a dream-filled movie that identifies emotional realities about change and personal growth. For both Dog and Robot, it’s not who you love, but how you love that matters.

Set in 1989, it centres on Lisa (Kathryn Newton), a highschooler who lives with her father (Joe Chrest), stepmother (Carla Gugino) and stepsister Taffy (Liza Soberano), yet prefers to hang out at the local cemetery, among the tombstones. Though she has a crush on the editor of the school lit magazine (Henry Eikenberry), Lisa soon finds her real love – at the graveyard – when a corpse (Riverdale’s Cole Sprouse) comes back to life. He doesn’t speak and cries tears that smell like vomit. Nevertheless, hiding him at home in her closet, Lisa is smitten – and becomes more so as things get increasingly macabre. J ohan Renck’s (Chernobyl) film casts Adam Sandler as ‘the loneliest man who has ever lived’. That’s no wild claim: Sandler plays astronaut Jakub who, nine months into a mission to investigate a mysterious cloud by Jupiter, is the furthest from human contact that anyone has ever been. Jakub’s eager to patch things up with his pregnant wife Lenka (Carey Mulligan) back on Earth; but this gorgeous existential sci-fi has more than space travel and despair on its mind. Before long, our hero forges a connection with a giant extraterrestrial spider with an abundance of emotional intelligence and a tiny human mouth, from which springs the voice of Paul Dano. Yes, it sounds like the premise for a broad comedy – and Spaceman does deliver the Directed by Zelda Williams (daughter of Robin), Lisa Frankenstein contains its share of LOLs. Another big plus is the musical interlude featuring a version of REO Speedwagon’s Can’t Fight This Feeling, adeptly sung by a game Newton. Sprouse gives an expressive, Edward Scissorhandsesque performance as ‘The Creature’ – but sadly, the more violent the film gets, the less engaging it becomes. The final act also drifts when it should arrow towards a darkly comic denouement. Still, filled with Cody’s trademark wit and some nifty 80s design schemes, it’s a slick, sick ride with strong teen appeal. JAMES MOTTRAM THE VERDICT A neat mash-up of high-school comedy and horror tropes. Pity it falters in the final third. occasional laugh. But this is an impactful and at times profound film, with a hauntingly lovely turn from Sandler. From the alien spider’s teeth to a host of glowing celestial bodies and even Sandler’s ship’s zero-gravity toilet, Spaceman is flush with careful detail. It’s also a film filled with the unexpected – one that doesn’t follow a familiar narrative structure, provide neat answers or make the viewer feel any less alone in this vast, cold universe. But for those who are open to the wonderfully weird, it offers up some deep truths, terrific performances and an alien gob that truly transfixes the attention. LEILA LATIF THE VERDICT A soulsearching Adam Sandler excels in a sci-fi drama that’s both way-out and weighty.

Duly, he honours her demand to drive her body – glassy-eyed in the backseat – to her childhood village for burial. And slowly, surely, Jon learns to reconnect with the world.

Shooting in a disused Tunis hotel, Hania experiments boldly with form, using first-person testimony from Olfa and her two younger children, rehearsals with actors playing the mother and the absent older siblings, and filmed reenactments of family memories. What’s revealed is a cycle of suffering in which traumatic experiences are tragically passed from generation to generation.

Wilful and near-silent, he’s treated with curiosity, before suspicion and fear creep in as he’s revealed to possess strange – possibly divine – powers. More a loose collection of scenes than a cohesive narrative, it’s still an enveloping audiovisual experience, with Thornton’s gorgeous lensing almost matched by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis’ expressive score. CHRIS SCHILLING ★★★★★ OUT 8 MARCH CINEMAS DO NOT EXPECT TOO MUCH FROM THE END OF THE WORLD 18 Safety-video games… Anear-three-hour dark comedy about a frazzled production assistant interviewing candidates for a workplace safety video might not sound like many cinemagoers’ idea of a good time. Throw in a cameo from controversial filmmaker Uwe Boll, nods to the repellent Andrew Tate and inserts of 1981 social-realist drama Angela Goes On, and Radu Jude’s latest might seem an avant-garde provocation too far. But this restlessly inventive and scabrously funny film taps into universal and relatable truths. When she’s not delivering tirades at fellow road users or making X-rated clips as Tatesatirising TikTok alter-ego Bobita, Ilinca Manolache’s Angela proves that she’s as smart as she is cynical – notably when she’s running rings around Nina Hoss’ entertainingly aloof exec. Jude boldly flips from gritty black-and-white to colour for the tragicomic third act: a static long shot depicting the filming of the video that grows ever more hilarious and exasperating. With Manolache relegated to the sidelines, some of the film’s spark is lost. But its critique of corporate culture comes through as loudly as Angela’s potty-mouthed rants. CHRIS SCHILLING THE VERDICT Expect plenty from this surprising and twistedly funny film – and to hear more from its spellbinding star. Ilinca Manolache: let’s be careful out there TOTALFILM.COM MARCH 2024 | TOTAL FILM | 83\n\nJohn Waters and early Almodóvar, and such noted ‘sexploitation’ purveyors as Russ Meyer and Doris Wishman. In this they are mostly successful – but it comes at the cost of their collaboration having a distinctive timbre of its own. Throw in a luggage-sized McGuffin straight out of Pulp Fiction, and we’re left with a comedy steeped in déjà vu. There is no denying, though, that Qualley and Viswanathan make a highly likeable duo in a film that also boasts entertaining cameos from the likes of Matt Damon, Pedro Pascal and pop star Miley Cyrus. NEIL SMITH THE VERDICT Ethan Coen strikes out on his own with a frivolous frolic that wears its slightness like a badge of honour. ★★★★★ OUT 15 MARCH CINEMAS DRIVE-AWAY DOLLS 15 It’s all Coen south… DIRECTOR Ethan Coen STARRING Margaret Qualley, Geraldine Viswanathan, Beanie Feldstein, Colman Domingo, Pedro Pascal SCREENPLAY Ethan Coen, Tricia Cooke DISTRIBUTOR Universal RUNNING TIME 84 mins suitable title for this knockabout caper, in which loquacious Texan Jamie (Margaret Qualley) and her prim friend Marian (Geraldine Viswanathan) take an impromptu road trip from Philadelphia to Tallahassee, in a rental car that just happens to have a sought-after suitcase secreted in its trunk. Said valise and its contents are prized enough for a sharp-suited mandarin dubbed ‘The Chief’ (Colman Domingo) to send two bumbling goons to retrieve it. Jamie, meanwhile, has her own mission improbable: to get Marian laid. When Tricia Cooke – Ethan’s spouse, the Coens’ sometime-editor and a person who identifies as queer – conceived the film’s scenario, it carried the more provocative moniker Drive-Away Dykes. Curiously, though, Dolls is more quaint than outrageous. Its 1999 setting and saucy details (a wall-mounted dildo here, a Sapphic slumber party there) lend it the air of a bawdy period piece from the Porky’s and Meatballs era. Coen and Cooke’s stated aim was to homage both the trashy aesthetics of I t perhaps says something about the Coen brothers’ respective sensibilities that, when older sibling Joel went off to make 2021’s The Tragedy of Macbeth in black and white with wife Frances McDormand, younger brother Ethan chose to dust off a raunchy crime romp he had written with his wife 20 years ago, and shoot it in eye-popping colour. A freewheeling road movie about two queer chums being pursued by hoods from Pennsylvania to Florida, Drive-Away Dolls is definitely not Shakespeare. But it is unmistakably a Coen(s) film, albeit one that feels more like a pastiche of their previous pictures than an innovative next chapter. There are times when ‘Throw-Away Dolls’ might arguably have been a more KISS ME DEADLY 1955 The briefcase at the heart of Drive-Away Dolls harks back to this noir classic’s mystery box. FASTER, PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL! 1965 Female-led road-trip riotousness from sexploitation maven Russ Meyer.

Sensitive eight-year-old Thomas (Charlie Vauselle) quietly observes the often-mysterious adult world around him and takes refuge in the exploits of masked superhero Fantômette. Sensually shot and making evocative use of period songs, Red Island imaginatively blends the personal and the political. TOM DAWSON LOVELY, DARK, AND DEEP 15 ★★★★★ OUT 25 MARCH DIGITAL Barbarian star Georgina Campbell finds herself in another nightmare scenario in writer/director Teresa Sutherland’s debut, a tricksy horror largely set in the desolate wilds of a national park. Campbell plays Lennon, a ranger whose time monitoring the park gets increasingly fractious and dreamlike. The actor is a solid presence, shouldering the bulk of the narrative peril, but she’s hampered by a workmanlike script. And while the atmosphere is amped up with an unnerving score and some eerie wide shots, actual scares are few and far between. JAMES MOTTRAM VINDICATION SWIM PG ★★★★★ OUT 8 MARCH CINEMAS First-time director Elliott Hasler offers a warm-hearted but sentimental take on penniless Mercedes Gleitze’s (Kirsten Callaghan) 1927 battles to be the first British woman to swim the Channel. It’s a plucky attempt, but pretty period locations and jaunty fake newsreels can’t compensate for the film’s clunky scripting, halting pace and stilted performances (only John Locke’s drunken, crabby swim coach registers). There’s a fascinating Chariots of Fire-style story to be made about Gleitze’s tenacity against the cruel sea, posh-rival cheats and sexist court cases. But sadly, this isn’t it. KATE STABLES BANEL & ADAMA 12A ★★★★★ OUT 15 MARCH CINEMAS As a drought devastates their small village in northern Senegal, a young married couple (Khady Mane and Mamadou Diallo, their chemistry sizzling) navigate their star-crossed romance in the face of local obligation and tradition. The feature debut of FrenchSenegalese director RamataToulaye Sy, this haunting modern fable moves with poetic grace, juggling lingering views of the idyllic yet sun-ravaged desert with intimate close-ups of the townsfolk. The beauty belies the growing horror at the heart of the story, as a once-passionate love is engulfed by superstition and circumstance. JOEL HARLEY ★★★★★ OUT 8 MARCH CINEMAS SHAYDA 15 Taking shelter… I nspired by the director’s own experiences, Noora Niasari’s film is a powerful look at both Iranian culture and domestic violence. Zar Amir Ebrahimi (who won Cannes’ Best Actress for Holy Spider in 2022) delivers a nuanced turn in the title role, an Iranian mother-ofone who, after leaving abusive husband Hossein (Osamah Sami), finds refuge in a shelter for women in the Australian suburbs. Aided by the kindly Joyce (Leah Purcell), Shayda tries to get her life back on track alongside her young daughter Mona (Selina Zahednia). Knife-edge tension takes hold when Hossein reappears, raising the possibility that he may yet snatch Mona and smuggle her back to Iran. Like Asghar Farhadi’s A Separation (2011) before it, Niasari’s script touches on Iran’s byzantine divorce laws, pressing home the jeopardy Shayda faces. She also manages to juggle microaggressions in the shelter with slivers of joy; an exuberant, unfettered dance sequence offers uplift. Meanwhile, the setting of 90s Australia conveys a sure sense of how abuse against women in the home is a universal issue. Throughout, Ebrahimi and impressive newcomer Zahednia present a credible parent/child bond. The final third doesn’t quite deliver on the set-up’s promise, with the drama fizzling out somewhat. But this perceptive film - which won the Audience Award at last year’s Sundance - still hits a nerve.
