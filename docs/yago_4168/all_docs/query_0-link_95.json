Unlike his compatriot and rival, Charles Pathé, Léon Gaumont came from a comfortable background, running a well-established photographic and optical apparatus business. He was financially well-connected, and in 1895 was able to found the Léon Gaumont company with a capital of 200,000 francs. He acquired the rights to inventions by a man called Demeny, and with the help of his partner was able to give the illusion of living portraits by marketing the chronophotograph. It was only a short step to involvement with the newly fledged cinema, and he opened his film studio, soon to be known as \"Cité Elge\" after his initials, at Buttes-Chaumont. This became one of the largest studios in Europe, managed by Gaumont's secretary, Alice Guy, who was to become an important figure in American cinema and is often cited as the first woman director.\n\nGaumont's first films were simple vaudeville sketches, comedies, moral tales, and, of course, imitations of other people's film successes. As his enterprise expanded and developed, documentaries, newsreels, scientific and educational programmes were embarked upon.\n\nHis organisation now spread to other countries, and in England, for example, Colonel Bromhead opened the first Gaumont Cinema in 1901. The first British Gaumont production was The Life of Richard Wagner, and the Gaumont Graphic soon took its place among British newsreels. Documentaries included The Ascent of Mont Blanc and the National Pilgrimage to Lourdes of 1902. In 1913, Gaumont established his Vitorine Studios in Nice, which was to form the basis of Rex Ingram's studio.\n\nThe sound-film was of special interest to Gaumont, and in 1903 he introduced the chronophone which he circulated worldwide. His technical section was constantly experimenting with improvements, and he introduced early wide-screen and elaborate amplification systems. Although talkies did not really come into their own until the end of the twenties, nevertheless Gaumont maintained his interest in the area and was associated with the first modern French sound film, Eau de nil.\n\nGaumont took a particular interest in the American cinema, and was a close friend of George Eastman, the raw-film manufacturer. He championed the independent filmmakers of Europe against the Edison Trust controls, but the First World War was a big blow to European cinema, particularly that of France. American films were encroaching, with technical innovation and big star names that were extremely popular with French audiences. Gaumont ruefully remarked, \"We made munitions for war in our factories. They made movies, and they have conquered us.\"\n\nGaumont attracted many talented people to his studios. After Guy left, he replaced her with Victorin Jasset, the maker of the famous Zigomar serial, and following him came perhaps the most famous name in the Gaumont team—Louis Feuillade. It was he who gave the films a particular colouring, with his famous serials Fantômas, LesVampires, and Judex. The worldwide popularity of these films and their special visual richness make them today classics of a great period of French filmmaking.\n\nAs the French film developed visually and artistically, the Gaumont company found a home for such diverse and innovative talents as Léon Poirier (Jocelyn, La Brière), Marcel L'Herbier (Rose France, El Dorado), Jacques Feyder (La Faute d'orthographie), Léonce Perret (comedian, and director of L'enfant de Paris), and Abel Gance (actor, and director of La Folie du Dr. Tube).\n\nBy 1925, Gaumont had increased his capital by an arrangement with MGM, but by 1938 his financial structures began to crumble. Today, his name is still familiar, but the extent of his achievement is past history. There was little in the field of cinema that he did not tackle. He handled production and worldwide distribution, ran supercinemas, developed colour and sound, and made huge technical innovations. He was a harsh taskmaster, never less than frank if the work of one of his employees displeased him, and in the early days, so they say, this giant of the French cinema stood at the doors of his studio with watch in hand, checking the arrival of every one of his staff.\n\n—Liam O'Leary"
