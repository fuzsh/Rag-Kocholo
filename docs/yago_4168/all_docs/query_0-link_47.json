Filmmakers were concerned with the technical aspect of making figures move rather than how the film looked. As movies developed from novelty stage productions to more sophisticated nar­ ratives, so did set design. One of the few men to see the beginnings of this evolution and then guide it to its pinnacle was Cedric Gibbons, art director at MGM. Because he was able to retain his position in MGM's Art Department for twenty-five years, Gibbons became a prominent leader in motion picture art direction, helping to establishing and promoting what is known today as the MGM style. When art directors from MGM and other studios think of set design, Cedric Gibbons automatically comes to mind. Preston Ames, an architect who began at MGM in 1936 said, \"Gibbons was probably the forerunner of all the great art directors in the business. He sort of set up a taste and style which films never had before. . . .Ml Boris Leven, another architect/art director who worked briefly at MGM before moving in 1938 to Paramount, credited Gibbons with being \"instrumental in promoting the profession of art 1Mike Steen, Hollywood Speaks!; An Oral History, (New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1974), 225. 2 direction . . . . \"2 Jean Renoir's art director Eugene Lourie thought Cedric Gibbons made all the MGM pictures.3 In addition to Gibbons's peers, writers have also praised his contributions. He has been called the \"dean of the Hollywood art directors,\"4 \"the most celebrated production designer,\"5 and \"the nearest thing to a movie star that Hollywood art direction ever had.\"6 MGM's own publicity department, which built and promoted the glamorous images of its stars, waxed enthusiastic with superlatives, declaring, \". . .he has virtually recreated the world on eighty acres that comprise MGM and, his settings have established a standard for the motion picture industry.\"7 In short, Cedric Gibbons has attained legendary status in the film world. 2Mary Corliss and Carlos Clarens, \"Designed for Film: The Hollywood Art Director,\" Film Comment 14 (May-June, 1978): 49. 3 Ibid. , 51. 4Ralph Flint, \"Cedric Gibbons,\" Creative Arts 11 (October, 1932): 117. 5 Ephraim Katz, ed., The Film Encyclopedia (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell, 1979), s.v. \"Cedric Gibbons\". 6 John Hambley and Patrick Downing, The Art of Hollywood: Fifty Years of Art Direction (London, Thames Television, 1979), 53. 7Morton Eustis, \"Designing for the Movies: Gibbons of MGM,\" Theatre Arts 21 (October, 1937): 784. 3 However, Gibbons was not without his critics, whether because of his insistence on screen credit or because of his managerial style. Leon Barsacq, in his book Caligari's Cabinet and Other Grand Illusions, was critical of the way Gibbons took credit for art direction in MGM films when, the sets were actually designed by others.8 Vincente Minnelli saw Gibbons's control of the Art Department as \"a medieval fiefdom, its overlord accustomed to doing things in a certain way . . . his own.\"9 Mitchell Leisen, a director who also worked as an art director under Gibbons in 1929, described an incident from Leisen's Young Man With Ideas (1951): The distinct Metro style was set up by Cedric Gibbons. Whether it fitted the story or not, he was going to have his sets paramount. For a dinner party in a golf club . . . I had picked out a set that was standing, but oh no, that was not MGM. Gibbons did the most elaborate country club you'd ever seen, all bright white .... He was God out there. He wanted it a certain way, that was the MGM style and that's what you got.10 While some former MGM art directors were critical, others remained relatively neutral about his methods. For aLeon Barsacq, Caligari's Cabinet and Other Grand Illusions: A History of Film Design, trans. by Michael Bullock, rev. and ed. by Elliott Stein (Boston: New York Graphic Society, 1976), 166-167. 9Hambley, 59. 10 Ibid., 59 4 example, Edward Carfagno, an early MGM art director, summed up the situation by saying, \"That was the way it was done in those days.\"11 Gibbons's god-like demeanor also extended to his relationship with his staff. Boris Leven remembers almost never seeing Gibbons when he worked at MGM. It was five years before Jack Martin, another MGM unit art director, saw Cedric Gibbons. Indicative of Gibbons’s legendary aloofness is the story of how he would arrive at the studio in his Deusenberg, wearing a grey homburg hat and gloves. Once inside the art department, depending on his mood, he would take off or leave on the gloves. Removing his hat, he would say \"hello\" to his secretary as the art department watched in awe.12 His behavior may have been criticized by those envious of his power but those criticisms seem minor when compared to Gibbons's stature in the profession. PURPOSE OF STUDY Over the years, Gibbons has received much attention in the media, yet he still remains an enigma. There has been no concerted effort to consolidate Gibbons’ life and role at MGM into one comprehensive picture. One largely 11 Former MGM Art Director, Edward Carfagno of Los Angeles, interviewed by author, 22 August 1987, Los Angeles, tape recording, author's collection. 12 Corliss, 48. 5 unexplained aspect is the way he organized and managed the MGM Art Department as if it were a large architect's office. This study will examine the way in which Cedric Gibbons1s ideas about how an art department should function directly influenced the \"MGM look.\" Preston Ames said of Gibbons's art department, \"The best way to describe our operation is to compare it to an architect's office.\"13 Cedric Gibbons at one point wanted to call the Art Department the \"Architectural and Engineering Department,\" as he felt the name better reflected what the department did. It is puzzling that no one has made the particular connection between how Gibbons ran his art department and how his management style influenced set design in general. With the increasing interest in set design in the past few years, it is time that Cedric Gibbons receive a more thorough examination. I believe that an exploration of the relationship between MGM's Art Department and an architect's office, will help place Gibbons's contribution to set design in better perspective. The analogy will also clarify why Gibbons was able to retain his position at MGM for twenty-five years and why he was able to mandate \"his style\" of art direction for so long. In addition, the Cedric Gibbons's myth and its detractors, as 13Donald Knox, The Magic Factory: How MGM Made an American in Paris (New York: Praeger, 1973), 57. 6 they have developed over the years, can be put into better perspective by examining his art direction through his management style. SCOPE While the study will not cover Cedric Gibbons's entire career, it is important to examine his early influences and training. The major focus of the thesis will be the years 1917-1939, years covering his Goldwyn Pictures employment and the early beginnings at MGM through the \"Golden Years.\" The importance of examining Gibbons's early years in set design is to show how a European trip, the Art Student's League, his father's architectural office, and the Edison and Goldwyn studios contributed to his unique artistic and management styles at MGM. Historically, the early years of film production and set design are also relevant because of the rapid technological developments in the film industry. The years of silent films were a time of experimentation and Cedric Gibbons's played an important role in advancing set design to a higher level of sophistication by the thirties. The years from 1930 to 1939 saw many changes in the motion picture industry with the advent of sound and the establishment of the \"classical Hollywood style.\" 7 Production was now centralized in a studio. The division of labor saw the various tasks of filmmaking split into various departments. Responsibilities for screenwriting, casting, cinematography, editing, researching, etc. now were handled by different departments. MGM's Art Department firmly implanted into this new system a style that was to become synonymous with the studio. Also during the thirties, a new form of architecture was being promoted by department stores, architects, and designers in the United States. This new movement labeled \"Modernism\" because it used free-flowing interiors, bold abstract designs, and new industrial materials in different ways, it was a welcome relief from earlier nineteenth century clutter and fussiness. Modernism, and movies could both lay claim to being new, and what better place to exploit this new modernism than in the movies. Many art directors swayed by this avant-garde style, hoped to make this new modernism more accessible and palatable to the general public. This could be accomplished in films because on a sound stage, the modernist style could be manipulated in ways that were previously available only to architects who practiced in the \"real\" world. Needless to say, the allure of this twentieth century architecture exerted a particular appeal to certain producers, directors, and art directors, among them Cedric Gibbons, who in turn was instrumental in giving Modernism 8 a new aesthetic interpretation during his employment at MGM. Gibbons liked Modernism for its simplification of forms, its clean lines, and its elimination of fussy details. The Great Depression also had a strong influence on MGM production. By supplying audiences with a \"modern look,\" the MGM style became associated with wealth and progressive values. Audiences were treated to optimistic views of the future in these modernistic environments of the movies. The sets suggested undreamt of possibilities, environments that viewers could escape to for a few hours, leaving behind them the harsh realities of life. The artistic context in which a particular set design exists cannot be ignored when discussing the history of sets. Art and technology were bound to collide in the twentieth century as can be seen in the many art movements that followed upon one another during the early part of the century. Moving away from its nineteenth century antecedents, each art movement, from the short-lived Art Nouveau in 1905 to the Art Moderne/Art Deco of the twenties and thirties, promoted the idea of modernism. PROBLEMS AND LIMITATIONS One problem in studying Cedric Gibbons's career is assigning dates to specific events in his life. Statis- 9 tical data, such as when and where he was born, are not very reliable. At least three different birthdates, anywhere from 1890 to 1895 have been given, the most common mentioned is 1893. According to different sources, his birthplace could be either Dublin, New York, or Brooklyn. For the purposes of this study, the birthdate used will be 1890 and the place of birth will be Brooklyn, New York.14 Other dates in Gibbons' life also cannot be firmly established. The dates of his attendance at the Art Student's League and employment at the Edison Studios vary in the literature. Most writers state that he attended the Art Student's League, but give no dates. Morton Eustis1 article on Cedric Gibbons locates him at the art school four years prior to 1911, marking Gibbons' entrance to the school in 1906-1907 when he was approximately sixteen or seventeen years old. Gibbons supposedly won the League's coveted Prix de Rome, but he never went to Rome.15 One of the requirements being that the winner be 14Hazel Brooks was Cedric Gibbons's second wife and she reconfirmed the death certificate birthdate as 1890. Hazel Brooks, telephone interview by the author, 18 August, 1987, Los Angeles. 15The Art Students League Prize was actually called the Prix de Paris. The Architectural League, which was housed in the same building as the Art Students League, offered a Prix de Rome award. 10 twenty-one or older. If one uses the 1890 birthdate, the above dates are possible. His starting dates at the Edison movie studio range from 1912 to 1915. The MGM studio biographies list 1912 as the starting date, while other articles give the year as 1914. Stefen Verk, on the other hand, believes Gibbons started in 1916.16 This later date is suspect, since we know that Gibbons was working in his father's office about 1911-1912 after attending the Art Student's League, and before he went to work for Hugo Ballin, a well-known theatrical scenic backdrop painter, prior to Ballin working for Edison about 1914. By late 1916, Samuel Goldwyn had hired both Ballin and Gibbons. In addition to the confusion in dates, there is a definite connection between what the MGM publicity department much like all the studios, famous for inventing and dealing loosely in the facts, provided the public and what journalists wrote.17 More often than not, the misinformation provided by the publicity department was repeated in subsequent articles. 16Stefen Verk, \"Designer for the Screen: Cedric Gibbons Interview,\" American Artist 12 (November, 1948): 36. 17MGM was not alone as its publicity was notorious for inventing facts about its stars. Though frustrating, the problem of varying dates in Cedric's career is hardly an obstacle to discovering how Gibbons was able to create the \"MGM style.\" Another problem has been that of determining what films Cedric Gibbons actually designed. Gibbons is credited with approximately 2,000 films during his career. Reasons for this incredible number are the studios' large output and Gibbons's Goldwyn contract which stipulated that he was to be given credit for every film he worked on. Similarly, his contract at MGM required that he be given sole credit for every film the studio produced in the United States.18 At the same time, early silent films are notorious for giving little credit to those outside the director, producer, actor/actress, screenwriter, and cameraman who worked on the movie. An art director was rarely credited; at Paramount, art directors never were. The problem of attribution can be traced to the studio system. The studio management style meant most employees had to be team players and work under assembly- line filming conditions. Under these conditions, each studio developed its own particular look, the art department staff executing their department head's preferences. Today it seems odd to take credit for the 18Howard Mandelbaum and Eric Myers, Screen Deco: A Celebration of High Style in Hollywood (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1985) , 22 . 12 work of others, but there was artistic and architectural precedence, dating from the Renaissance until the nineteenth century and in the 'teens and twenties, it seemed only natural for Gibbons. In any event, assigning particular MGM films to Gibbons' own hand is a monumental task, and it would hardly be worth the effort, for it would not lead to any additional insights. A second problem concerns the new feeling toward art and technology following World War I and the attempt to classify the terminology used to describe the new movement. \"Modernism\" was the term generally used to describe this new sense of power, speed and energy. The movement's characteristics encompassed so many changes during its span of popularity that it developed several different definitions along the way. Modernism was so closely connected to the arts and architecture that each discipline developed its own names for its brand of \"modernism.\" The arts had such movements as Cubism, Constructivism, and Futurism. In architecture, instead one found Art Moderne, Moderne, International Style, and Bauhaus. Several movements like the Wierner Werkstatte, De Stijl, and Bauhaus attempted to bridge the gap between art and industry by employing both artists and architects. The only theme that held these various movements together was the machine. 13 Besides the different terminology used by the various media, there was a chronological split in modernism. Martin Battersby in his book, The Decorative Twenties, used the term \"modernist\" to denote furniture and other artifacts made after 1925 and \"Art Deco\" for the decorative arts before that year.19 In Kern Weber, The Moderne in Southern California, David Gebhard and Harriette Von Breton make a distinction between the International Style, the Constructivist Machine Style and the Machine Expressionist Style.20 The authors further split the American Moderne age into two phases: the Zig- Zag Moderne of the 1920s and the Streamlined Moderne of the 1930s.21 Other popular terms used in the thirties included \"Art Moderne\" and \"Style Moderne.\" Sorting out the proper terminology to use when describing this modernistic era can be made more confusing when a more contemporary expression is added to the list. Coined by Bevis Hillier in 1960, \"Art Deco\", has come to encompass every style that has emerged between the two World Wars. Although officially coined to describe the 19Martin Battersby, The Decorative Twenties (London: Studio Vista, 1971), 7. 20David Gebhard and Harriette Von Breton, Kern Weber: The Moderne in Southern California, 1920 Through 1944 (Santa Barbara, University of California, 1976), 6^7. 21 David Gebhard and Harriette Von Breton, L.A. in the Thirties 1931-1941 (Los Angeles, Peregrine Smith, Inc., 1975), 11. 14 style of the 1925 Paris Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Moderne exhibits, the term was not used at that time, but rather found its definition in the subtitle of the 1966 Musee des Arts Decoratifs retrospective catalogue. Anglicized and abbreviated from the title, \"Art Deco\" evokes a kinship with Art Nouveau.22 In his book, Art Deco, Hillier distinguishes between a twenties and thirties \"Art Deco\" style and admits that there is a strong continuity between the two decades, the style developing over twenty years to reach its peak in the thirties. Popularly, Art Deco has come to be synonymous with the modernistic style that emerged from the 1925 Paris Exposition and lasted until the mid-thirties when Stream­ lined Moderne/Art Moderne took over. The use of the term \"Art Deco\" to describe this particular time period, though is still being debated. For example, in Screen Deco, authors Howard Mandelbaum and Eric Myers are well aware of the inadequacy of the term, but are willing to define it more loosely, not as a specific style but in an inclusive way that denotes a tremendous fertility of ideas, culture and design, beginning in the early twentieth century and reaching its peak in the 1920s and 1930s.23 22Bevis Hillier, Art Deco (London: Studio Vista/Dutton Pictureback, 1968), 11. 2 3 MandeIbaum, 4. 15 Another current popular expression use to describe the years between the World Wars is \"The Machine Age,\" which refers to the connection between art and the \"new\" American technology. Machines were encroaching on everyday life, threatening ties to the past by challenging traditional means of industrial production and cultural values. The machine also opened America's eyes to a new way of seeing. During the twenties and thirties, the machine was being used in new and exciting ways. It was discovered, explored, exploited, and glorified by all the arts, as well as by architecture.24 The machine age represented America’s coming of age in the world of technology. Although \"Art Deco\" has been used to describe movie sets of the twenties and thirties, it is still a rather generalized term that creates more confusion than it solves. Since this study focuses on architecture in its examination of Cedric Gibbons and the MGM Art Department, the more specific architectural terms Moderne and Art Moderne will be used. While the fields of art and architecture were expanding their modernistic vocabulary, the motion picture industry was formulating its own standards of production. 24Richard Guy Wilson, Dianne H. Pilgrim, and Dickran Tashjian, The Machine Age in America, 1918-1941 (New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1986), 331. 16 Basic elements to any film story are plot, character, and setting. In the early decades of motion pictures, setting was clearly ranked last. Art direction consisted of, \"Hey there Jack! A rich man's parlor on the backstage!\"25 The man in charge of providing the environment was called the property man. The evolution of set design and the role of the set designer, or the art director, was slow to develop in silent film production. At first, the director or producer was responsible for the set's conception and construction. As directors' responsibilities grew, the job was turned over to the painter of sets, the scenic designer. Following World War I, the responsibility of planning and erecting sets was handled by the technical director. The term \"art director\" did not appear until the late 'teens and early 'twenties, and even then, the title varied when mentioned in the literature. Early archi­ tecture journal articles on set design use the terms \"photoplay architect\" and \"cinema designer\" to describe the position. The variety of terms used to describe people who designed sets shows how the position grew in stature from that of prop man to art director, and how each of the arts responded with their own variety. 25Alfred A. Cohn, \"The Art Director\", Photoplay 10 (August, 1916): 43. 17 As motion picture studios became more hierarchical in their organization in the twenties and thirties, their art departments followed suit. Not all studios developed art departments as large and complex as that of MGM, but they still retained a department head, calling him either an Art Director or Supervising Art Director. A Supervising Art Director's job was the same as that of an Art Director and often the titles were interchangeable until the mid­ thirties when the position of Supervising Art Director became the dominant term. The only difference between the two positions was that the supervising art director held more executive responsibilities. For motion picture studios, the silent era saw extensive production activity with more than one picture a week being made. Because of the heavy workload, a new position was created: the Unit Art Director. Under the control of the Supervising Art Director, the Unit Art Director was responsible for the planning of all assigned film projects and the staff needed to accomplish that project. The differences between unit art director, art director and supervising art director were often blurred at many studios. Paramount's Hans Dreier who held the title supervising art director at the same time as Gibbons, frequently designed sets while still carrying out his executive duties. Other art directors such as Van 18 Nest Poiglase at RKO and Anton Grot at Warner Brothers considered themselves solely art directors, even though they headed their respective departments. The confusion created by the interchangeability of titles increased with the addition of the use of Set Designer/Decorator to describe the same position. Involved with motion picture sets for over forty years, George Hopkins called himself a set decorator, even though he designed and supervised the costuming. He even wrote screen titles for silent pictures!26 By the mid-thirties, Hans Dreier differentiated the titles of set designer and art director. A set designer mainly prepared the working plans of the set for the art director. To be successful he had to understand the style and intentions of the art director, as well as having his own creative ability.27 As one can see, the variety of terms used to describe the men who designed sets is indicative of the inherent flexibility of the profession. A late 1930's addition to art direction vocabulary was the concept of production design. In order to recognize William Cameron Menzies1 unique contribution to 26George James Hopkins, \"From 'Then' to 'Now',\" Production Design for the Society of Motion Picture Art Directors 2, no. 5 (May, 1952): 8. 27Hans Dreier, \"Designing the Sets,\" in We Make the Movies, ed. Nancy Naumburg (New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 1937), 82. 19 Gone With the Wind, David O'Selznick in 1939 created the screen credit \"Production Designer.\" The term expands the art director's role in that it credits a film to the one who created the entire visual \"look\" of the film. In today's films, the art director has retaken the responsibilities assigned to a 1930s production designer. Since the position of production designer occurred rather late in the history of art direction and was primarily used on special or big pictures such as musicals, the term will not be used because MGM still used the screen credit \"Art Director\" to cover all artistic direction throughout the thirties. REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE The literature on Cedric Gibbons is scant and often unreliable. What does exist is a plethora of information on the evolution of set design rather than biographical information. From film's earliest beginnings, the importance of good design was strongly emphasized.28 Interestingly, there were many articles on the neglected art of movie set design and how it was grossly misunderstood by producers and the public. From the 28Good design meant getting rid of the fussy Victorian furniture and flocked or flowered wallpaper. Simplicity, restraint, and a clear idea of what the scene really called for were some of the characteristics of good design. 20 'teens through the present day, this \"misunderstanding\" has continued to appear in the literature. Before World War I, film struggled to gain acceptance as an entertainment form; by the twenties, it was being considered an art form. One benefit of this acceptance was that well-known artists were being lured by studios to paint backdrop scenery. As sets became more three dimensional, another art, architecture, made itself felt in production design. During the 1920's the architectural profession thoroughly involved itself in motion pictures as evidenced by four articles written in 1920-1921 in American Architect. The articles focused either on how architects could assist set design with their particular structural and intellectual expertise or on how set design, if properly handled could influence the American public's knowledge of architecture. In 1925, Cecil B. DeMille wrote an article for the Allied Architects Association of Los Angeles on the importance of motion pictures in educating audiences about good architecture. DeMille acknowledged that: Motion Pictures have more to do with Architecture than the layman and architect realizes . . . as the art of Motion Pictures has developed so also has architecture.2 9 29 Cecil B. DeMille, \"Motion Pictures and Architecture,\" Allied Architects Association of Los Angeles Bulletin 1 (July 1, 1925): n.p. 21 Although DeMille was enthusiastic about the importance of architecture in motion pictures, there was growing criticism by the architectural community on the use of architecture in film by the end of the twenties. One architect called architecture in motion pictures, \"rather a thin diet for an architect concerned in the creation of real buildings.\"30 Over the next two decades there would be continual debate in the art and architecture literature about the importance of architecture in motion pictures as an educational experience for the public. Motion picture production may have taken a step backwards with the advent of sound, but in contrast, the field of set design continued to expand in scope. By the 1930s art direction reached a level of sophistication that was not to change until the appearance of color in films. Art direction's importance in the 1930s production system can be seen in the many \"behind the scenes\" articles and books published during that decade. Since motion pictures were such a popular form of entertainment, it was only natural that its audience would be curious as to how films were made. Experts in various fields were asked to contribute to these articles. For example, art directors such as Hans Dreier, Cedric Gibbons, and William Cameron Menzies, frequently wrote pieces on different aspects of 30 Sterner, \"Architect Goes to the Movies,\" The Arts 14 (November 1929): 167. 22 art direction for a wide variety of publications. These men, along with Van Nest Polglase, were also the most frequently interviewed by the literary community. Written material on art direction in the forties dwindled considerably. The most likely reasons for the decline in interest were the advent of World War II and its economic effect on large film productions. The post­ war emphasis on color and location shooting, as opposed to using a studio sound stage, and the growing awareness of European cinema, also had a powerful effect on the \"Classical Hollywood\" form of art direction. Articles on art direction continued to decrease over the next two decades. The seventies saw a renewed interest in the field with Leon Barsacq's book Caligari's Cabinet and Other Grand Illusions. The book was the first seminal study of the history of film sets and has become a \"classic\" on the subject. In addition to chronologically examining set design, Barsacq, a former French art director, thoroughly investigates set design's contribution towards creating the atmosphere or mood of a film. He also devotes considerable time to the conceptualization process involved in making a set. Perhaps because of foreign prejudice, Barsacq is critical of the Hollywood style of set design, calling it \"too administrative with not enough spontaneous creativity.\"31 31Barsacq, 56. 23 His chapter on set design in the United States covers MGM's elaborate style extensively. He chides Gibbons for never having actually designed an MGM set, as well as for having taken all the artistic credit. The \"classical Hollywood\" method of art direction also received attention in the seventies from two museum exhibitions: one at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the other at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. These museums endeavored to recognize the achievements of art directors by exhibiting their works and by issuing comprehensive catalogs. The British exhibition catalogue, The Art of Hollywood is divided into sections, each section devoted to one of the five major studios and the art directors most prominent in those studios. The chapter on Cedric Gibbons is one of the longest but most disappointing because the information presented is a rehash of previously published literature. Authors John Hambley and Patrick Downing label Gibbons the\" movie star of art directors.\"32 Although they cite Gibbons's thirty year employment at MGM and lack of space, the authors do not do justice to Gibbons' career when they list only the Academy Award winning films for art direction and pictures where the unit art director is given credit. 32Hambley, 53. 24 The Museum of Modern Art's tribute to art directors is best described by Mary Corliss and Carlos Clarens in an issue of Film Comment.3 3 The exhibition with its mundane title \"Designed for Film: The Hollywood Art Director\" more fully illuminates the development of American set design through interviews with eleven studio art directors whose careers spanned the silents to the present day. The authors' approach is slanted in a slightly different manner than their British counterparts 1; clearer distinctions are made between an art director's personal contribution and the collaborative process involved in creating a visual style in a film. This article places more emphasis on the studio style than in the Art of Hollywood. Each art director exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art's show spent time working in the art department at MGM. They had valuable insights into Gibbons the man, and into the functioning of the art department. The excitement and creativity of the art department under Gibbons is readily apparent. Corliss and Clarens have done an invaluable service by letting the interview subjects directly reveal the inner workings of the studio art departments, as well as the characters of the men who worked under them. The authors sum up the essay by 3 3 Corliss, 27. 25 noting, \"The interviews . . . represent a blueprint of the art director's mind.\"34 Current interest in set design has changed from emphasizing certain art directors to discussing the prevalent design styles in the movies during the twenties thirties. Howard Mandelbaum and Eric Myers. in their Screen Deco: A Celebration of High Style in Hollywood, discuss the importance of the Art Deco style in motion pictures. Extensively illustrated, but short on text, the authors1 premise is that movies are the perfect medium to display Art Deco because their plots encompass the same ideals as the style. Chapters in the book are divided into various types of sets, i.e. bathrooms, living rooms, bedroom, etc. There is a lengthy discussion on the various terms used to describe \"Art Deco\" and the problems involved in attributing certain set designs to one art director. Mandelbaum and Meyers provide a strong case for the existence of two types of art directors: the executive type, like Cedric Gibbons, and the production designer type, like William Cameron Menzies. Many other authors refuse to acknowledge that two types could exist within the industry and still exert a considerable influence in 3 4 Ibid., 32. 26 the field. Typically, sides were taken, each camp claiming their preferred type was better than the other. The book also mentions the rarely acknowledged fact that Cedric Gibbons attended the 1925 Paris Exposition des Art Decoratifs et Industriels, where Art Moderne/Art Deco received considerable attention. The Exposition was to have a substantial effect on Gibbons and the MGM sets. Although the book is not an comprehensive analysis of Art Deco in the movies, it is a good beginning. In a recently published book, Designing Dreams: Modern Architecture in the Movies, Donald Albrecht discusses the 1920s and 1930s in terms of the influence of modern architecture on movie sets. Ke redefines Art Deco by using the architecture term \"Moderne.1 1 His thesis is based on the idea that the movies plagiarized Moderne, the new modern architectural style. In doing so, film, a nonthreatening, accepted media, exposed the general public to film's version of this radical style. Albrecht, in terms of set design, attempts to bridge the gap between the fantasy of the movies and the reality of contemporary architectural design. Albrecht conveys the evolution of the use of modern architecture in set design, but fails to provide an adequate definition of \"modernism\". In primarily concentrating on architectural or product design and how it is portrayed in film, Albrecht 27 does not completely link the technical side of film to its mechanical nature. Through a variety of technical processes, film can manipulate time and space. In manip­ ulating these elements, a motion picture set may pervert the reality it is attempting to mimic. Albrecht believes that this perversion helped to impede the general acceptance of the Moderne style in American society. Albrecht also states that Gibbons felt that he was a champion of the Moderne style because he designed his own house in that style. \"Gibbons viewed himself not as a slavish imitator of his more exalted brethren [architects] but as an equal partner in the promotion of modern architecture in the United States.\"35 Albrecht believes that, in fact, Gibbons's was guilty of the distorting the style in his own films. Albrecht also examines the role of the studio in promoting modern design in its movies. The major studios, MGM, Paramount, and RKO, created a large body of \"modern designed\" films. Albrecht spends considerable time analyzing MGM, its art director Cedric Gibbons, and his importance in developing modern movie decor. He downplays Gibbons's actual design input, instead crediting Gibbons with the establishment of a distinct studio style and, at 35Donald Albrecht, Designing Dreams: Modern Architecture in the Movies (New York: Harper & Row and The Museum of Modern Art, 1986), 90. 28 the same time, a deft manipulation of the best creative design talent. Albrecht fails to realize that the success of this \"modern\" style in MGM films could be due to Gibbons's own preference for the style or to the fact that the art department contained many architects who were familiar with the style's form. Albrecht also ignores the MGM art department's familiarity with the new archi­ tectural principles of open planning, space, geometric forms, and style that could have come from the well- stocked MGM Research Library. An architect himself, Albrecht is rather blind to the role that architects and architectural precepts played in the MGM art department. Both Screen Deco and Designing Dreams shed light on the Art Deco and Moderne architectural movements in motion pictures but do not contribute any significant discussion of how or why Cedric Gibbons had such a long distinguished career in art direction. The authors agree that Gibbons was more of an executive who created the \"MGM style\" than an artistic designer. Both books have little discussion of the internal workings of the art department and how it might have contributed to the \"style.\" GIBBONS'S OWN LITERARY CONTRIBUTIONS Gibbons wrote a variety of articles on set design, the functions of an art department, and good basic interior design. It is through his own writings that one 2 5 has a better understanding of the man. His writings reveal a very sophisticated, versatile, and well-educated man. An early essay on set design for Encyclopaedia Britannica (1929) shows that he was well aware of the history of American set design and the contributions of its early practitioners, Wilfred Buckland and Gibbons’ own mentor Hugo Ballin. His explanation of what qualities make a good set and what qualifications are necessary to become a good set designer/art director are clearly stated. There is no doubt of Gibbons' preference for modern settings. He called them the most architecturally realistic. His is an optimistic outlook about the future of art direction, hoping set design will be as completely modern as modern painting or sculpture.36 Gibbons also applied his principles of set design to interior design. In an article written in Ladies1 Home Journal, a middle class woman's magazine, he made the comparison between movie set design and good home interior design. To Gibbons, an interior and its furnishings were only a background for the action taking place and the people who live in it; the setting or interior must suit the personalities involved. He finished the article by making what he felt were tasteful suggestions on how a housewife could decorate her home. The article gives the 3 6 Encyclopaedia Britannica, 14th ed. (1929-36), s.v. \"Motion Picture Sets,\" by Cedric Gibbons. 30 impression that Gibbons was a man who believed simplicity was the basis for all good design, whether it be for a home or for a motion picture set. Cedric Gibbons was so confident about his style and preferences that he had no trouble in explaining them to housewives as well as to colleagues. RESEARCH PROCEDURES While primary and secondary sources are limited in their quantities, there is still enough information to reexamine Gibbons's career and significance. The research methods used in this study consist of consulting all secondary sources on set design, art direction, art and architecture styles and movements related to the early twentieth century. In addition, I examined all secondary sources on Cedric Gibbons. Sorting out certain biographical information proved to be difficult. I relied on an interview with Hazel Brooks, Gibbons' second wife, to correct some of the information. Interviews with three former MGM art directors provided a considerable amount of illuminating data on the studio, the organization and operations of the art department, and the education of an architect in the twenties and thirties. Interviews with two former librarians in the MGM Research Library gave further 31 insights into their own functions and how they related to the running of the art department. Original inter-office memorandums, other corre­ spondence, and personal papers can often be the most revealing about a studio, its operations, and various personal relationships with its staff. Very little of MGM's studio archives exist, and what files do only hint at how the art department functioned. Cedric Gibbons left no personal papers. The availability of these papers could have cleared up missing holes in his early education and career. In order to establish a framework for Cedric Gibbons's place in the history of art direction, the next chapter discusses the beginnings of set design in Europe and in the United States. Included in the chapter is a discussion of the development of the title of Art Director and the evolution of the position's responsibilities. How Cedric Gibbons' education and training influenced his design perspective and career at MGM are subjects of the second chapter. The different twentieth century art and architectural movements set the context from which to view Gibbons' early education, European travels, Art Student League years, and apprenticeship in his father's architecture office. The third chapter presents the main premise of the thesis: the organization of the MGM art department along 32 the lines of a large architectural office and the two organizations' similarities and differences. The chapter begins with a discussion of Gibbons' employment at the Edison and Goldwyn studios and with the different management styles of the art directors he worked under. Gibbons' own conception of a Supervising Art Director is compared to other studios' description of the same position. To show how Gibbons exerted his influence and control over his staff, the various steps in designing a film set are discussed. Because Gibbons's tenure at MGM included two different styles of production methods, Irving Thalberg's and later Louis B. Mayer's, these two styles will be discussed in terms of how they influenced the art department and the use of the modernistic style of set design. A particular style of art, or, in this case, of set design, does not exist in a vacuum. The final chapter will show how the \"MGM modernistic style\" films reflected American culture of the 1920s and 1930. Cedric Gibbons own design for the Oscar statue, his design for his home in the foothills of the Santa Monica mountains, and his own writings in magazines and journals are discussed in light of this culture. 33 CHAPTER ONE In the late nineteenth century, emphasis and experimentation in the cinema focused not on aesthetic qualities but on developing technologies for a picture recording device. The American William K. Dickson may have been one of the first to develop a motion picture camera for Thomas Edison in 1888, but it was the French who realized the potential of motion pictures to depict reality. This idea would have a dramatic affect on set design.1 The Lumiere brothers, Auguste and Louis, invented the Cinematographs, an apparatus that was a camera, projector, and film editor all in one. Lighter in weight than the Edison Kinescope, the Cinematographe could be taken outdoors. The Lumieres's first film, La Sortie des Ouvriers de l'Usine Lumiere (1895) was a documentary showing workers leaving the Lumiere factory. The brothers produced films, calling them \"actualites\" (documentary 1 There are many books on the history of motion pictures but none of them incorporate set design with the history of narrative film as well as David A. Cook's A History of Narrative Film. Lewis Jacob's The Rise of the American Film: A Critical History and William K. Everson's American Silent Film deal only with American set design with no foreign influences. Leon Barsacq's Caligari1s Cabinet and Other Grand Illusions: A History of Film Design does not integrate the development of narrative film with set design. 34 views) with their themes revolving around such everyday occurrences as a train's arrival, a baby's lunch, or a gardener being squirted in the face by a hose. The content was more documentary than scripted in these \"actualites.\" The point of view remained static, the action being filmed in one long continuous sequence. The notion of editing this \"new reality\" was an unknown technique. Until the turn of the century, the tendency in filmmaking was to record events. While these early films focused on aspects of every day life, it was really an imitated reality that early filmmakers were producing. There was little notion that a camera could create a narrative reality as well as record a real or staged event. One of the first to discover the narrative aspects of film in 1895 was the Frenchman, Georges Melies. Describing himself as a \"born artist,\" he was a professional magician. He discovered the illusionistic aspects of film while watching the Lumiere Cinematographe programs. While shooting in a Parisian street, a fortuitous accident occurred: Melies's camera jammed and a bus he was shooting was replaced by a hearse when he started to film again. He discovered that film did not have to obey laws of empirical reality, that it could have its own laws. The discovery was important to the 35 development of narrative film, but Melies did not expand upon his discovery. He still kept the camera in a stationary position and had the figures or objects move in relation to the camera. The concept of alternative points of view within the scene or between the scenes was still to come. Melies went on to produce many narrative productions. His familiarity with the French legitimate stage led him to use it as a model for his films. Using techniques from theater spectacles, still photography, and magic lantern, he produced many of the narrative devices of fade-in and fade-out, lap dissolve, and stop motion photography that are so common to film today. His trademark became optical effects, and he used them in conjunction with his newly invented narrative techniques in such films as Cinderella (1899), A Trip to the Moon (1902), and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1907). While he did produce films of contemporary events, calling them actualites reconstitutes (\"reconstructed newsreels\"), his most memorable films concerned the fantastic and bizarre acted out before lush phantasmagoric backgrounds that he designed and painted himself.2 Melies was interested in transforming what he saw into what he imagined. 2 David A. Cook, A History of Narrative Film (New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 1981), 15. 3 6 Melies was also one of the first to think about set design. Because of certain economic and time demands and the particular subjects of his films, he turned to theatrical-painted sets for his backgrounds. Using trompe l'oeil (\"fool the eye\")3, a scenery technique used in the theater of that time, he was able to create perspectives with an impression of relief that suggested illusion and depth.4 He differed from stage designers as he avoided colors. He did use color in a special way; it was added to the film after the film was developed in a hand-painted process. According to Melies, \"Color sets looked terrible on film. Blue becomes white; reds, greens, and yellows become black, totally destroying the effect.\"5 He painted his sets in scales of grey and black that resembled photography studio backgrounds. Melies's sets were rather primitive, consisting of three canvases: a large canvas covered frame flanked on either side by smaller frames that formed an obtuse angle with the main frame. The canvases were painted on the floor and then erected. Often a simple backdrop provided 3A type or representation in painting in which the illusion of form, space, light, and texture has been contrived to convince the viewer that what he perceives is the actual subject matter. 4 Barsacq, 6. 5 Ibid. 37 the necessary background. At other times the canvases could be quite complex. For example, all furniture, clocks, mantles, and pictures were painted on these surfaces. Even the floor was covered with a canvas that was painted to simulate a wood floor, carpet or tiles. Melies also made sketches for his sets. His drawings showed that he was very interested in the visual elements. The general appearance of the atmosphere, the mechanisms for special effects, the movements of characters, as well as the props and furniture, were studied and noted in minute detail on these sketches. Melies worked under primitive conditions and still managed to give the audience his impression of \"reality.\" He was not the first to be original, but he did see moving pictures as an art form. With this concept, he was one of the first to discover the laws governing film sets: the illusion of depth as achieved by a judicious choice of the elements composing the set, their detailed and realistic execution, and, finally, their effective presentation.6 While other filmmakers were experimenting with the same techniques and methods, Melies established the traits of the filmmaker prototype: inventor, director, designer, actor, and entrepreneur. These newly created attributes 6 Ibid. 38 were not to change until the development of the studio system in the middle 'teens. Melies dominated French cinema from 1896 to 1905, but was unable to keep up with the rapid technological changes and the intense rivalries of other French film companies. The two film companies that were the major competition for Melies were Pathe Freres and Gaumont Pictures. Both companies were started in the late nineteenth century; Pathe dominated the industry until 1913 when Gaumont took over and continued until 1920. Pathe was known for its \"actualites reconstitutes,1 1 one-reel melodramas, historical romances, fantasies, and farces. Gaumont gained its dominance through its detective serial, Fantomas, directed by Louis Feuillade, who later set French cinema on the road to poetic realism. Both of these companies created industrial empires that had an influence on set design. The companies are credited with establishing motion picture theaters and forming permanent film crews for specific jobs. For example, a crew would be hired to paint, build sets, and create all of the special effects. Borrowed from the French Opera and theaters, designers and painters were put in charge of set conceptualization and special effects. In 1907, Gaumont hired Henri Menessier to direct its design department. From their beginnings, Pathe and Gaumont carried on an intense competition for the French film audience. In 39 terms of advancing set design, they still retained the theatrical trompe l'oeil perspectives, managing only to refine the painting techniques. Scenery was still painted on canvases tacked to the floor, the designer drawing the design in charcoal on the canvas. If a scene involved more complicated architectural structures, the designer made a small sketch of the structure, squaring it for enlargement (a technique used by fresco painters). The scenic painter then worked standing, walking on the canvas using long-handled brushes to paint the scene. Straight lines were drawn with a ruler attached to a long handle. Finally, the finished product was judged from the top of a ladder. The canvases were attached to wooden frames or to vertical poles so they could easily be rolled up for storage.7 Special effects, such as rising and setting suns and moons, undulating waves, cars and trains in motion, and collapsing walls were under the guidance of designer/ painters. Most of these special effects were achieved by simply using theatrical devices such as trap doors and invisible wires. Also, during this period, small scale models became a popular method for shooting some effects. Until 1908, French films consisted mainly of comic, trick, or \"slice of life\" subjects; little attention was 7 Ibid., 9. 40 paid to the aesthetic qualities of a picture. In 1908, the Societe Film d'Art Company changed all that. The founders, the Lafitte brothers, decided to transfer prestigious stage plays starring well-known actors to the screen. Their purpose was to lend a sense of respectability to moving pictures by making them more intellectual and aesthetically pleasing. To achieve this, they recruited established French playwrights and actors from the Comedie Frangaise. For set designs, the company hired Emile Bertin, a scenic designer also from the Comedie Frangaise.8 Their first success was The Assassination of the Due de Guise (1908). With all their good intentions, though, the Lafitte brothers did little to promote expressive camerawork as a means of enhancing the aesthetics of film. The company's directors were still using a stationary camera to photograph their plays. The company may have employed the best creative talent to tell, plan, and execute their films, but failed to use the medium creatively. As with most successful cinematic innovations, other film companies followed in the Lafittes' footsteps. Pathe and Gaumont were quick to utilize the same technique of borrowing literary and theatrical repertoires and using them in their film productions. 8He was later responsible for guiding French film towards constructed scenery. 41 From 1908 to 1914, French methods of production were perfected and filmmakers moved to a broader concept of scenic design. There was an increase in exterior shots incorporated into movies filmed in the studio. This new idea forced designers to expand beyond their theatrical conceptions to recreating reality. Audiences were also becoming more discriminating. It was no longer enough to paint furniture and fixtures, particularly when a door painted on a canvas would shake whenever it was touched. It was not long before painted scenery turned into constructed scenery. If a painted door could be replaced by a plywood door, it would only be a short time until other painted objects such as mantels, furniture, and moldings also would be replaced. The first French film to use sets constructed of plywood frames was L1Aiglon in 1914. Using plywood, hard board, and a new material called staff9, the designer, Emile Bertin, drew and built a drawing room for the picture. The use of these materials created new specialists and craftsmen such as carpenters, sculptors, experts in staff work, and house painters. Italy was another country to make a significant contribution to set design before World War I. In fact, Italian set designers were considerably ahead of French 9A material made from hemp fiber and plaster of Paris. Staff was used to create moldings and ornaments. 42 set designers. During the years 1890-1914 while French and German filmmakers were concerned with one-reel melodramas, fantasies, trick or newsreel films, Italian filmmakers were developing a new genre, \"the spectacle,\" a staple in film style for generations to come. Italy has had a long pictorial tradition and is known for combining that tradition in architectural settings. One need only think of such fresco painters as Giotto, Lorenzetti, Mantegna, and Michelangelo, and their respective works to see how natural it was for Italian filmmakers to produce this new genre of \"the spectacle\" in architectural form. Italian painter/designer, Enrico Guazzoni, was the first to experiment with constructed sets. He designed the gigantic sets for Brutus (1910) and Cabiria (1913). Cabiria, considered the prototype of the \"spectacular\" film, as well as a landmark in film scenery, established the criteria for spectacle films. Cabiria1s main set, a reconstruction of an exotic Carthaginian palace, is scaled larger-than-life. Inspired by a Hindu temple, the set had huge gold elephants that carried on their backs capitals that supported the roof of the palace. Frescoes, mosaics, and marble floors lent a sense of realism to the scene. Perspective was created by using successive columns and sculpture, opening bays and doors. Other means of creating depth were provided by 43 alternating levels of stairs and landings and the use of electric lighting to produce shadows. The sense of nobility created by the sets is reminiscent of a fifteenth century Italian painting or fresco rather than what the Italian theater was currently producing. Cabiria laid the foundation for use of constructed scenery that was to replace the methods of trompe l'oeil. Italian filmmakers also made another contribution to set design by using architects as designers. Along with its artistic heritage, Italy also has a strong archi­ tectural history. The cities of Florence, Rome, and Venice are filled with structures designed by the famous architects Brunelleschi, Alberti, Bramante, and Michelangelo. For Italian filmmakers, the architect with his knowledge of period styles and architectural construction materials would be most capable of replacing stage designers and scenic painters as film set designers. Film production in the United States occurred simultaneously with that in Europe. Similar to French and Italian companies, America’s first productions were centered around the camera itself and film processing methods. Cameramen such as William K.L. Dickson, Billy Bitzer, and Edwin S. Porter selected the subject matter, staged it according to how they had selected the various elements of setting, and filmed it using the most advanced technological and photographic possibilities. The final 44 steps involved developing and editing the film.10 From the first experiments in moving pictures of American filmmakers, there was a stronger interest in narrative than with the European filmmakers. America's Melies was Edwin S. Porter. He took Melies1s experiments and expanded them through the process of cross-cutting exterior and interior shots to depict parallel actions happening at the same time.11 Whether or not Porter's film accomplished this new narrative feat, his film, The Great Train Robbery (1903) certainly did. Porter cuts between his scenes without dissolving or fading and without playing them to the end.12 Porter defined the \"shot\" as the basic element of cinematic language. In contrast, Melies, the Lumiere brothers, and Edison used the \"scene\" as the basic unit of their films. 10David Bordwell, Janet Staiger, and Kristin Thompson, The Classical Hollywood Cinema: Film Style and Mode of Production to 1960 (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985), 116. 11 There is some disagreement among scholars as to whether Porter's film Life of an American Fireman accomplishes this process. There are two prints in existence: the Museum of Modern Art's \"Cross Cut Version\" shows twenty separate shots linked by dissolves or strait cuts; another print based on a paper print filed for copyright at the Library of Congress by Edison Company in 1903 simply repeats the entire interior sequence and the exterior sequence with no intercutting between them. For further discussion and references see David A. Cook's A History of Narrative Film, pages 20-24. 12 Cook, 24. 45 An American may have discovered the basic element of narrative film, but America filmmakers paid little attention to set design. From 1890 to 1914, American set design paralleled the same basic European set design developments. The concept of motion pictures as a form of entertainment prevailed in the United States from 1890 to 1914, although there were attempts in the literature to validate them as a serious art form by linking it with the traditional arts of architecture, painting, and sculpture. Early directors and producers felt the primary function of sets was to evoke an atmosphere or to suggest as realistic a milieu as possible. In order to portray a realistic environment, directors and producers, like their European counterparts, called on one of the established art forms, the American theater. Scenic theater painters were hired to paint backdrops and prop men became important members of the production crew. The process of painting scenery was similar to French methods. Canvas was the main material used; doors, windows, mantelpieces, and other objects were painted on the canvas. The finished canvas was then attached to a wooden frame. Walls of interior sets generally were constructed of compressed paper or light board backed up with framework or props. Since the camera remained stationary, only two walls of a room needed to be built. To ease dismantling, wall scenery was built in sections or 46 panels. These panels could be assembled in different combinations, and, therefore, could be used again in another movie. Scenic backdrops were still painted in black and white or sepia tones, so as to depict accurately the tonal values in the picture. Color tinting of film was not introduced until 1918-1919. Before 1915, American set design appeared to have no guiding principle. Simple elegance was unheard of in early sets, and \"Just fake it\" was a frequent slogan.13 Directors showed little consideration for a room's purpose. For example, a rich man's parlor usually contained overcrowded furniture, several fur rugs, flowered or flocked velvet wallpaper, overstuffed velvet armchairs, and a grand piano or gaudy electrolier.14 This excessiveness in interior decoration was supposed to convey the sense of wealth. It usually suggested, though, that the director, in cramming as many elaborate effects as he could into as little space as possible, had not thought much about how the set affected the scene as a whole. To complicate matters, sets often had to be ready in fifteen minutes, making assembly speed a high priority in the design of a set. 13Wray Bartlett Physioc, \"Scenic Art in Motion Photography,\" The Moving Picture World 12 (4 May, 1912): 405. 14Alfred A. Cohn, \"The Art Director,\" Photoplay 10 (August 1916): 42. 47 As early as 1912, there was criticism of the excessive use of elaborate effects in American films. Wray Physioc complained: Unfortunately most of the pictures we see are so over crowded with properties of no artistic merit that the composition of the set suggests confusion and renders it completely at variance with any sense of proportion.15 In the same article, he describes seeing a drawing room whose walls were covered with arabesque ornaments, shapely nymphs, and cherubs. Physioc thought the room was completely out of context in terms of conveying the leisure activities that should go on in the room. He felt the room should belong in a Chamber of Horrors Museum! Restraint, simplicity, and less imitation were his suggestions for improving the aesthetic qualities of sets.16 If these qualities were used properly, crudeness could be avoided. The duty of creating this ’’proper atmosphere\" of refinement and simplicity of style in set decoration fell on the shoulders of the scenic artist. Since European film production was suspended during World War I, the American film industry, little affected by the war, became the dominant source for movie enter- 15Wray Bartlett Physioc, \"Restraint in Interior Decoration,\" The Moving Picture World 12 (25 May 1912): 714. 16 Ibid. 48 tainment. During this time, American film production methods were standardized. Features began to dominate one-reelers and there was also a greater sophistication in interframe narration. By increasing the importance of portraying realism in American films, these two developments had a substantial impact on set design. Producers were actively ensuring that realism was being depicted in their pictures. It was important that audiences not realize that scenes were really improvised backgrounds or that furniture was borrowed from studio property rooms: the public had to forget the mechanical process of the picture. By the mid 'teens, audiences were becoming in­ creasingly more sophisticated in their moving picture tastes, demanding better stories and sets. Producers could no longer get away with just a good storyline and fair acting, and their \"hit and miss\" methods of set design were no longer acceptable. Furthermore, viewers were more observant, letting film companies know by way of letters, that they did not like seeing the same sets reused in other films.17 Consequently, producers and directors realized that poorly scripted films could be enhanced by elegant backgrounds. Attention to simplicity 17Lescarboura, Austin C., \"In the Land of Make Believe,\" chapter in Behind the Motion Picture Screen (New York: Scientific American Publishing Co., 1919): 120. 49 in interior decoration and a refined sense of taste in ornamentation and costuming were stressed by producers. Ornate lamps, tables, mantels, bric-a-brac, and heavy drapery could still be found in many pictures. It was difficult to let go of the idea that these objects represented gentility and elegance even though on the screen they conveyed the opposite feeling. As American production methods stabilized around 1910, there was a shift from the mechanical cameraman system to a director/producer system. Standard working procedures included a producer and a large, departmentalized studio staffed with technical specialists. Cameramen were freed of the responsibilities of casting, directing, and editing, and they now applied themselves to experimenting with composition, lighting, and better camera equipment. As the camera became lighter and more flexible in its mobility, there was no need to shoot from a stationary position. Objects, actors, and actresses could be moved or rearranged to make a better composition. Scenes were no longer filmed in chronological order. As directors like Maurice Tourneur and Cecil B. DeMille saw the potential for not lighting the entire set, lighting was adjusted to suit a particular mood. In three dimensional sets, American filmmakers progressed along the same path as the French and Italians. 50 One of the first to use constructed sets extensively was David Wark Griffith. Following in the footsteps of the Italians, Griffith produced some of the most grandiose sets to be seen in American film, Intolerance (1916) being his most ambitious film. The story is about all the \"powers of intolerance as they had endangered civilization throughout human history.\"18 Griffith set important precedent for American set design by sparing no expense in erecting the film's mammoth sets. He also took an active role in designing many of the sets, as seen in his scrapbook drawings now in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He also hired Walter W. Hall to design each of the four historical periods represented in the film. The director's control in authentically reproducing an era, though, remained very important to Griffith. Settings, Griffith described: Must not only be made beautiful or suggestive of the mood and moment of the play. And the poor director can not trust this to anyone.19 Griffith went to great lengths to research the correct settings and designs for his film, and often took liberties with those scholarly findings. Griffith's goal was to create a world suggestive of a particular 18 Cook, 92. 19Floyd M. Martin,, \"D.W. Griffith's 'Intolerance': A Note on Additional Visual Sources,\" Art Journal 43 (Fall 1983): 231. 51 historical point in time, not to copy exactly the conclusions of scholarly research. The most extravagant set in Intolerance was a full scale reproduction of a Babylonian palace. The set covered more than ten acres of land, stood three hundred feet in the air, and could hold 4,000 extras. One hundred and sixty-five foot towers graced the set, as well as huge ramparts on which full-sized chariots could speed along. Griffith may have surpassed the Italians in projecting spectacle on the screen with his Babylonian set, but his other Intolerance sets were reminiscent of the staid French theatrical style of the Societe de l’Art productions. The film also established criteria for how certain scenes were to be depicted in the future. Realistic sets and costumes were required for scenes connected with either the history or daily life in the United States, but when the subject was foreign or ancient history, there was freedom to use one’s imagination. Griffith was not the only director to make an important contribution to American set design. Cecil B. DeMille brought art direction to Hollywood in 1914. His early sets were ornate, but not as spectacular as his later ones. He hired a well-known New York theatrical set designer, Wilfred Buckland, and an international artist, Paul Iribe to design the \"look” of 52 his films. During their reign at the Lasky Studio, DeMille and Buckland developed the \"Lasky Lighting,\" where figures, faces, and interiors were lit by a warm, glowing light that created depth through shadows and modeling.20 Another director, Thomas Ince, known for building one of the first large Hollywood studios, was instrumental in integrating built sets with an exterior landscape. His action-packed western productions naturally displayed this new method of set design. Ince built a western town set into a California hillside to enhance the realism of his productions. By 1919, most of the major production crafts had been established. As a result, moving picture sets were showing signs of sophistication in their designs. There was recognition of the importance of the role of set design by producers and directors, and care was now being taken to achieve exacting depictions of reality. Once producers and directors finally began to recognize the significance of set design for the film industry, the crafts involved in set design began to be departmentalized. Painted backdrops gave way to spaces to be filled up with constructed forms, real furniture, and props. Art direction now had a distinct and complex purpose and required its own department in the studio. 20Macgowan, 74. 53 Toward the end of the 'teens, another profession made itself felt in set design. Painted flats and props gave way to three dimensional sets and real props, and the architectural profession began to take an interest. As early as 1917, it was suggested that moving pictures could offer an opportunity to someone who was versed in archi­ tecture as well as being a master of scene painting, lighting, and photography. Beautiful results could occur from the cooperation of such masters under the supervision of an architect.21 Architects were quick to respond to the needs of the motion picture industry. To an architect, the movies provided structures whose functions were defined by the people who populated them. To him, the architecture in films was related to a specific point in time and space, not to a dead precedent that was to be copied for a client who wanted his house in a particular style.22 During the twenties, the difference between stage and cinematic design became clearer: the former was more decorative, the latter more structural. As a result, studios hired more architects to handle their new structural needs. The American Institute of Architects 21 Benjamin J. Lubschez, \"Moving-Pictures and the Architect,\" Journal of the American Institute of Arts 5, no. 8 (August 1917): 395. 2 2 Ibid. 54 journal, American Architect, even encouraged architects to enter the film industry, suggesting that in motion pictures architects could find freedom from client whims and contractor problems. Working in motion pictures gave an architect the chance to experiment creatively and aesthetically.23 Architects were quick to realize that problems in cinematic settings derived not from different tonal values, but from the wrong adaptation of forms to space. It was a logical step for studios to hire architects who solved similar problems every day for their private clients. The architectural profession also saw another reason for participating in films. The photoplay could be a means of educating the American public as to what constituted good architecture and well-arranged interiors. Historically, architects have complained that their members failed to instill in the public's mind the importance of architecture in mankind's activities.24 Architects' accusations centered around the idea that there was too much imitation of European architecture and not enough development of indigenous design. In other 23___________ , \"The Architecture of Motion Picture Settings,\" The American Architect 118, no. 2324 (7 July 1920): 1-2. 24Ziegler, Carl A., \"Architecture and the Motion Picture,\" The American Architect 119, 2367 (11 May, 1921) : 546. 55 words, architects were supposed to have a social responsibility in influencing and molding public taste; they should not be afraid to express what is truly American in architecture.2 5 There was a real possibility that motion pictures could make architecture understandable to a general audience. Architects reasoned that if enough Americans saw that a certain type of architecture was well suited to a particular environment, Americans would develop new, unique styles of architecture. It was not that Americans were not familiar with the new styles of architecture being promoted through expositions like the Chicago World’s Fair, but rather that films could reach a larger audience than these expositions. If the exposition buildings displayed new trends and gave a sense of grandeur to architecture, so could motion pictures. Most architects were highly optimistic about the contribution to moving pictures that their profession could make, but there also were criticisms. One negative comment was that motion picture architects were not really architects when they created only two or three sided structures with no roofs. In response to that sentiment, architect advocates suggested that architects throughout history had to cope with and satisfy the whims of their 25\"The Architecture of Motion Picture Settings,\" 4. 56 clients, and was not the film industry a client? The impermanence of the movie structures was another criticism leveled against architects designing sets. This was also an unfair accusation, as many exposition buildings were designed to last only a year,26 and historically, even famous architects such as Bernini designed sets for one day theatrical productions. The biggest complaint against movies using architects was that pictures were an unethical breach of an architect's sense of what was art; working for movies smacked of commercialism. Critics reasoned that if an architect worked only for one client, the studio, he was denying himself the opportunity to participate in all design aspects of the profession. Those who felt that architecture was an art were the ones who consistently expressed their distaste and felt that architects who designed sets for motion pictures lowered their professional standards. This argument implied that movies were not an art form, thereby contradicting popular opinion. American set design developed fairly rapidly from painted sets to three dimensional structures that required detailed plans and blueprints to build. The establishment of a position with the responsibility of creating and constructing these complex sets evolved more slowly. 26 Ibid. 57 Early twentieth century film production relied heavily on a director/cameraman system in which one person was also in charge of producing a background for his movie. By 1912, painted backdrops were being used heavily, and the person in charge of painting them was called a scenic artist. When films developed past the infancy stage, set design was still primitive, needing to become less theatrical and more realistic: sets demanded planning, thereby, requiring more cooperation between the scenic painter/designer and the director.27 While the director usually decided what he wanted for his sets, the scenic painter was often responsible for originating set ideas and painting those ideas clearly. The position required distinct concepts of what was to be painted and the ability to express these concepts eco­ nomically. The emphasis on painting clear images became firmly established during this period, but not all studios adhered to the practice.28 Many studios painted their backdrops in color without realizing that when photographed the tonal values would be entirely different. The use of elaborately painted wallpapers was another 27Physioc, \"Scenic Art in Motion Photography,\" 405. 28Clear images meant painting a scene's characteristic qualities perfectly and respecting its limitations. Good tone and composition were primary considerations when designing a backdrop, but a scene was at its best when it was most thoroughly itself. Physioc, \"Scenic Art in Motion Photography.\" p. 405. 58 element that closely conveyed the simplified structure of a scene. Motion picture sets developed further as story plots became more complex. As previously mentioned, audiences became more sophisticated and critical of the lack of realism being portrayed in film. As a result of these changes, the producer controlled the overall production, including the director, scenic painters, stage carpenters and property men. Consequently, the position of Art Director was developed to provide elaborate drawings of sets, camera, and lighting placements, and to supervise the set craftsmen. The director could still provide input into the set design, but the art director was in charge of all aspects of design and construction. The requirements for this new title were basically the same as for the scenic painter, with the same emphasis on having a theatrical background. Toward the end of World War I, American art direction became a permanent feature in film production. As the demand for more accuracy and realism in sets increased, a new type of executive, the Technical Director or Art Director, emerged. This position was not apparent in every studio, as many directors still retained control of a production. The technical director/art director was given specific responsibilities. His primary duty was the supervision, planning, arranging, and erecting of all the 59 sets for the studio. Another responsibility was to provide costumes for the players. Set design had advanced from a director telling a scenic painter what to paint to an art director now reading the scenario and conferring with the director about the appropriate environment for a scene. The director also relied heavily on the technical director/art director to provide the furniture and extra embellishments for sets. Large elaborate sets required the technical director/art director to draw detailed plans and blueprints. Frequently, sets were worked out using cardboard models in order to study lighting and the placement of actors. Characteristics for the position of technical director/art director were quickly established. A person needed to be a well-read, traveled gentleman and a veritable human encyclopedia of technical, architectural, and artistic knowledge. The technical director/art director was given the nickname \"wise guy of the studio\" as he often had to know numerous details. But more importantly, if he did not know what was needed, he had to know where to find it, often on very short notice.29 Producers realized that a picture's well-designed set could help to create a successful film. Also, a bad 29 Cohn, 44. 60 picture could be saved if proper lighting techniques and well-designed sets were employed. The art director was there for a specific purpose: to produce better quality pictures. The creation of the technical director/art director position as a distinct and autonomous function was part of the motion picture industry's evolution into separate production divisions during the 1920s. The art director not the director or producer, was responsible for employing the services of armies of workmen, craftsmen, specialists, technicians, and artists to create his sets. Each subgroup, in turn, had more autonomy. For example, the property man who once provided sets now had his own department, staff, and responsibilities, and reported to the art director. As one can see, a hierarchy was established under the auspices of the technical director. During the years 1912-1916, the trend of hiring prominent theatrical scenic designers such as Wilfred Buckland, Robert Brunton and Hugo Ballin; as well as known academic artists such as Everett Shinn, William Cotton and Will H. Bradley as art directors continued. These men improved art direction with the advent of more realistic and innovative lighting to create depth and compositions that extended beyond the action.30 30Bordwell, 148. As structural integrity became more important in set design, producers engaged architects to plan and supervise the erecting of sets. Even Armando Brasini, the architect for the Vatican in Rome, designed sets for the Italian film Theodora (1921). As American audiences were introduced to the theatrical staging and lighting of European films, European architects such as Hans Dreier, Joseph Urban, and Paul Chalfin were hired to duplicate their efforts in American films. Robert Haas was one of the first American architects to join the motion picture industry as Famous Players-Lasky Production's Architectural Director in their new Art and Decoration Department. It is obvious from the beginning, that the terminology used to describe the creator of sets was flexible. The film industry and the fine arts used the terms \"scenic painter,\" \"art director\" and \"technical director.\" As architects joined the motion picture industry in the 1920s, they contributed to the vocabulary with terms such as \"motion picture architect,\" \"screen architect,\" and \"photoplay architect.\" Although the titles associated with \"art director\" varied from studio to studio, the duties inherent in the position remained essentially the same. Not until the studio system of the 1920s was established did the Art Director/Motion Picture Architect head an autonomous department. Like his 62 predecessors, the Art Director/Motion Picture Architect still read the script, decided on the type of sets to be built for each scene, obtained the director's approval of his sketches, and produced detailed drawings and plans needed to construct the sets. For the larger, more spectacular productions, he also had to oversee the planning and production of miniatures, models, and special effects. Many studios had two separate departments to handle special effects: one for cinematography, the other for art direction. More often than not, the two departments overlapped when it came to producing miniatures, glass shots, and mattes. In this case, the art director/motion picture architect also supervised both special effects departments. The similarity between France, Italy, and the United States in the evolution of set design is due to the simultaneous development of the technical equipment and processes of film in each country. Set design closely mirrors the maturation of film in the early twentieth century. Just as it is difficult to established who built the first movie camera or produced the first narrative, it is almost impossible to pinpoint who made which advances in set design. That these countries progressed from painted sets to constructed sets about the same time is indicative of the mass marketing of each country's films in other countries. Each country relied on theater to 63 give itself a model for their backgrounds, but each of these countries had its own unique style. Thus, each country and studio involved in early filmmaking drew inspiration and technique from similar resources and shared its achievements with the rest of the film industry. Each managed, though, to create an individualist approach to movie making. As motion pictures matured from a novelty enter­ tainment to an art form, art direction and its creators became an important aspect of filmmaking. The fact that in twenty-five years (1895-1920) art direction evolved from a one-person operation into an entire department with an art director as head is a testament to the serious attention modern filmmakers give to the environment in which an actor/actress must exist. This environment, as created by the Art Director, was, and will continue to be, influenced by a number of cultural trends, including movements in art and architecture. 64 CHAPTER TWO The Industrial Revolution had a profound effect on late nineteenth and early twentieth century society, its art, and its architecture: a manually-oriented society became a mechanized one. The Revolution brought modern scientific thought and methods to industrial production which, in turn, opened new avenues, such as industrial design and products, to artists and architects. The city's culture and the products this period's populace produced became the focus and inspiration for many artists and architects. The attainment of a harmonious existence between art and industry was a topic of much concern in the art world, and many art and architecture movements evolved from this concern. The new technology was applied to art and archi­ tecture to create new working materials and new ways of \"seeing.\" The problem of how to incorporate these new materials and visions into the arts and into architecture without diminishing artistic creativity consumed artists and architects throughout the late nineteenth and into the twentieth century. Due to the upheavals of the period, it is almost impossible to find a common denominator that links the numerous social, economic, and artistic elements together. 65 One alliance was forged between art and science. In the arts, scientific method and techniques led to a new objectivity, which branched out into both Realism and Impressionism. Hand-made crafts turned to mechanized means of production, while architects used engineers to create more technically advanced structures. Artists divided themselves into two groups: specialists pursuing a single aspect of a medium as in Impressionism, and experts pushing mechanical concepts to extreme limits in order to reveal deeper psychological insights, as in Expressionism.1 Another invasive idea of the period was the inter­ pretation of experience in terms of time. With the machine, man was only a part of the production process, a fragment of the whole. From this idea a fragmentary, irrational view of the world developed.2 Artists began to focus on the momentary and the disjointed, turning every­ day occurrences into subject matter. Using airy mixtures of colors, sprays of paint, and fleeting shadows to create momentary moods, the Impressionists produced works of art that were deliberately incomplete and ultimately inspirational. Similarly, architects created such 1 For more discussion of these issues, see William Fleming, Arts and Ideas (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc., 1974), 351, 2 Ibid. , 351. 66 buildings as the Crystal Palace, the Galerie des Machines, and the Eiffel Tower, all of which were open to the air and sky and conceived as only temporary structures.3 The uniting of art and science and the continuous flux in time established the foundation on which the various twentieth century modern art and architecture styles evolved. In 1890, Cedric Gibbons was born into this turbulent era. Instead of attending public school, Cedric was tutored at home. At a very early age he developed an interest in painting and sculpture. His father, a successful New York architect, indulged Cedric’s interest in art with a trip to Europe in his 'teens.4 Although politically separated from Europe, Americans turned to the continent for art and culture. Upper-middle and wealthy classes frequently traveled between Europe and the United States in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These trips were to absorb the highly-valued European art and culture by directly experiencing the ancient monuments of Greece and Italy, and the 3 Ibid., 359. 4Although there is no information available on his trip, the following section outlines some of the itinerary; in any case, most of these events, movements, and works of art and architecture were published and discussed in Europe and American art magazines, so both the trip and reading material would have introduced him to the things. 67 architecture and museums of the major European cities. For any American serious about pursuing a career in painting, an extended trip to Europe, especially Paris, was mandatory. For these neophyte artists, the goal was to get into one of the famous academies like the Ecole des Beaux Arts, the Academie Julien in Paris, or the American Academy in Rome. Consequently, there was a large community of American artists studying in Paris at the beginning of the twentieth century. There is no evidence of where Gibbons traveled in Europe, but if he was like his peers, he probably toured the major cities of Europe, Greece, and Italy. Well-known American artist Robert Henri describes his feelings of studying in Paris: The art world [Paris} is here, everything that is of interest in art and history is at hand. Only a step into any of the great countries--they are all at hand. I picture to myself a life of art study, tramps afoot into Italy, thro' France— into Switzerland, Germany— and on, . . . stopping her and there to catch some fine old bit--Visiting famous old places, picture galleries, picking up pebbles or sketching the ruins where gladiators fought, living now in the past, now in the present.5 Cedric may have only been touring Europe, but he probably had the same romantic notions as Henri. 5William Innes Homer, Robert Henri and His Circle (Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1959), 44. 68 The early twentieth century was an exciting time for European art and architecture. It seems that when Gibbons traveled to Europe between the years 1905-1907, he would have seen the beginnings of modern art as well as the remnants of antiquity. A number of movements proliferated in the Paris of the early 1900s. These movements had a tremendous impact on the development of modern art and architecture. For example, while Gibbons was Europe, Paris salons were showing the Impressionists, whose focus emphasized the theme of every day life and urban man as seen through the world of changing colors and light. At the time, these were revolutionary concepts. Also during the early 1900's there was an interest in primitivism that sprang from the proliferation of scientific discoveries and from the conquering of exotic foreign lands in the nineteenth century. The arts of the South Sea Islanders and the wood carvings of African nations were of particular interest to European artists. Primitive art was the antithesis of industrialization, a negation of progress. It brought new ways of looking at color, rhythms, and space that were to have an enduring effect on painting, sculpture, and the decorative arts.6 6 Fleming, 365. 69 Another art movement, Expressionism, was a reaction to Impressionism's atmospheric effects and detached subjects. Expressionist painters emphasized the intensity of emotions, the human imagination, and the subjective reaction, as opposed to the Impressionists' concentration on the quality of light and the representation of nature. One form of Expressionism burst upon the Paris art scene at the 1905 Salon d'Automne. Although indebted to the Impressionists and Post-Impressionist heritage, the represented artists used explosive colors and violently distorted forms in their paintings. Landscapes, portraits, still lifes, and figure compositions became color explorations on canvas. Led by Henri Matisse, the painters Andre Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck, Raoul Dufy, Kees van Dongen, and Georges Braque emphasized the autonomy of color and a directness of expression. A critic named this group Les Fauvres (\"Wild Beasts\") because the exhibition room looked like a \"cage of wild animals.\"7 This short-lived phenomenon strongly affected the development of modern art. Gibbons may or may not have seen this particular exhibit, but he could have seen the following year's Salon d'Automne which featured the Fauvres again. 7Ellen G. Oppenheim, brochure with introductory comments on the Kimbell Art Museum's exhibition \"The Wild Beasts: Fauvism and its Affinities,\" September 11-October 37, 1976, author's collection, [1]. 70 The Paris movements were only a few of many that occurred in the early twentieth century. If Gibbons traveled to the city of Dresden, Germany, he would have probably seen the paintings and wood-cuts of another Expressionist group, the Die Briicke (The Bridge) . This loose confederation of Dresden painters included Ernst Kirchner, Max Pechstein, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, and Emil Nolde. The name Die Briicke exemplified the bridging of all expressionist artists to one another as well as to the future. Their use of brilliant colors, compared to the flamboyant Fauvres, was much harsher and more acidic, their subjects tending to be more psychologically dramatic. Fauvism was one of the first modern art movements in the twentieth century, but there were two nineteenth century art/architecture movements that also served as precursors to modern art: the English Arts and Crafts Movement and the French Art Nouveau. The English Arts and Crafts Movement, founded by William Morris and John Ruskin, was a political struggle to find a national art style. In turning to medievalism for its inspiration, the movement was a reaction against nineteenth century romanticism, the revival of the Classic and Renaissance styles, and industrialization. William Morris was considered the most famous member of the group, although most of the craftsmen worked in anonymity. 71 The movement stressed interior design and producing primarily hand-crafted furniture, wallpapers and chintzes. \"Honesty\" in structural features and the \"fitness of purpose\" became the focal points of the movement.8 The English Arts and Crafts Movement's goal was to educate people, to make them aware that the crafts and craftsmen were worth saving in a world of mechanization. The movement began to die around 1915 when it became so commercially successful that craftsmen began to resort to industrial production methods. An off-shoot of the English Arts and Crafts Movement was a group of Scottish craftsmen and architects who espoused the same philosophy as their English brethren, that of rejecting traditional historical styles. These Scottish artisans and architects made valuable connections with the Vienna Secessionist artists, resulting in a cross-fertilization of ideas. Because of this foreign connection, the Scottish Glasgow School of Design, as the movement was called, was not recognized by English craftsmen; i.e., it did not satisfy the English idea of a \"pure\" British movement. The most famous of the \"Glasgow Four\" was Charles Mackintosh. He designed, decorated, and furnished tea houses and private homes in Glasgow with this new style. 8 Isabelle Anscombe and Charlotte Gere, Arts and Crafts in Britain and America (Feltham, Middlesex: Hamlyn Publishing, 1969), [inside cover]. 72 His most famous project was the addition made to the Glasgow School of Art (1896-1909). Mackintosh designed a very simple and straightforward building without borrowing from historical sources. The building was constructed of masonry and brick, and supported by steel lattice girders and cast iron beams covered in cement. The exterior evoked a mixture of horizontal rhythms and soaring verticals. Such details as large windows encased in wrought iron metal brackets and an asym"
