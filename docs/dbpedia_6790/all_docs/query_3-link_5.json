        "text": "Gladiator\n\nSince the film’s release, Gladiator has gone on to achieve legendary status for Zimmer, from the beautiful, otherworldly ‘Elysium’ to the epic orchestral ‘Honour Him’. The composer uses a simple but great melody throughout his score, pushing Gladiator into the ranks of those movies for which the music is a vital part of its success.\n\nRead more: Hans Zimmer wins Oscar for ‘Dune’, accepts award in his bathrobe\n\nGladiator Soundtrack \"Elysium\", \"Honor Him\", \"Now We Are Free\"\n\nPirates of the Caribbean\n\nZimmer collaborated with Klaus Badelt on ‘The Curse of the Black Pearl’, writing the film’s main themes as a duo. Although critics berated the composers’ work for its lack of connections to the ‘swashbuckling’ genre, Zimmer and Badelt succeeded in creating a score which is both epically beautiful and cheekily evocative of the unpredictable Captain Jack.\n\nRead more: The ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ theme, but it’s played by three electric toothbrushes\n\nPirates of the Caribbean 2 - Soundtr 01 - Jack Sparrow\n\nSherlock Holmes\n\nZimmer famously made use of (and was personally responsible for trashing!) a broken pub piano in his soundtrack to Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes remake. With a score marked for a banjo, cimbalom and ‘squeaky violins’, Zimmer described his soundtrack to Ritchie as \"the sound of The Pogues joining a Romanian orchestra\".\n\nSherlock Holmes Opening Theme\n\nInception\n\nUnbelievably, Zimmer revealed his entire score for the Christopher Nolan film originated from Edith Piaf’s song ‘Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien’ – from the thunderous trombone theme to the threatening semitone-based melody in the violins.\n\nBut, he argued, he should still be eligible for an Oscar for Best Original Score. He told the New York Times: “I didn’t use the song; I only used one note. [I got] the original master out of the French national archives. And then [found] some crazy scientist in France who would actually go and take that one cell out of the DNA.”\n\nHans Zimmer - Time (Official Audio)\n\nThe Dark Knight\n\nZimmer’s trademark technique balances orchestral and electronic sounds, and The Dark Knight is no exception. “It’s about fifty-fifty,” he said. “I never segregate a violin from a synthesiser – both are ways and means of making music.”\n\nZimmer admitted it took him a year to complete the dark, brass-filled score, and described the Christopher Nolan movie as one of the most challenging projects he has ever worked on. “We had so many ideas and never enough hours in the day,” he said. “Put it this way, I got to hang out with some of my demons for a while.”\n\nBatman The Dark Knight Theme - Hans Zimmer\n\nThe Lion King\n\nThe composer won his first Oscar for Disney’s The Lion King (1994), in which he seamlessly blended large orchestral forces with the African choral music of Lebo M and Elton John's songs.\n\nDisney took Zimmer on for a second time in their 2019 live-action remake of the movie, starring Donald Glover and Beyoncé.\n\nRead more: Hans Zimmer didn’t want to score ‘The Lion King’, but his 6-year-old daughter changed his mind\n\nThe Lion King - Hans Zimmer - Lebo M in the Vienna Concert Hall !\n\nDune\n\nWinning Zimmer his second Oscar at the 94th Academy Awards for ‘Best Original Score’, Dune is the latest adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 sci-fi novel of the same name. The film stars Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, and Zendaya, and is set in the year 10,191.\n\nReflecting the far future, Dune is one of Zimmer’s most experimental scores. His use of distorted and electronic sounds creates a deeply immersive futuristic soundtrack, which is further enhanced by the harsh solo voices that weave their way through the music.\n\nDune Official Soundtrack | Paul's Dream – Hans Zimmer | WaterTower\n\nThe Da Vinci Code\n\nZimmer’s religious soundscape, scored with a massive orchestra, chorus and organ, gives you the feeling you’ve just walked into a glorious stained-glass cathedral. Although the film itself had mixed reviews, Zimmer’s epic soundtrack was nominated for the 2007 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score.\n\nDirector Ron Howard said: “Hans Zimmer has given us extraordinarily memorable music to appreciate within the framework of a film or completely on its own, where you can let the sounds carry you on your own private journey.”\n\nHans Zimmer - The Da Vinci Code Orchestra Suite - Pt. 4 (#EnterTheWorldOfHansZimmer)\n\nInterstellar\n\nZimmer and Nolan visited London’s Temple Church to record music on the 1926 Harrison & Harrison organ for the Interstellar soundtrack, creating a surprisingly religious feeling for a science fiction film. On top of the organ, he adds 34 strings, 24 woodwinds and four pianos, as well as a 60-voice choir.\n\nZimmer’s work on Interstellar was nominated for an Academy Award and Original Score at the Hollywood Music in Media Awards.\n\nInterstellar Main Theme - Extra Extended - Soundtrack by Hans Zimmer\n\nPearl Harbor\n\nListening to the Pearl Harbour soundtrack without breaking down into a period of uncontrollable weeping is a feat in itself. The poignant main theme, always played by a piano, is continuously built up with epic crescendos of sweeping strings, backed by a full-sized orchestra.\n\nZimmer’s original work was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score, losing to Moulin Rouge!, and is still considered one of his most beautiful pieces of music to date.\n\nPearl Harbor Soundtrack - Tennessee (Hans Zimmer)"
