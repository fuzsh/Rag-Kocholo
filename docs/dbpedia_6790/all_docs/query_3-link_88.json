        "text": "German composer Hans Zimmer, best known for creating the music to some iconic movie franchises such as “The Lion King” and The Dark Knight trilogy, is officially going on a North American tour for the first time in seven years. It will begin on September 6 in Duluth, Georgia and then end in Vancouver on October 6 so although it will only be for a month, he will still be performing in 17 cities within that time. He has won four Grammys and two Oscars for his film scores and is regarded as one of the best film composers of all time. Therefore, here is a ranking of some of his best movie soundtracks that continue to be listened by people and generations across the globe. (Also just a psa: all of these albums are amazing and Hans Zimmer is a genius. This is just my ranking based on personal preference and awards he has won).\n\nThe Holiday – This isn’t exactly a Christmas movie but it centers around two women who exchange homes for a week to escape heartbreak and boredom during the holiday season in December. Nancy Meyers is the director and it’s one of her most famous movies but I didn’t realize Hans Zimmer was the composer until I did some research. From the beauty that is Jude Law to the humor of Jack Black, the movie is full of romance and it’s no surprise that people rewatch “The Holiday” every year. However, nothing really stands out with the music except for the song “Cry” which is when the character Amanda (played by Cameron Diaz) cries for the first time in decades and runs back to Graham (played by Jude Law) once she realizes she doesn’t want to live without him. The song starts off very slow and heartbreaking but then slowly becomes more hopeful and sweet until it crescendos into the melody that every girl and woman knows well. It’s so easy to picture yourself in a romcom while listening to this song and while Hans Zimmer is still a musical genius, it really is the only highlight of the movie in terms of a film score.\n\nInception – I’ve actually never seen this movie but I’ve heard of it only because Hans Zimmer composed the music for it and all of the songs are super intense, emotional, and really take you on a journey when you listen to them. “Time” is the most famous song off this soundtrack and even though I don’t know the plot of “Inception”, I feel like I understand the whole movie and atmosphere just by listening to this one song. It starts off very quiet and slow but then crescendos into a powerful melody until becoming still and somber again. Hans Zimmer received many nominations during the awards season when Inception came out in 2010 but sadly, he didn’t win any which is one of the reasons why this movie is so low on this list in addition to me never seeing it before.\n\nDune – Dune Part 1 and 2 are still very new movies compared to the rest of the ones on this list but Hans Zimmer did win Best Original Score for “Dune Part 1” in 2022 so it’s important to note how incredible this music is and how it proved that Hans Zimmer is still one of the best when it comes to composing film scores. The only reason why this is so low on the list is because the movies are so new and I haven’t seen either film yet. While I can still listen to the songs and hear the compelling dynamics, I don’t understand the whole vision and reasoning behind his musical choices due to never seeing the movies.\n\nThe Dark Knight – Hans Zimmer won the Grammy for Best Score Soundtrack for a Motion Picture, Television, or Other Visual Media in 2009 for his work on “The Dark Knight” alongside James Newton Howard. It’s easy to see why since the soundtrack encapsulates the mystery and fear behind the masked figure that is Batman and his work on the other two movies of the trilogy is just as fantastic and mesmerizing. It might be a reach but I think one of the reasons why the trilogy had so much buzz at the time and why it’s still so popular is because Hans Zimmer composed for all three. Music really is a huge component of a movie or tv show’s success.\n\nKung Fu Panda – Hans Zimmer teamed up with the legendary John Powell for this beloved movie and they definitely didn’t disappoint. “Sacred Pool of Tears” and “Oogway Ascends” are some iconic songs that people still love to listen to and they definitely pack an emotional punch. Even though Zimmer didn’t win any awards for this movie, the soundtrack is so iconic that it doesn’t matter. Zimmer also did a great job of capturing the traditional chinese music which is peaceful in its meditative nature but also powerful at the right moments. Kung Fu Panda is a franchise that people watch all the time and the music is definitely one of the reasons why the movies are so successful.\n\nGladiator – I have never seen “Gladiator” but after doing some research, it’s clear that this is one of Hans Zimmer’s masterpieces and one of the soundtracks that really put him on the map. He won Best Original Score at the Golden Globes for “Gladiator” and the soundtrack is super impressive with over 20 songs featured on two discs. The soundtrack to “Gladiator” is similar to Inception in that even though I’ve never seen it, I still feel like I’m watching the movie when listening to the songs and genuinely feel like I’m a gladiator fighting in ancient Rome.\n\nInterstellar – Everyone has probably heard the song “Cornfield Chase” at some point in their life even if they didn’t know what it was called because it’s just that iconic. The song has one of the most beautiful and haunting melodies that I’ve ever heard and truly emphasizes the heartbreak that is experienced in this film. While “Cornfield Chase” is the most famous from the movie, there are still plenty of other songs that evoke emotions and power. It’s also one of Zimmer’s longer albums with over 25 songs.\n\nSpirit: Stallion of the Cimarron – Not everyone might know this movie but it’s one that was a huge part of my childhood and the music is absolutely stellar. The music is very diverse from sorrowful ballads to commanding songs that demand the listener’s attention. It really takes you for a journey and it’s hard to remember that this movie is literally about an animated horse since the music is that beautiful and catchy. Some of my favorites include “Here I Am” and “Get Off My Back.” I highly recommend seeing this movie if you haven’t yet.\n\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean – I don’t think I need to say a lot for this franchise because the music in all of these movies is just so iconic and enjoyable to listen to and the songs really do match so many of the characters and scenes that take place. “The Pirates of the Caribbean” theme song is arguably one of the most famous movie theme songs of all time and that’s all thanks to Hans Zimmer.\n\nThe Lion King – One of the best Disney movies and also one of the saddest but uplifting Disney movies. The music in this movie is so powerful and beautiful that Disney turned “The Lion King” into a Broadway musical that still uses many of the original songs. “I Just Can’t Wait to Be King?” Slaps. “He Lives In You?” Tears. “Can You Feel the Love Tonight?” Absolutely incredible! Every single song in “The Lion King” is amazing and I think it’s derfiniley Hans Zimmer’s masterpiece.\n\nStory continues below advertisement"
