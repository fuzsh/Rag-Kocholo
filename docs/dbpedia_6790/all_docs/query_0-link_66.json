        "text": "As the final flicker of light fades from the silver screen, the audience slowly awakens from the dreamlike state of the film. Yet, the story lingers on in their minds, painting beautiful images and poignant poetry within their thoughts. The notes of the melancholic piano begin to swell, encompassing the entire room, as those who have just left are inexplicably drawn to a halt. For it is often said that our first connection to the world is through sight, but it is the auditory sense that truly captures the essence of our memories. At this moment, the music of the movies lingers on, weaving a spellbinding spell of emotion and wonder that transcends time and space.\n\nMovie music sprout\n\nWhen movie was invented, movie music did not come up with music simultaneously, it was once the time of silent film. Throwback to the time before the 20th, movies feature live musical accompaniment. In the 1920th, the first sound film appears and the production team notices the emotional importance of it. This industry starts to strive for a better audiovisual experience.\n\nWhile talking to some renowned pioneer of film music composers, you might not have heard of Alfred Newman, however, you must remember the majestic symphony which opens the 20th Fox movie’s gate. In the early modern era, there was a notable example in Star Wars where the theme song. The Imperial March signaled the entrance of Darth Vader. With its deep orchestral composition and powerful execution, it aggressively enveloped the audience’s ears, evoking a sense of dangerous threat. Although Star Wars was released in 1977, even young people today can recognize the music and recall the iconic melody. As for the contemporary movie, Hans Zimmer portrays helpless human loneliness and insignificance in this universe Interstellar. Alexandre Desplat, the composer of The Grand Budapest Hotel, remarks an East European snow-mountainside hotel with a pink appearance in our mind. Music plays an indispensable role that is hard to erase in the audience’s mind.\n\nFortunately, I had a chance to delve deeper into the inner power of movie music through the talk with a music worker, who happens to be the guitarist of Thanatos, Drunk, a golden horse awarded Taiwanese movie. As both the creator and audience, he considers the music an invisible repulsion that gets into the swings of the movie. Specifically, the timing and the volume of music always impress him to a huge degree. A long time ago, movies often feature classical music. However, he said, “Classical music has geographical and time restrictions.” Taking an extreme sample, it is difficult to convince the audience if they hear classical music in an outer space scene. A movie is a large-scale art, and it requires every element’s inseparable cooperation. Doing so, when an individual element appears, it could bring up our whole memory.\n\n“Likes Titanic, it has little clips in different scenes in verified media. These pieces accumulate and then sing as an elemental perfection. Eternally, it stays in everybody’s mind with each segment of Titanic.” Viewing from the creator’s side, the choices of guitars, strings, and playing skills all influence the matching between music and movie. This interview has brought to light certain blind spots or instances where we have become accustomed to things that may not necessarily be reasonable, such as a space film featuring classical music. As viewers, we have the right to question the pairing of these elements. Are they truly suitable for creating the desired atmosphere? While we may not be professional listeners, our instinctive feelings should be taken into consideration by the producers, as they reflect our primal reactions to their works.\n\nTaiwanese movie psyche\n\nBesides the aforementioned international movies, there is an iconic Taiwanese film that has etched itself into the collective memory of every Taiwanese individual: A City of Sadness. This cinematic masterpiece delves deep into the historical narrative, shedding light on the misdeeds of the Kuomintang (KMT) following their takeover of Taiwan in 1945. Revolving around the harrowing political tragedies of the White Terror and the 228 Incident, the film strikes a chord within the hearts and minds of its viewers. One of the most poignant aspects of A City of Sadness lies in its masterful fusion of music and visuals, evoking a profound emotional response. The subdued tones, accompanied by the funereal tempo of the music, creates a somber atmosphere that lingers throughout the film. The classical orchestration and the recurring motif weave together to form a vivid and haunting oriental image, enveloping the viewers in a sense of melancholy.\n\nThe music acts as a powerful carrier, bearing the weight of the land’s collective sorrow, the oppression of a particular era, and the memories of its people. Countless audience members have recounted their experiences of watching this film as children, only to find themselves tearing up each time the music resurfaces. A reviewer comments that he thinks of Mel Gibson’s Braveheart soundtrack because both of these films’ music portray the disconsolate epic. Even after 34 years since its release, the enigmatic sound and weighty tempo continue to transport modern audiences back to the dimly lit house nestled in a mountainside village, immersing them in the dark era that bred an undercurrent of resistance against the prevailing status quo.\n\nA City of Sadness serves as an enduring testament to the emotional impact that music can wield when intricately intertwined with visuals. The harmonious marriage of sound and image unlocks a profound wellspring of emotions, resonating deeply within the psyches of its viewers. It is through this remarkable fusion that the film successfully captures the essence of Taiwan’s tumultuous history, leaving an indelible impression on the hearts of its audience.\n\nThe Obstacle of movie music\n\nNowadays, it is evident that the significance of theme songs has surpassed that of movie music. These theme songs often transcend the boundaries of the film and spread throughout the world. A prime example of this is the songs A Little Happiness from Our Times (2015) and Red Scarf from Till We Meet Again (2021), which became chart-toppers in Mandarin Chinese music upon their release. During the 1980s, Taiwan’s pop music industry flourished, and production teams invited renowned singers to perform theme songs. Some works, such as The Dull Ice Flower and Secret, are considered symbols of that era. With their unforgettable melodies and sounds, theme songs have become an additional medium to promote movies, and this approach has become widely accepted and popular in the industry.\n\nConversely, movie background music still faces obstacles in capturing the public’s attention. I have explored some possible reasons for the polarized reactions towards them. Compared to widely sung theme songs, movie music has the limitation of reaching a limited audience. Most of the time, only those who have watched the movie can truly appreciate and be moved by the background music because it must align with the plot, scenes, and even the characters’ subtle emotions. Additionally, different genres of movies require suitable music. For example, it would feel out of place if a romantic song played in a space adventure film. However, a notable exception is Day One from Interstellar (2014), which beautifully captures the vastness and loneliness of the film’s universe through the haunting tones of the church’s pipe organ. This exemplifies that movie music has the potential to break through its restrictions and earn well-deserved applause.\n\nOutro\n\nAlthough this generation places more emphasis on visual stimulation, movie music quietly works in the background, paving the way for climactic moments in the plot. To gain a deeper understanding, we journey through the timeline of film music development, from the 1920s to the 1980s and into the 2010s. Furthermore, excellent movie soundtracks serve as reminders of the fond memories associated with the films themselves. In Taiwan, diligent production teams have emerged, nurturing the audience’s appreciation for movie music. They have created an auditory vessel that allows us to relive the romantic confessions, daring adventures, and emotionally resonant scenes portrayed on screen. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge for these creators to strike a balance between artistic fulfillment and capturing the public’s attention.\n\nReference:\n\nhttps://flipermag.com/2019/02/25/film-score/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba9tPTh033o\n\nhttps://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/悲情城市\n\nhttps://ed.arte.gov.tw/uploadfile/periodical/3368_015-024.pdf\n\nhttps://www.thenewslens.com/feature/film/25220\n\nhttps://blog.xuite.net/captainbest/twblog/175913230\n\nhttps://everylittled.com/article/137327\n\nhttps://www.fountmedia.io/article/86371\n\nhttps://vocus.cc/article/63fadcdbfd89780001e11173"
