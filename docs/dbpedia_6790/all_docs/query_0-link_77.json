        "text": "Well, I'm a film composer, and I compose in Pro Tools. And so does James Horner. Of course, he does \"Avatar\" and \"Titanic\", and I do indie films that maybe open in one theater, but that's beside the point. I mention Horner because there is a long promotional video of him on the Avid site talking about the benefits of Pro Tools.\n\nMost other composers I know use DP, especially those in their mid-forties or older - they probably started with Performer or Studio Vision and stayed with it. Most my age or younger I know use Logic. Curiously I don't personally know anyone using Cubase or Nuendo.\n\nI really like Pro Tools in combination with Vienna Ensemble Pro. Unlike James Horner I don't use any of the built-in VI's nor many of the effects. One of the conveniences is that you have to deliver in Pro Tools, and it saves doing a conversion or OMF, which can be time-consuming and annoying. The score window is workable, not great, but the midi editor is better than Logic's in my opinion. Also, Pro Tools can do 23.98, Logic seems to think all 24 frame is the same. Again, small point but annoying.\n\nI've recently switched to composing in Pro-Tools 8. And it's as every bit as good for composing in as any other sequencer. Not many people realize that the midi engine in Pro-Tools has always been pretty solid .. even since version 5.\n\nOnly thing I would wish for is to use Node points for breath and expression automation like with Logic ... and a tempo / time signature list for easy manipulation of signatures.\n\nI think it's fair to say that no sequencer is all that different when it comes down to it .. but the way they work is different. And it's a case of you being comfortable with that system. I had to use Logic out of necessity when I had the VSL but I'd been using Pro-Tools 5.0.1 and cubase prior to that.\n\nAnd I have to say that I really like and prefer the sound quality that Pro-Tools 8 gives. I'd guess that a lot of film composers probably use Logic to create, but they'll have a few different DAWs to work with. But just as many probably also use Sibelius or Finale. James Horner uses Sibelius to compose .. And Pro-Tools to follow on (There's a vid about that on the Pro-Tools site for his work on Avatar.)\n\nHi, I came across your posts because I am trying to find this out myself for certain, and the posts seem to be a lot of bias so I thought I'd share what I've found to be true.\n\nKlaus Badelt uses Pro Tools, and almost all projects go through Pro Tools by the end, so to say that you know it's not Pro Tools is kinda silly considering it is the top dog for recording and anything you see on the screen has gone through it at some point (typically mixing).\n\nFor the most part, you're all wrong. The prevalent DAW for film game and TV composing is Digital Performer from MOTU. Not a software for beginners. However, many artists simply use DP to compose, and then everything is carted over to Pro Tools. My suspected reasoning is that DP has a way better interface for composing while Pro Tools is the industry standard for literally everything else. For example, Danny Elfman uses DP, but if you look at his interviews he's got a quite sophisticated Pro Tools HD rig in the back. Michael Giacchino also uses DP and mixes in Pro Tools, and so does Bear McCreary. Keep in mind that top composers wind up recording real orchestras, and there is nothing that can handle that better than a good Pro Tools HD rig.\n\nMy Music 67B teacher (Film, Game, and TV composition) insists that Logic also holds a large share in the market, but couldn't present one name in the top of the industry who uses Logic Pro. The feeling I get is that this is because Logic has a large share in the amateur market because it is a cheap alternative to other DAWs, but it fails to offer the stability or features that professionals need.\n\nHans Zimmer uses Cubase for composing, and insists that people in his studio use it as well. Many of the people who work in his studio and left are still using Cubase. If you watch Hans Zimmer's interviews, especially for his sample libraries, then you'll see he still uses Pro Tools HD for recording.\n\nKeep in mind that you can use whatever you want to get the composition done (I use Sibelius and Pro Tools since they work well together due to both being developed by AVID) as long as at the end of the day you have your scores for your musicians and/or your MIDI files for yourself. The DAW just brings together all the recording and sample libraries. You should focus more on finding a process that works for you than mimicking what the pros do, and finding some good sample libraries.\n\nMind you, anyone who suggests that all DAWs do the same thing with a different workflow has obviously never extensively used one, and probably hasn't used at all more than two. To add to that, don't underestimate having a good workflow. You want your DAW to be a tool to get your work done, not an obstacle between yourself and the creative process. Personally, I've never been anything but happy using Pro Tools midi editor and Sibelius, but other people might feel differently and that is okay. Try different software to find the one that best fits your needs. Don't ever get married to the first DAW you use, otherwise I'd still be using Sonar. BTW, Sonar is generally the joke of the pro audio world (right next to Logic Pro). The only reason why sonar picked up so much steam in the first place is because of the Roland sound boards that exclusively worked with Sonar. Even then, most of the professionals carted the audio files to Pro Tools anyway. And keep in mind that Apple generally doesn't give things away for cheap. If apple is selling something for 200$, then don't go thinking it's equivalent to a 700$ software platform.\n\nLogic Pro is just fine. Henry Jackman uses it. John Powell uses it. David Arnold too I think.\n\nThey're all good in their own ways and yes, they don't all do the same things. (I'm mainly talking about DP, Cubase, and Logic) It all comes down to what really works for you.\n\nI spent years wondering the same thing and after trying many different DAWs and working with lots of professionals that use different DAWs, I came to the conclusion that it doesn't matter as long as you like the workflow of that particular DAW.\n\nHonestly, I don't think as many people use DP as people have made it sound in these forums. I worked at Remote Control Productions for some time and everyone uses Cubase or Logic.\n\nThat doens't mean that DP is bad btw. There are features that I really wish Logic or Cubase would steal from DP.\n\nA lot of the guys on DP are on DP because that's what they started using decades ago, and a lot of them don't want to change because... why should they if it works for them?\n\nIt's true that DP has some awesome features for film scoring. Multiple chunks (ie you can have multiple cues per project). You can make your click behave exactly how you want it regardless of what your tempo is set to (which is the same with Pro Tools). I'm sure there are more.\n\nCubase is in my opinion the best for midi mockup work. The possibilities that you can have with its logical editor are amazing. You can select every 2nd 16th notes and do specific things to those (that's just a small example of the power behind Cubase). You can see multiple controller lanes all at once (and not on top of each other in the annoying way like DP does it - someone correct me if I'm wrong) There are many more but I'm too lazy to write them down...\n\nLogic has the logical editor, where you can do some crazy routing between things as well as midi transformations like Cubase. I remember liking the default plugins.\n\nYes, a lot of the big guys use Protools but only for routing all the audio there. It makes it easier when you have lots of slave machines that don't necessarily use VEP and/or when you need to give all the mockup stems to mixers (that use PT 99% of the time) Almost no one uses Protools for midi because it's still not as good even though it has improved dramatically in the last couple updates. (I don't use protools much either way so someone can probably expand on protools' midi capabilities)\n\nTo summarize, just try them all, find out what you'd rather use composing everyday. Find out which DAW allows you to get your job done in the most efficient way for your particular workflow.\n\nPlease don't feel like an infinitesimal insignificant mollusc for using Logic Pro. If that's the DAW that works for you, then that's what works for you.\n\nIn the end, no top professional is going to care what DAW you use as long as you get the job done.\n\nHowever, I do think that having at least an intermediate grasp of all DAWs is very useful. Not only does it make you versatile but it'll allow you to know exactly why you picked your favorite DAW.\n\nAlso... there are some composer who like to switch DAWs every once in a while because they get bored..."
