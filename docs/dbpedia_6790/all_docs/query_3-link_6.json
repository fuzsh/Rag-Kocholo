        "text": "In my opinion hz is actually doing the same as he has always done, which is to create the right score for the film. A movie like gladiator required a score like that, same goes for lion king, batman, pirates, inception, sherlock, dune, etc. (what a ridiculously impressive list of films)\n\nDunkirk absolutely required that score. I would even argue that the whole movie falls apart without it. Where hans truly shows his mastery, is that even with todays trend in film scoring, which is generally more sound design focused, he still manages to create very memorable material. And those scores can, just like the older ones, easily exist outside of the original intent. Which is proven by his series of live concerts.\n\nAnd those scores can, just like the older ones, easily exist outside of the original intent. Which is proven by his series of live concerts.\n\nI did see him live just before the pandemic so not long ago. Most of the material was from his older scores though. Apart from the Inception medley, Interstellar medley and one that was taken from Man of Steel. Most of the others were taken from Pirates of the Caribbean, The Thin Red Line, The Lion King, Gladiator, The Dark Knight, Crimson Tide, Rain Man, The Da Vinci Code etc. Not to diminish the point you're making, but I still think the newer scores aren't as memorable, maybe because a lot of them are more \"soundscapey\" and not as melodically driven by strong themes as was pointed out in another post.\n\nI did see him live just before the pandemic so not long ago.

To me it's not just whether it reinforces the movie, but also whether or not you can still remember and be able to replay the themes in your head when you're not watching the movie. But again, it's subjective.\n\n@oepion\n\nlet's just say you like the older stuff more vs. the others prefer recent OSTs. Isn't that pretty normal and totally subjective? Why do you need to make a thread that makes it sound like the newer stuff is not memorable and even label your's an \"unpopular opinion\"? That's just click bate to me.\n\nI must finish this post with a Youtube video of Kopano Part III for anyone who wishes to listen to my favourite HZ song and appreciate this underrated gem:\n\nLeaves me totally cold, not least because I didn't like that movie probably. Most people need to love the movie to love the soundtrack. I dare say barely anyone would give a fuck today about even the Star Wars soundtracks if those movies were total trash (in a not even charming c-movie trash way). They'd maybe be an obscure underog tip in the composer community, but they wouldn't be part of the zeitgeist and culture of media like they became in our timeline. People have limited capacity for loving things, and there can only be a limited number of things that they love most (and put on their spotify playlists), and Inception clearly won against a lot of other movies and soundtracks.\n\nWith that said, I feel like HZ's recent work overall isn't as memorable or groundbreaking as what he did in the late 90s and beginning of the 00s. Maybe I was more impressionable as a kid who first got introduced to the world of movie soundtrack with The Rock. I was then carried away by the beauty of Gladiator and a few years later awestruck by his musical genius on Tears of the Sun - seamlessly blending orchestral music with African instruments, choirs and rhythmic elements.\n\nEveryone who already was watching movies in the 90's was less jaded back then than they are today. It's part of getting older. Also - on average - movies 30 years ago were objectively better and more memorable than they are today. Partly because an ever increasing number of things have been done before and no longer feel fresh, partly because capitalism/society decided the thing worth pumping most movie money into is formulaic superhero movies, and partly because an increasing number of movies look like they are made as filler content for streaming services and not primarily driven by a good script.\n\n@oepion\n\nlet's just say you like the older stuff more vs. the others prefer recent OSTs.

That's just click bate to me.\n\nI labeled it unpopular because if I'm going by Spotify's statistics, it is indeed unpopular. Then there is the context of HZ winning an Oscar for Dune (I do believe some of his older works for which he didn't receive an Oscar are even more Oscar-worthy). So I just thought I'd share my thoughts to see what people think, most likely with people who think differently than I do since my opinion is unpopular. Thankfully some of the replies I got have been very constructive - people pointing out how the nature of the composition has changed, those pointing out the context of a movie being different to standalone pieces, etc. It helped me understand the difference in opinions. Not sure why you are looking at this with so much negativity, it is not healthy.\n\nLeaves me totally cold, not least because I didn't like that movie probably.

I did fall in love with the soundtrack, though I don't actually remember whether I had come across the soundtrack first and then wanted to watch the movie, or discovered the songs during the movie and kept listening to the soundtrack despite disliking the movie. Maybe I'm a bit of a special case but the experiences of hearing the music and watching the movie are completely disconnected to me. I totally understand what you described and I do think it's true as a general rule.\n\nI labeled it unpopular because if I'm going by Spotify's statistics, it is indeed unpopular.

Not sure why you are looking at this with so much negativity, it is not healthy.\n\ni'm not looking at the topic in a negative way, I just don't like how you approach it. there are great moments in both old and new music. in the end, I don't care much about this entire discussion. i don't think it'll improve anything.\n\nI honestly think it in general reflects the music of the time. The current trend is more \"background\" music than ever, and often i'd rather call it soundscapes or soundworlds than music. This doesn't mean that it isn't amazing, but it isn't as melodically catchy. Funny thing is, that i think we are starting to see melodically driven music more in series instead. I have been really impressed by the score to His Dark Material, Queens Gambit and The Dark Crystal Renicanse to name a few.\n\nYou say that but which of Hans’ recent scores are purely background? They’re basically in the forefront of the film, more than the dialogue sometimes\n\ni'm not looking at the topic in a negative way, I just don't like how you approach it. there are great moments in both old and new music. in the end, I don't care much about this entire discussion. i don't think it'll improve anything.\n\nYou've clearly missed the point I was making, or maybe you skimmed through the thread without making an effort to read and understand. As you said you don't have to contribute, others have provided constructive inputs which are appreciated. No need trolling.\n\nI actually agree with you but I don't put it at all down in any way to Hans.\n\nI feel like the Era from the 80's to the early 00's were the real sweet spot for Cinema. It was the clashing of the old way with the new. Technology had finally reached a point where people were experimental enough to create new approaches, textures tones and sounds but were still well engrained in the old 'musical' ways of composition with more focus on theme and melody.\n\nSimilar happened in VFX where the technology reached a point where one could create brand new yet believable worlds but we were still engrained in a story plot driven narrative, not just wild CG spectacle (compare Matrix 1 to more modern styles of that genre)\n\nAs time goes on you can start to feel the 'film/music school' in the output. You can see things being done 'correctly' you can see the template esq techniques. You can feel the safety.\n\nLike you I love the work in the modern scores but also like you I feel a degree of identity is lost with the more modern approaches to score which tend to focus on more textural elements (not all scores obviously just the more general approach)\n\nSo personally speaking I make sure to listen where the industry is moving and keep its general vibe in my arsenal but I think once we get to a point where synth/sound design texture loses its appeal as a focus, melody will see a resurgence. I am hoping for that. Again I think the 80-00s had the sweet spot, but we moved on before fully exploring what we could do.\n\n-DJ\n\n@Daniel James thanks for sharing these thoughts, it does really explain why I feel this way. And yes it's not just HZ, there are a few other popular movie composers I feel the same way about re: their more recent works. I do get the nostalgia/bias aspects that others have mentioned but I can also think of a few bands whose recent albums I like much better than what they used to do when I first started listening to them so that theory couldn't explain everything.\n\nThat era was definitely greatly focused on themes and melodies, there wasn't much use of textures/drones or FX compared to now. Even some older soundtracks heavily featuring synthesizers still had strong themes played by the orchestra.\n\nNot that one is necessarily better than the other, but it's a lot easier to remember recurring themes than it is remembering textures, drones and braams. It would explain why it's easier I can sing the theme from the Rock but wouldn't be able to tell you what that of Dunkirk is."
