Absolute legend.\n\nSame. He's the best film composer of all time imo. Even better than John Williams who has probably produced more iconic scores. My favourite pieces by Ennio Morricone are both in \"The good The Bad and The Ugly\". The main theme and \"The Ecstacy of Gold\" which is a personal favourite of mine.\n\njeetu\n\nPPCL Hall of Famer\n\nJoined\n\nAug 19, 2010\n\nRuns\n\n9,865\n\nPost of the Week\n\n4\n\nEnnio Morricone is my favorite composer, the guy has produced some of the greatest movie scores ever.
