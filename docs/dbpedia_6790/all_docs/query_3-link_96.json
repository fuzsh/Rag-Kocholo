        "text": "The night before my previous two concerts, the debacles of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, there was another concert from the same promoter: The Music of Hans Zimmer and Others. Fortunately, I decided not to buy tickets to that. The reason is, I was already booked for the similarly titled, but very different, The Music of Hans Zimmer as performed by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and presented by the Art of the Score team.\n\nI’m a long time listener of the Art of the Score podcast and had the chance to attend previous pre-concert talks along with their John Williams show in Melbourne last year. The team consists of Andrew Pogson, Dr Dan Golding and conductor Nicholas Buc, who never fails to put on a fantastic show.\n\nThe team provides interesting and informative commentary about Hans Zimmer and what inspired his composition, providing some fascinating insights into the process.\n\nHans Zimmer is an iconic and incredibly influential composer of countless popular Hollywood movies. Just as John Williams returned the sound of the full orchestra to the movies, Zimmer brought in innovative electronic and rhythmic sensibilities now adopted as the sound of the modern movie.\n\nZimmer and his team of proteges are incredibly prodigious and there was no way that the concert selections could do anything more than skim the highlights of his output. There were certainly some interesting and unexpected choices.\n\nAs a prelude, the orchestra launches into Discombobulate from Sherlock Holmes, a zany and energetic piece that reflects Robert Downey Jr L’s take on the famous detective.\n\nThe concert begins properly, like Zimmer himself, not with film music, but with a symphonic version of Video Killed the Radio Star, which featured Zimmer on the keyboards.\n\nIt was Rain Man that gave Hans Zimmer his break into Hollywood scoring along with my introduction to his music. I remember commenting on his score as part of my high school English review of the movie.\n\nAlthough Rain Man’s score doesn’t feature in tonight’s play list, not lending itself to an orchestral interpretation, Zimmer’s next score, Driving Miss Daisy follows, displaying both pop sensibilities along with playful woodwind that feels so unlike the dramatic scores that he is so well known for.\n\nWe now begin the first of our lessons, with Conductor Buc demonstrating how a simple sailors’ dance, a vertical dance due to the limited space on a ship, inspired Hans Zimmer and Klaus Badelt to write their themes to Pirates of the Caribbean. Taking a couple of notes, lowering the pitch and changing the key to D Minor is a common theme of the night!\n\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean suite is raucous fun. I hadn’t been impressed by the score until I heard it performed live to the film by the SSO, back in 2013. After that I was a convert.\n\nOne of the joys of live performances is that you often discover elements of a composition that you might otherwise have ignored. It was like that with the sublime Journey to the Line from The Thin Red Line, which begins with a ticking sound and two thin alternating notes which continue to pulse in the background while the music swells.\n\nIt’s an incredibly visual movie and the music brilliantly evokes the imagery and emotion. It is my highlight of the night.\n\nAfter the power of Journey to the Line we go down an emotional gear with playful music about a film composer, Maestro from the romcom The Holiday. A bit of fun!\n\nThen it’s time for Time. First we see how Edith Piaf’s Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien was used as the base of the Inception‘s score, with the orchestra first playing Piaf’s song, then slowing it down, changing the key and picking out a few notes. Two pieces from Inception, Dream is collapsing and Time round out the first half of the concert, leading up to the interval.\n\nTwenty minutes later we are back for some of Zimmer’s music for animations, beginning with The Lion King Orchestra Suite. There are some lovely melodies interspersed with rousing passages. What I find interesting was how well the music plays without the African singing that form such an integral part of the original. Somehow the instruments themselves sing.\n\nA similarly successful substitution is made in the next piece, Oogway Ascends from Kung Fu Panda. Catherine Hewgill does a very creditable imitation of an erhu with her cello, Zimmer and Powell using Chinese music to inform the score for the animation.\n\nFun time is over and it’s back to serious stuff. Chevaliers de Sangreal, from The Da Vinci Code, is one of my favourite Zimmer compositions, evoking a sense of pieces of a puzzle coming together to reveal a wonderous revelation. The lack of a choir and what feels to be a slightly fast tempo does take a faint edge off the sense of majesty, but nonetheless it is still a wonderful listen.\n\nIt doesn’t get darker than The Dark Knight, except that I did misdirect you about the fun time ending. In his video review of The Music of Hans Zimmer and Others, Mark Humphries scoffs at the request for audience participation in singing a cheesy song. I don’t think anyone in the audience minded doing the same when our hosts, who have had us laughing along all night, request the same tonight.\n\nIn lieu of a choir, the area behind the stage is seating for the audience. The front and the back of the theatre are given the task of alternately singing out “Batman” as Maestro Buc waves his baton at us while the orchestra play’s Neal Hefti’s famous tune to the 1960’s television series.\n\nI think we all do a pretty good job of it!\n\nThen there’s a bit of Danny Elfman’s music to the Batman movie, which serves to demonstrate just how different Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard’s Batman Begins suite really is and just how powerful a couple of notes can sound.\n\nI’m a big fan of frequent Zimmer collaborator Christopher Nolan’s movies and Interstellar would have to be my favourite. I’m a sucker for end-of-the-world stories and find black holes fascinating (one of the things that inspired me to study physics) and Interstellar features both. The suite propels us through the event horizon, while keeping us grounded in the relationship between a father and daughter separate by time and space.\n\nI wasn’t the only one a little disappointed that a synthesized organ was used instead of the massive pipe organ that towers over the back of the stage. Perhaps it would have overwhelmed everything else.\n\nIncidentally, my uncle rebuilt a much smaller pipe organ in the basement of his previous Adelaide home and found himself an organ adviser for Sweet Country, an Australian movie starring Sam Neill and Bryan Brown.\n\nWhen Andrew Pogson and Dan Golding re-emerge to farewell us and encourage us to attend future Sydney Symphony Orchestra concerts, I’m not sure that Wagner inspiration is entirely appropriate considering the mercenaries of the Wagner Group mutinying in Russia this very night!\n\nThe performance suitably ends with a suite of Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard’s music to Gladiator, with Jaqueline Dark performing singing duties for Elysium and Now We Are Free. Dark’s operatically trained voice is more powerful than Gerrard’s and there is no yangqin this time, so it is a bit different to when I heard the Gladiator score performed live at the same venue almost a decade ago. It is just as moving.\n\nIt comes as a little shock that there is no encore, but regardless it has been a wonderful night of superb performances, fascinating insight and more than a few laughs, the absolute antithesis of the rubbish out of Star Entertainment Gmbh. After missing out on the chance to travel up to Brisbane for Cinematic this year (I had tickets, but travel was just too expensive) it was wonderful to hear a proper film music show in Sydney again. I hope that the excellent Art of the Score team will make their way up here more often and strongly recommend that anyone with an interest in film scores takes a listen to previous episodes of their podcast.\n\nAs for Hans Zimmer’s music, to use my favourite simile, it’s like the burger I scoffed down on for dinner on the way to the Opera House. Fast, tasty and uncomplicated. Zimmer works with a huge palette of sounds and textures rather than with complex harmonies and orchestrations. When you hear it, you enjoy it straight away. It is music that suits the mood of the movies.\n\nPerhaps this is partly a criticism of concert pieces in general, but after a while the so-called Zimmer sound can get a bit tiresome, the constant rise to a crescendo lacking subtlety and escape. It is something I will be paying more attention to in my listening, that film music can be simple tender moments rather than anthems. Is this also Zimmer? This concert has made me want to find out."
