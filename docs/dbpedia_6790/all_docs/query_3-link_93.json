        "text": "Home Depot is where they have pipes,\n\nthey have things that we use,\n\nwe can extend the length of a flute.\n\nHome Depot is our secret instrument building site.\n\n[gentle ethereal music]\n\nHello, I'm Hans Zimmer,\n\nand today we'll be breaking down\n\nhow we created the score for Dune: Part Two.\n\nI remember finishing Part One\n\nand saying to Denis, Hang on, we're only on page 156\n\nof roughly 600 pages.\n\nAnd I just carried on,\n\nI carried on writing,\n\nand there came a phone call from Denis going,\n\nListen, the movie has been out for six months.\n\nYou can stop writing now.\n\nAnd I was going, No, no, no,\n\nI really think we're going to get to make part two,\n\nbecause we weren't green lit at that point in time.\n\nSo I just carried on writing.\n\nAnd then I wrote a theme, which I really loved,\n\nand there's a voice in the first movie,\n\nwhich is very much the sort of the centerpiece\n\nthat holds everything together,\n\nsung by a woman called Loire Cotler,\n\nwho's just a phenomenal artist.\n\n[Loire singing]\n\nA friend of mine saw her on YouTube\n\nand went, This is an extraordinary voice.\n\nShe knows the limits of what her voice can do,\n\nand she is right at the limit of\n\nwhere she will never ever be able to sing again.\n\nSo she dares, she dares to go to that place.\n\nThe score for Dune: Part One,\n\nand Dune: Part Two is very much the same players,\n\nand it's very much the players\n\nthat are in my band when I play live.\n\nI think what differentiates the score\n\nfrom many, many other scores\n\nis it's not an orchestral score,\n\nit's a score played entirely by virtuoso musicians.\n\nYou throw a challenge out,\n\nthey just eat it up like lions, you know?\n\nIt's like, Go crazy.\n\nDo do something we have never done before.\n\nThat's the general motto.\n\nWell, let's stick with Guthrie Govan who I've heard play.\n\nI saw him on Facebook, I saw him on YouTube.\n\nI finally wrote to him on Facebook.\n\nIt took three months.\n\nI get a reply going,\n\nI know you're just a 14-year-old fan boy.\n\nI know you're not Hans Zimmer at all.\n\nSo I had to then, blah blah blah,\n\nso it went back and forth\n\nto prove that I actually was who I was.\n\nTina Guo, my cellist, I met through a friend of mine.\n\nI was very stuck when I was writing Wonder Woman.\n\nI didn't know how to write Wonder Woman.\n\nI did not know how to write that character.\n\nAnd then I remembered Tina,\n\n'cause Tina is very proper, very gentle,\n\nand then she takes her cello,\n\n[Hans imitates small explosion]\n\nand she turns into a banshee.\n\n[Tina playing cello]\n\nBut since I know the virtuosos,\n\nthe people that I'm going to be working with,\n\nI very much write with them in mind.\n\nThere was a whole very interesting group\n\nof French musicians slash scientists who came in,\n\nwho'd spent 10 years inventing a keyboard\n\nthat could do all sorts of, you know,\n\nwithout going into the technicalities,\n\nbasically, [piano chimes]\n\nif you do this, all that happens is it's a switch\n\nthat goes on and off, right?\n\nOr you can play a little quieter.\n\nBut they had managed to make a keyboard\n\nwhere you could express pretty much any emotion\n\nthat you could express on a violin\n\nor any of those other instruments\n\nthat we keyboard players are always\n\nso incredibly envious of,\n\nbecause they can express true emotion.\n\nIt's a keyboard called the Osmose.\n\nAnd at the same time, they had speaker systems, which they,\n\nit really came from the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nA speaker would be made out of wood\n\nand very organic materials.\n\nSo all over our studio, there were these sculptures.\n\nAnd a lot of the instruments we were using ourselves\n\nwere were made by a sculptor.\n\nThere's a man called Chas Smith\n\nwho lives in Northern California.\n\nHe's a pedaled steel guitarist, but he's a welder as well.\n\nAnd he doesn't just weld bridges and buildings,\n\nbut what he's really interested in\n\nis making strange musical instruments.\n\nAnd he seems to have some unholy alliance,\n\nwhich I've never quite figured out\n\nwith the Boeing Corporation\n\nwho give him scrap metal and things.\n\nAnd he explains the metal to me,\n\nand it has names that I've never heard of and can't repeat.\n\nAnd part of his whole ethos is that everything\n\nhas to be made out of scrap.\n\nAnd so these things which you can bow or play or rub\n\nor kick or hit with hammers,\n\nor it can be the most gentle sounds,\n\nit's truly the sound of the monster under the earth,\n\nvery Dune-like.\n\nThe movie tells you what it wants and what it rejects.\n\nYou have to listen.\n\nAnd one of the things great musicians do,\n\nit's not how well they play, it's how well they listen,\n\nhow well they listen to each other.\n\nI usually spend a lot of time looking at color charts\n\nor sitting with the DP\n\nor just looking at the way things are graded\n\nfrom the previous movie or where we're going now,\n\nwhat the costumes are.\n\nChris Nolan and Denis,\n\nwe have this process whereby I don't really read the script.\n\nI ask them to tell me the story,\n\nbecause then I know what's in their head.\n\nAnd then straight away it's off to the designs and the DP\n\nand what's the color spectrum going to be like,\n\nbecause I have this sort of,\n\nand it's hard to describe.\n\nLook, all I can tell you is there's a few frames\n\nin The Lion King, the original Lion King,\n\nand I only had a black and white drawing,\n\nand the colors and what the music is doing\n\nis completely wrong and it clashes\n\nand nobody seems to understand that other than me.\n\nBut for me it's fingers down a chalkboard.\n\nSo yes, I'm insane, you know, I admit it.\n\n[interviewer laughs]\n\nLet's have a quick look at this sequence here,\n\nwhich is The Quiet Between The Storms.\n\nAnd I see here it's still labeled\n\nas Hans Zimmer Love Theme,\n\nwhich might give you a hint.\n\n[gentle ethereal music]\n\nI was trying to create the sound of sand\n\nand just atmospheres,\n\nnothing, you know, just this stillness,\n\nthis wind going across the desert.\n\nAnd the tune really comes from the original bagpipe tune,\n\nwhich used to be fast.\n\nAnd then at one point, Loire and I sat down and said,\n\nWhat happens if we perform this tune very slowly,\n\nand then of course somehow in the way we work,\n\nit's like somehow it ended up\n\nwith Pedro saying it would be good on the duduk,\n\nbut of course it cannot be played on an ancient instrument\n\nbecause it doesn't have all the notes.\n\nSo we went to Home Depot\n\nand had to modify his instrument.\n\nHome Depot is where they have pipes.\n\nWe can extend the length of a flute.\n\nHome Depot is our secret instrument building site.\n\nSo Home Depot has been very important\n\nin creating the score for Dune.\n\nIt really has.\n\nSo if I just play you this by itself,\n\nyou'll hear the beauty of.\n\n[gentle ethereal music]\n\nAnd the thing about Pedro is there's a heart,\n\nthere's a soul, there's a loneliness,\n\nthere's a longing in his performance,\n\nwhich is so extraordinary.\n\nI mean, I put the barest minimum of things around him.\n\nIt's just this little high note above him.\n\n[gentle ethereal music]\n\nAnd to me, it felt like the endless gaze\n\nacross this planet.\n\n[gentle ethereal music]\n\nAnd it felt incredibly intimate.\n\nSo when Paul and Chani\n\nare sitting there talking to each other.\n\nAnd the way they mixed it,\n\nthe way Denis mixed it as well in the film\n\nis it's like the whole atmosphere shifts\n\nand it just becomes this incredibly intimate moment\n\nbetween these two characters.\n\nI'd very much like to be equal to you.\n\nMaybe I'll show you the way.\n\n[epic uplifting music]\n\nThere is this sort of a gentle chorus.\n\n[gentle ethereal music]\n\nAnd it's just how he placed those first notes here.\n\n[gentle ethereal music]\n\nThere's such longing.\n\n[gentle ethereal music]\n\nI mean, there's real poetry\n\nand you just hear Tina very slightly\n\nbehind on her electric cello.\n\n[gentle ethereal music]\n\nYou know something?\n\nI've done a lot of movies\n\nand I love doing movies and I love writing music,\n\nand you know why?\n\n'Cause I still haven't written a thing\n\nthat I think is really the most beautiful love theme.\n\nI'm still learning.\n\nI'm still searching, I'm still investigating,\n\nI'm still exploring, I'm still experimenting.\n\nThe advantage I have is that I have a partner\n\nin Denis Villeneuve who is sort of on the same side.\n\nWe never butted heads over anything.\n\nSometimes the quality of a wine, maybe.\n\nOne of the things which was interesting\n\nabout the way Denis built Dune\n\nwas the first movie really is an introduction.\n\nIt introduces the characters,\n\nintroduces where the plot is probably heading.\n\nThe second movie actually gives you the grit,\n\ngives you the action, gives you the [speaks German],\n\nas we would say in my home country.\n\nAnd this is Harvester Attack,\n\nand because it says attack,\n\nyou might not think it's a love theme.\n\n[epic music]\n\nWe were gonna be completely fearless.\n\nWe were gonna go and embrace dissonance.\n\nWe were going to embrace a complete punk.\n\nOh God, here I am giving it away.\n\nYes, there was a period in my life\n\nwhere I wasn't wearing a nice jacket\n\nand I was a bit more, was in a punk band.\n\nAnd some of that stuff came back,\n\nand that mentality when you wanna go\n\nand do an action scene comes in very handy.\n\nWhat's appropriate for the way I think we worked on Dune\n\nis that the female power\n\nis a really important story component\n\nand certainly my three percussionists are female\n\nand they hit things harder than most guys ever hit things.\n\nI used to work with Sheila E. as well,\n\nwho was Prince's drummer.\n\nSo it just seemed appropriate\n\nto have my wonderful female percussionist come\n\nand give this a bit of energy and a bit of just rage,\n\nwhich is what it needed.\n\n[upbeat epic music]\n\nRichard King, our sound designer,\n\nwho is, I'm just gonna say it,\n\nwho's the god of sound designers for me.\n\nI mean, we've done so many movies together.\n\nWe've done all the Christopher Nolan movies together.\n\nThere's a great amount of inventiveness\n\nthat is going on in what he does sonically,\n\nand there's an enormous amount of bandwidth he uses up.\n\nAnd of course, when you see a huge harvester,\n\nthere's this huge machine.\n\nLeave some room for Richard, you know?\n\nAnd at the same time, he is a gentleman,\n\nand he will leave some room for me.\n\nSo there's this constant sense\n\nof trading off and collaborating.\n\nThere's a record company that makes cheap knockoffs\n\nof my tracks because they make some money out of that.\n\nSo it always makes me laugh because they sound terrible.\n\nSo a while back, this is many years ago,\n\nI put on one of them because I always wanted\n\nto really have a laugh about it.\n\nAnd it was a track which was impossible to play\n\nby a real orchestra.\n\nAnd I'm listening to this thing\n\nand it's better than my version of it.\n\nAnd I'm looking, and it's somebody called Steve Mazzaro\n\nwho did this arrangement.\n\nSo I hunt him down in Los Angeles,\n\nand at first he took me,\n\nafterwards, he told me later,\n\nhe thought I wanted to sue him or something,\n\nthat he got a phone call from Hans Zimmer.\n\nBut I said, No, no, it's absolutely brilliant.\n\nI think your work is absolutely brilliant.\n\nI think you should come over to the studio\n\nand I think we should have a chat.\n\nAnd he goes, Well, actually,\n\nI've been here now for two years and it hasn't worked out.\n\nMy career, it hasn't worked out.\n\nHe was working in the computer filing department\n\nof an accounting firm.\n\nSo that was obviously not what he had aspired to\n\nas a great musician.\n\nSo he had packed up everything\n\nand bought his return ticket to Ohio or Oklahoma\n\nor something with an O.\n\nAnd so, just that moment, at that moment, he was like,\n\nSell your ticket, come into the studio,\n\nyou got a job.\n\nWe're gonna be friends,\n\nwe're gonna be working together.\n\nAnd so a lot of the creativity of this one\n\nis down to Steve's brilliance and everything.\n\nBut am I lucky that he didn't catch that plane?\n\n[Interviewer] I know you said when you finished\n\nthe first Dune score,\n\nyou kind of were still in the world of Dune,\n\nstill composing.\n\nAre you still dreaming in Dune?\n\nSecond day of shooting,\n\nDenis puts Dune Messiah on my desk,\n\ndoesn't say a word.\n\nI know where we're going.\n\n[light ethereal
