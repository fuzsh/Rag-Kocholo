        "text": "This was easily the best concert I had ever attended in my life. I was first bewildered by his choices to open with Madagascar, but then my concerns quickly melted away with Crimson Tide, Gladiator and the brilliant Pirates of the Caribbean. Then came the highlight of the show, which was the ridiculously brilliant \"Chevaliers de Sangreal\" from The Da Vinci Code... I never thought anything could be better than the original, till I heard the violin version that night. Wow. The ambience, lighting and performances on that piece were just exquisite. I compared that to a YouTube video from Wembley and everything was just a big step down in London. Maybe it was the fact it's his first concert, but damn, the lighting in Paris' Palais des Congrees was easily the best I had ever seen in a show, period. The audio felt exactly as if I'm in a movie theater listening to heavily edited post-production tracks and not listening to a live performance with all its imperfections. That had the best of both worlds, and it was simply an achievement that nobody other than Zimmer can pull off. Next, we moved to \"Superhero territory\" with Man of Steel where he chose the best track of that brilliant score, and played it faithfully with no changes, and again it felt exactly like watching the movie, which was a huge relief to me. Unfortunately, The Dark Knight remix wasn't so lucky, as he had strangely decided to blend many of the tracks into one long one, which felt alien to my ears. This is coming from someone who listened religiously to Batman Begins and TDKR scores everyday for several years. You had to listen closely to know which track was playing... After spending too long on a remixed opening that felt like it wasn't on the original score, you can start to make out Molossus, and he ended it before the good part and moved to something else. He was a little too generous with the Bane scores, and decided against playing the brilliant \"Why do we fall?\" score. Overall, Batman could have been way better served that today. Moving on, Interstellar was just perfect and was another faithful adaptation of the original that I wished TDK had received. Most importantly, he gifted us an incredible \"No Time for Caution\" which was the best score in the movie and wasn't even released in the OST.... I gasped when I heard the clock ticking. Then he bowed, said thank you, I love you and left. I was devastated to see Inception left out. I noticed it wasn't in the playlist but was thinking \"no way, he'll surprise us and play it\"... Well, the theater stayed dark even after all the musicians had left, but the rest of the crowds knew better... They started cheering intensely, with an even louder applause, and after 3-5 long minutes of intense applause, we started hearing the Inception BWAAAAHM sound... everyone went crazy.... he then came back on stage and his musicians followed... and BOOM... INCEPTION TIME. He played maybe 4-5 tracks, ending the night with an incredible \"Time\" performance. I will be saving for the US tour which I'm sure he'll deliver one time. Easily a 4.999* night (bec of the unfaithful Batman adaptation)\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nSuch an amazing performance by an amazing man and orchestra! The performance went on longer than I thought (Approximately 8 pm to passed 11 pm) so I had to leave before the concert was finished.\n\nThe sound was pretty good from where I was sat (stage left block S5 Row U). Minor annoyance was that a black curtain at the side of the stage obscured our seats from seeing part of the orchestra.\n\nThe bad points were firstly the venue. The chairs in the balcony were plastic, cheap and not very comfortable. The steps up to Row U in block S5 was very high with steps that were not lit and could likely cause someone to fall. I saw no accessibility options to get up to this block, nor was I offered assistance by staff (I walk with a cane).\n\nThe bad points were secondly the crowd. With minutes to go till curtain up there were still people filtering in trying to find their chairs in the dark. Even those in the front row could not sit still and were still coming in after the show had started. When will venues put patrons comfort ahead of profit? I had to get up out of my chair many times in the first 2 songs because of late comers. The show start time was on the ticket. Plus those that felt they needed to get up after each song annoying fellow concert goers that were trying to enjoy the show.\n\nEven though there were negative points due to the venue and the minority of concert goers, it was an excellent show. The sound, the light presentation and songs played were stunning. Would have been good to have a curfew of 11 pm so that those with far to travel (like myself) could still get home after watching the entire show (I had to miss the last 2 songs).\n\nI will definitely see Hans Zimmer again in future!!\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nThe revelation of Hans Zimmer was a brilliant entertaining evening, the sight of a 75 piece Orchestra, on the Hammersmith stage before a note was played was stunning, the evening Kicked off with. Maestro Hans seated at the piano tinkling the theme to driving Miss Daisy a folky bluesy theme introduced us to the band, and expanded to the full orchestra, then the Crouch End choir, seated at the back wall . It was amazing that all the musicians fitted on the stage, and what musicians, superb ,.the percussion section headed by the amazing drummer Sat am Ramgotra, what a beard . Gladiator, Pirates, Lion King,TheDa Vinci code took up most of the first half , the Theme from Crimson Tide very dark , and Gothic was incredible , with a fab light show to underline the score . Hans introduced each piece with some entertaining banter . The second half introduced Johnny Marr who looked about 25 , I don't know what pills he is on , but I want them . Man of Steel was the highlight Johnny Marr conjured some moody sounds from his axe, standing ovations well deserved . Then the encore Inception, withe guitar sound rising above the Orchestra . Brilliant outstanding , I forgot to add the venue , was an inspired choice an old cinema a perfect setting with a superb sound This extravaganza deserves to run and run , the revelation didn't need screens in the background, the music says it all . Unforgettable .\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nThey don’t give out stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for nothing, and I think it’s fair to say that Hans Zimmer has more than earned his. Over a career spanning nearly forty years, the German composer has produced more than one hundred and fifty film scores, with some of his best work coming in recent years and involving repeated collaborations with Christopher Nolan; his scores for The Dark Knight and Inception won him awards, and also proved his flexibility, with the latter seeing him work with a conventional rock guitarist in the form of Johnny Marr.\n\nSince the turn of the century, he’s demonstrated his penchant for subtle drama on the likes of Pirates of the Caribbean, Gladiator and The Last Samurai; he’s always looking for new sounds to incorporate, too, such as the Romani influences he incorporated on the score for Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. He continues to play live, too, making him one of the busiest composers in the business; he’s set to prove his versatility at a two Hammersmith Apollo shows later this year, with two sets - one featuring his classic film scores performed faithfully, and another welcoming guests from the rock and pop world as he re-imagines some of his more recent work.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
