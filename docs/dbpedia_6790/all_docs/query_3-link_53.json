        "text": "The music of German film music composer Hans Zimmer moves millions of people worldwide. The number of Zimmer fans who enjoy his gripping music even without the accompanying films is constantly growing, and now not only the largest concert halls but also football stadiums are filled with his fans.\n\nGerman-born composer Hans Zimmer is considered one of Hollywood's most innovative musical talents and first found success in the world of pop music as a member of the Buggles. The group's video \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" became a worldwide success and helped usher in a new era of global entertainment as the first music video to air on MTV.\n\nZimmer entered the world of film music in London during a long collaboration with the famous composer and mentor Stanley Myers, which included the film My Beautiful Laundrette. He soon began working on several successful solo projects, including the critically acclaimed A World Apart. During these years, Zimmer was a pioneer in combining old and new musical technologies. Today, this work has earned him a reputation for integrating the electronic music world into traditional orchestral arrangements.\n\nA turning point in Zimmer's career came in 1988 when he was asked to score Rain Man for director Barry Levinson. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture of the year and earned Zimmer his first Oscar nomination for Best Original Score. The next year, Zimmer composed the score for another Best Picture Oscar recipient, Driving Miss Daisy, starring Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman.\n\nIn 2003, Zimmer completed his 100th film score for the film 2The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, for which he received both a Golden Globe and Broadcast Film Critics nomination. His scores for films such as Gladiator, Batman: The Dark Knight, Pirates of the Carribean, Interstellar, and many more have been met with great enthusiasm worldwide, resulting in both a far-reaching fan community and numerous awards (Echo, Oscar, Grammy, and others)."
