        "text": "More Than Just “Background Music”\n\nIf you ask me what my favorite music genre is, I will tell you it’s an unequivocal tie between movie scores and electronic music. The mixed reactions I receive are usually accompanied by a furrowed brow, or a confused look upon the face. I go on to further explain that movie scores are the instrumental and background music that accompany various movies and TV shows. This explanation tends to spark an interest in the people I talk to. Many are familiar with the works of successful film score composer Hans Zimmer. He composed popular scores to movies such as “The Lion King,” “Interstellar,” and “The DaVinci Code.” These powerful compositions were just the tip of the iceberg that inspired my interest in movie scores.\n\nI have been heavily invested in music since the beginning of my childhood. As a classically trained pianist and cellist for more than 15 years, instrumental music has been a large part of my upbringing. The earliest recount of my knowledge pertaining to music scores dates back to the sixth grade. We were instructed to compile a 10-page research paper on someone who inspired us. After seeing film director Michael Bay’s “Transformers” movie, I became obsessed with the works of film score composer, Steve Jablonsky, which led me to film score composer Hans Zimmer. I chose to write about Hans Zimmer instead because of his established reputation in the composition world.\n\nHans Zimmer has been a major staple throughout my life. I never fail to see him pop up on my end of the year Spotify stats as my “most listened to artist” (sometimes reaching over 120 hours in total for his music alone). Movie scores are an incredible, fluid genre that can work alongside a variety of activities. Whether it’s listening to “The Social Network” while studying and imagining I’m creating the next technological app or listening to “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2” and getting in a powerhouse workout, I feel movie scores have the capacity to dramatically improve the quality of your everyday activities.\n\nMy Film Favorites\n\nAs an eclectic lover of movies, my favorite movie genres range from action to drama to horror. My favorite movie scores follow in the same manner. I have also discovered that entrepreneurial and sci-fi movie scores are easy to listen to while studying or focusing on important work. I find scores from movies such as “Arrival,” “The Martian,” and “Miss Sloane” to be the most motivational. These soundtracks particularly help while I’m studying for a big exam or when I just want some inspiration. When listening to “The Martian,” I imagine that I’m discovering a new, biotechnological process on a foreign planet. When listening to “Miss Sloane,” I imagine I’m a high-powered lobbyist on Capitol Hill reading through policy drafts.\n\nAs contrasting as this might seem, horror movies tend to have the most hauntingly, beautiful instrumental scores to accompany the terror. “The Haunting of Hill House” is a Netflix original that has a score composed by The Newton Brothers. They are most widely known for their work in “Oculus” and “Doctor Sleep.” The Newton Brothers have been active in the music composition scene for the past decade focusing mostly in horror films. They incorporate a heavy emphasis on piano melodies throughout “The Haunting of Hill House” score. Themes are developed on top of one another and are especially seen through the succession from the “Beginning of the End Movement I” to the “Beginning of the End Movement IV.”\n\nThe “Dark Knight Trilogy” will always be one of my all-time favorite movies and scores. I got the chance to perform the “Dark Knight Rises” medley for a piano recital back in high school. The melding work from both James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer creates a constant theme throughout all three movies. One of my favorite pieces is Hans Zimmer’s “Aurora,” which was recorded during his live concert in Prague. This piece is accompanied by spoken-word dialogue from Zimmer himself and explains his music development for the Dark Knight trilogy. Hans Zimmer and James Newton-Howard were able to create the foundation for the Batman theme in “Batman Begins” and continue to evolve it throughout the sequels. The heartbreaking tragedies of actor Heath Ledger’s death and the 2012 Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting nearly brought the compositions to a halt. In the case of the “Dark Knight,” both Zimmer and Newton-Howard created a harsh, punk theme for Ledger’s Joker character. After his unfortunate passing, both composers were on the fence about creating a lighter tone for the theme. They came to the conclusion that in order to show respect for Heath Ledger’s performance, the dissonance of the Joker theme must remain. One quote that stuck out to me from this piece is when Zimmer explained, “Words aren’t the way I expressed myself…” and goes on to explain how he expresses his emotion through his music compositions. Listening to his powerful spoken words over a moving instrumental background was enough to bring me to tears.\n\nThere is a crossover between movie scores and electronic music as well. Classical and instrumental music have intertwined themselves into the world of dance music since the start of the decade. Tiesto’s Adagio for Strings (released in 2004) is an electronic remix of Samuel Barber’s 1936 composition of the same name. Popular European electronic artist Zedd has also dabbled in the world of soundtracks. His first composition was for the National Geographic miniseries, “One Strange Rock,” which premiered in 2018. Zedd explains how he started the theme with a simple piano melody, which he was able to layer on different musical tones to create a nature theme throughout.\n\nJunkie XL is a popular Dutch composer and a famous electronic guru. Starting his career with video game compositions such as “Need for Speed: Prostreet” in 2007 and maturing into dance remixes, Junkie XL has worked in multiple music genres for years. The movie score that he is most arguably widely known for is his work on the 2015 reboot of “Mad Max: Fury Road.” This album, which features a mix between opera and rock genres, took almost two years to complete. After describing the movie’s cinematography as “over the top,” Junkie XL decided it was necessary to complement the movie with an “over the top” movie score.\n\nMovie Scores in Television\n\nWith the increased popularity of new HBO shows, the music composers for those TV shows have incorporated popular songs with instrumental covers. Ramin Djawadi is a Grammy-nominated, German composer known for his work on “Game of Thrones” and “Westworld.” He has released multiple instrumental covers on all three “Westworld” scores. Westworld Season 1 kicks off covers including “Paint It, Black” by The Rollings Stones and “Exit Music (For a Film)” by Radiohead. Westworld Season 2 featured a cover of Kanye West’s “Runaway,” “Seven Nation Army” by The White Stripes, and “Codex” by Radiohead. Djawadi exceeded expectations in Westworld Season 3 by releasing the following covers: “Sweet Child O’ Mine,” by Guns and Roses, “Wicked Games” by The Weeknd, and “Brain Damage” by Pink Floyd. Djawadi has made a point to differentiate his “Game of Thrones” score from the other fantasy movie scores. To contrast the themes, he did not use any flutes in the “Game of Thrones” soundtrack (flutes were a common instrument used in the “Lord of the Rings” movies). In lieu of that specific instrument, Djawadi chose heavy themes that incorporated the cello to add to the dark and mysterious tone of the show.\n\nHildur Guðnadóttir is another major name to look out for. Known for her involvement with movie scores such as “Joker” (where she was the first female composer to win a Grammy) and “Sicario: Day of the Soldado,” Guðnadóttir is one of the only female composers in the entertainment field. The classically trained cellist from Reykjavik, Iceland scored her first Emmy Award for her work on the HBO limited series, “Chernobyl.”\n\nMusicians Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, notorious for their involvement in the rock band, Nine Inch Nails, are no strangers to the world of movie scores. After releasing compositions for movies such as “The Social Network” and “Gone Girl,” they made the transition to scoring television shows, starting with HBO’s “Watchmen,” released in 2019. The instrumental cover they composed was David Bowie’s “Life on Mars.” They were able to include songs that heavily featured both rock and jazz concepts, which was something new to the composition world. Common themes are heard throughout the different songs such as the melodic love theme that appears in “Which Came First” and is revisited in “Lincoln Tunnel.”\n\nThe “Euphoria” score was something completely different from the other scores released for movies and television. The score was composed by British rapper, Labrinth, who has worked with popular artists such as Diplo, The Weeknd, Nicki Minaj, and Emeli Sande. Nominated for “Outstanding Music Composition for a Series” and “Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics” for his work on “Euphoria,” Labrinth is getting the long, overdue recognition he deserves. The score not only was impressive by itself, but it was able to match the phenomenal cinematography of the show. Molding both classical tones and rap beats into the score is something that hasn’t been traditionally seen in this musical environment. Labrinth was able to mix these sounds with gospel and electronic themes to create this eclectic score that is genre-bending. He included actress Zendaya as a feature for his hit song “All for Us” which aired during the final scene of the first season.\n\nMovie Scores are Everywhere\n\nAlthough this may seem like a bizarre genre to you, you might be surprised with the music you find out there. Movie scores are considered an obscure field of music, but at the same time it encompasses a variety of options to choose from. Whether it be from a 90-second movie trailer you caught a glimpse of or your favorite video game, movie scores and instrumental music encompass us. Taking the time to explore something new just might open up a Pandora’s Box of new music genres. Music is so varied that it can be applied to a range of different activities. I suggest starting with popular Spotify playlists such as “Classical X,” “Cinematic Chillout,” and “Atmospheric Sci-Fi Soundtracks” to begin your journey with movie scores."
