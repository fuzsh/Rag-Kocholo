EastEnders welcomes back one its biggest characters soon as Sonia Fowler makes her dramatic return to Walford.

In these emotional spoiler pictures from the BBC soap, Sonia's mum Carol Jackson goes to visit her daughter to tell her about her breast cancer diagnosis.

Carol - played by Lindsey Coulson - puts on a brave face as she turns up at Sonia's flat to share the bad news but ends up breaking down, leading Sonia to plan a return to Walford.

Sonia was last seen in Walford in 2011 when she briefly returned to announce that she had split with former husband Martin and had moved to Essex.

The couple had a daughter, Rebecca who will now be played by Jasmine Armfield who can also be seen in the picture below.

Natalie Cassidy who plays Sonia said she was excited to return to the soap: "After seven years being out of the show, apart from the odd episode, I am extremely excited and honoured to be making a full-time return.

"I feel so lucky as an actress to get back to my roots. With Dominic Treadwell-Collins as executive producer, it's such an exciting time for the show. I cannot wait to work with Patsy Palmer and Lindsey Coulson again. Bring it on!"
