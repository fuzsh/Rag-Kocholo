        "text": "EASTENDERS fans may have 'worked out' Sonia Fowler's baby name - and it's a tribute to late Walford legend.\n\nViewers of the BBC soap have tuned in to see the long-running characters tough journey to motherhood.\n\nNatalie Cassidy, 40, first appeared on the serial drama three decades ago at the age of 10-years-old in 1993.\n\nRecently fans watched her character Sonia strike up a relationship with Reiss (played by Jonny Freeman).\n\nReiss is the great-nephew of the late Dot Branning (also Cotton) and together, they were desperate to have a baby but have faced a tough journey.\n\nScenes last year depicted Reiss' wife being rushed to hospital in a long-term coma after suffering a stroke.\n\nSonia was left in shock after the revelation that she was in a relationship with a married man, although she went forward with the relationship.\n\nSonia has since received IVF treatment due to his infertility where they recieved even more bad news.\n\nA nurse warned her colleague that her womb lining was thinner than she would have liked.\n\nSonia was also left devastated when she also found out that her pal Whitney Dean (played by Shona McGarty) was expecting a baby, as she thought pregnancy would not happen for her.\n\nBut eventually Sonia found out that she as pregnant as she emotionally relayed the news to her partner in The Queen Vic.\n\nNow, EastEnders fans think they know exactly what she will call her baby as they took to social media site Reddit, ahead of the soap's 40th anniversary.\n\nOne fan remarked: \"Sonia will probably give birth. Baby is probably getting named Dot/Dorothy.\"\n\nAnd others agreed with the viewer as someone else echoed: \"Yes!\"\n\nOn another EastEnders fan page on Facebook, the devotees discussed the pregnancy storyline.\n\nOne soap star wrote: \"I think she will name the baby Dot.\"\n\nThe legendary character of Dot was played by June Brown as one of the longest-serving stars on the BBC soap.\n\nHer debut as the chain-smoking gossip came in 1985 and she didn't step down until 2020.\n\nJune sadly passed away two years later in 2022 as her family released a statement that was shared by the show's official account on X.\n\nIt read: \"We are deeply saddened to announce our beloved mother, June, passed away very peacefully at her home in Surrey on Sunday evening, with her family by her side."
