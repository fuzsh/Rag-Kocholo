        "text": "3032 Railroad Avenue Ashland, KY 41101\n\nThe Unity Center pays tribute to Mrs. Carol Jackson with a mission of uniting our community in a safe atmosphere while promoting positivity, growth, and support. The Carol Jackson Unity Center will serve as the hub for the East Ashland residents by hosting personal improvement classes, providing access to city services, holding community-related events, and much more once COVID-19 restrictions lessen. To top it all off, the back lot is dedicated to an ADA compliant and inclusive state-of-the-art playground with brand new equipment and a six-inch crumb-rubber surface for the community kids to enjoy. The Unity Center also provides a safe space for citizens to meet with members of the Ashland Police Department and Code Enforcement to discuss local issues and concerns.\n\nAbout Carol Jackson\n\nNot only was Mrs. Jackson a resident of the East Ashland neighborhood, but she was also a community leader who dedicated her life to fighting discriminatory practices in housing, employment, public accommodations, and financial transactions. Mrs. Jackson passed away on March 10, 2018.\n\nMrs. Jackson was the first African-American woman elected to the Ashland Independent Board of Education, a board she would eventually chair. Her reputation as a strong leader and advocate for area children led to an appointment to the Kentucky Board of Education.\n\nShe was also President of the Boyd-Greenup County NAACP, where she used her voice and spirit while bringing people of all races together to fight discrimination. In this role, she was an advocate for change in the community she adored.\n\nMrs. Jackson also led the Ashland Human Rights Commission. Under her leadership, the organization provided safe meeting spaces for members of the Gay-Straight Student Alliance at Boyd County High School. She was inducted into the Kentucky Commission on Human Rights Hall of Fame in 2012."
