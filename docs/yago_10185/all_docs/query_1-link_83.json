        "text": "EastEnders aired a major twist on Tuesday night, that confirmed Terry Cant, played by actor Brian Conley, was a fraud.\n\nAfter suspicions about his reasons for heading to Walford, Terry, AKA Rocky, was confirmed to be an imposter - and he is not Sonia Fowler's father.\n\nRocky arrived in Walford earlier this year, claiming to be the estranged father of Sonia and they have since gotten to know each other.\n\nMany viewers questioned if this was the truth though, but he provided details about a letter she wrote and childhood facts that seemed to prove he was who he said he was.\n\nBut Tuesday's episode of the BBC soap revealed everything, including the fact Terry was lying and someone in Walford knew about it.\n\nIn fact, it was confirmed he was actually related to another Walford resident, and that they had teamed up against Sonia.\n\nTerry was arrested for scratching the car of Ethan, Sonia's new love interest, after he saw him cosying up to another woman in the club.\n\nAs he arrived at the police station he was questioned, and asked to give his real name with it soon confirmed he was not Terry at all.\n\nBut the real shock came when he announced his name to be Thomas Cotton, with it very clear he was instead related to Dotty Cotton.\n\nAs he was let go, Dotty was seen waiting for him outside and she soon scolded her 'Uncle Tom' for almost scuppering the plan against Sonia.\n\nRocky appeared to be remorseful for what he was doing to Sonia, causing Dotty to snap - and this was when their true link was finally made known.\n\nDotty confirmed that Tom, not Terry or Rocky, was in fact her uncle - possibly a sibling of her late villainous father Nick Cotton.\n\nShe reminded him that she should come first, as should their plan, and not Sonia seeing as though he isn't really her dad.\n\nDotty then confirmed what their plan was, revealing they are seeking a sort of revenge on Sonia because of Dotty's inheritance money from her grandmother Dot Cotton.\n\nSonia has been harbouring Dot's inheritance following her exit from Walford last year, with Dot giving her power of attorney back in April this year.\n\nDotty has been desperate to get her hands on what she is owed, and now she's using her secret uncle to do this while betraying Sonia in the process.\n\nShe made it clear to Thomas that they need to focus on their plan, or they will be left with nothing.\n\nBut will they succeed and will Tom go through with it, or will Sonia learn the truth before it is too late?"
