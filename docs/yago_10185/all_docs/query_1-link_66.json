        "text": "Upset to see him hurting, Sonia felt overwhelmed with the love she had for Martin and kissed him, after initially pulling away, Martin realised he needed her.\n\n“Why? Why do you still love me?” The fruit and veg market stall holder asked.\n\n“Because you’re my Martin,” Sonia explained but he stated: “I’ve not been your Martin for a long time. I’m just a different person now.”\n\n“Well you’re still the Martin I fell in love with when we were kids. You’re still the Martin who told me I wasn’t stupid or ugly,” Sonia said.\n\nIt can be presumed, the pair slept together, in an almighty plot twist, will Sonia end up pregnant with Martin’s child just as his wife Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner) returns to the Square?\n\nElsewhere, there is a chance Sam Mitchell (Daniella Westbrook) could make a comeback.\n\nIt comes after Phil explained how he had no other family, but Sam’s name was never mentioned.\n\nDoes this mean he is going to reach out and ask her for his help in his time of need?\n\nEastEnders returns tomorrow night on BBC One."
