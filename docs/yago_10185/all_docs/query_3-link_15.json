        "text": "Carol Jackson, late of Prince Albert, passed away peacefully with family by her side on November 29, 2020. Carol was born in Prince Albert and raised on the family farm in Spruce Home. She loved her career of over 30 years as a cake decorator, and it allowed her to showcase her incredible artistic ability. As well, Carol enjoyed both oil painting, and drawing. She took great delight in gardening, camping and the outdoors, flowers and plants. Children were drawn to Carol and she cherished the time spent with her children and grandchildren. Carol held a special relationship with her nieces and nephews. Carol will be lovingly remembered by her son, James (Nicole) and their children, Erika, Jesse, Carter and Carley; and her son, Michael; Carol’s siblings, Linda Cunningham and family, Stacey Kidd-Coutts (Scott Coutts) and daughter, Mileah and Stuart Kidd; Diane (Keith) Herzog and family, Leigh Anne (Shawn) Cripps and daughter Brianne, Derek and children Macaylah, Arien and Mason, and Janine and son, Ryder; Bob (Kathy) Jackson and family, Karyn (Will King), Braydon (Kyra Glover) and son Casey, Lundyn, Trace and Knox, Crystal (Chuck) Spencer and family, Shayden and Rylen; and her nephew, Christopher Jackson. She was predeceased by her parents, Norman and Elsie Jackson; and her brother, David Jackson. A Celebration of Carol’s Life will be held on the family farm at a later date.

Arrangements have been entrusted to the care of Beau “Lac” Funeral Home, Marianne Turcotte, Funeral Director, Prince Albert, SK 306-763-3322."
