        "text": "Carol Ann Jackson, 75, of Cumru Township, passed away peacefully at home on Wednesday, July 30, 2013. She was the widow of John Calvin Jackson Jr., who passed away October 5, 2010.\n\nBorn in West Reading, she was a daughter of the late Anthony P. and Philomena “Lena” J. (Sorrentino) Lavigna.\n\nShe was a 1956 graduate of West Reading High School and also earned a business diploma. Carol was employed by the Albright Alumni Office for many years, until her retirement, and was a long-standing supporter of the Albright Family.\n\nCarol loved the arts and was an avid patron and member of the Reading Civic Opera. She was an avid reader who devoured a book every few days. Carol was an intensely devoted mother and grandmother and will also be remembered for her love of music and theater, steadfast friendships and the joy she brought to every birthday, Christmas and special occasion in our lives.\n\nCarol is survived by one son, U.S. Air Force (Ret) Colonel John Calvin Jackson III, of Orlando, FL and his fiancee, Kelly Jo Bargain-nier; one daughter, Jayme Carol (Jackson), wife of John B. Stevenson of Darien CT; eight grandchildren: Taylor (23), Hannah (15) and Catherine (12) Jackson; Alexandra (23), Samantha (21), Charlett (19), Mckenna (17) and John (14) Stevenson; and one brother, Charles Lavigna of Sinking Spring.
