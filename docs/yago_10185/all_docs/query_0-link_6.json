        "text": "KATHY Beale was arrested for the fire that ravaged her café in Bridge Street and Sonia Fowler can only sympathise.\n\nThe EastEnders legend played by Natalie Cassidy was once taken to prison herself. Here's what you need to know.\n\nWhat happened to Sonia Fowler in EastEnders?\n\nReady to build her own family with Reiss Colwell (played by Jonny Freeman), the nurse recently agreed to go through the IVF process with him after finding out he was sterile.\n\nThe pair have grown closer in a handful of months after Reiss moved into Sonia's as her housemate.\n\nReiss was initially introduced as a member of the late Dot Cotton's family and he first showed up in Albert Square to attend her funeral.\n\nSince then, their connection became romantic.\n\nHowever, both characters are keeping their own secrets and one of Sonia's forgotten storylines was briefly mentioned during last night's (Tuesday, November 14, 2023) instalment of the BBC One soap.\n\nSonia has sympathised with Kathy Beale's (Gillian Taylforth) recent arrest as she was accused of burning down her own café by Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins).\n\nAnd while the truth and Rocky Cotton's involvement remain under wraps, Reiss was shocked to find out that his other half was once behind bars herself.\n\nReiss continuously questioned Sonia, desperate to know more about the woman he thought he knew so well.\n\nBut could finding out that she was once accused of murdering another Walford resident be a deal-breaker for Reiss?\n\nWhy did Sonia Fowler go to prison in EastEnders?\n\nDiehard fans of the London-based soap will remember that Sonia Fowler was arrested in early 2007, in the middle of Pauline Fowler's funeral.\n\nPauline, a Walford icon and one of the original twenty-three soap characters, was Sonia's mother-in-law during her marriage to Martin Fowler (then played by James Alexandrou).\n\nShe was found dead in the snow, next to her husband Arthur's bench, on Christmas Day in 2006, after succumbing to a brain haemorrhage.\n\nWhen it was revealed that the haemorrhage had been caused by a head injury, Sonia was immediately blamed due to her conflictual relationship with Pauline.\n\nIt all started six years before Pauline's death, when her son Martin was revealed to be the father of Sonia's daughter Chloe aka Bex.\n\nSonia became pregnant at the age of fifteen, giving birth to her daughter at home and she decided to put the baby up for adoption, which triggered a huge feud between the Jacksons and the Fowlers.\n\nEager to be involved in her granddaughter's life, Pauline demanded custody of the baby but she lost out.\n\nFive years later, Bex's adoptive parents were killed in a car accident, prompting Martin and Sonia (who were then married) to track her down.\n\nOnce again, Pauline demanded to be a part of Bex's life and paid her a secret visit during which she misled her adoptive grandmother Margaret Wilson in an attempt to have her son and Sonia named as the young girl's guardians in her will.\n\nThe plot backfired but Martin and Sonia were still given custody of Bex following Margaret's death.\n\nUnfortunately, this only made things more tense between Sonia and Pauline.\n\nWho really killed Pauline Fowler in EastEnders?\n\nBut while her feud with Pauline made her the perfect culprit, Sonia was actually never involved in the matriarch's death.\n\nBex was the first to suspect that her mother may have had a role in her grandmother's death but the real killer was none other than Pauline's own husband, Joe Macer - who, ironically, Martin has always suspected.\n\nIn January, 2007, Joe finally confessed what he had done to Dot Cotton and explained what had really happened.\n\nAt the time, both him and Pauline had been arguing and Joe returned to their home to fix things, but his wife refused, ordering him out.\n\nIn a fit of rage, after Pauline had continuously insulted him and dared him to \"be a man\", Joe picked up a nearby frying pan and hit her hard over the head.\n\nPauline was seemingly fine as Joe walked out but, as mentioned above, she passed away following the blow.\n\nDot tried to push Joe into doing the right thing and confessing but he held her hostage until her husband Jim Branning showed up.\n\nJoe Macer passed away during a huge showdown with Jim as he crashed through a window and fell into a market stall.\n\nSonia was eventually cleared of all suspicion but the ordeal was enough to trigger a huge amount of gossip throughout the Square and somewhat tarnish her reputation.\n\nEastEnders airs from Monday to Thursday at 7.30pm on BBC One."
