        "text": "Tell us about yourself and how many books you have written.\n\nI live in New Zealand where I was born and raised. My hubby was born in India – we have been married for more than 25 years. Our two kids are all grown and are currently living and working overseas. Now, we look after a Pomeranian dog called, Louie and his best friend is a ginger cat called, Donny.\n\nMy first book, Julie & Kishore is based my own life, the story of an inter-racial couple in the ’80s who faced trials and tribulations from family and friends during the course of their relationship.\n\nMy second book, Nina’s Art has many of the same characters but is a completely different story.\n\nWhat is the name of your latest book and what inspired it?\n\nNina’s Art was inspired by a painting my sister-in-law did for me. This is the painting on the front cover of the book. It is a romantic pose of myself and my hubby. After hanging the painting in my bedroom, I had a dream to write a story about an artist who paints different couples in romantic poses to enhance and at times save relationships. I began to write and this story grew and grew and became a book. It focuses on the lives of six couples and how they had a portrait painted by Nina, they each had a different reason to want a painting created by the artist and each result is unique in its own way.\n\nDo you have any unusual writing habits?\n\nMy writing ideas come to me in dreams! I keep a pen and paper beside my bed to write these thoughts down. To keep my writing ideas flowing I practice with cinquains and haikus.\n\nWhat authors, or books have influenced you?\n\nStories from my childhood have stayed in my memory more than the many, many books I have read throughout my life. I don’t know if they have influenced me because as a child they had a great effect on me, or they are just great books. Both of these reasons are probably true and here the books that I recall; Pollyanna by Eleanor H. Porter, Charlie & the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl, Charlotte’s Web by E.B. White and The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis.\n\nWhat are you working on now?\n\nI am continuing to write poetry as writing practice. I write short stories to enter in competitions to try to get my name ‘out there.’ I am also thinking of writing a third book, I am unsure yet as to the subject, but I have a few ideas that I am pondering.\n\nWhat is your best method or website when it comes to promoting your books?\n\nThe best method of promotion is to encourage readers to write an online review of your book. Another way is to get out there and meet real people and spread the word, in my opinion, word of mouth still works wonders with promotion. Also, keep on advertising your book on any online site that you can; twitter, facebook or Linkedin.\n\nDo you have any advice for new authors?\n\nKeep on trying, don’t give up. Write because you love to write not for fame and fortune. I would think every author dreams that their book would be made into a blockbuster movie and they become rich and famous, this may happen, but chances are it won’t.\n\nWhat is the best advice you have ever heard?\n\n‘Keep on swimming, keep on swimming…’ I take this as meaning don’t give up, just keep trying. There is not an easy way of doing things so don’t be discouraged and keep on keeping on.\n\nWhat are you reading now?\n\nThe Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith. This is the story of two women in love at a time when lesbian lovers were shunned. This book has also been made into a movie called, Carol. I have never read a book of this type before and it really made me think and empathise with Therese and Carol. Just like my own relationship with my own hubby, thank goodness times have changed.\n\nWhat’s next for you as a writer?\n\nAs well as deciding about writing a third book, I belong to a writing workshop called, IWW (International Writers’ Workshop). We have guest speakers (university lecturers, authors, journalists etc who run workshops and we have competitions throughout the year. I will keep on writing for myself and attend these workshops for my own personal development.\n\nIf you were going to be stranded on a desert island and allowed to take 3 or 4 books with you what books would you bring?\n\nA book on how to survive on a desert island?\n\nSeriously, I would want some of my all-time favorite books, the ones that have influenced me from my childhood (as mentioned above) are the books I remember the most; Lord of the Flies by William Golding, Charlottes Web by E.B. White, Pollyanna by Eleanor H. Porter or anything by Roald Dahl. These books have stayed in my memory more than the many books I have read since.\n\nAuthor Websites and Profiles\n\nCarol Jackson Website\n\nCarol Jackson Amazon Profile"
