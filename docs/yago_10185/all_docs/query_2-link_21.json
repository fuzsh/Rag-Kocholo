        "text": "Jack is a character that has been made up recently which is why there has been no mention of him before. It is easier to integrate a new character into an existing family than for them to pop up on their own or in a new family. It also extends the life span of the family. I guess it is something soaps have to do if they want to keep things move and make things more interesting.\n\nThe funny thing about Jack is he's described as the golden boy of the family in which case Jim would have mentioned him a lot to show how proud he is of him which he hasn't. Also correct me if I'm wrong but Jim never mentioned Max until he arrived.\n\n0\n\nI don't think Jim ever mentioned he had three sons. Before Max\n\ncame, Derek branning was the only son that was mentioned.\n\nDerek also appeared in some episodes in 1996 when Carol was getting married to Alan. Max and Jack have been obviously been made up by the writers. I think it is ridiculous to unnecessarily extend the Branning family to include sons that never existed.\n\n0\n\nHi Guys, i know im bringing it down to the shallowest possible level lol But, the guy who plays Jack in EE is rather gorgeous, so, whether he has been mentioned or not before, is rather trivial :rolleyes: But like i said, thats just my honest shallow opinion\n\n0\n\nCarol, Jack, Derek, Sue and April were all mentioned last week, when Max explained why they couldn't come to the wedding.\n\nI don't think Max was made up by the writers 'conveniently' like Jack has been, as i'm pretty Carol did mention both Derek and Max when she was in the show... and think Max was even on the EE website family tree for years before his arrival?\n\nHowever, Carol did used to go on about her brothers being and thuggish (they stopped her from being with David Wicks when she was young, and attacked Alan). So assuming she meant Derek and Max, the writers seem to have rewritten Max's character to make him a bit 'nicer' (i.e. a love rat rather than a thug).\n\n0\n\nThere's a possibility Max may have matured with age although the other day when he mentioned Derek he did seem a bit disapproving that his brother was in prison.\n\nBut the OP is wrong, Max has never been portrayed as an only child, how could he have been? Carol was in the show for years and we know she's his sister for one and that's not to mention the other siblings, 3 of whom have also appeared on screen.\n\n0\n\nwhats silly was when in the papers it said that bianca is returning even though her only family left in the square is granny pat butcher!!! what about all the brannings, sure mx and jack are her uncles and jim is her grandad and bradley is her cousin. do the soaps not employ people to monitor continuity??? i know they have new writers all the time but i get the impression some of these writers have never ever seen the show and dont even research? jack wasnt even on the branning family tree\n\n0\n\nit amazes me jim is potrayed in the soap as the loveable old happy go lucky guy who loves dot a bet and a few pints but me thinks he has an awful lot of skeletons in his cupboard very little is know about his past when did he come in how long is he there\n\n0"
