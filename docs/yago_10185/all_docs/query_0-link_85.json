        "text": "Natalie Cassidy has grown up on EastEnders. As Sonia Jackson she began as an awkward 10-year-old playing the trumpet badly and has ended up as one of the female stalwarts of the BBC1 soap. Via a broken marriage and a lesbian fling.\n\nHer real life has taken almost as many twists and turns as she battled yo-yo dieting, broken relationships and the loss of her mum.\n\nNow, as EastEnders prepares for its 30th anniversary specials next week, 31-year-old Natalie is opening her heart for the first time since her return to Albert Square last year. She reveals that although this time she’s come home to roost in E20, she’d never want her own daughter to become a child soap star like her.\n\nShe does not regret her own career but is adamant it wouldn’t be right for Eliza, four, who has already shown signs of wanting to follow in her mum’s footsteps.\n\n“I wouldn’t want her to do it because I don’t know what it’s like to not be recognised,” says Natalie. “It’s not a bad thing, because I’m so used to it, but I’d like her to retain her anonymity. I think it’s important. I’d like her to have that for her life, really. I don’t want her to have what I’ve had.\n\n“As soap stars we’re statistically the most famous people in Britain. Bigger than Brad Pitt because you might watch one film a month but we’re there four times a week. I don’t think I’ve ever been on holiday and not been recognised.”\n\nNatalie joined EastEnders in 1993 when the scriptwriters brought in the rowdy Jackson family. When she left in 2007 she was 23 and desperate to try new things. During a seven-year break she became a mum, appeared on Strictly Come Dancing, made fitness dvds (something she has vowed never to do again) and came back to the show for a brief reappearance in 2010.\n\nWhen the BBC prod­­ucers came calling last year, she had just one condition – that she would be back for the long run.\n\n“I said, ‘I will, but it has to be for a while. I don’t just want to pop in,’ ” she says.\n\nThe bosses agreed and have been true to their word. Natalie’s contract has just been renewed, prompting her to joke that she’ll still be there for the 60th birthday.\n\nShe has often relied on her screen family to help her through the tough times.\n\nThe toughest of all was in 2002 when her mum Evelyn died at just 63. A few months later she had to act out her grief when Sonia’s boyfriend Jamie Mitchell (Jack Ryder) died in her arms after\n\na car crash.\n\n“For me that was the hardest time I’ve had,” Natalie says quietly. “It was like therapy because my mum died in the May and this was filmed in the October. I basically grieved through doing that. The emotion you saw, those tears, they were real. It was raw.”\n\nShe was just 19 and it was friends in the cast who got her through it.\n\n“Being here got me through everything,” she says. “You’re like a family. You’ve got people to talk to and people to help you. I felt very lucky.”\n\nShe became closest of all to Wendy Richard, who played Pauline Fowler, and suffered another loss in 2009 when Wendy died from breast cancer at 66, three years after leaving the show.\n\n“She gave me good advice about practical things like pensions and we used to have fun,” recalls Natalie.\n\n“When I lost her I found it was a really big struggle. But it’s the same for anyone losing anyone. How do you get over it? By talking about that person and having lovely memories of them.”\n\nLast year’s emotive scenes when her screen mum Carol (Lyndsey Coulson) battled breast cancer were difficult for Natalie. As for her other storylines, she dismisses claims that she didn’t approve of the decision to make Sonia gay in 2006 and points to her recent illicit kiss with Tina Carter.\n\n“I didn’t leave because of the lesbian storyline,” she says. “It was way before I left and we’ve touched on it again.”\n\nSo is Sonia, until recently still married to Martin Fowler, gay or not?\n\n“Well, she’s bisexual isn’t she?” laughs Natalie.\n\nShe feels passionately about an issue recently highlighted by fellow working-class actress Julie Walters. That’s a “shocking” lack of acting opportunities for normal kids whose parents can’t afford drama school fees.\n\n“I went to Anna Scher in Islington and it was a working-class drama club which I went to after school and it cost £2.50. It doesn’t exist now,” she says. “There needs to be more of that, places where for a few quid you can have an hour of fun which might just lead to something.\n\n“Kathy Burke, Linda Robson, Pauline Quirke, Perry Fenwick, Patsy Palmer, Sid Owen, me. We all came from there.”\n\nShe adds: “We are very rooted people because we went to normal school and had normal mates and it wasn’t about fame. It was about doing something that you enjoyed.”\n\nShe has nothing against the current public school crop of well-known stars such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Eddie Redmayne and Damian Lewis.\n\n“They’re bloody good actors – but there should be room for both,” she says.\n\nThough she doesn’t want Eliza to be a child actor she does let her go to a drama club for the social benefits, and is even thinking of opening her own after-school club. “It really appeals to me – to have the space for kids and do what Anna did and carry it on. I think about that often,” she says.\n\nThese days home is very much where the heart is for Natalie, who is in a relationship with BBC cameraman Marc Humphries after splitting with Eliza’s dad in 2013. Now she says she’d rather go home and cook than go out to celebrity restaurant The Ivy.\n\n“All I know is that I’m really happy,” she says. “I am the most content I’ve ever been. It’s brilliant. I’m in a lovely place right now. Work’s good, life’s good, family are good. It’s all good.”\n\nShe knows next week’s 30th anniversary shows, which will have live scenes in every episode and a fully live half-hour on Friday, are going to be hard work. “I haven’t done a live EastEnders before so I feel really excited about it,” she says.\n\n“Everyone’s watching to see us f*** up anyway. It lets the audience in on the secret and it makes it a bit special.”\n\nShe claims not to know who will be revealed as Lucy Beale’s killer and hopes the secret doesn’t leak out.\n\n“It would be such a shame,” she says.\n\n“I’d go on strike. I’d say I’m not coming in, I’m ill. There’s no point.”\n\nAnd will she race home and watch it afterwards? Not a chance. “Next week is relentless so I’ll be going home to bed – I’ll watch it all later.”\n\nJust one more question for Natalie. Where is that trumpet?\n\nThe answer is – in her dad’s loft. She has joked about selling it on eBay but she’s now thinking of putting it on display at home.\n\n“I’d like to box frame it and put it up on the wall in the study,” she says, laughing. “That would be nice.”\n\nJust as long as you don’t play it again, Nat..."
