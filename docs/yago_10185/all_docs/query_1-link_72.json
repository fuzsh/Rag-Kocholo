        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History Of Sonia\n\nSonia is a delightful feminine name derived from a popular Russian name ‘Sonya.’ Sonya is an abbreviation of Sofiya, which has its roots in the Greek name ‘Sophia,’ signifying ‘wisdom.’ Throughout history, the name Sonia has been borne by notable individuals, including Sonja Haraldsen, who became the Queen of Norway and the wife of King Harald V.\n\nApparently, the name gained popularity in the English-speaking world with Sonya, a passive redemptive figure displayed in Crime and Punishment, a novel by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. The novel was originally published in 1866 and was translated into English later in 1885. Sonia: Between Two Worlds by Stephen McKenna is another novel with a character named Sonia.\n\nIn addition to Russia, the name is also used across the West, South Asia, and Iran. Due to this widespread usage, the name has multiple spellings and pronunciations. For instance, in Scandinavian countries, the letter ‘I’ is often spelled as ‘J,’ so the name is commonly spelled as ‘Sonja’ in those regions. However, when speaking English, people typically replace the ‘J’ with ‘Y’ or ‘I,’ resulting in variations such as ‘Sonya’ and ‘Sonia.’ Additionally, the name has some adorable nicknames, including Soni, Sonie, and Sonny.\n\nIn the world of fiction, the name Sonia appears in multiple fictional stories and series, such as Sonia Belmont, a key character of ‘Castlevania Legends’, the third edition of the Castlevania series. Sonia Ganguli was a character in ‘The Namesake’, the debut novel of the American author Jhumpa Lahiri, which was originally published in The New Yorker magazine.\n\nSonia Fowler is a fictional character in the British soap opera ‘EastEnders’. ‘Pink Panther 2’, an American comedy-drama also has a character named Sonia Solandres. In 1907, the English operetta ‘The Merry Widow’ included a character named Sonia. Similarly, Sonia Rey was a beautiful character featured in ‘Rebelde Way,’ an Argentine telenovela.\n\nHow To Pronounce Sonia?\n\n‘Sonia’ In QR Code\n\nNotable People Named Sonia\n\nThis section covers people who have made the name Sonia famous with their contributions in various fields.
