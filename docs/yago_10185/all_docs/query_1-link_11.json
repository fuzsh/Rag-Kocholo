        "text": "EastEnders fans reckon they know what Sonia Fowler will be naming her baby.\n\nIn the soap last year, Sonia (Natalie Cassidy) struck up a relationship with Reiss (Jonny Freeman). The pair were desperate to have a child but faced several hurdles - including Reiss’ infertility.\n\nWhat’s more, in a tragic twist it was revealed last year that Reiss’ wife was hospitalised with a long-term coma after suffering a stroke in the bath. At first, Sonia was taken aback by dating a technically married man.\n\nREAD MORE: EastEnders viewers 'losing their minds' as they 'forgot' Bianca is related to resident\n\nREAD MORE: Click for more brilliant Daily Star TV stories\n\nBut she soon changed her tune. The soap icon then started her romance with Reiss, who is the great-nephew of the late Dot Branning. And longing to have a baby, and despite a long wait, Sonia and Reiss managed to get IVF with Sonia undergoing treatment.\n\nThe couple were dealt a blow though, when a nurse warned Sonia her womb lining was thinner than ideal. Things took a more upsetting turn for Sonia when she found out pal Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) was up the duff - leaving Sonia devastated, and thinking she wasn’t going to pregnant.\n\nAnd over in Walford last month, Sonia found out she was pregnant. After taking a test and, in emotional scenes, she told Reiss in the Queen Vic the happy baby news.\n\nNow, fans reckon they have ‘worked out’ what she will call her baby. On an Eastenders Reddit thread, fans were sharing their theories on the soap’s 40th anniversary.\n\nOne viewer said: “Sonia will probably give birth. Baby is probably getting named Dot/Dorothy.” Someone else agreed and penned: “Yes!” While on an EastEnders Facebook fan page, fans were discussing Sonia’s pregnancy, with one writing: “I think she will name the baby Dot.”\n\nDot, played by June Brown, was an EastEnders Legend. As one of the longest-serving actors on the soap, she made her debut as the chain-smoking Dot in 1985 and stepped down in 2020.\n\nIn 2022, actress June sadly died. June's family released a statement that was posed on the official EastEnders Twitter account.\n\nIt read: \"We are deeply saddened to announce our beloved mother, June, passed away very peacefully at her home in Surrey on Sunday evening, with her family by her side."
