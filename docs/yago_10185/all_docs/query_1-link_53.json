        "text": "EastEnders fans want answers, after the news that newcomer Rocky is not the real Terry Cant - but is a man named Tom Cotton.\n\nThe character arrived in Walford four whole months ago, and has remained undetected the entire time.\n\nUp until now, Tom, who goes by the name Rocky, has claimed to be Sonia Fowler's long-lost father and he's been building a life for himself in Walford.\n\nBut Tuesday saw the big reveal that he wasn't who he said he was, and was not Sonia's dad Terry after all.\n\nIt was soon exposed that his name was Thomas Cotton, and he is the uncle of Dotty.\n\nWith this revelation came the dark twist that Dotty has trying to fleece Sonia of her grandmother Dot's inheritance money.\n\nIn the latest visit to Walford on Thursday, it was clear Tom was having second thoughts.\n\nBut there was something about the entire plot that was playing on the minds of viewers, especially given Rocky has been in Walford since May.\n\nBack in May, Sonia was not initially sold that Rocky was her real dad, but he soon answered several family related questions.\n\nHe even \"recognised\" her uncle Jack Branning, and while the recognition wasn't mutual Jack did assume it was Terry he was speaking with.\n\nThis of course is not the case, as confirmed this week, but the truth has left fans with some unanswered questions.\n\nMany believe Sonia has made two big mistakes with this, after welcoming Rocky into her life and getting to know him.\n\nSome fans believe she should immediately have asked him to take a DNA test to confirm who he was.\n\nOthers were more confused as to why Sonia didn't get in touch with her mum, Terry's ex, Carol, or even other members of the family who might have remembered Terry from years ago.\n\nThe latter point would surely have exposed Tom if Sonia had sent an image of her 'dad' to her mother.\n\nTaking to Twitter, one viewer wrote: \"You’d think she’d have asked him for a DNA test or at least call her mum Carol to talk about her 'dad' or ask Uncle Jack to do a background check, him being a copper.\"\n\nAnother said: \"I don't understand why Sonia wouldn't have mentioned that her bio-dad had shown up to her mum and she wouldn't be like 'er no that's not your dad'.\"\n\nA third added: \"Always suspected Rocky wasn’t Sonia’s father, but didn’t see that one coming #Eastenders Did Sonia never ring her mum to double check he really was her dad? DNA? Her character is a nurse after all.\"\n\nAnother wrote: \"Not being funny but if I was Sonia I would've mentioned to my mum on the phone that my dad's got in contact and then she would've said 'um that aint him' and that would be this s**t storyline over.\""
