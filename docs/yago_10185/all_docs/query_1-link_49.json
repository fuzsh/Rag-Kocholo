        "text": "Natalie Cassidy has spoken about the “difficult time” she faced following the death of EastEndersco-star June Brown in 2022.\n\nThe actor who first appeared as Sonia Fowler on the BBC soap opera in 1993, led the cast during the emotional funeral storyline of her on-screen grandmother Dot Cotton, played by Brown.\n\nIt came after the real-life death of veteran actress Brown in April 2022 at the age of 95.\n\n“It was very, very difficult for me because obviously I’ve lost a dear friend,” Cassidy told The Mirror.\n\n“She taught me a lot and we had a lot of laughs over the years. When she was 82 years old she’d be partying in a nightclub, and she was just so amazing.”\n\nCassidy said there was “a lot resting on my shoulders” during the funeral scenes, but said she thinks she did Brown “proud”.\n\nBrown’s chain-smoking Dot was perhaps EastEnders’ best-known star, joining the cast in the show’s first year, 1985.\n\nShe won several awards for her portrayal of Dot, including a lifetime achievement honour at the 2005 British Soap Awards, and in December 2021 she was made an OBE for services to drama and to charity.\n\nCassidy will next be seen fronting a new podcast with Gavin & Stacey star Joanna Page, after the pair met last year on ITV’s Loose Women.\n\n“We clicked immediately,” Welsh star Page said.\n\nThe pair are set to launch a new BBC Sounds podcast titled Off The Telly, as they discuss three or four shows each week.\n\nIt comes after Gavin & Stacey star Ruth Jones, who co-created the hit BBC sitcom with James Corden, denied rumours of another reunion.\n\nPage said: “It’s all gone absolutely mad with those rumours and it’s so sweet and lovely that everybody still loves the show.\n\n“But cross my heart, I honestly don’t know. I’d never ask Ruth (Jones) or James (Corden) if they’re planning on writing any more. That would look a bit sad, wouldn’t it?\n\n“But would I do the show again? I’d absolutely jump at it. It was a fantastic job with a fabulous cast. We had a right laugh from start to finish. My children recently watched the first Christmas special which they loved.”\n\nWith additional reporting from PA."
