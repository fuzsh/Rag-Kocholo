        "text": "EastEnders fans are in for a treat as Bianca Jackson, played by Patsy Palmer, is set to return to Walford. The iconic character, who first graced our screens back in 1993, made a comeback earlier this year as part of Whitney Dean's (Shona McGarty) exit storyline.\n\nAfter Whitney's departure and a fallout with Bianca, the fiery redhead decided to stay in Walford, moving in with her sister Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) and Sonia's partner Reiss Colwell (Jonny Freeman).\n\nHowever, drama ensued when Bianca discovered that Reiss had been funding his and Sonia's IVF journey by stealing from his wife Debbie, who was in a coma. A horrified Bianca ended up revealing the secret at the Vic while under the influence.\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Bianca hopped into her taco van and drove out of the square, leaving Walford behind her.\n\nBut it seems Bianca's time away from Walford will be short-lived, as the soap has confirmed she'll be returning in the coming months. And she won't be alone - her father David Wicks (Michael French) is said to be \"hot on her tail,\" reports the Daily Star.\n\nThe last time Bianca and David, who share a complicated relationship, saw each other was over a decade ago. Fans will remember that David moved to America following the breakdown of his relationship with Bianca's mother, Carol Jackson.\n\nDavid Wicks is set for another explosive return to EastEnders later this year. Michael French, who plays the iconic character, shared his excitement, saying: \"I feel honoured to be asked to reprise the role of David Wicks once again.\"\n\nHe added: \"It may only be a brief visit, but we know from his past that David never fails to create a lot of drama in a very short time.\"\n\nChris Clenshaw, the soap's Executive Producer, also expressed his delight, stating: \"David Wicks is undoubtedly one of EastEnders' most beloved rogues, and we are thrilled to welcome the talented Michael French back to the legendary role as we lead up to the show's 40th anniversary. David's character was never shy of drama during his previous stints, and I can assure you this return will be no different.\"\n\nFans of the show are no strangers to dramatic returns as Cindy Beale (played by Michelle Collins) returned from beyond the grave last year, whilst Jane Beale (portrayed by Laurie Brett) made a surprise comeback last month.\n\nPlus, last month saw the confirmation that Chrissie Watts, performed by Tracy-Ann Oberman, is set to stir things up in Walford again, nearly two decades after her departure."
