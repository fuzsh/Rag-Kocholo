        "text": "\"I hope you're the flaming stripper!\"\n\nWhenever someone mentions Eastenders, it's impossible to ignore the soap's nostalgia. One of the reasons why we love it is because of those iconic lines we find ourselves reciting more times than we can count.\n\nWhether the scenes were supposed to be serious or not, they'll never stop being quotable! So in honour of this legendary soap, let's list some quotes, shall we?\n\n1. \"You b*tch, you cow!\" – Pat Butcher and Peggy Mitchell\n\n2. \"Will you listen to yourself, you stupid fat old tart!\" – Peggy Mitchell\n\n3. \"Get outta my pub!\" – Peggy Mitchell\n\n4. \"Oh yeah?

I became a total slag\" – Kat Slater\n\n7. \"Don't talk to me about running a family, you couldn't even run a bath!\" – Mick Carter\n\n8. \"You want some, do ya? Eh?\" – Phill Mitchell\n\n9. \"You need slappin' down\" – Ben Mitchell\n\n10. \"Rickaaaayy!!!!\" – Bianca Jackson\n\n11. \"You're a mug\" – Janine Butcher\n\n12. \"If only he'd worn slip-on shoes!\" – Janine Butcher\n\n13. \"That's the difference between me and you, cause while you were sitting around waiting, doing nish, I was out making moves\" – Michael Moon\n\n14. \"I'm drinking tea\" – Michael Moon\n\n15. \"This great big fat man sat on me, said he couldn't see me\" – Jean Slater\n\n16. \"It makes me wonder what they think about my, erm, fishy basket\" – Jean Slater\n\n17. \"Ooh, I say\" – Dot Cotton\n\n18. \"You want to bring up Chloe? You couldn't bring up phlegm\" – Sonia Fowler\n\n19. \"Bubbly's in the fridge\" – Vanessa Gold\n\n20. \"Out of nowhere, I end up mashing up Bambi\" – Fatboy\n\n21. \"My son is in the kitchen eating a biscuit\" – Sharon Watts\n\n22. \"Oi, shoulder pads\" – Shirley Carter\n\n23. \"I've got nothing left\" – Ian Beale\n\n24. \"No man is ever gonna want to marry you, and you want to know why? Cause you got ginger hair\" – Dotty Cotton\n\n25. \"Your NFI. Not flippin' invited!\" – Tiffany Butcher\n\nI'm sure we can all agree that there were countless lines that we all love! But before you go ahead and tell me yours in the comments, it's time to have your say on who you think takes the top spot.\n\nShare This Article"
