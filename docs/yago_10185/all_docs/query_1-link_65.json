        "text": "Sonia Fowler has discovered she is expecting a baby with boyfriend Reiss Colwell following their IVF treatment, but the dad-to-be is continuing to scam Sharon Watts as his money troubles spiral.\n\nDuring Monday's trip to Walford (July 22), Sonia confided in long-term friend Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) over her fears of finding out she is pregnant. As viewers of the BBC One soap will remember, Sonia thought she was expecting a child a short while ago, but was devastated to eventually learn she'd had a blighted ovum and was never actually pregnant.\n\nHowever, following another round of IVF Sonia's dreams have come true. Kathy encouraged Sonia to do a pregnancy test as they waited patiently for the result.\n\nREAD MORE: EastEnders legend cryptically hints 'crew are more my friends than anyone else' on set\n\nREAD MORE: Click for more brilliant Daily Star TV stories\n\nBut elsewhere, Reiss' money troubles snowballed as Debbie's care home called demanding he paid her fees. Desperate raise the funds, Reiss paid Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) a visit informing her of an unpaid tax bill.\n\nReiss even blamed Sharon forgetting about the payments due to Keanu Taylor (Danny Taylor) being murdered. Sharon told Reiss how her former partner Keanu liked him which is why she trusted him with her business accounts.\n\nHe then went to see his comatose wife Debbie, confessing his guilt over his behaviour and the mess he had got himself into, made worse by scamming Sharon and lying to Sonia.\n\nBut when he arrived home, Sonia revealed the news that she was expecting a baby, and Reiss's stress was momentarily eased by their shared joy. Sonia's joy was soon dampened when Reiss played down their chances of a successful pregnancy.\n\nAs he tried to make amends with Sonia, he came clean about how much he owed the care home and the fact that they were threatening to move Debbie out. Reiss then paid Sharon another visit and demanded £13.5k for her outstanding tax bill.\n\nFollowing Sonia's announcement, EastEnders immediately took to social media to predict when Sonia and Reiss' baby was due - pointing out that it could arrive in eight months time which is the 40th anniversary of the BBC One soap.\n\nAs viewers will know, any big celebration in Walford comes a whole lot of drama and in February 2025 the soap will turn 40 years old, leaving fans fearing for Sonia. Taking to X, one person wrote: \"If my timings and theories are correct Sonia is scheduled to give birth on 40th week and Reiss has been a slow burning storyline that will reach climax at same time.\"\n\nA second added: \"Sonia's baby better stick this time and she gives birth on her sofa with Mo at the 40th. I can't do ANOTHER round of Sonia complaining about her uterus and ovum #EastEnders.\"\n\nA third asked: \"If the 40th is going to focus on Sonia? There won’t be need for any NyQuil or sleeping meds.\n\n\"40th anniversary theory: think Sonia could give birth and the implant will take next month (9 months till Feb 2025). Mo will deliver the kid, Denise will ring an ambulance like she did for Kim in 2015 as 2 throwbacks?? #EastEnders\", predicted another."
