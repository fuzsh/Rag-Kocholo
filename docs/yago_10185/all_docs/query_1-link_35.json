He told officers his name is Thomas Cotton.\n\nAs he was released, Dotty waited and scolded him for almost ruining their plan.\n\nWhen Rocky explained he hated seeing Sonia with someone like Ethan, Dotty was annoyed as he’s not Sonia’s father, but her uncle, and he should be putting Dotty first.\n\nShe makes it clear they need to keep their eye on the prize – getting the inheritance money from Sonia or they will both have nothing.\n\nWhy is Thomas pretending to by Sonia’s father?\n\nActor Brian Conley, who plays Thomas, aka Rocky, has explained why Thomas is pretending to be Sonia’s dad.\n\nHe revealed: “He’s pretending to be Sonia’s dad because he has been brought in by Dotty, who has given him all the back story to be able to confine Sonia he’s her father, to fleece her out of her money from Dot.”\n\nHe’s pretending to be Sonia’s dad because he has been brought in by Dotty.\n\n“Dot gave the house to Dotty, and Sonia feels like Dotty isn’t old enough to take on the responsibility of having the wealth of this house.\n\nRead more: EastEnders spoilers: Next week revealed in all-new pictures – September – October 1\n\n“So they’ve been convincing her that – yes this is her dad and enough so that she has the confidence and trust to listen to what he says.\n\n“However as he goes on he feels more strongly that this is his world now and he doesn’t want to give it up.\n\n“He’s gone in with his bravado thinking yes I can handle this, lets get all this money. But as the weeks and months have gone on, he very much realises now that this is his home, this is his family.\n\n“It’s very well-written, I’m really excited for people to see it.”\n\nBrian also confirmed that Rocky is related to Dotty’s villain father, Nick Cotton.\n\nWant more spoilers from EastEnders?
