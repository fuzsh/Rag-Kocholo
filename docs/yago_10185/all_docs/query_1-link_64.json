But that wasn’t the end of Kathy! Nine years after her ‘death’ she came back to Albert Square.\n\nKathy settled back into Square life, bought The Albert and is running Ian’s businesses in the wake of his departure.\n\nShe has supported her son, Ben, following his rape, and has recently married Rocky Cotton.
