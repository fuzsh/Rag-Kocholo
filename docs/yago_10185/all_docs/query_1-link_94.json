        "text": "Sonia Fowler has just found out she's pregnant with boyfriend Reiss Colwell's baby after their IVF treatment, but the soon-to-be dad is still scamming Sharon Watts as his financial woes continue to escalate.\n\nIn Monday's episode of EastEnders (22 July), Sonia shared her pregnancy fears with her long-time friend Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth). Fans of the BBC One soap will recall that Sonia previously thought she was pregnant, only to be heartbroken when she discovered she'd had a blighted ovum and wasn't actually expecting.\n\nBut now, after another round of IVF, Sonia's dreams have become reality. Kathy urged Sonia to take a pregnancy test, and they anxiously awaited the result.\n\nMeanwhile, Reiss' financial problems were mounting as Debbie's care home called demanding payment for her fees. In a desperate bid to raise the money, Reiss visited Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) and told her about an unpaid tax bill.\n\nReiss even suggested that Sharon had forgotten about the payments because of Keanu Taylor's (Danny Taylor) murder. Sharon confided in Reiss that her former partner Keanu liked him, which is why she trusted him with her business accounts, reports the Daily Star.\n\nHe then visited his comatose wife Debbie, confessing his guilt over his actions and the predicament he'd landed himself in, made worse by scamming Sharon and lying to Sonia.\n\nEastEnders viewers were sent into a whirlwind when Sonia Fowler dropped the bombshell that she's pregnant, giving Reiss a moment of relief amidst his financial woes. But the future dad was quick to temper expectations about the pregnancy.\n\nReiss tried to mend fences with a worried Sonia, admitting how his debts were endangering Debbie's care home situation. In an urgent twist, he confronted Sharon, pressing her for a hefty £13.5k to cover a looming tax bill.\n\nThe baby news has the EastEnders fandom speculating fervently across social media, buzzing about a potential due date that intriguingly coincides with the soap's landmark 40th anniversary in eight months. Big anniversaries tend to bring major drama to Walford, and as the 40th year approaches in February 2025, fans are bracing themselves for an explosive storyline centring around Sonia.\n\nTaking to Twitter, one viewer speculated, \"If my timings and theories are correct Sonia is scheduled to give birth on 40th week and Reiss has been a slow burning storyline that will reach climax at same time.\"\n\nAnother chimed in anxiously, \"Sonia's baby better stick this time and she gives birth on her sofa with Mo at the 40th. I can't do ANOTHER round of Sonia complaining about her uterus and ovum #EastEnders.\"\n\nWhile another questioned the dramatic potential, \"If the 40th is going to focus on Sonia? There won't be need for any NyQuil or sleeping meds.\"\n\n\"40th anniversary theory: think Sonia could give birth and the implant will take next month (9 months till Feb 2025). Mo will deliver the kid, Denise will ring an ambulance like she did for Kim in 2015 as 2 throwbacks? ? #EastEnders\", speculated another fan, sharing their predictions for a major throwback moment on the show's 40th anniversary."
