But can she help solve her daughter’s problems?\n\nSonia was last seen in Walford back in September 2016, departing once again when actress Natalie’s maternity leave begun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent weeks, a number of soap fans have questioned whether a reappearance could be on the horizon, given Bex’s many ongoing issues.\n\nThe character was at the centre of the action on January’s bus crash, while she’s still dealing with the news that Michelle Fowler was sleeping with her boyfriend behind her back."
