        "text": "Posted July 1, 2023\n\nDear Family,\n\nAFIRM is growing hope for families and children – one father at a time.\n\nYou may have heard about Families Matter’s newest fatherhood initiative AFIRM (A Father’s Involvement Really Matters).\n\nThe AFIRM program is designed to support fathers to take control of their lives while understanding how to love, honor, protect, care for, and financially support their families and the children they have fathered. Whereas this program is designed to educate, train and mentor fathers in the Child Support system, a recent alignment with Juvenile Court supports our efforts with new fathers who do not have a child support case; however, establishing a child support case is likely.\n\nIn our work with community partners and the subcontractors working with Families Matter on this initiative, we have a saying “Recruitment is Everyone’s Business.” We are pushing this initiative because, at Families Matter, we believe “A Father’s Involvement Really Does Matter.” This is not a slick slogan for us. It is our belief. Our fatherhood facilitators intentionally work with fathers in the AFIRM program, assisting them in learning how to value themselves while understanding the need to be present and available to their families and children.\n\nIn February 2023, Families Matter’s new program initiative began. In April, we received our first person in the Co-Parenting Class. On July 6, 2023, six fathers graduated from our first class. Enjoy the video below showing fathers’ excitement after taking the fatherhood classes. The momentum and excitement from that evening are carrying forward to our next graduating class in August.\n\nBecause recruitment is everyone’s business – let me take this opportunity to ask you to support me in my recruitment efforts. If you know a father who will benefit from being involved with men of character and wants to learn more about being a responsible and involved dad, please call me at (901) 351-1124. I am not a fatherhood facilitator in any of the Fatherhood classes; however, I am an ambassador for everyone entering Families Matter’s programs.\n\nFor additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at carol@fmmemphis.org or (901) 351.1124.\n\nPlease share the information below with those who may benefit from becoming aware of the Families Matter programs. We welcome fathers to come and participate in class sessions while enjoying other Families Matter Fatherhood Initiatives amenities.\n\nThank you,\n\nCarol Jackson\n\nExecutive Director"
