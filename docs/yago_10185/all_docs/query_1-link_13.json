        "text": "In her two decades on Albert Square Sonia Fowler has become a household name, loved by fans around the country.\n\nThe nation has watched her character grow as she married Martin Fowler and had their daughter, Rebecca.\n\nOff-screen, Natalie Cassidy is just as loved and even starred in a reality tv show about her journey to parenthood.\n\nNatalie Cassidy: Becoming Mum gave a sneak peek into the actress's real life behind the scenes.\n\nShe's often open with fans about everyday aspects of her life - shocking fans with photos of her awful hay fever symptoms just yesterday and opening up about how she's struggled to cope with high pollen levels this year.\n\nBut her love life has been something of a mystery at times - and she's had her fair share of real-life tragedy too.\n\n'Secret' co-star fiancé\n\nWhen Eastenders Secrets of the Square aired last summer, many fans were stunned when they were introduced to a cameraman who had worked on the show for years - and is engaged to 37-year-old Natalie in real life.\n\nMarc Humphreys, who works behind the scenes every day, was pointed out to host Stacey Dooley by Adam Woodyatt, who plays Ian Beale.\n\nIn a quip to presenter, Adam said: \"We can't stand Marc!\"\n\nThen he revealed the bombshell: \"We have to be nice to him because he's with Nat.\"\n\nStacey was as stunned as viewers as she turned to Marc and asked: \"Are you? You're Sonia's husband?\"\n\nThe pair, who have been together since 2014, tend to keep their relationship private, but she has treated fans to a glimpse of him from time to time.\n\nLast year she posted an adorable photo of herself and Marc on Instagram with a gushing caption.\n\nShe wrote: “It doesn’t really matter what’s going on as long as we have each other.\n\n\"And yes. My nose is rather large. '#soulmates #laughteristhebestmedicine #kidsareinbed #peaceatlast.”\n\nDad's tragic death\n\nAlthough smitten in her relationship, Natalie's personal life was hit by tragedy this year when she shared the heartbreaking news her dad Charles had died at the age of 84.\n\nNatalie posted a touching tribute to her dad on Instagram after his passing, underneath a selfie of herself and her dad smiling in the sun.\n\nShe wrote: \"I’ve been very quiet the last few weeks. I lost my precious daddy three weeks ago today.\n\n\"I wasn’t really going to do this post, but I felt I can’t come on here and be a knob without letting everyone know that my life has changed.\n\n\"He was my whole world and I’m not sure what I’m going to do without him. All I know is my family, friends and work will make it easier. I cannot believe how lucky I am to have such wonderful people in my life.\"\n\nShe added: \"It really is at these times you realise how important relationships are and company and friendship and love is so important. Losing anyone is hard. The NEVER seeing someone again is cruel. But it’s part of life. And we go on and have our memories.\n\n\"Charles William Cassidy 1937-2021. The best dad and grandad in the world. We miss you so much but we have each other because of you.\"\n\n'Breaking point'\n\nIt's been a tough time for Nat recently, who revealed how crippling hayfever has been ruining her life.\n\nIn a shocking video the actress was barely recognisable as showed off her swollen face.\n\nNatalie said she can barely open her eyes and is even struggling to breathe as her symptoms are so bad this year.\n\nRevealing her ordeal on Insta, she admitted: \"I wanted to see if everyone is enjoying the weather, because I'm not.\n\n\"I can’t breathe. I can’t see hardly, and this hay fever is off the wall this year.\n\n\"It’s not an enjoyable experience, and I’d like to pour Optrex into my eyes all day and get into a freshly-washed bed, which has been in the tumble dryer unfortunately, not on a line, which you should want - and I want to go to sleep and wake up in October.\n\n\"I'm going to try and go outside and enjoy the paddling pool with me children, but I'm at breaking point.\""
