        "text": "With the usual outrageous drama kicking off in Albert Square, it's no surprise to EastEnders fans how shocking the latest stories can be when they hit the headlines.\n\nHowever, it's never easy when we have to say goodbye to some of our favourite EastEnders characters — and 2023 was a year full of emotional, dramatic and unexpected farewells.\n\nLola Pearce-Brown (Danielle Harold), Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters), Rocky Cotton (Brian Conley) and many more all left the soap last year.\n\nWe also welcomed back a number of familiar faces to the Square, from Yolande Trueman (Angela Wynter) to Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins).\n\nHowever, as we prepare to say another heartbreaking goodbye to more characters in 2024, let's take a look at who is returning and the newcomers set to call Walford their home...\n\nWho is leaving EastEnders in 2024?\n\nHere is our roundup of each Walford resident saying farewell to the Square...\n\nBobby Beale\n\nEastEnders star Clay Milner Russell has quit the soap after five years and will leave his role of Bobby Beale later this year.\n\nClay, who is the fifth actor to play killer Bobby Beale, has decided to leave the soap to pursue other roles.\n\nA source told The Sun: “Clay’s a talented actor and he’s ambitious. He was never going to stay in EastEnders forever. He’s loved playing Bobby but he became an actor to play all kinds of roles and he wants to do that. The door is being left open but for now it’s a definite goodbye.”\n\nAn insider added to the publication: “Clay is a young actor so he wants to use these years to try his hand at other roles.\n\n“He absolutely loves working on EastEnders and has made such great friends on the show so it was really difficult for him to make that decision, but having been a part of the show since 2019, he now feels like the time is right to explore other options.”\n\nAn EastEnders spokeswoman confirmed the news in a statement: “We can confirm that Clay will be leaving EastEnders later on this year, and we wish him the best for the future.”\n\nBobby returned to Walford in 2019 after a stint in a young offenders institute after he killed his sister Lucy Beale and changed his life around by converting to Islam. He also suffered a breakdown and nearly died in the café fire that was caused by his grandfather Rocky Cotton. Now, he is in a relationship with Anna Knight.\n\nWho left EastEnders in 2024?\n\nSome much-loved characters have already left the soap this year...\n\nBianca Jackson\n\nEastEnders announced the return of Bianca Jackson as Patsy Palmer reprised the iconic role after four years.\n\nThe much-loved character last appeared in the Square in 2019, but she returned for a short stint when Whitney Dean and boyfriend Zack Hudson (James Farrar) visited her in Milton Keynes following her off-screen break-up with Terry.\n\nHowever, Bianca is never far away from drama and it wasn't long before chaos kicked off!\n\nBianca first appeared on the soap in 1993 as the fiery, sharp-tongued daughter of Carol Jackson and remains heavily connected to Walford through the Branning family as well as step-daughter Whitney and sister Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy).\n\nBianca returned in spring as part of a special episode focusing on Whitney and the drama she faced in Milton Keynes.\n\nShe made another comeback to the Square and discovered that Zack had cheated on Whitney with her best friend Lauren Branning.\n\nWhen Bianca found out, she threatened to expose their fling, but was stopped when Whitney proposed to Zack. Eventually, their affair was exposed on Whitney's wedding day and Bianca kept it a secret from her adopted daughter that she knew the whole time.\n\nBianca left Walford in June after discovering Reiss had been using his wife's savings to fund his IVF with Sonia. Bianca and Sonia fell out and Bianca drove off in her taco van, leaving Walford behind.\n\nMonique and Xavier Knight\n\nJunior Knight's wife Monique (Busayo Ige) and their son Xavier also arrived in the Square and moved into the Vic.\n\nHowever, Monique is oblivious to the fact that Junior cheated on her with Bianca Jackson and his dad's ex Cindy Beale, but he soon confessed to his infidelity leaving Monique and Xavier to leave the Square once again.\n\nWhitney Dean\n\nWhitney Dean (Shona McGarty) bid an emotional farewell to Walford after her fiancé Zack Hudson cheated on her with best friend Lauren Branning.\n\nFollowing the betrayal, Whitney decided to leave the Square for a new life in Wakefield with Britney and baby Dolly.\n\nWhitney told Britney that she had spoken to her brother Ryan, who said they could stay with him in Wakefield while they find somewhere more permanent to live.\n\nBianca offered to go with them to ease Whitney's worries and she then had to tell Zack that she was moving away for good.\n\nZack begged her not to go and even suggested that he go with them, but when Whitney told him that Bianca was leaving too, Zack revealed that she also knew that he and Lauren slept together and didn’t tell Whitney.\n\nA devastated Whitney stopped Bianca from coming with her to Wakefield and told Lauren that their friendship was over.\n\nAfter a sad goodbye with Zack at Peach's memorial tree, the Walford residents put together a slideshow of photos for Whitney at the Vic and she said goodbye to her family and friends.\n\nWhitney chose to get the bus instead of a taxi to the station and as she walked through the market to the bus stop, the stall owners gave her a round of applause.\n\nAfter saying her final goodbyes, Whitney, Britney and Dolly got on the bus, while Bianca, Zack and Lauren watched from the street with a solemn look.\n\n\"Are we going to be alright?\" Britney asked Whitney on the bus.\n\n\"We’ll figure something out. We always do,\" Whitney replied.\n\nBritney Wainwright\n\nWhitney's adopted daughter Britney Wainwright left Walford with Whitney and her new-born step sister Dolly.\n\nPregnant Whitney had been introducing troubled Britney as her foster daughter, but it transpired that she was not legally fostering the child as Lauren discovered that Whitney had paid Britney's mum £2,000 to take her daughter off her.\n\nZack was reluctant to take her on as he thought she was prioritising Britney's needs over their unborn baby's. The couple later got into a huge bust up when she lied about not legally fostering Britney and Zack committed the ultimate betrayal by sleeping with Lauren.\n\nBritney exposed Zack's affair at Whitney's wedding after overhearing them at the hospital during Dolly's birth and encouraged her not to forgive Zack for his actions.\n\nIn the end, Britney went with Whitney to start afresh in Wakefield.\n\nNadine Keller\n\nEscort Nadine stunned Jay when she returned to Walford and announced she was pregnant with his baby, but was secretly faking the pregnancy to con him for money.\n\nJay's adopted daughter Lexi Pearce was convinced Nadine was up to no good and enlisted the help of her great-great-grandfather, Stevie Mitchell.\n\nAfter giving Stevie hush money to stop him from exposing her fake baby lie, he went against her wishes and outed her in front of the family in the Vic.\n\nHe announced that Nadine offered him money to keep her baby lie a secret and poked her baby bump with his walking stick.\n\nAs the family watched on in horror, Stevie then lifted up her top to reveal the fake baby bump and a furious Jay snatched it from her.\n\nNadine apologised for taking advantage of Jay and told him that she was being blackmailed. She begged for forgiveness and Jay even threatened to call the police on her for fraud. Sick of her sob story, Jay banished her from his life and said she could keep the money he gave her.\n\nA guilt-ridden Nadine left Walford once again in the back of cab, asking Stevie to make sure someone looks after Jay.\n\nJade Masood\n\nJade Masood (Elizabeth Green) came back to stay with her dad Dean Wicks in January after having a lung transplant. Following the surgery, Jade was having problems with her mum Shabnam Masood (Rakhee Thakrar), so returned to the Square to spend some time with Dean.\n\nBut when cystic fibrosis sufferer Jade told Dean that she was moving to Pakistan with her mum, Dean conjured up a truly sick plan to keep her in the country.\n\nWhen Jade contracted a chest infection, Dean started opening Jade's pill capsules and emptying the contents down the sink. He continued to cruelly tamper with Jade's antibiotics, wanting to keep her ill to stop her from going to live in Pakistan and stay with him.\n\nDean is currently in prison after being framed for Keanu Taylor's murder by The Six and also for neglecting Jade.\n\nJade departed the Square after seeing her dad's true colours when she went to visit him in prison along with Jean Slater where Dean vehemently protested his innocence for tampering with her medication and murdering Keanu.\n\nJean was concerned that Jade could start believing his lies, but Jade was one step ahead and used another tactic to get the truth from Dean. He started to slip up and admitted that he messed with her medication, leaving her devastated.\n\nJade disowned her dad and told him exactly what she thought of him. Later on, she said goodbye to her friends in the Square and left to meet Shabnam in Pakistan.\n\nEddie Knight\n\nGeorge's adoptive father Eddie Knight (Christopher Fairbank) was sent to prison for the racially aggravated murder of George's biological father, Henry Kofi Asare.\n\nEddie committed the heinous crime after his wife Gloria didn't want to let go of George when Henry wanted to take him back and begged Eddie to do whatever it took to keep George.\n\nAfter his sentencing, Eddie banned George from Gloria's funeral and held the send-off without telling him.\n\nGloria Knight\n\nGloria Knight (Elizabeth Counsell) passed away in emotional scenes with her adopted son George Knight by her side after suffering a heart attack in court.\n\nHer husband Eddie (Christopher Fairbank) had been standing trial for the racially aggravated murder of George's biological father, Henry Kofi Asare and was sentenced to prison shortly before she died.\n\nGeorge shared some moving final moments with Gloria in the hospital and forgave her for everything.\n\nBen Mitchell\n\nMax Bowden left his role as Ben Mitchell after five years in March 2024.\n\nMax has played Ben, who is the son of Walford hardman Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), since 2019 and was named soap superstar of 2023 at the Inside Soap Awards.\n\nBen's exit storyline was set in motion when he was arrested for a previous crime in America during husband Callum Highway's (Tony Clay) surprise birthday party at the Vic.\n\nAlthough he protested his innocence, Ben was accused of committing credit card fraud while he was in the US getting treatment options for terminally ill Lola Pearce-Brown (Danielle Harold).\n\nEven though the evidence was stacked against him, Ben was hoping for bail and conspired with his dad Phil to help him flee the country with his daughter Lexi Pearce (Isabella Brown), but his plan was exposed by the family.\n\nBen was denied bail and Callum was furious that he had lied to him about being innocent of the crime. Callum refused to see his husband and took some persuading from Phil to pay him a visit.\n\nCallum managed to pull strings and visit Ben in his cell after Phil's encouragement. An emotional Bens vowed to fight his case and said it was unfair as he was trying to save Lola.\n\nAfter a heated exchange and a heart-to-heart, Callum encouraged Ben to plead guilty and vowed to never leave him, refusing to let Ben push him away.\n\nHe promised to be there when Ben comes home and in a touching moment, he reiterated his love for Ben by using British Sign Language (BSL).\n\n\"Callum Highway-Mitchell...I love you too,\" Ben said as Callum kissed his fingers and put them on Ben's lips. A devastated Callum then left as Ben cried alone in his cell.\n\nTroubled Ben has faced a number of devastating mental health battles throughout his time on the Square. He was sexually assaulted, suffered an overdose, was the victim of a homophobic attack and has recently been struggling with bulimia following the death of Lola Pearce-Brown.\n\nLucas Johnson\n\nDon Gilet returned as Lucas Johnson for a brief stint on the soap after his spiralling ex-wife Denise Fox visited him in prison seeking forgiveness for her involvement in the murder of Keanu Taylor.\n\nKaren Taylor\n\nKaren Taylor (Lorraine Stanley) made a dramatic return to Walford just weeks after her explosive exit last year, determined to find out what happened to her son Keanu Taylor on Christmas Day.\n\nKeanu was murdered on Christmas Day 2023 after Linda Carter stabbed him to death to stop him from killing her best friend Sharon Watts.\n\nThe Six conspired to hide Keanu's body in the burned-out café and blamed him for Nish Panesar's attack, claiming that he did a runner after holding them hostage.\n\nKaren was on the warpath to get answers about her son's disappearance and in a bid to stop Karen's trouble-making, she persuaded Phil Mitchell to take back The Arches from Sharon to settle Karen's debt and get her out of Walford for good.\n\nBut just as she agreed to leave again, she overheard Kathy and Stacey Slater talking and knew they were hiding something.\n\nShe then confronted The Six one by one, before coming to the conclusion that Sharon and Phil were responsible for Keanu's disappearance.\n\nAfter giving everyone both barrels, Karen told daughter Bernie Taylor (Clair Norris) that she knew Phil and Sharon had done something to Keanu. But Bernie insisted that Keanu would be fine, and insisted she stop chasing after him after everything he had done.\n\nBernie encouraged her mum to go back to Spain and Karen bid an emotional farewell, giving her some money before leaving in a taxi. Karen has since been back for Keanu's funeral, but decided not to stick around in Walford.\n\nSam Mitchell\n\nAfter making a dramatic return three months ago following her run-in with drug dealer Camillo in Spain, Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) made an explosive exit from the Square once again.\n\nPhil Mitchell and his sister Sam were at odds after she threatened to tell his wife Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) all about his affair with Emma Harding (Patsy Kensit) if he didn't hand over the £33,000 she inherited from Aunt Sal (Anna Karen).\n\nPhil eventually handed over the cash on the condition that she left the Square. However, when Phil harshly insulted her, she finally had enough of her brother's bullying and decided to exact her revenge anyway.\n\nSam got up on stage at Phil and Kat's joint karaoke birthday party to announce in front of everyone that Phil slept with Lola's mum Emma.\n\nThis was enough for the whole of Walford to turn their backs on her, so she left after giving her son Ricky Jr (Frankie Day) some money from Peggy's and told Zack Hudson (James Farrar) that she would be going to Canada.\n\nCould Sam make another troublesome return at some point?\n\nWho is returning to EastEnders in 2024?\n\nWhile we say goodbye to some beloved residents, we'll also be welcoming back some of our favourite EastEnders characters...\n\nChrissie Watts\n\nFans' pleas have been answered and Tracy Ann Oberman will make her long-awaited Walford comeback as the legendary Chrissie Watts this autumn.\n\nChrissie has always been a huge favourite with EastEnders fans and it has been almost 20 years since she was on our screens, with her last appearance airing on December 9, 2005, when she was sent to prison for Den Watts’ murder.\n\nLong-time viewers will remember that Chrissie, Sam Mitchell and Zoe Slater famously buried Den's body under the floor of the barrel store in the Vic, where he stayed for months while Chrissie acted like nothing had happened to Den's daughter Sharon Watts and his son Dennis Rickman.\n\nAlthough Chrissie only lived in Walford for just over a year-and-a-half during her last stint, she managed to find the time to make a whole host of enemies including Kat Slater and Sharon Watts, who both still live in Walford.\n\nSo what will they make of seeing her back on their turf?\n\nShirley Carter\n\nWhen is Shirley coming back to EastEnders?\n\nShirley Carter (Linda Henry) temporarily left Walford after her son Mick's devastating Christmas exit.\n\nHeartbroken Shirley was grieving the presumed death of Mick and bid an emotional farewell to her best friend Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) as she told her that the Square no longer felt like her home.\n\nShirley then closed the pub and left with bulldog Lady Di to stay with her daughter Carly Wicks (Kellie Shirley) as she needed to get away from Walford.\n\nA lot has gone on since Shirley's departure, including the arrival of the Knight family and her rapist son Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo) also returned to the Square after seven years.\n\nUpon his return, Dean issued a worrying update about Shirley and claimed that she had a mental breakdown following Mick's death and is currently in a psychiatric hospital, unable to speak.\n\nDean then went on to reveal that the breakdown supposedly caused Carly to cut Shirley off again.\n\nGiven the twisted villain's lying past, it's possible that he may be lying about Shirley's current situation.\n\nIt has not yet been confirmed when Shirley will be returning to the soap, but we'll potentially see her back at the Vic this year.\n\nEastEnders executive producer Chris Clenshaw teased to Radio Times that Shirley will be back in the future, but didn't say when: \"So, Linda Henry is currently taking a break from the show.\n\n\"But you know, when she walked off with Lady Di last year, in the wake of Mick’s disappearance, it won't have been the last you see of her. I can say that for sure.\"\n\nWho returned to EastEnders in 2024?\n\nSome familiar faces finally made their long-awaited comeback to EastEnders...\n\nJane Beale\n\nJane's return to EastEnders was a well-kept secret, and fans are thrilled to have her back on their screens. And with Jane's return came the confrontation we've all been waiting for as Cindy Beale came face to face with Jane - the woman who covered up her daughter's murder.\n\nAfter years of waiting for viewers, Laurie Brett says she was nervous ahead of her short stint back in Walford: \"I was quite nervous on the first day, thinking, ‘Gosh, do I remember how to be Jane?’ But even though I was nervous, I’d had quite a lot of time to think about it, having had the scripts for a while, so it was just about getting back into the swing of it.\n\n\"When I walked on set and saw Adam (Woodyatt) and Michelle (Collins), and also our director Karl Neilson, who directed the live episode in 2015, plus loads of the crew that I knew, all my worries melted away. There were so many familiar faces who were so welcoming. So, about half an hour in, it was like I’d never been away.\"\n\nMo Harris\n\nEastEnders legend Mo Harris (Laila Morse) returned to Walford with her great-grandson Freddie Slater.\n\nBut while the exact circumstances relating to their comeback are currently under wraps, one thing is for sure trouble will inevitably follow — especially with Mo around!\n\nBefore they arrived on screen, an exclusive first look at Mo and Freddie’s decision to return home premiered on the EastEnders TikTok channel in a limited series, following both characters in Mo’s caravan where she had been living ever since leaving Walford.\n\nMo left the Square in 2021 to go on a cruise with on/off love interest turned fiancé, Fat Elvis and her latest guest appearance in 2022 saw her and Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) living in a caravan together during Jean's mental health battle, as well as attending Kat and Phil Mitchell's (Steve McFadden) failed first wedding.\n\nLaila Morse said on returning to EastEnders: “I’m delighted to be coming home to Walford to bring Mo back to life. EastEnders holds such a special place in my heart, and I can’t wait to be reunited with my on screen family, who are like my family, as well as old and new faces.”\n\nExecutive Producer Chris Clenshaw added: “We are absolutely delighted to welcome back Laila Morse to the role of Mo Harris. Although her time away from the Square has been short-lived, the Slater family has endured a huge amount of drama since she last appeared on screen and Mo’s return will be no different. We’re delighted to welcome Laila back permanently as she is thrust into the heart of the drama alongside great-grandson Freddie.”\n\nFreddie Slater\n\nBobby Brazier has become a huge fan-favourite playing teen Freddie Slater, who is the son of Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth).\n\nThe 20-year-old went on a break from EastEnders as he took time out of his busy filming schedule to compete in Strictly Come Dancing 2023 and reached the final.\n\nNow, he's returned with his great-grandmother Mo Harris and their return was certainly a dramatic one as Alfie Moon attacked them with a toy baseball bat thinking they were burglars!\n\nBobby's EastEnders exit storyline saw his character Freddie attack stalker Theo Hawthorne (William Ellis) in a fit of rage after he walked in on the twisted teacher trying to rape his cousin Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner).\n\nFollowing the attack, Eve Unwin (Heather Peace) walked in on the crime scene and attempted to make it look like Freddie acted in self defence by planting a wrench in Theo's hand as he lay unconscious on the floor.\n\nHowever, Freddie was arrested by the police for attempted murder and was taken away in a police car.\n\nTo the relief of the Slaters, Freddie was released on bail and his final scene saw him drive off in the back of a taxi to go and stay with his mum.\n\nKim Fox and Howie Danes\n\nBeloved couple Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) and Howie Danes (Delroy Atkinson) left the Square after they were both offered jobs on a cruise for three months.\n\nHowie landed a job as an entertainment manager on the cruise, meanwhile Kim was offered the role of social media manager.\n\nTheir departures were only temporary though and both characters are now back on the Square, having returned to find Denzel causing all sorts of trouble by throwing parties and spending all hours in the gym.\n\nMartin Fowler\n\nAfter Martin Fowler (James Bye) learned that his sister Michelle Fowler (Jenna Russell) was having an operation, he decided to fly to Australia to join her and Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) so he could support them in the aftermath of Michelle's surgery.\n\nIn real life, James was taking a break from the soap to star as the Prince in the pantomime Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs at Aylesbury Waterside Theatre but he is now back and supporting his best friend Zack through his break up with Whitney.\n\nNadine Keller\n\nNadine Keller (Jazzy Phoenix) returned to EastEnders and dropped a baby bombshell on Jay Brown.\n\nNadine was an escort Jay connected with due to her striking resemblance to his late wife Lola Pearce-Brown.\n\nJay was consumed by grief when his wife Lola passed away from a terminal brain tumour and found solace in Lola lookalike Nadine. He paid her to spend the night sleeping with him, but when he started buying drugs off her, he suffered an overdose and got into a car accident.\n\nWanting to get his life back on track, he cut her off, but Jay was floored when she came back to tell him that she was pregnant with his baby.\n\nViewers now know that Nadine’s pregnancy is all a sham, and Lexi Pearce is also convinced Nadine is up to no good.\n\nThe youngster knows she can’t prove her theories alone, so decides to enlist the help of her great-great-grandfather, Stevie to expose Nadine's baby lie.\n\nJohnny Carter\n\nJohnny Carter returned to the Square after five years, after being recast for the third time with Charlie Suff taking over the role from Ted Reilly.\n\nPrior to this, Johnny was played by Sam Strike when the character first arrived in 2013 alongside his mum, Linda Carter and dad, Mick Carter.\n\nJohnny was last seen in Walford in 2018 after getting a training contract to become a solicitor in Manchester.\n\nThe solicitor returned from Manchester, only to find a dishevelled Linda in a heap on the floor drunk.\n\nLinda has been spiralling ever since she murdered Keanu Taylor on Christmas Day to stop him from killing her best friend Sharon.\n\nJohnny was horrifed when his grandmother Elaine Peacock told him that Linda's rapist Dean Wicks was back in Walford and had been terrorising his mum ever since.\n\nA furious Johnny stormed over to confront Dean and punched him in a fit of rage and has now made it his mission to get rid of Dean for good, all while taking care of his poorly mum.\n\nCharlie, who has trained at the Bristol Old Vic and has worked on stage and in short films, said of joining EastEnders: “I’m so delighted to be joining such an iconic programme - EastEnders was always on at my house when I was growing up. Johnny is a complex character who has been through so much, which I can’t wait to explore.\n\n“I’ve found EastEnders to be the most kind and loving space to work in, and I already feel like one of the family.”\n\nEastEnders boss Chris Clenshaw said: “I’m delighted to welcome Charlie Suff to the role of Johnny Carter. Although we haven’t seen Johnny on the Square in almost five years, his character remains linked to the show and its most iconic venue, The Queen Vic.\n\n“Since his short time away, the Carter family dynamics have changed significantly, and it’s safe to say that Johnny will be returning to a very different Walford than the one he left.”\n\nLucas Johnson\n\nWho plays Lucas in EastEnders?\n\nInfamous EastEnders villain Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet) made a shock return to the soap after three years when his ex-wife Denise Fox (Diane Parish) paid him an unexpected visit in prison.\n\nDenise has been spiralling following the murder of Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters) on Christmas Day.\n\nEver since she dropped her 'D' necklace in Keanu's grave underneath the floor of the café, Denise has been losing her grip on reality more and more each day.\n\nSoon enough, her inner turmoil became too much to deal with and she went to Yolande Trueman's (Angela Wynter) church group at the community centre for guidance.\n\nWhile there, Pastor Clayton suggested that she unburden herself by confiding in God and encouraged her to seek advice from someone who had been in her position.\n\nListening to his words of wisdom, Denise decided to visit a familiar face in prison — her evil ex-husband Lucas.\n\nJade Masood\n\nDean Wicks' daughter Jade Masood (Elizabeth Green) originally returned in 2023, but left Walford after finding out that her dad raped Linda.\n\nHowever, she came back to stay with Dean in January after having a lung transplant and was having problems with her mum Shabnam Masood.\n\nJade bonded with Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) as Dean began messing with her medication to keep her ill and stop her from leaving him.\n\nLauren Branning\n\nEastEnders icon Jacqueline Jossa made an explosive return to Walford on New Year's Day as Lauren Branning.\n\nLauren was at a New Year party in Paris with her son Louie and cousin Penny Branning. Back in the Square, Peter texted Lauren \"Happy New Year\" while he admitted to mum Cindy he was really missing them.\n\nShe confessed to Penny that Louie was really missing his dad Peter and later called him up and said she was thinking of coming home for a few days to see her uncle Jack and Whitney.\n\nAfter a suspicious conversation with a French woman called Juliette, Penny asked Lauren if she could join her on the flight.\n\nAt the airport, a police dog approached Lauren and started sniffing her bag. Having nothing to hide, Lauren agreed to have her bag searched, but the officer pulled out drugs and arrested her.\n\nMeanwhile, a guilty looking Penny looked on as Lauren protested her innocence and denied having anything to do with it.\n\nLauren was last seen on screen in June when she travelled to France to visit her ex-boyfriend Peter Beale (Thomas Law) with their son Louie. However, it all came crashing down when she discovered that Peter's mum, Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins) was actually alive after 25 years.\n\nPrior to this, she made a brief return to Walford last December for the funeral of Dot Cotton (June Brown).\n\nWith Cindy back from the dead, deep wounds to mend with Peter, and a sister living in the Vic who she isn’t aware of yet, Lauren’s return is sure to stir up trouble as she is thrown into the heart of the drama.\n\nOn reprising the role, Jacqueline Jossa said: “I’m really excited! It’s such an amazing time to be back as there is so much buzz around EastEnders at the moment, and I’ve been watching and loving it like a fan.

My whole family are EastEnders fans, and I remember sitting on my Nanny Kay’s lap to tune in, and now they get to watch me in Albert Square.\n\n\"The inclusion of disabled talent on screen is so important to me as a wheelchair user, so I’m thrilled to be playing a character as feisty and cool as Penny. She’s thrown into the middle of the drama straight away, and I can’t wait to see what she gets up to.”\n\nWho joined EastEnders in 2024?\n\nWe have introduced some new characters who now call Walford home...\n\nNew Mitchells - Teddy, Harry and Barney\n\nBilly's world was turned upside down when he discovered that his dad, Stevie, had been hiding a secret family.

I grew up watching the show and many of the characters have been part of my life for as long as I can remember, so walking onto the Square for the first time was the most surreal experience of my career! It’s a privilege to work with Colin Salmon, who I’ve watched with admiration for many years, and Francesca Henry and Molly Rainford, who are dynamite on screen, as well as the amazing Harriet Thorpe and Kellie Bright. Junior is an exciting character to play as he’s a complex man, and he’s going to cause a bit of a stir!”\n\nBritney Wainwright\n\nChild actress Lola Campbell, who shot to fame after her role in the BAFTA-nominated film Scrapper, joined the cast as troubled young girl Britney who Whitney became determined to help.\n\nAfter growing concerned for the wellbeing of a child on Bianca’s estate, Whitney quickly found herself at the centre of drama after she learned that Britney had not attended school since 2020, meaning she was now considered a \"Ghost Child\" by her absence from the education system.\n\nThe special flashback episodes revisited five weeks' worth of storylines as we followed Whitney in her attempt to intervene in Britney’s turbulent situation, but it wasn't long before things took a turn for the worst after a confrontation with Britney’s mother caused the neglected young girl to flee and Whitney was hit by a car.\n\nPregnant Whitney had been introducing Britney as her foster daughter, but it transpired that she was not legally fostering the child as Lauren Branning discovered that Whitney had paid Britney's mum £2,000 to take her daughter off her.\n\nSpeaking on the storyline, Chris Clenshaw, Executive Producer said: “We’re thrilled to welcome the immensely talented Lola Campbell to the cast of EastEnders as she takes on the role of Britney.\n\n\"The special episodes, which coincide with Patsy Palmer’s return, will showcase five weeks’ worth of storyline as we follow Whitney and Zack during their time in Milton Keynes, but it’s not long before the pair are thrust into the heart of the drama after Whitney grows concerned for Britney’s wellbeing.”\n\nStevie Mitchell\n\nStevie Mitchell arrived at Aunt Sal's funeral — and he was met with a rather bitter welcome.\n\nLegendary actor Alan Ford made his debut as Steve Mitchell, Billy Mitchell's (Perry Fenwick) estranged dad.\n\nBilly grew up in care from the age of ten after Stevie took sole custody of his brother Charlie and the pair last saw each other off-screen over twenty five years ago.\n\nStevie arrived in Walford as the Mitchells said goodbye to their beloved Aunt Sal, but it soon became clear that his attendance was not welcome.\n\nAlan has an impressive career spanning over five decades, and is known for his iconic roles in blockbuster gangster movies Snatch, Riot Club and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels to name just a few.\n\nAlan said of joining EastEnders: “I feel highly delighted to be playing a character close to my own age in this extremely popular television drama series.”\n\nChris Clenshaw, Executive Producer added: “It’s an honour to welcome the immensely talented Alan Ford to the cast of EastEnders as he takes on the role of Stevie Mitchell.\n\n\"Whilst Billy has been a stalwart in the show for over 25 years, viewers know very little about his complicated childhood and the events that led him to grow up in care. Alan arrives in Walford as the Mitchell family prepare to say goodbye to their beloved Aunt Sal but it soon becomes apparent that he is not welcome in the family fold.”\n\nEddie and Gloria Knight\n\nThe New Year was a family affair for George Knight as he was unexpectedly reunited with his adoptive parents, Gloria and Eddie Knight.\n\nHaving not seen George for over ten years, the couple arrived in Walford in an attempt to reconcile with their son but it soon became clear that both were hiding a secret.\n\nTheir arrival kicked off a major new storyline for George, who was told that he was adopted by a process known as farming, where children were advertised for money for prospective parents wanting to look after them.\n\nThis life-changing news forced George to question everything he knew about his heritage and upbringing.\n\nElizabeth Counsell took on the role of Gloria Knight. With an impressive career spanning 55 years across television, film and theatre, Elizabeth has acted in a number of roles including Call the Midwife, Doctors and The Split, but she is best known for starring in Brush Strokes.\n\nChristopher Fairbank stars as Eddie Knight, who has had an incredible range of roles on both the big and small screen, having recently appeared in The Little Mermaid, Guardians of the Galaxy and Andor.\n\nSpeaking on the new additions, Chris Clenshaw, Executive Producer said: “We’re absolutely delighted to welcome the legendary and immensely talented actors, Christopher and Elizabeth, to the EastEnders family as they bring to life the characters of Gloria and Eddie. Although currently set to join for a short stint, Gloria and Eddie are thrust into the heart of the drama as they try to reconnect with their son but it soon becomes apparent why George has kept his distance.”\n\nElizabeth said of joining the show: “I can honestly say it has been an absolute joy. The cast and all of the team behind the scenes at EastEnders are brilliant and have been so welcoming. Colin and I actually worked together before, and who would have thought that I’d be playing his mum almost thirty years later!”\n\nChristopher added: “I can’t tell you how thrilled I am to join the cast of EastEnders. Everyone has been so welcoming, and it’s been fantastic to meet and work with the brilliant actors involved in the show.”\n\nWho left EastEnders in 2023?\n\nIn 2023, we faced the devastating death of fan-favourite Lola Pearce-Brown who tragically lost her life to a terminal brain tumour.\n\nMeanwhile, after a dramatic time on the Square, Ricky Butcher and Scarlett Butcher (Tabitha Byron) left to start a new life in Germany.

There is absolutely no truth in any claims of a feud with bosses and the show fully support Brian in his decision to leave which was made some time ago.
