EastEnders' Bianca and Sonia get bad news

EastEnders' Bianca Jackson and Sonia Fowler will get upsetting news in scenes airing next week.

The soap sisters - both daughters of Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson), who has been at the centre of a gripping breast cancer storyline recently - are set to receive the results of the tests they took to find out whether they have the BRCA2 cancer gene next week, and it will be bad news for one of them.

Bianca (Patsy Palmer) and Sonia (Natalie Cassidy) both decided to take the test after their mother was diagnosed with the gene, and although bosses of the BBC One soap are keeping the identity of the unfortunate sibling a secret, one of them will definitely be faced with some difficult decisions.

A show insider told the Daily Star newspaper: "For Carol, it's a nightmare come true.

"She can handle the cancer but she's devastated that one of her daughters is going to go through hell."

The devastating news will reportedly put even more strain on the family - which includes Carol's partner and Bianca's dad David Wicks (Michael French) and Bianca's adoptive daughter Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) - who have been supporting Carol during her battle with cancer.
