        "text": "Editor’s picks\n\nIn other words, Cleveland could not stymie the Warriors the same way Oklahoma City did, by intimidating the Warriors with their size and speed and length, by clogging the passing lane, by playing the kind of first-rate defense that nearly vanquished Golden State in the first place. And maybe the Cavs are still capable of making this a series; they didn’t shoot well last night, and they still have the most intimidating force in the basketball universe on their side in LeBron James.\n\nThis is why the Cavaliers are still capable of stealing Game 2 and altering the tenor of this series the way Oklahoma City did, but Thursday night made you wonder if maybe the moment has passed, if maybe the idea that the Warriors could somehow be vanquished in the midst of this batshit-crazy season ended after three remarkable victories in the Western Conference Finals. You don’t get many nights like this, nights where both Steph and Klay are non-factors, and when you do, you have to jump on them and go for the throat. It’s far from over, but if the Cavs couldn’t find a way to at least take it to the wire on a night as strange as this one, you have to wonder what they might do on an otherwise normal evening.\n\nMichael Weinreb is the author of Season of Saturdays: A History of College Football in 14 Games, now out in paperback. You can find him on Twitter @michaelweinreb\n\nWatch the Warriors’ Stephen Curry and the Cavaliers’ Lebron James discuss Game 1."
