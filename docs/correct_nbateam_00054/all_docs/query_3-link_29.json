        "text": "As Leandro Barbosa prepares to become part of the Warriors‘ coaching staff, one of his former Golden State teammates is set to join the team’s front office. Shaun Livingston has finalized a deal with the Warriors and is being hired as a director of players affairs and engagement, reports Marcus Thompson II of The Athletic.\n\nLivingston, 35, announced his retirement from the NBA almost exactly a year ago after spending the final five seasons of his career with the Warriors. The longtime point guard, who was the fourth overall pick in the 2004 draft, also spent time with the Clippers and seven other clubs before arriving in Golden State and winning three titles with the Dubs.\n\nReports last year indicated that the Warriors would likely offer Livingston a role in the organization following his retirement. Thompson suggests that most people expected the Illinois native to try coaching, and members of Golden State’s front office even encouraged it.\n\nHowever, Livingston revealed in a conversation with president of basketball operations Bob Myers that he preferred a front office role, according to Thompson, who says Myers was “elated” by that development and attempted to recruit the ex-Warriors back to the organization.\n\n“I always knew that door was open,” Livingston said of rejoining his old team in a new role. “I just had to walk through it.”\n\nWhile Livingston won’t be the near the top of the Warriors’ front office hierarchy to start, he won’t exactly be coming in at the ground level either, according to Thompson, who says the former guard will report directly to Myers and executive VP of basketball operations Kirk Lacob and figures to have “some assistant GM-type clout.” Thompson writes that the goal is to groom Livingston as a future general manager, either in Golden State or elsewhere.\n\nPhoto courtesy of USA Today Sports Images."
