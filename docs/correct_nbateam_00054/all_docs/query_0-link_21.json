        "text": "The Cleveland Cavaliers made a roster move on Christmas Day. Because the Washington Wizards waived Shaun Livingston on December 23rd, the Cavs had until 5 PM on the 25th to claim the 27 year old veteran point guard. To make room for the move, the Cavs waived Donald Sloan.\n\nSloan had been getting inconsistent minutes from Byron Scott and had several DNP-CD's in recent days. That's a tough way to spend your Christmas, but that's the business of the NBA. I assume Sloan will be signed by the Canton Charge if he isn't claimed by another NBA team.\n\nLivingston is a good pick up in my opinion. He's a veteran -- something the Cavaliers sorely lack. He's also much bigger at 6-7, than Jeremy Pargo or Donald Sloan. He's fought back to be in the NBA after that devastating knee injury (which I still have never seen because I'm afraid I will puke) and could be a nice pick up. Things didn't work out for him in Washington, but hopefully he sticks in Cleveland."
