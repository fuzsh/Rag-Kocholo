        "text": "No NBA team has been as dominant throughout the past decade as the Golden State Warriors.\n\nThe team has won four titles in the past 10 seasons, including three in a span of four years from 2014-18. But one team that pushed Golden State to its limits was the 2015-16 OKC Thunder, which was led by Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook.\n\nIn a recent interview on the Point Forward podcast, former Golden State guard Shaun Livingston spoke about his team's matchup with OKC in the 2016 Western Conference Finals. The Warriors trailed 3-1 in the series before winning three straight games to advance.\n\n“Man, OKC, that might have been one of our hardest series (matchups),” Livingston said. “Them boys had our number. They were switchable, long, athletic. That, team to me, was one of our biggest threats.\"\n\nGolden State went 73-9 that regular season, which still stands as the best record in NBA history.\n\nAnd even though the Warriors ultimately lost 4-3 to the Cleveland Cavaliers in that year's NBA Finals, Livingston still views the Thunder as one of the most formidable foes.\n\n\"Cleveland, it was fun just because they hated us,\" Livingston said. \"I enjoyed all those series, But I think OKC was one of our hardest matchups. That's probably what I'd throw out there.\"\n\nDurant infamously joined Golden State the following offseason.\n\nOKC has not made it past the first round of the playoffs since then, but that drought could end this season. The Thunder (45-20) is tied for the top spot in the Western Conference standings."
