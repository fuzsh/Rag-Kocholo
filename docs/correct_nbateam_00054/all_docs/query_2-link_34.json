        "text": "Shaun Livingston Biography\n\nPerseverance is a word that most accurately describes three-time NBA champion point guard Shaun Livingston. Livingston was the fourth overall pick of the Los Angeles Clippers in the 2004 NBA Draft. Coming straight out of high school, many thought he was destined for superstardom, but injuries derailed several seasons early in his career. Despite the obstacles, Livingston turned around his fortunes to have a productive and lengthy pro career. In 2015, he won his first championship as a reserve with the Golden State Warriors. Livingston played 17.9 minutes a game during the 21 game postseason run. He went on to win two more championships before retiring as a Warrior in 2019. Livingston had the unique distinction of jumping straight to the NBA from Peoria Central High School in Illinois. There, Livingston was a McDonald’s All-American, Illinois Mr. Basketball, and a two-time state champion.\n\nBook Shaun Livingston for your Next Event\n\nDisclaimer: AthleteSpeakers assists companies seeking to hire talent like Shaun Livingston for speaking engagements, virtual meetings, appearances, product endorsements, and business sanctions.
