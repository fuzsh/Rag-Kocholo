        "text": "NEW YORK – Shaun Livingston overcame a career-threatening knee injury, played for nine different teams with varying locker room dynamics, and persevered to become a three-time champion. He’s able to shed light on the Warriors’ star-studded locker room, Steve Kerr’s job managing All-Star personalities and DeMarcus Cousins’ road to recovery.\n\nLivingston sat down with The Athletic during his basketball camp at Basketball City and disputed the notion that the Warriors ruined basketball with Cousins – a four-time All-Star – aboard.\n\n“I mean, you look at what we were able to do, what the team was able to do and grow,” Livingston said Thursday. “(Six) picks before Steph (Curry), 10 picks before Klay (Thompson), a whole round before Draymond (Green). You know? So, I think when you talk about ruining basketball you talk about Kevin (Durant) making his decision, and people point to that because of the team we had and what we were able to build.\n\n“But that’s his decision. That’s his decision, right? As a player, as a person, he’s earned that right he’s earned that decision. And also, you look at what happened with DeMar DeRozan, with Isaiah Thomas, you know what I mean? That’s what’s been happening for the past however many years that the Association has been here, and it will continue to happen because this is the game that we play, these are the rules that are dealt. Teams are going to make the best decision in their interest, and players should do the same, and I think that’s what Kevin felt like he did.”\n\nCousins, who suffered a torn left Achilles in late January, joined the Warriors by signing a one-year, $5.3 million deal. Before his injury, Cousins was expected to command a potential maximum annual salary on a long-term deal from the New Orleans Pelicans. Instead, the Pelicans eventually landed a playoff spot and swept the Portland Trail Blazers without Cousins before losing to the Warriors in five games. Arguably the most talented center in the game has yet to appear in a playoff game, and that will now change with the Warriors if he returns healthy.\n\n“It’s an amazing move from management, and on his part, I think it’s a win-win too,” Livingston said. “He gets the chance to rehab, sit out, and then a chance to showcase himself. I think it’s an incredible opportunity for both of us.”\n\nThe Warriors will become the first team in more than 40 years to feature five All-Stars from the prior season. Cousins will have an opportunity to become a champion and add that legacy to his resume along with his gold medal during the 2016 Olympics.\n\nTo help manage the egos of five All-Star caliber players, the Warriors signed Kerr to a contract extension. Maybe Kerr should thank Livingston partly for his raise after his comment to The Undefeated following the sweep of the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals.\n\n“Shout out to Steve Kerr for dealing with all our B.S. this year,” Livingston said.\n\n“As far as the comment, it was more about getting us motivated for the whole season because that was the roughest season that we had just being able to get motivated to play,” Livingston explained on Thursday. “More of our mentality to approach each game like it was our last. We just didn’t have that mentality. We didn’t have the mentality of maybe playing hard for 100 percent of the possessions throughout the regular season. He had to do a lot of motivating.\n\n“As far as his extension, the proof is in the pudding. Three championships in four years, what he’s been able to create on the offensive level for this team, and just his relationship as far as managing personalities and managing egos. I think that’s incredibly important. You look at the greats, Phil Jackson, Gregg Popovich, managing egos, it’s more of a management position, as opposed to Xs and Os. He’s gotten everything he’s deserved, and he’s earned it.”\n\nVeteran forward David West also said, “There was a lot going on behind the scenes that people will be shocked about when it comes out.”\n\nWas there more to that statement?\n\n“That was the motivating part,” Livingston replied. “That was it. It was like, D West was just, he was just messing with the world. It was just the time. You’ve got to think, we were popping bottles, pouring champagne, and he was in there pranking like if you guys only knew and it just stirred up the pot a little bit.\n\n“But it wasn’t anything more than what the average NBA team goes through. I’ve been in more toxic situations, more flammable situations than this past year with the Warriors. Like I said, it was just as far as getting us motivated, all of us coming ready. We just didn’t have it every day.”\n\nLivingston has also played for the Clippers, Heat, Thunder, Wizards, Bobcats, Bucks, Cavaliers and Nets before joining the Warriors in the summer of 2014. Generally, a former fourth overall draft pick is a franchise cornerstone for one team, but the 6-foot-7 guard overcame a gruesome knee injury to have a 13-year career thus far. Livingston had advice for his campers to overcome their own personal obstacles.\n\n“I think the main thing is just that we’re all going to be faced with adversity,” Livingston said. “You know what I mean? I just try to tell the kids what differentiates us is how we deal with it. It’s just like, you can either quit, or you can give up, so I try to maybe put it in terms they can relate to. We all play ball, right, so if you get a bad call from a referee, are you going to stop playing? Are you going to quit on your teammates, stop being coached? Or, are you going to get back on defense and keep playing the game? You’ve got to keep playing, and those are life lessons, because then once we all get out of school and once we’re all adults, life comes at us and things happen. How are we going to deal with it? We’ve got to keep going and pick ourselves up.”\n\nLivingston, who started his camp at Basketball City when he was a member of the Nets, turned an opportunity with Brooklyn into a championship legacy with the Warriors. Before joining the Warriors, Livingston’s one-year stint in Brooklyn marked the first time he appeared in 76 games and started a career-high 54 games. Since then, Livingston has appeared in 303 games in four seasons with the Warriors after appearing in over 70 games only twice in his first nine seasons in the league.\n\n“I was able to use a platform in Brooklyn to push my career a step in the right direction and Brooklyn was that platform for me to take it up a notch in Golden State,” Livingston said. “I was very fortunate that I was able to sign with them. I’m still very fortunate to play in the organization and to play with great players, a great coach, a great coaching staff and to live in the Bay Area. I’m living the dream.”\n\nPhoto credit: Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports"
