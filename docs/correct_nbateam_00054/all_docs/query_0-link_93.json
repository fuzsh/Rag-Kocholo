        "text": "I was planning to see Leonardo DiCaprio’s new movie, \"The Revenant.\" But thanks to Shaun Livingston, I don’t have to watch that movie. Today against the Cleveland Cavaliers, he WAS the Revenant. So, what the heck is a revenant? Again, if you skipped all of your English classes in high school like I did, a revenant is a visible ghost or animated corpse that was believed to return from the grave to terrorize LeBron James and the Cavs. And if you recall, most NBA fans thought that Shaun's career was over after he suffered this major injury:\n\nSo, isn't it fitting that on this day -- Christmas day -- he was our saviour and rose from the dead to haunt the Cavs?\n\nDraymond Green and LeBron James tried their very best to downplay the importance of today’s game, but we knew better. This was THE game of the year so far. The marquee matchup in a day of 14 hours of NBA basketball. And who was the hero in today’s Warriors’ win? Dr. Livingston, I presume? That is correct. Time after time during the critical moments of today’s tight and tense game, it was Livingston who rose from the dead and made the key shots. He did this repeatedly throughout the game. Curry was great, as usual. Green was also great, as usual. But today was a day of terror for the Cavs, thanks to the Revenant. He scored 16 points in our lowest scoring game of the season, and it seems like 35 points to me. This game featured a fully healthy Cavs squad and an injured Warriors' squad -- Curry missed huge chunks of this game while nursing a nagging calf injury. But the Warriors always play fair and we leveled the playing field, and we leveled the Cavs in the process. Or, you could say that Curry injured his calf and we beat the Calfs. Either way, no one can say that we were lucky, once again. No one but Doc Rivers, of course. But I swear that man never attended medical school.\n\nBut why am I not surprised? Livingston has always been a steady and smart player. He is yet another example of the Bob Myers magic. He has an uncanny ability to sift through the rubble to find hidden gems like Livingston and Barbosa. Livingston is gifted in having such a long wing span, and he used it to his advantage all day today. His midrange jumper was pure gold today.\n\nAnd it was pure gold today for us Warriors fans. Thank you, Shaun \"The Revenant\" Livingston! Thank you for the wonderful Christmas gift and for many previous GIFS:"
