It’s certainly true that Stephen Curry, Livingston, Klay Thompson and JaVale McGee are on the lighter side. But Draymond Green and Kevin Durant are both decidedly not “light-skinned guys,” as Livingston puts it.\n\nAthletes are always coming up with interesting ways to stay motivated. And if this is what it takes for Livingston to play with an extra edge (not that he’s ever really needed it), then so be it."
