        "text": "Shaun Livingston played 18 games with the Thunder. Eight at the end of the Thunder's inaugural season, 10 at the start of the next season.\n\nWhen the Thunder traded for Eric Maynor in December 2009, Livingston was waived. It was nothing personal. Everyone -- literally, everyone -- was pulling for Livingston. One of the worst injuries in NBA history made Livingston a sympathetic figure.\n\nOn Feb. 26, 2007, Livingston drove in for a layup against the Charlotte Bobcats and landed as awkwardly as a player can land. His leg went one way, his knee another. Livingston suffered one of the most catastrophic knee injuries in sports history, derailing a promising career.\n\nBut Livingston has gone from derailed to rerailed. Tuesday night in Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals, Livingston scored 18 points, including 14 in the second quarter, as the Warriors beat the Rockets 110-106. It was a career playoff high for Livingston, who played in 12 postseason games for the Clippers in 2006 but never saw the playoffs again until last year with Brooklyn.\n\nLivingston has lived quite the nomadic life since that injury against the Bobcats. Livingston, a 6-foot-7 point guard, was the fourth overall pick in the 2004 NBA Draft, out of Peoria (Ill.) Central High School. That's right. Livingston has been around so long, he was drafted out of high school. 2004 was a long time ago. Also selected in that draft were Dwight Howard, Emeka Okafor, Ben Gordon, Devin Harris, Luol Deng, Andre Iguodala, Robert Swift, Sebastian Telfair, Al Jefferson, Kirk Snyder, Josh Smith, J.R. Smith, Delonte West and Tony Allen. Second-round picks included Andre Emmett and Royal Ivey.\n\nLivingston was part of a young Clipper core that was quite promising. Elton Brand, Sam Cassell, Chris Kaman and Corey Maggette. The long-beleaguered Clippers made the '06 playoffs and even won a series.\n\nBut Livingston suffered the knee injury, the Clippers staggered to a 40-42 record, the Clips went back to rebuilding and Livingston began trying to resurrect his career.\n\nLivingston missed the entire 2007-08 and began quite the odyssey.\n\nSince that injury, Livingston has been released five times, traded three times and not re-signed three times.\n\nHe's played for nine teams, plus the Wizards twice, and not counting Memphis and Houston, which traded for him and released him.\n\nHere is Livingston's journey:\n\nJuly 2008: Released by the Clippers\n\nOctober 2008: Signed by the Heat\n\nJanuary 2009: Traded to the Grizzlies (for a top-55 protected second-round draft pick)\n\nJanuary 2009: Released by the Grizzlies\n\nMarch 2009: Signed by the Thunder\n\nDecember 2009: Released by the Thunder\n\nFebruary 2010: Signed by the Wizards\n\nJuly 2010: Signed by the Hornets\n\nJune 2011: Traded to the Bucks\n\nJune 2012: Traded to the Rockets\n\nOctober 2012: Released by the Rockets (to make roster space for the James Harden trade)\n\nNovember 2012: Signed by the Wizards\n\nDecember 2012: Released by the Wizards\n\nDecember 2012: Signed by the Cavaliers\n\nJuly 2013: Signed by the Nets\n\nJuly 2014: Signed by the Warriors.\n\nEven in the vagabond NBA, that's quite the tour. Livingston has made 11 roster changes since the Clippers, and this season with the Warriors is the most games, 78, he's played in any of those stops.\n\nThat's what happens when an athletic point guard no longer is athletic.\n\nWhen Livingston was a Thunder, he was Russell Westbrook's backup. He averaged 17.8 minutes and 4.0 points per game. Seemed perfectly fine.\n\nBut after Livingston was released and Maynor arrived, we saw something completely different. Maynor came in and made all kinds of plays as a traditional point guard, and we suddenly realized why Livingston no longer was on the roster.\n\nBut he didn't quit. He kept working. Kept trying. And the last two seasons, Livingston has been rewarded. He was a valuable Net, making 54 starts for Brooklyn, including 10 in the playoffs.\n\nAnd this season, Livingston is the backup point guard on the wildly entertaining Warriors.\n\nLivingston isn't your typical Warrior. He's taken two 3-pointers all season. Missed them both. Livingston is a driver, but not with the explosiveness you need to dominate. And he's a passer. Livingston is third on the team in assists, and per 36 minutes, he's second, behind only Steph Curry.\n\nLivingston, who turns 30 in September, has turned himself into a valuable, functional ballplayer on a really good team. What more could he ask for, especially after the events of Feb. 26, 2007?"
