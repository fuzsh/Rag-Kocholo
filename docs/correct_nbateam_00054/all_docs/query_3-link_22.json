        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nWas uncommonly good at hitting his jumper from the mid-range and used his length to full effect. Regularly registered superb field-goal percentages and also thrived in a full-court/transition game as a distributor. Was a good defender, too, as well as a gifted passer with rare size at point guard. Very tall and long, he was a smooth athlete. Major knee injuries were a huge issue early in his career; his thin frame took a lot of punishment in the NBA paint, and he did not shoot well from beyond the arc (especially for a guard). Lacked optimum strength, as well as a great perimeter game, to complement his drives and lessen the wear and tear."
