        "text": "OAKLAND, Calif. -- Cleveland built its roster through trades and free agency with often splashy moves. Way out West, Golden State developed arguably the league's best bench with hard-nosed guys such as Shaun Livingston eager to take the pressure off starters Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green.\n\nOr downright outplay the first unit when necessary on the biggest stage.\n\nThis close-knit backups regularly discuss how dependable they must be, telling each other to stay ready for any role.\n\n\"When you see a guy down, you make sure you pick him up; and when you see a guy up make sure you keep him level-headed because you never know what's going to be next in this game,\" Marreese Speights said Friday.\n\nThe Warriors' reserves were dominant in a 104-89 Game 1 NBA Finals victory Thursday night.\n\nLivingston played nearly 27 minutes in the opener of the rematch with his former Cleveland team and made 8 of 10 shots on the way to a postseason career-best 20 points.\n\nLeandro Barbosa made all five of his shots for 11 points, and 2015 Finals MVP Andre Iguodala contributed 12 points, 7 rebounds and 6 assists.\n\n\"We're not coming in to just give guys rest. We're coming in to be productive and make plays and make things happen. It's all about the mindset,\" Livingston said. \"It feels good to come out of a game like that when our stars don't have it going and we still get the win. We believe in each other, and anybody can step up.\"\n\nNow it's back to the drawing board for LeBron James and the Cavs to figure out how to contain Golden State's bench.\n\nLivingston is the one who nine years ago nearly needed his left leg amputated after a knee injury. While playing for the Los Angeles Clippers in 2007, Livingston was going for a layup when his leg buckled backward, parallel to the court, and he fell in a freak accident. He screamed and writhed in agony.\n\nLivingston tore three major ligaments in his knee -- the anterior cruciate, posterior cruciate and medial collateral as well as his lateral meniscus, then required extensive surgery.\n\nIt was during his time with Cleveland at the end of the 2012-13 season that Livingston began to truly trust his body again. It was a long road emotionally and physically to reach that point, so much so that Livingston said it was \"almost like I was a retired player.\"\n\nLivingston, 30, put up nearly 100 free throws at the end of Friday's practice, which is somewhere around his norm.\n\n\"Shaun shoots the most. That's how he keeps his rhythm,\" Warriors Coach Steve Kerr said. \"I think part of that is his injury history. He can't afford to put a lot of wear and tear on his legs by shooting a ton of jump shots, so he shoots a ton of free throws.\"\n\nLivingston already proved his reliability this postseason when he stepped in for Curry as the MVP dealt with ankle and knee injuries that sidelined him for six games. He scored 16 points in each of his three starts in place of Curry during Golden State's 4-1 first-round series victory against the Houston Rockets.\n\n\"Shaun's a guy who has battled through much more than having to step up in a game. He's been from the top to the bottom and back,\" Green said.\n\nCleveland also fell behind 1-0 in last year's Finals after an overtime defeat in the opener, yet these record-setting Warriors believe they are better-equipped for the Finals stage the second time around.\n\nEven with the superstars out of sync (Curry and Thompson combined for 20 points on 8-for-27 shooting Thursday), Golden State took care of the ball -- committing only nine turnovers -- and played solid defense.\n\nThose are the little things Kerr has been stressing all along as what it would take to capture another championship.\n\n\"Look, our two main scorers, every now and then, very, very rarely, are going to have a game like this, but it's up to other guys to carry the load and step up and make shots,\" center Andrew Bogut said, \"and numerous different guys can do that.\"\n\nSports on 06/04/2016"
