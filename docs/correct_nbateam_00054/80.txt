Journeyman guard Shaun Livingston is set to join his seventh NBA team, as the Cleveland Cavaliers claimed him off waivers Tuesday.

The Cavaliers cleared a spot for Livingston on the roster by waiving guard Donald Sloan.

Livingston, 27, played 17 games and made four starts this season for the Washington Wizards before he was cut Sunday. He averaged 3.7 points, 2.2 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game.

A first-round pick of the Clippers in 2004, Livingston played three seasons in Los Angeles before he began bouncing around the league. He has since played for the Miami Heat, Oklahoma City Thunder, Washington, Charlotte Bobcats, Milwaukee Bucks and then the Wizards again.

His 2006-07 averages of 9.3 points and 5.1 assists per game remain his career highs.

Sloan, 24, played 20 games for Cleveland this season, averaging 4 points and 1.9 assists. Last season, he saw action for the Atlanta Hawks and New Orleans Hornets in addition to the Cavaliers.

Earlier Tuesday, the Cavaliers announced that forward/center Anderson Varejao would miss a fourth consecutive game due to a bruised right knee. Varejao won't travel with the team for Wednesday's game at Washington.
