It wasn’t long after Livingston published the post that Smith took to the comments section to quickly show his support for the man and player. Smith was one of many current and former NBA stars to celebrate Livingston’s career.

Livingston was the No. 4 overall pick in the 2004 NBA Draft. After a devastating knee injury in 2007, many wondered if Livingston would ever be able to walk again, let alone return to the NBA.

After an arduous rehabilitation, Livingston finally managed to do just that. Following his return to the court, Livingston enjoyed a career as a journeyman until he signed with the Golden State Warriors in the 2014 offseason. It was with the Warriors that he found his home and played a pivotal role in helping the Warriors win three NBA titles. He was ultimately waived by the Warriors earlier this summer.

His journey from the deepest depths of the sport to the highest of highs is a perfect encapsulation of why both players and fans love Livingston.

As for Smith, he too is currently without an NBA team. While he does not seem close to announcing his own retirement, there is little doubt that when that day does eventually come, he will be met with a similar outpouring of love and support from his colleagues.
