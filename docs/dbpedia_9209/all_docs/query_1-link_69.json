GABRISCH \\\n\nAND\n\nJ-C.VALDETTARO PONTECORVO DELLA ROCCHETTA\n\nROYAL NUMISMATIC SOCIETY SPECIAL PUBLICATION NO. 2 I LONDON 1989\n\n0N. G . Rhodes, K . Gabrisch and C . Valdettaro Pon tecorvo Della Rocchet ta Royal Numismatic Society Special Publication No. 2 1 ISBN o 901405 27 2\n\nPrinted in Great Britain by BAS Printers Limited, Over Wallop, Hampshire\n\nPREFACE It was in 1908 that E. H. C. Walsh wrote his famous article in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society entitled 'The Coinage of Nepal'. Since then a number of articles have been written on specific aspects of Nepalese coinage and certain catalogues have listed many new types, but Walsh's article remains the standard work on the subject and was honoured by being reprinted in India in 1974. His work was remarkably comprehensive, bearing in mind the material available to him and the fact that he was never able to visit Nepal. During the last eighty years, however, major advances have been made in the study of Nepalese history and a very great deal of numismatic material has come to light, so that a complete reappraisal of Nepalese coinage is long overdue. In writing this book, the authors have tried to satisfy the demands of two different types of reader. First, we hope that historians will be able to benefit from reading this book, so that they can use the numismatic evidence presented for their historical studies. Secondly, it will help the collector who is trying to identify his purchases. determine the gaps in his collection so that he knows what to look for, and enable him to understand more about his collection. The authors cannot claim to be experts in the matter of Nepalese history and have perhaps not been able to make the fullest possible use of documentary evidence. However. they have been collecting the coins of Nepal for the last twenty five years, both in Nepal itself, in the neighbouring areas of India, and in Europe, and have been able to study most of the major collections of Nepalese coins in Europe, America and Asia. They would claim, therefore, to be well qualified to write such a study, and although craving the indulgence of the historical experts, they hope that the numismatic evidence presented in this volume will shed new light on many aspects of both the economic and political history of Nepal and its neighbours. Finally, the authors would like to express their sincere thanks to their many friends and colleagues without whose help this work could never have been completed. First to B. N. Shrestha, whose knowledge of Nepalese coins is unparalleled and who has. over more than twenty years, sought out and allowed us to photograph many fine and rare pieces in his own collection and in those of his friends. Then to the many Nepalese scholars who have helped and advised us over the years, among whom P. K. Dwivedi, Dr P. R. Sharma, S. M. Joshi and Fr. L. Stiller deserve special mention. We are grateful to the keepers of the numerous public collections in Europe and America who have given us generous assistance in studying their collections, and in particular to J. Cribb and the late N . M. Lowick of the British Museum. We also thank M. Cowell and M. S. Tate of the British Museum\n\n6\n\nT H E COINAGE OF NEPAL\n\nResearch Laboratories for writing the Appendix which analyses the silver content of certain coins. We offer our thanks to fellow collectors and students who have allowed us to examine their collections and who have provided much information, especially W. Bertsch, G. Blaker, H. Bons, V. H. Hansen, Dr C.-E. von Kleist, and R. Negleman. We would like to express our gratitude to Dr N. K . Rutter for kindly editing the manuscript and for his many helpful suggestions. And a special thank you to our wives for their patience with our obsession of a lifetime, and for their loving support throughout. Postscript As the final draft of the manuscript was being completed, Carlo Valdettaro died suddenly and peacefully at his home in Lugano. He will be remembered as the father of Nepalese numismatics. In the 1g6os, when stationed in Calcutta and regularly visiting Nepal on business, he became one of the first Europeans to start collecting Nepalese coins in Nepal. A historian by inclination, he approached the coins in a systematic and scholarly way. He not only collected himself, but also encouraged his Nepalese friends to study and collect their own coins. He generously shared his knowledge with many scholars, and all who were privileged to know him will miss his sound advice, based on immense learning and communicated with an inimitable sense of humour. In his will he requested that his collection remain available for future students, and it is now housed in the British Museum, London.\n\nCONTENTS PREFACE INTRODUCTION MAP\n\nCHAPTER I.

Situated at a height of over 4000 ft in the foothills of the Himalayas, it is a flat, circular area, over ten miles in diameter, surrounded on all sides by mountains. and with only a narrow exit for the two rivers that converge in the Valley. Both local tradition and modern geologists agree that the Valley was once filled with a lake that drained some thousands of years ago. Certainly the sediment that has been washed down from the mountains has left an extremely fertile soil that can support up to three crops a year. Situated between the searing heat of the Indian plains to the south and the cold and desolation of the Tibetan plateau to the north. protected by a natural defensive rampart of mountains, and blessed with such fertile soil, the Valley must have appeared like a Shangri La to the first human inhabitants. Whether these first inhabitants came from Tibet or from the Indian plains is not known. As regards language the Newars, who are the most established inhabitants, speak Tibeto-Burman dialects, implying an origin in Tibet to the north or in Burma to the east. Their physical features seem to indicate an eastern origin. and hence a migration from Burma through Assam and thence to Nepal from the south. but this is far from proven. In any case, over the centuries numerous refugees have sought sanctuary in the Valley from the various waves of invaders that have swept across northern India. Some of these new arrivals had been rulers of kingdoms in the plains. and imported aspects of their culture with them. while also absorbing the developing culture of the Valley. Whereas on the steep hillsides only subsistence farming could be achieved, in the Valley the farmers could support urban communities with specialist craftsmen and artists, as well as traders and priests. With such a varied community, the Valley was remarkable for its ecumenism. The Hindu and Buddhist religions flourished side by side, and many of the old traditions of India that were lost in the plains because of centuries of Muslim rule have been preserved in the Kathmandu Valley. The Valley has, therefore, developed a culture and civilisation of its own, quite separate from the rest of Nepal, although throughout much of its history it dominated the surrounding hills commercially and politically. Indeed. this little Valley, with several independent towns in it, often supported more than one kingdom. and the intrinsic difference between the communities within the Valley is demonstrated by the fact that several mutually incomprehensible dialects of the Newari language are still spoken in the one valley. The climate of the Valley. being warm and damp during the monsoon season, did not permit the storage of wealth in the form of grain. and hence surplus, when\n\n14\n\nTHE COINAGE OF NEPAL\n\nacquired, had t o be consumed. One way was t o use the grain to pay labourers, monks and artists to build fine temples and houses, to carve exquisite sculptures of stone or wood, to produce beautifully illustrated religious manuscripts or to cast intricate metal work. Another way was to trade the grain for more durable goods, such as precious stones o r metals. In short, this was a society in which coin could play an important and useful role as a medium for the accumulation of wealth, as well as a medium of exchange. A limiting factor was that the only metals available locally were base metals, such as copper, iron and lead, none of which were accepted as suitable for the storage of wealth, while silver and gold were only available as a result of trade with neighbours to north or south. In light of the above, it is not surprising that our book concentrates on the coins struck in the Valley. We have, however, also described the coins that were struck outside the Valley and within the borders of present day Nepal, as well as those struck by the rulers of the Valley in mints beyond the borders. We will complete the picture by mentioning a few of the foreign coins that circulated in the Valley, and the extent of circulation of Nepalese coins beyond the borders of the country. We d o not, however, intend to describe all the coins that may have reached parts of what is now Nepal, at times when the territory concerned had no political connection with the Valley. The earliest coins found in the Kathmandu Valley are two silver punch-marked pieces of the type that circulated extensively in northern India until the third century AD. The two pieces were discovered shortly before January 1983. Unfortunately, the illustration given in the newspaper is not clear enough to identify the punches exactly, but from their size and fabric one may locate them among the series struck by the Maurya Dynasty in Indian mints.' Although such finds are very unusual in the Valley, a large number of similar pieces have been found in the Terai area in the south of Nepal (an area beyond the influence of the Valley at this early period), where the Government of Nepal has concentrated its resources and staff for archaeological excavations in recent ~ it years.' Excavations in the Valley have been few and not very p r o d ~ c t i v e ,and is too early to judge whether these imported punch-marked coins played any signifi-\n\n' Rising Ncpul, 3rd January, 1983.

It is worth observing that we are not aware of punch marked coins being offered by curio dealers in the Valley, except occasional pieces that the dealers themselves have brought in from India. The next class of imported coin found in the Valley are Kushan copper pieces. Such coins were struck in huge numbers, and circulated extensively over northern India from an uncertain date (it depends on the Kushan chronology, which remains one of the most controversial issues in the history of the Sub-continent) until the fifth century and even later. Several varieties have been found, covering the full range of the series, although the timing of their arrival in Nepal is not certain. We know only of single pieces found by local people and offered for sale by curio dealers, and are not aware of any significant hoard^.^ The implication is that these imported coins were used for small offerings to temples o r as a medium of exchange, rather than as a store of wealth. Certainly their discovery in Nepal demonstrates some commercial contact between the Valley and the plains, and these copper coins were to become the inspirations and prototype6 for the fine series of copper coins that were struck during the first real flowering of Nepalese culture, under the Lichhavi kings. Walsh reported that two Kushan coins, one of Kadphises and one of Kanishka. were dug up in Kathmandu and sent to him by Col. Pears (Walsh. op. cit.. 1908. p. 6 7 7 ) Tara N. Mishra was shown some Kushan coins that had been found. with some Lichhavi coins. in a garden in the Kathmandu Valley. but gave no further details (T. N . Mishra, 'The Kushan coins from Rangapur'. Ancient Nepal, no. 75 (April-May 1983). p. 28). Kushan coins found in Nepal, and now in the Valdettaro collection include the following: Kadphises (BMCPI. XXV.1) Wt. I 1.0g Kanishka OADO (BMC PI. XXVIII.6) Wt. 16.9 g Huvishka. King on Elephant. (BMC PI. XXIX.2) Wt. 14.3 B Huvishka. King on Couch. (BMC PI. XXIX.5) Wt. 14.5 g Vasudeva. KingSiva. Nandi. (BAIC PI. XXIX.14) Wt. 6 . 1 g Kushan-like Coin. with standing figure on both sides. similar to the pieces published by J. Cribb in Coin Hoar-d.~Vll. pp. 30 1-5. Wt. 6.9 g. The Kushan copper coins are the first to show the\n\ncircular border of pellets thal features so prominent& on the Lichhavi coins. Some authors have asserted that the Kushan coins are too heavy to have been the prototype, and have suggested the later Yaudheya copper coins (e.g. IMC. vol. I. PI. XX1.18-20) as a more likely candidate. At first glance this seems feasible. 21s the weight is similar and the border ofpcllels is larger. However. we are not aware of Yaudheya coins circulating as far east as Nepal. and we prefer to think [hat both series have their common root in the Kushan coinage. Some authors (e.g. T . P. Verma in Sluclics in the Hisrory and Culturc~q/ .V(~pal(Varanasi. 1977). p. 35) have observed that the iconography o r the Nepalese copper coins is more similar to ceriain Gupta coins than to the Kushan series. While illustrations in catalogues may give that impression. the Gupta coins concerned are struck in gold. and could hardlk have set the trend for copper coins. which were designed by artists who probably never saw such gold pieces. Certainly we are not aware that any Gupta gold coins have ever been found in the Valley.\n\nCHAPTER I THE LICHHAVI PERIOD, C.AD 576-750 1. SUMMARY DESCRIPTION O F T H E COINS The earliest coins that are found in large numbers in Nepal, are a series of copper pieces bearing religious designs, beautifully executed, with legends in a form of Gupta script. The legends are usually religious in nature,' although a few have personal names that can be identified with rulers of Nepal during the seventh century. These copper coins can be divided according to their legends into eight main groups (A-H). In addition two groups (I and J ) of late, barbarous. copies, one of which is a silver coin, may belong to this period. The copper groups are as follows: A . Coins with legends 'Sri Mananka' on one side and 'Sri Bhogini' on the other. B. Coins with the name of' 'Sri Amshuvarman' on one side. with either the name of the deity 'Kamadohi' or the title 'Maharajadhirajasya' on the other. C. Coins with the name and image of' the deity 'Vaisravana' on one side, and on the other side the legend 'Kamadohi'. D. Coins in the name of 'Sri Jishnu Gupta'. E. Coins with the legend 'Sri Gunanka' and the image of an elephant. F. Coins with the name of the deity 'Vrsha' over a standing bull. G . Coins of a wide variety ordesign and fabric with the name of the deitj 'Pashupati'. H . Coins of small size with the names of'the deities 'Vrsha' on one side and 'Siva' on the other. I. Small, thin, coins in copper with crude designs copied from coins of group G . J. Thin silver coin with trident.\n\nAmshuvarman and Jishnu Gupta were both rulers of Nepal during the period of the Lichhavi Dynasty. The former ruled initially as Chief Minister (Samanta) for King Sivadeva until the latter's death C.AD 605. and then as sole ruler until his own death in AD 621. Jishnu Gupta ruled as Chief Minister from about AD 622 until his death in about AD 642. These provide fixed points for the dating of a few of the coins, but other evidence can be found to help with the arrangement and attribution, including the dating, of the whole series.

D O C U M E N T A R Y E V I D E N C E F O R C O I N S IN T H E LICHHAVI PERIOD Most of the information about the period of the Lichhavi kings of Nepal is derived from a series of stone inscriptions dated between AD 464 and the early eighth cent ~ r y Apart . ~ from the chronological evidence they provide, several of them refer to sums of money expressed in coin. The denominations used for specifying sums of money may be summarised as follows : The term 'Pana' is found on several inscriptions as a unit of currency. The earliest is an undated inscription from the time of Sivadeva (C.AD 576-605),~ and the latest an undated inscription from the time of Jayadeva 11, who came to the throne some time after AD 701, and was still ruling in AD 735.4 The Harigaon inscriptions of Amshuvarman, dated AD 606 and 60g5, contain an abbreviation 'Pa' which clearly also refers to the 'Pana'. A more descriptive term 'Tamrapana' appears on an inscription dated AD 598,6 and a similar term, 'Tamrikapana' is used on an inscription of Jishnu Gupta (C.AD 622-33),' and perhaps also on the undated inscription of C.AD 576-605 mentioned above.e The word 'Tamra' or 'Tamrika' means 'copper', hence both these terms must specifically refer to the copper coins in circulation, and show that they were valued at one 'pana'. KARSHAPANA\n\nThe Thankot inscription of Jishnu Gupta, dated AD 635, has a passage that can be translated '. . . . I will reduce it for you by half, as for the tax on . . ., he who should give one Karshapana, need only give eight panas, he who should give eight panas, need only give f o u r . ' V h i s inscription clearly shows that a 'Karshapana' was a value given to 16 panas. In the plains of India and in common numismatic parlance, the term 'Karshapana' or 'Purana' was given to the old silver punchmarked coins that have been found-in the single case above mentioned-in the These stone inscriptions have been published most usefully by Raniero Gnoli.

The same term is also found in an inscription dated AV ggo.l0 PURANA\n\nThe Harigaon inscriptions of Amshuvarman, dated AD 606 and 608,\" refer to sums of money expressed in terms of 'Pu' and 'Pa', always in that order, presumably abbreviations for 'Purana' and 'Pana', which occur in full on other inscriptions. That the 'Pa' is the smaller of the two denominations is clear. not only from the implication of the order in which they are written, but also because it only occurs in amounts of I , 2, 4 and 5, which would not be inconsistent with a ratio of 16 Panas to I Purana. Although the word 'Purana' literally means 'old', it is usually synonymous in India with 'Karshapana' and so it is probable that it refers to a unit of account for I 6 Panas. PANAPURANA\n\nAnother term, 'Panapurana', appears in inscriptions dated C.AD 656,12 AD 679,'' AD 697 or AD 70214 and C.AD 69815 and appears to refer to coins. The word literally means 'old panas', and may indicate just that-the old full weight copper panas. rather than new light-weight panas. However, some numismatists have asserted that the phrase implies a Purana (Karshapana) of silver. counted out as (sixteen) Panas of copper.16 Certainly the appearance of a new word implies some change in the coinage circulating in the mid-seventh century. What may be the last mention of coins occurs in the long 'Naksal' inscription.'' Unfortunately it is undated, but was thought by Levi to be not much earlier than the Jayadeva inscription of AD 735. Here the term 'Panapurana' appears together with 'Pana'. The amounts in panas go up to 400, and in panapuranas up to rooo, and at one point the two are mentioned in one sentence- '6 panapurana together with one double pana (dvipana)'. As in the earlier inscriptions, the 'Purana' is also used together with the 'Pana', and in amounts up to 'loo Purana'. The full implications of this text are very difficult to assess. Dr D. R. Regmi has attempted a translation,lRbut has not managed to make sense of the sums of money quoted. A very interesting phrase in this inscription has been translated by Regmi as ' 1 0 panapurana in ayaksika (without the image of Yaksa) coins'. All that can be said is that the large numbers of both Panas and Panapuranas seem to imply the use of two distinct types of coin, and the term 'dvipana' may imply a 'double pana' rather than merely ' 2 panas'. As for the demigod Yaksa. since we know of no coins with his image. we cannot speculate why those coins without his image should warrant a special mention. R c g m ~XLIX G n o l ~XXXV. dnd XXXVI.

Levi was uncertain of the meaning of this last phrase, but we may, perhaps, accept the translation 'clay tokens' suggested by R. N. Pandey.'O This term also appears in an inscription of Narendradeva dated C.AD 656'l along with the term panapurana. Regmi translated this word as 'pieces of white chalk' in the earlier inscription, but as 'earthen pieces' in the later one. Nowadays, in the bazaars of Kathmandu, many clay 'tokens' can be found, imitating Nepalese coins of various eras.22A few are early and, being of no intrinsic value, were made for the poor to donate to particular deities or for pilgrims to keep as souvenirs of temples. Others may have had some more secular function, but most are merely modern tourist souvenirs. Certainly none that have been discovered hitherto could be the Lichhavi Mrittika described above, with the possible exception of the two religious amulets illustrated by Regmi.23 AD\n\nFrom the above documentary evidence it is clear that coins circulated from at least the last years of the sixth century, until the early years of the eighth century. The basic coin was called a 'Pana' and was struck in copper, and there may have been a subsidiary coinage of clay tokens. The epithet, 'Tamrika' or 'copper', must refer directly to copper coins of the denomination ' I pana'. There is no direct evidence that coins of a higher denomination circulated, but the 'Karshapana', probably also called a 'Purana', was a unit of account valued at 16 pana. Although the absence of reference to coins in the inscriptions dated earlier than the AD 590s cannot be regarded as firm evidence that coins were first struck around that date, it does provide an indication that this might be the case. Similarly the lack of references to coins in inscriptions after the early eighth century gives some indication that from then on coins did not play as important a part in the economy as they had done during the seventh century. The change from 'pana' to 'panapurana' in the mid-seventh century shows that some change in coinage standard may have occurred at that time. Apart from these local sources, two contemporary Chinese travellers mention copper coins circulating in Nepal during the seventh century. The earliest and most famous of these travellers was the Buddhist pilgrim Hsuan Tsang, who visited northern India about AD 637. He probably did not visit the Nepal Valley himself. but his account seems reliable, and he notes that 'coins of red copper are used in exchange'.24 The other Chinese traveller was Li I-Piao, an army officer, who was sent to India by way of Tibet and Nepal shortly before A D 645. He reported that Gnoli XXXI. Rcglni LXIII. N. Pandey. 'The Altribution of Pashupall Coins'. Jorrrr7trl o/ 111c.Trihhrr~~trrr L:~~i~.cr.ti/l,. vol. 111. no.

N U M I S M A T I C E V I D E N C E F O R DATING T H E C O I N S Evidence for dating can be obtained from the coins themselves by analysing the fabric (weight, diameter, alloy, method of striking), the design (type, die-links, inscription, epigraphy), the rarity or abundance of an issue (or number of dies used, from which may be estimated the size of the issue). and the hoard evidence. WEIGHT\n\nMost of the coins listed and illustrated in the catalogue have been weighed. These weights have been analysed in detail on the table overleaf. Some pieces, particularly those with lead in the alloy, will have suffered considerable weight loss since they were struck, and this should be considered when analysing the weights, although we have deliberately excluded badly damaged coins. The analysis shows a remarkable range of weights within the various groups, although it is consistent with a method of manufacture that. while aiming for a given number of coins from a given weight of metal, did not check the weight of each particular specimen. Similarly the variation in average weight between the different groups is very significant. Some authorsz6 have postulated that the different weights represent different denominations. However, the range of weights within each type shows that this cannot be the case, as it would have been impossible to differentiate in practice. Many coinages in other parts of the world show a gradually declining weight standard over time, and this seems to have been the case in Nepal. MacDowall used this principle in his study of the Lichhavi coins.z' but he collected the weights of relatively few specimens.

Lichhavi coins appear to be struck using at least three different types of alloy:\n\nI . A copper/iron alloy, used only for a few types, notably 'Mananka' group A.2. One example, submitted to the chief assayer of the Calcutta Mint has revealed a content of 56.45 per cent copper, 43.07 per cent iron. The presence of the iron can be readily detected as such pieces are strongly attracted to a magnet. The iron, when present in these Mananka coins, seems always to be in a fairly high proportion, as no pieces respond weakly to the magnet. A few rare specimens of Pashupati G.3b respond weakly to a magnet. indicating some iron content, but a relatively small proportion. 2. A copper/lead alloy found in many different groups. often detectable because the lead has reacted with the copper producing a white powdery effect on the surface, and in some cases corrosion has been very serious. causing the coin to disintegrate totally. 3. Fine copper, distinguishable by the lack of white corrosion and magnetic effect, the fine copper colour when the coins are cleaned, and the frequent presence of a green patina.

This indicates that the box was collected in Kathmandu, and that the dams circulating there at that time were mainly, but not exclusively. struck by the kings of Kathmandu. We d o not know whether the same rule can be applied to larger denomination coins. In contrast to the silver coins, Malla gold coins are of the highest rarity. The genuine coins3s known to us consist only of a full range of denominations of Jayaprakash Malla of Kathmandu dated NS 873 (AD I 753). and a few isolated gold dams, namely, one anonymous early seventeenth century piece, one of lndra Malla (AD 1706-9) of Patan, and one of Ranajit Malla (AD 1722--69)of Bhatgaon. In all cases, except for the seventeenth century dam, these gold coins are struck with the same dies as the more common silver coins, so that production must have been very limited, presumably for some form ofceremonial purpose. rather than a monetary one. The most likely reason why Jaya Prakash was able to strike gold coins is that he probably exchanged gold from Tibet for silver from India.36 The fact that almost all the gold coins of Jayaprakash Malla that we have seen have been in Europe for many years suggests that the bulk of the production was exported to India at the time in exchange for silver, which was then used, partly to be exported to Tibet, and partly to finance the war effort.37 Apart from these specimens of gold coins, some Malla documents refer to gold coins in use. One manuscript dated NS 750 (AD 1630) refers to a gift to Raja Lakshminarasimha of Kathmandu of 'mohor tanka 60 lumohortanka 2', whlch Hemraj Shakya translates as '60 rupees and 2 gold coins'.3a Several other documents refer to 'Suvarna mulya', which could be translated as 'gold coins'. for instance '. . . suvarna mulya panchasashtato Kavindramallitanka 75',39 but the meaning of this passage is not completely clear to us. It may refer to '(the value of) 75 gold coins, to be paid in Kavindramalli tankas'. or perhaps to '(the value of) 7 Kavindramalli tankas. payable in gold'. Alternatively it may merely mean that the sum of 75 Kavindramallitanka was to be paid in coin as valuable as gold. and so not indicate that gold coins were used for the transaction in any way. Whatever the meaning, we believe that gold coins played only a minor role in Nepalese currency during the Malla period. 3 5 Several forgeries of gold coins of the Malla period are known. See p. 209. 3\" Part of a correspondence has survived. showing that Prithvi Narayan tried to negotiate just such an exchange of silver from India ror gold from Tibet in about AD 1756. cf.

METROLOGY The standard of the silver used for striking the coins during the later Malla period has been noted as variable by many authors, although no scientific analyses have been published. The detailed results of our analysis of the weight and fineness of Malla silver coins are contained in Appendices 3 and 4, but it is worth summarising the conclusions here. T o begin with the tanka coins were struck in fine silver with a weight standard about 10.3 g. Many of the later tankas are debased, with some containing no silver at all. Similarly, the weight standard was reduced rather erratically, with weights of individual specimens ranging as low as 8 g. After AD 1640 a good standard of silver was adopted, and until about AD I 728 averaged about 95 per cent or better. After AD 1728 the fineness reduced slightly to 92.5 per cent, but about AD 1735 all the Malla silver coins were dramatically debased to about 6 7 per cent fine (i.e. 2 parts silver to one part copper/brass). The fineness deteriorated even further in the 0 sabout 50 per cent (1.e. equal parts silver and copper/brass), and late ~ ~ 1 7 4 to this debased standard continued until about AD I 753. After AD I 753, all coins struck in the Valley once again reverted to about 95 per cent fine. In contrast to the silver content, the weight standard adopted for the mohars after A D 1640 never changed from about 5.4 g. The earliest mohars struck in Kathmandu show a wide variation from about 3.9 g to 5.6 g, without any discernible bunching, but this may have been due to initial technical difficulties in striking coins to a constant weight standard. Thereafter, a standard of 5.4 g was very closely adhered to, with only occasional issues differing significantly. For example, during the period ofgreatest debasement, from AD I 745-53, a weight standard of 5.25-5.3 g was used in all three Valley kingdoms. In general, at any particular time, the coins of the three kingdoms seem to have used the same alloy. Indeed, the assumption that this must have been the case, allows a more accurate dating of certain issues of Patan, where the coins were merely dated to the year of accession of the king. As regards weight, there was some variation between the kingdoms. For instance the coins of Jitamitra Malla of Bhatgaon are particularly heavy, which may account for their rarity, and Patan coins around AD 1700 seem very slightly lighter than the coins of the other kingdoms, but by no more than I or 2 per cent on average. Before the discussing the coins themselves in detail, let us consider the economic and historical background to their issue.\n\n5. T H E E C O N O M Y O F N O R T H E R N I N D I A I N T H E SIXTEENTH CENTURY The sixteenth century was a time of great political and economic change in northern India, consequent upon the arrival of the Moghuls and their inlposition of a single rule over the area, and the growth of international trade through European traders who brought, among other things, silver 111inedin the New World.\n\nT H E MALLA D Y N A S T Y , A D 1540- 1768\n\n65\n\nThese factors had a dramatic effect on the coinage of northern India. Very few silver coins had been struck during the fifteenth century, except in Bengal. By contrast, silver rupees were struck in large numbers during the reigns of the Afghan sultans of Delhi, Sher Shah (AD I 538-45) and Islam Shah (AD I 545-52). and during the reign of the Moghul Emperor Akbar (AD I 556-1605). Also during the sixteenth century several northern Indian states introduced silver coinages of their own. Some of these new coinages were issued by the Hindu states surrounding Bengal,4O and it is interesting to see that the amount of coin issued in Bengal during the period of Akbar's rule seems to have been rather less than that struck during the rule of the Sultans. There are several reasons why silver may have been in short supply in Bengal at that time. First and foremost, taxes were payable to the Moghul emperor in silver. In addition, Bengal seems to have had a balance of payments deficit which meant that silver was used to purchase goods imported into Bengal, and hence must have travelled along the trade routes of the time, enabling the neighbouring states to strike silver coins. It is therefore instructive to see how and why the silver reached the new mints. One significant factor was the development of organised trans-Himalayan trade. In Tibet, the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were periods of peace. with much of the economic power in the hands of the monasteries. The monasteries had. for many years, been sending 'tribute' missions t o China, which were purely trading ventures on the part of the Tibetans. The 'tribute' consisted of products of Tibet, such as salt, gold dust, wool and musk, and the Tibetans returned laden with quantities of silk, tea and porcelain of much greater value. During the early sixteenth century this trade route to the east became rather dangerous with political disturbances in western China, and the Ming Sliil~states that from the time of the Shihtsung Emperor (AD I 522-66) 'Tibetan lamas rarely went to China'.4L The Tibetans then began to exchange their surplus goods for grain and silver from Bengal. Cooch Behar, a small Hindu state in the plains north of Bengal, close to the river Torsa which provides an easy route through Bhutan to Tibet. began issuing silver coins on a large scale during the reign of Nara Narayan (AD I 555-87).42 The English adventurer Ralph Fitch records the trade with Tibet that passed through Cooch Behar during the time of his visit in A D 1583:~ and this trade must have been on a large scale. judging by the number of surviving coins. 6. T H E K I N G D O M O F D O L A K H A\n\nThe first state to strike large silver coins in Nepal was the little kingdom of Dolakha. situated in the valley of the Tamba Kosi, about 50 miles east of the Kathmandu Cooch Behar. Jaintiapur and Kachar struck coins for the first tinie in the sixteenth century. and Tripura increased the output of its mint substantially at that time. 4 ' cf. T. V . Wylie.

The Kosi valley provided an easy trade route up to the Tibetan plateau, and this was certainly the reason for its prosperity. During the reign of Yaksha Malla (AD 1428-82) in the Kathmandu Valley, Dolakha was ruled by feudatories, but some time after his death, the kingdom declared its independence. This independence was to last for about a century, and ceased when Dolakha was conquered by the Malla kings of Kathmandu about AD 1 6 0 0 . ~ ~ In the mid-sixteenth century Jaya Indra Simha, the King of Dolakha, struck fine silver tankas. Although the coins are undated, their period of issue can be determined, since two inscriptions of this king have survived, dated AD I 545 and AD I 547, and inscriptions giving the names of other kings dated AD I 534 and AD I 549 suggest bounds for Jaya Indra Simha's reign. Very few of these tankas have survived, although the fact that the six known specimens are struck from six different obverse dies and four different reverse dies, indicates that the issue was on a reasonably large scale. Certainly it cannot have been purely ceremonial in nature. One inscription in Dolakha dated AD 1599 records a sum of money in 'Obha Tanka' (silver tankas), which may refer to the coins of Dolakha, or to the contemporary coins of the Malla kings of the Valley.4s 7. M A H E N D R A M A L L A ISSUES S I L V E R C O I N S I N K A T H M A N D U The most significant numismatic event to take place in the sixteenth century in the Valley of Nepal, was the striking of fine silver tankas, proudly proclaiming the name of Mahendra Malla (AD 1560-74). These large silver coins are of the greatest and their issue was remembered in local folklore; for over 200 years, Nepalese silver coins were known colloquially as 'Mahendramalli'. Presumably Mahendra Malla struck the coins using silver acquired as the result of some trade between India and Tibet, albeit short-lived and on a small scale.47 As for the date of their introduction, the first use of the denomination 'tanka' occurs in ~ ~ implies that Mahendra Malla struck his silver a land grant dated AD 1 5 6 6 . This coins relatively early in his reign, and the absence of references to the 'tanka' in earlier documents indicates that the silver coins issued by the Muslim rulers of the plains were not fully integrated into the Nepalese currency system prior to this date. The account of the event given in the local chronicles throws an interesting perspective on the historical and economic situation at the time: 'He sent a present of wild fowl and hawks to the Great Mughal at Delhi and obtained permission from him to coin M a h e n d r a n ~ a l l i ' . ~ ~ 44\n\nFor an account oPDolakha, cr.

C O P I E S O F B E N G A L I T A N K A S S T R U C K I N N E P A L During the sixteenth century, and perhaps also earlier, silver coins from the plains of India must have reached Nepal in the course of trade. Both the tankas of 'Ala-uddin Mahmud Shah Khilji (AD I 295-1 3 I 5) of Delhi and of Ghiyas-ud-din Mahmud Shah (C.AD 1515-39) of Bengal were used as prototypes for the later Malla silver coins. Very few of these Indian silver coins survived the melting pot in NepaLss but some distinctive copies of Bengali tankas have been found in the Valley. These pieces are struck with a legend that is blundered at the point where the sultan's name should be, but the prototype appears to be late fourteenth or early fifteenth century. They are found almost exclusively in and usually have three distinctive countermarks, which are very like the shroff marks found on so many Bengali tankas of the period. T o the Nepalese trader. unable to read the Arabic script, these copies would have been indistinguishable from the genuine Bengali E. H. C. Walsh, op. cit.. (1908).p. 684. D.

He describes a painting showing Mahendra Malla playingdice with the daughter of a Muslim ruler, and says that 'legend has it that Mahendra Malla had obtained permission rroln the Muslim ruler of Bengal to mint coins in his own name because he had greatly pleased the princess by playing dice'. Cinyawali observes that this story should not be taken literally.

Since they are found in Nepal, to the virtual exclusion of the genuine coins, we believe that they were made there for local circulation, and perhaps for occasional export to India, but whether they were struck officially or by an enterprising merchant is less certain. As to the period of issue, that is also uncertain. They may have been struck before the time of Mahendra Malla, who was the first Nepalese king to put his name on a fine silver coinage, but they could also have been struck later in the sixteenth century, before a regular silver coinage was established in Nepal. The existence of a specimen with a flattened reverse, similar to that found on certain early seventeenth century Nepalese tankas, suggests a relatively late date. Certainly, these anonymous pieces were either issued by a ruler afraid of offending the fierce Muslims of the plains, and who preferred to strike pieces that would be unrecognisable as his, or by an enterprising businessman who may have forged the coins for personal gain.\n\n9. T H E T A N K A S T A N D A R D C O I N S After Mahendra Malla, and before the recoinage of AD 1640, the only large coins struck in the Valley were a series of silver coins with legends in blundered Arabic and weights based on, but slightly lighter than the tanka of the Sultans of Bengal. These coins are all very rare now, so much so that E. H. C. Walsh was not able to find a single example when he wrote his pioneering article. However, from the variety of types that have been discovered in recent years, it is clear that this rarity is more the effect of their withdrawal from circulation in AD 1640, than because they were struck in small numbers. Furthermore, since many of the coins are debased, they would not have been worth saving for their silver content. The tankas come in two distinct designs:\n\nCoins. as abovc. with a circular legcnd in crude Arabic. taken Crorn part of the lcgcnd o n a tanka of' .ud-din Khilji oC DelIhi.\n\nThe abovc drawing of the prototype shows how the legend was copied l'roni rhc central lines oC the Dclhi coin onto the circular dcsign of the Nepalese coin.

Strangely, the three kings whose names appear on these coins issued coins of both the above types. showing that the two types were issued at the same time in both kingdoms. This is surprising, and makes us wonder whether the two types can have been struck for different purposes. Walsh suggested that. as engraved. the second of the above designs, which we shall call the 'Ghiyas-ud-din' type. could be interpreted as a representation of Tibetan seal-script,57and one can go further and suggest that it could be interpreted as a view of the P ~ t a l a . 'Was ~ this design chosen to appeal to the Tibetans? Certainly such coins, although on the lighter mohar standard. continued to be struck by later Malla rulers. and were very popular in Tibet. It is possible. therefore. that coins of the 'Ghiyas-ud-din' type were intended for export to Tibet. while those of the first design, which we shall call the 'Ala-ud-din' type. were intended for local use in One problem with this theory is that we are not aware of any examples of tankas o r either design ever having been found in Tibet, but we can think of no other reason why the two designs should have been issued together. In addition to the full tankas, some minor denominations are also known. struck to the same standard.

D A T I N G T H E T A N K A S T A N D A R D C O I N S A few of the tanka standard coins are in the names of the following kings, and must have been struck during their respective reigns: Siva Simha. who ruled in Kathmandu ((..AD1578-1619) and in Patan (C.AD1598-1619) Hariharasirnha, who was installed by Siva Simha as Lord of Patan ((..AD1 6 0 ~ 9 ) Lakshminarasimha of Kathmandu (C.ADI 6 19-1641) Siddhinarasirnha of Palan ((..AD1619-1661). One of his tankas is dated AD 1639, the only piece with a date. Jagajjotir Malla of Bhatgaon ((..AD1613-37)\n\nThe majority of the coins, on the other hand, are anonymous and are more difficult to date. N o die-links have been discovered between a n anonymous coin and a regal coin, but there is a close similarity in style between some of the anonymous coins of the 'Ala-ud-din' type, and Lakshminarasimha coins of the same type. Other parallels can be drawn between various types and these are pointed out in the catalogue. The conclusion is that the anonymous coins were probably struck by the same kings who occasionally struck coins in their own names. The only reason for the anonymity that we can suggest is that the coins were intended to circulate throughout the Valley and beyond; if the name of a king of Kathmandu was on a coin, that might have reduced its acceptability in the other kingdoms. A further indication as to when these tankas might have been struck can be gained from looking a t the situation in Cooch Behar during the years around AD 1600. Between AD I 5 5 5 and about AD 1600 large numbers of silver coins were struck there, and the bulk of the trade between Bengal and Tibet passed through Cooch Behar. However, around AD 1603, Cooch Behar was invaded by a Moghul force and, according to the local chronicles, Lakshmi Narayan was specifically forbidden to strike coins of full rupee size. Very few coins were struck in Cooch Behar from C . A D 1603 until at least AD 1633 when Prana Narayan ascended the throne.60 This political unrest in the area may have encouraged the trans-Himalayan traders to seek other routes down from Tibet to India. Nepal was a n obvious route, and the political stability offered by Sivasimha's regime would have presented an ideal trading environment, particularly after he had gained control of the city of Patan and the territory to the south of the Valley. Sivasimha would then have been able to use some of the silver flowing into the country for his coinage in the early seventeenth century. It should be noted that as there were no indigenous sources of silver in Nepal, it could only be obtained by exchanging goods. And since Nepal had little to export t o India, it was only by taking a profit on entrep6t trade between Tibet and India that she could obtain sufficient supplies of silver for a coinage. It is certain that the route through Nepal was important in the AD 1620s. The first Europeans to travel along it were the Portuguese missionaries Cacella and Cabral. They reached Tibet through Cooch Behar and Bhutan, and had considerable difficulties along the route, which suggests that when they made their journey \"O cf. N . C3. Rhodes. 'The Coinage of Cooch Behar', op. cit. in n. 42. The coins or Vira Narayan (1627-33)\n\nare very much rarer Lhan those or his predecessor Lakshmi Nerayc~nand his successor Prana Narayan.\n\nTHE M A L L A D Y N A S T Y , A D 1540.-1768\n\n71\n\nin AD 1627, it was not a major trade route. After a short stay in Tibet they made their way back t o India through Nepal, but tantalizingly left no account of their experiences. However, there is no doubt that the Nepal route was the easiest way for them to leave Tibet in early AD 1628, and it must, by then, have been the main trade route.61 Soon after the route had been traversed by the Portuguese missionaries, King Rama Shah of Gorkha gained control of Kyirong. and hence of the trade route from Tibet. Although the chronicles are not clear on the precise dates, Bhima Malla seems to have recaptured the area in the early AD 163os, probably before Rama Shah's death in AD 1633, and hence re-established Kathmandu's hold over the trade routes and the trade.62 This implies that in the years around AD 1630, the Valley kings would have been cut off from the Tibetan trade, and hence from their source of silver. Coins struck at this time may have become debased with the more easily available base metals. With this limited information we can postulate when the various tanka-standard coins may have been struck. The results are summarised as follows:\n\nAfter 1603\n\nCopper coins struck by Ratna Malla and Amara Malla of Kathmandu. Dolakha issues tankas for a short time. Mahendra Malla of Kathmandu issues tankas for a short time. The main trans-Himalayan trade is routed through Cooch Behar. so that little silver reaches Nepal. At some undetermined timeduring the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century, copies of Bengali tankas are struck in Nepal. officially or unofficially. Transhimalayan trade is routed through Nepal, and significant supplies of silver reach the Vallev. Silver tankas struck in Kathmandu. and perhaps also in Palan. some anonymous. some with the name of Siva Simha; generally fine silver, but not always. Certainly fine silver pieces were being struck c. 1620. Two designs struck, initially the 'Ala-uddin type. and later both that and the Ghiyas-ud-din type. Tiny dams struck in Patan and Kathmandu in the names of Siva Simha and Hariharasimha. apparently not always fine silver. Tiny anonymous dams and jawa struck in Kathmandu and perhaps also in Patan. Silver tankas struck in the names of Kings Lakshminarasimha in Kathmandu and Siddhinarasimha in Patan, along with some anonymous issues. Initially fine silver. but becoming debased. Tiny dams struck in Bhatgaon. Rama Shah cuts the trade routes, and silver ceases to reach the Valley. Very debased tankas, mainly anonymous and light weight. and a few quarter tankas in the name of Lakshminarasimha. Once debased. the coinage continues debased Fine silver tanka struck in Patan in the name ofsiddhinarasimha.

NEPALESE COINAGE F O R TIBET As suggested above, one of the main reasons why Nepal was able t o strike silver coins was the channelling of the trade between Tibet and India through Nepal from the early years of the seventeenth century and the subsequent establishment of Nepalese trading houses in Lhasa. During the years immediately after AD 1640, two events encouraged an increase in this flow of trade, and also enabled Nepal to strike more coins. First, about AD 1640, the King of Ladakh forbad transit trade across his kingdom. This meant that the shawl wool that came from western Tibet could not reach the traditional weavers in Kashmir, which could not produce its Famous shawls unless an alternative supply route could be found. It was not long before wool was passing through Nepal to Patna, whence Kashmiri traders sent it to K a ~ h m i r . ~ ~ Secondly, in the early AD 1640s Bhima Malla, a brother of Pratap Malla of Kathmandu, led a successful campaign into Tibet. As a result he managed to negotiate a treaty between Tibet and Kathmandu, which included the following two conditions : I . It was agreed that Nepal would mint coins for Tibet; Tibet would use these coins internally and would either provide the silver required for their minting o r woilld pay for Nepali coins with gold. 2. Tibet agreed that all trade with India, even though conductcd by other than Newari merchants, would be channelled through the Kathmandu Valley in preference t o the routes t o the east ( i t . via Sikkini. Bhutan o r T a ~ a n g ) . ~ ~\n\nAs a result of this treaty, which was probably signed during the early AD 164os, Nepal gained the virtual monopoly of the major trans-Himalayan trade, and the Tibetans used Nepalese coins as their normal currency. Nepal entered one of the most prosperous periods in her history, reflected not only in the coinage, but also in the number of fine buildings that were erected in the Valley, many of which still stand today. This situation continued more or less unchanged until the early AD I 720s. In January I 722, during the reign of Mahindra Simha. Father Desideri, a Jesuit priest who had spent the previous five years in Tibet, passed through Nepal on his return journey to India and noted that : \"\" L. Pctcch.

I must explain that the Chincsc had no coinage. but simply large or small pieces o f silver. Exposed to some risk. to cxpense, and to thc long journey, the Thibctans sent this silver from Lhasa to Nepal to change into the money of the three petty kings who ruled that Kingdom. They charged nothing. but gave an equal weigh1 for the silver and gained many millions, especially the King of Kathmandu.' 6 5\n\nThis account is fascinating as it shows why the coins of Mahindra Simha are among the most common of the Malla dynasty. It also shows that many of his coins must have been struck between AD 1720, when the silver first reached Tibet, and AD 1722, which was the year Desideri visited Kathmandu and in which Mahindra Simha died. It confirms that by this time Nepalese coin had become so popular in Tibet that it was more acceptable among the local population than pure silver bullion. It seems amazing that the Tibetans did not try to strike their own coins in Tibet, thus saving much trouble and expense. but Tibet was a very conservative country, and the Nepalese traders must have advised very strongly against any such action.66Although the treaty negotiated by Bhima Malla in the AD 1640s did specify that Nepal would strike coins with silver provided by Tibet, this seems to have been the first time that it was done on such a large scale. We have analysed three specimens of Mahindra Simha's mohar (nos. 30314) and the silver content is surprisingly high and consistent at 95 per cent, even though we selected pieces which looked as if they might be debased. It seems, therefore, that the Nepalese made their profit out of the 5 per cent alloy, while the full cost and risk of transport to and from Nepal was undertaken by the Tibetans. Presumably, in Tibet, the coins circulated at a premium over bullion. and Father Domenico da Fano, writing in AD 1713 records that coins were worth a l o per cent premium for large transaction^.^' and Father Desideri's account indicates that this premium may have increased by AD I 720. In AD 1728, Jagajjaya Malla seems to have reduced the silver content slightly to about 92.5 per cent. This coincides with the year when Polhanas seized power in Lhasa after a civil war, and when another Chinese army arrived in Lhasa loaded with silver.68 Presumably much of this silver bullion was sent to Kathmandu by the Tibetans, and the Nepalese took advantage of the situation to increase their profit margin. It was around this time that Bhatgaon acquired a larger share of the Tibetan trade, judging from the scale of its coinage during the reign of Bhupatindra Malla (AD 1696-1722) and particularly during the reign of his successor Ranajit Malla O Z I .

Clearly Kathmandu had lost control over the trade route through Kuti, and Bhatgaon was able t o take full advantage by increasing its share of the trade in silver and coin. Indeed, Wright's Vamsavali records that Ranajit Malla 'was very prudent and economical. He sent a great quantity of his coin t o Lhasa, in exchange for which he got a large quantity of gold and silver.' 69 The next change in the relationship between the Nepalese and the Tibetans in currency matters occurred during the first reign of Jaya Prakash Malla of Kathmandu (AD1736-45). He sent a vast quantity of debased silver coins to Tibet, presumably struck from silver brought by the Chinese to Lhasa, either when the Dalai Lama returned to Lhasa in AD 1735 from exile in China, or with the mission that arrived in Lhasa after the death of the Yung Cheng emperor and the accession of Ch'ien Lung. This silver was presumably exchanged for the coins on a weight for weight basis. O n this occasion the coins were further debased t o roughly 67 per cent fine silver, or 2 parts silver to I part copper or brass. It seems likely that the agreement with Tibet had changed, so that Nepal paid for the cost of transporting the bullion and coin from Lhasa t o Kathmandu and back. If so, the increased alloy would have been required to cover the cost of minting, transport and risk and to provide the normal profit for Kathmandu. These debased mohars continued to circulate extensively in Tibet well into the twentieth century, and are frequently found cut for use there as small change (see p. 207 below). During the rebellion of AD 1746-50, when the infant Jyoti Prakash was on the throne, Kathmandu continued to strike large numbers of debased coins for export to Tibet. The standard had now been reduced to only about 50 per cent fine, increasing the profit made by the Nepalese. In addition, the weight standard seems to have been reduced from c.5.4 g to c.5.25 g. This period coincides with the period after Polhanas's death in AD 1747, when the Tibetan government was rather weak. With the declining dominance of Kathmandu in Valley affairs, both Patan and Bhatgaon were taking their share of this trade, and they too were striking large amounts of coin, equally debased and struck to a similar light standard. In AD 1751 the seventh Dalai Lama took over the reins of political power, and one of his early acts was to write to the three Nepalese kings requesting them to put an end to the practice of circulating such debased coins, and asking them to send better quality coins to Tibet.70 At the same time, the control exercised by the Malla kings over the Tibetan trade was being threatened by the rising power of Prithvi Narayan, King of Gorkha. Already in AD 1744, he had gained control of the western trade route through Nowakot and Kyirong to Tibet, and he was ~ l first struck coins soon posing a serious threat to the eastern route, via K ~ t i . He in AD I 749, to the same debased standard as the Malla coins of the time. In view of these pressures, Jaya Prakash Malla seems to have taken the request of the Dalai Lama seriously, and in AD 1753 he struck a beautiful new series of coins in fine 6y\n\nWright, op. cit.. p. 196.\n\n'O\n\nT.W.

The appearance of gold coins is remarkable, and almost certainly indicates that a new trading relationship had developed, with Tibetans sending gold to Nepal, and receiving silver coins in exchange. Also, it may not be coincidence that at this time there was a decline in Chinese influence in Tibet, and hence a reduction in the amount of silver that reached Lhasa from China, so that Tibet would no longer have had surplus silver to send to Nepal. This new relationship between Tibet and the Malla Kings was not to continue. In AD 1754 Prithvi Narayan finally succeeded in gaining control of the trade route through Kuti, effectively cutting off the Valley from the Tibetan trade. At the same time the Gorkha king struck his own fine silver coins, exchanging them for gold with Tibet. In AD 1755 he signed a treaty legalising the circulation of these coins ~ short in Tibet and in AD 1757 reached a similar agreement with K a t h m a n d ~ . 'A correspondence has survived from AD 1757 reporting some negotiations between Prithvi Narayan's agent at Kuti and the Tibetans, regarding the exchange of gold for silver. Apparently 12,000 to I 5,000 tolas of gold were to be exchanged for silver coin at the rate of Rs.18 per tola of gold.73Presumably the 'rupee' referred to was the 'mohar', which weighed rather less than half a tola. This ratio of about 9:1 would have given Prithvi Narayan a satisfactory profit in India where the relationship was nearer I 4 :I .74 Prithvi Narayan struck fine silver coins in quantity in AD 1754 and 1756. but thereafter he minted coins only in small numbers until his final conquest of the valley in AD 1768. Clearly, his priorities were more towards political control of Nepal, rather than trade. However, for the first time in Nepal, he adopted the convenient practice of putting on the coin the date in which it was actually struck, rather than the accession year, or the year in which the variety was first struck. The practice of the Mallas of keeping a 'type immobilise' often helps in determining the accession date for the king, but cannot tell us exactly when. during a reign, significant numbers of coin were struck. In AD I 758 Kathmandu and Gorkha signed a treaty agreeing that their coins could circulate in each other's territory and that the Tibetan trade, including the import of gold and the export of silver coin. should be shared equally. It is, however, doubtful if this treaty was ever implemented as it was signed at a time when Prithvi Narayan had suffered a defeat and was temporarily unable to maintain the blockade of the Valley. In practice he was quickly able to reimpose the blockade and presumably repudiated the treaty. For the next ten years, from AD I 758 until I 768. Prithvi Narayan gradually completed his plan for the conquest of the Valley. His military strength was not great enough to attempt a direct assault. so he concentrated on\n\n'' L. E.

The Dalai Lama wrote to the Nepalese Kings about AD I 75 I , objecting to the debased quality of the coins sent to L h a ~ a , ~ ~ so perhaps no silver was sent from Tibet to Nepal at this time. In any case, when the new coins did appear in AD 1753 after a short-lived issue of debased pieces, the design was changed and coins were struck in fine silver for the first time since the AD I 730s. Furthermore, a fine series of gold coins was struck. 352. Gold Mohar\n\nWithin pointed octagon, trisul and legend ' ~ r 2i Jaya Praklsa Malla'.

Earlier provenances are not available for the specimens that appeared in a G .

At this stage, any attempt to explain this strange phenomenon would be pure speculation, but these remarkable gold coins may have been sent as a ceremonial gift when Jaya Prakash solicitied the help of the East India Company in AD I 766. The result of this appeal for assistance against Prithvi Narayan was the ill-fated Kinloch expedition, which was thoroughly defeated. as much by floods and fever as by thc Gorkha troops.
