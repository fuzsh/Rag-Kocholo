        "text": "Nepali Rupee is the official currency in Nepal, and its short form is NRS. Nepali currency comes in notes of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000. Paper notes of 1 and 2, and 25 are rare. Coins of Rs 1 and 2 are popular. You may get a 5-rupee coin as well.\n\nYou can exchange your currency (major - USD, EURO, POUND) through banks or legal currency exchanges. However, we advise you to exchange your currency in legal currency exchanges all over Thamel in Kathmandu to avoid lengthy bank processes and high fees.\n\nSome star hotels in Kathmandu, Chitwan, and Pokhara also exchange currency, but the rates they may offer differ from those offered by foreign currency exchange stalls in Kathmandu. Currency exchanges outside of Kathmandu are rare.\n\nMoreover, we advise you to carry small currency notes because small businesses outside Kathmandu valley may not accept Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 rupee notes because they might not have the change.\n\nOne Indian Rupee (INR) equals 1.6 NRS (10 INR is 16 NRS, and 100 INR equals 160 NRS).\n\nThere are several automated tailor machines (ATMs) in Kathmandu and other cities across Nepal. You may be able to withdraw Nepali Rupees from these ATMs. However, it is better to bring cash or a traveler's cheque to avoid ATM charges.\n\nMany banks have bank branches in most of Nepalâ€™s district headquarters and major cities across the country, such as Chitwan, Pokhara, or Lumbini. But, these branch offices rarely provide foreign currency exchange facilities.\n\nThe exchange rate of foreign currency often keeps fluctuating. The current exchange rate (2023) for 1 USD is about Rs.130."
