The Nepalese Rupee has a photo of its Excellency printed on it or minted in case of coins. The smallest unit of a Rupee is called Paise. 1 Paise is equal to the 100th part of 1 Rupee. The coins are generally in 5 denominations, 10 Paise, 25 Paise, 50 Paise, 1 Rupee, and 2 Rupees.\n\nThe currency notes are of various denominations. The smallest denomination is 1 Rupee note. Apart from that, you have 2 Rupees, 5 Rupees, 10 Rupees, 20 Rupees, 25 Rupees, 50 Rupees, 100 Rupees, 500 Rupees, and 1000 Rupees currency notes. The Nepalese currency is universally recognized and can be converted into any currency. It is a fully convertible currency. This can be done at money exchanges."
