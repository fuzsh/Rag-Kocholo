        "text": "The Nepalese rupee was established in 1932 as an official national currency and is used only in Nepal. It replaced the previously valid Silver Mohar. 1 Rupie is devided into 2 Mohur = 100 Paisa.\n\nSince 1994, the Nepalese rupee is tied to the Indian rupee with a fixed exchange rate. Therefore, 1 rupee always equals to 0.6250 Indian rupee.\n\nISO 4127:\n\nNPR\n\nNumeric:\n\n524\n\nSymbol:\n\n₨\n\nList of all currencies\n\nOverview: Nepal\n\n1.00 Nepalese rupees = 0.0074 US dollars\n\nCurrency:\n\nConvert to:\n\nAmount:\n\n↔ Reverse currencies\n\nExchange rate history 1000 NPR in USD\n\nThe graph shown here shows the exchange rate development from January 2018 to March 2024.
