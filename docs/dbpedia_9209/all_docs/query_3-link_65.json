        "text": "Coins and notes\n\nJust like India, one rupee is divided into 100 paise. When it comes to shrapnel, you can get both Paise (1, 5, 10, 25 and 50) and Rupee (Re.1, Rs. 2, Rs. 5, Rs. 10) coins. Notes, however, only come as rupees in the form of Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 20, Rs. 50, Rs. 100, Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000.\n\nYou might find it difficult getting change for a Rs. 1000 note away from big cities, so it’s worth having some smaller notes and coins on hand."
