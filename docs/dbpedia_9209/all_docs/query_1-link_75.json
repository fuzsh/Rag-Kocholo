        "text": "The Mohur today\n\nMinted to the exact specifications as its 16th century predecessor, the Mohur is directly inspired by the original coin and as a result bears the noble Lion and Palm Tree motif on its reverse, with the effigy of HM King Charles III on the obverse.\n\nEach Mohur weight is carefully calculated as a proportion of 11.66g, the equivalent to 180 grains and in keeping with the universal standard established by Sher Shah Suri as long ago as 1540, to ensure the historical authenticity of the coins.\n\nThe History of the Majestic Mohur\n\nMohur, meaning a symbol or seal, was first recorded in the history of world coinage as long ago as 1540. Introduced by the Mughal Emperor Sher Shah Suri, known locally as Sher Khan or the Lion King, it was a gold coin which symbolised the Emperorâ€™s power and wealth.\n\nSome may say it was fate that this symbol of wealth and prestige should come to represent The East India Company.\n\nThe Lion and Palm Tree Design\n\nBy 1800, The East India Company exercised administrative control over most of India, ruling over 400 million people. Its trade had brought vast wealth to Britain changing the very fabric of the nation. By 1835, King William IV decreed that there should be a universal coinage in India introducing the Coinage Act of 1835.\n\nAs a result One and Two Mohur gold coins were struck for the first time bearing the effigy of the King on the coin obverse and introducing for the first time, the iconic Lion and Palm Tree motif on the reverse. Lion and Palm Tree Mohurs were also minted for Queen Victoria, replaced with the Imperial Mohur design when she became Empress of India in 1877."
