        "text": "Nepalese Rupee - NPR\n\nOverview\n\nThe Rupee is the official currency of Nepal and is divided into 100 paisa. The Nepal Rastra Bank controls the issuing of currency. Unlike many countries, Nepal has three main exchange rates: the Rastra Bank rates (the government’s official rate), the private banks’ rate (slightly more generous), and the black market rate (the most generous, set by carpet shops and travel agents). When you leave Nepal from the Kathmandu airport, you will be limited on how many Rupees you can convert back to foreign currency. Only up to 10% of total of all receipts for exchanges from foreign currency into rupees will be converted back to international currencies.\n\nEconomy\n\nNepal&#8217;s GDP was most recently estimated at over US$12 billion (2008). GDP is comprised primarily of services (41%) and agriculture (40%), though agriculture employs roughly 75% of the country&#8217;s 10 million person workforce. The major types of produce include tea, rice, corn, wheat, sugarcane, milk, and water buffalo meat. Skilled labor represents one of the biggest impediments to economic growth.\n\nRoughly 25% of the population lives below the international poverty line (US$1.25 per day). Nepal is a recipient of aid from many Asian, North American, and European nations.\n\nExports primarily consist of commodities (gold, machinery, petroleum products, fertilizer), textiles (carpets, leather goods, clothing), and grains.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1932, the Rupee was introduced, replacing the silver Mohar at a rate of two Mohar = one Rupee. In Nepalese, mohru was the first name of the Rupee.\n\nIn 1933, the value of the Nepalese Rupee was pegged to the Indian Rupee at a rate of 1.6 Nepalese Rupees = 1 Indian Rupee.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950&#8217;s, coins were made from nickel, brass, and bronze.\n\nIn 1966, aluminum coins were introduced to replace the smaller denomination 1, 2, and 5 paisa, and brass coins replaced the 10 paisa coin.\n\nBanknotes were introduced in 1951, in 1, 5, 10, and 100 Rupee denominations. 500 and 1,000 Rupee notes were added in 1972.\n\nGeneral Information"
