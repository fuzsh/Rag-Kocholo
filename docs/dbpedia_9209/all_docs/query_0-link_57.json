        "text": "The unification of Nepal under the Shah dynasty in 1768 brought more standardized coinage. The Mohar coin, initially made of silver, became the standard currency. The coins often featured images of kings and deities, along with inscriptions in Nepali script.\n\nIn the 20th century, the currency system underwent significant changes. In 1932, Nepal introduced the Nepalese rupee (NPR), replacing the mohar. The new currency system included coins made from various metals, including nickel, copper, and aluminum.\n\nNepalese rupee (NPR) is the official currency of Nepal. The coins in circulation come in various denominations and are made from different metals. The current coins in circulation and their denominations are 1 paisa, 5 paisa, 10 paisa, 25 paisa, 50 paisa, 1 rupee, 2 rupee, 5 rupee and 10 rupee.\n\nNepal regularly issues commemorative coins to mark significant events, historical anniversaries, and notable figures. These coins can range from 20 rupee to higher denominations and are often sought after by collectors."
