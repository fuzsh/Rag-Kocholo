        "text": "What is the currency in Nepal?\n\nThe official currency in Nepal is the Nepalese Rupee, which is issued and overseen by the Nepal Rastra Bank. If you’re buying your travel money online you may also see the official code being shown - NPR. In stores and restaurants, Nepalese Rupee prices are likely to use the currency symbol रू.\n\nOnce you’re in Nepal you’ll see costs of items shown in NPR and you’ll need to start paying for things in local coins and notes which are often found in the following denominations:\n\nbanknotes - 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000 NPR and coins - 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 paisa; 1, 2, 5, 10 NPR.\n\nCan you officially pay in CAD when you are in Nepal?\n\nYou’re unlikely to be able to officially transact in CAD in Nepal, which is why it’s time to start getting used to NPR and learning more about the currency exchange rates so you’ll know what you’re spending on your trip.\n\nThis guide will walk through all you need to know, including Canadian dollar/Nepalese Rupee rates and where best to get your travel money from.\n\nNepalese RupeeCurrency nameNepalese RupeeISO codeNPRSymbolरूSubunitPaisaCentral BankNepal Rastra BankBest travel cards to take to Nepalhttps://wise.com/ca/card/?utm_source=exiap-ca&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=guides&utm_content=guides%2Fcurrency_in_nepal\n\nNPR coins and banknotes\n\nHere’s a full rundown of the NPR coins and banknotes you’ll need to be familiar with when you’re in Nepal.\n\nNPR banknotesNPR coinsbanknotes - 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000 NPRcoins - 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 paisa; 1, 2, 5, 10 NPR\n\nHistory of Nepalese Rupee currency\n\nThe Nepalese Rupee (NPR) was introduced in 1932, replacing the silver mohar at the rate of two mohar = one rupee. The change was part of the modernization efforts of the Rana rulers. The rupee was pegged to the Indian Rupee for a long time, reflecting the close economic relationship between Nepal and India. The currency is issued by Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal. The country's economy is largely dependent on tourism and remittances, which influences the value and stability of the Nepalese rupee.\n\nIs CAD accepted in Nepal?\n\nAs we’ve seen, the official currency in Nepal is NPR. If you carry CAD with you on your trip, you’ll probably need to exchange it before you can spend.\n\nSometimes when you’re away on a trip abroad you’ll find that merchants will take payments in a selection of major foreign currencies. However, the chances are that where this is offered, you won’t get a good exchange rate for your CAD. Planning smart and convenient ways to spend in NPR when you’re away is likely to mean you save on costs in the end.\n\nUsually, having a few different ways to pay and get cash is the best option for travelers and tourists. That’s because you’ll have a back up plan in case one payment method isn’t accepted for any reason, and you can pick the method that’s best suited to the specific transaction. Having a multi-currency card from a provider like https://wise.com/ca/card/?utm_source=exiap-ca&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=guides&utm_content=guides%2Fcurrency_in_nepal, plus your normal bank debit card, and some local cash in NPR should mean you’ve always got options. You can use your cash for small purchases and tipping, and make low cost payments and cash withdrawals with your multi-currency card, while keeping your bank card in reserve for emergencies.\n\nUse a travel card on your next trip to Nepal\n\nUsing a travel debit card in Nepal is usually cheap, safe and convenient. A few providers in the UK offer multi-currency cards which come with a linked payment account that lets you convert, hold and spend in NPR. That allows you to add a balance in CAD and switch over to NPR to lock in the exchange rate and set your travel budget.\n\nOnce you have NPR in your account there are no extra fees to make payments, and you’ll not have foreign transaction charges to worry about, either.\n\nHere’s a quick overview of a couple of handy travel debit cards you may want to order and use in Nepal.\n\nWhat is the currency exchange rate for £ 1 CAD/NPR?\n\nIt’s helpful to get to know the live CAD/NPR rate so you can easily calculate how much things are costing you while you’re on your trip abroad. The rate you need to focus on is the mid market rate, which is the one banks and major currency services get when buying and selling currencies. This rate isn’t always passed on to customers. Instead you may find that the CAD/NPR rate you get when exchanging travel cash includes a markup - an extra fee.\n\nFind the CAD/NPR mid-market rate from a currency conversion site or a website like this, so you can keep an eye on the market and compare the rates you’re offered as you travel against the mid-market rate easily.\n\nShould I exchange CAD to NPR before traveling to Nepal?\n\nIt’s a good idea to exchange CAD to NPR before you head off to Nepal, as you can often find a better exchange rate and lower overall costs before you travel.\n\nWhen you’re in Nepal you’re going to need NPR in cash for some of your spending - particularly when tipping or making smaller value purchases. Buying your NPR travel money in advance can get you better CAD/NPR exchange rates, and saves you wasting precious time shopping around for a good deal once you arrive in Nepal.\n\nTips for exchanging money in Nepal\n\nAt merchants and ATMs, make sure you’re charged in NPR. If you’re asked if you’d rather pay in CAD instead, say no. That’s a sign of dynamic currency conversion, which usually means extra costs. ATMs are widely used in Nepal so withdrawing money in target-currency is easy, particularly in big cities and Kathmandu.\n\nBest place to exchange currency in Nepal\n\nYou can get your NPR in Nepal in a couple of ways.\n\nYou’ll be able to use a travel debit card from a provider like [wise-affiliate-name-links] to make convenient payments and cash withdrawals and to convert funds online.\n\nOr if you prefer an offline solution you can carry some cash in CAD to exchange when you arrive. Currency exchange providers are often in airports and hotels, although the exchange shops in a city center are likely to be cheaper overall.\n\nHow to pay in Nepal?\n\nYou’ll need to have NPR to spend in Nepal. However, generally having a few different payment methods is a good plan. That means that if a merchant won't accept one, you’ve got a back up. It’s also reassuring to know you have a different way to pay if you were unlucky enough to have a card or some travel cash stolen. Here are your key payment options in Nepal.\n\n1. Debit or credit card\n\nCard payments can be helpful in shops, restaurants and hotels but there will be places where cash is also important. Order a travel card from a provider like Wise for cheap and fast transactions, including card payments and cash withdrawals as and when you need travel money in NPR.\n\n2. NPR cash\n\nCash is widely used in Nepal, so it’s worth having some with you at all times. You may want to exchange money to NPR before you leave, but it’s also usually convenient to make ATM withdrawals locally once you arrive in Nepal.\n\nYou’ll usually find you can use a card to make payments in Nepal, but carrying some cash in NPR is also reassuring. It’s often easier for tipping and making smaller purchases, plus you’ve got a nice backup if your card is ever out of action for some reason.\n\nIt’s a smart idea to have both a card and some cash in NPR when you’re in Nepal. Some merchants will prefer cash, but having a card for higher value payments and in busier more tourist places is also convenient. Consider using a travel card from a provider like Wise alongside your cash for flexibility.\n\nPaying for the trip in CAD\n\nIf you’re paying for things in Nepal with a CAD bank card you might find a foreign transaction fee is added. This pushes up your costs when you spend in a foreign currency, and can be tricky to calculate.\n\nTravel debit cards don’t always work this way. When you make purchases in Nepal using the [wise-affiliate-name-links] card you can either choose to convert your account balance to NPR in advance in the Wise app, or just leave your balance in CAD and let the card handle the transaction when you pay. You’ll always get the lowest available fee and there are no extra foreign transaction charges.\n\nConclusion - Currency in Nepal\n\nYou won’t be able to pay in CAD when you visit Nepal - so learning about the currency you need is essential. Whether you decide to use a travel debit card from a service like [wise-affiliate-name-links], or stock up on NPR in cash in advance, knowing the mid-market exchange rate can help you get the best available deal. Use this guide to learn all you need to know about the options, rates and fees for exchanging CAD to NPR, and make your money go further while you’re away.\n\nThe official currency in Nepal is NPR. You can’t usually pay in CAD in Nepal, so you’ll need to plan in advance to get your travel money sorted.
