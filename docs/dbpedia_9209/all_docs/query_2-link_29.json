        "text": "Although the outbreak of currency in the world was about 700 years before BC, there is evidence of its prevalence in Nepal during the Lichchhavi period around 1,400 years ago. This glorious fact of our country implies that Nepal is a very old country. Currency is also a major basis for studying and researching the history of Nepal from which historical facts, chronology, culture, religion, lifestyle, economy, commerce, etc. can be learned.\n\nThe first currency in the world:\n\nThe first currency is believed to have originated in Lydia, in the ancient Ionian state around present-day Turkey (Asia Minor), about two thousand seven hundred years ago. Money has a very deep connection to human history. It is understood that the people's attraction to the currency has been from the past due to the economic purchasing power of the currency and the price of the metal.\n\nHistory of Nepal - India\n\nUnder the present state of Bihar in India, the ruler of the Lichchhavi dynasty was operating a democratic and monarchical system of governance with other smaller contemporary dynasties. At the same time, Ajatashtru, the king of the Hariyak dynasty of the mighty Magadha, attacked and destroyed the republic. Then there were the rulers of the smaller states, some of whom had come to Nepal and lived in secret. They are believed to have started ruling the state afterward appearing as Lichchwe dynasty.\n\nWriting in Nepal\n\nThe chronology of the Lichchhavi kingdom in Nepal is said to have started from the fifth century. Their reign is based on the many inscriptions that were established at the time of the Lichcha. It is estimated to range from 464 to 880. But on the basis of some obscure sources, It has been said that since 185, litchis have begun to appear in Nepal. Historians study the Lichchhavi kingdom as ancient history of Nepal.\n\nThe initial currency of Nepal:\n\nNepal's own first indigenous currency began in the Lichchhavi kingdom in the fifth-sixth century. That first currency in Nepal is called Mr. Mannak. On the front of Mr. Mananak mudra is a lion raising a glove and the word Sri Mananka is written in secret script. Similarly, on the page, a lot of women sitting in the lotus and in the secret script Mr. Bhogini are written. Both sides are decorated with small dots. The shape of this currency is the same as that of kings of the Gupta dynasty of ancient India, in their coins, Samudragupta wrote Shri Paramakaraka (in the fourth century) and Chandragupta II (Vikramaditya) in the form of Shri Vedamanaka (in the fourth-fifth century).\n\nMany historians have been saying that they started in the time of King Mandev I, Nepal's earliest currency. The main reason for this is the word Mr. Mannak written in secret script in the foreground of the currency. The reign of Lichchhavi King Mandev I From 464 to 505, which means that Mr. Mannak's currency must have come out at that time. But after doing many research studies on this topic, some new facts have emerged in recent times. According to the news saying, Shri Mananka Mudra was started not by the time of the Hon, but only about a century after the birth of King Shiva. Some evidence of this has been attempted as follows.\n\nStudy of Inscriptions: After studying the inscriptions established during the Lichchav kingdom, Mandev I wrote about many subjects in his inscriptions, but there is no mention of currency. An inscription not mentioning the date of King Shivadev I (the reign of 590 to 605 AD), about a century after Manadeva I, is the word inscription on the currency, and this is probably the earliest inscription to date. Similarly, Another inscription of 598 contains the word copper coin on the currency. Anshuvarman's bodybuilding The inscription of 605 and also contains the word p. Due to this major reason, it is very strong that the fact that Mr. Anshuvarman initiated the Shri Mannadak Mudra, not only during the time of Manvdev-I but also during King Shivdev I.\n\nStudy of accumulation of money:\n\nThis principle has been strengthened by the fact that the accumulation of Lichcchivi currency received so far is not only stored in Shri Mannadak currency but is also frequently associated with Shri Maharajadhi Rajya and Kamadohi currency of Anshuvarman, which was published later.\n\nThe study of the script of Mr. Mannaka Mudra:\n\nAccording to the script experts, the use of Sri Mananak currency in the period of Manadev I, not only as of the script of the last period but has also proved to be another reliable proof.\n\nThe coronation of King Shivdev I:\n\nAnother possible cause is that of Shivdev I. He must have surrendered to his famed ancestor, Manadesh I, during the coronation of 590 (?). There is also a group that Anshuvarman was the chief emperor of King Shivdev I at this time (equivalent to the present-day Prime Minister) and because of this, the expulsion of the currency was due.\n\nThe use of the word value:\n\nWhile studying the meaning of the word value, it means that honor, respect, affection, ritual, etc., since it is possible to use the word value in the newly published coins of Shiva, cannot be ruled out.\n\nOn the basis of all these reasons, Mr. Mannak Mudra was initiated by Shri Anshuvarman in the time of King Shivdev I, not in the time of Hon.\n\nTechnical nature of Shri Mananka currency: Based on various sources and evidence, Shri Mananka currency was worth one penny today, which was then known as a pen (or copper). Later, the words Purana and Panpurana are also used. For mathematical calculation, the term Karshapana (16 but equal 1 Karashpan) also appears to be used. Mr. Mannanak's currency is round and seamless. After studying the weight of many specimens of that currency, each currency has a mean of 12 decimal 32 grams and a diameter of about 25 millimeters. Although they are mostly made of copper metal, samples have also been obtained with some iron mixed copper. The Mananka seems to have made the currency key by later stamping the melted copper in the current structure to make the currency.\n\nShape and format of Mr. Mannanak currency:\n\nThe basic structure of the Shri Mannaka Mudra has been greatly inspired by the shape of religious importance, such as the lion and lotus woman Shri Bhogini and other figures. The inclusion of the lion in the currency appears to symbolize the majestic symbol and Shri Bhogini as a goddess. From their in-depth observation, it can be seen that the shape and structure of these postures were very good. Since Mr. Mannanak Mudra has been in print for a long time, many types of samples have been obtained. There are many different types of fertilizers that can be a fertile area for researchers and historians, as well as for those who do research studies. Also, currency collectors seem to be able to collect and promote various types of Mananka currencies with little money.\n\nForerunner of Shri Mannadak Mudra:\n\nIn-depth study of the sample obtained till now, there are usually only four types but Shri Mananka Mudra can be distinguished in three major types.\n\nA) Type 1: Plain position in front of a raised lion.\n\nB) Second type: Flower in front of a lion raising a claw.\n\nC) Third type: scepter in front of a lion raising a glove.\n\nThe backdrop of Sri Mananka Mudra:\n\nAll the above types of currency are written on lotus women and Shri Bhogini. The woman is raising her right hand and holding her other hand in her waist. On the surface too, there is a slight difference in the value of Mr. Mannak.\n\nThe meaning of the word Bhogini:\n\nIn the study of ancient and old words, under Bhagatin, the meaning of the word Bhogini is inward, but they are the women of the special category of the king who is considered to be extremely intelligent, capable, honorable, helpful.\n\nRareness of Mannaka Currency:\n\nShri Mannak Mudra is probably found in sufficient quantity as it is being printed for a long time. But the type of scepter in front of a lion raising a third type of claw is rare. Then the second type is slightly more rare, but the first type is the most common and widely available currency. Since Mr. Mannanak currency was introduced a thousand four hundred years ago, our country is in a position to show its unique position before the world. Keeping this fact in mind, the government, universities and other stakeholders of Nepal should prioritize further study, research, preservation and dissemination.\n\n- Pro. Dr. Ramesh Shrestha"
