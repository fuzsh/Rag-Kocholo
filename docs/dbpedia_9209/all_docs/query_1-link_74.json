However, the first urban settlement in the country is believed to have come from the Indus Valley civilization a few thousand years ago. It was in the Bronze Age when the Dravidians settled in the region and made it their home. Later, Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans also arrived here.\n\nThis was the time when the country witnessed a rise in agriculture and the domestication of animals. Nepal has also been mentioned several times in the age-old Hindu texts such as the Upanishads. That is the reason it is popular for being a cultural, historical, and political center.\n\nLater, around 600 BCE, the country had become home to numerous small territories. This is also the period when Buddhism was founded and in subsequent years, Nepal became a land of spirituality. The Great Ashoka visited the country around 250 BCE and constructed numerous pillars and monuments.\n\nGradually, Nepal started making its mark on the global map. During the Medieval Period, numerous Hindu powers rose and ruled the country. By the 18th century, Nepal has become a strong center for trade, education, and history. Tourists started finding their ways to the country to explore its hidden charm and unseen beauties. However, after the 1950s, the country became a democratic republic due to the emergence of numerous movements and rallies.\n\nToday, Nepal is one of the most loved tourist destinations in the world and is visited by millions of tourists. It is extremely popular for its natural landscapes and the Himalayan belt. From the mighty Mount Everest to Pashupatinath Temple, travelers are in for a spell-binding experience here.\n\nBNepal has an amazing landscape patched with hills, the Himalayas, valleys, streams, grasslands, and more.

More than 6000 rivers are present in Nepal and most prominent ones of them are:\n\nKoshi\n\nGandaki\n\nKarnali\n\nTrishuli\n\nMahakali\n\nTamur\n\nArt and Music\n\nThe history of art in Nepal is quite old and the presence of stupas dating back to hundreds of years proves that. Though architecture in the country has mostly remained confined to Buddhist constructions and religious buildings, one cannot deny the fact that Nepal has witnessed a great change in the field of art since globalization. Today, hundreds of new art-forms are encouraged at dozens of art festivals organized every year.\n\nMusic in Nepal has evolved over a period. From the folk compositions of Dohori to the western-style beats on Nepalese music charts, a lot of things have changed. Today, people not only listen to Ghazals, classical music, bhajan, and Tamang Selo, they do enjoy rock, hip-hop, rap, metal and other genres. That's why the country hosts a number of music festivals every year where new talent comes up and rise to greater heights. Today, Nepalese music has become a mix of indigenous and western compositions.\n\nFood and Drink\n\nNepalese cuisine is unique in many ways, though it has been influenced by the kitchen practices of several other countries. One would find the equal use of vegetables as well as meat in Nepalese dishes. However, daal and rice, also called daal-bhat, is the most savored combination in the country. Momo, local style dumplings, has gained popularity across the world, especially in Asian countries and is eaten with great interest. Over a period, Nepalese food has created a loyal fan-base. Nepalese also love to enjoy drinks, along with savoring their favorite meals. Most of the famous drinks relished in the country are locally produced, be it beer, tea, or some other beverage. Tongba is the national drink of Nepal and is culturally as well as religiously significant. This alcoholic beverage is prepared from millet.\n\nHospitality\n\nNepal is one of the friendliest nations in Asia as it is the place where you would come across a happy, kind, and helpful crowd. Though the crowd in the country is conservative, tourists are never judged for their looks and beliefs. People here understand how to take good care of their guests.

Though Nepal allows most of the countries across the world to have either freedom of movement or visa on arrival, there are certain countries that require a valid visa prior to their visit.\n\nAs per the visa policy of Nepal, India is the only country that has complete freedom of movement to and from Nepal. Citizens of India can also reside in Nepal without any restrictions. All they need to have is either an Indian passport or voter ID card or any other registration certificate issued by the Government of India.\n\nBelow given is the list of the countries that need to apply for a regular tourist visa to enter the boundaries of Nepal: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Ghana, Iraq, Liberia, Nigeria, Palestine, Somalia, Syria and Zimbabwe Citizens of all the remaining countries are eligible to get Nepal visa on arrival for a maximum period of 90 days.\n\nFee for Nepal Visa on Arrival:\n\n15 days multiple entry = $30\n\n30 days multiple entry = $50\n\n90 days multiple entry = $125\n\nYou can apply for the Nepal Visa here.\n\nNotes:\n\nMembers of SAARC countries can apply for a tourist visa on arrival free of cost.\n\nCitizens of China, Macau and Hong Kong can also get their visa fee waived.\n\nBuses\n\nIf you desire to travel between different cities in Nepal, then you can opt for buses.

A bus ride within a city would cost a maximum of $1, while between cities a maximum of $8.\n\nHuman-pulled rickshaw\n\nIf you have time in your hand and are looking forward to exploring places at a slow pace, then human-pulled rickshaws would do a great thing. Get an unconventional experience as you ride these and move through age-old streets and squares of Nepal. A ride in these rickshaws wouldn't cost you more than $1\n\nAuto rickshaw\n\nAuto rickshaws are available at almost every major place in Nepal. However, they are much costlier in comparison to other modes of transport such as buses and human-pulled rickshaws. If you would love to save a few bucks and invest that amount into other experiences, then auto-rickshaws would be the best option to go with. Hire one for a day and cover all the major tourist destinations.\n\nTrains\n\nDue to irregular terrain, Nepal does not have a long rail network. The only two passenger trains in Nepal run between Janakpur and Jainagar & Raxaul and Sirsiya. Hence, trains are not a comfortable option for tourists in the country.\n\nCabs\n\nCabs are the fastest and most convenient means of transport in Nepal and that's the reason they are preferred by a majority of tourists. One can find cabs at all the major tourist places across all the prominent cities and towns. The prices for cab rides in Nepal are reasonable as they charge no more than $5 per short trip.\n\nVia Air Route\n\nTribhuvan International Airport located in the capital city of Kathmandu is the busiest and most prominent airport in Nepal. It is well connected to other parts of the world including the Middle East, the West, and the South. You can take direct flights from places like Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Delhi, Hong Kong, Kuwait, Muscat and more. Hence, it is the most preferred route amongst tourists.\n\nFrom the airport, you can either use cab services or other public transport such as a bus to reach your destination in the country.\n\nVia Rail Route\n\nNepal is only connected to India via the rail route. Several passenger trains run between Raxaul (India) and Sirsiya (Nepal). Though the route is not preferred by tourists, it surely would add to a wonderful experience. If you are coming from Bihar in India, then you can opt for the rail route.\n\nVia Road Route\n\nYou can also take a road route from India to reach Nepal as the country has quite a good network of roads. You can either drive on your own or hire a cab. You can also take a bus from places like Varanasi, Patna, Raxaul, Lucknow and Delhi to reach Nepal.\n\nVia Water Route\n\nBeing a landlocked country, Nepal does not have any water route\n\nTravel Tips\n\nHead towards places like Janakpur, Barun Valley and Rupa Taal to explore the untold beauties of the country.\n\nHiring a bicycle is the best way to explore the beauty of Nepal at your own pace.\n\nDo proper research about the weather conditions and seasonal changes in Nepal before booking your tickets.\n\nStay on the outskirts of Kathmandu to spend a peaceful vacation without any disturbance from the tourist crowd.\n\nNepalese currencies are not accepted elsewhere and hence, do exchange them before leaving the country.\n\nThough you would find marijuana everywhere across hills, do not assume for a second that it is legal in the country.
