However, international travellers can travel with USD, Euro, AUD, Canadian Dollars, Swiss Francs, Hongkong Dollars etc. in Nepal. There are many currency exchange counters in major cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara to exchange foreign currencies. Banks are better places for travellers to exchange currencies in Nepal as their exchange rate for foreign currency is slightly higher than money exchange counters located in Thamel and Pokhara. Even the foreign currencies are accepted in major cities in Nepal it is more convenient to exchange Nepali Rupees and use them.\n\nIf you plan trekking or any outdoor activities in Nepal, we strongly advise you to exchange your currency into Nepalese rupees before you start your trip out of the city. Some hotels located in the Himalayas still accept foreign currency but the exchange rate is not as good as in city and in the local market only Nepalese rupees are accepted. We can assist our customers in exchanging their foreign currency â€“ of course without charging additional fees."
