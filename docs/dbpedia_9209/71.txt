The Nepalese Rupee (NPR) is the official currency of Nepal, a landlocked country located in South Asia between India and China.

The modern Nepalese Rupee was introduced in 1932, replacing the silver mohar as the country’s official currency.

The Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal, is responsible for issuing and managing the Nepalese Rupee.

Subdivisions and Denominations

The Nepalese Rupee is subdivided into 100 smaller units called paisa.

Coins are issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 paisa, as well as 1, 2, 5, and 10 Nepalese Rupees.

Banknotes are available in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 Nepalese Rupees.

Exchange Rate System

The exchange rate of the Nepalese Rupee is pegged to the Indian Rupee (INR) under a fixed exchange rate system.

The Nepal Rastra Bank determines the exchange rate between the Nepalese Rupee and the Indian Rupee, and it may intervene in the foreign exchange market to maintain this peg.

The exchange rate with other currencies is determined by market forces and fluctuates according to changes in the value of the Indian Rupee.

The country faces several economic challenges, such as inadequate infrastructure, political instability, and vulnerability to natural disasters like earthquakes and landslides.

Nepal is also one of the poorest countries in the world, with a large portion of its population living below the poverty line.
