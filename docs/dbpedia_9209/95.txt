COIN MOHAR — WHERE & WHEN (coins catalog: by names & emitents)

KINGDOM OF NEPAL (1768-1932): mohar = 128 dam

Pay attention – mohur not mohar (other denomination of coins):

DURRANI EMPIRE /AFGHAN EMPIRE/ (1747-1823): mohur = 16 rupee

INDIA — including Mughal Empire, few princely states (Baroda, Jodhpur, Jaipur, Kutch...), British India (16th-20th centuries): mohur = 16 rupee

The name of the mohar coin comes from the Persian word, which translates as "seal", "to put a seal / mark". The analogue of this word in Sanskrit has exactly the same meaning.
