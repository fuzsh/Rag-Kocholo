        "text": "AL-MUKALLA: The Yemeni riyal fell to a new low of 1,540 against the dollar in Yemeni government-controlled territories on Saturday, bringing it closer to its all-time low of 1,700 per dollar.\n\nMoney traders and media reports said that the Yemeni riyal breached a record low of 1,500 against the dollar for the first time in years, compared to a prior low of 1,400 in July.\n\nSince early 2022, the Yemeni riyal has stabilized at about 1,200 per dollar in government-controlled areas, boosted by the formation of the internationally recognized Presidential Leadership Council, the return of the Yemeni government to Yemen’s interim capital of Aden, and Saudi Arabia’s injection of cash into Yemen’s Aden-based central bank.\n\nThe Yemeni riyal began depreciating in early 2013 in response to the Yemeni government’s repeated request for a financial bail-out after Houthi drone and missile attacks on oil installations depleted its financial reserves, as well as the impasse in peace talks to end the war in Yemen.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s $1.2 billion funding aid helped the Yemeni riyal to recover to 1,300 per dollar in early August, up from 1,400 in July.\n\nThe Yemeni riyal hit an all-time low of 1,700 per dollar in late 2021.\n\nPeople and local traders in government-controlled areas have reported an increase in the cost of fuel, transportation and vital products as a result of the riyal’s fast devaluation during the past few months.\n\nThe riyal’s new record low occurred just days after the central bank pledged to take all necessary measures to stabilize the economy and limit the depreciation of the national currency.\n\nIn a statement issued following a board meeting in Aden on Wednesday, the bank stated that it would not use “under any circumstances” inflationary financing to cover government expenses, urging the Yemeni government to effectively collect revenues and deposit them into the bank, address imbalances that drain resources and work on improving Yemenis’ standard of living and services.\n\nTo combat the riyal’s depreciation, the central bank closed unlicensed money firms, ordered local banks to send their financial statements to the bank, ordered the replacement of the unofficial remittance system between exchange companies, and organized public auctions for selling the dollar to local traders.\n\nThe official riyal exchange rate is 1,174. In early 2015, the riyal was trading at 215 per dollar.\n\nIn a recent report, the Yemeni government blamed the riyal’s depreciation and current economic meltdown on the Houthi military takeover of power in late 2014, their looting of central bank reserves, drone and missile attacks on oil facilities in Hadramout and, most recently, their ban on imports through government-controlled ports.\n\nThe government said in a report released last week that Yemen loses $5 billion in revenue annually as a result of the Houthi military coup and the subsequent war, and the country’s exports have decreased from $6.4 billion in 2014 to $1.7 billion last year.\n\nThe “deep” financial crisis in Yemen, according to the government report, caused a decrease in government investment programs, a reduction in private investment, a contraction of the GDP, the departure of foreign investors, the flight of local capital abroad in search of better opportunities, and the suspension of grant and loan programs.\n\nJERUSALEM: In a sign that mediators believe a Gaza ceasefire deal is imminent, a US official said Friday that Mideast negotiators are working out logistics for the potential release of hostages and distribution of aid as part of any agreement to end the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity in keeping with rules set by the White House, said the proposal currently on the table basically bridges every gap between Israel and Hamas and mediators were making preparations before a final deal is approved.\n\nIt was unclear what measures were being taken, but the official said a new “implementation cell” was being established in Cairo in advance. The cell would focus on logistics, including freeing hostages, providing humanitarian aid for Gaza and ensuring that the terms of the pact are met, the official said.\n\nThe comments came hours after mediators expressed hope that a deal was within reach. They said two days of talks had wrapped up in Qatar and that they plan to reconvene in Cairo next week to seal an agreement to stop the fighting.\n\nIsrael issued a vague statement saying it appreciated the mediators’ efforts, and a statement from Hamas did not sound enthusiastic about the latest proposal to end the devastating 10-month war and free Israeli hostages held in Gaza. A ceasefire is seen as the best hope for heading off an even larger regional conflict.\n\nUS President Joe Biden seemed optimistic, saying, “We are closer than we’ve ever been” to an agreement. Biden has expressed optimism for a deal before, only for talks to break down.\n\n“As of an hour ago, it’s still in play,” he said, as he was traveling to spend the weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat. “It’s far from over. Just a couple more issues, I think we got a shot.”\n\nBoth sides agreed in principle to the plan Biden announced on May 31. But Hamas has proposed amendments, and Israel has suggested clarifications, leading each side to accuse the other of trying to tank a deal.\n\nThe US official said the latest proposal is the same as Biden’s with some clarifications based on ongoing talks. The way it’s structured poses no risk to Israel’s security but enhances it, the official added.\n\nHamas has rejected Israel’s demands, which include a lasting military presence along the border with Egypt and a line bisecting Gaza where it would search Palestinians returning to their homes to root out militants.\n\nHamas quickly cast doubt on whether an agreement was near.\n\nIn a statement, the militant group said the latest proposal diverged significantly from the previous iteration they had agreed to in principle, implying they were not disposed to accept it.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister’s office issued a statement saying it “appreciates the efforts of the US and the mediators to dissuade Hamas from its refusal to a hostage release deal.”\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken planned to travel to Israel over the weekend to “continue intensive diplomatic efforts” toward a ceasefire and to underscore the need for all parties in the region to avoid escalation, State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said.\n\nBlinken was expected to meet with Netanyahu on Monday to discuss the new deal, said an Israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with official requirements.\n\nThe new push for an end to the Israel-Hamas war came as the Palestinian death toll in Gaza climbed past 40,000, according to Gaza health authorities, whose counts do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Fears were still high that Iran and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon would attack Israel in retaliation for the killings of top militant leaders.\n\nInternational mediators believe the best hope for calming tensions would be a deal between Israel and Hamas to halt the fighting and secure the release of Israeli hostages.\n\nInternational diplomacy to prevent the war from spreading intensified Friday, with the British and French foreign ministers making a joint trip to Israel.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a statement that he told his British and French counterparts that if Iran attacks Israel, Israel expects its allies not just to help it defend itself, but to join in attacking Iran.\n\nHe also warned Iran — which backs Hamas, Hezbollah and Houthi rebels in Yemen, all of whom have attacked Israel since the Gaza war started — to stop the attacks.\n\n“Iran is the head of the axis of evil, and the free world must stop it now before it’s too late,” Katz said on X.\n\nThe war began when Hamas-led militants stormed across the heavily guarded border on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 250 to Gaza. More than 100 were released during a weeklong ceasefire in November, and around 110 are believed to still be inside Gaza, though Israeli authorities believe around a third of them are dead.\n\nIsrael’s military spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said Thursday that Israel had killed more than 17,000 Hamas militants in Gaza in the war, without providing evidence.\n\nDiplomats hoped a ceasefire deal would persuade Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah to hold off on retaliating for the killing of a top Hezbollah commander in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut and of Hamas’ top political leader in an explosion in Tehran that was widely blamed on Israel.\n\nThe mediators have spent months trying to hammer out a three-phase plan in which Hamas would release the hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\n\nWhile talks were ongoing, Israel continued its offensive in Gaza.\n\nOn Friday it dropped leaflets asking civilians to evacuate from areas in northern Khan Younis and eastern Deir Al-Balah, saying forces plan to respond to rocket fire that targeted Israel. After the orders were given, airstrikes hit some areas of Khan Younis, sending people fleeing. A video showed plumes of black smoke rising into the air after loud booms.\n\nAlso Friday, Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi spoke to Biden and agreed to intensify joint efforts in the coming days to reach an agreement, said a spokesman for the presidency. El-Sisi also urged regional self-restraint.\n\nIn a clear message to Israel, Hezbollah released a video, with Hebrew and English subtitles, showing underground tunnels where trucks were transporting long-range missiles.\n\nA Hezbollah official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was speaking about military affairs, said the missiles in the video have a range of about 140 kilometers (86 miles), capable of reaching deep inside Israel.\n\nHezbollah has tens of thousands of rockets, missiles and drones that the group says give it the ability to hit anywhere in Israel. Hezbollah started attacking Israel on Oct. 8 and says it will stop only when the Gaza war ends.\n\nRAMALLAH, Palestinian Territories: Gaza has recorded its first polio case in 25 years, the Palestinian health ministry said on Friday, after UN chief Antonio Guterres called for pauses in the Israel-Hamas war to vaccinate hundreds of thousands of children.\n\nTests in Jordan confirmed the disease in an unvaccinated 10-month-old from the central Gaza Strip, the health ministry in Ramallah said.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, Gaza, now in its 11th month of war, has not registered a polio case for 25 years, although type 2 poliovirus was detected in samples collected from the territory’s wastewater in June.\n\n“Doctors suspected the presence of symptoms consistent with polio,” the health ministry said. “After conducting the necessary tests in the Jordanian capital, Amman, the infection was confirmed.”\n\nThe case emerged shortly after Guterres called for two seven-day breaks in the Gaza war to vaccinate more than 640,000 children.\n\nPoliovirus, most often spread through sewage and contaminated water, is highly infectious. It can cause deformities and paralysis, and is potentially fatal. It mainly affects children under the age of five.\n\nThe UN health and children’s agencies said they had made detailed plans to reach children across the besieged Palestinian territory and could start this month.\n\nBut that would require pauses in the 10-month old war between Israel and Hamas, they said.\n\n“Preventing and containing the spread of polio will take a massive, coordinated and urgent effort,” Guterres told reporters at UN headquarters in New York.\n\n“I am appealing to all parties to provide concrete assurances right away guaranteeing humanitarian pauses for the campaign.”\n\nThe World Health Organization and UN children’s fund UNICEF said they were planning two seven-day vaccination drives across the Gaza Strip, starting in late August, against type 2 poliovirus (cVDPV2).\n\nLast month, it was announced that type 2 poliovirus had been detected in samples collected in Gaza on June 23.\n\n“These pauses in fighting would allow children and families to safely reach health facilities and community outreach workers to get to children who cannot access health facilities for polio vaccination,” the agencies said in a statement said.\n\nAfter 25 years without polio, its re-emergence in the Gaza Strip would threaten neighboring countries, it added.\n\n“A ceasefire is the only way to ensure public health security in the Gaza Strip and the region.”\n\nDuring each round of the campaign, the health ministry in Gaza, alongside UN agencies, would provide “two drops of novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) to more than 640,000 children under 10 years of age.”\n\nMore than 1.6 million doses of nOPV2 were expected to transit through Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport “by the end of August,” the statement added.\n\nThe war was triggered by Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.\n\nOn Thursday, the toll from Israel’s retaliatory military campaign in Gaza passed 40,000, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and militant casualties.\n\nDOHA: Hamas said Friday it rejected “new conditions” in a Gaza ceasefire proposal that US-led mediators presented during two days of talks in Qatar.\n\nDiplomatic efforts have so far failed to alleviate the suffering endured over more than 10 months of war, but US President Joe Biden insisted after the latest round of talks that “we are closer than we have ever been.”\n\nHe is sending US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Israel this weekend to push the latest proposal, the State Department said.\n\nEgyptian, Qatari and US mediators have been seeking to finalize details of a framework initially outlined by Biden in May, which he said Israel had proposed.\n\nIn a joint statement, the mediators said they had presented both sides with a proposal that “bridges remaining gaps” and will continue working in the coming days to hash out the specifics on humanitarian provisions and the hostage-prisoners swap.\n\nTalks aiming to secure a rapid deal are set to resume in Cairo “before the end of next week.”\n\nHamas, which did not attend the Doha talks, swiftly announced its opposition to what it called “new conditions” from Israel in the latest plan.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on mediators to “pressure” Hamas to accept Biden’s framework.\n\nThreats by Iran and its proxies to attack Israel have added renewed urgency to the efforts to hammer out a Gaza ceasefire, with mediators seeking a deal in the hopes of dousing a wider regional conflict.\n\n“No one in the region should take actions to undermine this process,” Biden warned, later telling reporters, “There’s just a couple more issues, I think we’ve got a shot.”\n\nInternational pressure\n\nAn informed source told AFP Hamas had objected to conditions about keeping Israeli troops on Gaza’s border with Egypt and terms related to the release of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Israeli hostages.\n\nWestern ally Jordan, however, put the blame squarely on Netanyahu for blocking a deal, with Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi urging pressure “by everyone who wishes to see this through to completion.”\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Lammy and his French counterpart Stephane Sejourne held talks in Israel on Friday to press the deal.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told his visiting counterparts he expects foreign support if Iran seeks to avenge the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\nSejourne replied that it would be “inappropriate” to discuss responding to any attack while diplomacy to stop it from happening is in high gear.\n\nA senior US official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, said Iran would face “cataclysmic” consequences if it strikes Israel.\n\nA deadly attack by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank late Thursday drew international condemnation and calls for sanctions, including against government ministers, over the surge in settler violence against Palestinians since the Gaza war began.\n\nThe Israeli military said “dozens of Israeli civilians, some of them masked,” entered the village of Jit and “set fire to vehicles and structures in the area, hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails.” A Palestinian man was shot dead.\n\nThe West Bank-based Palestinian foreign ministry described the attack as “organized state terrorism.”\n\nThe European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said he would propose sanctions against Israeli government “enablers” of Jewish settler violence.\n\nIsraeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a proponent of West Bank settlements, was quick to join other Israeli leaders in condemning Thursday’s attack by “criminals.”\n\nOngoing fighting\n\nHamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead. More than 100 were freed during a one-week truce in November.\n\nOn Thursday, the toll from Israel’s retaliatory military campaign topped 40,000, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and militant casualties.\n\nThe war has devastated the besieged territory’s health care infrastructure, prompting repeated warnings from the World Health Organization about the risk of preventable diseases.\n\nOn Friday, the Palestinian health ministry reported an unvaccinated 10-month-old child in Gaza had been diagnosed with polio, the territory’s first case in 25 years, according to the WHO.\n\nThe announcement came hours after UN chief Antonio Guterres called for two seven-day breaks in the Gaza war to vaccinate more than 640,000 children against type 2 poliovirus, which was first detected in the territory’s wastewater in June.\n\nAs truce talks were underway, thousands of civilians were on the move again inside the Palestinian territory after the Israeli military issued fresh evacuation orders ahead of imminent military action.\n\nThe UN estimated the orders affect more than 170,000 people, forcing them to pack into the shrinking remnants of an area declared a humanitarian safe zone.\n\nThe area where people have been told to relocate to makes up just 11 percent of Gaza, according to the UN.\n\n“During each round of negotiations, they exert pressure by forcing evacuations and committing massacres,” Issa Murad, a Palestinian displaced to Deir Al-Balah, said of the Israeli forces."
