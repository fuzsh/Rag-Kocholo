It has led to 18.6 million out of the 32 million people in Yemen needing humanitarian assistance and internally displaced 4.5 million.\n\nOn 2 April 2022, the conflict parties agreed to an UN-mediated truce, which expired in the same year on 2 October. Despite the non-extension of the truce, relatively large-scale conflict has not resumed, slightly improving the humanitarian conditions in the country.\n\nYemen has historically been divided socially and politically along tribal, ethnic, ideological, and religious lines. The current conflict has furthered this fragmentation, and two main areas of political and economic control have emerged. The DFA controls most of the northern and central governorates, while the IRG and the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council control southern Yemen.\n\nYemen is also a transit and destination country on the East African migration route to Saudi Arabia and other neighbouring countries, with around 308,000 migrants with irregular status and 72,000 refugees and asylum seekers registered in 2023. Most of them require humanitarian and protection assistance.\n\n(OCHA 01/02/2024, MDP accessed 19/02/2024, CFR accessed 19/02/2024, UN 01/04/2022)\n\nThe conflict between the Internationally Recognized Government of Yemen (IRG) and the Sana’a-based de-facto authority (DFA) in the north of Yemen (also known as the Houthis) since 2015 has resulted in a severe humanitarian and economic crisis.
