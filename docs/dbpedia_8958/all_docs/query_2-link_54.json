These mechanisms narrow down to the exchange rate regime which applies to the currency. The currency of a given country can either be said to be free floating, fixed or a hybrid. A free floating currency operates in a laissez faire kind of a market. Here, the currency is left to respond to the market forces. It is allowed to fluctuate against other currencies in response to the demand and supply forces. However, there are instances where the central banks have to intervene in order to regulate the appreciation and depreciation of the currencies. In such a case, these systems are called managed float and they are different to the system where no intervention is done at all. In cases where there is no intervention, it is called free float (Tauline, 2008). In Yemen, The Yemeni riyal is the national currency of the Republic of Yemen. After the revolution of 26 September 1962, the Ministry of Treasury issued the Republican riyal, the first national currency in late 1963. In the south, after the revolution of October 14, 1963, the South Arabian Currency Authority was founded, Which put the Yemeni dinar to trade in April 1965 as the first national currency for the south of the country. The dinar and the riyal continued to trade together until 1996, when the dinar was withdrawn from circulation in March 1996. Since June 11, 1996, the riyal has become the only currency of Yemen (Bashiri, 2013). Exchange rate fluctuation is the change in value of one currency against another currency due to various economic factors. In simple sense, the value of one currency will be appreciated against another if the demand for that particular currency is higher (John Pradeep & Rajeesh Kunnampuram, 2002).\n\n13. 2 Changes in exchange rate have pervasive effects, with consequences for prices, wages, interest rates, production levels, and employment opportunities (Rogoff, 2009). The exchange rate can be affected by any political or economic disturbance and It is a reflection of the financial health of a country or region, some reasons is responsible for fluctuating in exchange rate for instance Inflation rates, interest rates, country’s balance of payments, government debt, political stability & performance, recession, and speculation ,all of these factors determine the foreign exchange rate fluctuations (compareremit, 2014). In Yemen, The exchange rate of the Yemeni Riyal against the US Dollar witnessed significantly high changes during the recent period. Economic pressures stemming from the three-year-old war and regional military intervention in Yemen have taken their toll on the value of the country’s currency. Between early 2015 and 2017. Amongst the factors weighing on the riyal have been widespread collapse of economic activity, government services, security and humanitarian conditions, the cessation of oil exports (previously the largest source of foreign currency and government revenue) and the Central Bank of Yemen’s (CBY) decreasing ability to intervene in the market, given its depleted foreign currency holdings. The CBY has also been experiencing a severe riyal liquidity crisis (Nasser, 2017). Aside from factors such as interest rates and inflation, the exchange rate is one of the most important determinants of a country's relative level of economic health. Exchange rates play a vital role in a country's level of trade. We should sketch out how exchange rate movements affect a nation's trading relationships with other nations. A higher currency makes a country's exports more expensive and imports cheaper in foreign markets. A lower currency makes a country's exports cheaper and its imports more expensive in foreign markets. A higher exchange rate can be expected to lower the country's balance of trade, while a lower exchange rate would increase it (Bergen, 2017).\n\n14. 3 1.2 Problem Statement The study is representing the Yemeni riyals exchange rate against the dollar is facing in these days huge problems in the current situations this leads to a rise in the prices of all the imported commodities and declining currency’s purchasing power, which is equal to the proportion of the depreciation of the riyals against the dollar. Despite the facts that others researches have not studied the fluctuating foreign exchange rate on Yemeni currency Thus it is important to conduct such research. 1.3 Research Questions In attempting to examine the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rate on Yemeni currency. This study aims to answer the following questions: i. What is the relationship between fluctuating foreign exchange rate and Yemeni currency? ii. How fluctuating foreign exchange rate affect Yemeni currency? 1.4 Research Objectives This study aims to examine the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rate on Yemeni currency and specifically achieving the following objectives. i. To identify the nature of the relationship between fluctuating foreign exchange rate and Yemeni currency. ii. To examine the effect of fluctuating foreign exchange rate on Yemeni currency. 1.5 Research Contribution The contribution of this study consists of theoretical and practical perspectives. This study contributes to the body of knowledge from theoretical point of view due to some reasons. This study investigates the effect of fluctuating foreign exchange rate on Yemeni currency and new researchers who come after this research will get the total benefits from these research. In addition, this study contributes to the practical perspectives through different ways The study will help exporters and importers alike investors and government to know the behavior of the exchange rate as it directly or indirectly affects them and These study\n\n15. 4 would identify those economic variables that are mostly affected by instability in exchange rate. 1.6 Limitations of the Study The scope of this research was limited to examining the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rate on Yemeni currency. The scope of study was limited and it has to be carried out in the Yemeni banks in Sana'a. In addition, this study was also faced with constraints of gathering information, due to the current situation, has not been able to access the branches of the Yemeni bank in other Yemeni cities. 1.7 Definition of Terms The following definitions describe the key terms that are adopted for this study: i. Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations Is the change in value of one currency against another currency due to various economic factors (John Pradeep & Rajeesh Kunnampuram, 2002). ii. Yemeni currency The Yemeni riyal is the national currency of the Republic of Yemen. After the revolution of 26 September 1962, the Ministry of Treasury issued the Republican riyal, the first national currency in late 1963 (Bashiri, 2013) . 1.8 Research Organizing This study constitutes a five chapter sequence: Chapter 1 discusses on the introduction of the study, it discusses the problem statement, research questions, and research objectives, indicates the research contribution and limitation of the study, defines the terms of the research, and finally indicates the research organizing plan. Chapter 2 discusses the introduction of the literature review for both fluctuating foreign exchange and Yemeni currency. It also explains the relationship between the fluctuating foreign exchange rate and Yemen currency, finally, it discusses research framework develop hypothesis, and summarize the overall chapter.\n\n16. 5 Chapter 3 discusses the research design, population and sample size, the instrumentation used to measure both fluctuating foreign exchange rate and Yemeni currency, data collection methods and administration, scale reliability, data analysis software, and finally summarizes the overall chapter. Chapter 4 discuss the overall data analysis that includes data screening, sample profile, and descriptive statists of fluctuating foreign exchange rate and Yemen currency.

Chapter 5 includes a simple introduction, the result discussion, recommendations, future research recommendations and finally the conclusion of the research.\n\n17. 6 CHAPTER TWO LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT 2.1 Introduction This chapter begins with the definitions of different researchers, importance, and the benefit of both variables The fluctuating foreign exchange rate and Yemeni currency. Also, determinants of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and Exchange Rate Regimes. Moreover, it will explain the factors of the study based on the previous studies that are related to this study. And it will include the previous studies on the relationship between The fluctuating foreign exchange rate and Yemeni currency. As well as, the research framework to examine that relationship between the two variables. In addition, it consists of the hypotheses development, which is based on the extant literature review and theoretical development, that will be discuss before the draw of the framework. Finally, it concludes with a summary that review what the chapter discussed. 2.2 Currency Currency is a generally accepted form of money, including coins and paper notes, which is issued by a government and circulated within an economy. Used as a medium of exchange for goods and services (Investopedia, 2016). National Currency is defined as the currency or legal tender issued by a nation's central bank or monetary authority. The national currency of a nation is usually the predominant currency used for most financial transactions in that country (Investopedia, 2016). The Yemeni riyal is the national currency of the Republic of Yemen. After the revolution of 26 September 1962, the Ministry of Treasury issued the Republican riyal, the first national currency in late 1963 (Bashiri, 2013).\n\n18. 7 2.2.1 The Importance Of Local Currency Enhance national pride and solidarity every country has its own currency. It represents the collective identity of a nation. The very existence of a national currency is a tremendous source of pride for all citizens. In addition, it Promote price stability is managed by adjusting money supply in the economy. As with any goods, an over- supply of money in circulation would diminish its value, leading to inflation. Similarly, an under-supply of money in circulation would increase its value, leading to deflation, and also Reduce transaction costs Using one national currency in all domestic economic transactions would help substantially reduce the costs for both buyers and sellers. In addition, the Local Currency Promote infrastructure & social welfare Greater use of the local currency can allow the government to better manage its budget to meet the needs of investments in infrastructure. Furthermore, Accumulate foreign reserves in a country where the national currency is exclusively used in the economy, foreign currencies that flow into the country must be converted into the national currency before conducting any domestic transactions. The role of the central bank is to absorb those foreign currencies in exchange for its national currency (InvestingAnswers , 2016). 2.2.2 The Benefits Of Local Currency The Local currency is often proposed as a way to revitalize local economies, insulate them from global market forces, and re-create community. Local currency offers several economic benefits: It encourages people to shop at local businesses since only they are willing to accept and use local currency. Also, It increases the local money supply, which increases demand and stimulates local production and employment. As well as, It keeps money within the community since it cannot be extracted to distant corporations. In addition, It facilitates the circulation of goods and services among people who may not have sufficient access to national currency but who may have time and skills to offer (Eisenstein, 2011).\n\n19. 8 2.2.3 Previous Studies On Currency Mohamed Al-Afandi, (2008) examined the economic and social impacts resulting from floating the Yemeni currency. The study found that policy of floating the currency coupled with some other policies has led to declining growth rates. Because of the increase in imports and the limited non-oil exports, demand for both imports and exports has been inelastic, thus causing a limited effect on the balance of trade and the balance of payments. Extremely high inflation rates during 1996-2007 have resulted in declining real wages and dropping living standards. It is a quantitative study. In another related study, (M.Loto, 2011) studied the effect of devaluation/depreciation of the Nigerian naira on the country’s trade balance for the period 1986 to 2008. The study adopts the elasticity approach to the balance of payments adjustment. The study investigates the effect of exchange rate devaluation as a policy on the Nigerian economy’s Trade for the period 1986 to 2008. This study relied on secondary source of data in a quantitative way. The data covered a period of twenty-five years starting from 1986 through 2008. The study concluded that devaluation/depreciation cannot improve the trade balance in the Nigerian economy. Devaluation/depreciation can only benefit countries that are originally export based before the devaluation /depreciation of a currency. Economies that are import dependent like Nigeria can hardly benefit from the devaluation/depreciation of its currency. 2.3 Fluctuating Foreign Exchange Rate The exchange rate reflects the number of units of the national currency that can be exchanged for one unit of foreign currency or is the number of units that must be paid from a particular currency for a unit of another currency (Osama Al-Fouli, 2006), it is the price at which one country’s currency exchanges for another country’s currency. The exchange rate plays a pivotal role in determining the price of a nation’s product in the rest of the world and domestic price of goods imported from abroad (Thomas, 2006). In other words, the Exchange rate can be defined as the amount of one currency you can exchange for other currencies (Amadeo, 2017).\n\n20. 9 Exchange rate fluctuation is defined as the risk related to unexpected movements in exchange rates. Macroeconomic variables such as interest rates, inflation, the balance of payments, tax rates, imports, exports, gross domestic product (GDP) and the money supply is the random effect of exchange rates. The unstable of macroeconomic variables depend on the current economic situation in their country (Wan Abdoh, 2016). Also, Exchange rate fluctuation refers to the extent to which prices of currencies tend to fluctuate over time (Cote, 2005). 2.3.1 Importance Of The Exchange Rate The importance of the exchange rate differs from country to country. Generally, for closed economies, its importance is less. For small, open economies, however, the exchange rate is very important as it affects the prices of exports as well as imports. While a country’s exports depend on the purchasing power of the rest of the world and the price competition of the goods and services it exports, its imports are dependent on the income and spending power of its residents and the competitiveness with imported products in relation to domestically produced goods and services. A trade deficit, which results from an excess of imports over exports, tends to bring downward pressure on the domestic currency (depreciation of the exchange rate). Since the exchange rate determines the value of foreign goods, services and financial assets that can be purchased with domestic currency, if the domestic currency depreciates against other currencies, imports become more expensive in terms of domestic currency. Whereas the higher import prices in terms of domestic currency will reduce the purchasing power of domestic consumers, domestic producers will benefit from becoming more competitive against imports, both in domestic and export markets. This would lead to the substitution of imports through increased domestic production. The higher demand for domestic goods and services to be used for producing goods to be exported would increase the domestic prices. This way, the exchange rate serves to allocate resources between those goods and services that can be traded internationally and those that are sold only in the domestic market. In addition to the trade balance and inflation, exchange rates also influence foreign investments as investors decide on the composition of their investment portfolios based on the prevailing as well as expected exchange and interest rates. Exchange rates also affect a range of other factors ranging from worker remittances to the reserve position of a country. The value of a country’s exchange rate also depends on both, domestic and foreign monetary conditions. An\n\n21. 10 unexpected increase in domestic interest rates, for example, could attract capital inflows and would lead to an appreciation of the domestic currency in the foreign exchange market of an open economy (Central Bank of Sri Lanka, 2006). 2.3.2 Advantages Of Exchange Rate Systems Advantages of fixed exchange rates: Certainty: with a fixed exchange rate, firms will always know the exchange rate and this makes trade and investment less risky. Also, The absence of speculation: with a fixed exchange rate, there will be no speculation if people believe that the rate will stay fixed with no revaluation or devaluation. In addition, Constraint on government policy: if the exchange rate is fixed, then the government may be unable to pursue extreme or irresponsible macroeconomic policies as these would cause a run on the foreign exchange reserves and this would be unsustainable in the medium-term. Advantages of floating exchange rates: Protection from external shocks: if the exchange rate is free to float, then it can change in response to external shocks like oil price rises. Also, Lack of policy constraints: the government is free with a floating exchange rate system to pursue the policies they feel are appropriate for the domestic economy without worrying about them conflicting with their external policy. In addition, Correction of the balance of payments deficits: a floating exchange rate can depreciate to compensate for a balance of payments deficit. This will help restore the competitiveness of exports (International Economics, 2015). 2.3.3 Main causes that Affect Foreign Exchange Rates Inflation Rates: Changes in market inflation cause changes in currency exchange rates. A country with a lower inflation rate than another's will see an appreciation in the value of its currency. The prices of goods and services increase at a slower rate where the inflation is low. A country with a consistently lower inflation rate exhibits a rising currency value while a country with higher inflation typically sees depreciation in its currency and is usually accompanied by higher interest rates. Also, Interest Rates: Changes in interest rate affect currency value and dollar exchange rate. Forex rates, interest rates, and inflation are all correlated. Increases in interest rates cause a country's currency to appreciate because higher interest rates provide higher rates to lenders,\n\n22. 11 thereby attracting more foreign capital, which causes a rise in exchange rates. Furthermore, Country’s Balance of Payments: a country’s current account reflects the balance of trade and earnings on foreign investment. It consists of total number of transactions including its exports, imports, debt, etc. A deficit in the current account due to spending more of its currency on importing products than it is earning through the sale of exports causes depreciation. The Balance of payments fluctuates exchange rate of its domestic currency. Moreover, Terms of Trade: Related to current accounts and balance of payments, the terms of trade are the ratio of export prices to import prices. A country's terms of trade improve if its exports prices rise at a greater rate than its imports prices. This results in higher revenue, which causes a higher demand for the country's currency and an increase in its currency's value. This results in an appreciation of exchange rate. In addition, Political Stability & Performance: a country's political state and economic performance can affect its currency strength. A country with less risk for political turmoil is more attractive to foreign investors, as a result, drawing investment away from other countries with more political and economic stability. Increase in foreign capital, in turn, leads to an appreciation in the value of its domestic currency. A country with sound financial and trade policy does not give any room for uncertainty in the value of its currency. But, a country prone to political confusions may see a depreciation in exchange rates. Finally the Speculation: If a country's currency value is expected to rise, investors will demand more of that currency in order to make a profit in the near future. As a result, the value of the currency will rise due to the increase in demand. With this increase in currency value comes a rise in the exchange rate as well (compareremit, 2014). 2.3.4 Exchange Rate Regimes Countries have a wide scale of exchange rate regimes to choose from, ranging from fixed (conventional peg) to freely floating exchange rate. The regime type a country chooses should depend on the current economic situation, size of the economy, the types of exchange rates other countries are using, and the long-term economic policy goal. For example, price stability with trade partners is crucial for an open economy that has a large portion of its gross domestic product (GDP) dependent on exports. Therefore, this country will be less likely to adopt a freely floating exchange rate where price volatility is potentially high and can discourage international trade. According to the International Monetary Fund classification, exchange rate arrangements can be\n\n23. 12 classified into four categories: hard pegs or fixed regimes (such as currency board arrangements), soft pegs or intermediate regimes (such as crawling pegs, stabilized arrangements, and craw-like arrangements), floating regimes (such as managed floating and free floating), and residuals (IMF, 2013). Under fixed exchange rate, the local currency is either pegged against another currency or a basket of other currencies. The main goal of this system is to achieve stability in the value of currency through fixing it against a stronger and more stable currency (or currencies). The main advantage of this system is that the currency does not fluctuate according to market conditions, and therefore creates a stable and predictable business climate for investments and trade between the two currencies. However, the main drawback of pegged exchange rates is that it is very difficult for government to conduct independent monetary policy and to liberalize capital markets at the same time (Thirlwall, 2003). For instance, capital outflows will result in currency depreciation. In order to tackle this, the central bank needs to raise domestic interest rates, which eventually depresses the domestic economy. The reverse situation occurs with capital inflows. Therefore, the only way for an economy to maintain domestic and external equilibrium is either to control capital movements or to allow the exchange rate to float. Within flexible exchange rate regime, the value of the currency is allowed to fluctuate based on the supply and demand of that particular currency in the exchange market. One of the advantages of floating regime is the automatic adjustment of balance of payments, whose deficit or surplus is corrected by appreciation or depreciation of the currency (Ghosh & Wolf, 2002). The main disadvantage of this system is the stability factor. The Exchange rate can appreciate wildly and therefore be disruptive for tradable goods sector. When the currency depreciates, it can lead to extreme inflation by raising the domestic price of imports. Therefore, many countries that adopt floating exchange rate practice managed floating by intervening in some level in order to maintain their macroeconomic stability and minimize volatility impact. In reality, the implementations of exchange rate regimes are not always about choosing the other end of the spectrum. Most countries adopt a variety of combinations of both fixed and floating regimes, which are called intermediate regimes. One type of intermediate regimes is the crawling peg, where a currency value is allowed to fluctuate within a certain limit (Jakob, 2016).\n\n24. 13 2.3.5 Previous Studies On Fluctuating Foreign Exchange Rate (Zakari, 2017), investigated the relationship between foreign exchange rate and foreign direct investment in Nigeria, this is important in view of the recent and past devaluation of Nigeria currency as well as the exchange rate changes over the years to be precise 26 years coverage 1990-2015. This underscores the need to assess how foreign investors through foreign direct investment respond to changes in the exchange rate. This study relied on secondary data and time series. Data were collected from the website of Central Bank of Nigeria in a quantitative way for the period under review and analyzed using regression and correlation analysis techniques. Findings from the analysis show that there is a strong positive relationship between foreign direct investment and exchange rate in Nigeria. The study also found that there was a significant inflow of FDI from 2005-2014 due to rise in the exchange rate in the same period. The study concludes that exchange rate and foreign direct investment are positively correlated. Moreover, (Ogundipe, 2013) examined the impact of exchange rate volatility on consumer prices in Nigeria. The study adopts a Structural Vector autoregressive to estimate the pass-through effect of exchange rate changes to consumer prices. Using the Variance Decomposition analyses. In this research, secondary data was collected from Central Bank of Kenya. The study found a substantially large exchange rate pass- through to inflation in Nigeria. The Finding shows that exchange rate has been more important in explaining Nigeria’s rising inflation phenomenon than the actual money supply. Therefore, it is recommended that Nigerian economy focus on policies that ensure exchange rate stability and sound monetary surveillance. 2.4 previous studies on the relationship between fluctuating foreign exchange rate and currency: (Danson Musyoki, 2012) have done an investigation to found out the link between the exchange rate volatility on economic growth in Kenyan. The study examined the impact of real exchange rate volatility on economic growth in Kenyan. The study employed the Generalized Autoregressive Condition of Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) and computation of the unconditional standard deviation of the changes to measure volatility and Generalized Method Moments (GMM) to assess the impact of the real exchange\n\n25. 14 rate volatility on economic growth for the period January 1993 to December 2009. The main type of data used in this study is secondary that collected from Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, Central Bank of Kenya and International Monetary Fund Data Base by taking monthly frequency. And the Research Methodology of This study is quantitative. The study found that real effective exchange rate was very volatility for the entire study period. Kenya’s The real exchange rate generally exhibited an appreciating and volatility trend, implying that in general, the country’s international competitiveness deteriorated over the study period. The real exchange rate Volatility reflected a negative impact on economic growth and which has a great impact on the local currency of Kenya. 2.5 Research Framework The purpose of the development of the research framework is to examine the relationships between fluctuating foreign exchange rate and Yemeni currency. The theoretical framework proposed in this study comprised of independent variables namely fluctuating foreign exchange rate. Yemeni currency is considered as a dependent variable in the theoretical framework as illustrated in figure 2.1. IV DV Figure 2.1 Theoretical framework 2.6 Hypotheses Development Based on the extant literature review and theoretical development discussed in previous sections, a number of hypotheses have been developed to answer the two identified research questions. H1: Fluctuating foreign exchange rate has a relationship with Yemeni currency. H2: Fluctuating foreign exchange rate has a significant effect on Yemeni currency. Fluctuating Foreign Exchange Rate Yemeni currency\n\n26. 15 2.7 Summary This chapter discussed the literature review of Fluctuating foreign exchange rate and Yemeni currency with previous studies. In addition, this chapter discussed the development of the theoretical framework and research hypotheses based on research questions.\n\n27. 16 CHAPTER THREE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 3.1 Introduction This chapter presents the study design and methodology used in gathering information needed for the purpose of completing the study. This chapter describes the purpose, type and the type of investigation of this study. As well as, This chapter involves a blueprint for the collection, measurement, and analysis of data. Also, in this chapter describes the target population, sampling design, and data collection instrument and procedures. Additionally, it contains all the questions that are used to measure the two variables of this study. Finally, The chapter will be concluded by an exposition of the different statistical techniques used in the analysis. 3.2 Research Design Research design can be thought of as the logic or master plan of a research that throws light on how the study is to be conducted. It shows how all of the major parts of the research study– the samples or groups, measures, treatments or programs and many more. Work together in an attempt to address the research questions. A research design is the arrangement of conditions for data collection and analysis of data in a manner that aims to combine relevance to research purpose with economy in research procedure. (Chomba, 2012). According to Leedy&Ormrod (2005), a research design is a comprehensive plan that involves highlighting all the methods that will be utilized in the collection and analysis of data. The research design is also in line with the research objectives and study questions. Moreover, Research design is the plan and structure of investigation so conceived as to obtain answers to research questions. The plan is the overall scheme or program of the research (Robson, 2002).\n\n28. 17 3.2.1 Research Approach There are two prominent research approaches, Qualitative research and Quantitative research. Qualitative research methods normally entail reasoning from induction, gathering data and drawing conclusions from a multiplicity of interpretations and perceptions, beginning with observation, rather than a single, objective truth or rationality (Neuman, 1997). Qualitative research tends to focus on the collection of detailed amounts of primary data from relatively small samples of subjects by asking questions or observing behaviors (Hair et al.,2003).Quantitative approaches are generally based on the logic of deduction, beginning from accepted theories or premises and testing them rationally. Science in quantitative approaches is associated with objective truth, while qualitative research tends to focus on subjective experience (Neuman,1997). Quantitative research places heavy emphasis on using formalized standard questions and predetermined response options in the questionnaires or surveys administered to large number of respondents. Quantitative research methods are directly related to descriptive research designs than to exploratory designs (Hair et al.,2003). Quantitative research methods, on the other hand, involves the measurement of concepts using scales that either directly or indirectly provide numerical data ,These numerical data are then analyzed using mathematical procedures. These procedures can be extremely simple, such as percentages, or more complicated, such as statistical models or hypothesis testing using sophisticated software. Moreover, quantitative research methods enable researchers to determine the generalizability of the data collected from the sample to the population. To achieve this, quantitative methods rely on the use of fairly large samples collected through questionnaires or structured interviews (Zikmund & Griffin ,2010). Table 3.1: Key differences between qualitative and quantitative research. Selected Criteria Qualitative Quantitative Conceptual Concerned with understanding human behavior from the informant’s perspective. Concerned with discovering facts about social phenomena. Assumes a dynamic and negotiated reality Assumes a fixed and measurable reality. Methodologic al Data are collected through participant observation and interviews. Data collected through measuring things. Source: (McLeod, 2008)\n\n29. 18 Therefore, In this study mainly quantitative research method is used that focuses on responded to research questions requiring numerical data, accentuate target estimations and the factual, scientific, or numerical examination of information gathered through surveys, polls, and reviews or by controlling prior measurable information utilizing computational methods. 3.2.2 Purpose of The Study Research purposes may be grouped into three categories, which are exploratory, descriptive, and hypothesis testing. First, it is the exploratory research According to Polit et al (2001) explorative studies are undertaken when a new area is being investigated or when little is known about an area of interest. It is used to investigate the full nature of the phenomenon and other factors related to it. Second, it is the descriptive research According to Burns & Grove (2003) descriptive research “is designed to provide a picture of a situation as it naturally happens. It may be used to justify current practice and make judgment and also to develop theories. The main aim of descriptive research is to provide an accurate and valid representation of (encapsulate) the factors or variables that pertain / are relevant to the research question. The third type is Hypothesis testing is about testing to see whether the stated hypothesis is acceptable or not. During our hypothesis testing, we want to gather as much data as we can so that we can prove our hypothesis one way or another. The purpose of this study, hypothesis testing since it developed the theoretical framework and the hypotheses. 3.2.3 Type of Investigation We can find two types of investigations in the literature: Causal study and correlational study. Finding out the relationship among variables in the descriptive research process is labeled as correlation study which, according to Cooper and Schindler (2003), is a subset of descriptive study. A correlational study is conducted in the natural environment of the organization with minimum interference by the researcher with the normal flow of work (Sekaran, 2003). Also, Bold (2001) noted that the purpose of a correlational study is to establish whether two or more variables are related. Causal study is in which researcher wants to delineate the cause of one or more problems. In studies conducted to establish cause-and-effect relationships, the researcher tries to manipulate certain variables so as to study the effects of such\n\n30. 19 manipulation on the dependent variable of interest (Sekaran, 2003). In the causal research, the researcher examines how the independent variables are affected by the dependent variables and involves cause and effect relationships between the variables (Williams, 2007). In this regard, this study is a correlation type of investigation as we examine the relationship among variables. 3.2.4 Extent of Researcher Interference The extent of interference by the researcher with the normal flow of work at the workplace has a direct effect on whether the study performed is causal or correlational. A correlational study is carried out in the natural environment of the corporation with minimal interference by the researcher with the normal flow of work. In studies carried out to determine cause-and-effect relationships, the investigator attempts to adjust specific variables in order to study the outcomes of such manipulation on the dependent variable of interest. Put simply, the researcher intentionally changes certain variables in the setting and disrupts the events as they normally happen in the business (Jodie, 2015). Since, The Extent of researcher interference in this study minimum level of Interference by Researcher because the purpose is Hypothesis Testing. 3.2.5 Study Setting There are two type of Study setting is classified to contrived which is taking under the artificial setting, and the non-contrived study taken under the natural environment where work proceeds normally. According to the above the setting of this study is under the natural environment, thus this study is a non-contrived study. 3.3 Population and Sampling According to John W (2007), A population is any group of individuals who have one or more characteristics in common that are of interest to the researcher. The population may be all the individuals of a particular type or a more restricted part of that group. It is difficult to get responses from the whole population therefore; you have to determine a specific respondents that called a sample. According to Salaria (2012), a sample is a group chosen from a larger population with the aim of yielding information about this population as a whole is termed as sample. It is a miniature picture of the entire group or aggregate from which it has been taken. It is a smaller representation of\n\n31. 20 a larger whole. A good sample not only needs to be representative, it needs also to be adequate or of sufficient size to allow confidence in the stability of its characteristics. Fred N. Kerlinger (2007), states that sampling is taking any portion of a population or universe as representative of that population or universe. 3.3.1 Population The present study was carried out on the banking sector and more specifically on employees of commercial and Islamic banks of Yemen also, central bank. The targeted population for this study was banks operating in Sana'a. Five commercial, Islamic banks and central bank were considered. Table 3.2 includes the targeted banks. Table 3.2: The Targeted Banks Name Of Bank Number Of Employees Central Bank 700 Yemen Kuwait Bank 270 Cac Bank 2000 Saba Islamic Bank 350 International Bank Of Yemen 800 Total 4120 3.3.2 Sample Size According to kinra (2006) theories a typical range of sample size used by most researchers was 150-300. This research tends to choose a sample size of 180. This study will distribute the questionnaire base on the stratified sampling as well as the random distribution based on the sample random method. 3.4 Instrumentation The instrument used in the present study was personally administered questionnaire because of conducting primary research and questionnaire is most effective tool for this type of research (Sekaran, 2010). A questionnaire is a form containing a set of questions, especially addressed to a statistically significant number of subjects, and is a way of gathering information for a survey. It is used to collect statistical information or opinions about people. The oxford advanced learner‘s dictionary (1997) defines a\n\n32. 21 questionnaire as a written or printed list of questions to be answered by a number of people, especially as part of a survey. Therefore, the content of the questionnaire developed for this study consist of three sections. The first section contains the demographic data of the respondents. The second section contains questions that are pertaining the Yemeni currency. The third section contains questions that are pertaining the fluctuating foreign exchange rate. All the questions under this questionnaire will use the Five Likert Scale as shown in table 3.3. Table 3.3 Five Likert Scale Strongly disagree Disagree undecided agree Strongly agree 1 2 3 4 5 Source: (Podio help Center, 2016)\n\n33. 22 3.4.1 Yemeni Currency Measurement The study contains of seven questions established to study the Yemeni Currency. For the reason of completing this study, the questions will be adapted by the researcher. Table 3.4 shows the questions that measure Yemeni Currency. Table 3.4: Yemeni Currency Measurement No. Question 1 Exchange rate system imposed by central bank has an important role in reducing the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates. 2 Importing a lot participate in exporting more foreign currency to other countries. 3 Lack of foreign investments coming to Yemen participate in declining foreign exchange currencies. 4 Exchange rates affect directly in the Yemeni economy. 5 One of the most important means that affect the exchange rate are changes in currency supply and demand. 6 If a country is running very large budget deficits, a decrease in the value of its exchange rate will follow. 7 Exchange rates are affected by balance of trade deficits 3.4.2 Fluctuating Foreign Exchange Rate Measurement The study contains of seven questions established to study the Fluctuating Foreign Exchange Rate . For the reason of completing this study, the questions will be adapted by the researcher. Table 3.5 shows the questions that measure Fluctuating Foreign Exchange Rate. Table 3.5: Fluctuating Foreign Exchange Rate Measurement No. Question 1 Yemeni currency is facing deficits, because of the foreign exchange policy of central bank. 2 The exchange rate has experienced extreme fluctuations. 3 The sharp decline in the CBY’s foreign reserves has weakened the national\n\n34. 23 economy, thereby shaking customers’ confidence in the national currency. 4 Decline in the CBY’s total foreign reserves brings about wide fluctuations in exchange rates. 5 The continuing fall of the Rial against other currencies is attributed to lack of exports primarily. 6 Amongst the factors weighing on the rial have been widespread collapse of economic activity, and the cessation of oil exports. 7 Political-conflicts, especially armed ones, are almost inevitable indicators of many economic turmoil, one of them is currency deterioration. 3.5 Data Collection Sources of data are broadly classified in two categories, primary and secondary. According to parasuraman (2004), primary data are the information collected for the first time to bring about any explicit needs of a particular research. Require of primary data collection entail a range of diverse means. They are, personal or emails based survey questionnaires, face to face or telephone interviews, observations and focus groups (ghauri & gronhaug, 2005). While the secondary data is detailed information accessed by the researcher through other available sources of information to obtain thorough literature review. In fact, most of the studies begin in that fashion (kanikapati, 2007). The secondary source of data is very easy to extract and available in plenty through, books, magazines, journals, articles, and websites. In this study, a combination of both sets of data are used achieve maximum results. Therefore, the data collection of this research considered as primary and secondary data.in secondary data have been utilized to explore literature on this study and majority of the data pertaining to study have been collected through books, journals, websites, and articles. In data primary have been utilized the questionnaires method. Data was taken from employees of banks a self-administered questionnaire survey.\n\n35. 24 3.5.1 Instrumentation Translation These instruments were translated into the Arabic language for the convenience of participants. The whole questionnaire containing all the scale items were translated into the Arabic language for better understanding of the respondents to get the exact response from the banking employees. By the experts who are fluent in both English and Arabic, at the College of Languages and Translation at Sana'a University at Sana'a, Yemen. 3.5.2 Administration of Questionnaire Different ways to distributing the questionnaire such as self-administered questionnaire, using mail and personally handed. The self-administered questionnaire is a type of questionnaire, either in paper or in an electronic form that a respondent completes on his/her own. It enables the researchers to reach a large number of potential respondents in a variety of locations, especially when utilizing mail-in responses or online questionnaires. However, the response rate for self-administered surveys is relatively low, compared to other methods such as interviews or researcher-administered questionnaires (LLC, 2016). Mail surveys are a quantitative marketing research data collection method in which the respondent completes the questionnaires on paper and returns them via mail (research-methods, 2013).Group administered questionnaire (personally handed), a sample of respondents are brought together and asked to respond to a structured sequence of questions. Traditional, questionnaires were administered in group settings for convenience. The researcher could give the questionnaire to those who were present and be fairly sure that there would be a high response rate. If the respondents were unclear about the meaning of a question they could ask for clarification. And, there were often organizational settings where it was relatively easy to assemble the group in a company (M.K, 2006).Since, this study the distribution of the questionnaire was personally handed.\n\n36. 25 3.6 Scale Reliability For define the scale reliability, the questionnaire has been tasted using Cronbach's Alpha to confirm the internal consistency. Table 3.6 shows the results of Cronbach's Alpha test to all the questions of the questionnaire. Table 3.6: Reliability Statistics Cronbach's Alpha No. of Items .778 14 3.7 Data Analysis SPSS was used for data analysis. Data related to studied variables were coded and entered to the computer using SPSS software as it was most widely available and powerful statistical software package. SPSS is user friendly and cost effective for quantitative research in social sciences (Prabhakar, 2008). After data has been entered, it can be analyzed using Frequency Analysis, Descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, simple or multiple regression. Frequency analysis is used to answer the first research question. Frequency analysis is a descriptive statistical method that shows the number of occurrences of each response chosen by the respondents. When using frequency analysis, SPSS Statistics can also calculate the mean, median and mode to help users analyze the results and draw conclusions (winter,2016). Descriptive analysis these types of basic statistical analyses attempt to quantify the main features of a collection of data and can be used on data from both qualitative and quantitative studies. Correlation analysis is used to shows the relationship among different variables. Regression analysis is a statistical method of estimating the Relationship between a continuous dependent variable and one or more continuous Independent or predictor variables (Allison, 1999).\n\n37. 26 3.8 Summary This chapter has focused on the research methodologies, research approaches, Research purposes, and types of investigations that was adopted in the study. Including procedures, participants, data collection tools, data collection and analysis methods, and data credibility issues. At long last, the section was finished by showing the measurable investigation strategies utilized as a part of this study.\n\n38. 27 CHAPTER FOUR Data Analysis 4.1 Introduction After completing chapter three that described the research methodology and how the data was collected, this chapter is going to show the data analysis, which was obtained from the quantitative research method using questionnaire that was distributed to certain banks in Yemen, Moreover this chapter will describe the correlation relationship and linear regression between all variables and present the results of hypothesis testing typically the effect of independent variable which is fluctuating foreign exchange rate on the dependent variable which is Yemeni currency by using an analytical methodology manner. Accordingly, the data obtained from the research is be analyzed and represented in tables, graphs and accompanied with clarified text using SPSS software. Finally, after testing the hypothesis, the research will come up with a result either to support or reject the developed hypothesis. 4.2 Data Screening Before conducting any analyses, The data was screened for any errors in coding. Frequency test in SPSS version 21.0 was used in order to do this process. The results of this test showed that there were no errors in data entry and there was no extreme minimum or maximum value going above the range and the mean was also within the specified range. As well as, by applying a missing value analysis offered by SPSS 21.0 software, the results found that all cases were valid (180 cases) and no missing data. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data was clean and ready be tested and analyzed.\n\n39. 28 4.3 Sample Profile The targeted population was to (Managers and Employees), in five banks in sanaa which are, (Central Bank of Yemen , CAC BANK, YKB, International Bank Of Yemen and Saba Islamic Bank). The research questionnaire was distributed to 180 employees. The total surveys received for the current research was 148 and they were valid. Therefore, the overall response rate of 82% percent was obtained. In addition, the characteristics of the respondents are outlined in this section which is the gender, age. Education, position, and experience. So these demographic data were analyzed by using frequency tables and figures as follow. 4.3.1 Gender Table 4.1 and Figure 4.1 below show that most of the members of the sample group was male with (84.5%) and (15.5%) female. Gender is quite frequently a distinguishing segmentation variables. (84.5%) which is 125 respondents out of 148 respondents are males, on the other hand (15.5%) which is 23 female respondents out of 148 respondents.

Table 4.9 clarifies the correlation matrix between the two variables. It indicated that fluctuating foreign exchange rate was correlated with Yemeni currency (r = .479, p < 0.05, 2-tailed). The Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) for the relationship between the fluctuating foreign exchange rate and Yemeni currency was shown to be r = .479 with a p value of .000 , which is well below the conventional threshold of p ≤ .05. Therefore, there is a significant relationship between fluctuating foreign exchange rate and Yemeni currency. Table 4.9: Correlation Analysis iv Dv Iv Pearson Correlation 1 .479** Sig.

Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed). 4.6 Regression Analysis The regression analysis is about determining the shape of the correlation between variables, either positive or negative relationship. Therefore, the simple linear regression is used to study the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent for purpose of the value prediction of dependent variable by depending on the values of independent variables. So, in this research, Multiple regression analysis was used to test the hypothesis for direct effect between the (independent variables) fluctuating foreign exchange rate on Yemeni currency (dependent variable).Table 4.10 indicates that the R square is (.230) which means that (23%) of the dependent variable which is Yemeni currency can be explained or predicted by the independent variable which is fluctuating foreign exchange rate.\n\n48. 37 According to the R square value, the percentage of the influence in this research is (23%) that describe low influence by the fluctuating foreign exchange rate on the Yemeni currency and these is mean there are still have other variables that not mention in the research.

The respondent characteristics had varied from male and females with different age, level of education, position in the organization, and years of experience. Also, this chapter presented a descriptive statistics for each variable where varieties mean and standard variation had discussed. In addition, personal correlation analysis was used to indicate the significance of independent variable on dependent variable. Furthermore, liner regression was used in order to indicate whether the research hypothesis are supported or not.\n\n50. 39 CHAPTER FIVE DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 5.1 Introduction This study attempts to examine the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rate on Yemeni currency. Two hypotheses have been developed assuming that there is a relationship between fluctuating foreign exchange rate and Yemeni currency and the Yemeni currency affected on fluctuating foreign exchange rate. After analyzing the data using the SPSS software, the results have supported the hypotheses as well as the previous studies done on the subject. Therefore, this chapter will discuss the results and will give some recommendations and future research to broaden the understanding of the current state of knowledge on Yemeni currency and fluctuating foreign exchange rate. 5.2 Discussion This research’s investigation resulted in proving the existence of a significant relationship between the fluctuating foreign exchange rate and the Yemeni currency, as the independent variable (fluctuating foreign exchange rate) and the dependent variable (The Yemeni currency) are correlated as (r = .479) at the significance level of (0.01). And the results from multiple regression analysis indicated that fluctuating foreign exchange rate has a Significant effect on Yemeni currency (Beta= .479, p=.000<0.05), which support the two hypotheses of this study, and which also answer the research questions. Finally, the results of this study supported the results in the literature review. According to the result discussed in chapter four, it supports the result that was proved by Danson Musyoki in 2012 The exchange rate Fluctuations reflected a negative impact on economic growth and which has a great impact on the local currency of Kenya.\n\n51. 40 5.3 Recommendations Based on the findings, therefore the following recommendations were made. Two main categories that are representing the recommendations regarding to the roles of different entities. Government and the private sector (banks) 5.3.1 Recommendations for Government The government should prevent any goods entering Yemen only with a notification of banks operating and authorized, in order to treat the financial movement and return to the natural financial market. Moreover, create a department in the Central Bank for the control of exchange companies And delivery of the Central Bank to the daily movement of each exchange company. Finally, The government should Developing supervision and oversight mechanisms on the activities of banks and exchange companies, and ensuring the provision of accurate information through the automated link. 5.3.2 Recommendations For Private Sector (banks) Banks should create a new polices and strategies to be able to deal with such issues in the near or far future. 5.4 Future Research Through reviewing previous research, the researcher recommended that There should be further studies relating to exchange rate fluctuation with other variables that the researcher have not mentioned in this study. The effect of exchange rate fluctuation on foreign direct investment should be done. Since foreign direct investment is a major determinant of GDP and helps to boots income. It can also be used an indicator of growth for a country in terms of cash inflow. Furthermore, The effect of exchange rate fluctuation on inflation of the economy. Here, there should be research to establish to what extend the fluctuation affects inflation. And the need for further investigation into the relationship with other variables such as GDP.\n\n52. 41 5.5 Conclusion In conclusion, this research study examined the effect of fluctuating foreign exchange rate on Yemeni currency. The research findings (whether correlation analysis results or regression analysis results) all supported the idea that fluctuating foreign exchange rate was correlated with Yemeni currency. Also, the analysis indicated that fluctuating foreign exchange rate has a significant effect on Yemeni currency (significant =.000). Through surveying actually 148 employees of the banks operating in Sana'a, Yemen using a questionnaire which adopted its content by a researcher. Aiming for finding a relationship between foreign exchange rate fluctuations and Yemeni currency, the correlation analysis results showed that fluctuating foreign exchange rate was correlated with Yemeni currency. And the regression analysis showed that fluctuating foreign exchange rate has a significant effect on Yemeni currency which has been supported the hypotheses of this study.\n\n53. 42 REFERENCES research-methods.
