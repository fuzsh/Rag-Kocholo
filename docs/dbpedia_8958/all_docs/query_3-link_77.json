        "text": "Understanding Exchange Rates between AUD to YER\n\nExchange rates are defined as the price that one country or economic zoneâ€™s currency can be exchanged for another current of another country or economic zone. These rates are\n\nimpacted by two factors:\n\nThe domestic currency values\n\nThe foreign currency values\n\nThese rates can be quoted either directly or indirectly or with the use of cross-rates.\n\nDirect Quotation:\n\n- The price of a unit of foreign currency is directly quoted in terms of the number of units of domestic currency that are exchanged in direct quotation of exchange rates.\n\nIndirect Quotation:\n\n- The price of a domestic currency is expressed in terms of the number of units of foreign currency that are exchanged in an indirect quotation of exchange rates.\n\nCross Rates:\n\n- Cross rates are a method of quoting exchange rates in which different foreign currency exchange rates are utilised to suggest a local exchange rate, for example, if you wanted to know the AUD/YER exchange rate but couldn't get a direct quote. To calculate the AUD/YER rate, one might utilise the AUD/YER exchange rate and the AUD/YER exchange rate.\n\nImportant Tips to exchange AUD to YER currency while travelling abroad\n\nEvery country or economic zone operates with their own currency. It is necessary while travelling abroad to gain this knowledge beforehand so that currency can be exchanged smoothly and correctly. Many hotels, restaurants, shopsaccept only their local currency and do not accept any outside currencies.\n\n1. Do your research\n\n- To avoid getting cheated on or being ripped off by fraudsters or local merchants, make sure to know the ongoing exchange rate between your home currency and the local currency used. Do proper and through research on where currency can be exchanged in the place you are travelling to. Try finding the local branch of your preferred bank and be sure to confirm the conversion charges and services they offer. Find out which credit cards would offer you the best exchange value and be aware of the international transaction fee or the daily withdrawal limit, if any.\n\n2. Plan in advance\n\n- It is always advisable to get your currency exchanged before your travel date. In case of stronger currencies, make sure to observe the exchange rate to confirm if they are decreasing or increasing, specially if the currency tends to fluctuate frequently. This would help you minimise your expenses and make the maximum benefit of the exchange rate\n\n3. Compare exchange rates before buying\n\n- The exchange rates often vary depending on the merchant you choose to exchange your currency. Make sure to compare different merchants to avail the best offer to minimise your expenses.\n\n4. Avoid exchanging currencies at Airport Outlets\n\n- In most international airports you are charged a commission fee anywhere between 10 and 15%. This can become extremely costly as there is no scope for bargaining. Hence, do your research and plan in advance to save a considerable amount that would have been otherwise spent on commission. Also be cautious of hotels and train stations abroad as they may also charge a very high commission at a lower rate\n\n5. Carry cash as well as a card\n\n- One of the safest methods to carry money abroad is to follow the 30/70 approach. This refers to carrying 30% of your overall currency as cash and the remaining 70% as your forex travel card. It is better to have some local currency in hand. You can also maintain the rate of your forex travel cards since you load the card with the desired value in advance, thus being safe if the value fluctuates during your trip.\n\n6. Carry an additional Forex card\n\n- To avoid risks and getting stranded in another country during an unfortunate event of misplacing your wallet or theft, it is advisable to have an extra forex travel card. Many forex card providers offer a spare forex card for such cases at a nominal price or for free. In unfortunate cases like these, you can avoid the hassles of acquiring a new forex card or getting emergency cash at a higher exchange rate."
