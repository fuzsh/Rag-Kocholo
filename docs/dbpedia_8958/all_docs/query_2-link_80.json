        "text": "We’ve all seen the movie scenes where a man gasps, clutches his chest and falls to the ground. In reality, a heart attack victim could easily be a woman, and the scene may not be that dramatic.\n\nEven when the signs are subtle, the consequences can be deadly, especially if the person doesn’t get help right away.\n\n‘I thought I had the flu’\n\nEven though heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women in the United States, women often chalk up the symptoms to less life-threatening conditions such as acid reflux, the flu or normal aging.\n\nA heart attack strikes someone about every 40 seconds. It occurs when blood flow that brings oxygen to the heart muscle is severely reduced or cut off completely. This happens because the arteries that supply the heart with blood can slowly narrow from a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances (plaque).\n\nWatch an animation of a heart attack.\n\nMany women think the signs of a heart attack are unmistakable — but they can be subtler and sometimes confusing.\n\nSome women experiencing a heart attack describe upper back pressure that feels like squeezing or a rope being tied around them. Dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting are other symptoms.\n\nTake care of yourself\n\nHeart disease can be mostly preventable. So be sure to:\n\nSchedule an appointment with your health care professional to learn your risk for heart disease.\n\nQuit smoking. Just one year after you quit, you’ll cut your risk of coronary heart disease by 50%.\n\nAim for at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (such as brisk walking) or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity (such as jogging), or a combination of both, preferably spread throughout the week. It’s also good to include moderate- to high-intensity muscle-strengthening activity (such as resistance or weight training) at least twice a week.\n\nModify your family’s diet if needed. Check out these healthy cooking tips. You’ll learn smart substitutions, healthy snacking ideas and better prep methods.\n\nLearn more:"
