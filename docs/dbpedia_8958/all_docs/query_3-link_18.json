        "text": "The U.S. dollar is generally seen as the most powerful currency in the world. And it’s certainly the most-traded currency on the global stage by some margin.\n\nHowever, perhaps surprisingly, the “greenback” is not the strongest of the 180-odd traditional “fiat” currencies recognised as legal tender worldwide.\n\nHere’s a look at the top 10 strongest currencies in the world, based on their relative value against the Indian rupee.\n\nHow Is Foreign Currency Priced?\n\nForeign currency is traded in pairs, for example, buying U.S. dollars with Indian rupees. buying U.S. dollars with British pounds. As a result, currency is always priced relative to another currency, known as the “exchange rate”.\n\nMost currencies are “floating”, meaning their value fluctuates depending on demand and supply. However, some currencies are “pegged”, which means their value relative to another currency (such as Indian rupee) is fixed at an agreed rate.\n\nExchange rates affect the cost of goods and services in a foreign currency. For example, if the pound weakens against the dollar, a holiday in the U.S. would cost more in sterling terms.\n\nHowever, exchange rate movements also create opportunities for investors looking to profit from foreign exchange trading. We’ve produced a guide explaining the basics of foreign exchange movements and our pick of the best forex brokers.\n\nNote that any form of market-based investment or speculation puts all your capital at risk. Investments can go up and down in value, so you may lose some or all of your money. Leveraged products such as contracts for difference are highly speculative and carry the additional risk of losing money beyond that originally staked.\n\nTop 10 Strongest Currencies In The World\n\nWe’ve analyzed the strongest currencies, based on the number of units of foreign currency received in exchange for one Indian rupee.\n\nTop 10 Strongest Currency In The World\n\n1. Kuwaiti dinar (KWD)\n\nThe Kuwaiti dinar is the strongest currency in the world with 1 Kuwaiti dinar buying 272.76 Indian rupees (or, put another way, INR 1 equals 0.003 Kuwaiti dinars).\n\nKuwait is located between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, earning much of its wealth from being a leading global exporter of oil. The Kuwaiti dinar was introduced in the 1960s and was initially pegged to the British pound before being re-pegged to an undisclosed basket of currencies.\n\n2. Bahraini dinar (BHD)\n\nThe Bahraini dinar is the second strongest currency in the world with 1 Bahraini dinar buying 222.15 Indian rupees (or INR 1 equals 0.004 Bahraini dinars).\n\nBahrain is an island nation in the Persian Gulf off the coast of Saudi Arabia. Like Kuwait, the country earns much of its wealth from oil and gas exports. The Bahraini dinar entered circulation in 1965 and is pegged to the U.S. dollar.\n\n3. Omani rial (OMR)\n\nThe Omani rial is the third strongest currency in the world with 1 Omani rial buying 216.94 Indian rupees (or INR 1 equals 0.004 Omani rial).\n\nOman sits between the United Arab Emirates and Yemen at the tip of the Arabian peninsula. As with its other wealthy neighbors, Oman is a major exporter of oil and gas. The Omani rial was introduced in the 1970s and is pegged to the U.S. dollar.\n\n4. Jordanian dinar (JOD)\n\nThe Jordanian dinar is the fourth strongest currency in the world with 1 Jordanian dinar buying 117.83 Indian rupees (or INR 1 equals 0.008 Jordanian dinar).\n\nJordan is largely land-locked, bordering Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Jordan is less dependent on oil and gas exports than its neighbors and has struggled with sluggish economic growth and rising debt. The Jordanian dinar entered circulation in 1950 and is pegged to the U.S. dollar.\n\n5. British pound (GBP)\n\nThe British pound is the fifth strongest currency in the world with 1 British pound buying 108.38 Indian rupees (or INR 1 equals 0.009 British pounds).\n\nBritain is the sixth largest country by gross domestic product (GDP), according to the World Bank. The pound was first introduced in the 1400s before being decimalised in 1971. It is free-floating and thus not pegged to other currencies.\n\n6. Gibraltar pound (GIP)\n\nThe Gibraltar pound is the joint sixth strongest currency in the world with 1 Gibraltar pound buying 108.38 Indian rupees (or INR 1 equals 0.009 Gibraltar pounds).\n\nGibraltar is located at the southern tip of Spain and is officially a British territory. The Gibraltar pound was first introduced in the 1920s and is pegged to the British pound (at par, meaning that one GIP equals one GBP).\n\n7. Cayman Islands dollar (KYD)\n\nThe Cayman Islands dollar is the joint sixth strongest currency in the world with 1 Cayman Islands dollar buying 101.39 Indian rupees (or INR 1 equals 0.009 Cayman Islands dollars).\n\nThe Cayman Islands is a British territory in the Caribbean and is an offshore financial center. The Cayman Islands dollar was first introduced in the 1970s and is pegged to the U.S. dollar.\n\n8. Swiss Franc (CHF)\n\nThe Swiss franc is the joint eighth strongest currency in the world with 1 Swiss franc buying 93.27 Indian rupees (or INR 1 equals 0.01 Swiss francs).\n\nThe Swiss franc is the official legal tender of Switzerland and Liechtenstein and is seen as a safe haven due to Switzerland’s political stability. The Swiss franc was introduced in 1850 and was later briefly pegged to the euro before moving to a free-float.\n\n9. Euro (EUR)\n\nThe Euro is the joint eighth strongest currency in the world with 1 Euro buying 90.99 Indian rupees (or INR 1 equals 0.01 euros).\n\nThe euro is the official currency of the Eurozone, being 19 out of the 27 countries that form part of the European Union. The physical currency entered circulation in 2002 and is free-floating.\n\n10. US dollar (USD)\n\nThe U.S. dollar is the 10th strongest currency in the world, with 1 U.S. Dollar buying 83.53 Indian rupees (or INR 1 equals 0.01 U.S. dollars). It is worth exactly 1 against itself. All other units of currency across the globe are worth less than a U.S. dollar.\n\nCreated in the 1700s, the U.S. dollar is legal tender in the USA, other U.S. territories and sovereign nations including Puerto Rico, Ecuador and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe U.S. is the world’s largest economy by GDP and the U.S. dollar is by far the most-traded currency globally.\n\nThe U.S. dollar is also the largest reserve currency in the world (the currency most held by central banks) and is the currency used to price many commodities, including oil, gold and copper."
