This gives the customer the benefit of global aggregation for currency based licensing, providing volume based pricing as customer grows.\n\nNote: The conversion factors listed here are not tied to foreign exchange rate conversions. These are stable values based on historical relationships among currencies. The factors on this table will remain unchanged unless required by material changes.\n\nFor additional information, please contact your IBM Sales Representative."
