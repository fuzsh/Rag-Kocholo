Neither has significant military power, wealth, nor exportable as ofI December 1983 resources nor manufactures of any consequence. was used in this report. The strategic location of the Yemens, however, gives them importance. They occupy the southwest corner of the Arabian Peninsula and overlook the southern end of the Red Sea-Suez Canal waterway. Soviet air and naval forces have access to facilities in Aden and are strategically placed to block the Bab el Mandeb, the 26-kilometer-wide entrance to the Red Sea. Both North and South Yemeni leaders have played upon their geographic importance to gain economic and military aid from the major powers and from the Arabian Peninsula states. Sanaa's goal has been to gain maximum aid by balancing competing foreign interests, while fending off external control. In Aden, a succession of more ideologically committed regimes has chosen to align the country with the USSR. The new pragmatic leadership, however, is moderating its policies in a bid for increased aid from Saudi Arabia, the Persian Gulf sheikhdoms, and the West Chronic internal instability has complicated the efforts of Aden and Sanaa to exploit East-West rivalries. Both regimes are products of revolutions of the 1960s-led in the North by Nasirist-inspired military officers and in the South by Marxists. Both have attempted to impose alien ideologies and institutions on deeply traditional Islamic societies. North Yemen is not one country, but three: the Shafii (Sunni Muslim) south and west coast, the Zaydi (Shia Muslim) north, and the Sanaa central region. No leader has si- multaneously controlled all three areas. The Aden government, on the other hand, long ago consolidated control over its population, but the leadership remains beset by chronic infighting Leadership changes have been frequent and violent. Three heads of state- two in the North and one in the South-have been assassinated or executed since 1976. South Yemen's President Hasani may have been the target in 1982 of several assassination attempts, which probably were instigated by former President Isma'il from his exile in Moscow. Prospects are for continued instability over the near term. North Yemen's economy by mid-1983 was in a state of near collapse, detracting from the government's success in repressing the National Democratic Front insur- gency. In the South, Hasani's curtailment of support for insurgencies in North Yemen and Oman to induce moderate Arab aid for Aden's straitened economy still does not sit well with regime hardliners.

In 1969 South Yemeni regulars attacked Saudi border positions and in 1972 and 1979 fought brief and successful wars with North Yemen. Aden has provided aid and bases for the insurgents of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman and the National Democratic Front in North Yemen, as well as for a variety of international terrorist groups. While less alarming, other initiatives by Aden have tended to be abrasive. Aden aligns itself with the radical Arabs on Arab-Israeli issues, supports Marxist Ethiopia on the Eritrean issue, and spearheaded the formation of the Tripartite Alliance with Libya and Ethiopia in August 1981. Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies have sought periodically to induce Aden to moderate its policies in return for economic aid. This strategy backfired in 1978 when Riyadh's insistence on public pledges of moderation by then South Yemeni President Rubayyi Ali led to his overthrow by hardliners who believed his moves might lead to Aden's withdrawal from the radical camp. The Saudis now are proceeding more cautiously in attempting to gauge the depth of the South Yemeni leadership's commitment to modera- tion, which in part has resulted from disenchantment with Libya and the USSR over their unwillingness to provide the economic aid Aden believes it urgently needs Sanaa's Interests The energies of North Yemen under President Salih and his predecessors have been fully engaged in an effort to gain legitimacy, to master the country's divergent political forces, and to avert economic collapse. In the tribal north, Sanaa's control does not extend much beyond the major cities and the country's main arteries. Its military forces are deployed principally in the south to contain the National Democratic Front's guerrilla forces and to block attempts at intervention on their behalf by South Yemen's Army North Yemen does not present a direct military or subversive threat to its Saudi and Omani neighbors as has the Aden regime. Nonetheless, North Yemen has historical claims to areas in Saudi Arabia, and the Saudis fear that a strong, independent government in Sanaa might try to reassert those claims. In addition, Sanaa continues to hold over the Saudis the threat of closer cooperation with the USSR and tries to exploit Saudi fears to get more aid. The Saudis are concerned that Soviet involvement there might reach the level it has in South Yemen. North Yemen also has more than 600,000 migrant workers abroad-most in Saudi Arabia-and Riyadh views them as a potential source of unrest over the long term.

Although Aden has not acceded to Soviet requests for formal basing rights, the Soviets have overflight, bunkering, ship repair, and communications privileges. The Soviet Navy uses the waters around the island of Socotra for fleet anchorages and engages in military exercises nearby with South Yemen's naval forces. The armies of both Yemens depend heavily on Moscow for weaponry and military advisers. Despite the hostility between Sanaa and Aden, which at times has flared into open warfare, Moscow has not been forced to choose between the two as was the case in 1977 between Somalia and Ethiopia There are indications that Moscow is now pressing Aden for basing rights in South Yemen in return for easing payments on the debt Aden incurred in purchasing Soviet arms. Such bases would complement Soviet facilities in Ethiopia's Dahlak Archipelago and would give Soviet forces a good position in the strategic Bab el Mandeb. The Saudis, in particular, fear that the Soviet presence in the Yemens is aimed ultimately at Riyadh and the Gulf oilfields. The Saudis and the other Gulf monarchies take the long-term threats from the Yemens seriously. Riyadh, eager to maintain a buffer against the radical regime in Aden, has in recent years made up at least a third of North Yemen's annual budget deficit and funds much of the regime's arms purchases. At the same time, the Saudis have sought to prevent the emergence of a strong central government in Sanaa, to counter the influence of Moscow and native leftists within the regime, and to derail attempts at significant cooperation between the two Yemens. Riyadh funds a variety of rightwing political factions-tribal sheikhs, conservative military and government officials, and fundamentalist religious groups-to the detriment of North Yemen's President Salih. The Saudis, who have been instrumental in the rise to power of Sanaa's last three rulers, continue to search for a North Yemeni with acceptable conservative credentials to replace Salih.~ 25X1 Outlook Both Yemens resent interference in their affairs by foreign powers, but they cannot escape this, given their geographic importance and economic need. Sanaa has been the more skillful at playing off the interests of Moscow on the one hand and Riyadh and Washington on the other. Under the leadership of President Hasani, Aden now appears to be trying to follow a similar course. Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/05/23: CIA-RDP85T00314R000100010001-0 Sec, Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/05/23: CIA-RDP85TOO314R000100010001-0 Even with continuing help from both West and East, however, the Salih re- gime is unlikely soon to consolidate its power. Sanaa can hope, at best, to extend government influence gradually beyond the main population centers while holding in check leftist and Saudi-funded conservative political factions and whittling down the power of the tribes. This could come to naught, however, if the economy continues to weaken, possibly triggering another round of coup attempts. The downturn in Saudi oil revenues bodes ill for North Yemen, threatening cutbacks in Saudi subventions and in worker remittances. Economic factors are also likely to be decisive in determining President Hasani's longevity in South Yemen. Without tangible benefits for South Yemen from his moderate course, his rivals on the left will press for a re- turn to more activist policies and may seek to overthrow him. Neither Hasani nor a successor, however, is likely to seek to weaken Aden's association with the Soviets, whatever the pressures from Riyadh. South Yemen's military will continue to remain almost entirely dependent on the Communist countries for weaponry and military advisers.

A distinctive Yemeni cultural zone, centered on the highland re- gion of the southwest corner of the Arabian Peninsu- la, includes all of present-day North Yemen and most of South Yemen and extends into the Asir and Jizan regions of neighboring Saudi Arabia.' Despite this common heritage, Yemeni society, like that of many highland peoples, has always been fragmented. A proud, fractious people who consider themselves the The authority of the Imams was generally lightly felt, even when the Zaydi state was at its zenith. The tribes viewed the Imam's role as restricted to mediation of their quarrels and invariably resisted attempts by Sanaa to govern them. The Imamate throughout its history remained both inward looking and xenophobic with only the most rudimentary of governing institu- tions. Until the death of Imam Yahya in 1948, no foreign embassies were permitted in the Imamate and purest in descent of all Arabs, Yemenis are divided along regional, tribal, and class lines Islam, which was introduced in 628 AD, failed to bridge these divisions and, in fact, introduced fresh ones. In the ninth century, Shia Muslims reached the Yemen highlands from Persia and founded a theo- cratic state centered on the Sanaa region. The warlike Zaydis of the north, the principal Shia sect in the Yemens, have since dominated the much more nu- merous Shafiis (Sunni) who are located along the coasts and through the southern highlands. The Zaydi Imamate Under the leadership of Imams, who combined both religious and secular duties, the boundaries of the Zaydi state fluctuated widely, extending at times well to the north of the present North Yemeni-Saudi Arabian frontier, to Aden in the south, and eastward into the Dhofar region of Oman. As late as the 1950s, the Imamate government of North Yemen continued to assert its claim to Shafli territories under the protection of the British colonial government in Aden, sending its forces into repeated skirmishes with the British 'The Hadhramis and other peoples of the eastern third of South Yemen have separate cultural and historical traditions. A number of tribes in the Al Mahrah district and on the island of Socotra speak Semitic languages that antedate the introduction of Arabic to South Arabia. Hadhramis traditionally have traveled widely throughout South Asia as traders and mercenary soldiers. Today many Hadhramis opposed to the Aden regime have resettled in no emissaries were sent abroad. Change and Revolution Nineteenth-century colonialism, Ottoman Turkish in 25X1 the north and British in the south, introduced changes to static Yemeni society, which were to culminate in revolution in the 1960s. But marked differences in the two colonial heritages profoundly influenced the sepa- rate directions the revolutions were to take The North. The Turks, who occupied Sanaa in 1872, attempted to introduce order and security and estab- lish a rational bureaucratic administration. Ottoman rule, however, was violently resisted from the outset in an intermittently fought war of national liberation led by the Imams. The Turks withdrew in 1919, their material legacy limited to a few schools and hospitals. The Imamate, however, took from the Turks the concept of a standing army, under the command of professionally trained officers. A few Turks remained behind to found and staff a military academy whose graduates were to become the agents of modernism in Yemeni politics. The war against Turkey profoundly altered the char- acter of the Imamate. Trading on the new phenome- non of Yemeni nationalism, Imam Yahya and his son and successor, the even more despotic Imam Ahmad, sought to transform the Imamate into an absolute monarchy, a concept entirely alien to Zaydi precepts and anathema to the Shafii community and the emerging modernist element. A succession of conspir- acies culminated in the revolt of the Nasirist-inspired Free Officers on 26 September 1962. 25X1 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/05/23: CIA-RDP85T00314R000100010001-0 Secre_ Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/05/23: CIA-RDP85T00314R000100010001-0 Figure 2 NIGO* _ Wypr Leta on BEi S Syria el A~ ' 1 'I *AMMAN (,Jorda n\\ ud 7A n:tice 4~ne f f Egyj#a Iraq Ira gSaudi Arabia Neutral Zone U1NMT 1 ran ~ri~rJ, ft1 tuff MANAMA Bahr $ Q 8r Saudi Arabia $rrait.oT^` t HnrnIu Afrin iit87l United Arab Emirates _ - - no defined J _ - boundary -~ CIA 8oundaryve ~S Ud an I ane I-tSyk hi pia *ADDIS ABABA Kenya bv~ bF Soma_: a.

The tribesmen and their sheikhs-still the ultimate arbiters of Yemeni politics-remained attached to traditional values-the desire for arms and money, the preservation of their local autonomy, and loyalty to the Imam to whom they had sworn allegiance. The solution-a typically Yemeni compromise that denied outright victory to both sides-essentially placed the revolution in abeyance. The Imamate passed into history, while the republican government moved steadily to the right. To this day the traditional polycentric Yemeni political system continues to im- pede the development of a modern nation state. The Aden Colony. More than a century of British colonial domination led to a different and more decisive outcome in the south. In Aden a radical nationalist regime succeeded British rule in 1967, combining a successful drive for independence with a social revolution, and firmly asserted its control over the traditionally oriented rural population. The British seized the port of Aden in 1839 as a base to counter French and Ottoman operations in the Red Sea area. Its importance as a coaling station midway on the route to the Indian subcontinent grew with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. For the next 100 years, it was the only major urban center anywhere in the Arabian Peninsula, attracting a polyglot popula- tion of Westerners, Indians, and Yemenis. From a total of 20,000 in the mid-19th century, Aden's population by 1963 had grown to 225,000, a third of whom were natives of North Yemen. From the first, Aden acted as an agent of social transformation. The growth of secular education, the establishment of bureaucracies on alien, egalitarian models, and the expansion of commerce and industry created many new political and social roles for which members of all Yemeni classes in the south competed on more or less equal terms. By the 1950s the Aden Trades Union Congress and its political extension, the People's Socialist Party, were spearheading a cam- paign for national independence and social reform. F_ Aden and extended to the east through the Hadhra- maut. Rejecting the Imamate's claims to suzerainty, all had become British protectorates by the 1930s. After World War II, however, British administrators gradually introduced political reforms and services to the sultanates, which eroded the authority of the native rulers. British efforts to disarm the tribesmen 25X1 forced them to turn from their traditional leaders to the Imamate for weapons. Dissidence and armed rebellion supported by arms and money from Sanaa and Egypt spread through Aden and the protectorates in the 1950s, fanned by Arab nationalist propaganda directed at the British and the native elites. Intent on reducing its commit- 25X1 ments in the Gulf and on the Arabian Peninsula, Britain pledged in 1959 to prepare the protectorates and the Aden Colony for independence. The Federa- tion of South Arabia was inaugurated in January 1963 with independence projected five years hence. Two rival nationalist factions disrupted the timetable. Between 1964 and 1967 the radical National Libera- tion Front (NLF) and the Nasirist-influenced Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY) waged a bitter struggle against the British. In the face of rising violence, Britain abandoned its plans to establish a moderate regime upon departure and began withdrawing its troops from Aden in the fall of 1967. In November, London negotiated a transfer of power to the NLF as the dominant political force in the country. With the ruling elite of the sultanates discredited and in flight, the new regime soon consolidated its control throughout the country, helped by a civil service and army inherited from the British and the tradition of strong central government exercised from Aden. Through the next decade the leadership grew increas- ingly radical and turned its attention to exporting its revolution to its nearest neighbors, North Yemen and Oman The Protectorates.

Unification as a central theme in the political rhetoric of both northerners and southerners draws strength from: ? The nationalism that developed in the late stages of the Imamate. The early republican government asserted the Imamate's claim to southern Yemen- seats in the national assembly were allocated to southern representatives, a cabinet post for Yemeni Unity Affairs was created, and refuge was provided for South Yemen liberation movements. ? Cooperation between revolutionary movements in North and South. The opponents of the Imams in the 1940s and 1950s used Aden as their base. Later, the guerrilla war against the British in Aden was directed from North Yemen. Many southerners joined radical northern republicans in the defense of Sanaa during the royalist siege in 1967-68. ? Migration from North to South. Northerners, main- ly from Shafii areas, comprised as much as 35 percent of Aden's population before 1967. Former President Isma'il is a northerner and has been the strongest proponent of unity among South Yemeni leaders Since its swing to the right in the late 1960s, the Sanaa government has paid mostly lipservice to calls for unity, believing that merger between the two governments would be to Aden's advantage, given its centralized government and more effective security forces. Meanwhile, it has attempted to undermine the southern regime by giving support to opposition ele- ments. Ex-FLOSY members, for example, have formed an important political faction in the North, which has frequently had representatives serving in Sanaa governments. The South, for its part, has provoked border conflicts and supported guerrilla action in the North to wrest political concessions from the Sanaa government. The South in particular has sought to force the North to accept unity of the Yemens and take radicals into its Secret government. In 1972 widespread border fighting end- ed only when the North agreed to the establishment of joint committees to negotiate a full merger of the Yemens. After North Yemeni President al-Hamdi's assassina- tion in October 1977 by conservatives, relations be- tween the two Yemens again. deteriorated sharply. The assassination of Northern President al-Ghashmi by a South Yemeni agent in June 1978 probably was ordered by radicals to avenge Hamdi's death. Nation- al Democratic Front (NDF) guerrillas, recruited from dissident political factions opposed to the Sanaa re- gime, began infiltrating in mid-1978 into the North from bases on the South Yemeni side of the border. In February 1979 localized clashes between North and South regulars escalated into full-scale warfare with Aden holding the edge. Negotiations in Kuwait in March 1979 ended conven- tional military hostilities, with Sanaa forced to reaf- firm its 1972 commitment to unity. Sanaa was also pressed to accept internal regime changes. Rightwingers were ousted from its government and replaced by northerners acceptable to Aden. The ouster of the radical `Abd al-Fatah Isma'il from the presidency and his replacement by Ali Nasir Muhammad al-Hasani, a relative moderate, led to changes in Aden's relations with Sanaa. Hasani ap- parently favors political action, including subversion, over conventional military strategy as the best way for the NDF to gain power in Sanaa. With the defeat of the NDF by government forces in the spring and summer of 1982, an agreement was reached with Sanaa providing for a pullback of regular forces along the frontier and curtailment of Aden's support for NDF conventional forces. Although there have been continuing tensions since then, both sides have exer- cised restraint and there has been no serious outbreak of fighting. Although neither Sanaa nor Aden appear to believe that unification is a realistic goal, both find gestures toward eventual unity politically useful.

It also provides for meetings of joint committees headed by the Ministers of Defense, Foreign Affairs, Interior, Education, and Develop- ment.

Meetings of the military committee have been useful in monitoring the disen- gagement of forces along the border.

With the excep- tion of the port of Aden and its surrounding area, the Yemens have been among the least accessible regions of the Arabian Peninsula, although their coasts lie along one of the world's most heavily traveled water routes.

The Soviet Navy uses Socotra for military exercises and its sheltered waters for fleet anchorages. Aden has fortified Perim Island in the Bab el Mandeb, which it holds as the result of a plebiscite. Its claim to Kamaran Island farther north is disputed by Sanaa, which seized and garrisoned it during the fighting between North and South Yemen in 1972. Borders Much of the Yemens' frontier with Saudi Arabia to the north and Oman to the east has never been defined or remains in dispute. The northern border, which follows the crests of mountain ridges for ap- proximately 320 kilometers inland from the Red Sea to the vicinity of Najran, is the only section that has been demarcated and accepted as an internationally recognized boundary. From Najran south and east to the Oman border, the frontier crosses the still largely unsurveyed western reaches of the Rub' al Khali (Empty Quarter). South Yemen's border with Oman is an administrative boundary laid down by the Many North Yemenis still are unreconciled to the northern boundary, reluctantly accepted by Sanaa after its military defeat by the Saudis in 1934, and assert a national claim to the \"lost\" province of Asir, the Najran oasis, and the Jizan area. Territorial disputes in the Rub' al Khali also are likely to become heated if oil exploration being conducted by a US company in the borderlands results in significant finds. Sanaa, Aden, and Riyadh cite tribal allegiances to support territorial claims. Territorial claims were not at issue in the border clashes between North and South Yemen in 1972 and 1979. The present border was drawn by the British and Turks in 1914 to separate their colonial posses- sions. Topography The Yemens are divided into four well-defined geo- graphic regions-a narrow coastal plain; the moun- tainous interior; the crescent-shaped eastern escarp- ment, which gives way in the northeast to plains and the vast sand deserts of the Rub' al Khali; and in the east, the broad Hadhramaut tableland. The rugged terrain covering most of the two countries has favored 25X1 the development of isolated communities, a factor that, perhaps more than any other, has been responsi- ble for the fragmentation characterizing Yemeni soci- ety. The coastal plain is a southern extension of the Tihamah, the and lowland that runs north along the coast of the Red Sea as far as the Saudi border with Jordan. In the Yemens, the Tihamah varies in width from 10 to 30 kilometers. Seven major wadis (inter- mittent streams), which flow from the central high- lands, make limited agriculture possible.

Yemeni society is hierarchically organized with clear distinctions between and within social classes. Endogamy is the rule, perpetuating these distinctions and giving them the. force of caste boundaries. The right to bear arms and the manner in which they are displayed continue to be important indicators of social status in North Yemen. The revolutions of the 1960s have not blurred tradi- tional class distinctions to any great extent, but they have broken the control by traditional elites of politi- cal and economic power. The professional military in both countries and the party in South Yemen have become channels enabling some persons of the lower, traditionally non-arms-bearing classes to rise to high- er status. regime.

At the lower end of the social scale are tradesmen and tenant farmers, and lower still are the akhdam, most of whom are of African descent. Members of the akhdam class in North Yemen typically perform menial jobs such as sweeping streets Religion. Although almost all Yemenis are Muslim, sectarian quarrels have been responsible for much of the fragmentation of Yemeni society. Most Yemenis are adherents of the two major branches of Islam- the orthodox Sunni and the heterodox Shia. The majority Shafii community, which takes its name from one of the four schools jurisprudence of Sunni Islam, constitutes at least half of the population in North Yemen and virtually all of the population in South Yemen. In North Yemen, Shafiis occupy the entire stretch of the Tihamah, the southern highlands, and the eastern borderlands. The Zaydis, adherents of a Shia sect, dominate the central and northern highlands, with Sanaa as their center, and extend to the north where they straddle the frontier with Saudi Arabia. Small Ismaili Shia communities are found in the Haraz region west of Sanaa and among the Yam tribes in the border area near Najran. About 1,000 Jews remain from the once 60,000-strong Yemeni Jewish community. Most Jews left en masse for Israel in 1948. Although Zaydis and Shaflis are conservative'in religious matters, neither community displays the zealotry of contemporary Iranian Shiism or the dour puritanism of the Wahhabis (Sunni) of Saudi Arabia. Theologically, there is little distinction between the Yemeni sects. Zaydi teachings, in fact, are closer to Sunni dogma than those of any other Shia sect, and it is not uncommon for Zaydis and Shaflis to intermarry or worship in each other's mosques Politically and economically, however, the communi- ties remain deeply divided, and continuing tensions between the two have contributed to much of North Yemen's chronic political instability. The Shafiis, generally more sophisticated and better educated, have resented their political domination by the more warlike Zaydis through much of Yemeni history. Notwithstanding sectarian feuding, Islamic practice is supported fully by the Sanaa government in both Zaydi and Shafii areas. The 1970 Constitution de- clared Islam to be the state religion and identified the sharia, the codification of the Islamic legal and moral system, as the source of all state laws. The South Yemeni Government, despite its avowed Marxism, has treated Islamic issues gingerly. Article 46 of the Constitution asserts that Islam is the religion of the state. South Yemen's social practices, however, are the least restrictive of any Arab country. Women, for example, are integrated into the urban work force, although in the countryside they generally remain veiled and are confined by custom to tradition- al roles.) The Tribes. Tribalism permeates all facets of life in the Yemens. Sanaa has made only limited progress in extending its writ beyond the capital and other urban centers into Zaydi areas. Traditional sheikhly families continue to lead the Zaydi tribes, which function as virtually independent political, economic, and military entities. By contrast, the sheikhly class has been all but destroyed in South Yemen and has lost much of its power in Shafii areas of North Yemen. Most of the Zaydi tribes are grouped into two main confederations-the relatively tightly organized Hashid, whose paramount sheikhs in recent years have been supplied by the al-Ahmar family of the dominant Bani `Usaymat tribe, and the more numer- ous but diffuse Bakil. Although acknowledging these allegiances, tribes join in concerted action only if they perceive their interests to be directly involved. Loyal- ties, whether to the government or to the sheikhs, however, are always subject to negotiation. To the extent possible, the Zaydi tribes organize their affairs independently of the government.

The once powerful Akk confederacy of the Tihamah never recovered from its military defeat by the Imamate in 1929. The intrusion of Zaydi land- holding clans and families has tended to break up Shafii tribal structures throughout the southern high- lands. Shafii loyalties now are primarily focused on the village community. Although the sheikhly class has effectively been de- stroyed in South Yemen, identification with a particu- lar tribal group is still common, even within the government, party, and military. Members of the Dathinah tribe, for example, dominate the officer corps, having replaced the Aulaqi, who had been favored under the British.

Much of the population lives beyond effective gov- ernment control. ? Communication and transportation are poorly de- veloped. ? The economy is based largely on subsistence agriculture. ? Few commercially exploitable minerals have been found. As a result, Sanaa has the worst trade imbalance in the world, with export earnings typically covering less than 1 percent of the import bill. Although substantial foreign exchange is received through worker remittances, these earnings have dis- torted more than benefited the economy. A labor shortage was created in the 1970s by the migration of about 600,000 Yemeni workers-about half the do- mestic labor force-attracted by the economic boom in neighboring countries. The worker exodus generat- ed demand for foreign labor to replace the loss of Yemenis, pushed up wage scales, and contributed to a deterioration of the country's agricultural base. The migration also fostered the development of a black market. Increased purchasing power afforded by the wide distribution of worker remittances stimu- lated unbridled import growth. The government tried to profit from the burgeoning consumer demand by imposing customs duties on imports. This resulted in government dependence on remittances as the largest source of foreign exchange and the chief source of revenue. Not surprisingly, imposition of customs du- ties, coupled with the government's inability to control border areas, stimulated trade in smuggled goods and illegal currency transactions, according to the US Embassy. Black-market activity now siphons off sub- stantial government revenues and denies it needed foreign exchange. Moreover, government hopes of channeling remit- tances into productive investment have been only marginally fulfilled. Because of endemic political uncertainty, private investors have sought rapid re- turns from ventures in retail sales or production of light consumer goods and have shied away from investments involving long-term payoffs. The govern- ment, therefore, has had to carry the burden of financing both the country's infrastructure and the infant industrial sector. As a consequence, the Yeme- ni industrial base is not sufficiently developed to stem the consumer-led growth in imports. Agriculture. North Yemen, with some of the most fertile land in the Arabian Peninsula, has the poten- tial to become self-sufficient in food production. The agriculture sector, however, has performed poorly despite its importance to the economy. Although over 75 percent of the labor force is employed on the land, farming accounts for about 40 percent of GDP- down from 45 percent in 1975. Low farm incomes have contributed to emigration, which has left the sector with labor shortages. North Yemen's farm output has virtually stagnated since the mid-1970s. The production of cotton-once North Yemen's main export commodity-plummeted from a peak of 27,000 tons in 1975 to 3,000 tons in 1980, mostly because of high production costs and the suspension of subsidized credits. North Yemen im- ports about 35 percent of its grain requirements, its largest agricultural import category. Approximately 20 percent of North Yemen's land is arable. In the Tihama plain, farming depends on irrigation. Major crops are cotton, grain, tobacco, and olives. In the highlands, cereals, coffee, qat, and vegetables are grown using a labor-intensive system of terracing.

To boost agricultural productivity, the government began in 1981 to implement the second phase of an $82 million rural development effort to upgrade roads, water supplies, and health services and to improve coordination of the government's activities in agriculture. The regime also has plans to revive the domestic textile industry. The government will not realize quick returns from its, agricultural investments because of the long lead- times needed for most of these projects. Mechaniza- tion to offset labor outflows is hampered by the small size of individual land holdings-about 90 percent are less than 5 hectares-lack of adequate financing, insufficient infrastructure, and rugged terrain. A shortage of skilled administrators also impedes mod- ernization. North Yemen's industry also does not have the diver- sity to make economic self-sufficiency a realistic goal. Food and beverage processing is the dominant activity followed by metal processing and the production of building materials and chemicals. As a result of the decline in cotton output, the two government-owned textile mills operate far below capacity. infrastructure. North Yemen's prospects for industrial development will remain severely limited, even if funding becomes available. Its raw materials endowment cannot sup- port more than the expansion of the building materi- als industries. A shortage of all categories of labor, the resulting steep wages, and high costs of other inputs, such as electricity, work against industrial expansion. Other constraints include the small size of the domestic market and the lack of supporting Industry. The industrial sector is not developed enough to slow the rapid rise in imports. In 1981 manufacturing accounted for only 14 percent of GDP and mining and quarrying for 1 percent. Together, these sectors employ less than 5 percent of the labor force.

At the same time, the value of imports has remained high-roughly $1.7 billion-despite efforts to cut spending. The government has essentially abandoned the FY 1983 budget, and new restrictions have been placed on imports and hard currency transactions Foreign loans and grants apparently are declining from 1980-82 levels when North Yemen received $300-400 million in official development assistance and military aid. Saudi Arabia, North Yemen's larg- est benefactor, has promised to maintain assistance at 1982 levels, however. Saudi Arabia will continue to provide only enough aid to ensure that the Salih regime does not fall victim to a leftist takeover. Revenue shortfalls have forced Sanaa to draw down its foreign exchange assets to cover its growing cur- rent account deficit, which in 1980-81 reached over $480 million. Reserves fell to about $500 million in February 1983 from a peak of $1.4 billion in 1979 and are still dropping. Income and Prices. Per capita income in North Yemen is only about $544 per year. Most of the population lives at a subsistence level in the agricul- tural sector. In the industrial sector, many business- men ironically must rely on foreign workers.

Since February 1973 the Central Bank has maintained a fixed exchange rate for the North Yemen riyal at 4.5 to 1 US dollar. This rate is applied to the value of all foreign assets and liabilities. For revenue purposes the exchange rate is 5 riyals to the dollar resulting in an effective customs duty of 11 percent. To curb imports of luxury goods, duties on these items have been increased; cars for example, are taxed 90 percent of their value.

Since its founding in 1962 its history has been a compendium of woes: civil war, two coups, two wars with South Yemen, and a major leftwing insurgency. These have been compounded by endemic tribal and sectarian feuding and by foreign meddling in North Yemen's internal politics, chiefly by Riyadh and Aden. Chronic political violence has inhibited the develop- ment of stable governing institutions. Assassinations since the 1962 revolution have included President Salih's two predecessors.

The Legacy of the Septembrists. The proclamation of the Yemen Arab Republic in Sanaa by Nasirist- influenced military officers in September 1962 sparked an eight-year civil war between royalists supported by Saudi Arabia and republicans dependent on troops and administrators furnished by Egypt. The war ended in 1970 under the terms of a compact under which the Imam was exiled and royalists were absorbed into the republican government and mili- tary After four years of ineffective civilian government, Deputy Commander in Chief Ibrahim al-Hamdi seized power on 13 June 1974 with support from conservative elements and the Saudis. He suspended the Constitution, abolished many civilian institutions, and installed a Military Command Council with himself as chairman and Commander in Chief.F_ When al-Hamdi moved against entrenched interests of the major tribal sheikhs, conservative elements, possibly with Saudi connivance, assassinated him on a End of year. b Estimated. 11 October 1977 on the eve of a planned visit to Aden. His successor, the conservative Ahmad Husayn al- Ghashmi, who allegedly led the coup, was killed by -a South Yemeni agent on 24 June 1978. Within a month of al-Ghashmi's death, `Ali `Abdallah Salih won the endorsement of the People's Constitu- ent Assembly as president. His conservative creden- tials brought him Saudi backing, and his earlier success in putting down a mutiny by leftist paratroops enabled him to pick up key support in the military.? Government Organization. North Yemen's political institutions and government structure are weak, re- flecting four violent changes of regime since 1961. Executive authority is concentrated almost exclusively in the hands of the President, whose decrees are law. He appoints the Vice President and the Prime Minis- ter and often appoints those he wants to placate or co- opt to the largely ceremonial posts of Second Vice President and Deputy Prime Minister. Salih also has created an Advisory Council comprised of 15 nota- bles creasingly have been held by technocrats. The Prime Minister chairs the Cabinet and the Council of Ministers. He is responsible for daily administration of the government and coordination of economic development. Under al-Ghashmi and Salih, the prime ministers have been politically neutral technocrats.

Salih has laid the groundwork for replacement of the assembly by a new People's Assembly with 80 elected and 20 appointed members who supposedly will be empowered to propose laws, approve or reject presi- dential initiatives, and draft a new constitution. Salih is almost certain to tightly circumscribe its powers if and when it is inaugurated. North Yemen is divided into 11 provinces, each headed by a presidentially appointed governor. The governor shares power with the province's military commander. Provinces have changed little since the time of the Imamate, which accounts in part for the wide disparity in size and population between prov- inces. Political and legal authorities at the subdistrict, vil- lage, and hamlet levels are locally chosen. Usually the sheikh of the most important tribe or clan in the region heads the subdistrict. More than 200 rural cooperatives, organized and operated on a voluntary basis, are engaged in building schools, health care facilities, access roads, and other local community projects. The government, recogniz- ing their growing political and economic importance, assigns a Deputy Prime Minister to head the Confed- eration of Yemeni Development Associations. He coordinates Local Development Association activities and assists in securing government and foreign financ- ing. Tribal sheikhs and local government officials reportedly dominate the Development Associations, although, in theory at least, they are to be run on a democratic basis. Political Constituencies. The major tribal sheikhs constitute a political elite whose power derives from the allegiance of thousands of armed tribesmen. They exert influence through tribal networks that honey- comb the government and the military families controlled six of the then 10 provincial governorships. Tribal and personal rivalries prevent the sheikhs from presenting a united front toward the government. Salih exploits this by dealing with the sheikhs individually. The regime's control of develop- ment funds for clinics, schools, and road projects popular with tribesmen also gives it important lever- age over the sheikhs. Islamic fundamentalism, long dormant in North Ye- men, has shown new strength in the 1980s, drawing adherents from across the social spectrum. Funda- mentalist groups made gains in the municipal elec- tions of 1982 and in contests for seats on rural Local Development Associations. Some groups have strong ties to similar movements in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, and Iran. The groups attack corruption in government and have called publicly for renewed emphasis on Islamic law, an economy based on Ko- ranic principles, and renewed restrictions on women's activities. Saudi Arabia funds the Muslim Brotherhood in North Yemen and the Islamic Front and its paramili- tary force, which has fought alongside the Army against the National Democratic Front (NDF) insur- gents. By strengthening Salih's conservative oppo- nents, Riyadh hopes to gain additional leverage over the President, but without causing his downfall. The regime has responded by stepping up surveillance of activists, launching occasional harassing arrests, and replacing known Muslim Brotherhood members in the school system. At the same time, the regime has sought to refurbish its Islamic credentials by tighten- ing restrictions on foreigners and by increasing public executions and floggings for serious crimes The Salih Regime. In the absence of a strong institu- tional, framework, North Yemeni leaders maneuver by playing off the tribal groupings, leftist and rightist factions, and the modernist and traditionalist commu- nities. Underrated by the Saudis and considered at best an interim President, Salih has proved adept at outmaneuvering and co-opting real and potential op- ponents. President Salih has successfully resisted pressure to return the sheikhs to the commanding position they held prior to al-Hamdi's presidency when sheikhly 25X1 25X1 ,25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/05/23: CIA-RDP85T00314R000100010001-0 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/05/23: CIA-RDP85T00314R000100010001-0 Secret Table 6 Identified Islamic Fundamentalist Groups in North Yemen Muslim Brotherhood Egyptian origin.

Like most Middle East strongmen, Salih has secured his position by concentrating power in the hands of a small group of trusted relatives-all members of the Sanhan tribe-and close tribal associates. A brother and a cousin command the countercoup forces of the 2nd Artillery and 1st Armored Brigades stationed near the capital. Another brother, a Deputy Minister of the Interior, commands the Central Security Forces and substitutes for the President when he is Salih's preoccupation with day-to-day survival has contributed to the near paralysis of the state in administrative and financial affairs. The foreign ex- change reserves built up during the al-Hamdi era and the credit standing vital to carry out long-term devel- opmental projects have been squandered by Salih in attempts to build political support Internal Security. Three organizations share respon- sibility for internal security-the National Security Organization, the Central Security Forces, and the National Organization for General Intelligence and Military Security. President Salih's relatives or close personal associates hold key posts in each organization. Founded in 1967 with British help, the 4,000-strong National Security Organization (NSO) is North Ye- men's primary internal security organization. It con- ducts counterintelligence and provides for the protec- tion of high-level personages as well as gathering and evaluating foreign intelligence. President Salih keeps a tight rein on the NSO through its director, a close confidant who also heads the Supreme Defense Coun- cil. The NSO administers the presidential bodyguard that is largely recruited from the Sanhan tribe. The Interior Ministry's Central Security Forces (CSF) 25X1 are organized along paramilitary lines and are pri- marily responsible for riot control and the protection of foreign embassies and officals. They also have taken part in counterinsurgency and counterterrorist operations. The CSF has an approximate strength of 5,000 men armed with light and crew-served weapons and equipped with armored personnel carriers. They are headed by Deputy Interior Minister Muhammad Abdallah Salih, a full brother of the President.

Although nominally subordinate to Chief of Staff Bashiri, its chief, a member of the Sanhan tribe, reports directly to President Salih. A Jordanian military mission trains and advises NOGIMS. F__1 Opposition The most serious challenge to the Salih regime has come from the South Yemen-backed NDF insurgen- cy. The NDF was formed in 1976 as an umbrella organization of North Yemeni leftist groups and disaffected nationalists. Its goals are to eliminate Saudi influence in Sanaa, to replace North Yemen's tribally based society with an Arab socialist state, and to unite the Yemens, according to Front propaganda. It has successfully exploited Shafii resentment of Zaydi domination of the Sanaa government to build a power base in the south. Using this as leverage, the NDF has pressed Salih to give it several cabinet posts, including the Interior Ministry. The NDF leadership is dominated by Marxists. It is headed by Sultan Ahmad Umar, born in North Yemen and a Marxist revolutionary with longstand- ing ties to South Yemeni radicals, including former President Isma'il. Some non-Marxist NDF leaders reportedly have close ties to Libya South Yemen has long been the NDF's principal supporter, providing arms, advisers, training bases, and even regular troops posing as volunteers. Sultan Umar and other prominent NDF leaders are also members of the Central Committee of South Yemen's ruling party, the Yemen Socialist Party. The NDF also receives aid from Libya, Syria, Ethiopia, and at least indirectly from Cuba and the USSR In early 1982 the NDF appeared on the verge of gaining control over most of southern and south- central North Yemen. It had largely shifted to con- ventional warfare, using heavy weapons supplied by South Yemen. This provoked a strong military re- sponse from Sanaa, whose forces rolled the insurgents back in a series of counterattacks beginning in the spring of 1982. To avoid a more serious military confrontation with the North, South Yemen's Presi- dent Hasani subsequently reduced support to the NDF. Since the counteroffensive, President Salih has fur- ther weakened the NDF by exploiting its internal divisions, splitting non-Marxists from doctrinaire left- ists and successfully encouraging defections through an amnesty program The NDF's popular support also has declined. Al- though the Shafiis still resent the Sanaa government, many were alienated by the brutal repression that the NDF inflicted upon the towns and villages it con- trolled. The Shafiis for the moment appear reconciled to accepting the Sanaa government as the lesser of two evils Armed Forces The armed forces and the internal security forces are the key to the survival of North Yemen's rulers. The Army is the single most cohesive group in the republic and is the principal means of political control over the population. Many military officers fill high-level gov- ernment posts Victories over the NDF in the spring of 1982, continu- ing weapons acquisition, and relatively liberal salaries and perquisites appear to have blunted criticism of the regime within the armed forces. Army political fac- tions tend to be centrist; most radicals were purged before 1970 or have since defected to the NDF. President Salih, however, tolerates some pro-Soviet officers, probably as a counter to Saudi influence within the military. Chief of Staff Bashiri, a confidant of Salih, is pro-Soviet, according to US Embassy officials units must be directly authorized by the President President Salih is Commander in Chief of the armed forces and acts as Defense Minister.

Below him are deputy chiefs for military affairs, finance and logistics, and training. The deputy chief of staff for military affairs holds a particularly sensi- tive post and is responsible for planning operations, positioning units, and promulgating doctrine. North Yemen's armed forces have primitive logistic support, maintenance facilities, and command, con- trol, and communications. Military personnel are generally illiterate and undernourished and are poorly trained and led. Nepotism, corruption, and bribery are widespread. 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/05/23: CIA-RDP85T00314R000100010001-0 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/05/23: CIA-RDP85T00314R000100010001-0 Secret Figure 8 Counterinsurgency Successes in North Yemen RMORTS E + 8rim:Islan'd It2E ,recess 1 y autho`itativ Area secured by government, spring/ summer 1982 Former National Democratic Front (NDF)-controlled area secured by government, January 1983 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/05/23: CIA-RDP85T00314R000100010001-0 ^ Table 7 North Yemeni Ground Forces Equipment North Yemen takes recruits at a tender age.

The Army has an estimated active strength of at least 20,000 men; its organizational structure calls for 31,000. There are 11 combat brigades, four combat support brigades, and one airborne brigade. A North Yemeni brigade corresponds roughly in person- nel strength to a US battalion of 800 to 900 men, although strength varies widely from one brigade to another. Two of the brigades are equipped with a mix of Soviet and US equipment, while the remainder are wholly Soviet equipped. Until mid-1982 the bulk of the Army's strength was concentrated in or near the capital. The 7th Armored Brigade, considered by Western observers to be one of the better North Yemeni units, is usually stationed to the north at `Amran to guard against a possible march by northern tribesmen on the capital. 25X1 25X1 25X1 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/05/23: CIA-RDP85T00314R000100010001-0 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/05/23: CIA-RDP85T00314R000100010001-0 Secret Figure 9 Ground Force Deployment in North Yemen Buq',ah AI Khawkhat`t1' ~Al Bay~l SAN AA 1Hizyaz 511 Dhamar i_.

The F-5 fighter program is operated there by the Saudis. In 1983 the Soviets expanded their presence at the base, causing the Saudis to threaten a major cutback or even a cancellation of their Air Force assistance programs. Most of the Soviet-administered programs are run from the airfield near Al Huday- dah Table 9 North Yemen: Naval Forces Osa-II 2 Yevgenya 2 6 Navy. North Yemen's Navy, which is headquartered at Salif, is minuscule. It has 16 ships, only three of which are combatants, and an estimated personnel strength of about 950 men, including 400 marines. The ships-all supplied by the Soviets with the excep- tion of three US-built patrol craft-are poorly main- tained, and the crews are poorly trained. Naval officers, most of whom have had Soviet training, have shown little aptitude for even basic ship handling. F Military Aid. The Soviet Union has provided the bulk of North Yemen's military assistance since 1956. Approximately 400 Soviet military advisers serve in North Yemen, and 1,200 to 1,500 North Yemeni personnel are enrolled in military courses in the USSR. Most Yemeni officers have had at least some training by Soviets. F_~ Saudi Arabia, the United States, Taiwan, Jordan, and Pakistan also provide advisers and/or technical assist- ance.

Approximately 100 Taiwanese technicians are assigned to maintenance duties with North Yemen's F-5 squadron Foreign Relations North Yemen's foreign relations are shaped by its location as well as its political and economic weak- nesses. Over the past 20 years, it has often been caught up in rivalries between regional states as well as between the superpowers. Egypt and Saudi Arabia were contenders during the 1960s, supporting oppos- ing sides in the civil war, until Egypt's defeat in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war forced Cairo to reduce its forces in North Yemen. Today, the Soviets-who regard North Yemen as a vantage from which they can exert pressure on the Saudis-seek to increase their influence in Sanaa at Riyadh's expense To maintain some measure of independence, recent Yemeni leaders have attempted to play off these contending powers. In the process, Sanaa has come to depend heavily on Saudi Arabia for economic assistance and the Soviet Union for military hard- ware. Saudi Arabia. The Saudis regard North Yemen as a buffer against the Marxist regime in South Yemen. They also believe North Yemen could be a threat if a strong and independent regime were to emerge in Sanaa. The North Yemenis have not abandoned claims to territory seized by the Saudis in the 1930s, and the largely undemarcated frontier between the two nations is a potential source of conflict. Of more concern to Riyadh are the potential security problems posed by the more than 600,000 Yemeni workers in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf sheikhdoms Riyadh's policies are designed to maintain leverage over North Yemen's leaders. To enhance their influ- ence, the Saudis provide $400 million in direct gov- ernment-to-government aid as well as private subsi- dies to northern tribal leaders, to President Salih and an assortment of other Yemeni politicians, and to groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood. The Saudis, in particular, regard their aid to the Zaydi tribes as a hedge against the emergence of a radical, leftist regime in Sanaa. offi- cial and private payments combined have amounted in recent years to as much as $1 billion annually. Direct Saudi Government financial aid varies in proportion to Riyadh's concern over security threats to Sanaa, particularly from South Yemen. Hence, the Saudis were more willing to help Sanaa in early 1982 at the height of the NDF offensive than they are now that this threat has receded. The Saudis also occasion- ally hint at cutbacks in their assistance in an effort to force Sanaa to reduce the number of Soviet military advisers in its armed forces. The Saudis deeply distrust Salih and have searched for a candidate with acceptable conservative creden- tials whom they can back as a replacement. Yemenis, for their part, strongly resent Riyadh's heavyhanded 25X1 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/05/23: CIA-RDP85T00314R000100010001-0 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/05/23: CIA-RDP85T00314R000100010001-0 Secret Figure 10 North Yemen: Arms Sales by Suppliers' 1975-77 Average annual sales: $82 billion Others-3 1 States-53 Others-3- ---\\ States-15 Others-2-11 States-10 a In current US dollars. b Information available as of July 1982. meddling in their affairs. Salih, in fact, has won a measure of respect domestically by resisting Saudi pressures while exploiting Riyadh's security concerns to obtain the financial aid he needs to stay in power. Other Arab States. Sanaa seeks to remain on good terms with both conservative and radical Arab states to gain financial aid and political support. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have provided substantial developmental assistance to keep Sanaa on a stable and moderate course. In 1981 Abu Dhabi's Arab Economic Development Fund loaned $37.5 million, and in 1982 Kuwait loaned $35 million. Kuwait also played an active role in mediating the withdrawal of South Yemeni forces from the North in 1979. North Yemen remains grateful for Baghdad's help in ending the 1979 conflict with South Yemen. In return, Sanaa, in 1982 and 1983, sent regulars and volunteers to fight on Iraq's side against Iran. Sanaa made the gesture in the vain hope of obtaining at least some of Iraq's promised financial assistance of $400 million. 1978-80 Average annual sales: $379 million 1981 Total: $184 millionb Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/05/23: CIA-RDP85T00314R000100010001-0 Jordan organized and trained North Yemen's military intelligence and military security services. Almost all intelligence officers are graduates of Jordan's Bir al- Roman intelligence school North Yemen views Egypt as a potential counter- weight to South Yemen and Saudi Arabia and has quietly lobbied for Cairo's return to the Arab fold. On a more practical level, Egypt has been a source of military spare parts and munitions. It also provides approximately 13,000 schoolteachers to North Ye- men Palestinians. Sanaa extended full diplomatic status to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in Janu- ary 1982, and the government is viscerally anti-Israel. Salih derives political capital from his largely symbol- ic support of the Palestinian cause, embellishing his revolutionary credentials by stressing the kinship of 25X1 25X1 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/05/23: CIA-RDP85T00314R000100010001-0 the Yemeni and Palestinian revolutions. Sanaa is suspicious of radical PLO factions that have close ties with Aden and supports the more conservative Yasir Arafat and Fatah. Soviet Union. North Yemen views Moscow as a counterweight to Saudi influence. Moscow seems content to slowly expand its military aid programs, hoping thereby to anchor its influence and ultimately to encourage the emergence of a sympathetic leftist regime in Sanaa. The Soviets probably also believe that an expanded presence in North as well as South Yemen will encourage other Arabian Peninsula states, in particular Saudi Arabia, to seek a political accommodation with Moscow Diplomatic relations with the USSR date from 1928 but became close in the mid-1950s when Moscow provided North Yemen with its first modern military equipment. In late 1967, during the civil war, the USSR earned the gratitude of Yemeni republicans by mounting a massive airlift to help lift the royalist siege of Sanaa and by flying bombing missions against the royalists. After the civil war ended in 1970, relations with the USSR alternately warmed and cooled. They took a dramatic turn for the better in 1979 when Sanaa, unable to get all the arms it wanted from Saudi Arabia, accepted a $750 million arms offer from Moscow. Moscow currently provides North Yemen with approximately 400 military and 100 to 200 civilian advisers. Moscow's limited economic assistance is funneled into showy projects such as the Bajil cement plant, the Sanaa airport, Al Hudaydah port and airport facili- ties, and the \"Revolution\" Hospital in Sanaa. Approx- imately 750 civilian Yemenis are studying in the USSR. Many returnees are employed by the Informa- tion Ministry, which takes a decidedly pro-Soviet line. President Salih values Soviet aid but also views Moscow as a potential threat. He rebuffed Soviet offers to expand naval facilities. North Yemen also has begun isolating Soviet advisers in a central com- pound near Sanaa to facilitate monitoring and to limit unofficial contacts. China. North Yemenis have a high regard for the work of the 3,500-man Chinese economic assistance team, the largest foreign assistance mission in the country. Chinese aid is channeled through two Chi- nese-owned construction firms, which built the Sanaa textile mill, the Ta'izz hospital, and several major highways and redeveloped and expanded Sanaa air- port and its access roads. Chinese personnel operate the hospital at Al Hudaydah Western Europe. Sanaa looks to Western Europe for political support and economic assistance: ? In 1982 Bonn forgave a $110 million loan, and Rome provided approximately $60 million in grants and loans. ? Sanaa has encouraged the Italian firm AGIP to explore for oil off the Tihamah. ? Great Britain helped establish and train North Yemen's National Security Organization US Interests US interests in North Yemen center largely on containing the Soviet presence and potential threat to Saudi Arabia and the other oil-producing states of the Arabian Peninsula. The United States provides mili- tary and economic aid to the Sanaa government in close coordination with the Saudis, although its inter- ests are not necessarily congruent with those of Riyadh. The North Yemenis, bitter at Saudi policies that undercut the Sanaa regime, would prefer to develop ties with the United States free of any Saudi connec- tion. President Salih has long complained that most US assistance, such as the $390 million arms package in 1979, is actually financed by the Saudis, giving Riyadh a veto over what North Yemen obtains from the United States. Salih probably believes that by seeking better rela- tions with the United States he can also stimulate the Soviets to be more generous in providing assistance. Indeed, shortly after the US-North Yemeni agricul- tural deal was concluded in 1982, Moscow apparently agreed to reschedule an old debt.

On 19 December 1962, three months after the officers' coup that overthrew the Imamate, Washing- ton recognized the new Yemen Arab Republic. Less than five years later (6 June 1967), however, the Sanaa regime, angry at US support for Israel during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, severed relations with Washington. Full diplomatic ties were restored after a visit by the US Secretary of State to Sanaa in 1972. US Embassy and AID personnel in North Yemen number under 100. The Department of Defense main- tains a small Military Training Mission of just under 30, which is supplemented by training teams sent out from the United States on temporary duty. A small number of US citizens are employed by the North Yemeni Government, and the Peace Corps has about 50 volunteers in the country. Medical services are provided by the American Baptist-operated hospi- tal and clinic in Ta'izz. Approximately 1,850 nonoffi- cial US citizens reportedly receive social security payments, although the actual number of US citizens living in North Yemen may be considerably higher. Most reside in the area east of Ibb, which traditional- ly has supplied emigrants to the Yemeni colony in the United States (50,000 to 60,000, concentrated mainly in Detroit and San Francisco). US educational opportunities are eagerly sought after by Yemenis. Approximately 215 are currently study- ing in the United States, most with US Government funding. (US AID annually offers 60 scholarships for Yemenis to study in the United States.) The Fulbright Program provides for 13 Yemenis in US graduate schools as well as a US professor at Sanaa University and several field researchers. The Consortium for International Development, American University, and Eastern Michigan University provide US experts to staff development projects in North Yemen. In 1980 and 1981 the US share of the North Yemen import/export market amounted to only about 2 percent in each category. In 1982, however, Wash- ington extended $63 million in credit to Sanaa for the purchase of agricultural commodities, which could increase US exports to North Yemen. No US or North Yemeni air carriers have regularly scheduled flights between the two countries. There is only one direct shipping connection per month be- tween the United States and North Yemen, making 25X1 US goods generally unattractive to North Yemeni importers. US investment in North Yemen is minimal and unlikely to increase so long as North Yemen remains financially unsound and the government cannot end its chronic budget deficits. A US oil company is exploring for oil in the Ma'rib-Al Jawf region. Oppor- tunities for small ventures, especially in the import business, are available.

Aden, so far, has discovered no significant deposits of commercially exploitable minerals and only small quantities of crude oil. Less than 1 percent of the area is cultivable. Low productivity levels are the norm and result from such factors as inefficient management and inade- quate equipment. South Yemen has a substantial fishing potential that could become an important North Yemen. About one-third of the 410,000-person labor force is working abroad, mostly in the Arab Gulf states. Moreover, most are the more skilled workers, leaving behind a largely untrained work force. Partly because of the labor migration, South Yemen cannot build all of its planned projects. Real 25X1 growth in 1983 probably will be only slightly better 25X1 economic asset. South Yemen has a centrally planned economy with an established bureaucracy to administer the system. Government ownership predominates, especially in industry and fishing. The Ministry of Planning has overall responsibility for implementing economic guidelines established within the framework of a five- year plan. Despite comprehensive government plan- ning and control, the private sector plays an important role in the economy. Private enterprises, mostly in the domestic trade and transport sectors, account for roughly half the economy's output. Aden is pursuing a strategy of rapid economic growth. The Second Five-Year Plan (1981-85) sets an overly ambitious spending level of $1.2 billion, more than double actual expenditures under the previous plan. The broad objectives of the plan include development of the agricultural and industrial sectors, which to- gether would account for over 50 percent of total government spending. The plan also focuses on infra- structure spending, especially for housing, transporta- tion, and electric power. The regime plans to expand the fishing sector by upgrading shore facilities, boats, and equipment. Several obstacles preclude plan fulfillment. Extensive flooding during March-April 1982 caused massive damage to the agricultural sector. As a result, Aden probably will have to scale back its development program to help cover repair costs that could reach about $1 billion, according to unofficial estimates in than last year's 3.5 percent as Aden adjusts its spending plans to compensate for these problems To augment the development process, the government is encouraging limited development of the private sector in some areas such as light industry. Although the five-year plan nominally deemphasizes the private sector, Aden passed a law in 1981 to provide incen- tives to private and foreign investors to participate in development projects-including tax exemptions, credit access, and exemption from some import duties. Agriculture. The agricultural sector, including fisher- ies, is the most important segment of the economy, providing work for nearly 45 percent of South Ye- men's labor force. A well-developed water conserva- tion system allows South Yemen to partly overcome its environmental handicaps. Nevertheless, agricultur- al output accounts for only about 13 percent of GNP, and, as a result, farm income is at the subsistence level. Moreover, domestic food production has not been able to keep pace with growing consumption, forcing the regime to import roughly two-thirds of its food requirements. Aden plans to continue investing in agriculture to boost food output. Since the mid-1970s the regime has spent over $230 million on various agricultural schemes. During the current five-year plan, the gov- ernment expects to start irrigation projects in the Nisab and Wadi Mirka areas and an agricultural project at Wadi Bayhan. Aden also has established an agricultural f"
