        "text": "The purpose of this study was to examine the determinants of the exchange rate this study was set to analyze the Exchange Rate determinates in Somalia in due to 2011. There are two factors that are assumed to have strong relations with exchange. Descriptive and regression analysis was used to draw up the satisfactory conclusion. SOS-1 and SOS-2 were determinants of exchange rate. The findings of this study showing that Somalia exchange rate is strongly affected by the above mentioned factor. This can observed from R squared that indicates 96% of the variation in exchange rate is explained by variation in independent variables. Speculators should eye on these factors to minimize the exchange fluctuation. Key words: exchange rate, SOS-1, SOS-2\n\nLiterature effect of exchange rate fluctuations is caused by some macroeconomic variables but there have not enough study in this important field. Our purpose was to generalize the main factors behind exchange rate fluctuations of Bangladesh from 1987-2017. We used ADF and PP test for stationary analysis that is unit root test satisfied preconditions for Johansen co-integrating test. Correlation matrix shows the relationships of independent variables with dependent one and agreed with FMOLS test. We find no serial correlation in Q-statistics, LM and Heteroscedasticity test. Johansen co-integration test specifies that there are no co-integrating equations for long run relationship rather the relationship is short run. VAR model and Ganger causality test shows there is a significant effect of Remittance, GDP growth and International trade to Exchange rate fluctuations because R-squared values are more than 60%. Wald test supports the VAR model results by ensuring that there also joint effect of independent variables. Results from FMOLS test concluded that GDP growth and International trade positively affect exchange rate. Remittance has negative effect on exchange rate. Finally, we can say that rise in GDP growth and international trade, increase the exchange rate volatility but rise in Remittance reduces the exchange rate volatility. We found the relevance of this study with existing the literature in its related filed."
