        "text": "Former currency\n\nNorth Yemeni rialريال يمني (Arabic) ISO 4217CodeYERSubunit 0.01DenominationsSubunit 1⁄100filsBanknotes1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 rialCoins1, 5, 10, 25, 50 fils, 1 rialDemographicsUser(s)Kingdom of Yemen\n\nNorth Yemen\n\nYemenIssuanceCentral bankCentral Bank of Yemen Websitewww .centralbank .gov .yeThis infobox shows the latest status before this currency was rendered obsolete.\n\nThe rial or riyal was the currency of North Yemen, first the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen, then the Yemen Arab Republic. It is the predecessor to the modern Yemeni rial.\n\nThe Mutawakkilite Kingdom began issuing coins around the turn of the 20th century. The rial was divided into 160 zalat, 80 halala or 40 buqsha. During the reign of Imam Yahya, the first rial coins were issued. Denominations were given on coins as a fraction of the rial, with the \"honorific\" Imadi appearing on the coins of Imam Yahya and Ahmadi on the coins of Imam Ahmad. Consequently, the currency is sometimes referred to as the \"Imadi rial\" or \"Ahmadi rial\".\n\nA modern-style coinage was introduced into circulation in 1963, following the establishment of the Yemen Arab Republic. The country was one of the last to adopt a decimal currency system. In 1974 the rial was divided into 100 fils, although inflation caused the fils denominations to disappear from circulation.\n\nAfter the unification of Yemen, the Yemeni rial replaced the North Yemeni rial at par. Denominations issued by the Yemen Arab Republic ceased to be legal tender afterward.\n\nIn the reign of Imam Yahya (1904-1948), bronze coins were issued for the 1 zalat, 1 halala and 1 buqsha denominations, and silver coins for the 1 buqsha, 1⁄20, 1⁄10, 1⁄8, 1⁄4 and 1 rial denominations. During the reign of Imam Yahya's successor, Imam Ahmad (1948-1962), the silver 1 buqsha and 1⁄20 rial were discontinued, and 1⁄16 and 1⁄2 rial coins were introduced. Unusually, the 1⁄16 and 1⁄8 rial coins were pentagonal.\n\nGold coins denominated in guineas were also minted, primarily for presentation purposes.\n\nIn 1962, the Arab Republic first issued bronze 1⁄2 and 1 buqsha, 1⁄20, 1⁄10, 2⁄10 and 1⁄4 rial in a similar style to those of the last king. These were followed in 1963 by a new coinage, consisting of aluminium-bronze 1⁄2, 1, and 2 buqsha and silver 5, 10 and 20 buqsha and 1 rial coins.\n\nIn 1974, decimalized coinage was introduced, consisting of aluminium 1 fils, brass 5 and 10 fils coins, and cupro-nickel 25 and 50 fils coins. Cupro-nickel 1 rial coins followed in 1976.\n\nIn 1964, the government introduced North Yemen's first paper money, which consisted of 1, 5, and 10 rial notes. These were followed by 10 and 20 buqsha notes in 1966, revised 1, 5, and 10 rial notes in 1969, and 20 and 50 rial notes on 13 May 1971.\n\nThe Central Bank of Yemen was established on 27 July 1971, with its headquarters in Sana'a, the capital of the Arab Republic of Yemen. The Central Bank of Yemen absorbed the functions of the Yemen Currency Board. When the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen) and the Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen) united on 22 May 1990 to form the Republic of Yemen, the north's Central Bank of Yemen merged with the south's Bank of Yemen, and the joint venture continued to use the name Central Bank of Yemen.[1]\n\nDenomination Color Front Back Issue Date Size Signature 1964 - 1967 issues[1] 1 Rial Green Coat of arms al-Musa mosque in Sana'a 08 Feb 1964 126 x 65 mm Signed by Abdul Ghani Ali with two different titles: Minister of the Treasury (1964 issue) or Minister of the Treasury and Economy (1967 reissue) 5 Rials Red Coat of arms Statue of Lion of Timna 14 Feb 1964 135 x 70 mm 10 Rials Blue-grey Coat of arms Dam 14 Feb 1964 146 x 75 mm 1966 - 1971 issues[1] 10 Buqshas Orange-brown Statue of Lion of Timna Dedication stone from Barran temple 21 Feb 1966 126 x 65 mm Signed by Ahmad al-Ruhumi as Minister of the Treasury. 20 Buqshas Green Statue of a head Ruins of Bara'an Temple 21 Feb 1966 126 x 65 mm 1 Rial Green Statue of a head al-Musa mosque in Sana'a 08 Apr 1969 126 x 65 mm Signed by Ahmad Abdu Said as Minister of the Treasury and Economy. 5 Rials Red Lion head sculpture Statue of Lion of Timna 08 Apr 1969 136 x 70 mm 10 Rials Blue-grey al-Shadhili mosque Dam 08 Apr 1969 136 x 70 mm 20 Rials Purple, blue, yellow, pink Palace on the rock at Dar al-Hajar Skyline of Sana'a 13 May 1971 147 x 65 mm 50 Rials Green, yellow, pink, blue Crossed jambiyas Coffee beans and mountain range 13 May 1971 147 x 65 mm\n\nValue Obverse Reverse 1 rial"
