        "meta_description": "Currency exchange rate is an important metric to inform economic policy but traditional sources are often produced with delay during crises and only at an aggregate level. This may poorly reflect the actual rate trends in rural or poverty-stricken areas, where large populations reside in fragile situations.                     This data set includes currency exchange rate estimates and is intended to help gain insight in price developments beyond what can be formally measured by traditional methods. The estimates are generated using a machine-learning approach that imputes ongoing subnational price surveys, often with accuracy similar to direct measurement of prices. The data set provides new opportunities to investigate local price dynamics in areas where populations are sensitive to localized price shocks and where traditional data are not available.",
