        "text": "AL-MUKALLA: The Yemeni riyal on Tuesday broke a record of 1,630 per dollar, moving closer to its all-time low of 1,700 in government-controlled areas.\n\nLocal money dealers said the Yemeni riyal was exchanged at 1,632 against the dollar in Aden, Yemen’s interim capital, and other government-controlled areas, up from 1,500 riyals a few months earlier.\n\nThe Yemeni riyal fell to a historic low of 1,540 against the dollar in government-controlled territory in November, after hovering around 1,200 against the dollar since the creation of the internationally recognized Presidential Leadership Council in April 2022.\n\nIt fell to an all-time low of 1,700 per dollar in December 2021, compared to 250 in early 2015.\n\nThis week, the Yemeni government in Aden set up a committee to address the riyal’s recent decline.\n\nDuring previous rounds of currency depreciation, Yemen’s Aden-based central bank closed unlicensed exchange firms, held public auctions to sell hard currency to local traders, replaced the unofficial remittance system between exchange companies, and requested that authorized exchange firms and banks send their financial statements to the bank.\n\nAll steps have failed to stop the decline of the Yemeni riyal.\n\nOnly billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and the UAE in financial packages and deposits into Aden’s central bank have enabled the Yemeni riyal to rebound briefly before continuing its downward trend.\n\nYemen’s government has long blamed currency speculation by black-market money merchants for the currency’s fast depreciation. It has also cited a full stop in oil exports, the country’s primary source of wealth, following Houthi attacks on oil facilities in October last year as another cause for depreciation.\n\nThe decline of the riyal has raised the cost of necessities like rice, wheat, petrol, and transportation, as well as sparked violent demonstrations in Aden, Al-Mukalla, and other Yemeni cities controlled by the government.\n\nYemeni experts believe the recent fast depreciation of the currency is unsurprising given the central bank’s depletion of hard currency reserves and the Yemeni government’s failure to regulate the black market.\n\nThe director of the Studies and Economic Media Center, Mustafa Nasr, told Arab News on Tuesday that the Yemeni riyal would continue to fall in the upcoming months if the current circumstances persisted, including the sharp decline in the government’s earnings from oil exports, tax and customs collections, as well as its inability to control the black market.\n\nNasr added that if the central bank had kept printing new notes, the riyal would have reached its all-time low of 1,700 earlier.\n\n“Given these difficulties, which align with a condition of speculation by powerful and wealthy money changers, it is not shocking that the value of the riyal declined to more than 1,600 riyals per dollar,” Nasr said.\n\nTEL AVIV: The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility on Monday for a bomb blast near a synagogue in Tel Aviv that Israeli police and the Shin Bet intelligence agency described as a terrorist attack.\n\nA man who was carrying the bomb was killed and a passerby was injured in the incident late on Sunday, according to police at the scene.\n\nIn their statement the Brigades added that their “martyrdom operations” inside Israel would return to the forefront as long as the “occupation’s massacres and assassination policy continue” — an allusion to Israel’s offensive in Gaza and the July 31 killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\nIsrael has neither claimed nor denied responsibility for Haniyeh’s death in the Iranian capital.\n\nThe war in Gaza began on Oct. 7 last year when Hamas gunmen stormed across the border into Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and abducting about 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael’s military campaign has since levelled wide swathes of the Gaza Strip and killed at least 40,000 people, according to the enclave’s health authorities.\n\nSunday’s explosion in Tel Aviv came about an hour after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv to push for a ceasefire in Gaza to end the 10-month-old war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThere has been increased urgency to reach a ceasefire deal amid fears of an escalation across the wider region. Iran has threatened to retaliate against Israel after the assassination of Haniyeh.\n\nDUBAI: The Iran-backed Houthi militia has recruited as many as 10,000 children since the start of the conflict in Yemen in 2014, say human rights groups.\n\nAccording to the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor and SAM Organization for Rights and Freedoms, a civil rights organization in Yemen, the recruitment took place between 2014 and 2021.\n\nA report by Human Rights Watch said the majority of recruits were between 13 and 25 years old, including hundreds — possibly thousands — below the age of 18.\n\nMedia releases from the Houthis’ official news outlet, SabaNet, about the militias’ recent recruitment show people who appear to be children. The UN has investigated at least 1,851 individual cases of child recruitment or use by the Houthis since 2010, the report added.\n\nSince 2011, the Houthis have featured on the UN secretary-general’s annual list of groups responsible for grave violations against children in armed conflicts.\n\nInitially listed for their recruitment and use of child soldiers, since 2016 it has also been included for killing and maiming children and for attacks against schools and hospitals."
