        "text": "ALEXANDRIA: Yemen’s currency on Thursday reached a new low after the Iran-backed Houthi militia renewed its ban on banknotes printed by the Yemeni government and banned people from moving cash from government-controlled areas to their territories, Yemeni officials and economists said.\n\nLocal currency dealers said the Yemeni riyal traded at 940 against the US dollar in the black market on Thursday compared to 930 last week, shortly after the Houthi-controlled Central Bank in Sanaa circulated an order that warned people against using new money that looks like the old banknotes available in their territories.\n\nTo evade the Houthi ban and address the shortage of cash in the market, the Aden-based Central Bank of Yemen has recently pumped into the market billions of large 1,000-riyal banknotes similar to the banknotes used by the Houthis.\n\nLocal media reported that the Houthis stepped up security at their checkpoints, searching for the new banknotes.\n\nOn Thursday, Hamed Rezq, a journalist loyal to the Houthis, accused the US of launching an economic war on the Yemeni economy by allowing printing and circulating new banknotes.\n\n“This is part of the US economic war on Yemen after Washington ran out of military options and (its) deception and political pressures have failed,” he tweeted.\n\nIn December 2019, the Houthis banned the use of banknotes printed by the legitimate and internationally recognized government, giving residents a month to hand over their cash or face punishment.\n\nThe Houthi decision sparked outrage across Yemen, pushed up transfer charges from government-controlled areas to Houthi-ruled areas, and led to a halt in the payment of salaries to thousands of public servants.\n\nTravelers from government-controlled areas to Sanaa told Arab News that they were forced into buying Saudi riyals or exchanging the new banknotes with old ones at inflated prices.\n\nEconomists are now warning that the Houthis will use the latest measures to snoop into exchange firms and people’s lives.\n\n“This step will allow the Houthi group to interfere more in the work of banks, exchange companies and even ordinary citizens. Using its security grip, the group will find a justification for confiscating money and interfering in people's privacy in search of ‘fake currency’ as it describes it,” Mustafa Nasr, director of the Economic Media Center, said.\n\nHe added that the current economic war between the legitimate government and the Houthis would have implications on the country’s troubled economy and people’s lives.\n\nNasr also criticized the Yemeni government for printing money without coverage and its loose grip on the exchange market in the liberated provinces.\n\n“The injection of the new cash by the Central Bank aggravates the problem in terms of inflation and it weakens the currency,” he said, advising the government to increase revenues and curb speculative activities by local money dealers in areas under its control.\n\n“The fall of the riyal in areas under the control of the legitimate government is caused by currency speculation and corruption, not due to a real demand for currency,” Nasr said.\n\nRIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s holdings of US Treasury bonds increased to $140.3 billion in June, reflecting a 26.73 percent year-on-year rise.\n\nData from the US Treasury Department showed the Kingdom maintained its position as the 17th largest holder of these securities, which are known for their stability and liquidity.\n\nSaudi Arabia and other nations invest in these bonds for their safety, diversification benefits, and alignment with their economic relationships with the US.\n\nThe Kingdom is the only Arab nation among the top 20 holders of US Treasury securities.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s June holdings were also up month on month, with the May figure standing at $136.3 billion.\n\nThis increase highlights Saudi Arabia’s expanding influence in global financial markets and its strategic use of sovereign wealth to bolster its economic standing. The rise in US Treasury holdings aligns with the Kingdom’s financial strategy to diversify investments beyond oil revenues.\n\nThis growth in Saudi Arabia’s holdings reflects a broader pattern seen across the Gulf Cooperation Council nations, where other member states have also maintained substantial investments in US Treasury securities.\n\nThe UAE held $65.2 billion in US Treasury bonds as of June, demonstrating a slight decrease from the $66.5 billion it held in May.\n\nKuwait has maintained a steady presence in the US Treasury market, with its holdings standing at $50.8 billion in June.\n\nThis figure is consistent with previous months, indicating a stable investment strategy that prioritizes steady returns and minimal risk exposure.\n\nOman and Qatar, though smaller in scale compared to their GCC counterparts, also contribute to the region’s collective investment in US Treasury bonds.\n\nOman’s holdings were recorded at approximately $7.6 billion in June, while Qatar’s holdings reached around $7.4 billion during the same period.\n\nBahrain also participated in this trend, though its holdings are more modest. As of June, its investments in US Treasury bonds were valued at $1.2 billion.\n\nThe data collected is primarily from US-based custodians and broker-dealers. Since American securities held in overseas accounts may not be attributed to the actual owners, the department said, the data may not provide a precise accounting of individual country ownership of treasury securities.\n\nRIYADH: Negotiations are underway between Cenomi Retail and a top fashion retailer for a significant transaction that could involve the merger of several commercial agencies.\n\nThis move by the prominent player in Saudi Arabia’s retail landscape represents a strategic effort by Cenomi to expand its influence within the rapidly growing fashion industry.\n\nTo navigate this complex negotiation, Cenomi has appointed Lazard as its financial adviser, while legal guidance will be provided by Abuhimed, Al-Sheikh, and Al-Hagbani Clifford Chance.\n\nThe involvement of these reputable advisers underscores the significance of the transaction, which could reshape the competitive landscape of the Kingdom’s retail sector, the company said in a release on the Saudi Stock Exchange, Tadawul.\n\nCenomi further emphasized that any updates on the transaction will be disclosed in line with regulatory requirements, underscoring its commitment to transparency and compliance.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s fashion market is experiencing rapid transformation, driven by the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 initiative, which aims to diversify the economy and boost non-oil sectors. The retail industry, particularly fashion, has seen a surge in consumer demand and international interest.\n\nThe Saudi market has recently attracted global brands like Harvey Nichols, which expanded its presence with new stores in Riyadh, and Valentino, which launched flagship locations to cater to the growing demand for luxury fashion.\n\nCompanies like Cenomi Retail are at the forefront of this shift, seeking to leverage global partnerships and mergers to enhance their market share and meet the growing appetite for high-quality fashion brands among Saudi consumers.\n\nThis potential merger reflects broader trends in the market, where local retailers are increasingly aligning with global giants to stay competitive and cater to an evolving customer base.\n\nIn 2021, Alhokair, which owns Cenomi, also acquired a 51 percent stake in VogaCloset, a UK-based online fashion platform, to tap into the booming e-commerce segment in the region. This merger demonstrated the increasing importance of online retail and the strategic moves by Saudi companies to integrate digital platforms into their business models.\n\nCenomi Retail’s current negotiations for a potential merger align with these trends, indicating the company’s intent to leverage global partnerships to meet the evolving demands of Saudi consumers.\n\nRIYADH: A total of 505 new firms were registered on the Qatar Financial Centre platform in the first half of 2024, up 230 percent year on year, new data revealed.\n\nA QFC mid-year progress review disclosed that this rise brings the total number of firms on its platform to over 2,200, Qatar News Agency reported.\n\nThe data further showed that the tech sector accounted for the largest share of registered businesses, contributing to almost 38 percent.\n\nThis representation is mainly due to QFC’s strong presence at the Web Summit 2024 in Doha in February, where the company offered special incentives for companies registering during the event.\n\nThe rise also came as part of QFC’s efforts to further boost the inflow of foreign investments, diversify the economy, and position the country as a leading tech hub in the region.\n\nThe QFC data also indicated that the financial services sector accounted for 10 percent of the total number of new firms that joined the center’s platform in the first six months of 2024.\n\nThe majority of these businesses came from the UK, France, and Jordan, as well as India and the US, and represent a diverse range of industries, including advisory services, fintech, IT, and innovation.\n\nThe first half of 2024 also saw QFC entering into various partnerships and collaboration agreements, forging 12 memorandums of understanding with prominent local and international organizations.\n\nAmong them are Masraf Al Rayan, MEEZA QSTP, and Hashgraph Association as well as the Chartered Institute for Securities and Investment, the Financial Services Development Council of Hong Kong, and the Canadian Arab Business Council.\n\nQFC also signed an MoU with Media City Qatar and a workflow agreement with Qatar Science and Technology Park in an attempt to streamline the business setup process in the country.\n\nDuring the first half of the year, the entity also organized several successful events, most notably the Qatar Financial Markets Forum 2024, held in partnership with Bloomberg to elevate its engagement with local and international business communities.\n\nQFC also hosted an event on wealth management, addressing challenges and spotlighting opportunities in the industry, with a special focus on family businesses in the tiny, gas-rich Gulf nation.\n\nFounded in 2005, QFC offers its own legal, regulatory, tax, and business environment, contributing to the decisive economic development and diversification prescribed by Qatar National Vision 2030.\n\nRIYADH: Saudi Arabia is keen to attract more foreign direct investment from Asia and Europe as the Kingdom continues its economic diversification journey, a minister has said.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC, Saudi Arabia’s Assistant Minister of Investment Ibrahim Al-Mubarak said that the Kingdom is targeting $100 billion in FDI by 2030.\n\nEarlier in August, Saudi Arabia approved an updated investment law aimed at elevating foreign funding inflows into the Kingdom.\n\nAccording to the Kingdom’s National Investment Strategy, key sectors looking to secure funding include energy, construction, and communication, as well as finance, and transportation.\n\n“China is the largest trading partner of Saudi Arabia. But we are still yet to see more on the FDI side from China. The US is also positioning well as a big investor in Saudi Arabia,” said Al-Mubarak.\n\nHe added: “We are looking at expanding that. We are seeing a lot of interest from Asian countries and Europe, and we are capitalizing on those to achieve the targets.”\n\nAl-Mubarak further pointed out that the new investment law in Saudi Arabia is expected to increase FDI inflows in the Kingdom.\n\n“We have SR20 billion ($5.33 billion) in FDI last year, which is a 150 percent increase from 2016. Different studies have shown that 60 percent of our FDI comes from existing investors. I think it is also very important why we are looking at the new investment law and we are broadening the scope for all investors, both domestic and international,” the minister said.\n\nThe updated regulations also promise enhanced protections for investors, including adherence to the rule of law, fair treatment, and property rights, while ensuring robust safeguards for intellectual property and facilitating smooth fund transfers.\n\nDuring the talk, Al-Mubarak noted that the financial sector in Saudi Arabia represents “a huge opportunity” for investors.\n\n“The debt to GDP in Saudi is one of the lowest in G20. The debt capital market is very well underserved. This presents a huge opportunity for financial sector players,” said the assistant minister.\n\nHe added: “Today, the equity capital market in Saudi is 78 percent of the capital in the region. It is also the ninth globally. Our credit rating, by all the rating agencies, is very strong and has a positive outlook. We believe the financial sector is an enabling sector.”"
