The Riyal is the main unit of the currency of Yemen , and the riyal was composed of 100 fils issued by the Central Bank of Yemen and the fils are not traded after the unification of North and South on 22 May 1990 .

The Yemeni rial was the currency of the Arab Republic of Yemen (formerly the northern part of the current and full-fledged state of the Arab League ) in 1962 , and after Yemeni unity became the official currency of the Arab country after the abolition of the southern dinar, which was a stronger currency against the dollar .
