        "text": "November 01, 2019\n\nAfter #Inktober, Finnish cartographer Topi Tjukanov launched #30DayMapChallenge, a challenge to make a different map each day of November.\n\nIâm just going to have a go at this. Iâll probably wont make one each day, but it is a nice occasion to publish some half baked ideas I have lingering on my computer, to learn a thing are two, and most of all, just have some mapping fun :)\n\nSo whenever I make a new map for the challenge, it will be added to this page.\n\nChallenge 30: home\n\nData: Adresses I lived at\n\nTools: I used geojson.io for quick geocoding and composing a geojson file, QGIS for making the map\n\nGoal: I realised already long ago that the places I lived at throughout my life were somehow connected to the Demer river (blue) and the E314 highway (pink). It was finally time to map my homes (circles)s\n\nHow I did it: Layer composing in QGIS, with DEM hillshading and pseudocolor, building outlines, and neon layers for the river and highway\n\nChallenge 29: experimental\n\nData: Belgian municipalities boundary data\n\nTools: R and the sf package\n\nGoal: Experiment\n\nHow I did it: I calculated the centroid of each municipality and then subtracted the centroid coordinates from the polygon coordinates. Then I plotted all the municipalities on top of each other, with varying opacities and different orderings.\n\nChallenge 28: funny\n\nData: EU country boundaries and capital locations\n\nTools: D3\n\nGoal: Change the way you look at Austria, Vienna and Bratislava\n\nHow I did it: I made the map and a reader notified me about the Austrian worm.\n\nChallenge 27: resources\n\nData: EU crop production (Eurostat)\n\nTools: R and the eurostat, sf and ggplot2 packagas\n\nGoal: Show regional distribution of different crops accross Europe, similar to The Herds of Europe\n\nHow I did it: Similar to this tutorial\n\nChallenge 26: hydrology\n\nData: European river catchments\n\nTools: QGIS and Illustrator\n\nGoal: Show European ocean drainage basins (that is probably not the official term) and practice my Text-on-path skills\n\nHow I did it: Colored all the river catchment according to what sea they are flowing to, and added a little outer glow to these. The sea is a very light blue, and land area with no data is shown in light grey (this data comes from Natural Earth). The colors are my Tintin palette. I exported the map from QGIS to Illustrator and added the names of the seas with the Text on path tool.\n\nChallenge 25: climate\n\nData: EDGAR\n\nTools: Datawrapper\n\nGoal: Showing both the differences in per capita CO2 emissions and the total population of countries (but Iâll use any excuse to make cartograms)\n\nHow I did it: The hardest part was matching the country names in the EDGAR data to the names in Datawrapper. The values in the legend are the quartile values\n\nChallenge 24: statistics\n\nData: Gridded population of the world\n\nTools: R, with packages SDMTools, ggplot2 and patchwork\n\nGoal: Make a classic âpopulation by longitude and lattitudeâ map, but for individual countries instead of the whole world.\n\nHow I did it: I used the asc2dataframe() to convert the source files into something I could work with. The source files also contain data about to which country each cell in the population grid belongs, so I used that to filter the data by country. Then I calculated the total population for each row and column in the filtered data, made barcharts with these numbers in ggplot and finally glued the map and the 2 bar charts together with the patchwork package.\n\nChallenge 23: population\n\nData: nationalities by neighbourhood from Wijkmonitoring.brussels\n\nTools: R, with packages sf, ggplot2 and tricolore\n\nGoal: Make my first ternary map\n\nHow I did it: Apart from some data preparation, I basically followed this vignette, changing the Tricolore function to the TricoloreSextant function.\n\nChallenge 22: built environment\n\nData: 3D GRB, a dataset containing the outline and height of every building in Flanders. I also reused the 5 meter DEM from challenge 11.\n\nTools: QGIS and the Qgis2threejs plugin\n\nGoal: Make something cool in 3D ;)\n\nHow I did it: The base layer is the DEM with both hillshading and mapping elevation to color. The height of the buildings is the maximum heights of the buildings.\n\nStatic (the buildings heights are exaggerated here, but I love how you can see the Citadel towering above the city. And my new house is somewhere in here!):\n\nSee the interactive version here (be warned: this is a heavy page :)\n\nChallenge 21: environment\n\nData: Biologische waarderingskaart 2018, a dataset assigning an ecological value to all non-built up plot in Flanders. Iâve always wondered how they construct and update this data set\n\nTools: QGIS\n\nGoal: I wanted to recreate the official color legend for this data. In the end, I changed it considerably, but I learned a lot about making hased textures in QGIS.\n\nHow I did it: Like in challenge 20, I used an inverted polygon to mask out everything outside of my municipality. After that, it was all about configuring the color and the hashing. I also added a building outline layer to give some context.\n\nChallenge 20: rural\n\nData: Agricultural plots in Flanders, a dataset I worked a lot with in my early carreer as an agricultural economist. The most recent publicly available data set seems to date from 2013.\n\nTools: QGIS\n\nGoal: Just a quick map of the different crops on the fields in my own municipality\n\nHow I did it: One of the tricks I learned during the #30DayMapChallenge is that you can invert polygons in QGIS. So I used that to mask the plots outside of my municipality.\n\nChallenge 19: urban\n\nData: I had no inspiration for this challenge, so I want strolling through the âdataâ folder on my computer and stumbled accross âdata/citiesâ. It contained some Excel files I had forgotten about, containing the population and location of cities world wide between 1500 and 2000, in 50 year intervals. I need to look up the source of this data.\n\nTools: R to process the data, ggplot for making the maps, GIMP for making the gif\n\nGoal: Show the growth of cities worldwide over time\n\nHow I did it: The map is a simple ggplot with a geom_point() layer and coord_map(). I generated 1 map for each year in the data, opened them as layers in GIMP and exported the layers as an animated gif, with 800 milliseconds between the frames.\n\nChallenge 18: globe\n\nData: Detailed air passenger transport by reporting country and routes from Eurostat. The data with the locations of the airports was already on my hard drive, donât remember where I got it fromâ¦\n\nTools: R to get and process the data, Flourish to visualise it\n\nGoal: Show how European airports are connected\n\nHow I did it: I downloaded all the country data files with the eurostat R package and combined everything into one file. Then I uploaded the route data and the airport locations to the Flourish Connections Globe template and configured the map in there.\n\nFlourish has another template that uses the same data structure: the Arc map. So I also made one of those with the data. I actually like that one better, but it is not a globe, so Â¯_(ã)_/Â¯\n\nChallenge 17: zones\n\nData: 1 km population grid of the Belgian census 2011 and Flemish government building outline data\n\nTool: QGIS\n\nGoal: Show the crowded area the Doel nuclear power plant is located\n\nHow I did it: I took the location of the power plant from Wikipedia and quickly made geojson file from it in geojson.io. Opened the file in QGIS and generated a 10 km and 20 km buffer around it. Then I added the population grid and styled the grid cells with a white outline and made sure that only the ones containing more than 500 people are visible. Lastly, I added the building outlines to show built up areas.\n\nChallenge 16: places\n\nData: Natural Earth administrative boundaries\n\nTool: QGIS\n\nGoal: Show all the countries I havenât visited yet\n\nHow I did it: Just deleted all the countries I visited from the Natural Earth data set\n\nChallenge 15: names\n\nData:: Baby names by municipality and first names by municipality (I used the 2017 data for both)\n\nTool: Some R for data preparation, QGIS for the maps\n\nGoal: Show geographical distributions of first names in Belgium, both for new borns as for total population\n\nHow I did it: I calculated the most common first names for each municipality in R, exported this data as csv, loaded it into QGIS and then joined it to the municipal boundaries. The first name labels on the map have a buffer (so they stand out), and some labels are not displayed to ensure no overlapping labels. I didnât add titles, but I guess you can identify male versus female names and new born versus total :)\n\nChallenge 14: boundaries\n\nData: Municipal boundaries of Belgium, and a self drawn line\n\nTool: QGIS\n\nGoal: Showing the complexity of the boundaries of the municipality of Baarle-Hertog\n\nChallenge 13: tracks\n\nData: My own Runkeeper tracked runs\n\nTool: The Strava R package by Marcus Volz, ggplot2, Illustrater and AI2html\n\nGoal: Show my running habits over the (almost) last 5 years\n\nHow I did it: I downloaded my data from Runkeeper and generated the small multiple tracks from it with the Strava package and ggplot, based on this script (I set the colors to represent the distance ran). I imported the generated png file in Adobe Illustrator and added all the annotions (browsing my running history was a lot of fun!). Then I used AI2html to generate the image with the annotations overlayed as html and css.\n\nSee the full piece here (zoom your browser if the font is too small, sorry for that)\n\nChallenge 12: movement\n\nData: TravelTime Platform\n\nTool: TravelTime Platform app\n\nGoal: comparing how far I can travel in 1 hour by 3 modes of transport, starting from my local train station\n\nHow I did it: I just used the nice TravelTime Platform app (which has a very nice UI, I think)\n\nChallenge 11: elevation\n\nData: Digitaal Hoogtemodel Vlaanderen II, DTM, raster, 1 m\n\nTool: QGIS\n\nGoal: Showing one of the most spectacular geographical features of my region: the Flemish spoil tips\n\nHow I did it: The terrain is a digital elevation model with a resolution of 1 meter, which I used to create the hillshade in QGIS. A duplicate of the layer is used for the colors, which maps the elevation to the PuOr diverging color scale. The contour lines are generated from a dem with a 5 meter resolution, with the Raster => Extraction => Contour tool in QGIS. I removed all contour lines not directly on the spoil tips, and labelled them with their elevation. The titles were added in Illustrator.\n\nHi-res versions\n\nChallenge 10: black and white\n\nData: OpenStreetMap\n\nTool: Figuregrounder\n\nGoal: Comparing streets layout and built up area in cities of which the names start with a âBâ\n\nHow I did it: Just search the map, center it, and select a circle radius. I used 2km for all the maps.\n\nChallenge 9: yellow\n\nData: OpenStreetMap\n\nTool: Mapbox\n\nGoal: Make a yellow map of the Belgian municipality of Geel, which name means âyellowâ in Dutch\n\nHow I did it: With the Mapbox monochrome styling. See the interactive map here.\n\nChallenge 8: green\n\nData: Trees in public space in Antwerp\n\nTool: QGIS\n\nGoal: Finally making one of those cÌ¶lÌ¶iÌ¶cÌ¶hÌ¶Ã©Ì¶ classic tree maps\n\nHow I did it: The geo portal serving the data had a little difficulty giving me the data, so I reached out to the people managing the Antwerp geoportal. They sent me this wonderfull data set over email. Iâll probably make a proper interactive âTrees of Antwerpâ map later. Here\n\neach shade of green is different genus of trees\n\nsize of the tree crowns are proportional to stem diameters\n\nI added some shadow under the trees to make them stand out\n\nInspiration: Iâve always wanted to replicate one of my most fav maps ever: Trees of TÃ¼rkenschanzpark by Markus Mayr\n\nChallenge 7: red\n\nData: NOAA Gridded Global Temperature\n\nTool:: R/ggplot2\n\nGoal: Make a HovmÃ¶ller diagram of average global temperature over time, by longitude and latitude\n\nHow I did it: The hardes part was converting the source data into something to work with. After that, I used ggplotâs geom_tile() to make the plots, and geom_vline() and geom_hline() to add the prime meridian and the equator\n\nChallenge 6: blue\n\nData: DEM Flanders 25 meter and Vlaamse Hydrografische Atlas\n\nTool: QGIS\n\nGoal: Showing the Flemish hydrography, in a blue fashion. (Yes, Flemish: notice the hole that is Brussels on the map. For many of the government data in my country, you need to consult 3 different government agencies (Flemish, Brussels and Walloon), and the data will most likely not be comparable, if it exist at all)\n\nHow I did it: A digital elevation model with a blue color gradient, with dark blue meaning lower elevation, underneath the waterways, of which the thickness is scaled to their importance.\n\nYou can find a higher resolution version of the map here.\n\nChallenge 5: raster\n\nIâm cheating a little bit with this challenge: this is something that was published over a week ago :)\n\nData: Luchtfoto Vlaanderen 1971, zomer - zwart-wit\n\nTool: Mapbox\n\nGoal: Comparing aerial imagery from almost 50 years ago to todayâs. The map was part of a series of articles by Flemish newspaper De Standaard on the poor spatial planning in Flanders.\n\nHow I did it: read all about it in the making of post\n\nChallenge 4: hexagons\n\nData: World War II THOR Database\n\nTool: R/ggplot2, GIMP to make the animated gif\n\nGoal: show the shifting front and the intensification of allied bombings during World War II\n\nHow I did it: Natural Earth data for the background map, geom_hexbin for the hexagons. I made one map for every month, loaded all the maps in GIMP and exported it as an animated gif.\n\nChallenge 3: polygons\n\nData: Agglomeraties 200m, Statbel\n\nTool: QGIS + Illustrator\n\nGoal: show the big city that Flanders actually is\n\nHow I did it: Very basic styling of polygon shapefiles, with some inner glow and drop shadow.\n\nChallenge 2: lines\n\nData: Air passenger transport between the main airports of Belgium and their main partner airports (Eurostat)\n\nTool: R + ggplot2\n\nGoal: see how Belgian airports are connected to foreign airports\n\nHow I did it: I used the eurostat R package to get data about the number of commercial flights between Belgian and foreign airports. The hardest part was then to geocode all the airports to their actual location. After that, I used the rnaturalearthdata package to get the baselayer data, and plotted everything on the map with ggplot (with geom_sf() for the countries, geom_segment() for the lines, and geom_point() for the airports).\n\nThese are the connections for all Belgian airports, units are total number of commercial flights between both cities, in 2018.\n\nA zoomed in version, to better see the European connections:\n\nBecause this is all in script, it is very easy to do for other countries:\n\nIf you have a request for any European country, just let me know!\n\nChallenge 1: points\n\nData: Global Power Plant Database\n\nTool: Flourish\n\nGoal: map all power plants in Europe, by source of fuel\n\nInspiration: Mapping how the United States generates its electricity by The Washington Post\n\nHow I did it: I took the data from the Global Power Plant Database and with a little R script, I filtered out the plants in European countries. I uploaded the data to the Projection map - Europe (countries) template in Flourish. Then it was just a matter of styling the map a little bit.\n\nNotice that Russia is not part of the country layer in this Flourish map template. But Iâm going to leave it at that.\n\nOne powerful thing that you can do with Flourish is creating stories: slide decks that you can use to highlight different aspects of your data. In the map template, the color legend serves as filter, so creating the following little story was quite easy:\n\nSo challenge 1: done!"
