Hunt\"\n\nSee other formats\n\nTHE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES POPULATION BY COUNTIES AND MINOR CIVIL DIVISIONS 1910,1900,1890 Digitized by the Internet Archive in 2012 with funding from LYRASIS Members and Sloan Foundation http://archive.org/details/thirteenthcensusOOhunt Thirteenth Census or the United States: 1910 BULLETIN POPULATION : UNITED STATES NUMBER OF INHABITANTS, BY COUNTIES AND MINOR CIVIL DIVISIONS Prepared under the supervision of WM. C. HUNT, Chief Statistician for Population This bulletin gives the population of states and terri- tories, by counties and minor civil divisions, as enum- erated at the Thirteenth Census, taken as of April 15, 1910, with comparative statements of population for 1900 and 1S90 where possible. In many of the states, and particularly in those of the western part of the country, there have been in the last 20 years a number of changes in the boundaries of counties as well as in the minor civil divisions which oftentimes make a comparison with the preceding census enumeration out of the question. The statistics are here given in two general tables for each state of continental United States and for the outlying territories of Alaska. Hawaii, and Porto Rico. The statistics for any given state or territory are thus brought together in one place. Table 1 shows the population of each state or terri- tory, distributed according to counties and minor civil divisions, at the last three Federal censuses, namely, those of 1910. 1900. and 1S90. The arrange- ment of counties is alphabetical and the same order is followed for primary divisions, except where they are known by numbers only, in which case the numerical order is followed. The changes in boundaries, name, or form of organization which have taken place since 1900 are indicated in the footnotes to the table. Table 2 shows for and other inc erai, . ■es of com k! into poli **■ state or territory the cities ;es alphabetically arranged 910. 1900, and 1890. al United States are, in gen- 'I divisions known as counties, but in Louisiana the equivalent subdivisions are called parishes. There are a few cities that are inde- pendent of county organizations, namely, Baltimore St. Louis, and most of the cities of Virginia. There are also a few cities that are coextensive with one or more counties, namely. San Francisco, Denver, New Orleans (coextensive with Orleans Parish), New York (coextensive with four counties), and Philadelphia. There are no counties or other civil divisions, except police precincts, in the District of Columbia, the county organization having been abolisl * in 1874 at the time IS— M— 8 U840 that the cities of Washington and Georgetown ceased to exist as separate corporations. Outside of conti- nental United .States. Hawaii has a county organization, while in Alaska judicial districts and in Porto Rico municipal districts are used as equivalents of counties. The counties in turn are generally divided into smaller political units which bear different designa- tions in different states and territories, such as town- ships, towns, election precincts, beats, magisterial districts, etc. In the states organized from the public- domain and surveyed under the national land system, what is termed the congressional township has gener- ally been taken as the basis of organization of minor civil divisions. In New England, and in a portion of the country strongly affected by New England migra- tion, the counties are generally divided into towns which often have many of the powers that in the South and in the newly settled West pertain to the county. In some states different designations are used for the civil divisions of different counties; thus some counties in Nebraska and Nevada are divided into townships., while other counties in the same states are divided into election precincts; in Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota townships, election precincts, and school districts appear as civil divisions of different counties. Some counties in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont report, in addition to towns and cities, which are the regular minor civil divisions in these states, a certain number of plantations, gores, grants, surpluses, purchases, locations, and islands; these des- ignations generally represent partly organized or un- organized territory laid off by the state authorities for different purposes. Federal reservations often occupy parts of several counties and are reported in each, note being made of the fact that the county contains only part of the reservation. Minor civil divisions which rank next to the county as geographic areas are termed primary divisions; fre- quently these primary divisions contain political units of still smaller area, such as incorporated villages or boroughs; these smaller political units are referred to as secondary divisions. -12 2—12 STATISTICS OF POPULATION. The wide variety of nomenclature which exists throughout the states is shown in the following sum- mary, which gives for oach state the name of the primary divisions of less area than the county: STATES. Alabama Election precincts. Arizona Election precincts. Arkansas Townships. California Judicial townships. Colorado Election precincts. Connecticut Towns. Delaware Representative districts. District of Columbia None. Florida Election precincts. Georgia Militia districts. Idaho Election precincts. Illinois Townships and election precincts. Indiana Townships. Iowa Townships. Kansas Townships. Kentucky Magisterial districts. Louisiana Police jury wards. Maine Towns and cities. Maryland Election districts. Massachusetts Towns and cities. Michigan Townships. Minnesota Civil townships and townships and ranges. Mississippi Beats. Missouri Townships. Montana School districts. townships, and election precincts. Nebraska Townships and election precincts. Nevada Townships and election precincts. New Hampshire Towns and cities. New Jersey Townships. New Mexico Election precincts. New York „ Towns and cities. North Carolina Townships. North Dakota Civil townships, election precincts, Bchool towiiHliips, :uid school districts. Ohio Townships. Oklahoma Townships. Oregon Election precincts. Pennsylvania Townships, cities, and boroughs. Rhode Island Towns and cities. South Carolina Townships. South Dakota Civil townships, election precincts, school townships, and school districts. Tennessee Civil districts. Texas Commissioners' precincts and justices' precincts. Utah Election precincts. Vermont Towns and cities. Virginia Magisterial districts. Washington Election precincts. West Virginia Magisterial districts. Wisconsin Towns. Wyoming Election districts and election precincts. OUTLYING TERRITORIES. Alaska Recorders' districts. Hawaii Election districts. Porto Rico Barrios. Municipalities, such as cities, towns, and villages, appear in some cases as primary divisions coordinate with townships or election precincts; in other cases as secondary divisions forming parts of a primary di- vision or sometimes coextensive with one or more of them. The usual subdivision of the municipal corpo- ration is the ward, but in a number of cities the ward division has been abandoned, and the city is subdi- vided into assembly districts ; in such cases this division has been used for the presentation of the population.
