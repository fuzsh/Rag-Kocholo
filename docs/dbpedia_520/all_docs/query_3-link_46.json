        "text": "Planning the process\n\nIn order to deliver integrated elderly care at home, the municipalities and the county councils are required to follow the requirements from the National Board of Health and Welfare. One of these requirements concerns information sharing between care providers while the other deals with cooperative care planning before discharge from hospital [34]. Therefore, when an individual is scheduled to receive care at home after hospital discharge, a care plan meeting with all parties involved is mandatory. During this meeting, the care providers and the care receiver with relatives discuss the home care process. The following care providers attend these meetings: the nurse at the hospital who initiates the meeting, personnel from home health care, the care administrator and physiotherapists from both the hospital and from primary care if needed. Home health care is represented by a district nurse or an assistant nurse.\n\nThe care interventions provided by the home help service and by home health care are different. The home health care provides care interventions defined as health care, such as binding up wounds, giving insulin, taking samples for testing, inserting pharmaceuticals into medical dispenser units and dispensing medicine and eye drops. The home help service provides care interventions defined as care along with social care such as help with food, getting dressed, cleaning, care assistance, practical services and they also respond to alarms. Furthermore, some care interventions are defined by home health care as ‘self-treatment’ and are, therefore, not provided by the home health care personnel. However, the home help service sometimes has a different view of what ‘self treatment’ is.\n\nAn elderly patient at the hospital is about to be discharged and is in need of home care. The hospital nurse has, therefore, called for a care plan meeting. Five persons attend this meeting; the patient himself, a relative, the hospital nurse, the district nurse and the care administrator. The nurse describes the patient’s visit to the hospital and what care interventions are needed when the patient returns to his home. The patient needs help with treating a wound with a cream twice a day, a procedure that takes some time. The district nurse responds that this kind of care intervention is classified as ‘self-treatment’ and should not be conducted by the home health care workers. The hospital nurse informs the home care workers that the patient cannot perform the treatment himself due to his injuries. The care administrator responds that this kind of task is something that certainly should be done by the home health care workers since this task is not something a care receiver could apply for help for and thus cannot be classified as part of the home help service, “….besides the home help service unit has no resources for these kinds of care interventions that take so much time….” The meeting ends without a final decision about who should take care of the wound.\n\nDuring the group discussion, the home health care workers argued that “if the patient is not mentally capable, even simple treatments may be considered as health care interventions”. However, some patients are physically incapable to conduct the self-treatment themselves, as in the above observation, and the question then is which organisation is responsible for this person. To determine responsibility in these cases, the question is often asked if the person’s health will deteriorate until a health care intervention is needed unless given the treatment in question. Another way of determining responsibility is to decide which organisation would have had responsibility for the patient if he or she had not applied for home help service. In addition to this, it is important to note that for the care receiver, home help service may be more costly than home health care.\n\nDuring the group discussions, the care workers argued for clearer rules or agreements about what organisation should be responsible for which care intervention. The care workers also stated that resources are wasted when both the home help service and home health care are at the care receiver’s home at the same time: “When one person is making a sandwich while another person gives insulin at the same time, this does not feel as an efficient way to conduct a home visit”. However, the care workers also stated that sometimes the unit chiefs or care administrators bend the rules in the best interest of the care receiver and sometimes both the home help service and home health care workers actually conduct care interventions beyond those agreed upon during the care plan meeting.\n\nCoordination during home care\n\nThe home help service groups from all shifts store information about the care receiver and the approved care interventions separately in non-digital form. The home health care personnel use a computerised patient record system, which is used within all primary care. However, while working in the patients’ homes, it is impossible to access this patient record system.\n\nTo manage cooperation and coordination between the organisations, an information and communication tool was constructed, called the SVOP binder. SVOP is an acronym for ‘coordinated health care and care planning’ (in Swedish: Samordnad Vård- och Omsorgs Planering). The binder is placed in the care receiver’s home and consists of several documents and material which provide the care workers with information for administering home care interventions, for supporting involved individuals in daily work situations and for facilitating communication between the care workers involved. The binder and its use has been described and analysed in more detail in [32]. Particularly important for the present study is the fact that although the current events document facilitates communication, it was rarely used since it was available only in the care receiver’s home. This is unfortunate, since some of the information is needed for coordination purposes and important information may be received late, which in turn may affect the care receiver’s health condition. To circumvent this problem, workers who add information to the current events document also try to reach the day-shift personnel who need the information by phone. This is further complicated by the fact that the home help service workers during dayshifts (10 persons) share only two mobile phones, making it difficult for district nurses to quickly contact a specific home help service worker. For the night-shift personnel, the notes in the SVOP binder are the only way to stay informed.\n\nTo continue, care receivers in need of multiple care interventions can trigger alarms if the need arises. The home help service responds to these alarms and is, therefore, equipped with keys. Not having these keys, the home health care personnel must coordinate their visits according to the home help service’s schedule. However, information about the scheduled home help service visits is placed in the SVOP binder, accessible only during home visits. The following observation shows one consequence of this situation:\n\nA district nurse is about to make a home visit. She knows that the home help service usually makes its home visit at a certain time and she, therefore, plans the home visit according to this. When she arrives to the patient, the door is locked and she realises that the home help service worker has not arrived yet. She makes another home visit and attempts to visit the patient later when the home help service has arrived.\n\nIn addition to this, the information in the SVOP binder is not always up-to-date for several reasons. In particular, pharmaceutical information, updated by external primary care workers and taken from the patient’s medical record, tends to be inaccurate. The following observed situation illustrates an actual consequence of this problem:\n\nA district nurse is conducting a home visit in order to insert pharmaceuticals into medical dispenser units. She takes the pharmaceuticals from the packages and in order to insert the right dosage she looks at the prescribed pharmaceuticals document in the SVOP binder. During this home visit, the care receiver shows a new package with pharmaceuticals. The district nurse consults the prescribed pharmaceuticals document and notices that the dosage of the new pharmaceutical is inconsistent with the prescribed pharmaceuticals document. The district nurse suspects that the document has been updated without her knowledge. She, therefore, drives back to the reception to search for the new document.\n\nTo summarise, the empirical findings clearly show that the tools used for information and communication do not fully support coordination during the home care process, thus forcing care workers to make additional coordination efforts.\n\nOrganisational boundaries\n\nCoordinating home care interventions where home care is divided between two organisations is not a straightforward process. The present study has identified the planning activity, specifically during the care plan meeting, as a particularly problematic subject. The most crucial issue here is, who should assume responsibility for care interventions defined as ‘self-treatment’ by home health care. This shows that it is difficult to demarcate between treatments considered as health care interventions and treatments that are considered as possible for the patient himself/herself to conduct. There is no established definition of self-treatment and, consequently, each case is judged separately. It is quite clear that this is primarily a policy issue that needs to be resoled at an organisational level. In 2006, The National Board of Health and Welfare initiated an investigation on how to define ‘self-treatment’ in relation to health care and during 2008/2009 directions will be issued on how to handle this issue [35]. Another possible solution for improving the quality of home care that has been discussed is the merger of the home help service and home health care into one organisation.\n\nIn 2004, The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs investigated “how medical and social care including rehabilitation and aids for disabled should be organised to ensure integrated care and service for the elderly” [36, p. 14]. This investigation resulted in a government bill to the Swedish Parliament [37]. The main argument of this bill was that the responsibility for the home help service and home health care should be provided by the municipalities, which would entail a merger of the home help service and home health care. The bill also stated that advanced home health care should remain the responsibility of the county council. Furthermore, it is possible that other services appear that also need to cooperate and coordinate with a merged home help service/home health care team. For example, the county council has recently introduced a trial service called ‘the mobile doctor’ consisting of a physician from primary care who makes home visits during daytime. Thus, even if the home help service and home health care would merge, there will still be different care providers visiting elderly in their homes. This means that there always will be a need for inter-organisational cooperation and coordination. Furthermore, integrating care by merely merging home health care and the home help service may not be the ultimate solution, as discussed below.\n\nCoordination and cooperative work\n\nThe ethnographic workplace study was conducted in order to understand how coordination is carried out in the daily work, to identify coordination issues in situ and possible actions that may be taken to improve coordination in the studied setting. A problem with this kind of methodology is that data collection is quite extensive. Therefore, the analysis of the common themes, activities and issues is an important activity during the research process. As in all qualitative research, the data may be influenced by the researcher’s point of view—a problematic issue that needs to be considered during the research process. This is even more the case when conducting ethnographic studies, since one of the objectives is to capture the ‘Members’ Point of View’ [33]. To evaluate the researcher’s interpretation of the empirical findings, common themes, activities and issues have been discussed with the care workers and managers throughout the project, thus confirming the reliability of the data.\n\nIn CSCW, some criticism has been presented in regard to workplace studies intended to inform systems design [38, 39]. It has been argued that the understanding of a particular workplace is a valuable contribution in its own right. It is believed that such an understanding can inform CSCW design “through raising awareness of important conceptual issues and questioning taken-for-granted assumptions about work activities and how they should be supported” [38, p. 321]. The assumption in this paper is that this kind of understanding is equally important in the research area of integrated care.\n\nThe need for coordination in this particular case shows that formal organisational boundaries do not describe the actual behavioural patterns and division of daily work among health care providers. The core aim in the studied setting is to provide the care receiver with good-quality care, and the actors must coordinate their efforts regardless of their organisational belonging to achieve this aim. This became evident during group discussions where the care workers argued that one must ‘bend the boundaries’ regarding the issue of ‘self-treatment’ in the best interest of the care receiver. With this in mind, care workers have invented additional tools and routines to support cooperation and coordination in the workplace. Integrated care is clearly much more than organisational boundaries, policies, strategies, structures and processes. In their daily work, people cooperate and coordinate their activities to get the work done, regardless of their organisational belonging.\n\nAgain, IT tools may help to resolve some of the organizational problems faced by home care providers. In care settings, efforts have been made to develop electronic patient records, medical records and health records. These technologies were developed for a particular process or organization, and take the boundaries and structures of this process or organization into consideration. However, as shown in the present study, home care coordination often needs to transcend organizational boundaries. This further emphasises the findings of [32], which show that the context of elderly care at home involves coordination also with other care providers as well as the inclusion of the care receiver himself/herself and relatives. Furthermore, the present study also stresses the fact that new care providers might visit the care receiver at home in the future. After all, cooperative work relations emerge in response to changing requirements and resources [40]."
