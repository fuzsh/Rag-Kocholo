as well.\n\nReview: Kunjaliyan has no substance\n\nDirected by Saji and Surendran with Jayasurya in the lead, Kunjaliyan is supposed to be a comedy but it disappoints.\n\nReview: Manushya Mrugam is juvenile\n\nManushya Mrugam, is dominated by Babu Raj but is an average film with plenty of lecherous characters.\n\nReview: Key is certainly different\n\nJagapathi Babu plays an impactful cameo in

However, this much touted and publicised film of his doesn't live up to the hype.\n\nReview: Veera Bahu disappoints\n\nVeera Bahu could have been an out of the box flick given the coming together of powerhouses like Mahender and Vijay. Sadly, though it disappoints.\n\nReview: Kote is full of action\n\nTough cops and their fight against social evils has been dealt before but the film is definitely a better outcome than Nannavanu.\n\nReview: Nagarjuna's Payanam works!\n\nPayanam does have minor problems in pacing, but the drama carries you through, right to a nail-biting finish. A must-watch.\n\nReview: Gaganam is a must-watch\n\nDon't miss this edge-of-the-seat thriller about a plane hijacking.\n\nReview: Makeup Man is passable\n\nDon't expect too much from this Malayalam film and you might just enjoy it.\n\nKhadama review: As real as it gets\n\nKhadama realistically shows the sufferings of lower class labourers in the Gulf.\n\nReview: Yuddham Sei is gripping\n\nYuddham Sei may have its flaws, but Mysskin's neat touches of situational humour, clever twists in the first half and convincing characters make this a neat film, if not a classic.\n\nReview: Kalgejje could have been better\n\nReview : Kal Manja is a laugh riot\n\nFor two and a half hours of pure comedy, watch Kal Manja.\n\nJai Bolo Telangana is uni-dimensional\n\nJai Bolo Telangana may attract only the supporters of the cause to the theatres.\n\nEasan is worth a watch but...\n\nIf the director had shored up the second half just as much he's worked on the first, Eesan would have been a brilliant effort all over.\n\nNayaka : Not good enough\n\nNayaka would have been a good effort if supported by a strong script and characters.\n\nHuli is all action and dialogues\n\nHuli is an average mass movie with messages that we have heard time and again.\n\nBig B, Mohanlal shine in Kandahar\n\nA better script would have perhaps made the reutrn of Major Mahadevan more appealing.\n\nKanimozhi doesn't make sense\n\nThis Tamil movie starring Jai and Shahzahn Padamsee could have been good, if it actually had a story.\n\nKarma is for a niche audience\n\nKarma has a new theme and concept as far as Telugu cinema is concerned but doen't offer much entertainment. What it does offer is a slice of Hindu mythology.\n\nSwantham Bharya Zindabad is insipid\n\nLines get crossed in this Malayalam movie.\n\nOru Small Family has no impact\n\nThe Malayalam movie takes on the scourge of alcoholism but fails to make any impact.\n\nNandhalala is brilliant\n\nIt takes a great deal of gumption to avoid commercial overtones, inject the right dose of humour, angst and poignancy, enough to draw you right into the film, but Nandhalala definitely accomplishes that.\n\nBisile disappoints\n\nScript lets the movie down.\n\nOrange : An overdose of love\n\nBhaskar's latest Telugu offering is disappointing and confusing.\n\nManmadhan Ambu hits all the right notes\n\nDevi Sri Prasad has a reputation for sticking with his regulation format of tunes and here too, you can see it pop up at certain places but there's also a departure from the usual, mostly an influence of Kamal Haasan in both lyrics and music.\n\nNothing original about Karyasthan\n\nDileep's hundredth appearance as an actor on the big screen directed by newcomer Thomson and scripted by his trusted team of UdayKrishna and Sibi K Thomas fails to entice the viewer and leaves a feeling that he deserved better.\n\nVa Quarter Cutting could have been funnier\n\nVa Quarter Cutting is brilliant in parts\n\nUthamaputhiran is illogical\n\nUthamaputhiran is fluffy, frothy, impossibly light and has no business with logic or reason.\n\nCollector Gaari Bhaarya - old wine in old bottle\n\nCollector Gaari Bhaarya has a good theme but loses out on account of typical treatment.\n\nNothing new about Kiccha Huccha\n\nWatch this one if you must for the lead pair and only if you haven't seen the original Chithiram Pesudadi.\n\nJackie is an out and out Puneet film\n\nJackie caters both to the class and the mass. It has a fair share of both sentiments and action and even comes with a message on human trafficking.\n\nPranchiyettan and the Saint is impressive\n\nDirector Ranjith gives his best in Pranchiyettan and the Saint.\n\nShikkar : Not exactly a mass-entertainer\n\nmake Shikkar is a mass-entertainer plus an artistic merit film, but fails to impress.\n\nDrohi : Stuck in the shadow of Mani Ratnam\n\nDrohi inspired by Mani Ratnam's films\n\nBoss (A) Baskaran is high on comedy\n\nJotegaara is a predictable love story\n\nJotegaara fails to impress.\n\nKomaram Puri is high on style, low on content\n\nKomaram Puli is stylish, technically sound but has a run-of-the-mill story.\n\nAnandhapurathu Veedu does not scare\n\nThe film is perfect for children with its mild twists, simple CGI (that looks straight out of a serial) and feel-good ending.\n\nOru Naal Varum lacks magic\n\nOru Naal Varum may be a well intended social satire but it ends up as a conundrum.\n\nNallavan has nothing new to offer\n\nThere was much riding for Jayasurya on Nallavan. But except for the different getups, it does not have anything new to offer.\n\nKaadhalagi starts well, ends disastrously\n\nThe Tamil film flounders into nothing despite a decent start, because of a poor script and faltering performances.\n\nKatrathu Kalavu is worth a watch\n\nThe story of this Tamil flick isn't new, but is told in a refreshing fashion with a cast that sets out to have fun and gives you a good ride in the process.\n\nAvoid Nannavanu\n\nThe Kannada film fails to recreate the magic of some of the recent rebirth-oriented scripts like Magadheera.\n\nKola Kolaya Mundhirika will have you in spilts\n\nThe Tamil film with Crazy Mohan's dialogues, is a blast.\n\nStay away from Magane En Marumagane\n\nThis Tamil film starring Vivek is an endless tearjerker.\n\nNooru Janmaku is dull\n\nThe Kannada film starring Santosh and Aindrita, is a love story set in the backdrop of recession. Watch it only for the cinematography.\n\nSome originality would have helped Kanagavel Kakka\n\nThe Tamil movie starring Karan, is a reasonably-paced drama, but predictable.\n\nMummy & Me is loud\n\nJeethu Joseph's Mummy & Me, starring Urvasi, Archana, Mukesh and Kunchako Boban, works in parts; it is too loud the rest of the time.\n\nAlexander The Great is a bad copy of Rain Man\n\nThe Malayalam movie would have been good if not great had it stuck to the relationship between the siblings. Instead the filmmaker has made a typical masala movie.\n\nSatyan Anthikad scores again!\n\nThe Malayalam film, Kadha Thudarunnu, is refreshing.\n\nPokkiriraja disappoints\n\nWatch this Malayalam flick only if you're a fan of Mammootty and Prithviraj.\n\nStay away from Guru Sishyan\n\nThis Tamil movie is a tedious exercise in vulgarity.\n\nKutty Pisasu is strictly for kids\n\nGo for this Tamil movie only if you have the mental capacities of a six-year-old.\n\nGulumal is a bad copy of Bluffmaster\n\nThis comic caper would have been an ideal escape as mentioned in the tagline of title but the lazy approach by the makers makes it fall short of expectations.\n\nPaleri Manikyam is near perfect\n\nDirector Ranjith's take on the first recorded case of sexual harassment in the state is rich visually as well as in content.\n\nMy Big Father does not work\n\nRecent successes has made Jayaram push his luck by recklessly selecting projects that do not work.\n\nPravarakhyudu is a mature love story\n\nThe film is a decent entertainer with a message for the youth.\n\nNaan Avan Illai is fun\n\nJhabak's Tamil flick starring Jeevan is a rollicking ride.\n\nArya 2 is disappointing\n\nThe Telugu flick is rather disappointing as a sequel to Arya. With a confused plot and a psychotic character, the film is rather tedious to watch particularly the second half. The plus points are Allu Arjun and Kajal Aggarwal.\n\nGokula is a treat to watch\n\nWhether it is the story, performances, music or technical support, this Kannada flick has everything going for it.\n\nJeeva is tedious\n\nSave for Prajwal's neat performance and Guru Kiran's music, this Kannada flick has nothing going for it.\n\nPazhassi Raja is brilliant\n\nThe reunion of the team who gave us the classic Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha has a winner on its hands, if not a classic of the same proportion.\n\nPeraanmai is inadvertently hilarious\n\nThe Tamil thriller suffers from poor script and bad dialogues.\n\nGilli is good in parts\n\nGururaj Jaggesh makes a good debut in the Kannada remake of the Tamil film Raghava Loki.\n\nNinagaagi Kaadiruve is an amateurish attempt\n\nWatch this Kannada film only if you do not have any other alternative.\n\nHuchchi is a badly made film\n\nThis Kannada movie is neither a psychological thriller nor an entertaining yarn. Pooja Gandhi has not been able to deliver a good performance because of sketchy characterization and poor script. Anant Nag shines in this otherwise unforgettable film.\n\nMahatma is verbose and preachy\n\nThe 100th Telugu film of Srikanth directed by Krishnavamsi, is made in mainstream format and therefore long, tedious and rather limiting. Srikanth has given a good performance -- perhaps the best in his career.\n\nThiru Thiru Thuru Thuru provides insane laughter\n\nT4 has a load of mush, fluff and frothiness but that's pretty much it.\n\nRecchipo is a wasteful effort\n\nThis Telugu flick has a run-of-the-mill storyline which makes for a tedious watch. Nitin and Ileana can't really do much to salvage the film which can be easily given a miss.\n\nYogaraj Bhat strikes again with Manasaare\n\nSuperb visuals, melodious music and Yogaraj Bhat's dialogues are the high points of the Kannada movie which has a superb first half.\n\nRobinhood is for Prithviraj's fans\n\nPrithviraj's new Malayalam film directed by veteran Joshiy had promised an interesting premise but falls short of expectations.\n\nWatch Eenadu for what it is\n\nThe Telugu remake of A Wednesday sees the coming together of two superstars -- Kamal Haasan and Venkatesh. Shruti Haasan's background score and a different story line rocks.\n\nUnnai Pol Oruvan is a must-watch\n\nKamal Haasan and UTV Motion Pictures' Tamil remake of A Wednesday directed by Ckari Toleti addresses serious issues with a swift-paced screenplay and brilliant performances.\n\nRajani is a good entertainer\n\nUpendra's Kannada film directed by Thriller Manju keeps you in splits because of splendid performances by Rangayana Raghu, Sadhu Kokila, Bullet Prakash and Doddanna.\n\nA decent effort\n\nThis Malayalam movie starring Jagadeesh and Meera Vasudev is a decent effort but not involving enough.\n\nHushaar could be been thrilling\n\nThis Kannada could have been a great thriller if not for badly written comedy sequences.\n\nKaana Kanmani is not up to the mark\n\nThe Malayalam film may have been made with noblest of intentions but the method of conveying the message somehow is lost in a ghostly conundrum.\n\nJosh doesn't rock\n\nThe only thing to look forward to in this rather preachy Telugu movie is the lead pair of newcomers, Naga Chaitanya and Karthika.\n\nShudharil Shudhan surprises\n\nThe Malayalam movie directed by debutant Jayaaraj Vijay is a rare socially responsible effort in these dark ages.\n\nMussanjeya Gelathi : Bold subject, weak execution\n\nThe cast and slow pace of this Kannada is its biggest drawbacks.\n\nNinaithale Inikkum is worth a watch\n\nThis Tamil movie starring Prithviraj, is a nostalgic walk through college years, shot with a dose of suspense.\n\nVaayuputhra could have been better\n\nThe Kannada remake of the Tamil movie, Sandai Kozhi lacks spice.\n\nOru Black and White Kudumbam loses the plot\n\nOru Black and White Kudumbam directed by Shaiju Anthikad starring Kalabhavan Mani, Jayasurya and Bhama is a family film that begins promisingly enough but ends up being an underachiever.\n\nMagadheera is technically brilliant\n\nRajamouli has effectively directed this Telugu reincarnation story starring Chiranjeevi's son Ram Charan Teja.\n\nWatch Anthony Yaar? at your own peril\n\nThis Tamil flick has a robotic cast and a screenplay that's filled with loopholes the size of a crater.\n\nMale Barali Manju Irali is a must watch\n\nGood performances from Parvathy, Sreenagara Kitty and Jai Jagadish, a tight screenplay and great visuals make this Kannada movie a must watch.\n\nAru Maname is sleep inducing\n\nThis Tamil movie is a mish-mash of several sentimental yesteryear films, with very little comic relief.\n\nPuthiya Mukham : Violence doesn't work\n\nThe Malayalam movie directed by Diphan lacks substance.\n\nRahasya Police is amateurish\n\nThe Malayalam movie featuring Jayaram in a double role is disappointing.\n\nUnimpressive Modhi Vilaiyadu\n\nMediaOne and Global Infotainment's Tamil movie directed by Saran, is an unsatisfying cocktail of mixed storylines.\n\nBharya Onnu Makkal Moonuu is a family drama\n\nDirector Rajasenan scores yet again with his latest Malayalam family drama.\n\nAindham Padai is below average\n\nAvni Cinemax's Tamil movie is a masala mixture which requires you to leaves your brains behind -- but Simran turns up with a great performance.\n\nMalayan is tedious\n\nThree Sum Movie's Tamil movie starring Karan, is a movie entirely made for the benefit of Karan.\n\nMuniya , one more underworld film\n\nDirector Nagachandra messes up his first half of this Kannada film.\n\nDon't miss Love Guru\n\nEven if you find the climax offbeat, you will enjoy the film. Love Guru is certainly a different kind of film, worth watching.\n\nEddelu Manjunatha is a laugh riot\n\nGuru Prasad hits bull's eye once again with a perfect film in Eddelu Manjunatha.\n\nKalavaramaye Madilo is appealing\n\nThis heroine-centric film is appealing and makes for a worthwhile watch. Just go and enjoy it and let the cascade of emotions engulf you.\n\nAchamundu is a must-watch\n\nFor the guts in coming up with a unique, important theme that needs to be addressed sensitively, this movie works. A must-watch.\n\nPreethse Preethse is very ordinary\n\nYogish has a different role in the Kannada flick, but he's too young to take up a role knitted with a lot of sensibilities. Pragna is glamorous and excels in her skin show. Udaya Tara is okay while the comedy track is too silly. Anoop Sileen's song compositions are good.\n\nEvaraina Epudaina is average\n\nVarun Sandesh's lively performance apart, it is the captivating beauty of Vimala Raman that makes this Telugu film worth watching.\n\nNadodigal is realistic\n\nGlobal Infotainment's Tamil movie directed by Samudhrakkani and starring Sasikumar, is a realistic movie that's worth a watch.\n\nBandhe Barthaale is boring\n\nThe dull Kannada film is marked by listless narration and uninspiring performances.\n\nWatch Bhramaram for Mohanlal\n\nBhramaram, Blessy's latest Malayalam venture starring Mohanlal, Suresh Menon and VG Muralikrishnan is a thriller worth your time and money.\n\nThis Current isn't very strong\n\nCurrent is an urban love story starring Sushant and Sneha Ullal. Directed by debutant Surya Pratap, this Telugu love story has a bit of freshness about it though it's a little slow and boring in between.\n\nYodha is enjoyable\n\nDarshan's fights and dialogues, Nikitha's glamour quotient and racy first half makes this Kannada movie a treat to watch.\n\nNothing new in Raju Maharaju\n\nRaju Maharaju follows the usual path of storytelling. This Telugu family entertainer starring Mohan Babu, Sharwanand, Ramyakrishna and Survin Chawla has nothing new to offer.\n\nMuthirai : Wasted potential\n\nASA Productions' and Vision Jeeva Studio's Tamil movie Muthirai fails to capitalise on its potential.\n\nPrayanam : Sweet journey of love\n\nChandrasekhar Yeleti's Telugu film is a sweet story about a boy falling in love with a girl and wooing her at an airport.\n\nThoranai : Not good, but not bad either\n\nGK Film Corporation's Tamil movie starring Vishal an Shriya is a mind-numbing cocktail of fights, songs and 60s cheesy dialogues.\n\nKalaakar is a neat movie\n\nActor Harish Raj proves his mettle as a director in his debut Kannada film. He also shines as an actor. Other plusses include Suman's performance, music and camerawork.\n\nAbhimani is average\n\nDirector Praveen Engineer's weak handling of the subject and ordinary performances makes this Kannada film an average fare. Music is good, though.\n\nZarina Wahab cannot lift Calendar\n\nCalendar -- made by a first time director, with the backing of an experienced scriptwriter Babu Janardhanan and an exceptional cast -- is an average film.\n\nMuthirai 's music is good in parts\n\nIt looks like Yuvan needs to find his moorings back again. He probably needs it after a spate of releases one after the other. Still, there are a couple of good numbers that make this album worthwhile.\n\nNothing special about Taakat\n\nTaakat ends up as a weak film with a predictable story line and narration. Vijay is good in the action sequences while Shubha Poonja has nothing much to offer. Avinash scores in his role. Music by Guru Kiran is ordinary.\n\nDubai Babu is entertaining\n\nUpendra dominates Dubai Babu with his mesmerising dialogue delivery and competent performance. Fast paced narration backed by good editing work and technical values also helps to make the film watchable.\n\nThis is no fake Currency\n\nDirector Swathi Bhaskar's first directorial venture Currency starring Jayasurya and Mukesh shows is not bad.\n\nBhagavan is tardy\n\nBhagavan, the first Malayalam film directed by Prasanth Mambully starring Mohanlal inspired by 26/11 has nothing to offer except the record breaking time it took to shoot it.\n\nBrammadeva can be avoided\n\nRoyal Pentagon's Tamil movie is a suspense thriller which is let down by Dr Raam's acting, the music and the climax.\n\nRajadhi Raja is crude\n\nCinema Paradise's Tamil movie directed by Shakthi Chidambaram is a lust-filled wannabee action thriller aimed solely at the front-benchers.\n\nModhi Vilaiyadu is worth a listen\n\nThe music of Colonial Cousins shorn of the excellent orchestration and keyboard arrangements may not be scintillating, but the special effects take your focus away from the purely musical aspect and provide you with a good show. Worth a listen.\n\nHatrick Hodi Maga is bad\n\nHatrick Hodi Maga may rank as one of the worst gangster films of Shivaraj Kumar and its director PN.Sathya. A weak plot, inept narration and a horrible comedy subplot will get on your nerves. Shivaraj Kumar is ordinary and the film's heroine Nicolette Bird is wasted. Jessie Gift has delivered weak music for the film.\n\nStay away from Seena\n\nSeena in one more addition to the badly made gangster films in Kannada. Lover boy turns a ruthless killer in the film. Except for photography and a couple of songs, nothing will appeal to you in this slow paced film.\n\nAvoid this Black Dahlia\n\nBlack Dahlia, directed by Babu Raj is a replica of Chintamani Kolacase. The Malayalam film is nothing but a showcase for Babu Raj's wife Vani Vishvanath.\n\nModhi Vilaiyadu is worth a listen\n\nThe music of Colonial Cousins shorn of the excellent orchestration and keyboard arrangements may not be scintillating, but the special effects take your focus away from the purely musical aspect and provide you with a good show. Worth a listen.\n\nHatrick Hodi Maga is bad\n\nHatrick Hodi Maga may rank as one of the worst gangster films of Shivaraj Kumar and its director PN.Sathya. A weak plot, inept narration and a horrible comedy subplot will get on your nerves. Shivaraj Kumar is ordinary and the film's heroine Nicolette Bird is wasted. Jessie Gift has delivered weak music for the film.\n\nStay away from Seena\n\nSeena in one more addition to the badly made gangster films in Kannada. Lover boy turns a ruthless killer in the film. Except for photography and a couple of songs, nothing will appeal to you in this slow paced film.\n\nAvoid this Black Dahlia\n\nBlack Dahlia, directed by Babu Raj is a replica of Chintamani Kolacase. The Malayalam film is nothing but a showcase for Babu Raj's wife Vani Vishvanath.\n\nKannada actress Shruti to wed again\n\nShruthi has admitted that she will be wed Chandrachud, a former journalist-turned-film director.\n\nKick is light-hearted\n\nDirector Surendar Reddy starts off Telugu film Kick with a lot of fun but somehow, fails to maintain the tempo. Therefore it does not sustain the same interest level throughout.\n\nPassenger is worth a watch\n\nThose who think the future of Malayalam films is bleak, watch Malayalam film Passenger starring Dileep, Sreenivasan and Mamta Mohandas. The film gives you hope that there are new filmmakers, who want to try something out of the ordinary.\n\nMeipporul is worth a watch\n\nDespite its rather stilted performance, Meipporul is refreshing for its Hollywood-style take on things. Worth a watch.\n\nPasanga is delightful\n\nCompany Productions' Pasanga, directed by Pandiraj, is a delightfully feel-good movie with excellent performances. A must-watch.\n\nMitrudu has nothing much to offer\n\nMahadev's in his debut film Mitrudu tries to combine the element of astrology with marriage. The film has the usual elements of a Telugu film. Mahadev gives Balakrishna a slight character makeover but one wonders whether it will work.\n\nNewtonin Moonram Vidhi is a masala thriller\n\nForget logic at home and you may just enjoy this Tamil potboiler starring Rajeev Krishna and Shayali Bhagath.\n\nAnother Friday, another remake!\n\nMinchu is the remake of Tamil Hit film Thimiru. Director Vishal Raj has not tried to spoil almost everything that made the original film a hit. Sidhdhanth is miscast. Redeeming feature is Aa Dinagalu Archana's performance.\n\nAdinetha offers nothing new\n\nAdinetha is a film in sync with the current political scenario. It's a tad preachy, lengthy and utopian to watch. Jagapathi Babu carries the film on his shoulders.\n\nKunguma Poovum Konjum Puravum falls short\n\nCapital Film Works' Kunguma Poovum Konjum Puravum, directed by Rajamohan is an honest effort -- but falls short of expectations.\n\nChellidharoo Sampigeyaa is a neat entertainer\n\nChellidharoo Sampigeyaa, the remake of the Telugu film Chandamama, by director S Narayan is worth a watch for the performances, top class music, superb dialogues and great cinematography.\n\nSathyan Anthikad scores again\n\nBhagyadevatha, the latest social drama from Sathyan Anthikkad stable starring Jayaram and Kaniha, has an often-told story whose execution is superb.\n\nThoranai music is for Vishal fans\n\nFans of Mani Sharma and Vishal are likely to be entertained. Oherwise, there's nothing much here for the discerning music-lover.\n\nGuru En Aalu is no Yes Boss\n\nKRG Movies International's Guru En Aalu, directed by Selva and starring Madhavan has none of the flavour of the original Yes Boss .\n\nJaaji Mallige is a good remake\n\nJaaji Mallige may please everyone -- those who have watched the original, and those who haven't.\n\nAyan is a must-watch\n\nDirected by cinematographer-turned-director K V Anand -- who gave the differently styled Kana Kandein -- Ayan is not just a masala film but a fairly logical one too.\n\nGauththam is enjoyable\n\nPrem Kumar enacts well in an emotional role in Gauththam, a remake of the Tamil film Aahaa. Fine performances by veteran artists and good music by Guru Kiran are the appealing points of the film. A good family entertainer despite a rather lengthy second half.\n\nEnjoy 2 Harihar Nagar !\n\n2 Harihar Nagar, Lal's first venture as an independent writer-director starring Mukesh, Siddique, Jagadeesh and Asokan takes us back to the good old days of mimicry films.\n\nMusic review: Pasanga is no Subramaniapuram\n\nYou can see the effort put into making Pasanga a unique album and though it does try to scale heights in terms of musical excellence, another Subramaniapuram it certainly isn't.\n\nRaaj Kumaari has no soul\n\nRaaj Kumari is the remake of Tamil film Ananda Poongaatre. Despite the presence of Ravichandran in a few sequences of the film, Raaj Kumari fails to engage the audience because of inept handling. Balaji puts in efforts to give his best, but he is handicapped by an ordinary script. Nikitha sizzles in a song sequence.\n\nYaavarum Nalam : A must-watch!\n\nBig Pictures' Yaavarum Nalam, starring R Madhavan is a heart-thudding spook-special and whodunit rolled into one. A must-watch.\n\nA tortuous Thee\n\nWatch Sun Pictures' Thee, starring Sundar C, only if you want to do serious damage to your brain.\n\nNam Yejamaanaru is a real treat\n\nNam Yejamaanaru is a real treat for the film fans looking for some different type of films. Navya Nair stands out with a top class performance. Vishnuvardhan once again comes out with a decent emotional performance. Nagabharana delivers a film with a new rare theme. Hamsalekha is striking with his background score.\n\nDrona is pedestrian\n\nThis Telugu flick has nothing much to offer except for Nitin's fights and dances and Priya Mani skin show. It's a veritable hotchpotch.\n\nEe Sambhaashane is very ordinary\n\nEe Sambhashane has a predictable story with a monotonous narration. The first half is boring and climax is confusing. Hari Priya looks good and is certainly a star. Manohar's music and Chandru's camera work are top class. But Rajashekhar has done a haphazard job as a director.\n\nA good show\n\nCosmos Entertainment's Laadam, directed by Prabu Solomon is a gangster-movie with a racy screenplay and a good set of thrills. Go for it.\n\nSarvam is appealing\n\nIt looks like Yuvan Shankar Raja, after a couple of not-so-memorable efforts, is on his way to finding his groove again. Sarvam manages to snag your attention, in a good way.\n\nVenkata In Sankata : Worth a watch\n\nRamesh has already directed two comedies earlier but he can proudly say that Venkata In Sankata is his best comedy yet. What makes the film enjoyable is its great packaging and excellent performances from veteran actors artists and newcomers.\n\n13Byil...Yaavarum Nalam is enticing\n\nThe music of Madhavan's latest Tamil movie, 13B yil ...Yaavarum Nalam, is tuned by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy with lyrics by the queen of song-writing Thamarai. Worth a listen.\n\nPerfect cocktail\n\nSMS has all the makings of a runaway hit with its cocktail of humour, love and the eternal man-woman conflict. But if you're a champion of women's rights, this one's not for you.\n\nA good effort\n\nSatyameva Jayate is similar to Khakee in most parts with some modifications to suit the times. Dr Rajasekhar, Sayaji Shinde and Milind Soman perform well in this Telugu film.\n\nNandhalala is pleasing to the ears\n\nTaken collectively, there's a gentle sorrow that mingles with unbridled happiness that runs through all the songs in this Tamil album, and even if it isn't exactly a scintillating medley of music, it's still a fairly pleasing collection.\n\nJolly Days is just like Happy Days\n\nJolly Days is the remake of Telugu Hit Happy Days by Shekhar Khammula. Director M.D.Sreedhar has remained faithful to the original. Micky J Meyer's song compositions and performances of new artists like Niranan, Keerthi, Aishwarya Nag, Sree Raghav are top class. Go for it.\n\nAvoid Love in Singapore\n\nLove in Singapore, the latest Malayalam film by director duo Rafi-Mecartin starring Mammootty is yet another effort by the actor to be humorous. But, the implausibility of the plot and the lacklustre execution reduces him to a clown.\n\nEnnai Theriyuma falls flat\n\nSri Lakshmi Prasanna Pictures' Ennai Theriyuma?, starring Manoj Kumar, Sneha Ullal and Riya Sen, is a hotchpotch of several mystery thrillers but falls flat.\n\nNothing new in Nanda\n\nNanda is a listless action film written and directed by Anantha Raju. Shivaraj Kumar's fights are good, but Kaadal Sandhya has been wasted. Raju has failed to use the Veteran talented artists. Manohar has scored just average compositions. A Weak plot that can appeal only to action lovers.\n\nMakante Achan disappoints\n\nMakante Achan directed V M Vinu has the distinction of bringing together the father son duo of Sreenivasan and Vineeth Sreenivasan for the first time on the big screen. Other than that there is very little to cheer about in this Malayalam film.\n\nAyan is worth a listen\n\nThis latest effort from Harris Jeyaraj barring one or two numbers, doesn't seem to sustain itself after the first few lines but perhaps, with repeated listening, its appeal might increase.\n\nCircus is a good thriller\n\nGanesh gives his best performance in Dayal's well scripted Kannada film Circus, which is one of the best thrillers to hit the screens recently. Archana Gupta looks good on screen, but fails in her acting abilities. Good camera work by Shekhar Chandru, but Emil's music is inconsistent.\n\nFitting Master sermonises\n\nFitting Master is a film filled with more sadness than humour wherein producer-director E V V Satyanarayana sends a message that one should love their parents. His son Naresh's acting is convincing.\n\nMaska is a let down\n\nMaska is rehashed fare whose high points are Ram's performance and the songs. Quite a downer from producer M S Raju and director B Gopal.\n\nPadikkathavan is a commercial cocktail\n\nSun Picture's Padikkathavan, starring Dhanush and directed by Suraaj, is a commercial cocktail of a little bit of everything, minus the logic.\n\nGamyam in Tamil\n\nRaj TV's Kadhalna Summa Illa, the remake of Telugu's hit Gamyam, is a nice blend of feel-good moments, humour and pathos.\n\nA Aa E Ee falls flat\n\nBy the time AVM Kumaran's A Aa E Ee, directed by Sabapathy Dhakshinamurthy, rolls to an end, the only emotion you're conscious of is relief that the film has finally ended.\n\nLove thrillers? Watch Anu\n\nAnu can be enjoyed by the audience, who love thrillers. For Pooja Gandhi, this is certainly a big break. It is time that she chooses films where she can further demonstrate her talent.\n\nChickpete Sachagalu : Time pass fare\n\nChickpete Sachagalu has a good script but Magadi has not been able to get the right flavour from his artistes and technicians.\n\nAvoid Rocky\n\nKannada film Rocky is directed by well known editor Nagendra Aras who is also an occasional actor in Kannada films. His first directorial venture Heart Beats was a much better product than this eminently forgettable film called Rocky.\n\nHaage Summane</> is enjoyable\n\nHaage Summane, a Kannada film directed by Mungaru Male writer Preetham Gubbi, is a good effort and is evident that the entire team - from Gubbi, the writer and director, cinemetographer Krishna, music director Mano Murthy, lyricist Jayanth Kaikini, editor Deepu and the costume and art designers - has worked hard to create the film.\n\nCrazy Gopalan fails miserably\n\nIt is believed that the main audience for a Dileep movie is the kids who tug the elders in the family to the theatres. So, most of his films right from Meesamadhavan to CID Moosa and Inspector Garud have been humour based lowbrow entertainers that you can watch without exerting your brain. Most of these films were made by his friends.\n\nPanchamirtham is a laugh riot\n\nFor all those who've felt that Tamil moviedom hasn't really made use of fantasy and mythology elements in a modern set-up, or come up with a fun movie for children in recent times, Abhirami Ramanathan's maiden Tamil film Panchamirtham, directed by Raju Easwaran, has roped in mythological characters by the bucket-load for the kiddie-club.\n\nAbhiyum Naanum is poignant\n\nFor fathers who love their daughters, this is your pick. Definitely worth a watch.\n\nMargazhi Ragam : First of its kind\n\nAt first, Aghal Movies' Tamil film Margazhi Ragam may seem like a random collection of Carnatic concert compositions put together in a vaguely interesting fashion. The genius behind the feature is apparent to you only much later, as you truly get into the mood of the piece, along with the artistes.\n\nThiruvannamalai has a lot of masala\n\nLeave your brains at home and watch this Tamil film.\n\nDindukkal Sarathy works\n\nIf you're looking for a combination of humour and a reasonably good plot, here's your bet.\n\nStay away from Silambattam\n\nLakshmi Movie Makers's Tamil film Silambattam, directed by debutant director Saravanan, appears to have everything lined up for a B and C Centre win. But if you're a discerning viewer, stay away.\n\nNeninthe is hard-hitting, entertaining\n\nIn the Telugu film Neninthe, director Puri Jagannadh portrays the life of an assistant director played by Ravi Teja. A fairly good story, the film touches upon real issues in the cinema industry but has the ingredients of a commercial film.\n\nA below average Janumadha Gelathi\n\nJanumadha Gelathi is one of the weakest films of Dinesh Baboo known for making family entertainers. The film lacks a logical story line and has a bad narration. Srinagara Kitty impresses in this otherwise forgettable film.\n\nGive this Bullet a miss\n\nBullet starring Suresh Gopi and Kalabhavan Mani is an investigative story. Directed by Nizsar is only worth missing as it has no logic and fails to make any sense.\n\nDon't miss Akka Thangi\n\nAkka Thangi is a film of strong native fervour and realistic narration. The film is sentimental and sends a strong message that upholds truth and tradition. Shruthi, Kishore are excellent. Mahendar's direction and Manohar's music are top class.\n\nAvoid Mahesh Saranya Matrum Palar\n\nKool Productions' Tamil movie is a love-story that lacks spice. Avoid.\n\nPakal Nakshatrangal is pretentious\n\nThough Pakal Nakshatrangal boasts of Mohanlal and Suresh Gopi, this Malayalam movie is reduced to an exercise of intellectual self pleasure for writer Anup Menon and director Rajeev Nath.\n\nEllam Avan Seyal is an ego trip!\n\nR K Arts' Ellam Avan Seyal directed by Shaji Kailas could have been a taut murder thriller. Instead this Tamil movie panders to RK's ego mercilessly and is an exercise in frustration.\n\nPakal Nakshatrangal is pretentious\n\nThough Pakal Nakshatrangal boasts of Mohanlal and Suresh Gopi, this Malayalam movie is reduced to an exercise of intellectual self pleasure for writer Anup Menon and director Rajeev Nath.\n\nGanga Cauvery is average\n\nThe Kannada movie scores in its high class cinematography and top class songs. Cameraman H C Venu and music director K.Kalyan are the real heroes of the film. Newcomer Akshay is good in action sequences. Mahi is glamorous and emotes well. A watchable film.\n\nPoo is poetic\n\nThis Tamil movie might move slowly at places and not have a crackling climax but the ending fits in very well with the general tone of the story. As far as screenplays and performances go, Sasi has a winner on his hands. Few rural sagas are this refreshing or poetic.\n\nAvoid Maharshi\n\nThe Kannada film Maharshi is not only an extreme violent action drama without a credible story, but a perfect example of how a thoroughly incompetent and boring venture can be made.\n\nIt's Surya all the way\n\nAascar Films's Vaaranam Aayiram, directed by Gautam Menon and starring Surya in many varied roles, is a moving, if a longish tribute to an ideal father and a loving son. It's a common enough premise and is Surya's magnum opus but this one is inherently up-market.\n\nAvakkai Biryani is refreshing\n\nAvakkai Biryani, produced by Sekhar Kammula and Chandrasekhar Kammula is a contemporary, uplifting story which offers a slice of life. Anish Kuruvilla scripts and directs this simple sweet love story of an inter-religious romance which warrants a watch.\n\nYuvan disappoints\n\nPerhaps Yuvan Shankar Raja has spoilt you by his innovative work in his previous albums but in this one, he seems to have careened off after Silambarasan's tastes. He might have ended up satisfying the makers; the duo's track record might help in this album becoming a best-seller. But the collection, barring one or two moments, is nowhere near his best.\n\nFresh tunes\n\nPut together, V Selvaganesh seems to have turned out a collection which seems, on the surface, familiar. That said, he has taken the time and effort to present some variation, which accounts for the freshness in a couple of numbers. It looks like we can expect good things from debutant music director.\n\nNavagraha disappoints\n\nNavagraha directed by Dinakar is a thriller featuring Darshan and six other heroes who were born to seven well known villains of the Kannada film industry. It suffers because of weak narration and illogical story. Darshan is lively and new comer Dharma is impressive. Harikrishna scores with two good song compositions.\n\nTwenty: 20 is surprisingly good\n\nTwenty: 20, the mother of all multi-starrers comprising all the leading artists of Malayalam cinema, spreads an interesting smorgasbord.\n\nHo-hum\n\nIt looks like G V Prakash needs to re-group his resources after Kuselan or Seval's premise wasn't interesting enough, and he decided that ho-hum numbers is the way to go. The tunes are not too bad but somehow, you've come to expect a little more from this youngster who showed so much promise, to begin with.\n\nKathikappal disappoints\n\nGajanana Movies' Kathikkappal, directed Dinesh Selvaraj, Mani Ratnam's assistant, falls short of your expectations of a classy thriller.\n\nKousalya Supraja Rama is entertaining\n\nThis Telugu movie has something good to convey yet is not preachy. Though there is nothing new in the story the film offers decent entertainment. One can view it for Srikkanth's acting.\n\nChikkamagaloora Chikka Mallige entertains\n\nChikkamagaloora Chikka Mallige has some fantastic visuals and brilliant acting performances by veterans like C R Simha. Debutant Radhika Gandhi is cute and Shravan is lively. Though the story is not contemporary, the film engages the audience.\n\nKurukshetra disappoints\n\nKurukshetra, the Malayalam film based on Kargil War, directed by Major Ravi starring Mohanlal is technically superior, but ends up being loud and jingoistic.\n\nWorth a watch\n\nKotha Bangaru Lokam is a teenage romance set in a college backdrop. Varun Sandesh and Shweta Prasad make this film worth a watch. This entertainer is fresh with some good camera work, music and some thoughts on parenting.\n\nChintakayala Ravi entertains\n\nIt's Venkatesh show all the way in the movie Chintakayala Ravi. A triangular love story also starring Anushka and Mamta Mohandas, directed by Yogesh, this movie makes for some decent viewing for the family this holiday season.\n\nJayaraj is back in form\n\nGulmohar marks the debut of writer-director Ranjith as an actor, who plays the role of a revolutionary of the seventies. This film is worth watching for his performance and to see Jayaraj bounce back to form as a director.\n\nVamshi is just average\n\nPuneet and Prakash combination strikes again in Vamshi which however turns into an average fare. Prakash could have done a better job by selecting a logical story, though he has done well in getting good performance from Puneet and Lakshmi. R P Patnayak again disappoints with his inconsistent music composition.\n\nA sheer waste of time\n\nParthan KandaParalokam starring Jayaram and directed by Anil is sheer waste of time.\n\nA colourless Rainbow\n\nRainbow has a usual storyline but is dreary because of average storytelling and performances by Rahul, Sonal Chauhan and Sindhu Menon. The film lacks colour and punch.\n\nA big disappointment\n\nPatre Loves Padma has lots of weak points. Other than melodious music composition by Arjun and good cinematographic work by Cine Tech Soori, this movie has nothing going for it.\n\nBudhdhivantha is extremely satisfying\n\nUpendra shines as an actor and a writer in this thoroughly entertaining film with five heroines. Vijay Anthony's exceptional music and Giri's photography are the major highlights. Go and watch the film for Upendra.\n\nSakkarakkatti is anything but sweet\n\nKalaprabhu really needs to observe the world around him if he needs to come up with a plausible screenplay, dialogues and performances. Picturising A R Rahman's songs in SFX, throwing in American catch-phrases and making his characters swagger in designer wear won't make a good, peppy film.\n\nSouryam is a potboiler\n\nSouryam is another mainstream film with all the ingredients of a masala flick -- action, romance, sentiment and emotion. Director Siva adds nothing new to this formula.\n\nA feel good romance\n\nMoserbaer's Tamil movie, Raman Thediya Seethai, starring Cheran, Pasupathi and Nithin Sathya is a charming blend of realism, feel-good romance, logical screenplay and neat performances.\n\nSomething old, something new\n\nMallepuvvuu, set against the backdrop of terrorism, can be watched for its different theme and good performances (particularly by Bhumika) even though it has the commercial elements.\n\nPandhayam is ridiculous\n\nV V Creations' Pandhayam, directed by S A Chandrasekhar is said to be a serious, commercial movie but ends up being an unintentional laugh-riot.\n\nUrban audience will love M3V\n\nM3V is an inherently up-market movie, targeting a niche, urban audience. Its tale of affluent directors in search of their dreams, girls who aren't afraid to have sex before marriage and single parents who raise children certainly doesn't fall under the formulaic genre.\n\nA glimpse of Ilayaraja\n\nWhat can be said of the whole album is that when asked to produce a collection with a completely rural feel, S S Kumaran has tapped into his reservoir of Ilayaraja favourites and come up with songs that sound different for the first ten seconds -- and then merge into oft-heard melodies.\n\nRanjith's best so far\n\nThirakkadha, Ranjith's new film stars Prithviraj as a filmmaker struggling to find a new story for his film. It is a film that could be Ranjith's best so far.\n\nThalappavu is a must watch\n\nDirector Madhupal has taken a bold subject for his debut film Thalappavu. It deserves to be watched just for the performance of Lal.\n\nWatch Thaavalam for Suresh Gopi\n\nThaavalam, the Onam release of Suresh Gopi helmed by debutant Baiju 2D has nothing to boast about except for the star.\n\nUday Kiran shines in Gunde Jhallumandi\n\nDirected by Madan Gunde Jhallumandi is a love story against a college backdrop. The entertaining film has some good performances by Uday Kiran and Aditi Sharma.\n\nWatch Dheemaaku for Naveen Krishna\n\nDheemaaku ends up as an ordinary fare because of a weak script and poor directorial work. However Naveen Krishna shines. Arjun's music has some catchy tunes.\n\nPoi Solla Porom is fun and racy\n\nUTV Motion Pictures' and Four Frames' Poi Solla Porom, directed by Vijay is a remake of Khosla ka Ghosla -- and is a fun and racy reproduction.\n\nVery pedestrian\n\nAnkith Pallavi & Friends is a pedestrian love story with nothing new. Hence, there is nothing much to look for in it.\n\nA masterpiece from Girish Kasaravalli\n\nGulabi Talkies is an outstanding film with perfect casting and top class performances. Girish Kasaravalli once again comes with a master piece in a subject that is rarely touched by the Indian film industry.\n\nWorth a watch\n\nTalking Times Movies' Alibhabha, starring Director Vishnuvardhan's brother Krishna and directed by Neelan G Sekar, is definitely worth a watch, with its near-perfect blend of masala ingredients, a darn good story and an intelligent screenplay that'll make you stick to your seats.\n\nAshta Chamma is pure fun\n\nMohankrishna Indraganti, Ashta Chamma has good performances by Swati, Nani, Srini and Bhargavi. It is a nice joy ride for the family.\n\nAn entertainer\n\nGanesha Maththe Bandha is a clean and healthy comedy directed effectively by Phani Ramachandra. Anant Nag, Vinaya Prakash, Doddanna and Vijaya Raghavendra shine in their performances. Watch the film for a good two hour laugh.\n\nA wasted effort\n\nSNS Movies' Dhanam, starring Sangeetha, shows itself as a serious movie -- but ends up being a tired old flick that takes its viewers for a disappointing ride.\n\nOnly remixes work\n\nVijay Antony seems to have gone out in providing a commercial fare -- more than half the album is comprised of two past mega-hits, and one international hit. The album works because of these original artists. Regretfully, he can't claim credit for creating the 'remixed' songs (unless you take in lewd lyrics and remix credit). Pandhayam wouldn't make any impact without them.\n\nJeeva's last film is worth watching\n\nDhaam Dhoom, Jeeva's last film, certainly showcases the Tamil cinematographer-turned director's larger than life ambitions, and his talent for storytelling, that is no exaggeration. Right from frame one, where the titles race across magical graphic-induced map of Russian cities, you're prepared to sit up with eagerness.\n\nGo watch Jayam Kondaan !\n\nJayam Kondaan is a nice blend of the cinematic and logic. It is a good, watchable fare. Go for it.\n\nMaadesha : Enjoyable for Shivraj Kumar fans\n\nRavi Srivatsa's Kannada film, Maadesha, is quite different from the other recent gangster films. While most of those portrayed the protagonist as a larger than life character, Ravi Srivatsa shows the grey sides of an ambitious youngster, who takes to crime.\n\nNot great\n\nVidyasagar has made a name for himself as someone who understands the entertainment-percentage in movies, and delivers accordingly. He has done the same here as well, trying to provide a little bit for everyone. It's not terrible, but then it's not great either.\n\nAyudham is run of the mill\n\nAyudham brings Suresh Gopi as a cop again. Director Nishad has tackled few topical issues in this film and even made Thilakan mimic the CM. But, it ends up as a run of the mill stuff.\n\nAnthoo Inthoo : Well made\n\nVeera Shankar's Kannada film Anthoo Inthoo Preethi Banthu has some decent performances and good technical work.\n\nArjun : Not even for Darshan fans\n\nKannada film Arjun should serve as a warning to popular star Darshan, who has become very repetitive in the last three years -- he has featured in films with the same story, same dances, same fights and same one-liners.\n\nAppealing music by Vidyasagar\n\nNot much of Vidyasagar's recent work has been of the exemplary kind but this one seems to be making a definite attempt to veer away from stereotypical fare. The composer has tried to experiment with his own work, attempting variations on the same theme, and sometimes hitting a new, appealing note. Some of this album's numbers might be familiar, but on the whole, they do strike the right chord.\n\nNandadeepa is illogical\n\nNandadeepa has a story based on a folklore about a stepmother's exploitation of her stepson. The narration is amateurish though Master Manoj is impressive. Devaraj and Shruthi, on the other hand are passable.\n\nGive this one a miss\n\nKabadi Kabadi marks the launch yet another directorial team Sudheer Manu. But, there is no novelty in there approach. The story of this film starring Kalabhavan Mani and Mukesh is just a rehash of couple of old films.\n\nPasupathy, the real star of Kuselan\n\nKuselan would have been a great watch had the makers used the premise as a tool to explore the phenomenon that makes Rajni the enigma he is. In trying to serve up a 'Rajni film' when the original script had space only for a cameo, the makers have ended up with a film where the star is reduced to merely a walk-on role rehashing his most popular one-liners from recent times. But Rajni being what he is, don't be surprised if nobody complains.\n\nRajni, Jagapathi Babu shine\n\nKathanayakudu is a worthwhile watch for Rajnikanth and Jagapathi Babu's endearing performances and the climax.\n\nWatch Kuselan for Rajni\n\nIt is really a daunting task to remake a realistic sentimental film like Kadha Parayumbol with a Super Star like Rajnikanth. The biggest challenge is to meet the expectations of his fans. Director P.Vasu takes it as a challenge in Kuselan.\n\nRajnikanth's show all the way\n\nThe script falls flat at times, while the movie pulls you into two extremes -- Rajini's many extraordinary merits and Pasupathy's warm-hearted honesty. Obviously Pasupathy works more effectively but Rajini's star status is unquestionable. If only the dialogues and screenplay had been more effective and subtle. In the end, it's a definite treat for Rajini fans. For the others? The last twenty minutes will do.\n\nUllasanga Utsahanga is a good watch\n\nUllasanga Utsahanga is watchable for its feel-good and youthful appeal.\n\nDon't miss this Taj Mahal\n\nTaj Mahal blends pure romance with a right portion of sentiment and a bit of humour. And it is ably complimented by its excellent music and brilliant cinematography. The film also underlines the importance of parents' contribution to the future of their children, and how such an important factor is missed out by today's youngsters.\n\nNot Harris Jayaraj's best effort\n\nAs this is a Vishal movie, it means that a composer has to work within certain restraints, and though Harris Jeyaraj has tried to fashion it with his own music sense, the strain shows. Some flashes of the genius that created Vaseegara peek at you uncertainly, but all said and done, this hardly is Harris Jeyaraj's best effort.\n\nAn interesting offering from Yuvan\n\nDespite the strange and bizarre sounds and phrases, you have to admit that Yuvan Shankar Raja has the ability to make you listen -- even if it's only to analyze what exactly that particularly bizarre note you just heard was. And most times, he gets it right -- even springing surprises when you least expect it.\n\nSubramaniyapuram is a must-watch\n\nCompany Productions' Tamil film Subramaniyapuram is a sharp, realistic tale of two friends who find themselves unwitting mercenaries until their nemesis finds them.\n\nUliyin Osai fails\n\nJ Nandini Arts' Tamil movie Uliyin Osai, written by Kalaignar Karunanidhi and starring Vineeth, begins with promise but fails to deliver.\n\nMuniyandi... is watchable\n\nGD Lotus and Thiru Productions' Muniyandi Vilangiyal Moonramaandu is your usual romance/action flick but with a different treatment.\n\nMohanlal's Madampi is worth a watch\n\nDirector Unnikrishnan deserves a pat on his back for tweaking a formulaic and predictable storyline that will go down well with Mohanlal's fans as well as the general audience."
