        "text": "A sculptor from the National Institute ofÂ Design,Â Ahmedabad, wanting to make it big in films is quite rare. But Lekha Washington -- who had completed her first exhibition as a sculptor when she was barely 18 -- wanted to do something creative after she completed her Masters in Film Making from the famed institute.\n\n\"I was a veejay for the SS Music channel, and then moved on to do a couple of Tamil movies like Unnale Unnale and Framed. I shifted base from Mumbai to Chennai because of my films.Â My latest Tamil film is Jayamkondaan, opposite Vinay, andÂ is scheduled for release in June,\" says the pretty actress, who wants to come back to Mumbai.\n\nBut the reason why Lekha is in the news these days is because of her association with the Indian Premiere League.\n\n\"SETÂ MAX was conducting auditions and they did not find anyone in Mumbai,\" she says. \"So when I took the screen test, I was selected. I'm the latest roving anchor of IPL!\"\n\nSo how is she managing the cricket matches? \"I was a bit nervous initially,\" says the Goa-based girl, whoseÂ unique surname, Washington, comes from the mixed origins of their family.Â \"But I made up for that by reading and watching cricket matches. After the matches, I had to interact with the crowds. To be frank, my interaction withÂ people increased my knowledge of the game.\"\n\nSo which is her favourite team?Â \"Chennai Super Kings,\" she chimes.\n\nLekha is now on the lookout for a good Bollywood opportunity."
