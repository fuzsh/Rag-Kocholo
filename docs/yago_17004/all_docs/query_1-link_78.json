        "text": "The Vinay-Bhavana starrer, produced by Sathyajothi Films, is all set for an August-end release.\n\nPaving the way for biggies like Kuselan and Sathyam, this movie, whose audio launch was held over two months ago, it is all set to hit the screens this month end.\n\nComing from a production house that has been nitpicky in choosing only family-oriented healthy entertainers, the movie is said to be an interesting love story.\n\nDirected by R Kannan, a former assistant to Maniratnam for movies like Guru, Kannathil Muthamittal and Ayutha Ezhuthu, the music has been done by Vidyasagar, which is already famous.\n\nOne of the songs in the movie, Naan Varaindhu Vaitha, sung by Madhusree and Hariharan, was shot in the rarely captured mosque called Bibi-Khanym Mosque of Uzbekistan.\n\n“I told the story over two years ago and it has come out very well. We’ve not exaggerated anything in the story, which is about a relationship between Vinay, a civil engineer educated abroad, and Bhavana, a sprightly volleyball player in Madurai,” explains the director.\n\nHowever, the suspense element in the movie is an untold relationship between the main characters in the movie, Vinay, Bhavana and Lekha Washington.\n\nRelated Posts by Categories\n\n...."
