Robot the big budget movie by director Shankar, starring none other than Superstar Rajinikanth and Bollywood bomb Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has been having replacement of cameraman quite frequently since the project was announced.\n\nThe initial chose for shooting Rajini and Ash and the Robot was Nirav Shah, but he walked out. He was replaced by Thiru but looks like there has been differences with Thiru too and he has been now replaced by R. Ratnavelu.\n\nThe reason seems to be that Shankar has insisted his crew to be completely dedicated to Robot for the next 2 years and it is a difficult task for many to do. Lets hope Ratnavelu gets to be associated with the movie which will go down in history!!\n\nThe clean shaven look of Ajith which made many a hearts lose a beat in Billa is back. For the past few months Ajith who was seen with a beard has finished his shots of the flashback for his upcomming movie Aegan, which required him to sport a beard and has returned to his clean shaven, sauve look.\n\nAegan movie which has Ajith and Nayantara in the lead is directed by choreographer turned director Raju sundaram. For the past few months the shooting for the flash back scene was on which required Ajith Kumar to sport a beard. The shooting of these scenes is over in Hong Kong and now the stylish Ajith will be romancing Nayan and doing emotional scenes with Navdeep. Navdeep plays the role of younger brother for Ajith.\n\nActor Suman will be donning the baddie in the film along with Kannada actor Avinash. The music for Aegan is scored by Yuvan Shankar raja and cinematography by Arjunan. The movie also has actor Naseer, Suhasini Maniratnam playing important roles.\n\nFor all the promise director Mysskin displayed in his debut (Chithiram Pesuthadi), Anjaadhey is terribly disappointing. Using the same realistic, lower middle class setting, he has an Ajmal who simply cannot emote and a Naren who sits down half-way, holding a wall every time he’s even mildly surprised. Prasanna’s menacing turn is commendable for the actor but he comes across merely as a caricature - that extra shot glorifying him when he’s finally dead perhaps panders to his hero-image! But, the worst offenders are the 30 minute chaotic, mess of a climax in the sugarcane field; and Naren’s decision to drop both his guns and get into a hand combat with Prasanna, in the climax – he’s a cop dealing with a rapist for heaven’s sake; and this was meant to be a realistic film! While I did enjoy Mysskin’s film making style – an impoverished version of Gautam Menon, if I could describe it - Anjaadhey is a drab for most parts and definitely lacks the stupendous impact of the film maker’s debut. What went wrong? The bigger budget? Oh that’s terribly unfortunate, ‘cos instead of getting a better film, we have a self-indulgent film, with only occasional strokes of brilliance.\n\nFashion industry is booming these days and many fashion schools are blossoming due to this.

The postponement is said to be due to the roping in of more celebrities for the event. Eminent personalities like Jackie Chan, Amitabh Bacchan, Aishwarya Rai, Mohan Lal, Upendra, Chiranjeevi and many others will be present for the event.\n\nSONY BMG has bagged the audio rights of this movie Dashavatharam and is making preliminary adjustments for the great occasion of audio release. It is slated to be held at Nehru Indoor Stadium where full version of trailer will be released. Due to the postponement of the audio launch, industry sources expect a delay in the release of the movie, to May 2008.\n\nDashavataram features Kamal Haasan in ten different roles, the movie has Asin in the female lead role. Mallika Sherawat too dons a prominent character.\n\nThere is finally a title for Ajith’s upcomming movie with Raju Sundaram. The movie is titled Aegan meaning the ‘One and Only One’.Aegan, is also the word used in praise of Lord Shiva and means ‘unique’. Ajith recently returned to chennai after the first schedule of shooting for this Raju Sundaram directed movie from Hong Kong.\n\nThough the title sounds very much like a Tamil, it is actually a Sanskrit. This has raised many eyebrows because the recent Tamil films have only Tamil titles to take advantage of the tax concession extended by the state government.\n\nThe movie is said to be the remake of the bollywood blockbuster movie Main Hoon Na which had SRK in the lead role and directed by Farah Khan.\n\nThe lead pair of Billa is set to make waves again with Aegan. After much speculation on who is going to be the heroine of Ajith in the upcomming flick with Raju Sundaram, the wait is finally over and Nayantara has been signed in as the heroine opposite to Ajith Kumar.\n\nLots of leading names were considered for the role of Ajith’s heroine. Shriya Saran was the first actress considered but could not be finalised with date problems. When Shirya was ready with the dates Raju and Ajith were searching for a heroine in Bollywood. Names like Bipasha and Katrina Kaif were considered and rumoured to be finalised but it was Nayantara who took the final cake.\n\nThe movie being the remake of Main Hoon Na will see Nayan in the role of glamourous Sushmita. Nayantara, meanwhile, as already announced, will act in ‘Kuselan’ in Hyderabad, in which she is paired with superstar Rajinikanth.\n\nIts going to be a rocking 2008 for Nayan.\n\nAishwarya has finally signed on the dotted lines for Shankar’s upcomming movie Robot. This bollywood beauty has promised priority dates to Shankar when Robot finally starts rolling in May/June.\n\nThe buzz is that Aishwarya has been paid a bomb for the movie and it is said to be the highest amount ever paid to an actress. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is said to have confirmed to the media in an interview to a popular channel that she is doing Shankar’s Robot.\n\nRobot is already associated with big names like Superstar Rajinikanth, A.R Rahman, director Shankar, art director Sabu Cyril and now the addition of Aishwarya to the crew is just adding another feather to the already beautiful cap.\n\nWill all these Robot has all the ingredients to create history in Indian Cinema. Only time will tell.\n\nThere was a time when every other Tamil movie released had a English word in it, then due to the protest for this by some organisations and in-order to give importance to the Tamil language in Tamil movies, the state government announced a tax concession to the Tamil language movie title.\n\nThen came a series of title changes to avail this concession and some of the movie names were either place names or person names which had nothing to do with the initiative to develop Tamil language for which the tax concession was aimed at.\n\nThe State government has now announced that it will not henceforth give entertainment tax concession to Tamil movies whose titles bring down the esteem and glory of the language. In a release the government had announced that movies named in Tamil would be given tax concession. But it is seen in the recent past that many movie titles belittled the language. These movies will not be given entertainment tax concession the release added.\n\nShopping is always tough, it saps all our energy. That too shopping during festive time is much difficult.

He handled cinematography for movies like Kokki and Thirutham.\n\nHe then approced Prakash Raj with his script for Mayilu. Prakash liked the movie script and hence decided to produce the movie with Jeevan as the director. It was since then said that he will not be handling cinematography.\n\nBut on the request of director Selvan, who impressed everyone with his ‘Suri’, featuring Vignesh in the lead and introduced Jeevan as the cinematographer, Jeevan has agreed to handle camera again for Selvan’s next movie Krishna Leelai. The movie is being made under the Kavithalaya Banner. It will have actor Jeevan in the lead role. Jeevan will start with the movie after the Thotta.\n\nThe pooja of Kuselan movie will be held on March 7th in chennai. The movie stars Superstar Rajinikanth, Pasupathi, Meena, Nayantara in the lead roles. The shooting of the movie is expected to commence on March 15th at the Ramoji Rao Film City, Hyderabad.\n\nAs already known the Malayalam hit film ‘Kadha Parayumbol’ is remade in Tamil as ‘Kuselan’ though with slight changes in the script to suit the Tamil audience. The film pictures around two dear friends who have suffered a lot in their young age. As time passes they get separated. One goes on to become a super star.\n\nThe other one gets married, has three children and is leading a hand-to-mouth existence. As fate can have it the rich and popular superstar comes to the same village where his friend lives, for a shooting. But the poor friend refuses to meet him. The actor coming to his friend’s small home to meet him and what happens after that forms the story.\n\nDogs are man’s best friend, true to these words they definitely are.

And the main reason for this is their mind boggling high remuneration which they demand for the joint appearances.\n\nAamir Khan’s most awaited film, the Hindi remake of ‘Ghajini’, is likely to be delayed by about two weeks, as the director of the film A R Murugadoss was arrested by the Chennai police on the complaint of the original producer Salem Chandrashekhar.\n\nThe producer had accused the director and the new producers that they had not bought the rights for the film from him and hence it was wrong on the part of the new film makers to make the film.\n\nHowever, the new producer of the film Madhu Varma has denied the allegations of any illegality and claimed to have bought the rights of the film from the original producer four years back at the time of release of the film. She says that even a Telugu version had been released by her around three years back and at that time there was no such objections raised by anyone.\n\nWhatever may be the real reason behind arrest of the director Murugadoss, but the audiences will have to wait for some more time to see the bald pate of Aamir Khan in the upcoming flick. As due to arrest of the director, Aamir Khan’s shooting spell has been postponed for the time being.\n\nThe film has Aamir Khan playing the main lead opposite hot and sexy Jiah Khan of ‘Nishabd’ fame. Asit, who had played the main female lead in the original Tamil blockbuster, is also in the film playing the same role.\n\nThis policy is valid from 05 March 2008\n\nThis blog is a personal blog written and edited by me.

They were also thinking on the lines of Hrithik playing the villain himself but that will entail the presence of three Hrithiks—Rohit from ‘Koi Mil Gaya’, Krishna from ‘Krrish’ and the third from this upcoming sequel.\n\nTo avoid this triple presence of Hrithik Roshan in the upcoming ‘Krrish 2’, Rakesh Roshan is hunting for a suitable hero to fill in the slot of villain opposite Hrithik in the film. The problem lies in the fact that they want someone of the equal stature of hero to play the negative character but after Shah Rukh declined the role, no one is willing to take it up for the fear of image change in the industry.\n\nCurrently, the Roshans are having a serious debate over the climax sequence of the film and any final decision in this regard is not expected before middle of the year and only after that the movie will go on the floor. The buzz doing the rounds in the industry is that Rakesh Roshan might not direct the upcoming sequel and may rope in Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra of ‘ Rang De Basanti’ fame to direct it. But Rakeysh Mehra is said to be currently busy with his ‘Dilli-6’ and would consider taking up any other project only after that.\n\nIt may be recalled that earlier combinations of Hrithik Roshan and Rakesh Roshan have always produced blockbusters at the box office. They had started with ‘Kaho Na Pyar Hai’, a simple love story between Hrithik and Amisha Patel, which went on to become a super hit film at the box office due to actor’s dancing abilities and hit music. Similarly, ‘Koi Mil Gaya’ introduced an alien in bollywood films and the experiment proved super successful at the box office. Finally, ‘Krrish’ gave the superhero tag to Hrithik Roshan and made him one of the top icons of bollywood who could perform breathtaking stunts of international standards.\n\nHowever, currently Rakesh Roshan and Hrithik Roshan are concentrating on their home production to be directed by Anurag Basu. Hrithik is playing the lead in the film, while Brazilian bombshell Bruna Abdullah essays the character of a salsa dancer\n\nAkshay Kumar, the martial art specialist Khiladi of bollywood, is all set to sign an endorsement deal with Spykar denim brand for a whopping amount of Rs 1.5 crore per day.\n\nThe Khiladi will allot the whole day to the company which they can utilize by shooting their commercials, conducting photo shoots or organizing events. Afterwards the denim company can use the name of Akshay Kumar for the promotion of their brand for one whole year.\n\nBut if the company wants to shoot for two days, it will have to shell out to Akshay Kumar a sum of Rs 3 crore for the work and then they can use his name for two years in a row. The company is giving this mind boggling amount to Akki as they want him to become not only a brand ambassador of the company but also a style icon for today’s youth. And Akshay, with his athletic body and youthful charm, was perfectly suitable for their new ad campaign.\n\nAkki has been roped in to play the role of a brand ambassador to Spykar denims by his schooldays friend Sanjay Vakharia, who is currently heading the marketing division of the said company. Vakharia had zeroed in on Akki from the start and never thought of any other star projecting the image of a youth icon.\n\nSources say that this is the highest amount being paid to any star for an endorsement by a company. Akshay Kumar has successfully cashed in on his new status of a super star of bollywood after he gave a series of super hit films at the box office like ‘Namastey London’ with Katrina Kaif, ‘Heyy Babyy’ with Vidya Balan and ‘Bhool Bhulaiya’. Now, he is very careful in the matter of endorsements and wants to do only those ads which not only bring big moolah but also make him a style icon.\n\nThe buzz doing the rounds in the industry is that not only endorsements but even in movies, Akki has been demanding and getting around Rs 20-30 crore per film and producers are not averse to paying him as his films are getting great response at the box office. Akki is trying to fully cash in on the ongoing opportunity of making money while the sun shines and is no more contented with the tag of the biggest star. He is trying to make as much moolah as he can and his upcoming big budget films like Yash Raj’s ‘Tashan’, Vipul Shah’s ‘Singh is Kinng’, etc are likely to increase his price further.\n\nAkshay Kumar, the martial art specialist handsome hunk of bollywood, performed a never before dare devilry stunt for the Percept Picture Company’s upcoming movie ‘8x10’ under water recently.\n\nThe adventurous sequences required the actor to be tied up in chains and perform the fighting sequences with other co actors in a swimming pool. If anything would have gone wrong that would have created major problem for the health of the actors.\n\nAkki had refused to take the help of a stunt man as he wanted to give the sequence a touch of realism and earnestness in the film. But before doing that sequence, Akshay Kumar had undergone a major training programme for underwater swimming in Bangkok. He also successfully cleared the test to get a paddy instructor’s certificate, which is given only after one is found efficient in underwater swimming.\n\nThe particular fighting sequence was shot by the director Nagesh Kukunoor last week in Chembur and it has turned out to be amazing. The whole unit was very excited and impressed with Akki’s professionalism. The film belongs to psychological super thriller genre and Akki’s super athletic physique perfectly suited the role. In fact, Akshay Kumar is playing the role of a superhero in the film, though he will not have the super natural powers like other superheroes.\n\nAs the reports suggest Akshay Kumar’s stock is certainly going to rise further with this underwater action sequence in the film. In any case, he has already become one of the most successful bollywood heroes at the box office with giving super hit films back to back last year. For instance, his ‘Namastey London’ with Katrina Kaif, ‘Welcome’ again with Katrina, Anil Kapoor and Nana Patekar, ‘Heyy Babyy’ with Vidya Balan and ‘Bhool Bhulaiya’ again with Vidya Balan were super successful at the box office.\n\nEven his upcoming film ‘Tashan’ from the stable of famous banner Yash Raj Films is a very sleek fare being made with lavish budget and is expected to showcase Akki’s histrionics in a stunning way. Vipul Shah’s forthcoming film ‘ Singh Is Kinng’, which was recently extensively shot in Australia, too projects Akki’s image in flattering light. So the future is bright for Akki and more so if he can perform these daredevilry action sequences under water too!!\n\nHeard this??The real cause behind the ugly spat between sizzling hot Katrina Kaif and her hot headed boyfriend Salman Khan that took a few days ago in a suburban coffee shop, has turned out to be the contentious issue of an item number by Katrina.\n\nSallubhai was insisting that Katrina perform an item number in his upcoming film ‘ Wanted Dead or Alive’ but Kat was adamant on not doing it, as she considered it to be below her newly acquired bollywood status and more befitting of a B grade heroine.\n\nSources say that on the day of quarrel, Salman Khan was seen requesting Katrina Kaif to do a favor by dancing in the film as ‘ Wanted Dead or Alive’ had Ayesha Takia in the female lead and required a hot item song to make it more attractive to the audiences. But Katrina Kaif was not amenable to his requests and kept repeating that doing item song would be an embarrassing proposition and would adversely affect her big film producers.\n\nAt this Sallubhai got furious and started shouting but Katrina Kaif too was in no mood to back out and responded in the same manner. This led to people from other tables giving them attention and finally making the whole affair a funny episode being watched by so many people.\n\nHowever, now it has come to light that Sallubhai’s ultimatum of that day worked and Katrina gave her assent to do an item song for the Prabhudeva directed ‘Wanted Dead or Alive’. Now, Katrina Kaif and director Prabhudeva are trying to work out an amicable date for the final shooting of the item number.\n\nThe buzz doing the rounds in the industry is that Katrina did not want to do item numbers because recently she had signed some big movies with big time producers and her stock in bollywood gone up after hits like ‘Namastey London’ with Akshay. Some of the big films that she has been working in include ‘Singh is Kinng’ with Akshay Kumar, ‘Race’ with Saif etc. Besides these, Katrina has also signed a Yash Raj film opposite John Abraham and another two film contract with TV18.\n\n‘Wanted Dead or Alive’ is a Hindi remake of Telugu super hit film ‘Pokhri’ and has Salman Khan and refreshing Ayesha Takia in the lead. The Hindi remake is being produced by Boney Kapoor and directed by south dancing sensation Prabhudeva while choreography is being looked after by Prabhudeva’s brother.\n\nRani Mukherji, the gorgeous bong beauty of bollywood, is miffed with Saif Ali Khan and a cold war is on between the two bollywood stars.\n\nIt came to the fore recently when Saif Ali sent a message to Rani to join him and Kareena to go out for some shopping and sight seeing in Bangkok, where Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukherji were shooting for Kunal Kohli’s upcoming film. But Rani Mukherji refused to accompany the much- in- love couple for any outing. Kareena Kapoor, who is Saif’s girlfriend, had gone to Bangkok to spend some quality time with him after taking a day off from hectic shooting spells back in India.\n\nThe insiders say that the cold war between Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukherji is not a recent phenomenon and had started during the shooting of Siddharth Anand’s ‘Tara Rum Pum’ in New York, and since then their relationship has never been on even keel. There was a heated argument over some point between Saif and Rani and they both had started shouting in public. The matter became so serious that Saif even asked the director Siddharth Anand to shift him to a different hotel in which Rani Mukherji would not be present.\n\nHowever, despite of the ongoing cold war between the two, Saif and Rani have done some advertisement and films together to the surprise of many. But sources in the know of things say that there was professional compulsion for them to act together in films and ads and not any willingness on their part to work together.\n\nIt was the super success of ‘Hum Tum’ at the box office that made the producers and advertisers to approach the actors to feature together. Their on- screen chemistry in the film was terrific and much appreciated by the audience and this forced them to work together despite of having a distinct dislike for each other.\n\nThe sources further add that Rani and Saif are thorough professionals when shooting for a film or a commercial and hence they could work together in films even after having not so pleasant relationship and the directors did not have any problem in working with them.\n\nProfessionally Rani might have a cold war with Saif but in her love life Rani has everything going for her. Recently, she was romantically linked with famous producer-director Aditya Chopra and buzz doing the rounds in the industry is that they may soon tie the knot. Sources point out that Aditya Chopra’s recent divorce from his wife was a step taken in that direction and the wedding is very much on the cards. Even Yash Chopra and his wife, who had earlier objected to Rani Mukherji’s marriage with Aditya, have conceded to the persistent demand of their son.\n\nDeepika Padukone, the sizzling hot sexy bombshell of bollywood who made her dream debut with Shah Rukh Khan in Om Shanti Om, has split with boyfriend Yuvraj Singh, the dashing Indian cricketer, and is back with her old flame Ranbir Kapoor.\n\nThe main reason for the break up is said to be over possessiveness of Yuvraj Singh regarding Deepika’s skimpy outfits and party habits. The actress did not want her budding bollywood career to be affected by these restrictions and hence preferred to say bye bye to her relationship with Yuvraj Singh.\n\nThe buzz doing the rounds in the industry is that Deepika and Yuvraj were deeply involved with each other and were very serious about future of their relationship. Yuvraj had even introduced the sexy actress to his mother and other relatives at his birthday party held in a suburban hotel.\n\nBut all this changed drastically after Deepika tasted the success of ‘Om Shanti Om’ and offers from prestigious banners came pouring in. She became busy with story sessions from different producers and could not find enough time for Yuvraj Singh who started sulking over this negligence.\n\nBut the matter came to head when Deepika went to Australia for the shooting of Yash Raj Films’ new movie with Ranbir Kapoor. The rumours of her increasing proximity to Ranbir Kapoor reached Yuvraj Singh and he demanded an explanation from the actress, but instead of answering she started avoided his calls. It was then that Yuvraj Singh and Deepika had a huge showdown over Ranbir and the relationship was over.\n\nAfter keeping low profile for a while about her relationship with Ranbir Kapoor, Deepika was seen openly flaunting the new camaraderie at a recent party hosted by Farah and Aqueel. They were seen not only holding hands but also whispering sweet nothings to each other like a couple in much love. They even kissed each other without caring a damn about the gathering.\n\nIt may be recalled that Deepika Padukone and Ranbir Kapoor had been dating each other even before the release of their respective debut films ‘Om Shanti Om’ and ‘ Saawariya’ but could not continue it due to objections from director Sanjay Leela Bhansali. In fact, Sanjay Bhansali, who was directing ‘Saawariya’ with Ranbir, did not want him to be highlighted for any other reason before the release of film, as that would have affected the box office chances of his magnum opus.\n\nBut this time there is no such hitch and on the contrary Deepika-Ranbir came closer during the Australian spell of Yash Raj Films being directed by Siddharth Anand and the director would certainly like to cash in on this real love story to make his upcoming film hit at the box office.\n\nAamir Khan, the perfectionist actor of bollywood who plays the lead role in the Hindi remake of ‘Ghajini’, has acquired a perfect six pack abs in flat twenty one days to complete a dance number of the film which was earlier shot in October in South Africa. Aamir Khan had to undergo rigorous training and dieting to achieve this seemingly miraculous figure as the choreographer Ahmed Khan felt that he was too plump looking in comparison to his South African look, and the dance number would look odd with two different looks of the Khan in it. Later, the dance number was completed at the Film City with Aamir Khan giving his four days to choreographer Ahmed Khan for doing this. Sources say that the dance number has turned out excellent and will be used as one of the highlights of the film during promotion campaign. Sources say that the dance number required Aamir Khan to flaunt his six pack abs and accordingly he had acquired it for the month long South African spell in October. But at that time, even after completing the song choreographer wanted to introduce some variations in it and had asked the Khan to give some extra time. Aamir Khan was already neck deep in his home production ‘Taare Zameen Par’ and so could not give the required time to re-shoot some portion and returned to India.\n\nNow, after the release of his directorial venture ‘Taare Zameen Par’, when Aamir had time and wanted to shoot for the remaining portion of the dance sequence, choreographer Ahmed Khan felt that Aamir did not have the same physique and continuity of the number will be disturbed. Aamir did not insist on shooting and instead asked for three weeks to get back into shape and to everyone surprise he kept his promise. The film is a Hindi remake of Tamil super hit film ‘Ghajini’ being directed by Murugadass. While Aamir Khan is playing the main lead in the film, Asit, who had played the female lead in the original version, will depict the same character in this Hindi remake. Jiah Khan, the sexy bombshell of bollywood, also plays a pivotal character opposite Aamir Khan in the film. In any case, Aamir Khan’s perfectionist ways has paid him handsomely and the recent example of it was his home production ‘ Taare Zameen Par’. It may be recalled that the film was initially being directed by Amol Gupte but perfectionist Aamir was not satisfied with his direction and took over the reigns of direction in his own hands. The result was super sensitive and super cool film about a special child, appreciated by masses and classes alike, and winning Aamir several prizes as a director and actor. Perhaps perfectionist Aamir wants to make his ‘Ghajini’ too a super cool film …..and why not…..keep it up!!\n\nAishwarya Rai, one of the most beautiful women of the world, has been asked by the makers of sci-fi thriller ‘Robot’ to lose at least six kg for her character in the film. The film requires Aishwarya to perform some breathtaking stunts and that would need a reed thin figure from the gorgeous actress. Not one to waste time in professional matters, Ash has already started working out rigorously in the gym and living on a strict dietary regime. Sources say that Aishwarya Rai is very excited about her role in this sci-fi thriller being directed by the ace director Shankar and going whole hog to lose the weight she had gained for her character in Ashutosh Gowariker’s ‘Jodhaa Akbar’. She played the lead role of Queen Jodhaa Bai and needed to put on weight to suit the time and place of the character.\n\nBut now Shankar wants Aishwarya to work on her looks before the film goes on the floors and so she has started dieting in right earnest and living on sprouts and juices or soups. Shankar is very meticulous about his films and does not go ahead even if a minute detail is not in accordance with his plans. His earlier blockbusters include Rajnikant’s super duper hit ‘Sivaji’ and Kamal Hassan’s ‘Hindustani.’ Aishwarya, the svelte beauty of B town, will be acting in this film opposite southern super star Rajnikant, who accepted the film after biggies from bollywood like Shah Rukh, Aamir and Hrithik refused to essay the role of the main protagonist in it. Probably, bollywood biggies could not agree with creative inputs given to them by the director Shankar and differences persisted between them. The story of the film revolves around a scientist who develops a ‘Robot’ with the intention of making it take care of his physically disabled child. Initially, everything goes according to plan but later the ‘Robot’ goes out of control and kills some people. The disgusted scientist is forced to terminate his own invention in the end.\n\nAishwarya Rai had become very selective in the choice of her films after marriage with Abhishek Bachchan and this was one of the few films that she agreed to act in. Although there were some rumours that Ash too has opted out of the film after none of the bollywood biggies agreed to do it, but all that proved wrong and she is going ahead with the Shankar’s film. Though Aishwarya’s recently released film ‘Jodhaa Akbar’, wherein she played the regal character of Jodha Bai, has not done well at the box office but she looked stunningly beautiful in the film. Her graceful presence and acting was appreciated by one and all. She looked every inch the character that she played on screen, Jodha Bai.\n\nBlogging gives me a sense of pleasure, and all men and women around the globe blog and share their knowledge.

Vishal is being chased by the villans in this scene and the smart police attired Vishal trying to elude them. The scene running to 7 minutes in the film would be shot over 20 days on various locations like Tambaram bypass, Ennore, Ramojirao Film City, Pattinapakkam etc. The car scene is vital for the movie and is shot in the hollywood style. The scene is being shot under the supervision of renowned Hollywood Visual Effects person Craig A Mumma, stunt master Kanal Kannan, and director Rajasekhar.\n\nVishal plays the role of a police officer who is an encounter specialist. For this role, the diligent actor has done an extensive study on the life and work of police. Popular Kannada star Upendra and Telugu actor Katta Srinivas Rao play villains.\n\nAR Rahman has given music to lot of Tamil movies which have been dubbed into Telugu and gone on to become good hits. A.R Rahman will be composing music for Pawan Kalyan starrer Puli movie. This movie is being directed by our very own S.J Suryah.\n\nHe has promised to compose and finish the songs by 2009. Pawan Kalyan will start with this S.J Suryah movie after he completes Jalsa and an home production in which he is acting as a hero too. S.J Suryah also has a couple of movies to finish including Vil in which he acts as a hero.\n\nIt is rumoured that a whopping amount was paid to Rahman to compose the music for this film. It is also said that the producer of Puli is willing to go upto Rs. 35 crore as far the films total budget is concerned.\n\nHe’s a superstar who can always bank on his fans. And now other stars in the Tamil Film industry are banking on the Rajini factor for superstardom.\n\nAfter the success of the Rajinikanth classic Billa in 2007 with actor Ajith in the lead, other stars too are hoping to cash in on the Rajini magic.\n\nOne of them is the superstar’s son-in-law Dhanush, who has named his film Polladhavan after an old Rajinikanth hit.\n\nEven actor Vikram is said to be keen on remaking the old Rajini hits Moondru Mugam. And that’s not all.\n\n“Murattukaalai is a movie that I’d like to be part of if ever it’s remade,” said actor Vijay.\n\nOld Rajinikanth film titles have been registered with the Tamil Film Producer Council by producers who intend to remake them either on the lines of the original scripts or with changed storylines.\n\nThe list includes old hits like Thillu Mullu, Mullum Malarum and Moondru Mugam. So why this mad-rush for Rajni film titles?\n\n“Everybody thought let’s capitalize on Rajinikanth’s fans for the initials days. So may persons have registered Rajini film titles. One or two of them are the original producers of the Rajini films. All other producers they’ve taken the title. They may do some other story for it,” says Anbalaya Prabhakaran, Vice-President, T F Producer’s Council.\n\nRemake a Rajinikanth film or at least borrow its title, that seems to be success mantra right now. As for the actors, if they can’t be a superstar in real life, they might at least be his avtaar in reel life.\n\nDirector Shankar while talking about the film Robot in an interview given to a TV channel has said that the title of the movie might change.\n\nThe buzz is that the State Government’s decision to provide tax-exemption to movies titled in Tamil is the reason that this name change might come through. The Tamil film producers and directors are these days found with Tamil dictionary to choose Tamil titles for their films to avail this concession.\n\nOn a 100 crore budget, Robot movie will definitely need the entertainment tax-exemption. There was also a debate over the title of Shivaji, if it was a Tamil name or not. Even with the debate that Shivaji was a Marathi name, the State government accepted that Shivaji is a Tamil title indeed, and the movie was exempted from entertainment tax. This might not work out for Robot, or will they add Robot to Tamil dictionary as well and provide entertainment tax exemption? Only time can tell!!\n\nThe meaning of Robot would be “mechanical servant”. So what would the name of Robot movie be after the name change? Any suggestions??\n\nMarmayoghi is all set to start by the third week of February. The film which was initally produced under the banner of Bharath Bala will now be co-produced by none other than Walt Disney Productions.\n\nBharat who has earlier worked with AR Rahman in Vande Mataram has roped in the Mozart of Madras in this film. It will also see Kamal Hassan and AR Rahman coming together again.\n\nMarma Yoghi is a historical story, set in the seventh century. The film is also said to become the most expensive film in India with the budget exceeding 120 crore. Rajinikanth’s Robot with a budget of more than 100 crore will be stiff competation for Marmayogi.\n\nMarmayogi is the remake of 1951 MGR and Anjali Devi starrer movie with the same name. The story is based on the novel by Marie Corelli - Vendetta, A Story of One Forgotten.\n\nHema Malini has already been signed for the movie. The hunt for the other heroines(two more) is on. Buzz is that Asin is one of the heroines. Kamal has made a trip to Thailand to find out suitable locations for Marmayogi.\n\nAfter the humongous success of Billa Ajith is all set to start his next movie with Raju Sundaran in Hong Kong on the 18th of this month. Ajith has already flown to Hong Kong for this and the shooting will have some fight scenes picturised on Ajith.\n\nRaju Sundaram who was almost at his wits end finding a suitable co-star for this Ajith starrer flick is believed to have finally settled down for Bollywood bombshell Bipasha Basu. Raju is said to have paid a huge sum and signed the actress on.\n\nAjith who is now the proud papa of a baby girl is missing his daughter already. He calls her by her pet name ‘Jaan’ and is going to name his little angel very soon.\n\nHeroine Namitha might still believe she is slim. Tamil cinema viewers have a altogether a different say in the matter. They have always had beem partial to plumpy female stars, she has a lot of takers in Tamil film Industry.\n\nThat’s how she has remained much sought after star in Chennai. In one way, she has broken the record of Kushboo. Remember the white and round and puffy Kushboo Idlies? The most favorite dish across Tamilnadu. These have been renamed to ‘Namita Idlies’ now!\n\nWell just have to see what other dishes go the Namitha way!!\n\nVikram is finally a relieved man now. His Bheema has finally seen the lights after a gap of three years. Talking about this the actor says that he did Bheema for its unique climax.\n\nAfter Majaa, Vikram did not do anyother movie because of his commitment to Bheema. The price he paid was almost 12 crore, the actor says. He had a one and half crore personal loss and upto 10 crore loss for not accepting anyother movies during this time. The film Bheema has been sold for 23 crores and is expected to fetch a distributors share of 1 crore in Tirunelveli-Tanjore belt, which normally happens only for blockbusters.\n\nThe actor is open to all kinds of roles and is willing to experiment his roles, but wants to work only with experianced directors.
