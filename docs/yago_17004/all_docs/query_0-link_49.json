        "text": "\"The looks of certain actors automatically match some roles and hence, casting is very important part of storytelling. I've cast Vemal and Soori (in my film) because I felt nobody else would fit in their characters like they do,\" said Kannan.\n\nSlated to release November 7, the movie also features Priya Anand and Vishakha Singh in important roles.\n\nRural characters are mostly recursive in Kannan's films. If Bhavana played a Madurai-based role in Jayamkondaan, Tamannah was seen as Theni-based character in Kanden Kadhal. In Oru Oorlaa, Vemal and Soori will be seen playing remote rural characters.\n\n\"I have gone a step further and explored characters against the backdrop of a remote village. I can't convince audiences by portraying Vemal and Soori as doctors because they are apt for rural characters. With Priya, it's easier to convince audiences that she's a doctor. She's someone like Shalini from Alaipayuthey,\" he said.\n\nOut of the four films Kannan has made so far in his career, excluding Oru Oorlaa, two have been remakes and the rest have been his original stories. He said that the off-beat presentation and the fact that it's his original script will make his latest film 'different'.\n\n\"The flashback sequence will be one of the highlights of the story. It will be extremely fresh,\" he added."
