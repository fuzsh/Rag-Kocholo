        "text": "Cinematographer-turned-director, late Jeeva picked up an upcoming model, Vinay Rai from Bangalore, shorten his name to just Vinay and then cast him as the hero of his film, Unnale Unnale.\n\nUnfortunately, Jeeva did not get to see the success of his film as he passed away in Moscow while shooting for Dhaam Dhoom, a few weeks after the release of Unnale Unnale.\n\nOn the eve of the release of his second film, Jayam Kondaan directed by Kannan, an assistant of Mani Ratnam, Vinay tells Shobha Warrier more about the film and working with Jeeva. Excerpts:\n\nIt has been more than a year since your first film Unnale Unnale was released. It was a big hit. Now your second film is releasing on August 29. Are you nervous?\n\nYes, I am nervous. I have done my duty and now the public has to decide.\n\nWhat made you choose Jayam Kondaan as your second film?\n\nIt was the producers of the film who introduced me to Kannan, the director. Apart from the fact that he was an assistant director to Mani Ratnam for almost six or seven years, the story was very simple and straight forward.\n\nHis confidence in the script also made me say yes to the film without any hesitation. Once we started shooting for the film, we were like family. The six months we were together went by in a jiffy.\n\nAs far as portraying my character goes, Kannan wanted it to be as real as possible -- from the way I shrugged my shoulders to raising my eyebrows. He has reduced melodrama to the minimum. It is the story of a common man. I would not say it would happen to everyone but it happens quite often.\n\nText: Shoba Warrier"
