        "text": "Today morning as usual I and my friends, Arun and Nithya, went for coffee and as always the main topic of discussion was movies. We ended up in a terrific argument and I doubt if someone saw us fighting like mad.\n\nThe idea of this topic in my blog is just to share our discussion and also to welcome your valuable views about the topic. I will better jump into the topic straight way..\n\nArun started talking about Salaam Cinema, a movie directed by Mohsen Makhmalbaf, which he saw in the weekend. Our argument started about the director’s experimental movies. Arun was so excited about these experimental movies. I guess it was inspiring for a budding filmmaker like him. I am first a big fan of movies rather than an editor.\n\nSo I started the argument saying that director should reach the audience. Ultimate goal of a movie is to take message to the viewers. If they fail to do it I feel somewhere the director has lost track. I am not against experimental movies. They are inspiring. Still only A class audience watch them.( In cinema, A class audience we call as the highly educated audience, B class are middle class audience and C class are the audience living in every corner of your country and state) People generally say that C class audience are the major viewers of a movie. If not in other countries, in Tamil Nadu it works this way.\n\nComing back to the topic, I feel that a director should do both commercial and experimental movie. By doing commercial movies he is slowly bringing the audience to watch experimental movies without their knowledge. In a way we are bringing good cinema to them. That is how I feel we can change the audience taste.\n\nHow long are we going to give formula movies to them and give a lame excuse that they like only that. Tollywood or Telgu industry had always been commercial with Balakrishna stopping train. But now see the quality of movies they are giving. Aarya, happy days, anand, etc.. (I have watched only few) all these are commercial movies but they are away from the usual commercial movie. When these directors take an experimental movie I feel that audience will surely watch them even though it might not relate to them. Slowly the trend will change, may not drastically or quickly but will surely change in future.\n\nA director has to create that sort of a platform for the budding film makers. It’s easy to convey message to a literate. The challenge lies taking the same challenge to an illiterate. So I think the directors should take that challenge.\n\nI am not sure whether I am right but I welcome your valuable comments to enrich my thoughts. Of course opinion differs.\n\nIts been more than a month since I watched a movie. I am so afraid to go out on weekends. Sun is literally burning everyone out one the road. Sitting in AC all week days makes me further sick seeing the sunlight. Somehow I managed to see Santhosh Subramaniam last weekend at my aunt’s place. My brother always makes sure we watch a movie together whenever I manage to pop into his house. Maybe it’s really late to share my views about this movie Santhosh Subramaniam. Still I would like share few things about the movie which I found interesting.\n\nI have always avoided watching the movie since I had already watched Bommarillu (Telgu version of the movie) three times. And I was pretty sure this is not going to be anyway different except the language and the artists. To my happiness the movie had been a literal remake of Bommarillu. You might wonder why I am happy. I can never tolerate a movie remade in a horrible way. Some things are good as they are, especially when it touches your heart.\n\nThe movie directed by Raja, casting Jeyam Ravi , Jenalia, Prakash Raj, Sayaji Shinde and lot more is good treat for summer holidays. A beautiful love story, taken in a best way attracting people of all ages. Recently this is one movie in which parents can watch with their kids and teenagers can watch with their parents. Fun and joy is guaranteed. What else you require in a movie?\n\nEnough of my campaign let me come back to the story. More than a love story it’s a movie that describes the relationship between a father and son, father and daughter. Both are in either pole. One relation forces you into everything with its love and care while the other gives you complete freedom with the same love and care. The movie goes on how these relations come to medium state.\n\nJeyam Ravi is forced by his father to do everything of his father’s choice with his illusion of trying to give him the best right from shoes to shirts, job to marriage. Jeyam ravi decides he will take up a career he likes and get married to a girl he loves. This were a difference occurs between the father and son.\n\nJenelia brought up by a father leads a free life doing whatever she likes in life. She is very open and frank whereas Jeyam ravi is two different personalities in and outside the house. He falls in love with her. Prakash Raj who is completely against this accepts jenelia to stay with them to prove his son this is not going to work out.\n\nThe confusion starts when jenelia lands up in the house. So how the story goes, how the tussle between father and son, father and daughter gets solved. How the love birds stick together is the climax of the story.\n\nThe montage songs in telgu you will find Siddarth wearing trendy t-hirts. In tamil they had followed the proper costumes according to the story. Everyone has done a good job. Jeyam Ravi has done justice to the role. Only thing you find missing is the siddarth cuteness and is pity face he showes in the movie. If you had not seen the telgu version, you would really love it.\n\nGenerally people think that remake movies may not prove a directors skill. A director is actually in a critical position. He should do justice to the movie. He should give the real feel of the movie to the audience without affecting the original one, if they had watched before. He should also show the difference in the movie. I like movies remade without affecting the original ones. Everyone doesn’t end up watching movies in all other languages. A good movie should definitely be reached to all audience. A good work and justice is done to the movie."
