        "text": "Brinda is one of the best choreographers of South Indian cinema and Bollywood. Her name comes in the list of the greatest artist of the 21st century. Brinda through her talent and dance moves made it to the South Indian film industry and Bollywood also. Brinda has worked in the glamour industry for past 20 years as a professional choreographer. Brinda dedicated all her life to choreographing and assisting various notable actors.\n\n...\n\nVivekanandan is the birth name of the versatile comedian Vivek. He is introduced by the legendary director Balachander through the film Manadhil Urudhi Vendum. It is the film in which Ramesh Arvind was also introduced. They both acted as brothers of Suhasini in that film. He got famous through Pudhu Pudhu Arthangal, as his dialogue Innaikku Seththa Naalaikku Paal reached the viewers well. He acted with top actors and reached fame within a short span. He performed with Rajini in Uzhaippali, Veera and Sivaji. His role in Kadhal Mannan, an Ajith starter, was loved by many people. Vivek acted with Vijay in Kushi and Priyamanavale. He performed with Vadivelu in few films and the notable one is Middle Class Madhavan, a Prabhu movie. Both Vadivel and Vivek performed humorously in that film. After the invasion of many comedians like Santhanam and Suri, the chances get lessened for Vivek. He performed as Eka in the Dhanush movie Uthamaputhiran, which was outstanding. Singham of Surya had Vivek as a Police constable. His recent movies are Velai Illa Pattadhaari with Dhanush and Yennai Arindhaal with Ajith. He has also acted as a solo hero in the film named Nan Than Bala. The film did not go well as expected, but he has won positive criticism from the critics.\n\n...\n\nVinay Rai is a popular South Indian actor, who is famous for his charming looks. Born and brought up in Bangalore, this charming guy entered the film industry through ‘Unnale Unnale’, a Tamil hit movie, which was directed by cinematographer, Jeeva. Before his entry to the cinema, Vinay Rai was a model and was attending ramps shows. So far in his career, Vinay has acted in a lot of Tamil films, as well as a Telugu and an English film. His Telugu movie, ‘Vaana’, did not go well and hence, he did not get a chance to shine in the Telugu industry.\n\n..."
