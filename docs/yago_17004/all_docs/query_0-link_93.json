        "text": "Earlier in Tamil cinema, the herovillain territories were a lot better defined: the embodiment of anything good, munificent, humane, romantic and gentle was the MGR and the antithesis of this man was a gruesome-looking, hatred- evoking, representative of Satan, the villain, most often, an equally smart MN Nambiar, made ugly with wigs, metal hands, with a failed rape attempt, eerie background music and so on.\n\nBut what can you say about a scenario in which our dearest chocolate boys, from Madhavan (Ayutha Ezhuthu), Prasanna (Anjaathay), Prithviraj (Kana Kandein) and most recently Jayaram (in Dhaam Dhoom and Saroja) have turned dark in movies? Recently, Kishore, the villain of Jayam Kondaan, and his love, the dusky Vasundhara, actually had an intimate bedroom scene in the movie, with a closeness that even the movie’s lead pair Bhavana and Vinay, don’t have. And in Saroja, the young and beautiful Nikita has a song with the villain Sampath, who is every inch the smartest guy of the movie. The newest phase of villainy in Tamil cinema has clearly been ushered in.\n\n“I actually wanted the villains of my movie to look better than the heroes themselves. So we chose someone who could carry off a look like that, stylish with a cigar, and smart. The idea was that only a guy like that can actually terrorise a bunch of normal guys that my heroes were. And it was hard to get that look, considering Jayaraman has the image of a humourous guy,” says Venkat Prabhu, director of Saroja.\n\nAnd in Jeyam Kondaan, the bedroom scene, according to its director, was important to set the context for the villain’s angst at losing his wife. “The movie was an attempt at reality, and its not that villains are ugly. Also, it’s important for the audience to connect with the villain as well. In his perspective, his love for his wife has to be explained. Only then can we explain his pain at losing her, and therefore, seeking revenge from the hero for killing her,” explains R Kannan, the director of Jeyam Kondaan.\n\nAttributing elements of style, smartness, good looks and intelligence to the villain, sometimes more than the hero himself, has been an idea many directors have toyed with. Think Pattina Pravesam, in which Sarath Babu was a villain people loved, and in Aalavandhan, where the villainy Kamal Haasan (Nandhoo) made for more intelligent and interesting viewing than the smart army officer hero, Vijaykumar.\n\nActors like Nassar, Raghuvaran or Prakash Raj, who have also played lead roles in other movies, have gained greater name and fame only as villains. And it also augurs well for an industry as ours where the villain can also actually show his smart, intelligent and interesting side and not stereotype ‘villainism’. After all, wasn’t it the gruesome villainy fare in Ghilli that made Prakash Raj the chellam of the industry?\n\nIt is said that one actor who was always looked upon with suspicion among the public was MN Nambiar. Legend has it that people would never invite him home because they feared that he would rape the women at home, because of the villainy image he was always identified with."
