        "text": "You know you can count on Santhanam to keep you entertained. Whether it's comedy, tragedy, or spoof, the actor will keep you at the edge of your seat only wanting for more. Apart from his unmissable screen presence, Santhanam, has made a mark in hit films including Siva Manasula Sakthi, Boss Engira Bhaskaran, Oru Kal Oru Kannadi among others. He also made his debut as a producer with Kanna Laddu Thinna Aasaiya. But a fan favourite will always be his action-comedy, Vallavanukku Pullum Aayudham.\n\nAnd today, all everyone can talk about is his upcoming film, Biskoth. The fun-filled trailer has finally found its way to the web and Santhanam's three different avatars will leave you wanting for more. The first avatar sees the actor as Baahubali with a funny spoof element, followed by the retro backdrop of Kollywood's famous Don, Billa. And the last sees the star as the employee of a biscuit company.\n\nThe film is also extra special for Sowcar Janaki as Biskoth marks his 400th film. While he will be seen in a supporting role, the film also stars Tara Alisha Berry and Swathi Muppala in the lead along with Motta Rajendran, Anand Raj, and Lollu Sabha Manohar.\n\nThe hero went on to share the trailer on Twitter and wrote, \"Here u go the Funtastic #BiskothTrailer https://youtube.com/watch?v=T6Y53rqv0vQ\n\nMaintain Social Distance & Wear ur masks(Pun intended ) Prod & Dir By @Dir_kannanR #Biskoth A @tridentartsoffl Release !\"\n\nWatch the trailer here:\n\nProduced by Trident Arts, the film is being directed by R Kannan who is popular for his other directorial venture Jayamkondaan, Kanden Kadhalai, Vanthaan Vendraan, and Settai among others.\n\nComing back to the trailer of Biskoth, what did you think of the trailer?
