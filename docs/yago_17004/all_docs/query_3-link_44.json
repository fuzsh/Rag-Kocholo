        "text": "Bhavana, the girl from the God’s Own Country, is eagerly awaiting the release of ’Jayam Kondaan’ where she has acted with Vinay. Besides this she is working in a Telugu film as well.\n\nBhavana plays a rural belle in ’Jayam Kondaan’ and the film also features Lekha Washington in the cast. Directed by Kannan, the movie is produced by Sathyajothy Films. Shooting is complete and the film will grace theaters this month end.\n\nBhavana is upbeat about her role and is mighty hopeful of making it big after ’Jayam Kondaan’...\n\nTechnorati Tags: Bhavana, Hot, Pictures, Sexy, Actress, Kollywood, Gossips\n\nEarlier, rumours about the pair’s off-screen romance spread fast as the shooting of Hero progressed in Tollywood. The news was that actor Nitin has fallen for the bubbly Malayalee actress Bhavana. Bhavana neither accepted nor declined this news and kept silent on this issue, as usual. However, some industry watchers say this could be a promotional gimmick for the movie.\n\nNitin, who has recently joined the elite club of six pack heroes, is the busiest young hero around with almost half a dozen offers on hand. Nitin was earlier linked with Genelia. Some gossip-mongers went to extreme levels and spread rumours that they were planning to marry. But the gossip died a natural death.\n\nLet us wait and see whether Nitin-Bhavana are really in love, or this is just another rumour that occasionally plagues Telugu Cinema or we have one more promotional gimmick!\n\nTechnorati Tags: Nitin, Bhavana, Hot, Pictures, Sexy, Gossips, Kollywood, Actress\n\nShe celebrated her undisclosed birthday with her relatives in her native village in Kerala.She called up selective reporters and was saying that she is very busy in all three south Indian languages.\n\nShe also adds that she will not opt for glamour in Telugu and indirectly pointing out to Nayan and Trisha who depend on vulgarity in Tollywood.\n\nTechnorati Tags: Bhavana, Hot, Pictures, Actress, Kollywood\n\n\"My career is my only priority right now. If you hear any talks about my engagement or marriage, you can rest assured that they are just gossip. Eventually, when I go get married, I intend to continue acting for a number of years even after marriage. I’m going to look for a man who would let me pursue my film career,\" she reveals.\n\nFor the first time in her career in Tamil, Bhavana recently has dubbed for herself for Jayam Kondaan, directed by debutante R. Kannan, who was earlier assistant director to Mani Rathnam. Bhavana, who had acted in a slew of Tamil films before beginning with Chithiram Pesuthadi, had not dubbed earlier in Tamil.\n\nTechnorati Tags: Kollywood, Actress, Picture, Bhavana denies her Marriage\n\nShe is expected to take on some of the select projects soon.Meanwhile, the pretty beauty says that she is always a mile away from late night parties.She is also said to have advised her friends to stay away from such functions.\n\nThe reason for her decision is that she doesn’t want to give any scope for gossip regarding her to crop up against her.\n\nTechnorati Tags: Bhavana, Hot, Actress, Kollywood, Pictures"
