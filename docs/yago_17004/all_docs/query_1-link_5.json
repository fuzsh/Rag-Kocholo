        "text": "Vinay is a successful professional in London, but he is also frustrated with his distance from home and finally takes the call to return to India and do his own business. Lekha Washington (SS music VJ) on the other hand is in India and cherishes a dream of doing a master’s degree at the MIT in USA. The clash of these ambitions is the crux of the story. But why do their ambitions collide head on? Apparently, they are related in a way that no one would be too proud of and the rather twisted nature of their relationship leads to disputes over property.\n\nWith neither party willing to give an inch or compromise on their ambitions the stage is set for a battle in and out of courts that could get far more serious. And, things do get serious, as it always does when big money is at stake. A businessman and a thug get involved in the skirmish for money and a few unsavory incidents later, things have gone far too out of hand to be settled amicably. How Vinay and Lekha take the issue that they began to a final settlement forms the climax.\n\nHaving read this, one might feel that the movie is one long battle for money between two people. While one cannot deny that,\n\nTechnically, the movie looks like one shot with finesse, the camera pleases the eye. That is the least one expects when the director is Mani Ratnam’s erstwhile assistant. The music is pretty average, barring one particular number by Hariharan and Madhushree. However, all songs have been shot on scenic locations which make them pleasant to sit through. There is a bit of action, but it is largely restrained.\n\nVinay, in his second Tamil film has done a job that is not too bad. Bhavana, in a role that doesn’t offer her much just comes and goes without impressing at all. However, debutant Lekha Washington does not show any VJing hangover and delivers a neat performance. Santhanam leads the comedy charge with a hilarious fare. Vivek, too, makes appearances on and off which evoke laughter to some extent. VMC Haneefa comes across as a gullible businessman and scores well in certain scenes."
