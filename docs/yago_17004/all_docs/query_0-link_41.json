        "text": "No remake can escape comparisons, especially if the original has had a solid run not too long ago. So when juxtaposing Jab We Met and Kandaen Kaadhalai, Shahid Kapur and Bharath and Kareena and Tamannah, you note that the makers of KK have safely and faithfully followed the original most of the time. But it is surprising that R. Kannan who made quite an impression with his debut venture, Jayamkondaan, has opted for a remake in his second project.\n\nShakti (Bharath) is a wealthy businessman whose life turns miserable after the girl he is in love with marries another. (It is rather puzzling that a successful young man is rejected without reason by the girl’s father!) He leaves home and business abruptly and takes off on a listless journey when the energetic, happy-go-lucky Anjali (Tamannah) joins him. After which life is a roller coaster ride of fun, thrill and anxiety, with a sprinkle of sentiment. Soon Anjali goes missing and his search for her and his future with her begins …\n\nThese days the heroine’s family is so unbelievably large that till the end you never know the relationship between one and the other! You saw it in Aadhavan, and you again see it here. However, the cast of KK is well chosen.\n\nProbably for the first time Bharath has gone in for a suave, sophisticated look and carries it off quite well. His subtle reactions (sometimes they fall flat because of his expressionless tone) and taciturnity are a perfect foil for the garrulous and outgoing Anjali. In the original, Kareena seemed keen on projecting herself as a nitwit and here, the beautiful Tamannah apes her senior to a T. Tamannah is appealing in both the serious and light scenes, though in the song sequences her joie de vivre is a tad too contrived. You saw Genelia in a similar bubbly but immature act in Santhosh Subramaniam. In the name of innocence the trend of making the heroine seem just a shade better than an imbecile could soon become a cliché! The dance sequence in the second half proves a speed-breaker in the narration. But it helps the hero prove yet again that he’s an ace dancer. As Tamannah’s erstwhile lover, Munna does a neat job.\n\nBe it ‘Nizhalgal’ Ravi, Azhagam Perumal or Ravichandran, all the actors do justice. Kannan digresses slightly from Imtiaz Ali’s original line and adds a humorous segment with Santhanam, which melds well with the main story. Hilarious most of the time, Santhanam is a value-addition to KK. His comic interludes with Manobala evoke a smile. The dialogue and his delivery of the lines are rib-tickling.\n\nIf Anjali is so keen on getting her sister married to Shakti, why doesn’t she reveal any concern when the sis mistakes Shakti and her to be lovers? The character lacks consistency at times.\n\nVidyasagar returns with some melodic refrains. The tune, strong percussion forays, choreography and backdrop of the ‘Sutudhu Sutudhu …’ song are a treat from the technical team. P.G. Muthiah’s camera accentuates the effect. Art (Rembon), especially in the song sequences and the dingy hotel room, deserves notice though the old family home sports a predictable look. Pattukottai Prabhakar’s dialogue is witty and natural.\n\nForget the original and Tamannah’s over-acting in certain scenes. Just enjoy her radiance, and Bharath’s generally apt underplay.\n\nGenre: Romance\n\nDirector: R. Kannan\n\nStoryline: The childish and irresponsible nature of the heroine leads her to problems, but what else is a hero for if not to protect her?"
