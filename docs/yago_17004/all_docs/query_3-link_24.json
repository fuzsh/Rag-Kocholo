Chandrika hands over the house documents to Arjun and he leaves to Madurai to sell the house immediately.\n\nAt Madurai, he meets Durai Raj (Nizhalgal Ravi), a chilli vendor and his daughter Annapurani (Bhavana), who are the tenants. Durai Raj is a friend of Arjun’s father. Arjun explains his situation and requests them to vacate the home so that he can sell. To convince Annapoorani, Arjun cooks up a story that both Annapoorani and Arjun are childhood friends. To his surprise, Brinda also comes to Madurai to prevent Arjun from selling the property.

The script and direction is described as \"successful due to straightforward narration and packaging\". Lekha Washington's performance was praised, citing that she \"sparkles as the half sister in a well etched role\" and is \"the surprise packet and has the credentials to make it big\". Vinay Rai \"looks too thin and fragile\" but \"adds to the film’s energy\", while Bhavana has nothing much to do other than \"looking prim and proper\". Out of the comedians, Sify reports that Krishna and Santhanam were more effective than Vivek who at times you feel speaks more dialogues than necessary. Praise is also heaped on Athisaya as the small town girl who gets enamored by the rowdy, describing her as a \"revelation\", while Kishore \"fits the bill as the bad guy\".\n\nIn unison, Rediff.com also praise the film as a \"nice blend of the cinematic and logic\". The reviewer describes Vinay Rai, \"as the protagonist is very comfortable in his role\" and thathe has \"expressive eyes, emotes well, and makes sure his audience isn't disappointed. However Lekha Washington is clearly the surprise package\", echoing Sify.com's views. However it claims that Bhavana, with her \"soulful eyes and acting talent, could have done with a meatier role\". \"The film has risen above the clichés as per the review of The Hindu and the reviewer has praised Vinay for choosing this film as his second project\".\n\nCritics claimed that Kannan deserves credit for a \"good job\" on his story and screenplay. Vidayasagar’s music was described as is \"so-so\", there is a feeling that you have heard these tunes before with the \"picturisation is nowhere near the high standards set up by the director’s guru (Mani Ratnam). Rediff claims that Balasubramaniam's camera makes sure the \"viewers aren't treated to bizarre angles\" and that V. T. Vijayan's editing is \"slick and smooth\".\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe film has six songs composed by Vidyasagar with the lyrics primarily penned by Vaali and Pa. Vijay. The audio of the film released worldwide on 3 June 2008, two months prior to the release. The soundtrack was successfully received with praise."
