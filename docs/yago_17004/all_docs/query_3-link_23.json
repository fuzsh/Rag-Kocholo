        "text": "Actor Santhanam has a string of films in the pipeline that are in different stages of production—debutant Karthik Yogi’s Dikkiloona ready for release, A1 fame director K Johnson‘s untitled halted at the first leg of shoot, and R Kannan‘s Biskoth also gearing up for a release.\n\nWhile colourful posters of Dikkiloona were unveiled recently, details regarding Santhanam’s characters in Biskoth have been revealed now by director Kannan. The film, which is being bankrolled by his Masala Pix banner in association with MK Ramprasad’s MKRP Productions, will be the first time Santhanam is working as the director’s leading man, after their associations in films like Jayam Kondaan (2008) and Kandaen Kaathalai (2009).\n\nDirector Kannan has revealed that Santhanam plays a king named Rajasimha in the film and that the respective portions of the character have been shot at sets constructed in Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad. “This portion and character will feature for about 30 minutes in the film. Drawing references from ancient times, art director Rajkumar managed to pull off wonderful sets and the required props, perfectly recreating the palaces from the 18th century. Costume designer Priya had a tough time working on the outfit of not just Santhanam sir but also for the rest of the 500 background artists who feature in that 30-minute sequence. The visuals of Shanmuga Sundharam (96 fame) have come out really well and seem like they are straight out of a painting,” says Kannan.\n\nSpeaking of Biskoth and its lead actor Santhanam, Kannan says, “A biscuit factory plays a very important role in the film, and hence we gave it the title Biskoth. The film will see Santhanam playing three roles, one from the 18th century, one from the 80s, and one from the current times. The connection between the three roles will be understood once the film releases.”\n\n“Post-lockdown and all the chaos around the pandemic, people would definitely need something to refresh their minds and pump their energy. In that way, Biskoth is going to be the perfect film not just for Santhanam fans but for all audiences who require unwinding. We’ve tried to showcase the different shades of Santhanam in the film, unlike the usual ones we’ve seen in his films until now and Santhanam has been extremely cooperative in this sense. For the Kalaripayattu (Kalari) sequences in the film, he first underwent training with stunt master Hari Dinesh and then only got onto the set. I’m confident that Biskoth is going to be a trademark film for Santhanam just like how Imsai Arasan 23am Pulikesi was for comedian Vadivelu. It will definitely be appreciated by all.”\n\nSowcar Janaki, who was last seen in the Karthi starrer Thambi, will be essaying the actor’s grandmother in the film which marks her 400th film. “I have enjoyed her work since Thillu Mullu (1981) and wanted her to be a part of my film. As always, she has done a wonderful job,” says Kannan.\n\nTara Alisha Berry who was paired opposite Santhanam in A1 will be seen with the actor in this film too. Debutant Swathi Muppala will play the second female lead. Apart from them, Anand Raj, Motta Rajendran, Sivashankar, and ‘Lollu Sabha’ Manohar have also landed important roles.\n\nArjun Reddy/Adithya Varma fame Radhan is composing music, Selva RK is editing and Sandy and Sathish are choreographing dance. Kiruthiya and Radhan have penned the lyrics.\n\nThe first look poster of the film was unveiled a few months back. With the final cut ready, the trailer will drop soon and will see a release in theatres post-lockdown. Trident Arts‘ R Ravindran will be releasing Biskoth.\n\nRead: The ‘Biskoth’ First Look Poster Featuring Santhanam Screams 80s : Out Now\n\nWhile Santhanam’s previous film Dagaalty helmed by Vijay Anand did not do well in the box office, his long-pending release Server Sundaram helmed by Anand Balki is still awaiting a theatrical release. Rumours have also surfaced that the film might opt for a direct OTT release if the deal comes through.\n\nWatch the teaser of Dagaalty here:"
