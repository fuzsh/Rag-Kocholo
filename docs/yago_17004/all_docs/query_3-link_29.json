        "text": "Udayanidhi Stalin has succeeded in pretty much every professional role he has chosen over the past few years – producer, distributor and now actor. The star with a pedigree worth boasting about seems very keen on making his own mark in Kollywood.\n\nHe is now starring in Nanbenda, and it was while on location here that director R Kannan approached him with a story for his upcoming film. Apparently he was so impressed that he agreed to get on board with the project almost immediately, at least that’s what the sources say.\n\nR Kannan is of course known for his movie Kaadhalai Kandein and Jayam Kondaan, and is currently directing the movie Oru Oorla Rendu Raaja which has Vemal and Soori in the lead roles.\n\nThis one has been at the centre of constant media attention for days now, though for different reasons. It was in this flick that glamour sensation Sunny Leone agreed to do an item song and then backed out. That role has since been picked up by Neethu Chandra.\n\nThe movie also has an interesting set of vocals for one of its songs – none other than the fastest rising female star of Tamil cinema, Lakshmi Menon! This is the first time Lakshmi will be trying her skills at playback singing.\n\nNanbenda, in which Stalin is playing the lead opposite Nayanthara, is also being produced by him and is reported to be a sensational rom com. Comedic actor Santhaanam, who recently turned hero, is also playing an important role in this one, and it features a cameo appearance by Tamanna.\n\nNanbenda is being directed by Jagadish who was an assistant to director M Rajesh of Boss Engira Bhaskaran fame.\n\nSo, two intriguing movies coming up soon and one in the works.."
