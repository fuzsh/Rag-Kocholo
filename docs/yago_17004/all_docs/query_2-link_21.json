        "text": "Storyline\n\nJayam Kondaan (English: The Victor) is a 2008 Tamil action-romance film, directed and co-written by Kannan and produced by T. G. Thiyagarajan, Selvi Thiyagarajan and T. Arjun. It stars Vinay Rai, Bhavana Balachandran and Lekha Washington in the lead roles. Vivek and Kishore also appear.\n\nThe film revolves around an NRI Civil Engineer , who returns to Chennai from London to set up his own business. He feels that if one has to reach his goal in life it is better to win over your enemies and take them along with you. He finds out that his late father had another family, and that his step sister wants to steal his home. After clashes with his sister, he discovers another tragedy involving someone who wants to make a vendetta with the family. The film follows the sibling relationship and the threat from the avenger.\n\nThe film opened to worldwide audiences after several delays on 29 August 2008 to generally positive reviews.\n\nArjun (Vinay Rai) resigns his job in London and returns to India following his father’s sudden death. He decides to set up a real estate business in Chennai from the funds he has saved so far. He goes to the bank to withdraw the money but is shocked to see that only Rs.18,000 cash to be available in his account.\n\nHe estimated the amount to be Rs.65 lakhs. Arjun doubts that his father must have invested the money somewhere in India. He inquires with his father’s friends to get to know about the money. At last Arjun finds that father has purchased a house in Madurai with the money but also is shocked to know that his father had one more wife Chandrika (Malavika Avinash) and a daughter named Brinda (Lekha Washington) through her.\n\nBrinda gets admission to study in MIT in the US but her education loan is rejected. So she decides to sell the house in Madurai and get the money needed for her education. Arjun comes to meet his step mother and his step sister asking her not to sell the property as it was purchased through his money. Chandrika understands that her daughter’s activities are not right and the house should actually belong to Arjun. But Brinda is short tempered and does not listen to her mother. Chandrika hands over the house documents to Arjun and he leaves to Madurai to sell the house immediately.\n\nAt Madurai, he meets Durai Raj (Nizhalgal Ravi) and his daughter Annapurani (Bhavana) who are the tenants.\n\nDurai Raj is a friend of Arjun’s father. Arjun explains his situation and requests them to vacate the home so that he can sell. To convince Annapoorani, Arjun cooks up a story that both Annapoorani and Arjun are childhood friends. To his surprise, Brinda also comes to Madurai to prevent Arjun from selling the property. She approaches Guna (Kishore), a local goon to help her from stopping Arjun.\n\nGuna comes along with his wife Poonkodai (Vasundhara Kashyap) to the registrar office to stop the deal. Quarrel erupts between Arjun and Guna and when Guna tries to hit Arjun with a hammer, it accidentally hits Poongodhai and she dies on the spot. This angers Guna and he wants to take revenge on Arjun by killing him, thinking that he was responsible for his wife’s death.\n\nArjun escapes to Chennai along with his sister Brinda. But Brinda’s mother Chandrika passes away suddenly and Brinda has no one to care for now. Arjun takes Brinda to his home and asks her to stay with him. She agrees but still she hates Arjun. Slowly Arjun develops affection towards Brinda and decides to give the money to her for education.\n\nAnnapurani comes to Chennai for a volleyball match and love blossoms between her and Arjun. To Arjun’s surprise, Arjun and Annapurani were really childhood friends and were so close during childhood days. Arjun decides to leave to London and join his previous job as Guna keeps searching Arjun for revenge. On the day of Arjun’s flight to London, Guna kidnaps Brinda. Arjun comes back from airport to rescue Brinda and in the fight Guna gets killed. Finally Brinda realizes her mistake and gets close with her brother Arjun."
