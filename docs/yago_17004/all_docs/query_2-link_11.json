        "text": "Jayam Kondaan is a 2008 Tamil romantic-comedy film directed by Kannan and produced by T. G. Thiyagarajan of Sathyam Cinemas. The film stars Vinay Rai, Bhavana, and Lekha Washington in lead roles, with Vivek, Santhanam, and Kishore also appearing in supporting roles. The movie was a commercial success at the box office. Jayam Kondaan tells the story of Arjun (Vinay Rai), a civil engineer, who comes to Chennai from Coimbatore to complete his studies. Arjun meets Anu (Lekha Washington), a college student, and they fall in love. However, when Arjun's father (Nizhalgal Ravi) learns about their relationship, he opposes it as Anu is from a different community.\n\nMeanwhile, Arjun meets Jo (Bhavana), a television journalist, when he saves her from a group of gangsters. Jo helps Arjun find a job, and they become friends. Arjun is unaware that Jo has feelings for him. Jo's father (Mayilsamy) asks Arjun to marry Jo as she is in love with him, but Arjun tells him that he loves someone else. Jo is heartbroken and decides to leave Chennai.\n\nArjun's father fixes his marriage with Meera (Kavitha), a girl from his community. Arjun agrees to the marriage as he believes that he can forget Anu with time. However, when he meets Anu again, he realizes that his feelings for her have not changed. Arjun is torn between his love for Anu and his commitment to Meera.\n\nThe rest of the movie follows Arjun's attempts to win over Anu and convince his father to accept their relationship. He also tries to stop Jo from leaving Chennai and apologizes to her for hurting her. Along the way, Arjun faces numerous obstacles, including a gangster who wants to kill him and a corrupt politician who wants to destroy his career.\n\nJayam Kondaan is a romantic-comedy that balances humor with drama. The chemistry between the lead actors, Vinay Rai, Bhavana, and Lekha Washington, is excellent. Vinay Rai delivers a decent performance as Arjun while Bhavana and Lekha Washington are impressive as Jo and Anu respectively.\n\nThe movie's music, composed by Vidyasagar, is also noteworthy. The songs, especially \"Jayam Kondaan\" and \"Unnai Naan\", were popular among audiences. The film's cinematography, by K. V. Guhan, is top-notch. The visuals capture Chennai's beauty, and the action scenes are well choreographed.\n\nIn conclusion, Jayam Kondaan is an entertaining movie that will leave you with a smile on your face. The film's romantic-comedy genre, coupled with excellent performances by the lead actors, makes it a must-watch for fans of the genre. The movie's music and cinematography add to its appeal. Jayam Kondaan is an enjoyable watch that you won't regret."
