Moving away from the stereotypical love stories, the movie presents an honest account of perspectives of two different people.\n\nTrade Talk:\n\nAverage collections have made the movie a safe bet.\n\nPublic Talk:\n\nFinally Bhavana's career can hopefully look good after this.\n\nNo. Weeks Completed: 11\n\nNo. Shows in Chennai over this weekend: 21\n\nAverage Theatre Occupancy over this weekend: 35 %\n\nCollection over this weekend in Chennai: Rs. 72,576\n\nTotal collections in Chennai by end of the twelfth weekend: Rs. 1.02 Crore\n\nVerdict: Average"
