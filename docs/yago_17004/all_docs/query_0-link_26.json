        "text": "Director R Kannan of Jayam Kondaan fame is teaming up with Yogi Babu for his 12th film which is titled Periyandavar. The film, which is said to be a time-travel comedy, stars Yogi Babu as Lord Shiva.\n\nAccording to reports, a Shiva temple will be constructed at the cost of Rs 50 lakh on East Coast Road. The female lead and the rest of the cast are yet to be confirmed for this project that will go on floors soon. Said to be a dialogue focused film, along with Kannan, Kabilan Vairamuthu will also be in charge of lyrics and dialogues. Produced by Masala Pix, a Mumbai based CG company has been approached for Periyandavar's VFX.\n\nMeanwhile, Kannan is awaiting the release of The Great Indian Kitchen, starring Aishwarya Rajesh followed by the Shiva-starrer Kasethan Kadavulada. Yogi Babu, on the other hand, has films like Panni Kutty, Ayalaan, Naane Varuven and Thalapathy 66."
