        "text": "With this reading, we move from Kantâs Critique of the Power of Judgment (the pallbearer of aesthetic theory, the text written in 1790) into Walter Benjaminâs âThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproductionâ (a key figure in Critical Theory, the text, widely known as a basis for film criticism studies, was written in 1936).Â\n\nContents:\n\n1) On Walter Benjamin\n\n2) Critical Theory\n\n3) Textual Analysis\n\n4) Discussion Prompts\n\nClick Here for a link to the Walter Benjamin Research Syndicate.\n\nClick Here for two e-texts by Benjamin.\n\n2)Â Critical Theory:\n\nWalter Benjamin is one of the key figures in Critical Theory.Â Critical Theory is, most properly, the name of thought produced by the Frankfurt School, which was a 20th c. tradition predominately composed of German philosophers and social theorists whose intellectual areas of study were diverse (including the natural and social sciences), yet shared a basis of Marxist philosophy (most were dissident Marxists who envisioned its improvement) and strong influence by the philosophy of Kant, Hegel, Freud, Weber, and LukÃ¡cs.Â They were intitially based in the Institute for Social Research (founded in 1923) at the University of Frankfurt; For them, âCriticalâ Theory had a practical command that traditional theory had neglected: to better the conditions of humans by freeing them from what oppresses and enslaves them.Â (Although, the term âcritical theoryâ is also used today to designate a method of doing philosophyâtypically in applied fields, like gender studies, race studies, etc.âthat is inspired by the Frankfurt School.)Â\n\nâUnlike most contemporary theories of society, whose primary aim is to provide the best description and explanation of social phenomenon, critical theories are chiefly concerned with evaluating the freedom, justice, and happiness of societies. In their concern with values they show themselves more akin to moral philosophy than to predictive scienceâ (David Ingram, âIntroduction,â in Critical Theory: The Essential Readings (New York: Paragon House, 1992), xx).\n\nThus, the aims of Critical Theory are to explain the current social reality along with the circumstances of oppression, to be practical, that is, to provide a theory by which to change the current reality, and to be normative, that is, to provide the norms by which it can be criticized and can provide goals for social change.Â Key figures of or associated very closely to the Frankfurt School include Max Horkheimer, Theodor W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse, Erich Fromm, and, later, JÃ¼rgen Habermas.\n\n3)Â Textual Analysis:\n\nWalter Benjaminâs\n\nâThe Work of Art in the Age of its Technical Reproducibilityâ\n\n[aka., âThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproductionâ]\n\nCollected in: Art and its Significance, ed. Ross, pp. 526-38\n\nII)\n\nâEven the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to beâ (526).Â\n\nUnique existenceâthe art work itself as a real object in a time and placeâdetermined the history to which it was subject, including changes in its physical condition (e.g., its exposure to light, soot, damage, etc.) and the changes in its ownership (e.g., bought and sold, stolen, inherited, given, etc.).Â It is important to note that Critical Theory, and especially Benjaminâs Marxist influence, places a high value of importance on the full context and material history of a work of artâits social and political context when created and of s/he who created it, the history of its reception, how it became viewed and used over time and place.Â (Keep in mind how this differs from Kant, for whom we had to approach the work of art disinterestedly, that is, without any of this âbaggageâ of knowledge and consideration.)Â So, the changes a work went through are critically important, for Benjamin, to consider.Â To determine physical changes, a work itself must be examined (i.e., we cannot tell much, and sometimes nothing, about the condition of an original by looking at a print).Â To determine changes in ownership, we must trace the situation of the original (i.e., we cannot tell its path from looking at a picture of it).Â These facts reveal to us that: âThe presence of the original is prerequisite to the concept of authenticity,â and, thus, âThe whole sphere of authenticity is outside of technical â¦ reproducibilityâ (526).\n\nManual reproduction (e.g., a painter produces a new painting by copying an original) was originally considered forgery.Â In this case, the existence of a forgery does not diminish the authenticity of the original.Â Technical reproduction is different.Â [Keep in mind that the anthology has decided to translate Benjaminâs term as âtechnical,â but it is probably more properly translated as âmechanical.â]\n\nBefore considering Benjaminâs examples, consider first technical reproduction in the form of a copyright owner of a work who hires/permits a company to make prints of the originalâhere, the authenticity of an original is and is not compromised: on the one hand, the original is not diminished because it retains its authenticity; on the other hand, the greatest sense of authenticity is harmed due to the possibility of sheer quantity.Â For example, seeing Monetâs âWater Liliesâ in person is profoundly strikingâbut, after one has seen this image reproduced on dishtowels, calendars, posters, billboards, note pads, tee shirts, etc., the originalâs impact is sharply diminished.Â However, Benjaminâs definition and examples of âtechnical reproductionâ are different than thisâhere, consider photography and film as the key examples, although recorded music, television, e-books, etc. are also applicable.Â\n\nBenjamin gives two reasons for the difference between Manual and Technical Reproduction:\n\n1) technical/process reproduction âis more independent of the original than manual reproductionâ (527); and\n\n2) technical/process reproduction can âput the copy of the original into situations which would be out of reach for the original itselfâ (527).Â\n\nFor examples of the first, if we consider photography or film, we can enlarge, crop, rotate, speed up or slow down, etc. the original and thereby reveal more or different aspects.Â\n\nFor examples of the second, as Benjamin says, âit enables the original to meet the beholder halfway,â so that the cathedral in Rome can come before the eyes of a person in Nashville, or the sound recording of a concert in Paris can be played in a classroom in Tokyo.Â\n\nFrom these aspects, Benjamin determines that âThe situations into which the product of mechanical reproduction can be brought may not touch the actual work of art, yet the quality of its presence is always depreciatedâ (527).Â A workâs authenticity is its full, transmittable essence; this is compromised by reproduction.Â\n\nWhat is eliminated in reproduction is the âauraâ of a workââthat which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of artâ (527).Â And, this has a dramatic impact well beyond the realm of art.Â Reproducibility divorces the thing from its tradition; it makes the one into the many (copies).Â By permitting the copies to move beyond its original time and place, it also âreactivates the object producedâ (527).Â âThese two processes lead to a tremendous shattering of tradition which is the obverse of the contemporary crisis and renewal of mankindâ (527).Â This Benjamin ties to mass movements and exemplifies through film.Â âIts [Filmâs] social significance, particularly in its most positive form, is inconceivable without its destructive, cathartic aspect, that is, the liquidation of the traditional value of cultural heritageâ (527).Â\n\nIII)\n\nâDuring long periods of history, the mode of human sense perception changes with humanityâs entire mode of existenceâ (528).Â\n\nIt is not only nature that determines how we sensibly perceive thingsâin addition, historical circumstances, too, importantly determine sensible perception.Â Changes in historical circumstance change how we perceiveâthey give birth to new kinds of perception.Â Social transformation follows from changed perceptive capacities and modes (âAnd if changes in the medium of contemporary perception can be comprehended as decay of the aura, it is possible to show its social causesâ (528).)\n\nIn Â§II, Benjamin introduced âauraâ in relation to historical objectsâthis was the full aura of a work tied to its authenticity, its unique existence that could show physical condition and historical ownership and situation.Â Now, Benjamin is going to introduce the aura of natural objects, defined as âthe unique phenomenon of a distance â¦â (528).Â\n\nDistance: consider this idea carefullyâthink about our reliance on depth perception to simply maneuver through the world; think about how our perception of near and far is so formative to our determination of reality.Â Think, too, about distance as a key feature of our aesthetic perception.Â Consider, now, Benjaminâs example: âIf, while resting on a summer afternoon you follow with your eyes a mountain range on a horizon or a branch which casts its shadow over you, you experience the aura of those mountains, of that branchâ (528).Â Key to your perceptual intake and resultant feeling, mood, judgment, etc., is the distance (which can be far or near) of the mountain and branch.Â\n\nNow, if we accept his proposition that there is a contemporary decay of aura, then we can also accept his premise that we can study these changes to show their social causes.Â The social basis relates to the increasing significance of the masses in contemporary life.Â (Masses carrying the political import connected to the rise of the large socio-economic classes of workers, those who produceâalthough today we may call this class the âconsumersââas opposed to the ruling elite.)\n\nThere are two social circumstances that become apparent: âthe desire of contemporary masses to bring themselves âcloserâ spatially and humanly, which is just as ardent as their bent toward overcoming the uniqueness of every reality by accepting its reproductionâ (528).Â In other words, our obsession with the âclose-up.âÂ âEvery day the urge grows stronger to get hold of an object at very close range by way of its likeness, its reproductionâ (528)âfor example, we see the use of images in magazines and newsreels.Â\n\nThe original, that which is seen with the âunarmed eye,â is linked to âuniqueness and permanence;â the reproduction is linked to âtransitoriness and reproducibilityâ (528).Â\n\nâTo pry an object from its shell, to destroy its aura, is the mark of a perception whose âsense of the universal equality of thingsâ has increased to such a degree that it extracts it even from a unique object by means of reproductionâ (528).Â This increase in the field of perception parallels the increase of the importance of statistics in theoretical fields.Â\n\nIV)\n\nâThe uniqueness of a work of art is inseparable from its being imbedded in the fabric of tradition.Â This tradition itself is thoroughly alive and extremely changeableâ (529).Â In other words, the aura of a work of art cannot be grasped without its historical context, its tradition.Â\n\nBenjaminâs example: for the ancient Greeks, a statue of Venus was an object for veneration; for the Medieval Church, it became an âominous idol.âÂ Pay attention, thought, to his following line: âBoth of them, however, were equally confronted with its uniqueness, that is, its auraâ (529).Â The aura of the work is entangled with the historical context, but not limited to it; it is also something of the work itself.\n\nHow art historically became entangled with tradition is through ritualâfirst magical ritual and then religious.Â The aura of art does not lose this connection to ritual, even today in what Benjamin names as the âsecularized ritualâ of the âcult of beautyâ (529), which rose during the Renaissance in a first phase of religious crisis, and can be paralleled to the crisis fomenting in the rise of reproduction (esp. photography) and Socialism.Â In response to crisis, âart gave rise to what might be called a negative theology in the form of the idea of âpureâ art, which not only denied any social function of art but also any categorizing by subject matterâ (529).Â [Negative theology (Apopthatic theology) is an early medieval term for an approach to theology that refuses affirmative knowledge, instead only accepting the âknownâ to be what is not known; for example, affirmative theology will say God is Great, negative theology will say âGod is not Greatâ because âgreatâ is only known to us in a human way, and God surpasses what we can know.Â Hence, here, he is using the term as a type of thinking that works forward through negation.]Â This âpureâ art is embodied in the expression lâart pour lâart, what we translate as âart for artâs sake;â thus, apopthatically, art is what is not for use, for ritual, for consumption, etc.Â Â Â\n\nâAn analysis of art in the age of mechanical reproduction must do justice to these relationships, for they lead us to an all-important insight: for the first time in world history, mechanical reproduction emancipates the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritualâ (529).\n\nFor the first time, âthe work of art reproduced becomes the work of art designed for reproducibilityâ (529).Â (To think this in a Kantian sense, the art gains purpose: its purpose is to be reproduced.)\n\nBenjamin notes this in relation to photographyâthink about this â¦ what is the original in photography?Â The negative?Â But, that is not the work per se, the work is the photograph, but that is something reproduced.Â Which is the âauthenticâ print of photography?Â\n\nâBut the instant the criterion of authenticity ceases to be applicable to artistic production, the total function of art is reversed.Â Instead of being based on ritual, it begins to be based on another practiceâpoliticsâ (529).Â\n\nV)\n\nThere are different planes of receipt and value for a work of art.Â The two Benjamin considers are polar opposites: the cult value of a work and the exhibition value of the work (529).\n\nThe cult value of a work (of ceremonial objects) was connected to their existence, not their being on view; in fact, their value here almost demanded that they remain hidden (remain sacred, thus out of sight).Â To emancipate art from its ritual basis, we emancipate art from being hidden, we increase its possibility for exhibition.Â\n\nTechnical reproduction now has innumerable and increasingly better methods for making art accessible to the masses.Â (Photography and film being the best examples.)\n\nVI)\n\nâIn photography, exhibition value begins to displace cult value all along the line.Â But cult value does not give way without resistanceâ (530).\n\nThe resurgence of cult value can especially be seen in the âcult of remembrance,â the âcult value of the picture:â the portrait.Â Here, a photograph of family, of loved ones, flourishes; the portrait photograph is made for someone, not everyone; it is a remembrance of a person for a person; it becomes, again, like the ritual artifact, something to remain private.Â Early photography was predominately composed of portrait photography.Â But, as the face fades from pictures, we see the assertion of the exhibition value plane in photography.Â\n\nBenjamin cites EugÃ¨ne Atgetâs (1857-1927) photographs of deserted Parisian streets, in the early 1900âs, as an example of this ceding of the ritual for the exhibition value.Â âWith Atget, photographs became standard evidence for historical occurrences, and acquire a hidden political significance.Â They demand a specific kind of approach; free-floating contemplation is not appropriate to them.Â They stir the viewer; he feels challenged by them in a new wayâ (530).Â Magazines further this movement by amending every photograph with a captionâthose things that serve a role wholly different than titles on paintings.Â Expand this imposition of meaning onto the image, the direction for the viewer, and we find ourselves in the realm of film, âwhere the meaning of each single picture appears prescribed by the sequence of all preceding ones â¦â (531).\n\nClick here for more on EugÃ¨ne Arget,Â Â or,Â Â here to view his photography.\n\nIX)\n\nIn Film, the actor becomes the artistânow, unlike the photographer who photographs another for the public, the actor represents him/herself to the public before the camera.Â\n\nBenjaminâs example here is Luigi Pirandello, who wrote on this dimension in his novel Si Gira, from his experience with silent films.Â âWhat matters is that the part is acted not for an audience, but for a mechanical contrivance â¦â Benjamin notes, and then quotes Pirandello: âthe film actor â¦ feels as if in exileâexiled not only from the stage but also from himself.Â With a vague sense of discomfort he feels inexplicable emptiness: his body loses its corporeality, it evaporates, it is deprived of reality, life, voice, and the noises caused by his moving about, in order to be changed into a mute image, flickering an instant on the screen, then in vanishing into silence. â¦ The projector will play with his shadow before the public, and he himself must be content to play before the cameraâ (531).Â As Benjamin summarizes this: âman has to operate with his whole living person, yet foregoing its aura.Â For aura is tied to his presence; there can be no replica of itâ (531).Â\n\nClick here for more on Luigi Pirandello,Â or,Â Here for a speech given about him for his Nobel Prize.\n\nFor a fun play with this theme, see the Woody Allen film âThe Purple Rose of Cairoâ (1985), wherein an actor walks out of the screen to start a romance with a woman in the audience.\n\nThus, in film, the actor becomes the artist and the camera replaces the public; with the latter replacement, the aura of the actor (his or her actual reality, history, full spirit) vanishes.Â\n\nBenjamin notes how, in contrast to the stage actor, the film actor is denied the opportunity to âbecomeâ the character s/he is playing.Â This is not saying that we donât have what we now call âmethod actingâ in film, but that on the stage, in time and before an actual audience, the stage actor truly becomes the character by force of his/her own aura being identified into the character.Â In film, we lose the closeness that comes from space and time, from the components that radiate aura.Â And, in the actorâs actual acting in the film, it is shot in bits and pieces, likely out of order, takes are done and redone, the film sequences are then spliced, composed.\n\nFor an interesting response to this aspect, in week four, we will read Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterbergâs âDogma 95 Manifestoâ [available here] , which attempts to re-inject realism in the sense of lived time and space into film creation.Â\n\nâNothing more strikingly shows that art has left the realm of the âbeautiful semblanceâ which, so far, had been taken to be the only sphere where art could thriveâ (532).\n\nX)\n\nBenjamin now parallels the estrangement described by Pirandello to the sort of estrangement that anyone can feel before oneâs own mirror image, âBut now the reflected image has become separable, transportableâ (532).Â It is transported to the public, to diverse and many publics.Â The actor acts knowing full well that s/he acts before a camera that will then be given for the crowds; s/he is divorced from the immediacy of these consumers, bereft of their contact.Â âThis may contribute to that oppression, that new anxiety which â¦ grips the actor before the cameraâ (532).Â\n\nThe film industry, to fight the âshriveling of the aura,â builds up an artificial show of the âpersonality.âÂ Even note the language, we call our stars âpersonalities,â but that is a part of a human aura, something felt and experienced in time and space, in an intimacy; now, it has become simply a product given us, rather than an experience we engage in the very event of encounter.Â âThe cult of the movie star, fostered by the money of the film industry, preserves not the unique aura of the person but the âspell of the personality,â the phony spell of a commodityâ (532).Â\n\nâSo long as the movie-makersâ capital sets the fashion, as a rule no other revolutionary merit can be accredited to todayâs film than the promotion of a revolutionary criticism of traditional concepts of artâ (532).Â Benjamin is not denying that there arenât radical films that promote revolutionary critiques of social conditions, etc., but film itself is not and cannot do this.Â\n\nBut, the power of influence is mighty from film.Â The film audience, by being witnesses to the accomplishments of the film and by what is inherent to the technique of film, become somewhat of experts.Â (Watch a nature documentary on lions, you now become an expert on lions; watch a show about gangsters, you have now become a witness to the event of gangsters, you have knowledge of them gained by your witnessing; it is the film that permits you the view, it envelopes you into its activity and makes you what you become: a witness who is in the know.)\n\nBenjamin notes how newsreels can make every passersby into a âmovie extra;â any person at all now may suddenly become part of a work of art.Â (Keep in mind, this was written in 1936âa bit prescient, no?Â He mentions the Russian propaganda films wherein the âactorsâ were common people playing themselves on film â¦ this should hearken some idea of our current âreality televisionâ programs.)Â Benjamin compares this incorporation of the audience into the art to the historical situation of contemporary literature, especially since the rise of printing presses, which exploded growth in publishing, requiring more writers, and then with the advent of âletters to the editors,â wherein the common man or woman could also become published: âThus, the distinction between author and public is about to lose its basic character.Â In film, this process just happened so much more rapidly than the centuries of literatureâs change.Â\n\nXI)\n\nSection eleven broaches the idea of the spectacle of film (a frequently talked about aspect of film theory in contemporary French philosophy)âfilm, more than most any other medium, wildly plays with and provokes questions about the role of the eye/I (the sensory viewing and the subject who views), and thus about the nature of what the eye/I as spectator sees: the spectacle.Â\n\nThe spectator of film must see as if through the lens of the camera â¦ one cannot stand in an aisle, sit in a balcony, etc., for then the audience sees âthe filmâ and âthe filmingâ (the equipment).Â Thus, the view by which a room full of spectators watch a film is all through the singular perspective of that of the camera(s).Â This is obviously unlike a theatre-goer who can see the stage set, its edges, the props being changed, etc., which reminds him/her constantly of the illusion of theatre.Â Film doesnât have this sort of space for the remembrance of illusion, except in the second degree of the process of film cutting (e.g., one moment that characters are on the street in Paris, the next they are in a cafÃ©, but the movement reality requires for the transition is cut from view).Â Film, then, as Benjamin puts it âhas penetrated so deeply into reality that its pure aspect freed from the foreign substance of equipment is the result of a special procedure, namely, the shooting by the specially adjusted camera and the mounting of the shot together with similar onesâ (534).Â This is the âheight of artifice,â âthe sight of immediate reality has become an orchid in the land of technologyâ (534).Â\n\nTo heighten the contrast even more than with theatre, Benjamin compares film with painting: âHow does the cameraman compare with the painter?â (534).Â He answers by analogy to surgery.Â\n\nThe surgeon is the opposite of the magician.\n\nThe surgeon: heals by cutting the body; eliminates distance from the patient by cutting into the body, and only slightly increases distance by the caution of cutting; faces the patient through the operation; the surgeon retains a trace of being the magician.\n\nThe magician: heals by laying hands on the body; maintains a natural distance from the patient, when decreased by touching, s/he increases distance by virtue of authority; faces the patient âman to man.â\n\nThe cameraman and the painter parallel the opposition of the surgeon/magician.\n\nThe cameraman: penetrates reality; acquires partial pictures which are assembled into one under a new law (the directorâs âvisionâ).\n\nThe painter: maintains distance from reality; acquires a total picture.\n\nâThus, for contemporary man the representation of reality by film is incomparably more significant than that of the painter, since it offers, precisely because of the thoroughgoing permeation of reality with mechanical equipment, an aspect of reality which is free of all equipment.Â And that is what one is entitled to ask from a work of artâ (534).\n\nIn other words, film uses artifice (restricting the view of the spectator to the spectacle that has been created carefully for the public through mechanical reproduction) to produce a picture of reality free of all artifice.Â\n\nXII)\n\nâMechanical reproduction of art changes the reaction of the masses toward artâ (534).Â The changed reaction is a movement from a reactionary attitude to a progressive attitude.\n\nReactionary attitude: e.g., viewing a Picasso painting.Â (Our selection doesnât fill this out more, but we can characterize this by opposition to the progressive attitude; instead of the communion of the audienceâs enjoyment to the artistâs creation, there will be a disjuncture: the artist gives forth a view which is reacted against by the viewer.Â While it sounds aggressive and maybe unpleasant, think about the personal and social stagnation that would come if you are never presented with anything to which you donât immediately and comfortably conform your views.)\n\nProgressive attitude: âthe direct, intimate fusion of visual and emotional enjoyment with the orientation of the expert,â e.g., viewing a Charlie Chaplin film (534).Â The lesser the social significance of the art form, the greater the distinction between criticism and the publicâs enjoyment (e.g., art house films: critics love them, audiences are small; blockbuster summer films: critics disdain them, audiences are hugeâalthough, we do not limit this to professional critics, but the critical evaluation of any of us, i.e., we âask for moreâ from an art film than we do from a fluffy âchick flickâ â¦ however, Benjamin notes the correspondence of the critics and public in film when the evaluation is based upon âmass audience response,â i.e., if success is measured by opening day numbers, then the critic and audience member will both count the same tally).Â In the progressive attitude (in todayâs attitude), we really like the conventional; we really donât like the radically new (i.e., we want the ânext new thingâ to remind us of what we liked yesterday).\n\nPainting and film also differ concerning this dimension of âmass audience responseââthere is no way that a painting can be seen by anything near the same numbers as a film (there is one painting, there are thousands of reels/prints of a film sent around the world.Â Benjamin notes how a crisis dawns in painting when, against its nature, it is confronted directly by the masses for collective experience.Â Through history, paintingâs viewing was conducted through a hierarchical mediation, i.e., a work was shown to sponsors, to the elite of s/he who sponsored it, maybe to the Church or political officials, maybe to the salon crowd, then maybe exclusive showings in private galleries, then many exclusive tours through select museums, etc.Â The masses were never able to organize themselves to view it freshly en masse, without the structure of prior ârankedâ personsâ evaluations.Â In film, the degree to which there are advance screenings and select city openings is limited and typically done for promotion.Â âThus the same public which responds in a progressive manner toward a grotesque film is bound to respond in a reactionary manner to surrealismâ (535).\n\nÂ\n\nXIII)\n\nDiagnosing the unique characteristics of film, one cannot only consider the manner in which the person presents him/herself to the equipment, but also how the person can use the equipment to represent his/her environment.Â Benjamin explores this through reference to psychology and psychoanalysis.Â Film enriches our field of perception in as radical a manner as did the introduction of Freudian psychoanalysis (e.g., consider Freudâs analysis of the hidden psychological tensions or preoccupations revealed by a slip of the tongueâsay, slipping and calling your wife your motherâbefore Freud, these slips would generally go unnoticed, after Freud, they became instants of life to be analyzed)ââFor the entire spectrum of optical, and not also acoustical, perception the film has brought about a similar deepening of apperceptionâ (535; âapperceptionâ is a fully conscious perception, an attention of the self and other, or in the Kantian tradition, an operation similar to self-consciousness).Â In other words, film gives us the opportunity to analyze behavior in a way unlike any static art; we have the close up which can reveal details hidden to the naked eye, you can view it over and again, you can speed up or slow down processes, etc.; behavior can be isolated.Â\n\nIn this capacity of film as a tool for analysis of behavior, we see the merger of art and scienceâits value is to both.Â ââ¦ the film, on the one hand, extends our comprehension of the necessities which rule our lives; on the other hand, it manages to assure us of an immense and unexpected field of actionâ (536).Â There is much that is freed â¦ âwe calmly and adventurously go travelingâ (536).Â âEvidently a different nature opens itself to the camera than opens to the naked eye â¦â (536).Â âThe camera introduces us to unconscious optics as does psychoanalysis to unconscious impulsesâ (536).\n\nHowever, keep in mind here, the more that we become our own objects of study, the more we render ourselves objects, rather than subjects.Â\n\nEpilogue)\n\nIn his epilogue, Benjamin turns dramatically to the political dimensions.Â\n\nFascism is a regime of control and organizationâit seeks to organize the new proletarian masses without undoing the structures that oppress these masses; in order to do this, fascism gives the masses the chance for expression instead of their rightsâthus, we have now âthe right to express themselves,â but this is not a sort of right that would end oppressive conditions and alienation of the masses.Â âThe logical result of fascism is the introduction of aesthetics into political lifeâ (536).Â [Again, consider the time of this writingâ1936âthe Nazi regime offers us the first, but now the norm, for the aestheticization of politics.]Â âAll efforts to render politics aesthetic culminate in one thing: warâ (537).Â [Today, our politics is as much image as then; maybe we have had no civil war, but consider the idea of the seemingly impassable divide between our political parties.]\n\nBenjamin then quotes the âFuturistâ Marinettiâs manifesto (which we will read in week four) to show how war motivates the mobilization of technical resources without affecting any improvement to social structures.Â âFiat arsâpereat mundusâ (âLet art be createdâlet the world perishâ), fascism proclaimed: war will artistically gratify societyâs sense perception that has been changed by technological reproduction.Â From action films to the battlefield right in realityâexplosions just keep getting bigger, more elaborate.Â Benjamin identifies this as the very consummation of lâart pour lâart (art for artâs sake):\n\nâMankind, which in Homerâs time was an object of contemplation for the Olympian gods, now is one for itself.Â Its self-alienation has reached such a degree that it can experience its own destruction as an aesthetic pleasure of the first orderâ (538).Â\n\n4)Â Discussion Prompts:\n\nTuesday, July 22: Discussion Post Five Due: Thoughtfully and thoroughly engage the discussion questions posted in the âBenjaminâ Discussion Forum on Blackboard.\n\n(1) Aura: After describing your interpretation of what Benjamin means by the aura and authenticity of works of art, select any work of art of your choice (again, please upload or link to it), do a little research into it, and describe its aura and analyze whether there has been a contemporary decay of aura in relation to your chosen work.\n\n(2) Ritual Art and Pure Art:Â Compare and contrast Benjamin and Kant on art that is connected to use and art that is for its own sake."
