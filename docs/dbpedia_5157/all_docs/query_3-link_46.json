Six credit hours of the elective courses must be at the upper-division (3000-4000) level\n\nThe minor helps students interested in the study of cinema history, culture and aesthetics, but who are too busy to pursue the full major, the opportunity to develop their interest by acquiring critical and comparative skills and understanding the place and importance of cinema as a cultural and social phenomenon. Students in the minor have access to lower and upper division courses on film history, aesthetics, criticism, social and historical contexts, classical genres, and groundbreaking directors from the US and International traditions, acquiring an edge in visual analysis and media literacy."
