        "text": "“The cinematographer was Erich Gusko. Whether working in color or black-and-white, Gusko brought a visual perfection to the screen that few could match.” —Jim Morton, Lotte in Weimar, eastgermancinema.com\n\n“The film provides an interesting case study in the cultural heritage of the GDR as it is an adaptation of the novel, which is itself a reconsideration of the Goethean tradition.” —Robert Blankenship, Directory of World Cinema, Germany 2\n\n“A brilliant adaptation of Thomas Mann’s novel about the reunion of Goethe and his heroine of The Sorrows of Young Werther.” —Cinémathèque Française, 2003\n\n“Shot partly on location in Weimar and making ample use of Mann’s description of the characters’ clothing, mannerisms, even ways of speaking—be it innkeeper Mager’s Thuringian accent or ‘Kunscht’-Meyer’s Swiss German—the film evokes vividly Weimar life in the years around 1816.” —Dennis F. Mahoney, “Goethe Seen Anew: Egon Günther’s Film Lotte in Weimar. Goethe Yearbook, 1984.\n\n“An ironic film adaptation of Mann’s Goethe novel that describes the disenchanted encounter between an aged Goethe and Charlotte Kestner, his early love. […] Outstanding performances opposite guest star Lilli Palmer by DEFA director Martin Hellberg, as an older Goethe, and Jutta Hoffmann as nervous Adele Schopenhauer.” —filmportal.de\n\n“Jutta Hoffman, as Adele Schopenhauer, outplayed world-renowned Lilli Palmer.” —Volker Baer, Der Tagesspiegel, 1975\n\n“The diversity of themes and the finely woven intricacy of the film narrative’s intermeshed issues, emphases and witticisms are difficult to grasp and interpret coherently. Director Egon Günther, who also wrote the scenario, directed with a subtle, comic tone and sometimes even with culinary relish.” —Günter Sobe, Berliner Zeitung"
