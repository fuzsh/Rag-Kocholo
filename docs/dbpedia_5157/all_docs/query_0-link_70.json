        "text": "Jeu de Paume has gained an international reputation as an art center that exhibits and promotes all forms of mechanical and electronic imagery (photography, cinema, video, installation, online creation, etc.) from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It produces and coproduces exhibitions but also organises film programs, symposiums and seminars, as well as educational activities. Jeu de Paume also publishes a number of art publications each year. With its high profile exhibitions of established, less-known and emerging artists, this venue ties together different narrative strands, mixing the historic and the contemporary.\n\nRenowned artists (Richard Avedon, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Philippe Halsman, Luigi Ghirri, Sally Mann…) and up-and-coming talents (Omer Fast, Oscar Muñoz, Helena Almeida, Ali Cherri…) share the stage, attracting an increasingly wide and diverse audience.\n\nSince 2007, Jeu de Paume has been working to develop its Internet presence and has been experimenting by developing a dedicated “Online Creation Space” with a program of special web-based projects and thematic shows entrusted to curators specialising in the digital arts.\n\nFilm cycles are devised to accompany many of the exhibitions, or simply to pay tribute to major figures of the independent film-making scene in France and abroad. Specialising in documentary, experimental, art-house film and autobiography, with an emphasis on previously unshown work, this program helps to create bridges between film-makers and artists.\n\nAs the successor to the Magazine created in 2010, Jeu de Paume is launching Palm, a new bilingual (French and English) online version, in September 2021. Designed by a special committee around biannual dossiers devoted to historical and contemporary visual cultures.\n\nJeu de Paume aims to be a convivial place of discovery and exchange. The activities with the public and the documentary resources in the field of artistic and cultural education, the partnerships forged with associations in the social and medico-social field, the course cycles and training courses, as well as the proposals for families and young audiences, aim to explore the many dimensions of the image, both historical and contemporary. Jeu de Paume is committed to promoting access for all to its cultural programme and to supporting visitors with special needs in their encounters with the artworks.\n\nAll activities at Jeu de Paume are driven by an overriding desire to draw parallels and engage a dialogue between the various strands of visual culture and images, leading to a re-evaluation and reinvention of meaning in all fields of thought. Talks, seminars and symposia explore the questions and themes raised by the exhibitions, helping to open up new spaces for critical interaction."
