        "text": "Andrew Sarris, who died today, at the age of eighty-three, is the one indispensable American film critic. He brought to American film criticism its crucial idea, its crucial word (“auteur”), and the crucial taste that it signifies: the recognition that the best of Hollywood directors are the equals of great directors anywhere in the world, and that they are the equals of painters, writers, and composers of genius.\n\nSarris (whom I met only briefly, at several screenings) was the American critic who meant the most to me when I was first learning about movies, because I sensed that he was interested in the essential thing—what makes the cinema an art. In the classic split between hedgehogs and foxes, he was the great hedgehog of American criticism. He knew one big thing: the colossal gravitational pull of the director, the true star that held all in its orbit and gave its light to reflect. Sarris may have suffered for staring too long and too fixedly into the directorial sun, but before he showed everyone which way to look, hardly anybody knew that it was there at all. Which is why, on this sad occasion, it seems fitting to talk about the idea and the word with which his name will always be linked.\n\nThe most interesting thing about the term “auteur” is that though it’s the ordinary French word for “author,” in English, it refers solely to movie directors, especially those whose work is deemed artistically ambitious. That’s because it was an aesthetic shock when the word was used, about sixty years ago, by a group of French critics at the newly founded Paris-based journal Cahiers du Cinêma. Their idea was that movie directors exert the same artistic control on (and bear the same moral responsibility for) their film as a writer does for a book, and can therefore be considered the “author” of a film.\n\nThey weren’t the first to recognize that directors are artists, yet their writings proved very controversial, for four reasons. First, they didn’t emphasize movies’ stories—they didn’t ignore them, but they didn’t take political subjects and the adaptations of major literary works to be of any greater intrinsic importance than crime stories, love stories, comedies, Westerns, or musicals. Second, they largely considered acting, cinematography, and the other elements of production in terms of their reflection of the director’s art. Third, they considered some Hollywood directors, working in the industry and serving its commercial ends, to be the equals of European filmmakers working within an expressly humanistic tradition (which is why they came to be known as “Hitchcocko-Hawksians”). Fourth, they saw the art of the cinema as the exemplary art of the era, and so considered directors to be the leading artists of the day. (There was also a fifth, strictly local, reason: they considered most of the major French directors of the time to be terrible filmmakers and denounced them and their films with flamboyant invective.)\n\nFrom the time the idea of the auteur crossed the ocean, in the early sixties, to this day—thanks mainly to Sarris—it has been consistently misunderstood by its detractors, in part because of Sarris’s linguistic peccadillo. He referred to the “auteur theory,” as if it was something that could be proved. The phrase that the French critics used for their idea was la politique des auteurs. It was a “policy,” not a rule, and a “politics,” because it was aimed at power. These critics didn’t only seek the widespread recognition of the directors they admired but (as Jean-Luc Godard told me in 2000) thought they were, in a way, prolonging the French Resistance “against a certain sort of occupation, in the cinema, by people who had no business being there.” They were both asserting a living pantheon of filmmakers they admired and seeking to throw out interlopers in order to make a place for themselves in the film industry (thus the invective).\n\nOf course, these critics—notably, Godard, François Truffaut, Jacques Rivette, Claude Chabrol, and their “godfather” at the magazine, Eric Rohmer, about ten years their senior—did make a place for themselves in the industry and in the ongoing history of cinema. Their own films are the evidence that has confirmed, even canonized, their critical ideas. They were the first to consistently conceive of directors’ work psychologically—to identify themselves with directors and to pass from a consumerist guide to an inside view of the cinema. And this is where the most basic misinterpretation arises.\n\nIf auteurism were nothing other than the recognition of arcane patterns across a director’s body of work, it would have had a short and obscure run. But in fact, its power comes from its inspiration of artists. Wes Anderson described his primordial auteurist experience when I interviewed him for a Profile that ran in the magazine in 2009. His family’s Betamax tapes of Alfred Hitchcock’s films, “with an orange-colored box for ‘Vertigo’ and a blue one for ‘Rear Window’ and a beige one for ‘The Man Who Knew Too Much,’ ” was a central experience for him as a child:\n\nWatching those, you know, the name of the director was right there on the front, you were conscious that this guy was a movie artist, it wasn’t an actor and you weren’t reading about how they built the robots or something like that, instead it was some guy whose thing is making images and sounds and things to tell the story.\n\nAuteurism is the mode of criticism through which burgeoning directors identify those established filmmakers in whom they see themselves—and the future of the art form—reflected. It isn’t a matter of seeing patterns but of seeing directors (as if present and holding forth on the other side of the screen) and identifying with them—not by self-abnegation but by elective affinity and imaginative sympathy.\n\nResistance to the notion of the auteur comes from partisans of so-called collaboration—the evidence of actors performing scripts. It’s a natural thing for film critics (who are, first of all, writers) to identify most closely with screenwriters, just as it’s not surprising that viewers consider actors to be the fullest inventors of a movie. But most great actors are more or less the inventions of directors (imagine John Wayne without John Ford, or Cary Grant without Howard Hawks and Alfred Hitchcock, or Katharine Hepburn without Hawks and George Cukor, or Judy Garland without Cukor and Vincente Minnelli). As for screenwriters, don’t believe the credits: strong directors don’t just oversee the recording of content dictated from an inviolable script, they take an active hand in the substance of a script—all the more so in the era of the independent producer, from the fifties and beyond. (That’s one reason why the postwar years were a golden age in Hollywood.)\n\nWhat those who reject the primacy of directors really favor are norms—whether the political norms of an expressly ideological cinema or the so-called system’s ability to turn out a consistently entertaining (or otherwise ingratiating) product. They emphasize collaboration as a way of limiting the prerogatives of the individual, of subordinating the artist or the freethinker to rules, whether of religion, tradition, or ideology. And in the process, they set themselves up as the defenders of consumers against ostensibly shoddy, deceptive or somehow harmful merchandise. The core of resistance to auteurist ideas is populist demagogy.\n\nThat’s true of Pauline Kael, who made her name as Sarris’s principal detractor and whose acolytes—who seem to put their hands on the Ouija board to consult with her before writing—continue her grudge against the “a” word. Sarris, for his part, was resolutely independent. His following came not from the cultivation of a club or a clan but from the allure of the ideas he put forth. He didn’t embody the spirit of youth at the Village Voice, where he wrote for decades—rather, he inspired it, propelling generations of filmmakers and critics to go behind the screen, practically or virtually, in ways of their own. Whether he’s read or not, he’s the dominant figure of film criticism in the last half century. Like a director, he is present, exercising his influence, unseen, on a vast array of movie people and leaving a virtual impression on screens everywhere, from art houses to multiplexes.\n\nP.S. I quoted Wes Anderson, above, regarding his youthful experience of the director’s artistry. I’m waiting for one of Kael’s followers to respond that auteurism is all well and good for children, who, when they grow up, will learn about the complex realities of life on a set and in the industry. It’s worth remembering that immaturity was one of the most repellently personal (and misguided) charges that Kael launched at Sarris in 1963. I wrote about that big lie.\n\nPhotograph of husband and wife Molly Haskell and Andrew Sarris by Robin Platzer/Twin Images/Time Life Pictures/Getty Images."
