It is designed to prepare students for subsequent study in upper level courses in French and francophone literature, linguistics, civilization, cinema, etc. It is required for students who have completed 140 and recommended for those with an equivalent level, wishing to continue in more advanced French courses or preparing for study abroad. Exceptions can be made with permission of undergraduate chair.\n\nIt is also the appropriate course for those students who have time for only one more French course and wish to solidify their knowledge of the language by continuing to work on all four skills - speaking, listening, reading and writing. Students’ work will be evaluated both in terms of progress in language skills and of ability to handle and engage in the content areas.\n\nThis course does not include a systematic review of French grammar (that is done in French 212). Nevertheless, through the diverse writing assessments (e.g. creative writing; essays), the various textual and visual references (e.g. novels; articles; films; clips), the communicative approach, the students will play an active role in their learning process and consequently will be led to consolidate and deepen their grammatical competence.\n\nThe class studies two thematic units dealing with a wide variety of magazine articles, literary texts, historical documents, movies, songs, etc. In the first dossier, students get a chance to expand their knowledge of French history, with one major focus on World War II and the German occupation of France. In the second dossier, students study contemporary France focusing on issues such as the modern family, education, pop culture. While touching upon issues of identity in France, the class engages the students into an intercultural dialogue which enables them to be more aware of the differences and similarities between the two countries.\n\nFrench 211\n\nFrench for Professions I\n\nProf. Ciesco\n\nSee Timetable for times\n\nThis content-based language course, taught in French, introduces economic, business, and professional terminology through the study of the following topics: financial institutions (banking, stock market and insurance); business practices (business letters and resumes); trade and advertising; the internal structure and legal forms of French companies.\n\nThe course also emphasizes verbal communication through three components:\n\nIn-class activities such as problem-solving tasks, discussions and debates.\n\nThe study of authentic materials such as newspapers and magazines’ articles, video clips, and radio shows.\n\nA series of students’ presentations.\n\nFinally, in order to use and practice the new economic and business terminology studied in this course, and to also further explore the structure, the management, and the operations of the French companies, students will work in pairs on a research project about a major French company of their choice.\n\nOne of the other goals of this course is to also prepare the students to take one of the exams offered by the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry: the Diplôme de Français Professionnel, Affaires, C1. This exam will be held on campus in April.\n\nPrerequisite: FREN 202 highly recommended. No business background necessary.\n\nFrench 212\n\nAdvanced French Grammar & Composition\n\nStaff\n\nSee Timetable for times\n\nIntensive review of grammar integrated into writing practice. A good knowledge of basic French grammar is a prerequisite (French 202 or equivalent is recommended). Conducted entirely in French, the course will study selected grammatical difficulties of the French verbal and nominal systems including colloquial usage. Frequent oral and written assignments with opportunity for rewrites.\n\nArticles from French newspapers and magazines, literary excerpts, and a novel or short stories will be used as supplementary materials in order to prepare students to take content courses in French in disciplines other than French.\n\nFrench 214\n\nProf. Philippon-Daniel\n\nAdvanced French Composition and Conversation\n\nSee Timetable for times\n\nEntitled Contemporary French society through its media, this course is intended to improve speaking and writing skills by offering extensive practice in a variety of styles and forms. It will also help students better understand contemporary French culture, thought and modes of expression. The content is organized around current events and the themes of identity and art. Activities include the study, analysis and emulation of model texts as well as discussion and debates about events and social issues as covered by the French news media (television, print, internet sources). Students will practice oral skills in a variety of ways, including video blogs and group presentations on selected current events. Written practice will comprise reflective journals, essays and collaborative work on Web projects.\n\nThe goal of this course is to help students attain the Advanced level of proficiency in speaking and writing (by ACTFL standards). The specific language functions we will work on are narration, description, offering and soliciting advice and opinions, expressing feelings, critique and analysis, argumentation.\n\n(Recommended for students who are planning to study abroad in France)\n\nFrench 217\n\nFrench Phonetics\n\nProf. Edelstein\n\nSee Timetable for times\n\nFrench 221-401\n\nIdeas of Love and Friendship in French Literature from the Middle Ages to the Present\n\nProf. Francis\n\nSee Timetable for times\n\nWe tend to think of love when we think of France, as in the iconic 1950 photograph of the “baiser de l’Hôtel de Ville.” But when we look at how love and its corollary, friendship, are represented in French and Francophone literature, we realize that we cannot take these concepts as givens. Is love compatible with social responsibilities like marriage? How do people form ideas of perfect love, marriage, or friendship, and to what extent are their ideas shaped by stories, myths, and books? Why do poets write about love, and how do their motivations change or stay the same from the pre-modern to the modern era? What do love and sexual attraction tell us about attitudes toward religion and race? What is the difference between love and friendship, and which is stronger?\n\nThis course will answer these questions by examining a range of genres and authors, both male and female, from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century. We will see how ideas of love, marriage, and friendship evolve over time, and we will study the literary and rhetorical strategies used to communicate them in the works we study. Students will acquire the critical tools to analyze, discuss, and write about literary texts and films while perfecting their oral and written expression in French.\n\nAuthors studied include Marie de France, Marguerite de Navarre, Pierre de Ronsard, Louise Labé, Michel de Montaigne, Molière, Denis Diderot, Charles Baudelaire, Gustave Flaubert, Frantz Fanon, and Roland Barthes. We will also watch and discuss René Clair’s Sous les toits de Paris.\n\nFrench 221-402\n\nPerspectives in French Literature\n\nProf. Goulet\n\nSee Timetable for times\n\nFrench 221-403\n\nPerspectives in French Literature\n\nProf. Richman\n\nSee Timetable for times\n\nFrench 226\n\nFrench Civilization from Beginning to 1789\n\nProf. Peron\n\nSee Timetable for times\n\nEntitled La Fabrique de l’Histoire, this course anlyzes the construction of the so-called national memory through its places of memory (lieux de mémoire) , as well as its places of non-memory (lieux de non-mémoire), going from the Gauls to the Enlightenment.\n\nPrerequisites : at least two 200-level courses beyond 202\n\nThe course is entirely conducted in French.\n\nFrench 230\n\nMasterpieces of French Cinema\n\nProf. Met\n\nSee Timetable for time\n\nCross listed with: CINE 245\n\nThe purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the history and scope of French cinema all the way to the present time through the analysis of key works of the French film canon. Particular attention will be paid to successive period styles (“le réalisme poétique”, “la qualité française”, “la nouvelle vague”, “le film de banlieue”, etc.) as well as various genres (war, drama, comedy, crime, etc.) and the notion of auteurism. A variety of critical lenses will be used (psychoanalysis, socio-historical and cultural context, politics, esthetics, gender…) to better understand the specificities and complexities of these films.\n\nThis course will help you enhance your analytical skills through the in-depth study of key scenes. You will learn to identify the formal techniques specific to the film medium and inscribe their relevance within both a historical and theoretical context.\n\nThe lecture is conducted in English; students seeking French credit should register for the FREN 230-401 lecture and FREN 230-402 recitation; the latter is conducted in French. The CINE lecture (CINE 245-401) and recitation (CINE 245-403) are taught in English.\n\nFrench 250\n\nMarriage and the Novel\n\nProf. Dejean\n\nSee Timetable for time\n\nCross listed with: ENGL 260, COML 272, HIST 251\n\nHistorians have argued that early novels helped shape public opinion on many controversial issues. And no subject was more often featured in novels than marriage. In the course of the 18th and the 19th centuries, at a time when marriage as an institution was being radically redefined, almost all the best known novels explored happy as well as unhappy unions, individuals who decided not to marry as well as those whose lives were destroyed by the institution. They showcased marriage in other words in ways certain to provoke debate. We will both survey the development of the modern novel from the late 17th to the early 20th century and study the treatment of marriage in some of the greatest novels of all time.\n\nWe will begin with novels from the French and English traditions, the national literatures in which the genre first took shape, in particular Laclos’ Dangerous Liaisons, Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, Brontë’s Jane Eyre, Flaubert’s Madame Bovary. We will then turn to works from other European traditions such as Goethe’s Elective Affinities and Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina.\n\nWe will begin the course by discussing the novel often referred to as the first modern novel, The Princess de Clèves. The Princess de Clèves was also the first novel centered on an exploration of questions central to the debate about marriage for over two centuries – everything from the question of whether one should marry for love or for social position to the question of adultery.\n\nFrench 310\n\nFrench Modernity/Discontents\n\nProf. Zhuo\n\nSee Timetable for time\n\nWhat does it mean to be in tune with and ahead of one’s time? How do technological inventions, types of consumption, fashion trends and prevailing discourses impact our experience in everyday life and worldview? This course focuses on three periods in recent French history that connote the idea of “modernity” — the Second Empire, the Belle Epoque/Années Folles, andthe postwar economic boom era (1950s and 1960s). Literature, art, film and social criticism will be combined to explore the French’s fascination with modernity on the one hand and their attachment to tradition and to an “authentic” way of life on the other. In addition to an overview of the social-cultural-political history of France from the 1860s to the 1990s, we will use these texts as springboards to reflect on our own era: our relation to time, space and personal/group identity in the age of hyper-technology and globalization. Authors include Baudelaire, Zola, Apollinaire, Breton, Barthes, Beauvoir, Perec, Varda and C. Denis. Conducted in French.\n\nFrench 322\n\nFrance and the European Union\n\nProf. Philippon-Daniel\n\nSee Timetable for time\n\nThis course aims to provide an understanding of the European Union as a complex entity: its history, institutions, challenges and future. After reviewing the history of European integration and describing the Community’s institutions, common programs and market, we will consider a wide variety of themes important to Europe: economics, business, science, education, immigration, the environment, social issues, national and European identity, a Federal Europe vs a Europe of nations, European social/cultural models vs American liberalism, relations between the EU and the rest of the world. Students will be responsible for pursuing substantive research on these and other topics and participating actively in debates. We will also follow and discuss current events that are pertinent to the EU in general and to France in particular.\n\nThis class will be conducted entirely in French and is designed to improve cross-cultural understanding and communicative skills in the presentational, interpretive, and interpersonal modes.\n\nFrench 380\n\nViolence and the Sacred\n\nProf. Richman\n\nSee Timetable for time\n\nThe purpose of this course is to understand why some of the most innovative works of the twentieth century appeared under the dual signs of violence and the sacred. Drawing from sociology and anthropology, they contend that from the foundations of social life to the appearance of art and religion, humans have instituted rituals in order to transgress their limits and confront the violence of death and desire. Outside the norms of everyday life, most rituals fall under the purview of the sacred without implying belief in a transcendent deity. Refusing to relegate this “left” sacred to exotic otherness, writers, intellectuals, and artists explored manifestations of trance, possession, the festival and sacrifice in their own experiences of art, writing, music, and sexuality. Ultimately, they tested the boundaries of modern individualism by seeking collective alternatives to warfare or politics.\n\nWomen figure prominently in the conjunction between violence and the sacred, both as authors and as heroines for modernity. Whether the Old Testament figure Judith, the Roman Lucretia, or prehistoric “Venus” figurines, these icons defy conventional assumptions regarding female victimization. The female point of view is amplified by excerpts from the re-definition of the sacred by “Laure”, as well as from the classic Histoire d’ O, whose depiction of ritualized erotic violence paradoxically contributed to the discourse by women in favor of sexual freedom.\n\nReadings will survey the considerable literature on this subject by means of accessible essays, a documentary, and short works of fiction. Authors include Emile Durkheim, Georges Bataille, Roger Caillois, Michel Leiris, Colette Peignot “Laure,” “Pauline Réage” [Dominique Aury], René Girard.\n\nRequirements: at least one course above 202; 212 or 214; 221 or 222, or equivalent. Conducted entirely in French; several short response papers, a mid-term exam, and one final essay. Students are expected to participate actively in class discussions in order to qualify for at least an A-. If you are not comfortable with this format, please speak to professor.\n\nFrench 384\n\nThe French Novel of the 20th Century\n\nProf. Prince\n\nSee Timetable for time\n\nA study of the twentieth-century French novel from modernism, surrealism, and existentialism to postmodernism and the \"extrême contemporain\" and from Proust and Gide, through Sartre and Camus, to Modiano and Houellebecq."
