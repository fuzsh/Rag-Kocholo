        "text": "Courtiers Dance Through Changes (03:03)\n\nFREE PREVIEW\n\nGoethe is 40-years-old in 1789. The ballroom at Weimar court echoes old melodies, but in France there is a revolution.\n\nRevolution in France (00:55)\n\nIn 1791, the constituent assembly proclaims the rights of men. In 1792, the monarchy is abolished. In 1793, Louis XVI is executed and Jacobins begin a reign of terror. In 1794, Robespierre is overthrown.\n\nGoethe's Progressive Views (02:31)\n\nGoethe is repelled by news of the French Revolution and refuses to take part in public affairs. He regards his color theory as his most important work. He recalls the 1792 bombardment of Valmy.\n\n\"Hermann and Dorothea\" (00:54)\n\nThe story of a family and a refugee is Goethe's first popular story in years. Christiana Vulpius bears Goethe five children; only one survives. Vulpius represents normal life to Goethe.\n\n\"The Sorcererâ€™s Apprentice\" (02:46)\n\nIn 1799, Friedrich Schiller moves to Weimar. His views move Goethe to give birth to the spirit of antiquity in his art. Together, Schiller and Goethe satirize the age. We hear \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice.\"\n\nA Tough Period for Goethe (02:36)\n\nIn 1805, Friedrich Schiller dies while Goethe is very ill. In 1806, Weimar is occupied by French troops. Christiana Vulpius rescues Goethe from soldiers; they are married five days later. In 1808, Goethe meets Napoleon.\n\n\"Elective Affinities\" (02:13)\n\nDuring the years of social and political upheaval, Goethe focuses on his family and studies. He dictates most of his work and writes of his marriage and his youth. The first part of \"Poetry in Truth\" appears in 1811.\n\nGoethe No Longer Withdrawals (02:04)\n\nGoethe entertains guests on a regular basis; enrichment of his personality is more important than public acknowledgment. Guests browse through Goethe's collections; he is becoming interested in mineralogy.\n\n\"The West-Eastern Divan\" (02:06)\n\nGoethe writes a letter about his journey on the River Rhine; a Persian poet inspires his collection of poems. Marianne von Willemer contributes poems to Goethe's collection.\n\n\"Faust\" (04:07)\n\nGoethe's wife dies in 1816; he writes of Christiane's passing. Goethe resumes work on \"Faust\" to escape mourning; his writing depicts time's relativity. We see a reenactment of the second part of Faust.\n\n\"Marienbad Elegy\" (01:35)\n\n\"Faust\" is not opened until after Goethe's death. His diary records his sufferings in his later life. In 1821, he meets Ulrike von Levetzow who refuses his proposal. Goethe composes a song of farewell to the world.\n\nGoethe's Final Years (03:29)\n\nFrom 1803-1828 several of Goethe's friends die and in 1830, his son dies. Goethe withdraws from society. Goethe writes on the walls of the cabin for a second time. He dies on March 2, 1832 and is buried in Weimar.\n\nCredits: Into a New Century: 1789-1832 (00:59)\n\nCredits: Into a New Century: 1789-1832"
