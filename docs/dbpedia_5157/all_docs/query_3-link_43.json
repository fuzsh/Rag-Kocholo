What connects these tales is that their voyages are not only voyages of discovery, but voyages of self-discovery. By describing the effects these voyages have on the characters who undertake them, and by hinting at comparisons between the lands described in the story and their own society, authors use fantastic voyages as vehicles for incisive commentary on literary, social, political, and scientific issues.\n\nIn this course, we will explore the tradition of the fantastic voyage from Homer’s Odyssey, one of the earliest examples of this type of narrative and a model for countless subsequent voyage narratives, to modern science fiction, which appropriates this narrative for its own ends. We will determine what the common stylistic elements of voyage narratives are, such as the frame narrative, or story-within-a-story, and what purpose they serve in conveying the tale’s messages. We will see how the voyagers attempt to understand and interact with the lands and peoples they encounter, and what these attempts tell us about both the voyagers and their newly-discovered counterparts. Finally, we will ask ourselves what real-world issues are commented upon by these narratives, what lessons the narratives have to teach about them, and how they impart these lessons to the reader. Though this course is primarily dedicated to literature, we will also watch several seminal film adaptations to determine how cinematographic techniques can inform narratives of fantastic voyage.\n\nThis course is meant not only for SF fans who would like to become better acquainted with the precursors and classics of the genre, but for all those who wish to learn how great works of fiction, far from being intended solely for entertainment and escapism, attempt to improve upon the real world through the effect they have on the reader. Readings and discussion are in English; an additional discussion group devoted to the original French versions of Cyrano, Verne and Boulle may be formed, as well, given sufficient interest.\n\nTexts and Films\n\n- Homer, The Odyssey (8th century BCE)\n\n- Lucian of Samosata, A True Story (2nd century CE)\n\n- Cyrano de Bergerac, The Other World: The States and Empires of the Moon (1657)\n\n- Jonathan Swift, Gulliver’s Travels (1726)\n\n- Jules Verne, Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas (1870)\n\n- 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, dir.

It is designed to prepare students for subsequent study in upper level courses in French and francophone literature, linguistics, civilization, cinema, etc. It is required for students who have completed 140 and recommended for those with an equivalent level, wishing to continue in more advanced French courses or preparing for study abroad. Exceptions can be made with permission of undergraduate chair.\n\nIt is also the appropriate course for those students who have time for only one more French course and wish to solidify their knowledge of the language by continuing to work on all four skills - speaking, listening, reading and writing. Students’ work will be evaluated both in terms of progress in language skills and of ability to handle and engage in the content areas.\n\nThis course does not include a systematic review of French grammar (that is done in French 212). Nevertheless, through the diverse writing assessments (e.g. creative writing; essays), the various textual and visual references (e.g. novels; articles; films; clips), the communicative approach, the students will play an active role in their learning process and consequently will be led to consolidate and deepen their grammatical competence.\n\nThe class studies two thematic units dealing with a wide variety of magazine articles, literary texts, historical documents, movies, songs, etc. In the first dossier, students get a chance to expand their knowledge of French history, with one major focus on World War II and the German occupation of France. In the second dossier, students study contemporary France focusing on issues such as the modern family, education, pop culture. While touching upon issues of identity in France, the class engages the students into an intercultural dialogue which enables them to be more aware of the differences and similarities between the two countries.\n\nFrench 211\n\nFrench for Professions I\n\nProf. Ciesco\n\nSee Timetable for times\n\nPrerequisite: FREN 202 highly recommended. No business background necessary.\n\nThis content-based language course, taught in French, introduces economic, business, and professional terminology through the study of the following topics: financial institutions (banking, stock market and insurance); business practices (business letters and resumes); trade and advertising; the internal structure and legal forms of French companies.\n\nThe course also emphasizes verbal communication through three components:\n\nIn-class activities such as problem-solving tasks, discussions and debates.\n\nThe study of authentic materials such as newspapers and magazines’ articles, video clips, and radio shows.\n\nA series of students’ presentations.\n\nFinally, in order to use and practice the new economic and business terminology studied in this course, and to also further explore the structure, the management, and the operations of the French companies, students will work in pairs on a research project about a major French company of their choice.\n\nOne of the other goals of this course is to also prepare the students to take one of the exams offered by the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry: the Diplôme de Français Professionnel, Affaires, C1. This exam will be held on campus in April.\n\nFrench 212\n\nAdvanced French Grammar & Composition\n\nStaff\n\nSee Timetable for times\n\nIntensive review of grammar integrated into writing practice. A good knowledge of basic French grammar is a prerequisite (French 202 or equivalent is recommended). Conducted entirely in French, the course will study selected grammatical difficulties of the French verbal and nominal systems including colloquial usage. Frequent oral and written assignments with opportunity for rewrites.\n\nArticles from French newspapers and magazines, literary excerpts, and a novel or short stories will be used as supplementary materials in order to prepare students to take content courses in French in disciplines other than French.\n\nFrench 214\n\nAdvanced Comp & Conversation\n\nProf. Philippon-Daniel\n\nSee Timetable for time\n\nThis course is intended to improve speaking and writing skills by offering extensive practice in a variety of styles and forms. It will also help students better understand contemporary French culture, thought and modes of expression. The content is organized around current events and the themes of identity and art. Activities include the study, analysis and emulation of model texts as well as discussion and debates about events and social issues as covered by the French news media (television, print, Internet sources).\n\nStudents will practice oral skills in a variety of ways, including video blogs and group presentations on selected current events. Written practice will comprise reflective journals, essays and collaborative work on a class newspaper project.\n\n(Recommended for students who are planning to study abroad in France)\n\nFrench 217\n\nFrench Phonetics\n\nProf. Edelstein\n\nSee Timetable for time\n\nFrench 221-401\n\nPerspectives in French Literature: Love and Passion\n\nProf. Goulet\n\nSee Timetable for time\n\nThis course will provide a survey of French literature through exemplary texts from the Middle Ages to the 20 th century through the thematic prism of love and passion. Although France’s shifting socio-political contexts will frame our discussions, class work will emphasize the following: a) textual analysis: what rhetorical strategies are at play? what tools can we employ to write effectively about poetry, theater, and novels?; b) literary history: how did different genres develop through the ages? how did authors respond to their predecessors?; and c) philosophical reflexion: how are desire, marriage, and sexuality intertwined? how can reading fictions from other cultures and eras help us reflect on constructions of gender?. Authors studied may include Marie de France, Pierre de Ronsard, Louise Labé, Racine, Maxime Prévost, Choderlos de Laclos, Honoré de Balzac, Charles Baudelaire, Rachilde, Marguerite Duras, and Nicole Brossard.\n\nRequirement: successful completion of either 212 or 214 or an AP equivalent.\n\nFrench 221-402\n\nLove, Passion and Eroticism in French and Francophone Literature From the Middle Ages to the Present\n\nProf. Dougherty\n\nSee Timetable for time\n\nThis course will investigate diverse representations of love, passion and eroticism from the Middle Ages to the twenty-first century. How and why have paradigms shifted throughout the ages? In writing about love, passion and eroticism, what differences can we discern between male and female authors and the characters they create? We will consider several forms of love, including unrequited, idealized, tragic, adulterous, illicit, and of course, le coup de foudre! We will also examine the transformation of love and passion into jealousy, obsession, complacency and hatred. During the course of the semester, you will also acquire the vocabulary and critical skills required to effectively analyze, both orally and in writing, poetry, theater and prose. All readings, discussion and written work will be in French.\n\nFrench 221-403\n\nLove in France from the Middle Ages to the Present\n\nProf. Richman\n\nSee Timetable for time\n\nRepresentations of love, passion and desire furnish the reading matter for this course. Our goal is to trace a tradition from which contemporary culture continues to draw inspiration, as evidenced in recent songs and films also included in our panorama. Guiding our historical overview is the long-standing association between France and love. Did the French invent love---its conventions and language? What were the historical, social and cultural factors contributing to such a connection? Does it still exist today? Also included are comparisons with theoretical speculations, from Plato, Hegel, Freud and Lacan.\n\nTexts include excerpts from Tristan et Iseut and from correspondence of Héloïse et Abélard, Phèdre, Le Jeu de l’amour et du hasard, Une passion dans le desert,l’Amant, some poems, clips from recent films.\n\nRequirement: successful completion of either 212 or 214 or an AP equivalent.\n\nFrench 226\n\nFrench Civilization from Beginning to 1789\n\nProf. Peron\n\nSee Timetable for time\n\nFrench 230\n\nMasterpieces of French Cinema\n\nProf. Met\n\nSee Timetable for time\n\nThe purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the history and scope of French cinema all the way to the present time through the analysis of key works of the French film canon. Particular attention will be paid to successive period styles (“le réalisme poétique”, “la qualité française”, “la nouvelle vague”, “le film de banlieue”, etc.) as well as various genres (war, drama, comedy, crime, etc.). A variety of critical lenses will be used (psychoanalysis, socio-historical and cultural context, politics, aesthetics, gender…) in an effort to better understand the specificities and complexities of these films.\n\nFrench 250\n\nThe Novel & Marriage\n\nProf. Dejean\n\nSee Timetable for time\n\nHistorians have argued that early novels helped shape public opinion on many controversial issues. And no subject was more often featured in novels than marriage. In the course of the 18 th and the 19 th centuries, at a time when marriage as an institution was being radically redefined, almost all the best known novels explored happy as well as unhappy unions, individuals who decided not to marry as well as those whose lives were destroyed by the institution. They showcased marriage in other words in ways certain to provoke debate. We will both survey the development of the modern novel from the late 17 th to the early 20 th century and study the treatment of marriage in some of the greatest novels of all time.\n\nWe will begin with novels from the French and English traditions, the national literatures in which the genre first took shape, in particular Laclos’ Dangerous Liaisons, Austen’s Persuasion, Brontë’s Jane Eyre, Flaubert’s Madame Bovary. We will then turn to works from other European traditions such as Goethe’s Elective Affinities, Manzoni’s The Betrothed, Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina.\n\nWe will begin the course by discussing the novel often referred to as the first modern novel, The Princess de Clèves, an ideal beginning for this course, since it was written by a woman writer, Lafayette – more than any other genre, the modern novel was the creation of women writers. The Princess de Clèves was also the first novel centered on an exploration of questions central to the debate about marriage for over two centuries – everything from the question of whether one should marry for love or for social position to the question of adultery.\n\nAll readings, writing, and discussion will be in English.\n\nFrench 370\n\nFrench Literature of the 19th Century\n\nProf. Goulet\n\nSee Timetable for time\n\nSpecial Topic: Poe’s French Legacies\n\nEdgar Allan Poe was considered a vulgar hack by many of his fellow Americans, but in 19 th-century France, he was touted as a misunderstood poetic genius, the original poète maudit. Through the translations of Charles Baudelaire, who found in Poe a kindred spirit in the “goût de l’infini,” French intellectuals came to know the American writer as a fount of aesthetic wisdom, diabolical sensibility, and mystic mastery. In this course, we will study Baudelaire’s poetry as well as the many literary and artistic movements in France that were directly inspired by Poe’s uncanny mix of the macabre and the methodical: Symbolist poetry (Valéry, Mallarmé), the Scientific Fantastic (Maupassant, Villiers de l’Isle-Adam), fin-de-siècle Decadence (Huysmanns, Odilon Redon), Science Fiction (Verne), the detective novel (Gaboriau), and 20 th-century Surrealism (Breton, Max Ernst).\n\nAll readings and discussion in French.\n\nFrench 380\n\nTwentieth Century French Novel\n\nProf. Prince\n\nSee Timetable for time\n\nA study of first person novel from from modernism and existentialism to post-modernism and from Proust and Gide through Sartre and Camus to Modiano and Toussaint.\n\nFrench 390\n\nIntroduction to Francophone African and Caribbean Cultures\n\nProf. Anyinefa\n\nSee Timetable for time\n\nPurpose of this course is to introduce students to Francophone African (South of the Sahara) and Caribbean literatures, cultural theories, and cinema, and more generally to postcolonial cultures in the French speaking world. We will study some of the most celebrated Francophone African and Caribbean authors and filmmakers (among others, Bâ, Césaire, Fanon, Oyono, Peck, Sembène) and acquaint ourselves with predominant aesthetic, thematic and ideological features of their works.\n\nReading and class discussion in French"
