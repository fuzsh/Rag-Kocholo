        "text": "Hello, readers.\n\nThe other day I looked out the window and saw what looked like a dead skunk in the middle of the street. Overcome with curiosity, I trotted out to investigate and found the “skunk” to be a pair of black sweatpants with a white stripe that had been reduced to two dimensions under passing vehicles. It was a stormy day and the pants must have blown onto the street from a rooftop clothesline; the only other explanation — a partial striptease in the middle of an urban thoroughfare — seemed unlikely, though not impossible.\n\nIf you couldn’t guess from the title of this newsletter, wind is a topic of enduring personal interest. Like many of life’s intriguing forces (love, hate, etc.) it is palpable but invisible. Visual artists tend to represent the effects of wind — on the ocean, a French flag, a man’s formidable beard — rather than wind itself, presumably for this reason.\n\nMy preferred source of info is Windy.com, which depicts the phenomenon as — how to put this? — shoals of spermatozoa. The presentation is intuitive and well executed. On that website you can check the forecast in your neighborhood or explore notoriously windy places like Antarctica or Wichita. At the time of this writing Wichita is enjoying south winds of six to 14 miles per hour, with gusts as high as 20 m.p.h.\n\nThe first book below is a treasury of wind descriptions and nature metaphors. Perfect for fellow anemophiles.\n\n—Molly"
