        "text": "Short report\n\nIsabelle Huppert and the Taviani Bros. An irresistible combination, if ever there was one. Based on a Goethe novel, it concerns two who were in love in youth but never married until they find each other later. They marry and are happy, it seems, but then the husband invites an old friend to visit and the wife counters with inviting a godchild to join.\n\nUnsurprisingly, different partnerships ensue.\n\nWhat is the film? Beautiful bodies are gloriously presented. Along with the home, it’s contents and the Tuscany countryside, the visual spectacle is like a living painting.\n\nNothing that takes place is particularly revelatory. In a larger view, It’s just about the fickleness of desires in the human comedy and tragedy.\n\nConsidering the cinematic landscape, and the creators, sometimes it’s just what one needs.\n\nNetflix disc\n\nYear: 1996\n\nIsabelle Huppert Films\n\nItalian adaptation of the Goethe story that falls flat mostly through its lack of imagination in how it treats the source material. Not helping matters is the dubbing, and not just because it means another film where I don't get to hear Isabelle's lovely smoky ASMR voice; it's often really over-wrought and lays waste to the subtlety the main cast try to bring to their performances.\n\nIsabelle looks radiant and I like the Italian countryside + villa backdrops but this is mostly a misfire and a project she feels ill at ease in; not much else to say."
