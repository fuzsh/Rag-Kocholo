        "text": "In this presentation architect and writer Aristide Antonas engages in a conversation with poet and Editor in Chief of documenta 14’s publications Quinn Latimer on the relationship between reading, architecture and education. Antonas’ ongoing work on the ‘Empty University’ has its latest articulation in the Old Library, the aneducation space at the Athens School of Fine Arts. The discussion opens up to overlapping affinities between practices of writing, architecture and texts that normally are not considered poetic: scripts, legal texts or even manuals that propose a structure to be built out of their use. In which circumstances could we name these texts poetic?\n\nQuinn Latimer is an American poet, critic, and editor based in Basel and Athens. She is the author of Rumored Animals (Dream Horse Press, 2012); Sarah Lucas: Describe This Distance (Mousse Publishing, 2013); and Film as a Form of Writing: Quinn Latimer Talks to Akram Zaatari (Weils, 2014). Her writings and readings have been presented widely, including at the Serpentine Galleries, London; Whitechapel Gallery, London; Kunsthalle Zurich, Switzerland; and the Venice Architecture Biennale, Italy. She is Editor-in-Chief of Publications for documenta 14.\n\nAristide Antonas is a Greek architect and writer. He holds a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Nanterre, University of Paris X. Antonas has been a visiting lecturer in Massachussets Institute of Technology (MIT), Fine Art Academy of Gyumri (Armenia), Bauhaus-Universität Weimar, Politecnico di Milano (a.o.). He was co-curator of the Greek Pavilion for the Venice Biennale in 2004 (Paradigmata). His essays are mostly published in the Internet, his literature books are printed in Greek (Agra Editions) and one short story in English (jrp Ringier, Zurich). Two of his theater scripts were performed in French and one in Greek."
