        "text": "The Rick Lopez Eventography\n\nMASSIVE REFORMATTING going on (2023-’24)—Cleaned up nicely through October of ’84.\n\nThings to Know:\n\nEntries that are linked in the \"what have I been doing\" list below are creative performances, works, and projects that I was either\n\nat the center of, or directly involved in. Strewn about between these linked \"events\" are activities by others that I produced or\n\npresented, as well as other occurrences that had a direct influence on what I do.\n\nI started this on January 23, 2009, after talks with my wife Sandra, my son Aaron, and my sister Lisa. (Thank you!)\n\nLatest update: February 25, 2023, and still much remains to do...\n\nThis is the first time I've ever stopped long enough to look back, and even though I've only gone through a hand-full of files\n\namong the four cabinets I have stuffed with them, I'm already surprised as hell.\n\nWhy now? I've been searching for a way to organize the archives for years. Because I'm always forging ahead into the next\n\nthing that I have to do, the documentation has always been in such a deconstructed mess that I've feared no one would know\n\nwhat to make of most of it if I were to ever disappear. So this is my explanation. To my wife and my son and my sister, but\n\nalso to my friends and all of the amazing creative folk that have helped me and created with me and inspired me to keep\n\nmoving even though I'm always just so damned tired. I hope they'll all enjoy going through this as much as I'm enjoying\n\nputting it all together.\n\nAnyone who has news of events that I'm missing or have forgotten about, or any corrections, photographs,\n\nrecordings, programs, anecdotes, appreciations, details, memories... Please don’t hesitate to call, write,\n\ne-mail, knock on my door, and help me flesh out this monstrosity.\n\nOn the Icons: A visual trail of crumbs to help give a better sense of the flow of activities. Concourse: Mentor Charles Ventrello’s legendary jazz 4tet invited percussionists Joe Scutella and I to join in 1976. By mid '77 I was the drummer-half of the rhythm section with bassist Dave Blaetz. I left Concourse in '83, and I'm still playing with Dave.\n\nWriting: Essays, newspaper articles, columns, poetry, prose, journals, reading appearances, books, and mentions of unpublished works that have nonetheless had an impact. Music (various): This is what I do—Playing drums. Special projects, short-term gigs, guest appearances, one-offs, theatrical ensembles, etcetera! Time/Space Ltd: Damun Gracenin’s face, member of Ed Myers' Performance Art ensemble. Ed... I hardly know what to say. If we did kindergarten together we'd get all A’s in \"Works well with one another.\" He refined my way of \"...gathering the diversity and rearranging it,\"—words, gestures, sound, staging. Everything. Samuel Beckett: “I filled ten feet of shelf space... with criticism, unpublished ephemera, video and audio tapes... attended symposiums... world premieres, produced and directed three programs of the one-act plays, joined the Samuel Beckett Society, subscribed to the Journal of Beckett Studies, and gradually drowned. It was a good death...\" Miscellaneous Theatre: Sucked in initially as a member of various music ensembles, which somehow led to all sorts of trouble, including tech work, props-mastering, production, directing, and anything else that might keep me involved in such a fulfilling community. (Image is a mask by Brently Michael Davis) APE: Lenny Bove, just off a long project with Tom Herman (Pere Ubu) Had this idea about a duo that would play with pre-recorded rhythm and effects tracks. Sound files to come... Alternative Arts Series: May through October, 1984. I have *77* productions listed, and I've not finished yet. Ed Myers and I, the C0-Producers/Directors of this violent storm, are both lucky to be alive... The image is Ed’s mouth, as used in the AAS logo. Kangaroo Court Publishing: In 1984 dear friend Lonnie Sherman had a wayward collection of manuscripts dropped in his lap, and once I realized I was making books, all hell began to break loose. I carried it around the world before collapsing in a heap in late '89. (Original KCP logo by Barb Finney) Field Theory: An amazing improvisational “Jazz Power Trio” that began as a duo of Frank Butrey and I only to be pushed through the roof when we added Dave Blaetz on bass. This band had quite the following; we could slay a concert audience and make a bar-crowd go wild. Blood Pudding: Ick (the name)... But the group itself was a blast. Between the quirky Popp songs, the hook-infested Cuneo pop tunes, and Tom Arndt’s thrumming behind me, we made one hell of a crazy rock band. DiBello/Bodine: D.A.M.N. / Dance Art Music Network. Rick DiBello and Alethea Bodine mount multi-media stage-works and futuristic musical extravaganzas, and they often invite me in. (Image from DiBello Design.) Shen & Bones Performance Group: The Butoh-inspired dance group, child of Lani Fand-Weissbach, whose work I became involved in beginning with DiBello/Bodine, and then moving forward to collaborations wth J.A. Popp’s Weirdo Theatre. (Image of Fand-Weissbach) Joseph Allen Popp’s Weirdo Theatre: Popp had a dream-band in mind and we all said yes. The main 4tet of Popp, Gray, Cornelius, and I work like limbs on a single body. (JAPWT mole-skin logo from a J.A. Popp graphic) if/then: I introduced myself to guitarist Ian Smith by telling him we had a gig and that we were not to give it another thought until it was time to play. It worked, and it keeps working, a pure start-from-zero improv duo that often adds a 3rd or 4th guest to keep things lively. Circuit-board graphic is as right as can be. Sturgis Nikides and the Electric Assassins: I'm still not sure how this happened. It’s all good though! MONSTRO: I was so thrilled to be invited into this Ian Smith project. Ian on guitar and laptop and spoken mayhem. Joe Rumball on bass. A whale of a band. The Treble-Makers: The first cover band I've been involved with in 40 years... Willie Cotter on guitar and vocals, Ray Reilly on bass, and a set-list of mid-'60s rock'n'roll. FALL RISK: A dream band! Joseph Allen Popp on guitars and effects boards and Freddy Krugger on bass (finally!!!). Intense, Beastly, Drone-Hop Rock'n'Roll Improv on Wheels. May well be the best band I've ever been in.

I’m 3½ years old, setting up my first drum set.\n\nMy first teachers were my Aunt Carol (who made a living doing big\n\nband and country western and wedding gigs down in Florida well\n\ninto her sixties), and my Uncle Dickie, one of my hometown’s most\n\npopular small combo players, whose legs I’d guess those are on\n\nthe lower left.\n\nMy Grandfather, Dick Abbey, always had the Pall Mall going.\n\n1958 : : :\n\n1958.00.00 • My own private Academy of the Performing Arts, Part 2\n\nSpring, 1958. My first theatrical role, just a few months after\n\nmy fifth birthday.\n\nIt was a harrowing production of Old McDonald at Perry Elementary\n\nSchool. I was cast as one of the doomed chicks, a great experience—\n\nbeing involved in such a tight ensemble of young talent.

I was six years old, and had moved on quickly,\n\ntaking on a broad spectrum of roles now, mastering in quick succession\n\nsong and dance (on the hassock in my ’wears singing “Sixteen Tons”\n\nin the voice of Tennessee Ernie Ford), classic theatre (as one of\n\nThyestes’ sons, on a platter with Billy Mumy in his first stage role),\n\nand comedy (creating the legendary “Smart-Ass Cowboy Akimbo”).\n\nMy mother is pictured here doing makeup. My sister is about to\n\ndrown herself out of envy.\n\nMy Grandfather, Dick Abbey, who was my Stanislavski,\n\ncould hardly breathe unless he had a Pall Mall going.\n\n1970 : : :\n\n1970.01.02 • My own life, at last\n\nJanuary 2, 1970. I was sixteen years old, and this is an early and quite positive review that I received while on a long impromptu\n\nroad trip fearlessly embarked upon in the dead of winter.\n\nMy mother (“Let me tell you about my mother...”) had destroyed a large stack of my vinyl records, torn down all of my Hendrix\n\nposters, and destroyed whatever other dear things were at hand, all in response to my not being able to find a TV dinner hidden\n\nsomewhere in the dark corners of the freezer. (I was probably a little high at the time.)\n\nShe had ended her tirade with a flourish, screaming, “Either get rid of this shit, or GET OUT!”\n\nSo I walked out the door.\n\nLess than 48 hours later, I was in the snowy mountain backroads of Virginia, on my way to being arrested late the next afternoon\n\nin Chattanooga, on the Tennessee-Georgia border, where I would then spend eight days locked up in a juvenile detention center.\n\nAfter thus asserting myself, my life would become much more interesting.\n\n1971.00.00 • My own private Academy of the Performing Arts, Part 4\n\nDeep Summer, 1971. My first Performance Art piece. It was conceptual, okay?\n\n“Man and Stick.”\n\nI can’t remember how old I was, am I in Panama City? Something-something primitive. There’s a method here,\n\nbut too much sun, and a large Korean is teaching us to poke pin-holes in raw eggs and suck them out of the shell.\n\nI needed a break, I had come far, in a circuitous sort of meandering, conflagratory... configuration... Of a path.\n\nA winding path... Oh, to hell with you.\n\nMy Grandfather, Dick Abbey, who had always had a Pall Mall going, had died of a heart attack when I was twelve.\n\n1976 : : :\n\n1976.00.00 • Concourse, The Sextet\n\nOne day long, long ago in a land very close to here, Dave Blaetz\n\nwas walking along West 8th between Walnut and Chestnut Streets,\n\nand he heard a most horrible and appealing din coming down\n\nfrom a window or out through a door, and upon investigating,\n\nhe discovered Joe Scutella and me having at an apartment full\n\nof percussion and flutes and guitars and Fisher-Price™ musical\n\ntoys.

I'm not sure I would have gone willingly into '84 had I really understood\n\nwhat we were going to try to do. Over 70 productions in the span of 16 weeks? Impossible. Ridiculous. And then Ed introduced me\n\nto ’Pataphysics: “The science of imaginary solutions,” and we were off.\n\nThe intent was to gather all of the cutting-edge regional “outsider” talent that we could into a summer-long schedule of artistic\n\nactivity that would operate out of a single venue. What we ended up with was a core of seven resident groups (Time/Space Ltd,\n\nCalliope Dance Troupe, Erie Jazz Co-Op, In All Seriousness, APE, quaqua Productions, and Kangaroo Court) as well as a Guest\n\nDirector Theatre Series, a Harold Pinter Film festival, a New German Films festival, an Installation Art gallery series, theatre\n\nworkshops, a Benefit Concert Series, Multi-media events, lectures, and several special programs that all came leaping into our\n\nnets as we were putting the rest of it together.\n\nYes, it was incredible.

This has been in my former apartment window at the [now] ArtWorks building\n\nat 1505 State since 1985. It will be removed eventually and become part of the PACA permanent collection. This\n\nwas an ode to a suicidal winter when I spent a LOT of time on that roof wishing I was not anywhere. The bottom\n\nthird was a hard glistening line of red enamel (my blood) that dripped down to the image’s bottom. I've always\n\nloved this, as well as the fact that 1) it’s been there for 30 years (!), and 2) I'm not dead.\n\nHere’s the deal: Ed Myers and I had done \"The Alternative Arts Series\" in 1984. We started planning in January\n\n(See 1984.04.19). We did 80-some productions from June 2nd through early October. We did everything: tech work,\n\nproduction, PR, fund-raising, performances, copy-writing.... Skimming through the previous year you can see that\n\nthere were resident artists groups, performance art, a jazz series, a few film series, installation art, guest director\n\nseries, publishing ventures, break dancing, poetry readings...
