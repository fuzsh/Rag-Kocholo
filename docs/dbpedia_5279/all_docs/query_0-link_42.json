A rising young prosecuting attorney's plans are thrown into disarray as the result of a single careless act while distracted. A woman reluctantly faces her husband's infidelity. An envious insurance claims manager with family problems seeks revenge on a cheerful coworker, but has second thoughts. And an optimistic young cleaning woman awaits a miracle, only to have her faith shaken by a traumatic event. These ordinary people all find themselves asking the fundamental question philosophers have pondered throughout history: What is happiness, and how does one achieve it?\n\nThe lives of a handful of unrelated people are forever changed through chance encounters. They include Gene English, an insurance company manager whose unhappiness with life is exacerbated by a drug addicted and petty criminal son, Raymond; Troy, a young defense attorney with a hard line view of any improper activity, that is until he himself is the cause of the impropriety; Dr. Walker, a physics professor who is in an unsatisfying marriage; and Beatrice, a young woman just starting her adult life working as a house cleaner and who has always had a fateful but positive view of life. Each wonders about what their life would have been like if certain events didn't take place, and wonders about how to achieve true happiness.\n\n2,2001: A Space Odyssey,2001: A Space Odyssey,Stanley Kubrick,1968,,USA | UK,Adventure | Sci-Fi,8,141,\"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Stanley Kubrick Productions\",True,False,,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/trailers,\"\"\"2001\"\" is a story of evolution. Sometime in the distant past, someone or something nudged evolution by placing a monolith on Earth (presumably elsewhere throughout the universe as well). Evolution then enabled humankind to reach the moon's surface, where yet another monolith is found, one that signals the monolith placers that humankind has evolved that far. Now a race begins between computers (HAL) and human (Bowman) to reach the monolith placers. The winner will achieve the next step in evolution, whatever that may be.\n\nThis movie is concerned with intelligence as the division between animal and human, then asks a question: what is the next division? Technology is treated as irrelevant to the quest--literally serving as mere vehicles for the human crew and as a shell for the immature HAL entity. Story told as a montage of impressions, music, and impressive and careful attention to subliminal detail. A very influential film and still a class act, even after 25 years.\n\nWhen the world is ruled by apes, one particular group discovers a mysterious rectangular monolith near their home, which imparts upon them the knowledge of tool use, and enables them to evolve into people. A similar monolith is discovered on the moon, and it is determined to have come from an area near Jupiter. Astronaut Dave Bowman, along with four companions, sets off for Jupiter on a spaceship controlled by HAL 9000, a revolutionary computer system that is every bit humankind's equal--and perhaps its superior. When HAL endangers the crew's lives for the sake of the mission, Bowman will have to first overcome the computer, then travel to the birthplace of the monolith.\n\n3,(500) Days of Summer,500 Days of Summer,Marc Webb,2009,,USA,Comedy | Drama | Romance,10,95,\"Fox Searchlight Pictures, Dune Entertainment III, Watermark\",True,False,,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1022603,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1022603/trailers,\"After it looks as if she's left his life for good this time, Tom Hansen reflects back on the just over one year that he knew Summer Finn.

For Tom, it was love at first sight when she walked into the greeting card company where he worked, she the new administrative assistant. Soon, Tom knew that Summer was the woman with whom he wanted to spend the rest of his life. Although Summer did not believe in relationships or boyfriends - in her assertion, real life will always ultimately get in the way - Tom and Summer became more than just friends. Through the trials and tribulations of Tom and Summer's so-called relationship, Tom could always count on the advice of his two best friends, McKenzie and Paul. However, it is Tom's adolescent sister, Rachel, who is his voice of reason. After all is said and done, Tom is the one who ultimately has to make the choice to listen or not.\n\nHe's Tom, from New Jersey, working in L.A. writing greeting cards even through he's an architect by training. She's Summer, in from Michigan. Day one is her first day as an AA in Tom's office. We jump back and forth in time: by day 67, they've become an item when she decides to put aside the lovemaking and just be friends. Tom, a romantic who's sure Summer is the one for him, wallows in self pity. We go back to the early days and see the relationship begin. Summer tells him right away that she doesn't believe in love.
