        "text": "It was only in recent years that historians and cultural critics, and especially those of us who study human-animal relations throughout history, have begun to understand something Werner Herzog has been warning us about for the last half century: that “nature wants us dead.” In so saying he refers to the conflictive and asymmetrical nature of our relationship with nature, with the non-human world and in particular with animals. The aim of this paper is to propose a Herzogian reading of the animal world, one that reappraises the role of conflict in human-animal relations at the expense of the notion of consensus, or peaceful coexistence, so popular among researchers in this field. Fortunately, there are certain characters who, like Herzog, go against the grain.\n\n‘The Ethics of Realism may be too tame a title for the rambunctious scholarship this book contains. Lúcia Nagib has a sharp eye for what, through her lens, become stupefying motifs and moments within films that she just as sharply cuts out of the vast herd of movies. You can sense her pleasure at relaying to us the cinematic power she has found in cast-off ‘failures’ like I am Cuba or that she resuscitates in films we thought we knew , such as The400 Blows. Ultimately tying these to historical struggles of filmmakers and the societies they worked within, she does in fact make good on her title. This is a truly high-minded argument for cinema as the conscience of the past century. The films Nagib illuminates made and kept promises to the world they came from. This book honours the importance, not just the beauty of cinematic art.’ Dudley Andrew ‘Lúcia Nagib’s book World Cinema and the Ethics of Realism injects new vitality and energy into some important but familiar debates in film theory. In the first instance, her surprising selection of films challenges existing concepts of world cinema. More radically, however, these films have a unifying aesthetic out of which Nagib’s own approach to realism comes into focus. These are films that privilege rawness and physicality, that place extreme demands on performers and producers, and inescapably work with the reality of event as well as the recording function of the medium itself. Nagib’s grounding for the aesthetic of realism is based on an ethical commitment to the living, temporal, spatial and dramatic exchange between the camera as mechanism and the extreme event it is filming. Nagib has successfully turned the theoretical kaleidoscope, reconfiguring the crucial concept of realism, its significance for film theory, into new, exciting, sometimes shocking, patterns of thought and perception.’ Laura Mulvey World Cinema and the Ethics of Realism is a highly original study. Traditional views of cinematic realism usually draw on the so-called classical cinema and its allegiance to narrative mimesis, but Nagib challenges this, drawing instead on the filmmaker’s commitment to truth and to the film medium’s material bond with the real. Starting from the premise that world cinema’s creative peaks are governed by an ethics of realism, Nagib conducts comparative case studies picked from world new waves, such as the Japanese New Wave, the French nouvelle vague, the Cinema Novo, the New German Cinema, the Russo-Cuban Revolutionary Cinema, the Portuguese self-performing auteur and the Inuit Indigenous Cinema. In all cases, making films is making history, entailing change in the real life of casts and crews, and therefore producing, rather than reproducing, reality. Drawing upon Badiou and Rancière, World Cinema and the Ethics of Realism revisits and reformulates several fundamental concepts in film studies, such as illusionism, identification, apparatus, alienation effects, presentation and representation. Its groundbreaking scholarship takes film theory in a bold new direction.\n\nThis essay discusses Klaus Kinski's performance in Aguirre, the Wrath of God (Werner Herzog, 1972) and explores how, in this film, Kinski incorporates Edmund Burke's physiological sublime. My plan for uniting Aguirre with the thought of Edmund Burke is to discuss the role the body plays as a central aesthetic element. I will try and demonstrate that, in the strictest use of his bodily gestures, presence and physical features Kinksi reaches an overwhelming sensation of non-separation between his body, his mind and the landscape, transcending the idea of the individual self towards self-transcendence. I will further argue that, in this film, the physical components of the aesthetic experience are a pathway to the foundation of a new subjectivity, to which Kinski physical performance is fundamental. Through his performance Kinski establishes a close relationship with the landscape, creating an experience of exaltation, self-transcendence and disruption. I will start by giving a brief account of the burkean physiological sublime in order to relate it to Kinski's performance at three interrelated levels: 1) the idea of 'large form'; 2) the ideas of loss of boundaries, infinity, terror and the self; and 3) the appearance of the physiological sublime in its Dionysian formula. I will then specifically analyze Kinski physical style based in his 'spider' and 'spiral' movements and in a special sense of rhythm. Finally, I will conclude by highlighting some of the philosophical consequences of this displaying."
