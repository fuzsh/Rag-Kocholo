        "text": "What is Contact Anti-Microbial Film?\n\nAnd How Can You Use it to Protect Against Any Micro-Organisms?\n\nContact AMF is a translucent film that you can apply to virtually any surface to protect and prevent from micro-organisms like bacteria and viruses.\n\nIf you have lots of high-touch surfaces that need constant cleaning, Contact AMF is for you.\n\nIf you want to guarantee a safe, clean environment for your employees and customers, Contact AMF is for you.\n\nContact AMF incorporates the properties of copper within the film to resist growth of micro-organisms on its surface for long lasting performance. Copper has been used for its antimicrobial properties for centuries, in a vast array of uses from plumbing to healthcare. The process involves the release of copper ions (electrically charged particles) when microbes are introduced to the surface from either airborne sources or direct contact. The copper ions prevent cell respiration and disrupt the cell membrane, thus inhibiting their growth."
