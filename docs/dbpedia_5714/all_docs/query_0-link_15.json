Whether you are new to the printing business or wish to adapt your DTF printing to expand your business, taking a closer look at these printers is worth your time.\n\nDTF Modified printers typically come with multiple colored ink tanks. These tanks allow the printers the convenience to operate using CMYK settings. The DTF printer ink is specifically designed for use with this process.\n\nAdditionally, the DTF process eliminated the use of rollers that previously caused the page to slide. This rectifies the appearance of any linings on your white layer prints. So, if you are looking for a printing technology with flawless final designs that are an exact depiction of the image you wanted on the fabric, DTF is the choice.\n\nYou can get premium-quality printing with DTF Printers and the specialty ink they use.
