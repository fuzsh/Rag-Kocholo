        "text": "What Are the Main Causes of Conjunctivitis?\n\nConjunctivitis can be caused by a virus, bacteria or by allergies. Bacterial and viral conjunctivitis are easily spread from person to person. Allergic conjunctivitis is not contagious.\n\nViral conjunctivitis\n\nViral conjunctivitis is the most common type of conjunctivitis. This type of pink eye is very contagious and often spreads through schools and other crowded places. It usually causes burning, red eyes with a watery discharge. Viral conjunctivitis is usually caused by the same virus that causes runny nose and sore throat in people with the common cold.\n\nBacterial conjunctivitis\n\nBacterial conjunctivitis is also very contagious. An infection from bacteria causes this form of pink eye. With bacterial conjunctivitis, you have sore, red eyes with a lot of sticky pus in the eye. Some bacterial infections, however, may cause little or no discharge. Sometimes the bacteria that cause pink eye are the same that cause strep throat.\n\nAllergic conjunctivitis\n\nAllergic conjunctivitis is a type of pink eye that comes from an allergic reaction to pollen, animals, cigarette smoke, pool chlorine, car fumes or something else in the environment. It is not contagious. Allergic pink eye makes your eyes very itchy, red and watery, and the eyelids may get puffy.\n\nHow Do You Get Conjunctivitis?\n\nBacterial and viral conjunctivitis can be quite contagious. The most common ways to get the contagious form of pink eye include:\n\nDirect contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, usually through hand-to-eye contact.\n\nSpread of the infection from bacteria living in the person's own nose and sinuses.\n\nNot cleaning contact lenses properly. Using poorly fitting contact lenses or decorative contacts are risks as well.\n\nChildren are the people most likely to get pink eye from bacteria or viruses. This is because they are in close contact with so many others in school or day care centers. Also, they don't practice good hygiene.\n\nHow Do I Know If I'm Getting Pink Eye?\n\nYour pink eye symptoms may include:\n\nthe feeling that something is in your eye, or a gritty sensation in your eye\n\nred eyes\n\nburning eyes\n\nitchy eyes\n\npainful eyes (this is usually with the bacterial form)\n\nwatery eyes\n\npuffy eyelids\n\nblurry or hazy vision\n\nbeing extra sensitive to light\n\nlots of mucus, pus, or thick yellow discharge from your eye. There can be so much that your eyelashes stick together.\n\nWhat Is the Best Treatment for Conjunctivitis?\n\nTreating your pink eye usually depends on the type of conjunctivitis you have.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for conjunctivitis caused by most viruses. Your body fights the virus on its own. Placing a cool, wet washcloth on your eyes can help make them feel more comfortable.\n\nIf your pink eye is caused by a bacterial infection, your ophthalmologist may prescribe antibiotic eye drops, depending on how severe your symptoms are. Antibiotics do not treat an infection caused by a virus or by allergy.\n\nIf your conjunctivitis is due to allergies, you might be told to use certain eye drops to help with the itchiness and puffiness.\n\nSometimes conjunctivitis can be caused by a chemical or other substance in your eye. In this case, rinse the eye free of the substance. You might be told to use certain eye drops or ointment for the eyes.\n\nConjunctivitis usually goes away on its own within 1â€“2 weeks. If your symptoms last longer than that, you should see your ophthalmologist. He or she can make sure you don't have a more serious eye problem.\n\nHow Do You Stop Conjunctivitis from Spreading?\n\nViral and bacterial conjunctivitis can spread from person to person. Follow these tips so you will not infect other people or re-infect yourself."
