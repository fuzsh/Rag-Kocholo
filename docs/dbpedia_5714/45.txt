The City of Miami's Office of Film & Entertainment is a one-stop shop for permitting, special events, government liaison, production information and referral sources. Our mission is to provide service and assistance to all film, television, music, commercial production and still photography businesses to promote industry expansion and economic prosperity.

NOTE: Due to the high volume of applications our office has been receiving, in order to serve you better we are asking that all Film Permit applications with street closures be submitted at least 7 business days prior to the shoot, and all other Film Permit applications be submitted at least 3 business days prior to the shoot. Contact filmoffice@miamigov.com with any questions.
