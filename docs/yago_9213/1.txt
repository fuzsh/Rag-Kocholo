Emilio (El Indio) Fernandez, one of the most important figures in the Mexican film industry, died Wednesday of a heart attack at his Mexico City home. He was 82 years old. Mr. Fernandez, who was born on March 26, 1904, in the northern state of Coahuila, began his film career playing bit parts and supporting roles in Hollywood, later achieving some prominence as an actor in Mexico.

But he became well-known as a director during 1940's and 1950's. He directed 42 films and won international prizes for 16 of them. He was known for films with strong, nationalistic characteristics that often explored the plight of the Mexican Indian. His nickname, El Indio, was inspired by his mother's Indian heritage.

His film ''Maria Candelaria'' won the first Grand Prix for best film at the 1943 Cannes Film Festival. Other celebrated films were ''Rio Escondido'' (''Hidden River'') and ''Enamorada'' (''In Love''), which was also remade in English in 1950 under the title ''The Torch,'' starring Paulette Goddard and Gilbert Roland.

He also directed the 1946 film adaptation of John Steinbeck's novel ''The Pearl'' in Spanish, which was released in English the following year with the actors' voices dubbed.

A stocky man with a big, drooping mustache, Mr. Fernandez returned to acting when his career as a director waned in the 1950's, and he re-emerged as a director only occasionally. Among the dozens of films he acted in were John Huston's ''Under the Volcano,'' in which he played a bartender at a local brothel, and Sam Peckinpah's ''Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia.''

He is survived by his wife, the actress Columba Dominguez.
