        "text": "My research interests are mostly the biological and clinical aspects of chronic schizophrenia. Iâ€™m the Cambridge Psychosis Centre and Clozapine Clinic Lead for the local MH Trust (Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust). We study all aspects of the treatment resistant schizophrenia including psychosis but mostly the non-psychotic symptoms: poor motivation, decreased emotional life, cognition and others. In our studies, we use different methods and techniques, including blood biomarkers, clinical epidemiology, computational neuroscience, as well as clinical trials with new interventions (both pharmacological and non-pharmacological). Our main lines of research are: 1) the link between metabolic abnormalities and schizophrenia, 2) the understanding of negative symptoms and, 3) uncommon antipsychotic-induced side effects (i.e. compulsive behaviour). Additionally, I am deputy editor for the British Journal of Psychiatry and Spanish Journal of Psychiatry and Mental Health."
