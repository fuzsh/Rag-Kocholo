After Mexico, the United States, Spain, and Cuba, it was during his time in Egypt that the chef discovered the flavours of oriental cuisine, inspiring him to delve into the richness of Moroccan gastronomy.\n\n\"My cuisine is bold and authentic. I like to preserve the natural essence of produce while enhancing the taste with Latin American flavours,\" shared Emilio Fernandez.\n\nMediterranean Fish and Seafood Cuisine at Bleu Restaurant\n\nA true ode to Casablanca’s coastline, Bleu restaurant offers an idyllic setting with a panoramic view over the Atlantic Ocean. Discover the intriguing world of the Hotel's kitchens while savouring the flavours of the “pop-up charcoal kitchen” menu. Developed around the restaurant's custom-built grill and influenced by global flavours, the menu celebrates fresh produce, meats and seafood sourced locally and from around the world.
