        "text": "Emilio Fernandez was a rich playboy billionaire that appeared in the novel Hitman: Damnation.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEmilio Fernandez was a rich billionaire who got his money through illegal means. During the events of Damnation in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, 47's employer Roget gave him the name \"Michael Brant\" for easier access around the yacht. Emilio normally would reside in Nassau however was mainly on his yacht. 47's only way of getting on the Yacht was an invitation Emilio gave to every rich person/tourist that resided in Ocho Rios. 47 stated he truly didn't care about him and his main focus was Hector Corado.\n\nWhen 47 arrived to his yacht it was clear that this was just another ordinary party by Emilio. He had a live band near the bow playing Bob Marley songs as well as other songs relating to reggae and calypso tunes. Emilio's yacht had a dance floor, a few open bars that were located at specific stations around the deck and drugs were free for everyone to use. 47 would eventually make his way to a tall dining station and find out that Roget's intel was correct.\n\nEmilio hired multiple armed guards positioned at key point areas of the ship. As 47 noticed this he scanned the crowd for Hector but only found Emilio sitting and chatting with a bunch of younger women. 47 decided to make his way towards Emilio and greet himself. Once doing so they both introduce themselves. 47 introduces himself as \"Michael Brant\" a worker who owns a water company Luxembourg. They'd discuss with each other for a bit before saying farewell. Emilio reminds 47 that the women aboard the ship were willing to \"help\" him.\n\nLater in the novel, 47 kills an armed guard and takes his Glock 17. 47 makes his way to a bar and sits near a table where Corado was located. 47 makes the bold decision to impersonate Emilio through a napkin. 47 specifically writes in Spanish \"JUST LEARNED POLICE ARRIVING IN 10 MINUTES TO ARREST YOU! PLEASE LEAVE AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE, GET TO CUBAN AIRSPACE IN MINUTES, AND THEY WILL NEVER KNOW YOU WERE HERE. I AM SORRY, MY FRIEND. SEE YOU SOON. EMILIO.\" Eventually, Hector finds the napkin, reads it and very calmly tells his girlfriend/2 armed guards to to to the Bell 206 helicopter.\n\nAfter 47 assassinates Hector, the girl and the guards (all with the same Glock 17 by the way) the party would continue as normal. Emilio was mentioned by 47 stating that if he missed Hector then it was too bad. Later (in Chapter 5) the FBI was investigating Emilio and took him in. The Jamaican news was all over this subject. The states sent a really good FBI agent to interrogate Emilio as well.\n\nTrivia[]"
