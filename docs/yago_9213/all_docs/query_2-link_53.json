        "text": "Nazarín\n\nFriday, January 11, 2008, 7:30 p.m., and Sunday, March 9, 2008, 1:00 p.m.\n\nBased on the novel by Benito Peréz Galdós (1958, Luis Buñuel, 35mm, 94 min., in Spanish with English subtitles)\n\nNazarín was one of Buñuel's most deeply ambivalent films. Pope John Paul II included it in his list of the 45 best films of all time, while film critic Leonard Maltin deemed it \"one of Buñuel's harshest critiques of Christianity.\" Set in the Mexico of Porfirio Diaz, the film centers on Don Nazario, a \"Quixote of the priesthood,\" whose obsessive devotion to Christian ideals results in calamity for himself and those around him. Eventually defrocked, he sets out on a journey through the countryside with a local prostitute and her sex-starved sister. While Nazario is adamant in his desire to \"accept suffering with resignation,\" Buñuel leaves viewers in doubt as to whether the priest should be seen as a saintly fool or a kind of spiritual masochist. The film's ambiguity is heightened by Figuero's fluid camera, which hovers gently but precariously around the characters, often seeming to anticipate their actions and even their thoughts.\n\nEnamorada (A Woman in Love)\n\nSaturday, January 12, 2008, 7:30 p.m., and Sunday, March 9, 2008, 3:30 p.m.\n\n(Mexico, 1946, Emilio Fernández, 35mm, 99 min., in Spanish with English subtitles)\n\nA fusion of tearjerker, screwball comedy, and national foundation myth, Enamorada transposes Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew to a small Puebla town during the anti-clerical Juarez Revolution. In the film, the liberal General Reyes (Pedro Armendáriz) falls for Beatriz (Maria Félix), the hotheaded daughter of the town's wealthiest reactionary. Though the film is concerned with religion, Figueroa's camera especially worships the ravishing Félix—whether she's clasping a mammoth pistol, smoking a long black cigarillo, or exploding a firecracker under the general's horse. Meanwhile, the love-struck Reyes grows increasingly more gentle and teary-eyed. Critics have suggested that Fernández's true aim for the film was a mythic reformulation of national gender archetypes, a vision of a new Mexico where virile women fight for justice alongside heroically sensitive men.\n\nThe Fugitive\n\nSaturday, January 12, 2008, 4:00 p.m.\n\nBased on the novel The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene\n\n(1947, John Ford, 35mm, 104 min., in English)\n\nDirector John Ford took Graham Greene's greatest novel, The Power and the Glory, and created a poetic art film, one he claimed was his favorite. Under the Production Code, it became necessary to soften Greene's pious though flawed \"whiskey priest\" (played in the film by Henry Fonda), so that pride in martyrdom was his greatest foible. The film caused a rift between Ford and screenwriter Nichols, who claimed that Ford tossed the script out somewhere in Cuernevaca. While important traces of Nichols's dialogue remained, the film's most resonant feature is Figueroa's photography. Greatly undervalued, the film is a quiet, measured, and beautiful look at a harsh episode in Mexican history seen through the eyes of two masterful visual storytellers."
