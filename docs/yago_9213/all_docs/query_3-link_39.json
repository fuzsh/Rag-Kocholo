        "text": "What’s this place all about?\n\nThe former home of Mexican actor/screenwriter/director Emilio Fernandez, now a museum, is set on a tree-lined street in Coyoacán.\n\nHow's the permanent collection?\n\nAs you walk around the house, you'll see Fernandez's possessions still as he placed them; visitors get a unique window into the filmmaker's life during the 1940s and '50s. The home itself, made of volcanic stone, is a well-preserved example of Mexican architecture during that era.\n\nAnd the exhibits?\n\nI highly recommend visiting during Day of the Dead. When I went, the whole house was decorated with marigolds (the Day of the Dead flower), altars, and skeletons of famous actors and friends of Fernandez.\n\nWhat did you make of the crowd?\n\nThis museum attracts many locals and some Mexican visitors. There were few foreign tourists during my visit, since the museum still flies relatively under the radar.\n\nOn the practical tip, how were facilities?\n\nSince the house is quite old, there is no elevator and the staircases are quite narrow; those with accessibility limitations might want to skip.\n\nAny guided tours worth trying?\n\nGuided tours offer deeper insights into the life of Emilio Fernandez and the Golden Age of Mexican cinema in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nGift shop: obligatory, inspiring—or skip it?\n\nThere is no gift shop, but when I visited, there was a small market outside selling handicrafts from around Mexico.\n\nIs the café worth a stop, or should we just plan on going elsewhere?\n\nThere is also no café. A few market stalls sold food on the day I visited. You can find several nice cafés within walking distance from the museum."
