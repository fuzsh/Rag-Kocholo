        "text": "Can facial hair destroy a movie? I’m enjoying the look of Sidney Furie’s THE APPALOOSA, but every time it cuts to a closeup of star Marlon Brando, the cheesecloth beard surround kills it. Fuzzy felt moustache, too.\n\nI’ve cheated and skipped ahead: at some point, Brando shaves. The relief is tremendous. Garbo talks! Brando shaves! Having a star you can’t look upon without wincing or laughing is a disadvantage for any film. One should be able to see past phony whiskers — as with any very visible fault in a film, one should be able to say, “OK, we know this aspect is bad, but what else is on offer?”\n\nWhat’s on offer is Russell Metty shooting a Sid Furie film — the baroque compositions of TOUCH OF EVIL are back — Metty proves himself as skilled a channeller of the Furie style as he was of the Wellesian.\n\nYou either enjoy this malarkey or you don’t.\n\nBrando’s performance seems decent. You might expect any time he caught sight of his reflection he’d be thrown off by the aura of falsity radiating from his chin. The fright wig is bad too. That’s quite a large proportion of the main actor’s head rendered immediately bogus. To be called upon to project truth from within a sort of furry doughnut is too much to ask even if the Greatest Actor Alive (Then). I’m reminded of Coral Brown’s line about the fur hat she had on for a part: “I feel I’m as though looking out of a yak’s arsehole.”\n\nIt’s a Universal Picture! Furie is hemmed in by studio personnel just as Brando is by face-fungus. Not just Pacific Title providing their standard yellow font, and Metty providing delirious compositions, but editor Ted Kent who goes back to BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. In one of the early beard scenes, Kent, Metty and Furie put their heads together and come up with this:\n\nA whiplash-inducing set of angle-changes: Emilio Fernández swaggers in in shot one, and is still moving when we cut to him rock-steady in shot two, a classic Furie occlusion-job where the dirty part of the “dirty single” is allowed to eat up half the frame, to deliberately uncomfortable effect. Then we ignore any nagging thoughts about eye-lines and jump to shot three, in which El Indio is just a nose and mouth. It appears that the rule of jump-cuts can be stretched to apply to different kinds of odd discontinuity (the rue of jump-cuts is that one jump-cut will bother the viewer, unless another one follows it fairly quickly, at which point it becomes accepted as a DEVICE). Here, the mismatch on movement between shots one and two makes the line-cross on shot three somehow acceptable. It says to the viewer, “We’re doing this. Deal with it.”\n\nI can deal with it. But Brando’s beard?\n\nI’m keen to see if Kent is going to treat us to a James Whale type straight-down-the-line cut at some point.\n\nTHE APPALOOSA stars Jor-El; Aimee Thanatogenous; Mapache; Dr. Marcello Bassi; 1st Man; Mama Montana; Victoriano Huerta; Mrs. Martini; Thug #1; and Flub-a-Dub\n\nAll good things… David Melville rounds of his alphabet of the golden age of Mexican melodrama with a Fever Dream Double Feature, and begins a week of guest postings here on Shadowplay. But fear not: his next series will start soon!\n\nCINE DORADO\n\nThe Golden Age of Mexican Melodrama\n\nAnd Everything Ends in Z\n\nEyes speak louder than words – and you know it. ~ Don Macario in Maclovia\n\nIt must have been Parker Tyler – or, at least, his fictional alter ego Myra Breckinridge – who wrote that the proper sphere of movies was not Art but Myth. If that is true, then no film-maker was ever more ‘mythic’ than Emilio ‘El Indio’ Fernández. His 1948 film Maclovia is set on a remote island called Janitzio, afloat on an impossibly tranquil lake. Its denizens are native fisher folk, members of “that Indian race that holds all that is good in Mexico.” (It’s the local schoolteacher who says this, but the sentiments are clearly the director’s own.) The world of Maclovia is less idyllic than Edenic, a fantasy realm as arcane and idealised as the valley of Shangri-La.\n\nThe film’s subject is “the ancient and eternal love of a man and a woman.” Or, at any rate, Mexico’s leading macho heart-throb Pedro Armendáriz and Mexico’s reigning glamour icon María Félix. The thought of either star playing an impoverished and illiterate peasant should be ludicrous and logically, of course, it is. Yet the casting is oddly right in the hyperbolic context of this film. Although it was doubtless shot on real locations, the setting of Maclovia feels akin to such studio-built dreamscapes as the Himalayan convent in Black Narcissus (1947) or the South Seas isle in The Saga of Anatahan (1953).\n\nPerhaps it’s the nets that do it. The white, billowing nets of the fishermen are draped exotically about the island like the veils in a Dietrich/von Sternberg movie. María is, inevitably, photographed through them at every opportunity – her sculpted face framed exquisitely in a striped shawl, her eyes caked with mascara like those of any self-respecting virgin in a small village. Out on the lake, a hundred nets rise in unison from the fishermen’s canoes – with a choreographed precision that Busby Berkley might envy. Armendáriz (cast as the poorest and most downtrodden of the lot) gazes upwards at the cliff where María hovers, posed like the statue of Christ above Rio de Janeiro. Reaching down to the limpid surface of the lake, he plucks a water-lily in her honour. Later, when she rejects him, he casts it despairingly into the mud.\n\nBut why does María (here known as Maclovia) reject the man she loves? Her father, Don Macario, is the leading citizen of the village. He will not hear of his daughter marrying a poor man – one so impoverished that he does not even own his own canoe “A man is not a real man unless he has a canoe and a knife,” the father helpfully intones. No man, it seems, is good enough for Maclovia. In the hands of a subversive and de-mythifying director like Luis Buñuel, her widowed father’s wildly possessive adoration of her might form the basis for a very different film indeed. Fernández, of course, would never countenance anything so unseemly. Perversity does not dwell in Janitzio but invades it from outside – in the form of a lecherous gringo officer whose lust for our heroine tilts Maclovia towards its violent climax.\n\nAll this is yet to come, of course. Early on in the film, Don Macario forbids his daughter and her sweetheart to speak to or even look at each other. Desperate for a way to make contact, Armendáriz begs the village schoolmaster to teach him to write. A few months of toil among the five-year-olds and soon he’s penning letters to Maclovia that read like this: “The other day, I saw your shadow pass close by. I felt it grow and take root inside my heart. Suddenly I knew why God attached shadows to our bodies. So I could find some way to look at you.” I guess he’s what they call a star pupil.\n\nSure enough, Maclovia goes to the schoolmaster in turn, so she can learn to read the letters her lover writes. The couple’s forbidden love and the obstacles that come with it push them, inadvertently, towards literacy and progress. In this way – like so much of Mexico’s left-wing nationalist cinema – Maclovia manages at once to exalt traditional peasant values and to champion those modernising forces that will lead, inevitably, to their dissolution. At the historical moment this movie depicts (Maclovia is set in 1914) it is vital for Mexico to be an agrarian Third World nation – a place where traditional values hold sway – but also to emerge as a 20th century economic powerhouse – just like those big bad colonial powers that used to exploit it. What none of these movies ever make clear is how any country can possibly do both.\n\nRather than grapple with complexities of this sort, the wily teacher sits Maclovia down and reads the letter aloud. We see her react in a montage of close-ups, each one a fresh angle on María’s exquisite face. It’s not long before her suitor borrows money and buys himself an impressively phallic canoe. The officer, in a jealous rage, pulls out his gun and shoots the canoe full of holes. (Clearly, the competition was not in his favour.) With that, Armendáriz pulls out his giant curved knife (the other must-have item for a “real man”) and stabs the officer – who survives and has him condemned to 24 years in prison. He’s willing to free him, of course, if only Maclovia will be his. But the law of the island says that no native woman must ever defile herself with an outsider. If she does, both she and the offending man must die…\n\nThe climax takes place, conveniently enough, on the traditional Night of the Dead – a gruesomely photogenic montage of blazing candles and leering skulls. Once the villagers hear what Maclovia may have got up to with that gringo, the whole place erupts in a fury. Hundreds of crazed peasants carrying torches come storming through the streets, all ready to pelt the sinners with stones. The film, at this point, threatens to turn into some ghastly melange of Suddenly, Last Summer and Triumph of the Will. Not that it ever goes quite that far. The army shows up just in time to quell the riot and guarantee a (wholly unconvincing) happy ending. You may be wondering, also, just how many people live on this island. Previously, we got the impression that Janitzio was a small rural community. Yet the mob that shows up to kill María might easily populate a fair-sized district of Mexico City.\n\nFinally, though, what matters in Maclovia are not the petty minutiae of plot or logic. It’s the sheer mythic splendour of Fernández at his most dizzyingly overripe, a well-nigh operatic whirlpool of the passionate and the absurd. María Félix, strangely enough, gives one of her least flamboyant performances in this film. Far from the rampaging diva mode of Doña Diabla, she has moments here that border dangerously on restraint. Don’t worry, though, it’s not catching. Maclovia is as fervent and florid as any Mexican movie ever made. Typical of its time and its place and its genre…but still a film that cries out to be watched today.\n\nDavid Melville"
