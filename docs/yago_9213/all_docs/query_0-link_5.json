        "text": "\"The Torch,\" which arrived Saturday at the Globe, is a carbon copy—with English dialogue—of the Mexican \"Enamorada,\" shown here last December. The new film also was produced in Mexico under the direction of Emilio Fernandez and has Pedro Armendariz playing the lead role as a revolutionary general in the era of Pancho Villa. The only significant change is the substitution of Paulette Goddard as the tempestuous, aristocratic lady, who was represented in the original version by Maria Felix.Commenting on Miss Felix's performance, we wrote at the time: \"Miss Felix has just claim to her reputation of being Mexico's most fiery actress. She is a wonderfully expressive performer. * * *\" Unfortunately the same enthusiasm cannot be applied to Miss Goddard's acting. Her tantrums lack spontaneity and lively animal vigor. Her whole manner is cheap and coarse and throws the character of a lady of breeding completely off-key.Since Gabriel Figueroa also photographed \"The Torch\" it has, like \"Enamorada,\" some expertly composed outdoor scenic effects. However, Señor Figueroa's camera is not always kind to Miss Goddard's features and the result is that she seldom looks like the fresh beauty that she is supposed to be.If nothing else \"The Torch\" appears to demonstrate that a second chance at making a movie is no sure guarantee that improvement will result. For Director (and co-author of the screen play) Fernandez has not been able to quicken the pace of his drama. \"The Torch\" moves cumbersomely in relating how a proud revolutionary leader becomes smitten by the daughter of a wealthy haciendado in a little town occupied by his tattered army. Pedro Armendariz plays the general with authority.However, the force of his performance rises and wanes with the unsteady course which the script follows in relating the humiliations he endures before Maria Dolores realizes on the eve of her wedding that she loves the general and flees to his side as the Federal army forces his troops into retreat.Gilbert Roland is another new cast addition and does good work in the role of a village priest who was a classmate of the general before he left the seminary. These two contrasting benefactors of the poor have several effective scenes together. But the accent is on romance in \"The Torch\" and on that level it is quite boring. More action would have helped because the film does pick up when the horses are galloping and the sound of cannon shakes the screen.\n\nTHE TORCH, screen play by Inigo de Martino Noriega and Emillo Fernandez; directed by Senor Fernandez; a Bert Granet production made in Mexico; an Eagle Lion Films release.
