        "text": "SURREALIST FELLOW TRAVELER Antonin Artaud visited Mexico in 1936, reporting back that “Mexico has its own science and its own culture.” Also, as befits the world’s leading producer of Spanish-language films, Mexico has its own movie genres—among them the noirish musical tabloid dramas set in dance halls or brothels and known as cabareteras.\n\nPerhaps the greatest of these, Emilio “El Indio” Fernández’s 1951 Víctimas del Pecado (Victims of Sin) should really be titled Fuerzas de la Naturaleza (Forces of Nature). A tumultuous product of Mexican cinema’s Golden Age, the movie is a perfect storm, the confluence of three huge talents: It was directed and cowritten by the nation’s most macho filmmaker, given to boasting “There is only one Mexico, the one I invented”; it was shot by Mexico’s greatest cinematographer, Gabriel Figueroa (an even tougher Communist than his mentor Sergei Eisenstein); and it stars filmdom’s ultimate rumbera, a thirty-year-old bolt of lightning, the Havana-born, sensationally uninhibited dancer Ninón Sevilla.\n\nAlthough best known for pictorial big-sky melodramas starring divas Dolores Del Rio (the Cannes award–winning María Candelaria, 1942) and María Félix (Río Escondido, 1947), Fernández and Figueroa proved equally adept in the nocturnal realm of smoky dives and neon-illuminated back alleys. Their 1949 Salón México is a classic cabaretera, detailing the self-effacing Stella Dallas–like martyrdom of a dime-a-dance fichera (Marga López), putting her younger sister through a classy boarding school.\n\nLópez is an actress of taste. Sevilla, who erupted into stardom with the outlandish Aventurera (1950) and its 1951 follow-up, Sensualidad, is the fichera to end all ficheras. The so-called Golden Venus of the Golden Age, Sevilla spurned Hollywood while inspiring the young cineastes of faraway Paris. “From her inflamed look to her fiery mouth, everything is heightened in Ninón (her forehead, her lashes, her nose, her upper lip, her throat, her voice),” a besotted François Truffaut wrote in Cahiers du Cinéma under the pseudonym Robert Lachenay.\n\nScarcely the depraved hussy of Sensualidad (a rumbera version of The Blue Angel), Sevilla appears in Víctimas as a typically self-sacrificing super-maternal Fernández heroine (albeit feistier than most and strikingly progressive in her class and gender solidarity) and a most untypical madonna. The featured dancer at Club Changoo, she flings away her career, even turning to prostitution, to support the infant that a dissolute colleague has furtively abandoned, quite literally, in the trash.\n\nNarrative is secondary to gesture: The essence of Sevilla’s films is found in her dancing. As a performer, she leads with her upthrust chin and plays directly to the camera. Said to have been classically trained, she modified the conga and merengue to suit her own kinetic, hand-fluttering, eye-rolling, back-bending, fanny-wagging, self-caressing, sublimely narcissistic technique—a hopping, elbows-out, hip-shake shimmy somewhere between the traditional West African Sinte and the Pony dance popularized post-Twist by Chubby Checker.\n\nWhile all her numbers are showstoppers, Víctimas’s most remarkable dance scene has Sevilla fill in (42nd Street style) for a temperamental dancer who has quit her gig at the funky Maquina Loca (Crazy Machine), a club atmospherically located beside the railroad tracks and thus allowing Figueroa a chance to riff out on smoke and steam. The performance is pure percussion. Sevilla is egged on by a battery of Afro-Cuban congueros, one of whom she picks to be her partner in a terpsichorean face-off, at once competitive and complementary, where they mirror each other’s movements without touching. (That they are an interracial couple is notable as well.)\n\nVíctimas is saturated with showbiz. A high-voltage screaming match is underscored by a cheerful chachachá. For no particular reason, Fernández choreographs an acrobatic barroom brawl worthy of his sometime drinking buddy John Ford. The film’s nominal hero (Tito Junco) strolls through the zona roja where Sevilla plies her sordid trade, trailed by a personal mariachi band. Even villainous Rodolfo Acosta (repeating his Salón México role as a zoot-suited pimp) gets a chance to credibly cut a rug, although not with Sevilla. (They do team up for a knockdown drag-out fight though.)\n\nCrucially, Víctimas features mambo king Pérez Prado’s band and vocals by the celebrated Afro-Cuban singer-pianist Rita Montaner (who plays Sevilla’s mentor at Club Changoo and performs her own version of the santería chant “Babalu”). As steeped in Mexicanidad as it is, Víctimas should really be considered a Mexican-Cuban coproduction.\n\nP.S. Two of these exist. The relatively staid Mulata (1954), which features Sevilla (her skin darkened, blond hair concealed beneath a curly black wig) opposite another Ford buddy, Pedro Armendáriz; and the deliriously trashy 1957 color production Yambaó (aka Cry of the Bewitched, aka Young and Evil). Here, Sevilla plays a wild-child santería sorceress costumed like Raquel Welch in One Million B.C. and vamping like Hedy Lamarr’s Tondelayo.\n\nInsanely exoticized, overflowing with shameful stereotypes (yet sprinkled with authentic Afro-Cuban elements), and fueled by the star’s mad conviction, Yambaó is a movie made for Jack Smith (who did once list it on the proposed syllabus for a never-taught course in cinema appreciation). It’s too blithely offensive for revival but, like Mulata, findable on YouTube.\n\nVictims of Sin plays New York’s Film Forum October 6–12 in a new 4K restoration.\n\nJ. Hoberman is writing a book about underground movies and New York in the 1960s."
