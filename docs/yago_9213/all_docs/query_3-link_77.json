        "text": "My name’s Emilio Fernández Fernández and I work as a Contracts Manager in the social housing project “Social Housing PPP Programme – Bundle Two” that OHLA is carrying out in Ireland. My responsibilities include my collaboration with the design department for the fulfillment of the different aspects of the conditions planned in the contract, as well as in the completion of the Review Design Data, which consists of a review and development of the design in its different stages for the implementation of the same. It’s a milestone in the development of the project, Design&Build, which evaluates and verifies the suitability of the project in terms of its requirements in the contract, and identifies problems before committing and if necessary reprioritizing it. The final design review, if successful, will trigger the successful launch of the project.\n\nParticipating in this initiative is a professional challenge as it is the first residential project I’ve been involved in since I joined OHLA in 1998. In all this time I’ve had the opportunity to develop my career in such outstanding projects as the Sidra Hospital in Qatar, the Haramain high-speed line in Saudi Arabia, the Msheireb metro station, also in Qatar, and the Follo Line project in Norway. All of them stand out for their strong impact on social welfare because they are based on environmental, economic and social criteria and indicators that tend to improve the quality of life and productivity of people, the preservation of ecological balance, environmental protection and the use of natural resources.\n\nThe best part of my job is the opportunity to see different methodologies, both professionally and personally in the different countries where I developed my profession. Also, the human team I’m part of and of which I emphasize how easy it is to integrate regardless of the linguistic and cultural barriers intrinsic to each nationality"
