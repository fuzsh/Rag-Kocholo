He is best known as the lead singer and guitarist of the duo the White Stripes, but has also had success in other bands and as a solo artist. White has enjoyed consistent critical and popular success and is widely credited as one of the key artists in the garage rock revival of the 2000s. He has won 12 Grammy Awards, and all three of his solo albums have reached number one on the Billboard charts. Rolling Stone ranked him number 70 on its 2010 list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". David Fricke's 2011 list ranked him at number 17.\n\nAfter moonlighting in several underground Detroit bands as a drummer, White founded the White Stripes with fellow Detroit native and then-wife Meg White in 1997. Their 2001 breakthrough album, White Blood Cells, brought them international fame with the hit single and accompanying music video \"Fell in Love with a Girl\". This recognition provided White opportunities to collaborate with famous artists, including Loretta Lynn and Bob Dylan. In 2005, White founded The Raconteurs with Brendan Benson, and in 2009 founded The Dead Weather with Alison Mosshart of The Kills. In 2008, he recorded \"Another Way to Die\" along with Alicia Keys, making them the only duet to perform a Bond song. On April 24, 2012, White released his debut solo album, Blunderbuss. His second studio album, Lazaretto, was released on June 10, 2014. His third studio album, Boarding House Reach, was released on March 23, 2018. All three records received wide commercial and critical success.\n\nWhite is a board member of the Library of Congress' National Recording Preservation Foundation. His record label and studio Third Man Records releases vinyl recordings of his own work as well as that of other artists and local school children.Lazaretto holds the record for most first-week vinyl sales since 1991. White has an extensive collection of guitars and other instruments and has a preference for vintage items that often have connections to famous blues artists. He is a vocal advocate for analog technology and recording techniques.\n\nWhite values his privacy and has been known to create misdirection about his personal life. He and Meg White married in 1996, but divorced in 2000 before the height of the band's fame. They then began calling themselves siblings. He was later married to model and singer Karen Elson from 2005 to 2013; they have a son and daughter. He currently resides in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nEarly life\n\nJohn Anthony Gillis was born in Detroit, Michigan, on July 9, 1975, the youngest of ten children of Teresa and Gorman M. Gillis. His mother's family was Polish, while his father was Scottish-Canadian. He was raised a Catholic, and his father and mother both worked for the Archdiocese of Detroit as the Building Maintenance Superintendent and secretary in the Cardinal's office, respectively. Gillis became an altar boy, which landed him an uncredited role in the 1987 movie The Rosary Murders, filmed mainly at Holy Redeemer parish in southwest Detroit. He attended Cass Technical High School in Detroit.\n\nGillis' early musical influences were his older brothers, who were in a band together called Catalyst, and he learned to play the instruments they abandoned; he began playing the drums in the first grade after finding a kit in the attic. As a child, he was a fan of classical music, but in elementary school, he began listening to the Doors, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin. As a \"shorthaired with braces\", Gillis began listening to the blues and 1960s rock that would influence him in the White Stripes, with Son House and Blind Willie McTell being among his favorite blues guitarists. He has said in interviews that Son House's \"Grinnin' in Your Face\" is his favorite song of all time. As a drummer, his heroes include Gene Krupa, Stewart Copeland, and Crow Smith from Flat Duo Jets.\n\nIn 2005, on 60 Minutes, he told Mike Wallace that his life could have turned out differently. \"I'd got accepted to a seminary in Wisconsin, and I was gonna become a priest, but at the last second I thought, 'I'll just go to public school.' I had just gotten a new amplifier in my bedroom, and I didn't think I was allowed to take it with me.\" Instead, he got accepted into the famed Cass Technical High School as a business major, and played the drums and trombone in the band. At 15, he began a three-year upholstery apprenticeship with a family friend, Brian Muldoon. He credits Muldoon with exposing him to punk music as they worked together in the shop. Muldoon goaded his young apprentice into forming a band: \"He played drums\", Gillis thought. \"Well I guess I'll play guitar then.\" The two recorded an album, Makers of High Grade Suites, as the Upholsterers.\n\nAs a senior in high school, he met Megan White at the Memphis Smoke restaurant where she worked, and they frequented the coffee shops, local music venues, and record stores of the area. After a courtship, they got married on September 21, 1996. In a reversal of tradition, he legally took her last name.\n\nAfter completing his apprenticeship, he started a one-man business of his own, Third Man Upholstery. The slogan of his business was \"Your Furniture's Not Dead\" and the color scheme was yellow and blackâincluding a yellow van, a yellow-and-black uniform, and a yellow clipboard. Although Third Man Upholstery never lacked business, he claims it was unprofitable due to his complacency about money and his business practices that were perceived as unprofessional, including making bills out in crayon and writing poetry inside the furniture.\n\nPersonal life\n\nWhite is protective of his privacy and gives few details of his family life, even going as far as to disseminate false information. He states that he does not consider his personal life relevant to his art, saying \"It's the same thing as asking Michelangelo, 'What kind of shoes do you wear?' ... In the end, it doesn't really matter ... the only thing that's going to be left is our records and photos.\"\n\nHis collection of esoterica include Lead Belly's New York City arrest record, James Brown's Georgia driver's license from the 1980s, and a copy of the first Superman comic from June 1938. For $300,000 in January 2015, an online bidder won an auction for Elvis Presley's first recording everâan acetate of the two cover songs: \"My Happiness\" and \"That's When Your Heartaches Begin\". In its edition of March 6, 2015, Billboard magazine announced the buyer had been White. The vinyl record was recorded at SUN Records in Memphis, Tennessee in the summer of 1953 when Presley was 18 years old.\n\nRaised in Detroit, White is a fan of the Detroit Tigers baseball team.\n\nRelationships\n\nDrummer Meg White, Jack's former bandmate and ex-wife\n\nJack and Meg married on September 21, 1996 and divorced on March 24, 2000. After the White Stripes broke up, he mentions he \"almost never talks to Meg\", adding that she has been solitary. In 2003, he had a brief relationship with actress RenÃ©e Zellweger, whom he met during the filming of Cold Mountain. That summer, the couple were in a car accident in which White broke his left index finger and was forced to reschedule much of the summer tour. He posted the footage of his finger surgery on the web for fans. White and Zellweger's breakup became public in December 2004.\n\nWhite met British model Karen Elson when she appeared in the White Stripes' music video for \"Blue Orchid\". The video's director, Floria Sigismondi, noted \"you sensed an energy between them\". They married on June 1, 2005, in Manaus, Brazil. The wedding took place in a canoe on the Amazon River and was officiated by a shaman. A Roman Catholic priest later convalidated their marriage. Manager Ian Montone was the best man and Meg White was the maid of honor. Official wedding announcements stated that \"it was the first marriage\" for both. In 2006, the couple had a daughter, Scarlett Teresa. Their second child, son Henry Lee, was born in 2007.\n\nThe family resided in Brentwood, a suburb south of Nashville, where Elson managed a vintage clothing store called Venus & Mars. Elson provided vocals on White's first solo record. The couple announced their intention to divorce in June 2011, throwing \"a positive swing bang humdinger\" party to commemorate the split. On July 22, 2013, a Nashville judge barred White from having \"any contact with Karen Elson whatsoever except as it relates to parenting time with the parties' minor children\". A counter-motion was filed on August 2, 2013, stating that \"The reason for filing this response is that Mr. White does not want to be portrayed as something he is not, violent toward his wife and children.\" The divorce was finalized on November 26, 2013. Elson later recanted the charges, attributing the \"aggressive\" proceedings to her divorce attorneys, and saying \"those who gain of a marriage ending helped to create a downward spiral at my most vulnerable.\" White agreed, saying, \"When shitty lawyers are in a situation like divorce, their goal is to villainize.\" The former couple reportedly remain on good terms.\n\nPolitics\n\nIn October 2016, upon learning that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had used the White Stripes song \"Seven Nation Army\" in video campaign materials, White denounced the presidential candidate and began selling shirts reading \"Icky Trump\"âa play on the White Stripes song \"Icky Thump\"âthrough the Third Man Records website. He publicly endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries and performed a six-song set at a Sanders event at Cass Technical High School on October 27, 2019. At the rally, White stated that he believes that \"Sanders is telling the truth, and I really do trust him\". He was drawn in by Sanders' view that the Electoral College should be abolished, also stating at the rally that \"I have this silly notion that the person who gets the most votes should be elected\" and \" is the reason we're in the mess we're in now\".\n\n'Eccentricity'\n\nWhite has been called \"eccentric\". He is known for creating mythology around his endeavors; examples include his claim that the Stripes began on Bastille Day, that he and Meg are the two youngest of ten siblings, and that Third Man Records used to be a candy factory. These assertions came into question or were disproven, such as when, in 2002, the Detroit Free Press produced copies of both a marriage license and divorce certificate for him and Meg, confirming their history as a married couple. Neither addresses the truth officially, and Jack continues to refer to Meg as his sister in interviews, including in the documentary Under Great White Northern Lights, filmed in 2007. In a 2005 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Jack alluded to this open secret, implying that it was intended to keep the focus on the music rather than the couple's relationship:\n\nWhen you see a band that is two pieces, husband and wife, boyfriend and girlfriend, you think, 'Oh, I see ... ' When they're brother and sister, you go, 'Oh, that's interesting.' You care more about the music, not the relationshipâwhether they're trying to save their relationship by being in a band.\n\nIt became hypnotic. This was the minimum amount of staples I could put to hold this fabric down. The number three exemplifies the almost iconic, mysterious perfection that cannot be obtained ... To this day, I still think about it all the time.\n\n-- White, on how seeing three staples on an upholstery piece triggered his affinity for the number three.\n\nHe has an attachment to the number three, stemming from seeing three staples in the back of a Vladimir Kagan couch he helped to upholster as an apprentice. His business ventures frequently feature \"three\" in the title and he typically appends \"III\" to the end of his name. During the White Stripes 2005 tour in the UK, White began referring to himself as \"Three Quid\"â\"quid\" being British slang for pound sterling.\n\nHe maintains an aesthetic that he says challenges whether people will believe he is \"real\". He frequently color-codes his endeavors, such as the aforementioned Third Man Upholstery and the White Stripes, as well as Third Man Records, which is completely outfitted in yellow, black, red, and blue . As a taxidermy enthusiastâthat correlates to his work as an upholstererâhe decorates his studio in preserved animals, including a peacock, giraffe, and Himalayan goat.\n\nControversy\n\nOn December 13, 2003, White was involved in an altercation with Jason Stollsteimer, lead singer of the Von Bondies, at the Magic Stick, a Detroit club. White was charged with misdemeanor aggravated assault. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of assault and battery, was fined $750 , and was sentenced to take anger management classes.\n\nI so love your heart that burns\n\nThat in your people's body yearns\n\nTo perpetuate, and permeate, the lonely dream that does encapsulate,\n\nYour spirit, that God insulates,\n\nWith courageous dream's concern\n\nâExcerpt from \"Courageous Dream's Concern\", as published in the Detroit Free Press\n\nWhite has repeatedly referenced conflicts that erupted between him and fellow artists in Detroit's underground music scene after the White Stripes gained international success. In a 2006 interview with the Associated Press, he said that he eventually left Detroit because, \"he could not take the negativity anymore.\" However, in an effort to clarify his feelings towards the city of Detroit itself, he wrote and released a poem called \"Courageous Dream's Concern\". In it, he expresses his affection for his hometown.\n\nDuring their 2013 divorce proceedings, Elson entered into evidence an e-mail White had sent her that included disparaging remarks about the Black Keys. When asked about the email in a 2014 Rolling Stone magazine interview, White stood by the remarks saying, \"I'll hear TV commercials where the music's ripping off sounds of mine, to the point I think it's me. Half the time, it's the Black Keys.\" He later apologized for the comments. However, in September 2015, Black Keys drummer Patrick Carney posted a series of tweets alleging that White tried to fight him in a bar. White denied the claim in a statement to the online magazine Pitchfork, saying that Carney should talk to him directly, and not on the internet. The following day, Carney posted a tweet saying, \"Talked to jack for an hour he's cool. All good.\" White tweeted on the Third Man Twitter account, \"From one musician to another, you have my respect Patrick Carney.\"\n\nOn February 1, 2015, the University of Oklahoma's newspaper OU Daily ran a story regarding White's show of February 2 at McCasland Field House that included the publication of White's tour rider. The rider, especially the guacamole recipe it included and White's ban of bananas backstage, received significant media coverage. It was later reported that in response to the rider's publication White's booking agency, William Morris Endeavor Entertainment, had banned its acts from playing shows at the University of Oklahoma. On February 15, White released an open letter addressed to \"journalists and other people looking for drama or a diva\" in which he referred to the guacamole recipe as his tour manager's \"inside joke with local promoters\" and \"just something to break up the boredom\" and the ban of bananas being alluded to food allergies of an unnamed tour member, while criticizing journalists who wrote about the rider as \"out of their element\". In the same letter he forgave OU Daily for publishing the story and reaffirmed his desire to perform in Oklahoma.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nWhite has provided financial support to institutions in his hometown of Detroit. In 2009, White donated almost $170,000 towards the renovation of the baseball diamond in southwest Detroit's Clark Park. The Detroit Masonic Temple was nearly foreclosed on in 2013 after it was revealed that owners owed $142,000 in back taxes. In June 2013, it was revealed that White had footed the entire bill. To thank him for the donation, the temple has decided to rename its second largest theater the Jack White Theater.\n\nThe National Recording Preservation Foundation received an inaugural gift of $200,000 from White to use toward restoring and preserving deteriorating sound recordings on media such as reel-to-reel tape and old cylinders. The foundation's director, Eric J. Schwartz said the donation demonstrated a \"commitment by a really busy songwriter and performer donating both his time on the board, and money to preserve our national song recording heritage\". White also serves on the foundation's board.\n\nIn July 2016, White joined Nashville's 45-member Gender Equality Council.\n\nOn May 3, 2019, Wayne State University of Detroit, Michigan awarded White with an honorary doctor of humane letters degree \"for his dedication to Detroit and significant contributions to the arts as one of the most prolific and renowned artists of the past two decades\".\n\nncG1vNJzZmion6W7oq7LnmWcp51kwrStjpqpraGjqcBwfpNtaGllmpawrHnWoaCtnV%2BXtrCz0ZqnobFdlrulecWamq2r\n\nShare!"
