        "text": "Nashville-based singer Karen Elson is nervous about the release of her debut solo album, The Ghost Who Walks. Yes, she might be married to Jack White, has modelled for Marc Jacobs and be the mother of two young children under five but she wants the world to judge her as an individual and not by any famous association.\n\n\"I wanted to make a record since I was 22,\" Elson says from her Nashville home.\n\n\"I felt I got to a point in my life where it was impossible for me to make a record because I had convinced myself that being a model and being Jack White's wife meant no one was going to take me seriously.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old English model, who spent eight years in New York before marrying White in 2005, wrote the album while her children were sleeping. She would lock herself in her bedroom and made sure White was not around to disturb the process. She describes her journey as insular and rewarding.\n\n\"Back when I only had modelling I would work a lot but would have days to myself and sit with my guitar in the East Village. But I didn't finish writing the songs I started,\" says Elson, who has also modelled for Louis Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent.\n\n\"I was a single girl living in New York and had all kinds of freedom on my hands but then having children really snapped me back down to earth. You have so much more appreciation for your free time.\"\n\nThe pale, leggy redhead says she named the album after a nickname she endured growing up in Oldham, Greater Manchester. \"I wasn't offended by that name, I actually related to it,\" she says of being referred to as the ghost.\n\nWhile living in New York, Elson established a cabaret troupe, the Citizens Band, and her love of theatrical drama comes through on her debut. There are also influences such as Mazzy Star and Nick Cave, where some of her songs lean towards the dreamy (The Birds They Circle), macabre (The Ghost Who Walks) and sad (Stolen Roses), as she spreads her message through breathy vocal exploration.\n\n\"It has been a long road one way or another to get my confidence up,\" says Elson, who met her husband while starring in the video for the White Stripes' Blue Orchid.\n\n\"I just have to believe in myself. I was the only person getting in the way of me releasing music,\" she says. \"Ultimately that was probably for good reason because what I have written has come from that and it's intensely personal. There is 10 years of life experience put in this record.\"\n\nWhite produced the album and plays drums, but according to Elson he did not control the process.\n\n\"I have been spoilt being in the studio with Jack because his way of recording is so dynamic,\" she says. \"There is no room to be too perfect. Jack wants your flaws because he realises the quality of the song is based on the performance not the studio patch-ups.\"\n\nThe Ghost Who Walks is out now."
