        "text": "Jack White has carved out a very unique career ever since The White Stripes released their self-titled debut album in 1999.\n\n“Fell In Love With A Girl” from 2001’s ‘White Blood Cells,’ was The White Stripes’ one-minute fifty-second-long breakthrough, and it was a definite preview of things to come: simple, almost primitive, but insanely catchy rock and roll that cared nothing for trends. But few could have predicted that the White Stripes would become arena headliners, or that Jack would have a discography that includes two other bands, solo albums and collaborations with everyone from Elton John to Nas, the Insane Clown Posse to the Muppets.\n\nIncluded with those collaborations is “Don’t Hurt Yourself,” White’s acclaimed partnership with Beyoncé on her 2016 album Lemonade. “Don’t Hurt Yourself” went on to be nominated for Best Rock Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. Despite the song ending up losing out to David Bowie’s “Blackstar,” the two musicians have continued to keep in touch.\n\nShortly after Beyoncé released her 2024 album Cowboy Carter, White shared that he received flowers from the dynamic musician. White shared photos of the flowers via Instagram. The attached card on the flowers read, “Jack, I hope you are well. I just wanted you to know how much you inspired me on this record. Sending you my love, Beyoncé.”\n\nWhite captioned the post, “What a sweet gesture to receive here in Nashville this morning from the talented and gracious @beyonce celebrating her new ‘Cowboy Carter’ album. Much love and respect to you Madam, and thank you kindly. Keep making beautiful and powerful music, nobody sings like you.”\n\nMany hope White and Beyoncé will collaborate again on the third act of her current album trilogy, which is heavily rumored to be a rock album.\n\nIf that collaboration happens, we will undoubtedly find room to include it in our list below. In honor of Jack’s obsession with the number three, we thought we’d give you a list of his (roughly) 333 best minutes of music, including the White Stripes, the Raconteurs, the Dead Weather, his solo stuff, artists he’s produced, and some of his collaborations.\n\nSign me up for the 94.7 WCSX email newsletter!\n\nStay connected to all things Classic Rock, join the WCSX Workforce- it’s free and you can win prizes, concert tickets and VIP experiences.\n\nFirst Name *\n\nLast Name\n\nEmail *\n\nBy clicking \"Subscribe\" I agree to the website's terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
