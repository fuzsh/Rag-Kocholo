The invitation said that the party - to be held in Nashville, where they live, later tonight - was to \"celebrate together this anniversary and the making and breaking of the sacred union of marriage with our best friends and animals\". It also stated: \"The party will include dancing, photos, memories, and drinks with alcohol in them. This is for close personal friends and family, so please no plus ones or dead beats\".\n\nIn addition to the party invite, Elson and White issued a statement to confirm the divorce.\n\n\"We remain dear and trusted friends and co-parents to our wonderful children Scarlett and Henry Lee. We feel so fortunate for the time we have shared and the time we will continue to spend both separately and together watching our children grow.\"\n\nYOU SHOULD SEE: Who dumped Angelina for Karen Elson...\n\nYOU SHOULD SEE: Karen on the cover of Vogue..."
