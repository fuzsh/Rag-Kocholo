        "text": "British model and musician Karen Elson has revealed that she feels fortunate to have Jack White as an ex-husband.\n\nKaren was married to the White Stripes musician Jack White from 2005 to 2013 and the pair have daughter Scarlett, 11 and 10-year-old son Henry together.\n\nDespite their split four years ago Karen has said she still gets on well with Jack and calls him an ‘incredible father’.\n\n‘As ex-husbands go, I’m really lucky in that sense. As the kids get older, I realise how fortunate I am to have him as a co-parent.\n\n‘I really give massive props to Jack in that sense.’\n\nAlthough the pair aren’t together anymore and haven’t been for several years, the 38-year-old admits that it can still be hard to come to terms with their divorce as she holds a ‘special place’ in her heart for the actor.\n\nWhich comes as a slightly confusing sentiment seeing as Elson once filed for a restraining order against her ex, with the Nashville City Paper citing her reasons as ‘fearing for her and the children’s safety’ as a result of the singer’s alleged harassment via text and emails.\n\nBut the two must have sorted out their differences as she says the separation has got easier as time’s gone on, thanks to a ‘tight core of women friends’, and now her main priority is for their children to feel secure.\n\n‘We’re in each other’s lives with regard to our kids but we also have separate lives.\n\n‘Our kids know they are loved by their dad. They know they are loved by their mum. While it might not be ideal, it works.’\n\nMORE : Singer Tove Lo has sex with a puppet called Mango in bizarre new video"
