The wedding took place in a canoe on the Amazon River in Manaus, Brazil, and was officiated by a shaman. \n\nWhite first met Elson on the set of the music video for The White Stripes' song \"Blue Orchid\" in March 2005. Elson was cast in the video, and their professional encounter ultimately blossomed into a romantic relationship, culminating in their marriage later that year.\n\nThe couple parted ways in June 2011. While they did not publicly detail specific reasons for their separation, they have consistently emphasised that their split was amicable. White and Elson announced their divorce in a rather unique manner by hosting a \"divorce party\" the same year as their sixth wedding anniversary. The legal finalisation of their divorce occurred in 2013.\n\nSlides:\n1. Jack White and Karen Elson (pic: British Vogue).\n2-4. White and Elson by Annie Leibovitz.\n5. Elson in \"Blue Orchid\".\n6.

Elson at Paste Studios in New York, April 2017, performing \"Distant Shore\", the last track of her second album, 𝘋𝘰𝘶𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦𝘴.\n9. 𝘋𝘰𝘶𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦𝘴 often referred to as a \"divorce album\" because it was written and recorded during a period of significant personal change for Elson, including her separation from White. The album explores themes of heartbreak, loss, and self discovery, which are commonly associated with the emotional aftermath of a divorce. \n\n#JackWhiteKarenElson\n#RocknrollSocmedtelling\".",
