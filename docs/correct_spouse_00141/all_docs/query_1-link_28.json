        "text": "Looks like the divorce party's over.\n\nModel Karen Elson has obtained a temporary restraining order against ex-husband Jack White, claiming the former White Stripes frontman has a violent temper and has been harassing her about their pending divorce settlement, according to the The City Paper in Nashville.\n\nWhite was reportedly served with the order on July 22 and is barred, per a court order, from \"any contact with wife whatsoever except as it relates to parenting time with the parties' minor children,\" pending a hearing scheduled for Aug. 29.\n\nPHOTOS: Celebrity breakups\n\n\"This is a private matter. I thank you for respecting my family's privacy and will be making no further comment,\" Elson said in a statement to E! News. White's rep had no comment.\n\n\"Wife fears for her and the children's safety as a result of this harassment,\" the filing states, per The City Paper. Elson's complaint alleges that White has contacted his ex's legal camp \"in an inappropriate and aggressive manner\" and made derogatory remarks about her to their business manager.\n\n\"This pattern of husband's bullying wife into submission was a contributing factor in the demise of their marriage,\" the filing continues.\n\nU.S. & World\n\nThe British-born Elson met White when she appeared in the White Stripes' \"Blue Orchid\" video. They tied the knot in 2005 in Brazil and separated in 2011, heralding their split by throwing a big bash in honor of \"their 6th anniversary and their upcoming divorce.\"\n\n\"Please help us celebrate together this anniversary of the making and breaking of the sacred union of marriage with our best friends and animals,\" the invitation encouraged.\n\nElson officially filed for divorce last year. They have two kids together, 7-year-old Scarlett and 5 1/2-year-old Henry.\n\n\"I'm not extending this anymore,\" White allegedly wrote to Elson in an email included in her filing, referring to their divorce proceedings. \"And we're not getting lawyers involved to rip me off.\"\n\n--Additional reporting by Holly Passalaqua"
