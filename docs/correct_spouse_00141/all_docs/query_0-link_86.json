They have two children together.\n\nThe rocker was previously married to his White Stripes bandmate, Meg White, from 1996 to 2000. She served as the maid of honor at her ex's marriage to Elson.\n\nAfter a long hiatus, the band announced in February that it was \"officially ending\" after 14 years."
