        "text": "Kathryn Ricke August 2nd, 2013 - 10:19 AM\n\nActress/model Karen Elson has recently filed a restraining order against ex-husband Jack White, eccentric guitarist/vocalist previously of The White Stripes fame. The order was filed on July 22, 2013, with Elson claiming that White has demonstrated angry outbursts regarding the custody battle of their two children, Scarlett and Henry Lee.\n\nNews of the restraining order has come as a bit of a shock. In 2011, when the couple announced their divorce, they did so by throwing a party to celebrate the “anniversary of the making and breaking of the sacred union of marriage,” according to the invitations.\n\nWhen asked about their future as a divorced couple and the effect on their children, the couple reportedly made this statement,\n\nWe remain dear and trusted friends and co-parents to our wonderful children Scarlett and Henry Lee. We feel so fortunate for the time we have shared and the time we will continue to spend both separately and together watching our children grow.\n\nNow, however, two years later the dynamic is drastically different. As Pitchfork has reported, Elson fears for the safety of herself and her children, claiming that White is an unfit father with anger issues. Further reports indicate that on two recent occasions, White has reacted irately to his children being in the presence of rival musicians whom he believes “ripped off” his music.\n\nElson filed the restraining order claiming that White’s outbursts and manipulation tactics were harassment. The order was served on July 22 and stipulates that White is only to contact his ex-wife through e-mail and that he is not allowed to have any contact with her except when the two are sharing time with their children."
