        "text": "Background\n\nJack White is a household name in rock music and is accredited as one of the rock conceptualists of this century. Jack is known for his role as singer and guitarist of the singing duo band the White Stripes. The singer has a successful career both in bands and a solo career, having won 12 Grammy Awards. Jack White was born John Anthony White on July 9, 1975, in Detroit, Michigan. His Zodiac sign is Cancer, and his ethnicity is half Polish and Scottish. White was raised as a Christian and a member of the Catholic church. His parents worked for the Archdiocese of Detroit; White was raised as an altar boy. White’s musical career at an early age was influenced by his older brothers, who were members of a band and the singer used their abandoned instruments to learn to play. White has had a successful musical career, launching three musical bands, winning 12 Grammy Awards, and owning a record label Third Man Records.\n\nWhite landed his first public gig at 19 as drummer for the Goober and the Peas. The singer learned how to perform on stage and tour in the band. White frequented the Memphis Smoke restaurant when in senior high school at Cass Technical High School, where she met Megan White. At 22, the duo began the White Stripes, and fans hailed the band as “the future of rock and roll.” The two presented themselves as siblings in public despite being married. Their debut album was released in 1999, becoming number 38 on the Billboard’Independentnt Album Charts. The release of the album “ White Blood Cells” made the band one of the most praised in the US and above. The singer divorced Megan in 2002; however, they continued to perform together in the band till its dissolution in 2011. The White Stripes released a total of seven successful albums. The singer, in collaboration with Brendah Benson, formed the band The Raconteurs in 2005, where the debut album “Broken Boy Soldiers” was nominated for Grammy Awards” as the “Best Rock Album.” In 2009, White formed the group The Dead Weather despite the existence of the other two bands.\n\nWhite has also enjoyed massive success as a solo artist. He has worked on solo projects and collaborated with other singers. The singer collaborated with Alicia Keys on the song ‘Another Way to Dies,’ which was the theme song for the film “Quantum of Solace” (2008). The singer has also featured in various films, such as “It Might Get Aloud” (2009). The singer, as a solo artist, has released several albums and singles that have been a success, like “Van Lear Rose” (2004), “Love Interruption” (2012), and “Lazaretto” (2014). He owns various musical instruments, although he is a huge lover of vintage guitars. White is known to be private about his family, going to the extent of providing false information. It comes as no surprise the singer has had multiple relationships, just like any other celebrity. He is a father of two children. White has had several controversies, including engaging in an altercation with a fellow artist Jason Stollsteimer in 2003. The singer does philanthropic work like supporting institutions in Detroit."
