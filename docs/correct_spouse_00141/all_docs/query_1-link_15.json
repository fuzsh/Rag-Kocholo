        "text": "Photo: Jo McCaughey\n\nUpdate: TMZ has posted emails sent from White to Elson. Among other things, they confirm that the musician whose children White does not want his children associating with is Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys. He writes, \"That's a possible twelve fucking years I'm going to have to be sitting in kids chairs next to that asshole with other people trying to lump us in together. He gets yet another free reign to follow me around and copy me and push himself into my world.\"\n\nModel and musician Karen Elson has filed a restraining order against her ex-husband, Jack White, Nashville City Paper reports. White and Elson have been fighting over custody of their two children, daughter Scarlett and son Henry Lee, and Elson alleges that White has been harassing her.\n\nAccording to City Paper, the restraining order states, \"Wife fears for her and the children’s safety as a result of this harassment.\" It also says, \"This pattern of husband’s bullying wife into submission was a contributing factor in the demise of their marriage.\"\n\nThe order was served on July 22. White is permitted to communicate with Elson only over email and is not allowed to have \"any contact with wife whatsoever except as it relates to parenting time with the parties' minor children.\"\n\nCity Paper describes two incidents of alleged harassment:\n\nWhite wanted Elson to contact their kids’ private school in an effort to get their kids out of a class in which another entertainer’s child was present. White said that he feels that entertainer 'ripped off' his music, the order said. In another incident, White berated Elson when she attended the wedding of a rival musician. Again, he was upset because this entertainer also 'ripped off' his music, according to the order. The musician was unnamed in the court filing.\n\nAccording to City Paper, the next hearing in the custody case is on August 29. Elson's lawyer told City Paper that \"both sides have been working to settle the dispute privately.\""
