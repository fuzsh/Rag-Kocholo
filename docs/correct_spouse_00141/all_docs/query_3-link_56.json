America is the only country in the developed world which this kind of barbaric slaughter of children continuously happens. Why? Because guns legally get in the hands of people who are evil or mentally unstable. I agree we need better mental health resources too but it’s for all for nothing without meaningful gun reform. Facts don’t lie. I am so disappointed in all our leaders right now. They are cowards. They’ll keep dodging the issue and give thoughts and prayers but none of them have the courage to take a stand. We are raising a generation of children filled with anxiety and fear because we live in a country were violence and bloodshed are the norm and school’s are no longer safe havens and to make things worse, those with the ability to do something tend to do nothing.\".",
