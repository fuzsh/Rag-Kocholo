        "text": "The Red Queen.\n\nMore in demand than ever, flame-haired model Karen Elson -- once the gawky outsider -- is now fashion royalty. She met Hadley Freeman to discuss life, cabaret, and her rock-star husband.\n\nKaren Elson makes quite an entrance -- just not the kind of entrance one might expect. There is none of the glacial imperiousness one sees in photographs of her, none of the Forties film-star poise, no aura of supreme confidence. Instead, she runs into the hotel dining room for breakfast, her predictably long, predictably thin, white-as-milk legs nearly clattering out from beneath her, all apologies for being a shocking five minutes late. As she rushes over to the table, her oversized wooden heels wobbling a little and her eyes surprisingly anxious, she looks still unsure of just what she is supposed to do with all the physicality at her disposal.\n\nA late alarm and jet lag are blamed for her tardiness before she finally admits she was out late last night with her husband, Jack White, singer and songwriter of The White Stripes and The Raconteurs. Three years after they married in a canoe on the Amazon, she still cannot say his name without a naughty grin. \"I felt a bit guilty, as I was really tired, but I was trying so hard not to be a downer at [last night's] dinner. So I was making myself drink wine to convince myself that I felt great,\" she begins. A slight American accent cuts through her chewy Mancunian consonants, the result of years spent living between here and the States. \"With wine there's always a brief moment when I get really talkative, and then I collapse, and I think that's what happened last night... Ooh, is this ours?\" she asks suddenly, reaching for the bread basket.\n\nElson has a warm, lovely face, beautiful but not untouchable, which makes an interesting contrast with her nervous manner. She often asks after a long answer to a question, \"Does that sound right?\" and adds occasionally, \"Did that make sense?\" Sometimes she gives away a little bit more than she perhaps intended. It's not insecurity exactly, although there is some residue of that. It's more like the anxious tic of someone not yet wholly confident in their voice outside of their usual context, like a child who has been encouraged to join the adults at the dinner table.\n\nBut that may be changing. Since 2005 Elson has been a member of the Citizens Band, a cabaret troupe with a revolving cast of members that has included Maggie Gyllenhaal, Zooey Deschanel and Melissa Auf der Maur. They hold sporadic nights themed on unglamorous-sounding topics, such as healthcare and the environment, in evenings that the New York Times recently described as \"politically pointed [with] a glitzy thrill\". It is extravagant and fabulous, occasionally involving more than 30 people, with Elson on vocals. According to one ecstatic magazine review, her husky voice \"consistently knocks people on their tuches\". Together the band sing songs that they've written as collaborations, or perform Noel Coward and Kurt Weill covers, or revamp modern songs by bands like Radiohead to make them sound, to use Elson's description, \"more old-timey\". It's all played out against extravagant sets that evoke Cabaret as re-imagined by Baz Luhrmann, and starring a red-headed Dita Von Teese. Elson describes it as \"funny, political and cheeky. It's a way of making people politically conscious without hectoring them.\"\n\nBut aside from giving her a singing and political platform, she says the real joy of the cabaret is working with the other people, particularly the women. \"It is far and away the most fun I've had for years,\" she says, wrapping her long arms around her shoulders protectively. \"It lets me be around such interesting women and we work collaboratively and have these brainstorming meetings where we write songs. And it's mine, you know?\" she finishes, with the happy smile of someone who has found a place where her voice is truly heard.\n\nThis sense of belonging is clearly a big deal. Elson has always been in the unusual position of having become famous for looking odd in an industry predicated on physical beauty. Italian Vogue dubbed her \"Le Freak\" when she made her debut on its cover in 1997, and the nickname became as much a part of her image as her red hair and translucent eyebrows. It was, one imagines, a case of being careful what you wish for: on the one hand, at the age of 18 she was an international model; on the other, she was being told, every day, in every country, that she looked \"ugly\". She uses the words \"mutant\", \"alien\" and \"weird\" (three times) to describe herself, repeating other people's descriptions. Her tone is mirthful but her repetition is notable and understandable -- who wouldn't remember being described by Karl Lagerfeld as a combination of \"someone from the Middle Ages and a mutant from another planet\" when they were 18?\n\n\"Oh, it was all so corny at the time,\" she says blithely when asked about the nicknames. And a little bit hurtful? \"Yeah!\" she bursts out. \"The idea of being Le Freak was really depressing! I was like, my whole life I've been called weird and now these peole are calling me it, too!\" She then stops herself and makes what looks like a concerted effort -- her tone gets very even, her back a little straighter -- to be calmer. She also switches the argument into the second person, detaching herself from it. \"At the same time, you don't want to bite the hand that feeds you, because you're getting attention for being an individual, but it was hard to be called the freak of fashion.\" Jack, she smiles, recently found an old article about her in which she was described as just that. \"And he was like, 'I can't believe they actually used to call you this! God, to be called the freak of the fashion world -- how weird must they have thought you were?'\" she laughs, a tiny bit too heartily.\n\nBut if being known as a freak was itself unusual, Elson now is in an even more unusual position: that of an internationally acknowledged supermodel. She is now as \"in\" as it is possible to get in the modelling world. \"Oh, definitely,\" agrees Giles Deacon. \"She's a real supermodel. Whenever she touches down in London to appear in my show there's a real sigh of relief -- 'Karen's arrived! Everything's going to be OK!\"\n\n\"Her outsider status has now made her an insider -- that is the irony,\" says Russell Marsh, who cast Elson in one of her first shows. Elson herself seems a little stunned by the shift in her status referring to it four times over breakfast, each time with a sense of wonder and then a kind of bolshy pride: \"I know fashion now and I know what I'm doing,\" she declares stoutly at one point. At the same time she still stresses that she likes to be around \"slightly outsider people\". She and White now live in Nashville which, she says, is full of \"outsiders who have forged their own path\". Shucking off the identity of a lifetime must be difficult.\n\nSteven Meisel, who photographed Elson for her debut fashion story, says simply, \"She's tough but elegant. Watching her strike poses is like watching a set of shapes recombining.\" This sums up another funny contradiction: in front of the camera Elson is womanly grace personified; away from it there is a girlish awkwardness to her. \"That giggly, gawky, human Karen I know is so utterly different from the characters I photograph her as,\" says photographer Tim Walker. This might go some way to explaining the second most frequently used description of Elson after \"grounded\": that she is a \"blank canvas\". \"She is the ultimate blank canvas -- she can go from sophisticated to wacky,\" agrees make-up artist Val Garland.\n\nYet this somewhat contradicts Elson's own summation of her appeal. During our conversation, she repeatedly claims that when she started out, the first thing people noticed about her was her \"personality\". \"Some people in the fashion industry didn't know what to do with a girl with personality,\" she explains. But it takes a pliant kind of personality to be able to subsume itself and become many different personas, from an English rose to a punk to a Japanese manga girl to a classic film star. \"I'm good at pretending to be someone else,\" she says at one point. Russell Marsh says such acting ability comes from Elson's self-confidence, which is a credible point, until I put it to Elson and ask if she ever considered acting. She immediately winces slightly and says, \"Model-slash-anything is a pretty painful idea, isn't it?\" It's a rhetorical question I know she's posed before in interviews, with regard to her singing with the Citizens Band.\n\nElson was born and raised in Oldham with two older half-brothers and a twin sister, Kate, who now works as a documentary-maker in New York. Her dad was a joiner and her mum a former dinner lady. Elson describes her as \"a proper Northern mum\", the kind who still fusses over her 29-year-old daughter's hair and tells her when she reckons she's putting on airs. \"When you come from where we do,\" says her close friend Erin O'Connor, who grew up in Walsall, \"the people back home definitely make sure you stay down-to-earth.\"\n\nElson describes hers as a happy childhood, but the description occasionally appears at odds with some of the details. When she was seven her parents divorced; Elson reacted by refusing food to the extent that she had to be hospitalised for 10 days. \"I was always a funny eater,\" she says breezily, and switches again between the personal first and detached second person. \"I think it was a way of reacting to the situation by trying to control it, because your parents are splitting up and you don't know how to deal with it.\" Although Elson insistently describes not eating as \"a control thing\" -- widening the theme of the conversation to include her conflicting feelings about food in her twenties -- not eating is also a very good way of letting people know you're unhappy without having to verbalise it, I suggest. \"Honestly, I think every woman at some point in her life has been insecure about how she looks,\" she replies -- which is undoubtedly true, but doesn't quite answer the question.\n\nAs a child, Elson was quiet and shy, and became even more so when she was teased at school about her looks. Hearing models complain about how they were mocked at school for being too tall, too thin, too damn pretty never really inspires much sympathy. But it's easy to see that Elson must have looked pretty extraordinary as a child: fiery hair against icy white skin, eyebrows that fade into nothing, and long limbs, then still knobbly from growth spurts.\n\nWhen Karen No-Mates -- as she laughingly refers to herself -- was 15 and stuck at home in the holidays, her mother took her to a modelling agency. \"It wasn't that she was bing a stage mum or anything,\" Elson says. \"She was doing it for my confidence, and fortunately it all worked out -- as it could have gone seriously wrong.\" She was immediately taken on and began commuting to London in the holidays (\"In Manchester it was all Argos catalogues -- nothing for a skinny weirdo-looking girl\"). The boys at school used to call her \"fake model\", as they didn't believe she could possibly be celebrated for her looks.\n\nNonetheless, her unique looks chimed perfectly with the mood in fashion at the time. Elson emerged with a group of other extraordinary-looking British models, including O'Connor, Iris Palmer and Jade Parfitt -- \"The ugly ducklings at school who were lucky enough to find each other later,\" as she now puts it. When Steven Meisel met her in 1997, the night before Elson's eighteenth birthday, he remembers being transfixed by her \"unique beauty which transcended conventional prettiness\" -- and promptly shaved her eyebrows off. He photographed her for their famous debut shoot, and Le Freak was born. So, just as Elson thought she'd discovered the place in which her looks were celebrated, she instead found herself being called the same names as at school, but on an international scale. In one interview she was asked by a reporter, \"How does it feel to be the ugly one?\" \"I can't deny,\" she says carefully, \"that some of the names hurt.\"\n\nThey hurt, but were lucrative, and so Elson, to an extent, played up to them. \"Being the unusual one was always my identity in the fashion world,\" she says at one point. The next two years were hugely successful. She and O'Connor moved to New York together -- and then things got a lot worse.\n\nFashions change in models as well as clothes, and after 18 months of Elson knowing nothing but success, the trend switched from edgily different girls to Brazilian babes, and the work fell off. \"All of a sudden it was like, 'Nahhh, we don't like you any more,'\" she says, still clearly hurt at the rejection by the one industry where she felt (sort of) accepted. It must have been like being dumped by a boyfriend, I suggest. \"It was! Suddenly people who you thought were your friends aren't even saying hello, whereas six months earlier they couldn't have been nicer.\" And then her beloved ex-boyfriend, Raphael de Rothschild (\"a brilliant boy\", is how Elson describes him), died of a drug overdose. O'Connor and Elson had tea together after the funeral service and O'Connor remembers her as \"completely heartbroken, but somehow she held it together\". Elson cut her hair savagely short and took six months off from fashion. \"That was the worst time of my life; you couldn't have paid me to go back there,\" she says.\n\nIssues surrounding food inevitably arose again, and in 2002 she wrote an article for Vogue about her struggle with eating. although in that article she stressed that the problem was personal not professional, when we talk she is careful to apportion some of the blame to the industry in which she was working: \"I felt like absolute shit as a teenager, and all I had was people around me telling me I was right! I remember once I came back from a job in Paris and the stylist said to me, 'Have you been eating too many croissants, Karen?' The point of that piece was just to say, 'Look, can't we stop all this already?' And I do think, particularly in Britain, steps have been taken [towards protecting models]. But it's not over yet.\" Days after the interview, she sends me a long, urgent email, reiterating that she never had an eating disorder, she just felt under pressure to stay thin to be a model. Although the points she makes are certainly valid, there is, I suspect, a large amount of concern here to spare the feelings of her parents, who she says were \"a little upset\" by the Vogue piece.\n\n\"I never understand people saying they don't want to get older,\" she says, \"because, honestly, now, things have never been better.\" It's hard not to suspect why this might be. On the one hand it's the ultimate cliche: model meets rock star, and on a music-video shoot, no less. But Jack White and Elson have always been the anomalies in their respective professions, the Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter of the music and fashion worlds. As Bonham Carter does for Burton, Elson embodies White's own cartoonish aesthetic with her white skin and her bright-red hair. \"She and Jack together are very stylishly co-ordinated, as if they live on their own planet,\" laughs stylist Bay Garnett. But what makes their marriage really rise above the stereotype is the palpable affection they have for each other and their children, Scarlett, two, and Henry Lee, one.\n\nThe two met in 2005 when she was hired to appear in The White Stripes' video for \"Blue Orchid\" and it really was, she says with a small smile, love at first sight, or at least the recognition of a connection. She was 26 and he was 29. \"We are just two kindred spirits and when we met there was just this sense of ease. I could be completely myself with him and, personally, I'd never had that before. I felt as if I'd known him my entire life,\" she remembers. A snap of the fingers later (\"About three weeks!\" Elson giggles) they were married, in the Amazon basin, at the point of convergence of three rivers. \"Beyond surreal, just gorgeous,\" is how Elson describes it.\n\nWhite, in one of the few comments he has made about his personal life, said, \"We knew we were in love from the moment we met. Whether [our wedding] was going to happen a year from now or three years later, it was just going to happen.\" Three years on, Elson is still clearly besotted.\n\nShe does say at one point that she and White try not to talk too much about each other in interviews: \"It's precious to me, so to protect it is vital.\" Nonetheless, she can't help but talk about him. \"When I met him I just couldn't believe that a man like this still existed -- a man who will always hold the door for you, and always notices if you wear a pretty dress. When he wakes up in the morning, he has a mission and he gets it completed. I've never met anyone so motivated. It's like this confidence he has in himself and, as a woman, it's very attractive to see a man who knows what he wants and just goes off and does it.\" The two of them live a low-key life in Nashville. Elson rises at about six-ish, usually woken by Scarlett demanding her presence. The family will often spend the morning playing in their back garden, or maybe go to the park. Then Elson and White will wander into town together -- Elson is opening a vintage store there -- before coming back home and maybe making some music in the studio.\n\nThe next night we head to a gig by White's band The Raconteurs. The music is classic White: dramatic, bluesy, less mannered, more rock'n'roll than that of The White Stripes. The boys in the audience are all dressed like Jack (gently battered suits with hats, or jeans with tight T-shirts or lumberjack shirts). The girls are either dressed like Karen (vintage dresses, the occasional shock of red hair) or, more commonly, like Jack. Impressively, Elson has found someone with a look even more extraordinary and attention-grabbing than her own. On stage he is the commanding presence of the band, prowling around even when not singing. \"Find yourself a girl and settle down/ Live a simple life in a quiet town\" he sings from their first big hit, \"Steady As She Goes\", to an ecstatic audience in the mosh pit. Elson looks beautiful in her little floral vintage dress.\n\nAfter the gig, she, the band and friends cram into a people carrier and head to the Dorchester to drink mojitos until forever o'clock in the morning. Everyone is chattering excitably. Elson and White just beam prettily together: two outsiders who have found their own way in.\n\nThat is such a great article. I love how the interviewer describes her, it's beautiful. She obviously really loves Jack and that is so sweet. She's brilliant."
