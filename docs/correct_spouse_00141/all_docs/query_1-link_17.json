        "text": "Jack White and Karen Elson have split.\n\nThe musician and model/singer released a joint statement Friday saying they are to divorce.\n\n“We remain dear and trusted friends and co-parents to our wonderful children Scarlett and Henry Lee…we feel so fortunate for the time we have shared and the time we will continue to spend both separately and together watching our children grow,” the former couple said.\n\nBut the news isn’t too glum for fans of the duo. Unlike most marriages that go sour, this pairing will go out with a party.\n\n“In honor of that time shared, we are throwing a divorce party…an evening together in Nashville to re-affirm our friendship and celebrate the past and future with close friends and family.” White and Elson announced in the statement.\n\nNot everyone is invited, apparently.\n\nAccording to an invitation for the divorce soiree, the throwdown is “only for close personal friends and family…so please no plus ones or dead beats.”\n\nThe couple first met on when Elson appeared in The White Stripes music video for “Blue Orchid.” They were married soon after in South America in 2005.\n\nWhite is best known for his work with The White Stripes, though he has been busy in recent years with several successful bands, including The Dead Weather.\n\nElson has been busy recording and performing her own music (the flame-haired beauty also manages a clothing store in Nashville, where both White and Elson live)."
