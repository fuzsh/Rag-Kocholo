        "text": "Two years after Jack White and Karen Elson threw a party to celebrate their amicable divorce, things have gotten ugly between the exes. Elson has received a restraining order against White, barring the musician from having any contact with her unless it concerns parenting time with their children, The Nashville City Paper reports.\n\nPHOTO: Celebrities who've survived scandal\n\nElson, who has primary custody of their two children, claims White is an unfit parent with a violent temper who has a history of harassment. She says that the restraining order was sought out of \"fears for her and the children's safety as a result of this harassment.\"The order references multiple examples of this alleged harassment, including White contacting Elson's paralegal \"in an appropriate and aggressive manner\" and making derogatory comments to the couple's business for the sole purpose \"to harass and embarrass [Elson].\"According to the model, White has denied all of Elson's requests for family counseling, and the filing claims that White's abusive habits largely influenced the dissolution of their marriage. \"This pattern of husband's bullying wife into submission was a contributing factor in the demise of their marriage,\" the order reads.\n\nPHOTOS: Shocking celebrity breakups\n\nThe restraining order also says that White is very threatened by other musicians and their proximity to his family. The White Stripes singer tried to make Elson remove their children from a class in their private school in which another entertainer's child was a student because the artist \"ripped off\" his music, the order reads. In addition, he harassed Elson for attending the wedding of another musician who also \"ripped off\" his music.Elson's attorney Rose Palermo has filed a motion for a custodial psychological evaluation, which is still pending. A hearing is scheduled onAug. 29 for Elson and White to try and settle the custody dispute."
