        "text": "Jack White and Karen Elson have announced they are to divorce.\n\nThe couple announced the end of their marriage in a joint statement today (June 10), bringing to an end their six years together. But in typically eccentric style, the pair remain on good terms and are holding a ‘divorce party’ together to mark the occasion.\n\nThe statement reads: “To whom it may concern: Karen Elson and Jack White announce today that they are getting divorced,” before leading into a personal message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey say: “We remain dear and trusted friends and co-parents to our wonderful children Scarlett and Henry Lee. We feel so fortunate for the time we have shared and the time we will continue to spend both separately and together watching our children grow. In honour of that time shared, we are throwing a divorce party, an evening together in Nashville to re-affirm our friendship and celebrate the past and future with close friends and family. With love, Karen Elson and Jack White.”\n\nThe party is expected to take place in Nashville tonight. The invitations apparently read: “Please help us celebrate together this anniversary of the making and breaking of the sacred union of marriage with our best friends and animals.”\n\nWhite married Elson in June 2005 after they met on the set of the video for The White Stripes‘ single ‘Blue Orchid’. The wedding took place in Brazil, on a canoe on the confluence of three rivers; the Rio Negro, the Solimones and the Amazon.\n\nRecommended"
