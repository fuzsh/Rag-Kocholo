        "text": "Jack White and Karen Elson’s marraige is now officially over after a Nashville judge has finalized the pair’s divorce, The Associated Press reports.\n\nThe divorce agreement, which the judge signed on November 26th, names Elson as the primary residential parent for their two children, giving White about 150 days a year with them. White gets to keep hold of all of his music businesses, which include his various bands as well as his record label, Third Man Records.\n\nWhere Does Jack White Rank on Our 100 Greatest Guitarists List?\n\nTrending\n\nWhite announced that he and the British singer and model were splitting up in June 2011, after six years of marriage. They celebrated the break with a blowout divorce party, and White said at the time that they “remain dear and trusted friends and co-parents to our wonderful children Scarlett and Henry Lee,” and “feel so fortunate for the time we have shared and the time we will continue to spend both separately and together watching our children grow.”"
