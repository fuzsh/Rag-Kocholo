        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) - June 10, 2011\n\nThe rocker and his model-singer wife announced Friday - on their sixth anniversary - that they're splitting. But they're not mourning the demise of their marriage; they're celebrating it with a party described as a \"positive swing bang hum dinger.\"\n\nThe invitation asks close friends and family to \"please help us celebrate this anniversary of the making and breaking of the sacred union of marriage with our best friends and animals.\"\n\nThey are the parents of two children, Scarlett and Henry Lee, and say they are still \"dear and trusted friends.\"\n\nThis is the second split of the year for White. Earlier, he announced the White Stripes - comprised of White and ex-wife Meg White - were calling it quits."
