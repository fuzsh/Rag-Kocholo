        "text": "At least 50 per cent of indie’s premiere former couple will be breathing a sigh of relief today.\n\nAfter a tumultuous few years of marriage, Jack White and British model Karen Elson have finalised their divorce.\n\nThe agreement to terminate the union was signed by a judge on 26 November, court records confirm.\n\nThe documents name Elson as the primary residential parent for the couple’s two children. White – one half of rock outfit The White Stripes – has been granted 150 days access to the children a year.\n\nElson and White married in Nashville in 2005. She filed for divorce last year.\n\nInitially, the separation started off amicably, with the pair even throwing a divorce party for their friends and relatives in the wake of their break-up.\n\nBut it soon turned sour, when Elson filed for a restraining order against White after a slew of harassment allegations.\n\nElson claimed that White sent her a barrage of texts and emails, and that White ‘was not fit’ to be a father.\n\nWhite was legally barred from having “any contact with his wife whatsoever except if it relates to parenting time with the parties' minor children”.\n\nHowever, the singer contested the order and filed a motion at the County Court in Nashville on 2 August.\n\n“The reason for filing this response is that Mr White does not want to be portrayed as something he is not, violent towards his wife and children,” it read.\n\nThe filing also cited a series of emails from his former wife to White, in which she praised his parenting.\n\n“You're an amazing father, I'm so glad we had these kids together,” one message from Elson, dated 19 May 2013, read.\n\nWhite has, however, retained all rights to his music businesses, including The White Stripes, Dead Weather and his label, Third Man Records."
