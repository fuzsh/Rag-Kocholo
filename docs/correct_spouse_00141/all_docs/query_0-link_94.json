        "text": "What do you say to two people who are celebrating their sixth wedding anniversary and simultaneously announcing their divorce? \"Congratulations, I'm sorry to hear that\"?\n\nWell, if you happen to be in Nashville tonight, and you're lucky enough to have an invitation (or the savvy to scam your way in), you can find out firsthand. Six years to the day after getting hitched, Jack White and Karen Elson are throwing in the towel, and they're observing both occasions with a party for friends and family. The invitation states \"Please help us celebrate together this anniversary of the making and breaking of the sacred union of marriage with our best friends and animals.\"\n\nThe couple met when Elson, a British fashion model, appeared in the video for the White Stripes song \"Blue Orchid\" (see below). Presumably White was smitten upon finding someone just as pasty-faced as himself, and whose name was not Meg.\n\nWhite and Elson have two children together: Scarlett, 5, and Henry, 3. The pair released a statement saying \"We feel so fortunate for the time we have shared and the time we will continue to spend both separately and together watching our children grow.\"\n\nElson is also a singer and songwriter; White produced her debut album, The Ghost Who Walks, and he also directed the video for its title track:\n\nWhite is clearly drawn to songs about ghosts and walking, as evidenced by this Tegan and Sara song recorded by the White Stripes:"
