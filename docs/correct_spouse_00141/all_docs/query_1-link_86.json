        "text": "The divorce proceedings between Nashville rocker Jack White and his wife, Karen Elson, have apparently turned sour now that a judge has granted a restraining order against the musician after claims he barraged his wife with harassing phone calls and e-mails in recent months.\n\nIn a Nashville circuit court filing requesting the order, Elson's attorney claimed White had been pressuring his wife into a settlement agreement over the parenting of the couple's two children.\n\n\"He has persisted in discouraging her from communicating with or taking advice from her counsel in effort to coerce her into acting against her and the parties' minor children's best interests, often by emails laced with profanity and calling wife derogatory names,\" the filing stated. \"These communications are often threatening in nature and the wife fears for her and the children's safety as a result of this harassment.\"\n\nThis comes two years after the couple announced they were ending things amicably in grand style, throwing a party to celebrate the split.\n\nAccording to the court filing, White recently urged Elson to contact their children's private school to have their son placed in a different class from the child of another entertainer whom White \"feels has 'ripped off' his music.\"\n\nThe filing also states that White accused Elson of being disrespectful for attending the wedding of another entertainer whom he says also ripped off his music.\n\nCircuit Judge Phillip Robinson granted the restraining order July 19, allowing White to contact his wife through e-mail only. A hearing on the case is scheduled for Aug. 29."
