        "text": "Jack White was from Detroit, Michigan\n\nJack was born on 9 July 1975 to his mother Teresa and father Gorman Gillis.\n\nHis mother had a Polish family and his father was Scottish-Canadian. He was raised Catholic and was an altar boy.\n\nMeg White was born in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan\n\nMeg was born on 10 December 1974 to Walter and Catherine White. She grew up in a wealthy suburb with her older sister Heather.\n\nThe pair met through Meg's work\n\nInstead of going to college, Meg decided she wanted to be a chef and began working at Memphis Smoke. This is where she met Jack and they began dating. Meg decided to learn the drums on a whim and Jack liked her fresh and simple style.\n\nThey began playing together and played their first gig at the Gold Dollar in Detroit.\n\nMeg and Jack White were married before they formed a band\n\nThey may have concocted the siblings story as a gimmick when they formed the band in 1997, but they officially became Jack and Meg White a when they married a year before on 21 September 1996.\n\nJack took Meg's surname\n\nYes, Jack is often thought of as the brains behind the operation and the architect of the whole band, but it was actually Meg - who was born Megan Martha White - who was responsible for their name.\n\nJack - who was actually born John Anthony Gillis - changed his name legally to hers when they got married.\n\nTheir surname wasn't the only inspiration for the The White Stripes' name\n\nAccording to indie folklore, The White Stripes were also called The White Stripes as a nod to Meg's penchant for peppermint sweets.\n\nJack White is quoted as saying: \"Meg loves peppermints, and we were going to call ourselves The Peppermints. But since our last name was White, we decided to call it The White Stripes. It revolved around this childish idea, the ideas kids have—because they are so much better than adult ideas, right?\"\n\nThe couple divorced before they even became famous\n\nBy the time the band had even released their breakout album White Blood Cells in 2001, they had already called it quits as husband and wife.\n\nThey are said to have divorced in March 2000, almost a year before the third album hit the shops.\n\nJack and Meg both went on to marry and divorce again\n\nAfter Meg, Jack White was married to the English supermodel and singer-songwriter Karen Elson from 2005-2013. They share two children together: Scarlett Teresa White and Henry Lee White.\n\nAfter Jack, Meg White was married from 2009-2013 to guitarist Jackson Smith - the son of Patti Smith and Fred \"Sonic\" Smith.\n\nMeg was less enthusiastic about The White Stripes than Jack\n\nIn throwback interview, Jack White opened up about Meg's lack of excitement when it came to recording in the studio together.\n\nAs reported by NME in 2012, in an interview with Esquire, he describes Meg as \"very uninterested.\"\n\n\"So we would finish a mix of a song and I'd say, 'Wow! That's pretty good!' I'd look around and Meg would just be sitting there, and the engineer would just be sitting there.\"\n\nHe continued: \"So it'd be sorta like, 'OK... Let's just move on to the next one.' It was just me by myself. But it was the best thing for me. It taught me a lot about trusting my gut,\" he explained.\n\nHis relationship with the other half of the duo always retained an enigmatic quality - something Jack admitted after their split.\n\n\"It's strange to know that there's beautiful moments that no one will ever know about,\" he commented.\n\n\"It's whether I'm going to tell you, because Meg's never going to tell you. There's a sadness to that, a romance.\"\n\nThe White Stripes officially dissolved in 2011\n\nAfter a long hiatus with no new releases, the duo reported that they were disbanding.\n\nTaking to their official website on 2 February 2011, they wrote: \"The reason is not due to artistic differences or lack of wanting to continue, nor any health issues as both Meg and Jack are feeling fine and in good health.\n\nThey added: \"It’s for a myriad of reasons, but mostly to preserve what is beautiful and special about the band and have it stay that way.\""
