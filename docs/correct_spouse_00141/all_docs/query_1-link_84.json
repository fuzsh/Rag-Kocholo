        "text": "Jack White surprised fans – and, we’re assuming, his then-girlfriend Olivia Jean – when he proposed on stage during his April 8 concert at the Masonic Temple in Detroit.\n\nAccording to ABC television affiliate WXYZ, the proposal took place towards the end of White’s set. The rocker was in the midst of performing the White Stripes’ 2001 single “Hotel Yorba” when he proposed to Jean, whose band had opened the show earlier in the evening.\n\n“Hotel Yorba” completed the initial set, but when White returned for the encore, Jean accompanied him. The couple were joined by White’s mother, Jean’s father and Third Man Records co-founder Ben Swank, who served as officiant. The couple was then married on stage, with their respective bassists serving as best man and maid of honor.\n\nThe proposal and marriage capped a whirlwind 24 hours for White. The rocker’s new album, Fear of the Dawn, was also released April 8, and earlier in the day the Detroit native delivered the national anthem at Tigers’ opening day.\n\nWhile you’d traditionally expect social media to be ablaze with images from White’s engagement and marriage, the musician famously does not allow cell phones at his shows. Still, that hasn’t stopped many of White fans from sharing their congratulations (see below).\n\nThis marks the third marriage for the musician born John Gillis. From 1996 to 2000 he was married to his White Stripes bandmate Meg White (he took her last name). Five years later he married model and musician Karen Elson. The couple announced their breakup in 2011 and officially divorced in 2013."
