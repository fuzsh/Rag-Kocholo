        "text": "Jack White rakes in serious cash every month -- roughly $62,000 -- but according to his divorce agreement, he's only paying $3,200 in monthly child support.\n\nJack's divorce from ex-wife Karen Elson was just finalized, and in the docs, each spouse declares his or her monthly income. Karen (who is also a singer) says hers is $33,971. Not a bad living.\n\nBut the strange part -- Karen's now the primary residential parent for their two kids (a 6-year-old and 7-year-old) and Jack has agreed to pay only $3,200 a month in child support, which feels low when you think about how much he makes.\n\nThen again, Jack also gets the kids for a huge chunk of the year -- 150 days -- so the low number makes a little more sense.\n\nAs for the rest of their divorce agreement, Jack did pretty well -- he gets to keep the rights to all his musical businesses, including The White Stripes, the Raconteurs, The Dead Weather, and his record label. Karen gets to keep the rights to hers.\n\nJack and Karen were married in 2005 in a canoe in the middle of the Amazon river in Brazil, only to separate in 2011. Karen filed for divorce in 2012. The split was pretty bitter."
