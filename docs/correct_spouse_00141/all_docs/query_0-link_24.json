        "text": "Photo: Tom Spray\n\nJack White is fighting back against ex-wife Karen Elson, who was granted a restraining order against White last week. Rolling Stone reports that White filed a countermotion in a Nashville court today, disputing Elson's accusations that White has been harassing her. White and Elson have been fighting over custody of their two children, daughter Scarlett and son Henry Lee.\n\nAccording to Rolling Stone, the countermotion states, \"The reason for filing this response is that Mr. White does not want to be portrayed as something he is not, violent toward his wife and children.\"\n\nElson's restraining order said, \"Wife fears for her and the children’s safety as a result of this harassment...This pattern of husband's bullying wife into submission was a contributing factor in the demise of their marriage.\"\n\nElson also wants White to undergo a psychiatric examination. Rolling Stone reports that White's countermotion states that this request is \"inflammatory . . . . disingenuous, fraudulent and retaliatory and simply designed to malign him in the public record or to gain an upper hand in this litigation.\"\n\nWhite claims that Elson's accusations have no standing, since until very recently, she seemed to think he was a good father. His countermotion states that on May 19, she emailed him, \"You're an amazing father, I'm so glad we had these kids together.\" He also claims that she left Scarlett and Henry Lee in his care for 10 days while she took a trip to New York... just a day after signing her restraining order affidavit, reports Rolling Stone."
