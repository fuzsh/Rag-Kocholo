        "text": "from people.com:\n\nWhite Stripes frontman Jack White, whose ex Renée Zellweger was married just last month, is now a married man himself, according to a posting on the band's Web site.\n\nWhite exchanged vows with model Karen Elson (who appears in the group's \"Blue Orchid\" video) in the Brazilian city of Manaus on Wednesday, according to the statement, which the band's rep confirmed to PEOPLE. Elson's reps declined comment on the model's nuptials.\n\nAccording to the Web posting, the wedding took place \"on the confluence of three rivers – the Rio Negro, the Solimones and the Amazon,\" and was officiated \"by a traditional shaman priest on a canoe at the exact point where the three rivers met.\"\n\nThe ceremony – at which Stripes manager Ian Montone served as best man and Stripes drummer Meg White was maid of honor – was attended \"by a small party of close friends\" and \"was immediately followed by a blessing by a priest at a Catholic cathedral called Igreja Matric,\" the posting goes on to say.\n\nThe wedding seems to have caught everyone by surprise, including the band's own rep. \"I didn't know,\" Chloe Walsh tells PEOPLE. The White Stripes plan to perform in Europe during the summer before touring the U.S. in August, \"so I don't imagine there will be much time for honeymooning,\" Walsh adds.\n\nThe Web statement also says: \"This is the first marriage for both newlyweds,\" though in 2003 the Detroit Free Press located a 1996 marriage document showing that Jack and Meg White were married. A divorce took place four years later.\n\nJack, 29, split from Zellweger after a year-and-a-half-long relationship last year. The Cinderella Man actress married country star Kenny Chesney on May 9.\n\noceanharlot said:\n\nhaha, i love jack white. he's such a kookoo nut. i love how his ex wife (who the public THOUGHT was his sister for quite a long while) was the maid of honor.\n\nsimply fabulous and dysfunctional... funny how dysfuction is so the norm for americans.\n\nhow is it dysfunctional to be friends with your ex-lover? stalking them, posting their nude photos on the internet, calling in the middle of the night and hanging up - that would be dysfunctional. playing music with them, making records and touring all over the world with them seems kinda like maturity to me.\n\ncongratulations to the newlyweds.\n\nmeme"
