This is surprising.\n\nYep. Mte\n\nmte. It's like Halle and Gabriel too. One minute they seemed great, and then ~Monster's Brawl happened.\n\nThe sad part is they're still married, especially if Karen's the \"estranged wife\" still. /mentioned in the article.\n\nAll around, this is sad. Praying for their children.\n\nShe's too good for him tbh\n\nITA\n\nyep\n\nWell then.\n\nThis is why, as a famous person, you should be REALLY SURE it's going to work out when you get married. Especially when you are getting married to another famous person.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nThey can't lol.\n\nBeing harassed and stalked by your ex can happen to anyone...\n\nI think they got married after knowing each other a few days. lol\n\nI dont think fame is even a factor; plenty of unknown women are stalked/harassed by their unknown psycho ex-male partners on a daily basis\n\nThis just happens to be a very public snapshop of what's sadly routine in intimate-partner abuse.\n\n(no subject) - cageyb\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - mammary_glands Expand\n\nlol, how?\n\n:(\n\nthat thing about pulling the kids out of school is not cute\n\ni thought they had a really amicable split and even had a divorce party\n\n:(\n\nWow, this is awful... I hope it works out for the kids. :(\n\nI can't imagine ever having a relationship end that messily. shit is crazy.\n\nSeriously! Especially with kids involved :(\n\nHe sounds super paranoid and creepy.\n\nthere go my divorce idols (besides michael sheen and kate beckinsale)\n\nthey were never married, so they never got divorced.\n\ni get what youre saying though. they had the classiest breakup and breakup aftermath ever (at least as far as the public was concerned)\n\nUgh.what a psycho.\n\nMte... He made amazing music but his personality is borderline creepy imo, just watch meg/jack interviews or read up on what happened there. It's obvs not his fault that she has anxiety issues but he seemed so.. controlling, I guess.\n\nDid anything else come out about them after they split? I knew he said it was really all up to her if the band continued but I don't know if he said something more damaging after that.\n\nI loved the White Stripes :( but it seems like they don't even talk anymore and now all of this is making thing that his personality is the reason why.\n\n(no subject) - aurorab0realis Expand\n\ndamn :/\n\nI was literally just thinking the other day how they are the example for how to divorce but still remain good coparents and care about the kids more than petty fighting. OOPS. I guess a few mature sounding interviews mean nothing.\n\nsad little man\n\nIsn't this the wife that's like also his sister?\n\nNo this is the model"
