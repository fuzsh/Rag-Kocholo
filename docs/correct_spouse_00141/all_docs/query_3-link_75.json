        "text": "Karen Elson is apparently the latest model to try a singing career. She has expert help on tap - her husband is the White Stripe's Jack White, and he has produced her debut album so it's no surprise that it's a lot better than other offerings we've encountered in the past. According to NME the album is set for release this summer, but you can check out a teaser track, 'The Ghost That Walks', at www.karenelson.com.\n\nAgyness Deyn is also exploring her talents. She's already ticked the singing and acting boxes, so now she's setting up an online lifestyle magazine with her friend Fiona Byrne. According to NY Magazine, Agy, who will be the creative director, says 'It's just going to be stuff we think is rad.' The idea is to introduce the rest of us to their world of fashion and music, with a bit of help from their friends who will be writing stories for them. The site, Naag.com (a combination of the last two letters of each of their names) is due to launch sometime in April or May."
