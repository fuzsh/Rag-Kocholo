        "text": "This is so sad. I've been following them from the very beginning. From the night of the day the met on the set of Blue Orchid video, to South America, to when she was pregnant with Scarlet, and then Henry. To my eye they were so happy. Really, truly happy. Interesting thought about the green card, but I'm sure that had nothing to do with them staying together for six years and having two kids together.\n\nIn my experience, they're both very intense people who are very into their work. I suspected 'Cruel Summer' was written about Alison, but I'd be very surprised if she and Jack had a full on affair. However, there is no doubt they spent a lot of time together while Karen and Jack spent a lot of time apart with their various projects. Easy to see how the combination of the two could breed jealousy and insecurities that could do ugly things to even a seemingly solid relationship.\n\nDivorce party? When I heard about it I had decidedly mixed feelings and that hasn't changed. It's great they are able to have an amicable, drama free split for the kids sake if nothing else, but the idea of a party leaves me cold. Oh well, it wasn't meant for public consumption.\n\nEmmylou Harris once said she was great ex-wife; better than a wife. Maybe that applies to Jack as well. He and Meg are still close. I hope he and Karen can truly remain friends. They were good together.\n\nThey're originally from very different worlds\n\nThey travel alot because of the nature of their work\n\nPlus Jack appears to be very intense... intense people, especially artists, aren't always the easiest people to be around\n\nI always thought Detroit and Manchester were kind of on par with one another? Am I wrong? If you're referring to their careers, any career in the entertainment industry (modeling, acting, singing) is quite similar and the often overlap.\n\nI wonder if one or both of them will leave Nashville now. It's kind of sad because she had a really great vintage store there and now I believe it's closed or under new management?\n\nJudge slaps Jack White with restraining order, bars contact with estranged wife\n\nTwo years after Nashville’s Jack White and Karen Elson threw a party to celebrate the pair’s ostensibly friendly break up, Elson has sought and received a restraining order against White after a flurry of harassment allegations.\n\n“Wife fears for her and the children’s safety as a result of this harassment,” the order read, describing how White contacted his ex-wife’s paralegal “in an inappropriate and aggressive manner.”\n\nElson, who cares for the pair’s two children, has been tussling for months with White over parenting rights. White wants to help raise the children, although Elson maintains that White is not fit to be a parent.\n\nWhite, according to the restraining order affidavit, has a violent temper and a tendency of sending harassing emails and text messages.\n\nElson has contacted White’s attorney about the number of phone calls and emails he was allegedly sending “pressuring her about the settlement terms for divorce.”\n\nIn one email, White wrote: “I’m not extending this anymore,” referring to a settlement. “And we’re not getting lawyers involved to rip me off.”\n\nRecently, according to the filing, White wanted Elson to contact their kids’ private school in an effort to get their kids out of a class in which another entertainer’s child was present. White said that he feels that entertainer “ripped off” his music, the order said.\n\nIn another incident, White berated Elson when she attended the wedding of a rival musician. Again, he was upset because this entertainer also “ripped off” his music, according to the order. The musician was unnamed in the court filing.\n\nElson has on multiple occasions asked White to attend family counseling, but Elson says White has refused.\n\nElson’s attorney Rose Palermo said both sides have been working to settle the dispute privately. She had no further comment.\n\nCathy Speers Johnson, attorney for White, could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday afternoon.\n\nWhite, the order said, contacted the duo’s business manager and made derogatory comments about Elson. “This was done to harass and embarrass wife.”\n\n“This pattern of husband’s bullying wife into submission was a contributing factor in the demise of their marriage.\"\n\nPalermo has filed a motion for a custodial psychological evaluation, which is still pending results.\n\nWhite was served the restraining order on July 22. It was signed by Circuit Court Judge Philip Robinson. White is barred from having “any contact with wife whatsoever except as it relates to parenting time with the parties’ minor children.”\n\nFurthermore, White is only allowed to communicate with Elson over email.\n\nThe two have a hearing Aug. 29 over a dispute over their two children.\n\nnashvillecitypaper.com"
