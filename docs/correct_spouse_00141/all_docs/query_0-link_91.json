        "text": "We’ve heard of friendly divorces but this takes the (wedding) cake. While most of us were surmising that the reason that Jack White was in the UK guesting at Third Man artist Seasick Steve’s London show along with erstwhile Dead Weather bandmate Alison Mosshart and Led Zeppelin’s John Paul Jones was that he and the quietly gorgeous Mosshart were a couple. But no. White was a guest at Kate Moss’s weekend wedding to Mosshart’s Kills partner Jamie Hince, and his date was none other than soon to be ex-wife Karen Elson. Perhaps more disconcerting was Butt Hole Surfer Gibby Hayes extending a lascivious tongue towards Elson’s exposed ear.\n\nAs for Mosshart, she was nabbed by photographers squirming while Kelly Osbourne pasted a big kiss on her lips."
