        "text": "Jack White has officially divorced his wife Karen Elson after a two year battle.\n\nCourt records have reportedly revealed it was finalised on November 26 after a bitter year of arguments between the pair.\n\nThe former White Stripes frontman married British model Elson in 2005, but marital bliss crashed and burned when she filed for divorce last year.\n\nReports say the agreement puts Elson as the primary residential parent of the couple's two children, Scarlett Teresa, seven, and Henry Lee, six, and Jack will be able to see them for around 150 days a year.\n\nThe 38-year-old singer will keep the rights to his musical businesses - which include bands The White Stripes, The Raconteurs, Dead Weather and his record label, Third Man Records.\n\nAccording to TMZ, the singer earns around $62,000 (£38,000) a month, but his divorce agreements only requires him to pay $3,200 (£2,000) in monthly child support.\n\nThe divorce got nasty at the start of this year when Elson reportedly filed for a restraining order because White was apparently threatening her. White denied the accusations.\n\nThey aren't the only celebrity couple going their separate ways this week."
