NEW YORK — Jack White and Karen Elson’s divorce party might rival their wedding.

The rocker and his model-singer wife announced Friday – on their sixth anniversary – that they’re splitting. But they’re not mourning the demise of their marriage; they’re celebrating it with a party described as a “positive swing bang hum dinger.”

The invitation asks close friends and family to “please help us celebrate this anniversary of the making and breaking of the sacred union of marriage with our best friends and animals.”

They are the parents of two children, Scarlett and Henry Lee, and say they are still “dear and trusted friends.”

This is the second split of the year for White. Earlier, he announced the White Stripes – comprised of White and ex-wife Meg White – were calling it quits.
