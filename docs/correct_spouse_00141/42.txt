FORMER White Stripes rocker Jack White and his wife, former supermodel Karen Elson, announced their divorce and the pair is throwing a party to celebrate the end of their six-year marriage, TMZ reported.

"In honor of that time shared, we are throwing a divorce party ... to re-affirm our friendship and celebrate the past and future," the couple said in a joint statement about the bash that will include "dancing, photos, memories and drinks with alcohol in them."

"We feel so fortunate for the time we have shared and the time we will continue to spend both separately and together watching our children grow," the statement added.

In 2005, White, 35, married the British beauty in an exotic ceremony on a canoe on the Amazon River. They have two children together.

The rocker was previously married to his White Stripes bandmate, Meg White, from 1996 to 2000. She served as the maid of honor at her ex's marriage to Elson.

After a long hiatus, the band announced in February that it was "officially ending" after 14 years.
