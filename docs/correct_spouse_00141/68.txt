White Stripes frontman Jack White, 29, married British supermodel Karen Elson, 25, Thursday in the Brazilian city of Manaus.

The couple, who had not made their relationship public, were wed by a Shaman priest in a canoe at the spot where three rivers — the Rio Negro, the Solimones and the Amazon — meet. An intimate gathering of close friends, the wedding featured Stripes drummer Meg White as maid of honor and the Stripes’ manager as best man. The Shaman ceremony was followed by a blessing at a local Catholic cathedral.

The British-born Elson — a major model since the late Nineties, known for her incredibly pale complexion, red hair and ultra-slim frame — appears in the Stripes’ new video, “Blue Orchid,” and has been the face of such fashion houses as Gucci, Chanel and Louis Vuitton. She has previously been linked to former Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha. White dated Oscar-winning actress Renee Zellweger for more than a year before splitting last fall. (Zellweger married country star Kenny Chesney last month.) While a band statement claims that this is the first marriage for both Elson and White, he was married to Meg White from 1996 to 2000.
