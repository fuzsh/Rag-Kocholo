"Karen Elson and Jack White announce today that they are getting divorced," the rep's statement said, according to People magazine. "We remain dear and trusted friends and co-parents to our wonderful children Scarlett and Henry Lee. We feel so fortunate for the time we have shared and the time we will continue to spend both separately and together watching our children grow."

"In honor of that time shared, we are throwing a divorce party," the couple added. "An evening together in Nashville to re-affirm our friendship and celebrate the past and future with close friends and family."

Us magazine reports that the message was sent as an e-vite to the couple's friends and family.

According to the invite (you can see it here), White, 35, and Elson, 32, request guests' presence on Friday evening at "a party to celebrate their 6th anniversary and their upcoming divorce with a positive swing bang hum dinger" that will include "dancing, photos, memories and drinks with alcohol in them."

"This is only for close personal friends and family," the invitation warns. "So please no plus ones or dead beats."
