Jack White’s ex-wife is dishing on her relationship with the rocker.

Karen Elson says that she and White attempted to do the “conscious-uncoupling thing” before divorcing in 2013.

In a new interview she explained, “Every divorce has its challenging moments. We first tried to do the Goopy conscious-uncoupling thing. That all fell on its head, but now I can wholeheartedly say that my ex-husband is a dear friend and someone I love.”

The pair got married in 2005 and have two teenage children together.
