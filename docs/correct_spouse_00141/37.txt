The breakup between former White Stripes singer Jack White and his ex-wife, singer-songwriter and model Karen Elson isn't so friendly any more.

Two years ago the pair held a party to celebrate their divorce (they had married in 2005), but according to the Nashville City Paper, a Nashville circuit court judge granted Elson a restraining order against White on July 22, which bars the singer from having any contact with her "whatsoever except as it relates to parenting time with the parties' minor children."

Elson has primary custody of Scarlett Teresa and Henry Lee, the couple's two children. In the restraining order affidavit, she calls White an unfit father who refused to attend family counseling. She adds that White has a violent temper and has left her harassing text messages and emails that pressured her about the divorce's settlement terms.

One incident named in the filing indicated that White wanted his children taken out of a class where another entertainer's child was because White thought the child's parent had "ripped off" his music. Another time, White reportedly was upset with Elison when she attended the wedding of another performer, who he also said "ripped off" his music. The musician(s) were not named in the order.

"Wife fears for her and the children's safety as a result of this harassment," the order said.

Rose Palermo, who represents Elson, said she and her client are trying to resolve the dispute in private. Palermo requested a custodial psychological evaluation for White.

The pair are due in court Aug. 29 for a custody hearing.
