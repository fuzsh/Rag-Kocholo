After meeting on the set of The White Stripes’ music video “Blue Orchid”, White and Elson married in June 2005 on the banks of the Amazon River. Outside of marriage, White and Elson were also musical collaborators. White produced and released Elson’s 2010 debut, The Ghost Who Walks.

This is White’s second divorce, having split up with his White Stripes bandmate, Meg White, in 2000 following a four-year marriage.
