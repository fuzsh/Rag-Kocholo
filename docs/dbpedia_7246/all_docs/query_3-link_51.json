Otherwise, he serves as WALL•E's company on occasions.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nAlthough Hal is never referred to on-screen by name, he is named after producer Hal Roach. This also provides homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey’s HAL 9000.[1]\n\nThe chirps that Hal makes were created by speeding up sounds made by a raccoon.\n\nHal and the Kremies he eats/sleeps in references the myth that roaches and Twinkies (what inspired Kremies) are the only things that can survive the apocalypse.\n\nHal makes a cameo in Ratatouille.\n\nHal also makes a cameo in Wreck-It Ralph, when Ralph looks for a medal in Tapper's washroom.\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ WALL•E press kit"
