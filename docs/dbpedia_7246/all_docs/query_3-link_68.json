        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nFrank Capra understood, perhaps better than any other Hollywood director of his time, the necessary relationship between romantic comedy and social conventions—and between Hollywood movies and American ideology. From the earliest stages of his career as a gag writer for producer Hal Roach and as writer­director on some of Harry Langdon’s best silent comedies, Capra refined his comic style that pitted the “little guy” against the faceless, inhu­ man forces of “the system.” Perhaps Capra’s own career provided the blue­ print: he was himself an immigrant hustler who, as legend has it, bluffed his way into filmmaking. With personal experience informing his sentimental optimism, Capra’s homespun heroes repeatedly overcame society’s deper­ sonalizing influence. His films were filled with self­sufficient individualists, good neighbors, and benevolent institutions. | thomas schatz, Hollywood Genres. I hated being poor. Hated being a peasant.

I tried schooling, a technical education. . . . I pondered other quick leaps: bootlegging, prize­fighting, the ball and bat, con games. When I finally found my vaulting pole, it was not made of bamboo, glass or metal. In fact, it was not a pole at all. It was a magic carpet—woven with the coils and ringlets of a wondrous peel of limber plastic, whose filaments carried the genetic code of all the arts of man, and from which the abracadabra of science conjured up the hopes, the fears, the dreams of man—the magic carpet of FILM! | frank capra, The Name above the Title. Actor-director John Cassavetes’s statement that “maybe there wasn’t really an America, maybe there was only Frank Capra” perhaps goes as far as any single statement can toward understanding the pervasiveness, as well as, paradoxically, the hermeticism of Capra’s vision of America. For Capra, the viability of American society is maintained through adherence to small town values, good old-fashioned neighborliness and a belief in the “Golden Rule.” These values are bolstered by the strength of good men who are prepared to lead their communities and assert the rights of individuals, despite the forces which undermine the common man. Yet, in a very real sense, Capra’s America never existed anywhere but on film; by the 1930s, small town America was an ideal that had been transformed by nostalgia into utopia. Critic Morris Dickstein writes in American Film (May 1980): The small town is already an anachronism in these films, an idea; it’s where the hero comes from; its values are now embodied in his character , not in any fixed sense of place. Yetitisunfair—andultimatelyunrewardingfromacriticalperspective— to label Capra naive. With Capra’s storybook conception of America—which pits gangly prairie heroes against jaded politicoes and industrialists— there is a strain in Capra’s work which acknowledges, albeit cautiously, the darker side of American culture. His films take cognizance of the extent to which American institutions are controlled by monied interests. At times, Capra bludgeons audiences with a realization of the powerlessness of the masses to effect a permanent change in this order, only to mitigate the magnitude of his admission through the triumph of a folk savior like Jefferson Smith. The uniqueness of Capra’s vision, then, derives from his ability to [167.71.63.233] Project MUSE (2024-08-17 16:39 GMT) CINEMATEXAS NOTES 56 present life affirming values in his films despite his ultimate inability to resolve the conflict between the myth and reality of American culture. I wouldn’t give you two cents for all your fancy rules if behind them they didn’t have a little bit of plain old ordinary, everyday kindness, and a little lookin’ out for the other fellow, too. That’s pretty important, all that, it’s just the blood and bone and sinew of this democracy that some great men handed down to the human race, that’s all. | jefferson smith in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.
