Six-year-old Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) could hold her own with OUR GANG any day of the week, whether she's spitting on cars over a railing or accidentally setting abandoned buildings ablaze. This unassuming film is so rigorous in maintaining its child's-eye-view that the eventual rupture is heartbreaking beyond words. Gorgeously photographed in 35mm by Alexis Zabe, THE FLORIDA PROJECT was initially distributed digitally; we are proud to present the Chicago premiere of this unique print.",
