Six days after shooting finished for \"The Holy Terror\" (no. 83), the 'start' date arrived for \"Wiggle Your Ears\" on Dec. 4th. Shooting continued until the 'finish' date of Dec. 12th. Robert F. McGowan directed on each of the shooting dates. However, it should be noted that Anthony Mack simultaneously directed footage for \"Fast Freight\" (no. 85) on Dec. 10th, 11th and 12th, and continued with this film after \"Wiggle Your Ears\" finished. No shooting took place on Dec. 9th, which was a Sunday.\n\nThe first reel of this film ends at the point where Mary Ann talks with her mouth full.\n\nThe 16-inch disc masters containing the music and sound effects were Victor matrix MVE-50608 (for reel 1) and Victor matrix MVE-50609 (for reel 2). The takes were all recorded at the Church Bldg. in Camden, NJ. The takes for reel 1 were numbered 1, 1A, 2, and 2A, while the takes for reel 2 were also numbered 1, 1A, 2, and 2A. In neither case is a master take indicated. The orchestra was made up of 22 men. The Victor ledgers use the word \"Inaudible\" to indicate that the soundtrack contains no dialogue or other closely synchronized sound.\n\nThe opening theme of \"That Old Gang Of Mine\" was dubbed onto the soundtracks of \"Shivering Shakespeare\" (no. 95), \"The First Seven Years\" (no. 96), \"When The Wind Blows\" (no. 97) and \"A Tough Winter\" (no. 99) from the reel one disc for this film. There was also a version of \"Moan & Groan, Inc.\" (no. 94) that included this recording, but it isn't clear if it was ever released that way.\n\nAmong the props seen in this film is a poster advertising Flapperette Face Cream.\n\nAround 1931, a four-minute trailer was made for Jean Darling's stage act, which culminated in the wedding scene from this film. Jean would then emerge from a breakaway screen wearing a wedding dress like the one she wears in the film.\n\nThe script submitted to MGM was given the catalog number B677.\n\navailability:\n\nThe Little Rascals XVIII (VHS) from Blackhawk Video\n\nThis copy is a home movie print from Blackhawk, and includes a textual introduction. The inter-titles and the soundtrack are original. The picture quality is good. The print totals 20:51, with 19:56 of it original footage. Almost all of the original film is included.\n\nOur Gang Volume #13 (VHS) from Grapevine Video and also from The Picture Palace\n\nThis copy is also the Blackhawk print, but with the company name blacked out and a non-original soundtrack.
