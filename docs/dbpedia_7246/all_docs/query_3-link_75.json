Deposition given in Los Angeles County concerning the part he played in the careers of Laurel and Hardy. In part: “From the days I opened my own studio in this silent film era, I endeavored to get away from the limited traditions of comic producers such as Mack Sennett and establish plots and formats instead of gags. Stanley Laurel had been a comedian in England and had been playing ‘bit’ comedy roles as an actor in my employ. Somewhat later, I employed Oliver Hardy as a ‘bit’ actor, mostly in the ‘heavy,’ or villain roles. He was quite portly and was nicknamed ‘Babe.’ Although I owned and controlled the rapidly expanding studios, I personally participated in the actual productions, either as author, creator, director and producer in every production, and sometimes in all capacities; in every case, I supervised all activities. The first time I intentionally cast Stan Laurel and ‘Babe’ Hardy together was in a short subject in my ‘All Star Series’ entitled ‘Slipping Wives.’ In the next 6 or 7 silent shorts, I pitted these two actors against each other experimentally, and gradually and carefully built their relationship as a team. By trial and error, shooting and reshooting, story conferences, brain sessions, and other hard work, I, together with various of my other employee-associates, created, evolved and perfected the characteristics, mannerisms, dress, postures, gestures, grimaces, etc. that formed the whimsical atmosphere in which these two actors could frolic under my direction. They clicked with the public, as I knew and planned that they would. The atmosphere became familiar to the public, which anticipated with eagerness in every comedy the appearance and reappearance of the now familiar identifications, such as: the seedy but strictly formal clothes; the soiled wing collars and string ties; the somewhat shabby derby hats; Hardy’s tie-twiddle, and serious, frustrated look directly into the camera, his expressions of a ‘fine mess’; his rotating a middle finger before him before making a ‘smart’ decision; his rising ‘OH-OH-OH’ when matters became too much for him; Stan’s bursting into tears at his dilemmas; his scratching his tousled topknot; his usual subservience to Hardy’s bullying, occasionally turning into physical retaliation; his vacuous credulity, etc.…heir names and likenesses were used by the Hal Roach Studios in all sorts of publications and for toys, games and clothing, and the name and pattern of Laurel and Hardy became a vested and important item of commercial value. The famous Walt Disney was permitted by me to characterize them in a number of Disney’s own famous cartoons, and the major studios such as RKO and MGM, etc. asked and received permission from us for Laurel and Hardy to appear with our comedy routines in many feature pictures other than Hal Roach Studios Productions…Hal Roach Studios, Inc., the Delaware corporation, has succeeded to my rights in the Laurel & Hardy films and I am currently acting as consultant to that firm.” A notarized County Clerk’s certificate is stapled to signature page as required by law. In fine condition. An amazing first hand account of the formation of one of Hollywood’s most lovable and successful comedy acts. Pre-certified PSA/DNA and RRAuction COA."
