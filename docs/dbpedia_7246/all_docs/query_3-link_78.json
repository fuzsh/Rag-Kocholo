        "text": "Although most of this article was written in one night while Turner Classic Movies was televising a Laurel and Hardy film retrospective, I actually postponed and delayed completing the piece for a few weeks because I was having so much fun researching it. Eventually I finished the article, and it was published in Mad About Movies magazine in March 2007.\n\nIn times presumably less civilized and more savage than our own, opposing armies about to be joined in battle would find ways to communicate with each other the night before the bloodshed, and exchange simple amenities: Coffee beans, maybe, or sugar, tobacco, or bread.\n\nHad this been done on a grander scale—between generals, say, or kings—this simple common decency could’ve been called collusion, or consorting with the enemy, or even treason. But on the forward lines, among the men who were about to spill their blood for reasons they often didn’t even understand, it was just a way to pass the time and make life a little bit less miserable for a couple of hours.\n\nI remembered this historical footnote the other night while I was watching the movie Pardon Us on an all-night TV station during a Laurel and Hardy festival they were running. And while watching one particular scene in Pardon Us, I think I got a clue to the reason for the universal appeal and continuing popularity of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy.\n\nThe comedy pairing of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy has achieved an iconic status in popular culture. Like their contemporaries both real and imagined—Charlie Chaplin, King Kong, the Marxes, Frankenstein, and possibly Scarlett and Rhett—Stan and Ollie inhabit the rarefied air otherwise occupied by heroes of folklore, while other comedy teams of that era, like Clark and McCullough, Wheeler and Woolsey, Olsen and Johnson, the Wieres, the Ritzes, and the female combination of Todd, Pitts, and Kelly, are mostly forgotten today, except by the most dogged, determined and devoted of movie fans.\n\nPardon Us was originally planned as another typical Laurel and Hardy two-reeler from the Hal Roach comedy factory, not to be particularly distinguished in quality from The Laurel and Hardy Murder Case, which preceded it, or Another Fine Mess, which followed it. Originally entitled ‘The Rap,’ Pardon Us was supposed to exploit—like their 1927 silent short The Second Hundred Years—the comic possibilities of Stan and Ollie in a prison.\n\nHal Roach had approached the larger MGM studios with a request to allow his production crew to film the Laurel and Hardy prison short on the sets constructed for the Wallace Beery prison drama The Big House, released on June 14, 1930. And MGM’s president, Louis B. Mayer, had magnanimously acquiesced to the request, for a price: MGM wanted, in return, to borrow the services of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy as supporting players in an upcoming MGM feature, as the studio had done the previous year for The Rogue Song, a light opera fantasy piece produced by Irving Thalberg and directed by Lionel Barrymore, now considered lost.\n\nRoach, for reasons which remain obscure, rejected the deal. And instead of rescheduling production on ‘The Rap’ and moving along to the production of another, different Laurel and Hardy short subject, Roach ordered the construction of a prison set on his own lot, at an expense such that the only way to recoup his investment would be to expand ‘The Rap’ beyond its two-reel origin and film instead the first ‘official’ Laurel and Hardy feature film.\n\nWhile MGM’s The Rogue Song had been filmed as a feature—in the more expensive two-strip Technicolor process, no less—it had been a film vehicle showcasing MGM’s investment in opera singer Lawrence Tibbott, and a moderately successful one at that, but not a film starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy as the leading characters.\n\nCertainly The Rogue Song was not an ‘official’ Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy film, or one which relied on any creative participation from the comedians beyond their actual physical appearance and their personalities. It is for that reason that Pardon Us is considered to be the first ‘official’ Laurel and Hardy feature film.\n\nStan Laurel, for one, was sensitive to the notion of Laurel and Hardy abandoning even temporarily their short-subject origins for the expanded feature-length comedy format. Correctly or incorrectly, Laurel felt that it might be too much to ask for audiences in general and fans in particular to follow along for an hour or more of their nonsense. As Laurel stated unpretentiously so many times during his later years while listening to plaudits and accolades extolling the comedy team’s contributions to the art of motion picture comedy, “I mean, we were just two-reel comics. That wasn’t art.”\n\nBut producing ‘The Rap’—soon renamed Pardon Us—as a feature would allow Roach to charge a higher licensing rate from film distribution companies, both across the country and around the world. The popularity of Laurel and Hardy was international; since the advent of talking pictures, Stan and Ollie had been routinely filming alternate foreign language versions of many of their pictures, for release in Mexico and Canada, and throughout Europe\n\nFor Pardon Us, Laurel and Hardy stalwart James—Jimmy—Finlayson was cast in his usual showcase role as the boys’ comic foil, displaying his distinctive and masterful ‘double take and fade away,’ which Stan always got a kick out of. Finlayson in this film played a schoolteacher performing social reform duties inside the prison. Prolific, bald-pated character actor Walter Long landed a plum role as ‘The Tiger,’ a hardened prison inmate whom at first antagonizes, and then befriends, Stan and Ollie.\n\nLong, who strongly resembled popular character actor Lon Chaney—it’s easy to imagine Chaney, who died of throat cancer simultaneous to the Laurel and Hardy production, playing the ‘Tiger’ role in Pardon Us—had himself appeared earlier that same year as Miles Archer, the ill-fated partner to Ricardo Cortez’ detective Sam Spade, in the original Warner Bros. film version of Dashiell Hammett’s The Maltese Falcon, also known as Dangerous Female, co-starring Bebe Daniels and Dudley Digges (the doomed actress Thelma Todd, an occasional Laurel and Hardy co-star and a gifted comedienne in her own right, played Archer’s wife in the film).\n\nPardon Us began production during the middle summer of 1930, with James Parrott—the troubled, alcoholic brother of actor/director Charles Parrott, also a star of Hal Roach comedies under the name Charlie Chase—as the credited director and H.M. Walker credited as the dialogue writer. It is likely, however, that Stan Laurel’s creative participation in the production extended beyond his credited acting, and into both writing and directing. The production of Pardon Us continued through the summer of 1930, after which the picture was edited to a sleek 65 minutes and completed for an August 15, 1931 release.\n\nIn Pardon Us, Stan and Ollie are arrested and sent to prison for accidentally selling a cop a bottle of beer; this was during Prohibition, remember, as well as the Great Depression. And eventually Laurel and Hardy escape their inadvertent incarceration by joining a group of sharecroppers—African-Americans—picking cotton in the fields surrounding the prison.\n\nThis scene is usually overlooked or dismissed in critical pieces detailing the career and films of Laurel and Hardy, but might be worth another brief glance, if only to examine the reasons for the enduring popularity of Stan and Ollie among people of all generations, nationalities, religions, and races, even for those among us who were born long after the deaths of the legendary comics.\n\nDuring the scene, the African-American sharecroppers are portrayed in the stereotypical manner popular in American films of the 1930s: Happy, simple folk, going about their duties with little thought, singing spiritual songs, contented with their lot, and smiling at each other a great deal.\n\nLaurel and Hardy join the African-American sharecroppers and walk away from the prison by disguising themselves as African-American sharecroppers: Donning worn bib overalls and straw hats and, courtesy of a conveniently-located mud patch, accidentally darkening their faces and hands. But they in no way alter their screen personae: Laurel and Hardy are still Stan and Ollie, Fat and Skinny, Dumb and Dumber.\n\nThe comedians resist the temptation to condescend to racial stereotype or patronize their temporary new companions by intentionally attempting to imitate their actions or mannerisms. And it takes a moment to sink in, but the denouement of the scenario is a whopper:\n\nBy not altering their customary mannerisms, Stan and Ollie fit right in with their new companions, in the process erasing the divisions of racial stereotypes, obliging the audience to look past the buffoonery—audiences in general were well aware that Laurel and Hardy were actors playing roles—and forcing the viewer to see both the white people and the black people depicted in the scene not as two racially-distinctive groups but as people. Period.\n\nAnd the scene continues: After walking away from the prison in the company of the African-American sharecroppers, Laurel and Hardy are shown later that night, still darkened, still in the company of the Africans, sitting in front of a communal house and enjoying the evening: Listening to the sounds, basking in the warmth of the night and the harmony of the music being performed on the porch. Stan and Ollie clearly are having the time of their lives, content with their easy camaraderie with their new friends, and they are in turn accepted among those new friends with warmth, and with no questions asked.\n\nOllie spontaneously joins in with the music by singing the early twentieth-century ballad Lazy Moon with his beautiful, and somewhat unexpected, tenor voice (Hardy had originally been a juvenile singer in minstrel shows and in vaudeville). A quartet of sharecroppers contributes harmonic vocal accompaniment to Hardy’s lovely solo. The easygoing performance of the musical number is surprising to the point of being literally delightful. Later in the song, and just as spontaneously, Stanley stands up from his seat on the porch steps to contribute a ridiculous and absurd but still delicately—elegantly—graceful soft-shoe dance. Who knew?\n\nAnyone who’s seen Gone With the Wind knows how African-Americans were portrayed in Hollywood during the 1930s. And the scenes with Laurel and Hardy in the company of the African-Americans in Pardon Us—which was made eight years before Gone With the Wind—could certainly be viewed as jaw-droppingly insensitive, politically incorrect, and flat out bizarre. D.W. Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation is still viewed with controversy, suspicion, and hostility—and rightfully so—at this present time, nearly a full century after its original release, in 1915.\n\nBut there’s nothing ugly about the scene in Pardon Us. It’s as innocent and lovely as the pastoral blind hermit scene in James Whale’s 1935 Bride of Frankenstein, but more relevant, I think, to both the 1930s and the present day. It’s as if Ollie and Stanley walk right up to an enormous chasm, look across it, realize the gulf is not so big after all, and smile it across to see if the people on the other side can see what they see: That what separates us is not as unbridgeable as we’ve been led to believe. The scene is innocent instead of ugly because Stan and Ollie are too childlike to be furtive. They are not mocking their black companions; they are trying desperately hard to fit in.\n\n“I am quite satisfied with my job as a comedian,” Stan Laurel would claim repeatedly over the years whenever asked by journalists or writers about his artistic ambitions and aspirations. Laurel doggedly insisted on remaining in his public life—and his private life too—politically unaffiliated and culturally neutral during times of swift changes, social upheavals, and reforms both politically- and racially-motivated.\n\nLaurel’s more successful friend, former stage colleague and roommate, fellow Englishman and comic, and later--during the Laurel and Hardy comedy team’s stint with United Artists--erstwhile employer Charlie Chaplin polarized America by wearing his political opinions and affiliations upon his sleeve as a naïve badge of honor, and ultimately was hounded from his adopted American homeland and into European exile because of it.\n\nIn contrast, Stan Laurel was able to eventually retire with his customary grace and aplomb into a new role as a sort-of elder statesman of film comedy. Laurel remained listed until the end of his life in the Santa Monica telephone directory, and his modest home remained open to friends the world over. From the new, temporary kings of film, stage, and television comedy—Jerry Lewis tried for years to lure Laurel back to the movies, as a consultant to Lewis’ slapstick brand of humor—to the most loyal and ardent of his fans, the children, the world beat a path to Stanley’s door, and that door always remained open. While the more critically-acclaimed Chaplin grew to be hated and vilified in his lifetime, the populist Laurel remained loved by the entire world.\n\nBut Stan was also very much the child of his father. Laurel’s biographers tell us that while Stanley was apathetic at best toward that father for his treatment of his family domestically, he admired and tried to emulate him professionally—as a music hall showman, if not as an entrepreneur—and idolized him for his social consciousness and his real concern for the less-fortunate people, particularly the children, in the repressed British coal-mining communities where he later opened and operated theatres.\n\nArthur Jefferson, Stan’s father—Laurel’s real name was Stanley Jefferson; the name Stan Jefferson contains thirteen letters, and Stan was superstitious—was noted for supplying shoes and socks to disadvantaged children and arranging special matinee performances for audiences who wouldn’t otherwise be able to attend theatrical presentations. Jefferson also distributed luxuries such as packages of tobacco, sugar and tea to the adult patrons as they arrived. His son watched and observed with genuine pride in his father’s decency. As such, the adult Stanley was unlikely to attempt to elicit a laugh at the expense of social, or racial, repression.\n\nOliver Hardy’s social consciousnesses, and the reasons for them, are somewhat less obscure but no less compelling: Self-described until his dying day as a “proud son of the South,” Oliver Hardy—or “Babe,” as he was known to just about everyone who ever knew him—left his Georgia homeland in 1915 shortly after the brutal lynching there of businessman and factory owner Leo Frank.\n\nFrank had been convicted on dubious evidence of the rape and murder of a young female employee, Mary Phagan, and sentenced to death. Georgia governor John Slaton, persuaded of at least a reasonable doubt in the matter of Frank’s guilt, commuted Frank’s sentence to life imprisonment, but a lynch mob attacked the prison farm where Frank was serving his sentence, kidnapped him, and hanged him from a tree.\n\nLeo Frank had been a prominent member of the Atlanta Jewish community, and his murder is still considered to be among the most significant anti-Semitic events in American history. Frank’s Atlanta trial had been national news and Oliver Hardy, at the time twenty-three years old and a resident of Atlanta, had surely been aware of it: During that trial, Hardy had married his sweetheart, Madelyn Saloshin, a young Jewish woman, and Frank’s lynching death had taken place in the woods outside Milledgeville, Babe Hardy’s hometown.\n\nPostcards depicting Leo Frank’s hanging—which, along with the success of Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation led to the national revival of the Ku Klux Klan—sold for years throughout Georgia and the American south, as did pieces of commemorative rope. After the lynching, Babe Hardy and his wife Madelyn left Georgia forever. Hardy never returned home. He was not a racist or a bigot, and he was ashamed of his countrymen.\n\nBut for whatever the reason or reasons, the pastoral scenes depicting Laurel and Hardy in the company of the African-Americans in Pardon Us work beautifully: For a few moments, everyone’s joined together, black and white, and they’re making the best of what they have. Their motives might differ after a fashion, but they’re all joined together temporarily with the feeling of simple accomplishment in having gotten themselves through another miserable, rotten day with the company of their friends, old and new, and they all are still enjoying that company of friends well into the night.\n\nThe best of the Laurel and Hardy comedies—and Pardon Us is usually not listed as one of them—are about social injustice: Stan and Ollie endure the slights, the petty hostilities, and the casual unfairnesses of mankind, and they always come back with smiles on their faces and a renewed sense of trust in the essential goodness of society as a whole; they are the eternal optimists in times of bitter pessimism, then and now, and now as then.\n\nAnd if the African-Americans are portrayed in Pardon Us as simpletons and menial-laborers, they seem to be knowing and observant of the fact, while Laurel and Hardy are portrayed as nothing: They just simply are childish fools and imbeciles, inferiors to people who know that they—themselves—are being treated as inferiors. Pardon the grammar, but there’s just no other way to express this as forcefully: Nobody doesn’t feel that way sometimes.\n\nThe African-American sharecroppers in Pardon Us are happy to be at peace that night among their families and friends, but Stan and Ollie are just happy to be anywhere they’re not being picked on and hounded and kicked at and persecuted. You get the real sense that they’ll stay there forever if they’re permitted to. And if pickin’ cotton’s what it takes to get along in a world full of smart, or rich, or mean, or successful, or more intelligent, people, they’ll start pickin’ cotton. Happily.\n\nWhile Laurel and Hardy might’ve relied occasionally on a corny gag or a stale setup, there never was a low blow or a cheap joke: Had the African-Americans in Pardon Us been simply and solely the basis for a quick, throwaway gag, the scene would’ve ended with the actual, physical escape from the prison, and would’ve left a bitter aftertaste. Genuine human affection continued the scene onto the porch steps. And by association, it was that same sense of genuine human affection for mankind and the human comedy which carried Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy into the pantheon of folklore, where they reside to this day.\n\nTomorrow is still ahead, and it might be full of grief, and meanness—probably will be—but for an hour or so in Pardon Us everybody’s friendly and happy, and they’re all sharing their happiness with their friends and their loved ones.\n\nCan there be anything better than that?\n\nAfterword: In a triumph of cinematic irony, fifteen years prior to the production of Pardon Us, co-star Walter Long had appeared, in blackface makeup, as Gus, the savage and uncivilized African-American villain who attempts to rape Mae Marsh’s virginal Flora Cameron in Griffith’s landmark 1915 film The Birth of a Nation. As an ‘honorable’ alternative to forced interracial sexual congress at the hands of the freed slave, Flora leaps from a cliff to her death, setting into motion the series of events which lead to the eventual reemergence of reason and order at the hands of the masked and hooded saviors from the Ku Klux Klan. Griffith's picture with its reprehensible depiction of African-Americans and veneration of the Ku Klux Klan remains a flashpoint of controversy to this day, more than a century after its original release.\n\nThe murder of Mary Phagan and the resulting Leo Frank trial are depicted in the 1937 film They Won’t Forget, directed by Mervyn LeRoy. The film is noted for being the famous ‘sweater girl’ role which catapulted actress Lana Turner, in the Phagan role, to stardom. The case was also the basis for the 1988 made-for-television movie The Murder of Mary Phagan, starring Jack Lemmon as Georgia governor John Slaton and Peter Gallagher as Leo Frank. In 1998, the case was adapted by writer/musician Jason Robert Brown into a short-lived but Tony Award-winning Broadway musical, Parade, which is still revived periodically.\n\nAs noted in the text of the article, during the early days of talking films, some of the higher-profile pictures were produced either simultaneously or back-to-back for French- or Spanish-speaking audiences overseas. Frequently the same stars appeared in all versions of the film, but often there were exceptions. In the French-language version of Pardon Us, entitled Sous les Verrous, the Walter Long role--\"Le Tigre\"--was performed by an ominous and glowering Boris Karloff, still a few months away from his breakthrough role in James Whale's Frankenstein."
