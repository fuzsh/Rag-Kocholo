        "text": "10. A-HAUNTING WE WILL GO (1942)\n\nDirected by Alfred L. Werker. Written by Lou Breslow and Stanley Rauh. Starring Dante the Magician, Sheila Ryan, John Shelton, Don Costello, Elisha Cook Jr.\n\nThings get spooky for Laurel and Hardy in “A-Haunting We Will Go,” a mishmash of crime, sorcery and death. The two star as a pair of traveling hobos who get involved with a gang of violent criminals who want them to transport one of their own in a coffin. But they soon get their cargo mixed up with another casket containing Dante the Magician (playing himself), much to the gangsters’ ire.\n\n9. THE BULLFIGHTERS (1945)\n\nDirected by Malcolm St. Clair. Written by Scott Darling. Starring Margo Woode, Richard Lane, Carol Andrews, Diosa Costello, Ralph Sanford.\n\nIn “The Bullfighters,” Laurel and Hardy play a pair of bumbling detectives whose hunt for a female arsonist leads them south of the border. While in Mexico, Stan is mistaken for a famous matador and is put into the ring. At the same time, he has to hide out from a vengeful sports promoter (Ralph Sanford) who spent time behind bars due to his testimony. Laurel wrote and directed portions of the film, which was adapted in part from their short “Going Bye-Bye!” (1934).\n\n8. PARDON US (1931)\n\nDirected by James Parrott. Written by H.M Walker. Starring June Marlowe, Wilfred Lucas, James Finlayson, Walter Long, Tiny Sandford, Charlie Hall.\n\nAfter years of successful shorts, Laurel and Hardy made their feature film debut with this comedic send-up of MGM’s searing prison drama “The Big House” (shot, in fact, on the same set). The boys are sent to the slammer after selling beer during Prohibition. Though the pacing in this barely hour-long film is a slog, “Pardon Us” succeeds on the comedic chops of its inimitable duo, who would go on to greater triumph in subsequent outings.\n\n7. BLOCK-HEADS (1938)\n\nDirected by John G. Blystone. Written by Felix Adler, Arnold Belgard, Harry Langdon, James Parrott and Charley Rogers. Starring Patricia Ellis, Minna Gombell, Billy Gilbert, James Finlayson.\n\nIn “Block-Heads,” Laurel plays a World War I soldier who’s so loyal that he’s still guarding a trench in France 20 years after the Armistice. His best friend Ollie brings him back home, where he’s confronted by the modern world. Look out for clips from the war epics “The Big Parade” (1925), “Wings” (1927), and “All Quiet on the Western Front” (1930), which were used for the battle scenes. The film earned an Oscar nomination for its original score.\n\n6. SAPS AT SEA (1940)\n\nDirected by Gordon Douglas. Written by Felix Adler, Harry Langdon, Gil Pratt and Charley Rogers. Starring Richard Cramer, James Finlayson, Ben Turpin, Harry Bernard.\n\n“Saps at Sea” marked the end of an era for Laurel and Hardy, as it was their last film for producer Hal Roach (of “Little Rascals” fame). Ollie plays a horn factory employee driven mad by the instrument’s constant blaring (as his doctor puts it, he’s come down with a case of “Hornophobia”). His buddy Stan suggests they take a cruise to settle his nerves, yet they soon finds themselves at sea with an escaped madman (Richard Cramer).\n\n5. THE BOHEMIAN GIRL (1936)\n\nDirected by James W. Horne and Charley Rogers. Screenplay by Frank Butler, libretto by Alfred Bunn, based on the opera by Michael William Balfe. Starring Thelma Todd, Mae Busch, Antonio Moreno, Darla Hood, Jacqueline Wells, James Finlayson.\n\nLaurel and Hardy created one of their most delightful entertainments with this comedic adaptation of the famous Balfe opera. “The Bohemian Girl” casts Stan and Ollie as a pair of gypsies who adopt an abandoned baby found outside the kingdom. They raise the orphan girl as their own, unaware that she’s actually a princess. Stan and Ollie prove surprisingly capable handing the film’s musical bits, which blend well with the humor and pathos.\n\n4. THE FLYING DEUCES (1939)\n\nDirected by A. Edward Sutherland. Written by Ralph Spence, Charley Rogers, Fred Schiller and Harry Langdon. Starring Jean Parker, Reginald Gardiner, Charles B. Middleton, Jean Del Val, Clem Wilenchick, Jimmy Finlayson.\n\nIn “The Flying Deuces,” Stan and Ollie head off to France, where the fat man falls head-over-heels in love with an innkeeper’s beautiful daughter (Jean Parker). Only problem is, she’s very much devoted to her husband, a dashing Foreign Legion officer (Reginald Gardiner). The two decide to join the army to help Ollie get over his romantic troubles, which turns out to be an even bigger mistake than they could’ve ever imagined (albeit an hilarious one).\n\n3. WAY OUT WEST (1937)\n\nDirected by James W. Horne. Screenplay by Charley Rogers, Felix Adler and James Parrott, story by Jack Jevne and Rogers. Starring Sharon Lynn, James Finlayson, Rosina Lawrence, Stanley Fields, Vivien Oakland, The Avalon Boys.\n\nStan and Ollie strike comedic gold with this western spoof. In “Way Out West,” the duo are entrusted by an old prospector with delivering the deed to a gold mine to his poor daughter (Rosina Lawrence), who lives with an evil saloon owner (frequent co-star James Finlayson). When they arrive, Finlayson tries to swindle them into believing his wife (Sharon Lynn) is the girl they’re looking for. The film is perhaps best known for its famous soft-shoe routine, not to mention its Oscar-nominated score.\n\n2. BABES IN TOYLAND (1934)\n\nDirected by Gus Meins and Charley Rogers. Screenplay by Frank Butler and Nick Grinde, based on the operetta by Victor Herbert. Starring Charlotte Henry, Felix Knight, Henry Kleinbach, Florence Roberts, Virginia Karns.\n\nThe best of Laurel and Hardy’s musical pictures is this sweet-natured adaptation of Victor Herbert’s classic operetta. “Babes in Toyland” casts them as Stanley Dum and Ollie Dee, two apprentices to a master toymaker in a magical land. They attempt to keep Little Bo-Peep (Charlotte Henry) from the evil Barnaby Barnicle (Henry Brandon), only to have his henchmen descend of Toyland. Also known as “March of the Wooden Soldiers,” this charming fairy tale puts modern children’s films to shame.\n\n1. SONS OF THE DESERT (1933)\n\nDirected by William A. Seiter. Written by Frank Craven. Starring Charley Chase, Mae Busch, Dorothy Christy, Lucien Littlefield.\n\nThe jewel in Laurel and Hardy’s crown, “Sons of the Desert” centers on two lodge members who trick their wives into thinking they’re going on a medicinal cruise, when in fact they’re heading off to a fraternal convention. When the boat they’re supposed to be on suddenly sinks, their grief-stricken spouses find out the truth, and the boys have to find a way to keep their deception going. Filled with one hilarious bit after another, anchored by the inimitable chemistry between Stan and Ollie."
