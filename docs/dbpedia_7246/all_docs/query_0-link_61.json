        "text": "An excitable young lady has purchased the latest model in an upright piano and has instructed the proprietor of the store to deliver it immediately as a surprise birthday present for her equally excitable husband. The job is assigned to Laurel & Hardy's Transfer Co. (foundered in 1931) who pull up in the street with the piano on the back of their horse and cart. Ollie asks a passing postman (Charlie Hall) for directions to the address. He informs the boys that the house they want is right at the top of a set of steep steps. Ollie, thinking he knows best tells Stan to ease the piano off the back of the cart and down onto his back, as he crouches in the road. The horse overhears this and seems to deliberately move forward, which sends the heavy instrument crashing down onto Hardy's back.\n\nAfter carrying the piano across the street the boys begin their ascent of the many steps that lie ahead with Ollie pulling and Stan pushing. Shortly into their quest they encounter a nursemaid with a pram who aks for them to allow her enough room to pass. Ollie is more than keen to accommodate her request, but when Stan lends a hand he pushes the pram straight into the unguarded piano, sending it flying back down the steps from where it came. The boys go chasing after it as the woman laughs hysterically at their misfortunes. Incensed by this blatant show of mocking of them Stan takes an extraordinary decision to kick her in the rear for it. She hits him and Ollie laughs and receives a glass bottle of milk over his head for his troubles. The boys resume their quest to scale the steps for a second go, oblivious to the fact they have now been reported to a policeman (Sam Lufkin) by the nursemaid. He catches up to them and an exhausted Ollie is summoned down to explain himself. As Ollie makes his way down the steps the piano takes on a mind of its own and chases after him. He drops to the floor and the piano overtakes him, all the way back to the bottom of the steps. The cop reprimands Ollie for the assault on the nurse despite his pleas of innocence but Stan takes exception to the officer's aggressive resolve and gets a baton over his head for speaking out of place. A third attempt to deliver the piano encounters a rather loud and obnoxious professor (Billy Gilbert) walking down the steps. He, believing to be superior to the boys, refuses to move for them and after a shoving match with the box, Stan hits the professor's top hat off, which bounces all the way down to the bottom of the steps before being crushed by a passing vehicle. The boys regard this as a small victory and they find the motivation to resume lugging the piano up the steps. Ollie doesn't realise he has reached the summit and urges Stan into one last effort. The last push sends Ollie backwards into a fountain.\n\nDespite a few glares at Stan, Ollie seems to silently accept it was an accident; climbs out and makes the short walk to the front door of the house to ring the doorbell. As Stan follows behind, the piano rolls back off and amazingly does a 45 degrees turn to the right and begins its descent of the steps once more. Ollie runs after it and manages to grab ahold of the end before both make the trip back to the bottom of the steps. That afternoon - Stan and Ollie once more reach the top of the steps and are seen by the postman again who, upon the realisation they have lugged the heavy instrument all the way up the steps, offers a much more practical solution that they ought to have just loaded it onto their cart and driven it up the side road that leads to the top of the hill. With incredible stupidity the boys take his advice and take the piano all the way back down the steps just so they can then bring it up to where they already are with the cart.\n\nOllie goes down on all fours again so that Stan can lower the piano onto his back from the cart but then remembers the previous occasion when he tried this and this time unfastens the horse's reins. Ollie pushes the piano towards the front door with Stan standing on the end and getting a free ride. There is a brilliant moment as he jumps off and Ollie is not sure what he has just seen!\n\nThey ring the doorbell (which they break in the process) but discover nobody to be at home, so Ollie organises a way for them to take the piano through an upstairs window which is open, and then place it in the downstairs living room. Armed with a block and tackle (which suddenly appears from nowhere) they hoist up the piano to the upstairs balcony. When the piano is safely up, Stan detaches the cable and throws it carelessly away. It lands on Ollie's head, who is underneath the piano and sends him crashing down to the ground and through the front door! As Ollie makes his way up the stairs (MORE stairs!) Stan calls out after him, saying he heard someone at home. A frustrated Ollie confesses it was he and throws his hat up at Stan in annoyance. The hats are mixed up and each ultimately end up wearing each other's hats. Ollie enters the bedroom and is first hit in the face by Stan having not seen him, and then falls through another balcony door and back into the fountain outside, this time with the piano going in straight after him! Stan soon follows as he tries to throw Ollie's hat back at him. The boys enter the house (again) and Ollie tells Stan to open the wooden box whilst he looks around for a place to put it (he promptly sits down on a chair to watch Stan!) The opened box spews out gallons of water all over the carpet, Ollie treads on a plank of wood with nails sticking through and Stan drops a lightbulb onto Ollie's head all in the space of a few seconds.\n\nMeanwhile the loud-mouthed professor whom they encountered earlier has also reported the boys to the same police officer before making his way back up the long flight of steps. He arrives at the house where the boys are now dancing to the musical melodies being played by the electric piano they have plugged in. The professor declares himself to be the owner of the property and after confessing to hating (and detesting) pianos, promptly takes an axe to it. There is a brief pause as it churns out the National Anthem, and then the axe versus piano continues. The professor's wife walks in and explains everything and the embarrassed professor apologizes to Stan and Ollie. The final straw comes when they ask for him to sign the delivery acknowledgement only to have the pen explode with ink in his face. The boys run out of the house."
