        "text": "My favorite comedy duo of all time, Laurel and Hardy made classic shorts together from 1927 (when they made their first official short as a double act called Putting Pants on Philip) to 1935 when they created their last short, Thicker than Water. Since Pardon Us (1931), their initial feature movie, their films had started to take over from their shorts. While most of the time, these movies weren’t as good as the shorts, a few like Sons of the Desert (1933), Our Relations (1936), Way Out West (1937), Block-Heads (1938) and A Chump at Oxford (1940) were classic comedys, still fondly remembered to this day. After 1940, they moved away from Hal Roach where they had made all previous films and went to pastures new. But in the new studios, the two were denied their creative freedom and as a result, the last dozen movies “the Boys” (as they were nick-named) made were weak and best foregotten.\n\nBut let us remember them in their greatest moments, forever captured on film with brilliant shorts like The Music Box, Big Business and Towed in a Hole.\n\nI’m not a fan (I do like some of the shorts though, especially the ones John mentioned), but I know some others are\n\nThey were very popular when I was a kid, and even more popular some 20-25 years ago\n\nThey were on television almost every day, not only on Dutch television, also on Belgian, British, French, German and Italian television, and nearly everybody was a fan (or pretented to be one, it was ‘cool’ to be a L&H fan back then). Today you don’t see them that often on TV, and when you ask colleagues or friends about them, they start talking about them as if they’re mere memories (Oh yes, I used to …). Younger people tend to dislike them or just find them okay but not particularly funny.\n\nThis aspect, their faded glory (although they’re of course still well-known), fascinates me more than anything else about them\n\nEnnioo and Chris, Did you know that Harold Lloyd lost the thumb and first finger on his right hand around the time he created the famous character with the glasses character? Incredible, but true. He did all those incredible stunts after losing the gripping power of his strongest hand. He wore a special glove with a fake thumb and finger which when photographed in films looked amazingly real. Since Lloyd always fought to keep his disability a secret few knew to look for it. If you look carefully you can sometimes notice it.\n\nLloyd was great prior to sound. Like most silent comedians I find his work after sound sub par. Also, like most silent comedians I often find the shorts better than the later feature length films.\n\nBACK ON TOPIC: Laurel and Hardy were amazing. Agreed, the feature length films (especially the dreadful later ones) were nowhere near the quality of the short films.\n\nI can not recall the title but my favorite L&H film is the one where they have to deliver a piano up a giant staircase. Of course they keep getting near the top and dropping it all the way to the bottom. (Later we find the door on the other side of the house is at street level).\n\nBut my personal all time favorite early slapstick comedies are the Fatty Arbuckle films with Buster Keaton as his straight faced side kick. Not a bad film in the bunch. A handful of them are quite bizarre and surreal. And Keaton’s brilliant, legendary comedies are really a continuation of the type of material he did with Arbuckle. Keaton was another great one whose work in sound film is dreadful. The main reason for that for his final silent film (and subsequent talkies) he switched to a larger hollywood studio and lost creative control. The studio didn’t get or want the elaborate idea gags and the subtlety was gone from his work. Then to really screw the guy they but him on the bottom half of a team with Jimmy Durante.
