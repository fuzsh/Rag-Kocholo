        "text": "The monumental staircase in the film still exists; it is in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles, between 923 and 935 Vendome Street. There are 131 steps.\n\nA special police squad was on duty at the Vendome Street staircase over the course of the four-day location shoot to keep more than 3,500 onlookers and fans from interfering with the production. During their lunch breaks, Laurel & Hardy reportedly signed about 2,000 autographs.\n\nThe mansion at the top of the stairs was not really at the top of the stairs, but was a set on the Hal Roach Studios lot. The actual stairs led to a cul-de-sac.\n\nNearly 90 years after this short was made, the filming location remains a popular tourist attraction. The site is marked with a marble plaque and a street sign that reads \"Music Box Steps\"."
