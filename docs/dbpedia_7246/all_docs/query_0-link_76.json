I want that other monkey.\n\n[Stan whistles to Ollie]\n\nOllie:\n\nWhat?\n\nStan:\n\nHe doesn't want me! He wants the other monkey!\n\n[Ollie looks around]\n\nStan:\n\nYou!\n\nOllie:\n\nOh.\n\nNursemaid:\n\n[as Stan and Ollie try to help her get her baby carriage around the piano box, it suddenly slides back down the stairs. Stan and Ollie frantically chase after it and catch the box after it stops in the street. The Nursemaid finds this hilarious and laughs uproariously as Stan and Ollie pull the piano box back onto the curb. Stan glares at her as she continues laughing at their misfortune] Of all the dumb things! [She continues laughing. Becoming fed up with her, Stan kicks her in the behind] OW! [She punches Stan in the face, so hard it knocks his hat off]\n\nOllie:\n\nAH HA HA HA HA, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! [the Nursemaid grabs a glass baby bottle from the carriage and removes Ollie's hat] AHHH ha ha ha ha ha! [She breaks the bottle over Ollie's head, instantly ceasing his laughter]\n\nProf. von Schwarzenhoffen:\n\n[the piano is blocking his path] Well? Either of you two numbskulls going to take this thing out of the way?\n\nOllie:\n\nWhat's it to you?\n\nProf. von Schwarzenhoffen:\n\nI should like to pass.\n\nOllie:\n\nWhy don't you walk around?\n\nProf. von Schwarzenhoffen:\n\nWalk around? Me? Professor Theodore Von Schwarzenhoffen? M.D., A.D, D.D.S, F.L.D, F.F.F und F should walk around? Get that thing out of my way! Go on, out of the way!\n\n[Stan slaps his hat off. It flies into the street and is flattened by a truck]\n\nProf. von Schwarzenhoffen:\n\nVery nice. I'll have you arrested for this! I'll have you thrown in jail! I'm professor T.D.A!\n\nOllie:\n\nWhat were you doing up there?\n\nStan:\n\nI was trying to plug it in.\n\nOllie:\n\nThat's not the place to plug it in! Give it to me!\n\nStan:\n\n[whistles] Hey, Ollie!\n\nOllie:\n\n[walks out of the house and looks up at him] What?\n\nStan:\n\nThere's somebody home.\n\nOllie:\n\nAre they up there?\n\nStan:\n\nNo, I heard them coming up the stairs.\n\nOllie:\n\nYou heard them coming up... Why stupid, that was me!\n\nStan:\n\nThat was you?\n\nOllie:\n\nWhy certainly.\n\nStan:\n\nWell how'd you get in the house?\n\nOllie:\n\nWell I was standing on the ladder while you were pulling the piano up and the block and tack... [angrily throws his hat up at Stan] Get back in there! Throw me my hat! [Stan randomly grabs a hat and tosses it down, unknowingly it is his own] \"Heard'em coming up the stairs.\"\n\nPoliceman:\n\nSay, what do you mean by molesting that girl?\n\nOllie:\n\nWho, me?\n\nPoliceman:\n\nYes, you.\n\nOllie:\n\nWhy I was just...\n\n[the policeman kicks him]\n\nPoliceman:\n\nNow let that be a lesson to ya.\n\n[walks away]\n\nStan:\n\nAre you going to stand for that?\n\nOllie:\n\nSay listen, if he'd have said one more word to me, I would've...\n\n[notices the policeman had returned; laughs nervously]\n\nPoliceman:\n\n[kicks Ollie again] Now let that be *another* lesson. [chucks him under the chin with the head of his truncheon]\n\n[last lines]\n\nProf. von Schwarzenhoffen:\n\nGentlemen, is there anything I can do to show you how sorry I am?\n\nOllie:\n\n[smiling] Just sign here. Service with a smile. Stanley, the pen.\n\nProf. von Schwarzenhoffen:\n\n[as he takes the top off the pen, ink explodes into the Professor's face] Why you... Out of my house! OUT OF MY HOUSE!"
