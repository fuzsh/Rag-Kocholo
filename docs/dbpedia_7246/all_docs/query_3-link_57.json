jazz.\n\n-The music was the salvation.\n\nIt was like sports is today.\n\nIt's like basketball.\n\nThat was it.\n\nWe'd go to sit in the theaters on Saturdays all day with our lunch and watch these wonderful musicians.\n\n-My father bought me my first set of drums for graduating elementary school.\n\nThat was the only gift I wanted.\n\nAnd I would set the drum up right so that when I got out of my bed in the mornings to go to school, my bed was the drum seat.\n\nSo I would get up in the morning before I'd go to school and actually just sit at them drums and imagine that I was Papa Jo or Big Sidney Catlett.\n\nI couldn't play that early and couldn't wait to get home.\n\nNow this is 13, 14.\n\n-Right.\n\n-So after I finished whatever chores my family had for me to do and finished my homework, just sit down and play them drums until it was -- until the neighbors would come to the door and say, \"Well, Mrs. Roach, that boy is just making too much noise.\"\n\n[ Drumming ] ♪♪ ♪♪ But that kind of discipline, you become almost a fanatic to it after you get involved in it.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ [ Applause ] -And so once again, ladies and gentlemen, we take our WMCA microphones right down to the Royal Roost, bringing you the new sound, Charlie Parker and the All-Stars -- Miles Davis on trumpet, the great Max Roach on drums.\n\n-We started the so-called bebop movement.\n\nWe had a little coalition of folks, if you will -- Dizzy and Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Monk, and Miles.\n\nWe all kind of clung together.\n\nFor whatever reasons, we related to each other, and we hated to sleep.\n\nWe would work from 9:00 till 9:00 the next morning in two different clubs.\n\n[ Up-tempo tune plays ] We would then go up to Dizzy's house on 7th Avenue and sit down and exchange ideas and talk about different musicians and analyze styles.\n\n-We were just young musicians.\n\nWherever the music was, we would go.\n\nSo I'd always go to Max's house and sit in the corner and watch and listen, 'cause he always had all the heavyweights there with this new music.\n\nSo one day, Max said, \"Hey, Randy, play one of your songs for Charlie Parker.\"\n\nMan, Sam, I was like this, 'cause Charlie Parker was not only a great musician, he was a powerful, spiritual human being.\n\nSomething about him was very sp-- I can't explain it.\n\n♪♪ -When Miles and I were working with Charlie Parker, his first piece would be his warm-up piece.\n\nIt'd be the fastest thing we'd perform for that night.\n\nAnd it would just destroy Miles and myself.\n\nYou know, I'd be puffing and blowing.\n\nMiles would be, you know, just -- it would just reduce us to nothing.\n\nHe'd just breeze through it.\n\nAnd we would practice all day to get ready for this gentleman.\n\nI had a lot of freedom working with Charlie Parker.\n\nHe would just write one sheet of music for Miles.\n\nHe'd write a trumpet part.\n\nAnd he'd look over at me and just tell me that I had freedom to do what I wanted to do.\n\nI would find my own way.\n\n[ Drumming ] -Early bebop just had that shock of the new.\n\nIt was just something challenging, intimidating.\n\nYou know, people just really couldn't figure out where you're supposed to pat your foot.\n\n[ Up-tempo tune plays ] And all of that is by design, you know?\n\nRhythmically, melodically, harmonically, they wanted to just get up in the music and then just start toying with every aspect of it.\n\n♪♪ There was a confrontational quality forcing the audience to receive them on their own terms.\n\nAnd, of course, it changed the content, the form, the virtuosity level of jazz forever.\n\n-It just blew my mind to hear music played as well as they did with this new flavor and new harmonic, and the speed.\n\n♪♪ -The first time I heard Bird's group, you know, it was interesting.\n\nI didn't dislike it, but eventually...\n\nI got what they were doing, you know?\n\nThen I realized that this was the music for our generation, what Charlie Parker was doing and Max.\n\n-There was no other kind of music for me but that.\n\nAnd night after night, Marlon Brando and myself and a couple of others just sit there and listen to one great genius after the other.\n\n♪♪ Bebop wasn't just being sweet and joyous like Louis Armstrong.\n\nIt came by as an outraged expression of the time in which we lived, and it found great synergy with young Black people.\n\n♪♪ -It was a new political feeling among the guys.\n\nYou know, this is right after the war, and Bird and Max and Miles exemplified that.\n\n♪♪ -I'm just so glad I came up with that kind of influence, because they were so progressive, and the goal was to get jazz musicians so they did not just have to entertain.\n\nThey wanted to be an artist just like Stravinsky.\n\n[ Down-tempo tune plays ] ♪♪ -In the late '40s, most artists used something before they'd perform to give them that lift, and marijuana -- that was the big thing, and also cocaine, but cocaine might be, like, New Year's Eve.\n\nThat was a rich man's drug.\n\nThen all of a sudden, the powers that be put out this drug that nobody ever heard of before.\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nIt doesn't smell, very cheap, gets you high, and nobody knows.\n\nNobody knew what it was.\n\nAnd they came with this heroin, and this thing spread.\n\n-And so you got in that stupid trend of everybody else, and that's what Trane and Miles and all of us did.\n\nBut we weren't the only ones.\n\nMax had delved, too.\n\n-I was in a bad way as far as drugs and other things were concerned.\n\nI got in trouble, and I got locked up.\n\nAnd my mother came to get me out of jail.\n\nShe did day work, and she scrubbed people's floors.\n\nAnd she came, she said, \"You know, son, I got calluses on my knees.\"\n\nAnd I thought she meant from scrubbing floors.\n\nSo I said, \"Mom, when I get out of this nonsense I'm in now, I'm gonna see to it that you don't have to do that anymore.\"\n\nShe said, \"No, son, I'm not talking about working.\n\nI'm talking about praying.\n\nI'm praying so hard for you to get your act together till my knees have calluses on them.\"\n\nAnd so I decided then I had to change my way of living.\n\nI went to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital that took me in was a Catholic hospital.\n\nAnd the next morning when I woke up, the sister came into my bed and said that I had a daughter.\n\nMy wife was in the hospital, and Maxine was born.\n\nFrom that day on, my life began to straighten itself out as far as drugs and all the other things that were concerned.\n\n-Max, you were very well known because of the many great records you've made with both Charlie and Dizzy.\n\nWhen did you form your own quintet?\n\n-This is about 1953 on the West Coast, and the great Clifford Brown, Harold Land, and Richie Powell and George Morrow.\n\nIt was the first quintet that we made some records with that caught on, I would say, among the jazz public.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ -The first time I saw Max Roach perform was in Chicago at a new nightclub called the Beehive.\n\n♪♪ It was Max and Clifford Brown, and one of my friends leaned over and said something.\n\n\"Max is playing so loud I can't hear the rest of the guys.\"\n\nYou know, and Clifford read his lips and turned around and said something to Max, and then Max immediately softened down.\n\nAnd I regarded Max as God, you know, and the fact that he could accept criticism from someone that was younger than he showed me what a sensitive musician he was in the first place, you know?\n\n♪♪ -When I formed the group with Clifford Brown, of course, then I began to do things that I would do as a leader.\n\nI was responsible for the direction that the group was going musically, et cetera.\n\nAnd I had a chance then to develop the things I felt were important to what I wanted to do with the music.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ -Beautiful.\n\nMax and Clifford Brown together?\n\nIncredible, man.\n\n♪♪ -Man, when we were kids in Philadelphia and they used to come, and we would be there for every note, 'cause it was Max leading one of the most exciting groups of our time, and Clifford was like a star out of nowhere.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ -Brownie was one of the most complete musicians I had worked with.\n\nHe could play drums, he played piano, and he was a good composer.\n\nWe shared an apartment together.\n\nAnd I had a piano in it, so every morning we'd wake up to see who would get to the piano first.\n\n♪♪ The beginning of this story, I had heard Clifford Brown originally on a record.\n\nI was in California at a place called the Lighthouse.\n\nI was there -- to go out there on a six-month contract.\n\nIt was about 1951.\n\nI'll never forget Howard Rumsey riding me up and down this beautiful enclave on the Pacific Ocean out there in California, trying to find an apartment.\n\nJohn Levine owned the Lighthouse, so finally Mr. Levine said, \"Listen, you know I'm Jewish, and I had to buy up half of the [bleep]damn town before I could get a place to live here.\"\n\nBut I'd heard Clifford on the record with J.J. Johnson.\n\nI'll never forget that record.\n\nI called him up, and he said, \"Fine,\" you know.\n\nHe was about 22 at that time.\n\nAnd he had a great sense of humor.\n\nHe never engaged in any kind of narcotics or anything like that.\n\nNever even drank, in fact.\n\nI think one thing that he did do that I found out about after we had been together about a year was he loved to play the horses.\n\n[ Laughter ] Now, that was a contradiction to such a clean living.\n\n-At the Rouge Lounge all this week is one of the great jazz groups in the country today, and that's the Max Roach Cliff

Roach.\n\nMax Roach was really the figure.\n\nHis drum style and everything was what the band was about, really.\n\nPlus, he was a god before I played with him.\n\nYeah, he was a great drummer, but then everybody knew Max as sort of a big celebrity in the Black community.\n\nI mean, it wasn't just the music community we knew him, but he then became like a movie star.\n\n-Go, Max!\n\n-[ Drumming
