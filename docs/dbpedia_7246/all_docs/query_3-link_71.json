        "text": "On Tue, 9/25/12, Joe Pantaleo <joeandxander at yahoo.com> wrote:\n\nmarkjcuccia at yahoo.com wrote:\n\nTwilight Zone was still filming at MGM for the Spring 1963\n\nhour-long season of 18 episodes, and even continued filming at MGM\n\nfor its 5th and final season (back to a half-hour) 1963/64. And\n\nMOST of TZ was filmed at MGM since the very beginning (although\n\nthe \"Where is Everybody\" pilot with Earl Holliman was filmed at\n\nUniversal-Intl). A handful of TZ ep's were filmed at the\n\ndeteriorated-soon-to-be-demolished Hal Roach facility nearby in\n\nCulver City,\n\nBTW, I forgot to mention that there was an earlier pilot that was\n\nwritten and/or produced by Rod Serling, called \"The Time Element\".\n\nIt did NOT air as \"Twilight Zone\" but as an episode of the anthology\n\n\"(Westinghouse) Desilu Playhouse\" which ran on CBS for 1958/59 and\n\n1959/60. Desilu Playhouse is not yet out on DVD, but I'm always\n\nhopeful. The Untouchables two-hour or two-part (depending on which\n\nversion) pilot originally aired as a two-parter on Desilu Playhouse,\n\nbut was then compressed into a feature-film for theatrical release.\n\nIt is part of the first season volume one DVD of Untouchables.\n\nThe \"Lucy-Desi Hours\" (hour-long I Love Lucy specials) were originally\n\nrun as part of Desilu Playhouse in 58/59 and 59/60 (there were five\n\nLucy-Desi Hours that were stand-alone specials in 57/58 as well), all\n\n13 Lucy-Desi Hours from 57-60 are available on DVD as the \"7th/8th/9th\n\nSeasons\" of I Love Lucy.\n\nAnd there were other pilots and special stand-alone broadcasts that\n\nwere originally aired as part of Desilu Playhouse....\n\nAnyhow, \"Time Element\" was intro'd by Desi (NOT Serling), and was a\n\nDesilu production, filmed at one or several of Desilu's facilities.\n\nBut it is considered a \"first\" pilot of Twilight Zone, and is a bonus\n\nfeature on the TZ first season Blu-Ray, but not part of the TZ DVDs.\n\nThe \"Twilight Zone Radio Dramas\" which began in 2002 does include\n\n\"Time Element\" as one of its episodes though....\n\nI knew the one TZ episode \"TWO\" (Charles Bronson and Elizabeth\n\nMontgomery) was filmed at the Hal Roach lot and I thought that was\n\nthe only one. What others were shot there? And was the studio\n\nstill open for business in the early 60's?\n\nYes, \"TWO\" was indeed filmed at the deteriorating Hal Roach studio\n\nbacklot, also in Culver City. I think that \"A Quality of Mercy\" (which\n\nMeTV reran just last night, Monday 24-Sept-2012) from the 3rd season\n\nof TZ, might also have been filmed at Hal Roach.\n\nSomewhere I read that Hal Roach's backlot was acquired by MGM at some\n\npoint, but fell into disrepair. It was demolished circa 1962 or so\n\nfrom what I've read.\n\nHal Roach did produce several sitcoms in the early 1950s, and might\n\nhave still had a few in the mid/late 1950s (Gale Storm's second\n\nsitcom \"The Gale Storm Show\" aka \"O Suzannah\" was a Hal Roach\n\nproduction, likely filmed at the Hal Roach studios, but that might\n\nhave been about it for Hal Roach as a TV production company.\n\nBTW, the TZ episode \"TWO\" with Elizabeth Montgomery (several years\n\nbefore she was Samantha Stevens) used music score composed by Van\n\nCleve, which included a piece of music cue/score that CBS would\n\ninclude their music score library, used in other TZ ep's later on,\n\nas well as on Perry Mason (Case of the Surplus Suitor for instance\n\nwhich aired on MeTV's morning run of Perry Mason yesterday), and as\n\npart of the CBS Music Library, that segment of music score also was\n\nused on several Fugitive episodes (which \"borrowed\" use of the\n\ntraditional CBS Music Score Library).\n\nAND... that specific piece of music score I'm think of, which was\n\nfirst used on TZ \"TWO\", was the THEME SONG for the 1974-82 \"CBS Radio\n\nMystery Theater\". And some \"Twilight Zone Radio Dramas\" since 2002\n\nalso include that \"TWO\" music aka \"CBS Radio Mystery Theater\" theme\n\nsong as well.\n\nmjc\n\nSomewhere I read that Hal Roach's backlot was acquired by MGM at some\n\npoint, but fell into disrepair. It was demolished circa 1962 or so\n\nfrom what I've read.\n\nThe plaque at the former site of the Hal Roach Studios, dates the facility\n\n1917-1963. It was placed there by the Sons of the Desert in 1985. Hal Roach\n\nhimself was present at the ceremony. The site is now home to Culver City Mazda\n\nor it was last time I was there in 1990.
