        "text": "Gorilla thrillers are widely accepted by critics as a canary in the cultural coal mine. If you want to see what the hopes and fears of a nation are, if you want to see her progress writ large, look no further than her monkey movies. This explains why the global culture has been artistically, technologically and spiritually dead inside since 1958.\n\nAll right, that’s a controversial theory at best, but this blog think it deserves exploration. Or at least it makes an easy excuse for why we’re reviewing three films in a single post. The simple answer is that none of them was either substantive enough for a solo review, but all together they do paint a kind of picture of the uncomfortable transition, if not slow death, of the gorilla thriller through World War II. There just comes a point where a guy in a monkey suit just isn’t scary any more, either through exposure to real gorillas or improved costuming elsewhere.\n\nThe earliest, 1942’s “The Strange Case of Doctor Rx,” is probably the best of the bunch (production actually started before the war, which feels notable). It’s an interesting enough setup: A series of career criminals, as soon as they’re acquitted in court, die under mysterious circumstances. A private detective (Patric Knowles) is hired by the man who served as each victim’s lawyer to figure out what’s going on. He starts his investigation, quietly pursued by a mysterious doctor (Lionel Atwill).\n\nThere will be a gorilla at some point, we promise.\n\n“Doctor Rx” is a tidy film, up until it’s not. It’s tidy in that it follows a lot of the rules of the somewhat-horror-crime genre without much in the way of innovation, playing it safe and getting what it does as a result. The cast is satisfactory. Most of the leads had some experience with the genre (Knowles was shooting both this and “The Wolf Man” over the course of October 1941 – how’s that for a Halloween?), and Anne Gwynne in particular is pretty fun to watch as a mystery writer foil to Knowles’s detective. The film has them awkwardly marry off screen to make their lover hijinks more palatable, and one wonders what a pre-Code film would have done with the couple.\n\nOn the other hand, Mantan Moreland is given a pretty thankless role as the goofy sidekick. He wasn’t exactly the star of the Charlie Chan films, but he got better than this. Nevertheless, the best parts of the film probably emerge when he’s comically paired with fourth Stooge Shemp Howard, who plays a goofy sidekick to the police detective, that detective being a foil to the main detective, and it’s sidekicks and foils all the way down.\n\nThings get understandably less tidy as the film progresses, and the climax is a lot. Things go off the deep end when the gorilla enters, given how it’s paired with brain surgery and weird hoods, for 17 seconds of glory (it’s “Crash” Corigan again, by the way). Then there’s a very aggressive course correct that involves breaking some of Knox’s rules of detective fiction. It’s pretty baffling, and it’s so hand wavy it ensures I will never speak ill of the epilogue to “Psycho” again\n\nOutside of the dodgy script, there’s some solid B movie direction from William Nigh (we know him) and some solid B movie photography from Elwood “Woody” Bredell. It’s probably about as good a send-off to the haunted house gorilla thriller as one could get at the time, even if one didn’t know it.\n\nTwo years later, “Nabonga” tried to mix things up by taking the crimey-monkey movie back to the jungle, a space where the gorilla thriller would continue to lurk for another 10-ish years. “Nabonga” is not the only jungle picture that kind of crosses over into gorilla thriller, but it is one of the more boring ones. It starts with a plane crash that strands both a treasure of stolen goods and the daughter of the thief in a patch of African jungle that looks suspiciously like a sound stage. Years later, the daughter has grown into the White Witch (Julie London), a near-mythological figure that haunts the forest with a (seemingly ageless) gorilla that acts like her personal bodyguard (it’s “Crash” Corrigan again, by the way). She’s sought by a treasure hunter (Buster Crabbe) who has a connection to the stolen goods; and he’s covertly followed by some, uh, French Canadian bartenders?\n\nThat is a much twistier plot description than “Nabonga” probably deserves. A good rule of thumb with gorilla thrillers is the more stock footage it uses, the less thrilling it will be, and “Nabonga” uses its fair share of stock footage. The film is mostly available to those who want to watch poorly lit night scenes and Crabbe swimming excessively (we know he was in the Olympics, settle down). On the other hand, there are a lot of monkeys in it too.\n\nThe direction is unimaginative, and the sound is poor. Cast-wise, Prince Modupe fairs pretty well as the African sidekick to Crabbe’s mighty Great White Hunter, so that leaves those looking for an offensive stereotype to fret about Fifi D’Orsay as the whiny, one-note French femme fatale. You should know where my sympathies lie. The gorilla absorbs a safari’s worth of bullets and still manages to kill a couple of people. By the way, he’s named Samson, not Nabonga, so that doesn’t explain the film’s title. On some posters the word “gorilla” appears afterward in parentheses, like translation note, but the closest this blog could find was the Zulu word “ngiyabonga,” meaning “thank you.” We prefer the Urban Dictionary’s offering.\n\nAnother mystery is where the White Witch, despite being isolated in the forest, gets fitted leopard skin suits and so much product for her hair. Crabbe also uses the word “kibitzer,” so if you ever wanted to hear him speak Yiddish, this is your chance. The final line of the film, “I’m sure you’ll be happy,” is spoken over the corpse of a gorilla. It’s not as interesting as it sounds.\n\nAnother film that’s probably more interesting in discussion than viewing is 1948’s “Who Killed Doc Robbin,” an altogether minor comedy-horror film that is notable for precisely two reasons: It is the final effort by legendary Little Rascals producer Hal Roach to revive his kids comedies, and it is arguably the final effort at an old dark house gorilla thriller.\n\nAlso arguably, the genre had aged enough that someone like Roach could pop in and try to use its tropes to fashion a kids comedy, which is not a sign of cinematic health. The film concerns the apparent murder of Doc Hugo Robbin (George Zucco, who’s here to provide a name), a cantankerous medical doctor who’d been arguing with so many people that there are no shortage of suspects, from his secretary (Virginia Grey) to local inventor Fix-It Dan (Whitford Kane). With the courts confused – no doubt by the impacted judicial system – it’s up to a group of kooky kids (my apologies to posterity, but I won’t be listing them all here) to check out Robbin’s spooky mansion and get to the bottom of his disappearance.\n\nDid I mention that Doc Robbin was apparently murdered in an explosion, and that Fix-It Dan keeps an atomic bomb in his workroom? But don’t worry, he tells the neighborhood kids that they should only go in there when he’s at home. That’s the level of bonkers on display in the script (by a trio of names whose credentials stretch back to silents), which is a pity. The humor is fairly juvenile – a running gag is that the young witnesses say something they realize they shouldn’t have in court, and they slam their hands on their mouths – but part of the charm of Roach’s Little Rascals was how children dealt with adult issues from a child’s perspective. That is not present here.\n\nThe humor for this blog started to improve when the kids entered the haunted mansion, and the film became more of a horror-comedy in earnest. It’s also a nice touch that the gorilla (it’s not “Crash” Corrigan this time, tonstant weader, but rather Charles Gemora…again) seems to live in a series of channels underneath the house, like it’s always been there are the building was constructed around it. That’s an idea that could be milked in a few different ways in a few different horror films.\n\nWe could spend our time mocking the film on some other notes – what kind of accent does Fix-It Dan actually have? How many haunted houses are there in Culver City? – but it doesn’t matter now. The damage is done. There would never be another somewhat serious Old Dark House gorilla thriller again; “Doc Robbin” is not the reason, but it is the proof."
