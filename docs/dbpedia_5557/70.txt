NAME: Hidayat HEYDAROV

COUNTRY: AZERBAIJAN

CATEGORY: -73KG

WORLD RANKING POINTS: 6638

A weight category once better known for Azerbaijanâ€™s Olympic Champion Elnur MAMMADLI and Olympic silver medallist, Rustam ORUJOV, now has a new golden boy.

Hidayat HEYDAROV is the world ranked number one of the -73kg category and has blasted through the year with a hat-trick of gold medals; Baku Grand Slam, European Championships, where he took his third title, and the Tokyo Grand Slam most recently this month.

Over the past year, Heydarov has been mentored by the Olympic Champion and Vice President of the Azerbaijan Judo Federation, Mammadli and has become the champion persona we now recognise.

Reigning in this category in this no easy feat, chased by the likes of Olympic Champion Lasha SHAVDATUASHVILI (GEO), so to accomplish the top status as well as those achievements put Heydarov in good stead for the upcoming Olympic Games in Paris.
