        "text": "\"My weight issues prevented me from continuing my career.\"\n\nThis was said by Rustam Orujov, a former judoka of the Azerbaijan national team who was a guest of the Idman Bizde program.\n\nThe athlete, who finished his career last year, admitted that he misses judo: \"I miss the tatami, going to the podium, even losing weight. I still haven't forgotten the atmosphere when we went out to fights. I think I could go on. At 81 kg, I would lower my weight again to 73 kg and get a license here as well. But I felt that the age was not right and I would not be able to perform at the Olympic Games. That's why I gave way to young people.\"\n\nOrujov also remembered the most disappointing moment in his career: \"Being 5th in the Tokyo-2020 Summer Olympic Games is my biggest disappointment. I rushed for the bronze medal. When I went to that meeting, I said that I will win and finish my career with a medal. But there was no luck. I was very tired. I was infected with corona 3 months before the Games. I could not fully recover. He also showed his influence. I was choked in every match, but I wrestled until the end. I also had good meetings. If it wasn't for this, maybe it would have been different.\"\n\nIt should be noted that Rustam Orujov won the silver medal of the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Summer Olympic Games held in Brazil."
