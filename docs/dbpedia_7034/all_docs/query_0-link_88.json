        "text": "Sometimes fire ends up being the only source of light for a photo shoot, either on purpose or by chance. There are many different situation where this could be the case: candles on a birthday cake, lanterns in front of a house, a campfire. Shooting in this low-light can make for some amazing pictures, but only if you know how to take the photo.\n\nCary Wolinsky and Bob Caputo of National Geographic share two ways they use to get good photos even in these low-lighting situations.\n\n“Shooting flames is tricky. They can be small and weak or huge and strong,” they said.\n\nA slow shutter speed allows more light to hit the camera’s sensor. If nothing in the photo is moving to cause motion blur (besides the flame), a slow shutter speed is ideal in low-light situations.\n\n“A good rule of thumb for birthday candles is to start at 1/15th of a second at f/5.6,” they said.\n\nIf using a slower shutter speed is not an option due to the risk of motion blur or missing the shot, adjusting your aperture and ISO are still options. Using a lower aperture allows the most amount of light into the camera, allowing a lower ISO to reduce grain.\n\nSome flash units and flashes built into cameras have an adjustable flash output which allows you the adjust the amount of light the flash lets out. This allows you to use the flash to supplement for the little light the flame lets out, without overpowering the photo with the full force of the flash.\n\n“The trick is to throw enough light on the subject to be able to see it in some detail without overpowering the golden light thrown by the flame,” they said.\n\n-Katelyn Phillips\n\nMary Ellen Mark was a photographer who is best known for her pictures that captured humans and other humanistic qualities. From her experiences and collections of works, she became one of the world’s foremost documentary photographers, as well as one of the most influential photographers of our time.\n\n(Source: NPR)\n\nMark traveled extensively, taking pictures wherever she explored. Some of her most notable works originated in India, where she captured Indian circuses, Mother Theresa, and Bombay brothels, among others. However, arguably, the most notable of her works, her photograph essay of runway children living in Seattle, was recognized and made into a film: Streetwise.\n\n(Source: NPR & Vice)\n\nIn 2014, Mark received the Lifetime Achievement in Photgraphy Award from George Eastman House. She also received the Outstanding Contribution Photography Award from the World Photography Organization, among many other prestigious awards. In addition, Mark contributed to the publishing of 20 books, including works such as Ward 81, Indian Circus, and Extraordinary Child. Her work even appeared in magazines, namely Life, New York Times Magazine, Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair.\n\n(Source: Photo-Eye)\n\nMary Ellen Mark lived to be 75 years old.\n\n“From the very first moment I took pictures, I loved it. … The thrill was the idea of just being on a street, turning a corner and looking for something to see. It was just an amazing feeling. … Photography became my obsession. … In a way it’s not so different when I go out to work now. It’s just that now I have years of experience in knowing how to use that little machine in front of me — at least better than I used it then. When it’s good and interesting it’s still that feeling of being on the street and wondering — God, I love this! — what’s going to happen next?” – Inquirer\n\n-jbarlow8\n\nLange is known for her prolific photography of farmers who were displaced during the Great Depression.\n\n“Dorothea Lange was born Dorothea Nutzhorn on May 26, 1895, in Hoboken, New Jersey. When she was 7, Dorothea contracted polio, which left her right leg and foot noticeably weakened. Later, however, she’d feel almost appreciative of the effects the illness had on her life. ‘[It] was the most important thing that happened to me, and formed me, guided me, instructed me, helped me and humiliated me,’ she said.\n\n“Art and literature were big parts of Lange’s upbringing. Her parents were both strong advocates for her education, and exposure to creative works filled her childhood.”\n\n(Source: Biography)\n\nLange’s post-high school life showed her gravitating towards photography after dabbling in it through a New York City studio project. She studied at Columbia University, and apprenticed for well-known photographers, such as Arnold Genthe and Clarence Hudson White.\n\nAfter a change her perspective on the world, Lange jumped into documenting the difficulties faced by the lower class through her employment under the Farm Security Administration.\n\n(“Migrant Mother,” Lange’s most well-known piece. Source: PBS)\n\n“Her method of work,” Taylor [her husband] later said, “was often to just saunter up to the people and look around, and then when she saw something that she wanted to photograph, to quietly take her camera, look at it, and if she saw that they objected, why, she would close it up and not take a photograph, or perhaps she would wait until… they were used to her” (Biography).\n\nLange was the first woman to be awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1940.\n\n-jbarlow8\n\nNothing is truly exciting until there is a risk of dying involved. While photographing wild animals, one wrong move and you’re their next meal. Michael Leggero, a nature photography, shared his experience photographing bears, and explained how to get the best shots while keeping safe.\n\nAnimal photography can be a portal into another part of the world. It’s a way to see animals living their everyday life, capturing snapshots of them without intruding, leaving them alone in their natural habitat. It is a far more ethical way of viewing animals than a zoo, and it’s a way to see them as they really live. Bears are particarlly interesting because they aren’t as threatening as a lion per say, they aren’t strictly carnivourous beings always on the hunt, most of their diet in fact is berries.\n\nThe best way to find a bear is to set up shop by a berry patch. Find a good sized patch and give yourself a little distance. Sooner or later a bear will come to eat.\n\n“The bear is happy sitting there and eating for hours at a time. This is the safest way to work with these animals—when they are happy and content,” Leggero said.\n\nAs long as you are quiet and don’t do anything to disturb the feasting animal, it will leave you alone, free to get as many shots as possible.\n\nThough these bears may be content while eating, it is still best to keep a good amount of ground between you and the wild animal. A 400-600mm lens is recommended, find the best spot and set up with a tripod. For the best shots keep the shutter speed at 500 and an aperature of 4-5.6, any smaller of an aperture and the background will not have any blur, distracting from the subject of the photo, the bear.\n\nIt is even possible to safely get the bear’s attention, to have it face your lens without bringing a threat to yourself.\n\n“If you want to get his attention, don’t wave your arms or make big movements. That will usually scare him away. Simply use a whistle. One quick sound will make him look up, and if you are lucky, he will look right into your lens. Once he realizes that you aren’t moving towards him aggressively he will usually go back to eating,” said Leggero.\n\nAnother good way to capture the wild bear is from the safety of a car. In national parks, you can often see these creatures from the side of the road, simply slowing down to take some pictures can prove to be some of the best shots. This can sometimes create a “bear jam,” as Leggero puts it. The cars behind you also slow down to see the animal, and suddenly there are tons of tourists making noise. While this can sometimes scare away the bear, other times it will capture it’s attention. It’ll look around and if you’re lucky, even stand on it’s hindlegs to get a better view, providing an incredible photography oppurtunity.\n\nKeep in mind that these are wild animals and can be unpredictable. While bear attacks are a rarity it’s always better to be safe than sorry. Before going out in the wild, educate yourself on bear behavior and how to best handle an aggresive bear.\n\n-William Voges\n\nWaterfalls can be calming to photograph, but getting the shot just the way you’d like can be difficult. That’s why there are various tips and tricks that can help you capture a waterfall just the way you’d like.\n\nFirst step: use a tripod. This will keep your camera stable when you are trying to capture the shot\n\nSecond step: use the lowest ISO. Lowing the camera ISO to the smallest number not only increases image quality, but also decreases the shutter speed. For example, decreasing camera ISO from ISO 800 to 100 on a Canon DSLR decreases the shutter speed by three full stops, so if you were shooting at 1/200th of a second, you would end up with a shutter speed to 1/25th of a second.\n\nThird Step: Lower the shutter speed. This will make the water look smooth and flow gracefully in the shot.\n\nFourth step: change the aperture to a higher number. This decreases the amount of light passing through the lens.\n\nPhotographing the Northern Lights is something a lot of travel photographers have on their bucket list. The Northern Lights are a beautiful feat of nature, and knowing how to correctly photograph them will allow one to capture an equally beautiful photo.\n\nUsing the proper camera settings will ensure a properly taken photo.\n\nDave Morrow, a landscape photographer, provides advice on gear, exposure times, and ISO sensitivity levels when taking a photo of the Northern Lights.\n\nA DSLR camera with a high ISO capability will prevent significant noise from entering the photo. Apertures of f/2.8 – f/4 are recommended to allow the most amount of light into the camera, allowing a lower ISO to reduce grain. A large number of batteries is needed to last through the night, as batteries die faster in the cold.\n\n“I rotate 7 batteries in my pocket when shooting at temps of below -10 degrees Celsius,” Morrow says.\n\nA longer exposure time allows more light to enter the camera’s sensor which allows for a lower ISO. It will also provide a better looking aurora. An exposure of 5-25 seconds is recommended depending on how fast the aurora is moving through the sky.\n\n“The shorter the exposure time, the closer your photos will resemble what your eyes actually saw,” Morrow says. “Experimentation is key.”\n\nMorrow recommends starting out with a lower ISO of 400-800 if possible to produce the best picture with the least amount of grain. If the photo is not bright enough, increase the ISO until it is. An ISO of 800-4000 is recommended depending on the situation.\n\n“You will want to expose your photos for the brightest parts of the picture,” he says. “The rest of the photo will look dark! That’s okay; you can recover these dark areas in post processing.”\n\n-Katelyn Phillips\n\nPainting with light is a photography technique that allows you to be creative and paint all over the town, without actually doing anything illegal like graffiti. It’s easy to do as an amateur photographer. All you really need is a camera, a tripod, a light source, a dark area, and an idea.\n\nOnce you have an idea of what you want to put in your photo, it is crucial to adjust your camera settings. It’s important to have a really slow shutter speed or it won’t even come out. Once it is lowered to at least 10 seconds (or longer), go out onto your scene and start painting. The long exposure of the camera will capture your movement with the light and create an image.\n\nThere really is no limit as to what you can paint in your photograph. Most people just do circles or they spell out words. It does not matter what kind of light you use, but some people recommend to use a flashlight with a variety of light settings so you are able to adjust the light however you want. Sparklers, glow sticks, LED lights, and any other light source that is easy to maneuver can be used as well.\n\nThe tripod is necessary because it can help keep any extra motion from being captured. If you are going to paint with the lights yourself then it will be much easier with the tripod. If someone else is painting for you, then you may not need it but keep in mind that if you move at all the camera will pick it up and it can effect your photo. Painting with light is very creative and can make any photo interesting, you just gotta try it out!\n\n-Lexi"
