        "text": "Chances are if you know of vaporwave, you’re one of two kinds of people on the internet, those who came across it as a one-off thing and moved past it, or those who came across it, really liked it and have stuck around with it even past its heyday. And if you don’t know what vaporwave is, that’s ok. But, it would be remiss if we were to pass on vaporwave because of its obscurity, because in doing so, we would be discounting the widespread impact it has had on the cultural landscape of today.\n\nA brief primer.\n\nCreated as an ironic subgenre of chillwave prevalent pre-2010s [read: stoner music], vaporwave parodies the manufactured low fidelity [lo-fi] sound of chillwave’s nostalgia-driven songs that often incorporate effects to mimic the limitations of pre and early 2000s recording technology. It serves as a critique of these “nostalgic” grainy, glitchy and scratchy sounds by doubling down on the nostalgia factor and making exclusive use of primarily 80s, and consequently 90s and Y2K motifs and source material.\n\n80s pop anthems are sliced up, mixed around, slowed, looped and glitching on the chorus bits, like a stuck tape-recorder of the best times of one’s past on Eccojams Vol. 1, serving as bittersweet reminders of city nights of past in one's memory. Floral Shoppe, takes elements from both albums to create the definitive sound - a past youth, better, brighter, full of opportunity and excess. New albums in the genre, building off the same motifs would only cement the pseudo-philosophy of vaporwave - as an escape from the fatigue from this life, and nostalgia for a better past - for a time before the 2000s economic slump, a time most considered young now have never seen but only heard of, and the eerie sense of absence that this misplaced nostalgia accompanies.\n\nOver its half-decade long prominence well into the late 2010s, as like any other genre, vaporwave has undergone many evolutions and encompasses a wide variety of sounds. Classic vaporwave made heavy use of 80s pop anthems set to droning down tempo synth-based sounds, like works from producers like Vektroid and Chuck Person. Late vaporwave offers a lot more variety, with producers like Windows96 and haircuts for men incorporating a lot of the sonic themes of classic vaporwave in original works and compositions, in a vein similar to 00s ambient music.\n\nThe works of Infinity Frequencies reminds us of the desolate and pitiful nature technologies and modern conveniences take on when there is no one around to interact with them. With varied distinct sub-genres focusing on the many connotations and by-products of consumerism and post-consumerism, there is a vaporwave for everyone, all it comes down to is the part of it you want to immerse yourself in.\n\nIt’s hard to say - with vaporwave, it’s hard to separate the meme from its actual message. Early works can be looked upon both as [1] a critique of the symbiotic relationship between our lives and the ever-increasing commercial nature it tends to take on, and [2] a manifestation of changes in the socio-economic atmosphere in the mid-2010s of the global collective youth via desires of nostalgia for a time of adolescence and easy access to creature comforts.\n\n80s media is quite fitting in its function as a genuine response to vaporwave as a largely post-consumerist movement The 80s were unarguably the last time [the western world, and the rest by way of trickle-down] saw a time of economic ease - a period of all-round growth and development. Everyone was buying things, companies were more than happy to be making things and selling things, consumer technologies were now cheaper and more fun than ever, people had greater access to media, games and music.\n\nPeople born into these times grew with these technologies, they grew with the internet, and these memories, both learnt or lived through, remain fresh in the minds of the current global youth. The adoption of 80s media to offer up critique as to how obsession with these memories is but a hollow activity, by presenting a deliberate sad sound, with no lasting impact really drives home the fact that all that remains in reality now are obsolete technologies, empty spaces and a massive back catalogue of sounds from the past of an imagined future.\n\nEven as an ironic genre, as a parody of consumer culture and extreme nostalgia, vaporwave stands out from other internet based cultures in the sheer volume of people it attracted. It offered to the listener soundtracks of many fleshed out niches comprising mixes of lo-fi, ambient, funk-jazz, citypop and synthwave, such that there was a sound for everyone. Furthermore, since vaporwave lent itself so easily to memes, anyone with access to softwares like FL Studio or GarageBand could make their own vaporwave. This memeable nature of the genre contributes to perhaps its biggest selling point, the community it fostered on the internet.\n\nSites like Bandcamp, YouTube and Reddit worked as the medium for many to both share and discover new and continually changing sounds in vaporwave, as well as a medium for discourse on the themes of vaporwave. Unsurprisingly, somewhere along the way owing to the large-ish, mostly anonymous collective it garnered, and it being a niche genre, it attached to itself a backstory of being birthed from a longing of a better past, of simpler times, from a collective consciousness tired of the capitalist nature of this present time, while at the same time fully cognisant of their own participation in the very same system, either in the past or present.\n\nTaking both sides of the vaporwave coin into account - the genuine counterculture and the massive meme, it is still difficult to discern the message of vaporwave. A genre initially mocking the hollowness of nostalgia for a time one has never lived in, with the visuals and themes emphasising the shallowness of surface-level deep thought - music that was meant to be enjoyed ironically. With no clear authority to define what such a genre meant, vaporwave has since taken on any form depending on what the listener wanted of it.\n\nIts self-referential and ironic nature lends easily to reuse, variation and as it grew as a genre, the source material, as well as the thematic tones it took on, began to vary. Vaporwave has long since moved past its anonymous beginnings of irony, post-consumerism and retrofuturism, and often finds itself in direct contradiction to the irony it once stood for. It has gone from ironic music limited to gatekept circles to a moderately well known, unironically well-liked and a-somewhat misunderstood genre.\n\nVaporwave is dead?\n\nIn retrospect, it’s perhaps easier to look upon vaporwave for its many cultural contributions than to actually tie it down to a single definition of what it is, in a manner akin to an open to interpretation sort of ending. It can be looked upon as a signifier of a changing social climate, of a collective movement spilling forth into reality the voices of an unsatisfied youth, of a woeful celebration of past joys denied, or of a reminder of the desolate reality of past goodness. If we want to celebrate the revival of forgotten past media, we have the hyper-pop dance jams of future funk to move along to."
