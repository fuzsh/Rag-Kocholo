        "text": "Alright, so since I'm looking to start this back up soon, I suppose I should post a recap for those of you who are new. While it is strongly recommended that you read the earlier updates (it is some neat stuff) I think that a recap will help get some bearings, and also help me to refresh my memory of what I might have forgotten.\n\nSo, Vaporverse as the title implies is an Alternate History Timeline I'm writing with inspiration taken from Vaporwave, everybody's favorite Retrofuturistic Musical Thorn in the side of the DMCA. To those not aware, Vaporwave is essentially a genre of Music, as well as an Aesthetic Meme that retrospectively celebrates/criticizes Nostalgia by completely mangling songs from days gone by to change their vibes into more A E S T H E T I C sounds. The idea is to portray a romanticized version of the period known at the time as \"The End of History\" A period of Optimism spanning from the unification of Germany in 1989 and crashing and burning in 2001 with the September 11th Attacks. Various Subgenres exist to tackle various aspects of the Western Pop Culture of the post-cold war period, but all you need to know for this timeline is that it draws inspiration from the themes of Vaporwave.\n\nMy idea for Vaporverse was to extend the era of good feelings that existed after the Cold War for as long as possible and make as idealistic a world as Possible without stretching the bounds of realism too much. All the events in the timeline are things I concluded through research that was possible, even if unlikely. The point of Divergence is probably different than most other \"no-9/11\" worlds. I chose to challenge myself by not averting Operation Cyclone, (The Reagan Era CIA Operation which funded the Afghan resistance against the Soviets, which later created Al Qaeda).\n\nI chose instead to prevent Desert Storm, by ensuring that an intelligence report stating that Saddam had no intention of peacefully resolving the border dispute with Kuwait successfully made its way to Ambassador April Glaspie before she met with Saddam Hussein on the 25th of July 1990. With knowledge of Saddam's true intentions, April could reasonably inform Saddam that if he invaded Kuwait America Would Intervene militarily, thereby forcing him to seriously consider peaceful negotiations. Besides that, 1990 is mostly the same as OTL. Averting Desert Storm helps with averting 9/11 by significantly reducing the American Military Presence in the Region, which was one of the biggest grievances cited in the 1996 Fatwa calling for Jihad against the USA issued by Osama Bin Laden. While this does not completely prevent 9/11 (yet), what it does is take out a big point potential recruiters could use to radicalize people into joining Al Qaeda, or any other Radical Islamist Terror Group.\n\n1991 see's the Reforms of Gorbechev reach their ultimate conclusion. The August Coup is Thwarted after Gorbechev uses his Crimean vacation as a Honeypot to capture the Conspirators while he stays with his Frenemy, Boris Yeltsin. The Following Day, The New Union treaty is signed, officially reorganizing the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics into the Union of Sovereign Soviet Republics. Thanks to the August Coup not happening, and therefore the little legitimacy of the USSR being Preserved, the Soviet Union is on a path towards Democracy.\n\nThe World begins to move away from a Bipolar Order to a Dipolar one, with the United States under Bill Clinton looking to Co-operate with the Soviet Union on the pressing issues of the world just before the 21st-century rolls in. Among the most pressing matters is that of International Terrorism, which takes the headlines by storm throughout 1993, with one of the worst incidents being the coordinated dual bombings of the World Trade Center and the Kremlin by Al-Qaeda. The International Community begins to recognize the threat that terrorism poses to the Stability of the world, and looks to Stabilize areas such as the former Yugoslavia and countries with major internal conflicts to prevent terrorists from exploiting power vacuums. At home, Governments may soon have to confront the question of balancing Personal Freedoms and Privacy in the increasing internet-dominated world with the need to preserve National Security.\n\nSpeaking of the United States, a new political force comes onto the scene in 1992, as Ross Perot becomes the most successful 3rd Party-Candidate, running on a Populist Platform with a fusion of Radical Centrism, Social Democracy, and Third-Way Liberalism. He also becomes the first 3rd Party to gain a state in the Electoral College, taking the 4 Electoral Votes from Maine. While he did not win, he managed to be more successful than he expected and found the Reform Party soon after, and in 1994, the Reform Party rides a predominantly Infomercial and Internet Town-Hall driven Campaign to gain enough seats in the House to deny the Republicans and Democrats a Plurality, meaning most bills proposed by either side requires Reform Party Support to stand a chance at Passing.\n\nMeanwhile, 1995 is set to be the first General Elections for the Soviet Union under the new Democracy, and with all seats up for grabs and a growing Internet Infrastructure, the results will not only determine whether the New Union can Survive as a stable democratic confederation, split apart under the pressure of nationalism, continue the Russian Tradition of Authoritarian Government, or Return to the old ways of Communism. The Results will also have massive geopolitical implications for decades to come.\n\nMeanwhile, with the Soviets abandoning Communism, some of the remaining Communist States turn towards the People's Republic of China, still undergoing the Economic Reforms of Deng Xiaoping, while other elect to go separately and pave their path to the worker's paradise. China in particular looks towards the new technologies of the Internet age and how best to either Regulate them or use them as a means of control.\n\nLet's move away from Political Changes, and move towards another aspect of the 90s culture. Technology! Throughout the early 1990s, the Internet goes from being reserved to Governments and Research institutions with limited Commercial and Consumer use, to be a platform for users from Boston to Vladivostok to talk about whatever they want. Online Cultures develop fast, fandoms begin growing at exponential rates, and everybody seems to own a website. While there are costs, as Criminals exploit the new opportunities in scamming and Software Piracy. Attempts to fully control the web are tempered by the efforts of free-speech activists and the average user, and in the United States, the Reform Party fiercely opposes proposals that could risk the free-spirited expression of the early web, leading to the DMCA being far more lenient and respectful of Fair Use.\n\nTelevision enters the age of Cable, with News gradually becoming Sensationalist and Adverts becoming surreal, with Weather being presented alongside a soundtrack of smooth Jazz and MIDI Composition. The Super Mario Movie ends up being Successful and paves the way for a more interesting Console War.\n\nOh yeah, Console War is in this as well. After Sony gets stiffed by Nintendo and the SNES-CD Deal falls through paving the way for the ill-fated Phillips CD-I, Sega successfully launches the Sega CD in the United States after Thomas Kalinske convinces Hayao Nakayama to ensure that 3rd-party support is available the same day CD releases in America after a successful launch in Japan. The CD is Successful as a result, and Sega now has a new policy of ensuring that 3rd-Party Development Kits are released the same day as every new Console's public release. This in turn makes Sega a more attractive company to work with compared to Nintendo's exploitive contracts and strict standards. in 1994, Sony drops the Playstation, which can be produced entirely in-house thanks to Sony's already established presence in other Consumer Electronic Appliances. With the Sudden rise in Competition, Nintendo knows they must release a major console in 1995 to compete with the widely-anticipated Sega Saturn. While 3d Graphics are a must-have, Nintendo looks towards the Internet to create the first Online capable Video Game System.\n\n1995 will be a massive year in many ways. and time will tell where the world goes from there.\n\nMikhail Gorbechev had won. After almost ten years, his programs of Perestroika, Glasnost, and Demokratizatsiya were about to lead to their conclusion. Gorbechev had fundamentally changed Soviet Politics. Perestroika and Glasnost had allowed for Economic Liberties and for free criticism, and while the way they were first implemented could very well have led to a Collapse, the New Union treaty managed to work a compromise that kept the Union Together and allowed for it to become an Economic Powerhouse and Regional Superpower. Now, in 1995, Democratization would be achieved.\n\nThe Soviet General Elections of 1995 were simultaneously the most confusing and ordered elections for outsiders to follow. All Seats that could be elected, would be up for election, which meant thousands of political positions from the mayor of Omsk to the General Secretary themselves would need to be up for grabs. The voting would be done with Approval Voting, meaning that a voter could either approve or disapprove of any number of candidates on their ballot, even ones vying for the same positions. Therefore, The winner would be the one who would be most liked. Internet Debates on the Soviet Web would be common. International Observers watched curiously to see if The Soviet Union could truly move away from Authoritarianism.\n\nThe Campaigns lasted around an entire year, and as the vote was an approval contest, many candidates could lose from scandals and exposures of Hypocrisy. Thanks to the growth of a free press, which was frequently keeping track of Political Platforms and Developments, the Turnout on Election Day was 87% on the Union Level, and stayed roughly 85-88% on Republican and Local level Elections. This showed that Apathy was almost non-existent, and a vast majority of Soviet Citizens were deeply concerned about what Government would lead them into the New Millenium. But, How did the results turn out?\n\nOn a Union Level, the results in the Supreme Soviet turned out to be as diverse as the Union itself. A chart of the seats colored by party would look similar to a European Parliament, as the chamber was split into various blocs. These blocs are as follows.\n\nThe Popular Front: A broad Coalition of Moderate Left-wing Parties which currently holds the plurality, but not a majority. Some Highlight parties include\n\nThe Social Democratic Party of the Soviet union: An Offshoot of the CPSU Originally isolated exclusively to Russia, but later expanded to the entire Union after the New Union Treaty Passed. As one would expect, this party seeks to establish a Hybridized variant of Capitalism with an extensive network of social safety nets similar to that which exists in Denmark. Currently Dominates the Bloc\n\nThe Green Party: This is a party which generally agrees with the SDPSU on most policies, but pursues policies seeking to mitigate the effects of Climate Change.\n\nPeople’s Patriotic Union: The Black Sheep of the Front, with more radical Democratic Socialist views and a strong Christian Democrat Faction. The PPU also distinguishes itself among the Soviet Left as being supportive of nationalist foreign policies.\n\nThe Democratic Union: Originally an underground Democratic Party in the Soviet Union, as Glasnost fully took effect this party became a Big Tent for those opposed to Socialism in the USSR. When the 1995 elections were announced to be approval based, the union split as a Big Tent Party with no true defining ideology would not really do particularly well. The second largest bloc, it is composed of parties in the Center, the Center-right and the more Moderate Right. Highlights include:\n\nThe Liberal Party of the Soviet Union: The Party of Yeltsin, seeking to implement Neoliberal Capitalism around the Union. There is disagreement in this party on Social Issues, with one side being Social Liberal and the other being Social Conservative.\n\nThe Christian Democrat party of the Soviet Union: Centre-Right on Social issues, and Centre-Left on Economic Issues, and 100% Christian Social Gospel, perfectly balanced. As all things should be.\n\nThe Union party: A small party led by a former KGB Agent. What Could possibly go wrong.

This is getting quite long.\n\nMaybe I should do a part two? My brain’s getting numb and I need to get this out. For now, enjoy some tunes.\n\nＩ ｗａｓ ｎｏｔ ｌｙｉｎｇ ｗｈｅｎ Ｉ ｓａｉｄ ｉｔ ｗａｓ ａ ｄｏｏｚｙ． ピじず汚 イべキ ヅ椅マ​"
