        "text": "When did you first come to China, and what were you planning to do there?\n\nWhen I came to China around 2009, I was taking photos. I never really planned to stay in China but it just happened. That was when the economy was just awful and the idea of being able to get a job in London seemed really difficult. I would have had to live in the middle of nowhere, basically, so I came here to do a project and stayed.\n\nHow did you find work in China? Or did you have to create it for yourself?\n\nFor the first few years I was doing these commercial VJ-type jobs. A lot of the stuff was really terrible and didnât pay well either. Around 2012 I got really excited about Tumblr. People seemed to be using Facebook for more interesting stuff. You could find people and get to know the person, as well as what they were making.\n\nBack then I started working on making clothes as Timefly. All this art I found on social media looked so amazing and it seemed interesting to make clothing using peopleâs work. Instead of just putting it on a t-shirt, which seemed a bit boring, I was trying to mimic the look of a fabric simulation falling over a body. We picked a fabric that draped really well and made this poncho-shape, almost as if it was a square of an image from the internet draped over people. That was the beginning. It probably was around 2014-2015 or so, where I could just do what I wanted to do, rather than doing the commercial VJ stuff.\n\nSince you brought it up: thereâs a lot of talk about how every person now is involved with self-branding and self-promotion through social media. On the other hand, artists who use it canât only promote their workâthere has to be a bit of personality attached to it as well. The divide between the personal and promotional vanishes in all directions.\n\nRight, but at least before Instagram, when the interesting stuff was happening on Facebook, it didnât feel like everyone was using it in a very crafted way. It was much more a platform for people to talk to friends, except those were friends you didnât actually know in reality. And then they were posting their work too, so you could see somebodyâs work and immediately chat to them, which was quite interesting. Now that doesnât seem to happen that much. Facebook changed all its algorithms so it doesnât really show anything anymore. I sound like a grandfather ranting about the good old days, but when all social media was newer, there was less aggression. People were less restrained, so you got a much more personal impression instead of this very safe, curated thing that weâre completely familiar with now.\n\nWhich of these platforms do you find the most useful for you as an artist?\n\nTumblr was the most interesting when it was new. You could spend hours looking through everybodyâs stuff. It also felt much more like a conversation. You had to do certain stuff, like, use the PNGs with the transparent background, so that when someone else posted it, everything blended in with the background on their Tumblr and their own weird themes. That was really exciting. It felt like you were responding to what somebody else was doing and vice versa.\n\nNow it doesnât seem that any platforms are particularly interesting. Instagram is the one I use most, because itâs the most casual and the one with the least amount of text. Itâs also the one people here in China use the most. I donât know, are there any that you like using?\n\nLike is a strong wordâ¦ Twitter is mildly fascinating in an essentially cruel way, I guess.\n\nThatâs why I never got into it. It seems that the very sharp points with a lot of vile got mixed in with everything else; itâs hard to sift apart. And it rewards you for having the sharpest response to whatever it is. All these things seem to be evolving people in directions they didnât intend. Same with Youtube algorithms: itâs changing peopleâs behavior in fairly useless ways. It acts like it knows what you want in a way that you donât even know yourself. Itâs almost worrying clicking on something, because then Google will think youâre that kind of person and feed you that kind of shit.\n\nThereâs a weird pseudo-religious element to the idea of being afraid of Google quietly judging you for your online behavior.\n\n{Laughs} True! Instagram, for example, knows how long you looked at the advert. If you linger too long, it will appear as if youâre into that thing.\n\nAs an expat, how did you go about connecting with the local scene in Shanghai?\n\nIn the beginning it didnât really occur to me that anything like the stuff Iâm seeing online would ever happen here, really. There was such a big gap between what was interesting in the rest of the world and what was happening hereâit was a lot of indie rock or, if there was electronic stuff, it was old techno. Something that was past its peak in the rest of the world.\n\nThere were a few bookings but it was still foreigners in China booking people outside China. And then Chinese people started using VPNs more, and more people moved to Shanghai. People got used to connecting to the rest of the world and it all got interesting very quickly. All of a sudden there was a local demand for what I was doing, too. Maybe in some ways it doesnât matter where the people who like your stuff are based, but somehow itâs nicer if it is in the same area. Itâs a much more high-bandwidth interaction if youâre in the same room. When youâre doing visuals for music, youâre doing it for people in the same space. Hey, when you write an article, isnât there always a disconnect because youâre not sitting in the same room with the people who are reading it, generally?\n\nThatâs true. Youâre making visuals for people to collectively experience it. Whereas writing is mostly made for the very singular experience of one reader.\n\nYeah, but one thing about writing is that it can be a glue that joins small communities together. When itâs in a magazine that everyone from the community is reading, then there is a group response to it. I think thatâs missing a bit now. There arenât any new publications like DIS at the moment.\n\nI wonder what came first, the dying of the magazines and the cultural platforms that nurture scenes, or the âeveryoneâ in this analogyâare communities and subcultures just way too scattered for any unifying publication?\n\nItâs a bit chicken and egg. Maybe at the time when DIS was doing what they were doing, it wasnât necessarily a coherent subculture like punk and goth, where itâs mostly about how you dress, and what music you listen to. When DIS came along, it was already more about a certain way of thinking, which tied in with post-internet art and all that stuff. There was an understanding that the existing systems werenât very suitable for what is happening now. There was definitely a kind of optimism about the futureâwhich now seems a bit naive to have had in the first place. Iâm sure there could be a new magazine or new thing that binds everything together today.\n\nWhy do you say that pro-futurist stance was naive to begin with?\n\nNo, no, I donât think it felt naive THEN. But it almost feels naive to be optimistic about the future in general now. However, I think this is just a phase and weâre going to get back to being sick of this new emo, gloomy shit.\n\nBack then, things were very optimistic, everyone was excited about what technology could let you achieve that you couldnât previously. This has always happened in the past; for a while people are excited about the present. And then everybody gets jaded. Now it feels a little directionless. Looking back, thereâs so much stuff that just feels like it happened 20 or 30 years ago, but spruced up with some slightly new wrapping paper. The scene weâre talking about felt really new, like something that couldnât have existed before. It could only exist in a world where everybody was using the internet and the technology they could find to make stuff.\n\nMany of the underlying ideas of those scenes born from the internetâthings like vaporwave, or what PC Music were doingâseemed to be connected by the aesthetics of consumer goods and the acceleration of capitalism to a humorous extent. Extreme capitalism to gleefully showcase the apocalyptic effects of it.\n\nYes, the idea of it being humorous was very important. Everything was funny and didnât take itself too seriously. There was no way to address these things very seriously anymore. Everything is so weird that using corporate elements in a serious way wouldnât have worked. It wouldnât have made the point it was making. It always had to be tongue in cheek.\n\nDid you ever see yourself in a Cyberpunk tradition?\n\nI donât think so. Cyberpunk was also very pro-technology: looking at the way technology causes problems, but also worshipping it. It feels very different to me. The world in which you got the internet and everybody is using technology, it was imagining that. Once we actually had that world, then there was no point in fetishizing technology anymore. What we did was more about the subtle things, like the way people were talking about corporations. Cyberpunk imagined them as these big, super-evil conglomerates. Whereas now, corporations try to be your friend, which leads to a very different feeling. Itâs hard to imagine a Facebook-type company in a Cyberpunk setting. It wouldnât be cool enough.\n\nNow, Cyberpunk is just as much of a fantasy as goblins. An alternate, slightly â80s version of things thatâs now locked forever. The reality is much more boring. 2019 didnât come with endless rain and neon and people shooting each other, like Blade Runner promised. But we have the super advanced technology! Just instead of hacking into corporations to steal stuff and be cool characters, we use it to scroll through endless photos of breakfasts.\n\nSpeaking of endless scrollingâhow do you deal with the maze of unread tabs that are open all the time?\n\nI mean, I do use the same set-up for everything: work, research, leisure time. Going to work means getting out of bed and walking ten meters. But I do make sure I close all the tabs every few hours. Whenever it looks like thereâs just too much mess, I close everything and start again. I guess itâs this weird feeling of the computer becoming an extension of your space. It gets messy, you clean it up and you feel the same kind of chemicals your brain is giving you for cleaning up your physical space. It gives you the same rewards for cleaning your computer.\n\nThereâs also this constant waiting for things to appear on your screen. You can be away from your laptop, but youâre still waiting for that ping. How do you handle that?\n\nThat can even go both ways: sometimes you want the response and sometimes youâre dreading it. All of that is such a big distraction. I mean requests like âcan you do a cover for something,â then you gotta listen to it and often the music is not anything that youâd be remotely into. But how can you say no? Having to turn stuff down is really stressful. It shouldnât be, but it is. You have to find a diplomatic way.\n\nLike what?\n\nThe only thing is to say youâre busyâwhich is true! Even if you havenât got a project that is taking up 100% of your time right at that moment, youâre still busy. Even if youâre taking a break for a couple of days. It is kind of honest. I havenât really found any other way to turn someone down. Iâve done some things where I tried to politely say that I wasnât really into it, but it feels hard to write, or insulting in a way. Itâs hard to be honest with that kind of stuff.\n\nHow does that apply to working with corporate clients?\n\nItâs similar, because you might want to work with them later. But they seem to be more used to it, because they operate in this non-personal way all the time. So itâs okay if youâre going into unpersonal mode, too. And if itâs not a very good request, you can just ignore it, if youâre not intending to work with them later. Sometimes, if a request is completely ridiculous, it can feel good to reply and say âI am not interested.â I had one really amazing one from a Swedish brand that is inspired by Japan in a super blatant way. They were asking for all these Japanese things to go in the video, sumo wrestlers and such. It was hilarious. That was the only one I turned down in a kind of sarcastic way.\n\nYou have a very distinctive style and technique. Do you ever feel typecast by clients?\n\nThatâs another really tricky thing. Everyone, just from talking to people and reading interviews, seems to have specific problems figuring out what a client wants. Often, they say in the beginning that they are open to whatever. And then, once youâve already agreed to the job, a mood board will come over with a bunch of your old stuff. At that stage it is very hard to say you donât want to do that anymore. Thatâs really difficult. You still need some direction to do what people want, of course.\n\nLetâs talk a bit more about Shanghai. Oftentimes, the most creatively inspiring places can be terrible for artists in other respects. You already mentioned how finding a job in London would have been difficult. How does this balance of finding inspiration in a scene you feel connected to and the cost of living play out in Shanghai?\n\nThe cost of living is going up all the time. When I was first here, it was a lot cheaper. I had a lot of visa problems in the beginning so I had to leave every month or two to redo it, which was expensive and stressful. You never know whether youâre going to get a new one. Itâs a really different city now. When you visit a new place, everything is inspiring. The place itself is interesting. After a few years, the place itself becomes familiar, so it is more about what individual things are happening there. When I got here, the city was amazing. Now I basically stay at home all the time and go out once or twice a week. Although there is much more going on with events now.\n\nHow would you describe the scene today?\n\nFor example, the Genome 6.66Mbp label, the stuff theyâre doing is very connected with the rest of the world. They were booking people from everywhere but also had their own people that were making great stuff. Itâs an extension of what people like Total Freedom were doing. All genres mixed together, but not in this mash-up way where it is about technical skill, showing the fact that you can mix something with something. Itâs much more about the overall flow and the emotion of the whole thing you get. There are very few nights here where that one night has only one genre. If you just play a whole techno set, people are going to leave.\n\nThe visual aspect and the music seem to be part of the same experience in Shanghai.\n\nThatâs correct. I normally go to this club, All. One of the reasons Shanghai has gotten better is that there are many more clubs now than there used to be. The people who come to All, they do dress up in a way that seems cohesively linked with everything else going on. It feels like a scene of stuff happening, which it never did before. Itâs probably quite rare around the world to have something thatâs really all linked in that way. There could be a lot more done with visuals and decoration of the clubs, there is a lot more room there.\n\nThe idea of bringing digital art into the real-life spaces and even onto people, with your clothingâhow difficult is that?\n\nItâs actually quite easy. With 3D art youâre already starting with something thatâs trying to represent something in the real word anyway. Itâs using the real worldâs coordinate system of making objects in a physical space. Which is different of course from other ways of being creative, making paintings or something like that. For the clothes, for example, I started with a Korean 3D program called Clo. You can design the clothing in there and then simulate them draping on people. You can see exactly what youâre gonna get.\n\nAt the beginning of last year, I did the design for All in Shanghai, and for another club, Oil, in Shenzhen. Youâve got to be a bit more detailed obviously with making up models and making sure theyâre all to the right scale. Other than that, youâre still using the same process: youâre still looking at all the images and trying to find materials online and make 3D versions of everything, do tests. Thatâs a really useful thing about using 3D; itâs the basis for everything and anything physical. I havenât got that much into 3D printing yet but I would like to.\n\nAnd how about the other way aroundâhow difficult is it to bring human physicality and movement into 3D renderings? Especially in your videos, you have worked with the human form more frequently.\n\nRight, the stuff I have been doing recently has used people a lot more. Iâm using the Unreal engine and most of the stuff Iâve been doing recently is running in real time, like a game. Thatâs a bit more forgiving because of the overall quality of the thing. There isnât a need to make the humans look so perfect. I really like doing stuff with people and characters, itâs just quite difficult because there are so many elements that need to work well, the animation and all that stuff. Using motion capturing, for example, is something Iâd like to do much more in the future.\n\nSo, if your whole professional, and a huge chunk of your private life, are happening online: how do you manage to not procrastinate so much on the internet? And if you do, how much inspiration do you get from it?\n\nI used to get a lot more from the procrastination itself, when the content was more interesting. When Tumblr was newer and when there was more interesting stuff to be found, it didnât feel so much like wasted time. So now, when Iâm not doing anything useful, I try hard to do something that feels like youâre getting something out of it, like playing a video game, rather than just wasting time on social media, which is surely a drain for time.\n\nLike we said in the beginning: this is a real thing that everybodyâs trying to figure out how to deal with. All the companies who make social media try to make you keep looking at it. When everybody is just connected into mindless browsing, itâs draining so much creativity from humans, without leading to any deep emotion. Itâs just treading water. A lot of people end up pissed off from that, or even depressed, because thereâs the competitive aspect as well. Whether youâre creating anything or just taking a picture of your holiday dinner. You donât necessarily get happy from it. Somebody elseâs dinner will always get more likes than yours. Somebodyâs snide tweet will always be sharper and more bitter and vile than yours. Thereâs no room for subtleties, theyâre just excess baggage. And subtleties are what make everything interesting."
