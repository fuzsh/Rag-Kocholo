        "text": "My first encounter with the strange music genre of vaporwave happened when I was about 14, scrolling through the gritty meme recess that was iFunny. I remember seeing photos that all had the same sort of elements: an Apollo head bust, a cyber grid of neon colors, palm trees, and outdated fonts. These were strangely captivating, but also unsettling.\n\nUsually these photos were accompanied by music that I could only describe as the kind of elevator music that must have played in a hotel that was built in 1983, and is in desperate need of a renovation. It wasn’t until just recently that my boyfriend taught me the name of the album that the strangely haunting elevator music came from: Floral Shoppe by Macintosh Plus. As it turns out, the nostalgia-inducing images and music that captivated me as a 14-year-old were all part of a budding genre of music called vaporwave, and I was very right to feel unsettled.\n\nWHAT IS VAPORWAVE?\n\nVaporwave is both an aesthetic and genre of music that is meant to induce nostalgia, especially for the ’80s and early ’90s, and a longing for what we imagined the future would be like back in the 1980s. The driving theme behind vaporwave is that it makes you long for a future that never happened. Vaporwave music is often composed of samples of songs from the 1970s and 80s. These are usually pitched down, slowed, and resynthesized in order to create a thick heavy sound, like something is weighing you down and pulling you back in time.\n\nOne distinctive feature of vaporwave is its fixation with Japanese language and culture. There are countless album and track titles in cryptic Japanese, which are more often than not completely unreadable to the mostly Western audience of vaporwave. Many artists even sample clips of dialogue from retro Japanese anime films, commercials, and news reels. This element of vaporwave is also tied up in its constant pursuit of awakening nostalgia. Japan enjoyed an economic boom throughout the 1980s, which is now recognized as Japan’s Bubble Economy, that would eventually come crashing down in the 1990s. Before this devastating pop, Japan was praised for its thriving business models and became a model of technological innovation in the western mind for more than a decade.\n\nAdditionally, with the success of entertainment and tech industries like Sony and Nintendo, Japan appeared to be the country that was building the future, one that looked shiny, new, and full of promise.\n\nPerhaps the best way to understand the nostalgia-obsessed mess that is vaporwave is through Jaques Derrida’s concept of Hauntology, as proposed in “The Philosophy of Vaporwave” by the website Vapor95. According to Derrida, humans can only understand the present through past experiences and anticipation of the future. Therefore, humans never truly live “in the moment.” What we understand to be the present is always defined by our pasts along with what we anticipate to follow in the future, and is thereby never truly “just” the sensations at present. In other words, the concept of Hauntology is that humans are always haunted by the past and the futures that have yet to happen.\n\nThis tendency to filter the present through our past experiences is what gives vaporwave that undeniably nostalgic sound. Most of us have heard old music from decades long gone by. For example, if a song is full of synth and heavy reverb, you will likely identify it as some musical relic of the ’80s, which will then open up a floodgate in your mind of your experience with ’80s culture, whether that be other songs, movies, or photos of your parents from that time. To hear these outdated musical trends once again given new life through being resynthesized and paired with grainy imagery from these decades is like rolling up your sleeve and shooting your arm up with the heaviest dose of nostalgia.\n\nSOME BRANCHES OF VAPORWAVE\n\nThe vaporwave genre is laden with subgenres, some of which are so similar that it feels superfluous to differentiate them at all. However, as someone who has listened to vaporwave for a few years now, here are some of the subgenres that I personally think deserve to be recognized, as they exemplify the many sides of the genre, ranging from ethereal or funky to downright creepy.\n\nFUTURE FUNK\n\nFuture Funk is the more jovial branch of vaporwave. It often samples from the choruses of funk and motown music from the ’70s and early ’80s, and especially uses シティ・ポップ (City Pop), which is essentially just pop music from 1980s Japan. Future Funk sounds like what you’d imagine playing at some raging night club in the late ’70s, where everyone is young, beautiful, and having the time of their lives. Simply speaking, It’s the kind of stuff that makes you want to dance."
