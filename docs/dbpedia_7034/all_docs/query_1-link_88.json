        "text": "Have you ever wondered what Greco-Roman statues have in common with a pink and purple world of the late 90s? And why would you glue some palm trees over a romantic and pixeled sunset? Because you love Vaporwave, that’s why.\n\nVaporwave aesthetic was born in the early 2010s and started taking place at the same pace as its musical counterpart. It represents every nostalgic element we deep down feel linked to in a very contemplative, but also ironic way. It is described by its common themes which include 90s corporate commercialism, old anime shows, 80s style colors, cyberpunk tropes, pixel art, 3D-rendered objects, floppy disks, VHS degradation and lots of Japanese kanji. There are no proper rules when talking about vaporwave and that is why most of the time it sounds confusing.\n\nFor many people, Vaporwave is something that you need to see in order to understand. And that is why we put together for you 25 artworks we found online and better explained to us what the Vaporwave Aesthetic represents.\n\n· E N J O Y · 楽しんで ·\n\nVaporwave Artwork & More!\n\nThis awesome design trend is like stepping into a mash-up of the past and digital dreams. It’s not just about the music; it’s about capturing a vibe that’s both nostalgic and a bit tongue-in-cheek. The 25 artworks we picked out really show off what Vaporwave’s all about.\n\nYou’ve got those classic statues looking like they’ve time-traveled to a neon-drenched future, pixelated sunsets that feel like they’ve been pulled straight from an old video game, and a bunch of other elements that throw back to the 90s and 80s. It’s all about mixing and matching stuff that shouldn’t work together but somehow does.\n\nVapor is kind of hard to pin down because it’s all over the place, but that’s what makes it cool. It’s like a visual mixtape of everything from old ads and tech to retro anime and cyberpunk vibes, all sprinkled with Japanese text. Checking out these artworks is the best way to get what Vaporwave is all about. It’s more than just a style; it’s like a weird trip down memory lane, where everything’s just a bit off but in a good way."
