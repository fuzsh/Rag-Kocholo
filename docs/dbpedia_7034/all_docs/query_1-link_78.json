        "text": "In a world charged by capitalism, nostalgia is more than just a feeling—it's a commodity; one that responds to modernity through a poignant longing of the past.\n\nNostalgia plays a formidable role in postmodern art. Despite often being considered a faux-pas by the modern art world, many artists have come to realize that memories sell.\n\nEnter, the Vaporwave aesthetic: a genre of digital art that emerged in the 2010’s whose primary focus was to evoke a sense of yearning for a time and space that has never existed.\n\nCharacterized by a careful blend of old and new artistic styles, Vaporwave art offers its audience a surreal window into the past through the present, and vice versa. In this way, Vaporwave creates a space that is both foreign and familiar, which is achieved through the coexistence of familiar icons and incongruent backgrounds; of analogue and digital.\n\nExisting together in a single space, these married elements result in an art form that evokes a sense of nostalgia on one hand and a sense of curiosity on the other. This is done through reconstructing what we know as objects of the past and adding new meaning to them.\n\nOften pervaded with Japanese iconography, Vaporwave art pays homage to a culture in which nostalgia reigns supreme in the people’s collective cultural memory. In Japanese culture, however, this is not necessarily a negatively charged emotion. The Japanese word natsukashii closely translates to a positive, fond appreciation of a past that can never be returned to. This is the evocation of the Vaporwave aesthetic.\n\nVaporwave art also sets forth a critique of consumer capitalism. This is in part due to its appropriation of pop culture icons and the neon-retro aesthetic of the 80s and 90s. It is also comparable to other anticapitalist genres like cyberpunk. Because of this, Vaporwave is often considered a parodical commentary of 20th century capitalism and the egalitarian promises that came with it - another lost time only accessible through our collective memory.\n\nBy carefully constructing a space of interaction between old and new, Vaporwave art represents the commodification of nostalgia and of the past itself. It follows a long history of marketing or ‘retrotyping’ the past - however unfamiliar it may be - as an emotive tool to help bridge the gap between was and what is; what could have been and what will never be.\n\nIn this sense, Vaporwave art is made real through imagination. It is an expression of the longing for a past that exists not in memory, but in our mind’s eye."
