        "text": "Over my winter break, on a rainy night in Memphis Tennessee, I made the short drive to my fellow actor turned hairstylist’s house to get my hair done but would soon be introduced to my new favorite genre. Jarrad Baker, my long-time cohort in the Memphis theatre community, and I became friends shortly after we realized a mutual love of music, music festivals, and his expertise in funky hair colors. For two years now, we would hang out and listen to our current jams and new music discoveries while waiting for my hair to absorb whatever color we were poisoning it with. This specific time while waiting for my hair to turn a silvery lavender color, he showed me his momentary go to genre: vaporwave. I had never heard anything like it. The format we listened to it on was YouTube on a giant flat screen, so the soothing electronic noises were accompanied by album work that looked like patchwork of bright colors, shapes, and computer-generated images, adding to the overall mood of the music. I loved it because the music did not require attention to grasp it’s meaning. It just provided us with background music that completely added an aura of calmness.\n\nVaporwave music consists of mainly electronic music with elements of smooth jazz with influence from 80’s and 90’s pop. Occasionally, songs are sampled in vaporwave, but are usually slowed down, pitched, or remixed. The songs on a vaporwave album are usually a continuous flow without breaks or consist of songs stretching very long in play time. Tunes are usually mellow, allowing the feeling of relaxation to permit and put the listener in a trance like state. I would not use the terms happy or peppy to describe the songs, but have a calming tone, despite the sadness. Songs usually remind me of video game scores, without consistent lyrics adding an epic, animated world sense to the songs. Reddit platform have called this music “the music of abandoned malls,” rightly so.\n\nThe genre gained popularity as it became a commentary on pop culture’s frivolous nature and a satire of EDM. The album artwork also plays an integral part on the genre growing from just a style of music into an aesthetic. Wikipedia describes the art as incorporating “early Internet imagery, late 199’0s web design, glitch art, anime, 3D-rendered objects, and cyberpunk tropes in its cover artwork and music videos.”\n\nDevout fans of original vaporwave have shown discontent on the direction of the genre as it has been commercialized by the very industry it once criticized. Personally, without the original intent of mockery, the comforting melodies still give me a sense of tranquility without leaving me bored. Many subgenres have emerged from this trend, primarily on YouTube and band camp, such as: Simpson wave, a meme-like trend that syncs up Homer Simpson’s voice, from the hit show The Simpsons, to vaporwave tracks, and more concerning trends like Fashwave; a genre that plays on the word “fascist” and promotes alt right ideas with the accompaniment of Nazi images. A smaller trend in the vaporwave community right now is a trend called Trumpwave which is exactly what you think it is.\n\nThe first vaporwave artist I developed an affinity for was MACINTOSH Plus, a one-time stage name used by the DJ Vektroid. He released an album in 2011 called Floral Shoppe via Bandcamp that has since become one of the genre defining albums of vaporwave, gaining major popularity on the internet. Every song listed includes a sample of a mainstream pop song throughout the past 3 decades.\n\nAn interesting pattern persisting the vaporwave community is way the creators stay almost anonymous. Unlike many popular genres, the producers’ names are not usually associated with their tracks. The namelessness of artists adds a mysterious effect to the music itself. Instead of worshipping at their feet, listeners often have a feeling of appreciation for the creator who produced his track in the basement of his house."
