        "text": "New Retro Blog — 80's RSS\n\nWhat is Vaporwave - Eveything About Genre and History\n\nWhat Makes Something Vaporwave, It's History and What is Called Vaporwave I remember it was about two years ago that I was first introduced to Vaporwave, it was an off chance click, a small little tap of the finger, and because of that I saw something that made me say to myself with ideals of grandeur comparable to those of the colonists for the first time coming into contact with the Native Americans. After reading the blog by the essayist behind This Exists I remember first listening to that one song that everyone knows but just refers to as Macintosh Plus 420. I thought it was pretty shit. I remember listening to Blank Banshee's album with a picture of Laura...\n\nContinue reading\n\nDaily Life and Popular Culture in the 1980s\n\nAmerican Life in the 80s The 1980s were an exciting time for Americans. Many new types of technology and forms of entertainment were emerging. What were some of these new items? What was daily life like in the 1980s? Families in the 80s The American family was changing in the 1980s.

Who Started it ?\n\nRetrowave Hello, What is retrowave? Could it be anything made in today's day and aged stylized to eighties anime? Could it be this cool-looking font on the poster from the movie drive? Could it be a wave of water named Gerald who likes to listen to outdated music? Well maybe it's all of those things but maybe it's also none of those things possibly. Retrowave or synthwave as it's commonly known can mean a variety of different things for many different people for some it's confined to a musical genre and for others it's a distinct style or a way of expression and for some it's just a joke to enjoy ironically. But I think it's anything with an absurd...\n\nContinue reading\n\nThe History of Synthwave\n\nDo you remember the 80's? The era of roller skates, VHS and Walkman cassette, the golden age of neon’s, synths and future. The 80’s were an era when we used to fantasize a lot about the future. From the dystopian post-apocalyptic vision of the future to the high-tech utopian fantasy, the 80’s were like a draft of the present. The Legend of Synthwave The nostalgia of that spirit led, at the beginning of the 2000s, to the appearance of a new kind of electronic music that goes by the name of Synthwave. A new kind of music ? Well, not completely. That’s why today we go back, to the future! You may have noticed there’s a lot of nostalgia going...\n\nContinue reading"
