        "text": "Let’s discuss a bit about Vaporwave in general. Be assured, I will not go deep in this article, but wish to go through the basics. Ready? Hit play and scroll!\n\nHistory of Vaporwave\n\nIf I have to describe it shortly, I would say: Vaporwave is a sub-genre of electronic music. It has emerged in the early 2010s, maybe a bit earlier. I believe it is the best way to characterize it with a distinct aesthetic that often incorporates elements of 1980s and 1990s pop culture.\n\nWhat does it actually mean? You need to think of elements such as retro computer graphics, early internet imagery, and corporate logos. As for the music itself, it is often features slowed-down and pitch-shifted samples from lounge, easy listening, and smooth jazz records. But it may feature chopped and screwed R&B, funk and disco tracks either. I mean the more popular it became, the more examples you may find.\n\nThe genre is often associated with a specific visual aesthetic, which includes glitch art and neon-lit landscapes.\n\nVaporwave as a genre is notable for its use of irony, nostalgia, and satire in its music and imagery. It often comments on consumer culture, capitalism and the nostalgia of the pre-internet era. Kind of a reminiscence, but a bit far from the lofi type of warm vibe.\n\nWhere to find it?\n\nVaporwave is often produced and distributed online. You can find tons of playlists on Spotify and enjoy arts and visuals on Twitter and YouTube as well. This genre is more like a phenomenon that is with us both visually and audio-wise. It’s often created by anonymous or pseudonymous artists, especially if they are to express criticism. The genre has also affected and created several subgenres such as future funk and hypnagogic pop.\n\nLatte Chill and Vaporwave\n\nI do not offer too many Vaporwave beats for now. The most notable EP would be Akira. It stands between Vapor and Electro to my point of view. I mean it is fully inspired by a famous anime in the ’80s. Aesthetic-wise I am connecting to that vibe with the samples as well, but I wanted to make it more upbeat and offered no major criticism. As I am not a fan of too many criticism, it is more my music, where I experimented with the genre.\n\nIf you have some time, check the link above, you may find and listen to a very short beat. Also, don’t forget to watch the movie. A great one to my point of view.\n\nSumming it up: Vaporwave is a genre of music that offers a distinctive sound with aesthetic and cultural significance, which differentiates it from other electronic music genres."
