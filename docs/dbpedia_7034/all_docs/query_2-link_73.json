        "text": "So far, today, at least 30,000 people have listened to me sing! I didn't do anything at all to bring that about today: it's a passive reality now that my work is out in the world, and one that brings me a lot of joy! This happens frequently when people use the music I created at my contemplative project, CASSIA & MYRRH, for social media videos, or when they listen on streaming sites around the world. And it's how I quickly fulfilled my original goal in 2020 of reaching millions! But the key here is something very important: It only happened because of people who decided it mattered and were willing to show up and back it up with their attention and resources. Like all of the greats - Beethoven, Michaelangelo, Bernini, Mozart -- they were only able to create and transform the world as we know it because of patrons who understood that it was a deeply valuable thing to be a part of their work through financial backing. I have been blessed to experience this in remarkable ways so I can continue to create and compose and share. Across so many genres! Gregorian chant, dance, electro-pop, poetic folk, lullabies. Because of the internet, this support can now be given at every kind of level, with nothing too small or too big. Everyone can be a part of creating beautiful, creative realities through the artists they love. It's incredible. Investment is important, too, and there are lots of opportunities for those kinds of arrangements for scaling great things with real profit (like at the Center for Human Nobility), but the patron model is also one deeply meaningful to those who participate in it, especially as the world seems to continue to spin out into more and more chaos. I'd love to have you be a part of everything we are building to revive arts & culture in America & beyond, as well as my own work. Visit here to learn more as I continue to create & help others do the same: https://lnkd.in/evZpCduC\n\nWho’s the most talented musician out there? Paul McCartney? Beyoncé? Lizzo? How about Dimash Kudaibergen? Who? I don’t blame you if you’ve never heard of Dimash. He’s mostly popular in Kazakhstan. Born with perfect pitch, Dimash can hit notes over an astonishing six octave range. He plays seven different instruments and can sing in twelve different languages. He has sung and played in a wide variety of genres, from classical to jazz to opera to pop. And to top it all off, he’s just 27 years old. Now, you might be asking yourself, “If he’s so good, how come he’s not more famous?” And that’s a great question. How come someone as clearly talented as Dimash Kudaibergen isn’t a household name? Because being great, or having a great product, is only half the battle. The reality is, you can be as talented as Dimash or whatever young musical prodigy out there that’s even better and still never find an audience. You can have all the talent and skill in the world, but unless you know how to get people’s attention, you’ll never get off the ground. In the 80’s, the Betamax format was widely considered to be a better technical product than VHS, but VHS won anyway with superior marketing. Now, this isn’t to say that you should focus all your efforts on marketing. Clever Hook Points can help you stand out and get people to pay attention, but without something substantive to offer, you’re not going to hold their attention for very long. By using Hook Points to better contextualize your amazing products and services and communicate the full value you’re offering your customers, you’ll set yourself up for success.

A well-crafted sales message speaks to your audience's emotions, values, and desires. Most people make decisions, like purchasing concert tickets, based on emotions and then justify them with logic. Discover a night where elegance meets edge--experience live classical music as bold and vibrant as you are. Perfectly curated for your world, this isn't just a concert; it's a new way to elevate your nights and expand your cultural vibe. Your new ticket buyers are thinking, I’m a cool person; I do cool things; the symphony is thinking about me and my needs; I can post about this cool thing on my social channels; going to the symphony will elevate my social status. Speak to your audience in a way that they can relate to, and they'll come to your concerts. Easy. Onward! Ben\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/e9TvpCYF \"Feed The Animal - 8bit\" delves into the realm of Deep House with a technical twist that hearkens back to its origins, using the unique sound of 8bit to open up new dimensions of musical sensation. This mix represents a fusion where the minimalist, often understated pulse of Deep House meets the distinctive, pixelated tones of 8bit music, crafting a sound that is both nostalgically retro and refreshingly modern. The journey of \"Feed The Animal\" is about exploring the edges of Deep House through the lens of 8bit sounds, providing a bridge between the deep, pulsating rhythms of traditional Deep House and the quirky, electronic chirps of 8bit music. This blend allows listeners to experience a familiar genre in a completely new way, transforming the deep bass lines and smooth flows of Deep House with the playful and intricate bleeps of 8bit. As the mix progresses, what begins with a minimalist approach gradually evolves, gaining a progressive character. This progression isn't just about increasing complexity or intensity in the sound but about how these 8bit influences can add layers of texture and rhythm that make the familiar feel entirely new and exciting. The narrative of \"Feed The Animal\" is crafted to highlight this evolution—from a deep and deliberate start to a crescendo of energetic, progressive sounds. This mix invites listeners to feed their musical curiosity, to embrace the unconventional marriage of Deep House and 8bit, and to discover how this fusion can lead to an enriched auditory experience. #FeedTheAnimal8bit #DeepHouse8bit #TechnicalTwist #NewMusicDimensions #RetroModernFusion #DeepHouseJourney #8bitSounds #ProgressiveCharacter #MusicalFusion #InnovativeSounds #DeepBassLines #PulsatingRhythms #PixelatedTones #MusicEvolution #AuditoryExploration\n\nWhy emotions stirred by music create such powerful memories As time unfolds, people need to group information, since there is too much to remember (and not all of it useful). Two processes appear to be involved in turning experiences into memories over time: The first integrates our memories, compressing and linking them into individualized episodes; the other expands and separates each memory as the experience recedes into the past. There’s a constant tug of war between integrating memories and separating them, and it’s this push and pull that helps to form distinct memories. This flexible process helps a person understand and find meaning in their experiences, as well as retain information. “It’s like putting items into boxes for long-term storage,” said corresponding author. “When we need to retrieve a piece of information, we open the box that holds it. What this research shows is that emotions seem to be an effective box for doing this sort of organization and for making memories more accessible.” A similar effect may help explain why Taylor Swift’s “Eras Tour” has been so effective at creating vivid and lasting memories: Her concert contains meaningful chapters that can be opened and closed to relive highly emotional experiences. #ScienceMission #sciencenewshighlights https://lnkd.in/gp-Mu3MU"
