        "text": "Black Mamba is not only one of the world’s greatest basketball players of all time….\n\nIt is also a fantastic cannabis strain that packs a powerful high that will carry you and the whole team to victory. In this poster you may notice that there are 8 Palms Trees and 24 Stars paying homage to the jersey worn by Black Mamba! Rest In Power Kobe.\n\nBlack Mamba Artist, Dana Ulema, has always been heavily inspired by music, movies and pop culture and drawing a lot as a young child all the way to about 16 years old she started mastering photoshop. Dana’s first digital paintings were a series of deeply psychedelic art inspired by psy-trance/ Goa, science-fiction and drug culture. Naturally Dana’s styles has morphed over the years an now she is really into 80’s aesthetics, Vaporwave, Cyberpunk and the subject of technology and a dystopian future.\n\nDana Ulema was born in Bonn, Germany and grew up on the beautiful countryside in Rhineland-Palatinate, she is half German/ half Syrian and originally wanted to become a fashion designer, but dropped out after two years of fashion school in Cologne. Dana pivoted and began studying communications design and got a degree in 2013. After that, she began working as a graphic designer/ illustrator in Berlin with Clipper Lighters for 6 years before becoming a freelancer. Dana still does traditional drawing with black ink from, but my medium of choice is Adobe Illustrator. Califari is thrilled to be working with her!"
