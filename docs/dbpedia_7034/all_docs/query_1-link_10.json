Many vaporwave artists have incorporated elements of seapunk and other cyberpunk aesthetics into their music and art, and the genre has helped to bring the seapunk aesthetic to a wider audience.\n\nIn conclusion, seapunk is a subculture that originated in the early 2010s and is characterized by a futuristic, ocean-themed aesthetic.
