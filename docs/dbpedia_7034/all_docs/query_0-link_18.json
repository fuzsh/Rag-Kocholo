Having undergone several recontextualizations and revivals in its country of origin, the genre has recently gained an international following among young Internet users. The most enthusiastic of City Pop’s new fans meet in social media groups and online forums; as of late 2020, a dozen fan communities on Facebook and Reddit have amassed a combined following of over 60,000 members.\n\nAt first sight, the community make-up, the aesthetic themes and the listening practices prevalent among City Pop fans appear to share some similarities with other recently emerged Internet-mediated music genres such as Vaporwave or Lo-fi Hip Hop. Yet we know little about this community. Who are these fans? How do they engage with the music, and with each other? Given the contested definition of City Pop in Japan proper, how do foreign fans characterize City Pop? What does the music mean to them, and how do they engage with Japanese culture?\n\nAs a first step towards answering these questions, we conducted an online survey among members of the largest Internet- based City Pop fan communities. In spite of their culturally and geographically diverse backgrounds, respondents (n = 575) share a clearly defined image of the genre that diverges in some aspects from common Japanese definitions of ‘City Pop’. Based on the results of the survey, we affirm that (1) the international City Pop community skews young and male but has strong transnational characteristics, (2) City Pop in this context is an Internet-based genre largely focused on online activities while allowing for a wide range of musical tastes and activities, and (3) the community overlaps with other international fandoms based on Japanese popular culture. Results also show that (4) City Pop is strongly identified with themes of nostalgia and escapism. Through City Pop’s reconceptualization as the soundtrack to an idealized 1980s Japan, these themes appear to find a more specific and clearly defined expression in this community than in adjacent Internet- based genres.\n\nThis essay will concern itself with exploring the nostalgia wave present in popular culture beginning with the 21st century, while exploring more in deep the internet born electronic music micro genre called vaporwave.

Of vaporwave, I will be conducting a philosophical analysis through the lens of hauntology as coined by Jacque Derrida and later popularized by Mark Fisher. Furthermore, in the second part of the essay I will also pinpoint several causes to the nostalgia and hauntological wave that characterize our century using again Mark Fisher’s ideas and Pierre Bourdieu’s sociology, more precisely his ontological determinism. The main focus of the essay is popular culture, especially music, from the western hemisphere (USA and UK).\n\nThe aim of this essay is to analyse the emergence of vaporwave and contextualize the genre within postmodernism.

It shall firstly provide an overview of the genre’s characteristics and background, and it will subsequently examine the political and social messages that the associated artists are trying to convey, relating these to the conceptual framework of postmodern theory. Finally, the essay shall exemplify the relation between vaporwave and postmodernism through an analysis of the sonic and iconographic elements of the hexalogy of films created by Blank Banshee for the promotion of Blank Banshee 1 (2013).\n\nMémoire de musicologie (Master I recherche), présenté par Gabriel ROUET au sein de l'Université de Bourgogne.

En effet, au début du XXIème siècle, grâce à l'ordinateur et internet, la musique est devenu malléable et hyper-accessible.

My focus was to decrypt and understand how these living spaces are organized, and how their specificities generated singular music and behaviours. Indeed, at the beginning of the XXIth century, thanks to the computer and the internet, music became adaptable and hyper-available. Those devices defined our relations with music, and vaporwave, as one of the first musical genre that was born and prospered on the internet, embodies this idea. Those new means of communication revolutionized our way of organizing, building and living together. The public virtual plazas are numerous and the private conversations are international. This redefining of the objects, and thus the space, give way to new musical and social practices, and highlights the anonymity and pseudonymity of relationships. My methodology was to do a virtual field study based on the observations of the internet spaces and to interview, via web chat, artists, mediators and audiences all over the world. The sociological tool proved to be relevant to analyse this musical movement. As one of the first genre of music organized online, vaporwave provided a suitable example for exploration of the interactions between each world, the websites, as part of one universe, the web.\n\nContact : gabriel.rouet@gmail.com\n\nIn a society on the road to globalization through a neoliberal economic system and pervasive information networks, it seems counterintuitive to propose that an artistic movement can be critical of this situation by using visual elements... more\n\nIn a society on the road to globalization through a neoliberal economic system and pervasive information networks, it seems counterintuitive to propose that an artistic movement can be critical of this situation by using visual elements such as shopping malls and the music aimed to ambient it, muzak. The Internet has not only brought more ways to keep the world interconnected, but also new artistic practices. It is in this world that vaporwave stands out, as it is a musical Internet phenomenon that is closely intertwined with a visual aesthetic.\n\nThe aim of this paper is firstly to describe the aesthetics of vaporwave and to apply a media aesthetics methodology to it by analysing the re-contextualization of the music and their visual aesthetics through glitch and remix techniques of what I have called “the dystopian shopping malls”. This then becomes a convergence between music and visual representation of malls, which helps situate this type of musical expression in the field of Media Art.\n\nUnder the post-digital critical framework, the second point of the essay provides a critically understanding of what kind of relations between society, cyberspaces, and networks are being produced and represented by Vaporwave, which can also be read as statements against current economic system values and lifestyle. With this in mind, I will deepen the aesthetics aspects of the genre to support my argument that vaporwave is a networked music product haunted by culture references of past representations of the future. Finally, the last segment of this article discusses how this kind of Internet-based communities and artistic expressions can be preserved and documented taking into consideration the characteristics of the movement so that it does not lose fidelity or sense, since vaporwave has many characteristics that must be understood in order to succeed in the preservation of this digital culture.\n\nHow to cite:\n\nZavala Barreda, Karla.

As a genre, vaporwave is a style of music collaged together from a wide variety of largely background musics such as muzak ® , 1980s elevator music and new age ambience. Vaporwave's 'memory play' is a project that takes remembering as its audiovisual aesthetic. The pleasure of vaporwave is therefore understood as a pleasure of remembering for the sake of the act of remembering itself. To explore this theme, I examine vaporwave's memory play using the terms of Chris Healy's 'compen-satory nostalgia', as well as the idea of 'ersatz nostalgia' as discussed by Arjun Appadurai and Svetlana Boym.\n\nThere exists a tenacious dichotomy between the 'organic' and the 'synthetic' in electronic music.

In spite of immediate opposing qualities, they instill sensations of each other in practice: Acoustic sounds are subject to artificial mimicry while algorithmic music can present an imitation of human creativity. This presents a post-human aesthetic that questions if there are echoes of life in the machine. This paper investigates how sonic aesthetics in the borderlands between electronic avant-garde, pop and club music have changed after 2010. I approach these aesthetics through Brian Massumi's notions of 'semblance' and 'animateness' as abstract monikers to assist in the tracing of meta-aesthetic experiences of machine-life, genre, musical structure and the listening to known-unknown noise. The idea of a post-Internet society acts as framework for the intimate relation between pop and avant-garde in contemporary electronic music. This relation is a result of a sonic contextualization of late-capitalist society via the Internet. Finally I discuss how pop is the noise in the avant-garde and how the human in a post-Internet era presents itself through synthetic plasticity.\n\nVaporwave is the subculture emerging on the internet.

This essay uses the visualization of vaporwave to illustrate the world that I would call it ‘The Posthumanism Paradise’ because there has no absolute boundaries of species and has non-existence of geography and time. It can also be seen as the alternative fables of the internet, ‘The Virtual Space.’ I insist on using vaporwave as we can see this virtual reality more vivid, explicit, at the same time, dreaming.\n\nVaporwave’s posthumanism paradise became not only to teach us how we should deal with each other, with the ‘digital companion species,’ but also because it has already existed in our present and haunted us since the moment of our consumption in the virtual reality.\n\nThe roots of the cultural object called vaporwave are often traced to the year 2009, however, the qualities that define it are still being discussed in both the discourse of popular culture as well as in an academic context.

Ranging from being defined as a microgenre of electronic music, a meme, an art movement, a critique of capitalism to a being defined as a form of pure aesthetics it remains a multifaceted object for research. In this paper, I explore examples of vaporwave in order to distinguish the methods and strategies used for creating something that is called\n\nvaporwave, rather than in an attempt to label it as some particular thing. As a further step in this inquiry to vaporwave, I document an attempt to apply these methods and strategies that resulted in a published music album. A practice-based approach to analysing vaporwave by creating and publishing it does help to understand some core qualities of it.\n\nThis dissertation examines the theses of Theodor Adorno’s aesthetic theory and his criticism of the culture industry, and attempts to develop his ideas in order to rethink how his theory might help us understand postmodernist aesthetics... more\n\nThis dissertation examines the theses of Theodor Adorno’s aesthetic theory and his criticism of the culture industry, and attempts to develop his ideas in order to rethink how his theory might help us understand postmodernist aesthetics in regards to music. Specifically, I am interested in his idea of failure, concerning what exactly it is that the musical work is supposed to do, and how this relates to the concept of authenticity. I use the heterogeneous umbrella term of “underground music” to open up a diverse array of musical genres positioned with a broadly antagonistic stance towards the culture industry. My approach uses three different approaches: Firstly, I consider Adorno’s conflicted appreciation of Stravinsky’s music, and use some flexibilities it presents to explore how we might rethink the function of timbre in Adorno’s aesthetics. Next I attempt to rethink Adorno’s concept of how authentic art should develop a historically mediated form, applying it to contemporary art with a heritage of diverse avant-garde techniques and an increasing tendency of the culture industry to permeate into everyday life, examining the genre of “vaporwave” music. Finally I consider underground music’s relationship with the idea of authenticity, and what form political music might take.\n\nVaporwave, first emerging in the early 2010s, is a genre of music characterised by extensive sampling of earlier “elevator music,” such as smooth jazz, MoR, easy listening, and muzak.

Audio and visual markers of the 1980s and 1990s, white-collar workspaces, media technology, and advertising are prominent features of the aesthetic. The (academic, vernacular, and press) writing about vaporwave commonly positions the genre as an ironic or ambivalent critique of contemporary capitalism, exploring the implications of vaporwave for understandings of temporality, memory and technology. The interpretive and discursive labour of producing, discussing and contesting this positioning, described here as “genre work,” serves to constitute and sediment the intelligibility and coherence of the genre. This paper explores how the narrative of vaporwave as an aesthetic critique of late capitalism has been developed, articulated, and disputed through this genre work. We attend specifically to the limits around how this narrative functions as a pedagogical or sensitising device, instructing readers and listeners in how to understand and discuss musical affect, the nature and function of descriptions of music, and perhaps most importantly, the nature of critique, and of capitalism as something meriting such critique.\n\nIn Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism, Frederic Jameson (1991) mentions an \"aesthetic of cognitive mapping\" as a new form of radical aesthetic practice to deal with the set of historical situations and problems... more\n\nIn Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism, Frederic Jameson (1991) mentions an \"aesthetic of cognitive mapping\" as a new form of radical aesthetic practice to deal with the set of historical situations and problems symptomatic of late capitalism. For Jameson (1991), cognitive mapping functions as a tool for postmodern subjects to represent the totality of the global late capitalist system, allowing them to situate themselves within the system, and to reenact the critique of capitalism that has been neutralized by postmodernist confusion. While Jameson's notion of cognitive mapping, and specifically its question of how to represent the totality of the late capitalist system, has been taken up by a number of poststructuralist critical race theorists and social geographers (Bartolovich, 2000; Beverly, 2000; Tally Jr., 2000), relatively little attention has been paid to the cognitive mapping of postmodern affect. Drawing upon a close reading of the music and visual art of the nostalgic internet-based \"vaporwave\" aesthetic alongside Jameson's postmodern theory and the affect theory of Raymond Williams (1977) and Brian Massumi (1995; 1998), this essay argues that vaporwave can be understood as an attempt to aestheticize and thereby map out the affective climate circulating in late capitalist consumer culture. More specifically, this paper argues that through its somewhat obsessive hypersaturation with retro commodities and aesthetics from the 1980s and 1990s, vaporwave simultaneously critiques the salient characteristics of late capitalism such as pastiche, depthlessness, and waning of affect, and enacts a nostalgic longing for a modernism that is fleeing further and further into an inaccessible history. This paper seeks to illustrate the potentiality of Jameson's cognitive mapping project in the realm of affect, and investigate the relationship between late capitalist affect and subcultural aesthetics.\n\nThis article argues that the production and reception of certain recent electronic musics has resonated with criticisms of the perceived degenerative effects of digital technology on culture and 'humanity' – such as the lack of attention... more\n\nThis article argues that the production and reception of certain recent electronic musics has resonated with criticisms of the perceived degenerative effects of digital technology on culture and 'humanity' – such as the lack of attention it promotes or the 'information overload' it causes – in an at least partially positive way. The resulting ambivalent aesthetics, sometimes thought of as one of 'Internet music', embraces particular negative notions of digital mediation in ways that can and have been thought of as satirical, exploratory or 'accelerationist'. I examine three facets of this aesthetics: maximalism, kitsch and the uncanny valley. I also question the legitimacy of dramatising, even positively, digital media and culture as effectively 'degenerate'.\n\nVVitchVVavve: Post-Digital Aesthetics Exhibition, Symposium and archive (2018-9) VVitchVvavve curated by Nancy Mauro-Flude and Thomas Penney responded to Cramer’s (2012) interrogation of Post-digital Aesthetics (PDA) “does the term... more\n\nVVitchVVavve: Post-Digital Aesthetics Exhibition, Symposium and archive (2018-9)\n\nVVitchVvavve curated by Nancy Mauro-Flude and Thomas Penney responded to Cramer’s (2012) interrogation of Post-digital Aesthetics (PDA) “does the term still make any sense?

Vaporwave is a microgenre of music that emerged on the Internet in the 2010s. It is characterized by an extensive use of slowed-down audio loops sampled from kitschy sources, such as easy-listening and mall music. The microgenre's aesthetics are inspired by the early days of the Internet, as exemplified in the musical piece リサフランク 420 / 現代のコンピュ (Lisa Frank 420 / Modern Computing) by Macin-tosh Plus. This article rethinks teaching methods that rely on anti-rhetorical tropes such as irony, detachment, or appeals to authenticity to discuss philosophical concepts related to public discourse and consumerism. It shows instead that vaporwave creations do not suppress the intimate affective relationships students have developed with brands and consumption practices. This article then develops a vaporwave-informed pedagogy which allows teachers and students to investigate these socioeconomic connections and myths through creation , and productively considers their capacity to reshape local media ecologies."
