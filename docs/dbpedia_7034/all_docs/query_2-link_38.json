        "text": "Location\n\nCalifornia, United States\n\nSubject Fields\n\nEast Asian History / Studies, Japanese History / Studies, Music and Music History, Popular Culture Studies, Southeast Asian History / Studies\n\nCity Pop (シティ・ポップ) emerged first in Tokyo in the late seventies and early eighties, spreading to Seoul through international producers, reaching other parts of Northeast (China and Taiwan) and Southeast Asia (Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia) and even finding something of itself in Los Angeles, California. A reaction against the musical influences of former decades, City Pop embraced not only Japan’s more western-influenced new music (what we might now refer to as J-Pop) but also funk, disco, rhythm and blues, adult-oriented rock, soft rock, and boogie among others. In many ways, Tokyo nights had finally stepped into a more global daylight.\n\nAs the genre’s popularity surged, it became synonymous with urban lifestyle and identity, reflecting the vibrant and dynamic energy of an otherwise burgeoning metropolis. As such, the influence of City Pop extended beyond music, shaping fashion and aesthetics, ultimately capturing the essence of an era characterized by economic prosperity, advancements in music technology, and cultural evolution. Though the genre of City Pop eventually faded, a phenomenon that may be attributed in part not only to the bursting of Japan’s economic bubble but shifting musical trends and evolving societal tastes, its resurgence in recent years, especially in the west, not only underscores an ever-evolving tapestry of global music and culture but also raises many questions involving musical landscapes, cultural dynamics, and nostalgia. However, little to date has been written about City Pop from a scholarly perspective. The gap here is further stressed by attempts to explore the query ‘City Pop’ on search platforms that instead prompt unrelated suggestions, and many of the scholarly accounts that do exist may very well be characterized by their cursory nature, providing only brief and superficial examinations of an otherwise complex matter.\n\nIn this therefore timely collection, we attempt to begin correcting matters by endeavoring to justify the interdisciplinary examination of City Pop within the broader scholarly context and interdisciplinary study of global music trends, cultural exchanges, and socio-economic developments. In doing so, we seek contributions from early and established career scholars that not only provide a chronological overview of City Pop’s emergence, decline, and resurgence from the seventies through the present day, but also, through a series of detailed and specific case studies, we seek contributions that offer a nuanced perspective on the regional and global musical and cultural significance of the genre by navigating the intricacies surrounding questions including but not limited to the following…\n\nHow did City Pop evolve from its origins in Tokyo to influence other regions like Seoul, other parts of Northeast and Southeast Asia, and the West Coast of the US, creating a transcontinental musical dialogue?\n\nWhat specific elements of City Pop contributed to its cross-cultural appeal?\n\nHow did artists in different regions reinterpret City Pop, adding their unique cultural influences?\n\nWhat role did globalization play in the spread of City Pop beyond its Japanese origins? And what role has glocalization played, if any?\n\nTo what extent did the rise and fall of City Pop correlate with Japan's economic bubble, and how did economic conditions shape the music and vice versa, providing a nuanced understanding of the symbiotic relationship between art and economics?\n\nHow did City Pop artists reflect the economic optimism during the bubble era in their music?\n\nIn what ways did economic downturns influence the themes and tone of City Pop music, if at all?\n\nCity Pop's decline coincide with broader economic shifts, how did this impact the genre's trajectory?\n\nWhat was the impact of international producers on the global dissemination of City Pop, especially in places like Los Angeles where some City Pop albums were recorded, and how did the genre incorporate diverse musical influences, contributing to its cross-cultural evolution?\n\nHow did collaboration with international producers shape the sound of City Pop?\n\nIn what ways did City Pop artists blend diverse musical genres into their work?\n\nDid the global impact of City Pop lead to a fusion of cultural elements in its evolution?\n\nIn what ways did City Pop influence fashion trends and aesthetics in urban settings, and how was this relationship symbiotic, exploring the dynamic interplay between music and visual culture?\n\nHow did City Pop album covers and music videos influence fashion and design trends?\n\nDid fashion trends and visual aesthetics reciprocally influence the evolution of City Pop?\n\nHow did the visual elements of City Pop contribute to its overall cultural impact?\n\nHow does the City Pop revival intersect with the contemporary Vaporwave/Synthwave trends, both of which nostalgically evoke distinct periods in musical and visual aesthetics, and what insights can be gained from exploring their interconnectedness in the broader context of cultural nostalgia?\n\nWhat similarities and differences exist between the nostalgic elements in City Pop and Vaporwave/Synthwave?\n\nHow do artists navigate the tension between nostalgia and innovation in these musical revivals?\n\nAre there shared cultural or societal factors driving the resurgence of both City Pop and Vaporwave/Synthwave?\n\nHow did advancements in music technology during the emergence of City Pop influence the genre's sound and production, and what role did technological innovation play in shaping its distinctive sonic landscape?\n\nWhat specific technological advancements had the most significant impact on City Pop's production?\n\nHow did City Pop artists embrace or resist new technologies in their creative process?\n\nDid the use of certain instruments or recording techniques contribute to the genre's unique sound?\n\nIn specific regions, how did City Pop contribute to the construction of urban identities and impact local cultures, shedding light on its role in shaping regional identities and cultural landscapes?\n\nHow did City Pop capture the essence of specific urban environments in its music?\n\nDid City Pop contribute to the formation of a distinct cultural identity in certain regions?\n\nIn what ways did local cultures influence the interpretation and reception of City Pop?\n\nWhat role did social media play in the resurgence of City Pop, particularly in the West, and how has globalization facilitated the rediscovery of this genre, examining the influence of digital platforms on the revival of niche musical movements?\n\nHow did social media platforms contribute to the global visibility of City Pop?\n\nWere there specific online communities or influencers that played a pivotal role in the resurgence?\n\nTo what extent did the ease of access to music through digital platforms impact the rediscovery of City Pop?\n\nHow did Miki Matsubara's \"Mayonaka no Door (Stay with Me),\" or any other popular title, impact Japanese music during the height of City Pop’s popularity, and what has been its cultural legacy since the increased Western interest in City Pop in the 2000s?\n\nHow did standout tracks contribute to the broader success and recognition of City Pop?\n\nDid specific songs play a role in shaping the perception of City Pop both in Japan and internationally?\n\nWhat is the enduring cultural legacy of these iconic City Pop tracks?\n\nHow do global listeners engage with City Pop as a form of nostalgia, and what is the authenticity of this sentiment, considering the era may be idealized or constructed, exploring the complex nature of nostalgic connections to a cultural past?\n\nWhat aspects of City Pop resonate most with global audiences seeking nostalgic experiences?\n\nHow do listeners reconcile their idealized perception of the City Pop era with the reality of that time?\n\nAre there specific cultural or social factors that contribute to the authenticity or constructed nature of nostalgic engagement with City Pop?\n\nIs the phenomenon of false nostalgia in City Pop a reality, and how does it contribute to the listener's sentimental longing for a bygone era not directly experienced, probing the psychological and cultural aspects of perceived nostalgia?\n\nWhat psychological mechanisms contribute to the phenomenon of false nostalgia in City Pop?\n\nHow does the perceived authenticity or inauthenticity of nostalgic feelings impact the listener's experience?\n\nCan false nostalgia in City Pop be seen as a broader cultural phenomenon, and how does it intersect with other nostalgic trends in music and media?\n\nEssays should be no
