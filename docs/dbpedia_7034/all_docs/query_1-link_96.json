        "text": "Do you have an affiliate program?\n\nYes we do! When you join Interior AI's affiliate program you receive a 30% commission on payments for all customers you refer!\n\nHow does Interior AI's AI Interior Designer work?\n\nInterior AI lets you upload photos of your current interior, select a style and redesign it. It takes half a minute to generate and then you get photorealistic renders of your new interior. And best of all, you can do all this from your laptop or phone without having to pay an expensive interior designer $100s or $1000s.\n\nAfter sign up you get access to Interior AI's studio which lets you use 30+ room types and 50+ interior styles.\n\nWhat AI model do you use?\n\nInterior AI uses our own AI generation pipeline which is trained for high photorealism. We keep working on improving it, with better photorealistic data sets, using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) by users like you which constantly improves our models. All of this to get you better more photorealistic renders.\n\nHow much does Interior AI cost?\n\nYou can check current pricing by entering your email in the sign up box and following the link to see the pricing table. You get 6 months free if you subscribe annually. You can cancel at any time.\n\nDo you have an iOS app?\n\nNot yet, but very soon!\n\nWhat do the different modes do?\n\nInterior AI has different modes for different purposes.\n\n[ Interior design with 3D Vision ] tries to maintain the interior of your current room while changing its style.\n\n[ Interior design (2D photo) ] is the same but manipulates the space more and does not stick to the 3d objects like furniture that's already in the room.\n\n[ Virtual Staging AI ] is specifically to fill up empty spaces and stage them with furniture.\n\n[ Freestyle ] does not require any input photo, and just generates interior designs from scratch based on the style and room type you picked.\n\n[ Sketch2Image ] converts your interior sketches directly into photorealistic renderings.\n\nAnd finally [ SketchUp ] lets you upload a screenshot from your SketchUp design and it will transform it into a photorealistic render.\n\nCan real estate agents use Interior AI?\n\nYes, Interior AI has a special Virtual Staging AI mode, which lets you fill empty spaces with furniture while maintaing the building's construction. Simple upload a photo, select the room type, and interior design style you'd like to see. Then under Mode, select [ Virtual Staging AI ] and tap [ Create ].\n\nMy payment card is not accepted when signing up?\n\nDue to lots of fraud attempts, we've had to increase our payment security. Firstly, disable your VPN or proxy server. Then make sure your name, CVC and postal code match the one on your payment card and of your bank account. Also your card country should be the same as your billing country. And finally make sure you enable 3D Secure or similar authentication on your card with your bank.\n\nWhat type of photos should I upload as my current interior?\n\nWe recommend uploading photos with in a straight angle towards a wall or window. Photos from angles do work but perform worse than straight photos. Make sure the photo is sharp and clearly lit. The resulting output is heavily reliant on the photo you upload as input.\n\nWhat file formats of photos do you accept as my current interior?\n\nWe accept JPG, PNG, WebP and AVIF files only. HEIC is not supported now, so you'll have to convert those to JPG first\n\nHow long will it take to take an AI photo?\n\nBased on the current processing times, it takes about 56 seconds to take one photo. You can take up to 16 photos in parallel though!\n\nWhat will you do with my interior photos?\n\nWe only use your photos to create AI interior design renders. Your data privacy and security are our top priorities.\n\nWho built and is behind Interior AI?\n\nThis service was built by me, Pieter Levels (@levelsio), a Dutch indie entrepreneur known for other projects like Nomad List, Remote OK, Photo AI and Applicant AI.\n\nHow much will the AI interior designs look like my current interior?\n\nThe resemblance of your interior depends on the quality of photo you upload. The better your photos, the more accurately the AI can understand and represent your home's unique characteristics. We keep improving our models every day.\n\nWill the photos have AI artefacts?\n\nSometimes yes. Depending on the quality of the uploaded photo, and the type of designs you render, you might see some AI artefacts. Any app that uses generative AI imaging will have artefacts. They can be illogical things like chairs with too few legs, illogical construction etc. From our experience, about 95% of renders you make will be good enough, and 5% will be exceptionally good. We also have an editor so you can brush away artefacts yourself and regenerate those parts. We're improving Interior AI every day to reduce artefacts for example by auto-detecting them and then re-trying. But remember it's not perfect yet and we're not promising it is!\n\nIs the payment service secure?\n\nYes, our payment service is secure. We use Stripe for financial processing, and we do not store any information about your card. Stripe ensures bank-level security standards.\n\nWhat methods of payment do you accept?\n\nWe accept payments via credit or debit cards, including MasterCard, VISA, American Express, as well as iDeal, SOFORT, Bancontact, Przelewy24, Giropay, EPS, GrabPay, AliPay, and many more. However, we do not accept PayPal or cryptocurrency and are not planning to.\n\nCan I get a refund?\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot offer refunds as costs incurred for generating AI images are extremely high. In turn, our upstream providers do not let us ask for refunds for the GPU processing time used to generate your AI interior designs. This would make it a loss making endeavor for us. During sign up you agree to withhold your right to refund for this reason.\n\nHow do I cancel my subscription?\n\nYou can cancel your subscription at any time. Go to the top of Interior AI when you are logged in and click Billing, you will be redirected to the billing portal where you can download invoices, switch plans and cancel your subscription.\n\nIf you are not logged in, first login: go to the top of Interior AI's frontpage and enter your email in the email box, click the button to continue.
