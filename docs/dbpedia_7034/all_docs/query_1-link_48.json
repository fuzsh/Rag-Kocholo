Slowly, hot water fills the bathtub.As the steam fills the bathroom, at that moment, you leave the 21st century and return to the 1980s.Not in a rush to get into the bathtub, you sit naked on the toilet, lighting a hand-rolled cigarette. Inhaling the smoke into your belly, it doesn't hurt. Holding the smoke in your lungs, you cough it out in one exhale.Then, slowly making your way to the bathtub, ready to indulge in endless romance and tenderness.\n\nVaporwave\n\nOrigin\n\nVaporwave is a genre of electronic music that initially emerged within internet communities in the early 2010s, and gradually gave rise to a series of visual elements. Focused on 1980s and 1990s American and Japanese pop culture, it explores urban life, commercials, video games, technology, and early internet, with influences from cyberpunk sci-fi. Vaporwave heavily samples smooth jazz, elevator music, and commercial sounds.\n\nCONTENTS\n\n80'S/ FUTURE/ PAST\n\n01.\n\nFeatures\n\n02.\n\nAudio Wise\n\n03.\n\nVideo Wise\n\n04.\n\nSamples\n\n05.\n\nVisual Elements\n\n06.\n\nIn-Class Exercise\n\n07.\n\nAssignment\n\n08.\n\nQ & A\n\n09.\n\nExtended Learning\n\n1-Vaporwave's\n\nStyle\n\n+INFO\n\nVaporwave visually creates a dreamy, bubble-like sense of disillusionment, quickly popular among the youth for its retro-futuristic, casual, jazzy, lo-fi, avant-garde, psychedelic, relaxed,\n\n1-Vaporwave's\n\nStyle\n\n+INFO\n\nhumanistic, sensitive, romantic, empty, dystopian, and eerie vibes. It blends styles like glitch art, pixel art, pop art, cyberpunk, and surrealism, presenting a visual tapestry of old and new, characterized by strong conflicts and contrasts.\n\n2-Audio Wise\n\nStyle\n\nVaporwave music remixes and samples audio from City-Pop and elevator music, blending a laid-back atmosphere and lo-fi characteristics with electronic rhythms and deep bass tones. These styles symbolize the urban prosperity of the 80s and 90s, representing urban life, desire, and capitalism.\n\n2-Audio Wise\n\nStyle\n\nElevator music, in particular, is questioned for its artistic value and consumerist manipulation. Vaporwave distorts music's essence to juxtapose distorted consumerist culture with the symbolic freedom of digital technology, creating a nostalgic, surreal existentialist vibe.\n\n3-Video Wise\n\nStyle\n\nSimilar to the auditory aspect, Vaporwave styles often consciously present a deliberate sense of degradation. Many visual works in the Vaporwave style use low resolution and compressed distortion filters, imitating the aesthetics of old television sets and VHS home video systems. This includes the intentional blurring, occasional flickers, and glitch effects in the imagery.\n\n3-Video Wise\n\nStyle\n\nThese images serve as reminders of technological nostalgia and a critique of society's obsession with constant technological advancement. In terms of visual elements, visual contents are often extracted from 80s to 90s commercial advertisements and Japanese animations, both symbolic of capitalism and prosperity, and are collaged and reshaped.\n\nAmerican Advertisements\n\nJapanese Advertisements + Anime (City Pop)\n\n4-Samples\n\nStyle\n\n5-Visual Element\n\n1.ancient greek Statue\n\n+INFO\n\nSome say it symbolizes a modern renaissance with sculptures and columns, while others argue it contrasts with traditional aesthetics of common plaster statues and modern digital art.\n\n5-Visual Element\n\n2.90's Japanese Anime/Game\n\n+INFO\n\nExpressing preferences of Japanese culture, reminiscing about the simple and delightful entertainment of childhood memories, or praising globalization.\n\n5-Visual Element\n\n3.3D Dolphin\n\nOne game often referenced in Vaporwave is 'Ecco the Dolphin' and its sequels. This game even inspired one of the genre's pioneering albums, Chuck Person's 'EccoJams,' as well as the famous Vaporwave track 'ECCOと悪寒ダイビング' ('ECCO and Icy Diving') by Macintosh Plus from the renowned album 'Floral Shoppe.'\n\n5-Visual Element\n\n3.3D Dolphin\n\nThe music of 'Ecco the Dolphin' is beloved by Vaporwave fans for its psychedelic and immersive Vaporwave atmosphere, contributing to the widespread presence of dolphins in Vaporwave imagery.\n\n5-Visual Element\n\n4.Old electronic\n\nOld electronics, such as vintage televisions, cassette players, and radios, are common symbols in vaporwave art. These nostalgic items from past decades are often used to evoke a sense of retro-futurism and a longing for simpler times.\n\n5-Visual Element\n\n5.internet\n\nImitating the operating system Windows 95 and simple 3D models from the early days of digital art development. These technologies were symbols of high-tech at the time, but now appear quite nostalgic.\n\n5-Visual Element\n\n6.fiji water\n\nFiji is praised for its outstanding aesthetics in the bottled water market, marking a symbolic shift in consumer behavior. Water, a basic life necessity, is often taken for granted in the Western world. Yet, over 10% of the global population lacks access to it, while in developed nations, it is easily available for free or at minimal cost.\n\n5-Visual Element\n\n6.fiji water\n\nDespite millions dying annually from dehydration, consumers are willing to pay $3.99 for a bottle of Fiji artesian water, seeking the ultimate hydration luxury. Fiji is a more classic example, but besides it, we also occasionally see other beverages such as cola, green tea, etc., using exaggerated commercial advertisements to satirize consumerism and materialism, attempting to shape a utopian vision of beauty.\n\n5-Visual Element\n\n7.surrealism/futurism bg\n\nUsing digital symbols to express a longing for infinite possibilities in the future, or to satirize the highly developed information society.\n\n5-Visual Element\n\n8.neon color tone\n\nThe psychedelic color palette often includes vibrant and bright colors such as magenta and purple, creating a dreamy and surreal feeling. In the 80s and 90s, neon colors, especially blues and pinks, were particularly popular, dominating the realms of fashion, advertising, film, technology, and gaming. Vaporwave, synthwave, and outrun often draw inspiration from these eras, employing these vibrant and bright color schemes.\n\nStep 1:Download the footage from the provided link, in the folder named \"Mickey_Teaching_Vapporwave.\"Step 2:Open DaVinci Resolve.Step 3:Please select the VHS video files ending in \"640\" and choose any other video clip.Step 4:Follow Me!\n\n6-Exercise\n\nLearning OutCome:Students would be able to use DaVinci Resolve to adjust a video clip into a visual scene with a vaporwave style.Specific Techniques:VHS EffectScanline EffectJPG Damage EffectDigital Glitch Effect\n\nSpecific Requirements for the Video:Duration: 1 minuteUse at least 5 clipsUtilize the 4 specified effects learned in classAdditionally, students are required to write a reflection.
