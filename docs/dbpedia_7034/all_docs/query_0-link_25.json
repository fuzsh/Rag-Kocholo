        "text": "In a society on the road to globalization through a neoliberal economic system and pervasive information networks, it seems counterintuitive to propose that an artistic movement can be critical of this situation by using visual elements such as shopping malls and the music aimed to ambient it, muzak. The Internet has not only brought more ways to keep the world interconnected, but also new artistic practices. It is in this world that vaporwave stands out, as it is a musical Internet phenomenon that is closely intertwined with a visual aesthetic. The aim of this paper is firstly to describe the aesthetics of vaporwave and to apply a media aesthetics methodology to it by analysing the re-contextualization of the music and their visual aesthetics through glitch and remix techniques of what I have called “the dystopian shopping malls”. This then becomes a convergence between music and visual representation of malls, which helps situate this type of musical expression in the field of Media Art. Under the post-digital critical framework, the second point of the essay provides a critically understanding of what kind of relations between society, cyberspaces, and networks are being produced and represented by Vaporwave, which can also be read as statements against current economic system values and lifestyle. With this in mind, I will deepen the aesthetics aspects of the genre to support my argument that vaporwave is a networked music product haunted by culture references of past representations of the future. Finally, the last segment of this article discusses how this kind of Internet-based communities and artistic expressions can be preserved and documented taking into consideration the characteristics of the movement so that it does not lose fidelity or sense, since vaporwave has many characteristics that must be understood in order to succeed in the preservation of this digital culture.
