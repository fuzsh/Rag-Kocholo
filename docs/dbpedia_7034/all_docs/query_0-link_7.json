        "text": "or “How Radical Politics got sold for Neon Lights”\n\nI. T h e A e s t h e t i c\n\nVaporwave is a known quantity at this point. More accurately, the shadow that the genre has cast is well-known. The imagery, musical approach, sensibilities, and ethos of Vaporwave have an influence that reaches far beyond the scope of the genre alone. It, along with the much more sincere Chillwave, are the genera of contemporary relaxed, down-tempo, effect-treated electronic music. Genres of music seemingly made to braid the frayed edges of millennials damaged psyches or to simply be the perfect accompaniment for studying or work. The future remains a question, and childhood is an old snapshot in sepia tones — so who am to blame the dreamy among us for immersing themselves in the smeared hues and cozy aesthetics of this style? For one, the pool of emotions it draws from is similar to proper Emo, and I love Emo. Hell, I myself took refuge in the relaxing vibes of “lo-fi hip hop” and iced coffee when I was writing my final dissertation for college. It was effective, tuneful, soothing, … aesthetic, even. Despite this, there’s an ocean of space between Vaporwave landmark Chuck Person’s Eccojams Vol. 1 and whatever lo-fi hip hop radio you may choose to frequent. What connects these things, if anything?\n\nTo this point, “The Aesthetic” is the primary quality that Vaporwave is/was/and probably will forever be sold by. But aesthetic is just a word, — everything has “an aesthetic”, but only select things have “The Aesthetic” in question. While we’re talking about it, in terms of introducing academic language into the popular lexicon, aesthetic is a word that Vaporwave did more to bring into public consciousness than almost anything else. But what is “The Aesthetic”? It’s a question you have to approach from a number of different angles to truly get a complete answer, as I see it.\n\nFrom a musical perspective — the aesthetics of Vaporwave are obvious, or at least, roughly self-apparent. The genre is built off a bedrock of sampling music from the 1980’s and 1990’s. This sampled music is generally from soft offerings of the time like smooth jazz, new age world music, adult contemporary, elevator music, early electronica, and smooth R&B. These samples are then usually modified in all sorts of ways — chopped and screwed, twisted, and treated with effects like reverb, pitch-shifting, echo, phalanger, and looping to achieve a hazy, dreamy, and sometimes disorienting final product. The musical aesthetic of Vaporwave in short, is taking corny old music from the mid 1980’s to early 1990’s and severely messing it up to create a dreamy effect. This treatment maintains much of the essential form and harmonic qualities of the original composition, but shrouds it in a layer of distance to remove any sense of immediacy or familiarity from it. And it furthermore gives these recordings a nearly trippy ambiance completely distinct from the original recordings of the songs they’re sampling.\n\nThe visual aesthetic of Vaporwave is as important, if not more important, than the musical aesthetic. It too borrows imagery from the 1980’s and 1990’s, particularly focusing on early digital 3D renders, epochal corporate aesthetics, quasi-futurist visuals, and cyberpunk. Cyberpunk, believe me, is its own can of worms that I’ll address a little bit later . These visuals are often treated with compression artifacting, blurring effects, and filters to reach a similar emotional end as the music — to leave it shrouded, distant, and dreamlike. In some cases, particularly in the case of the aforementioned early 3D renders, the visuals are left untreated because they are already so surreal and bizarre that the dreamlike quality need not be achieved through modification.\n\nThrough this cursory, and not at all exhaustive examination on the basic aesthetics of Vaporwave, we can begin to see the common tendnencies & themes that run through the genre. Namely that the preoccupations of the genre are rooted firmly in the past. Most specifically of the time in 1st world civilization where computer technologies began to integrate themselves into the daily lives of people. This time spanning mostly from computers near-exclusive utilization within corporate or business settings, to the creation of early home computers in the 1980’s to the 1990’s, to the point when home computers evolved from a novelty niche interest to a veritable consumer product for the masses. To say Vaporwave is focused on the past is a truism, but to say that it’s focused on the past of when the computer came into popular usage begins to make a lot more sense of the whole genre. Why corporate aesthetics? They were among the earliest adopters of computer technology to ameliorate the problems of logistics at the office. Why old-school quasi-futurism? They were emblems of the era of early computers that suggested futures that were possible with this technology in tow. Why early computer art and visuals? Do I even have to explain?\n\nBut it’s not enough to simply regard Vaporwave as “suggesting the past” — to understand it, it should be understood that it is expressly nostalgic as well. And to that another eye-rolling “of course”. But this fixation is something that is bolstered by the musical and visual aesthetic of the genre as well. Everything is dreamy and shrouded and even ghostly sometimes — suggesting not just a memory of the past but an active, working recollection of it. These are visuals that themselves suggest nostalgia without the necessary precondition of having experienced it. This is all to say that the visuals & music of Vaporwave feel like memories even upon first experience of them. This is why you can find a good deal of sehnsucht among vaporwave and adjacent circles — pining comments to the tune of evoking nostalgia for a time or experience an individual never actually lived. They may not have themselves experienced the origin of the aesthetics being evoked, but they remain evocative unto themselves. That’s the key.\n\nThe Aesthetic in short is to create a lens in the present to recall the past through a dreamlike shroud. This is, in my opinion, the common ground of lo-fi hip hop, New Dreams LTD., and muted, specifically contextualized remixes of pop songs from the 2000’s.[1] However, don’t be misled into thinking that Vaporwave is merely an engine for nostalgic rumination. As I see it, that’s a budget interpretation that people have settled on now for simplicity’s sake. And perhaps its even one that even has its own merits, but there’s an important aspect to uphold about Vaporwave that people more & more overlook. This grows ever more true as the sad-eyed, wistful strains of The Aesthetic bleeds into the larger culture in the decade since its inception. That aspect, of course, being the genre’s anti-capitalist tendencies.\n\nII. Colonialism and Fetishization\n\nLet’s talk for a minute about New Age music. I brought up New Age-styled music as one of the plundered genres that make up the tapestry of Vaporwave. It is/was a genre that often evokes the narrative of peace being achieved by a “return to innocence”. This idea is often expressed through the appropriation of indigenous people’s music. In this way, New Age music is a manifestation of bourgeois liberalism where the Other is able to be fetishized as a distant “innocent” whose culture can be consumed and understood within the framework of appropriated and recontextualized music. New Age music was music generally made by and packaged for well-to-do liberals. People possibly of the business class, who despite their wealth, still suffer much of the alienation that is intrinsic to capitalism. At the same time, despite this feeling of alienation, they have still been given wealth and privilege and success by the system. This means that they’re not so eager to question the Invisible Hand that has always fed them, so they go seeking out another narrative:\n\n“Modern life is difficult. It’s full of rigor and stress and a lingering hollowness, but it’s just a function of our increasing technologically integrated world. There’s a beauty in the simplicity of less advanced people, who can enjoy their lives free of the stress of the hyper-modernized world.”\n\nThis narrative seems appealing but is nonetheless sophistry. It presupposes the ease of indigenous peoples lives despite all contemporary evidence to the contrary. They contend with the issues of colonialism, historical slave trade, environmental degradation, infractions of state governments upon their lived-in land, and the forward march of surrounding civilization cutting off their ability to live the life they had lived, possibly for hundreds and hundreds of years. Furthermore, it perpetuates the narrative of the noble savage — a racist archetype that is the very essence of a “backhanded compliment” but directed towards an entire group of people with history and culture that are often ignored or destroyed. And furthermore an archetype that was specifically invented to downplay the significance of Indigenous intellectual traditions amongst Europeans. Indigenous “primitivism” is fetishized on a purely hypothetical level, while the work of modern liberal & business-class elites in the first world is the very thing that undermines the ability of these people to actually exist. This is the fundamental contradiction of New Age music. Well, that, and the utter disrespect they show to the rights of the performers of the indigenous music that gets sampled and recontextualized in the genre.\n\nNew Age music shares temporal space with the growth of computer technologies, and their utilization within large businesses. This are two occurrences that initially appear as unrelated coincidences. Correlation not implying causation and all of that. But as I see it, this simultaneous growth reads as a sensible liberal response to the alienation from labor that occurs with a jump of mechanization. To be essentially comfortable in the material state of your life, but to feel ever so slightly put off but how computers have begun to inch their way in to your specialized place of employment. In this case, however, instead of placing onus on the owners of capital looking to maximize profit through automation, New Age depends on people couching this ennui in the technological growth itself. This is a thought-process that is much more tangible to a regular petite-bourgeois than finding some fundamental flaw in the economic system they are primary benefactors of.\n\nThough it’s hard to pin a definitive philosophy to primarily instrumental plunderphonic music made by a wide spread of different producers with presumably different philosophies and outlooks, I like to think that there’s a deep running vein in Vaporwave that satirizes this dichotomy. Take Internet Club’s album Redefining The Workplace example — as clear cut a piece corporate satire as is possible from the Vaporwave camp. And more generally than that, the juxtaposition of nostalgic recollection, retro-futurism, and the technophobic liberalism of New Age makes for a total mess of aesthetics and philosophical positions that undercuts some of the fundamental issues of trying to develop a “philosophy” to respond to and make sense of the irrationality and alienation of Late Capitalism. Furthermore, just as New Age music operates off of recontextual appropriation, Vaporwave does as well. However, in the latter case, the power dynamics are entirely flipped, and the result is a copy of a copy, a photo negative of the original expression.\n\nNow, while we’re on the subject of colonialism, there’s another elephant in the room I’ve yet to properly address with regards to this genre — Japan. Neon-colored Japanese cityscapes, Japanese language characters, and representations of old-school anime are all very common, and why? In short, Japan in the 1980’s and 1990’s, and even into the 21st century, was the ultimate representation of technology’s ability to improve civilization. They were the emblem of the future’s promise.\n\nJapan — historically isolated and heavily militarized into the 20th century, was decimated by WWII to a level that probably even Germany could barely match. But in the decades following the war, after a (partially coerced) reformation of society, and a pivot towards a western Capitalist system, the western observer would not be wrong to think that the country was fast on the track to being one of the leading tech development superpowers. In following the path of the free market, they were able to develop marketable technologies at a prodigious rate. Cars, VCRs, CDs, and video game consoles, among many other products, all came from Japan. Furthermore, the West’s amicable relationship with them post 1950’s as a definitively capitalist state within the tumultuous East Asian region made them narratively and economically appealing. They were in some respects the barometer of progress and technology in the latter half of the 20th century. It’s not for nothing that the skyline of Tokyo around this time almost began to look something like “futuristic” during the 1980’s.\n\nJapan was the 1980’s symbol of the future that technology could bring us to. Which, if you’ve been paying attention, sounds in wordage suspiciously similar to something like retro-futurism. The utilization of Japanese characters, imagery, and aesthetics is an evocation of Japanese tech fetishism around the time their technological base was growing more and more powerful. East Asia, and Japan most particularly around this time became the centering idea behind the techno-futurism of latter part of the 20th century. Because the future was defined by the mystifying other-ness of Asian technology, there was a valorizing of them as the pavers of roads into the future that the West proper could enjoy. This representation of Japan binds together ideas of retro-futurism, colonialism, and the fetishizing of the Other. It contrasts perfectly the valorizing of technology and the unerring growth of capitalism through computer technology and the New Age desire for “simplicity and primitivism”.\n\nThere’s clearly a lot of uncritical utilizing of Japanese imagery and retro technology in service of The Aesthetic in Vaporwave, but I think that there’s also a strain of poking holes in the narrative that Japan represented to the west at the time. A persistent tendency of undercutting the image of Japan as the paragon of development, capitalism, and computer technology at it’s very best and most effective. In juxtaposing this image of “Japan as the future” from the past of the 80’s, there’s an implicit reference to the imperfection and disappointment that technology has worked out to in the present. Virtual reality, digital social connectivity, cyberspace societies,artificial intelligence, video games, even the internet — all of these things, now existent in some way or another, have worked out to be let-downs from the high promises they made in the past. Technology and computers didn’t fix our lives, or our civilization, and even exacerbated certain existing problems in it. As a result, the techno-utopianism of the past feel naïve at this point. And this brings me to my next point.\n\nIII. Anti-Capitalism and Utopianism\n\nVaporwave evokes a sort of nostalgia-futurism, wherein the future as was understood in the past can be examined. However, this sort of nostalgia-futurist utopianism is contingent on the non-existence of capitalist forces whose motives are profit driven. The starry-eyed nostalgia the genre seems to possess positions the developments of technology as wonderful and imagination-spurning, but also implies the dark reality of the matter. We currently live in the timely future of technology predicted in the time Vaporwave’s aesthetic and thematic framework emerges from, but we don’t live in the world therein described or predicted. That’s a source of disappointment and ennui.\n\nEarlier, when talking about the circumstances surrounding New Age music, I touched on the question of the answers people give to explain the disappointments in their life, both culturally and personally. The range of answers that people give can often make a lot of sense of their worldview. Is the great technology we were promised not realizing its fullest potential because of individuals? Immigrants? Bad leadership? Lack of growth? Well, to cut speculation short, it’s capital. At least most of it. What’s the thing that makes marketable toy or a 10th version of the same damn smart phone more valuable to make for a company than genuine technological breakthrough? It’s not immigrants, I’ll tell you that much. Human invention is in the backseat, and while it sometimes gives directions, the driver calls the shots.\n\nThere’s something perverse, almost dystopian about this couching of technological development in the profit motive. It’s as if this, the time we live in now, was never the dream of future that was ever presented to the imaginations of the past. When we see the imagination-inciting retro wire frame shell of an environment, we may first imagine the potential this must have represented to people in the past. What we don’t consider is this technology having to be at the beck of capital, but alas, it, like everything, is. Henceforth, all potential is grounded by the immovable edicts of the same economic model we’ve been bounds to for hundreds of years. In the face of a stagnant reality and of politics scarcely different than those of the Reagan-era, it was the only thing that materially makes sense to happen. This is perspective that Vaporwave seems to give voice to in its presentation & outlook. In their piece, “Attention Online Shoppers”, writer Scott Beauchamp describes the music and emotional impact of Vaporwave as such:\n\n“Vaporwave’s dreamy assemblages of smooth jazz, elevator music, lounge, and R&B, all distended and chopped and looped, have the eerily ethereal texture of a dream. It’s what the subconscious of a mall might sound like. It’s the soundtrack to a hypnagogic reverie of a future that never happened.”[2]\n\nFurthermore, he says of Macintosh Plus’ Floral Shoppe that:\n\n“…it might sound like it’s broadcasting the coordinates to the exact location where 20th-century utopian aspirations collapse into a burned-out nostalgia.”\n\nBeauchamp sees Vaporwave as fixated on societal failure, and in my opinion, the genre’s fixation on failure and the past are deeply intertwined. The “memory” evoked by Vaporwave is, in a way, a memory of Techno-utopianism. Where the excesses of technology and capital are tempered by the growth of people’s wisdom about the role of technology in life. That, or the technology itself would pave the way to a more perfect future. It is grounded in the idea that computer technology could be the building blocks to the architecture of a new, highly interconnected, and more utopian world. A world where we could begin to be unfettered by boundaries and geography. Speaking literally, this turned out to be true, as the internet connects people across the entire planet, infrastructural, technological, and economic restrictions on internet access aside. Unfortunately, it has done predictably nothing to amend the people or the societies utilizing this technology.\n\nWhat it boils down to is that the forces of international neoliberal capitalism made the development of technology exclusively towards the end of human well-being nearly impossible. Of course, improvements to life are made through technology, don’t mistake me, you only have to look at the medicinal developments of of the last 150 years to confirm that. However, the utopian concept of technology serving the good of humanity is undercut by the reality that the corporations that develop and distribute this technology are necessarily motivated by profit. A fact that is severely limiting in terms of the growth of technology towards an expressly moral end. It all makes sense when you consider the tendencies of capitalism in the past. There was an amazing telecommunication technology we came into with Television and Radio, but they got hijacked and brought to heel by marketing and advertising. This is not to pin the evils of the world on marketing alone, but rather to illustrate it as a symptom of money being the primary motivating force under capitalism, and not innovation or invention.\n\nThere are conceptual similarities here to the aforementioned Cyberpunk. Cyberpunk was the 1980’s counterpoint to tech-optimism — the natural inverse of its sunny vision of technology’s future. To sum up a complex genre in a few, inadequate words, it made the point to suggest that social ills (wealth inequality, oppression, social decay, alienation, etc.) would not be mended by technological advancement but would rather exacerbate these issues. Much as I expounded upon in the previous paragraph.\n\nCyberpunk was also extremely Japan-centric. Not necessarily by Japanese writers but by western writers writing about Japan. Yeah… I mean, I mentioned earlier this was a can of worms, right? A whole world of discussion about the Othering of Japanese technology and culture exists in here, but it’s too complex and tangential of an issue to dive into here. Aside from the aspect of “western-gaze” present here, there’s also the anti-utopian angle. If we wanna talk about a “reverie to a future that never happened” there’s definitely a place for Cyberpunk within that framework. It is the dark, shimmery, bleak iteration of a “future-from-the-past” that suggests human societal problems are not easily amendable in contrast to the dream of Tech Utopianism.\n\nCyberpunk also looks somewhat Aesthetic, or perhaps more accurately, Vaporwave borrows aesthetics from Cyberpunk’s legacy as another angle to Retro-Futurism from the time.\n\nSuggesting a disquieting ambivalence to the hauntological shape of these “lost futures”, whether they be utopian or dystopian. As such, it can be hard to tell, even in a case-by-case basis, if Vaporwave is sincerely evoking the past’s tech-optimism as a fond, if naïve, remnant of a bygone age, sarcastically chiding this naivety, or describing this version of the future as “lost” due to some element of social or economic failure. As Adam Harper writes in his examination of the politics of Vaporwave:\n\n“These musicians can be read as sarcastic anti-capitalists revealing the lies and slippages of modern techno-culture and its representations, or as its willing facilitators, shivering with delight upon each new wave of delicious sound.”[3]\n\nTo the point of this idea of “Lost Futures”, we just should also note Vaporwave’s linguistic similarity to “Vaporware” — a tech project that after being announced to the public, never comes into being. As Harper’s piece writes about this: “Such is the deferred and even tragic promise of fulfillment in Vaporwave.”\n\nOn a tangentially related note, the time that Vaporwave examines, was a time of advertising beginning to truly approach “art” status. I use the phrase art loosely, and it has the ability incite massive discourse unto itself, but the leaking of pop art in the marketing sphere created themes, visual, and hooks that were memorable, striking, and immediate. Color, sound, fury, bombast, pathos, and rhetoric all became more commonplace in advertising. Considering Vaporwave pulls from seemingly all of the dulled, knotty edges of popular culture from this time, it’s only natural that advertising be included in that pool of influence. It’s painting with a bit too broad a brush to imply that it’s all used to the end of biting satire, but there are cases of it. For a strong example of said satire, I like to look towards the video for Saint Pepsi’s Enjoy Yourself. The music is an optimistic, dreamy declaration of personal freedom about liberating oneself from the drudgery of the “nine to five”. On the face of it, this is nothing strange given western pop music’s individualist tendencies. But the video does a lot to complicate the seemingly simple messaging of the song. The video is quite unlike any standard music video, as instead of showcasing the musical artist or some kind of novel, eye-catching, visual trickery, it’s just a chopped up and fuzzy old recording of a late 1980’s McDonald’s advertisement featuring the moon-faced lounge singer, Mac Tonight.\n\nThe video is not only that perfect level of fuzzy, unearthly surrealness to work as a Vaporwave visual accompaniment practically on its own merits, it’s also thematically just sardonic enough to merit attention. It positions the liberation posited in the song, where, “…there are no rules it’s up to you” within the context of a goddamn fast food commercial.[4] I think this is sarcastically commenting on bourgeois conception of personal liberation within an entirely consumerist lens.\n\nTo tie this back to my earlier point, I think this is also about blurring the edges between art & marketing. The Mac Tonight advertisement is both a banal piece of advertising telling you to buy some McDonalds, but it’s also a visually interesting, striking, and unique artistic vision. The image of moon-faced lounge singer playing piano on top of a giant cheeseburger over a city skyline is something that I could see appearing in a museum, given a different context. These two functions — of art & of advertising — brush up uncomfortably against each other. You see, when marketing stands-in for art, it holds the potential to stand-in for all the things art is meant to express — liberation, emotional release, catharsis, humor, personal resonance, etc. It’s usually not a success in that way, as its hard to scrub people’s awareness that they’re being sold something, but there’s no question that the act of marketing coming asymptotically closer and closer to the edge of art suggests that it’s a motivation for marketers to at least reach for it. Even the name “Saint Pepsi” suggests the elevation of a brand to the status of divinity. Now that’s what I call some satirical shit… probably.\n\nIt’s not for nothing that Vaporwave is often seen as corporate and marketing culture through a lens one part nostalgic and recollective, and one part sarcastic and derisive. There’s an element of kitsch here for sure, but there’s something that’s obviously weird about kitsch being harvested from the profit-motivated world of marketing. This is primarily because, though the contents of marketing have changed, the motivation of it has stayed the same. This reflects Vaporwave’s preoccupation with some of the fundamental immutabilities of a capitalist economy. Just as we are bound by profit motive, we are bound by marketing too. The recording artist behind Vaporwave project INTERNET CLUB, Robin Burnett, commented on this point and their motivations for making music by stating:\n\n“…capitalistic society has generated a dehumanizing hyperreality by focusing on infinite generation of ideals as shown through commodities… (the editing of the music is meant to achieve) a defamiliarisation (sic.) of things we’ve become so use to that we don’t notice them anymore.”[5]\n\nIf it ever seems that the umbrella of aesthetic and philosophical stances taken in Vaporwave (and its sister genre of Hypnagogic Pop) is a somewhat inscrutable hodge podge, well, part of that can be chalked up to individual artistic initiative, but I feel a part should also be attributed to this “infinite generation of ideals”. When the solid ground of philosophical standpoint is eroded away to neoliberal consumerism, this “infinite generation of ideals” is necessary to keep people motivated towards an ever-shifting goal. Whether it be New Age philosophy, marketing, business logistics, workplace fulfillment, or commodity fetishization, the modern world necessitates people be motivated by something immediately desirable, but ultimately unreachable. Vaporwave seems to be focused on the absurdity of these modes of consumption/advertising/corporate culture as capable of producing any sort of “art”, specifically because they are primarily oriented to serve a marketing function. In reconfiguring these modes of cultural communication to become purely aesthetic and artistic and entirely non-market focused, the oddity of the entire culture comes into light. Like the isolation of Mac Tonight into a context where he can no longer sell burgers. The isolation of the seperate aesthetic and ideological elements of popular culture renders them nearly absurd. Something did go a bit wrong in attempting this, however…\n\nIV. The Sell-Out\n\nIt’s not for nothing that Vaporwave is scarcely understood. In these 4000+ words I feel like I’m still grasping at straws sometimes. There’s just so much to unpack here politically and philosophically, and it’s kinda tiring. But in the end, for the musicians themselves it’s probably easier to take some oddball lounge music from the 1980’s and layer some effects on it and call it a day. The inscrutability of the genre’s philosophical stance left it a beguiling oddity to most people. In this respect, Vaporwave as anti-capitalist project was doomed to fail, but it failed uniquely, as well — it failed through selling out.\n\nIt’s impossible to deny the dreamy, nostalgic, perhaps slightly melancholic feeling of Vaporwave made a splash bigger than the more disquieting anti-capitalist sentiment that ran through it. Reverb, pitch-shifting, and dreamy soundscapes are now synonymous with A E S T H E T I C S. The always-present “Lo-fi hip-hop” channels on YouTube borrow the 90’s anime aesthetics and down-tempo music if almost nothing else from the genre. Washed out pastel pinks, purple, and blues in retro stylizations are forever tied to what Vaporwave was. YouTube videos even promote different sorts of “-wave” micro-microgenres who tend to focus on other nostalgic niches such as “Zeldawave” and “Simpsonswave”. Don’t mistake me, I may be a stick in the mud, but I don’t necessarily hate this in and of itself. If we’re talking from a standpoint of pure aesthetics and moody nostalgia, maybe there’s a reason Simpsonswave exists, hell, I’ll admit ＳＵＮＤＡＹ ＳＣＨＯＯＬ is an effective and evocative video. But the thing is, I think we can see that Vaporwave probably shouldn’t be taken in a vacuum. To be uncritical of the place “The Aesthetic” comes from is to be ignorant of the critique that seems to be happening in the genre.\n\nIn fact, I think it’s not unfounded to say that the very idea of a nostalgia rooted in some kind of consumer identity (say, in being a fan of the Legend of Zelda series), seems to be directly in contradiction to point of the genre. The pastiches and send-ups of new age, corporate, and marketing aesthetics seem to ridicule the idea that nostalgia experienced vis á vis these sources is a true outgrowth of authentic human experience. It’s a ghost of an experience manufactured in the service of capitalism. This feels to me like a huge point of the genre that seems to be overlooked now because, as musician Aaron David Ross said:\n\n“It initiates a lot of important conversations about power and money in the industry. Or… everything just sounds good slowed down with reverb?”[6]\n\nBased on contemporary perceptions of the genre, I’d say the latter of those two points stood up as representative of the genre. One need only look at the odd case of corporate brands utilizing Vapor-esque aesthetics to see the mess that’s been made of all of this. Jordan Pearson of Vice writes of a time in 2015 when Tumblr and MTV both simultaneously adopted Vaporwave’s visual trappings, roughly 5 years following the genre’s genesis:\n\n“(they have) erased the cynical distance inherent in the digitally-bred aesthetics they champion.”[7]\n\nThe anti-corporate aesthetic goes corporate, and really, how couldn’t it? It was just so damn cool and colorful looking! And that kitschy “old-technology” thing? To die for! And that Nostalgia! Ugh~~~\n\nNow, to not get things twisted, I don’t think the cultural runoff from Vaporwave is 100% a problem, hell I like some of it. And I don’t think there’s anything wrong with feeling a bit misty about manufactured experiences like popular video games — I mean, damn, I spend plenty of time doing that shit. But to discard the critiques and questions of capitalism that this genre raises is to discard a meaningful part of what the genre is in favor of a fixation on pure aesthetics. And the fixation on pure aesthetics in the absence of an ideological groundwork? It’s troubling, and I can’t help but be reminded by the gradual and repeated combing of 90’s punk till it was just a hollow facsimile of itself by the end of the decade. Vaporwave was never as immediate or in-your-face with its political sentiments, which made it intriguing, mysterious, and difficult to parse in a way that punk never was, but it also made it easily exploitable to marketers and aesthetes who saw the sentimental hues of its color palette but never saw past that veneer.\n\nPerhaps the genre’s philosophical inscrutability is to blame, or perhaps pop cultural nostalgia was simply too deep of a well to mine for Vaporwave to go untapped in the popular consciousness. Perhaps Vaporwave’s criticism of nostalgia through replication was done too well, and fed directly into what critic Simon Reynolds called pop culture’s “addiction to its own past”.[8] Either way, the slap to the face of all of this is that Vaporwave itself has become dated — a specter hanging around the edges of our culture cropping up where we would not expect it and ironically, creating a new level of appetite for the past. And maybe it’s not wrong to have an appetite for the past, but it’s important to remain cognizant of the lens we’re using to view that past, lest it all just become another consumer identity — which would be the saddest insult to the genre you could ever muster.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://brooklynrail.org/2017/04/music/Attention-Online-Shoppers\n\nhttps://genius.com/13990627\n\nhttp://www.dummymag.com/features/adam-harper-vaporwave\n\nhttp://www.thefader.com/2015/10/08/timeline-history-of-music-microgenres-chillwave-cloud-rap-witch-house\n\nhttps://www.vice.com/en_us/article/539v9a/tumblr-and-mtv-killed-vaporwave\n\nReynolds, Simon, Retromania: Pop Culture’s Addiction to Its Own Past.\n\nNot explicitly sources but directly inspired this essay anyway\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCRcfYRslg — Neoliberalism, World Music and Corporate Aesthetics by Cuck Philosophy\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSvUqhZcbVg — Hauntology, Lost Futures and 80s Nostalgia by Cuck Philosophy\n\n[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzSQ7ErTyoA\n\n[2] https://brooklynrail.org/2017/04/music/Attention-Online-Shoppers\n\n[3] https://www.dummymag.com/news/adam-harper-vaporwave/\n\n[4] https://genius.com/Saint-pepsi-enjoy-yourself-lyrics\n\n[5] https://www.dummymag.com/news/adam-harper-vaporwave/\n\n[6] https://www.thefader.com/2015/10/08/timeline-history-of-music-microgenres-chillwave-cloud-rap-witch-house\n\n[7] https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/539v9a/tumblr-and-mtv-killed-vaporwave"
