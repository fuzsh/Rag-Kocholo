        "text": "It’s hard to explain the Vaporwave aesthetic in the same way that it’s hard to describe the taste of water. It’s such a bizarre Frankenstein’s monster of misaligned parts– liminal spaces, technicolor dreamscapes, and off-beat anime references come together in a cacophony of visuals, set to a smooth, synth soundtrack.\n\nA couple of years ago, I wrote a full breakdown on Vaporwave as a concept, so I’m going to plagiarize myself a bit here:\n\nMeant to be an ironic take on the Chillwave movement, Vaporwave attempts to take current pop culture and make it retro before its time. It’s ghostly, unsettling, and flecked with Pepto Bismol pink and other pastels that should be pleasant to look at but just aren’t.\n\nThe anonymity of online communities allowed Vaporwave artists to reveal themselves in one fell swoop. You either liked it or didn’t. There was no marketing, no hype, nothing other than a shared post on Reddit or 4chan that quickly grew in its reach until a small following of nostalgia-hungry weird kids cultivated the electropop subgenre into a socially acceptable mish-mash of sound, style, and political critique.\n\nThe first instances of Vaporwave as a music genre came in 2011, with pioneers like James Ferraro and Ramona Xavier leading the charge. Xavier’s Floral Shoppe is often noted as the seminal album for the genre, sparking inspiration in other artists across platforms like Bandcamp, Turntable.Fm, and Soundcloud to try their hand at bastardizing muzak by sprinkling in chopped and screwed samples of classic digital noises.\n\nThink elevator music + the sound of AOL dial-up + Chilledcow’s lofi hip hop radio – beats to relax/study to all mixed into one.\n\nIf you’re confused, don’t worry. That’s kind of the point.\n\nIt’s purposeful in its vagueness and takes great pride in being ungraspable. Both traits have served it well in keeping it (mostly) out of the hands of commercialization because unless you “get it,” you just don’t really get it.\n\nVaporwave Aesthetic Design Motifs and Themes\n\n80s and 90s nostalgia, particularly older technology (cassettes, CDs, Gameboy Advance, CRT TVs) and retro, 8-bit pixel graphics\n\nLiminal spaces, like abandoned shopping malls, school hallways after dark, or cities devoid of humans\n\nEffortless irony; looking down on those who “try too hard” to be ironic\n\nJapanese typographical characters\n\nLo-fi photography and “glitchy” overlays\n\nMarble busts\n\nHypersaturated palm trees and sunsets\n\nNeon lights\n\nOlder animes, like Sailor Moon and Akira\n\nSimplified computer windows, often displaying cynical quotes\n\nWindows95\n\nRejection of consumerism is expressed by placing branded objects (often drink cans or tech companies) in strange places where they don’t belong\n\nGeometric lines and grids\n\nRomanticizing pessimism, sadness, and addiction by making it look more visually appealing through the use of Vaporwave aesthetic colors and visuals\n\nDisconnection from others and the world at large; visualizing spaces devoid of human contact\n\nCreating a sonic ambiance that sounds pleasant but is strange or slightly “off” with careful listening\n\nSarcasm and patronizing speech, particularly towards those who want to dissect or elevate Vaporwave in an effort to present it as something deeper than it actually is\n\nFavoring aesthetic over meaning, feeling, or thought\n\nVaporwave Fashion\n\nIn most cases, Vaporwave fashion is simply pieces of clothing featuring visuals associated with the aesthetic.\n\nCasual clothing, including sweatpants, joggers, sneakers, ankle-height socks, hats, hoodies, and t-shirts\n\nRetro-style graphics blown up to cover an entire piece of clothing\n\nCensor bars\n\nEnglish words with matching Japanese characters\n\nMetallic and neon color palettes\n\nMacintosh and Windows computers\n\nGrainy filters\n\nCartoon characters with pessimistic quotes\n\nDolphins and Lisa Frank-esque animals\n\nGeometric shapes in teal, pink, purple, and yellow\n\nBomber jackets\n\nThe “Jazz” design from disposable Dixie cups\n\n80s and 90s “bus seat” patterns\n\nVaporwave Aesthetic Influential Media\n\nVideo Games\n\nBroken Reality\n\n“A humorous adventure set in a 3D parody of the internet. Diverse puzzles, beautiful worlds, friends, experiences, upgrades and more, await those who ‘log on’!”\n\nEcco the Dolphin\n\n“Life was an adventure for Ecco, the young dolphin. The ocean seemed endless, with rolling breakers to race through! At high-speed, Ecco could burst through the waves leaping through the air – almost flying! Until one day, all of that changed. A freak whirlpool of air and water tore the life from Ecco’s home, leaving Ecco all alone. Now he must fight to stay alive while traversing the vast ocean in search of clues that will help him save his family and return them to the bay.”\n\nCyberpunk 2077\n\n“Cyberpunk 2077 is an open-world, action-adventure RPG set in the dark future of Night City — a dangerous megalopolis obsessed with power, glamor, and ceaseless body modification.”\n\nData Wing\n\n“Blast through a stylish, neon landscape in this story-driven, racing adventure. DATA WINGs deliver critical data throughout the computer system, following Mother’s orders without question. But when the system comes under attack, and Mother becomes irrational, something must be done!”\n\nParty Hard\n\n“It’s 3:00 a.m. Your neighbours are having a loud party. Stop them. Party Hard is tinyBuild’s award-winning stealth strategy game about ruining parties by any means.”\n\nMall Quest\n\n“Malls are technically places where you can go and have a good time, given the fact that you can find restaurants, pubs and a variety of shops there. However, they can also be quite stressful and annoying if you are not in the mood for it. Unfortunately, you sometimes have to bear with it and just go find what you need.”\n\nIslands: Non-Places\n\n“The familiar becomes magical in this critically acclaimed interactive artscape. Explore ten scenes inspired by the everyday and let your expectations of reality be transformed. ”\n\nOnline Series and Shows\n\nSkyCorp Home Video (Online Series)\n\n“A satirical media corporation that delivers various assorted comedic (and sometimes disturbing) sketches (alongside various vulgar production logos) in a decayed VHS style evocative of the late 80s and early 90s.”\n\nRetail Archaeology (Online Series)\n\n“Retail Archaeology explores dead malls, retail history, and retro games & toys.”\n\nDead Mall Series (Online Series)\n\n“Informative tours of some of the most depressed shopping malls in the mid-Atlantic region and beyond.”\n\nTim & Eric’s Awesome Show, Great Job!\n\n“Two comedians, average nobodies, and celebrity guest stars perform bizarre low-budget comedy sketches.”\n\nSpace Dandy\n\n“The cosmic and comic adventures of Space Dandy, a handsome space explorer tasked to tour the universe and discover new alien beings.”\n\nDream Corp LLC\n\n“An absurd workplace comedy set in a neglected dream therapy facility where a rotating cast of desperate patients have their dreams recorded and analyzed by Dream Corp’s absent-minded professor.”\n\nTwin Peaks\n\n“An idiosyncratic FBI agent investigates the murder of a young woman in the even more idiosyncratic town of Twin Peaks.”\n\nMovies\n\nComputers Are People Too\n\n“This movie explores the possibilities of interaction between man and computer, with some historical background. It demonstrates techniques introduced in the Walt Disney movie _Tron (1982)_, combining computer-synthesized animation and real-life object photography.”\n\nBlade Runner 2049\n\n“Young Blade Runner K’s discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track down former Blade Runner Rick Deckard, who’s been missing for thirty years.”\n\nMax Headroom\n\n“In the near future, an intrepid investigative TV reporter does his job with the help of his colleagues and a computerized version of himself.”\n\nChungking Express\n\n“Two melancholy Hong Kong policemen fall in love: one with a mysterious female underworld figure, the other with a beautiful and ethereal waitress at a late-night restaurant he frequents.”\n\nAkira\n\n“A secret military project endangers Neo-Tokyo when it turns a biker gang member into a rampaging psychic psychopath who can only be stopped by a teenager, his gang of biker friends, and a group of psychics.”\n\nVaporwave Aesthetic Resources and References\n\nInternet Personalities and Social Media\n\nUtopia District YouTube Channel\n\nVapor Memory YouTube Channel\n\nSound Station YouTube Channel\n\ntropicalvirtual_ Instagram\n\nvaporwave_aesthetic Instagram\n\nvaporwaveplug Instagram\n\nvaporwave_fashion Instagram\n\nSpotify Playlists\n\nSubreddits and Tumblr Blogs\n\nr/VaporwaveAesthetics\n\nr/Vaporwave\n\nr/VaporwaveArt\n\nVaporwave World\n\nWarakami-Vaporwave\n\nMysteries of Vaporwave 2\n\nPinterest Boards\n\nV A P O R W A V E by Dustin Martin\n\nVaporwave/Retrowave by BigFloof69\n\nThe Vaporwave Effect by Justin Bienvenue and Daniella Lopez\n\nPodcasts"
