        "text": "The term vaporwave was apparently coined in 2011 by music producer Will Burnett, who used it to describe a style emerging among artists like Vektroid, whose July 2011 album New Dreams Ltd. was an early influence on the sub-genre.\n\nThe vapor in vaporwave suggests the music’s foggy, ethereal, and ever-shifting sound and may also allude to vaporware, which describes software that is promised but never delivered. The wave, meanwhile, is modelled on electronic genres like chillwave and new wave before it.\n\nVektroid’s December 2011 album, Floral Shoppe, was considered by some to be the first vaporwave. The term, and the subgenre, rose to greater prominence in 2012, used to tag other albums and songs that sounded like “Floral Shoppe.”\n\nSome interpret vaporwave as a countercultural critique of global capitalism, consumerism, and escapism. It is characterized by the use of samples, particularly of mass-produced music like Muzak, distorted by chopping-and-screwing or by endless looping of a small piece, creating a surreal effect.\n\nThere’s also a distinct visual to the vaporwave style, consisting of a distorted, retro-futurism. Checkerboard patterns, pastel color palettes, and retro video game images are common. This is often called the vaporwave aesthetic."
