        "text": "“Music is one of the best art forms to follow if you want to track cultural shifts. How telling is it that the biggest musical right now is a retelling of the American Revolution set to hip-hop?\n\nOne of the largest cultural influencers of the past two decades has been the internet. While techno music has reflected machinery’s impact on society since the 1980s, the internet is a different beast with unique artistic needs. If you’re in the mood for music for today’s meme-filled online world, throw yourself to the currents of “vaporwave.”\n\n... What is vaporwave? Just mention it on one of the chiller parts of the internet and you’ll soon learn the answer. But here’s a rundown if you don’t have time. Vaporwave is an electronic music microgenre from the early 2010s. Its stylistic influences include chillwave, smooth jazz, chopped and screwed, new-age, and pop. To explain it in words kind of ruins the point. Vaporwave is the muzak that plays in an elevator in a mall in a futuristic Japanese cyberpunk dystopia. It’s the music sedated freaks listen to on the neo-dance floor. It’s the jams your funky smartphone mediates to when it’s running low on power and is cool with it. It’s a word that can’t be shouted, only coolly whispered. Vaporwave isn’t vaporware, it’s real.\n\nVaporwave isn’t just something you listen to either, it’s something you experience, and experiences include visuals. Vaporwave visual art, simply referred to as “aesthetics,” is varied but tends to honor some core tenets. If you’re looking at something pink and teal with a marble classical bust and a glitchy Windows 95 logo, you’re probably looking at a vaporwave aesthetic. If you’re watching a YouTube video with a title written in a weirdly soothing stretched out font, you’re probably watching a vaporwave aesthetic.”"
