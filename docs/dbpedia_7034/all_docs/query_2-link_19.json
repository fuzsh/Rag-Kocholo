        "text": "Vaporwave started to blossom around the early 2010s; and like all new things that are difficult to describe, some people’s explanations of what the Vaporwave phenomenon was were indeed a bit dismissive. Internet users were quick to proclaim that “Vaporwave is Dead” or that Vaporwave is “just a meme” yet these classifications failed to give the stylized genre a place in the history of important and meaningful art movements of modern history. If examined properly, Vaporwave can actually enhance our lives.\n\nWhen Vaporwave is dismissed as a “meme”, it fails to fully encompass what Vaporwave is and more importantly, fails to acknowledge the potential Vaporwave has to be.\n\n“Memes” and the subculture of Vaporwave do have a significant relation, but generally, it is better to acknowledge Vaporwave as a lifestyle approach or design philosophy, at the very least.\n\nIf newcomers to Vaporwave simply understand it as a meme then it tends to solely become a utility for sharing information. Without an ethos and intent to contextualize this genre within the other great movements of history, Vaporwave risks being dismissed as a joke by those who are not equipped to immediately understand its design language.\n\nThough Vaporwave is relatively new, it isn’t a trending meme. Vaporwave is an acknowledgment and revelation of the postmodern era as it promotes a slow and thoughtful reflection on modernism that can be experienced in isolation. As a result, its popularity can be enhanced even in an era of social distancing. Additionally, the genre is strengthened by its ability to trigger reflection in the viewer, since the many pop-culture graphics it references help creating a feeling of nostalgia that jogs our collective memories and reignites our telepathic abilities.\n\nWhile there are many subgenres and styles of Vaporwave, there is a common emphasis on life in a city or metropolis, industry, as well as an emphasis on reverbed and slowed soundscapes that reinforce the following notions:\n\n1) Slowness in the city is to be desired (if not necessary).\n\n2) The desire for slowness should be (and is) an accessible and common interest among people.\n\n3) The interest of the slowed and ambient soundscape can and should influence design methods in the real world, as well as the arts.\n\nThis neutrality hints at the blank space of endless opportunity in the minds of young city-goers. Vaporwave often points out that in the child’s mind, the city should function as a neutral, peaceful, and historical facility for reflection. Vaporwave is the place online where people can share memories about what was important to them, they can find out why those memories were important and how those memories can influence a better design philosophy for our future. Great malls inspire us to believe that commercial forces can be compassionate to buyers through utopian and ambient design.\n\nNo longer the days of excess. Long live the days of sustainability and calmness.\n\nThe way that much of the youth might arrive at philosophical discourse in the postmodern era (or perhaps the “metamodern” era) will be in the analysis of corporate and industrial expansion.\n\nOften, the infrastructures that shaped the cities were the supreme model for excellence. They were examples of creative boundlessness. The ideological impact of these structures, however, went largely unexamined by people who inhabited them. As a result, these structures became like ghosts, especially in their demolished and abandoned state. Architecture was only seen and utilized, but without any true acknowledgment of their significant cultural impact, they became relatives of exploitation.\n\nToday much has changed. With the collective consciousness that is the internet, the Vaporwave movement has evolved itself to the true dreamlike state. Beyond space and time, beyond nature or city structure, truly ethereal, truly beyond.\n\nVaporwave allows us to see the potentiality for the perfect city. This vision and possibility of an urban utopia no longer belongs to the distinguished academics or masterful architects.\n\nIt belongs to everyone."
