        "text": "Vaporwave is a highly diversified genre of music, with almost as many sub-genres as metal. Well, that’s a bit of a stretch. Metal has around ~20ish different and distinct subgenres, whereas vaporwave has around 13 or 14 distinct labels and styles. With creative and eye catching names such as future funk, mallsoft or hypnagognic drift, the genre covers a vast amount of stylistic, aesthetic and musical territory. However, in spite of this, I’ve noticed a number of things labeled as ‘vaporwave’ when they are, in fact, not vaporwave. So before we begin on this journey of vaporwave analysis, it’s important to first establish what vaporwave is, and what it isn’t. So, without further ado, I say with further ado, here are ten things that aren’t vaporwave.\n\nNumber One: Cyberpunk\n\nBlade Runner (dir. Ridley Scot, 1982)\n\nMy favorite movie is Blade Runner. I could’ve dedicated a blog to discussing the artistry and depths of the film, ranging from the bleak view of the future, to the humanity shown in the very post-colonial character of Roy Batty. His tears in rain speech is honestly worthy of it’s own essay… but I digress.\n\nThe reason I bring up Blade Runner is that it was massively instrumental in forging the image and style of cyberpunk. High tech, low lives. It’s a film noir of the future. However, many people tend to conflate the similar imagery and styles of vaporwave iconography with cyberpunk iconography. Which is understandable, both deal with a sense of science fiction, both have touched upon the ideas of a ‘high tech low life’. However that’s where the similarities end.\n\nCyberpunk is increasingly interested in presenting the reality of a juxtaposition, from an existentialist point of view. Take for instance the ideas of virtual reality. Both vaporwave and cyberpunk are big on it. In a cyberpunk depiction of virtual reality, we would see a lonely human being, huddled in a corner. The image would conjure up the impression of a drug addict. Cyberpunk would postulate that people would be addicted to a virtual, false world in the future. Cyberpunk as a genre is very much a reflection of our own world, as Mrbtongue said in his video essay on cyberpunk, who simplified cyberpunk as a complex answer to “How would today’s world react to_____” and points out that cyberpunk, compared to other genres of science fiction, take place decades in the future, not centuries. Cyberpunk is at its best when exploring issues that are “uncomfortably close” to modern society.\n\nContrast that to how vaporwave would chose to depict virtual reality. Vaporwave is much more abstract, and would seem more interesting in depicting what that virtual reality world would look. That’s not to say cyberpunk wouldn’t depict that said VR world, far from it. Psycho-Pass and The Matrix are very much interested in what those VR worlds are like and depict. However, vaporwave is less existential, in a manner of speaking.\n\nVaporwave, in a sense, is more diegetic. Before I go on, let me explain what that means. Diegesis is a specific method in which a filmmaker approaches how they depict sound in their picture. An example of diegetic sound in film is from the first Star Wars movie, the band in the cantina is playing music. The music we hear is the music the characters hear, it’s the same. That music actually exists within the world those characters inhabit. In a way, diegesis allows the viewer another glimpse into the universe the characters live and makes the setting more realized.\n\nAn example of nondiegetic sound or music from the first Star Wars movie would be the opening crawl of text, along with the fanfare. That music doesn’t exist in the Star Wars universe. No one hears it, it’s purely for our own benefit, to enhance the scene.\n\nDiegesis can actually be more abstract than just music. If I’m running with the Star Wars focus, then let me bring up that opening scene from that first movie; the opening crawl of text. Believe it or not, fully formed paragraphs telling the story of what’s going on don’t actually float around in space, and the characters don’t see them. Again, purely for our own enjoyment.\n\nNow what does all this diegesis have to do with vaporwave? As I mentioned earlier, diegesis can be more abstract than just relating to sound within a film. The way I use it, diegesis can also reflect what we is depicted. And this is where I finally get to my point about vaporwave and virtual reality.\n\nVaporwave’s depiction of virtual reality is more… diegetic. Vaporwave depicts a virtual reality that one might see if you were to live in vaporwave’s reality, which is slightly akin to a surrealist reality influenced from 90s nostalgia. Vaporwave shows you the virtual reality advertisement of another world, another time, completely foreign yet appealing.\n\nThat’s the driving through line between vaporwave and cyberpunk. Cyberpunk is speculative, forward looking and, well, punk. It’s aesthetics are interested in a slightly dystopic vision of a near future, taking inspiration of what science could potentially go towards, and a keen interest on what new societal issues we could face.\n\nVaporwave, on the other hand, is less obvious about its intentions. Vaporwave has a very simple, easy and very appealing surface. Vaporwave is subtle. It’s less grungy than cyberpunk. It’s brighter, pink is a very common color in vaporwave art. It’s surreal and weird, it’s highly immersed in internet culture, it’s nostalgic, it’s postmodern, it’s quintessentially post-internet."
