        "text": "From being an artistic and musical movement to an internet meme, vaporwave can be defined in different ways. It’s an aesthetic that managed to click with thousands of people, and spread through social media breaking into the mainstream.\n\nConceptually, it is helplessly reminiscent. A melancholic and distorted look of the aesthetics of the 80’s and 90’s .\n\nIt is characterized by incorporating old images & web design from the early days of the internet, music videos or other elements of pop culture of decades past and mixes it with surreal and distorted elements.\n\nWhether it’s Michael Jackson videos, McDonalds ad’s or Simpsons episodes (which birthed the subgenre, simpsonwave.) Vaporwave takes pieces of memories and collects & distorts them, adding visuals and sound effects that create a sense of deep melancholy, reminiscent of a past that never was. All this mixed with theories of aesthetic canons of ancient Greece , such as Roman busts or Renaissance paintings, Japanese commercialism of the 90s and a compulsive obsession with visual balance and the golden ratio.\n\nAesthetic is defined as, “a set of principles underlying the work of a particular artist or artistic movement.” It is a word frequently found within vaporwave culture, often stylized spread out with full width characters (ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣ.)\n\nMany people refer to the particularly complicated style of vaporwave as “Aesthetic.” In this context, however, Aesthetic refers to a very particular style .\n\nThe YouTuber FrankJavcee brilliantly describes the aesthetics of the Vaporwave:\n\n“It’s like someone that lives in a dystopian future finds a ton of old vhs tapes and is lonely because he is the only remaining person in the world but he is also drugged and floating in the sky in Japan”\n\nTo understand where this movement comes from, we must move away from its visual aesthetics and focus on its influence as a musical genre.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2012, young artists began creating remixes of songs from the 70’s and 80’s, mixing them with smooth jazz and lounge music, creating a new and strange genre, resembling a kind of “sad elevator music” .\n\nThrough Last.fm, Reddit, Bandcamp, Tumblr, 4chan and other online channels, these artists began to share their creations, inspiring and spreading an aesthetic meme that managed to take root in the web.\n\nOne of the most important artists of this genre is Vektroid , whose album “Floral Shoppe” became one of the musical and aesthetic canons that defined Vaporwave.\n\nAlthough most graphic designers are leery when it comes to defining themselves as artists, it is clear that we are more easily influenced by an artistic style than a publicist. The nostalgia, the madness of the 90’s and 80’s and the inspiration in “vintage” graphic design were already great influences of recent years in the world of graphic design, with too many examples to show here. In such an environment, it was easy for Vaporwave to find its place.\n\nLittle by little, the influence of this aesthetic has been seen growing in places like Behance or Domestika, slowly but effectively becoming part of our collective unconscious. That’s why it’s no surprise that many of the major rebranding projects of the last couple of years have ended up “splashed” by the Vaporwave.\n\nMTV: “I AM MY MTV”\n\nTumblr: “TumblrTV”\n\nWe have seen some examples of the immense influence that Vaporwave has had in the world of music, art, advertising and graphic design; but surely one will continue to wonder how a style with a supposedly anti-capitalist mentality becomes mainstream? How can Coca-Cola be inspired by a style that “attacks” the type of mentality that made it an icon? This can be explained in several ways: on the one hand, Vaporwave focuses on nostalgia, and while it views it in a pessimistic and melancholic way, it will always be associated with good memories of childhood and youth.\n\nScott Bocham, in his article for Esquire, gets surprised when listening to the music of this genre. Despite being such a difficult style to be taken seriously (as many musicologists will hurry to point out, much of this music is nothing more than 80s tracks slowed down with a trap beat in the background) he sees himself reflected in those songs, feeling immersed in the nostalgic sounds that makes your imagination fly\n\n“Could it be that the AOL jingle of” You’ve got Mail!” Is for me what the cupcake was for Proust?” After the rebranding campaigns of MTV and Tumblr appeared, many gave the genre for dead, after all, it is a movement that arose in part from Tumblr and for fans of the genre, having seen that aesthetic reach the mainstream was a “bitter” experience.\n\nHowever, the years go by, the 2011 of Vektroid already seems far away and nevertheless Vaporwave is still relevant. It is cynical by nature, it emerged as a reaction to the immense social and economic forces that continue to be a very important part of our lives; issues such as globalization, the era of consuming excessively produced and short-lived products and the manufacturing of nostalgia. It is the only musical style that refers to these aspects of our Zeitgeist and maybe that is why it remains a genre that matters to us.\n\nYou never know what direction design and advertising will take in the next few years and trying to predict fads is like staring at the sea and trying to predict waves. What is clear is that Vaporwave is still alive and it is still a long time before its wake dissipates completely."
