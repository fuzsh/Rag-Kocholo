        "text": "Published by Vilnius Academy of Arts Press, this publication accompanies a PhD student project entitled 'Do the Right Thing' at Vilnius Academy of Arts (March 28th - April 14th 2019) that included a group exhibition (with 23 contributors), an extensive public engagement programme (see below) with roundtables, workshops, discussions, a pirate radio broadcast, DJs, a disco, and a poetry slam! + This year the annual exhibition of Vilnius Academy of Arts’ doctoral students has grown into an expanded project. In an intellectual provocation, the project’s guest curator Dr Marquard Smith, Professor of Artistic Research at VAA, suggested that the project should commemorate the 30th anniversary of Spike Lee’s 1989 film 'Do the Right Thing' and reflect on its significance in today’s context. This prompted the project’s team and participants to at least briefly shift the focus from their individual artistic and theoretical research projects, and try to answer a few more universal and fundamental questions. What does it mean today to do the right thing as an artist, designer, curator, or critic, not in the sense of social conformity or market success, but with an ethical commitment? How to detect the various nodes of power, fight it, or employ it for restoring justice? How to be more that just an active and successful art student, artist, or researcher – an active and responsible citizen? Finally, how do the formulations of these questions, their relevance, and the possible answers change depending on the geographical, historical, and cultural context? With this background in mind, even though the project’s exhibition presents the diverse individual works and research of Art, Design, and Art Criticism doctoral students, the participants simultaneously try to relate their topics to the broader cultural, social, and political context. The individual presentations by the participants of the exhibition, scheduled on March 29th and 30th , and attended by an external expert, the writer, critic, and educator Dr Alice Twemlow, will serve as an elaboration of these perspectives. Equally important is the project’s rich public events programme. It will offer opportunities to hear the team’s conversations about the project’s context on the airwaves of Palanga Street Radio, a DIY broadcasting community, to share ideas and impressions while listening to a live soundtrack reflecting the project’s themes, mixed by this radio station’s DJs during a disco at the artist-run Autarkia space, to take a tour of the parallel exhibitions branching out of the main show and registering the Academy’s subconsious, to splash pop-up poetry verses in the exhibition space, and to join the group morning exercise – peeling potatoes together with the cooks of the Academy’s canteen. The VAA community will get a chance to share their concerns in an anonymous poll, while the doctoral students will be able to take a photo with their supervisors and consultants. A special focus this year is on public discussions, and specifically on the possible forms of artistic and civil activism in the Academy and the urban space. Two events, dedicated to the case of the Reformed Evangelicals’ Park in Vilnius and to the role of activism in the process of art and design studies, will seek to extend the project’s field of concerns beyond the VAA community and involve a broader audience that might not have experience in the professional art and culture field. The discussions will feature well-known local activist practitioners and theorists: Jekaterina Lavrinec, Laima Kreivytė, Kasparas Pocius, Eglė Grėbliauskaitė, Gintautas Mažeikis. The project 'Do the Right Thing' and its exhibition is accompanied by this comprehensive publication which textually and visually explicates the projects’ and the individual participants’ topics, problems, and research fields.

Splash Your Poems at the Titanic! - VAA Titanikas Gallery, 1st floor\n\nThis is a catalogue of two exhibitions and a collection of essays on photography, history, cinema and mapping. The event called photo/carto/historio/graphies is an artistic research project, which uses cartographic strategies to rethink the developments, ideas and stereotypes of Lithuanian photography. The essays published here discuss the re/creation of history and visual constructions of history in cinema, contemporary art and particularly photography. Everything that could not be included into the book (videos, internet comments, etc.) can be found in the project s blog 3xpozicija.lt/kartografija The book is billingual in English and Lithuanian. The reader will find in this volume not only theoretical and philosophical insights, but also many examples from the history of Lithuania, documentary cinema and television films, photography, contemporary and new media art. The book starts with the discussion of the curators about the project and issues it raises; the German art historian Rudolf Frieling has contributed his paper about the links between maps, media, art, archives and text and their representation in contemporary art. The historian Ruta Sermuksnyte discusses representations of the past in film and television and Vasilijus Safronovas analyses the role of power in the formation of history. The textual part of the book ends with a playful essay by the art critic Valentinas Klimasauskas who wanders between photography and reality. A very important component of the book consists of maps and schemes created by the participants of the project; also artists works and documentation of exhibitions. The first exhibition at the Prospekto Gallery included maps and other objects, documentation of the performance and artists works. The second exhibition at the Vilnius Photographic Gallery showed an installation by Milda Zabarauskaite and Robertas Narkus."
