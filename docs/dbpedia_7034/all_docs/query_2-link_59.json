        "text": "MUSICAL VAPORWAVE EVENT\n\n03/23-06/23\n\nVaporwave is a musical genre that emerged in the early 2010s. The genre is characterized by its use of retro imagery and nostalgia, often taken from 1980s or 1990s pop culture. Musically, vaporwave is often based on samples of easy listening or lounge music, as well as snippets of popular songs from that era. The goal of vaporwave is to create a sense of detachment or irony, often by juxtaposing the music with images that are out of context or have been altered in some way.While the genre began as a niche style, it has since gained a small but loyal following among music fans who appreciate its unique blend of camp and nostalgia. The genre has been described as “a nostalgic view of an imagined or actual past that never really existed.” Despite its relatively short history, vaporwave has had a significant impact on popular music, and its influence can be heard in a variety of genres.\n\nBLANK BANSHEE/\n\nvaportrap\n\nelectronic vaporwave\n\nBlank Banshee knows how to keep his audience baited. It’s been three long years since his last record, and he’s spent the last several months issuing cryptic, email-based teasers for an album that was assumed by fans to be called Blank Banshee 2. (His previous albums were titled Blank Banshee 0 and Blank Banshee 1). When the album finally arrived last Monday it was called MEGA, but it’s clearly a product of the same creative vision as its predecessors. Its fragmented-yet-soulful vaportrap bridges the yawning chasm between itself and Blank Banshee 1, both a continuation of and an expansion on Blank Banshee’s signature sound. Yet even if its masterful balance of abstract ambience and danceable trap marks the pinnacle of Blank Banshee’s brand of vaporwave, the conditions surrounding its genesis still remain something of a mystery.\n\nSKYLAR SPENCE/\n\nfuture funk\n\nnu-disco\n\nvaporwave\n\nSkylar Spence (formerly Saint Pepsi) is known for his vaporwave, 80s pop and on a new track premiering on The FADER today, he continues that with a one-off that shouldn't be interpreted as a sign of things to come. He's currently hard at work on his followup to 2015's Prom King, but wants you to take a listen to \"Faithfully\" before anything else. He's been sitting on this one for a while, but warned The FADER that it's not what his next album will sound like. The song is a tight, three minute trip with lots of dreamy keyboards and a gorgeous vocal sample from Aretha Franklin: feels like I've seen you before, she sings."
