        "text": "Bruce Willis is a dad of five daughters who are now supporting him as he battles dementia.\n\nBruce Willis, 69, shares daughters Scout Willis, Rumer Willis and Tallulah Belle Willis with ex-wife Demi Moore, to whom he was married from 1987 to 2000.\n\nThe \"Die Hard\" actor is also father to two more daughters, Mabel Ray Willis and Evelyn Penn Willis, whom he shares with wife Emma Heming Willis.\n\nOn Father's Day in June, Bruce Willis received a special tribute from the women in his life, who described him as their \"favorite girl dad.\"\n\n\"Happy Father’s Day to our favorite girl dad. We love you, BW!,\" Demi Moore wrote on Instagram in a post made in collaboration with Emma Heming Willis as well as Scout Willis, Tallulah Willis and Rumer Willis.\n\nThe post included a slideshow of throwback photos of Bruce Willis with all five of his daughters.\n\nBruce Willis has described his family as the \"most significant part\" of his life.\n\n\"I've learned that my life revolves around my family and friends,\" he said in a 2013 interview. \"When I'm not working, my days are devoted to the women in my life. I don't need anything more than that.\"\n\nHe also shared the lessons he's learned from his daughters, saying, \"Over the years I learned from my daughters how it was more important to listen than to speak. I've discovered through experience that I should hold back sometimes and be more reflective and save myself a lot of aggravation. You learn more by listening and observing.\"\n\nThe actor's family revealed in 2022 that he had been diagnosed with aphasia, a condition where the brain's ability to understand or express language is impaired, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe following year, Bruce Willis's family shared he had also been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, a type of dementia that impacts one's personality and may cause behavioral changes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nRumer Willis shared an update on her dad's health while attending the premiere of her film, \"My Divorce Party,\" on May 1, 2024.\n\n\"He’s great. Yeah, yeah, doing OK. Thank you so much for asking,\" Rumer Willis said of her dad, according to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"I think, for me, through this experience, what’s been so incredible is my dad is so beloved, and that’s been so evident in the transparency with which we’ve been sharing,\" he said. \"And I think if there’s any way sharing our experience brings hope — whatever comes forward as a family — that can have an effect and bring any sort of hope, comfort to someone else experiencing that, then to me, that’s … everything.\"\n\nThroughout his health issues, Bruce Willis's family has been by his side.\n\nAt the time of his diagnosis with aphasia, they said in a statement they were moving forward as a \"strong family unit.\"\n\nWhat to know about Bruce Willis' five kids\n\nRumer Glenn Willis\n\nBorn Aug. 16, 1988, in Paducah, Kentucky, Rumer Glenn Willis is Bruce Willis and Moore first child together.\n\nFollowing in her parents' footsteps, she made her onscreen debut as a child actress in her mom's 1995 film \"Now and Then,\" in which she was credited under the name Willa Glen.\n\nShe has since appeared in numerous films and TV shows including \"Striptease,\" \"The Whole Nine Yards,\" \"Hostage,\" \"The House Bunny,\" \"Empire,\" \"Pretty Little Liars\" and \"9-1-1,\" among many others.\n\nShe has also taken part in reality competition shows such as \"Dancing with the Stars,\" in which she and her dance partner Valentin Chmerkovskiy were crowned champions of season 20.\n\nRumer Glenn Willis shares one child, a daughter named Louetta Isley Thomas Willis, with her boyfriend, musician Derek Richard Thomas.\n\nOn her dad's birthday on March 19, Rumer Willis wrote on Instagram that to be loved by her dad is \"such a gift,\" adding, \"You are the funniest, most tender, charming, out of this world silly, talented and magical papa.\"\n\nWhen Rumer Willis turned 36 on Aug. 16, 2024, her stepmom Emma Heming Willis shared birthday wishes for her on Instagram, writing in a Story, \"We adore you,\" above a photo of her daughters posing with their eldest stepsister.\n\nScout LaRue Willis\n\nThe second child of Bruce Willis and Moore, Scout Willis was born July 20, 1991, in Sun Valley, Idaho. She also appeared in her mom's films as a child actress in \"The Scarlet Letter\" and \"Breakfast of Champions.\"\n\nScout Willis later pursued her passion in music. In 2021, she released her debut single, \"Love Without Possession,\" and the following year released another song, \"Woman At Best.\" She released a full-length album in June 2022.\n\nA graduate of Brown University, she also took part in an 2015 art exhibition in London displaying her self-portraits.\n\nTallulah Belle Willis\n\nTallulah Belle Willis was born Feb. 3, 1994, in Los Angeles.\n\nShe spent much of her younger years on her family's ranch in Idaho, and according to an interview she gave to Teen Vogue in 2015, she was mostly sheltered from her family's Hollywood life until she was in third grade, when they moved back to California.\n\nShe later built a career in fashion after launching her own clothing brand, Wyllis.\n\nTallulah Willis stepped out in April to celebrate her dad's acting career. Wearing a baseball cap with the word \"Bruce\" on it, she attended the 30th anniversary celebration of \"Pulp Fiction\" in Hollywood alongside her stepmom.\n\nIn May 2023, Tallulah Willis opened up about her dad's declining health in a first-person piece for Vogue, writing, \"I've known that something was wrong for a long time.\"\n\n\"It started out with a kind of vague unresponsiveness, which the family chalked up to Hollywood hearing loss: 'Speak up! Die Hard messed with Dad's ears,'\" she wrote at the time, adding that \"later, that unresponsiveness broadened.\"\n\nShe also opened up about how she's learned to treasure her memories with her father, writing, \"Every time I go to my dad's house, I take tons of photos -- of whatever I see, the state of things. I'm like an archaeologist, searching for treasure in stuff that I never used to pay much attention to. I have every voicemail from him saved on a hard drive. I find that I'm trying to document, to build a record for the day when he isn't there to remind me of him and of us.\"\n\nTallulah Willis revealed in 2024 that she was diagnosed with autism as an adult. In the comments section of a video she shared on Instagram of herself as a child with her dad, the 30-year-old said she had been diagnosed with autism within the past year.\n\n\"Actually this is the first time I've ever publicly shared my diagnosis,\" she wrote. \"Found out this summer and it's changed my life.\"\n\nIn addition to her autism diagnosis, Tallulah Willis has previously shared publicly that she was diagnosed with ADHD as a teenager and, in 2022, was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, a \"mental illness that severely impacts a person's ability to manage their emotions,\" according to the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nMabel Ray Willis\n\nBruce Willis and Heming Willis welcomed their first child together, Mabel Ray Willis, on April 1, 2012.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, Mabel spent her first few years of life living in Bedford Hills, New York.\n\nIn a 2017 interview with Elle Decor, Heming Willis explained the reason behind her decision to raise her kids outside of New York City, and not in Los Angeles.\n\n\"We love the East Coast. We knew New York was where we would end up and ultimately want to raise our kids, but we also have a love/hate relationship with the city. It’s busy, and the spaces can be small,\" she said. \"We wanted our kids to be able to have more room and a yard to run in. I also wanted to keep the kids as sheltered as we could from the paparazzi, and that scene is still very prevalent in L.A.; it’s not bad in New York, and it’s zero up where we live, so that played a big part in our decision-making too.\"\n\nMabel features prominently on her mom's Instagram account, and is frequently photographed outdoors, enjoying nature and her family.\n\nEvelyn Penn Willis\n\nEvelyn Penn Willis is Bruce Willis' fifth child and his second with wife Heming Willis. She was born May 5, 2014.\n\nIn 2023, Heming Willis shared on Instagram a heartwarming story about Evelyn \"looking up fun facts\" about dementia for her father.\n\nHeming Willis explained in a video that Evelyn had asked her around that time, \"Did you know that people with dementia can become severely dehydrated?\"\n\n\"[Evelyn] said, 'I was at school the other day and I had some free time, and I was looking up fun facts about dementia,'\" Heming Willis said at the time. She added that the moment was \"not funny, but it's kinda funny,\" because Evelyn shares her father's curiosity.\n\n\"She really is her father's child, because these two love some, just, random facts,\" she added."
