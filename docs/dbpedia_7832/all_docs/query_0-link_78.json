        "text": "Although born March 19, 1955 in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany, Army brat Walter Bruce Willis was raised in New Jersey.\n\nAfter working on the New York stage for a few years, Willis made his screen debut in the 1980 crime drama The First Deadly Sin, starring Frank Sinatra, but he didn't land his big break until he was cast opposite Cybil Shepherd in the TV series Moonlighting. The private eye comedy made Willis a star and aired for four seasons.\n\nHis big-screen career kicked into high gear with the 1987 comedy Blind Date, directed by Blake Edwards and co-starring Kim Basinger, but it was the 1988 action blockbuster Die Hard that launched Willis onto the Hollywood A-list. The role of wise-cracking, indestructible cop John McClane perfectly suited Willis' smirking, blue-collar tough guy persona; he would reprise the role three times, most recently in 2007's Live Free or Die Hard.\n\nWillis also indulged his passion for blues music with the release of the album The Return of Bruno. With the exception of his voice-over role as baby Mikey in the Look Who's Talking films, however, Willis' film career post-Die Hard was marked by several high-profile box office flops (such as Hudson Hawk and The Bonfire of the Vanities) until Quentin Tarantino cast him in 1994's Pulp Fiction, which went on to win an Oscar as well as the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Willis also stretched his dramatic acting chops with roles in films such as In Country and Nobody's Fool."
