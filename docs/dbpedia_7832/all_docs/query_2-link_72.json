The project was an advertising campaign for Megafon, a Russian telecommunications company. Although rumors circulated that Willis had sold the rights to his face to Deepcake, he later refuted these allegations.\n\n• Worst Movie of Bruce Willis Award\n\nIn 2021, just before the filming of \"Out of Death,\" Bruce Willis's role and dialogue were reduced, and all his scenes were scheduled to be shot in a single day. This change was made at short notice, just days before Willis was due to appear on set. Unfortunately, Willis's performances in eight movies released in 2021 were so subpar that the Golden Raspberry Awards, an annual show that recognizes the year's worst movies and performances, created a new category specifically for him. However, the category was later withdrawn by the Golden Raspberry Awards due to the inappropriateness of awarding it to someone whose performance was impacted by a medical condition.\n\n• Misfiring of Bullets\n\nRegarding the incident on the set of \"Hard Kill,\" actress Lala Kent alleged that Bruce Willis fired a gun at the wrong time twice, leaving her with no time to react. However, the film's producer and armorer refuted Kent's account. Kent explained that during the scene, she was supposed to be in danger, and then her on-screen father was meant to save her by firing his gun. However, she had her back to him and was supposed to duck after he delivered his line but before he fired the gun.\n\n• Forgetting Roles\n\nDuring filming of White Elephant in 2021, two crew members claimed that Bruce Willis asked them directly, \"I know why you're here, and I know why you're here, but why am I here?\" Additionally, director Jesse V. Johnson had a brief encounter with Willis before shooting began in Georgia in April of that year and noticed a change in his demeanor.\n\n• Randall Emmett's Abusive Behaviour\n\nThere are allegations that producer Randall Emmett knew about Willis' health issues but still pressured him to work. However, Bruce Willis' attorney, Martin Singer, denied these accusations, saying,\n\n“My client continued working after his medical diagnosis because he wanted to work and was able to do so, just like many others diagnosed with aphasia who are capable of continuing to work,” Singer, 70, told the Los Angeles Times for an article published on Thursday, June 30. “Because Mr. Willis appeared in those films, they could get financed. That resulted in literally thousands of people having jobs, many during the COVID-19 Pandemic.”\n\nBruce Willis, prior to his retirement, worked with producer Randall Emmett on a number of films, including Midnight in the Switchgrass, which was Emmett's first time directing. However, according to the Los Angeles Times, Emmett informed his then-fiancée Lala Kent that Willis was having difficulty during the movie's production. Kent remembers her former fiancé telling her in a phone call, which was overheard by two other witnesses, \"I can't keep doing this. It's just so sad. Bruce can't remember any of his lines. He doesn't know where he is.\" Despite this, the producer of The Irishman denied any knowledge \"of any decline in Mr. Willis' health\" in a statement to the Los Angeles Times. The alleged phone call to Kent took place in September 2020, well before Willis' health struggles became public. However, according to Alicia Haverland, a property master on Midnight in the Switchgrass, the actor's condition was an open secret on the film set.\n\n• Kevin Smith Apologizes to Bruce\n\nFollowing Bruce Willis's retirement announcement due to his aphasia diagnosis, Kevin Smith apologized for his previous negative comments about the actor. In 2011, Smith directed Willis in the movie \"Cop Out\" and referred to the experience as \"soul-crushing\". He had also made negative remarks about Willis's failure to participate in a poster shoot and had made jokes about harming himself or others during the production of the film. In light of Willis's retirement, Smith recognized that his comments were \"petty\" and expressed remorse for any harm caused.\n\nRelationships & More Marital StatusMarried Marriage Date• November 21, 1987 (Demi Moore)\n\n• 2004 (Brooke Burns; engaged)\n\n• 21 March 2009 (Emma Heming) Girlfriend/AffairsBrooke Burns (American fashion model, game show host, actress, and television personality)\n\nFamily Wife/Spouse• Demi Moore (Actress) (separated on June 24, 1998; divorced on October 18, 2000)\n\n• Emma Heming (Actress and Model)\n\nChildrenDaughter- 5 (3 with Demi Moore and 2 with Emma Heming)\n\nWith Demi Moore-\n\n• Rumer Glenn (Actress) (b.

Willis is now retired from acting.\n\nAfter joining the drama club at Penns Grove High School, Bruce Willis found his passion for acting, which later led him to become a renowned American actor.\n\nBruce Willis was an active member of the drama club during his school days and eventually became the student council president. Later, he attended Montclair State University and was cast in a production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. However, he left school in 1977 before completing his degree.\n\nAlthough Bruce Willis was previously a Lutheran , he no longer practices the religion. In a July 1998 interview, he stated:\n\nOrganized religions in general, in my opinion, are dying forms. They were all very important when we didn’t know why the sun moved, why weather changed, why hurricanes occurred, or volcanoes happened. Modern religion is the end trail of modern mythology. But there are people who interpret the Bible literally. Literally! I choose not to believe that’s the way. And that’s what makes America cool, you know?”\n\nBruce Willis and his then-wife Demi Moore supported Democratic Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis’s Presidential campaign in 1988. However, four years later, he endorsed President George H. W. Bush’s re-election and spoke out against Bill Clinton. He gave a speech at the 2000 Republican National Convention and supported George W. Bush during the 1996 elections.\n\nIn 2006, Willis expressed his belief that the United States should increase its involvement in Colombia to combat drug trafficking.\n\nDuring interviews, Willis advocated for higher salaries for teachers and police officers. He has also expressed disappointment with the US foster care system and the treatment of Native Americans. Additionally, he supports the right to bear arms, stating that legal gun owners have that right and that taking guns away only leaves them in the hands of bad actors.\n\nWhile Willis did not endorse or contribute to the 2008 presidential campaign, he stated in interviews conducted in June 2007 that he still held some Republican beliefs.\n\nOn August 17, 2006, Willis’s name appeared in an advertisement in the Los Angeles Times denouncing Hamas and Hezbollah and supporting Israel during the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. In 2012, he publicly stated that he held unfavorable views toward Mitt Romney.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1973, Bruce Willis worked as a security guard at the Salem Nuclear Power Plant and transported crew members at the DuPont Chambers Works factory in Deepwater, New Jersey. He later became a private investigator before pursuing acting.\n\nUpon moving to New York in the early 1980s, Willis worked as a bartender at Kamikaze, a Manhattan-based art bar.\n\nWillis was chosen from a pool of 3,000 actors for the role of David Addison Jr. in the television show Moonlighting, which aired from 1985 to 1989. His work on the show earned him an Emmy award in 2000 for his role as the father of Ross Geller’s girlfriend on Friends. He went on to star in the 1987 film Blind Date, followed by Sunset (1988), where he played cowboy actor Tom Mix. However, it was his role as John McClane in Die Hard (1988) that propelled him to stardom. He continued to star in successful films such as Pulp Fiction (in the role of Butch Coolidge) (1994) and The Sixth Sense (1999) as Dr. Malcolm Crowe.\n\nWillis has also worked on animated films, including the 1996 cartoon Bruno the Kid, where he served as the executive producer and starred as a CGI version of himself. He also starred in Beavis and Butt-head Do America (1996) and made a cameo appearance as himself in The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (2019).\n\nAside from acting, Willis has lent his voice to several films. He played the talking baby in Look Who’s Talking (1989) and its sequel, Look Who’s Talking Too (1990). He also voiced RJ the Raccoon in Over the Hedge (2006) and provided his voice and likeness to the character Trey Kincaid in the PlayStation video game Apocalypse (1998).\n\nCheyenne Enterprises, a film production company, was founded by Willis and Arnold Rifkin in 2000. However, Willis resigned from the company and left Rifkin solely in charge after the release of Live Free or Die Hard.\n\nAside from his film endeavors, Willis owns small businesses in Hailey, Idaho, including The Mint Bar and The Liberty Theater (later donated to Sun Valley Center for the Arts).
