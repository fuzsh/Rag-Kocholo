        "text": "Bruce Willis is a girl dad ... times five.\n\nThe actor shares three daughters (Rumer, 35, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 30) with his ex-wife, Demi Moore, and two daughters (Mabel, 12, and Evelyn, 9) with his wife, Emma Heming Willis.\n\nOn the \"Die Hard\" actor's 69th birthday on March 19, he received a lovely tribute from Rumer.\n\n\"Oh Daddio, to be loved by you is such a gift,\" she wrote on an Instagram slideshow with father-daughter photos. \"You are the funniest, most tender, charming, out of this world silly, talented and magical papa.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Looking through these photos this morning I am just filled with the deepest gratitude that we chose to spend this life together. I am your first baby and man sometimes I wish I could be tiny enough to just cozy up on your chest again and laugh and cuddle you. I love you so deep in my bones I don’t know how my muscles hold them. You are the greatest papa I could ever hope for. Thank you for your generosity, your silliness and heart. Lou loves you so big.\"\n\nRumer's last line referred to her daughter, Louetta, who was born on April 18, 2023.\n\n\"This is beautiful Rumer,\" Heming Willis commented on Instagram. \"Love you both so much.\"\n\nScout also chimed in with birthday love to \"the king.\"\n\n\"Wild how so little has changed even though so much has changed,\" she wrote in her Instagram post. \"My dad is one of my best friends, perhaps now on a deeper level than ever honestly. I cherish his affection and the immense freedom with which he’s always loved us.\"\n\nScout described the third photo in her slideshow of her and Willis at a \"super fancy debutante ball\" for which her mom Demi Moore made her take waltz lessons.\n\n\"When they had my dad and I start the evening dancing, I asked if he knew what he was doing and he said 'Just go with it' and we did. He swung me around that fancy ballroom with Jersey boy confidence and a mischievous elegance that I pray every day I inherited.\"\n\nDescribing her dad as a \"tender, moody, beautiful, very Piscean man, whose depth of love for his family can only be felt, not articulated,\" Rumer then wrote, \"Any words I use would be woefully inadequate. So instead I want to say thank you for loving my papa, thank you for sharing your stories of what he means to you, it’s such a gift to feel your love. Happy happy birthday to the GOAT.\"\n\nThe actor's blended family has been close over the years, coming together over holidays, birthdays and Father's Day. Moore was also a guest at his wedding to Emma Heming Willis.\n\nThey have all been showing their support for Bruce Willis and each other during the difficult moment they currently face. In March 2022, Willis' family revealed that he was diagnosed with aphasia, a disorder caused by damage to the brain that impairs speaking, reading, writing and understanding others, according to the National Aphasia Association.\n\nDue to his health issues, the family announced Willis would be \"stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.\"\n\nOn Feb. 16, Willis' family gave an update on his health, posted to the webpage for the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration. Willis' condition has progressed and they now have a more specific diagnosis for what he's been experiencing — frontotemporal dementia (known as FTD).\n\n\"Unfortunately, challenges with communication are just one symptom of the disease Bruce faces. While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis,\" the statement read.\n\nIn light of the news, Scout Willis said that she's been feeling \"emotionally tired and a bit overwhelmed\" about what's been happening to her dad. However, she added that she's also in \"awe\" of all the support he's been receiving online lately.\n\nOn Bruce Willis' 68th birthday, he received a lot of love from fans when Moore posted some sweet pics of him and their blended family together.\n\nWillis' birthday that year was difficult for Heming Willis. In a video she shared on Instagram, she opened up about what it's like to be her husband's caregiver and said she experiences \"grief every day.\"\n\nHowever, when she celebrated their 14th wedding anniversary on March 21, 2023 she said she felt a lot of joy when her friend surprised her with a gorgeous bouquet of flowers.\n\n\"It got me thinking about how hard these types of 'special occasions' can be on caregivers. When usually our person would acknowledge the event, now their changing brains just can’t. And that is what it is,\" she said.\n\n\"So my point is this. If you know someone that is looking after someone else, don’t ask what you can do, just do. This random act of kindness will honestly stay with me for a long time,\" Heming Willis continued.\n\nRead on to learn more about the supportive family by Willis' side.\n\nBruce Willis' daughters with Demi Moore\n\nRumer Willis\n\nIn August 1988, Bruce Willis and Moore welcomed their first child, daughter Rumer Willis, into their lives. An actor like her parents, Rumer Willis made her screen debut at 5 years old in her mom's 1995 film \"Now and Then,\" and has gone on to appear in \"Striptease,\" \"The House Bunny,\" \"Sorority Row,\" \"90210,\" \"Empire,\" \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" and more.\n\nIn 2015, Rumer Willis also made her theatrical debut on Broadway when she played the blond bombshell Roxie Hart in \"Chicago.\"\n\nShe used her dancing skills to win Season 20 of \"Dancing with the Stars.\"\n\nIn December 2022, Rumer announced on Instagram that she was expecting her first child with her boyfriend, Derek Richard Thomas.\n\nThe \"Hostage\" star shared three photos of her baby bump, including one with Thomas kissing her stomach. Moore later shared the same pictures on her Instagram account and captioned them, \"Entering my hot kooky unhinged grandma era.\"\n\nRumer Willis replied, “Love you mama.”\n\nIn April, Rumer Willis and Thomas welcomed a baby girl named Louetta Isley Thomas Willis.\n\n“You are pure magic,” she wrote in an Instagram post, sharing a sweet picture of her daughter. “Born at home on Tuesday, April 18th. You are more than we ever dreamed of.”\n\nMoore commented on the post, \"Pure love for this little birdie,\" with a red heart emoji.\n\nFor Rumer's 35th birthday, Moore wasn't shy about showing all the love for her daughter, sharing an emotional post on Instagram Aug. 16.\n\n\"My life changed the day you were born,\" Moore began the caption. \"You brought a depth, meaning, and purpose to my existence along with an understanding of love that I had never known.\"\n\nThe first picture in the carousel is a throwback shot of Moore standing with Rumer Willis in front of an illuminated birthday cake. The post features another throwback shot before showing a powerful mother-daughter moment as Rumer Willis is giving birth.\n\n\"Now here you are my baby, with your own baby, bringing even greater meaning, magic, and love into all of our lives,\" Moore wrote, rounding out the photos with an image of her resting with Rumer Willis and baby Louetta.\n\nRumer Willis responded to the post, writing, \"Oh mama I love you so. Knowing what it takes to help bring a soul into this world gives it a whole new meaning for me.\"\n\nShe continued, \"I always thought this was my day but I know now it has always been ours. Happy birthday mama.\"\n\nScout Willis\n\nIn July 1991, Bruce Willis and Moore welcomed their second daughter, Scout Willis. Like her older sister, she ventured into Hollywood as a girl.\n\nIn 1995, Scout Willis made her acting debut starring alongside her mother in 1995's \"The Scarlet Letter,\" and she also appeared in \"Bandits\" and \"Breakfast of Champions.\"\n\nBut most of her career has been spent in other pursuits. In 2009, Moore announced on Twitter that her daughter was going to attend Brown University and she was \"so proud\" of her for \"(working) her butt off.\" She graduated in 2013.\n\nIn 2012, Scout Willis pursued another passion — music. That year, she released an EP titled \"Gus + Scout,\" and continued to release music. In 2021, she released her debut single, “Love Without Possession,” which lead to her releasing her self-titled debut album in June 2022.\n\n“Looking back through the lens of this album and my own personal growth work, I’m in love with every experience that inspired these songs, every moment of challenge, heartbreak and victory, because each of them conspired to get me to this exact moment and I’ve never been more in love with myself and my life than I am right now,” she said in a statement, according to People.\n\nShe's also experimented with fashion. In 2016, at the age of 24, she made her New York Fashion Week debut when she showed off her clothing line called Scout’s General.\n\nTallulah Willis\n\nIn February 1994, Moore and Bruce Willis welcomed their youngest daughter, Tallulah Willis.\n\nIn a January 2015 essay she wrote for Teen Vogue, Tallulah Willis said, growing up on a ranch in Idaho, she didn't realize her parents were famous. It wasn't until she moved to L.A to start classes in third grade that she realized the \"extent\" of their fame.\n\nTallulah Willis said the attention of fame affected her, with constant scrutiny of her appearance leading to an eating disorder. She wrote her depression started to become \"overwhelming\" in college so she went into inpatient treatment for 45 days, which helped her break old patterns and feel more excited about life.\n\nAs an actor, Tallulah Willis has appeared in films such as \"Bandits,\" \"The Scarlet Letter\" and \"The Whole Ten Yards.\"\n\nShe also made a name for herself in the fashion industry when she launched her debut clothing brand, Wyllis, in 2020.\n\n“I want it to be an extension of myself,” she told People about her fashion line at the time. “I think that when you do a personally named brand, there is a closer connection because it’s who you are.”\n\nOn March 15, she posted a throwback video on Instagram from when she was a child attending an event with her dad. In the caption and later comments, she confirmed that she was diagnosed with ASD, or autism spectrum disorder.\n\n“Actually this is the first time I’ve ever publicly shared my diagnosis. Found out this summer and it’s changed my life,\" she replied.\n\nBruce Willis' daughters with Emma Heming Willis\n\nMabel Willis\n\nBruce Willis and Moore got divorced in 2000 and he later wed model Emma Heming Willis in 2009.\n\nIn April 2012, the couple welcomed their first daughter, Mabel Willis. Heming Willis celebrated their daughter's 10th birthday when she shared a sweet clip of Mabel saying her ambition in life is to be a \"shark\" on \"Shark Tank.\"\n\nHeming Willis captioned the cute clip, \"That’s right baby, dream BIG, keep reaching for the stars and remember to live it up ... You are all heart and soul. Thank you for choosing us because you are so loved and respected.\"\n\nIn July 2022, she posted a sweet video of Bruce Willis and Mabel dancing to an altered version of Lizzo's \"About Damn Time.\"\n\nEvelyn Willis\n\nIn May 2014, Heming Willis and Bruce Willis welcomed their youngest daughter, Evelyn Willis."
