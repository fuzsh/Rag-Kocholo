After Brian's new fling breaks her hip, he gets the pleasure of becoming her errand boy.\n\nThe One Where Ross Meets Elizabeth's Dad\n\nRoss fails to impress his girlfriend's father, and Phoebe makes Chandler and Monica paranoid by chronicling their every move in a fictional book she is writing.\n\nThe One With The Ring\n\nSince she is the only one who knows that Chandler plans to ask Monica to marry him, Phoebe helps Chandler shop for a wedding ring, while Rachel's wish for Paul to reveal his emotions creates a new set of problems.\n\nEpisode 4\n\nIn this episode Jeremy Clarkson subjects the new Kia Ceeâd to a thorough road test involving eels, curry, a rock legend, an American cop, and a rather unusual game of rugby involving James May. Meanwhile, Richard Hammond is in Mexico for a nervous road test of the Mastretta sports car, a trio of hot hatchbacks tear it up on the test track and Formula One racing driver Lewis Hamilton takes his turn as the star in the Reasonably Priced Car."
