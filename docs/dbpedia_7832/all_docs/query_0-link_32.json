        "text": "Career\n\nWillis had a number of small film roles in the early 1980s before he was hired to play a wisecracking detective opposite Cybill Shepherd in the television sitcom Moonlighting (1985–89). The show made Willis a household name and helped to launch his film career. In the film Die Hard (1988) Willis portrayed a cynical but good-natured New York City police detective who finds himself embroiled in a terrorist attack on a Los Angeles, California, office building. The film was a major box-office success and helped establish Willis as a leading action hero. It spawned the sequels Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990), Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995), Live Free or Die Hard (2007), and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013).\n\nWillis leaned toward roles in violent and darkly comedic films. In Pulp Fiction (1994) he played a professional boxer who double-crosses a mobster after agreeing to throw a fight. In 12 Monkeys (1995) he portrayed a convict sent back in time to investigate a virus that devastated humankind. In the science-fiction action film The Fifth Element (1997) he played a cab driver searching for mystical stones to save the planet. While Willis continued to act in large-budget action films—including Armageddon (1998) and Tears of the Sun (2003)—he also appeared in comedies, including The Whole Nine Yards (2000). In 1999 he starred in The Sixth Sense as a psychologist who counsels a child who claims to see dead people. The drama was a critical and commercial success. Willis then appeared in the supernatural thriller Unbreakable (2000).\n\nWillis’s subsequent films included Sin City (2005), which was adapted from a graphic novel series; the thriller 16 Blocks (2006); and the buddy comedy Cop Out (2010). He also appeared in the action movies The Expendables and Red (both 2010) as well as their sequels (2012 and 2013, respectively). Among Willis’s other roles in 2012 were a lonely cop in the whimsical Moonrise Kingdom, a time-traveling hit man in the sci-fi thriller Looper, and a professional gambler in the comedy-drama Lay the Favorite. G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013) provided another rugged action role for the actor. In 2014 Willis reprised his Sin City role in the sequel Sin City: A Dame to Kill For. In 2015 he played a mercenary in the musical comedy Rock the Kasbah and a kidnapped former spy in the action flick Extraction.\n\nWillis later starred in the 2018 remake of Death Wish, a 1974 action film about a father who becomes a vigilante after his family is attacked. In Glass (2019) he reprised his role as the security guard/superhero from Unbreakable. His other films from 2019 included the comedy Between Two Ferns and Motherless Brooklyn, a crime drama set in the 1950s. Over the next few years he starred in a string of action movies that included Breach (2020), Out of Death (2021), and A Day to Die (2022).\n\nWillis made his Broadway debut in 2015, appearing in an adaptation of Stephen King’s novel Misery. Willis portrayed a writer held captive by an obsessed fan."
