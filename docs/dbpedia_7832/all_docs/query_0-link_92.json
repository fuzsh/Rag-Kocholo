        "text": "Moments before the climactic scene in which the gates of hell fly open in 1990’s Die Hard 2, Bruce Willis’ good-guy cop, John McClane, tries to prevent a large airplane from executing a doomed landing through a blizzard on Christmas Eve at Dulles International Airport. With radio communication severed, McClane grabs two pipes, paint thinner and a handful of rags and makes for the runway. He lights the rags, creating two makeshift torches. As the monster jet hurtles toward him, McClane waves the torches, hoping the pilot will realize he should pull up, not put down. This goes beyond Mission: Impossible. It is Mission: Insane. The odds are higher that the plane will turn into Santa’s sleigh. McClane knows this. We know this. Yet we hope, as desperately as McClane,…\n\nBruce Willis doesn’t have the same sinewy biceps of his peers Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. But nobody will ever say that he didn’t climb his way to the top of the Hollywood ladder, rung by rung. Born on a U.S. military base in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany, Willis was raised in Carneys Point, New Jersey, by his soldier turned-welder father, David, and his German reared mother, Marlene. (They divorced when he was a teen.) He says he was bitten by the acting bug as a wee Cub Scout when he performed in vaudevillian-like skits. “I did a gag where you pretend to show the audience that you’re mixing up something and then at the last minute it’s like you’re going to throw it on the audience,” he told GQ in…\n\nJOHN MCCLANE DIE HARD FRANCHISE 1988-2013 THE ROLE Come out to the coast! We’ll get together! Have a few laughs! John McClane never did get to enjoy a breezy Christmas Eve in Los Angeles. (Sigh.) Instead, the weary New York City cop summoned his inner-Roy Rogers and played the hero at Nakatomi Plaza, the building where the hostages included his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). After her office party is besieged, McClane single handedly thwarts the money grubbing villains by doing it all — we’re talking climbing into the vents, eavesdropping on conversations, shooting the bad guys, reporting the action to the (mostly inept) law enforcement officers and jumping off the roof mid-explosion. He even outsmarts the group’s masterful leader, Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). Now can someone please get this…\n\n(VOICE) LOOK WHO’S TALKING 1989 LOOK WHO’S TALKING TOO 1990 THE ROLE Ever wonder what’s going on in the mind of a baby? That was the gimmick behind this surprise hit in which a newborn offers his thoughts on emerging from the womb (“Put me back in!”), eating (“Somebody burp me before I blow up!”) and life itself (“Where did I go wrong?”). And get this: the baby sounds exactly like Bruce Willis! BEHIND THE SCENES Writer and director Amy Heckerling was inspired to write the film after she and her then-husband, writer Neal Israel, welcomed a bundle of joy. “We’d be making up lines and I thought, ‘This is a movie,’” she told The Wrap in 2014. Willis’ baby talk added to the magic: “He has an amazing bag…\n\nTHE ROLE Peter Fallow (Willis), a has-been tabloid journalist, is given the opportunity of a lifetime when he stumbles upon a story involving a hit-and-run case that has left a young Black man dead. Racial tensions run high when Wall Street hotshot Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is arrested for the crime, even though his cash grabbing mistress, Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith), was actually behind the wheel. A highly publicized trial-by-media ensues under the watchful eye of Judge Leonard White (Morgan Freeman). BEHIND THE SCENES Brian De Palma’s ill-fated adaptation of Tom Wolfe’s beloved tome was plagued by controversies. The casting of Willis as disheveled drunkard Fallow raised eyebrows, and fans of the book were not much happier with the additions of Hanks and Griffith, nor were they enamored by any…\n\nTHE ROLE His real name is Eddie Hawkins, and he’s a reformed cat burglar finally on the cusp of a prison release. But as he’s being led down the jail’s corridor, his parole officer forces him to take part in an international heist. BEHIND THE SCENES Willis may have nurtured this caper for 12 years, but the end result will go down as an epic Hollywood disaster. For starters, per The New York Times, the budget ballooned to well past $50 million thanks to a production that included stops in Italy, England and Hungary. The script was constantly rewritten. Director Michael Lehmann was inexperienced. Shooting dragged on for 106 days. It pulled in a measly $16 million and took a critical beating. For what it’s worth, The New Yorker critic…"
