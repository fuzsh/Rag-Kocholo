        "text": "In 1925 Balanchivadze joined the Ballets Russes, a dance company directed by another Russian, Sergei Diaghilev. (It was Diaghilev who changed Balanchine’s name from the original.) Balanchine choreographed 10 works for the Ballets Russes. The works were performed in Europe, the United States, and South America. The creative company awakened the public’s interest in dance.\n\nBalanchine also worked for other European dance troupes and formed his own company, Les Ballets, in Paris, France. In the early 1930s he moved to the United States, where he was asked to organize a dance institution equal to those in Europe. In 1934 he helped form the School of American Ballet. Its students performed as the American Ballet company. Over the next decade, Balanchine became a great influence on American dance, earning the nickname Mr. B.\n\nIn 1946 Balanchine helped found the Ballet Society. Two years later it was reorganized as the New York City Ballet. The company, known for performing works by Balanchine, became very popular with audiences and critics.\n\nBalanchine was known around the world. Almost every leading ballet company has staged at least one of his ballets. In all, he choreographed more than 400 works. Among them are The Nutcracker (1954) and Don Quixote (1965). In addition to his ballets, Balanchine also choreographed for musical theater, opera, television, and movies. He remained with the New York City Ballet until 1982, when ill health forced him to retire. He died in New York City on April 30, 1983."
