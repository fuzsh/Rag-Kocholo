        "text": "Full Name: Giorgi Melitonovitch Balanchivadze\n\nProfession: Ballet Choreographer\n\nBiography: George Balanchine was a Georgian American choreographer who is often associated with the transformation of American ballet. He was trained at the Imperial Ballet School and later danced with the Mariinsky Theatre. In the wake of the Russian Revolution, Balanchine left the newly formed Soviet Union and made his way to Western Europe, where his work was noticed by impresario Serge Diaghilev.\n\nBalanchine's association with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes was a turning point in his career. After the Ballets Russes disbanded, he moved to the United States at the invitation of arts patron Lincoln Kirstein, with the vision of creating a ballet culture in America. In 1934, Balanchine co-founded the School of American Ballet in New York City, which became the training ground for dancers of the New York City Ballet, established in 1948.\n\nAs the artistic director and primary choreographer of the New York City Ballet, Balanchine revolutionized modern ballet. His style stripped away the ornate costumes and sets typical of 19th-century ballet and emphasized speed, flow, and the athleticism of dance, aligning ballet with American culture. His approach to ballet was musical and neoclassical, often compared to the work of composers such as Bach in its structure and form.\n\nAmong his most celebrated works are Serenade (1934), Symphony in C (1947), Agon (1957), and Jewels (1967). Balanchine collaborated with several composers, including Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith, and was known for his musicality, often saying, \"See the music, hear the dance.\"\n\nBalanchine created a rich repertoire, nurturing talents such as Suzanne Farrell, Mikhail Baryshnikov, and Jerome Robbins. His legacy is maintained through the Balanchine Trust, which licenses his works, and the continued prominence of the New York City Ballet.\n\nBorn: January 22, 1904\n\nBirthplace: St. Petersburgh, Russian Empire\n\nGeneration: Greatest Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Rabbit\n\nStar Sign: Aquarius"
