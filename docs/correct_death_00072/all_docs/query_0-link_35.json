        "text": "It's an unmistakable sound, a can't-miss holiday tradition. It's \"George Balanchine's The Nutcracker,\" with the music of Tchaikovsky and the choreography of the legendary co-founder of the New York City Ballet.\n\nThe company has been performing it for nearly 70 years each holiday season.\n\nAssociate artistic director and former principal dancer Wendy Whelan said thereâs no other production quite like it. Sheâs danced in âThe Nutcrackerâ countless times during her illustrious career.\n\nâItâs absolutely the best, Balanchine did not hold back on his ideas for this. He was so proud of this ballet,â said Whelan.\n\nNY1 got an exclusive look behind-the-scenes of the ballet, just a half-hour before some 2,000 New York City school children would be introduced to it. As the crew went through a pre-show checklist, director of production Marquerite Mehler was making sure everything works, including, of course, the star set piece, a massive Christmas tree.\n\nâThe tree, at the top of the show, is about 14 feet tall, thatâs what the audience first sees, and then during the show it grows into a majestic full-grown tree, it ends up being 40 feet tall,â said Mehler, who has been with the company for 28 years.\n\nTo make it snow inside the theater, there are three bags above the stage. The bags are full of what appears to the audience as snow, but is actually a different substance.\n\nâEach snow scene you have four people on each one of those bags, pulling the ropes and rocking the bag to let the snow fall,â Mehler said.\n\nBackstage, soloist dancer Ashley Hod rehearsed for her next appearance as the Sugar Plum Fairy. Her dance partner, Andrew Veyette, is also her husband. Hod performs in about 20 shows during the 49 performance run.\n\nâThere are a lot of different technical elements that come across very seamless and very romantic, but they are actually quite difficult to do and we have a lot of rehearsals to make sure everything goes smoothly in the performance,â said Hod, who grew up in nearby Great Neck, New York.\n\nItâs a ballet that, for both performers and the audience, is all about tradition.\n\nâThis ballet, even as an audience member, is passed down from generation to generation, and itâs beloved and itâs a warm experience, a connecting experience,â Whelan said."
