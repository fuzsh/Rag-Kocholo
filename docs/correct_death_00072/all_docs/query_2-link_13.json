        "text": "“I don’t have a past. I have a continuous present. The past is part of the present, just as the future is. We exist in time.”\n\n22 January 1904\n\nGeorgi Melitonovich Balanchivadze, son of a composer, is born in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\n1913\n\nBalanchivadze enrolls in the Imperial Theater Ballet School in St. Petersburg.\n\n1915\n\nBalanchivadze performs on stage for the first time, playing a cupid in Marius Petipa’s The Sleeping Beauty at the Mariinsky Theater, an experience he later credits with inspiring him to pursue a career in ballet.\n\n1920\n\nBalanchivadze creates his first choreography for student ballet concerts. He begins three years of piano and music theory at the Petrograd Conservatory of Music.\n\n1921\n\nBalanchivadze becomes a dancer at the State Theater of Opera and Ballet (formerly known as the Mariinsky Theater).\n\n1922\n\nBalanchivadze choreographs for the School’s graduation performances, dances at the State Theater, and organizes the Young Ballet, a small experimental company.\n\n1924\n\nBalanchivadze joins a touring troupe, Principal Dancers of the Soviet State Ballet. While performing in Germany, the troupe decides not to return to the Soviet Union. After an engagement in London, he travels to Paris to audition for Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes. Diaghilev hires him and changes Balanchivadze’s name to George Balanchine.\n\n1925 – 1927\n\nBalanchine choreographs ballets for the Opera de Monte-Carlo and the Ballets Russes including L’enfant et les Sortilèges, a reworking of Léonide Massine’s Le Chant du Rossignol, Barabau, La Pastorale, Jack in the Box, The Triumph of Neptune, and La Chatte.\n\n1928\n\nApollon Musagète (later named Apollo) with music by Igor Stravinsky\n\n1929\n\nProdigal Son with music by Sergei Prokofiev\n\nDiaghilev dies in Venice.
