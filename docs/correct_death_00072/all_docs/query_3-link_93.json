        "text": "Balanchine was much quoted. He had a typically Russian penchant for philosophizing and a verbal wit that, in his unpolished English, came off as folk wisdom. When he stopped his class to talk or when he gave an interview, he always had something to say that people remembered, and he left the impression that these rough-hewn nuggets of his were as spontaneous as they were abundant. (“By George Balanchine,” a booklet of quotations, was published in 1984, the year after he died.) He could be practical (“My muse must come to me on union time”), peremptory (“There are no mothers-in-law in ballet”), or cryptic (“I am not a man, but a cloud in trousers”). The one thing he did not care to be was original. Many of Balanchine’s most memorable sayings were quotations, produced from a storehouse of sources: Pushkin, Goethe, Shakespeare, the Bible, the Greek Fathers, Abraham Lincoln, Paul Valéry. The range gives some indication of Balanchine’s erudition, especially remarkable for a dancer. He was not a reader, like his good friends Stravinsky and Tchelitchev—his schedule did not leave much time for reading—but then he was not the kind of person who needed to read in order to absorb information. As a student in Petrograd before and just after the revolutions of 1917, he fed his curiosity on the richness of Russian culture and thrived on its assimilation of commonly disdained arts, such as dance, film, and the circus. Without this background and the subsequent involvement with the Monte Carlo-based Ballets Russes of Serge Diaghilev, not even a dancer of genius could have picked up as much as Balanchine already had by 1928, when, at the age of twenty-four, he choreographed “Apollo” for Diaghilev.\n\nBalanchine’s quotations were usually delivered to the best of his memory in his own words. Sometimes he varied the wording intentionally; at other times, he quoted verbatim. “A cloud in trousers” is straight from Mayakovsky:\n\nIf you really want\n\nI’ll be irreproachably sweet:\n\nnot a man but a cloud in trousers.\n\nBalanchine told Solomon Volkov, one of his biographers, that he used this line to impress girls—just what Mayakovsky said about it. But Balanchine would also refer to himself in interviews as a cloud in trousers, by which I think he meant that he was a ballet-maker, a creator of airy ephemera.\n\n“My muse must come to me on union time” is a variation on Tchaikovsky’s “My muse must come to me when I call her.” The motto of the poet Vyacheslav Ivanov, “A realibus ad realiora” (“From the real to the more real”), was revised by Balanchine to describe his job: “To make the beautiful more beautiful.” (Ivanov’s motto as it stands could also have been Balanchine’s.) His well-known advice to the mentally agitated dancer, “Don’t think, dear, do,” comes from Valéry’s poem “Ébauche d’un Serpent”: “Danse, cher corps. . . . Ne pense pas!” One of the most celebrated Balanchinisms, “God creates, man assembles,” is an adaptation of a saying attributed to Glinka, “Nations create music, composers only arrange it,” and it is a question whether Balanchine or Stravinsky said it first. The word “assemble” is a synonym for “compose,” which literally means “put together.” Balanchine was speaking not only for composers and choreographers but for all “creative” human beings. We put things together that already exist; we cannot create out of nothing—only God creates ex nihilo. It is the thought expressed in John 1:3: “Without Him was made nothing that has been made.”\n\nIn countless interviews, Balanchine deplored the tendency of some members of the audience to attach meanings to dance gesture, and he always used the same metaphor:\n\nWhen you have a garden full of pretty flowers, you don’t demand of them, “What do you mean? What is your significance?” Dancers are just flowers, and flowers grow without any literal meaning, they are just beautiful. We’re like flowers. A flower doesn’t tell you a story. It’s in itself a beautiful thing.\n\nThese statements were all loose renderings of the Acmeist manifesto, one of the prime documents of Russian symbolist poetry. The Acmeist poets rebelled against the previous generation’s use of prepackaged symbolism. Their case was forcefully put by Sergei Gorodetsky in the January, 1913, issue of the St. Petersburg arts journal Apollón: “For the Acmeists, a rose has again become beautiful in itself, for its petals, fragrance, and color, and not for its purported likeness to mystical love or something else.”\n\nIn the sixties, a critical line of attack on Balanchine was his supposed preference for dancers of one physical type, tall and long-legged, with small heads. Balanchine rejected the charge with a comparison of his company to a pipe organ: just as the different-sized pipes of the organ produce voices driven by the same wind, bodies of many different sizes and types dance in the same style. Here he undoubtedly had in mind Jakob BÖhme’s mystical image of God’s Creation as a pipe organ. (BÖhme, the seventeenth-century German theosophist, had an enormous impact on Russian literature and philosophy.)\n\nNaturally, Balanchine stole his jokes. Once, having to enter the women’s dressing room in a hurry, he burst in shouting, “Don’t look, I’m coming!”—a switch on Beatrice Lillie’s “Shut your eyes, boys, I’m coming through!” When I complimented him on his funny curtain speeches (toasting the late Igor Stravinsky: “In Russia, we drink the health of the guy that died”; accepting the Handel Medallion, “I can’t Handel it . . . so I’ll Haydn it”), he shrugged diffidently and said, “I tell Jewish jokes,” a laugh line if I ever heard one.\n\nBalanchine’s followers have taken to repeating his sayings as if they were “The Golden Verses of Pythagoras” (which some of them may well be), invariably incorporating the Master’s twitch, his twang, and his habit of starting sentences with “You know, dear . . .” Almost every line is Balanchine quoting someone else. This is not to say that he never had an original thought. “Ballet is Woman” is pure Balanchine. “There are no mothers-in-law in ballet” is his pronouncement upon relationships that cannot be expressed in dance terms; he called it “Balanchine’s Law.” One of his most publicized utterances, “See the music, hear the dance,” is arguably rightfully his, however platitudinous it may have become by the time he revived it. At least he was quoting a published response to his own choreography. Glenway Wescott, reviewing Bernard Taper’s “Balanchine” in the magazine Show (December, 1963), had written, “Suddenly I see the music; suddenly I hear the movements of the dancers.”\n\nAs an interviewee, Balanchine had his preferred subjects. His pet peeve in the theatre was the kind of emotionalism that aims at exciting false empathy in the spectator—the opposite of classical art. Even more did he detest the demand for it: “A lot of people go to the theatre to see their own life, their own experience. We don’t give them that in the ballet. We give them something less. When you see flowers, do you have any emotion? You’re moved by the color and the beauty—but what does it mean to be moved?” In his later, crankier interviews, he answered his own question. In whining tones, he would mock the spectator who goes to the theatre to cry over his own life: “I’m married, my wife and children have left me, and I’m unhappy and feel that I’m going to kill myself. And that’s what I think Art is—people should play for me my story.”\n\nFor this, his freest extrapolation from a quoted source, Balanchine actually named an author—Hegel. However, it’s not Hegel’s point about the sublimity of Greek tragedy that he wants to pass on, nor is it seriously a complaint about bathos in the theatre; it’s his own personal detestation of self-pity. (He sounds like someone proud of overcoming that weakness in himself.) No doubt his interviewer, Jonathan Cott, would have been treated to the same dramatic spiel had Balanchine cited, instead of Hegel, the elegantly succinct paraphrase of Hegel which Coleridge applied to French tragedy: “The soul is not stupefied into mere sensations by a worthless sympathy with our own ordinary sufferings.” Coleridge was no attributor of sources, either. On the other hand, Hegel was no aphorist. Balanchine, who was much more familiar with German than with English literature, might well have been pleased by what the English poet did to the long-winded German. He performed much the same kind of operation on “Swan Lake.” And he did it on principle.\n\nFor Balanchine, art was not something created de novo. The same with quotations. If Tchaikovsky summoning the Muse turned out to be quoting Pushkin, this only fortified Balanchine in his conviction that the search for an original inspiration is futile. Inspiration takes place in a kind of infinite regress. In “See the music, hear the dance,” he was quoting a contemporary voicing of an ancient idea. The earliest injunction to “hear the dance” is in the dialogues of the second-century Greek writer Lucian, and even then Lucian was quoting. (But he claimed that his source was the Delphic Oracle, beyond whose authority it is impossible to go.)\n\nThe sayings of Balanchine, the quotes within quotes and echoes upon echoes, were in line with one of his great themes as a choreographer, the legacy of classicism. Once a firebrand of the avant-garde, he returned to the classical tradition before he was out of his thirties. In later years, he waged a personal campaign against the twentieth-century fetish of originality. He subscribed to the Hegelian view of history as a spiral: everything recurs, but in a different form. Not only dance movement but all art, even the most novel-seeming, is a version of something that has already been said or done. For this reason, he saw no harm in appropriating; he stole and was stolen from—that was the way of art. As he told Volkov, “If you like something of someone else’s, why not take it? The important thing is that it seem natural and fit in.” With Stravinsky, he shared a firm belief in the labor of art as perpetual renovation: Stravinsky, who liked to quote Goethe—“Everything has been thought of before; the task is to think of it again.”\n\nTo think of it again: this is the specific task of the choreographer. It means imagining a nonexistent past, resummoning the energies of previous choreographers whose dances have decayed or disappeared from memory. Balanchine assigned himself to rethink Petipa, because Petipa represented the sum of theoretical knowledge up to the end of the nineteenth century. (One does not literally reconstruct the old dances; one reactivates the theory behind them.) Petipa, too, was more than a choreographer; he was a tradition. One of the great Balanchine statements is a definition of what tradition means to the artist. Seemingly distilled from his own experience, it could equally well be an idea that he inherited directly from his predecessors in ballet. It is in fact the idea of predecessors: “You must go through tradition, absorb it, and become in a way a reincarnation of all the artistic periods that have come before you.” I thought I recognized in this arresting quote a digest of T. S. Eliot’s “Tradition and the Individual Talent,” repeatedly cited by Lincoln Kirstein as a seminal influence on his work with Balanchine. In that classic essay, Eliot writes, “The historical sense compels a man to write not merely with his own generation in his bones, but with a feeling that the whole of the literature of Europe from Homer and within it the whole of the literature of his own country has a simultaneous existence and composes a simultaneous order.” As Balanchine used to say, “We all live in the same time forever. There is no future and there is no past.”\n\nAnd then, in Oliver Sacks’s book “Uncle Tungsten,” I came across a statement by the nineteenth-century Italian chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro that is an almost exact parallel to Balanchine’s: “It often happens that the mind of a person who is learning a new science has to pass through all the phases which the science itself has exhibited in its historical evolution.” Speaking as a dancer whose science was in his body, Balanchine added the word “reincarnation.”\n\nWell, we know that when Balanchine did pick up a book it was almost always popular science, the kind written by distinguished physicists such as Fred Hoyle and George Gamow. Still, the sense of déjà vu is unsettling. If Balanchine the artist was never as larcenous as Balanchine the sage, in his own mind he was always bringing the past to life, existing in the “simultaneous order” of art, teaching and choreographing every day in the company of Mozart and Tchaikovsky, Bach and Mendelssohn, Petipa and Saint-Léon. As a quotationist, he frequently succeeded in obliterating the “originator” of the quote, and in this, too, he had precedents. Julius Caesar’s words on crossing the Rubicon, “The die is cast,” were taken from a play by Menander, and the glorious closing line of the Divine Comedy, “The love that moves the sun and the other stars,” is by Dante out of Boethius from Aristotle. Mr. B.’s sense of reliving the past was analogous to his practice of quoting other men’s sayings or speaking their thoughts in his own words. He recycled verbal nuggets in the same spirit in which he revivified the art of ballet. ♦"
