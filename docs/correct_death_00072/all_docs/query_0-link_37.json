        "text": "Premiere Screenings Planned for Kennedy Center and Lincoln Center in September The Jerome Robbins Dance Division of The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts has restored and preserved the 1965 film of a historic performance of George Balanchine's three-act ballet Don Quixote and has edited the two-camera, uncut film into a complete, edited videotape version available for public viewing at the Library. The project was completed with the participation of Suzanne Farrell, the ballerina for whom the lead role of Dulcinea was created and who is currently the Artistic Director of The Suzanne Farrell Ballet at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The premiere screenings of the newly edited Don Quixote recording will take place September 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and September 18 at The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.\n\n\"This is a rare recording of the ballet and the only recording of George Balanchine, who was 61 years old at the time, performing as the Don. In addition, it showcases the then 19-year-old Suzanne Farrell in one of her first starring roles - a role created for her - and captures the poignant performance of Balanchine and Farrell dancing together. Therefore, it was imperative that the Library preserve the fragile film for future generations of researchers, scholars, and students,\" stated Jacqueline Z. Davis, the Barbara G. and Lawrence A. Fleischman Executive Director of The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.\n\nThe 16mm black-and-white film was recorded on May 27, 1965 at the New York City Ballet's preview gala at the New York State Theater. (The official premiere of Don Quixote was given the following night.) The performance was filmed with two cameras, an unusual occurrence at the time, by the acclaimed photographer and filmmaker Bert Stern of Libra Productions, but it was never edited. Don Quixote was part of the New York City Ballet's active repertoire from 1965 to 1978; it was not performed again until 2005 when Suzanne Farrell restaged it at the Kennedy Center for a combination of The Suzanne Farrell Ballet and The National Ballet of Canada.\n\n\"I want to especially thank Suzanne Farrell, without whom we could not have undertaken this project. Her commitment, knowledge, and sensitivity were essential,\" commented Michelle Potter, Curator of the Jerome Robbins Dance Division. \"Also, Jan Schmidt, Assistant Curator, and the staff of the Dance Division deserve recognition for their considerable work in bringing this project to completion.\"\n\nThe film was given by the New York City Ballet to the Dance Division�s Jerome Robbins Archive of the Recorded Moving Image, which houses thousands of films and videotapes to preserve the ephemeral art of dance. The five reels of the Don Quixote film were targeted as \"unique and in need of preservation.\" After funding was found, the staff arranged for the complicated process of restoration and editing. The film consisted of uncut footage from two cameras that recorded the entire ballet, without enhanced lighting or sound, from a wide angle by one camera and most of the ballet by a second camera in a closer angle.\n\n\"This newly restored film that The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts has overseen is extraordinary, both in its emotional content and its meaning and historical value for the dance community and the public at large,\" remarked Suzanne Farrell. \"With this film, the world has Mr. B alive and present again. Viewers have the opportunity to witness his genius, his art, and his integrity firsthand.\"\n\nProcess of Restoration and Editing\n\nThe restoration of the film was completed by the Library over the course of two years. The process involved cleaning and repairing the original film and generating a new negative. The film�s soundtrack was digitized and extensively restored, in part because of problems with the quality of the original recording. To complete the restoration of the picture and sound, Suzanne Farrell viewed the film and advised the Library on the precise synchronization of the image and music. Then a digital Betacam video master was made from the final film. The footage from the two cameras was edited together into a single videotape, again with the advice and guidance of Ms. Farrell, who worked closely with the editor, Fran�ois Bernadi. The optical restoration of the film was completed for the Library by Cineric, Inc., and the audio preservation was done by Universal Studios BluWave Audio.\n\nFrom September 20, 2007, all the footage - the five DVD discs, video transfers of the unedited restored film, and two edited DVD discs - can be watched on the Jerome Robbins Dance Division�s viewing carrels at The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center, 40 Lincoln Center Plaza. The Library�s new 45-hour, six-day per week schedule is: Monday and Thursday from 12 noon to 8 p.m.; Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nCast\n\nIn addition to George Balanchine as Don Quixote and Suzanne Farrell as Dulcinea, the cast includes Deni Lamont as Sancho Panza; Paul Sackett as Dead Poet; Conrad Ludlow as his Friend; Nicholas Magallanes as the Duke; Jillana as the Duchess; Michael Arshansky as Major Domo and Priest: Francisco Moncion as Merlin; Anthony Blum and Frank Ohman as Cavaliers; Karin von Aroldingen as Housekeeper; Patricia Neary, Conrad Ludlow, and Kent Stowell in the Danza della Caccia; Suki Schorer and John Prinz in the Pas de Deux Mauresque; Sara Leland, Kay Mazzo, Carol Sumner, Frank Ohman, Robert Rodham, and Earle Sieveling in Courante Sicilienne; Gloria Govrin and Arthur Mitchell in Rigaudon Flamenco; Patricia McBride and Colleen Neary in Ritornel; Mimi Paul, Marnee Morris, and Anthony Blum in Variations; and Gloria Govrin as Night Spirit. Judith Fugate and Jean-Pierre Frohlich, children at the time, also danced.\n\nPremiere Screenings\n\nThe edited recording of Don Quixote will be screened in Washington, D.C., as part of the Kennedy Center Prelude Festival on September 5 at 6 p.m. in the Terrace Theater. The New York premiere will be given on September 18 at 6 p.m. in the Bruno Walter Auditorium of The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. A limited number of free seats will be available for both screenings.

Funding for the preservation of the film was provided by the National Film Preservation Foundation Partnership Grant with the laboratories Cineric, Inc. and Universal Studios BluWave Audio. Additional laboratory work was provided by Trackwise of Full House Productions. Other funding for the film preservation and for the editing of the videotape was provided by The Louis B. Mayer Foundation and The Jerome Robbins Foundation.\n\nAbout The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts\n\nThe New York Public Library for the Performing Arts houses the world's most extensive combination of circulating, reference, and rare archival collections in its field.
