        "text": "STRIKING A BALANCE: The late choreographer George Balanchine didn’t just provide a point of reference for the new capsule collection that debuted Monday morning from the New York City Ballet and Reformation. Union members in the New York City Ballet’s orchestra have been wearing T-shirts imprinted with one of his quotes — “See the music, hear the dance” — at rallies regarding contract negotiations.\n\nBalanchine’s “Jewels” inspired the 19-piece Ref x NYCB collection that is geared for the off-duty ballerina or those pretending to be ones. Balanchine, the founder of the New York City and the son of a Russian composer, died in 1987 at the age of 79.\n\nWhile Reformation chose a combination of rich jewel tones and staple ballet-core shades for the collaboration that incorporates deadstock, the 802 union members of the orchestra have been sporting black T-shirts to get their message across. They also wear ones carrying the message of “Fair Contract.” Last month, a few special performances, where the orchestra was raised at one point for the audience to see them more fully, were nixed since union members had sported the T-shirts.\n\nUnion members continue to wear the T-shirts for rallies and performances, according to Local 802 AFM president Sara Cutler. Meanwhile, the ballet corps’ Ava Sautter, India Bradley and Kennedy Targosz are fronting the new campaign for the Reformation initiative.\n\nThe next rally is slated for Wednesday outside of Lincoln Center to coincide with the New York City Ballet’s 75th anniversary celebration, according to Cutler. Union members hand out any extra T-shirts to passersby, should they ask. (The limited-run x NYCB capsule retails from $98 to $348.) The orchestra’s 67-person bargaining unit is not sharing details about either side’s demands, Cutler said.\n\nNoting that the Local 802 AFM union is not on strike, Cutler said, “We are playing and talking and staging rallies — not pickets — to get our message out to the public. No other programs have been canceled so far due to the orchestra’s shirt-wearing.” With talks scheduled for next week, Cutler said, “We are still hopeful that the company will move off its current position, which doesn’t address our wage and health insurance needs.”\n\nA New York City Ballet spokesperson had not acknowledged requests for comment Monday."
