        "text": "Back in the days when George Balanchine was alive, and for some years after his death (in 1983), most programs at the New York City Ballet were made up of three or four repertory works because full-length ballets were few. The company didn’t just put out one program performed four days in a row or for a week. The mix was constant and incredible. Figuring out that seasonal mix was a huge and difficult puzzle, but the variety kept the dancers, the theater, energized. The company’s Fall 2023 season of all-Balanchine programs, five of them, is reminiscent of that time and the offerings are fabulous. Check them out on the N.Y.C.B. site. Program IV is super concentrated: Concerto Barocco, Prodigal Son, Symphony in C. So is Program V: Serenade, Orpheus, Theme and Variations. But you can’t miss with any of the programs. This year’s Fall Fashion Gala is October 5. —Laura Jacobs"
