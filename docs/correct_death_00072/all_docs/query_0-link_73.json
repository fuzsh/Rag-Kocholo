I mean, what am I gonna say? 'Excuse me, please. I have to go off stage and fix my shoe?' she said. \"Yeah, no, you do what you have to do.\"\n\nDoering said the applause from the audience on that first night was \"thunderous.\"\n\nThe first performance was borne out of the creative genius of renowned choreographer and company co-founder George Balanchine.\n\nThe company's first female associate artistic director, Wendy Whelan, a former principal dancer, now helps decide what's performed.\n\n\"Balanchine would commission female choreographers, always a little bit,\" she told CBS News. \"Now we have a full-on commitment to it. But especially to diverse women. That's very, very important to me.\"\n\nThe company today is one of the world's most prestigious.\n\n\"Nobody knew it was gonna be this great company,\" Doering said. \"It's wonderful.\""
