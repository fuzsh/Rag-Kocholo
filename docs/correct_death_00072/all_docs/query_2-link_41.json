        "text": "SIX WAYS OF LOOKING AT THE NEW YORK CITY BALLET\n\nI:BACKWARD\n\nOctober 11, 1998, was the 50th anniversary of the New York City Ballet. But anniversaries can be misleading. The reality is that in the beginning was George Balanchine—many of his greatest works were made before City Ballet existed—and long after this anniversary is forgotten, City Ballet will still be Balanchine. It has had other choreographers—Jerome Robbins incontestably the most important—and it continues to present talented new dancers as they emerge from the affiliated School of American Ballet; in other words, it has a life of its own. But, 15 years after Balanchine’s death, it hasn’t as yet found a convincing new guiding principle beyond the perpetuation of his work and example—not, wisely, that it has really tried to.\n\nHow did it happen that the world’s greatest ballet company—which is what it has seemed to me and to many others almost from the start—established itself 50 years ago in New York, hardly then the “dance capital of the world,” as it came to be known decades later? The circumstances were not only peculiar but unlikely, depending as they did on the near-chance meeting of two young men of different nationalities, backgrounds, and temperaments.\n\nThe American was Lincoln Kirstein, the brilliant son of one of the owners of Filene’s department store in Boston. In 1927, while still an undergraduate at Harvard, he co-founded and edited an influential literary magazine, Hound & Horn, which published Pound, Eliot, and Hart Crane, and printed Kirstein’s own tribute to the great Russian impresario Serge Diaghilev, whose funeral in Venice, by an eerie coincidence, he was to stumble upon in 1929. He had also helped found the Harvard Society for Contemporary Art, a forerunner of New York’s Museum of Modern Art. When he realized that he was not equipped to be a dancer, Kirstein determined to emulate Diaghilev, and by the time he was 26 years old he had formulated his plan to find and bring to America a great choreographer to launch an American classical-ballet company.\n\nIn 1933, in Europe, where he had been working with Romola Nijinsky on her biography of her husband, he was advised by the composer Virgil Thomson, among others, to concentrate on Balanchine, and he cornered him, famously, in a mutual friend’s kitchen in London. “Balanchine seemed intense, concentrated, disinterested,” Kirstein wrote in his diary, “not desperate, exactly, but without any hope.” But Balanchine did remark that American students “have spirit and can be touched into fire.” Within the week, the diary reports, “Balanchine says America has always been his dream, even before he left Russia; he is now willing to risk everything for it.” Kirstein waited in suspense for several weeks before Balanchine agreed to come and take the risk.\n\nLincoln Kirstein was a rich intellectual from New England. George Balanchine was a homeless exile from Russia, who by the age of 29 had undergone privation and suffered serious illness, and who had no immediate prospects after the quick collapse of his Les Ballets 1933, which had been funded by a rich socialite who lacked Kirstein’s high sense of purpose. Ballet, which had been imported from Western Europe to the Russia of the czars in the mid—19th century, had just before World War I begun to swing back to the West, through Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes and the eternal touring of the iconic Anna Pavlova. In the chaos of post-revolutionary Russia, it was only natural that an immensely talented anti-Establishment (and anti-Communist) dancer-choreographer like Balanchine, artistically frustrated as well as close to starvation, should make his way westward.\n\nIn 1924, as part of a small touring group called the Soviet State Dancers, which included his then wife, Tamara Geva, and his future “unofficial wife,” the great ballerina Alexandra Danilova (she is generally included in the list of his wives), the 20-year-old Balanchine defected. Their situation became known to Diaghilev, and he summoned them to an audition and hired them all. Within a year, he had made Balanchine his chief choreographer, and it was under Diaghilev that Balanchine created his first two masterpieces—Apollo, in 1928, and Prodigal Son, a year later. The first of these, with its ravishing Stravinsky score and its astonishing new vision of neoclassicism, is perhaps the key ballet of the 20th century. Even apart from its immense merits, Apollo has a special and profound resonance for all who love dance, for it is an homage to dance itself: the newborn Apollo chooses as his partner the muse of dance, Terpsichore, rather than Calliope, muse of poetry, or Polyhymnia, muse of mime.\n\nA year after Apollo, Diaghilev suddenly died, and his associates were scattered around the dance world in an unhappy diaspora. Balanchine became ill with tuberculosis and spent months undergoing a cure in the French Alps—he was left with only one functioning lung and a lifelong sense that he was living on borrowed time. (He once told a colleague, “You know, I am really a dead man.”) He was also without a job. For three years he wandered from Paris to London to Copenhagen to Monte Carlo, making ballets as opportunities arose. (In London, his “16 Delightful Balanchine Girls 16” performed their “popular” pieces in a variety show at the Coliseum.) When Kirstein approached him out of the blue it must have seemed both a lifeline and a fantasy come true. And the two men made a very odd couple; even 50 years later, they were not really comfortable with each other—the physically massive Kirstein all force, psychic and emotional eruption, his Dionysian mind off and racing in a hundred different directions; the slight, elegant Balanchine reserved, harmonious—Apollonian. But each of them must have sensed in the other the only possible route to what he hoped to achieve, and for the rest of their lives they accommodated each other loyally and profitably.\n\nOf course, when Kirstein had cornered Balanchine in that kitchen, there was no institution in place for the latter to come to, but Kirstein rarely acknowledged such minor obstacles; he tapped the financial resources of some of his wealthy friends, and the first Balanchine-Kirstein collaboration, the School of American Ballet, was born on Madison Avenue and 59th Street in a studio that once belonged to Isadora Duncan. Just as Kirstein had envisaged, Balanchine arrived, began to train dancers to his specifications, and by June 1934 had created his first American masterpiece, Serenade, made on student dancers with meager training, yet a profoundly moving statement of romantic love and loss.\n\nThe next dozen years could hardly have looked to anyone but Kirstein like a firm foundation for everything that he and Balanchine hoped to accomplish. Until America’s entry into World War II, in which he was to serve with distinction, Kirstein kept putting together small dance groups for Balanchine, the last of which, American Ballet Caravan, came into being when he persuaded his friend Nelson Rockefeller, then at the State Department, to send a troupe to South America on a cultural goodwill tour. By this time—1941—Balanchine had trained his first important American ballerina, a phenomenally strong classicist named Marie-Jeanne, on whom he now quickly created two of his greatest works: the neoclassical Concerto Barocco, to Bach, and the more traditional Ballet Imperial (later renamed Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2). Then he was back to choreographing Broadway musicals (four Rodgers and Hart shows before the war—On Your Toes, for his first wife, Tamara Geva; Babes in Arms; I Married an Angel, for wife No. 3, Vera Zorina; and The Boys from Syracuse—and Cabin in the Sky and others during and after it) and sporadically working with the latest incarnation of the Ballet Russe. During the 30s he had been to Hollywood for Zorina’s numbers in The Goldwyn Follies and On Your Toes, and, with Kirstein, had failed in an attempt to provide the Metropolitan Opera with a serious resident dance company. In other words, he had been everywhere and nowhere—rarely in a position to mount new ballets. More than 15 years after Diaghilev’s death, he was still a man without a company.\n\nFrom the end of 1941 through 1945, the war put everything on hold, and Balanchine made no major work. It must have been hard for him, but as always he was patient; one thing he and Kirstein shared was the long view. And then, suddenly, things changed. For the recently founded Ballet Theatre (later ABT) he choreographed Theme and Variations; for the Paris Opéra Ballet, Symphony in C (called there Le Palais de Cristal); for the Ballet Russe, La Sonnambula (wife No. 2, Danilova); and, most significant, for a new Kirstein company, The Four Temperaments and Orpheus. The new company was called Ballet Society, its sporadic performances were to be seen only by subscription, and it had no permanent theater—The Four Temperaments, Balanchine’s most “modern” work to date, had its 1946 premiere on the notoriously shallow stage of Manhattan’s Central High School of Needle Trades. In the spring of 1948, Ballet Society was performing at the New York City Center, a onetime Shriners’ temple on West 55th Street, which the city had taken over in lieu of unpaid taxes. The man in charge, Morton Baum, was so bowled over by Orpheus, the new Stravinsky-Balanchine-Noguchi collaboration, that he invited the company to change its name and to make City Center its official home. When the newly christened New York City Ballet returned to the theater that October, it was simply Ballet Society with a new name and a permanent address.\n\nYet time would show that the new name and guaranteed residence were crucial. From the beginning of his American venture, Balanchine’s ambition had been to develop classical ballet here, and New York in the 30s and 40s was the heart of his America. The city’s energy was both a reflection of his ideas about what American ballet should be and a stimulus to them. Equally important, it was New York’s audience that he needed to educate and win over if these ideas were to prevail. After 15 years in this country, he was ready to be the New York City Ballet; it was the right name at the right moment. And as for having a real home at last—24 years after leaving Russia—it offered him what he had never had before: continuity. Beginning in 1948, every important work of Balanchine’s was made for the New York City Ballet. At the age of 44, he could begin to consolidate his lifework.\n\nII:THROUGH TRIUMPH\n\nIn the 1940s, it was still the Russian ballet that meant classical dance to most American audiences—in particular, the works of Mikhail Fokine (Les Sylphides, Petrouchka, Spectre de la Rose, Firebird) and Léonide Massine (Gaîté Parisienne, Boutique Fantasque). Above all, it was Russian dancers. After all, it had been the legends of Nijinsky and Pavlova that first drew 20th-century Americans to ballet. The Ballet Russe had crisscrossed the country with such stars as Danilova and the famous “baby ballerinas” whom Balanchine had discovered early in the 1930s: Baronova, Toumanova, and Riabouchinska—they had been 12, 13, and 14 years old at the time. And Ballet Theatre featured the Russian-sounding Alicia Markova (née Marks) as well as the baby ballerinas grown up, the Cuban Alicia Alonso, and an assortment of Russian males. In contrast, Balanchine’s company, with the exception of the virtuoso André Eglevsky, was from the start decisively American, and deliberately so. He wanted American dancers, performing in a style he thought appropriate to American physiques and American energy.\n\nIt would take many years before most of the New York dance audience accepted these dancers and their repertory as the equal of what Europe could bring us. The New York Times critic, John Martin, consistently condemned Balanchine ballets as cold and plotless. City Ballet was seen as existing off in its own rarefied niche—“caviar to the general.” But in 1949 two events took place that signaled a major change. One was the arrival in America of the Sadler’s Wells (now Royal) Ballet from England—and in particular the personal triumph of Margot Fonteyn in The Sleeping Beauty, the masterpiece of classicism created in 1890 by Tchaikovsky and Marius Petipa, the French-Russian ballet master who was Balanchine’s lifelong inspiration. (“You discover that what stays with you are the essential things,” he said. “You discover what you are doing is really Petipa.”) The other was City Ballet’s first bona fide hit, Balanchine’s reworking of the Stravinsky-Fokine Firebird, with which Diaghilev and his Ballets Russes had electrified Paris in 1910.\n\nAcquiring (for $4,250) the enchanting Chagall sets of 1945 from the impresario Sol Hurok, Balanchine speeded up the action, created new material, and—most important—unleashed a genuine star performance that thrilled critics and audiences. It was his fourth wife, Maria Tallchief, with her exotic Native American background and looks, her formidable technique, and her superb musicality, who carried the ballet, making Firebird a box-office hit, no small matter to a new and struggling ballet enterprise. With Firebird, the New York City Ballet rounded a corner, and between it and the success of the British, New York was in a ferment of excitement about dance.\n\nAnd then in 1954 came The Nutcracker, which for more than 40 years now has filled the theater for weeks every Christmastime. It cost $80,000—twice what was budgeted—but the money was found. And Balanchine got the crucial effect he was after—the wonderful tree that magically grows higher and higher until it towers over the stage as the first act’s happy Christmas party turns into the mysterious dreamworld of the sleeping Marie. (Stage effects like this, which he remembered from his childhood at the Maryinsky Theater in St. Petersburg—where he himself had danced the little Nutcracker prince—were essential to Balanchine’s vision; I remember his patiently explaining to me that he wouldn’t stage The Sleeping Beauty because the State Theater couldn’t accommodate the special effects he thought were essential to it. As far back as the early 1950s he was telling Richard Buckle, the English ballet critic and his future biographer, “These theatres just don’t have the machinery or the designers for big spectacles. In Russia we used to have a whole regiment lying under a painted canvas to make the sea go in waves.”) The Nutcracker has proved to be more than an annual box-office bonanza; in the tens of thousands of children whose first ballet it was, City Ballet has found much of its future audience.\n\nIn 1957 came Agon, the greatest of the Balanchine-Stravinsky collaborations after Apollo. Firebird had been a star vehicle going back to Diaghilev, Nutcracker a 19th-century classic reinvented and recharged. Agon seemed to carry ballet forward into utterly uncharted territory. It took classical dance steps to a new and daunting level—and in addition presented the shock (remember, this was 1957) of pairing the glamorous, pale Diana Adams with Arthur Mitchell, the handsome black dancer who was to go on to found the Dance Theatre of Harlem. Audiences and critics were stunned by the daring innovations in the movement and the daring effect of the casting.\n\nUnlike some revolutionary works of art, Agon was appreciated from the start. The dance critic Edwin Denby writes of the enormous impact on the opening-night audience: “The balcony stood up shouting and whistling when the choreographer took his bow. Downstairs, people came out into the lobby, their eyes bright as if the piece had been champagne. Marcel Duchamp, the painter, said he felt the way he had after the opening of Le Sacre.” (This was the occasion of the infamous riot in 1913 that attended the premiere of the Stravinsky-Nijinsky Sacre du Printemps.) It was Agon that hammered home to many in the dance world that Balanchine was indeed a supreme master—that he could do anything. It seemed to cap his already amazing fecundity as a choreographer—except that there were 25 years of choreography to come.\n\nSeven years after Agon came another kind of triumph. Kirstein had been instrumental-working again with his old friend Nelson Rockefeller—in bringing about the creation of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, and an essential element of the plan was the New York State Theater, designed to Balanchine’s specifications by Philip Johnson. The theater at first seemed glitzy, fakey—a far cry from the modest, homey atmosphere of the City Center. But its advantages soon became clear. There was room for the dancers in the wings; in the old theater, they had been practically crashing into the walls as they leapt offstage. And the new stage was really big—so big that many of the old ballets had to be restaged, opened up. Gone were the days when in the finale of Symphony in C all the dancers couldn’t be crowded onto the stage and edged off into the wings. The State Theater made possible the big, spectacular works of the 60s and 70s—Jewels, Don Quixote, Union Jack, Vienna Waltzes. And in its promenade lobby upstairs, it gave audiences what I believe to be the most capacious public space in any theater in New York, perhaps in the world. With its huge open area, the audacious giant white Elie Nadelman statues at either end, and the balcony that extends the promenade out over the plaza, the State Theater became a vast gathering place for New York ballet- and operagoers—its space, if not its décor, truly imperial. And eventually it became home.\n\nA series of major works flowed from Balanchine during the Lincoln Center years, but the biggest hit of all came from Jerome Robbins in 1969—Dances at a Gathering. This remarkable work—an hour long and comprising a series of solos, duets, trios, and ensemble pieces performed by five men and five women to Chopin piano music—not only was an immediate crowd pleaser but proved to be a permanent blessing to the repertory. It was also a personal triumph for Robbins, returning from his tremendous career on Broadway—The King and I, West Side Story, Fiddler on the Roof—to classical ballet not as a prodigal son (a role he had performed for Balanchine magnificently in the early 50s) but as a true partner.\n\nRobbins at a very young age had established himself at Ballet Theatre with Fancy Free, his explosively joyous account of three sailors on leave in wartime New York, subsequently expanded into the musical On the Town, and later he had joined City Ballet, where he produced a series of hits that have lasted—Afternoon of a Faun, The Concert, and The Cage, a harrowing drama in which an insect queen proves far deadlier than the male. Robbins might not always have been easy to work with—his methods were notoriously taxing, unlike Balanchine’s easy adaptions to a performer’s strengths and weaknesses—but his ballets happily supplemented and complemented Balanchine’s, giving City Ballet the unique luxury of having two major choreographers in residence. (Robbins went on making dances for City Ballet until his death earlier this year.)\n\nFinally, in 1972 came the Stravinsky Festival, to mark the first anniversary of the composer’s death and what would have been his 90th birthday. Stravinsky was unquestionably the leading musical influence on Balanchine, the man he most admired and wished to please. “Mr. Stravinsky provides me with wonderful time, and I like to swim in it. . . . He was like Einstein—nobody like him.” To celebrate the Master, then, he decided to devote a weeklong festival to him—presenting not only the old ballets but a slate of new pieces, to be made by himself, Robbins, his longtime associate John Taras, and other resident choreographers. Ignoring the extra cost ($130,000), he closed the theater for a week of rehearsals—there was no other way to prepare some 30 ballets in so short a time. (Kirstein compared the rehearsal period to “a miniature Normandy landing.”) The effect on both the repertory and Balanchine’s reputation was permanent. If any one event canonized him as the greatest choreographer of the century, an artist of utterly extraordinary reach and grasp, it was the Stravinsky Festival. In its wake Richard Poirier was to write in The Atlantic Monthly, “In the history of ballet, Balanchine at New York’s State Theater is equivalent to Shakespeare at London’s Globe.” I suspect that even in his own mind it was the culminating event of an artistic lifetime.\n\nSince 1972 there have been new ballets, new festivals, new hits, but no further defining moments. Perhaps they were no longer needed. The company was firmly established at the apex of American cultural life and was admired throughout the world. It had taken 25 years.\n\nIII:THROUGH ADVERSITY\n\nFor those close to the New York City Ballet, the history of the company is a long-running family saga. Much of the drama came from watching individual dancers develop under Balanchine’s guidance, the result of his uncanny ability to nurture talent to fruition, except when human nature—or calamity—got in the way. It was those eruptions of calamity and rampant human nature that provided the other kind of drama, which ranged from gossip to tragedy. And because Balanchine’s family over the years became our family, these events seemed personal to us in the audience, not simply news from the outside world.\n\nBalanchine’s early life had been filled with adversity. It cannot have been easy to have been installed in the Imperial Theatre Ballet School at the age of 9—and, in fact, he ran away from the school shortly after arriving. (He was there only by accident, anyway: he had been destined for a naval career, but his mother happened to take him along while his sister auditioned and he was asked to audition as well.) He had faced semi-starvation in post-revolutionary Petrograd and near-fatal tuberculosis. And he was emotionally vulnerable—when in 1945 his third wife, the beautiful Vera Zorina, left him, he was distraught; one friend from that time remembers him weeping uncontrollably, day after day. But these tribulations were behind him by the time the New York City Ballet was born. Its early years lacked financial stability, but this was a time of expansion, excitement, and fulfillment.\n\nDisaster struck in 1956. His last wife—the young, beautiful, witty ballerina Tanaquil LeClercq—contracted polio while the company was performing in Copenhagen. (She was to remain paralyzed from the waist down.) That so uniquely gifted and charming a person was so afflicted was terrible enough; that she was Balanchine’s wife, a dancer central to the repertory and on whom he had created many important roles (the most famous being the doomed girl who dances with Death in La Valse), was a devastating blow to the entire enterprise and to its followers. Balanchine stayed with his wife in Denmark until she was well enough to be brought home, and didn’t return to the company on a regular basis for a year—a time of grief and uncertainty for everyone. (He felt irrationally guilty because when “Tanny” had been a girl of 15 he had featured her in a short ballet for a March of Dimes benefit in which a grim figure in black came forward and struck her down with polio, prefiguring her personal fate.) The violinist Nathan Milstein, who saw the Balanchines frequently during this sad time, described him as having been “husband, father, physician, nursemaid” to his stricken wife.\n\nLeClercq’s story can be seen only as tragedy, but every ballerina’s story is some kind of drama, if only because, earlier or later, the dancing must stop—usually long before the will to dance is gone. And the drama of Balanchine and his ballerinas was particularly intense, because the relationships were generally so strong, involving art, collaboration, career, and, often, love and marriage. One can consider his entire life and art as a search for the ideal woman (who would also, by definition, be the ideal dancer—that is, the dancer on whom and with whom he could realize his greatest creative ambitions).\n\nPerhaps the first dancer on whom he was obsessively focused was the “black pearl,” Tamara Toumanova, the glamorous “baby ballerina” he had discovered in 1931. He had wanted to marry her, but the notorious Mama Toumanova decided that Tamara was too young. (Translation: Balanchine had no company of his own at that time and was decidedly lower on the ballet totem pole than such choreographers as Massine and Serge Lifar.)\n\nAn entire procession of ballerinas was eventually to reject him, either romantically or professionally, among them Marie-Jeanne, Zorina, Diana Adams, and Tallchief; all of them went on to marry other men and have children—something Balanchine was out-spokenly reluctant to do. His relationship with the young dancer he focused on in the mid-50s was atypical—but so was she. The exquisite, gifted, and whimsical Allegra Kent inspired him to create or revive a series of roles in which she remained the innocent object of desire—whatever passions she evoked in others, Kent herself always emerged untouched. Her career was the oddest of any of Balanchine’s ballerinas. She was an instrument in his hands, she resisted his authority; she was physically perfect, she was overweight; she had a child (with her husband, the photographer Bert Stern) and came back to dance; another child, another return; a third child, a third return. For 30 years she came and went—always treasured, even indulged, by Balanchine. She was the prodigal daughter. And for us in the audience who loved her, “Will Allegra dance?” became a drama of its own.\n\nBut what Balanchine wanted most, and had never had, was a muse who would always dance—his personal Terpsichore. She was to arrive at the School of American Ballet in 1960—no doubt the deeply religious Balanchine would have said she had been sent by God—and her art, her person, and her career were to transform and convulse the New York City Ballet.\n\nShe came from Cincinnati, and her name was Roberta Sue Ficker, soon to be changed to Suzanne Farrell. Diana Adams, touring the country in a talent search funded by the Ford Foundation, had discovered her and suggested that she audition for Mr. B. Awarded a full scholarship at the school, she was soon in the company and very quickly the object of Balanchine’s interest. She was beautiful, and she was talented, but she also had a profound musicality and a powerful dance intelligence. From the start it was clear that she would try anything, do anything, be anything that he required. “If he thought I could do something, I would believe him,” she wrote in her 1990 autobiography, Holding on to the Air, “often against my own reasoning. I trusted him not to let me be a fool, but rather a tool, an instrument in his hands. In short, I trusted him with my life.” And again: “To offer less rather than more was not a possibility for me; it was death.” Here, finally, was the dancer whose commitment was as passionate and total as his own. Violette Verdy, the most analytical of City Ballet’s ballerinas, has said, “I think that the person who has come closest to surrendering to Balanchine is Suzanne Farrell. She has managed that kind of wonderful surrender that is also a glorification of the self. . . . Sometimes I see pure Balanchine when I watch her.”\n\nEverything conspired to advance her progress. In 1963 a new ballet—Movements for Piano and Orchestra—was, being rehearsed by Adams and the company’s leading male dancer, Jacques d’Amboise, to a new score by Stravinsky. Adams became pregnant and had to withdraw, and at the urging of d’Amboise, the role was entrusted to Farrell, not yet 18 years old and still in the corps de ballet. Adams and d’Amboise taught it to her in Adams’s living room with no music, and within days Farrell was demonstrating it to Balanchine and Stravinsky at a rehearsal for which she was late because of an algebra exam at school!\n\nFarrell triumphed in Movements, and soon afterward Balanchine made his first ballet specifically for her—Meditation, a highly emotional duet in which an older man (d’Amboise again) conjures up in memory a young woman he has loved. So explicit a statement of love for such a newcomer could not go unnoticed, and soon what everyone suspected was confirmed: Balanchine had completely surrendered to Farrell’s powers. If further proof were needed, it came two years later with his three-act ballet Don Quixote. The old, befuddled, yet noble Don is inspired, cared for, tantalized by his servant Dulcinea—a symbol of both purity and sensuality. At the first performance, Balanchine himself played Don Quixote, and it was clear that he was dancing not only with Farrell but for her. This was both a coronation (he called her an “alabaster princess”) and a declaration of personal worship.\n\np>Offstage the intensity of his feelings was made equally clear. Company class was dominated by whatever aspect of her technique he thought needed working on. He stood in the wings of the theater every night watching her, and when the ballet she was performing in was over, he would leave the theater with her, ignoring the dances and dancers who followed. She was cast in every major role, old and new, she could conceivably dance. Naturally there was resentment of her special position, both from established ballerinas and from other young girls hoping to draw Mr. B.’s attention, and a combination of Balanchine’s possessiveness and obsessiveness and Farrell’s natural reserve isolated her from the rest of the company. Several senior dancers left, making their reasons very clear: when Patricia Neary quit, Balanchine said to her, “I have a right to love.” “You should love all eighty of us” was her answer. Maria Tallchief, for a dozen years the unproclaimed prima ballerina of City Ballet, famously remarked, “I don’t mind being listed alphabetically, but I do mind being treated alphabetically.” Balanchine was unmoved. Not only was Farrell his alabaster princess, she was his “pussycat-fish”—though not just any cat or any fish, Farrell has explained. The cat was a cheetah, for speed; the fish was a dolphin, for intelligence. After a performance of Don Quixote one night, he told Richard Buckle, “I have seen every dancer, and there has never been one like her. She can do everything.”\n\nTheir personal relationship intensified. They were together constantly, with the approval of Farrell’s mother, who, unlike Mama Toumanova, had encouraged the relationship from the start. But Balanchine’s passion for Farrell and her love for him were apparently not physically consummated. He was still married to LeClercq, and Farrell was a devout Catholic. But he also was 41 years older than she—despite his vigor and charm, an alarmingly older man. Perhaps she felt that she was not only an alabaster princess but a captive one. For whatever combination of reasons, his longing for her grew, and her resistance persisted.\n\nOf all the relationships with unattainable women whom he idealized and could not, finally, possess, this was the most significant and the most tragic—significant because so much was at stake artistically, tragic because now he must have felt he was being rejected as an old man. Farrell rationalizes the situation this way: “Balanchine needed to choreograph to live, just as I needed to dance to live. Neither of us needed to be married to live.” When she fell in love with a young dancer in the company, Paul Mejia, and married him, the situation grew intolerable. Balanchine, in his anguish, took roles away from Mejia, and Farrell stood by her husband. One night when he was denied a role he had previously danced, Farrell sent Balanchine an ultimatum: if Paul didn’t dance that night, they would both resign. Balanchine ignored her warning, removed her too from the program, and Farrell was gone from the company. On every level this was a deep trauma—for her, for Balanchine, and for the New York City Ballet as a whole, which for the past half-dozen years had been dominated by her presence.\n\nThat was in 1969, and the next few years were to be a period of artistic and personal desolation for Balanchine. The ballerina ranks were thin—older dancers were either gone or no longer at their peak, younger ones not fully developed. To a great extent the company was sustained during these years by a dancer completely opposite to Farrell in look and temperament, the lyrical and ebullient Patricia McBride, not mysterious and grand but the epitome of the normal, all-American girl. She was small, very pretty, energetic, and alluring, and as useful to Robbins as to Balanchine. (She had been given the central woman’s role in Dances at a Gathering, which, ironically, premiered the very night Farrell left the company.) Balanchine’s first major work after Farrell’s departure—Who Cares?, to Gershwin songs—featured McBride triumphantly. (She had already formed a thrilling partnership with the equally talented and ebullient Edward Villella.) Patty McBride, more than any other dancer in the company’s history, had the art of pleasing the audience—they just loved her, and rightly so. Her happy and apparently uncomplicated nature, revealed in her clear yet expressive dancing, was the perfect antidote for a traumatized company and a disoriented audience.\n\nThe other superbly gifted dancer who emerged during this difficult time was Gelsey Kirkland, whose youth and apparent delicacy belied her steely technique and troubled nature. I remember watching her at a rehearsal for Coppélia (she was second-cast, behind McBride) and sensing her avidity as Mr. B. and Danilova—famous for her own performances of Coppélia with the Ballet Russe—worked with McBride. Soon she was gone, to dance with Baryshnikov at American Ballet Theatre and eventually to self-destruct. (In her notorious autobiography, Dancing on My Grave, she blames Balanchine for much of what befell her—the only ballerina I can think of who has expressed anything other than awe and love for him.) With Farrell out of the company, Balanchine had to focus on relative newcomers, and the two he chose to develop—Kay Mazzo and Karin von Aroldingen—were to serve him honorably and faithfully for many years. Indeed, with the German von Aroldingen he was to enjoy the last meaningful relationship of his life—a kind of domestic and comfortable romance, as he became attached not only to her but also to her family. He made outstanding roles for both women, and today Mazzo is co-chairman (with Peter Martins) of faculty at the School of American Ballet, while von Aroldingen (who inherited the rights to a number of his works) stages ballets and helps run the George Balanchine Trust.\n\nMore than five years passed while Balanchine recovered himself and Farrell remained in exile, mostly working with the Maurice Béjart company in Brussels. Loyal Farrellites exposed themselves to the Béjart repertory for her sake, and she was beautiful in it. But she wasn’t doing what she was born to do, and no one knew that better than she did—unless it was Balanchine. In the summer of 1974 she wrote to him: “Dear George, As wonderful as it is to see your ballets, it is even more wonderful to dance them. Is this impossible? Love, Suzi.” In January 1975 she (though not her husband, Paul) was back where she belonged. The personal relationship was never again what it had been, but the artistic partnership resumed, and once again Balanchine was deploying her genius to help fulfill his own. This he continued to do until the end, culminating with his final masterpiece, Mozartiana, in 1981. Farrell was later to write, “It was because this ballet existed that I could survive the death of the man who made it.”\n\nFarrell’s return to City Ballet changed everything, just as her original domination of it had, and her departure had as well. She was dancing with greater depth and beauty than ever before. It was easy to speculate that exile and hardship had matured her, but perhaps it was being on her own, without Balanchine, that did it—or perhaps she was simply growing, as a person and as an artist; after all, she had been only 23 when she left the company. I was with Kirstein at one of her first return performances and blurted out to him how moved I was to see Suzanne dancing so wonderfully. In his usual unsentimental and prescient way, he muttered, “It means the next five years are secure.” But the ultimate word on the Farrell story was spoken by Delia Peters, one of the company’s wits: “Suzanne coming back is the best thing that’s happened to us since she left.”\n\nIf Farrell’s story had a happy ending, the saddest story since LeClercq’s illness did not. In 1986 the young and popular principal dancer Joseph Duell threw himself to his death, naked, from his apartment window. The shock to the company, now under Peter Martins’ leadership, was profound. Joe and his older brother, Daniel, had come to the school as young boys and had immediately been singled out by Kirstein as potential future leaders. They quickly established themselves as significant dancers, and they were among the few members of the company to be met regularly at Kirstein’s home receptions. Offstage, Joe Duell was unfailingly polite and highly intelligent; onstage he was handsome, reliable, an excellent partner. And by the 1980s he was beginning to choreograph with some success. But one heard talk of a history of instability. His emotional condition slowly worsened, and although people knew that he had earlier been admitted to a hospital for acute depression, most of the company was not aware of how seriously ill he had become. This was in part because he had gotten involved with a group surrounding a well-known psychic, and the group—which included other members of the company—“protected” him in its own way; there were rumors, even, of an exorcism onstage after a performance.\n\nMuch of the anguish that followed his death came from the feeling that he might have been saved if the seriousness of his condition had been brought to the attention of the management. Psychological illness was no stranger to City Ballet—Kirstein himself had been the victim of manic depression for decades and had been institutionalized several times before lithium had rescued him. But no one came to Joe Duell’s rescue, and the combination of the terrible death of so popular a colleague and bitterness at the idea that he might have been saved affects people to this day.\n\nBy the time of Duell’s suicide the ultimate adversity had already struck: Balanchine’s death. It was expected. His health had been unsteady for a long time—a heart attack, open-heart surgery, serious eye problems, and, undoubtedly worst of all for him, a loss of vigor and the ability to demonstrate to his dancers what he wanted from them. When Baryshnikov joined the company in 1978, for instance, Mr. B. could not make a ballet for him. They could talk happily in Russian about the school and company in St. Petersburg from which they had both come, but it was too late for them to work together. Although Balanchine rallied after his heart surgery, slowly it became apparent that both his memory and his physical faculties were failing. He was hospitalized, and a long, painful process of deterioration set in. His dancers and friends came again and again to sit at his bedside until, on April 30, 1983, it was over. After his death, his illness was diagnosed as a rare neurological disorder, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, but what he actually died of was beside the point: the man who had trained so many generations of City Ballet dancers, provided them with their repertory, employed them, guided them—given them, in essence, their lives—no longer existed. He had never been interested in the future; ballet existed for him only in the moment it was being danced: “We are now in this period when people say, ‘Oh, my God, what will happen when you go?’ But everyone goes. . . . It wouldn’t be any good fifty years from now to do what we do now. It will be something else.” Yet this philosophical approach was of little comfort. At the majestic funeral service in the Russian Orthodox church in which he worshiped, crowded with his ex-wives, his dancers past and present, his colleagues and admirers, there can have been very few who were not looking anxiously toward the future. They understood how fragile an art ballet is. If the company and its repertory were to disintegrate, the supreme artistic experience of their lives would be over. Who cared, at that moment, what it would all be like in 50 years?\n\nIV:PERSONALLY\n\nIn the spring of 1948, a few weeks after my 17th birthday, the only teacher in my not overly distinguished New York private school whom I really liked (and who actually liked me) invited me and a classmate to a matinee of Ballet Society at the City Center. Why she thought of taking us I don’t know—she didn’t explain and I didn’t ask. It was enough to have been singled out this way, and by someone so sophisticated. (Sophistication was a key concept in post-war New York.) My ballet background was meager (this was pre-Nutcracker): my mother had taken me, when I was about 12, to see Alicia Markova in Giselle, and I remember my bewilderment at all those girls in white gauze hopping around the stage. Then she took me to the “boys’ program” at Ballet Theatre: Fancy Free (sailors) and Rodeo and Billy the Kid (cowboys). They made more sense than Giselle’s Wilis, but not much more. And I had seen the current Broadway musicals with “ballets” in them—On the Town, the Agnes de Mille shows such as Oklahoma! and One Touch of Venus, and Balanchine’s Song of Norway and Where’s Charley? But they were a far cry from the austerities of Ballet Society, of which I retain only a few strong impressions: a girl covered in what seemed to be gold leaf in The Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne (she had been touched by King Midas), and the exhilarating outpouring of music and dance that was Symphony in C. It was just enough so that by the fall of that year, when City Ballet came into being, I was ready to try it. Instantly, I fell in love, and since I was now an undergraduate at Columbia, only a quick subway ride from the City Center, I was able to pursue my passion for four uninterrupted years.\n\nNew York then was in the first flush of having become the capital of the world. In the late 30s the city had filled up with refugees from Nazi Germany—an immigration that drastically altered its cultural tone. New Yorkers became more cosmopolitan, more international, more ... sophisticated. Touchstones for young intellectuals (or bohemians, as the braver among them saw themselves) were the Museum of Modern Art of Picasso’s Guernica and its film department’s screenings of such masterpieces as Carl Dreyer’s Passion of Joan of Arc— and in fact all of what we then called “foreign film.” These were the pre-Fellini, pre-Bergman days of French movies like La Symphonie Pastorale and of the Italian neorealists Rossellini and De Sica. Revival houses—the decrepit Thalia up on 95th Street in particular—showed endless reruns of Pagnol’s The Baker’s Wife and Harry Baur in Crime and Punishment. Martha Graham embodied the high seriousness of “modern dance.” And of course there was Greenwich Village, with its world of louche bars and their promise (or threat) of casual sexual encounters. This was the background we brought to Balanchine, this plus whatever reading we were deeply engaged in—in my case, typically for the times, Henry James. In other words, we were earnest, and dedicated to High Art. Balanchine fit us like a glove.\n\nGoing to the New York City Ballet in those days, with the City Center half-empty and the Times in opposition, had a satisfyingly conspiratorial feeling to it. But far more important, at least for me, was the way Balanchine’s dances and dancers made me feel. Whether I was watching Orpheus, with its ultra-modern Noguchi artifacts (we used to call them the divine toilet seat and the sacred catcher’s mask), its beautiful Stravinsky score, and its wrenching story, or the ecstatically uplifting Symphony in C, or the rigorous, black-and-white Hindemith Four Temperaments, which seemed to carry the concept of “modern” as far as it could go, I was released from the tyranny of words and filled with joy. I can remember rushing out of the City Center after countless performances and clunkily jeté-ing up Sixth Avenue, to the tolerant amusement of my not-yet first wife and my closest friend, Richard Howard. They were in Balanchine’s grip, too, but they also had a grip on themselves.\n\nWe would buy the cheapest tickets ($1.20, I think) for the cavernous second balcony and do what students always do—sneak down to the better seats during the first intermission. These years, with the steadily growing Balanchine repertory and the regular visits of Sadler’s Wells with Margot Fonteyn and the Classics, were the foundation of my ballet education and also of my saturation in the Balanchine aesthetic. Watching him was how we learned to watch dance, and perhaps also how we learned to consider the world: here was an art that emphasized speed and energy on the one hand, clarity, restraint, and strict obedience to classic ordinances on the other. There was a hierarchy on display, with the ballerina regnant; everyone onstage understood and accepted this arrangement. Very young dancers would arrive and slowly (or, if they were as talented as Allegra Kent or Suzanne Farrell, quickly) move up the hierarchy until they reached what Balanchine saw as their natural level. Virtue was always rewarded. At least to those of us who were observing, nothing but talent was involved—no vulgar considerations of commerce or publicity, which were anathema to young intellectuals in the early 50s. The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit had no place on the stage of the City Center.\n\nFrom 1952 to 1954 I was at Cambridge in England, and when I got back, the company had reached one of its peaks, and then, after LeClercq’s illness, it fell into one of its slumps—relieved by the arrival of a superb French dancer, Violette Verdy, who not only strengthened the ballerina ranks immeasurably but gave Balanchine the opportunity to make roles that demanded her Gallic elegance and her supreme musicality. Except for Karin von Aroldingen, Verdy remains the only European ballerina to have become an essential part of City Ballet, as opposed to the impressive series of leading male dancers who were imported from the Danish tradition—Erik Bruhn, Helgi Tomasson, Adam Lüders, Ib Anderson, Nikolaj Hübbe, and Peter Martins himself. Verdy and Melissa Hayden—a dynamo of confidence and assertion, and a tremendous audience favorite—anchored the repertory, along with Balanchine’s first male American star, the boyishly charming yet superbly equipped Jacques d’Amboise (né Joseph Jacques Ahearn), who as a virtuoso, a partner, and a mentor to young dancers played a central role in the company for more than three decades.\n\nThroughout these years I was at the City Center, and then at the State Theater, whenever possible. But it never occurred to me that I would ever meet a dancer, let alone have anything to do with George Balanchine or the New York City Ballet. Dancers were semi-divinities to me—I didn’t think of them as people one might know; I don’t think I thought of them as people at all. The fact that I was now older than many of the dancers was irrelevant: Allegra Kent at 17, Edward Villella at 21, seemed to me as grand, as far above mortal life, as Pavlova and Nijinsky—and imagine knowing them.\n\nSoon after I began working at the publishing house of Knopf, in 1968, Martha Swope—the official photographer of City Ballet, whom I had known in another connection—asked me if I would be interested in publishing a big, opulently illustrated book about the company with a text by Lincoln Kirstein. Naturally I said I would, and it was quickly arranged. Lincoln (and here I switch to first names, since that was the way I came to know him and his colleagues) was pleased with the results and asked me to work with him on a book about Nijinsky. By this time we had become good ... what? I can’t really say “friends,” since I don’t believe Lincoln saw relationships in terms of friendship. More than acquaintances, though. He was an easy writer to work with (although his prose wasn’t easy) and a fascinating man to spend time with—certainly the finest mind I had ever encountered, and the strongest personality as well. His almost hulking size, his superb head, the splendor of his vision and his accomplishment, even the baroque magnificence of his town house with his collection of art and art objects, made a profound impression. But even more meaningful to me was his approach to life. All his energy went toward trying to make the right things happen by identifying what he hoped was ability and giving it full rein. But unlike anyone I knew, he didn’t seem to mind if his protégés or projects failed, and he didn’t want credit if they succeeded. He wasn’t waiting for a payoff; his impulse toward talent was disinterested.\n\nAt some point in the early 70s, Lincoln asked me to serve on a new board of directors he was establishing for City Ballet. I told him that I would always do anything I could for the company but didn’t think I belonged on such a board since (a) I wasn’t comfortable with the rich and (b) I would be unhappy as a money-raiser. He replied that money wouldn’t be my concern; what he wanted was someone who understood the company and Balanchine. In fact, he was more explicit: “I want someone on the board who knows ballet and will understand what to do at the critical moment.” (That moment, of course, was the moment when Balanchine would have to be replaced.) It seemed to me a tremendous compliment.\n\nThe new board was, needless to say, a rubber stamp for Balanchine; who was going to deny him anything? In other words, it was a reflection of Lincoln, who saw his role as making possible anything Balanchine wanted to do. The board didn’t need to exercise strict financial controls, since that role had been filled from the beginning by the company’s formidable manager, Betty Cage, whose powerful nature and gimlet eye were directed at saving money, saying “no” whenever necessary and “yes” whenever possible. (Tallchief refers to her as “a combination labor negotiator, certified public accountant, legal expert, Mother Superior, Father confessor, and psychiatrist.”) It was through Betty that my involvement with the company grew more active. Every Monday she made dinner in her West Side brownstone for Lincoln and a few friends—Tanny LeClercq’s mother, McNeil Lowry of the Ford Foundation and his wife, et al.—and I was often included. At dinner one night, when the talk came around to the weekend matinees, which were not attracting a family audience, I pointed out that these afternoon performances often weren’t suitable for kids—not many parents would choose to take their children to the highly erotic Bugaku, for instance. Lincoln instantly said, “If you’re interested in programming, why don’t you help Betty with it?” Programming each season was yet another of Betty’s responsibilities, and she generously accepted my participation; by this time it may have become just another chore for her, but to me it was utterly absorbing.\n\nThe technical problems of putting together a nine-week subscription season, eight performances a week, were immense. First there was the nature of the subscription itself—four performances for each of the 16 subscription series, with no repeats of ballets, not only for the coming season but from the past two. Then there were the requirements of the stage manager, Ronnie Bates: what scenery could go up in a single performance, and in what order. Each performance demanded musical variety, and this involved our superb musical director, Robert Irving. More complicated were the problems of the ballet mistress, Rosemary Dunleavy, who could prepare only a certain number of ballets for performance in any given week. There was the question of who danced what: you couldn’t have three McBride or Mazzo ballets on one program. And you didn’t want more than one piano ballet, or one romp, or one black-and-white, or one ballet in which the girls at some point let their hair down. Balanchine liked a rousing closer, with the whole corps de ballet whipping up a storm. Jerry Robbins had very definite ideas about when and how often his ballets should be scheduled. But the technical difficulties were solvable if you laid out enough versions of a schedule and kept shifting the ballets around. The more challenging part was creating programs that made aesthetic sense—juxtaposing ballets so that the program as a whole had variety, depth, and coherence. Perhaps it was easier for me to do this than for company stalwarts who rarely watched an entire program from the audience; in any case, when Betty decided I was doing it properly, she left me to my own devices.\n\nBefore every season I sat first with George (as I had started to call him before I realized that he was “Mr. B.” to almost everybody, and then didn’t know how to backtrack), then with Jerry, to tell them which ballets I thought should be brought back or dropped. Balanchine—Mr. B.—George—hardly cared, except from a musical point of view. (His often stated view was that even if the dancing was “lousy” the audience—particularly students—could sit back with their eyes closed and just listen.) Jerry, as I say, was more involved. And both of them had to let me know—if they knew at that time—what their new ballets were going to be, since one couldn’t schedule “New Ballet No. 1” as a rip-roaring closer lasting 25 minutes if it was going to end up a simple pas de deux.\n\nEventually the programs were agreed upon and could be turned into brochures and ads. After a year or two I got involved in these marketing matters as well, and for 10 years or more I supervised all the company’s sales efforts from my office at Knopf. As time went by, I came to realize what had happened: City Ballet had been to a great extent a ma-and-pa store, with a tiny administrative staff and a not very big budget. Now the company was growing, Ma and Pa were feeling overextended, and some outside energy was needed, or at least tolerated. I saw myself as a useful kind of glue, whether helping with union negotiations, lending a hand with mailings and the phones in the subscription department on weekends, occasionally acting as a spokesman for the company (as during the 1976 orchestra strike), serving as liaison between the management (of which I was an unofficial part) and the board, or carrying messages to and from the major figures in the company when they found it inconvenient or uncomfortable to communicate directly. In fact, I saw myself during this period as a part-time messenger of the gods, and I found this kind of uncomplicated service to two great men and a noble institution deeply satisfying.\n\nThrough these years I spent a considerable amount of time with George, since there were always issues to resolve. Sometimes I would stand with him in the wings watching performances, sometimes I would go to his office, and if there was a crisis I would call him at home. He was always calm, always courteous, always realistic, and always impersonal. I had understood that I was caught up in some kind of psychic drama with Lincoln: Was he the ideal father? (Hardly!) The ideal mentor? (Not if he could help it.) Perhaps the ideal citizen-patron. I understood that, whatever our relationship was, it would eventually and abruptly be broken off—that had happened with countless people who cared for him—and when it did happen, I was prepared if not consoled. With Balanchine, though, there was no relationship, nor could I imagine one or want one. I also couldn’t imagine what he thought I was doing in his ballet company or even that he knew who I was. After several years, I asked his personal assistant, Barbara Horgan—who had become a close friend of mine, and who today heads both the George Balanchine Trust and the George Balanchine Foundation—why he accepted me to the extent that he was aware of my existence. Barbara explained: It was my name. After all, “Gottlieb” is the German equivalent of “Amadeus,” and the Mozart connection was good enough for Mr. B.\n\nI have two memories of Balanchine during these years which emphasize one of his outstanding characteristics: his utter practicality. The Tchaikovsky Festival of 1981 was notable for an amazing backdrop that had been commissioned for the entire celebration. It was a gigantic assemblage of plastic tubes strung together and hung from the top to the bottom of the stage, and it was very beautiful when properly lit. But on the day it was being installed—which was the day the festival was to begin—everything was chaos. One of the very large tubes fell to the stage, narrowly missing a stagehand, who would have been seriously injured if it had struck him. And then as the tubes were exposed to the heat of powerful stage lights they began to smell (actually, they began to stink). No one knew whether the stage would be ready by eight o’clock, or whether the theater would be inhabitable. Balanchine sat in the middle of the theater ignoring the hysteria surrounding him, totally focused on the way Merrill Ashley’s tiara for Swan Lake sat on her head. That was the one thing he could do something about, and he was doing it.\n\nSome time before that, a dispute between the company and the musicians had been submitted to arbitration, and negotiations had been moved to the World Trade Center. (We had been in discussion for almost six months.) The sessions were excruciatingly boring because one side would make a proposal and the other would caucus—sometimes for half a day or even longer. If you arrived at nine in the morning and finished with the paper and the crossword puzzle and the gossip and what work you had brought along, there was nothing left but the telephone. Late one morning we ran out of dimes but were afraid to leave the building to get more in case we were summoned to the bargaining table. Eddie Bigelow, one of the central figures of the administration, used his last dime to leave a message for George Michelmore, the company’s orchestra contractor, to bring us more dimes, and plenty of them. An hour later Balanchine burst into the room with a bag of dimes, hoping he had arrived in time! They had given the message to the wrong George, but he was so happy to have been given a useful job to do that no one had the heart to disillusion him.\n\nEarly in the 1980s, Lincoln asked me to get to know Peter Martins. “I’m too old,” he said. “He’ll need someone when the time comes.” Lincoln had made it abundantly clear over the past few years that he saw Peter as Balanchine’s successor, but this was the first indication he had given me that he felt his own powers diminishing. It was not a happy moment. But I did get to know Peter, and we got on well, possibly because we shared an insatiable appetite for talking about the company. At this time I often traveled with the ballet—to London several times, to Copenhagen, to Saratoga for its summer seasons—and it was mostly on these trips that I would go out after performances with Peter and his companion of many years, the principal dancer Heather Watts, for long dinners consisting of pasta, wine, Strindbergian contention, and ballet talk. By the time Balanchine was in his final decline and Peter and Jerry Robbins were overseeing the company jointly, I was in essence doing the same things for Peter that I had been doing for Balanchine—scheduling the season, overseeing the marketing, and being a general handyman. When Balanchine died, ironically, the crisis Lincoln had foreseen never arose: the board understood that Peter was next in line, and in that sense the transition took place smoothly. Perhaps Balanchine’s long illness and slow withdrawal from company matters made things easier; Peter just did more and more as George did less and less, and then he was doing everything, apart from what Jerry chose to do. The mainstays of the management—Betty Cage, Eddie Bigelow, Barbara Horgan—were firmly in place. And the dancers danced. Yet everything was different.\n\nWhen I went to work at The New Yorker, in 1987, four years after Balanchine’s death, the dancers were still dancing, but a lot of people thought they were dancing less well. Prominent among them was the magazine’s great dance critic, Arlene Croce, who wrote several fierce denunciations of Peter and the company. (She was not alone.) Since I was close to Arlene both personally and professionally, and indeed was now the person publishing these negative pieces, my situation at City Ballet was hopelessly compromised; Peter, who was both angry and hurt, felt I should withdraw from the board of directors, and sometime in the late 80s I did so. What saddened me most was not that after 15 years of active participation I was cut off from the company, or the break—at least for then—in my friendship with Peter, but that I too was unhappy with what I saw taking place on the stage. As Peter said to me with more emotion than I had ever heard from him, the problem wasn’t just that I edited and published Arlene, but that I agreed with her. And this was not simply a matter of aesthetics; for people like me, it was a life-defining moment. Arlene had once said, “The New York City Ballet is our civilization,” and that civilization had entered a worrying new stage.\n\nFor most of the past decade, then, my relation to the company has once again been simply that of an observer. But if I’m no longer part of City Ballet, it remains part of me. The great spectacle of Balanchine’s accomplishment—the high drama of his achievement, which it was New York’s privilege to witness for so many years—is still at the heart of my emotional and moral life. As Ira Gershwin says, they can’t take that away from me.\n\nV:THROUGH BALANCHINE’S WORDS\n\nVery few recent figures of George Balanchine’s importance have said so little publicly. There is no autobiography, no manifesto; there are no collected letters or “conversations,” like those of Stravinsky with Robert Craft; only scattered interviews through the years. Occasionally, Kirstein produced official statements in Balanchine’s name, but these were of little interest to Balanchine, and no one was fooled. Yet few great artists have as many famous remarks ascribed to them as Balanchine. And no comparable artist of the century—not Stravinsky himself, or Picasso, the two geniuses with whom he is most often bracketed—is so much written about and talked about by those who surrounded him. In the 15 years since his death, there has been a torrent of writing about him, to add to what was already a formidable body of appreciation. Of his wives, Geva, Danilova, Zorina, and Tallchief have produced autobiographies that naturally focus on him. The ballerinas Allegra Kent, Suzanne Farrell, and Merrill Ashley and the leading dancers Edward Villella and Peter Martins are on record. There are two full-scale biographies—by Bernard Taper and Richard Buckle. Two invaluable compendiums—I Remember Balanchine and Balanchine’s Ballerinas—present fascinating testimony from various sources. (Much of what I have written here comes from these as well as many other books, interviews, and critical essays.)\n\nOne of the most striking things about Balanchine’s rare public utterances is their consistency. In interviews and as quoted by his dancers, he comes back and back to the same ideas, and always in that highly compressed not-quite-English of his that everyone loves to imitate (together with his little sniff and his calling people “dear,” irrespective of gender or level of intimacy). Among the most quoted of his epigrammatic utterances:\n\nBallet is woman. Here is how he put it in a Life magazine interview in 1965: “The ballet is a purely female thing: it is a woman, a garden of beautiful flowers, and man is the gardener. . . . Woman is the goddess, the poetess, the muse. . . . I believe the same is true of life, that everything man does he does for his ideal woman.” On another occasion: “Woman is still first in ballet. Man is an attendant to a queen. He is a consort, he is noble, brilliant, but, finally merely good enough to be her partner. Ballet is a woman. And all my life I have dedicated my art to her.” Villella quotes him as saying, “In politics it’s Eisenhower, in sports it’s Mickey Mantle, in ballet it’s Woman.” Yet Villella is a dancer on whom Balanchine made a glorious series of roles, from the lead in “Rubies” (the middle section of Jewels) and Oberon in A Midsummer Night’s Dream to Harlequin in Harlequinade and the principal male in Symphony in Three Movements—and this despite the considerable friction between them. (It’s not for nothing that Villella’s book is called Prodigal Son.) Balanchine needed men, if only as gardeners or attendants, yet there was always an area of competition: obedient sons were O.K., but rivals weren’t, either sexual or professional. I remember the fierceness with which he answered me when I had to ask him whether he was planning a new ballet for Baryshnikov the season Misha joined the company: “Diaghilev made me make ballets for Lifar. I never do that again. Misha very useful dancer, can do anything. We don’t treat him like star.” (The ballets that Balanchine was “made” to create for Serge Lifar, Diaghilev’s then favorite, included Apollo and Prodigal Son, which contained two of the greatest roles ever invented for a male dancer, and he was still resentful 50 years later.)\n\nHis view of women was more complex. They were more interesting to work with because they could do so much with their bodies when they were on pointe, and there was no area of technique he extended further than pointe work. That was the technical side. And women were the objects of erotic appeal, and his relationships were numerous. But women were also, as he says, Ideal. Deeply embedded in his soul was the need to pursue the unattainable—the evidence is in ballet after ballet, from La Sonnambula to Don Quixote. “George put women on a pedestal,” writes Zorina, “where they don’t necessarily want to be. . . . When he loved, he loved too much.” He succeeded with many women, but after the success came loss or rebuff. “They all left me,” he said of his wives.\n\nBut, more than anything, women were what he worked with and from. Danilova put it succinctly: “He marries his materials.” Geva said, less patiently, “He’s the high priest of his art and he wants his wife to be a high priestess. I wanted more. . . . George is an extraordinarily aloof man.” Tallchief: “Passion and romance didn’t play a big role in our married life. We saved our emotion for the classroom. . . . George saved all his energy for work. He made sure we slept in twin beds, perhaps to conserve his energy.” Women with whom he wasn’t romantically involved tended to idealize him. Ruthanna Boris, who was there at the very start in America, when Serenade was being made in 1934, said, “Everybody is in love with Balanchine in a way, because he teaches and works with love. But I’m afraid I don’t look at Balanchine the way a woman looks at a man. I look at him more as an inevitable force—like I would look at lightning, at Niagara Falls, at Mount St. Helens, at cosmic events.” And Violette Verdy echoes her: “Frankly, I had a hard time thinking of Balanchine as a person. . . . For a long time he was primarily a mythical or symbolic figure for me.”\n\nErotic object or symbolic figure, wife or mistress, Ideal or Real, each of the 20 or more women on whom Balanchine focused his creative energy seems to have served him in the same way. Unerringly he understood what each of them could do as a dancer—far better, as they testify, than they understood themselves—and inexorably he used their specific qualities to bring out what he heard in the music as well as to reveal them at their best to the public. In that sense, they were his collaborators as much as they were his tools. Could there have been a Bugaku without Allegra Kent’s erotic suppleness? Possibly, but it would have been a different ballet. Would there have been a “Diamonds” if he hadn’t seen that Farrell could define and extend the prima-ballerina tradition he had grown up in? Or a Who Cares? or a “Rubies” without the American energy and charm of McBride? Merrill Ashley made possible the hitherto unimaginable allegro attack and speed of Ballo della Regina, after Balanchine had patiently guided her for 15 years to help her arrive at that strength of technique and personality.\n\nMost Balanchine ballerina roles cannot be fully distinguished from the dancer on whom they were made; we can infer the qualities of a dancer we’ve never seen from the roles made on her. Firebird always reflects Tallchief; La Valse, LeClercq; Stars and Stripes, Melissa Hayden; Who Cares?, McBride; “Emeralds,” Verdy; Ballo della Regina, Ashley; “Diamonds,” Farrell; etc. If “ballet is woman,” at least for Balanchine, it is not simply because he loved women and was inspired by them, but because they were, as Danilova put it, his material. “Artistically every woman gets something out of him,” said Geva. “They say, ‘Make something of me,’ and usually he obliges.”\n\nRussia is the home of romantic ballet. The home of classic ballet is now America. This famous remark was made in response to a Russian interviewer who, in greeting the New York City Ballet at the Moscow airport at the start of the company’s famous 1962 Russian tour, said to Balanchine, “Welcome to Russia, the home of the classical ballet.” What Balanchine was insisting on—boasting of?—was that it was he, in America, who had carried to a new level the classic Petipa style of The Sleeping Beauty, while the posturings and dramatics of Soviet ballet, however magnificently danced, represented a perversion of, or at least a deviation from, true classicism. But he was making another claim as well, about America and himself as an American. “I always wanted to be American. I couldn’t even speak English, but I really wanted to be American.” And “I am more American than Russian.”\n\nHe choreographed not only to Charles Ives but to American folk songs (Western Symphony), Sousa marches (Stars and Stripes), and Gershwin (Who Cares?). Jazz accents punctuated his work from Apollo to Concerto Barocco and “Rubies.” (We can see on film, and it is confirmed by dancers like Marie-Jeanne, that Barocco, for instance, was performed in a much jazzier way 50 years ago than it is today.) He brought in a square-dance caller for the original version of Square Dance, and a major unrealized project was The Birds of America, after Audubon.\n\nChoreographing for Broadway was not just a way of earning a living; he loved American show business—“Rodgers and Hart are great poets”—and learned from it: “On Broadway I learned how to please the public. I am commercial.” He not only worked on Broadway but also for the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. (In 1941, he phoned Stravinsky in California and asked him to write the music for a ballet with elephants. “How old?” asked Stravinsky. “Very young.” “All right,” said Stravinsky. “If they are very young elephants, I will do it.”) Circus Polka lasted only a single season for the Ringling Bros.; the elephants didn’t seem to enjoy it. Possibly they didn’t like the pale-blue tutus Balanchine dressed them in.\n\nBalanchine admired not only Astaire (“The male dancer I like to watch is an American: Fred Astaire. He is the most interesting, the most inventive, the most elegant dancer of our times”) but also Astaire’s most famous partner. In an interview he admitted that although he wasn’t nervous meeting Stravinsky for the first time, “I was nervous when I met Ginger Rogers.” He loved the fact that Tallchief was a Native American, and wore until he died a turquoise bracelet her cousin had given him. He wore western shirts too, and watched Westerns (and The Untouchables) on television. But most of all he loved the way Americans danced. “America has its own spirit—cold, luminous, hard as light. Good American dancers can express clean emotion in a manner that might almost be termed angelic.” Proudly he became an American citizen. He did, however, acknowledge, “I’m not really American yet. I can’t understand rock ’n roll.”\n\nBut first a school. The story goes that when, in 1933, Lincoln Kirstein first approached Balanchine about coming to America to start a ballet company, Balanchine responded, “But first a school.” In other words, before you could have good dancing, you had to have good dancers. When he says, “I wanted to come to America to create an American company,” he is also saying that he had to create American dancers as he believed they might one day be—not in imitation of the Russians, but with a style that insisted on speed, agility, attack, and, most of all, energy. Remember: he called his school the School of American Ballet, although he and almost all of his fellow teachers were Russian and there was no real American ballet. From the start, he wanted fresh young Americans in his classes, and he was willing to wait for them to develop. It wasn’t until the late 50s or even the 60s that he could count on filling the company’s ranks with first-class dancers from the school. Ballerinas like Diana Adams, Melissa Hayden, Nora Kaye, and Janet Reed were imports.\n\nThe history of S.A.B. is a saga in itself, complete with strong personalities and multiple crises. In a sense, it was more Kirstein’s domain than Balanchine’s—Lincoln was eternally fascinated by the idea of a formal academy (he would have liked the boys to wear formal cadet uniforms), while Balanchine naturally focused on the actual pedagogy and on the very young talent he could observe and encourage. Two developments powerfully affected the school. In 1963 the Ford Foundation gave it a grant that was huge for those days—about $4 million. Soon afterward, S.A.B. began a series of annual “workshops,” in which the students—and in particular the graduating class—could be vetted by the ballet world. These performances—modeled on the traditional graduation performances in St. Petersburg, which had spotlighted such dancers as Pavlova, Nijinsky, and Nureyev—first revealed to critics and ballet-lovers Gelsey Kirkland, Kyra Nichols, Darci Kistler, and many other important dancers of the past few decades, becoming an annual rite of passage for both the school and the dance community.\n\nS.A.B., like City Ballet itself, is now run by Peter Martins, and year after year superbly trained dancers emerge from it not only into N.Y.C.B. but into ballet companies around the country. Even the recent death of Stanley Williams—the great teacher from Denmark who was an especially important mentor for boys—has been taken in stride. The school is where continuity is assured—where what Balanchine wanted and taught is being passed along to young people for whom Balanchine can be only a name and an ideal.\n\nNow that we can begin to weigh Balanchine’s entire American venture historically, it appears more and more likely that the school—or, rather, Balanchine schooling—will be his longest-lasting and most significant legacy. City Ballet will either flourish or not. The Balanchine repertory—at least a considerable part of it—should survive well into the next century; it is being danced, with varying degrees of success, not only everywhere in America but around the world. Balanchine didn’t count on it, though: “Of course, today’s dance won’t last, it never lasted before.” But short of catastrophe, there seems to be no reason why the School of American Ballet will not be maintaining and asserting its standards as long as ballet continues to matter in America. And Balanchine understood this from the start. Not only “First a school ... ” but, decisively, “I am a teacher, that is my contribution.”\n\nSee the music and hear the dancing. For Balanchine, son of a composer and himself a capable musician, “the music is always first. I cannot move, I can’t even want to move, unless I hear the music first. I couldn’t move without a reason, and the reason is music.” To us, whose approach to ballet has been formed by our exposure to Balanchine, this seems almost tautological, but it was a revolutionary concept when Balanchine first exemplified it. There had been great ballet music in the 19th century—Tchaikovsky’s for Swan Lake, Nutcracker, and Sleeping Beauty; Delibes’s for Coppélia and La Source—but these ballets nevertheless depended on story and décor. For most of Petipa’s ballets over a 50-year period, efficient music by composers like Drigo and Pugni served to provide a beat, some good tunes, and background sound for spectacle and virtuosity. For Diaghilev, despite his exquisite and advanced taste and his adventurousness in commissioning scores from leading modern composers (including Firebird and Le Sacre du Printemps from Stravinsky, Prodigal Son from Prokofiev, and Daphnis et Chloë from Ravel), music was no more a significant element of his presentations than his collaborations with Picasso, Matisse, or Derain. But for Balanchine music was the element that made dance possible. And as a result of his perfect instinct for what can best be danced to, stretching over a vast range of musical expression, the audience he educated has been taught to hear differently—or, as he would have said, to see differently. Speaking from the stage of the State Theater on the day of Balanchine’s death, Lincoln Kirstein emphasized the company Balanchine kept: “I don’t have to tell you that Mr. B. is with Mozart and Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky.”\n\nThere are scores of Balanchine remarks that have been remembered, passed along, collected (many of them in a tiny pamphlet called simply By George Balanchine). “There are no mother-in-laws in ballet.” “Put a man and a girl on the stage and there is already a story; a man and two girls, there’s already a plot.” “Calculated vulgarity is a very useful ingredient.” “Dance is the body at its maximum.” “Just do it.” And particularly moving to me: “I don’t use that word ‘create’; God creates and I assemble what has already been created.” His words as quoted always seem telling and revelatory. And yet he could say of himself, and of all dancers, “We are a silent minority. We only dance.”\n\nVI:FORWARD\n\nAt the end of 1983, despite the sadness and strain of Balanchine’s final year, and the overwhelming grief at his death, New York City Ballet was in high gear. Everything was in place—the repertory, the school, a cadre of superb dancers, and a new ballet master in chief, who was the legitimate successor and for whom everyone had high expectations. Arlene Croce wrote of Peter Martins in The New Yorker, “In his years with New York City Ballet, he grew immeasurably as an artist. Placing himself in Balanchine’s service, he rose to the kind of stardom that makes him, in his turn, master of the art and the one who must now set the terms of it for the next generation. A loyal knight, he has earned the prize. The enchanted kingdom is in his keeping.” Officially, Martins was to share authority with Jerome Robbins, but that was understood to be a courtesy; Robbins had never been seriously interested in administration. Nor were Robbins and Martins temperamentally suited to a real partnership; they dealt with each other gingerly.\n\nThat Martins was the legitimate heir was as clear to me as to everyone else. Not only Kirstein but Balanchine had told me so, twice. The more memorable instance came one evening when we were standing silently in the wings, watching Martins and Farrell in “Diamonds.” Suddenly he said, “It has to be Peter. He understands what a ballerina needs,” and receded into silence. Certainly Martins was a very great partner, and in that sense understood more than any other male in the company what ballerinas needed; whether Balanchine was referring to more than his partnering technique, I have no way of knowing. Nor could I know whether he was saying this to me simply because it had occurred to him at that moment, or because he was taking the opportunity to express his wishes to a member of the board of directors, which, after all, would be making the official decision when the time came. As it happened, the board was already well disposed toward Peter, whose way with a board is masterly. Even so, there was a certain amount of tension while Balanchine was incapacitated and before the appointment was actually made, and Martins found himself at times in the uncomfortable position of being expected to run everything without the official authority to do so.\n\nIf there was resentment at Martins’ ascension, it was invisible. Who would have questioned Balanchine and Kirstein in a matter of such enormous consequence? Whether they were mistaken, and what other choice might have been made, is the issue at the heart of the rancorous controversy that now divides critics and the knowledgeable ballet public. Within half a dozen years of Balanchine’s death, many observers were convinced that the company was in serious straits. Part of the problem lay in the obvious: Balanchine had been creating masterpieces for 55 years; neither Peter Martins nor anyone else could replace him in that regard. You can’t legislate genius into existence. But Martins had shown promise as a choreographer—his first piece, Calcium Light Night, made over 20 years ago, was highly successful, and, encouraged by Balanchine, he followed it up with other good work. It was only after he took over the company that his choreography seemed to stall—it’s hard for me to imagine his more recent work taking its place in the permanent repertory, and I suspect that Martins feels the same way. Certainly, when I was working with him he was always remarkably without ego—in fact, was overly modest—about his own ballets.\n\nChoreographers are born, not made, and in the 15 years that Martins has been running the company, no significant new talent has emerged. The latest potential candidate—a young (and excellent) dancer named Christopher Wheeldon—shows considerable musicality, self-assurance, and the knack of making dancers look good. With luck he will develop, and he and the company will embrace each other. Finally, it is good news that the finest “modern” choreographer of the younger generation, Mark Morris, is to make a new work for the company in the year 2000. He was notably absent from the 1988 American Music Festival.\n\nAs for the dancing, the roster of ballerinas that 15 years ago seemed as strong as any in the history of ballet all too quickly dispersed: Farrell and McBride into retirement, followed by Watts; Ashley frequently struggling with injuries; Maria Calegari—the obvious successor to Farrell roles (“This is my favorite, this is my next ballerina,” Balanchine had said)—at odds with Martins and then gone; Nichol Hlinka, after years of inconsistency, just beginning to come into her own. Only the gloriously imperturbable Kyra Nichols, a paragon of serene classicism, and the wonderfully talented Darci Kistler could be regularly looked to for the highest level of performance—and Kistler was already beginning to be plagued with the injuries that were to blight what should have been a blessed career.\n\nMartins turned to two young girls in the company, Margaret Tracey and Wendy Whelan. The first was the more obviously gifted—she had an impeccably proportioned body and a fresh, confident manner onstage, and one could imagine her developing into a McBride-like dancer. Instead, her dancing has grown increasingly thin and empty even as she has assumed more and more leading roles. Whelan’s trajectory has been very different. Initially, she seemed so opposite to the classic ideal, with her ragged line and lack of phrasing, that one couldn’t guess what Martins saw in her, other than strength and a good jump. But no one has ever worked harder to improve, and she has improved beyond recognition. Even in works for which she is less than well suited, she presents herself and the role with honesty, responsibility, and a happy absence of mannerism, justifying Martins’ faith in her.\n\nBut these two emerged more than a decade ago, and after them came a frightening drought. The one girl who appeared headed for glory seemed to be self-destructing. When Monique Meunier performed in the school workshop in 1989, the drought appeared to be over. A big, plush blonde with tremendous dance energy and an obvious love of performing, she was the first girl since Kistler whom we could fall in love with. At first she stood out in the corps de ballet, more interesting by far than many of the principals she was dancing behind. But she was rarely cast in soloist roles, and rumors of problems surfaced. Finally, in a season when many of the principals were injured, she was pushed into major roles and began to take her rightful place, quickly becoming an audience favorite. People blamed Martins for not advancing her, but that may be unjust—he was as taken with her as everyone else. And it’s easy to forget that dancers like Hlinka and Calegari suffered comparable ups and downs during their early years under Balanchine. Still, her stalled career seemed an ominous note.\n\nSince then, other girls have been brought forward more quickly—in the case of Miranda Weese, alarmingly so. Here is a dancer who was made a principal almost overnight, and from a technical point of view it’s understandable—she has beautiful line and immaculate technique. To observers for whom perfectly executed steps are the foremost consideration, she is a miracle. To my eye, she dances as if she were in class. In an interview in Dance Magazine, Weese asserts that she dances for herself. But what about us, the audience? Ballet is about performance as much as it is about steps. Tracey and Weese epitomize an unfortunate aspect of the company’s current dancing: all too often, performers seem both self-satisfied and miniaturized. At a recent performance of Balanchine’s great Mozart work Divertimento No. 15, the five expansive ballerina roles were reduced to dainty little displays of craft. Granted, this has always been a difficult ballet to put on (Balanchine himself would yank it for lack of a strong enough cast), but I can’t remember its ever before looking more like a souvenir Mozart chocolate box from Salzburg than a profound expression of Mozart’s and Balanchine’s art.\n\nAnd now there is Maria Kowroski, who has everything—beauty, glamour, strength—and who was swiftly propelled into the big roles: Swan Lake, the Siren in Prodigal Son, the adagio movement of Symphony in C. The fate of this exciting talent will answer the question of whether Martins can develop a dancer to her highest potential. There would seem to be several strikes against him. First of all, even the greatest dancers have needed to be defined by perceptive choreographers—Nijinsky and Karsavina by Fokine, Farrell et al. by Balanchine, Fonteyn by Ashton, etc. That is why so supreme an artist as Baryshnikov has spent much of his American career in search of new work—not for the sake of novelty but in the hope of revelation. Who is going to discover the dance heart of a Kowroski the way, for instance, Jerome Robbins found it for Kyra Nichols in The Four Seasons, a classic example of a new role serving to define a young dancer?\n\nThe second hurdle is peculiar to City Ballet at this time, and it has to do with who is helping dancers with roles they are inheriting. This was never a problem before: Balanchine was always on hand, as was Robbins. And, equally important, the originators of these roles were often still in the company, or had been seen by their heirs. Historically, and still today at most companies throughout the world, retired leading dancers pass on what they know to younger dancers through coaching; despite dance notation and film, direct demonstration remains the most successful tool for transmitting dance knowledge. But who is showing today’s New York City Ballet dancers how it should be done? There certainly are capable ballet masters on the City Ballet staff, but apart from Martins, not one of them was of the first rank as a dancer, filling the major roles. Von Aroldingen and Mazzo occasionally coach, and possibly Ashley will too, now that her distinguished 30-year career has ended. But dancers like Tallchief, McBride, Kent, Farrell, Verdy, Villella, and d’Amboise have not been welcome, although every one of them, I am certain, would be happy to assist in any way possible to preserve the Balanchine legacy. Indeed, such dancers help out at Villella’s Miami City Ballet and other high-level companies here and abroad with consistently good results. The situation grew to scandalous proportions during the Balanchine Celebration of 1993, keyed to the 10th anniversary of his death. More than 70 Balanchine ballets were being performed, and dancers on whom he had made many if not most of these ballets were being excluded from participation. Finally, out of embarassment, it seemed, a few onetime stars were—not very graciously—allowed to give a few hours of their time to the project.\n\nThe point of such coaching isn’t to encourage new dancers to imitate the mannerisms—even the virtues—of their predecessors, but to expose them to the qualities and style of the original, to clothe them in the ballet’s dance personality. There is something unhappily defensive in City Ballet’s policy of excluding great dancers of the past, however troublesome they might be. A few years ago I asked one leading ballerina who had just inherited a Farrell role whether Suzanne had coached her. “Of course not,” she said. “I wanted to do it my own way.” That Farrell’s way was Balanchine’s way hadn’t occurred to her, or that Farrell could help her find her own way. Certainly, when Farrell coached a group of disparate dancers in Washington several years ago, the performances were in no way Farrell imitations; they just looked like Balanchine.\n\nA mong the most consistent complaints from within and without the company is that Martins has given too much authority to the chief ballet mistress, Rosemary Dunleavy. Dunleavy is a marvel of memory and efficiency, and nobody appreciated her more than Balanchine, who rewarded her for her feat of reconstructing his Tombeau de Couperin by leaving it to her in his will. (He used to refer to her as “my R2D2.”) Since she is a glutton for responsibility, it’s very likely that Martins—who is responsible for the company, the school, and creating new ballets, and who (unlike Balanchine) takes an active role in fund-raising and public relations—is relieved to have someone so capable take charge. But coaching dancers in style and approach is a very different matter from getting a ballet on the stage and teaching steps to newcomers, and it is frequently suggested that Dunleavy is taking charge of areas outside her striking capabilities.\n\nWhatever the justice of these complaints, with Martins and Dunleavy lies the credit or blame for the condition of the company at this time. And it is mixed. Yes, the young women look beautiful and have been superbly prepared at S.A.B., and the young men are technically advanced beyond recognition: not so long ago, every time the boys were about to perform double air turns, it would be hard to say who was more nervous, they or the audience; now they snap off their turns with complete aplomb and security. There are times when everything comes together—and the audience responds. Earlier this year I watched performances of Raymonda Variations, Scotch Symphony, and Symphony in Three Movements that were transporting. Yet all too often the energy level seems sapped—the dancing is academically strong but lacking performance vitality, something that is contrary to all of Balanchine’s principles and violently distorts his work.\n\nOne of the most disturbing events of the past few years has been the departure to A.B.T. of the most talented American male dancer City Ballet has produced since Villella, Ethan Stiefel. The loss of this young man—a model of classical style and elegance, and a charmer as well—is a serious one. It may be that he felt neglected—certainly, the company resisted offering him roles like Apollo and the Prodigal Son. Or he may have felt the pull of a more eclectic repertory. (Almost 30 years ago, a comparably gifted young man felt the same neglect and the same pull—and almost defected to A.B.T. That was Peter Martins.) Fortunately, there are strong principals such as Damian Woetzel, Peter Boal, and Jock Soto holding the repertory together, and there are so many talented new young men in the company—more than it has ever had before—that the loss of Stiefel will eventually be absorbed if not forgotten.\n\nI think it is accurate to say that Martins has a strong defensive streak in him. He sometimes appears to divide people into those who are “loyal” and those who are against him. That critics such as Croce, Joan Acocella in The Wall Street Journal, Tobi Tobias in New York magazine, Laura Jacobs in The Atlantic Monthly, Laura Shapiro in Newsweek, the late Dale Harris, and others have been sharply critical of his company when once they celebrated its greatness he takes as a personal attack. And no doubt he finds comfort in New York’s daily reviewers, who tend to buttress his sense that things are far better than his “enemies” assert. He doesn’t seem to remember that when he took over, everyone was rooting for him, not gunning for him—and he may not grasp that it is disappointment, not malice, that fuels most criticism. But he also has a considered response to the criticism. In a recent meeting, we talked over many of the issues I’m discussing here. Since it was a long, rambling conversation, not a formal question-and-answer interview, I won’t try to quote him directly, but hope I can present his thinking fairly.\n\nFirst of all, Martins is not reluctant to acknowledge specific shortcomings of individual dancers or performances. (Balanchine wasn’t either—I can remember hearing him mutter about this dancer, “She has no fire!,” and that dancer, “She has bad taste!,” and yet another dancer, “I try everything with this one, but she just can’t dance!”) What I think he believes about the larger issues is this: that his essential job has been to preserve the New York City Ballet as an institution through a transition period that was bound to be fraught with anxiety and uncertainty; to keep it going in new directions; to find a new audience; and to preserve the Balanchine repertory without turning the company into a museum. That is a very tall order, and if he has succeeded even in part he deserves credit. Five years ago, I would have said he had failed—the level of performance was inadequate too much of the time. Today I feel differently, simply because I have seen enough impressive dancing recently to counterbalance what I still find wanting.\n\nIn a sense, the company is facing another critical moment: the last of Balanchine’s dancers are fading away; soon, no one on the stage will have known him or worked with him. It will be completely Peter Martins’ company. He has tried in various ways to make it his already. He has chosen his own contemporary composers to work with—Michael Torke, Charles Wuorinen. Those collaborations have not been particularly successful, but he was right to try. He has bombarded the audience with festivals and celebrations. He has imported Wynton Marsalis to jazz things up, brought in the British ballerina Darcey Bussell and the Russian Nina Ananiashvili for a fling in Balanchine roles. He has encouraged more aggressive marketing and P.R. None of these efforts has added measurably to the company’s artistic health, but they do represent an attempt to move forward. How can Martins—how could anyone—emerge easily from under the tremendous weight of Balanchine? Twyla Tharp, hardly the most effusive admirer of other choreographers, once said to me, “George Balanchine is God.” No one can be expected to replace God successfully, but Martins has succeeded in keeping things going, which means making a future possible. And lately I have begun to sense for the first time in a dozen years that the company is stabilizing.\n\nA week this past June juxtaposed two events that resonate together. First, at the S.A.B. workshop we saw not only a promising new ballet by Wheeldon but also a performance in Gounod Symphony by a girl named Janie Taylor, who just might emerge as the next chosen one. We can’t know if she will make it, but she has the capacity. A week later Nichol Hlinka gave her farewell performance, in Scotch Symphony. It was exemplary classical dancing—exquisite, radiant, moving—and I would have been sad rather than exhilarated if I hadn’t just seen Taylor and could fantasize that with luck, and proper direction, 25 years from now she could be giving her farewell performance in the same ballet and to the same effect. I won’t be there to see it (unless they wheel me in at age 92), but if Martins has really succeeded in stabilizing the company, despite all the disappointments he will have made that performance possible. And I prefer to believe that it can happen.\n\nIn the end as in the beginning, there is Balanchine. Among the many great lessons he taught us is that nothing stands still; dance must change, should change, and will change, whether we like it or not. Yet his ballets continue, at the State Theater and around the world. And as with all supreme artists, what he showed us changed us. “He taught you how to live life,” said Darci Kistler, the last of his chosen ballerinas, and Peter Martins’ wife. “His dancing isn’t just about dance. That’s why he’s a great teacher of people. He makes you more conscious of what’s right and what’s wrong. . . . His teachings and his ballets, all the things he said to me, echo. I didn’t have a deep personal relationship with him, but I got enough to live a whole life on.”"
