        "text": "The name honors the choreographer who created around 50 ballets for the New York City Ballet, which he joined in 1948 at the invitation of George Balanchine, and which he led in the position of co-artistic director, with Peter Martins, after Balanchine's death.\n\nHis choreography for Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story is among the works for which he is best known; he co-directed the 1961 film version of the musical and won an Academy Award for it.\n\nRobbins died in 1998, in New York.\n\nIn last November's City Council proposal to change the street name, Robbins is cited as \"one of the first great American-born ballet masters and also a major Broadway and film choreographer.\" The proposed street was introduced by City Council Member Gale A. Brewer, who represents the Upper West Side and Clinton."
