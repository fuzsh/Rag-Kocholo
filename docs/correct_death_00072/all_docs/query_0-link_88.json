        "text": "New York City Ballet, resident ballet company of the New York State Theatre at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. The company, first named Ballet Society, was founded in 1946 by the choreographer George Balanchine (artistic director) and Lincoln Kirstein (general director) as a private subscription organization to promote lyric theatre. It is a descendant of the American Ballet company. In 1948 Ballet Society gave its first public performance at the Center Theater of the New York City Center of Music and Drama and changed the company’s name to the New York City Ballet. From 1950 its prestige grew with foreign tours. It was moved to its present home in 1964. The company performs during summer sessions at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga, New York.\n\nIn addition to ballets choreographed by Balanchine, the company performed works by the choreographers Jerome Robbins (ballet master 1969–90), William Dollar, Todd Bolender, Francisco Moncion, Lew Christensen, Sir Frederick Ashton, and Justin Peck. Its principal dancers have included Maria Tallchief, Tanaquil LeClercq, Melissa Hayden, Patricia Wilde, Violette Verdy, Suzanne Farrell, Gelsey Kirkland, Patricia McBride, Helene Alexopoulos, André Eglevsky, Jacques d’Amboise, Edward Villella, and Peter Martins."
