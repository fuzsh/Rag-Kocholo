        "text": "ABSTRACT: George Balanchine is regarded today as one of the 20th century’s most prolific choreographers. After coming to America he helped to create the New York City Ballet in 1948, a ballet company which continues to perform to this day at Lincoln Center on the Upper West Side in Manhattan, New York. Balanchine developed a modern ballet style characterized by speed and musicality and choreographed over 400 works. His legacy is remembered through his iconic choreography and the theater he helped to design for dance at Lincoln Center.\n\n“See the music and hear the dancing,”\n\n~George Balanchine (1904-1983)\n\nPedestrians walking along West 63rd street near the David H. Koch Theater may notice a street name of, “George Balanchine Way.” As a founder and choreographer of the New York City Ballet and the School of American Ballet, Balanchine’s name will forever be associated with Lincoln Center on the Upper West Side, just as prominently as the David H. Koch Theater stands there today. First a dancer, then a choreographer, Balanchine is known as one of the 20th century’s most prolific choreographers.\n\nGeorge Balanchine was born on January 22, 1904 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He took his first ballet class at the Imperial Ballet School, the principal school of the Imperial Ballet, only one of nine young boys to pass the academy’s entrance exam. He studied under Pavel Gerdt (1844-1917) who was the Premier Danseur Noble of the Imperial Ballet, the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre and the Marinsky Theatre for 56 years and who had trained legendary dancers such as Vaslav Nijinsky, Tamara Karsavina and Anna Pavlova. Balanchine’s interest in choreographing emerged while he was in his early teens. While at the ballet academy, he and several dance student colleagues formed the Young Ballet. His first work, La Nuit, a pas de deux for himself and another female ballerina at the school, is believed to have been created in 1920 or earlier. His next creation was entitled Enigma, which was danced in bare feet. The Young Ballet was soon disbanded by school authorities due to school policies but the experimental nature of his choreography at such a traditional ballet school was likely shocking for the personnel. In 1924, the young dancers Balanchine, Tamara Geva, Alexandra Danilova, and Nicholas Efimov were gaining national acclaim and were allowed to exit the Soviet Union for a tour of Western Europe. Balanchine never returned.\n\nA gust of fresh air was breathed into the world of ballet when Balanchine left the social and political constraints of Russia and traveled to America in 1933, at the invitation of Lincoln Kirstein. Immediately, he founded the School of American Ballet and created his first ballet on American soil, the illustrious Serenade (1934). As Nancy Goldner observed, this ballet has historical significance today since it is his first work in the States, which would also have been very meaningful for Balanchine since it would hopefully be the seed to many more fruitful years to come. Immediately, Balanchine broke away from the traditional choreographic techniques he grew up around in Russia when he made a nontraditional artistic choice of including several “mishaps” that occurred in the Serenade rehearsals into the actual ballet. There is one pose where the ballerina is lying on the floor which was placed into the choreography after one of the dancers fell during rehearsal. One of the dancers, Leda Anchutina, is said to have arrived late to one rehearsal, which ultimately was the inspiration to have one of the ballerinas make her hasty entrance on stage after all the others had entered.\n\nThe ballet company he co-founded with Lincoln Kirstein in 1948, the New York City Ballet, performed thousands of shows from 1964 continued to today at the David H. Koch Theater (formerly the New York State Theater) at 62nd street and Columbus Avenue. The theater was designed by renowned architect Philip Johnson, but Balanchine was very involved with the theater’s specifications to insure it would suit his growing ballet company. Almost every New Yorker will know, and possibly have once attended, the New York City Ballet’s production of the Nutcracker which was choreographed by Balanchine and had its premiere in 1955 and continues to be performed annually as a Christmas tradition. Although the company and the theater continue to exist, George Balanchine passed away in New York City on April 30, 1983 of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\n\nIn ballet’s past, the music had been secondary to the dancing, for Balanchine, the music came first. Balanchine once stated that “the music is always first. I cannot move, I cannot even want to move, unless I hear the music first. I couldn’t move without a reason, and the reason is music.” For him, choreography was the result of music, not vice-versa. His non-conventional ballets encouraged audiences to “see the music and hear the dancing” like never before.\n\n-Ailina Mayer\n\nRESOURCES\n\nCohen, Selma Jeanne. “George Balanchine (1904-1983).” International Encyclopedia of Dance: A Project of Dance Perspectives Foundation, Inc. 1st ed. Vol. 1. New York: Oxford UP, 1998. Print.\n\nThe International Encyclopedia of Dance is an extensive six volume conglomeration of information specifically related to dance. All too often, the arts are minorities in traditional encyclopedic resources. But this encyclopedia contains a wealth of knowledge about important figures in the dance field, international dance companies, as well as a wide spectrum of dance styles including folk, ethnic, social dance, theatrical, and so much more.\n\nThe Popular Balanchine Dossiers, (S)*MGZMD 146. Jerome Robbins Dance Division, The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.\n\nInitiated and created by the George Balanchine Foundation, this collection is an incredible source of archival resources and peer interviews regarding the atypical work of George Balanchine on Broadway and for Hollywood films. The collection contains few original artifacts, but primarily consists of research papers with photocopied documents, scripts, music, and interviews with participants of George Balanchine’s productions. The collection spans from his earliest found work in Parisian and London revues starting in 1929 through 1954 with the glamorous Hollywood films during his short stay on the west coast. Important to New York City history is the inclusion of Balanchine’s 1942 collaboration with Igor Stravinsky for the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus production number, Ballet of the Elephants, which showcased actual dancing elephants in tutus and took place at Madison Square Garden. An interesting and valuable collection since many of the participants interviewed have since passed away.\n\nKisselgoff, Anna. “GEORGE BALANCHINE, 79, DIES IN NEW YORK.” The New York Times 01 May 1983. Print.\n\nWell-known dance critic, Anna Kisselgoff, authors this lengthy obituary of the prolific 20th century choreographer, George Balanchine. Published a few days after his death in 1983, this obituary is a touching tribute as well as an educational resource to shed light on the impact George Balanchine made in the dance world as a dancer, choreographer, director, and teacher.\n\nTaper, Bernard. Balanchine, a Biography. Berkeley: U of California, 1996. Print.\n\nThere are many biographies written about choreographer George Balanchine, but this biography written by Bernard Taper and published in 1996 is especially recommended for research on the lesser-known aspects of the life of this important figure in dance history. Taper writes about legal, financial, and institutional after-effects which took place after Balanchine’s death and poses the question of whether the Balanchine choreography and aesthetic can authentically survive without the oversight of their creator. A pleasant read with wit and personality, this biography would be highly recommended."
