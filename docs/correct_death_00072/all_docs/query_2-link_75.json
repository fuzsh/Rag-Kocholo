        "text": "“The starriest event of the season... A fascinating glimpse into the varying approaches to the greatest ballet choreographer of the twentieth century.”\n\n– The New Yorker, Fall Preview\n\nThe New York Times calls Balanchine: The City Center Years, “A big, fancy party of a festival,” and expressed “the City Center years were crucial, not just for the astonishing variety and power of the works Balanchine choreographed, but also for the consolidation and expansion of his American style of classicism.”\n\nIn 1948 George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein founded New York City Ballet at City Center. It was here that Balanchine continued to develop his definitive style, which remains at the pinnacle of modern ballet. Many of Balanchine’s iconic ballets from that time had premieres at our historic theater. The thirteen different pieces chosen for this unprecedented international tribute will be performed by eight of the world’s greatest ballet companies, accompanied by the New York City Ballet Orchestra.\n\nBalanchine: The City Center Years will feature performances by American Ballet Theatre, The Joffrey Ballet, The Mariinsky Ballet, Miami City Ballet, New York City Ballet, Paris Opera Ballet, The Royal Ballet, and San Francisco Ballet.\n\nThe six distinct performances are complemented by two special Studio 5 programs on October 25 and 29, and a special archival exhibition at City Center.\n\nBalanchine: The City Center Years is part of New York City Center's 75th Anniversary Season.\n\nPREMIERE TICKETS. FESTIVAL EVENTS. INTIMATE REHEARSALS.\n\nÉtoile Circle Starting at $3,500\n\nWe invite you to be a part of the Étoile Circle to guarantee access to prime house seats, invitations to the Opening Night Party, pre-show dinner, and intimate company rehearsal. Please call 212.763.1257 or email Balanchine@NYCityCenter.org for more information.\n\nJoin the conversation #BalanchineNYCC"
