        "text": "Created in 1970 by the New York City Ballet, Who cares? is a suite of dances to songs by George and Ira Gershwin - including the “classic” that gives the piece its name and I Got Rhythm - against the backdrop of the Manhattan skyline.\n\nWho cares? combines an ensemble of dancers in various formations, followed by four soloists. All come together in a playful finale in which Balanchine wanted to show the musical genius and melodic beauty of Gershwin’s compositions through classical dance. A tribute to the grandeur of Imperial Russia, Ballet Impérial was created in 1941 by the American Ballet Caravan to Tchaikovsky’s Second Piano Concerto. A work in which George Balanchine brilliantly celebrates the technical virtuosity of academic ballet in the style of Petipa - his “spiritual father” - and the great St Petersburg tradition.\n\nArtistic team\n\nNew to the repertoire\n\nBallet impérial\n\nMusic / Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\n\nConcerto pour piano n° 2 en sol majeur, op. 44\n\nPianist / Emmanuel Strosser\n\nWho Cares?\n\nMusics / George Gershwin\n\nAdaptation and orchestration / Hershy Kay\n\nSets / Paul Gallis\n\nChoreographies / George Balanchine\n\nCostumes / Xavier Ronze\n\nLighting design / Mark Stanley\n\nMusical direction / Mikhail Agrest\n\nOrchestre de l’Opéra national de Paris\n\nCast\n\nLes Étoiles, les Premières Danseuses, les Premiers Danseurs et le Corps de Ballet de l’Opéra"
