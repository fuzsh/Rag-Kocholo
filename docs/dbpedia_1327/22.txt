Maxime de Zeeuw is the most recent acquisition of EWE Oldenburg, as the club officially announced. The international Belgian power forward has signed a contract with the Beko BBL quarterfinalists for the next season, occupying the last foreign spot in the team’s roster.

During the previous season with Nymburk, Zeeuw averaged 8.4 points, 4.6 rebounds and 2.1 assists in VTB League. “He is the kind of player that were looking for. A “4” able to compete near the board, be dangerous from a distance and secure rebounds”, said the team’s head coach Mladen Rdijencic.

Zeeuw comes in the place of Nemanja Aleksandrov, who departs from Oldenburg after three years. Once considered to be among the top Serbian talents of his generation, Aleksandrov struggled with many injury problems in his career, that never allowed him to reach his full potential.
