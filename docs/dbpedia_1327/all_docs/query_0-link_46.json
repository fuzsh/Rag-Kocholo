        "text": "Belgium vs Sweden: Analysis and Prediction – This will be the first round Olympics pre-qualification game between Belgium and Sweden.\n\nBelgium vs Sweden Odds\n\nBelgium vs Sweden (1/2): 1.47 / 2.55\n\nAsian Handicap (-4.5 / +4.5): 1.83 / 1.83\n\nTotal Over/Under (152.5): 1.83 / 1.83\n\nOdds via Bet365 Sportsbook\n\nBelgium Team News\n\nIn the course of the pre-qualifiers so far, Belgium lost to Croatia 86:55, and then to the Netherlands. “Oranje” led most of the game, but Belgium managed to come back from a deficit of -17. However, Charlon Kloof was composed in the end and scored a layup to bring win to the Netherlands.\n\nSome of the better players did not play for Belgium in these pre-qualifications. Retin Obasohan, Vrenz Bleijenbergh, Haris Bratanovic, Maxime De Zeeuw and Sam Van Rossom (retired) are some of them. Manu Lecomte has established the role of leader, and is supported by Ismael Bako, Loic Schwartz and Thijs De Ridder.\n\nFor Belgium, this match has an exceptional significance as a result, because with a victory they will almost certainly advance to the semi-finals. In addition, they play on neutral ground.\n\nSweden Team News\n\nSweden is currently at 1-1 in these pre-qualifiers. They first won against Netherlands in overtime by 91:89. Malwin Pantzar was a hero of the game, scoring 28 points. In the second game, they got blown out by Croatia by 99:67, but Pantzar got injured and didn’t play that game.\n\nSweden as usual is fielding different squads every tournament/FIBA cycle. Jonas Jerebko is banned from playing for the national team. There are also no Simon Birgander, Ludwig Hakanson, and Alexander Lindqvist.\n\nWhile Pantzar is questionable, this is a really important game for Sweden as they could get into the 2nd phase of the tournament.\n\nEvery day, “Basketball Sphere” provides all its readers with the best predictions for today’s games.\n\nIf you are reading our analysis for the first time, then it is important to mention that every day we also offer to our readers a “Acca of the Day” completely free.\n\nBelgium vs Sweden H2H\n\nThey played three times in 2016, and Belgium won two times. All three games were low scoring.\n\nAbsences and Injuries\n\nBelgium is without Obasohan, Bleijenbergh, and De Zeeuw, while Sweden is without Jerebko, Birgander, Hakanson, and Lindqvist. Pantzar is questionable for Sweden.\n\nBelgium vs Sweden Prediction\n\nSweden plays quite fast (pace factor around 74) without a particularly good defense and will certainly impose its own rhythm. Belgium play slower, but it is more likely that Sweden will dictate a pace that suits them better. The limit was exceeded in both matches of Sweden – 166 and 180 points (162 in the regular part)."
