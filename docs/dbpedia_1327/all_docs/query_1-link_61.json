Born in Norristown, Pennsylvania, he attended Norristown High School as a teenager but went virtually unrecruited by colleges to play basketball except for nearby Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Queenan was an undersized center in high school, standing at 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m), but then-assistant Lehigh coach Fran McCaffery signed him to play for the Mountain Hawks and turned him into a shooting guard/small forward (toward the end of Queenan's career at Lehigh, McCaffery said, \"You wouldn't believe how many coaches told me Daren couldn't play for them. Every coach makes mistakes, but when you say a kid can't play, and he scores 3,000 points, that's a mistake.\") McCaffery would become Lehigh's head coach for Queenan's final three seasons.\n\nSportspeople from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania · 82T\n\nOkapi Aalstar players · 43T\n\nAmerican men's basketball players · 12,045T\n\nIsmaël Bako Belgian basketball player\n\n0 0\n\nrank #6 · 1\n\nIsmaël Bako (born 10 October 1995) is a Belgian professional basketball player for Virtus Bologna of the Italian Lega Basket Serie A (LBA) and the EuroLeague.
