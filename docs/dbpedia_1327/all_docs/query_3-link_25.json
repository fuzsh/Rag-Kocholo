McGrath, Carole Planque, and Sebastiaan Luyssaert\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 771–791, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-771-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-771-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe inclusion of process-based wind-throw damage simulation in Earth system models has been hampered by the big-leaf approach, which cannot provide the canopy structure information that is required. We adapted the physics from ForestGALES to calculate CWS on large scales. The new model included several numerically efficient solutions, such as handling the landscape heterogeneity, downscaling spatially and temporally aggregated wind fields, and downscaling storm damage within the 2500 km2 pixels.\n\nRepresenting anthropogenic gross land use change, wood harvest, and forest age dynamics in a global vegetation model ORCHIDEE-MICT v8.4.2\n\nChao Yue, Philippe Ciais, Sebastiaan Luyssaert, Wei Li, Matthew J. McGrath, Jinfeng Chang, and Shushi Peng\n\nGeosci.

Global vegetation models that are used to quantify such carbon emissions from land use change traditionally rarely include shifting cultivation and secondary forest age dynamics. In this study, we expanded one vegetation model to include these features. We found that carbon emissions from land use change are estimated to be smaller.\n\nA multi-level canopy radiative transfer scheme for ORCHIDEE (SVN r2566), based on a domain-averaged structure factor\n\nMatthew J.

An adequate parametrization approach has been presented for the global-scale land surface model (ORCHIDEE-CAN). Furthermore, model performance of the new multi-layer parametrization was compared against the existing single-layer scheme.\n\nHigh-resolution land use and land cover dataset for regional climate modelling: historical and future changes in Europe\n\nPeter Hoffmann, Vanessa Reinhart, Diana Rechid, Nathalie de Noblet-DucoudrÃ©, Edouard L. Davin, Christina Asmus, Benjamin Bechtel, JÃ¼rgen BÃ¶hner, Eleni Katragkou, and Sebastiaan Luyssaert\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 15, 3819–3852, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-3819-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-3819-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper introduces the new high-resolution land use and land cover change dataset LUCAS LUC for Europe (version 1.1), tailored for use in regional climate models. Historical and projected future land use change information from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) dataset is translated into annual plant functional type changes from 1950 to 2015 and 2016 to 2100, respectively, by employing a newly developed land use translator.\n\nSimulating Bark Beetle Outbreak Dynamics and their Influence on Carbon Balance Estimates with ORCHIDEE r7791\n\nGuillaume Marie, Jina Jeong, HervÃ© Jactel, Gunnar Petter, Maxime Cailleret, Matthew McGrath, Vladislav Bastrikov, Josefine Ghattas, Bertrand Guenet, Anne-Sofie LansÃ¸, Kim Naudts, Aude Valade, Chao Yue, and Sebastiaan Luyssaert\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1216,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1216, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis research looks at how climate change influences forests, particularly how altered wind and insect activities could make forests emit, instead of absorb, carbon. We've updated a land surface model called ORCHIDEE to better examine the effect of bark beetles on forest health. Our findings suggest that sudden events, like insect outbreaks, can dramatically affect carbon storage, offering crucial insights for tackling climate change.\n\nTropical cyclones facilitate recovery of forest leaf area from dry spells in East Asia\n\nYi-Ying Chen and Sebastiaan Luyssaert\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 349–363, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-349-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-349-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTropical cyclones are typically assumed to be associated with ecosystem damage. This study challenges this assumption and suggests that instead of reducing leaf area, cyclones in East Asia may increase leaf area by alleviating water stress.\n\nReconciling different approaches to quantifying land surface temperature impacts of afforestation using satellite observations\n\nHuanhuan Wang, Chao Yue, and Sebastiaan Luyssaert\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 75–92, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-75-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-75-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study provided a synthesis of three influential methods to quantify afforestation impact on surface temperature. Results showed that actual effect following afforestation was highly dependent on afforestation fraction. When full afforestation is assumed, the actual effect approaches the potential effect. We provided evidence the afforestation faction is a key factor in reconciling different methods and emphasized that it should be considered for surface cooling impacts in policy evaluation.\n\nWorld Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) Global Lightning Climatology (WGLC) and time series, 2022 update\n\nJed O. Kaplan and Katie Hong-Kiu Lau\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 14, 5665–5670, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-5665-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-5665-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlobal lightning strokes are recorded continuously by a network of ground-based stations. We consolidated these point observations into a map form and provide these as electronic datasets for research purposes. Here we extend our dataset to include lightning observations from 2021.\n\nForest fluxes and mortality response to drought: model description (ORCHIDEE-CAN-NHA r7236) and evaluation at the CaxiuanÃ£ drought experiment\n\nYitong Yao, Emilie Joetzjer, Philippe Ciais, Nicolas Viovy, Fabio Cresto Aleina, Jerome Chave, Lawren Sack, Megan Bartlett, Patrick Meir, Rosie Fisher, and Sebastiaan Luyssaert\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 7809–7833, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-7809-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-7809-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo facilitate more mechanistic modeling of drought effects on forest dynamics, our study implements a hydraulic module to simulate the vertical water flow, change in water storage and percentage loss of stem conductance (PLC). With the relationship between PLC and tree mortality, our model can successfully reproduce the large biomass drop observed under throughfall exclusion. Our hydraulic module provides promising avenues benefiting the prediction for mortality under future drought events.\n\nThe climate and vegetation of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East during the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 years BP) based on pollen data\n\nBasil Andrew Stansfield Davis, Marc Fasel, Jed O. Kaplan, Emmanuele Russo, and Ariane Burke\n\nClim. Past Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2022-59,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2022-59, 2022\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for CP\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDuring the last Ice Age 21 k BP, Northern Europe was covered in ice and steppe, and forests were restricted to sheltered regions to the south. However, the composition and extent of forest and its associated climate remains unclear, with models indicating more forest north of the Alps than suggested by the data. A new compilation of pollen records with improved dating suggests greater agreement with model climate, but still suggests models over estimate forest cover especially in the west.\n\nHow to develop new digital knowledge transfer products for communicating strategies and new ways towards a carbon-neutral Germany\n\nSwantje Preuschmann, Tanja Blome, Knut GÃ¶rl, Fiona KÃ¶hnke, Bettina Steuri, Juliane El Zohbi, Diana Rechid, Martin Schultz, Jianing Sun, and Daniela Jacob\n\nAdv. Sci. Res., 19, 51–71, https://doi.org/10.5194/asr-19-51-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/asr-19-51-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe main aspect of the paper is to obtain transferable principles for the development of digital knowledge transfer products. As such products are still unstandardised, the authors explored challenges and approaches for product developments. The authors report what they see as useful principles for developing digital knowledge transfer products, by describing the experience of developing the Net-Zero-2050 Web-Atlas and the \"Bodenkohlenstoff-App\".\n\nConstraining a land cover map with satellite-based aboveground biomass estimates over Africa\n\nGuillaume Marie, B. Sebastiaan Luyssaert, Cecile Dardel, Thuy Le Toan, Alexandre Bouvet, StÃ©phane Mermoz, Ludovic Villard, Vladislav Bastrikov, and Philippe Peylin\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 2599–2617, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-2599-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-2599-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMost Earth system models make use of vegetation maps to initialize a simulation at global scale. Satellite-based biomass map estimates for Africa were used to estimate cover fractions for the 15 land cover classes. This study successfully demonstrates that satellite-based biomass maps can be used to better constrain vegetation maps. Applying this approach at the global scale would increase confidence in assessments of present-day biomass stocks.\n\nUsing the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) records as century-long benchmarks for global land-surface models\n\nJina Jeong, Jonathan Barichivich, Philippe Peylin, Vanessa Haverd, Matthew Joseph McGrath, Nicolas Vuichard, Michael Neil Evans, Flurin Babst, and Sebastiaan Luyssaert\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 5891–5913, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5891-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5891-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe have proposed and evaluated the use of four benchmarks that leverage tree-ring width observations to provide more nuanced verification targets for land-surface models (LSMs), which currently lack a long-term benchmark for forest ecosystem functioning. Using relatively unbiased European biomass network datasets, we identify the extent to which presumed biases in the much larger International Tree-Ring Data Bank might degrade the validation of LSMs.\n\nHigh-resolution land-use land-cover change data for regional climate modelling applications over Europe – Part 2: Historical and future changes\n\nPeter Hoffmann, Vanessa Reinhart, Diana Rechid, Nathalie de Noblet-DucoudrÃ©, Edouard L. Davin, Christina Asmus, Benjamin Bechtel, JÃ¼rgen BÃ¶hner, Eleni Katragkou, and Sebastiaan Luyssaert\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2021-252,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2021-252, 2021\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper introduces the new high-resolution land-use land-cover change dataset LUCAS LUC historical and future land use and land cover change dataset (Version 1.0), tailored for use in regional climate models. Historical and projected future land use change information from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) dataset is translated into annual plant functional type changes from 1950 to 2015 and 2016 to 2100, respectively, by employing a newly developed land use translator.\n\nDrought effects on leaf fall, leaf flushing and stem growth in the Amazon forest: reconciling remote sensing data and field observations\n\nThomas Janssen, Ype van der Velde, Florian Hofhansl, Sebastiaan Luyssaert, Kim Naudts, Bart Driessen, Katrin Fleischer, and Han Dolman\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 4445–4472, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4445-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4445-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSatellite images show that the Amazon forest has greened up during past droughts. Measurements of tree stem growth and leaf litterfall upscaled using machine-learning algorithms show that leaf flushing at the onset of a drought results in canopy rejuvenation and green-up during drought while simultaneously trees excessively shed older leaves and tree stem growth declines. Canopy green-up during drought therefore does not necessarily point to enhanced tree growth and improved forest health.\n\nThe WGLC global gridded lightning climatology and time series\n\nJed O. Kaplan and Katie Hong-Kiu Lau\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 13, 3219–3237, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-3219-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-3219-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLightning is an important atmospheric phenomenon and natural hazard, but few long-term data are freely available on lightning stroke location, timing, and power. Here, we present a new, open-access dataset of lightning strokes covering 2010–2020, based on a network of low-frequency radio detectors. The dataset is comprised of GIS maps and is intended for researchers, government, industry, and anyone for whom knowing when and where lightning is likely to strike is useful information.\n\nA triple tree-ring constraint for tree growth and physiology in a global land surface model\n\nJonathan Barichivich, Philippe Peylin, Thomas Launois, Valerie Daux, Camille Risi, Jina Jeong, and Sebastiaan Luyssaert\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 3781–3803, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-3781-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-3781-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe width and the chemical signals of tree rings have the potential to test and improve the physiological responses simulated by global land surface models, which are at the core of future climate projections. Here, we demonstrate the novel use of tree-ring width and carbon and oxygen stable isotopes to evaluate the representation of tree growth and physiology in a global land surface model at temporal scales beyond experimentation and direct observation.\n\nThe role of land cover in the climate of glacial Europe\n\nPatricio Velasquez, Jed O. Kaplan, Martina Messmer, Patrick Ludwig, and Christoph C. Raible\n\nClim. Past, 17, 1161–1180, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1161-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1161-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study assesses the importance of resolution and land–atmosphere feedbacks for European climate. We performed an asynchronously coupled experiment that combined a global climate model (~ 100 km), a regional climate model (18 km), and a dynamic vegetation model (18 km). Modelled climate and land cover agree reasonably well with independent reconstructions based on pollen and other paleoenvironmental proxies. The regional climate is significantly influenced by land cover.\n\nModelled land use and land cover change emissions â a spatio-temporal comparison of different approaches\n\nWolfgang A.

We find huge regional fLULCC differences resulting from environmental assumptions, simulated periods, and the timing of land use and land cover changes, and we argue for a method consistent across time and space and for carefully choosing the accounting period.\n\nResponse of dust emissions in southwestern North America to 21st century trends in climate, CO2 fertilization, and land use: implications for air quality\n\nYang Li, Loretta J.

Phys., 21, 57–68, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-57-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-57-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate models predict a shift toward warmer, drier environments in southwestern North America. Under future climate, the two main drivers of dust trends play opposing roles: (1) CO2 fertilization enhances vegetation and, in turn, decreases dust, and (2) increasing land use enhances dust emissions from northern Mexico. In the worst-case scenario, elevated dust concentrations spread widely over the domain by 2100 in spring, suggesting a large climate penalty on air quality and human health.\n\nHarmonization of global land use change and management for the period 850â2100 (LUH2) for CMIP6\n\nGeorge C.

Model Dev., 13, 5425–5464, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-5425-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-5425-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo estimate the effects of human land use activities on the carbon–climate system, a new set of global gridded land use forcing datasets was developed to link historical land use data to eight future scenarios in a standard format required by climate models. This new generation of land use harmonization (LUH2) includes updated inputs, higher spatial resolution, more detailed land use transitions, and the addition of important agricultural management layers; it will be used for CMIP6 simulations.\n\nTropospheric ozone radiative forcing uncertainty due to pre-industrial fire and biogenic emissions\n\nMatthew J. Rowlinson, Alexandru Rap, Douglas S. Hamilton, Richard J. Pope, Stijn Hantson, Steve R. Arnold, Jed O. Kaplan, Almut Arneth, Martyn P. Chipperfield, Piers M. Forster, and Lars Nieradzik\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 10937–10951, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-10937-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-10937-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTropospheric ozone is an important greenhouse gas which contributes to anthropogenic climate change; however, the effect of human emissions is uncertain because pre-industrial ozone concentrations are not well understood. We use revised inventories of pre-industrial natural emissions to estimate the human contribution to changes in tropospheric ozone. We find that tropospheric ozone radiative forcing is up to 34 % lower when using improved pre-industrial biomass burning and vegetation emissions.\n\nTrends and spatial shifts in lightning fires and smoke concentrations in response to 21st century climate over the national forests and parks of the western United States\n\nYang Li, Loretta J. Mickley, Pengfei Liu, and Jed O. Kaplan\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 8827–8838, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-8827-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-8827-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing a coupled vegetation–fire–climate modeling framework, we show a northward shift in forests and increased lightning fire activity in northern US states, including Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. Our findings suggest a large climate penalty on ecosystem, air quality, visibility, and human health in a region valued for its national forests and parks. The fine-scale smoke PM predictions provided in this study should prove useful to human health and environmental assessments.\n\nDrought resistance increases from the individual to the ecosystem level in highly diverse Neotropical rainforest: a meta-analysis of leaf, tree and ecosystem responses to drought\n\nThomas Janssen, Katrin Fleischer, Sebastiaan Luyssaert, Kim Naudts, and Han Dolman\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 2621–2645, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2621-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2621-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe frequency and severity of droughts are expected to increase in the tropics, impacting the functioning of tropical forests. Here, we synthesized observed responses to drought in Neotropical forests. We find that, during drought, trees generally close their leaf stomata, resulting in reductions in photosynthesis, growth and transpiration. However, on the ecosystem scale, these responses are not visible. This indicates that resistance to drought increases from the leaf to ecosystem scale.\n\nBehind the scenes of an interdisciplinary effort: conception, design and production of a flyer on climate change for the citizens of Hamburg\n\nBettina Steuri, Tanja Blome, Katharina BÃ¼low, Juliane El Zohbi, Peter Hoffmann, Juliane Petersen, Susanne Pfeifer, Diana Rechid, and Daniela Jacob\n\nAdv. Sci.

Therefore, a flyer was created that is understandable to non-climate scientists, visually attractive and generates interest. In this article, the authors provide insights into their teamwork, the underlying guiding principles as well as lessons learned that are of great value for future projects.\n\nDevelopment and testing scenarios for implementing land use and land cover changes during the Holocene in Earth system model experiments\n\nSandy P.

We describe how archaeological data are used to map land use change and how the maps can be evaluated using independent palaeoenvironmental data. We propose simulations to test land use and land cover change impacts on past climates.\n\nA spatially explicit database of wind disturbances in European forests over the periodÂ 2000â2018\n\nGiovanni Forzieri, Matteo Pecchi, Marco Girardello, Achille Mauri, Marcus Klaus, Christo Nikolov, Marius RÃ¼etschi, Barry Gardiner, JuliÃ¡n TomaÅ¡tÃ­k, David Small, Constantin Nistor, Donatas Jonikavicius, Jonathan Spinoni, Luc Feyen, Francesca Giannetti, Rinaldo Comino, Alessandro Wolynski, Francesco Pirotti, Fabio Maistrelli, Ionut Savulescu, StÃ©phanie Wurpillot-Lucas, Stefan Karlsson, Karolina Zieba-Kulawik, Paulina Strejczek-Jazwinska, Martin MokroÅ¡, Stefan Franz, Lukas Krejci, Ionel Haidu, Mats Nilsson, Piotr Wezyk, Filippo Catani, Yi-Ying Chen, Sebastiaan Luyssaert, Gherardo Chirici, Alessandro Cescatti, and Pieter S.

Despite the importance of this natural disturbance and possible intensification in view of climate change, spatial information about wind-related impacts is currently missing on a pan-European scale. We present a new database of wind disturbances in European forests comprised of more than 80 000 records over the period 2000–2018. Our database is a unique spatial source for the study of forest disturbances at large scales.\n\nAccounting for forest age in the tile-based dynamic global vegetation model JSBACH4 (4.20p7; git feature/forests) â a land surface model for the ICON-ESM\n\nJulia E.

We present a consolidated scheme to introduce forest age classes, combining age-dependent simulations of important processes with the possibility to trace forest age, and describe its implementation in JSBACH4, the land surface model of the ICON Earth system model. We evaluate simulations with and without age classes demonstrating the benefit of forest age classes in JSBACH4.\n\nGlobal Carbon Budget 2019\n\nPierre Friedlingstein, Matthew W.

These living data are updated every year to provide the highest transparency and traceability in the reporting of CO2, the key driver of climate change.\n\nAccounting for carbon and nitrogen interactions in the global terrestrial ecosystem model ORCHIDEE (trunk version, rev 4999): multi-scale evaluation of gross primary production\n\nNicolas Vuichard, Palmira Messina, Sebastiaan Luyssaert, Bertrand Guenet, SÃ¶nke Zaehle, Josefine Ghattas, Vladislav Bastrikov, and Philippe Peylin\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 4751–4779, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-4751-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-4751-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this research, we present a new version of the global terrestrial ecosystem model ORCHIDEE in which carbon and nitrogen cycles are coupled. We evaluate its skills at simulating primary production at 78 sites and at a global scale. Based on a set of additional simulations in which carbon and nitrogen cycles are coupled and uncoupled, we show that the functional responses of the model with carbon–nitrogen interactions better agree with our current understanding of photosynthesis.\n\nEffects of land use and anthropogenic aerosol emissions in the Roman Empire\n\nAnina Gilgen, Stiig Wilkenskjeld, Jed O. Kaplan, Thomas KÃ¼hn, and Ulrike Lohmann\n\nClim. Past, 15, 1885–1911, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-15-1885-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-15-1885-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing the global aerosol–climate model ECHAM-HAM-SALSA, the effect of humans on European climate in the Roman Empire was quantified. Both land use and novel estimates of anthropogenic aerosol emissions were considered. We conducted simulations with fixed sea-surface temperatures to gain a first impression about the anthropogenic impact. While land use effects induced a regional warming for one of the reconstructions, aerosol emissions led to a cooling associated with aerosol–cloud interactions.\n\nDifferent response of surface temperature and air temperature to deforestation in climate models\n\nJohannes Winckler, Christian H. Reick, Sebastiaan Luyssaert, Alessandro Cescatti, Paul C. Stoy, Quentin Lejeune, Thomas Raddatz, Andreas Chlond, Marvin Heidkamp, and Julia Pongratz\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 10, 473–484, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-473-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-473-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor local living conditions, it matters whether deforestation influences the surface temperature, temperature at 2 m, or the temperature higher up in the atmosphere. Here, simulations with a climate model show that at a location of deforestation, surface temperature generally changes more strongly than atmospheric temperature. Comparison across climate models shows that both for summer and winter the surface temperature response exceeds the air temperature response locally by a factor of 2.\n\nThe importance of tree demography and root water uptake for modelling the carbon and water cycles of Amazonia\n\nEmilie Joetzjer, Fabienne Maignan, JÃ©rÃ´me Chave, Daniel Goll, Ben Poulter, Jonathan Barichivich, Isabelle MarÃ©chaux, Sebastiaan Luyssaert, Matthieu Guimberteau, Kim Naudts, Damien Bonal, and Philippe Ciais\n\nBiogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2018-308,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2018-308, 2018\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study explores the relative contributions of tree demographic, canopy structure and hydraulic processes on the Amazonian carbon and water cycles using large-scale process-based model. Our results imply that explicit coupling of the water and carbon cycles improves the representation of biogeochemical cycles and their spatial variability. Representing the variation in the ecological functioning of Amazonia should be the next step to improve the performance and predictive ability of models.\n\nORCHIDEE-SOM: modeling soil organic carbon (SOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics along vertical soil profiles in Europe\n\nMarta Camino-Serrano, Bertrand Guenet, Sebastiaan Luyssaert, Philippe Ciais, Vladislav Bastrikov, Bruno De Vos, Bert Gielen, Gerd Gleixner, Albert Jornet-Puig, Klaus Kaiser, Dolly Kothawala, Ronny Lauerwald, Josep PeÃ±uelas, Marion Schrumpf, Sara Vicca, Nicolas Vuichard, David Walmsley, and Ivan A. Janssens\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 937–957, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-937-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-937-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlobal models generally oversimplify the representation of soil organic carbon (SOC), and thus its response to global warming remains uncertain. We present the new soil module ORCHIDEE-SOM, within the global model ORCHIDEE, that refines the representation of SOC dynamics and includes the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) processes. The model is able to reproduce SOC stocks and DOC concentrations in four different ecosystems, opening an opportunity for improved predictions of SOC in global models.\n\nThe pyrogeography of eastern boreal Canada from 1901 to 2012 simulated with the LPJ-LMfire model\n\nEmeline Chaste, Martin P. Girardin, Jed O. Kaplan, Jeanne Portier, Yves Bergeron, and Christelle HÃ©ly\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 1273–1292, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-1273-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-1273-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA vegetation model was used to reconstruct fire activity from 1901 to 2012 in relation to changes in lightning ignition, climate, and vegetation in eastern Canada's boreal forest. The model correctly simulated the history of fire activity. The results showed that fire activity is ignition limited but is also greatly affected by both climate and vegetation. This research aims to develop a vegetation model that could be used to predict the future impacts of climate changes on fire activity.\n\nSimulating damage for wind storms in the land surface model ORCHIDEE-CAN (revision 4262)\n\nYi-Ying Chen, Barry Gardiner, Ferenc Pasztor, Kristina Blennow, James Ryder, Aude Valade, Kim Naudts, Juliane Otto, Matthew J. McGrath, Carole Planque, and Sebastiaan Luyssaert\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 771–791, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-771-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-771-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe inclusion of process-based wind-throw damage simulation in Earth system models has been hampered by the big-leaf approach, which cannot provide the canopy structure information that is required. We adapted the physics from ForestGALES to calculate CWS on large scales. The new model included several numerically efficient solutions, such as handling the landscape heterogeneity, downscaling spatially and temporally aggregated wind fields, and downscaling storm damage within the 2500 km2 pixels.\n\nRepresenting anthropogenic gross land use change, wood harvest, and forest age dynamics in a global vegetation model ORCHIDEE-MICT v8.4.2\n\nChao Yue, Philippe Ciais, Sebastiaan Luyssaert, Wei Li, Matthew J. McGrath, Jinfeng Chang, and Shushi Peng\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 409–428, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-409-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-409-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHuman alteration of land cover has caused CO2 that is stored in forest biomass and soil to be released into the atmosphere and thus contribute to global warming. Global vegetation models that are used to quantify such carbon emissions from land use change traditionally rarely include shifting cultivation and secondary forest age dynamics. In this study, we expanded one vegetation model to include these features. We found that carbon emissions from land use change are estimated to be smaller.\n\nThe PMIP4 contribution to CMIP6 â Part 3: The last millennium, scientific objective, and experimental design for the PMIP4 past1000 simulations\n\nJohann H.

They can help identify plausible mechanisms underlying palaeoclimatic reconstructions. Here, we describe the forcing boundary conditions and the experimental protocol for simulations covering the pre-industrial millennium. We describe the PMIP4 past1000 simulations as contributions to CMIP6 and additional sensitivity experiments.\n\nA globally calibrated scheme for generating daily meteorology from monthly statistics: Global-WGEN (GWGEN)Â v1.0\n\nPhilipp S.

A number of different methods have been developed to represent vegetation burning. This paper describes the protocol for the first systematic comparison of global fire models, which will allow the community to explore various drivers and evaluate what mechanisms are important for improving performance. It also includes equations for all models.\n\nA multi-level canopy radiative transfer scheme for ORCHIDEE (SVN r2566), based on a domain-averaged structure factor\n\nMatthew J.

An overall increasing trend was detected in the organic layers, but no overall trend was found in the mineral horizons. There are strong interactions between controls acting at local and regional scales. Our findings are relevant for researchers focusing on the link between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and for C-cycle models.\n\nEvaluating the performance of land surface model ORCHIDEE-CANÂ v1.0 on water and energy flux estimation with a single- and multi-layer energy budget scheme\n\nYiying Chen, James Ryder, Vladislav Bastrikov, Matthew J.

An adequate parametrization approach has been presented for the global-scale land surface model (ORCHIDEE-CAN). Furthermore, model performance of the new multi-layer parametrization was compared against the existing single-layer scheme.\n\nThe status and challenge of global fire modelling\n\nStijn Hantson, Almut Arneth, Sandy P.

A large variety of models exist, and it is unclear which type of model or degree of complexity is required to model fire adequately at regional to global scales. In this paper we summarize the current state of the art in fire-regime modelling and model evaluation, and outline what lessons may be learned from the Fire Model Intercomparison Project – FireMIP.\n\nThe biogeophysical climatic impacts of anthropogenic land use change during the Holocene\n\nM.

Our results show statistically significant surface temperature changes (mainly cooling) from as early as 7000 BP in the JJA season and throughout the entire annual cycle by 2–3000 BP. The changes were greatest in the areas of land use change but were also seen in other areas. Precipitation was also affected, particularly in Europe, India, and the ITCZ region.\n\nModeling spatiotemporal dynamics of global wetlands: comprehensive evaluation of a new sub-grid TOPMODEL parameterization and uncertainties\n\nZhen Zhang, Niklaus E. Zimmermann, Jed O. Kaplan, and Benjamin Poulter\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 1387–1408, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-1387-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-1387-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates improvements and uncertainties associated with estimating global inundated area and wetland CH4 emissions using TOPMODEL. Different topographic information and catchment aggregation schemes are evaluated against seasonal and permanently inundated wetland observations. Reducing uncertainty in prognostic wetland dynamics modeling must take into account forcing data as well as topographic scaling schemes.\n\nA multi-layer land surface energy budget model for implicit coupling with global atmospheric simulations\n\nJ.

Yet uncertainties remain about its past variations, its controlling factors, and the radiative forcing of short-lived species it influences. To reduce these uncertainties, we must better quantify the natural emissions and chemical reaction mechanisms of organic compounds in the atmosphere, which play a role in governing the oxidative capacity.\n\nA vertically discretised canopy description for ORCHIDEE (SVN r2290) and the modifications to the energy, water and carbon fluxes\n\nK.

To address this gap in modelling capability, we developed and parametrised a land-surface model to simulate biogeochemical and biophysical effects of forest management. Comparison of model output against data showed an increased model performance in reproducing large-scale spatial patterns and inter-annual variability over Europe.\n\nWETCHIMP-WSL: intercomparison of wetland methane emissions models over West Siberia\n\nT.

In addition to assembling a definitive collection of methane emissions estimates for the region, we were able to identify the types of wetland maps and model features necessary for accurate simulations of high-latitude wetlands.\n\nORCHIDEE-SRC v1.0: an extension of the land surface model ORCHIDEE for simulating short rotation coppice poplar plantations\n\nT.

The modifications presented in this paper were evaluated using data from two Belgian poplar-based SRC sites, for which multiple measurements and meteorological data were available. The simulations show that the model predicts aboveground biomass production, ecosystem photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration well.\n\nThe influence of atmospheric circulation on the mid-Holocene climate of Europe: a dataâmodel comparison\n\nA.

Understanding this future response is vital to successfully meeting Paris Agreement targets, which rely heavily on carbon uptake by the land surface. In this study, the individual responses of soil carbon are quantified and compared amongst CMIP6 Earth system models used within the most recent IPCC report, and the role of soils in the land response is highlighted.\n\nMonitoring the impact of forest changes on carbon uptake with solar-induced fluorescence measurements from GOME-2A and TROPOMI for an Australian and Chinese case study\n\nJuliÃ«tte C. S. Anema, Klaas Folkert Boersma, Piet Stammes, Gerbrand Koren, William Woodgate, Philipp KÃ¶hler, Christian Frankenberg, and Jacqui Stol\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 2297–2311, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2297-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2297-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo keep the Paris agreement goals within reach, negative emissions are necessary. They can be achieved with mitigation techniques, such as reforestation, which remove CO2 from the atmosphere. While governments have pinned their hopes on them, there is not yet a good set of tools to objectively determine whether negative emissions do what they promise. Here we show how satellite measurements of plant fluorescence are useful in detecting carbon uptake due to reforestation and vegetation regrowth.\n\nTechnical note: Flagging inconsistencies in flux tower data\n\nMartin Jung, Jacob Nelson, Mirco Migliavacca, Tarek El-Madany, Dario Papale, Markus Reichstein, Sophia Walther, and Thomas Wutzler\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 1827–1846, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1827-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1827-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a methodology to detect inconsistencies in perhaps the most important data source for measurements of ecosystem–atmosphere carbon, water, and energy fluxes. We expect that the derived consistency flags will be relevant for data users and will help in improving our understanding of and our ability to model ecosystem–climate interactions.\n\nRelevance of near-surface soil moisture vs. terrestrial water storage for global vegetation functioning\n\nPrajwal Khanal, Anne J. Hoek Van Dijke, Timo Schaffhauser, Wantong Li, Sinikka J.

This study correlates vegetation growth with soil moisture availability globally to infer vegetation water uptake depth using only satellite-based data. We find that the vegetation water uptake depth varies across climate regimes and vegetation types and also changes during dry months at a global scale.\n\nImplications of climate and litter quality for simulations of litterbag decomposition at high latitudes\n\nElin Ristorp Aas, Inge Althuizen, Hui Tang, Sonya Geange, Eva Lieungh, Vigdis Vandvik, and Terje Koren Berntsen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-340,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-340, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used a soil model to replicate two litterbag decomposition experiments to examine the implications of climate, litter quality, and soil microclimate representation. We found that macroclimate was more important than litter quality for modeled mass loss. By comparing different representations of soil temperature and moisture we found that using observed data did not improve model results. We discuss causes for this and suggest possible improvements to both model and experimental design.\n\nHigh-resolution spatial patterns and drivers of terrestrial ecosystem carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide fluxes in the tundra\n\nAnna-Maria Virkkala, Pekka Niittynen, Julia Kemppinen, Maija E.

We combined extensive in situ measurements and remote sensing data to develop machine-learning models to predict GHG fluxes at a 2 m resolution across a tundra landscape. The analysis revealed that the system was a net GHG sink and showed widespread CH4 uptake in upland vegetation types, almost surpassing the high wetland CH4 emissions at the landscape scale.\n\nLong-term additions of ammonium nitrate to montane forest ecosystems may cause limited soil acidification, even in the presence of soil carbonate\n\nThomas Baer, Gerhard Furrer, Stephan Zimmermann, and Patrick Schleppi\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 4577–4589, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4577-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4577-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNitrogen (N) deposition to forest ecosystems is a matter of concern because it affects their nutrient status and makes their soil acidic. We observed an ongoing acidification in a montane forest in central Switzerland even if the subsoil of this site contains carbonates and is thus well buffered. We experimentally added N to simulate a higher pollution, and this increased the acidification. After 25 years of study, however, we can see the first signs of recovery, also under higher N deposition.\n\nLeaf carbon and nitrogen stoichiometric variation along environmental gradients\n\nHuiying Xu, Han Wang, Iain Colin Prentice, and Sandy P.

This study reconciled the roles of phylogeny, species identity, and climate in stoichiometric traits at individual and community levels. The variations in community-level leaf N and C : N ratio were captured by optimality-based models using climate data. Our results provide an approach to improve the representation of leaf stoichiometry in vegetation models to better couple N with C cycling.\n\nGross primary productivity and the predictability of CO2: more uncertainty in what we predict than how well we predict it\n\nIstvÃ¡n Dunkl, Nicole Lovenduski, Alessio Collalti, Vivek K. Arora, Tatiana Ilyina, and Victor Brovkin\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 3523–3538, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3523-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3523-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDespite differences in the reproduction of gross primary productivity (GPP) by Earth system models (ESMs), ESMs have similar predictability of the global carbon cycle. We found that, although GPP variability originates from different regions and is driven by different climatic variables across the ESMs, the ESMs rely on the same mechanisms to predict their own GPP. This shows that the predictability of the carbon cycle is limited by our understanding of variability rather than predictability.\n\nScale variance in the carbon dynamics of fragmented, mixed-use landscapes estimated using modelâdata fusion\n\nDavid T. Milodowski, T. Luke Smallman, and Mathew Williams\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 3301–3327, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3301-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3301-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModel–data fusion (MDF) allows us to combine ecosystem models with Earth observation data. Fragmented landscapes, with a mosaic of contrasting ecosystems, pose a challenge for MDF. We develop a novel MDF framework to estimate the carbon balance of fragmented landscapes and show the importance of accounting for ecosystem heterogeneity to prevent scale-dependent bias in estimated carbon fluxes, disturbance fluxes in particular, and to improve ecological fidelity of the calibrated models.\n\nSeasonal controls override forest harvesting effects on the composition of dissolved organic matter mobilized from boreal forest soil organic horizons\n\nKeri L. Bowering, Kate A. Edwards, and Susan E. Ziegler\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2189–2206, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2189-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2189-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDissolved organic matter (DOM) mobilized from surface soils is a source of carbon (C) for deeper mineral horizons but also a mechanism of C loss. Composition of DOM mobilized in boreal forests varied more by season than as a result of forest harvesting. Results suggest reduced snowmelt and increased fall precipitation enhance DOM properties promoting mineral soil C stores. These findings, coupled with hydrology, can inform on soil C fate and boreal forest C balance in response to climate change.\n\nCarbon cycle extremes accelerate weakening of the land carbon sink in the late 21st century\n\nBharat Sharma, Jitendra Kumar, Auroop R.

The impact of such climate extremes is detrimental to terrestrial carbon uptake capacity. We found that due to overall climate warming, about 88 % of the world's regions towards the end of 2100 will show anomalous losses in net biospheric productivity (NBP) rather than gains. More than 50 % of all negative NBP extremes were driven by the compound effect of dry, hot, and fire conditions.\n\nEstimating oil-palmÂ Si storage,Â Si return to soils, andÂ Si losses through harvest in smallholder oil-palm plantations of Sumatra, Indonesia\n\nBritta Greenshields, Barbara von der LÃ¼he, Felix Schwarz, Harold J.

In this study, we quantified Si concentrations in various parts of an oil palm (leaflets, rachises, fruit-bunch parts) to derive Si storage estimates for the total above-ground biomass of an oil palm and 1 ha of an oil-palm plantation. We proposed a Si balance by identifying Si return (via palm fronds) and losses (via harvest) in the system and recommend management measures that enhance Si cycling.\n\nAssessing the sensitivity of multi-frequency passive microwave vegetation optical depth to vegetation properties\n\nLuisa Schmidt, Matthias Forkel, Ruxandra-Maria Zotta, Samuel Scherrer, Wouter A. Dorigo, Alexander Kuhn-RÃ©gnier, Robin van der Schalie, and Marta Yebra\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 1027–1046, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1027-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1027-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVegetation attenuates natural microwave emissions from the land surface. The strength of this attenuation is quantified as the vegetation optical depth (VOD) parameter and is influenced by the vegetation mass, structure, water content, and observation wavelength. Here we model the VOD signal as a multi-variate function of several descriptive vegetation variables. The results help in understanding the effects of ecosystem properties on VOD.\n\nSeasonal variation of mercury concentration of ancient olive groves of Lebanon\n\nNagham Tabaja, David Amouroux, Lamis Chalak, FranÃ§ois Fourel, Emmanuel Tessier, Ihab Jomaa, Milad El Riachy, and Ilham Bentaleb\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 619–633, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-619-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-619-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates the seasonality of the mercury (Hg) concentration of olive trees. Hg concentrations of foliage, stems, soil surface, and litter were analyzed on a monthly basis in ancient olive trees growing in two groves in Lebanon. Our study draws an adequate baseline for the eastern Mediterranean and for the region with similar climatic inventories on Hg vegetation uptake in addition to being a baseline for new studies on olive trees in the Mediterranean.\n\nSoil organic matter diagenetic state informs boreal forest ecosystem feedbacks to climate change\n\nAllison N. Myers-Pigg, Karl Kaiser, Ronald Benner, and Susan E. Ziegler\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 489–503, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-489-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-489-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBoreal forests, historically a global sink for atmospheric CO2, store carbon in vast soil reservoirs. To predict how such stores will respond to climate warming we need to understand climate–ecosystem feedbacks. We find boreal forest soil carbon stores are maintained through enhanced nitrogen cycling with climate warming, providing direct evidence for a key feedback. Further application of the approach demonstrated here will improve our understanding of the limits of climate–ecosystem feedbacks.\n\nUpscaling dryland carbon and water fluxes with artificial neural networks of optical, thermal, and microwave satellite remote sensing\n\nMatthew P. Dannenberg, Mallory L. Barnes, William K. Smith, Miriam R. Johnston, Susan K. Meerdink, Xian Wang, Russell L. Scott, and Joel A. Biederman\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 383–404, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-383-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-383-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEarth's drylands provide ecosystem services to many people and will likely be strongly affected by climate change, but it is quite challenging to monitor the productivity and water use of dryland plants with satellites. We developed and tested an approach for estimating dryland vegetation activity using machine learning to combine information from multiple satellite sensors. Our approach excelled at estimating photosynthesis and water use largely due to the inclusion of satellite soil moisture.\n\nSun-induced fluorescence as a proxy for primary productivity across vegetation types and climates\n\nMark Pickering, Alessandro Cescatti, and Gregory Duveiller\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 4833–4864, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4833-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-4833-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study explores two of the most recent products in carbon productivity estimation, FLUXCOM gross primary productivity (GPP), calculated by upscaling local measurements of CO2 exchange, and remotely sensed sun-induced chlorophyll a fluorescence (SIF). High-resolution SIF data are valuable in demonstrating similarity in the SIF–GPP relationship between vegetation covers, provide an independent probe of the FLUXCOM GPP model and demonstrate the response of SIF to meteorological fluctuations.\n\nTechnical note: A view from space on global flux towers by MODIS and Landsat: the FluxnetEO data set\n\nSophia Walther, Simon Besnard, Jacob Allen Nelson, Tarek Sebastian El-Madany, Mirco Migliavacca, Ulrich Weber, Nuno Carvalhais, Sofia Lorena Ermida, Christian BrÃ¼mmer, Frederik Schrader, Anatoly Stanislavovich Prokushkin, Alexey Vasilevich Panov, and Martin Jung\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 2805–2840, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2805-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2805-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSatellite observations help interpret station measurements of local carbon, water, and energy exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere and are indispensable for simulations of the same in land surface models and their evaluation. We propose generalisable and efficient approaches to systematically ensure high quality and to estimate values in data gaps. We apply them to satellite data of surface reflectance and temperature with different resolutions at the stations.\n\nChanging sub-Arctic tundra vegetation upon permafrost degradation: impact on foliar mineral element cycling\n\nElisabeth Mauclet, Yannick Agnan, Catherine Hirst, Arthur Monhonval, BenoÃ®t Pereira, Aubry Vandeuren, MaÃ«lle Villani, Justin Ledman, Meghan Taylor, Briana L. Jasinski, Edward A. G. Schuur, and Sophie Opfergelt\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 2333–2351, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2333-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2333-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nArctic warming and permafrost degradation largely affect tundra vegetation. Wetter lowlands show an increase in sedges, whereas drier uplands favor shrub expansion. Here, we demonstrate that the difference in the foliar elemental composition of typical tundra vegetation species controls the change in local foliar elemental stock and potential mineral element cycling through litter production upon a shift in tundra vegetation.\n\nLand Management Contributes significantly to observed Vegetation Browning in Syria during 2001â2018\n\nTiexi Chen, Renjie Guo, Qingyun Yan, Xin Chen, Shengjie Zhou, Chuanzhuang Liang, Xueqiong Wei, and Han Dolman\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 1515–1525, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-1515-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-1515-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCurrently people are very concerned about vegetation changes and their driving factors, including natural and anthropogenic drivers. In this study, a general browning trend is found in Syria during 2001â2018, indicated by the vegetation index. We found that land management caused by social unrest is the main cause of this browning phenomenon. The mechanism initially reported here highlights the importance of land management impacts at the regional scale.\n\nMODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields tree cover needs calibrating in tropical savannas\n\nRahayu Adzhar, Douglas I. Kelley, Ning Dong, Charles George, Mireia Torello Raventos, Elmar Veenendaal, Ted R. Feldpausch, Oliver L. Phillips, Simon L. Lewis, Bonaventure SonkÃ©, Herman Taedoumg, Beatriz Schwantes Marimon, Tomas Domingues, Luzmila Arroyo, Gloria Djagbletey, Gustavo Saiz, and France Gerard\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 1377–1394, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-1377-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-1377-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) product underestimates tree cover compared to field data and could be underestimating tree cover significantly across the tropics. VCF is used to represent land cover or validate model performance in many land surface and global vegetation models and to train finer-scaled Earth observation products. Because underestimation in VCF may render it unsuitable for training data and bias model predictions, it should be calibrated before use in the tropics.\n\nAssessing the representation of the Australian carbon cycle in global vegetation models\n\nLina Teckentrup, Martin G. De Kauwe, Andrew J. Pitman, Daniel S. Goll, Vanessa Haverd, Atul K. Jain, Emilie Joetzjer, Etsushi Kato, Sebastian Lienert, Danica Lombardozzi, Patrick C. McGuire, Joe R. Melton, Julia E. M. S. Nabel, Julia Pongratz, Stephen Sitch, Anthony P. Walker, and SÃ¶nke Zaehle\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 5639–5668, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5639-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5639-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Australian continent is included in global assessments of the carbon cycle such as the global carbon budget, yet the performance of dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) over Australia has rarely been evaluated. We assessed simulations by an ensemble of dynamic global vegetation models over Australia and highlighted a number of key areas that lead to model divergence on both short (inter-annual) and long (decadal) timescales.\n\nAssessing the response of soil carbon in Australia to changing inputs and climate using a consistent modelling framework\n\nJuhwan Lee, Raphael A. Viscarra Rossel, Mingxi Zhang, Zhongkui Luo, and Ying-Ping Wang\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 5185–5202, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5185-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5185-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe performed Roth C simulations across Australia and assessed the response of soil carbon to changing inputs and future climate change using a consistent modelling framework. Site-specific initialisation of the C pools with measurements of the C fractions is essential for accurate simulations of soil organic C stocks and composition at a large scale. With further warming, Australian soils will become more vulnerable to C loss: natural environments > native grazing > cropping > modified grazing.\n\nReviews and syntheses: Ongoing and emerging opportunities to improve environmental science using observations from the Advanced Baseline Imager on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites\n\nAnam M. Khan, Paul C. Stoy, James T. Douglas, Martha Anderson, George Diak, Jason A. Otkin, Christopher Hain, Elizabeth M. Rehbein, and Joel McCorkel\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 4117–4141, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4117-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4117-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRemote sensing has played an important role in the study of land surface processes. Geostationary satellites, such as the GOES-R series, can observe the Earth every 5–15 min, providing us with more observations than widely used polar-orbiting satellites. Here, we outline current efforts utilizing geostationary observations in environmental science and look towards the future of GOES observations in the carbon cycle, ecosystem disturbance, and other areas of application in environmental science.\n\nFirst pan-Arctic assessment of dissolved organic carbon in lakes of the permafrost region\n\nLydia Stolpmann, Caroline Coch, Anne Morgenstern, Julia Boike, Michael Fritz, Ulrike Herzschuh, Kathleen Stoof-Leichsenring, Yury Dvornikov, Birgit Heim, Josefine Lenz, Amy Larsen, Katey Walter Anthony, Benjamin Jones, Karen Frey, and Guido Grosse\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 3917–3936, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-3917-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-3917-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur new database summarizes DOC concentrations of 2167 water samples from 1833 lakes in permafrost regions across the Arctic to provide insights into linkages between DOC and environment. We found increasing lake DOC concentration with decreasing permafrost extent and higher DOC concentrations in boreal permafrost sites compared to tundra sites. Our study shows that DOC concentration depends on the environmental properties of a lake, especially permafrost extent, ecoregion, and vegetation.\n\nThe impact of wildfire on biogeochemical fluxes and water quality in boreal catchments\n\nGustaf Granath, Christopher D. Evans, Joachim Strengbom, Jens FÃ¶lster, Achim Grelle, Johan StrÃ¶mqvist, and Stephan J. KÃ¶hler\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 3243–3261, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-3243-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-3243-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe measured element losses and impacts on water quality following a wildfire in Sweden. We observed the largest carbon and nitrogen losses during the fire and a strong pulse of elements 1â3 months after the fire that showed a fast (weeks) and a slow (months) release from the catchments. Total carbon export through water did not increase post-fire. Overall, we observed a rapid recovery of the biogeochemical cycling of elements within 3 years but still an annual net release of carbon dioxide.\n\nExamining the sensitivity of the terrestrial carbon cycle to the expression of El NiÃ±o\n\nLina Teckentrup, Martin G. De Kauwe, Andrew J. Pitman, and Benjamin Smith\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 2181–2203, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2181-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2181-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe El NiÃ±o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) describes changes in the sea surface temperature patterns of the Pacific Ocean. This influences the global weather, impacting vegetation on land. There are two types of El NiÃ±o: central Pacific (CP) and eastern Pacific (EP). In this study, we explored the long-term impacts on the carbon balance on land linked to the two El NiÃ±o types. Using a dynamic vegetation model, we simulated what would happen if only either CP or EP El NiÃ±o events had occurred.\n\nSubalpine grassland productivity increased with warmer and drier conditions, but not with higher N deposition, in an altitudinal transplantation experiment\n\nMatthias Volk, Matthias Suter, Anne-Lena Wahl, and Seraina Bassin\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 2075–2090, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2075-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2075-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGrassland ecosystem services like forage production and greenhouse gas storage in the soil depend on plant growth. In an experiment in the mountains with warming treatments, we found that despite dwindling soil water content, the grassland growth increased with up to +1.3 °C warming (annual mean) compared to present temperatures. Even at +2.4 °C the growth was still larger than at the reference site. This suggests that plant growth will increase due to global warming in the near future.\n\nReviews and syntheses: Impacts of plant-silicaâherbivore interactions on terrestrial biogeochemical cycling\n\nBernice C. Hwang and Daniel B. Metcalfe\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 1259–1268, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-1259-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-1259-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDespite growing recognition of herbivores as important ecosystem engineers, many major gaps remain in our understanding of how silicon and herbivory interact to shape biogeochemical processes. We highlight the need for more research particularly in natural settings as well as on the potential effects of herbivory on terrestrial silicon cycling to understand potentially critical animal–plant–soil feedbacks.\n\nImplementation of nitrogen cycle in the CLASSIC land model\n\nAli Asaadi and Vivek K. Arora\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 669–706, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-669-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-669-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMore than a quarter of the current anthropogenic CO2 emissions are taken up by land, reducing the atmospheric CO2 growth rate. This is because of the CO2 fertilization effect which benefits 80 % of global vegetation. However, if nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients cannot keep up with increasing atmospheric CO2, the magnitude of this terrestrial ecosystem service may reduce in future. This paper implements nitrogen constraints on photosynthesis in a model to understand the mechanisms involved.\n\nCombined effects of ozone and drought stress on the emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds from Quercus roburÂ L.\n\nArianna Peron, Lisa Kaser, Anne Charlott Fitzky, Martin Graus, Heidi Halbwirth, JÃ¼rgen Greiner, Georg Wohlfahrt, Boris Rewald, Hans SandÃ©n, and Thomas Karl\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 535–556, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-535-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-535-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDrought events are expected to become more frequent with climate change. Along with these events atmospheric ozone is also expected to increase. Both can stress plants. Here we investigate to what extent these factors modulate the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from oak plants. We find an antagonistic effect between drought stress and ozone, impacting the emission of different BVOCs, which is indirectly controlled by stomatal opening, allowing plants to control their water budget.\n\nA bottom-up quantification of foliar mercury uptake fluxes across Europe\n\nLena Wohlgemuth, Stefan Osterwalder, Carl Joseph, Ansgar Kahmen, GÃ¼nter Hoch, Christine Alewell, and Martin Jiskra\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 6441–6456, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-6441-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-6441-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMercury uptake by trees from the air represents an important but poorly quantified pathway in the global mercury cycle. We determined mercury uptake fluxes by leaves and needles at 10 European forests which were 4 times larger than mercury deposition via rainfall. The amount of mercury taken up by leaves and needles depends on their age and growing height on the tree. Scaling up our measurements to the forest area of Europe, we estimate that each year 20 t of mercury is taken up by trees.\n\nLagged effects regulate the inter-annual variability of the tropical carbon balance\n\nA. Anthony Bloom, Kevin W. Bowman, Junjie Liu, Alexandra G. Konings, John R. Worden, Nicholas C. Parazoo, Victoria Meyer, John T. Reager, Helen M. Worden, Zhe Jiang, Gregory R. Quetin, T. Luke Smallman, Jean-FranÃ§ois Exbrayat, Yi Yin, Sassan S. Saatchi, Mathew Williams, and David S. Schimel\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 6393–6422, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-6393-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-6393-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use a model of the 2001–2015 tropical land carbon cycle, with satellite measurements of land and atmospheric carbon, to disentangle lagged and concurrent effects (due to past and concurrent meteorological events, respectively) on annual land–atmosphere carbon exchanges. The variability of lagged effects explains most 2001–2015 inter-annual carbon flux variations. We conclude that concurrent and lagged effects need to be accurately resolved to better predict the world's land carbon sink.\n\nSpatial variations in terrestrial net ecosystem productivity and its local indicators\n\nErqian Cui, Chenyu Bian, Yiqi Luo, Shuli Niu, Yingping Wang, and Jianyang Xia\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 6237–6246, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-6237-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-6237-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMean annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is related to the magnitude of the carbon sink of a specific ecosystem, while its inter-annual variation (IAVNEP) characterizes the stability of such a carbon sink. Thus, a better understanding of the co-varying NEP and IAVNEP is critical for locating the major and stable carbon sinks on land. Based on daily NEP observations from eddy-covariance sites, we found local indicators for the spatially varying NEP and IAVNEP, respectively.\n\nNitrogen cycling in CMIP6 land surface models: progress and limitations\n\nTaraka Davies-Barnard, Johannes Meyerholt, SÃ¶nke Zaehle, Pierre Friedlingstein, Victor Brovkin, Yuanchao Fan, Rosie A. Fisher, Chris D. Jones, Hanna Lee, Daniele Peano, Benjamin Smith, David WÃ¥rlind, and Andy J. Wiltshire\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 5129–5148, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-5129-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-5129-2020, 2020\n\nDecomposing reflectance spectra to track gross primary production in a subalpine evergreen forest\n\nRui Cheng, Troy S. Magney, Debsunder Dutta, David R. Bowling, Barry A. Logan, Sean P. Burns, Peter D. Blanken, Katja Grossmann, Sophia Lopez, Andrew D. Richardson, Jochen Stutz, and Christian Frankenberg\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 4523–4544, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-4523-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-4523-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe measured reflected sunlight from an evergreen canopy for a year to detect changes in pigments that play an important role in regulating the seasonality of photosynthesis. Results show a strong mechanistic link between spectral reflectance features and pigment content, which is validated using a biophysical model. Our results show spectrally where, why, and when spectral features change over the course of the season and show promise for estimating photosynthesis remotely.\n\nSensitivity of 21st century simulated ecosystem indicators to model parameters, prescribed climate drivers, RCP scenarios and forest management actions for two Finnish boreal forest sites\n\nJarmo MÃ¤kelÃ¤, Francesco Minunno, Tuula Aalto, Annikki MÃ¤kelÃ¤, Tiina Markkanen, and Mikko Peltoniemi\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 2681–2700, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2681-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2681-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe assess the relative magnitude of uncertainty sources on ecosystem indicators of the 21st century climate change on two boreal forest sites. In addition to RCP and climate model uncertainties, we included the overlooked model parameter uncertainty and management actions in our analysis. Management was the dominant uncertainty factor for the more verdant southern site, followed by RCP, climate and parameter uncertainties. The uncertainties were estimated with canonical correlation analysis.\n\nSummarizing the state of the terrestrial biosphere in few dimensions\n\nGuido Kraemer, Gustau Camps-Valls, Markus Reichstein, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 2397–2424, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2397-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2397-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo closely monitor the state of our planet, we require systems that can monitor the observation of many different properties at the same time. We create indicators that resemble the behavior of many different simultaneous observations. We apply the method to create indicators representing the Earth's biosphere. The indicators show a productivity gradient and a water gradient. The resulting indicators can detect a large number of changes and extremes in the Earth system.\n\nPatterns and trends of the dominant environmental controls of net biome productivity\n\nBarbara Marcolla, Mirco Migliavacca, Christian RÃ¶denbeck, and Alessandro Cescatti\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 2365–2379, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2365-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2365-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work investigates the sensitivity of terrestrial CO2 fluxes to climate drivers. We observed that CO2 flux is mostly controlled by temperature during the growing season and by radiation off season. We also observe that radiation importance is increasing over time while sensitivity to temperature is decreasing in Eurasia. Ultimately this analysis shows that ecosystem response to climate is changing, with potential repercussions for future terrestrial sink and land role in climate mitigation.\n\nLocalized basal area affects soil respiration temperature sensitivity in a coastal deciduous forest\n\nStephanie C. Pennington, Nate G. McDowell, J. Patrick Megonigal, James C. Stegen, and Ben Bond-Lamberty\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 771–780, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-771-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-771-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSoil respiration (Rs) is the flow of CO2 from the soil surface to the atmosphere and is one of the largest carbon fluxes on land. This study examined the effect of local basal area (tree area) on Rs in a coastal forest in eastern Maryland, USA. Rs measurements were taken as well as distance from soil collar, diameter, and species of each tree within a 15 m radius. We found that trees within 5 m of our sampling points had a positive effect on how sensitive soil respiration was to temperature.\n\nDissolved organic carbon mobilized from organic horizons of mature and harvested black spruce plots in a mesic boreal region\n\nKeri L. Bowering, Kate A. Edwards, Karen Prestegaard, Xinbiao Zhu, and Susan E. Ziegler\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 581–595, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-581-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-581-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe examined the effects of season and tree harvesting on the flow of water and the organic carbon (OC) it carries from boreal forest soils. We found that more OC was lost from the harvested forest because more precipitation reached the soil surface but that during periods of flushing in autumn and snowmelt a limit on the amount of water-extractable OC is reached. These results contribute to an increased understanding of carbon loss from boreal forest soils.\n\nIdeas and perspectives: Proposed best practices for collaboration at cross-disciplinary observatories\n\nJason Philip Kaye, Susan L. Brantley, Jennifer Zan Williams, and the SSHCZO team\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 4661–4669, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-4661-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-4661-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nInterdisciplinary teams can only capitalize on innovative ideas if members work well together through collegial and efficient use of field sites, instrumentation, samples, data, and model code. Thus, biogeoscience teams may benefit from developing a set of best practices for collaboration. We present one such example from a the Susquehanna Shale Hills critical zone observatory. Many of the themes from our example are universal, and they offer insights useful to other biogeoscience teams.\n\nEffects of leaf length and development stage on the triple oxygen isotope signature of grass leaf water and phytoliths: insights for a proxy of continental atmospheric humidity\n\nAnne Alexandre, Elizabeth Webb, Amaelle Landais, ClÃ©ment Piel, SÃ©bastien Devidal, Corinne Sonzogni, Martine Couapel, Jean-Charles Mazur, Monique Pierre, FrÃ©dÃ©ric PriÃ©, Christine Vallet-Coulomb, ClÃ©ment Outrequin, and Jacques Roy\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 4613–4625, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-4613-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-4613-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis calibration study shows that despite isotope heterogeneity along grass leaves, the triple oxygen isotope composition of bulk leaf phytoliths can be estimated from the Craig and Gordon model, a mixing equation and a mean leaf waterâphytolith fractionation exponent (lambda) of 0.521. The results strengthen the reliability of the 17Oâexcess of phytoliths to be used as a proxy of atmospheric relative humidity and open tracks for its use as an imprint of leaf water 17Oâexcess.\n\nResponse of simulated burned area to historical changes in environmental and anthropogenic factors: a comparison of seven fire models\n\nLina Teckentrup, Sandy P. Harrison, Stijn Hantson, Angelika Heil, Joe R. Melton, Matthew Forrest, Fang Li, Chao Yue, Almut Arneth, Thomas Hickler, Stephen Sitch, and Gitta Lasslop\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 3883–3910, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-3883-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-3883-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study compares simulated burned area of seven global vegetation models provided by the Fire Model Intercomparison Project (FireMIP) since 1900. We investigate the influence of five forcing factors: atmospheric CO2, population density, landâuse change, lightning and climate. We find that the anthropogenic factors lead to the largest spread between models. Trends due to climate are mostly not significant but climate strongly influences the inter-annual variability of burned area.\n\nEstimation of coarse dead wood stocks in intact and degraded forests in the Brazilian Amazon using airborne lidar\n\nMarcos A. S. Scaranello, Michael Keller, Marcos Longo, Maiza N. dos-Santos, Veronika Leitold, Douglas C. Morton, Ekena R. PinagÃ©, and Fernando Del Bon EspÃ­rito-Santo\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 3457–3474, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-3457-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-3457-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe coarse dead wood component of the tropical forest carbon pool is rarely measured. For the first time, we developed models for predicting coarse dead wood in Amazonian forests by using airborne laser scanning data. Our models produced site-based estimates similar to independent field estimates found in the literature. Our study provides an approach for estimating coarse dead wood pools from remotely sensed data and mapping those pools over large scales in intact and degraded forests.\n\nTheoretical uncertainties for global satellite-derived burned area estimates\n\nJames Brennan, Jose L. GÃ³mez-Dans, Mathias Disney, and Philip Lewis\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 3147–3164, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-3147-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-3147-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe estimate the uncertainties associated with three global satellite-derived burned area estimates. The method provides unique uncertainties for the three estimates at the global scale for 2001â2013. We find uncertainties of 4 %â5.5 % in global burned area and uncertainties of 8 %â10 % in the frequently burning regions of Africa and Australia.\n\nEstimating global gross primary productivity using chlorophyll fluorescence and a data assimilation system with the BETHY-SCOPE model\n\nAlexander J. Norton, Peter J. Rayner, Ernest N. Koffi, Marko Scholze, Jeremy D. Silver, and Ying-Ping Wang\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 3069–3093, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-3069-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-3069-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents an estimate of global terrestrial photosynthesis. We make use of satellite chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, a visible indicator of photosynthesis, to optimize model parameters and estimate photosynthetic carbon uptake. This new framework incorporates nonlinear, process-based understanding of the link between fluorescence and photosynthesis, an advance on past approaches. This will aid in the utility of fluorescence to quantify terrestrial carbon cycle feedbacks.\n\nHow representative are FLUXNET measurements of surface fluxes during temperature extremes?\n\nSophie V. J. van der Horst, Andrew J. Pitman, Martin G. De Kauwe, Anna Ukkola, Gab Abramowitz, and Peter Isaac\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 1829–1844, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-1829-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-1829-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMeasurements of surface fluxes are taken around the world and are extremely valuable for understanding how the land and atmopshere interact, and how the land can amplify temerature extremes. However, do these measurements sample extreme temperatures, or are they biased to the average? We examine this question and highlight data that do measure surface fluxes under extreme con"
