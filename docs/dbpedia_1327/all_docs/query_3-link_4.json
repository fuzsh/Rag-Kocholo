        "text": "Reigning champion UNICS successfully worked on the transfer market in the offseason, managed to keep Playoffs MVP Nenad Dimitrijevic, and at the same time strengthened the roster.\n\nOne of the Kazan team newcomers is Ismael Bako. But the Belgian bigman has definitely gotten used to Russia, and can not only say hello in Russian, but also name UNICS opponents.\n\nIn his interview to the United League Bako talked about his adaptation in Kazan, his impressions of the snowy winter, volcanic surfing, his hobby, Belgian basketball and much more.\n\nAbout Russian language: I’m trying to learn Russian. But I can sat that it is really hard, but I’m trying my best. First of all, I want to learn basic words. Some of them have been known for me. For example “hello” or “good”. I have downloaded some apps on my phone to look up new words and remember them. Locals are smiling, when I’m trying to speak in Russian, but they help me every time, give some hints. It’s a really interesting experience for me.\n\nAbout the team, which surprised the most: Avtodor. This team surprised me more than others. They played fast, had good ball movement. We needed to run for them, and after that game I were really tired. We had prepared for the Saratov team, reviewed their game and were ready for such pace, but it was quite tough anyway. So Avtodor has surprised me the most in the League.\n\nAbout Russian winter: Winter is definitely very cold and it’s really hard to prepare for that, even if you know. But there’s nothing you can do about it. Before the arriving I’ve learnt some about the city and climate. Saw that there could be -20 in December/January, a lot of snow. But I’m trying to think positively every time. I can built a Snowman in Kazan or play snowballs in Kazan. Such an approach helps a lot. I didn’t bring a lot of warm clothes as I wanted to see the fashion and buy clothing according to it. Sometimes I visit shopping malls or local stores, buy some hype things to be fully Russian look-a-like. Want to purchase some traditional clothes. It is the right time as a real cold is coming. I will buy a war furry hat. I am going to wear it every time to avoid freezing.\n\nAbout hobby: I don’t have certain things to do in my free time, it depends on my mood. I am get an interest in some new hobbies, now I’m learning Russian now, for example. Probable, I’ll play guitar, draw or go to an excursion next week to know the country better. I can watch movies, but everything depend on desire. Usually I don’t make plans ahead, but if some idea gets into my head, I’m trying to realise it.\n\nFor example, I’ve jumped with parachute twice, really great emotions. I’ve tried it several years ago, on my brother’s birthday, but it was a present for him. I’ve also tried surfing, diving. When I surfed in the social media, I saw that people are doing and really liked it. So I’ve tried it myself and did not regret, got unforgettable emotions.\n\nI also really like traveling, I think it’s my biggest hobby. And basketball helps a lot with that. I also want to try as many cuisines as possible, it’s very interesting to compare them. I also like to realize myself in different spheres, except basketball: I want to learn to play musical instruments and dance better. But I have one more dream, the biggest and very dangerous one. One day I would like to try volcanic surfing, to go down on a board on the slope of a volcano. One day we’ll do it with my brother. I don’t know how, but we will.\n\nAbout Belgian basketball: I even know the first Belgian player in the League history, Maxime De Zeeuw, who represented Nymburk, I played with him in the national team. I was young then, still a rookie. And Maxime gave me a couple of valuable hints, guided me. My coach in the Belgian national team Dario Gjergja is a compatriot of Velimir Perasovic, they are similar in their Yugoslavian emotionality. In general, each specialist is unique, with his own style. But before signing the contract, I talked to the national team coach, asked his opinion. And he said that Velimir is a great specialist who will help me in my development.\n\nAbout negotiations with UNICS in the offseason: Negotiations were going on for about a week and a half, because I had to gather information about the team, and I’m a family man, so I had to solve some issues. I always consult with my family and parents when making important decisions, for example, about transfer. I listen to their opinion. I also talked to some players who have already played in Russia, including Kazan. I learned about the organization, daily things. For example, I talked to Louis Labeyriei, he gave only positive feedback. He likes everything very much, he said, sign the contract and don’t hesitate. Before moving to one team or another, I always make a decision based on a few things: what role I’m going to have, what kind of basketball the coach wants me to play and what kind of players the team has. I consider these criteria to see if I can reach my potential. Because if I come to a club that doesn’t play the best basketball for me, I won’t be able to benefit the team. So we always discuss such moments with my agent and family, how suitable it is for my career. I can say for sure that I didn’t make a mistake with UNICS.\n\nOf course, when UNICS first offered me a contract, I was a little afraid of Russia and the unfamiliar environment. But, after all, I came to play basketball, to grow as a player. The level of the League is very high, and this season it has grown even more, which is a good thing. It’s actually a great championship with strong teams and many players want to come here. I am very happy that I got this chance. The guys I consulted with told me not to worry about anything, assured me that I will be safe and have fun. And the season is very busy, so there is no time to get distracted by extraneous things.\n\nI know that Vince Hunter, a very tough player, has joined the team to replace him. The way he plays in offense! He’s one of my idols. Yeah, I have the honor of replacing him, but it’s really hard, but I’m trying. I play in the paint, I try to get rebounds, to benefit the team not only in offense, but also in defense. It’s important to help in defense as well, not only to score. For example, I try to shut down the opponent’s guard. Nevertheless, my main goal is to win, not personal stats or personal contribution, because only the team always wins, and everyone contributes something to the final success.\n\nAbout teammates: I have great relationships with everyone on the team. But I probably communicate a little bit more with Louis Labeyrie, because we can talk in French. Also Nenad Dimitrijevic is a great guy who is nice to talk to, as well as other foreigners: Jalen Reynolds, Eric Green, Marcos Knight. And the Russian players teach me the local language and help me with translation. In general, we have a great atmosphere in the locker room, good chemistry in the team. There are no groupings, we are all together, we communicate with each other, so I can say that every partner is my best friend.\n\nAbout football popularity: It’s hard to say what our basketball lacks, but it is definitely inferior to football. If you ask parents in Belgium whether you would send your child to football or basketball, they will probably choose the first. In my country, more attention is paid to football. Basketball is less popular, the local championship is not so popular, there is not enough infrastructure. That’s why the level is not up to Euroleague teams and fewer kids go to basketball, there is not enough mass participation. Belgium has grown an outstanding generation of footballers, who achieve success both at the team level and in the national team. And it is logical that the attention of the press is focused on this sport, and kids look at it and want to follow their idols.\n\nAbout traveling around Europe: I’ve played in many countries and I liked Spain the most, I lived half an hour away from Barcelona. I often went to this city, it has a very cool, inexpressible atmosphere that you can’t help but fall in love with! I also had a great season in Manresa, I showed a good game. I made friends with the guys from the team, we often went for walks, went on excursions to get to know the culture of the country better, or just went to a bar or restaurant. That is why I have only fond memories of Spain."
