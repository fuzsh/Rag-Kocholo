        "text": "It was a bizarre scene that first started in a gas station parking lot, with the driver nearly running several people over. That driver then led Utica police on a chase and, at one point, started ramming their patrol cars.\n\nPuffy clouds cruise over Detroit and most of Southeast Michigan the rest of today. The clouds in our North Zone (north of Hall Road/M-59) release some showers. It remains warm. Tuesday night will be cooler with clouds overhead. Two more rounds of showers are possible tomorrow. Sunnier, more stable weather persists during the end of the work week.\n\nPartridge Creek Mall was originally developed by Taubman and opened to a lot of fanfare in 2007. Designed to be an upscale outdoor shopping experience that was dog-friendly, a Nordstrom and a Parisian anchored it. Fast forward to 2014, the mall was sold at the height of the market.\n\nA special delivery from across the country arrived at a food bank in Oakland County. The key delivery was made to a Lighthouse food warehouse in Waterford Township on Thursday (Jan. 27). It comes from a church in Utah. The church realized that the food program at Lighthouse was in trouble, not only did the church send funds -- but also two dozen pallets of food.\n\nVideo from Sterling Heights police shows a long and intense high-speed chase and the ensuing arrest of a man accused of breaking into the home of a couple who posted on social media that they were at a wedding, officials said.\n\nTuesday’s cold front has ushered in a cooler, drier air mass, with the day’s mid 80s (30 degrees Celsius) now replaced by Wednesday’s mid- to upper 70s (24 to 26 degrees Celsius). While an isolated brief, light shower is possible before sunset -- best chance is north of M-59 -- most of us should be dry through the evening hours.\n\nTodd Bertuzzi #44 of the Detroit Red Wings skates against the San Jose Sharks at SAP Center on January 9, 2014 in San Jose, California. AUBURN HILLS, Mich. – Former Detroit Red Wing Todd Bertuzzi has been charged for driving drunk in Auburn Hills last month, according to police. Bertuzzi failed roadside sobriety evaluations and was arrested for operating while intoxicated, Auburn Hills police said. He was taken to the Auburn Hills Police Department and refused a breath test, officials said. Bertuzzi was taken to the Oakland County Jail and released after 12 hours, pending toxicology results, police said.\n\nFrom the end of breakfast to the beginning of lunch, light rain is possible south of M-59/Hall Road; snow and rain showers are possible north of Hall Road. In all, 1 to 2 inches of new snow is possible from Sunday night to Monday morning. That rain snow mixture is more likely south of M 59/Hall Road. Thursday and Friday will be partly sunny mostly cloudy and chillier. Saturday will be partly sunny and not as chilly.\n\nDETROIT – Winter weather already has prompted some school closings in Metro Detroit. There is plenty of snow expected overnight Monday into Tuesday morning, so you can expect even more closings to be announced. From the Local 4Casters:A bigger storm heading this way from Texas will redevelop snow Monday evening, which will become heavy at times Monday night before winding down Tuesday morning. This should easily be a 6-to-8-inch snowfall, so total snow from what falls both Sunday night/Monday morning and Monday night/Tuesday morning could approach 10 inches in some areas. Weather forecast: 6-to-10 inches of snow tonight\n\nNorth of 8 Mile -- and especially north of M-59 -- snow will be more persistent, and an additional inch or two is possible. Winter weather advisoryThe National Weather Service has issued a winter weather advisory until 4 p.m. Tuesday for areas generally south of M-59, and until 11 p.m. for areas generally north of M-59. Temperatures today will only rise a couple of degrees, perhaps to near freezing (0 degrees Celsius), with a northeast wind becoming north at 10 to 15 mph. Snow diminishes Tuesday night, with lows in the low to mid 20s (-5 degrees Celsius). Becoming partly cloudy and much colder Wednesday night, with lows in the low to mid teens (-11 degrees Celsius).\n\nHere’s an update this morning from Meteorologist Paul Gross:Snow moved in overnight, and a heavy band developed as it progressed northward. A wonderful piece on how Michigan became a state way back when from our colleague Dane Kelly:Happy 184th birthday, Michigan! The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in Michigan has risen to 551,080 as of Friday, including 14,326 deaths, state officials report. Monday’s update includes 3,011 new cases and 35 additional deaths over the past two days. On Saturday, the state reported a total of 548,069 cases and 14,291 deaths.\n\nDETROIT – The forecast is getting less flaky as we head into the weekend. Snow NorthAn area of light snow with some rain will rotate through the northern part of our area tomorrow morning. Mainly Dry WeekendWe still have a slight chance of lake effect snow on Sunday, but that shot is pretty slim. Minor BumpAfter a slightly cooler weekend, temperatures get a bit of a bump by the middle of next week. By that time, normal highs will be only the upper 30s and daytime highs should reach the mid 40s.\n\nWARREN, Mich. – Residents of a Warren neighborhood are worried about the plan to remove the traffic light on their road as part of the massive Mound Road rebuild project. “You take our street light out and we will never get in or out of our subdivision,” Warren resident Cynthia Allen said. Allen has lived in Warren’s St. Anne subdivision at Mound Road and Arden Avenue for 50 years. Part of the plan for the Mound Road makeover is to remove the traffic light at Arden Avenue and eliminate the cut-through. County road officials said removing the light at Arden Avenue improves traffic flow.\n\nWATERFORD TOWNSHIP, Mich. – A man accused of being drunk and driving recklessly at the time of a four-car crash that killed a 6-year-old girl and injured her parents in Waterford Township is facing five charges.
