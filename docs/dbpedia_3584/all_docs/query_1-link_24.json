People came to enjoy Park Island Amusement Park and Dance Hall, and in search of the famous dragon on the lake.\n\n184 years later, Orion Township is a thriving community in Northern Oakland County, with an estimated population of 39,518 residents. The Township includes the Village of Lake Orion, and is direct neighbors to Independence Township, Oxford Township, Oakland Township, and the City of Auburn Hills."
