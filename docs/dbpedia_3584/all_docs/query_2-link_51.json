        "text": "As far as medium sized hardware stores go, Ace as a whole brand name is hard to beat. This location specifically is especially nice. Store is kept up ery well, sales associated always seem willing to help, and are also knowledgeable! I point that out because at some of the big box hardware stored (think the color orange , the color blue, the color green), so many times I've either asked for help or seen someone else ask for help only for the teenager working that particular department to flat out say that they have no clue about anything in the department. Also, this isn't a slight against teenagers or people who are still learning a given thing. In fact, I appreciate the honesty. Much rather that than someone feeding you false info for the of not admitting they're clueless. I say it simply to say that having the person you ask for help not only understand you and know what you're talking about, but be able to add their own knowledge to the situation makes a person feel good. Great store, awesome location, staff that other Ace stores ought to be jealous of.\n\nI'm conditioned to go to the big box stores despite living nearby. But as luck would have it I stopped in. I've been in Ace hardwares many many times just not recently and it's been a disservice to myself. The store was very clean and up-to-date. The selection of items exceeded my expectations and before I reached the middle of the store 2 employees had asked if I needed help, I easily found everything I was looking for and unless I was looking for bulk lumber or excessive building materials I doubt I've have any issues."
