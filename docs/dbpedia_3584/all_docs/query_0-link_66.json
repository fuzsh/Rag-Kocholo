        "text": "Michigan’s northern population, particularly in the upper Lower Peninsula, appears to be growing despite an overall population decline statewide.\n\nBetween April 2020 and July 2022, the state lost an estimated 43,000 residents, according to the latest U.S. Census Bureau estimates. About 40% of cities, townships and villages saw estimated population declines during that stretch, including 3% dips in big cities like Detroit and Ann Arbor.\n\nHowever, about 48% of communities grew during that time. Much of the growth appears to be north and east of Roscommon in Northern Michigan, and north of Kent County in West Michigan.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau recently released 2022 population estimates broken down to the community level for each state. They include estimates for cities, towns, townships and villages, with comparisons to the April 2020 Census counts.\n\nTypically, population estimate changes are based on two components: births versus deaths, and migration in/out of a community. For a more in-depth explanation of methodology, visit the Census website.\n\nNine of Michigan’s 10 most-populated towns saw estimated population declines over the last two years, including a more than 18,000-person dip in Detroit and a nearly 4,000 person decline in Ann Arbor.\n\nRELATED: Michigan’s population trend could bring economic pain. How are policymakers responding?\n\nThe community with the highest growth rate in 2022 was Manistee County’s Springdale Township, which saw a 29% increase to about 1,093 residents. The village of Mecosta, home to about 451 residents, was the only other community with a double-digit increase (12%). Caledonia, Manton, New Haven, Lyon Township (Oakland County), and Dundee rounded out the top seven growing places.\n\nMeanwhile, Kinross Township in Chippewa County saw the biggest rate of decline in population with a net loss of about 650 residents, or 9%. Other top decliners included Bloomer Township (-8%), Houghton (-5%), Ypsilanti (-5%), Coldwater (-4%), Madison Township (-4%), and Highland Park (-4%).\n\nBelow is a database of population change estimates for more than 1,700 Michigan communities between April 2020 and July 2022. Use the search function to find a given location, or click on the column headers to arrange the data in various ways.\n\nCan’t see the data? Click here.\n\nMichigan’s top-10 most populated places held their place in the state rankings. Warren, Dearborn and Livonia each saw about a 2% decline in population, while Grand Rapids, Sterling Heights, and Clinton Township each dropped about 1%.\n\nAmong places ranked 11-20, Southfield dropped two spots from No. 17 in 2020 to No. 19 in 2022. Each moving up one spot were Wyoming in Kent County (No. 17) and Rochester Hills in Oakland County (No. 18).\n\nLooking at total population gains instead of percentage change, Lyon Township and Auburn Hills in Oakland County, and Holland Township in Ottawa County, were the only places to increase by more than 1,000 residents.\n\nSimilarly, there were 17 places that had a net loss of more than 1,000 residents, including Detroit, Ann Arbor, Warren, Dearborn, Grand Rapids, Sterling Heights, Livonia, Flint, Westland, Dearborn Heights, Farmington Hills, Southfield, Troy, St. Clair Shores, Clinton Township, Redford Township, and Waterford Township.\n\nBelow is an interactive map illustrating the state’s local population changes, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. Hover over or click on a community to see its population change.\n\nCan’t see the map? Click here.\n\nThe upward trend of people in West Michigan shouldn’t come as a surprise based on population changes over the last decade. However, the rise in population in northeast Michigan is new. Between 2010 and 2020, most counties in the area were declining, led by Crawford, Alcona and Montmorency counties.\n\nFor additional context, here’s a county-level map illustrating Michigan’s population change between 2010 and 2020. You can put your cursor over a county to see its underlying data.\n\nRead more on MLive:\n\nCat declawing could get scratched in Michigan\n\nSummer gas rules: What are they and who’s affected in Michigan?\n\nA hedge fund bought Michigan mobile home parks.
