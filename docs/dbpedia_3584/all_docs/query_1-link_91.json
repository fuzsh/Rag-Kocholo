        "text": "Oakland County is home to over 2,000 tech companies with more than 42,000 jobs in the field. That is, 58% of all of the IT/Tech companies in the Metro Detroit region – more than twice the number of any other county in the State of Michigan. In the last ten years alone, nearly 100 companies invested upwards of $586 million in Oakland County, economically contributing more than 10,500 additional jobs in our local communities.\n\nTech248 is designed to accelerate growth throughout the tech industry through the collaboration, attraction and development of talent. This initiative provides tech companies with workforce recruitment and training. A variety of resources are of assistance to tech companies through tech248. These resources include the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, connections with young talent including partnering with students from high school to college, and Oakland County Michigan Works business service provider can be used to support our tech companies. Other tools available include business counseling and assistance with market research, customer profiling, and strategy assessment. Tech248 also provides additional access to funding and capital, such as loans and grants as well as incentives for creating jobs in Michigan.\n\nAuburn Hills had teamed up with Oakland County to assist our own tech companies in the area. The abundance of companies led to the creation of tech248 districts throughout the county. MeetUps are organized by community partners in each district. They are designed to bring a variety of tech companies and talent together to facilitate innovation and collaboration among everyone. These MeetUps are solely for tech companies and focused on connectivity. MeetUps are held in a unique space within the community on a quarterly basis. It is highly inclusive of youth, encourages networking and collaboration, and provides a brief update as to what is happening in the tech community. Tech248 also emphases branding. We want to create a buzz about your company! This initiative is promoted through Oakland County as well as Auburn Hill social media and marketing.\n\nThe first meeting for the North East district will take place Friday, February 20, 2015 from 2:48 PM to 4:48 PM at the Rochester Mills Production Facility located at 3275 W. Lapeer Road Auburn Hills, MI 48326.

Please feel free to pass this flyer along to your tech friends and join us as we network and sip on some locally brewed craft beers (21+).\n\nIf you have any questions please contact Chris Olzem (olzemc@oakgov.com or 248-858-1354), Oakland County Economic Development & Community Affairs or Stephanie Carroll (scarroll@auburnhills.org or 248-364-9440), Auburn Hills Manager of Business Development and Community Relations.\n\nSam Mariuz, Management Assistant"
