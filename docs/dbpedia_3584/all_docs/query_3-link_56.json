        "text": "Auburn Road/Brooklands DistrictReimaging Auburn Road & the Brooklands\n\nRochester Hills recently completed a comprehensive renewal of a neighborhood first settled in the early 1820’s. The “Brooklands” is an area with a storied history of single family homes encompassing an aged commercial thoroughfare, Auburn Road. After decades of discussion, deliberate planning took place, and the City undertook redevelopment of the Brooklands’ Auburn Road.\n\nThis major investment has transformed the corridor into a more walkable business district, providing a safe and attractive place for vehicles and pedestrians alike. To encourage (re)development opportunities, the City doubled the amount of parking spaces within the corridor and embraced community engagement with public open spaces, beautiful landscape, art and a splash pad.\n\nThis project has served as a catalyst for community redevelopment and public participation, igniting investment and a true entrepreneurial ecosystem for businesses. Property values have increased significantly and more families are moving into the area. This desirable district is proving to be a safer, walkable corridor, more connected to the surrounding neighborhood that supports economic development, spurs people to engage and renews community pride.\n\nMichigan Municipal League Community Excellence Award 2021\n\nWe did it! We beat out all the rest. Submitting our story of the transformation of the Auburn Road Corridor, with the countless house of planning to make this area a better, safer, more all around desirable place to live and visit, the Michigan Municipal League (MML) bestowed Rochester Hills with the Community Excellence Award. The award, considered the highest and most prestigious award given to a community, celebrates and honors innovative projects across the state.\n\nBrooklands: Open for Investment\n\nThe new Brooklands is open and ready for investment! The City has done the heavy lifting and invested substantially in creating the necessary infrastructure for redevelopment in this area. Public parking? Check! Walkable streetscape? You got it. Accessible alley? Of course. If you’re looking to invest in this district, we’re here to help.\n\nArt on Auburn\n\nArt on Auburn is a community project bringing K-12 student artwork to new audiences through art applied directly to the surface of Auburn Road! The winning student artwork was selected by a jury and by public vote, narrowing it down to the top 25 out of the nearly 500 entries depicting “What Community Means to Me.”\n\nWatch the Unveiling Celebration Video here.\n\nBrooklands Plaza\n\nThe gem of the district, the Brooklands Plaza is home to the City’s first splashpad. An area for people to gather and have some fun, Brooklands Plaza helps reinforce the identity for the district. Watch the Splashpad Grand Opening here.\n\nPublic Parking\n\nBrooklands is home to the City’s first public parking lots. In addition to the many on-street parking spaces, there are public lots located north of Auburn Road on Emmons Ave. and between Harrison and Eastern Ave. The city will also be expanding parking opportunities with the addition of another public parking lot on Eastern Ave. on the south side of Auburn in 2022. The best part about it? Its all free of charge!\n\nAuburn Road Corridor Plan\n\nIn early 2017, Rochester Hills adopted the Auburn Road Corridor Plan, which provides recommendations for the 6-mile corridor of Auburn Road through the City, with a particular focus on the Brooklands neighborhood. The plan, although not the first plan for the area, laid the foundation for the transformation that was to follow."
