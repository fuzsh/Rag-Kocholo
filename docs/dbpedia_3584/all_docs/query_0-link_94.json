Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nAuburn Hills experiences some seasonal variation in the perceived humidity.\n\nThe muggier period of the year lasts for 3.6 months, from June 1 to September 20, during which time the comfort level is muggy, oppressive, or miserable at least 7% of the time.

Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (604 feet). Within 50 miles also contains significant variations in elevation (797 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Auburn Hills is covered by artificial surfaces (96%), within 10 miles by artificial surfaces (75%) and trees (14%), and within 50 miles by cropland (46%) and artificial surfaces (23%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Auburn Hills, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Auburn Hills.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Auburn Hills according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Auburn Hills is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Auburn Hills and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nOakland County International Airport (KPTK, 51%, 9 mi, west, 16 ft elevation change)\n\nOakland-Troy Airport (KVLL, 39%, 10 mi, south, -243 ft elevation change)\n\nDupont Lapeer Airport (KD95, 11%, 26 mi, north, -125 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Auburn Hills and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
