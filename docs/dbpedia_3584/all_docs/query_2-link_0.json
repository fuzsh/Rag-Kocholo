        "text": "City in Michigan, United States\n\nAuburn Hills is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A northern suburb of Detroit, Auburn Hills is located about 26 miles (42 km) north of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 24,360.[7]\n\nAuburn Hills is home to Oakland University and the U.S. headquarters of Stellantis, PHINIA, BorgWarner and Volkswagen. Before incorporating as a city in 1983, the area was part of the now-defunct Pontiac Township.[8]\n\nIn 1908, automobile pioneer John Dodge bought a farmhouse 3 miles (4.8 km) northeast of Auburn Heights to use as his country retreat. His oldest child, Winifred Dodge, married real estate baron Wesson Seyburn, who built his own country retreat 2.5 miles (4.0 km) north of Auburn Heights. The estate included hunting land, dog kennels, a swimming pool, horse stables, and a 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) Colonial Revival house. Pontiac Township purchased the estate in 1976, and adapted the buildings for government use. Today, it is known as the Auburn Hills Civic Center.\n\nThe first use of the name \"Auburn Hills,\" in 1964, was by Oakland Community College. They named their campus (a former Nike missile base) at Featherstone and Squirrel roads for the town and the hilly terrain in the area. Besides Oakland Community College, three other colleges, Oakland University, Baker College, and Western Michigan University Thomas M. Cooley Law School have campuses partially within the city limits.\n\nAuburn Hills began as Pontiac Township, including the village of Auburn, in 1821, at what is today the corner of Auburn and Squirrel roads. Situated on the Clinton River, it was named by Aaron Webster, the first settler, for Auburn, New York. His sawmill and grist mill attracted settlers to Auburn. After the streets were laid out in 1826, Auburn rivaled nearby Pontiac until the 1860s, when it lost its own prosperity. The town was renamed Amy in 1880, and it officially became Auburn Heights in 1919. Pontiac Township bordered the city of Pontiac on two sides. The township attempted to incorporate as Pontiac Heights in 1971, but was denied by state officials. Pontiac Township became a charter township in 1978, to protect itself from further annexation. In 1983, Pontiac Township merged with the village of Auburn Heights to become the City of Auburn Hills. It is not to be confused with the similarly named city of Auburn, Michigan, that exists in Bay County, near Saginaw Bay.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 16.64 square miles (43.10 km2), of which 16.60 square miles (42.99 km2) is land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) (0.24%) is water.[9]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1880111—199017,076—200019,83716.2%201021,4127.9%202024,36013.8%\n\nAs of the census[11] of 2010, there were 21,412 people, 8,844 households, and 4,923 families living in the city.

The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females, there were 98.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.5 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $51,376, and the median income for a family was $60,849.

About 3.9% of families and 6.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.4% of those under age 18 and 4.4% of those age 66 or over.\n\nAuburn Hills roughly follows the course of Interstate 75 and is home to a prosperous business community. In the early 1980s, Oakland University partnered with developers to create a technology and research park. The Oakland Technology Park was approved by the city in 1985, with Comerica, EDS, and Chrysler to build campuses there. The city's many tech and office buildings host 80,000 people during the workday.\n\nGreat Lakes Crossing Outlets, an enclosed super-regional outlet shopping mall, opened November 12, 1998.\n\nIn 2002, the area at Auburn and Squirrel was revitalized as the \"Village Center\" with streetscape improvements. Pedestrian-friendly development is encouraged in this district now known simply as Downtown Auburn Hills. At the end of 2013, a number of large projects were completed Downtown, including a four-story graduate student apartment complex, a 233-space parking deck, an auxiliary classroom space for schools and colleges called the University Center and the Downtown Educational Nook (DEN), a refurbished historic log cabin acting as a student and community center.\n\nAuburn Hills is home to PHINIA, BorgWarner, Guardian Industries, Autoliv, RGIS, Joyson Safety Systems, the Americas headquarters of GKN Driveline, the North American headquarters of Faurecia, Volkswagen/Audi North American Headquarters, and until its demolition, The Palace of Auburn Hills, the former home of the National Basketball Association's Detroit Pistons and the former home of Women's National Basketball Association's Detroit Shock.\n\nIn 2017, Maserati announced it was moving its U.S. headquarters from Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey to the former Walter P. Chrysler Museum in Auburn Hills.[12]\n\nSchool districts serving sections of Auburn Hills include Avondale School District,[13] Pontiac School District,[14] and Rochester Community Schools.[citation needed]\n\nThe Avondale School District operates two elementary schools in the city limits: R. Grant Graham Elementary School and Auburn Elementary School. Portions of Auburn Hills in ASD are zoned to these schools. All ASD residents are zoned to Avondale Middle School in Rochester Hills and Avondale High School in Auburn Hills. Other ASD facilities in Auburn Hills include the district administrative offices and Avondale Montessori.[13] A Pontiac school district school, Will Rogers Elementary School, is located in northeastern Auburn Hills.[15]\n\nPrivate schools in Auburn Hills include:\n\nAuburn Hills Christian School\n\nOakland Christian School\n\nPrivate schools near Auburn Hills:\n\nNotre Dame Preparatory/Marist Academy, Pontiac\n\nHoly Family Regional School (HFRS) - Consists of a grade PK-3 North Campus in Rochester and a 4-8 South Campus in Rochester Hills.
