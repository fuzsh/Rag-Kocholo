        "text": "Advertisements\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Coldjensens\n\nActually most of Northville is in Oakland county. A small piece in the south is in Wayne County. (I grew up just outside of Northville and we had a Northville address although we attended South Lyon Schools).\n\nI would put Northville at A.\n\nYour ranking of Royal Oak surprised me Based on rental prices I thought it would be higher, but I do not know a lot about the residential part of royal oak.\n\nRoyal Oak is pretty broad and really spans A to C. I'd say if you went back 20-30 years ago is was probably more C than B. Its transitioned to much bigger mix of B and C but there is still a lot of C and dated/unrenovated properties to match well.\n\nSome areas are solidily B, even parts of A thrown in in some of the new builds or huge houses along parts of Vinsetta/Northwood and directly west of downtown.\n\nThe north and northeast parts that border Clawson and Madison Heights as well and anything east of Campbell toward I-75 still tend to be a more C / working class type than some of the areas closer to Woodward and/or downtown.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Geo-Aggie\n\nThe fact that those rankings place suburbs like Oakland Township, Rochester Hills, West Bloomfield, and Lyon Township which are primarily endless dead-end, cul-de-sac neighborhoods with the occasional strip mall or Meijer thrown on a mile road, over suburbs that have like.. you know.. actual character such as Royal Oak, Berkley, Ferndale, and Clawson.. it pretty much invalidates the entire list to anyone who doesn't want to live in the unsustainable, cookie-cutter 1990s version of American McMansion Suburbia.\n\nYour first group of suburbs has better schools than the second group. Nothing is more important to families with children than schools.\n\nAlso, while I agree that these are cookie-cutter suburbs, same is true with places like Berkley and Clawson. They're just 1950's cookie cutter bungalows, 1/3 the size of homes in places like Lyon Twp. and therefore less desirable for families. Clawson has very little character. The newer bigfoot homes you see in Royal Oak are the same cookie-cutter look and feel as a new subdivision in the boonies, just with front-facing garage and smaller lot.\n\nSo, yeah, while there are plenty of people who prefer somewhere like Ferndale, your typical professional couple with children will vastly prefer more house and better schools over less house and crappier schools.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Arthur Digby Sellers\n\nNo.\n\nA portion of the city of Northville is in Oakland County. Northville Township, which contains many more residents than the city, is entirely in Wayne County.\n\n\"Most of the city is in Oakland County and is surrounded by the city of Novi, while the other part is in Wayne County and is surrounded by Northville Township.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northville,_Michigan\n\nCities, Townships & Villages in Oakland County Michigan\n\nNote we are discussing Northville - the City. Not Northville Township. They are different places.\n\nCities and townships are different places with different governments. Thus, Lyon Township and South Lyon are not the same.\n\nA city is an incorporated area, while a township is not incorporated and is a subdivision of a county. Each have separate governments, tax zones, development restrictions, law enforcement (unless one cotnracts with the other). . . their population is counted separately. thus, The City of Northville's [ppopulation is about 6,000 people while the township has nearly 30,000 people.\n\nThe fact that a township in Wayne county is larger than the City of Northville has nothing to do with where the City of Northville is located. It is nto uncommon for a township to contain many more people than a city in the same area. Townships are generally geographically larger than cities (but not always). For example neighboring Lyon township is roughly twice the size of South Lyon, but that does not mean they are the same place. Nor does it mean South Lyon is in a different location than it is."
