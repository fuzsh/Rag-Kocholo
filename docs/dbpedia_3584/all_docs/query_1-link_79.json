Weatherization Tips from your Historic District Commission\n\nSure, those translucent stalactites dangling from your eaves are part of that quintessential winter scene, but if you have Icicles hanging from the eaves and Ice Dams on your Roof, the picturesque look is a sign that there’s a big problem with your roof and ventilation. Not only can they rip the gutters right off your house, ice dams and icicles can loosen roof shingles and let water get inside. To get rid of icicles and ice dams for good, you need to figure out how to make the roof the same temperature from the ridge to the eaves: that means making sure your attic is well insulated, eaves and ridges are ventilated, attic hatches and ducts are sealed, and any kitchen, bath, or dryer vents are vented outside—not into your attic space.\n\nLost Lake Sled Hill\n\n***PLEASE CALL BEFORE YOU GO to make sure the hill is open: (248) 651-4440 x 299.***\n\nReady for our first big snow of the season?
