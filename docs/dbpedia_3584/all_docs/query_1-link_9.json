        "text": "Rochester Hills Mayor Bryan Barnett has organized an Oil and Gas Public Meeting for Monday May 5, 2014 to be held at Rochester College from 5:30 to 7:30 pm. He has gathered industry experts, environmental groups, and decision makers from the MDEQ to answer Rochester Hills’ resident’s concerns.\n\nOil and gas exploration is not new to Michigan, though it is new to the northern Oakland County environs. There has been much discussion about this process, its safety and effect on property owner rights.\n\nResidents of our neighbor to the south, the City of Rochester Hills, have recently been contacted by an oil and gas company seeking a lease to explore the minerals believed to be below their properties. The area they are interested in is primarily the Tienken Road corridor, from Auburn Hills to the west to Shelby Township to the east.\n\nWhile the recent contacts have not affected Oakland Township residents, some may be interested in attending this Public Meeting and learning about the subject."
