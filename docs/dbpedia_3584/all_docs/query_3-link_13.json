        "text": "Quote:\n\nOriginally Posted by HPY1\n\nWhich one and why?\n\nI've been talking to my significant other more about this move.\n\nWe do like the down river areas of New Boston (Huron School District), we are the F150 type that many described living in that area. We don't mind a rural neighborhood with a little bit of land.\n\nWe also like the idea of Grosse Ile also. Small town feel, everything you need is on the island but not too far anything either (Grosse Ile Schools). How is the traffic from both of those places to the downtown area (Michigan Ave).\n\nWe've also looked into Canton/Plymouth, West Bloomfield Township as well as St. Claire Shores Auburn, and Rochester... With having never been there it makes all these decisions very hard. We don't mind an affluent area so long as it is also humble.\n\nSo please provide some input.\n\nAs mentioned elsewhere, don't know anything really about New Boston, other than it is small and not talked about much.\n\nGrosse Ile - (my home): Lots of information on other threads available. Just search for \"Ile\" Commute to downtown is 37 minutes. That can be increased by snow, trains (happens a lot), accidents, and possibly time of day (I try not to drive in the peak of rush hour). Time will increase or decrease depending on where in GI you are. Out on Hickory Island - add about 10 minutes. Near a bridge, subtract 5 minutes. GI is not ideal for everyone. If you are looking for Rochester Hills or Canton, you probably will not much like GI. GI is more about open space, kind of a park like setting. A good example of what I am trying to convey: Our wood and tires playscape fits in perfectly here. A chrome and plastic one would not fit in so well (even though it may be considered safer/more appealing to many people and kids). GI tends to be kind of an old fashioned place to some extent (most, but not everyone feels that way). Growth is controlled, especially subdivision growth (as in - if a developer tries to develop a subdivision the Township has a committee that tries to buy the land and designate it as \"Greenspace\" We have all the traffic, traffic lights, stores, concrete, and cookie cutter houses we ever want to have. Most people like to say \"Enough - no more\" If you really want a new house, most will be custom built and expensive. However there are a few subs that get slipped in once in a while. Waterfront homes are all custom and pricey (start around $450,000 on the West side and around $750,000 on the east side (multiple millions on the north east). Canal homes can be found cheaper. Inland pretty much starting around $250,000 but there are a few in the $150 - $200K range. I know one guy who got a house during the recession for $12,000, but that is not likely to happen ever again.\n\nCanton and Rochester hills are very much alike. Subdivision clusters with lots of strip malls/chains and big box stores. Both have nice small towns nearby (Plymouth and Rochester). RH is fancier and considered better located by those who believe everything worthwhile in Michigan is in North Oakland County. Canton has Ann Arbor nearby (to me that has more appeal than North Oakland, but opinions vary). Rochester Hills has a Metropark and lots of open/empty areas not too far away. Rochester Hills/Auburn Hills will put you in the worst traffic I think. From Canton, 94/96 in and out of Detroit are not too bad. One of them (I forget which) is rarely patrolled. A friend who commuted form Ann Arbor to Detroit said he typically drives 100 MPH on his commute.\n\nI do not know a lot about living in Auburn Hills. Chrysler is there, OU is there, the Palace Great Lakes crossing and the new Michigan Aquarium. It used to be considered not that great a place to live 15 or 20 years ago (maybe a bit more than that), but suddenly got nicer. I know a couple of families who live there, they like it particularly because they are right on the edge of Rochester Hills and a short drive/bike ride form Great Lakes crossing. The Pontiac side used to be considerably less desirable, but Pontiac is improving, so maybe that has gotten better. Traffic will be simlar to Rochester Hills. Houses and taxes should be considerably cheaper than RH. RH is pretty upscale and pricey."
