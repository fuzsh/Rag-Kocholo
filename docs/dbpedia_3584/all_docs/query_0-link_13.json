        "text": "Oakland Heights Development Landfill (OHD), located at 2350 Brown Road in Oakland County, is an open, licensed municipal solid waste facility owned by Republic Services, Inc. The OHD Landfill consists of 200+ acres divided into several smaller individual cells, which accepted waste over the lifespan of the facility. Initially, the landfill consisted of a phase I cell, followed by cells A-F, with the facility currently filling in cell F, located in the northeast corner of the site.\n\nOHD has a monitoring program that consists of groundwater monitoring wells and surface water monitoring points that are required to be sampled in compliance with Part 115. As part of EGLE's investigation of potential sources PFAS in the groundwaters of the state, EGLE requested OHD collect groundwater samples for PFAS analysis.\n\nThe groundwater flow direction at OHD is generally to the south, although the gradient, or slope of the groundwater as it flows across the site, is relatively shallow/flat. With such a flat groundwater slope at the site, the movement of groundwater can be relatively slow, even in porous material such as sand and gravel, which makes up a considerable portion of the geology beneath the OHD landfill. Because of the sand and gravel geology at the site, however, groundwater can still move and potential off-site migration of PFAS is possible. There are several drinking water wells located nearby.\n\nContent posted August 2020."
