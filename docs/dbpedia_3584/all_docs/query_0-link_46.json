        "text": "Hot Meals and Friendly Visits for Homebound Seniors\n\nMeals on Wheels helps homebound seniors who are unable to prepare their own meals. It can be an absolutely essential service for many older adults—providing a hot meal, a friendly visitor and someone to check in on them every weekday. AgeWays helps support the Meals on Wheels program in six counties here in southeast Michigan (Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St Clair and Washtenaw).\n\nHow the Program Works\n\nTypically, Meals on Wheels are delivered Monday through Friday. With each delivery, people receive a lunch and, often, a dinner for later in the day. Many of our Meals on Wheels providers will provide frozen meals that can be eaten over the weekend. Meals on Wheels recipients are asked to make voluntary donation. (These donations help offset program costs.)\n\nMeals are usually delivered by volunteers who often take a few minutes to talk with the seniors on their route. Sometimes the volunteers and seniors get to know each other quite well, and it can be nice for the senior to be able to count on seeing that volunteer every weekday. (Volunteers are well-vetted and must pass background checks.)\n\nWho Is Eligible?\n\nThe program is available to people over 60. There are no financial eligibility requirements. Instead eligibility is based on whether or not someone can leave their home without assistance.\n\nWhat is AgeWays’ Role?\n\nAgeWays supports Meals on Wheels and senior dining programs in six counties in Southeast Michigan. We do not provide meals directly. We help fund the program and provide oversight for the program in the six counties we serve. We then contract with a network of trusted local organizations that provide the meals in their community.\n\nHow to Sign Up for Meals on Wheels\n\nIf you’re interested in receiving Meals on Wheels for yourself or a loved one, contact the Meals on Wheels program in your community. They can tell you more about how the program works in your area and if you or your loved one might be eligible. If it looks as though you might qualify, the program will conduct an in-home assessment to confirm eligibility.\n\nSoutheast Michigan Meals on Wheels Programs\n\nLivingston County\n\nLivingston County Senior Nutrition Program\n\n(888) 886-8971or (810) 632-2155\n\nMacomb County\n\nMacomb County Office of Senior Services\n\n(586) 469-5228\n\nMonroe County\n\nLiving Independence for Everyone\n\n(734) 242-6800\n\nOakland County\n\nOakland County has several different organizations that provide home delivered Meals on Wheels.
