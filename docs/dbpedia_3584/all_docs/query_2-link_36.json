        "text": "Located 30 miles north of Detroit, Auburn Hills is home to more than 26,000 residents and 40 global businesses.\n\nAuburn Hills residents enjoy the amenities of city and suburban living with parks, a revitalized downtown district, and a welcoming city complex with a library and community center. Additionally, the city features Great Lakes Crossing Outlets, one of the stateâ€™s largest destination shopping centers, and provides a variety of cultural, social, and educational opportunities to residents, workers, and visitors.\n\nDowntown Auburn Hills is as beautiful as it is unique. Located along the scenic Clinton River, the area features brick-paved sidewalks and a riverside park, and is home to many community events, including Summerfest, Paddlepalooza, Halloween Spooktacular, Summer Music Series, and more! It also features a variety of businesses and restaurants owned by community-minded business owners.\n\nWith four different institutions, Auburn Hills is also a college town. There are over 35,000 college students from Oakland University, Baker College, Cooley Law School, and Oakland Community College combined. New developments throughout Downtown are geared toward the growing student population, including coworking and networking spaces."
