        "text": "Public Square: an open public area in a city or town where people gather.\n\nWe are always excited to see something new added to our steadily growing downtown. Private sector investment has been ongoing with some great additions over the past few years. To support that growth, the city is also adding a gathering place for the public known as the Public Square. The location will be on the south side of Auburn Road where North Squirrel Road terminates.\n\nThe project has been discussed for the last several years, and each time we’ve attempted to build it over the last few years, increased costs have prevented it from happening. So, in 2023, the city pursued a grant from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC). As a result of our grant application, we were awarded $450,000. THANK YOU, MEDC! Those funds combined with a grant from the Auburn Hills Community Foundation in the amount of $250,000, as well as a contribution from the Auburn Hills Tax Increment Finance Authority in the amount of $381,651, the total project cost of $1,081,651 is completely covered.\n\nFeatures of the new public square include a performance stage, a pergola down each side, raised planter boxes with seating, all-weather artificial turf, and lighting enhancements. The space will be programmed for smaller events and will generally be available during the summer months for anyone wishing to utilize the space for social interaction. Expect to see outdoor furnishings, and other amenities from time to time like cornhole and bocce. Construction is expected to begin this July and be completed by November.\n\nSee you next summer in the Public Square.\n\nThomas A. Tanghe, City Manager"
