        "text": "Originally Posted by renter8319\n\nim a white, 25 yr old male i currently live in davison and have applied for an apartment in auburn hills(countryside townhouses), i read up on the crime in auburn hills and the statistics are pretty bad, but when i drove around it seemed pretty nice(during the day though probably when people wereworking). i noticed some areas close to the complex were really nice(walton and squirrel is where the complex is located). i loved the ymca right there and there seemed to be a lot of things to do. i didn't read the crime statistics until after i applied so now im on the fence about still moving there. im not very familiar with auburn hills(i grew up in warren) so any information would be greatly appreciated. i read some stats that said during the work week the populatin grows almost double so im wondering if thes statistics are skewed because of all the people that work and go to college there or what.\n\ni specifically want to know about the area around walton and squirrel. are some parts of auburn hills better than others? where are the bad areas\n\n? where are the good areas?\n\nlike i said i'm from warren so i understand that there is crime everywhere but i dont want to worry about getting robbed, or having my valuables stolen, or a break-in. i just want to live there with confidence that im in a safe secure area. any info would be awesome thank you.\n\nalso, are there any places(bars, restaurants, stores and such that i should stay away from/visit)\n\ni prefer to associate with a ton of college guys as little as possible.(don't mind the girls though )"
