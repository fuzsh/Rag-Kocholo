        "text": "The Auburn Hills Planning Commission will be holding an informal meeting with more than 100 residents Tuesday, Jan. 19 concerning potential development in the city’s northeast corner.\n\nThe Northeast Corner Neighborhood, bounded by Dutton Road and Walton Boulevard to the north and south and Lapeer Road and the City of Rochester Hills to the west and east, was originally zoned in a way to preserve natural features.\n\nIn 2001, city officials approved a master plan, which included zoning which reduced housing density in that area of the city, but also offered developers the opportunity to build more homes if they preserved open spaces and trees.\n\nOfficials opted not to change the zoning when the plan was reviewed in 2007, but anticipated development and planned road improvements have brought the issue back to light, according to director of community development Steven Cohen.\n\nThe city’s planning commission also recently approved an amendment to the plan paving the way for a 55-and-up community to be located along Squirrel Road between Dutton and Tienken roads proposed by Auburn Hills-based Moceri Companies.\n\nTuesday’s meeting is expected to be just the first step in a months-long process, officials said.\n\nCohen said the planning commission will be looking at a possible “slight” increase in the incentives offered to encourage developers to preserve open spaces as well as address potential housing density for land along Shimmons Road near Oakland Christian School.\n\nCohen said the commission is expected to examine the potential use of land on the southeast corner of Dutton and Bald Mountain roads where Kensington Church had proposed to build prior to the economic recession of 2008.\n\nCity officials had hoped to begin the process last year, but were delayed by an investigation into a methane gas source along Dutton Road, Cohen said.\n\nTuesday’s meeting will begin at 7 p.m. at North Auburn Hills Baptist Church, located at 3889 North Squirrel Road."
