        "text": "AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (WXYZ) â€” The thick black smoke coming from the plastics company in Auburn Hills could be seen for miles Tuesday morning.\n\nMassive fire breaks out at plastics manufacturing facility in Auburn Hills\n\n\"Seeing that smoke, I was like wow! That is incredible,\" said retired Troy Fire Lieutenant Tonya Perry who saw the smoke in Troy and came to see her former colleagues joining firefighters from Auburn Hills in battling the blaze that started outside US Farathane located near University Drive and I-75.\n\nThe fire started at 10:22 a.m. and according to the National Weather Service, the smoke leveled off at about 3,500 feet in the air.\n\nAdditional firefighters and resources arrived from Waterford Regional, Rochester Hills, City of Rochester, and Oakland Township.\n\nAuburn Hills Fire Chief Ellen Taylor said plastic and metal auto part containers that had been stored outside on the south side of the building caught fire. A drone from the City of Rochester was used to help locate and extinguish hot spots that remained after most of the fire was out.\n\nChief Taylor said an estimated 20,000 storage bins had burned.\n\nUS Farathane was evacuated along with several office buildings to the south where the smoke was blowing. There were no reported injuries. Minor heat damage to one exterior side of US Farathane was reported.\n\n\"This, in a building, would have been a disaster,\" Perry said.\n\nEPA Region 5 personnel could be seen at the location, but a spokesperson later said they are not involved.\n\nUS Farathane President & CEO Andrew Greenlee released the following statement to 7 Action News:"
