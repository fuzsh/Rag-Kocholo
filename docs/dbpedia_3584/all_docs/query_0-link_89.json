        "text": "Main Births etc\n\nRochester Hills is an affluent city in northeast Oakland County of the U.S. state of Michigan, in the Metropolitan Detroit area. As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 70,995.[6]\n\nCommunities[]\n\nStoney Creek is a non-census designated village on the northeast end of the city on the border with Rochester.\n\nYates is on the boundary with Rochester and Shelby Township, Oakland County ( ; Elevation: 669 ft./204 m.).[7]\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe first European settler was James Graham who arrived in 1817. Avon Township was organized in 1835. Rochester incorporated as a village within the township in 1869. The township adopted a charter in 1948 under the Home Rule Act. Also in 1948 a post office was established under the name of Brooklands for the area between Auburn Road and Hamlin Road just to the west of Dequindre Road.[8]\n\nIn 1966, village residents voted to become the City of Rochester, effective in February 1967. As a result, Rochester residents no longer had to pay property taxes to the township, as it was now a separate municipality.\n\nIn 1967, Avon Township filed a petition to become a city. In January 1968, township voters approved the petition to move forward with seeking city status. Three proposed city charters were voted down by residents, the first in March 1969, the second in May 1970, and the third in September 1971. The city of Rochester then sought to annex all of the township, which was unanimously denied by the Michigan Boundary Commission. In 1972, petitions were filed to consolidate Avon Township and Rochester. In April 1974, the consolidation petition lost by 350 votes in the township, while passing by four votes in Rochester. In May 1974, Rochester's petition to annex 2.2 square miles (5.7 km2) of Avon Township was approved by the Michigan Boundary Commission. The township became Avon Charter Township in August 1978. Court challenges to the 1974 annexation continued until November 1981, when the township was ordered to surrender the annexed property.\n\nIn May 1984, township voters approved a city charter. On November 20, 1984, Avon Township became the City of Rochester Hills. The name of the new city was put to a vote, with the other choice being \"Avon Hills\". The name \"Rochester Hills\" won with voters based on the area's historical ties to Rochester, and the rolling hills that exist in the area. Township Supervisor Earl E. Borden became Rochester Hills' first mayor.\n\nGeography[]\n\nRochester Hills is bordered to the north by Oakland Charter Township, to the south by the city by the city of Troy, to the east by Shelby Township in Macomb County, and to the west by the city of Auburn Hills. Rochester Hills is also bordered by the city of Rochester to the south, east, and west. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 32.91 square miles (85.24 km2), of which, 32.82 square miles (85.00 km2) is land and 0.09 square miles (0.23 km2) is water.[1] Elevations in the city range from 690 feet (210 m) above sea level in the southeastern portion of the city to 1,010 feet (310 m) in the northwestern portion of the city.\n\nOrion Township Oakland Township Washington Township Auburn Hills Rochester\n\nShelby Township\n\nRochester Hills Bloomfield Township Troy Sterling Heights\n\nDemographics[]\n\n2010 census[]\n\nAs of the census[2] of 2010, there were 70,995 people, 27,578 households, and 19,308 families residing in the city.
