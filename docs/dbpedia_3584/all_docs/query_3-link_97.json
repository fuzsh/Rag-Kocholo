Our community is close enough to the hustle and bustle to be convenient, yet the natural surroundings provide tranquility after a long day.\n\nMoceri Companies started building custom properties four generations ago. Founded by Detroit grocer Sabastian “Buster” Moceri, who relied on his relationships with area farmers to acquire choice land for future development, the company has become Metro Detroit icon of quality building. Day-to-day operations and concurrent construction are handled by the fourth generation of Moceri's. Brothers Frank, Dominic J., and Mario proudly carry on the tradition of their family’s more than 50 years of experience in quality development, construction, financing, consulting, and architectural design.\n\nWe now have five rental communities currently operating, in addition to our single-family home and condominium developments. These properties span Oakland Township, Northville, Bloomfield, Orion Township, Macomb, South Lyon, and many other prime locations.\n\nIn addition to building superior properties, the Moceri's believe they have an obligation to uphold the beauty and serenity of our natural surroundings. Therefore, each of their properties is built with the Green Initiative in mind.\n\n4100 Heron Springs Blvd., Lake Orion, MI 48359"
