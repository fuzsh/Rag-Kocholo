        "text": "Oakland Township is less densely populated than neighboring townships to the west, south, and east; and retains many elements of a rural, wooded residential bedroom community. Local ordinances and zoning laws are aimed at limiting commercial and industrial development while maintaining a cap on population density by way of a master plan.\n\nOakland Township has the distinction of being one of Michigan's oldest townships. It was one of the original 25 townships in the Territory of Michigan when counties were further divided into townships in 1827. The Township is a complete 36 square miles.\n\nA grist mill and mill race was built on Paint Creek in 1835. Later named Goodison Mill, it operated for more than 100 years before being dismantled in the late 1940s. The former site of the mill is the current location of Paint Creek Cider Mill, which is home to the Oakland Township Parks and Recreation, among other offices and a year round Cider Mill/Restaurant.\n\nCurrently the Township is served by three school districts: Rochester Community Schools, Lake Orion Community Schools, and Romeo Community Schools. There are also three private schools: Eagle Creek Academy, Premier Academy, and Alpine Academy."
