        "text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nSeptember 26, 2023\n\nContact: press@michigan.gov\n\nGov. Whitmer Announces Nearly 900 Good-Paying Jobs, 170 Homes, and Dozens of Community Investment Projects Coming to Michigan\n\nLANSING, Mich. – Today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced the state has landed two economic expansions with Nel Hydrogen creating 517 jobs in Plymouth Charter Township and Samsung SDI America adding 368 jobs in Auburn Hills. The state also approved support for 170 new homes in Detroit and additional community investment around Michigan. The projects underscore the state’s dedication to advancing Michigan’s strengths as a leader in hydrogen and the automotive industry and supporting projects that create thriving communities and opportunities for business attraction across the state.\n\n“Today’s investments will create nearly 900 good-paying jobs, build housing, revitalize main streets and downtowns, and grow our economy,” said Governor Whitmer. “We will continue competing against other states and nations to bring projects home to Michigan, creating good-paying, high-skills jobs building batteries, electric vehicles and components, and more. Together, we will also ensure every Michigander can ‘Make it in Michigan’ by making cities and towns better places to live, work, and invest. Michigan is on the move, with low unemployment, strong job growth, and nation-leading mobility, electrification, and battery industries. Let’s keep getting it done.”\n\nNel Hydrogen to Establish New Gigafactory in Plymouth Charter Township, Creating 517 Jobs\n\nNel Hydrogen has chosen Plymouth Charter Township as the location its new automated gigafactory for production of electrolyzer technology for green hydrogen production. The announcement builds on Michigan’s leadership in advanced manufacturing and clean energy; in fact, Michigan was recognized as the top state in the Midwest for clean energy jobs in the Clean Jobs America report from Environmental Entrepreneurs released in September 2023.\n\nThe project, expected to generate a total capital investment of up to $400 million and create more than 500 good-paying clean energy manufacturing jobs, will be supported in part by a $10 million Michigan Business Development Program grant. The MSF board also approved a 15-year, 100-percent State Essential Services Assessment Exemption Request, valued at up to $6.25 million, in support of the project.\n\nRead more details about the project in the press release here.\n\nSamsung SDI America, Inc. to Expand at Two Auburn Hills Facilities, Creating 368 High-Wage Jobs\n\nSamsung SDI America, Inc. is a leading manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries for the auto industry. The company’s North American headquarters are in the city of Auburn Hills and it currently employs 679 Michiganders at its two facilities in Auburn Hills.\n\nSamsung is looking to double its manufacturing capacity to meet customer needs in the automotive sector and plans to expand its two Auburn Hills facilities, where it will make production line expansions, improvements to employee wellbeing facilities, and IT upgrades.\n\nThe project is expected to generate a total capital investment of $41 million and create 368 new high-wage jobs with the support of a $5 million Michigan Business Development Program performance-based grant. Michigan was chosen for the expansion over competing sites in Indiana or other states in the Midwest due to the company’s existing presence and talent base in the state.\n\n“Samsung SDI America is proud to be expanding our facility in Auburn Hills,” said Samsung SDI America General Counsel and Vice President of Legal and Public Affairs Joe Pittel. “We are grateful to the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and our government partners in Auburn Hills and Oakland County for their support, which makes this expansion possible. This expansion plan, critical to our operations, will allow us to better support our customers, and will result in hundreds of new jobs for those eager to take part in the electrification revolution. We are proud of the Michiganders we employ and are thrilled to be playing a small part in Michigan’s bright future.”\n\nThe project supports the state’s work to position itself as the global leader in the future of mobility and electric vehicles and will bring immediate jobs with a strong and expanding auto supplier. It will also solidify the company’s presence and future business in the state.\n\nThe city of Auburn Hills has offered marketing assistance in support of the project and Oakland County Michigan Works! has pledged significant support for training and workforce development.

The project also includes amenities for residents and greenspace to enhance quality of living while restoring an entire historic block of the Lower Cass Corridor.\n\nToday, the MSF approved a $6.493 million Michigan Community Revitalization Program performance-based direct loan in support of the Henry Street Redevelopment project’s market rate portion. The City of Detroit is also supporting the project with $2 million in local HOME funds for the affordable portion of the project.\n\n“We appreciate this level of funding support from our state policy makers,\" said Chris Laurent, president of Cinnaire Solutions, codeveloper of the Henry Street Renaissance project. \"This loan provides a significant financial step allowing us to close the gap that resulted from unprecedented development cost increases. Along with the leadership and expertise of Olympia Development, we look forward to breaking ground in the coming months and preserving a historic block in the Lower Cass Corridor while bringing quality newly renovated housing to Detroiters.\"\n\nKeith Bradford, President of Olympia Development of Michigan and The District Detroit, also shared, “We thank the state for their support and look forward to getting started with Cinnaire Solutions, a partner who shares our commitment to improving communities, in Detroit. This development will offer much needed housing and will be complemented by a community center for residents, greenspace, and parking – all of which will transform an entire city block in the Lower Cass Corridor.”\n\nThe overall Henry Street Redevelopment will increase the availability of market-rate and affordable units while rehabilitating and restoring historic, underutilized buildings in a high-traffic area of downtown Detroit.\n\n“We are excited about the partnership between Olympia Development of Michigan and Cinnaire to rehabilitate this entire block of residential buildings and provide nearly half of the units at deeply affordable rents,” said Julie Schneider, Director of Housing and Revitalization Department at the City of Detroit. “We have worked very closely with the developers and appreciate their commitment to ensuring that existing residents can continue to live there during and after the renovation process at rents comparable to what they are paying today.”\n\nCommunity Development Block Grant Program funding approved to expand and create public gathering spaces in 16 communities across Michigan\n\nToday, the MSF also approved a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program request from 16 units of local government to fund the expansion and creation of public gathering spaces in their communities. Projects include improvement to parks, town squares, amphitheaters, plazas, waterfronts, and playgrounds, benefitting communities across the state.\n\nIn addition to the $20 million in CDBG funds for the 16 projects, MSF also approved up to $800,000 in CDBG funds to provide administrative services to assist the communities with the compliance and administrative requirements of the awards.\n\nIn February 2023, the CDBG program opened the 2023 Public Gathering Spaces Initiative competitive funding round; the initiative received 25 eligible applications with over $30 million in requests. The selected communities meet a national objective by providing benefit to at least 51-percent low- and moderate-income populations in the state, increasing usability, accessibility, and seasonality within new or existing community spaces.\n\nThe 16 communities awarded with CDBG funds are: City of Three Rivers, City of Cadillac, City of Corunna, City of Alpena, City of Manton, City of Howell, Village of Cassopolis, Briley Township, City of Reed City, City of Fennville, Village of Port Austin, City of Caspian, Village of Muir, Village of Mackinac City, Village of Fowlerville, and the City of Litchfield.\n\n“On behalf of the City of Cadillac, we are honored and thrilled to have our improvement project located at The Market at Cadillac Commons under consideration by the Michigan Strategic Fund,” said Marcus A. Peccia, City Manager, City of Cadillac. “The primary goal of our project is to improve the capacity and usefulness of the facility to a four-season space by enclosing the structure with glass doors, providing green infrastructure and utilizing environmental improvements, increasing our multi-modal facilities, while also improving the programming of The Market and other Cadillac Commons spaces, and adding permanent restroom facilities. This endeavor would not be possible but for the strong desire and willingness of both the State of Michigan Economic Development Corporation and City of Cadillac to collaborate and work together on such a creative project that will create an amazing space for all to gather at and use within our community.”\n\nStrategic Site Readiness Program grants to support 11 regional sites across the state; Marshall strategic site\n\nToday, MSF also approved a request from the MEDC to award Strategic Site Readiness Program (SSRP) grants to 11 economic development organizations (EDOs) located in the state’s 10 prosperity regions, totaling $25 million in support. The purpose of the SSRP is to create an inventory of investment-ready sites to attract and promote investment in Michigan for activities on, or related to, strategic sites and strategic mega-sites.\n\n“The funds approved by the MSF Board today are critical to the implementation of our Statewide Site Readiness program,” said Paul O’Connell, MEDC Vice President of Real Estate Development. “These funds allow our regional and local partners to independently identify the sites in their community that fit the unique needs of each of Michigan’s ten prosperity regions. We look forward to working with our partners to build a pipeline of the best sites in the nation which will bring jobs and continued economic opportunity to all people in the state of Michigan.\n\nThe 11 EDOs receiving SSRP grants are: InvestUP, Northwest Michigan Council of Governments, Northeast Michigan Council of Governments, The Right Place, Saginaw Future, Flint & Genesee Chamber of Commerce, Lansing Economic Area Partnership, Southwest Michigan First, Cornerstone Alliance, Ann Arbor SPARK, and Detroit Regional Partnership.\n\n“We continue to be grateful for the continued commitment that the MEDC and the Administration have made to ensuring regional relevance with economic development opportunity,” said Marty Fittante, CEO of InvestUP. “The investment awarded today through the Site Readiness programming is the latest meaningful example of that commitment. We are excited to put this investment to work across the region into strategic sites that would otherwise be left wanting for necessary infrastructure and put those properties in a position to drive economic growth for the Upper Peninsula.”\n\nIn December 2021, Governor Whitmer signed a package of economic incentives including the SSRP to allow Michigan to compete for – and win – transformational projects that will bring long-term economic opportunity and security to regions and communities across the state.\n\nThe Marshall Area Economic Development Alliance (MAEDA) is a non-profit economic development alliance in the city of Marshall, responsible for attracting new business and industry, retaining businesses, and promoting tourism in the Marshall area.\n\nIn support of MAEDA’s request for incentive assistance for site readiness activities at and around the Marshall strategic site, the MSF also approved a $65 million SSRP performance-based grant. The funds will be used for land acquisition, site studies and preparation, water and wastewater upgrades, road enhancements, professional fees, administration and other necessary public infrastructure improvements.\n\n“Investment in this campus now will allow us to have a site ready for future suppliers and new businesses – and that means even more local jobs in Marshall long into the future,” said Jim Durian, CEO of MAEDA.\n\nSupport for land assemblage and infrastructure improvements will help reduce costs and create a more attractive site for business attraction and expansion opportunities.\n\n“The projects approved today build on Michigan’s growing leadership in hydrogen technology and automotive electrification, support the vibrancy of our communities, and embrace the significance of our state’s history and housing needs,” said MEDC CEO and MSF President and Chair Quentin L. Messer, Jr. “We thank Governor Whitmer, legislators from both parties, and local officials for their continued support, and share our appreciation for the Michigan Strategic Fund board for their hard work throughout the year. Our work continues as we fight to earn private investments, attract projects, and support our 10-million-plus friends and neighbors as they Make It in Michigan daily and encourage others to do so.”\n\nLocal voices in support of today’s projects:\n\nNel Hydrogen:\n\n“Plymouth Township is honored to have been selected by Nel Hydrogen for this revolutionary facility that will help bring a new source of clean, sustainable energy to power the future of the auto industry and beyond,” said Township Supervisor Kurt Heise. “This $400 million investment by Nel will bring 600 new jobs to our community and will be the centerpiece of our Michigan International Technology Center Redevelopment Authority – converting vacant prison properties into engines for jobs and economic development. I want to thank the MEDC for their support, along with Wayne County CEO Warren Evans, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, and the Detroit Regional Partnership for their hard work to help make this project a reality.”\n\n“In mobility and beyond, companies and consumers are making increasing demands for clean, sustainable energy. Nel’s products and technology are an absolutely critical piece to enabling our economy to decarbonize, and to fully leverage the potential of hydrogen,” said Maureen Donohue Krauss, President and CEO of the Detroit Regional Partnership. “The Detroit Regional Partnership is grateful that Nel has chosen to bring this world-class facility, and high-quality engineering and manufacturing jobs, to the Detroit Region, and we look forward to supporting their long-term growth in our market.”\n\n“I am very excited to have Nel Hydrogen, a global leader in renewable energy coming to Plymouth Township! The Michigan International Technology Center (MITC) located in Plymouth Township is the right place for Nel and perfectly suited for this growing industry,” said Senator Rosemary Bayer (D-West Bloomfield). “Nel Hydrogen is also a perfect fit for Michigan; creating one of the largest electrolyzer plants in the world and expanding Michigan’s position when it comes to renewable energy.”\n\n“I applaud Nel Hydrogen’s selection of Plymouth for their new manufacturing facility,” said State Rep. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor). “This facility stands as a testament to Michigan’s skilled workforce, spirit of innovation, and groundbreaking collaboration among our universities and research institutions. Together, we’re driving clean energy innovation, combating climate change, creating jobs, and making a more sustainable future.”\n\n“Nel Hydrogen’s investment in Plymouth Township is a testament to Michigan's commitment to advanced manufacturing and clean energy innovation,” said State Rep. Matt Koleszar (D-Plymouth). “Together, we are driving progress towards a sustainable future, where emerging technology meets our state's rich manufacturing heritage. This investment not only bolsters our economy but also solidifies Michigan's role as a leader in the clean energy revolution.”\n\nSamsung SDI America, Inc.:\n\n“Congratulations to Samsung SDI on their expansion in the Detroit Region, which continues to be the premier place to develop next-generation mobility technology,” said Maureen Donohue Krauss, president and CEO, Detroit Regional Partnership. “This investment reflects the rapid growth of high-tech batteries that are changing the way the world moves as we work toward a cleaner energy future.”\n\n“With top talent, excellence and innovation at the core of its business, Samsung SDI America continues to grow in Auburn Hills and we are incredibly proud of all of their accomplishments,” said Auburn Hills Mayor Kevin R. McDaniel. “Their reinvestment in our community is a testament to their commitment and dedication to their partners and customers around the world. We are grateful for their trust and confidence and look forward to their continued success in Auburn Hills.”\n\n“The mobility industry of the future has roots and is growing in Michigan and Oakland County,” said Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter. “And Samsung SDI America’s decision to double its manufacturing capacity right here in Auburn Hills helps position the region as a global leader in EV manufacturing.”\n\nCommunity Development Block Grant Program:\n\n“I can’t express how excited we are to bring the Culligan Plaza renovation project to fruition for the Alpena community,” said Rachel Smolinski, City Manager, City of Alpena. “We asked the community what they wanted for this space in the heart of their downtown and the new design is a true reflection of all that feedback. The project will replace aging and outdated infrastructure with a vibrant, accessible, and engaging public space for the community to enjoy year-round. In addition, we will add much needed public restrooms to the downtown and include improvements to the adjacent parking area. I would like to thank the community, the Culligan Plaza planning committee, First Federal Legacy Foundation of Northern Michigan, City of Alpena staff, and Target Alpena for their work to bring this project together.”\n\n“The impact this grant would have on our small-town culture would be astronomical,” said Amanda Nienaltowski, Clerk, Village of Port Austin. “To create a town center and promote community building through year-round activities, would change our summer tourist town into the place for residents and visitors throughout the year! The possibilities are endless for what we could provide to the public with a Four-Season Farmers Market structure. We are striving to create a sense of community and provide a place for people to come together.”\n\nStrategic Site Readiness Program:\n\n\"These site readiness funds from the state empower LEAP and the many interested communities across our tri-county Lansing region to properly prepare economic development sites of various sizes to compete for compelling investment projects that are community-aligned and create good jobs,\" said Bob Trezise, president and CEO of LEAP. “This early groundwork on things like real estate assembly, environmental due diligence, community engagement and infrastructure planning can make all the difference in meeting the information and operational timeline needs of an ideal business user so they choose Michigan.”\n\n###"
