Contact an attorney as soon as you are charged with a crime or if you have a warrant for your arrest.\n\nDrunk Driving Cases: In 2021, over 3,000 individuals were tested in Oakland County for alcohol and/or drugs with most of these cases resulting in criminal charges for driving under the influence. Drunk driving cases are some of the most prevalent criminal cases processed in the 52-3 District Court. If you are facing an OWI in the 52-3 District Court, you can expect to be put on drug and/or alcohol testing even if you are only charged with a first time OWI with a low blood alcohol content (BAC). If you get convicted of a second drunk driving within 7 years of a prior offense for driving under the influence, your license will be revoked for 1 year unless you get accepted in a Sobriety Court program. A person convicted of an OWI with a High BAC of .17 or greater will not be able to operate a vehicle unless it has a breath alcohol ignition interlock device (BAIID) installed. The complete license sanction for OWI with a High BAC is as follows: no driving for the first 45 days followed by a restricted license for 320 days with a BAIID. Contact a criminal defense lawyer that specializes in drunk driving to find out about getting your charge reduced, avoiding jail, and keeping your driverâ€™s license.\n\nCriminal Cases: Hire an attorney to get you out of the system if you are charged with a criminal matter. Some of the most prevalent criminal matters that we have handled in the 52-3 District Court are as follows:\n\nDisorderly Conduct\n\nDomestic Violence\n\nRetail Fraud (shoplifting)\n\nAssault with a Dangerous Weapon\n\nDrug Crimes\n\nEmbezzlement\n\nUttering and Publishing\n\nCarrying a Concealed Weapon\n\nDriving While License Suspended or Revoked\n\nLeaving the Scene of an Accident (hit and run)\n\nTraffic Tickets: Thousands of traffic tickets are handed out in Michigan every year. Yet less than 5% of all tickets are contested. Even a 2 point speeding ticket will get in rated as a higher risk with your insurance company that will result in a bump in your premiums. Consider hiring a lawyer to fight every traffic ticket to avoid getting hit with points and higher insurance premiums.\n\nContact Abdo Law for a free consultation if you need an attorney in the counties of Macomb, Oakland, or Wayne. We have represented over 10,000 clients and we know how to get you out of the court system with the best results possible."
