Drunk Driving Cases: In 2021, over 3,000 individuals were tested in Oakland County for alcohol and/or drugs with most of these cases resulting in criminal charges for driving under the influence. Drunk driving cases are some of the most prevalent criminal cases processed in the 52-3 District Court. If you are facing an OWI in the 52-3 District Court, you can expect to be put on drug and/or alcohol testing even if you are only charged with a first time OWI with a low blood alcohol content (BAC). If you get convicted of a second drunk driving within 7 years of a prior offense for driving under the influence, your license will be revoked for 1 year unless you get accepted in a Sobriety Court program. A person convicted of an OWI with a High BAC of .17 or greater will not be able to operate a vehicle unless it has a breath alcohol ignition interlock device (BAIID) installed. The complete license sanction for OWI with a High BAC is as follows: no driving for the first 45 days followed by a restricted license for 320 days with a BAIID. Contact a criminal defense lawyer that specializes in drunk driving to find out about getting your charge reduced, avoiding jail, and keeping your driverâ€™s license.
