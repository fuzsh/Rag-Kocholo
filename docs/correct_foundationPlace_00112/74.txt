People need public landâ€”and for 30 years, The Southern California Mountains Foundation has worked to protect it. Through conservation initiatives, innovative environmental education, and the operation of the largest discovery center and local corps serving the Inland Empire, we empower people to learn and protect the San Bernardino National Forest.
