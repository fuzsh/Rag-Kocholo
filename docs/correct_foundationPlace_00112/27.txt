The CCC Foundation supports diversity at every level. Registration and participation are open to all former foster youth, people of color, and members of the LGBTQIA2S+ community ages 18 to 25. We invite you to join the hundreds of previous CCCF participants who have already experienced this unique opportunity to serve California. There are no educational requirements; the CCCF programs provide an exciting new opportunity for young Americans looking for meaningful skills training, experience, and service opportunities designed to help improve their chances for success in the future. When you’re ready for meaningful experiences, travel, adventure, and delivering impactful service in your home community, check out our programs below!
