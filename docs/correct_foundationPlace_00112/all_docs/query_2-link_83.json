        "text": "The California Foundation on the Environment and the Economy (CFEE) is an independent, nonprofit institution dedicated to educating public and private sector decision makers on, and developing creative solutions to, California's complex economic, environmental and social issues. Recognized as a highly effective public policy forum, the Foundation brings together senior executives from California's major corporations and statewide labor leaders, as well as leading advocates from environmental and consumer organizations to meet with legislators and regulatory officials in an atmosphere of non-adversarial cooperation. CFEE seeks full exploration of controversial issues in a manner that transcends adversarial relationships by encouraging the development of common interests and workable policies rather than institutionalized conflict.\n\nâ€‹\n\nCreated in 1979 to advance consensus among those on the frontier of decision-making, the Foundation accelerates the process for developing collaborative and innovative approaches to critical issues. The Foundation develops and conducts public policy conferences as well as study travel projects abroad to educate California leadership on issues and gain insights from the experience of other states and nations."
