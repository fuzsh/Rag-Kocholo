        "text": "FMIGs are committed to promoting the family medicine specialty at their campus, igniting interest in primary care and inspiring students to serve their local community. We support all California FMIGs through funding and technical assistance.\n\nHow to access funds for your FMIG:\n\nCAFP Foundation provides $400 to spend on general programming. These monies are available each academic year through a reimbursement process. No application is required. When completing the reimbursement form, please include pictures from the event, a copy of the sign-in sheet, and the receipts.\n\nAll Member Advocacy Meeting\n\nThe All Member Advocacy Meeting (AMAM) provides an invaluable experience to get involved in CAFP’s legislative advocacy efforts. Each year, family physicians, residents and medical students meet in Sacramento to learn about hot-button issues in California health care; hear from experts; and participate in trainings on advocacy, messaging and leadership.\n\nClosed as of February 5, 2024.\n\nThe Student Research Grant Program gives students the opportunity to work with a practicing or academic family physician to conduct clinical or educational research. CAFP-F provides grants in the amount of $2,500, with $500 of this amount going to the mentoring physician. Funds are distributed in 2 payments: $1,000 will be provided at the beginning of the study, and the remaining amount will be given upon submission of the final report.\n\nCAFP-F is committed to supporting pathway projects that promote diversity in family medicine and develop a new generation of community leaders. These initiatives strengthen the family medicine pipeline from high school through medical school and residency. Currently, we help fund the following programs:\n\n• Future Faces of Family Medicine High School Pathway Program - Ukiah Valley FMR\n\n• Dr.EAM (Doctors Educating, Advocating, & Mentoring) Pathways - Sonoma County\n\n• Emerging Health Advocates - Riverside/San Bernardino\n\n• Sutter FMRP Future Faces of Family Medicine Program\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about this program, please contact pmann@familydocs.org."
