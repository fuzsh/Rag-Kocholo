        "text": "At the heart of golf and giving\n\nWhat began as a golf game between friends in 1937, Monterey Peninsula Foundation has consistently hosted world-class golf charity events, using the proceeds to power positive community change across Monterey, San Benito, and Santa Cruz Counties. Our mission, and everything we do, centers on golf and giving.\n\nEach year, we stage two celebrated golf tournaments: the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am on the PGA TOUR and the PURE Insurance Championship at Pebble Beach, a PGA TOUR Champions event. The community investments that stem from each of these golf tournaments support hundreds of nonprofits working to impact thousands of lives in the Central Coast region in California.\n\nLearn More About Our Mission\n\nMonterey Peninsula Foundation strives to serve the diverse and important needs of the communities in our region. We believe in the power of consistent support and the necessity of building organizational capacity, rooted in our legacy spanning eight decades. We are committed to the wisdom that comes from considering honestly what works and what doesnâ€™t. We believe that learning from our work with our nonprofit partners is of critical importance to growing impact that lasts. We believe in community philanthropy as a powerful force to spark big dreams and to fuel the small steps to get us there.\n\n2023 Impact Report\n\nWe are passionate about the quality of life in the region, and look for strategic ways to create safe, healthy, and thriving communities in everything we do.\n\nFrom providing grants across the region, to the economic impact of these two tournaments, to the collaboration with other community organizations, Monterey Peninsula Foundation remains committed to its tradition of history-making golf and forward-looking philanthropy."
