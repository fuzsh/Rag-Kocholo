        "text": "puppylinux.com, puppylinux.com now hosted on ibiblio\n\nWe are still getting organised on this, and I've been distracted by the mini-holiday plus urgent bugs in 2.16alpha, but here is basically what has happened.\n\nI've been getting too many Internet-related bills, so wanted to simplify things re the hosting. The ibiblio people have very kindly agreed to provide virtual hosting for us, with a modest amount of space for web pages. Now, Ted Dog is in much worse situation than me, financial and health-wise. He has registered puppylinux.com but the hosting account expired. So, we have got together and pointed puppylinux.com and puppylinux.com to the new ibiblio site. Ibiblio require us to point both domains at the same front page.\n\nMy plan is not to renew my Netirms account, which hosts all the 'puppylinux' domains and I will park those domains somewhere with redirection to the puppylinux.com/net site -- I think it's also possible to emnbed an instruction to search engines to use the redirected-to domain in future?\n\nI will probably move my blog to puppylinux.com.\n\nTed Dog will be involved with the ibiblio site. I think that we will be able to host some small puplets on the ibiblio puppylinux ftp download site and Ted Dog will be maintainer and coordinator of that, plus maybe some other stuff.\n\nNote, Ted Dog also has puptrix.org, for which hosting is paid-up for another year.\n\nThe ibiblio people have been very kind, and I do have to be careful not to take too much advantage of that. As much as possible should be hosted elsewhere. Everything hosted by ibiblio has to be non-commercial, and I can't sell CDs, so have removed that from the download page.\n\nHowever, CDs can be sold from the puppylinux.org site, hosted by Servage. Due to sales referrals, this site is paid up until 2012! The main problem with that site is bandwidth -- we ran into limits sometime back, but it's been good for awhile.\n\nklhrevolutionist\n\nBarry, I really wished you had asked the community for more help on this. What I meant is maybe a fundraiser or some contest to create more revenue. Anyway, I am glad that you are able to manage what is on your plate !\n\nI was told to give a look at these fellas: http://www.site5.com/\n\nA fellow irc member & puppy user directed me to that website and he is now using them over nearlyfreespeech.net\n\nBarry, I would be more than willing to help with the Internet bills and would also be happy to help out with the hosting issues. The present state of the net permits a fair level of lateral thinking to be applied to how large files are hosted for download. I've already done quite a bit of research on the subject for a couple of other projects that i've been working on.\n\nPlease do contact me by email, you already have my email address and I've put it in this post to make it even simpler.\n\nCheers,\n\nMark\n\nTed Dog\n\nMark,\n\nEducate us dude. I have a idea to setup a directory for sfs, pet, & pups, that our torrent client would be configured to use. That way easy sharing and we have a way to tell what can be pruned from the servers. I have looked into this but lack the server side know-how.\n\nBarry Kauler\n\nThanks for the sentiments guys!\n\nWhat has happened is good, as ibiblio is free. Also, they have new hardware and their site is faster. As longer as the University of North Carolina wants to keep supporting ibiblio as a free host, all is fine...\n\nIbiblio require us to have a .net or .org as their hosting is non-commercial, and an additional .com is allowed. That's why we need the puppylinux.com for ibiblio -- and it makes sense to have that domain name for the \"official\" non-commercial site.\n\nAnother big plus with ibiblio is the mirrors, and no bandwidth limit. The only thing they warn about is not to use them as a place to host stuff that could be hosted elsewhere.\n\nSo, ibiblio is a good solution, but of course we need more hosting for the heaps of other stuff we have, such as SFSs, DotPups, a myriad of puplets (some very big), wikis, forums, etc.\n\nSince I'm setup okay with ibiblio, I'm thinking that what we should aim for is a community-supported site that is a host for downloads, like puppylinux.org (which is really our community information/wiki site) -- puppylinux.org has worked well, as referrals have made it paid-up until 2012.\n\nThere could be donations going directly to this new community site to maintain it, rather than involving me. Mark, what you have already wetup could be the basis of this site? ...well, I suppose it already is, but we could make it a bit more formal, with a donation mechanism to sustain it.\n\nI'm thinking too, I could hand over the 'puppylinux' domains to this community site, if they are wanted. Maybe I could give the 'keys' to Ted Dog or Mark and they could be pointed at the community download site -- only if you want to keep alive the 'puppylinux' name.\n\nMarkUlrich\n\nyes, especially isos and sfs need a reliable solution.\n\nI was planning to spend the donations I got meanwhile for another domain, just for new files, to reduce traffic.\n\nBut if we could use ibiblio.org - perfect.\n\nI then would keep the donations to pay the next year-rates for puppyfiles.org only as a dotpup-repository (packages in general), and drop puppyisos.org.\n\npuppyfiles.org will get a webinterface to allow easy uploads like in the murga-forum, but based on Ftp.\n\nSo it still will make sense to use it, as a \"quick and dirty\" upload place, while ibiblio.org could be used as an archive mirror.\n\nThe dotpups might be mirrored then on a montly base from puppyfiles.org to ibiblio.org.\n\nI think ibiblio.org will not allow \"quick\" uploads by \"suspicious\" users, at least this was an issue when I got the offer to host files on the Suse/Debian servers by Max Plack Institute.\n\nMark\n\nHi, as always I want to thank Barry and all others for hard work. Cheers!\n\nMight I suggest that Torrents are the answer for all files. Correct me if I am wrong but...\n\nA Torrent run from a server will always use less bandwidth than the equivalent number of downloads (Assuming more than 1 other person is connected?\n\nIt is scalable, when a new Puppy is released the more that connect to download the more available it becomes. Puppy members are so helpful I am sure they would keep seeding for a while (I know I would be very happy to help that way)\n\nIf all Torrents were kept at one site then it would be less frustrating to find files which tend to be in a number of different places in my experience, a fair number of whom tend to be down.)\n\nPerhaps the primary download link could be for Torrent with a more tucked away direct link in case of lack of Torrent client (I think most people nowadays have such a client) or other problems\n\nAll the best\n\nTony (veronicathecow)\n\nlvds\n\nHi Barry,\n\nMay be it would be good to think at a business plan for puppy. Such things can be done easily nowadays and contribute also to consolidate a strong linux distribution. Many users are willing to help you for your puppy distirbution, even though they do not always know how to. Having a business plan would canalise everybody's efforts.\n\nTo tell you how easy it is, when we have decided over here to publicly distribute our remastered puppy (which was aimed at support for the gamers community of Dofus) we created one in an hour. Well it was more than a test to check viability of such a plan instead of really willing to gain money. The test proved to be efficient and in the context of your puppy distro it could help better.\n\nAs a worldwide used distribution, i believe users would be more than happy to contribute at supporting their preferred distribution, and moreover it would not cost anything to anyone.\n\nps: i don't know if this is the right place to discuss this, but while at work the firewall prevent me from access to www.murga-linux.com forum (though i have access to all other forums, there might be something setted up differenlty on www.murga-linux.com)\n\nBest regards,\n\nLaurent.\n\nBarry Kauler\n\nMark, I think that you have misread my post. I think that I wrote it ambiguously. What I intended to convey is that ibiblio.org cannot be an archive for other than the main official Puppy plus perhaps a couple of small puplets. My proposal was a separate host like your puppyisos.org, that will be directly supported by a donation mechanism.\n\nEric/caneri (ericmulcaster<at>gmail.com)\n\nBarry..I loved the pictures of your trip. My little project for free space/bandwidth for the pup is still on track. I have just talked with the provider (Monday May 7) and they are still interested in supplying puppy with space etc. It is just a slow process with such a large corporation. I have a asked for 10-20 gb space and 5-15tb /month of bandwidth. Although I can't make promises, I think there may be a positive outcome from this...I can only hope.\n\nCheers\n\nEric/caneri\n\nMark Ulrich\n\nok, I see.\n\nSo I will continue to look for a practicable solution.\n\nThe MaxPlanck servers would be great, but we would need a rsync computer with DSL.\n\nI found no appartment yet, so can not do that on my own.\n\nErics proposal looks interesting, too.\n\nPuppyisos currently has 40-25060 GB traffic/day, but it gets deactivated when 100GB were reached.\n\nSo an account with 1 terabyte would be fantastic.\n\nAlso the thing posted by Kenny looks interesting, though I'm sceptical about \"traps\". Servage also seemed fantastic at first sight, and it certainly is for this price.\n\nBut these cheap prices always have some limitations of course.\n\nMark\n\nMark Ulrich\n\noops... should be \"40-260 GB traffic/day\"\n\nRaffy\n\nThis is a test - CGI error was here in previous two visits.\n\nWhy not make the ibiblio site as a top domain for Puppy Linux, like puppylinuxweb.org or the current puppylinux.org, maintained by Barry himself? This is consistent with what was already done with pupweb. And ibiblio will be happy with a .org name. If Barry decides on using the latter, the current website can be given another name.\n\nPuppy 2.16alpha available for testing\n\nThis is not a general release, it is for our band of Puppy-testers only. Download from here:\n\nftp://ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/puppylinux/test/\n\nIt should also filter through to the ibiblio mirrors.\n\nIt's 2.55pm on Wednesday 25th April right now, and this evening I have to go to a function, then tomorrow morning depart on an adventure to the mining town of Tom Price. I will have sporadic Internet access, so will keep in touch with feedback on the 2.16alpha, plus I'll have my laptop with me so will keep developing.\n\nThis 2.16alpha is basically what 2.16-final will be, so is the recommended environment for Puppy developers and testers. There will be some changes, maybe some package upgrades, definiely some bugfixes, then there will be 2.16beta before the final release.\n\nSome notes on 2.16alpha:\n\n1\n\nThere may be an issue with the SFS Boot Manager if you upgrade from an existing pup_save file. I did so, then chose to load the openoffice-2.2.0.sfs module, but the icons didn't appear on the desktop. It may have just been something peculiar about my pup_save file, don't know yet. Worked fine with a new pup_save file, adding and removing the SFS module.\n\n2\n\nThe Boot Manager is in the System menu, but it will popup when you bootup with a new pup_save file.\n\n3.\n\nIf upgrading from 2.16exp3, do NOT use the pup_save that you may have tested it with, and be absolutely certain to delete pup_216.sfs and zdrv_216.sfs that will be found in the same partition as the pup_save file.\n\n4.\n\nWhich leads to another point: Puppy will copy .sfs files off the CD into the same hd partition as the pup_save file, for faster loading. 2.16exp3 was the first to do this, hence you have to get rid of them.\n\n5.\n\nYou may not like the grey desktop background -- too stark? weird? ...well, you are welcome to design something. I want very simple, light color, without 'noise'.\n\n6.\n\nBooting from Flash drive now has true flushing. I have only tested from USB Flash, but I presume IDE CF card will work the same. The concept can be applied to multisession-CD/DVD but I have not yet implemented that.\n\n7.\n\nOn the subject of auto-saving to Flash drive, a message pops up every 30 minutes -- if that becomes too annoying, I'm open to suggestions, like maybe something more discrete.\n\nTo find out what is new, you will have to read down this blog. But, I think the most exciting things from user's viewpoint are the SFS Boot Manager and the true flushing for Flash drives.\n\nThere's lots of stuff we will be testing on the 2.16alpha platform, for example from Dougal, Rarsa and Zigbert, for intended inclusion in 2.16beta.\n\nThis alpha seems pretty solid to me ...let me know what you think. Note, my Developer Forum is currently experiencing some problems, so probably best to discuss on John's main Puppy Forum.\n\nBarryK\n\nOh yes, the 'test' directory at ibiblio also has openoffice-2.2.0.sfs, which has enhancements that the new Pup makes use of. These are outlined earlier in this blog, but basically it is the support for desktop icons and scripts in /etc/init.d/ and /etc/profile.d/.\n\nSo, this is the ideal SFS module to test with the new Pup.\n\nLobster\n\nGood news (downloading now) I am confident (based on past experience) that I can transfer day to day testing and usage to this Alpha.\n\nI will be releasing a new Puppy presentation using Open Office, either today or tomorrow. Will include Alpha screen shot . . .\n\nI look forward to the stark grey background. I do rather like the neutrality of grey - it can like black and white be used in a variety of ways, and the glass icons in 2.15 were a popular use of grey . . . The Puppy 2.14 sparkle was also step in the right direction. Simple, small elegant.\n\nSummary of 2.16 \"Puppy Luv\"\n\nhttp://puppylinux.org/wikka/Puppy216\n\nHave a great adventure\n\nany pics welcome on wiki . . .\n\n:)\n\nLeon\n\nThis is the fastest Puppy I ever use. It works very well and I don't have any problem so far.\n\nThanks for fixing frugal install.\n\nPersonally, I like colors and will keep the old Puppy look and feel.\n\nLeon\n\nAnother good news! Gxine can play flv files, both video and sound.\n\nSage\n\nNo problems with d/l and booting. New issue with the MBR after full install - 'Yes' no longer functions! Neither did the separate MBR installer from the menu. This is a new feature, but will investigate whether it is a generalised problem.\n\nIt was told to us many moons ago by the ultimate PC guru, Paul Mullen, that the most rational and elegant background, as well as screensaver, is BLACK! Black means no pixels are lit - it prolongs screen life and reduces power. It also looks terrific due to the stark contrast with icons, etc. In the greener environment we should all be using black backgrounds!\n\ngdcrane\n\nSo far so good Barry -\n\nI did not have the problem with the bootloader you mentioned\n\nTested so far :- cfcard\n\nCopied initrd.gz, vmlinuz,pup_216.sfs,zdrv_216.xfx to usb and cfcard\n\nrenamed initrd to init216;vmlinuz to linuz216, copied pup_save.sfs to pup_save.216.sfs\n\nadded entry to syslinux.cfg\n\nbooted and took 216 option off menu\n\nThe system did its version upgrade - copied the icewm menu back - exit to prompt the xwin icewm\n\nopend bootmanager - it showed my 2 sfs files\n\nmyprefs.sfs and wine934.sfs\n\ntested TotalCommander (main wine app) worked perfectly\n\ntested seamonkey (wine version) worked perfectly\n\nso the bootmanager appears to have retained the configuration\n\ngeorge\n\nSage\n\nStrange MBR install phenomenon seems to be related to old exptl3 fragments remaining on HD. Guess BK's warnings about old .sfs files was the portent to troubles. Easiest way was to reformat the drive - problem disappeared.\n\nToday is world penguin day!\n\nBarryK\n\nTed Dog and John Doe, note, I didn't put the new kernel modules into the zdrv file. I will upload them separately soon -- it will just be a matter of install them then run 'depmod' for the system to recognise them.\n\ngdcrane\n\nokay have now tested on a USB\n\nand I get that incredibly annoying screen message about flushing - pls do not do anything..... which i simply ignore as i am not going stop what i am doing every 30 minutes.\n\nThat needs removing - or suppressin in my view.\n\nWhat exactly is the advantage of flushing and is there a way to be able to choose not to use it, or at the least suppress the message or change the timings\n\nmy system sees the cf card as a hard drive so I do not experience the same issues thank heavans\n\ngeorge\n\nPizzasgood\n\nThe reason it flushes is a compromise. It can't just access FLASH media like a normal harddrive because that would wear out the drive very fast. So instead it keeps everything you do in ram and saves it during shutdown. But that's bad for two reasons. For one, if the power dies, all your data is gone (even if you \"saved\" it, since it only saved to ram). For another, it eats your ram. So, to compromise Puppy will flush to disk every thirty minutes. That way stuff gets saved every so often and the ram gets freed up.\n\nA simple control panel could be handy though, where you could enable or disable the popup, and change the save-interval. Now that there's a Save icon it would be a little more safe to not flush at all, and just do it by hand every once in a while.\n\nPersonally though, I'd rather it defaults to the thirty minute flush.\n\nPizzasgood\n\nClarification: When I said \"even if you save it, since you're saving to ram\" I meant if you just hit the save button in Abiword or whatever. The save icon on the desktop that I referred to is different, that flushes it.\n\nI haven't actually used this alpha yet (I'm in class atm) so I don't know first hand how annoying the message might be. I also don't know if it would show up if you were, say, watching a full-screen movie or playing a full-screen game. Would it stay underneith, or come on top, or mess up the whole full-screen thing (think alt-tabbing out of a game in Win98)?\n\nI'll have to install this to my jumpdrive sometime and play.\n\nAlso, you can probably manually tweak the timeout by editing /usr/sbin/savepuppyd, or even disable it completely. Though the structure is probably different from what I remember.\n\nkirk\n\nI like the new Desktop icons. Very sharp, well, except the \"home\" icon. Might just be me, but this puppy seems faster, AUFS maybe? There is probably some good reason for the switch from MUT to PMount on the desktop, if not, MUT is a lot more easy to look at. Might just be that I'm use to looking at MUT though.\n\nPROBLEM:\n\nTried to connect to a WPA wifi AP with the network wizard, no luck. Had to copy /etc/WAG from 2.14 to get it to work. That directory is missing in 2.16a.\n\ngdcrane\n\nhey pizza yeah i do understand that, which is why for some time I have kept link on my icewm taskbar that does exactly that - in fact I think it was a pup that you did that gave me that idea in the first plcae\n\nthat way i click on it when i want and not at some arbritrary , and inconvenient interval.\n\nI am not against automating the process, or even the icon on the desktop, just the fact that i have no choice in the matter.\n\nEven MS lets you choose to do this automatically or manually\n\nGeorge\n\ngdcrane\n\nFlush to usb\n\nOkay i think I see why it was so annoying - i was getting the pop-up every 5 minutes\n\nnow in my syslinux config file the option for the usb drive is shown as\n\nappend initrd=init216.gz PMEDIA=usbflash quiet\n\nso I modified a few of the lines in savepuppyd -\n\n#check PMEDIA is usbflash or ideflash...\n\nLOOPDELAY=6\n\nSLEEPTIME=900 #save every 90 minutes.\n\n#if not a flash media, can save more frequently...\n\n#[ \"`echo -n \"$PMEDIA\" | grep \"flash\"`\" = \"\" ] && SLEEPTIME=50 #save every 5 minutes.\n\nand now I can live with it\n\nGeorge\n\nJohn Doe\n\nI'm as excited as ever for this one, I'm just having two main problems:\n\nhttp://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewto\n\nAlso, drvc.so is missing from either gxine extra codecs or gxine. I get this error when I try to listen to my beloved c-span.org as rtsp stream.\n\nMooDog\n\nHi, Barry -\n\nSofar 2.16 has been running smoothly here, thanks!\n\nJust wanted to highlight here that Pmount needs a 'unmount' option so it will fully replace MUT's functions.\n\nBarryK\n\nMooDog, what do you mean? Pmount does have unmount.\n\nGdcrane, I don't understand. For pmedia=usbflash or ideflash, that code in savepuppyd will cause saving every 30 minutes. The variable PMEDIA has the string 'flash' in it, so the condition is not satisfied and the SLEEPTIME is not changed to 50.\n\ngdcrane\n\nyou are right Barry - it didnt do what I had thought and i am still getting the popup every 5 minutes on the lenovo. - I tried 216 out on a different machine - and I get the desktop icon and the initial warning about do not remove your usb drive, and the popup did not appear every 5 minutes\n\nSame usb drive, same syslinux config,\n\nSo now I am really puzzled - bottom line though is that on the lenovo intelligent terminal I get an annoying orange popup every 5 mins when I run off of a usb drive.\n\nnot sure what to try next - apart froom that its working like a champ - you do good work Barry\n\nGeorge\n\nMooDog\n\nOops - sorry!\n\nI didn't realise that if you click the mounted partition icon it will unmount! I was looking for an 'unmount' icon next to the drive, I guess..\n\nThanks for clearing that up!\n\nKJ\n\nHow about a 'manual save only' option? Not justfor flash drives but hard drives as well. Often I use my system to surf the web and would prefer that nothing be saved for the whole session so a 'manual save only' option would be perfect ... if I want to save something I can ...but I don't need to why do it.. I would welcome this option for my use in general ... not just for flash driver but for hard drives as well. One of the things I really liked about the old Flonix live CD distro. Please add this capability.\n\nPizzasgood\n\nThat would be nice, now that it can truly flush and not eat the ram. One \"hacky\" way you might be able to do it now is if you trick Puppy into thinking you have a flash drive by setting pmedia=ideflash, or pmedia=usbflash if you have a sata drive. I'm not certain that will still boot and function correctly, but I think it will.\n\ngdcrane\n\npizza\n\nthat sort of work around when i try it gets some real funky results\n\nI echo KJs senttiments which is which i liked the savepuppy pup you did\n\ngeorge\n\nalphasurfer\n\nExcellent work barry! I love this release and is working great as far as I can tell.... Thanks...\n\nddomains\n\n216a is GREAT! I tried and tried to get 215ce installed on my old Thnkpad Laptop and it would not work. First time with 216a and it all works even auto loaded the pcimcia lan card with the wizard.\n\nI also love the New Icons and simple look, grey is awsome.\n\nAm off to DL the OpenOffice and see how it runs ;)\n\nPaulBx1\n\nOn that USB flash save, how about doing it the old Puppy way, copy instead of flush - most of the time? Only annoy the user with the flush warning if ram is getting low and a flush really is needed? Just a thought...\n\nOn the issue of deleting old SFS files, can that be made more idiot-proof? For example, with the boot script checking dates or md5sums or something like that, to determine that the sfs in question is an old one that ought not be used?\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nI notice recent discussion in the \"Off topic\" area of the Puppy Forum that there is some on-going dispute between some Puppy-users. The origin appears to be the creation of a domain name 'puppylinux-foundation.com' that others considered conflicted with prior claim to use of the proposed \"Puppy Linux Foundation\", the latter intended to become a legal entity.\n\nYes, the term \"Puppy Linux Foundation\" does have a prior claim in terms of its longer history. Several months ago I did make a statement to this effect, and I thought that the 'puppylinux-foundation.com' name was being deliberately confrontational -- and I suggested they might make peace by using a different domain name.\n\nApart from the brief comment, I stepped back and was not involved. After all, I'm doing this as a hobby, for fun. I'm simply not interested in the politics, nor empire-building. It's just fun, that is the spirit, or should be the spirit, of this project.\n\nAnyway, time has rolled on, and from recent posts it seems that the conflict still simmers, unresolved.\n\nPersonally, I have a problem with the level of \"noise\" that I have to deal with everyday -- the number of emails, personal messages from the forums, plus the forums themselves. I can quite easily spend a couple of hours reading forum posts, which really eats into the day's productive hours. Also, as I will be travelling a lot in the future, I will have less regular Internet access. So, I will be stepping back a lot from day-to-day involvement/interaction and just focus on my hobby. Probably even this Blog will go back to a static News page like it used to be.\n\nAnd the politics? Well, I'm just not interested. I'm working on upgrading some of my pages, also creating a new master-link page to all the Puppy websites, and I'm inclined to include 'puppylinux-foundation.com' in that list, with the understanding that it does not diminish the other parties prior claim to creating and using the 'Puppy Linux Foundation' name. If anyone wans to comment with a compelling reason why I should not do this, please do, but any comment posted here that is inflamatory will get deleted.\n\nChris\n\n\"I stepped back and was not involved.\n\nAfter all, I'm doing this as a hobby, for fun.\n\nI'm simply not interested in the politics, nor empire-building.\n\nIt's just fun, that is the spirit, or should be the spirit,\n\nof this project.\"\n\nNothing to add to that statement.\n\nThanks for putting the fun back into OS.\n\nChris\n\nmetre9dmt\n\nI chose Puppy Linux because it works, everybody wants to make it a successful as other distribution, and, yes, it is fun to use. I hope and pray that we, members/users/programmers of the Puppy Linux community, should always follow the tenets set by Barry. Puppy Linux is still evolving, everyone should be focusing on improving it rather than on politics. 8-)\n\nEric (caneri)\n\nPolitics is a waste of everyones time...other than for politicans of course..Barry...I will continue with my project for web space/bandwidth for puppy....and if successful,as far as I'm concerned is for anyone that needs space for constructive uses for the pup or open source projects of any flavour. As I will not be admin for this it's up to you and Lobster or people of your choice. Somehow Puppy has become my hobby also...It's a good thing this puppy...kind of fun you see..thanks for the pup\n\nEric\n\nMarco\n\n\"After all, I'm doing this as a hobby, for fun.\n\nI'm simply not interested in the politics, nor empire-building.\n\nIt's just fun, that is the spirit, or should be the spirit,\n\nof this project.\"\n\nStick to it, Barry, life is too short to get involved into politics and power play\n\nshankargopal\n\nWell, I for one would be very sad if Barry felt like he had to 'step back' if that were to mean less involvement with Puppy. I use Puppy for everything and read this blog practically every day. If Barry were to withdraw from the kind of intense great work he has been doing, I would (no offense or criticism to the other great Puppians out there) feel almost bereaved :).\n\nBarry, you're great and Puppy is, at least for my purposes, by far the best distro in existence. I hope these minor disputes don't get too irritating.\n\nPizzasgood\n\nHe means he'll spend less time playing with the forum and more time actually working on Puppy. I don't blame him. The thing gradually eats your time until you spend more time keeping up with it than being productive.\n\nDougal\n\n\"I can quite easily spend a couple of hours reading forum posts, which really eats into the day's productive hours.\"\n\nThat's why I think it's a bad idea for you to point people from your forum to the Murga forum.\n\nI go to the forum to help solve bugs, but I don't have time to sift through al the junk on the Murga forum, so I just end up hardly ever going there -- and the users who need help lose out.\n\nYour forum is very quiet and so it's possible to visit it every day and do things there (there's no way I would have managed to pin down the elspci bug on the Murga forum -- there's would have been too many irrelevant coments that would have driven the thread off course).\n\nklhrevolutionist\n\nBarry I retitled the off-topic post I made recently. I do hope that the new title puts a different light on what I was trying to express. You announced on your blog that you will be stepping back & this is why a foundation is needed, some of think so...\n\n:)\n\nJT\n\nDougal: \"I think it's a bad idea for you to point people from your forum to the Murga forum.\"\n\nYes, I realized just now which forum should work better for my technical enquiries. I hope other devs realize that this forum exists:\n\nhttp://puppylinux.com/forum/\n\nRaffy\n\nBarry, I guess it is alright to include in your list any Puppy Linux-oriented site with clearly identified person/s owning and responsible for it, especially the site admin.\n\nDevildog\n\nBarry, thank you for your time and extraordinary efforts in providing this community with Puppy Linux. I appreciate you and this one of a kind Linux distribution. It is very exciting to experience how this wonderful distribution evolves, each time a new version is released. Even though I am fairly new to Linux and have very little knowledge in computer science, I greatly enjoy reading the Puppy Developer News.\n\nThank you again, Puppy Linux is truly amazing.\n\namish\n\nsorry, i know this isn't a popular view, but you cannot separate politics from free software no matter how preferable it might be.\n\nfree software\n\n- politics\n\n_________________\n\nnonfree software. it may take a while for some to realize it, but it's just the way it is. frankly, i'd rather just use puppy and be happy. being realistic does not always allow. politics made it possible for barry to use linux almost any way he wanted- another thing that is not possible is separating linux from free (as in libre) software, you need bsd for that. politics are inevitable. i hope this was not too inflammatory.\n\nLobster\n\n\"It's just fun, that is the spirit, or should be the spirit, of this project.\"\n\nAre we having fun yet? Less FUD and more fun please. Maybe a free joke with every 'serious' posting?\n\nI will go and stand quietely in the corner . . .\n\nJ_Rey\n\nGood to hear. I thought it was wise to leave us to settle our own problems amongst ourselves. I'm not sure if this has been settled yet but lets continue to move on.... If its not one thing its another, so if a group or person is showing themselves to be more helpful then hurtful, then I give them as many second chances as needed [i]if[/i] progress is being made.\n\nNow as far as reverting this blog to a static news page, please don't completely. Just disabling the comments should be enough? RSS feeds and anchor links were much needed with the old news pages.\n\nNathan F\n\nYes, I would second what J_Rey said about the blog. I think it really helps to be able to search through posts, open specific anchors, get things in a feed, etc. The static page just gets to be too long to go back and find information. If it's because the blog is acting up then there are alternatives available, with or without a database. But my guess would be any problems you experience are more than likely related to the host rather than the software, so solving them might be tricky.\n\nJohnRoberts\n\nBarry, you are 10000% right...\n\n...and a hint about the future...I was wondering about the hardware dilemma...Trying to support newer and newer hardware in Puppy (and Linux, in general) vs. full compatibility with legacy hardware...In light of the makers' plans to embed DRM into the hardware, effectively locking the software to their wishes (and holding all of us by the 2#$!!...), I am inclined to say \"NO THANKS\" and consider sticking with legacy as long as it will be able to switch-on...\n\nRaffy\n\nMaybe Wordpress can help - it is a blog, and now it has an accompanying forum. Its spam filtering works well. It has been working well in the different occasions that I tried it since 2005.\n\nHi.\n\nI've been dealing with operating systems since 1970 as a systems programmer. In that nearly 40 years, I have never had so much fun as I have with puppy. Well not quite true, in the beginning I did have fun because things were really exciting back then (in the mainframe world).\n\nI hopped from disro to distro, accidentally landed on a comment regarding puppy so I tried it and thats it. In fact I demo'd it to a few friends, collegues, etc and there are probably half a dozen more puppy users now. All happy, all not bugging me with \"how do I\"? I like the spirit... Keep it fun. Its a lot more productive that way.\n\nThanx\n\nGlenn\n\nRichard.a\n\nBarry,\n\nI applaud your approach to this. As a fellow Australian I admire the way you can cut through all the \"stuff\" and do what you are very good at.\n\nMe, well I'm not the slightest bit interested in politics, whether it's parliamentary, or council chambers, or scout group, or church, corporate, charities and their associated \"foundations\", whatever... and I've been unavoidably involved in the political ramifications in many of these areas unfortunately...\n\nI've been around the *nix traps for quite a number of years as a user looking for stuff that works reliably and securely, and which can be lawfully shared with friends, acquaintances, associates, whoever.\n\nThat's why after trying a raft of other systems, I've really settled on just two; PuppyLinux and PC-BSD, both of which are genuine non-commercial projects, even though PC-BSD now has a commercial sponsor.\n\nI think pizzasgood is right over what he sees Barry's direction as being, as opposed to the genuine \"shock, horror\" of his heading off or something.\n\nKeep it up fellows. I'm too long in the tooth to learn anything about writing code these days, but for what it's worth I've spent half my lifetime looking at system ergonomics from a user point of view while designing electro-mechanical operations (production lines, etc) and their systems. If I can help with a frequently critical eye, please allow me to help :)\n\nRichard in Adelaide\n\nThe Ozzie clever capital\n\nOzzie is the clever country, after all, if you can believe retired politicians :)\n\nIt appears that some kind of political manoeuvering begins as soon as more than one people get interested in the same thing. It's in human nature, I fear.\n\nIn primary school we learned a tale about a dispute, the judge saying \"That's right\" to both disputant's views. The judge's child then said \"How can they both be right, dad?\", and the judge had to admit \"You're right, too...\".\n\nBarry's way is Puppy's life, it's the spirit that conquered many Puppy fans like me. But of course there are other viewpoints, not necessarily wrong.\n\nWell, if Puppy is as good as I think, it will easily survive even politics. Thank you Barry!\n\n______________________\n\nWhen you feel very smart, get concerned: it's the distinctive symptom of all victims of stupidity.\n\nrarsa\n\nBravo!\n\nI hope your statements in this blog post clarify things for people from every side about what puppy means for you.\n\nIt was clear to me.\n\nOne comment on your participation in the forums:\n\nI agree they are too time consuming but for now it is the only medium for the user to log bug reports, contribute bug fixes and ofer ideas. To me those kind of posts have always been helpful and for what I've seen, they've been helpful to you too.\n\nThe problem is that those helpful posts are burried under many more that are rants, requests for help, off topic, etc. The risk under the current format is that if you want to get to the helpful ones you must read or at least scan many others. For my limited time for example, I used to spend more time in the forum than producing contributions.\n\nMy recomendation to reduce the noise to signal ratio is to use a purpose specific tool such as bugzilla, that way the recommendations can be discussed and argued in the forum by the interested parties and once there is a solid recommendation it goes there.\n\nI know that it requires someone to volunteer to be the gatekeeper but I think it is no different than the very helpfull people that are maintaining the community Forum.\n\nWe already have a couple that have been offered, it's just a matter of start using them.\n\nBonn\n\nDon't forget that many times the word \"merit\" and \"contribution\" are written in the Murga forum. So it is through hard contributions that people should assert themselves, not simply \"politics\". MU has a expression for it, \"earn your stripes\".\n\nBarry shows us that way of life (of endless labours) everyday through this blog. How could a some regulars miss this point?\n\nMark South\n\nBarry, I sypathise with your view that politics are a pain. Most of us prefer doing development or testing or fun stuff instead of bothering with politics.\n\nHowever, several points to note:\n\n1. The Murga forum has become heavily politicised through some of the moderators (John Murga included) adopting a heavy-handed approach, like deleting posts that make different technical or design recommendations. I don't have a solution to that, but until that situation changes that forum will remain a politicised arena.\n\n2. There would be more focus on the development of Puppy by many people if they could be assured that they are not contributing to a proprietary project. The lingering ill-feeling between the various entities calling themselves \"foundation\" appears to arise from that concern.\n\n3. You have expressed, in previous developer blog or forum postings, an intention to re-license the proprietary core of Puppy using a GPL or LGPL type licence. Nevertheless, up to the present it appears that key elements of Puppy remain proprietary to you.\n\n4. It seems to me that explicitly free-licensing all of Puppy would be a tremendous step towards reducing the political concerns of all the participants in the various Puppy forums, as well as opening the door to numerous other developers. You can take this step unilaterally, and I would appeal to you to do so. To put my money where my mouth is, I would be willing to help with emplacing the licences in the code and reviewing the overall licence structure with you.\n\nThanks for reading this far.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nMark\n\nPS For clarification, I have no connection to any of the various competing foundations, or to any commercial entity that involves Puppy.\n\nDougal\n\nRE Mark's post:\n\nI don't think more people would help develop Puppy if it's licence were changed -- most people don't know (or care) exactly what licence Puppy has. The people who want to help, help, the people who are lazy, don't.\n\nAs for the Murga forum, I don't think Murga has any \"political\" agenda, just idiots for moderators -- thus we end up in a state where the person who gets banned from the forum is one of about ten people on the forum who actually know anything about Linux, while all the babblers are left to continue flooding the forum with pointless messages...\n\nMark South\n\nRE Dougal's post:\n\nI strongly resemble the remark in your second paragraph Notice that I was banned for asking people to reply to my posts if they saw them, so that the moderators would not be able to remove them so easily.\n\nJust to clarify, by \"politics\" I don't mean that it's a case of democrat vs republican, just that there is a lot of discussion about people feeling excluded or their opinions ignored.\n\nAs for your first paragraph. Personally, I would like to contribute stuff to Puppy. I would also like to be able to make and distribute a system based on Puppy. But with Puppy remaining proprietary that seems a shaky proposition, legally speaking. Even if Barry is cool with it at present. My email discussions with several others in the Puppy community show me that I am not alone in this perception.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I am not a lwayer, but I have participated in contract negotiations for, and with, several IT companies. Legal exposure is no fun to live with at all.\n\nDougal\n\nI forgot to add in my last post that in 2.14 Barry has actualy added \"LGPL\" at the top of various scripts -- that might help clarify where Puppy stands regarding licencing.\n\nI don't care about it much since it's obvious that Barry is a good bloke and you can probably do whatever you like with Puppy and he wouldn't say anything -- the idea of the copyright is for protection from the evil corporate world...\n\nSomething I've noticed in most forums is when there is an \"excommunication\", nobody is prepared to talk about what, why, where, how, who, etc.\n\nI use the term \"excommunication\" quite deliberately, because there often seems little intrinsic difference between the management of forums and the management of religious cults - of which I had the misfortune to belong on one occasion, for 20 years, the last 8 of which being \"in absentia\" - because they didn't wish to know me.\n\nI'm familiar with the concerns that people (in both) express about \"outsiders\" - but you know, the world is full of outsiders. Some of them actually know a darned sight more than I do, amazingly <grin> :)\n\nSo that's where you disappeared to, Mark!\n\nI had wondered. And now, being in my 70's, I wasn't game to voice any questions, it's all too hard mate, at my age lol.\n\nSo sad when those who have something to contribute, can't, for a raft of reasons.\n\nLeave it there, or it'll become political.\n\nMark and Dougal, I was very interested in your quasi-legal comments.\n\nI was considering creating a distro based on 2.16ce and sharing it around the traps, if I can perfect the customisation and burn.\n\nMaybe I should reconsider.\n\nI too am not a lawyer.\n\n[b]But I've seen enough of bad stuff in probate cases I've been told about, to be highly concerned that anything I expressed as a \"wish\" does not have to be adhered to when I'm gone, by those who administer my estate[/b].\n\nI think I need to be wary in what I was thinking of doing.\n\nRichard in Adelaide.\n\nRichard.a\n\nummm by 2.16ce I meant 2.15ce - unlike forums, there doesn't appear to be an ability to edit your post.\n\nWhich is why my forum signature always says...\n\n[i]Have you noticed editing is always needed for the inevitable typos that weren't there when you hit the \"post\" button? [/i]\n\n<grin>\n\nMark South\n\nRichard: thanks for your kind comments, they are appreciated. And while I am not a lwayer (I doubt anyone is), neither am I a lawyer\n\nDougal and Richard: to contrast your last points. Yes, Dougal, Barry IS a good bloke. That's why he shares Puppy with everyone. And no one else has the right to demand of Barry that he do any specific thing with his creation. But surely we can reasonably make our request to a decent bloke and reasonably expect a decent reply.\n\nRichard has summarised the main issue, which is the question of whether Barry's legal representatives will also always be good blokes. What if Barry falls ill, or gets bored, or receives an offer he can't refuse for the rights to Puppy? What happens then to the effort that everyone else has put into the distro? As long as Puppy remains proprietary, that's a concrete risk. Barry could completely remove those concerns by making everything explicitly GPL, or by clarifying that his own scripts remain proprietary. (Note that, according to the FSF, notes on web pages do not count, the licences have to be embedded in the code they refer to.)\n\nEveryone prefers to avoid legal issues. Sometimes avoiding large legal issues in the long term means facing up to smaller issues in the present.\n\nEveryone prefers to avoid politics. Sadly, those who are left out of the discussion process have no choice but to concern themselves with facing up to issues of politics.\n\nAPPEAL TO BARRY:\n\nI reiterate my appeal to Barry, as the decent bloke that he obviously is, to end once and for all, and in no uncertain terms, the lack of clarity regarding the licencing of Puppy and the code it contains.\n\nAll best wishes,\n\nMark\n\nBarryK\n\nEr, I thought that the licencing [i]was[/i] settled, some time ago. Puppy does not have a proprietary licence. The only thing I have claim to are the names and logos, whch is quite normal for an open source project. Even Linus has copyrighted \"Linux\".\n\nThere are scripts that had \"Copyright (c) Barry Kauler\" on them, but I have been changing them to \"LGPL\". But, the above statement has been made before, so this issue should be dead by now.\n\nThe FAQ was changed sometme ago to be clear that there is nothing proprietary.\n\nI'll make a sweep through my scripts right now, make sure the LGPL is on all of them, before the next 2.16alpha.\n\nThen, could we please put this 'proprietary' nonsense to bed?\n\nBarryK\n\nOkay, I've gone through all the scripts, made sure that a LGPL licence is at the top of them.\n\nMark South\n\nRegarding placing the Puppy scripts under the LGPL:\n\nBarry, this is tremendously good news. It may have seemed like an annoying chore at the time (actually, I'm _sure_ it did) but by doing so you have ensured the future health and long life of your creation. This is an even greater contribution to Puppy than any individual piece of code.\n\nPlease note though, that you do not have to remove your own copyright to place the code under the LGPL. In fact, the LGPL is the mechanism by which your copyright is protected in perpetuity.\n\nTrademarks, it is understood, are in a different class from licences, and no one would suggest that you should give up the trademark Puppy Linux (and PuppyOS too?). My personal recommendation (but I am still not a lawyer/lwayer) would be that you keep that tightly under control.\n\nFinally, I'm sure that the rest of your readership will join me in thanking you, and raising their tinnies with a proud chorus of \"Good on you, Barry!\"\n\nCheers!\n\nMark"
