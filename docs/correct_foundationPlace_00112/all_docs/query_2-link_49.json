The Foundation has taught us how to evaluate charities, in addition, to helping us find new organizations we are considering for support. As donors, the Foundation gives you a feeling of comfort when making your contributions. It’s an excellent vehicle and unique organizational resource.”\n\n— Adela and Pete Peterson\n\nThe growth of our endowment... has been the result of our association with RSFF\n\n“Buena Vista Audubon Society chose RSFF to be the primary home for its Nature Center Endowment Fund after considering a number of options. We found that many of the staff, board members, and advisors associated with RSFF were already familiar faces, people who had earned our respect and confidence over the years as active members of our community. The success of our fundraising efforts and the growth of our endowment, in no small measure, has been the result of our association with RSFF.”\n\n— Andrew Mauro, Director of Buena Vista Audubon Society\n\nEverything we needed without the cost & hassle\n\n“We were so close to establishing our own family foundation before realizing that a donor advised fund would provide everything we needed without the cost, hassle and reporting requirements. The RSF Foundation set up our Donor Advised Fund and the rest is history. We now only suggest where our donations are to be sent and the Foundation completes the transaction. Thank you RSF Foundation!”\n\n— Judy and Don Oliphant"
