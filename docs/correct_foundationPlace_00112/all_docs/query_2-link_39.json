        "text": "We believe business should be a force for good and philanthropy can be a powerful vehicle for change. Since 1952, the Levi Strauss Foundation has been a driving force behind Levi Strauss & Co.’s profits through principles approach to business. Today, we put the company’s values — originality, empathy, integrity and courage — into action to advance the human rights and well-being of underserved people where the company has a business presence.\n\nOver the years, the Levi Strauss Foundation has invested $378 million in pioneering organizations and leaders working on the frontlines of change on the issues and events of our time.\n\nToday, the foundation invests in the areas of reproductive justice, worker rights and well-being, immigrant rights and democracy. Woven through our work is a longstanding commitment to racial and gender justice. Last year, nearly all of our funds supported efforts around the globe that advanced women’s rights.\n\nWe also believe that communities most impacted by the issues they face are best positioned to lead, provide solutions and take action. That’s why most of our funds in the U.S. supported organizations led by Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC).\n\nWe are proud to stand alongside our community partners and look forward to learning from them as we continue to work together for equity and justice."
