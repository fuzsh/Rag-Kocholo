She has contributed to research on a wide array of computer-systems topics, including compilers, program analysis, operating systems, security, computer architecture, and high-performance computing. Her recent research focus is to make computing and programming easier. In the Collective Project, she and her research group developed the concept of a livePC: subscribers to the livePC will automatically run the latest of the published PC virtual images with each reboot. That approach allows computers to be managed scalably and securely. In 2005, the group started a company called moka5 to transfer the technology to industry. In another research project, her program-analysis group has developed a collection of tools for improving software security and reliability. They developed the first scalable context-sensitive inclusion-based pointer analysis and a freely available tool called BDDBDDB that allows programmers to express context-sensitive analyses simply by writing Datalog queries. Other tools developed include Griffin, static and dynamic analysis for finding security vulnerabilities in Web applications, such as SQL injection; a static and dynamic program query language called PQL; a static memory-leak detector called Clouseau; a dynamic buffer-overrun detector called CRED; and a dynamic error-diagnosis tool called DIDUCE. Previously, Dr. Lam led the Stanford University Intermediate Format Compiler project, which produced a widely used compiler infrastructure known for its locality optimizations and interprocedural parallelization. Many of the compiler techniques that she developed have been adopted by industry. Her other research projects included the architecture and compiler for the CMU Warp machine, a systolic array of very-long-instruction-word processors, and the Stanford DASH distributed shared-memory machine. In 1998, she took a sabbatical leave from Stanford University to help to start Tensilica Inc., a company that specializes in configurable processor cores. She received a BSc from the University of British Columbia in 1980 and a PhD in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1987.\n\nKathryn S. McKinley is a professor at the University of Texas at Austin. Her research interests include compilers, runtime systems, and architecture. Her research seeks to enable high-level programming languages to achieve high performance, reliability, and availability. She and her collaborators have developed compiler optimizations for improving memory-system performance, high-performance garbage-collection algorithms, scalable explicit-memory management algorithms for parallel systems, and cooperative dynamic optimizations for improving the performance of managed languages. She is leading the compiler effort for the TRIPS project, which is exploring attaining scalable performance improvements using explicit dataflow graph execution architectures. Her honors include being named an Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Distinguished Scientist and receiving a National Science Foundation Career Award. She is the co-editor-in-chief of ACM’s Transactions on Programming Language and Systems (TOPLAS). She is active in increasing minority-group participation in computer science and, for example, co-led with Daniel Jimenez the CRAW/CDC Programming Languages Summer School in 2007. She has published over 75 refereed articles and has supervised eight PhD degrees. Dr. McKinley holds a BA (1985) in electrical engineering and computer science and an MS (1990) and a PhD (1992) in computer science, all from Rice University.\n\nCharles Moore is an Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) corporate fellow and the CTO for AMD’s Technology Group. He is the chief engineer of AMD’s next-generation processor design. His responsibilities include interacting with key customers to understand their requirements, identifying important technology trends that may affect future designs, and architectural development and management of the next-generation design. Before joining AMD, Mr. Moore was a senior industrial research fellow at the University of Texas at Austin, where he did research on technology-scalable computer architecture. Before then, he was a distinguished engineer at IBM, where he was the chief engineer on the POWER4 project. Earlier, he was the coleader of the first single-chip POWER architecture implementation and the coleader of the first PowerPC implementation used by Apple Computer in its PowerMac line of personal computers. While at IBM, he was elected to the IBM Academy of Technology and was named an IBM master inventor. He has been granted 29 US patents and has several others pending. He has published numerous conference papers and articles on a wide array of subjects related to computer architecture and design. He is on the editorial board of IEEE Micro magazine and on the program committee for several important industry conferences. Mr. Moore holds a master’s degree in electrical engineering from the University of Texas at\n\nAustin and a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the Rens-selaer Polytechnic Institute.\n\nKatherine Yelick is a professor in the Computer Science Division of the University of California, Berkeley. The main goal of her research is to develop techniques for obtaining high performance on a wide array of computational platforms and to ease the programming effort required to obtain performance. Dr. Yelick is perhaps best known for her efforts in global address space (GAS) languages, which attempt to present the programmer with a shared-memory model for parallel programming. Those efforts have led to the design of Unified Parallel C (UPC), which merged some of the ideas of three shared-address-space dialects of C: Split-C, AC (from IDA), and PCP (from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory). In recent years, UPC has gained recognition as an alternative to message-passing programming for large-scale machines. Compaq, Sun, Cray, HP, and SGI are implementing UPC, and she is currently leading a large effort at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to implement UPC on Linux clusters and IBM machines and to develop new optimizations. The language provides a uniform programming model for both shared and distributed memory hardware. She has also worked on other global-address-space languages, such as Titanium, which is based on Java. She has done notable work on single-processor optimizations, including techniques for automatically optimizing sparse matrix algorithms for memory hierarchies. Another field that she has worked in is architectures for memory-intensive applications and in particular the use of mixed logic, which avoids the off-chip accesses to DRAM, thereby gaining bandwidth while lowering latency and energy consumption. In the IRAM project, a joint effort with David Patterson, she developed an architecture to take advantage of this technology. The IRAM processor is a single-chip system designed for low power and high performance in multimedia applications and achieves an estimated 6.4 gigaops per second in a 2-W design. Dr. Yelick received her bachelor’s degree (1985), master’s degree (1985), and PhD (1991) in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nSTAFF\n\nLynette I.
