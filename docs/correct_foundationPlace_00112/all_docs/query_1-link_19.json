        "text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif., March 12, 2009 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX News Network/ -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGN), today announced that it has appointed Sheila Tan as vice president of marketing and chief marketing officer, effective immediately. Ms. Tan will report directly to Align President and Chief Executive Officer, Thomas M. Prescott.\n\n\"Sheila joined the Company in September 2008 as vice president of product innovation and marketing strategy and I'm pleased that she is taking on additional responsibility to lead our overall marketing organization,\" said Thomas M. Prescott, Align president and CEO. \"Sheila's experience in consumer, oral care, and technology marketing will be of tremendous value to Align as we continue to execute our strategy to drive adoption of Invisalign.\"\n\nMs. Tan has over 16 years of experience creating brands, products, and marketing strategies in the consumer products, software, and Internet service industries. Her foundation in marketing comes from Procter & Gamble and Intuit, where she lead the development of new product concepts, launched new businesses, and managed the core marketing functions for Crest, Quicken.com, and QuickBooks.\n\nMore recently, Ms. Tan served as vice president, marketing for MokaFive, a leading provider of next generation desktop virtualization, targeting SMBs and enterprise IT. Prior to MokaFive, Ms. Tan was vice president, marketing at Presto Services, a unique digital-delivery service that enables families and friends to stay in touch via email, without the need for a computer or Internet connection.\n\nMs. Tan received her undergraduate degree in business from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo and her MBA from UCLA.\n\nAbout Align Technology, Inc.\n\nAlign Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998. Today, the Invisalign product family includes Invisalign, Invisalign Teen, Invisalign Assist, Invisalign Express, and Vivera Retainers.\n\nTo learn more about Invisalign or to find a certified Invisalign doctor in your area, please visit www.invisalign.com or call 1-800-INVISIBLE.\n\nInvestor Relations Contact Press Contact Shirley Stacy Shannon Mangum Henderson Align Technology, Inc.
