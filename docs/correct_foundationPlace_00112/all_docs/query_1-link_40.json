A former Christian high school would be renovated for the new facility.\n\n\"As we work to provide the very best programs for children, teens and adults, I'm so pleased to be part of an effort that brings such joy to our athletes and their families,\" Juliet Dragos said. \"When we open, we know that demand is going to surge, as many families get involved with Special Olympics for the first time.\"\n\nThe 127,000 square-foot facility would sit on a 17-acre campus with new sports fields, programming space, administrative offices, educational space and wellness space for Special Olympians and partners.\n\nThe facility would also lease to other agencies, such as Brody's Be Cafe, which was inspired by a boy with Down syndrome; Autism Support of Kent County, Disability Advocates of Kent County; Down Syndrome Association of West Michigan; Mental Health Foundation of West Michigan; MOKA, a group that helps people with developmental disabilities; and Thresholds, a social-services agency to help those with developmental disabilities.\n\nThe Building Tomorrow's Champions campaign was rolled out to the public Thursday, June 24, 2021. The fundraising campaign is a multi-million dollar fundraising event to create the facility. The campaign was launched in 2020 and has raised more than $6.7 million. The Special Olympics Michigan is looking to raise $20 million.\n\n\"This is an exceptional opportunity for the community to show our support for those with unique challenges,\" Dragos said. \"With your help, we know that those with disabilities in our community will thrive.\"\n\nhas been providing year-round sports training and athletic competition for children and adults with intellectual disabilities since 1968.\n\nThe announcement is expected to begin around 2 p.m. June 24."
