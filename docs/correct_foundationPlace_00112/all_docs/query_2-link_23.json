        "text": "Martell's life had been stuck in a seemingly endless cycle of regret and disappointment. His criminal background had cast a long shadow over his aspirations and opportunities, making it nearly impossible to maintain a steady job and provide financially for his family. He was all too familiar with the adverse consequences a criminal record could bring, having lost an ideal job in the past due to this very reason.\n\nIn the midst of this seemingly insurmountable challenge, Martell discovered a ray of hope in the form of the Leap program. This initiative offered him the chance to acquire new skills through training, opening doors to a better future in his career. The most remarkable aspect of the Leap program was its commitment to placing individuals like Martell with companies that were willing to look beyond their criminal backgrounds and offer them a second chance.\n\nMartell eagerly enrolled in an OSHA Construction and trucking program through the Leap program. This step provided him with the essential tools and opportunities needed to forge a successful and lasting career in a field that welcomed him with open arms. As he embarked on this journey, he soon discovered a sense of happiness and accomplishment that had eluded him for much of his life.\n\nThe Leap program became the turning point in Martell's life, allowing him to shatter the barriers imposed by his criminal history. It gave him the chance to not only better himself but also to provide a brighter future for his family, breaking free from the cycle of disappointment that had plagued him for years.\n\nSeven years ago, Marquita was a working mother of three happy children, living in her cozy home and owning a reliable car. Yet, behind this fa√ßade of normalcy, there was a darker secret that Marquita had been hiding from the world. She had developed an alcohol and weed habit that she believed was harmless. For a while, Marquita convinced herself that she had everything under control. After all, what harm could come from the occasional joint and a few drinks? As time passed, her after-work joint and drink transformed into an addiction to hard drugs. Her life spiraled out of control, and she found herself caught in the unforgiven grip of substance abuse. The once happy mother and homeowner had become a shadow of her former self now homeless and without her children.\n\nGuided by the wisdom of God, her daughter offered Marquita a lifeline, but it came with conditions. She could live with her daughter for thirty days, but she needed to be drug during that time, Marquita accepted. In the midst of a challenging first week, Marquita realized it was time for her to change. She knew that she needed more than sheer determination she needed a structured program that would provide her with the support and discipline required for her recovery. Marquita and her daughter attended church and it was there that a compassionate church member shared a life-changing piece of information with them. They learned about an organization called Time for Change Foundation (TFCF). Marquita wasted no time and called their office immediately, eager to explore the possibilities of healing and transformation. Initially, Marquita was disappointed to learn that there were no available beds at TFCF, However, she refused to give up hope. Miraculously, the very next day, a bed become available and Marquita seized the opportunity. She moved into TFCF without hesitation, determined to break free from the chains of her addiction and rebuilt her life.\n\nMarquita's journey to recovery was far from easy, but she credits a significant portion of her success to the wrap-around services provided by TFCF. In particular, the Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) outpatient classes and the Workforce Development programs played a crucial role in helping her regain her footing. She now is gainfully employed, has her own apartment and has her children back in her life! Her journey from addiction to recovery is a shining example of how, with the right guidance and determination, even the darkest moments can lead to a brighter future.\n\nWhat happened? That was my constant thought as I sat in prison realizing that I had let my 2 kids down again. I had a vision in my mind of being a caring and nurturing parent because I didn‚Äôt have that. As far as I can remember, domestic violence was inherited from my grandmother, passed down to my mother and dwelling within me. I was pretty much raised in the foster care system, and I wanted so much more for myself. Yet here I was endangering myself and my children with toxicity and unhealthy relationships. I lost myself.\n\nDuring my time in prison, I did a lot of personal growth and healing. Upon my release, I knew how I wanted my life to be and that I had to get my kids out of foster care. I found out about Time for Change Foundation‚Äôs (TFCF) Positive Futures II program, while in prison and quickly enrolled in the program upon release. I got a job just 4 days after my release but still needed assistance and guidance to reunify with my children. The hardest part was finding permanent housing for me and my kids. Although the program assisted with my basic needs and employment support, I still needed my Child Protective Services worker to approve my reunification.\n\nBoth TFCF staff and I searched feverishly to get me an apartment, but everything was filled up or had a waiting list. I was told to be patient, that God didn‚Äôt bring me this far to fail, but every visit with my children would leave me heartbroken because I couldn‚Äôt take them with me. Then it happened, an apartment became available on June 1st, and I received a wonderful fully furnished apartment where I could bring my kids home. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks already and my worker has approved my reunification to happen before the end of the month! I am truly grateful!\n\nOriginally from Chicago, Nadaja moved to California to live with relatives in hopes of building a new life with her son (16) and daughter (13). It wasn‚Äôt long before she realized the living situation was not healthy. Living in shelters and in her car became the norm as she struggled with seeing the disappointment in her children‚Äôs faces.\n\nAfter spending three months living in their car, showering in park bathrooms all while working a full-time job, she was at a standstill. Her daughter recalls feeling helpless during this time saying, ‚Äúas a teenager you can‚Äôt really do much financially to help, but I tried not to complain because I understood my mom was going through a hard time.‚Äù Nadaja came across a Facebook post for affordable housing. Although Nadaja wasn‚Äôt sure if she‚Äôd qualify because she had no rental history, she knew it wouldn't hurt to try. That‚Äôs when she met the staff at Time for Change Foundation and Ms. Dominique took her by the hand.\n\n‚ÄúThis blessing was so abundant and I thank God we‚Äôre inside for summer and that my kids have a place to call home. I was blessed with a beautiful fully furnished apartment and my kids in their own room. We Call it Home, Others Call it Hope. that sticks in my mind because I had some hope and made that call, we now have a home. I‚Äôm thankful and grateful for EVERYTHING!‚Äù\n\nBarry doesn‚Äôt remember much about the Watts LA Riot because he was so young, but what he does remember is the constant sounds of gun shots. Much is to be said about being a young black kid amid environmental suffocation, failing schools and lack of investment in the infrastructure of South Central. Like most families trying to desperately escape the mental anguish that accompanies extreme poverty, Barry joined the church where he sang in the youth choir. Church served as a sanctuary and a place where his family could find spiritual comradery.\n\nWrong place at the wrong time? This is another story of where the justice system fails to deliver for black men in America. Without any prior negativity or behavior issues at school or at home, Barry became a target for a crime he did not commit. Despite his innocence, he was shepherded through without proper legal defense and found himself sentenced to LIFE in prison. For the next 40 years he would remain vigilante about his story although many disbelieved. Thankfully, organizations like the ACLU, and the Innocence Project who continue to get black men released from prison because they were wrongfully convicted have supported people like Barry.\n\nIt was finally discovered Barry was falsely accused. Fighting for Barry until 1997, ACLU turned the case to the Federal Public Defender‚Äôs office in Los Angeles which resulted in a Federal Judge overturning the conviction in 2016. It took another 7 years for the injustice system to acknowledge his case and on May 10, 2023, Barry was freed after 4 decades. TFCF‚Äôs Brighter Futures welcomed Barry home on May 31, 2023, he now looks forward to his Brighter Future!"
