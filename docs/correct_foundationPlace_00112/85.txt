The UC Riverside Foundation is a nonprofit corporation through which philanthropic resources flow to the University of California, Riverside. Established in 1977, the foundation raises, records and manages gifts from individuals, corporations, organizations and foundations for the sole benefit of UCR in accordance with donors' wishes.

The growth of the foundation enables investment in the present and future of UCR's colleges, programs, research and students. Its success depends on the financial support of our dedicated and generous alumni, friends, parents and patrons who understand that the research and teaching taking place in UCR's classrooms and laboratories have the potential to change our world for the better.
