Possibilities. Made possible.

MOKA was founded around the vision that people with intellectual and developmental disabilities would be fully included in our communities. We see endless possibilities to empower people to build relationships, make life choices, increase confidence, and contribute back to the community.

The MOKA Foundation graciously accepts gifts in the form of monetary donations via our website and mailings to our physical offices. Your donations go directly towards the empowerment of persons served by sponsoring initiatives that support independence and growth in creativity, new experiences, and community integration. Gifting opportunities for experiences that would not be funded by traditional sources such as Medicaid.

Brighter Futures. Made possible by you.

You can make someoneâ€™s future brighter with the simple click of a button. Whether it is by providing a person the opportunity of inclusion in the community, supporting a person on their journey to employment, or helping someone with disabilities reach their full potential, your gift changes lives. Give the gift of a brighter future.
