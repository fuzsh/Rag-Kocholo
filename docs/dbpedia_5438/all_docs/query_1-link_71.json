        "text": "One word connects those two cities: Renaissance. A word that means rebirth of ancient Greek and Roman art, which was brought back to life and re-interpreted by the great masters of the 15th and 16th centuries: Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Donatello.\n\nIn Rome, you have some of the greatest masterpieces of the Renaissance: the Sistine Chapel frescoes and paintings and the Pietà by Michelangelo, the Rooms of Raphael in Vatican City, and many others; but it’s in Florence that the Renaissance was born.\n\nWe designed this Florence Day Trip so that you can take a day off from the Eternal City and go see the cradle of the Renaissance, then go back to Rome on the same day.\n\nFlorence is not very close to Rome, that’s why we believe that the best way of reaching it is by using the comfortable fast trains, which will allow you to get to Florence in only an hour and a half (a car ride would last at least 3 hours).\n\nIn this way, you can spend more time exploring the city, and have more time for sightseeing, eating, shopping, or tasting wine.\n\nA tour assistant will pick you up at the hotel; then, you’ll take a cab to the train station and you’ll go to Florence together by fast train.\n\nYour tour assistant will be with you for the whole day: he will provide information about the beautiful landscapes you’ll see on your way to Florence, and talk about Italian culture, food, and wine.\n\nHe’ll be there the whole time to help you and make sure you are enjoying every moment of your tour.\n\nAn expert local guide will wait for you at the Florence train station, where you’ll start your tour of the city center: you’ll visit Piazza della Signoria, the Duomo, and the Battistero (from outside), Ponte Vecchio, and many other famous sights.\n\nThe Duomo is the most important church in Florence.\n\nIt is an imposing gothic cathedral enriched by one of the greatest masterpieces of architecture: the dome by Brunelleschi.\n\nBrunelleschi is one of the most important architects in history. His studies about perspective and his love for classical art are among the basis of the Renaissance language. He was a brilliant artist, and the dome was his greatest accomplishment.\n\nYour guide will reveal its secrets, and tell you the story of its construction.\n\nIn Piazza Duomo, you will see many other remarkable sights, such as the Baptistery and the Bell Tower by Giotto.\n\nThen, your Florence Day Trip Tour will continue towards Piazza della Signoria.\n\nPiazza della Signoria (Signoria Square) was the political center of Florence.\n\nIt is also an open-air museum, surrounded by massive buildings and statues.\n\nIt is the best place to learn about the history of Florence, and about its intricate politic. Your guide will tell you the story of the Medici, the most influential family in Florence, and about their contribution to creating the city’s identity.\n\nIn the Renaissance, art was an expression of power.\n\nIn Florence, it was mostly the expression of the power of the Medici, who sponsored some of the most famous artworks in the city.\n\nYou will admire the impressive facade of Palazzo della Signoria, whose entrance is decorated by a replica of Michelangelo’s David and by the Hercules and Cacus by Baccio Bandinelli.\n\nNext to the square, you will see the Loggia dei Lanzi, a portico decorated with many important sculptures.\n\nAmong them, you will also see the impressive Perseus in bronze by Benvenuti Cellini.\n\nAfter Piazza della Signoria, your Florence Day Trip Tour will continue towards Ponte Vecchio, oldest bridge on the Arno river, which dates back to the Roman Age.\n\nAside from being a walkway across the river, it also hosts traditional jewelry stores and goldsmiths.\n\nAbove the stores, you can still see a corridor that connected the two main residences of Florence rulers (Palazzo della Signoria and Palazzo Pitti) so that they could go from one palace to another without walking among the crowds.\n\nIt is one of the most important parts of Florence’s landscapes and history, a must-see sight.\n\nAfter admiring the romantic Arno River, you will head towards the most famous museum in town: the Accademia, where Michelangelo’s David is kept.\n\nDon’t worry about the lines: we will have skip-the-line tickets!\n\nWhy is David such an important statue? Your guide will provide a full explanation of this incredible masterpiece, connecting it to the history of Florence and the life of its author. Who was Michelangelo, and why is he renowned as one of the greatest artists of all time? You will learn about his life, about his difficult temper, and – of course – about his art.\n\nThe Accademia doesn’t only host David, but also other masterpieces by Michelangelo such as the Prisoners and the Pietà di Palestrina. It’s one of the best places to get in touch with Michelangelo’s art and have a broad idea of his revolutionary work.\n\nAfter the city walk, you’ll have some free time (about 3 hours) that you can use to relax at a local restaurant, try some of the most famous Tuscan dishes, do some shopping in the city center or continue the exploration of Florence with your tour assistant.\n\nThen, you will go back to the train station, and you’ll take the fast train back to Rome together with your tour assistant.\n\nYour tour will end at Termini train station, where your tour assistant will help you get a taxi to reach your hotel, or recommend a restaurant for dinner in case you’re still hungry.\n\nEven if you have not planned to visit Florence, don’t miss the chance to discover this wonderful city with our Florence day trip from Rome.\n\nIn only one day you will enrich your vacation with an unforgettable experience, see some of the most beautiful artworks and landscapes in the world, and try some of the best dishes and wines.\n\nBook our Florence Day Trip Tour and explore the wonders of the Renaissance capital with a professional, private guide.\n\nLet us help you build some great memories from Italy.\n\nThe order of the sights might vary due to logistic reasons."
