        "text": "On the pillow in which Oloferne is seated there is the signature of Donatello OPVS – DONATELLI – FLO, and also the writing EXEMPLUM – SAL – PVB – CIVES – POS- MCCCCXCV, a writing that was added when the statue was placed outside the Palazzo della Signoria in 1495.\n\nBut by August 1464, when it was still in the Medici palace, there were two other writings on the basement that had been lost: “Regna cadunt luxu surgent virtutibus urbes caesa vides humili with superb manu”, that is: “The kingdoms fall by lust, rise again thanks to the virtues: here is the neck of pride cut from the hand of humility “. And between the years 1464 and 1469 Piero de ’Medici added a second inscription: Regna Cadunt / Salus Publica / Petrus Medices Cos. Fi. Libertati simul et fortitudini hanc mulieris statuam quo cives invicto constantique animo ad rem pub. redderunt dedicavit, that is “Piero son of Cosimo dedicated the statue of this woman to that freedom and fortitude conferred on the republic by the unconstrained and constant spirit of the citizens.” Everything suggests that for Donatello and his peers Giuditta, heavily clothed and covered, represented continence that overcomes pride and lust symbolized by Holofernes limply seated on a pillow. And, by definition, the republic, like Florence and Venice, was compared to ancient Greece and Rome and opposed to tyrannical states like Milan, the enemy of Florence. Holofernes was the general of a totalitarian monarch. Giuditta, savior of the freedom of Israel, was related to the resistance of the Florentine Republic against the tyranny of the Visconti of Milan.\n\nOn the triangular base of the statue there are three bas-reliefs based on the cherubs. On the first one winged, naked or semi-naked putti of different ages, they harvest and carry the grapes in the baskets; below is a lying drunk figure, wearing a mask and holding a jug. It is a Bacchic scene, as in the feast in honor of Dionysus in ancient Greece, where they acted masked actors.\n\nUnlike those of the bas-reliefs, the cherubs on Judith’s dress symbolize her victory.\n\nDonatello’s last masterpieces are the two lost wax bronze pulpits for the church of San Lorenzo in Florence, executed after 1460. It is likely that at the time of his death in 1466 they were completed by his helpers Bartolomeo Bellano and Bertoldo of Giovanni, the latter also a friend of Lorenzo the Magnificent. They have suffered various vicissitudes including the arrangement on the columns at the beginning of the ‘500 and a subsequent reassembly in the middle of the’ 500. In both of them Donatello created a narrow trabeation band in which the small putti appear, and it is the first time that this type of decoration reappears after the classical era, in fact Donatello was inspired by the Roman sarcophagi. In these two pulpits the putti return to be secondary elements that comment on the scenes below, with Bacchic dances and references to the grape harvest and wine.\n\nThe Pulpit of the Passion\n\nAlexander VI Borgia proclaimed the Jubilee of 1500.\n\nThe master of the papal chapel since 1484 Giovanni Burcardo (Johannes Burckardus) who wrote\n\nthe “Libri Caeremoniales”, a chronicle of the Vatican ceremonies, tells us that the Holy Door was created for the first time in St. Peter’s Basilica by Pope Alexander VI Borgia on the occasion of the Jubilee of 1500, which he proclaimed in March 1499 with the Inter Multiples bubble; for the occasion he also had a new road opened, the Via Alessandrina (destroyed in the 1930s).\n\nAnd in fact with the bull “Inter curas multiplices” Alexander VI announced the Jubilee for Christmas and ordered the simultaneous opening of the Holy Door of St. Peter’s and of the other three patriarchal basilicas: San Paolo, Lateranense, Santa Maria Maggiore. And he added “… with our hands we will open the Door of the Basilica of Blessed Peter…”.\n\nA new masonry door was built in St. Peter’s Basilica, but prepared so that during the Jubilee ceremony it would be easy for the pope to break a small central part with three hammer blows. The rest of the gate was demolished by the masons. The first to enter the church was to be the pope. Although Alexander VI perhaps did not create the ceremony of opening and closing the Holy Door from scratch, he gave it first order and uniformity by establishing a solemn and rigid ritual in the rules to be observed. It was Alexander VI who also called the Jubilee the Holy Year.\n\nIn this way he placed the Holy Door at the center of the jubilee rites, making this purely architectural element a profound spiritual value full of symbolic meanings.\n\nAnd the hammer with which the pope struck the door took on a symbolic-religious meaning, finding an ideal affinity with the rod with which Moses struck a rock in the desert from which water flowed for his people. Clement VII, in the following Jubilee of 1525, had the mason’s hammer used by Alexander VI replaced with one of solid gold or gilded silver, as Giorgio Vasari also confirms in his sixteenth-century “Ragionamenti”.\n\nThe sculptures were originally to be made in bronze but the AMBC had specified instead that the statues were to be made of white granite.\n\nFraser’s two statuary groups were titled “Music and Harvest” and “Aspiration and Literature”. known as The Arts of Peace. Both modeled in a modern neoclassical style.\n\nThe contracts (probably for the full-size models) were made shortly after the CFA meeting on 11 December 1930.\n\nIn January 1931 the positioning of the 4 sculptures was again discussed.\n\nFinally, on October 24, 1932, the Commission visited Fraser’s studio in Westport, Connecticut and approved his designs.\n\nWhen the models half the size of the originals were about to be completed in 1933, the CFA put the project on hold. By now, the United States was in the midst of the Great Depression. The bridge was finished and cost more than budget and the funds available for the 4 granite statues were seized under the 1933 Economy Act. However, the CFA, with the full-size models already paid for, asked the sculptors to finish the their work. The CFA visited Friedlander’s studio in White Plains, New York, on October 14, 1933, and approved his designs.\n\nIn October 1933, the CFA approved the height of the statues (each would be 16 feet (4.9 m) high), the pedestals 13 feet (4.0 m) high, and the height of the plinth under the statues would be 1 foot tall (0.30m). Granite from Mount Airy, from North Carolina, would have been used for the bases.\n\nApplications for partial funding for the four monuments in 1935, 1937, 1938 and 1939 were unsuccessful. However, in 1939 Fraser and Friedlander completed the full-size models.\n\nJames Earle Fraser suggested that the statues be cast in bronze, which allowed for considerable savings over granite sculpture; Friedlander and the CFA agreed with this suggestion, and in August 1941 both sculptors signed contracts to redesign their models for bronze casting.\n\nBut during the Second World War, the money for the project was no longer available.\n\nIn January 1948, the National Park Service informed the CFA that $ 1 million in authorized funds existed to complete the Arlington Memorial Bridge. Fraser reported on the foundry quotes he had received in the summer of 1947 and, at the request of the Park Service, the CFA asked Congress for an initial grant of $ 185,000 to start the work, but did not get it.\n\nAt the CFA meeting on September 13, 1948, the commission again discussed how to obtain an appropriation to perform the groups of statues. American foundries had not been converted from war work to art fusion. In addition, only one foundry in America was large enough to handle the work, and its contract required a sliding scale clause, a clause not accepted by federal budget officials. Congressmen thought of asking a European nation to consider statues, for the payment of castings, as part of the Marshall Plan, with broad consensus from the CFA and sculptors.\n\nIn 1949, the Italian government agreed to use funds from the Marshall Plan to cast the four statues of the Arlington Memorial Bridge. In October, officials of the National Park Service and the sculptors Fraser and Friedlander came to Italy to inspect various foundries and found a work agreement: and in 1950 the work began. The plaster models arrived in Italy in January. However, customs officials kept them for several weeks outdoors, in the cold, in the rain and snow. Fraser’s student, Edward Minazolli, traveled to Italy to help supervise the casting process and found that the models had deteriorated. With the permission of Fraser and Friedlander, he had them repaired and restored.\n\nThe Bruni Foundry in Rome and the Lagana Foundry in Naples cast the sculptures assigned to them. and intended to use fire gilding. But the quality of the samples was not satisfactory, as was the color of the gilding. Fraser then asked to apply for part of the casting work to the Battaglia foundry in Milan and the Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry in Florence. The work of the Milanese foundry was as discreet as that carried out by the Neapolitan foundry. The Florentine foundry, on the other hand, did an excellent job of casting but did not like the color of the gilding: it was then made in Milan.\n\nThe four statuary groups were assembled at the end of April 1951.\n\nAcross from the Arlington Memorial Bridge from the District of Columbia, the Sacrifice sculpture is on the right.\n\nA bearded and muscular male nude, a symbol of Mars, holds a small child in his arms, with his head bowed. The half-naked woman is to her right, from behind with her head turned back to look at the knight, while with her outstretched right arm she touches his right elbow.\n\nEach monument weighed approximately 80,000 pounds (36,000 kg). Each was 19 feet (5.8 m) tall, 16 feet (4.9 m) long and 8 feet (2.4 m) wide. While the pieces of the Sacrifice were all welded together, those of James Earle Fraser’s “Music and Harvest” were bolted together cold.\n\nThe total cost of transporting, casting, and gilding the four groups was $ 300,000. Fraser and Friedlander were each paid $ 107,000.\n\nEach pedestal has 36 equally spaced gilt bronze stars at the top, representing the number of states in the United States at the time of the American Civil War. At the front of each pedestal is a classic flower crown, designed and sculpted by Vincent Tonelli (who also sculpted the Trylon of Freedom in front of E. Barrett Prettyman’s US courthouse). According to art curator Susan Menconi The Arts of War and The Arts of Peace were the largest equestrian sculptures in the United States.\n\nThe Second World War began a period of great difficulty which did not spare even the Pietro Bazzanti Gallery.\n\nNo brightening appeared on the horizon when in 1960 the Gallery passed to the Marinelli family, owners since 1905 of the Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry in Florence. The new management was able to exploit the years of economic recovery by also reopening its own sculpture studio, and giving greater vigor to its very popular Foundry.\n\nFor the historic Gallery, all this meant a new course, marked by a more managerial direction able to control the artistic quality of the works more rigorously and to organize more extensive assistance in exporting.\n\nIn addition to the nineteenth-century plaster models inherited from the old property, those from the gipsoteca of the Foundry were added, all casts made on the originals by Ferdinando Marinelli Sr., creator of the homonymous Foundry, made in the 1930s.\n\nThe already attractive catalog of the Bazzanti gallery has grown with a vast and highly qualified collection of bronzes, known throughout the world since the early 1900s.\n\nIn 1976 the reins of the Gallery and the Foundry passed into the hands of Ferdinando Marinelli Jr., who still today feeds the two souls of Bazzanti: that of the marble sculpted in his studio, and that of the bronzes cast in the Foundry with the ancient Renaissance techniques of lost wax casting learned from grandfather Ferdinando Marinelli Sr.\n\nThe meaning of this scene has been much discussed, since the sword of David wants to indicate precisely the small bas-relief that therefore probably symbolizes the “moral” of the entire sculpture. There is represented a chariot drawn by two winged and naked putti; on the cart a figure without wings is enthroned and receives gifts from two other winged putti; behind the throne appears a naked and fat character with no wings behind, with at his feet, an amphora. The scene seems to be taken from an ancient Roman gem, probably from the Medici collection; it is very probable that the seated figure is Bacchus accompanied by Silenus, and that the winged putto is offering him a cup of wine. Being on the Goliath helmet, it could be the representation of incontinence, pride and arrogance, vices associated with Goliath (and with the tyrannical enemies of Florence) won by the virtue of David (the Republic of Florence).\n\nAttis\n\nIt is a bronze statue in all-round, about 104 centimetres high. Although with various attributes, it is a putto standing up, and it is the first time that in the Renaissance a putto is sculpted in all-round in this size, without being an accessory or secondary character. It is absolutely in classic pagan style, so much so that in the 17th century it was taken for an ancient Roman work. Besides being beautiful, it is also enigmatic, there is no sculpture in antiquity with all its features and attributes: it seems that Donatello has invented a new type of creature. He is standing, in a relaxed chiasmus, with both arms raised. He joyfully looks at his left hand where the thumb and middle finger are closed, probably holding something that was lost; he has tangled hair tied by a string that holds a flower in his forehead, he wears a belt around his waist with sculpted poppy caps that supports a sort of stocking-pants that leave his buttocks and genitals exposed; at his feet he has two squat and undefined pairs of wings, he wears sandals with which he tramples a snake. On his shoulders he has two beautiful wings, and at the beginning of his buttocks a small tail.\n\nthe belt of Hypnos, the wings at the feet of Mercury.\n\nFor Erwin Panofsky (Renaissance and Renaissance in Western art) it is the allegory of Time that rolls the dice; and in fact Pan’s tail is the symbol of the association of Pan with the universe of which Time holds the fate. The wings on the shoulders and feet, and the snake, are symbols of Time. The barbaric pants are those of Aion, the demon of time of Iranian origin. The poppies of the belt, emblems of sleep and death, represent its dual nature as creator and destroyer. And the missing object that probably had between his fingers was just a dice. Time is a destroyer who plays dice with humanity, our destiny is in his hands.\n\nIn a fragment of Heraclius found in the “Refutatio omnium haeresium” (book IX, chapters 3 and 4) of Hippolytus of Rome the Demon of Time is defined as a frivolous child who plays with dice with humanity and our destiny is in his hands. There is this phrase also in Carmina LXXXXV of the Byzantine Gergorio Nazanzieno. When Lorenzo the Magnificent succeeded in 1349 to bring the Council between the Roman and Oriental church in Florence, the emperor of Byzantium John VIII Palaeologus and his numerous court\n\nhe turned to the binomial Ferdinando Marinelli-Sergio Benvenuti. The calls between the three of us followed each other along with the faxes, exchanges of drawings, sketches, notes. The new stadium projects included around it an embankment that Dudi wanted covered with grass, shrubs, trees, with various grazing bronze horses. It was then that Pat Bowlen decided to give the citizens of Denver a monument with a strong symbolic content: a group of seven horses that climbed the embankment near the entrance stairway of the new stadium. The horses had to be seven because this was the number of the champion of the Broncos team, John Elway, (and also the lucky number in the life of Dudi Berretti).\n\nAt the invitation of the “Stadium Management Co. Denver Broncos” I flew with Sergio Benvenuti to Denver to present the project to Stadium Management and the various artistic commissions in the District. The monument received the full approval and applause of all. Upon returning to Florence Benvenuti immediately set to work performing the models ad 1/5 of the size of the final sculpture. Shortly afterwards Dudi Beretti together with the landscape architect Lanson Nichols came to Florence to see the models and to discuss with us the best setting for the fund on which the seven horses would be run."
