For the latter interpretation she won the David di Donatello 2011 as Best Supporting Actress.\n\nMoreover, she won the Nastro d’argento for Best Actress for the film \"10 giorni con Babbo Natale\" by Alessandro Genovesi.

She was the first actress in Italy to play Sarah Kane's 4:48 Psychosis.\n\nBesides her acting career, she is also a stage director. She was the first in Italy to stage works by Tony Kushner and her husband, Dennis Kelly.\n\nIn cinema she has worked with directors such as Antonio Capuano, Silvio Soldini and Paolo Sorrentino; she also co-starred in Matteo Garrone's third film.\n\nShe played the role of Sofia Pisanello, the wife of the character played by Roberto Benigni, in Woody Allen's “To Rome with Love”.\n\nIn 2022, she participated in the Venice Film Festival with the film 'Amanda', directed by Carolina Cavalli, and toured national theatres with the play 'L’esperimento', which she wrote and she also performed in it."
