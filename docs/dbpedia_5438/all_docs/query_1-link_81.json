        "text": "Maurizio Mattioli is the favorite actor of Sergio Martino, he works next to Monica Vitti and Ugo Tognazzi in Scusa se è poco (1982) and instead begins to do the comic shoulder for actors such as Christian De Sica, Massimo Boldi, but especially the already nominated Pippo Franco, Leo Gullotta and Oreste Lionello that he will find on television when he joins the Bagaglino, directed by Pingitore in his parodies of Bill Clinton. But those times are still very far away, he will first have to pass More beautiful than this (1982) with Vittorio Caprioli, but also many films by Michele Massimo Tarantini, Neri Parenti and Carlo Vanzina.\n\nHis film debut was with Mariano Laurenti’s film Patroclooo!… and the soldier Camillone, big and cool 1973, who sees him wearing the shoes of a soldier together with Pippo Franco, Piero Vida, Pupo De Luca, Luciana Turina, Adriana Facchetti and Giorgio Bracardi. From that moment on, it will be a constant presence of policemen and comedies with a military background. In 1978 he worked alongside Alida Valli in Porco Mondo and in his career he could also boast of having been directed by Nanni Moretti in a tiny role (a man in the crew) in Sogni d’oro (1981). In 1991 he was directed by Mario Monicelli in Rossini! Rossini! with Philippe Noiret, Claudio Gora and Vittorio Gassman, then it will launch in series and miniseries such as: Gas Station (1989), Iron Class 2 (1991) and its spin off Those of the special (1992). It is the meeting with Stefano Reali that makes him change his career, Reali will impose him in fact in numerous fiction, genre that will never disdain to participate, from Una storia italiana (1992) onwards. He works with Stefania Sandrelli in Nottataccia (1992), is again on television with the tv film For love or friendship (1993) and then experiments with the theater with the role of Annibale in “Un paio d’ali” (1997), but especially with that of Mastro Titta (role inherited from Aldo Fabrizi) in a legendary “Rugantino” (1998 – 2004) that held the bench for three editions, within which will support: Valerio Mastandrea, Sabrina Ferilli, Simona Marchini. He also voiced some animated characters for the films Il principe d’Egitto, Z la formica and La gang del bosco, without forgetting the dog from the TV series Tequila & Bonetti (2000). But his career, at least in this second part, is mainly projected towards the small screen, a choice that will allow him to become a face much loved by television that will appreciate both the cadence from Romanaccio DOC and the good-natured air that circulates around him. He took part in Ladri si nasce (1997) and his sequel Ladri si diventa (1998), passing through the TV series The mysteries of Cascina Vianello and Ultimo (1998), arriving at Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna (1998), Cuori in campo (1998), Anni ’50 (1998) and Anni 60 (1999), Tre stelle (1999), La casa delle beffe (2000), Villa Ada (2000, still with Sandrelli), Cuccioli (2002) and La palestra (2003). Nominated for the Nastro d’Argento for Best Supporting Actor for Il pranzo della domenica (2003) with Rocco Papaleo, he starred alongside Valerio Foglia Manzillo and Claudio Bigagli in Verso Nord (2004), directed by his friend Reali, in Il lupo by Stefano Calvagna and in Questa notte è ancora nostra (2008), but will still prefer the small screen with: O la va o la spacca (2004), A cyclone in famiglia (2005), The Colors of Life (2005), I Cesaroni (2006), Domani è un altra truffa (2006), Piper (2007) and Di che peccato sei? (2007). In recent years he has returned to the big screen with other funny comedies by Carlo Vanzina and Paolo Genovese. In 2011, in addition to his participation in the drama film Almeno tu nell’universo, he was also cast in the comedy directed by Ezio Greggio Box Office 3D. The following year it is again directed by Vanzina in the comedy Good Day, set in different Italian cities in order to tell the various stereotypes that characterize our country, as well as by Fragasso in Operazione vacanze. We also find it in Massimiliano Bruno’s Viva l’Italia and in E io non pago – Un film d’evasione by Alessandro Capone, two comedies representing the current state of moral dignity of our country. He will return to work in numerous comedies with Vanzina (Mai Stati Uniti, Sapore di te) and Federico Moccia (Universitari – Molto più più che amici), then collaborating on the comedy by Paolo Genovese from the stellar cast Tutto colpa di Freud. In July 2014 he received the special recognition Leggio d’oro, for having distinguished himself in film and television dubbing in Italy. In this year that consecrates him as one of the cult characters of the small and large Italian screen, he will also be in the cinemas with When you die… You will die! and Ambo. In 2015, on the other hand, there are three other lucky roles as an actor, in the films Le leggi del desiderio by Silvio Muccino, and in Fratelli di sangue by Pietro Tamaro, two films of different genres, where Mattioli juggles with his usual naturalness. Two comedies, in 2016, will definitely make him feel closer to his natural artistic habitat: Crime does not retire and Everything can happen in the village of miracles. In 2017, the two films MMA Love Never Dies by Riccardo Ferrero and Italian Business by Mario Chiavalin.\n\nWith the Film Theatre Academy he starred in the medium-length film “Waiting for the Sun”, directed by Antonio Monaco.\n\nMassimo Boldi is an Italian actor, comedian, film producer, musician and television presenter, also known by the nickname of Cipollino, named after Max Cipollino, one of his best-known comic characters. For more than twenty years he has partnered with the Roman actor Christian De Sica, with whom he formed one of the most successful associations of Italian cinema (except in the period from 2005 to 2018 for production causes). He is also the founder of Mari Film. In his television career he has won 11 Telegatti.\n\nAfter some participation and compression roles in the late seventies and early eighties (Movie rush – La febbre del cinema nel 1976, Il… Belpaese di Luciano Salce nel 1977, Sono fotogenico di Dino Risi nel 1980, Eccezzziunale… veramente di Carlo Vanzina nel 1982, Il ragazzo di campagna di Castellano e Pipolo nel 1984), has known success as the new comedian of Italian cinema from the middle of the same decade with the diptychs of School of thieves (1986, 1987) and Yuppies (1986, 1986)A cult film of which De Sica and Christian continued with a series of Christmas comedies – the so-called cine-panettoni – produced by Luigi and Aurelio De Laurentiis for Filmauro.\n\nIn 1992 Boldi ran for election with the Italian Socialist Party[6] in the Como-Sondrio-Varese constituency: on that occasion he won 1,930 votes and was not elected (finished sixth on the Garofano list, which elected three deputies, more than 14,000 votes from the last of the winning candidates). [7] This remains a short parenthesis, set aside, which immediately returned to acting. He has repeatedly stated that he has voted for Silvio Berlusconi since the 1994 general election and that he is one of his best friends.\n\nMassimo Boldi’s only experience in a dramatic role is his performance in Pupi Avati’s 1996 film Festival. In it he played a comedian in decline who finds himself unpredictably in the running for an award at the Venice Film Festival. The reference is to the true story lived by the great Walter Chiari and Carlo Delle Piane during the award ceremony of the “Leone” at the Venice Film Festival in 1986.\n\nAlso at Rai will do Acrobats you die, The tapestry and Fantastic 8, the latter conducted by Adriano Celentano.\n\nOn the networks Mediaset had already participated in successful programs such as Drive In, where he played in the first edition of his character “Cipollino” and in the others the parody of Star Trek, became “Bold Trek”, then Risatissima, Grand Hotel, 4 editions of Sabato al circo and La strana coppia, as well as countless participations in television programs both Rai and Mediaset. In particular in A roundabout on the sea, again in partnership with Teo Teocoli will give rise to a parody of the tales of Diabolik: Boldi was in the gag the thief, only apparently silly, “Diaboldik”, while Teocoli played a certain “Inspector Rinko”Clear pun on Inspector Ginko, the thief’s nemesis in black tights. Boldi also hosted Canale 5 Striscia la notizia (1996-1997), three editions of Scherzi a parte (1994 /2002/ 2005) and La sai l’ultima? (2008). He has also been several times a guest of Paolo Bonolis in the program Ciao Darwin , as head of some categories in different editions.\n\nAfter the separation from De Sica, in 2006 Boldi shot Olé by Carlo Vanzina. In 2007 he founded his own production company, Mari Film s.r.l. and shot Matrimonio alle Bahamas by Claudio Risi, with the return in the cast of Fichi d’India, Biagio Izzo and Enzo Salvi, released in theaters on 16 November, earning in the first weekend more than 3,200,000 euros, then in 2008 The girlfriend of Enrico Oldoini’s father, with Simona Ventura who placed first at the box office in 3 days with 2,850,000 euros. In 2010 it was released in the rooms A Natale mi sposo di Paolo Costella, with Vincenzo Salemme and Nancy Brilli, who finished first at the box office in the first week with 2,680,000 euros, and in 2011 Matrimonio a Parigi, again by Claudio Risi, coming out for the first time in October and getting first place at the box office in the first week. After three years of absence, he returns to the cinema with Ma tu di che segno 6? (2014) by Neri Parenti, with Gigi Proietti, Vincenzo Salemme and Ricky Memphis, Matrimonio al Sud (2015), again by Paolo Costella, La coppia dei campioni by Giulio Base, alongside Max Tortora, and Un Natale al Sud by Federico Marsicano (2016), Natale da chef (2017) by Neri Parenti.\n\nPer Canale 5 starred in his first fiction, giving birth to the character of “great dad” Lorenzo Fumagalli in the television series Un ciclone in famiglia, directed by Carlo Vanzina and with Maurizio Mattioli and Barbara De Rossi among others. The first episodes of Un ciclone in famiglia were filmed in 2004, just 24 days after the death of Boldi’s wife; they aired for the first time in January 2005, obtaining a great success with critics and audiences among young people.\n\nThis led to four more series in the following years. In 2009 Boldi returned to work with Mattioli and De Rossi in Un coccodrillo per amico and in 2010 with the only De Rossi in Fratelli Benvenuti, both fiction made again for Canale 5, which on 21 December 2012 will also broadcast his first 4-legged Christmas Panettone.\n\nCinema\n\nDue cuori, una cappella, directed by Maurizio Lucidi (1975)\n\nWhat sign are you? , directed by Sergio Corbucci

Singer, dancer and talented artist, he played and sang in various bands in Germany, mainly Rock’n’Roll and Rockabilly. Fascinated by martial arts as a child, Claudiu began training in Taekwon-Do at the age of ten, Ninjitsu at the age of 14, who considers his main skill and was also trained in Wingchun and Muay Thai. That makes him an all-around martial artist.

His first visit to the United States was at the age of 19 as a model. Two years later he moved to Huntington Beach, California, where he lived for a year and a half and studied acting and directing at Golden West College. After numerous engagements as a stage actor, musicals, short films and feature films in Los Angeles and also in Stuttgart, Germany, he wrote, produced, directed and starred in his first short film, “Martial Judgment.” This film was awarded at the Martial Arts Short Film Festival in Berlin in 2006.

He also has a degree of expertise in French, Russian and Portuguese. Claudiu Raymond began focusing on the production of his films in 2006. Before founding SnipeShot Productions & Casting in the same year, he gained extensive experience as a co-producer at the German production company Los Banditos Films.There he helped produce feature films, commercials and music videos and was also active in many areas of film production behind the camera, while pursuing his acting career. SnipeShot also served as a casting agency specializing in specific types (mugs of gangsters, glamorous models, etc.), exotic vehicles and classic cars for movies, commercials, music videos and more. In 2011, Claudiu changed the name of its production company to Rockoco Films and in 2013 moved its headquarters to Beverly Hills, California. He now produces thrillers, comedies, science fiction and action films.
