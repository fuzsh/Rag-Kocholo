When they meet again by chance nine years after graduating, they decide to turn their careers around and open a weight loss centre by refurbishing the country house belonging to Alfio’s wife. Attracted by the advertising campaign, clients are quick to arrive, but amidst gruelling workouts, gymnastics, empty plates (with the only exception of a strange concoction) they soon begin to doubt the effectiveness of the treatment and rebel. When the situation seems to have become irrecoverable, the two friends come up with a stroke of genius.\n\nTHE DIRECTOR: LUCA VERDONE\n\nBorn in Rome in 1953 and graduated in Humanities (history and art studies), since 1973 he has made numerous Art documentaries (about Sergio Leone, Luchino Visconti, Antologia del Neorealismo, Futurismo Movimento Arte/Vita, Michelangelo Antonioni, Le Immagini e il Tempo) with which he has won many international prizes and the Silver Ribbon Award. After a traineeship as an opera director with P. Samaritani, he made his debut in 1977 with L’Impresario by W.A. Mozart and went on until the latest staging of Carmen at the Bellini Theatre in Catania (2020). Since 1973 he has been a documentary and TV show director. He debuted in film with 7 Chili in 7 Giorni (1986), followed by La Bocca (1991) with T. Welch and A. Valli, awarded with a David di Donatello Award, Il Piacere di Piacere (2001) with A. Liskova, V. Proshina, G. Carotenuto Vaz, La Meravigliosa Avventura di Antonio Franconi (2011) with M. Ranieri and O. M. Guerrini, Alberto il Grande (2013), made with his brother Carlo, Le Memorie di Giorgio Vasari (2018) with B. Selby.\n\nDIRECTOR’S STATEMENT\n\n“The film was intended to renew the “Commedia all’Italiana” (Italian-style Comedy) by introducing a surreal and farcical element. I turned for inspiration to British comedy films such as A Private Function and to Steno’s comedies with Alberto Sordi (Piccola Posta). I felt a broadening of the genre was necessary and I borrowed much imagery from Fellini’s films. I wanted to develop a style that winked at purely escapist cinema to deal ironically with the issue of slimming treatments, a great fetish of the Consumer Society.”\n\nFILMOGRAPHY\n\n1979 Antologia del Neorealismo (doc)\n\n1986 7 chili in 7 giorni\n\n1991 La bocca\n\n2001 Il piacere di piacere\n\n2005 Fabrizi e Fellini, lo strano incontro (doc)\n\n2011 La meravigliosa avventura di Antonio Franconi\n\n2013 Alberto il grande (doc)"
