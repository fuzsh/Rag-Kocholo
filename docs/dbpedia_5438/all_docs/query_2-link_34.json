        "text": "Maria Grazia Cucinotta Kicks Off 2015 Shanghai International Film Festival\n\nSicilian movie star, Maria Grazia Cucinotta (Our interview with Cucinotta)was in Shanghai over the weekend to kick off the 2015 Shanghai International Film Festival. Ratified by the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the Shanghai International Film Festival will run for nine days. The festival offers cinema-goers the chance to see a number of Italian films that were never imported into theaters in China, which restricts the number of foreign films that can enter the market each year.\n\nThis year, eight Italian films will be featured at the festival:\n\nErmanno Olmi's \"Greenery will bloom again\"\n\n\"Black Souls\" by Francesco Munzi: Focus Italy\n\n\"Greenery will bloom again\" by Ermanno Olmi: Focus Italy\n\n\"Happily mixed up\" by Massimiliano Bruno: Focus Italy\n\n\"Invisible Boy\" by Gabriele Salvatores: Focus Italy\n\n\"Italo\" by Alessia Scarso: Focus Italy\n\n\"Italy in a Day\" - Un giorno da italiani by Gabriele Salvatores: Focus Italy\n\n\"Land of Saints\" by Fernando Muraca: Focus Italy\n\n\"We are Francesco\" by Guendalina Zampagni: Focus Italy\n\nFor more information- check out the English version of their website.. www.siff.com\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nCanada's Italian Contemporary Film Festival to Feature the Award Winning \"Noi e La Giulia\"\n\n“We’re born with our hands full. That’s why as newborn babies, we clench our fists.. because we have the best gifts we could ever wish for.. innocence, curiosity, a will to live. But then they bring us up to be God-fearing. So, we can’t blame ourselves for fearing everything else as well.”\n\nEdoardo Leo’s “Noi e La Giulia” is a thought-provoking, hilarious trip on waking up one day over the age of 40 and realizing that you don’t have a whole lot in life to account for. “You turn 40 and you realize your best friends are a negro, a cammorista and a pair of losers” proclaims a tearful Fausto, Leo’s politically incorrect, right wing character.\n\nThe film begins with a day in the lives of three Roman 40-somethings from completely different backgrounds. There is Fausto (Edoardo Leo), a macho, self-confident on-air personality that sells mock watches and is wanted by creditors, Diego (Luca Argentero), a disenchanted car salesman unable to show emotion and Claudio (Stefano Fresi), who is being left by his wife as he shuts the doors to his family business that began in 1910. The unlikely trio are brought together by a country property they are each looking to buy and turn into an agriturismo. Since none of them can afford the property on their own, they decide to become partners. Enter Sergio, a slightly bitter left-wing comrade who is looking to collect unpaid wages from Fausto, and Elisa (Anna Foglietta), a good-hearted, pregnant woman jilted at the alter.. and what ensues is a laugh-until-you-cry adventure of a bunch of self-proclaimed failures, that for the first time in their lives, feel like they are succeeding at doing something good. However, it comes with a price as the local countryside thugs threaten to destroy them if they don’t pay “protection money”. Vito (Carlo Buccirosso) leads the way for a whole host of bandits and shady characters relentless on collecting their fees.\n\nThere are so many elements that make this film a modern-day masterpiece. Leo and his cast perfectly convey the magic we feel when a dream is realized. There is the right amount of conflict and tension just when it seems that everything is going well. The comic timing between the characters is impeccable. The professionalism and skill of the actors bring an element of classic Italian cinema. “I soliti ignoti” (The Big Deal on Madonna Street) came to mind many times, particularly when hostage, Vito, complained about the onion in his carbonara. I couldn’t help but think of these petty criminals in the middle of robbing a house, helping themselves to some pasta and cece that was on the stove. This only validates what I have been saying for more than a decade in my articles about contemporary Italian cinema. We have indeed reached a new “Golden Age” in which writers, directors, actors and all filmmakers for that matter, have reinvented cinema for their own generation while keeping in mind the roots of the past. Yesterday, we had Mario Monicelli, Vittorio Gassman, Claudio Cardinale, Marcello Mastroianni and Antonio De Curtis. Today, we have Edoardo Leo, Alessandro Gassman, Anna Foglietta, Luca Argentaro and Stefano Fresi- each actor with his or her own signature style and characterisics but with an echo and nod of respect for those who set the original bar. I believe those maestros of the past would be pleased to see the actors to whom they have passed the torch.\n\n“Noi e La Giulia” has won a whole slew of awards, including two recent David di Donatello’s for Carlo Buccirosso’s performance and Edorado Leo’s direction. The film will be shown this week at the Italian Contemporary Film Festival in Canada.

It is the only international competition dedicated to cinematographic locations that gives artistic recognition to audiovisual works, directors, directors of cinematography and set designers that endorse Italian and international locations, putting the emphasis on the landscape and cultural identity.\n\nOut of the 109 films selected for the festival, 54 will be enjoying their national premieres, 2 their international premieres and 2 their European premieres. 42 are Italian productions or co-productions, and the competition will feature 40 films, including feature films, documentaries and short films, which will battle it out for the festival’s awards.\n\nThe festival awarded the multi-award-winning writer of Black Souls, Francesco Munzi (who won 9 David di Donatello awards including for Best Film and Best Director) the Ischia Film Award 2015, naming him Best Director of the year. The award, which has previously been given to illustrious people from the world of film such as the French director Benoit Jacquot and the Oscar-winning Bille August, will be awarded on 29 June.\n\nAs a way of promoting the land through audiovisuals in collaboration with independent festivals, the Ischia Film Festival will once again be showcasing films set on the Baltic Coast this year. In collaboration with the biggest promoter of films from Northern Europe, the Nordische Filmtage Lübeck, for the fourth year running some of the biggest cinematographic works of 2014 (none of which were released in Italy) that place greatest emphasis on the cultural identity of the countries of Northern Europe will be screened.\n\nOpening the focus will be Norwegian director Jan Vardøen with the Italian premiere of Heart of Lightness, which is based on the piece of theatre by Henrik Ibsen. The focus will feature other important films such as the Swedish film Och Piccadilly Circus ligger inte i Kumla by director Bengt Danneborn, the Finnish documentary Joka muistaa vähän enempi by Minna Valjane, the Latvian documentary Pelican in the desert by Viesturs Kairišs and a film set in the Faroe Islands, Ludo, by Katrin Ottarsdóttir, who will be attending the festival with his producer Hugin Eide.\n\nOn 2 July the Ischia Film Festival will be hosting the Bari branch of Creative Europe Desk Media for an info day on the MEDIA sub-programme of Europa Creativa.\n\n-Written by Camillo De Marco for Cineuropa\n\n↧\n\nBasilicata: Terra di Cinema - Edoardo Leo's \"Noi e La Giulia\"\n\n\"Lucania\" Photo by Jeannine Guilyard\n\nUpdated 13 July- Evening dedicated to Filmmaking in Basilicata at L'Isola del Cinema in Rome..\n\n20.30 - Serata speciale - Basilicata\n\nEdoardo Leo in un reading musicale\n\naccompagnato da Jonis Baschir.\n\nIngresso gratuito\n\n21.30 - proiezione del film\n\nNoi e la Giulia di Edoardo Leo\n\nPresente il regista e parte del cast\n\nIt’s a vast, spacious land untouched and unpolluted by industry. Its rolling hills, majestic mountains and ancient buildings have stood the test of time. Throughout the years, it has served as a backdrop for iconic filmmakers like Pier Paolo Pasolini and Francesco Rosi. Now, a whole new generation of filmmakers is discovering the magic of Basilicata as a natural set, bringing the region to the world’s stage once again.\n\nEdoardo Leo’s award-winning film, “Noi e La Giulia,” is the latest high-profile film to be shot in Basilicata. Adapted from Fabio Bartolomei’s book, “Giulia 1300 e altri miracoli,” the story follows three unlikely partners as they join hands on the risky business venture of turning a dilapidated farmhouse into a modern agriturismo.\n\nThe opening scenes were shot in Rome, with the remainder of the film shot in the countryside of Pomarico, situated in the hills of Matera. The farmhouse in which most of the scenes took place is called Masseria San Felice. Built in the late 18th century, the property belonged to the Castellano family, which owned much of the land in the surrounding area.\n\nLeo’s film was the first major production since the Lucana Film Commission was established, so its director, Paride Leporace, is absolutely thrilled. Leporace works tirelessly to promote the culture and filmmaking of his beloved Basilicata. He travels from south to north and everywhere in between with the region’s filmmakers to spread the word about their southern gem.\n\nPhoto by Alberto Diamante\n\nI recently caught up with Edoardo Leo at the Italian Contemporary Film Festival in Toronto where “Noi e La Giulia” was shown to a packed theater. When Basilicata was mentioned as its backdrop, there was applause and cheers as proud Lucani-Canadians celebrated their beautiful cinematic land. Leo and I talked about his experience working in Basilicata and why he plans on going back.\n\nThere has been a huge surge in film production in Basilicata during the last year, with movies like “Ben Hur,” “007” and your film, “Noi e La Giulia.” Tell me about your experience there.\n\nIt was a great experience. In “Noi e La Giulia,” I never mention Basilicata. I wanted to shoot a sort of symbol of the south of Italy, never mentioning Campania or Cammora or the Sicilian mafia. I just wanted to be in the heart of the south. Now in Basilicata, they have a great film commission so I was able to shoot with fantastic people in a fantastic place, so I am very happy.\n\nHow did you find the farmhouse?\n\nWe saw the farmhouse when we started to scout locations. Sometimes you can spend more than 20 days to find the perfect location. In this movie, we just used the one location and it was the first one I saw. It was a real miracle, but after seeing that farmhouse, we were all convinced that it was perfect. We said, let’s continue to look for something else but we were all convinced that that place was perfect for the movie. Basilicata is a great place and I would like to come back to shoot another film.\n\nWhat makes Basilicata such a great place to shoot a film?\n\nIt’s quiet with great color and great light.\n\nDid you enjoy the culture and the food, in particular? We can’t talk about Basilicata without mentioning the amazing food and of course, Matera’s famous bread.\n\n(Laughs) Yes, the food in Basilicata is great, really great. Every night, we went to Matera to eat the fish and traditional food of the region.. and the bread, too. It all was great.\n\nWhat do you think of all the support for your film and the pride of the people of Basilicata?\n\nThey are very active and they’re very proud of their region. When you talk about Italy, you always talk about the south of Italy, and you mention Sicily, Calabria or Puglia. But in the last three or four years, they really have made Basilicata shine, and they’re right. I think in the next 10 years, more tourists will come to Italy to visit Basilicata. That is what I dream for them.\n\nParide Leporace and his team are extremely prolific in their promotion of the region. They are very active on social media, always promoting the events in which they will attend to talk about the latest production and news of the region. Visit the Lucana Film Commission online at http://www.lucanafilmcommission.it. There, you will find links to follow them on social media.\n\nStay tuned for more posts about Basilicata: Terra di Cinema.\n\n↧\n\nAl GEOpenDay la presentazione della Libreria Multimediale Geocart\n\nIl #GEOpenDay della Geocart, in programma il 26 giugno a Potenza, sarà l'occasione per lanciare alcuni nuovi prodotti altamente innovativi e digitali.\n\nTra le attività in programma verrà presentata la nuova Libreria Multimediale Geocart. Il 26 giugno, durante il #GEOpenDay, nel Centro Entertainment & Media di Geocart, il laboratorio Digital Lighthouse, verranno mostrate alcune delle accurate ricostruzioni virtuali che sono state sviluppate durante i mesi di ricerca e si potranno osservare gli output del percorso elaborativo che i dati percorrono dal momento della loro acquisizione, fino al desktop. La scommessa di Geocart parte proprio da qui, con una nuova tecnica sviluppata dalla società che permette di sfruttare i dati provenienti dai nostri sensori e dalle tecnologie utilizzate nelle fasi di telerilevamento, per ricostruire con soluzioni inedite: accurati modelli digitali 3D e simulazioni virtuali di interi paesaggi, siti d’interesse, set, architetture o di oggetti.\n\nLe stesse Realtà Virtuali, potranno essere esplorate con tecnologia immersiva ed in particolare attraverso l'utilizzo degli occhiali Oculus Rift, sui quali la Geocart sta continuando i test e la preparazione di Demo. Un'esperienza multi sensoriale che permette di immergersi completamente in realtà parallele, che siano fedeli ricostruzioni o scenari di completa fantasia, ma sempre frutto di innovative elaborazioni al computer. Con la Realtà Virtuale viene avvertito lo spazio anche se il proprio corpo non è lì! E' una frattura sensoriale, un'asincronia, la base per infinite sperimentazioni narrative.\n\nPropri a partire da 26 Giugno, attraverso il portale geocartspa.it, l'utente verrà accompagnato in viaggi virtuali interattivi e potrà ammirare alcuni siti lucani di rilevanza storico/culturale, potrà esaminare i modelli 3D, girarci intorno e ritornare a volare nella realtà virtuale per trasferirsi in un'altro luogo. Importanti architetture storiche della città di Potenza come il Ponte Musmeci, la Cattedrale di San Gerardo, Torre Guevara o quelle presenti a Matera, Capitale europea della cultura 2019, come la Cripta del Peccato Originale e il Castello Tramontano, saranno alcuni dei luoghi visitabili interattivamente sulla nostra libreria.\n\nElementi distintivi della soluzione firmata Geocart, riguarda la compresenza di tre livelli di visualizzazione, pensati per migliorare l'esperienza di navigazione: il primo, l'interfaccia di ingresso, sarà una cartografia digitale intuitiva che metterà in evidenza le città o i luoghi in cui saranno presenti le ricostruzioni virtuali; selezionata la città o il luogo da \"visitare\", si accederà al secondo livello, navigando attraverso un modello 3D \"Point Cloud\" su cui saranno presenti le architetture elaborate.\n\nI modelli Point Cloud - nuvole di punti - sono delle suggestive rappresentazioni 3D, frutto dell'elaborazione dei dati provenienti dai sensori Laser Scanner e da fotocamere digitali ad alta risoluzione, utilizzati nelle fasi di telerilevamento aereo e terrestre. Il laser scanner rappresenta uno dei sensori innovativi che la Geocart utilizza per le attività di telerilevamento, per \"radiografare il territorio\", ed è il principale sensore alla base delle nuove tecniche di computer grafica implementate dalla società. I dati point cloud infatti, sono un'output intermedio della catena di processamento che permette di ottenere modelli 3D accurati e realistici. Ultimo livello di interazione con la libreria multimediale, è rappresentato infine, dalla visualizzazione delle accurate realtà virtuali dei siti e delle architetture di interesse. Inoltre, con un apposito comando, potrà essere lanciato il rendering della struttura che si sta visitando e visualizzare il modello nella sua ricostruzione più completa e realistica, con un livello di dettaglio elevatissimo. E' proprio qui che la distanza tra mondo reale e virtuale diventa nullo e le due dimensioni si confonderanno inevitabilmente. Ogni tour virtuale, inoltre, sarà arricchito da informazioni storiche e scientifiche dei modelli visitati e da foto e testimonianze bibliografiche riportate in chiave moderna e critica. L'utente diventerà il \"Caronte\" di se stesso in un viaggio alla scoperta di luoghi, segreti e informazioni pensati, raccontati e visualizzati per rendere unico e piacevole il soggiorno nel mondo digitale.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nActor Domenico Centamore: Pride and Passion for his Sicilian Culture\n\nHe’s had roles in some of the biggest Italian blockbusters of the new millennium and the one thing they all have in common is a fearless protagonist willing to fight until the end against organized crime. Sicilian born actor, Domenico Centamore is proud of his heritage and has worked on films that make strong statements against the corruption his culture has had to endure. He’s had roles in widely popular Mafia-themed films such as “I cento passi” (One Hundred Steps), “La mafia uccide solo d’estate (The Mafia Only Kills in Summer) and most recently, “Anime nere” (Black Souls).\n\nCentamore has an impressive list of credits to his name. He's worked in both film and television, portraying complex characters, some of which seem to border on the line of insanity. When he acts, it's obvious that he wholeheartedly believes in his character. His gaze is penetrating, as you can see in the clip below from \"I cento passi\" with Luigi Lo Cascio, and he sincerely gives a performance that comes straight from the soul. When we began our informal interview a few weeks ago, Centamore at first seemed a man of few words but then his pride and passion for his Sicilian culture took over and he shared some very special cinematic moments with me. He's especially proud of the work he and his colleagues have done through filmmaking to take a stand against organized crime in their regions and communities. My intention was to talk about the numerous David di Donatello nominations and then sweep for “Anime nere” but he had so many other things he wanted to talk about. During our interview, I also learned that he is somewhat of a composer and was nominated for a David di Donatello for his work on Pierfrancesco Diliberto's (Pif) “La mafia uccide solo d’estate”.\n\nJeannine: Tell me about your experience working on “Anime nere”.\n\nDomenico Centamore: Working on “Anime nere” was an extraordinary journey in Calabria. Munzi managed to create a good mix of professional and non-professional actors. He made us recite our lines in Calabrian dialect, and for me it was my first acting experience that was not my dialect. My character, Rosario was a member of the Carbone family. The film shows the stark reality, and unfortunately is the true story of how people in these situations live. The story of “Anime nere” is really a Greek tragedy that takes place within the ‘Ndragheta of Africo, Calabria.\n\nSince you were previously involved in the mafia stories,“I cento passi” and “La mafia uccide solo d’estate”, was it meaningful for you to be involved with another film that speaks of the life-changing effects of the mafia?\n\nI am from Scordia, which is located in the Sicilian province of Catania. However, Sicily and Calabria are similar lands where the gangs have done a lot of damage, as you can see in these films, “Anime nere”, “I cento passi” and “La mafia uccide solo d’estate”. So, it’s really been a privilege to take part in all these projects.\n\nHow do you feel about the success of \"Anime nere\" at the David di Donatello’s?\n\nI didn’t attend the David di Donatello awards show this year. However, I was there last year and had a very beautiful experience as I was a nominee for “Best Original Song” on another great movie, Pif’s film, “La mafia uccide solo d’estate”. I was at the premiere for \"Anime nere\"at the 2014 Venice Film Festival where we received 15 minutes of applause.\n\nTell me about the song you wrote for Pif’s film.\n\nThe name of the song is “Tosami Lady”. It’s a parody of the song by Ivana Spagna, an Italian singer that in the film, was deeply admired by the mafia boss, Bagarella.\n\n(Check out the song below in the closing credits of the film)\n\nYou gave a beautiful, heartfelt performance in “I cento passi” alongside Luigi Lo Cascio. It seemed a very special role for you.\n\nIt was my first film, and remains in my heart for many reasons. The story of Peppino Impastato is heartwarming for Sicilians and he set an example for everyone. We traced his footsteps by shooting in the actual places in Cinisi (the town in which the film was made) where he spent time, and we got to know his mother. So, this character, Peppino, really existed and as we were shooting around town, many people came up to us and told anecdotes about Peppino and the character that I play. It created an extraordinary atmosphere among the actors and we really felt that we were doing something important. It was a unique experience because all the actors, including Luigi Lo Cascio were just starting out. It was also the producer, Fabrizio’s first film and Pif was working as an intern. Every time I see it, I still get emotional.\n\nWhat are the similarities between Pif's \"La mafia uccide solo d'estate\" and Marco Tullio Giordana's \"I cento passi\"?\n\nThemessageis the same. Never forget these people who sacrificed so much for what they believed in.. and we must keep their memory alive.\n\nCentamore is currently working on two television projects. His latest, a role in Rai Uno's \"Il giovane Montalbano\" can be seen in upcoming episodes of the popular Italian series. Then in July and August, check him out in the role of Inspector Cariddi on Rai Uno's \"Lampedusa\", a show about the illegal immigrants that arrive on the Italian island. Lampedusa has become the main entry point for immigrants from Africa. Many never make it because of the dangerous conditions on the boats. The issue has emerged as one of Europe's most serious and controversial topics, so this would be a great show to catch if you're in Italy.\n\n↧\n\nAnna Magnani- Unconventional Cinema Royalty\n\nShe is one of the most revered actresses in the history of cinema and her memory lives on in some of the most influential films of all time.\n\nBorn in Rome in 1908, Anna Magnani became a highly respected Academy Award winning actress, but her beginnings were anything but glamorous. Magnani grew up in poverty. She was raised by her grandmother after her mother left at a young age, and she never knew her father. It was clear before long that Magnani was a natural born performer. She worked her way through Rome's Academy of Dramatic Art by singing in local clubs around Rome and its countryside. Her first role was in a 1920's silent film, but Vittorio De Sica's 1941 film, \"Teresa Venerdì\" was the first to earn her critical acclaim. Four years later came her breakout role in Roberto Rossellini's 1945 classic, \"Rome, Open City\". The movie broke new ground, being the first work of the neorealistic era of filmmaking and put Anna Magnani on international radar and paved the way for a prolific career in film that would last right up until the end of her life in 1973.\n\nMagnani won an Academy Award in 1955 for her role as Serafina Delle Rose played opposite Burt Lancaster in Tennessee Williams' screen version of \"The Rose Tattoo\". Magnani was known for her realistic portraits of salt of the earth characters who faced hard economic and social times in a post-war world. She gave strong, passionate personalities to each character that she portrayed and made each one come alive and light up with screen through her vast talent and empathy. Although she is considered cinema royalty, she was never one to embrace they lifestyle of a movie star. She is quoted as saying, \"I hate respectability. Give me the life of the streets, of common people.\" There is no doubt, however, that she was indeed respected not only by her fans and critics, but by her peers as well. Magnani worked with some of the most talented filmmakers of her time including Marlon Brando, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Alberto Lattuada, Federico Fellini, Roberto Rossellini, Eduardo De Filippo, Luchino Visconti and Vittorio De Sica, all of whom are now considered legends in cinema.\n\nShe gave so many incredible performances but if I had to pick my favorite, it would be her role in \"Mamma Roma\". This 1962 masterpiece by Pier Paolo Pasolini is by far my favorite Anna Magnani film, and is filled with exquisite beauty and tragic sadness. It's the story of a mother trapped in a world of prostitution as she tries to support her son and give him the things she never had. Magnani owns every scene, all of which are set against the social economic landscape of the early 60's. You cannot help but pull for her as she tries so desperately to escape the world that she just can't leave behind. Her beloved son gets mixed up with the wrong crowd and reaches out to her only to find that it's too late. The outstanding performances by Anna Magnani and Ettore Garofolo, who plays her son, will make you laugh one minute and cry the next.\n\nBecause of her international success and the success of the filmmakers with whom she collaborated, many of her films are easily attainable today giving new generations the opportunity to enjoy her timeless and enormous talent.\n\n↧\n\nModel/Actress Anna Falchi\n\nAnna Falchi was born Anna Kristiina Palomaki, on April 22, 1972, inTampere, Finland. Her mother, Kaarina Palomaki Sisko, is Finnish, while her father, Benito \"Tito\" Falchi, is from Romagna, Italy. Growing up in Italy, Anna was a tomboy, and had a fervent imagination. She is known mostly for her prolific career in modelling. However, she tried her hand at acting and landed a role in one of my favorite Italian comedies, \"Nessun messaggio in segreteria\". I consider it my one of my favorites because it brought together so many amazing, talented filmmakers during a time when they were all just starting out. Those filmmakers, Pierfrancesco Favino, Valerio Mastandrea, Luca Miniero and Paolo Genovese are now huge names in contemporary Italian cinema, so it's great to look back and see their work in a low-profile film completely different from the bigger-budget stardom they now know.Watch the trailer.\n\nAnna Falchi started her career as a model. She first appeared on TV in a commercial for an Italian bank in 1992. The ad starred Paolo Villaggio, and was actually directed by Federico Fellini. This helped her launch a film career, starting with \"Nel continente nero\" (On the Dark Continent) in 1993. She appeared in a number of films since, including the 1994 fantasy movie \"Desideria e l'Anello del Drago\" and then more recently in the comedy \"Nessun messaggio in segreteria\". She has also been a popular television personality, hosting various specials on Italian TV.She is less known in the English speaking world. Some fans of the horror comic Dylan Dog, know her as the lead female in a film adaptation called \"Dellamorte Dellamore\", which was released in the U.S.as \"Cemetery Man\".\n\nI caught up with Anna while she was in New York. We talked about her diverse background and what it was like working with two cinema greats, Federico Fellini and Pierfrancesco Favino.\n\nWhat was it like growing up in two cultures, with your mother from Finland and your father from Italy?\n\nIt was beautiful. I grew up in northern Italy, in Rimini. My parents were teachers, so it was never expected that I would become an actress. But they've always been very supportive. My brother is a producer and we have our own production company. So, it's great to work with him. I like producing because I enjoy helping young actors and actresses, and giving them the opportunity to work. Also, I don't always want to be on camera.\n\nWhen did you start working as a model?\n\nI started modeling when I was 14 years old. I would just do it on weekends. It was good for me because when I was a child, my family used to move a lot, so I was always changing schools and houses. Modeling gave me the opportunity to work and meet people, so there was no chance to be lonely.\n\nTell me about your first on-camera job, and working with Federico Fellini.\n\nI spent 10 days working with Fellni on a commercial for a bank. It was shot in Rimini, so it was great to be home. He was very sweet. When he directed me, he told me to just be myself. He said that he wanted to work with me again, but sadly he died shortly after.\n\nWhat it was like to work with Pierfrancesco Favino on \"Nessun messaggio in segreteria\"?\n\nIt was great to work with Pierfrancesco. He usually plays hard roles, but in this film, he was a little shy and funny. I really enjoyed working with him. I liked my character because she was not only a dancer, she had a big heart and also struggled with loneliness.\n\nWhat do you think of Italian cinema today and roles that are being offered to women?\n\nWell, we are not very international because we produce inexpensive movies. We have a few big directors who are successful outside of Italy, like Gabrielle Salvatores and Gabrielle Muccino. The starring roles usually go to men with supporting roles going to women. I think it's because younger people go to see movies and they prefer younger stories, not a woman's story.\n\nThose tides are changing with a whole new crop of strong female directors and actresses like Laura Bispuri, Anna Foglietta and Paola Cortellesi, just to name a few. These days, Anna Falchi is laying low and embracing her newest adventure in motherhood. Now 43-years-old, she’s an outspoken advocate of health and fitness, and recently made a Red Carpet appearance in support of Rome’s new sports arena,Mondo Fitness.\n\n↧\n\nCatching Up with Neapolitan Artist, Musician and Filmmaker- RiccardoZinna\n\nBorn in Naples in 1958, Riccardo Zinna truly is a jack of all trades. He's a natural born artist who does it all. He's an actor, musician and visual artist with no formal training. Yet, he has risen to the top of his game in each of his artistic fields. He credits his mother's passion for life and her support and confidence in him to live his life freely and do what makes him happy.\n\nZinna is best known in Italy as a television and film star. He has done many supporting roles in high profile films such as Gabriele Salvatores' thriller, \"Io non ho paura\" and Nanni Morretti's, \"Caro diario.\" However, he’s proven that he can carry the lead role as well. He did so with great success in Toni D'Angelo's 2008 breakout hit, \"Una Notte.\" The film follows a group of old friends who were brought together by the sudden death of one of their comrades. Zinna takes on the role of a musician who gave up on his dream for a more realistic career in finance. He rediscovers his passion for music after spending a night traveling the streets of Naples with his beloved old friends and an eccentric taxi driver played by the director’s iconic father and Neapolitan crooner, Nino D'Angelo.\n\nRead my interview with Toni D'Angelo\n\nIn addition to film, he has been a key player in an elite group of Neapolitan artists who go between cinema, television and theatre. That group includes what I like to call, maestros in the making; Silvio Orlando, Toni Servillo, Paolo Sorrentino and of course, Riccardo Zinna. These filmmakers, full of Neapolitan pride, have taken the stories and landscapes from their historic homeland and transmitted them throughout the world through their passion and their art.\n\nRiccardo and moi at his art exhibit in Rome\n\nI spoke with Riccardo Zinna about his career and the famous Neapolitans with whom he collaborates.\n\nIt seems that you have been acting nearly all of your life. Have you always felt that your destiny was to be an actor?\n\nAbsolutely not! When I was 16 years old, I was in a band where I sang and played guitar. Silvio Orlando, who went on to become a famous actor in Italy, was also in the group. He played the flute. From there, we took part in a theatre production under the direction of maestro, Roberto De Simone, writer and director of the now legendary production, \"La gatta cenerentola”. After that experience, I became busy with theatre and founded a company in the 70's that collaborated on productions with other companies in the community. So everything just fell into place.\n\nRead my interview with Silvio Orlando.\n\nHave your Neapolitan origins influenced your work as an artist?\n\nYes, Naples has definitely influenced my work as an artist. It's a magical city, rich with inspiration. Life is sometimes difficult in Naples, but it has a unique vitality that really cannot be found anywhere else in the world.\n\nVideo Clip from \"Nessun messaggio in segreteria\" - Scene with Pierfrancsco Favino\n\nTell me about your experience working on \"Una Notte\". What was it like working with someone as experienced as Nino D’Angelo while also working with his son Toni, who is a new filmmaker?\n\nIt was such a joy to work on this film. It took about a month to shoot, and to go through Naples at night for four weeks, is already an experience in itself! (Even if most travel agencies would not advise it!) Then if you have a taxi driver named Nino D'Angelo driving you around, it becomes an exceptional experience! Nino D'Angelo adores Naples and to spend time driving around with him at night really heightened the experienced and showed Naples for the amazing place that it is. Perhaps because it's an independent film, there was a perfect harmony between cast and crew, something rarely found on the set of bigger productions. The crew faced many challenges in making this smaller production reach the standards requiring it to be viewed in a competitive arena with other big budget movies. It ended up being a huge success and has been recognized all over the world. The film's success can be attributed to the director's passion, enthusiasm and determination to tell this story and turn his dream into a reality. With a low budget film like this, it was interesting to see the creative process take over where the expensive technical equipment couldn't otherwise provide. It's a combination of the atmosphere on the set, the beautiful city of Naples, the intensity of the subject matter and the great company of the cast and crew that makes me feel privileged to have worked on this film.\n\nTell me about your experience working with another one of your Neapolitan counterparts, Toni Servillo.\n\nIn one half of its 90 years, I have participated in the show \"Zingari\" by Raffaele Viviani under the direction of Toni Servillo. We took part in a major tour, which brought us all over Italy and Europe. It was an interesting experience to work with such a talented director and cast. Toni is a highly respected actor and director with a deep respect for his profession. He has a clear vision of what he wants to achieve through cinema, and he obtains those goals through hard work. He is always studying his craft.\n\nYou've also built a name for yourself in the music industry. How long have you been playing? Do you usually play professionally, or is it a hobby for you?\n\nI have always been involved in music. I started playing guitar when I was 12 years old. Then I started to play the trumpet. I never intended to make a profession out of it, but through the years, I have composed music for theatre productions and radio broadcasts. Recently, I did the soundtrack for Toni D'Angelo's latest film, which was in competition at last year's Venice Film Festival. The film is a documentary about poets living and working in Rome.\n\nYou're also a visual artist... When did you begin to paint\n\nWhen I was a teenager in high school, I took some art classes but it's only been within the last 10 years that I picked up a paint brush and started to paint again. It's something that I really enjoy.\n\nAre there any artists (visual, film or music) that have influenced your work?\n\nWell, I imagine that everything that I've gone through in life, all of the experiences that I've had are reflected in my work. However, I recently saw something on You Tube that really moved me. It was an old film choreographed by Pina Bausch for \"The Man I Love\" by Gershwin. It's just fantastic!\n\nAre there any filmmakers that you'd still like to work with?\n\nYes, there are many, such as Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Aki Kaurismaky, Emir Kusturica, Kim Ki Duk, Milos Forman and Pedro Almodóvar.. just to name a few!\n\nRiccardo Zinna has already achieved so much in his life and career as an artist, but he's just getting started. He continues to paint, compose music and explore his Neapolitan roots in film and theatre. Many of Zinna’s films are available for purchase through Amazon, including \"Benvenuti al Sud\", \"Io non ho paura\" and \"Caro diario\".\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nDormiveglia Mediterraneo- Workshop in Sicilia con Antonello Faretta\n\nA fine luglio Antonello Faretta terrà un workshop nella Pinacoteca di Capo d’Orlando in Sicilia nell’ambito dell’Atelier delle Arti e del Cinema di Ricerca di Nomadica.\n\nIl titolo sarà Dormiveglia Mediterraneo, Immagini per mettersi a Riparo.

This was announced at the first ever Fred at School “Building New Audiences for European Cinema” conference, held in London on 2 July. The other nominees, shortlisted from the European Parliament’s LUX Prize competition, were Olivier Masset-Depasse’s Illegal, Filippos Tsitos’ Akadimia Platonos Gabriela Pichler’s Eat Sleep Die. Shun Li co-writer Marco Pettenello was present to acknowledge the honor, and in his remarks he lauded the short-listing of a Greek film and said that Greece belongs in the European Union.\n\nShun Li works in a textile factory in the outskirts of Rome, in order to get her papers and enable her eight-year-old son to come to Italy. She is suddenly transferred to Chioggia, a small city-island in the Veneto lagoon, to work as a bartender in a pub. Bepi, a Slavic fisherman, nicknamed “the Poet” by his friends, has been a regular at that little pub for years. The friendship between Shun Li and Bepi upsets both the Chinese and local communities, who interfere with this new voyage, which they are perhaps simply too afraid of.\n\nFred at School is an educational audience development project supported by the European Union’s Creative Europe programme and presented by Fred Film Radio to raise awareness of European films and culture among young people. This year, students with a mean age of 15, from schools in the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Croatia, Romania and Iceland, participated. It is an inclusive project with films made accessible to visually and hearing-impaired audiences, and the films selected were age-appropriate and with subject matter relating to issues of European citizenship.\n\n↧\n\nCinema Greats- Giuseppe Rotunno and Franco Zeffirelli honored this week\n\nThe beauty about Italian cinema is that its past continues to flourish while new filmmakers emerge creating their own masterpieces and future classics. When I talk to the contemporary filmmakers, they always give credit to their predecessors, acknowledging and respecting the foundation those maestros painstakingly built.\n\nThis weekend, two beautiful stories have come out of Italy, paying tribute to two icons of the past.. and the really special part of this is that both filmmakers are still living and very involved with the new generation of Italian filmmakers.\n\nThe 2015 Masters of Light at TDC is celebrating legendary cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunnowith screenings of five of his films \"illustrating his artistry and genius\" .. and the announcement of a museum dedicated to the work of Franco Zeffirelli was just made in his hometown of Florence.\n\nGiuseppe Rotunno\n\nRotunno is oneof the most prominent cinematographers of all time. Throughout the decades, he has collaborated on great masterpieces of cinema alongside directors such as Federico Fellini, Mario Monicelli, Luchino Visconti and Terry Gilliam. His debut in film dates back to 1943, as a camera assistant on L’uomo dalla Croce by Roberto Rossellini. In 1956, his debut as a cinematographer working alongside director CarmineGallone on Tosca (1956), Le notti bianche (1956) by Luchino Visconti and Montecarlo (1956) by Sam Taylor.\n\nAt the end of the 50s, Rotunno shootsLa grande guerra (1959) by Mario Monicelli and Policarpo, official writing (1959) by Mario Soldati, for which he’s awarded, respectively, with Best B&W Cinematography and BestColor Cinematography at the 1960 Silver Ribbon Awards.\n\nIn the 60s, signature large films like Rocco e i suoi fratelli (1960) byLuchino Visconti, for which he won the Silver Ribbon for BestB&W Cinematography. Again with Luchino Visconti, he shot an episode of Boccaccio‘70 (1962), Il Gattopardo (1963), winner of the Silver Ribbon for BestColor Cinematography, and Lo straniero (1967). In those years, he also worked with Vittorio de Sica on Ieri, oggi, domani (1963), John Huston on TheBible (1966), that earned him a Gold Plaque for BestCinematography at the David di Donatello, and started his collaboration with Federico Fellini on Toby Dammit (1968), followed by Satyricon (1969), for which Rotunno won another Silver Ribbon Award for BestColor Cinematography.\n\nThe collaboration with Fellini continued on Roma (1972), Amarcord (1973), Casanova (1976), Prova d’orchestra (1978), La città delle donne (1980) and E la nave va (1983), the being the latter awared both at the Silver Ribbon and David di Donatello for BestCinematography.\n\nRotunno also served as cinematographer for Julia & Julia (directed by Peter Del Monte, 1987), the first feature shot using high definition television taping techniques, then transferred to 35mm film for theatrical release.\n\nWith All That Jazz (1979) by Bob Fosse, Giuseppe Rotunno earned an Oscar nomination for BestCinematography and won a BAFTA Award.\n\nIn 1999, Rotunno’s extraordinary achievements in the art and craft of cinematography were underlined by three prestigious awards: a Golden Globe Career Award, a Golden Frog Award for Lifetime Achievement at Camerimage (1999), and the International Achievement Award from the ASC – American Society of Cinematographers (1999).\n\nFor 20 years, Giuseppe Rotunno has been the Head of Cinematography at theCentro Sperimentale di Cinematografia– Italy’s national film school, influencing new generations of Italian cinematographers through his unique and charismatic method.\n\nIn 1966, Giuseppe Rotunno was the first non-American cinematographer admitted to the ASC – American Society of Cinematographers. He has also served as President of AIC – the Italian Society of Cinematographers, of which he has been nominated Honorary Member in 2014.\n\nFranco Zeffirelli\n\nFranco Zeffirelli was bornGianfranco Corsi on February 12, 1923 in Florence. He is a prolific filmmaker, who has worked as director, designer and producer of opera, theater, film and television. He is revered for his \"authentic details and grand scale\" of his opera productions and film adaptations of Shakespeare.\n\nZeffirelli attended the University of Florence to study architecture, but while there he became involved with the university’s theatre company. His studies were interrupted by Germany’s occupation of Italy, and he became a Partisan, serving as an interpreter for the Scots Guard. When the war was over, he went to Rome to pursue a career in theatre.\n\nn 1946, he joined Luchino Visconti’s Morelli-Stoppa Company as an actor and stage director. After working with Visconti on La terra trema (1948; The Earth Trembles) and other films, Zeffirelli began to concentrate on stage design. His first major design for opera was a production (1952–53) of Gioachino Rossini’s L’Italiana in Algeri for La Scala, Milan. He worked on a number of other opera and theatre productions—including the operas La traviata, Lucia di Lammermoor, La Bohème, Tosca, Falstaff, and Carmen—from the 1950s through the beginning of the 21st century. He also began to direct films. Among his major films are three Shakespeare adaptations: a richly produced The Taming of the Shrew (1967), with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor; Romeo and Juliet (1968), in which he for the first time featured teenage actors in the title roles; and Hamlet (1990), with Mel Gibson. His later films include Jane Eyre (1996), Tea with Mussolini (1999), and Callas Forever (2002). He continued to film operas such as I Pagliacci (1981), Cavalleria rusticana (1982), Otello (1986), and La Bohème (2008), working in several roles, including director, producer and costume designer.\n\nWe will keep you updated on the progress of the museum dedicated to Zefferelli.\n\nSources-www.terradicinema.comandwww.britannica.com\n\n↧\n\nVittorio De Sica- Father of the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film\n\nFrom 1917 right up until his untimely death in 1974, Vittorio De Sica worked non-stop to become one of the most prolific filmmakers of our time. With nearly 200 films to his credit, including beloved classics like, “The Bicycle Thieves” and “Two Women”, Vittorio De Sica created timeless portraits of characters struggling to survive in the darkest of days.\n\nLike the common theme in many of his films, De Sica grew up with the bare minimum. Born into poverty in 1901 in the town of Sora, a picturesque village situated along the banks of the Liri river near the Simbruini Mountains in Lazio, De Sica lived in a town stricken with hardship. Perhaps that is why he was a leading force in the Neorealism movement; a film movement which was born out of the necessity to make films with very little resources in the wake of World War II.\n\nMy blog on how Neorealism influences today's Italian filmmakers\n\nLiri River waterfall\n\nIn his films, De Sica’s characters search for hope and beauty among desolation. Perhaps he drew from his own experience growing up in such a beautiful place, which includes Sora’s neighboring commune, Isola del Liri, a charming island, which houses two famous waterfalls; visual muses for artists throughout time. De Sica grew up with nothing among this beautiful landscape in which he prospered as an artist, and adapted that experience and message for his neorealist films.\n\nDe Sica began his film career in 1917 with a part in Alfredo De Antoni’s silent adventure film, “Il processo Clémenceau” (The Clemenceau Affair). Shortly thereafter, he began a successful stint in theater, in which his dashing looks made him a local stage idol. De Sica enjoyed both stage and screen, appearing in both art forms throughout the 1920’s. The next decade would go on to really launch his career. In 1932, he made his “talkie” film debut in “La Vecchia Signora” and at the same time, he and his first wife, Giuditta Rissone founded their own theater company along with fellow actor and playwright, Sergio Tofano. The company prospered, specializing in comedies, but also featured the work of big-name directors like Luchino Visconti. Meanwhile, his film career was flourishing and he was making a name for himself as a respected comedy actor.\n\nDe Sica is responsible for making Italian Cinema a front runner at the Academy Awards. During his golden years, six of De Sica’s films were praised by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nThe first of those was his 1946 neorealist film, “Sciuscià” (Shoeshine) in which he stepped behind the camera to direct. The film played a pivotal role in the international acclaim that Italian cinema would go to achieve. “Sciuscià” (see video clip) is the story of two friends, Giuseppe and Pasquale who test-ride horses and dream of owning one themselves. They work on the streets of Rome as shoeshine boys in the depressed economy of Post-War Italy. The boys become the scapegoats of a complex theft and their lives are destroyed. The story is a heartbreaking testament to the financial distress Italians faced in the wake of World War II. The film received an Honorary Award at the Oscars and was the inspiration behind the category of the award for Best Foreign Film as it was the first foreign film to be acknowledged by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nTwo years later, De Sica made “Ladri di biciclette” (The Bicycle Theif). The film is truly one of the masterpieces of Italian cinema, and of cinema as a whole. “Ladri di biciclette” is the story of a Roman family struggling to survive on the streets of Rome, again in the wake of World War II. Antonio Ricci, played by Lamberto Maggiorani is desperately searching to support his family of four. When he is offered a position posting advertisements around the city, he tells his wife that he has to decline because he needs a bike and obviously cannot afford to buy one. She is so happy that he has finally been offered a job, she pawns all her bed sheets and humble valuables to raise the money for the bike. The two are so ecstatic; they enjoy a beautiful victory ride home, her on the handlebars rejoicing their new life. Then on the first day of work, Antonio’s bike is stolen. What follows is a portrait of desperation and the lengths a father and young son will go to find justice. The film also won an Honorary Award at the Oscar’s and to this day, is considered one of the classic films of all-time.\n\n\"Umberto D\", De Sica's 1952 neorealist film and heart wrenching story of an elderly man and his dog struggling to survive on his pension, earned an Oscar nomination for its screenplay by Cesare Zavattini.\n\n\"Sciuscià\" and \"Ladri di biciclette” were awarded honorary Oscars, while De Sica's 1963, \"Ieri, oggi, domani\" and his 1971, \"Il giardino dei Finzi Contini\" won the official awards for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nAnd speaking of \"Ieri, oggi, domani\", which starred Sophia Loren, the two proved to be a match made in Oscar heaven, and made that adorable \"striptease\" scene infamous (See video clip). Three of their films received nominations or the prized trophy. The other two films were De Sica's 1960 \"La Ciociara\" (Two Women) which earned Loren an Oscar for Best Actress, making her the first actor to be awarded the honor for a performance in a foreign film; and De Sica's 1964, \"Matrimonio all'italiana\" (Marriage Italian-Style), which earned two nominations for Best Foreign Film and Best Actress.\n\nDe Sica's personal life didn't go quite as well as his professional life. He was known to be a gambler, many times losing big and in turn taking on less-interesting projects just to ease the financial pressure. He did, however, leave a cinematic heir. In 1951, De Sica’s second wife, Spanish actress Maria Mercader, gave birth to their son, Christian, who would go on to follow in his father’s footsteps. Christian De Sica planted his performing roots in music but fate took over and he has since become a celebrated comic actor and director known for his hilarious sketches of Roman characters and infamous Cinepanettone Christmas comedies. He is absolutely adored by audiences in Italy. He is married to the sister of fellow actor/director, Carlo Verdone.\n\nVittorio De Sica’s legacy lives on the masterpieces he created, and the unique way in which he documented a difficult time in Italy's history through his neorealist films. Fortunately, many of his films are readily available.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nBasilicata: Terra di Cinema- Interview with Patchanka Soledada Frontman\n\nAs part of my series, \"Basilicata: Terra di Cinema, I am revisiting an article that I wrote for Chicago's Fra Noi Magazine back in 2007. It was inspired by a music video by the music group, Patchanka Soledada.\n\nI've written often about the new generation of Italian filmmakers who take their cameras to the streets and offer a real perspective on everyday Italian life. Well, I discovered a wonderful film in which a group of artists have done just that.\n\nMusicians turned filmmakers. It’s indie filmmaking at its finest and now it has brought to light one Basilicata town via the internet. Matera-based music group, Patchanka Soledada has created a short film to showcase their song, La più bella del mondo. The clip, which features a local couple walking around the ancient Italian town, has been watched by thousands and has brought international attention to the group and the beautiful scenic town in which they live. The uniqueness of the film can be found in the musical instruments that play a direct role in everything the couple does from driving in the car to eating at the local pizzeria to strolling along the promenade. The band used local Matera eateries, Ristorante Stano and Pizzeria Il Rugantino to give the video an authentic feel that transports you right to southern Italy. I spoke with the lead singer of the group, Nicola Petrillo, whose stage name is Pedro Wadada. He told me about the making of the film, the symbolism of the instruments and how his southern Italian town inspires the band’s work.\n\nFirst, tell me about Patchanka Soledada.\n\nPatchanka Soledada's music is upbeat, thoughtful and intense. But at the same time, it’s amusing and funny. It’s a mixture of sounds and colors that give our band an indefinable sound. From reggae to ska to rocksteady, we use several sounds to express every mood.\n\nWhat is the concept behind your short film and the reason you chose to use instruments in the scenes with the actors?\n\nWith the help of some friends, we took on the huge challenge of making a music video. With the director, Giancarlo Fontana, and our executive producers at Bluvideo, we recruited local actors. The idea, born from one of my suggestions, was to launch the message that life is music, music is love and love is life in a continuous circle without limits. The instruments are in the hands of common people because in a way, each one of us plays something. In everything people do, they are playing music. So, this big world we live in is just made of notes. There are still multifaceted unsolved meanings to the film and I’m very happy that many people are trying to give their own meaning to it. I believe that this is the magic of art: each person can read into it and relate to it in their own way.\n\nDoes the beauty and charm of Matera play a role in your work?\n\nOf course! Starting from our town Matera and including our entire region, our landscapes resonate a huge potential in ourselves. Our work shows the territory, its beauty, its hidden treasures, its possibilities…as well as its contradictions and problems. It couldn’t be different. In this area, you can live a life still linked to the land, where years of history are visible wherever you look. The peace, the slow pace of life and the tranquility inspire us. But words don’t do these places justice. You can just live them. You can sip a glass of Aglianico, but in words, it has no flavor.\n\nWhat is your dream?\n\nMy dream is to live the music without ever getting bored of it, without big ambitions or unattainable dreams, without insincerity or false modesty. I would like simply to wake up in the morning and be sure that my role in this world is to be a musician!\n\nAnd whether he knows it, this musician is also a talented filmmaker. Eight years later, the band is still together. Check them out on Facebook or go to the band’s website at www.patchankasoledada.com.\n\n↧\n\nItalian Independent Film Channel Launched\n\nThe best works from the most important international festivals, which until now, have not been granted a place on the mainstream circuits, can be seen on Indiefilmchannel.tv. The first online Italian video-on-demand platform of its kind is dedicated solely to independent films. Cineuropa.com is reporting that the new indie channel boasts a catalogue of over 1,000 titles, split into ten categories from animation to horror, and encompassing short films, documentaries and features\n\nAll of the portal’s features can also be accessed via a smartphone or tablet, which means that independent cinema is available in pocket-sized format on all iOS and Android device.\n\nThis innovative platform’s offering is now being enriched by the addition of 20 new titles from the library of Istituto Luce Cinecittà, one of the key players in the film sector, which, like Indiefilmchannel, is committed to fostering Italian cinema, both within Italy and abroad.\n\nAmong the new titles that are available to view are Good Morning Aman by Claudio Noce, his feature debut; L'estate sta finendo, the second feature by Stefano Tummolini; Angosto, the first film by Jorge Sánchez-Cabezudo; and Small Homeland by Alessandro Rossetto, one of the most highly regarded names in Italian documentary – this, his debut feature, was presented at the Venice Film Festival in the Horizons section, as well as at the Rotterdam and Copenhagen International Film Festivals.\n\nOf note in the documentary section are Fuoristrada by Elisa Amoruso, an examination of transsexuality through the trials and tribulations of a family that appears to be unconventional only on the surface, presented at the most recent Rome Film Festival, and The Last Shepherd by Marco Bonfanti, which was presented at 70 festivals the world over. These are joined by Musica cubana by German Kral, a pupil of Wim Wenders’, who acted as a producer on this title; Beat Paradeby Luigi and Corrado Rizza, which is a depiction of Italy in the 1960s, along with its music and the lifestyle of that era; and Terramatta by Costanza Quatriglio, one of the most highly awarded documentary films of the last few years.\n\n↧\n\nThe Infinite bellezza of Gina Lollobrigida\n\nShe has been called the most beautiful woman in the world and at 88 years old, she is still a sight to behold as all that outer beauty mirrors the talent and inner beauty of this true, complete artist.\n\nGina Lollobrigida, the iconic actress, the photojournalist and the sculptress, was born Luigina Lollobrigida on the 4th of July, 1932 in Subiaco, Italy, a town located in the Province of Rome, near the picturesque tourist destination of Tivoli. Adored by audiences on both sides of the Atlantic, Lollobrigida has worked with some of the biggest names in Hollywood including Humphrey Bogart, Rock Hudson, Frank Sinatra, Anthony Quinn and Shelly Winters. She acted opposite Bob Hope in his 1968 comedy, \"The Private Navy of Sgt. O'Farrell\" and even joined him on one of his many visits to the military troops overseas.\n\nLike many of her Italian screen siren counterparts, Lollobrigida got her start in local beauty contests and from there went into modeling before trying her hand at acting. In 1946, she made her onscreen debut with a small role in Riccardo Freda's \"Aquila Nera\" (Return of the Black Eagle) which starred Italy's beloved Gino Cervi. After that, it was one film after another for Lollobrigida. Then in 1953, she made her Hollywood debut in John Huston's, \"Beat the Devil\" with Humphrey Bogart and Jennifer Jones. Her role as Maria Dannreuther caught the attention of American audiences and she became an instant Hollywood star.\n\nJust two years later, she was nicknamed, \"The Most Beautiful Woman in the World\", with the release of her trademark movie, \"La donna più bella del mondo\" (Beautiful But Dangerous), in which she played the infamous role of Lina Cavalieri, the Italian peasant who becomes a world-renowned opera singer. She costarred with the equally iconic Vittorio Gassman and Robert Alda. Lollogrigida actually did her own singing in this film while maestro, Mario Bava, created a rich feast for our eyes with his decadent cinematography.\n\nGina Lollobrigida went on to appear in a whirlwind of hit films including Carol Reed's circus drama, \"Trapeze\" with Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis in 1956 and also that year, starred in Jean Delannoy's \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" with Anthony Quinn. In 1959 she co-starred with A-listers Frank Sinatra, Steve McQueen, Peter Lawford and Charles Bronson in the warfare drama, \"Never So Few\". She worked non-stop throughout the 60's but started to slow down a bit in the 70's and thereafter. She's entertained a number of different projects in the years following her cinematic heyday including politics in which she actually ran for one of Italy's European Parliament seats from her hometown of Subiaco. She pursued her interest photojournalism and shot a number of high profile, interesting subjects including Paul Newman, Salvador Dalí and Fidel Castro.\n\nOne of my favorite films is \"Strange Bedfellows\". In classic slapstick 60's humor, this romantic comedy is hilarious and clever with punchy dialogue and an a-list cast of characters that are just as easy on the eyes as they are delivering their impeccably timed lines. Gina Lollobrigida and Rock Hudson star as a couple who keep trying to get it right despite their differences. Hudson plays the role of Carter Harrison, a smooth talking executive who marries the beautiful, outspoken artist and activist Antonia, played by Lollobrigida. Although the two are crazy about each other, they are forever bickering and the marriage ends up falling apart. Then after a number of years, they find each other again and pick up where they left off. The script is witty, the performances are memorable, the styles are trendy of the era and the story is a timeless tale of love and humor. It is available through Amazon.\n\nIn her latest creative adventure, she has become a talented sculptress, creating larger than life figures in her Roman studio. Many of her works possess a quality that seems to be in motion, like they are dancing as their thin fabrics flow in the wind. Perhaps that quality represents the free spirit that Lollobrigida has always had as she took the world by storm. In an interview with \"Parade\" magazine, she elaborated on her skills as an artist. \"I studied painting and sculpting at school and became an actress by mistake.\" However, many would argue that her acting was a mistake.\n\nSculpture, “Living Together” for the 1992 Seville World's Fair\n\nGina Lollobrigida is forever emblazoned in the hearts of admirers all over the world and we are still enjoying the eternal talents of this classic symbol of grace and style as her zest for life continues to this day.\n\nThanks to Lollobrigida's vast international success, many of her films are still available today. Amazon is a great source that has currently carries a wide range of her films. You can also visit her online at www.ginalollobrigida.com.\n\n↧\n\n\"Braccialetti Rossi\" at L'Isola del Cinema in Rome\n\nOn Monday, July 13th, L'Isola del Cinema will celebrate one of Italy's biggest pop culture sensations- \"Braccialetti rossi\" (Red Bracelets). The television series began in January of 2014 and has become a favorite among Italian teenagers. When I interviewed actress, Anna Ferruzzo back in March, she gave me her thoughts on why the show has become so popular, explaining that the show is \"the Italian version of the Spanish television series \"Poiseres Vermelles\" inspired by the true story of the Spanish writer Albert Espinosa. The series tells the stories of a group of young patients in a cancer hospital. Their friendship and love will help them to face and overcome the tragedy of disease and death. In this series, I play the hospital psychologist. The success of \"Red Bracelets\" was surprising especially among the young. Before this series, no one on Italian television dared to talk about these important and uncomfortable issues of illness and death of young people and children. \"Red Bracelets\" has instead shown that you can tell any story, even the most difficult, as long as you face it with grace, respect and truth.\"\n\nTraduzione in Italiano..\n\nRaccontami \"Braccialetti Rossi\". La serie non è conosciuto in America, ma sembra essere molto popolare in Italia. Qual è il tuo ruolo in questa serie?\n\n\"Braccialetti Rossi\"è la versione italiana della serie televisiva spagnola\"Poiseres Vermelles\"ispirata alla storia vera dello scrittore spagnolo Albert Espinosa. La serie racconta le storie di un gruppo di giovanissimi pazienti in un ospedale oncologico. L'amicizia e l'amore li aiuterà ad affrontare e a superare il dramma della malattia e della morte. In questa serie io interpreto la psicologa dell'ospedale. Il successo di \"Braccialetti Rossi\"è stato sorprendente soprattutto tra i giovanissimi. Prima di questa serie nessuno,nella televisione italiana,aveva osato raccontare temi così importanti e scomodi come la malattia e la morte di giovani e bambini.\"Braccialetti Rossi\"ha invece dimostrato che è possibile raccontare qualunque storia,anche la più difficile, purchè lo si faccia con garbo,rispetto e verità.\n\nThe event will begin at 7:00 pm with a photo op for attendees and cast members. A screening of the first episode will begin at 9:00 pm. During the evening, 600 red bracelets will be given away.

A new call for tenders worth €10 million, made possible by EU funds, to attract international film productions and encourage European co-productions, will be launched by the Lazio Region at the MIA, the International Audiovisual Market, which will be held from 16 to 20 October during the Rome Film Festival. It was announced by the President of the Region, Nicola Zingaretti, during the presentation, last Friday, of the revamped Roman Market: “With MIA we will see a significant improvement in quality. Too often in the past the system has been overly disjointed”, stated Zingaretti, announcing that a second call for tenders, worth €2 million, “will be aimed at investment in new technologies in production, to structurally reinforce companies”.\n\nAnd it is exactly at a new system of synergies and collaboration between institutions and operators that MIA is aimed. The one-of-a-kind platform, that will bring together films, TV series, video games and documentaries (see news article), was spearheaded by Fondazione Cinema per Roma, Anica, the Associazione Produttori televisivi (Apt) and Doc/it, backed by the Ministry for Economic Development, and promoted by the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism, with the cooperation of the Roma Lazio Film Commission. Guiding the Market, which will be held in the original Roman location of the Baths of Diocletian and the nearby Hotel Boscolo Exedra, will be thirty-nine-year-old Lucia Milazzotto, who used to be Manager of the New Cinema Network, the co-production market of the Rome Film Festival: “MIA is an extraordinary collective operation that channels exceptional expertise for reaching ambitious objectives, above all the internationalisation of the Italian audiovisual industry as a whole so that it once again holds sway on the global stage”.\n\n“The film sector is an industrial sector to all intents and purposes, so we are investing with conviction in making it international”, confirmed Carlo Calenda, the Italian Vice Minister for Economic Development who is funding the market with one and a half million euros (another €440 thousand is being put up by the associates of the Fondazione, including the Lazio Region, the Istituto Luce - Cinecittà and Rome the Capital). “This is why the Ministry for Economic Development, as part of a three-year initiative, has already put up funding for next year, and in October the funding for the third year will be set”. Andrea Occhipinti, the President of distributor association ANICA, also supported the extraordinary cooperative spirit of the MIA: “It will be a space in which to plan, develop and co-produce but also to raise awareness of and sell what we have already produced. We decided to hold the market in Rome because Venice, due to when it is held, is in direct competition with Toronto. But events linked to the MIA will also be held at Venice, as at other film festivals”.\n\nIn italiano...\n\nRegione Lazio: in arrivo bando da 10 M€ per le coproduzioni europee\n\nLo ha annunciato il presidente Zingaretti alla presentazione di MIA, il nuovo Mercato Internazionale dell'Audiovisivo che si terrà dal 16 al 20 ottobre durante la Festa del Cinema di Roma.\n\nUn nuovo bando da 10 milioni di euro, finanziato con fondi Ue, per attrarre produzioni cinematografiche internazionali e favorire le coproduzioni europee, sarà lanciato dalla Regione Lazio al MIA, il Mercato Internazionale dell'Audiovisivo che si terrà dal 16 al 20 ottobre nel corso della Festa del Cinema di Roma. Ad annunciarlo è stato il presidente della Regione Nicola Zingaretti nel corso della presentazione, venerdì scorso, del rinnovato Mercato romano: “Con MIA faremo un importante salto di qualità, troppo spesso in passato il sistema ha peccato di disarticolazione”, ha affermato Zingaretti, anticipando anche che un secondo bando, da 2 milioni di euro, “sarà finalizzato all’investimento sulle nuove tecnologie nei sistemi di produzione, mirato al rafforzamento strutturale delle imprese”.\n\nEd è proprio ad un nuovo sistema di sinergie e di collaborazione tra istituzioni e operatori che punta il MIA, una piattaforma unica in cui confluiranno film, serie tv, videogiochi e documentari (leggi la news), voluta da Fondazione Cinema per Roma, Anica, l'Associazione Produttori televisivi (Apt) e Doc/it, sostenuta dal Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico, promossa dal MIBACT, e con la collaborazione della Roma Lazio Film Commission. A guidare il Mercato, le cui attività si terranno tra l’inedita location romana del complesso delle Terme di Diocleziano e il vicino Hotel Boscolo Exedra, sarà la trentanovenne Lucia Milazzotto, già responsabile in passato di New Cinema Network, il mercato di coproduzione del Festival di Roma: “MIA è una straordinaria operazione collettiva che convoglia eccezionali competenze per il raggiungimento di obiettivi ambiziosi, primo fra tutti l’internazionalizzazione dell’intera industria italiana dell’audiovisivo affinché possa tornare ad affermarsi a livello globale”.\n\n“Il cinema è un settore industriale a tutti gli effetti, per questo investiamo con convinzione a favore della sua internazionalizzazione”, ha confermato Carlo Calenda, vice ministro dello Sviluppo Economico che finanzia il Mercato con un milione e mezzo di euro (altri 440 mila euro provengono dai soci della Fondazione, tra cui Regione Lazio, Istituto Luce - Cinecittà e Roma Capitale). “Per questo il MISE, nell'ambito di un intervento triennale, ha già finanziato il contributo per il prossimo anno e a ottobre sarà fissato anche quello per il terzo”. A sostenere lo straordinario spirito cooperativo del MIA, anche Andrea Occhipinti, presidente dei distributori dell'Anica: “Sarà uno spazio per pianificare, sviluppare e coprodurre ma anche far conoscere e vendere ciò che abbiamo già prodotto. Per il mercato si è deciso di puntare su Roma perché Venezia, per una questione di date, è in competizione diretta con Toronto. Ma anche a Venezia, così come in altri festival, ci saranno eventi legati al MIA”.\n\n-Reported by Vittoria Scarpa for Cineuropa\n\n↧\n\nItalian Distributors Bridging Culture Between Europe and North America\n\nRaoul Bova and Sarah Jessica Parker on the set of \"All Roads Lead to Rome\"\n\nAndrea Iervolino and Monika Bacardi are taking the distribution world by storm and bringing a whole new angle of Italian cinema to North America.\n\nIervolino who has been a producer since the age of 16, has produced, financed and distributed over 40 films. A partner and founder of a number different production companies, he is currently, the youngest and most highly regarded Italian entrepreneurs in the world of film-making.\n\nWith his Italian-Canadian origins (his mother is Canadian, his father Italian), after also having worked on different productions and co-productions with some of the country’s major film-makers and having shot no fewer than 8 films in 2011, in October of that same year he founded his own distribution company, Iervolino Entertainment S.p.A, which is now a part of the AMBI PICTURES Group, whose partners are Andrea Iervolino and Monika Bacardi.\n\nAndrea Iervolino has never left out his innate passion for films on powerful social issues and in this regard he is also president of the FCAI, an association that is committed to taking exposé and social commentary films into schools, something made possible thanks to the Cineschoolday initiative, for which Italian Life Senator Giulio Andreotti was a spokesperson in 2011-2012.\n\nIervolino’s latest ventures include “Italian Style Thriller”, which comprises three feature-length films in 3D and a series consisting of eight episodes that will have as their common denominator a genre that in the seventies led to Italy becoming a worldwide point of reference, namely Horror.\n\nIt is through this project that some young Italian directors have had the opportunity to once again bring this genre of movie, which had all but disappeared, back to life in Italy, creating them using present-day directing techniques with a view to venturing once again on the international scene.\n\nAMBI Pictures and Distribution\n\nAndrea Iervolino and Monika Bacardi are partners in AMBI PICTURES, an investment company whose task is to provide financial backing for medium to high-budget international films featuring Hollywood names.
