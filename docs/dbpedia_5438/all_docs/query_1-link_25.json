        "text": "Where it was filmed 'My Friends'\n\n“What is genius? It’s imagination, intuition, decision and rapid execution.”\n\nPerozzi describing Necchi\n\nThe locations of the film show the audience several lesser-known corners of Florence, such as the place that which passes for Bar Necchi in via dei Renai, in the San Niccolò neighbourhood; the four friends play billiards and cards in the bar with its community feel, organize pranks and most importantly identify the perfect victim, Righi. The street where the bar is located is also the setting for the car horn scene at the start of the film where a traffic warden becomes the first victim of their pranks. Righi waits for the four friends in the park near the bar so he can return the drugs, unaware that it is actually sugar.\n\nThe hospital where Sassaroli works is not in Pescia as it is in the film, but the Istituto del Salviatico, in Campo di Marte. The friends will later be patients here after an accident and Mascetti will try to sell his fake leg “already declared valid by the insurance company” on the steps of Chiesa San Lorenzo. Married man, Mascetti has fallen in love with Titti, whose school is in the National Archaeological Museum of Florence, in Piazza della Santissima Annunziata. He walks her home, down Lungarno della Zecca Vecchia and Viale Gramsci, making a strongly felt but ultimately pointless declaration.\n\nOne of their most famous pranks takes place at the Santa Maria Novella train station where the “gypsies” find entertainment in slapping unsuspecting passengers leaning out of train windows. Another takes place in Calcata Vecchia, a borgo perched on a hill of tufa rock near Viterbo, where they alarm the residents by making them think that several buildings are due to be knocked down to make way for motorways and ring roads. One evening, the five friends gate-crash a party at the Castle of Marignolle, west of Florence. The prank they play on Righi involves setting him up as an accomplice to a terrifying gang of drug dealers, fighting the “Marseilles gang” but first he has to survive several trials: when the moment finally comes for him to share in the spoils, his friends stop in what is today the Mandela Forum, a cement building in Campo di Marte and now part of a stadium.\n\nThe film’s epilogue takes place in Piazza Santo Spirito where Perozzi’s funeral is celebrated and where the survivors have no qualms in teasing Righi behind his back.\n\nWhere it was filmed 'My Friends'\n\n“What is genius?
