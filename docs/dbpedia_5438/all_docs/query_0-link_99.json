        "text": "Brief History of the Cenacolo and Its Frescoes The Cenacolo di Sant’Apollonia was the monumental refectory of Observant Benedictine Sisters of Saint Apollonia, founded in 1339. The order grew notably during the course of the 15th century due to series of privileges granted by Pope Eugene IV and the favor of the archbishop of Florence Antonino Pierozzi. The construction of the refectory was part of a large project of reconstruction within the convent, already planned by 1418 but actually begun in the north wing of the nunnery in 1429, that continued throughout the entire 15th century and the first three decades of the century to follow. Andrea del Castagno (1421-1457, pupil of Masaccio) painted the new refectory’s front wall around 1447 with the scene of the Last Supper on the lower part, the Crucifixion, the Entombment and the Resurrection on the upper part. The strict seclusion of the nuns hid the pictorial decoration of the refectory from public view. Thus, it was not mentioned by Vasari or other early sources up to the time of the suppression during the unification of Italy when the nuns (reinstated in 1815 after the Napoleonic suppression) were forced to definitely abandon the convent, the whole complex became state property. Aware of the value of the fresco representing the Last Supper decorating the refectory, the Direction of the Royal Galleries regained possession of rooms that the Military had taken over during the suppression, for the creation of the Museum of Andrea del Castagno, one of the greatest artists of Florentine Renaissance, thus, for the third time, after San Salvi and Fuligno, another Florentine “Last Supper” became a museum.\n\nThe inauguration of the museum, entitled then as now the Cenacolo di Sant’Apollonia, took place on April 1, 1891 in a small room only a third of the size of the actual refectory, the entrance of which, on Via XXVII Aprile, destroyed parts of the ex-convent in the making. (The Museum of Castagno is comprised of three rooms- the entrance, the antechamber and the refectory.)\n\nIn 1953 the frescoes in the upper part were taken down to save the painting which was rapidly deteriorating because of the dampness which had seeped in; on that occasion the wonderful “sinopie” (preparatory drawings) beneath the frescoes were discovered and removed in 1961. Today it is hanging as mirror reflections on the opposite wall.\n\nIconography The decoration of the wall, typically realized in the fresco technique, presents two themes from other Florentine refectories of the 14th century. As in the case of Santa Croce and Santo Spirito, the Last Supper was painted in the lower half, while the Crucifixion was done in the upper half. Both are two very important moments in the story of human redemption: the first represents the promise of salvation, while the other is the fulfillment of the promise through the sacrifice of Christ.\n\nBut in the refectory of Sant’ Apollonia there is an important novelty: the introduction of two other scenes, that is, the Entombment and the Resurrection of Christ. The natural light coming in from the windows on the right-hand side gives more prominence to the scene of the Resurrection, which was placed on the wall on the left-hand side. The presence of this scene completes the religious atmosphere and confers to the entire cycle a scene of deep optimism, which is typical of the 15th century Christian vision, in contrast with the Medieval view characterized by penance and suffering.\n\nStyle The Cenacolo di Sant’Apollonia is the first Renaissance cenacolo in Florence and it stands for a fundamental moment in the history of Florentine painting. The main innovation consists of the expert use of perspective which allowed creating a certain harmony between the lower scene, and the upper scenes placed in a landscape. Each element is seen from below, so to gradually lead the viewer to the scenes above, which create the illusion of being placed farther into the background. Even the colors follow a gradual passage, from gloomy shades in the Last Supper scene to the lighter shades, full of light in the upper scenes, emphasizing the message of salvation. Another significant aspect of Andrea del Castagno’s style is the use of lighting, which substantiates colors and at the same time creates three- dimensionality: a way of painting typical of the Quattrocento painters, like Domenico Veneziano and Piero della Francesca.\n\nThe Last Supper\n\nThe room in which the Last Supper takes place is a well-defined space: we notice the precise shape of the tiles of the slanted roof and the corners of brick walls, which define the grassy area of a surrounding garden that reaches up into the scenes above. All the compositional elements are seen in a shortened view: the square pattern of the floor, the white and black pattern of the ceiling, the windowed wall from which the light filters through and the long table which we can only see in profile. A dramatic atmosphere, underlined by the use of dark colors, envelopes the Apostles reunited around Christ: they are figures drawn with energy and painted in strong contrasts of “chiaroscuro” in order to obtain effects of intense plasticity that can better express the drama of the scene. Their faces and gestures were studied to produce a variety of movements and expressions, but all in all they look static, as if stopped in space. The marble slabs in the background also add to the dramatic atmosphere of the scene, especially the one behind the figure of Christ, with its violent contrast of red and dark colors.\n\nHere Judas sits isolated in the foreground of the picture, disrupting its balance and breaking up the long white strip of tablecloth. The placement of Judah separated from the rest of the apostles is typical of the iconography (although usually is on the right rather than the left of Jesus). He is shown in profile with the face of a satyr: a mythological creature, half-man and half-goat, often used in Renaissance painting to represent evil.\n\np.s. This is a wide rectangular space with wooden coffered ceiling and a series of windows on the right wall. The end wall of the Cenacolo di Sant’Apollonia (9.75 x 9.10 m) was decorated with frescoes by Andrea del Castagno.\n\nThe Crucifixion, the Entombment and the Resurrection\n\nAlthough with some difficulty due to the deterioration of the painting, even the upper scenes convey strong feeling; for example the pain felt by the group of pious women supporting Mary under the Cross, or expressed in the angels’ faces. The three episodes are unified by the landscape, described in a concise but realistic way, with the profile of the hills which, as it has been noticed, reminds us of the landscape of an area near Mount Falterona, where the Arno river has its source.\n\np.s. The great cloister of the Abbess, with two floors, is among the largest of Florence and the ground floor of an elegant colonnade century Ionic order (on three sides) and columns on the upper floor.\n\nToday it is used by the University (on the building’s south side is the canteen of the students).\n\n(http://www.operamedicealaurenziana.org/index.php/en/)\n\nMediceo Laurenziano Complex that includes the Basilica of San Lorenzo with the Old Sacristy, the cloisters and the monumental areas, the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana and the Medici Chapels’ Museum.\n\nPiazza di San Lorenzo\n\nGoing out of the Palazzo Medici Riccardi walking along via de’ Gori you arrive in San Lorenzo Square.\n\nAt the western end of the piazza, near the entrance to San Lorenzo church, there is a statue of Giovanni delle Bande Nere, mercenary and father of Cosimo I, first Medici Grand Duck. It was carved by Baccio Bandinelli in 1540.\n\nThe Basilica The origins of San Lorenzo coincide with the origins of the Christian Community in Florence. According to the tradition, the early Basilica, which was the oldest Florentine Cathedral, was consecrated by St. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, in 393 and was dedicated to the martyr Lorenzo. It was rebuilt in the Romanesque period, and re-consecrated in 1059. In 1418, Giovanni dei Bicci, founder of the Medici’s family, entrusted Filippo Brunelleschi for the reconstruction of San Lorenzo, who directed the works until his death in 1446. The project was completed by his biographer and heir Antonio Manetti in 1461. Since then San Lorenzo has inextricably linked its history to that of the Medici’s dynasty, therefore over three hundred years they had governed the fate of Florence and Tuscany. Inside the Medici’s official Church; weddings, baptisms and funerals took place for their members and they also attended the Great State ceremonies. Here they buried all their dead until the last descendant, Anna Maria Luisa.\n\nDespite some interventions of 18th and 19th century, the Basilica of San Lorenzo still retains nowadays the melodic vastness and the sense of perfect harmony that Brunelleschi had wanted to infuse in virtue of precise proportional relationships that regulate his structures. According to the will of Pope Leone X, son of Lorenzo the Magnificent, the Basilica would have had to be properly completed by a marble facing facade. In 1518 the Pope entrusted the task to Michelangelo. Many designs and a wooden model, now exposed in the museum of Casa Buonarroti, can give us an idea of the magnitude of Michelangelo’s project, which was never realized.\n\nThe church was restored, with the campanile added, by Ferdinando Ruggieri in 1740-1741, commissioned by the last of the Medici, Electress Palatine Anna Maria Lodovica.\n\nThe Old Sacristy Built by Brunelleschi between 1422 and 1428, the Old Sacristy represents one of the first projects by the famous Florentine architect in which he successfully transmitted his architectural vision into geometric volumes scrupulously which subdivided in accordance with precise proportional ratios. The simplicity and stringency of the spatial concept (a cubic space covered by an umbrella dome divided into twelve segments) is emphasized by the use of serene stone to highlight the load-bearing elements. Brunelleschi’s limpid architecture is offset by the polychrome stucco works produced by Donatello at various different times between 1428 and 1443.\n\n(http://www.museumsinflorence.com/musei/Medici_chapels.html)\n\nThe harmonious fusion between architectural space and plastic decoration makes the Old Sacristy one of the most complete and consistent works of the Early Florentine Renaissance. (Giovanni di Bicci and his wife Piccarda were buried in the Old Sacristy.)\n\nThe Medici Chapels\n\nThe Medici Chapels have been a state museum since 1869; their history is closely tied to that of the Basilica of San Lorenzo, of which they are part. The complex of the Medici Chapels including the sumptuous mausoleum of the Princes and Michelangelo’s New Sacristy designed as a funerary chapel of the Medici family.\n\nThe Medici chapels is reached through the back of the Basilica of San Lorenzo complex, where the entrance first opens onto a crypt that houses the tombs of the members of the older Medici family. The two staircases lead to the Chapel of the Princes on the floor above.\n\nAnna Maria Luisa, the Palatine Electress, is portrayed in the bronze statue by Alfonso Boninsegni . The 1946 model was cast in 2004 and that same year donated to the Museum by the artist’s heirs.\n\nThe New Sacristy (新聖器室) Thought out first by Pope Leone X to worthily accommodate the funeral monuments of his father Lorenzo the Magnificent and his uncle Giuliano, together with his brother Giuliano Duke of Nemours and his nephew Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, the New Sacristy was actually only started in 1520 by the will of the second Medici Pope, Clement VII. Michelangelo devoted himself to its realization until 1534, year of his definitive transfer to Rome (completed by Giorgio Vasari in 1546).\n\nAdopting the architectural model of the Old Sacristy, Michelangelo constructed a cubic space topped by a hemispherical dome in which the architectural elements are highlighted by the use of serene stone. The space is animated by a new plastic concept where the dual tone between the casing of serene stone and plastered surface enhances the drama of the two funeral monuments sculptural groups.\n\nIn the New Sacristy Michelangelo’s artistic genius appears in all its monumental greatness. It is a unique, monumental masterpiece of the artist in terms of architecture as well as sculpture. The celebrated and elegant funeral monuments are ironically those of the lesser known Medici, who both died young.\n\nTomb of Giuliano, Duke of Nemours with the statues Day(晝) and Night(夜)—Brother of Pope Leo X, the Duke of Nemours, was portrayed by Michelangelo as a military captain holding a staff of command. On the volutes of the sarcophagus lie the reclining statues of Day (right) and Night (left), which recall the insurable passing of time. Day is portrayed as a powerfully-built man with an unfinished face. Night is a young, sleeping woman with a smooth, sleek body, drenched in lunar light.\n\nThe figure of Night is considered by many as one of Michelangelo’s finest (1524-1527).《夜》：手枕著頭，正在沉睡中的女子，以腳下的貓頭鷹象徵著黑夜的降臨，身旁的面具，則象徵著她正受惡夢纏身\n\nTomb of Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino with the statues Dawn(晨) and Dusk(昏)—Michelangelo sculpted the tomb of the Duck of Urbino, nephew of Leo X, during his last years in Florence between 1531 and 1532. Dedicate of Machiavelli’s the Prince, Lorenzo is portrayed immersed in thought, and his pensive temperament is in line with the allegories of time placed at either side of his sarcophagus. Dawn seems to be waking from the torpor of sleep, while Dusk, in the abandon of painful inertia, seems to be about to fall asleep.\n\nSaint Cosmas, Madonna and Child, Saint Damian—The sepulcher with the mortal remains of Lorenzo the Magnificent and of his brother Giuliano (killed during the Pazzi conspiracy in 1478) is surmounted by three sculptures. The one in the middle is the Madonna and Child, an autograph work by Michelangelo of 1521. On the left is Saint Cosmas by Giovan Angelo da Montorsoli (1537), while on the right is Saint Damian by Raffaello da Montelupo (1531). (Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian are protectors of the Medici, Giovan Angelo and Raffaello are pupils of Michelangelo.) Vasari had the sculptures placed here is 1554.\n\nThe Princes’ Chapel (王室祭堂) The Chapel of the Princes was based on the idea of Grand Duck Cosimo I to create a monumental family tomb. It was designed to show the prestige and power of the Medici Grand Dukes. Emblematic achievement of the Medici self-affirmation, the Princes’ Chapel was conceived by Cosimo I since 1568 (Giorgio Vasari was entrusted with the project between 1561 and 1568), but its construction began under the grand duchy of Ferdinando I, when, as a result of a contest held in 1602, Matteo Nigetti, was appointed site manager, a position that he held until 1650. The Grand Dukes wanted to cover the walls of their mausoleum with the most precious and incorruptible materials: polychrome marbles and granites, jaspers, alabasters and lapis lazulis and even corals and mother pearls. The Opificio delle Pietre Dure, founded in 1588 by Ferdinand I, for centuries, has dedicated much of its work on the decoration of the Princes’ Chapel. The expensive works proceeded very slowly and exhausted the financial resources of the grand duchy. It was then Anna Maria Luisa de ‘Medici, the last heir of a dynasty, that ended with her death, who wanted to impress a decisive acceleration at the yard, consigning to the history the last fruit of the great Medici’s patronage.\n\nThe octagonal room has six niches dedicated to the funeral monument of each Grand Duke, identifiable by their name inscribed in letters of semi-precious stones above. The monumental tombs were to be completed by a bronze statue of each Duke, but only two of these were actually carried out. (Two niches contain statues of two grand dukes, Cosimo II and Ferdinando I. Plans to create statues for the other dukes were never realized.) The dukes, full-length and larger than life, have been depicted as youthful and powerful, with the crown and scepter, symbols of the sacredness and power handed down for centuries from one Medici prince to another.\n\nDuring the first half of 18th century, by order of Anna Maria Luisa de’Medici, the large windows and cupola were completed, while the internal decoration of the vault was executed by Pietro Benvenuti between 1828 and 1837 (feature scenes of the Old and New Testaments). The Chapel flooring of semiprecious stone inlay was only completed in 1962. (Sixteen coats of arms, representing the most important cities in Tuscany)\n\np.s. There is a great difference in atmosphere and style from the Chapel of the Princes, holding the monuments of the Medici dukes and the New Sacristy by Michelangelo, with the monuments of the earlier, “unofficial” Medici rulers of the Renaissance. The former is ostentatious, grand, over-the-top with intensely decorated details and over life size sarcophagi and statues. The latter is elegant, subdued and understated, with use of the serene gray stones and white marble. These details really personify the figures whose memories they hold, and give a great idea as to how they were seen and known by the public. (The articulation of the architecture structure and the strength of Michelangelo’s sculptures reflect a complex symbolism of Human Life, where “active life” and “contemplative life” interact to free the soul after death, a philosophical concept closely linked to Michelangelo’s own spirituality.)\n\nThe Canons’ Cloister The Basilica’s main cloister takes is named after the Canons of San Lorenzo, who since the founding of the church, were in charge to ensure the daily liturgy and of providing pastoral cure. The cloister as we see it today is a work of Brunelleschi’s pupil and successor Antonio Manetti, who rebuilt it between 1457 and 1462, probably following an earlier design by Cosimo the Elder’s favorite architect Michelozzo. The spacious and well-proportioned cloister is articulated on two orders supported by elegant Ionic columns. The lower open gallery is higher and airy, with rounded arches while the upper floor is trabeated.\n\nOnce, around there were the houses of the canons and the prior and spaces dedicated to the common life as the kitchen, the refectory and the chapter hall. Even today we can see above the doors the alphabet letters that identify each house.\n\nIn the corner, at the far end of this side of the cloister, there are the stairs to the upper floor and to the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana; a niche in the wall at the left of the base of the stairs houses the marble statue of the Bishop of Como, the historian and collector Paolo Giovio, realized by Francesco da Sangallo in 1560.\n\nThe Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana\n\nThe importance of the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, with its collection of nearly 11,000 manuscripts, is based mainly on two converging factors, both extraordinary: the specific nature of the Library’s holdings and the character of its building. (It was really the first of its kind, and even served as a model for the Vatican’s library.) Commissioned by Pope Clement VII of the Medici ‘s to host the valuable collection of manuscripts of the family, the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana was designed by Michelangelo, who personally directed the work between 1523 and 1534, the year of his transfer to Rome. The library was completed in 1571 by Giorgio Vasari and Bartolomeo Ammannati, commissioned by Cosimo I of the Medici’s, to continue the works according to Michelangelo’s drawings and it was opened to the public later that year.\n\nVestibule: The access or entrance-hall, called vestibule, is dominated by the large serene stone staircase realized ​​by Ammannati in 1559 following the Michelangelo’s model, who had, however, originally conceived it of walnut wood. (Michelangelo intended the Vestibule to be a dark prelude to the brightness of the Reading Room.)\n\nThe Vestibule remained incomplete until the beginning of the 20th century when finally the facade was accomplished with its series of blind windows. On the same occasion the ceiling was covered by a cloth painted by the Bolognese artist Giacomo Lolli, depicting motifs imitating the carved wooden ceiling of the Reading Room.\n\nThe staircase’s tripartite structure, including a central flight with elliptically shaped stairs and the outer ones are quadrangular shaped, is quite unique. The staircase is, then, an explosion of originality which fits perfectly with the fanciful character of the Mannerist style of architecture.\n\nThe Vestibule’s main feature is its vertical: the walls are divided into three sections decorated by double columns, scroll-shaped corbels, gabled niches framed by pilasters which taper downward in a usual fashion. The vertical tensions of the vestibule seem to quieted down in the long hall of the big Reading Room.\n\nThe Reading Room: At the top of the staircase a large portal introduces to the vast reading room, one of the few 16th centuries environments in the world to have preserved almost intact. Here everything is original from the ceiling of carved basswood by Giovan Battista del Tasso (1549-1550), on the basis of Michelangelo’s drawings, with beautiful stained glass windows designed by Giorgio Vasari with the Medici arms, ending with the beautiful red and white tiled floor, designed by Niccolò Tribolo (a student of Buonarroti) and realized from 1548 by Santi Buglioni. The same wooden benches, called plutei, which run in two parallel rows on both sides of the room, were made according to the Michelangelo’s drawings. They had the dual function of the lectern and custody: the codes were horizontally stored in the lower shelves and were freely available secured to the benches by chains.\n\nThe Reading Room, which unlike the Vestibule develops horizontally hosts two series of wooden benches.\n\nThe floor in red and white terracotta echoes the ornamental and symbolic designs found in the ceiling, which allude to the Medici dynasty. (You can’t step on it!)\n\nThe collection once kept here is unique for its philological and artistic value. The manuscripts and printed books lied horizontally on the lecterns and on the shelves and were distributed by subject (Patristics, Astronomy, Rhetoric, Philosophy, History, Grammar, Poetry, and Geography); the wooden panels placed on one side of each bench listed the titles of the items chained therein. This display was maintained until the beginning of the 20th century, when the manuscripts (the printed books were given to the Magliabechiana Library, now Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze in 1783) were transferred downstairs, in the vaults was they are still housed.\n\nEach row had a specific topic and a list of books assigned to that desk. Need to use a different book? You had to change your seat.\n\nThe splendid stained-glass windows, which were the last part of the Library to be accomplished (1558-1568), display an ornamental array of Medici heraldic devices-emblems, arms, winged putti-which can be referred to Clement VII and Cosimo I. Possibly realized by a Flemish workshop in keeping with Giorgio Vasari’s drawings, the refined multicolor decoration was realized using grisaille and yellow silver techniques and probably following four recurrent patterns.\n\np.s. The decorated windows in Michelangelo’s Library with all their references to contemporary pictorial art are a true master piece of glass craftsmanship. Originally the windows were thirty, fifteen on each side of the Reading Room in order to illuminate the two series of wooden benches or plutei. Today only twenty-seven windows survive in their “original” condition; two windows are “blind” and one has gone lost in order to build the entrance to the D’Elci Rotunda.\n\nTribuna D’Elci: In the first decades of the 19th century the Tribune d’Elci was added to the original settings (1818). The rotunda was designed by Pasquale Poccianti to house the collection of manuscripts and old books donated to the library by the Florentine scholar and bibliophile Angelo Maria d’Elci. The Rotunda was inaugurated in 1841 and has been the Library’s Reading Room until the 1970’s. Nowadays the D’Elci collection is kept elsewhere – in conditions more suitable for conservation purposes – and the room is employed for seminars, meetings and inaugurations. The d’Elci collection, comprising 1,213 first editions of Greek and Latin classics as well as the earliest exemplars printed by Aldo Manuzio, entered the Laurenziana in 1841 on the occasion of the 2nd Conference of Italian Scientists in Florence. In effect, the Florentine bibliophile Angelo Maria d’Elci had officially donated his collection to the Library as early as 1818, but he did not part from the library till his death, which occurred in 1824 in Vienna where he had the books rebound according to contemporary taste. After d’Elci’s death his books were taken care of by Giovanni degli Alessandri, Director of the RR. Gallerie and President of the Accademia di Belle Arti, in Florence: on behalf of his collector friend, Alessandri had the last volumes rebound and followed the various phases of the building of the Rotunda planned by Pasquale Poccianti in order to host the collection at the side of Michelangelo’s monumental library. Whilst the collection was kept by Alessandri, it was catalogued by Canon Francesco Grazzini. The Catalogue was published in Florence in 1826, anonymously, by the Tipografia all’insegna di Dante Similarly, eight manuscripts containing works and notes by D’Elci as well as his correspondence have been donated by Alessandri and the D’Elci heirs to the Laurenziana.\n\nThe neoclassical style of the room echoes the predominant elements in the Library’s architecture and decoration: viz. the columns, the two-toned walls and the terracotta floor.\n\nCollections: The Library holds around 11,000 manuscripts, 2,500 papyri, 43 ostraka, 566 incunabula, 1,681 16th century printed books, 592 periodicals on related subjects and a total of 126,527 books dating from the 17th to the 20th century. Certainly the collections are not outstanding from a numerical point of view, if compared with those belonging to other Italian or foreign libraries. Nevertheless, their truly exceptional character can be attributed to the fact that the manuscripts and books which compose them have been chosen for their age, textual worth and beauty.\n\nDante, Commedia\n\nOvid, Metamorphois\n\np.s. The manuscripts that once belonged to the Medici private library were stripped of their original covers, rebound in red leather with the Medici arms and arranged on benches. The chains still visible on the lower covers of many of these manuscripts bear testimony to the reading practices of the time and the librarians’ concern for the safeguard of the collection.\n\nThe Bargello National Museum has a remarkable collection of sculpture and minor arts. This building dates from 1255, when it was built as the seat of the “Capitano del Popolo\", the commander of the local militia. Later it became the seat of the “Podestà\" and then of the Capitano di Giustizia (the magistrate) or “Bargello\", from which it gets its name. After extensive renovation, it became one of Italy’s first national museums in 1865. It contains masterpieces by Brunelleschi, Donatello, Luca della Robbia, Verrocchio, Michelangelo, Giambologna, and Cellini along with splendid collections of bronzes, majolica, waxes, enamels, medals, seals, ivories, amber, tapestries, furniture and textiles from the Medici collections and those of private donors. p.s. The word “bargello\" appears to come from the Late Latin bargillus (from Goth bargi and German burg), meaning “castle\" or “fortified tower\". During the Italian Middle Ages it was the name given to a military captain in charge of keeping peace and justice (hence “Captain of justice\") during riots and uproars. In Florence he was usually hired from a foreign city to prevent any appearance of favoritism on the part of the Captain. The position could be compared with that of a current Chief of police. The name “Bargello\" was extended to the building which was the office of the captain. History (http://www.polomuseale.firenze.it/en/musei/?m=bargello) The Palazzo: The Palazzo del Bargello was founded in 1255 as the headquarters of the Capitano del Popolo (Captain of the People), an office instituted five years earlier in the constitution of the ancient Florence republic in order to safeguard the rights of the population and ensure its economic organization. It was the first public palazzo in Florence-built to the design of Lapo di Cambio, father of Arnolfo di Cambio, or Dominicans Fra’Sisto and Fra’Ristoro, the first architects of Santa Maria Novella. The construction incorporated pre-existing structures including the Palagio and Tower of the Boscoli, as well as various houses and towers belonging to the church of the Badia. This austere crenellated building served as model for the construction of the Palazzo Vecchio. In 1260 the Palazzo became the headquarters of the Podestà, the administrators of the justice with a temporary tenure; this new destination called for several enlargements in Via dell’Acqua, with the erecting of the portico, and the Verone (loggia) on the first floor between 1317 and 1320 to a design by Tone di Giovanni Scene of numerous turbulent Florentine political events, the building was subjected to extensive damage, including fires (1332), floods (1333), sieges (1378), and as a result it was restored and restructured on numerous occasions. The year 1574 marked a turn in civic and architectural events for the building (From 1574, under the lordship of Cosimo I de’ Medici, palazzo was made over into the city prison). Since the Capitano di piazza also called Bargello, head of the police force and keeper of public order was transferred to the Palazzo, it was necessary to raise the dividing walls (in order to create the greatest number of cells possible inside the vast interiors) and close off the arches of the loggia, while the mural decorations were either destroyed or painted over. This situation remained unchanged until 1786 when Grand Duck Leopold of Lorraine abolished the death penalty and all the torture instruments were burnt in the courtyard. In 1857 it was decreed to transfer the prison to the nearby convent of the Murate and a full-scale restoration of the Palazzo was commenced under the direction of Francesco Mazzei, concluded in 1865. Wherever possible, Mazzei tried to maintain the original appearance of the building, demolishing the 16th century masonry infrastructures (opened up the arches again) in order to recover the numerous damaged architectural and pictorial decorations of the rooms, and reproducing those that had been destroyed. p.s. Palazzo del Bargello is the oldest public building in Florence. The original two-story structure was built alongside the Volognana Tower in 1256. The third story, which can be identified by the smaller blocks used to construct it, was added after the fire of 1332. The Bargello’s ancient bell tower traditionally rings only in case of war or of enemy attach, the last time it rang was for the big flood in 1966. The Birth of the Museum: Since 1859 it had been decided that the ancient Palazzo del Podestà, once restored, should house a museum documenting the history and the arts of Tuscany. After various projects, during the years in which Florence was capital of Italy the idea of a National Museum emerged; it was inaugurated in 1865 with the celebrations in honor of Dante Alighieri. Participating in the two exhibitions set up for the occasion, devoted to Dante and to medieval art, there were also private collectors who offered a variety of different objects to contribute to the formation of the museum. In this initial phase two rooms were set up on the ground floor displaying the arms and armour that remained of the Medici armoury and other arms from the Guardaroba of Palazzo Vecchio, and a room of 15th and 16th century sculptures. The sculptures from the Salone dei Cinquecento in Palazzo Vecchio were set up in the Salone on the first floor. Later came the bronze and marble sculptures, originally displayed in the corridor and several rooms of the Uffizi, the collections of applied arts (majolica, waxworks, amber, ivory, gold and silverware, enamels and small bronzes) previously belonging to the Medici and later housed in the Uffizi and in Palazzo Pitti, as well as donations and loans from private citizens. Other material arrived from public institutions (the seals from the State Archive, coins from the Mint) while after the suppression of the monastic orders which followed the unification of Italy, the museum was further enriched by Della Robbias and other sculptures and liturgical gold and silverware. For the fifth centenary of Donatello in 1887, numerous sculptures by the artist were arranged in the first floor Salone, starting with the St. George from the tabernacle of the Armourers’ guild in Orsanmichele. Since then, despite various changes, the room has been used to display the works of Donatello and other Florentine sculptors of the early 15th century. In the last decade of the 19th century the museum received several important donations from private citizens. Particularly significant among these (1886), in terms of the number (3,236 pieces), the quality and the exceptional variety of the objects, is the collection which the Lyons antique collector Louis Carrand bequeathed to the city of Florence, on the condition that it should be kept at the Bargello. Following this and other bequests (Conti in 1886, Ressman in 1899 and Franchetti in 1906) the museum gradually became specialized in the sector of the applied arts, no less important than that of Renaissance sculpture. p.s. The Bargello Museum is the most important and largest collection of Italian Renaissance sculpture. For Renaissance art lovers, the Bargello is to sculpture what the Uffizi is to painting. Visit the Museum Courtyard: The courtyard and loggia of the Bargello Museum are home to an exceptional collection of the coats of arms left by the administrators of Justice (Capitani del Popolo, Podesta, Giudici di Rota). Also the courtyard was once the place execution. Designed to connect the earlier and later parts of the Palazzo – that is the section on Via del Proconsolo and that over Via dell’Acqua – the 13th century Courtyard was embellished in the following century by the addition of the elegant Verone and the staircase. These two attractively Gothic-flavor elements mediate the approach to the imposing reaches of the upper floors. As a court, it has a unique geometry. It’s square with an eight-sided well in the middle, arched porticoes on 3 sides and, on the fourth side, an impressive stone staircase leading onto an open balcony (loggia) with sculptures. Various 16th century statues by Bandinelli, Ammannati, Giambologna and Danti are set against the walls. The Michelangelo Room (The Michelangelo and 16th Century Sculpture): The masterpieces of 16th century sculpture are gathered in the Michelangelo Room (ground floor) where we can admire four splendid works by Michelangelo, from the earliest Bacchus Drunk, the smooth soft contours of which reveal the influence of classical art, to the later works (Brutus, Pitti Tondo and David-Apollo), with rugged surfaces, worked as in a chiaroscuro drawing and using the “non finito\" technique, which are also dense in symbolic meanings. Entrance to the Michelangelo Room This spacious hall, one of the oldest in the Palazzo, liberated by Mazzei’s restoration in 1865 from the infrastructures that had invaded it at the end of the 16th century, was redecorated by Gaetano Bianchi with ribs taken from Giotto’s work in Assisi and the ornamentation of the arches made up of a highly ingenious intertwining of lilies – the emblem of the Comune (D’Azeglio). Following the damage caused by the flood of 1966, the room was restored and repainted (only the fresco of the Virgin and Child attributed to the school of Giotto now remains). It was then allocated by Luciano Berti to the display of the most prestigious examples of 16th century sculptures, many of which came to the Bargello in 1874 from the Uffizi Gallery. Bacchus—The Roman god of wine with a small satyr was Michelangelo’s first major work (when he was just 22, 1496-1497). The modeling is Classical, but the unsteady, drunken posture mocks the poise of ancient works. This Bacchus with its precarious equilibrium and drunken gaze was not appreciated by its patron, Cardinal Raffaele Sansoni Riario: already in 1501 the Bacchus was among the works in the garden of the Roman residence of banker Jacopo Galli, to whom it had been sold. The Medici purchased the sculpture for 240 ducats in 1572 and according to records; it was displayed in the Uffizi until at least 1591. p.s. There is also work by Sansovino who made a Bacchus of his own to compete against Michelangelo’s (far left). Giovan Francesco Rustici, Madonna and Child with the Young Saint John, 1509 Commissioned by the Silk Guild, that relief forms part of the traditional Tuscan painted tondos with the Madonna and Child, nevertheless it is clearly inspired by Michelangelo’s Pitti Tondo. Rustici, however, seems more interested in expressing the humanity of the divine group, thanks to the naturalness of the representation. Michelangelo, David-Apollo, 1530 Original Base of the Perseus—The marble base stood beneath the large bronze statue of Perseus holding the severed head of Medusa in the Loggia dei Lanzi in Piazza della Signoria. It was under explicit orders from the Duck Cosimo I de’Medici that Benvenuto Cellini executed the monumental bronze statue (which still stands in the piazza) and the marble base. The work lasted from 1550 to 1554. The marble pedestal is masterfully decorated with heraldic motifs (the Capricorn heads, the duck’s emblem), mythological figures (the Diana herms at the corners) and grotesques. The base also comprises full-round bronze statues in the four niches depicting figures from the myth of Perseus, based on Ovid’s Metamorphoses. The niches contained portrayals of the gods who guaranted protection of the feats of Perseus: his mother Danae with the small hero, his father Zeus, and his siblings Minerva and Mercury. After the restorations that were completed in 2000, the marble base was replaced with a copy for conservation reasons and transferred to the Bargello, which also housed a wax model of the Perseus, and a small scale bronze version with some variations, that may be related to the final design, all exhibited in this room. Mercurio Volante (Flying Mercury)—This is Giambologna’s most famous work. Its representation of the gods as a harmonious and agile nude figure, in artificial balance on the breath of Zephyr, received great acclaim. The first mention of this Mercury dates back to 1580, when it was sent to decorated the fountain at the entrance to the garden of Villa Medici in Rome, residence of Cardinal Ferdinando de’Medici. When the villa was sold by Grand Duck Pietro Leopoldo of Lorraine, in 1780, the bronze statue was sent to the Uffizi. The Loggia (Verone): The elegant loggia covered with cross vaults faces onto the large courtyard of the palazzo. With the transformation of the Bargello into a prison at the end of the 16th century, this part was closed off and divided into cells until the 19th century renovate, which restored the building to its original structure, embellished with 14th century style mural decorations. The present layout, which dates to 1932, features a display of various 16th century sculptures. These include a number of works by Jean de Boulogne, known as Giambologna, a Flemish artist who came to Florence around 1553 and very soon entered the service of the Medici. By him are the two fishing Putti originating from the Casino of San Marco and the marble Allegory of Architecture. This statue, which stood in the Boboli gardens up to 1789, was inspired by the allegories of the Fine Arts which adorned the catafalque of Michelangelo at the lavish funeral of the artist which was celebrated in the Church of San Lorenzo in July 1564. The gigantic Jason by Pietro Francavilla, recently acquired by the museum, one of the most significant testimonies to Mannerist sculpture in Florence, reveals the last developments of Florentine Mannerism. The Donatello Room (The Donatello and 15th Century Sculpture): Originally the “Council Chamber”, this is the largest room in the Palazzo. Restructured by Francesco Mazzei and redecorated by Gaetano Bianchi between 1857 and 1865, it was also used for housing the 15th century sculptures from Palazzo Vecchio. During Donatello’s centrnary celebrations (1887) an exhibition was organized the combined his works already on display in the museum with the casts of those missing. The success of this exhibition gave rise to the idea of permanently displaying Donatello’s masterpieces together with early 15th century sculptures in this room which still has the same setup today except for the addition of several works. This fine hall, mediaeval in structure, was radically restored between 1857 and 1865. With its imitation fresco decoration and the symmetrical arrangement of the works, it represents a typical example of 19th century museum layout. Baptistry Door Competition Panels—In 1401 the competition held for the second bronze door of the Florentine Baptistery was won by Lorenzo Ghiberti with his panel portraying sacrifice of Isaac, on display here together with the one by Filippo Brunelleschi. The competition for the second door of the Baptistery, held by the powerful Guild of the Merchants of Calimala in 1401, is commonly reputed to have been the event that inaugurated the Renaissance. (Ghiberti’s and Brunelleschi’s trial panels are so different from Florentine Gothic art often regards as the first products of the Renaissance.) Among those taking part were Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi, both declared equal winners even though it appears the latter decided not to take part in the assignment. The models to be submitted to the commission, a bronze panel with a polylobed frame (like the one on the southern door carried out by Andrea Pisano in the 14th century), had to portray the Sacrifice of Issac and those by Ghiberti and Brunelleschi are the only ones that still remain. Ghiberti’s composition stands out first and foremost for the balance between the figures and the space divided diagonally by the rock, and the refined decorations on the altar which testify to this artist’s exceptional talent as a goldsmith. There is also reference to ancient art, especially in the nude figure of Isaac. Brunelleschi’s relief instead shows a single space in which the figures, distributed on parallel planes, hardly fit into the frame. With the abrupt rhythm of the gestures the artist accentuates the dramatic sense of the action about to take place, demonstrating a more modern interpretation. There is also reference to ancient sculpting in the figure on the left that recalls the theme of the Spinario (thorn puller). Donatello, Marzocco, 1420/ Benedetto da Maiano, Base, 1483 A heraldic symbol of Florentine dominion, the Marzocco (from the Latin Martius, or Mars, god of war) is an emblem of force and generosity. This lion holding a shield which bears a lily, the coat of arms of Florence, was sculpted for the apartment which housed Pope Martin V in Santa Maria Novella between 1419 and 1420. In 1812 it was positioned in front of Palazzo della Signoria to replace the original 14th century Marzocco, by then in ruins. However, due to the deterioration of the stone, Donatello’s lion was moved inside the Uffizi in 1847 and replaced by a replica. The elegant marble base, supported by columns and balustrade and decorated on the fieze with the coats of arms of Florence and city’s institutions, once held the 14th century Marzocco of the Signoria before it was replaced by Donatello’s in 1812. For conservation reasons, the base was transferred to the Bargello in 1999 and reunited with Donatello’s Marzocco (already in the museum since 1865). Today there is a copy of the same in front of Palazzo Vecchio in Piazza della Signoria. The young Donatello trained under Ghiberti and after initially being influenced by the late-Gothic experience he later became more fascinated by classical sculptures, inaugurating the Renaissance in sculpture by proposing a new way of portraying figures in space. The change-over to this new Renaissance language can be seen by comparing his marble David from 1408 and Saint George from 1416, with the altar step (Saint George freeing the Princess), which is the first example of a “flattened” relief created with a perspective in space. Donatello, marble David, 1408 Donatello, Saint George/ Saint George Killing the Dragon and Liberating the Princess (predella), 1416-1417 This statue is the first sculpture that fully expressed the aesthetic and civic ideals of the Renaissance. Indeed, Gothic art seems surpassed in the classical and harmonious proportions of the young hero’s body; in the proud expression which is inspired by portraits from the ancient Roman art. Donatello received the commission for the statue, and the tabernacle in which it stood (the one in the museum is copy), in 1416 from the Guild of Armourers and Sword Makers, which like the other guilds had a niche on the façade of the church of Orsanmichele. By 1417 he had completed the statue and predella depicting Saint George Killing the Dragon and Liberating the Princess. It was here that he first experimented with Brunelleschian perspective and with what has come to be known as “stiacciato” technique that is a low relief that becomes flatter and flatted near the horizon line and can be used to depict complex perspectives and even suggest atmospheric effects in sculpture.\n\nSmithsonian此次的Insider’s Florence行程在「大衛」的震撼中結束，而心情實在無法馬上回復，因此信步走到附近的聖天使報喜廣場，就遇到也在年會空檔來拍照的傅老！可見此廣場建築的重要及可觀性。\n\nPiazza della Santissima Annunziata is located in the historic center of Florence, just north of the Piazza del Duomo, and is dominated by the Basilica of the Annunciation, one of the most important religious buildings in Florence, as well as the parent of the ‘ Order of the Servants of Mary. Subject of an early urban intervention, attended some of the greatest architects of the Renaissance, the square is today of great stylistic harmony, porticos on three sides, and the fourth with two twin buildings, framing the view of the dome of Brunelleschi through straight Via dei Servi .\n\nThe piazza is surrounded on three sides by balanced porticoes, with the mostly southern oriented side opening on to Via dei Servi.\n\np.s. Between 1447 and 1452 Antonio Manetti built a porch to a first arch in front of the facade of the church; since 1516 Antonio da Sangallo the Elder and then Baccio d’Agnolo built the porch equivalent to the Brunelleschi, the loggia of the Servants of Mary; between 1599 and 1601 Giovanni Battista Caccini expanded the porch of the church at the expense of the family Pucci , as reminiscent of the inscription and the emblems affixed.\n\nHistory: The area of the piazza was chosen in 1250 as a space for a church by the Florentine members of the Servite Order. At the time the piazza lay in open countryside outside the main city walls of Florence, in an area called Cafaggio. In 1299 the City destined 400 florins to the Friars for the purchase of land in front, on which to create a square. As defined itself over the course of several centuries, the square shows today unitary character and, between the streets of Florence, is the one that best expresses the ideals of the Renaissance city. Adding to the beauty of the space were then placed in the first half of the 17th century some outstanding elements of street furniture. At the center was placed the equestrian monument to Grand Duke Ferdinando I, a late work of Giambologna finished by Pietro Tacca in 1608. Similarly Tacca will then have the two fountains with marine figures in bronze at the sides (1629) originally made ​​to adorn the monument to Ferdinand I de ‘Medici in Livorno and assembled here in 1643 . With these grants, the square took on the current characteristics and, in 1684, Ferdinand Leopodo the Best could be defined in its guide of Florence Square.\n\nThe Buildings:\n\nPalazzo Grifoni-Budini Gattai\n\nIn the southeast corner of the piazza lies the Palazzo Grifoni-Budini Gattai, formerly Palazzo Grifoni, begun in 1157 by Bartolomeo Ammannati for Jacopo Ugolino Grifoni and eventually finished by Buontalenti and Giambologna. It is privately owned and available for functions. The masonry exterior is brick, representing an almost unique example in Florence, where the use of brick, especially in a monumental building. The façade is organized on three floors (The palace was born with two floors; the third was added between the 17th and 18th centuries.), tightened between robust ashlars angular and divided by ornate friezes and string course, decorated with triglyphs and metopes with ox skulls and patere.\n\nPortico della Confraternita dei Servi di Maria\n\nThe Renaissance style porch was built between 1516 and 1525 and designed by Antonio da Sangallo the Elder and Baccio d’Agnolo (the latter present in the pipeline only until 1519), in keeping with the design dell’antistante factory built a century before by Filippo Brunelleschi for the Hospital of the Innocents (give unity to the square). Today it houses a hotel.\n\nThe “S\" twisted in the medallions are the very symbol of the Servants of Mary.\n\nSantissima Annunziata\n\nThe church that gives the piazza its name, Santissima Annunziata, lies behind a portico on the north side of the piazza. Santissima Annunziata is an old parish church founded in 1250 by the Servite order. The current building was constructed in the 1444 (finished 1481) by Michelozzo, funded by Medici. In order to visually relate it to the already existing Spedale degli Innocenti it was preceded by a cloister and by a portico.\n\nSpedale degli Innocenti—Brunelleschi’s first architectural commission\n\n(http://imgkid.com/ospedale-degli-innocenti.shtml)\n\nThe delicate nine-bay arcade on the eastern side of this elegant square was the Brunelleschi-designed (1419-1426) and La Robbia-decorated façade of the Spedale degli Innocenti. This “hospital” is named after Herod’s biblical Massacre of the Innocents following the birth of Jesus. It opened in 1445 as the first orphanage in Europe, and part of the building is still used for this purpose. The building overlooking the square is erected above a nine steps staircase and is characterized by a porch (71 meters long) defined by nine semicircular arches at the center of columns with capitals d ‘ Composite order and, on the sides, two other arches flanked by fluted pilasters. On the porch there are frescoes by Bernardino Poccetti, both in the lunettes at the ends, in the latter case the crowning marble busts of Grand Duke Francesco and Ferdinand.\n\nIn the spandrels of the arches there are eight glazed blue terracotta roundels (Puttini), added by Andrea della Robbia around 1487, showing babies wrapped in swaddling bands, reflect the building’s function as an orphanage. Above each semicircular arch is a tabernacle window (a rectangular window with a triangular pediment on the top), underlined by a string-course and with sloped roof sloping roof with projecting eaves.\n\np.s. The highlighting of the building design by using a gray stone (pietra serena) on a white surface became a typical feature of Florentine architecture. Also novel was the proportional logic.\n\nThe heights of the columns, for example, were not arbitrary. If a horizontal line is drawn along the tops of the columns, a square is created out of the height of the column and the distance from one column to the next, making each bay a cube. This desire for regularity and geometric order was to become an important element in Renaissance architecture. Also half the height of the column is the height of the entablature, which is appropriate for a clear minded society. Brunelleschi’s round arch gave rise to the Classical style widely copied by Renaissance architects and was the first classical loggia in the city.\n\nAt the left hand end of the portico (behind the grated window—the window was covered by a grate large enough only for the newborn babies to passed through and placed here since 1660) is the ruota dei proi (foundling wheel), rotating stone cylinder on which mothers could laid their unwanted children anonymously and ring the orphanage bell. After they rang a bell, the stone was rotated 180 degrees, taking the baby inside the orphanage. This system was in operation until the hospital’s closure in 1875.\n\nOn the portico above the window is a bust of Cosimo I de’Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany (1519–1574).\n\nThe fresco above the window depicts two cherubs holding a scroll with this Latin inscription from Psalm 26: “Pater et mater reliquerunt nos, Dominus autem assumpsit” (Our fathers and mothers have abandoned us, but the Lord has taken us).\n\nPalazzo delle Due Fontane\n\nIt is a neomanierista building with a facade relatively recent, which repeats, while simplifying them, shapes and color of the nearby Palazzo Grifoni. You should treat actually a building of ancient building, reconfigured in the late 19th and early 20th century to be an appropriate backdrop to the square. The ground floor, in particular, presents a rusticated stone. It is currently occupied by Hotel Due.\n\nThe Statues\n\nAt the center stands the equestrian monument to Grand Duke Ferdinando I de’Medici (on the horse riding towards the Duomo). It was the last work of Giambologna completed by his pupil Pietro Tacca in 1608 after his death. It was the culmination of the dream of the Grand Duke of being remembered for his exploits like the father Cosimo I , who had to take a few decades before a ‘ similar statue , always Giambologna in Piazza della Signoria . The monument was cast with the bronze coming from the cannons of the Turkish galleys, won by the Knights of the Military Order of St. Stephen in 1607, built to fight the pirates who infested the Mediterranean at the initiative of the house Doctors .\n\nIn 1640 the rear side of the pedestal was decorated with a bronze relief showing 60 bees swarming around their queen: it was meant to symbolize Ferdinand’s motto Maiestate Tantum (Great Majesty), but maybe the idea came from the bees of Pope Urban VIII, who was the ruling pope at that time.\n\nAn Italian piazza is not complete without a fountain; maybe this was the rationale behind the decision of Grand Duke Ferdinand II to place in Piazza SS. Annunziata two amazing fountains by Pietro Tacca (1629, with the collaboration of students Bernardino Radi and Francesco Maria Bandini) which had been designed to embellish Leghorn, the port of the Grand Duchy. This explains why, although being impressive for their craftsmanship, the two fountains do not entirely fit into the harmonic Renaissance design of the piazza.\n\nPietro Tacca’s stylized Mannerist bronze fountains on the square decorated with figures of grotesque mythical creatures.\n\nThe Galleria dell’Accademia is one of the most popular museums in Florence, mostly thanks to Michelangelo’s David statue. The museum also houses other artwork, including statues, religious paintings and musical instruments.\n\nHistory of the Academy Cosimo I de’ Medici, grand duke of Tuscany, founded Europe’s first art academy which set up to teach the techniques of drawing, painting and sculpture in 1563. Michelangelo Buonarroti was one of the first teachers in the academy, which was called Accademia delle Arti del Disegno. In 1784, the Grand Duke Pietro Leopoldo of Lorraine united all the Florentine drawing schools into one “Academy\", the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno then became part of a new institution, the Accademia di Belle Arti (Academy of Fine Arts). The Galleria dell’Accademia was established in the 18th century (housed in the antic spaces of the Hospital of Saint Matthew and the Convent of Saint Niccolo’ of Cafaggio) as a teaching facility for students of the adjacent Academy of Fine Arts.\n\nThe Galleria dell’Accademia was progressively enriched by paintings gathered from convents or monasteries which were suppressed by Grand Duke Pietro Leopoldo of Lorraine at the end of the 18th century and later on also by Napoleon in 1810. The original statue of Michelangelo’d David was transferred from Piazza della Signoria into the Galleria in 1873. The architect Emilio de Fabris projected a special tribune with a large skylight to shelter David, eventually completed in 1882. Ten years after the Galleria dell’Accademia was opened to the public, the museum changed various arrangements to showcase tapestries, paintings and sculptures, mainly when Michelangelo’s Prisoners were moved into the Galleria dell’Accademia in 1909. Around the 1950s the Hall of the Colossus was opened together with the so-called Bizantine style Rooms featuring 1300 panel paintings. In the 1980s the collection of plaster casts models by Lorenzo Bartolini was added to the Museum, housed inside the 19th Century Room originally used as the women’s ward in the ancient Hospital of Saint Matthew, patron of the bankers. An interesting wing of the Museum houses an outstanding collection of antic musical instruments, from the Cherubini Conservatory, witnessing the true passion of the Medici family for theater, ballet and music entertainment. The last nucleus of artworks features religious panel paintings by major artists active in or around Florence between the mid-13th and the late 16th centuries. The collection is exposed alongside the first floor and gathers restored colorful gold-backed altarpieces and splendid late-Gothic polyptychs. The latest setting of the museum involved the Hall of the Colossus in December 2013 to allow a larger and more enjoyable number of artworks from the 15th and early 16th century.\n\nHall of the Colossus The Galleria dell’Accademia welcomes the visitor in the Hall of the Colossus. The room acquired its name during the 19th century when it housed the plaster cast model of an ancient statue, one of the Dioscuri of Montecavallo (Castor and Pollux), no longer displayed in the Galleria dell’Accademia. It now hosts in the center the plaster model for the stunning marble sculpture of Giambologna’s “Rape of the Sabines” (from around 1580).\n\nAs one enters the Galleria dell’Accademia, one will find the plaster cast model by Flemish sculptor Giambologna (as Jean de Boulogne, 1529-1608, is known in Italy) displayed central-stage in the Hall of the Colossus. From this model, Giambologna created the marble sculpture, completed in 1582 (410cm), you can admire in Piazza della Signoria under the Loggia dei Lanzi. The cast depicts three figures connected by a serpentine-shaped movement, with one man lifting a woman into the air while a second man crouches. The name of “The Rape of the Sabines” was suggested by his contemporary Vincenzo Borghini. What impacts the observer the most is the fact that the whole group was carved from a single block of marble, and is acknowledged as Giambologna’s masterpiece. The three figures are constructed on a vortex that invites the observer to move around the statue and offers infinite view points. Inspired by Michelangelo and by mannerist ideals, Giambologna became famous for the search of intertwined figural compositions and over ambitious inclusive efforts. His ability to sculpt bodies in the old classical style and splendid figures of naked women in seductive poses increased his fame at the end of the 16th century.\n\nHall of the Prisoners Used in the 19th century to display ancient paintings from the various collections, the Galleria dell’Accademia was later altered to house the unfinished statues by Michelangelo, thus creating a specific, unified itinerary that culminates in the center of the Tribune where Michelangelo’s David stands under a halo-like dome.\n\nThe Hall takes its name from the four large sculptures showing male nudes known as the Slaves or Prisoners or Captives. They were begun by Michelangelo for a grandiose project for the tomb of Pope Julius II della Rovere. The first commission dates back to 1505, before the assignment of the Sistine Chapel (1508), and it was meant to be the most magnificent tomb of Christian times, composed by more than 40 figures. The four Prisoners were carved for the pillars on the lower level of the tomb, intended for the grand Basilica of St. Peter’s in Rome. Michelangelo spent months in the Carrara quarries to personally select the brightest marble he likes necessary, marking each selected block with three circles. Due to a mounting shortage of money, the pope ordered him to put aside the tomb project in 1506. The original design was later scaled down to less grandiose proportions after the pope’s death in 1513, then in 1521 and eventually again in 1534, when the Prisoners were no longer part of the project and thus remained in Florence. After the artist’s death, four of the Prisoners were found in his studio and his nephew Leonardo Buonarroti donated them to Duke Cosimo I Medici, together with the Victory housed in Palazzo Vecchio today.\n\nIn 1586, Bernardo Buontalenti placed the Slaves at the corners of the large Grotto in the Boboli Gardens of Palazzo Pitti. The walls of this ambiance are decorated with fake stalactites and stalagmites, carved sponges, stones and shells that are laid out to resemble anthropomorphic figures. These elements were meant to resemble a natural grotto, perfectly suitable for Michelangelo’s unfinished sculptures. The Prisoners remained in the Grotto until 1908 and transferred into the Galleria dell’Accademia in 1909.\n\n(http://www.accademia.org/explore-museum/halls/hall-prisoners/)\n\nMichelangelo’s Prisoners or Slaves: The fame of these four powerful statues—named by scholars as “The Awakening Slave”,“The Young Slave”,“The Bearded Slave” and “The Atlas (or Bound)”— is due above all to their unfinished state. They are some of the finest examples of Michelangelo’s habitual working practice, referred to as “non-finito” (or incomplete), magnificent illustrations of the difficulty of the artist in carving out the figure from the block of marble and emblematic of the struggle of man to free the spirit from matter. These sculptures have been interpreted in many ways. As we see them, in various stages of completion, they evoke the enormous strength of the creative concept as they try to free themselves from the bonds and physical weight of the marble. It is now claimed that the artist deliberately left them incomplete to represent this eternal struggle of human beings to free themselves from their material trappings. As you admire the Prisoners from different angles, one can notice Michelangelo’s love and understanding of the human anatomy. The Prisoners’ heads and faces are the least-developed parts, but they are to communicate with their poses, known as the classic “contrapposto” (counter pose). The Slaves are standing with most of their weight on one foot so that their shoulders and arms twist off-axis from the hips and legs. This precise pose gives the Prisoners a more dynamic and powerful appearance, transmitting motion and emotion.\n\nThe Awakening Slave (marble, height 267 cm, 1520-23)—This piece is one of the most powerful and expressive works among the Slaves. It is the first statue one finds on the left along the corridor, the least outlined of the four Prisoners. The figure feels like it is writhing and straining, trying to imminently explode out of the marble block that holds it. The latent power one feels is extraordinary. Michelangelo is famous for saying that he worked to liberate the forms imprisoned in the marble. He saw his job as simply removing what was extraneous. This endless struggle of man to free himself from his physical constraints is a metaphor of the flesh burdening the soul. It is interesting to note the various marks left alongside the block of marble, above all at the back of the unfinished sculpture.\n\nThe Young Slave (marble, height 256 cm, 1530-34)—Across from the Awakening Slave is the so called, “Young Slave.” The figure is more clearly defined, but seems almost bound within himself, burying his face in his left arm and hiding the right one around the hips. The contrapposto pose is quite exaggerated by the narrowness of the block of stone and by the slightly bent knees. The profound study of human anatomy is highlighted in the left elbow and the careful lines of the bent biceps and triceps. His face, which is just beginning to emerge, seems so youthful by comparison with his musculature. Michelangelo always chiseled out the image front to back: it clearly shows within the Young Slave, which appears to be emerging from the rock that shows the rough tracks of the large tooth chisels.\n\nThe Bearded Slave (marble, height 263 cm, 1530-34)—The third statue on the right of the corridor is the “Bearded Slave” the most finished of the four Slaves. The figure is almost free, only his hands and part of his arm, probably planned to hold a cloth, are unfinished. The face is covered by a thick, curly beard and the thighs are bound by straps of cloth. The torso is finely modeled, revealing Michelangelo’s deep knowledge of anatomy.\n\nThe Atlas (marble, height 277 cm, 1530-34)—Down the corridor on the left is the “Atlas.” The male nude seems to be carrying a huge weight on his head. Hence he is named after Atlas, the primordial Titan who held up the entire world on his shoulders. His head has not emerged from the stone, leading the slave to support and push such a heavy weight, which threatens to compress him. The force of weight pushing down, and that pushing back up, create a vigorous tension. There is no feeling of equilibrium here, only an eternal battle of forces threatening to explode in both directions. This pressure generates a power which perhaps more than the other Slaves expresses the energy of the figure struggling to emerge from marble.\n\np.s. Other statues that were also made for the tomb but never used are the two superb Slaves, the Rebellious Slave and the Dying Slave (both 1510-13), in the Louvre Museum, Paris, and the figure of Victory in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence.\n\nAlso displayed here is the statue of St. Matthew. The sculpture was commissioned to Michelangelo in 1503 as the first of a series of twelve Apostles that were to have decorated the Tribune of the Cathedral of Florence; the project was never carried out and the sculpture lay abandoned until 1906 purchased by the Galleria dell’Accademia. The statue’s taut and swollen neck muscles and the arm straining forcefully towards the rear as if to check the forward movement of the figure’s bent leg are immediately evident in the stature and express the contrast between matter and idea, between finite and infinite in Michelangelo and the incarnation of the interior torment that envelops the human soul.\n\nThe Michelangelo collection is completed by the Pietà da Palestrina (251.5cm), purchase by the Galleria dell’Accademia in 1939, originating from the chapel of Palazzo Barberini in Palestrina, close to Rome. It was carved from an ancient block of marble previously part of an unknown structure. The group is not mentioned by any documentary sources; it moreover is sculpted in a static and frontal position with a disproportionate handling of the limbs of the figures (note the obvious disparity between the short, thin legs of Christ and his powerful chest): all of these elements have recently induced scholars to refute a direct attribution to the Master and assign the work to an artist active in Michelangelo’s circle.\n\nThe Tribune: Michelangelo’s David At the Galleria dell’Accademia there’s only one star and that’s David. A special annex to the Galleria dell’Accademia was built just for this sculpture and the hall leading up to the statue and the lighting on the David add tremendously to the experience of ‘seeing David’.\n\nDuring the 1850s, there was an intense debate about the conservation of Michelangelo’s magnificent David (which had been standing outdoors in Piazza della Signoria since 1504). The architect Emilio de Fabris was entrusted to project a square Tribune within the Galleria dell’Accademia at the end of the so-called “Gallery of ancient paintings”, corresponding to today’s Hall of the Prisoners.\n\nThe David should have been placed in the center of the Tribune under a bright skylight, a halo-like dome.\n\np.s. In August 1873, the David, transported within a wooden frame, was removed from Piazza della Signoria and moved toward the Galleria dell’Accademia on rails especially built for the move. But it wasn’t moved into the Galleria dell’Accademia—since the Tribune wasn’t complete! Documents from the archive narrate that the statue then remained inside the wooden cart just outside, until 1882 when the Tribune was completed and opened to the public.\n\nAt first, the side wings of the Tribune were used to exhibit copies of Michelangelo’s works and, later on, tapestries. Today, we can admire David ideally framed by artworks by 16th century artists including Bronzino, Cecchino Salviati and Allori along these two wings of the Tribune. The choice of these artists is to emphasize their relationship with Michelangelo’s life, works and the cultural influence his works had on their own.\n\nMichelangelo’s David—“Nor has there ever been seen a pose so fluent, or a gracefulness equal to this, or feet, or hands and head so well related to each other with quality, skill and design\". With these words Giorgio Vasari attempts to define the reasons behind the marvel that the vision of David provokes in the observer. “When all was finished, it cannot be denied that this work has carried off the palm from all other statues, modern or ancient, Greek or Latin; no other artwork is equal to it in any respect, with such just proportion, beauty and excellence did Michelagnolo finish it”. He continues by stating that the statue so far surpasses both in beauty and technique ancient and modern statuary that one needn’t bother seeing other works in sculpture.\n\nThis astonishing Renaissance sculpture was created between 1501 and 1504. It is a 516 cm/ 17 ft/ 6 tons marble statue depicting the Biblical hero David, represented as a standing male nude. Originally commissioned by the Opera del Duomo for the Cathedral of Florence, Michelangelo was asked by the consuls of the Vestry Board to complete an unfinished project begun in 1464 by Agostino di Duccio and later carried on by Antonio Rossellino in 1475. Both sculptors had in the end rejected an enormous block of marble due to the presence of too many “taroli”, or imperfections, which may have threatened the stability of such a huge statue. This block of marble of exceptional dimensions remained therefore neglected for 25 years, lying within the courtyard of the Opera del Duomo (Vestry Board).\n\nMichelangelo was only 26 years old in 1501, but he was already the most famous and best paid artist in his days. After more than two years of tough work, Michelangelo decided to present his “Giant” to the members of the Vestry Board and to Pier Soderini, the then gonfaloniere of the Republic. In January 1504, his 17 foot tall David was unveiled only to them: they all agreed that it was far too perfect to be placed up high in the Cathedral, thus it was decided to discuss another location in town. The city council convened a committee of about thirty members, including artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli and Giuliano da Sangallo, to decide on an appropriate site for David. During the long debate, nine different locations for the statue were discussed, and eventually the statue was placed in the political heart of Florence, in Piazza della Signoria. On 24 June 1504 (the holiday celebrating the patron saint of Florence, St. John the Baptist), Michelangelo’s outdoor workshop was opened to the public. It took four days and forty men to move the statue the half mile from Michelangelo’s workshop behind Santa Maria del Fiore Cathedral to the Piazza della Signoria. Michelangelo then kept on working on the finer finishing. That summer, the sling and tree-stump support were gilded, and the figure was given a gilded victory-garland. Unfortunately, all gilded surfaces have been lost due to the long period of exposure to weathering agents.\n\nTraditionally, David had been portrayed after his victory, triumphant over the slain Goliath. Florentine artists like Verrocchio, Ghiberti and Donatello all depicted their own version of David standing over Goliath’s severed head. Michelangelo instead, for the first time ever, chooses to depict David before the battle.\n\nDavid is tense: Michelangelo catches him at the apex of his concentration. He stands relaxed, but alert, resting on a classical pose known as contrapposto. The figure stands with one leg holding its full weight and the other leg forward, causing the figure’s hips and shoulders to rest at opposing angles, giving a slight s-curve to the entire torso.\n\nThe slingshot he carries over his shoulder is almost invisible, emphasizing that David’s victory was one of cleverness, not sheer force. He transmits exceptional self-confidence and concentration, both values of the “thinking man”, considered perfection during the Renaissance.\n\nNowadays, visitors can admire the David under a skylight which was designed just for him in the 19th century by Emilio de Fabris. From a close distance, one can perceive Micheangelo’s passion for the human anatomy and his deep knowledge of the male body.\n\nNote the watchful eyes with carved eye bulks, pulsing veins on the back of the hands, engorged with tension. Admire the curve of the taut torso, the flexing of the thigh muscles in the right leg.\n\nThe proportions of some details are atypical of Michelangelo’s work.\n\nThe figure has an unusually large head and imposing right hand. These enlargements may be due to the fact that the statue was originally intended to be placed on the cathedral roof line, so important parts of the sculpture had to be necessarily accentuated in order to be visible from below. Another interpretation about these larger details leads scholars to think that Michelangelo intentionally over-proportioned the head to underline the concentration and the right hand to symbolize the pondered action.\n\nOnce again, Giorgio Vasari was able to synthesize the absolute perfection of this Renaissance masterpiece which still attracts, and does not disappoint, millions of visitors every year at the Galleria dell’Accademia in Florence. 觀看「大衛」是一場很難描繪的場景，明明在人聲雜沓的空間裡，我卻聽不見任何的話語；耳中只有縈迴不斷的旋律，簇擁著我一圈圈的漫步在「大衛」身旁；可卻不能與其對望，because—I got mist in my eyes!\n\nGipsoteca Bartolini, a 19th Century Hall\n\nIn 1784, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Pietro Leopoldo, converted the friary hospital of San Matthew into a gallery so that students in the adjoining Accademia delle Belle Arti could study the greatest works of the past. Therefore, in the “Gipsoteca Bartolini” visitors will find a selection of the finest 19th century plaster casts by Lorenzo Bartolini, one of the great sculptors and brilliant professors of the Academy.\n\nThe artworks exhibited alongside the Gipsoteca (which mean the hall of models) ideally reproduce Bartolini’s art studio, showcasing various typologies of celebratory, private or monumental plaster cast models often intended for sepulchers. Currently, the Hall exhibits two typologies of 19th century works. The collection of plaster models by Bartolini and Pampaloni, and the collection of paintings and sculptures which were awarded by the Academy of Fine Arts of Florence. Overall, the works in this room witness the evolution of Florentine artistic culture between Neoclassicism and Romanticism. Among the most famous works, grand models celebrate great artists of the past such as Machiavelli (by Lorenzo Bartolini), Arnolfo di Cambio and Brunelleschi (by Pampaloni) or wealthy foreign aristocrats settled in Florence during the 19th century.\n\nNote: Michelangelo’s sculpture is world famous, yet there’s more than one David in Florence…\n\nThe First David by Donatello Donatello was the first Renaissance sculptor commissioned to make a statue of David in 1408. The original idea was to have statues of biblical figures placed on the ledges around the terrace of the Duomo.\n\nThis David was sculpted in marble and is quite traditional—Although the positioning of the legs hints at a classical contrapposto (relaxed stance, shifted weight), the figure stands in an elegant Gothic way that surely derives from Lorenzo Ghiberti. The face is curiously blank (curiously, that is, if one expects naturalism, but very typical of the Gothic style), and David seems almost unaware of the head of his vanquished foe that rests between his feet. The statue is more-or-less life sized at just over 6 feet (191cm). Once the statues were placed on the buttresses though, they turned out to be too small to be seen from the ground and were removed. In 1416 the government of Florence (the Signoria) requested that the David, which had not found a ‘home’ yet, be displayed in Palazzo Vecchio, the town hall; evidently the young David was seen as an effective political symbol, as well as a religious hero.\n\nDonatello’s Second Statue of David This piece was commissioned by Cosimo the Elder around 1440 and from 1457 it stood in the courtyard of the Palazzo Medici Riccardi. After Medici were banished in 1494, the statue was requisitioned by the Signoria and placed in the courtyard of the Palazzo Vecchio (the marble David was already in the palazzo), as a civic hero symbol of the Florentine Republic. It was moved to the Palazzo Pitti in the 17th century, to the Uffizi in 1777, and then finally, in 1865, to the Museo Nazionale del Bargello, where it remains today.\n\nDonatello’s bronze statue of David (158 cm) is famous as the first unsupported standing work of bronze cast during the Renaissance, and the first freestanding nude male sculpture made since antiquity. Donatello created a totally unusual image of the young Biblical shepherd whose nudity alludes to the humility and courage which defeat arrogance and brute force. It depicts David with an enigmatic smile, posed with his foot on Goliath’s severed head just after defeating the giant. His hand is on his hip which is pushed out to the right in an almost flirty pose. His lack of muscles and visible power doesn’t seem fitting for the occasion.\n\nThis is also the only statue of David that depicts the hero with long hair hanging way down his back in ringlets. The contamination between the Biblical-civic theme and ancient mythology is also expressed by the extraordinary hat trimmed with ribbons and crowned with laurel that recalls Mercury’s winged hat.\n\nThe Statue of David by Verrocchio Verrocchio was a Renaissance artist who, for most of his life, worked for the Medici. He had an even more famous Renaissance artist as a pupil in his Florence workshop, namely Leonardo Da Vinci. It has been said, in fact, that it was the young and handsome Leonardo who was the model for Verrocchio’s David.\n\n(via Wikipedia) Verrocchio’s David (1473-1475) is a delicate bronze statue that is just over 4 feet (120cm) tall. This statue was also commissioned by the Medici and initially installed in Palazzo Vecchio in 1476. Verrocchio’s David is clothed in a sort of tunic. The head of Goliath is not a part of the whole statue, but was cast on its own and is a separate piece placed at the feet of the boy. Donatello’s David clearly inspired Verrocchio’s, although not in anti-conventionality. They’re both in bronze, both Davids have their left arm bent and leaning on their hip, and both have the head of Goliath at their feet. Both boys are holding Goliath’s sword in their right hand. They differ in that Verrocchio’s statue of David is modestly dressed whereas Donatello’s is bold and brash in his nudity. They both have a slight smirk, typical of adolescent swaggering. Where Donatello’s depiction is cheekily unique in its beauty, Verrocchio’s is traditionally and poetically striking.\n\np.s. All of these three Davids are on display at the Bargello Museum now.\n\nPiazza di San Marco\n\nThe church of San Marco and the museum lie on the north side of the piazza.\n\nIn the center of the square is a statue of General Manfredo Fanti (by Pio Fedi in 1873). Cafés and other places to eat are mainly along the southern side of the piazza.\n\np.s. Piazza di San Marco is currently the headquarter of the University of Florence, in the heart of the historical center (explaining the students’ protesting start here today).\n\nSan Marco San Marco is the name of a religious complex. It comprises a church and a convent. The convent, which is now a museum, has three claims to fame. During the 15th century it was home to two famous Dominicans, the painter Fra Angelico (1395-1455) and the preacher Girolamo Savonarola (1452-1498). Also housed at the convent is a famous collection of manuscripts in a library built by Michelozzo.\n\nChurch The church, rebuilt by Michelozzo di Bartolomeo, was consecrated in 1443, in the presence of Pope Eugene IV. It was composed of a single, wide aisle, a short transept and a square-shaped sanctuary. From 1579, the church and convent underwent further extensions and alterations by Giambologna. A further renovation was carried on in 1678 by Pier Francesco Silvani.\n\nChurch’s façade, in Neo-Classical style, was built in 1777-1778 by Giovanni Battista Paladini. Divided on three orders is punctuated by pilasters into three horizontal bands with a single portal surmounted by a window. In the side bands is decorated by two niches with statues (below) and ribbons and garlands (top); the upper register has a bas-relief decoration and a gable topped by iron cross.\n\np.s. The casings of the Gothic windows existing prior to the 15th century rebuilding can still be seen on the side of the church, from the cloister of St. Antonino.\n\nConvent The present convent occupies the site where a Vallombrosan monastery existed in the 12th century, which later passed to Benedictine monks of the Silvestrine line. In 1435 the Benedictines were replaced by Dominicans from the Convent of San Domenico in Fiesole. Two years later, they appealed to Cosimo de’ Medici the Elder, who lived nearby in the family palace, now known as the Palazzo Medici Riccardi, to fund the renovation of the entire complex. The works were entrusted to Michelozzo from 1437 to 1452. Each cell of the monks cloister and many other walls were decorated by Fra Angelico between 1439 and 1444 in collaboration with others, including Benozzo Gozzoli. The convent was stripped from the Dominicans in 1808, during the Napoleonic Wars, and again in 1866, when it became a possession of the state. The convent is now home to the Museo Nazionale di San Marco (opened to the public in 1869).\n\nThe entrance to the museum is from the Michelozzo’s St. Antonino Cloister (1440, named after the first Prior of San Marco Antonino Pierozzi), frescoed “Scenes from the Life of Saint Antoninus\" by Fra Angelico and other Florentine artists.\n\np.s. The museum was damaged during the weather events of September 19th 2014. The cedar was cut and works in the garden are still in progress.\n\n(http://www.museumsinflorence.com/musei/museum_of_san_marco.html#)\n\nThe convent, which has been preserved practically intact, is organized around the two square cloisters edged with porticoes: that of St. Antonino, now comprised within the Museum, and that of St. Dominic which is still occupied by the Dominican friars.\n\nThe St. Antonino Cloister is bordered by a portico with columns featuring a circular shaft and Ionic capitals, supporting segmental arches without framing around the aperture. In the upper register the Medici coat of arms appears on the outer walls and in the keystones of the portico. Overlooking this cloister are the Hospice (where the panel paintings by Angelico are displayed), the Lavatorium and the Large Refectory, the Chapter House and the Sacristy giving access to the church.\n\nChapter House:\n\nCrucifixion with Saints by Beato Angelico (1441-1442)\n\nThe fresco occupies the entire wall opposite to the entrance of the Chapter House showing the Crucifixion and saints. This is indeed the grandest fresco, both in terms of size and concept, which Fra Angelico painted in San Marco. The large fresco is in the form of a lunette, with life-size figures. The original blue of the background has gone and the red which remains accentuates the solitary figures which stand out dramatically. Around the fresco, on the border, are the busts of the Prophets and Sibyls in ten hexagons; in the centre, above the Crucifixion the pelikan, symbol of the redemption. Below, in the lower frieze there are 17 medallions with portraits of the most illustrious members of the Dominican Order. In this masterly work Fra Angelico pours out with full hands the most vivid and intense feelings of his soul, and if he does not attain to grand dramatic power, he at least succeeds in depicting with rare ingenuity the varied expressions of sorrow, despair, hope and faith which animate each person, and in giving natural and life-like character and attitude to the various heads.\n\nSaint Peter Martyr Enjoins Silence by Beato Angelico (1441-1443)\n\nIn 1954, Leonetto Tintori used the strappo technique to detach the frescoed lunette in the St. Antonino Cloister for conservation reasons. (This fresco is from one of the five lunettes Beato Angelico painted in the cloister above the doors leading to the various rooms.) This highly expressive and realistic figure of Saint Peter Martyr is the most intense and best conserved of all the Dominican saints depicted in the lunettes. He stands out powerfully against the background that has lost nearly all of the original azurite pigment. Indeed, only the dark red preparatory layer is visible and it considerably alters the overall effect.\n\np.s. The fresco was brought indoors after the restoration and a photographic reproduction put in its place where only the original decorations on the inside of the arch remain. In this lunette, the image of Saint Peter Martyr Enjoins Silence above the door between the cloister and the church of San Marco, was a “notice” to all those going through the door into the church that silence was required.\n\nBell called The Piagnona by Donatello and Michelozzo (1436-1443)\n\nThis famous bell, exhibited here since 1998, after the restoration by Opificio delle Pietre Dure, was originally housed in the bell tower of the church of San Marco. It is likely that the bell is the result of the collaboration between Donatello and Michelozzo. The bell’s history, which is just as significant as its artistic merits, is closely linked to the dramatic events in the life of Fra’Girolamo Savonarola. Its chimes resounded along with the crying of the worshipers, who were moved by the friar’s sermon. For this reason, the bell was called the Piagnona, after the nickname given to the friar’s followers; call Piagnoni (those who cry). There is a Latin inscription in relief starting at the top. Under the inscription is a bas-relief frieze of dacing putti, classical vases and Medici coats of arms. Underneath is a band of small arches alternating with inverted lilies. Bellow this section are two medallions on opposite sides of the bell.\n\nPilgrims’ Hospice Room: In 1918-1921, various paintings from the repositories of the Florentine galleries, dating to between the 14th and the 17th centuries (including many works by Angelico) and largely originating from suppressed convents and churches in Florence and the surrounding provincial area, were gathered in the Pilgrims’ Hospice Room.\n\nDeposition from the Cross 卸下聖體 by Fra Angelico (1437-1440)\n\nThis work was originally commissioned by Palla Strozzi from Lorenzo Monaco, for the sacristy of the church of Santa Trinità in Florence, but by the time of Monaco’s death only the pinnacles of this work had been painted. When Angelico took over the commission he found himself cribbed and confined by Monaco’s ready-made triple-arched Gothic frame. He ignored these constraints, however, making skillful use of the three arches in his composition to provide a scene of stunning beauty and subdued yet poignant emotion, set in an expansive Tuscan landscape. Although the work is painted on one panel, the three arches of the frame find an echo in the placing of the figures in three groups. The central arch is largely blocked off by the wooden framework of the cross and two ladders. The cross bar of the former appears to run behind the picture frame hinting at further, obscured space. With no scene behind but the sky and the lattice work of timber, the eye is drawn to the body of Christ which is at the very centre of the picture. Angelico challenges the tendency of the other two arches to define the shape and space of the work by placing a strong vertical, in the form of a tower or a tree, in the corners of each. (In the gables above the three arches Lorenzo Monaco has represented the “Noli me tangere,\" the “Resurrection,\" and the “Maries at the Sepulchre.\") The altarpiece depicts, at the center, Joseph of Arimathaea, Nicodemus, and the young Saint John the Evangelist, all haloes, lower the lifeless body of Christ. On the left stands a group of women; St. Mary Magdalene kisses the feet of Christ; the Virgin contemplates Him in a trance of sadness; on the right the disciples discuss the melancholy drama among themselves, while below, a kneeling saint holds his right hand to his breast and extends the left in a sorrowful wonder.\n\np.s. The young man kneeling in the foreground is believed to represent the Blessed Alessio degli Strozzi, a holy ancestor of Palla Strozzi, the humanist who commissioned this altarpiece for the sacristy of Santa Trinita. The gentleman in blue garment and black lid under the arm of Christ thought to be a self-portrait of the painter.\n\nPaintings for the Armadio degli Argenti “Scenes from the Life of Christ\" by Fra Angelico (1451-1452)—Fra Angelico was commissioned for a massive painted cabinet to protect the precious silver votive offerings at Santissima Annunziata, among the most venerable churches in Florence. p.s. In 1450, on the eve of the invention of movable type, relatively few people possessed their own bibles. The purpose of this superabundance of literary citations is clearly didactic: the Silver Treasury panels were destined to serve a large public as a kind of illustrated Bible, complete with all relevant texts.\n\nThe scenes on this panel are Mystic Wheel, Annunciation, Nativity, Circumcision, Adoration of the Magi, Presentation at the Temple, Flight into Egypt, Massacre of the Innocents and Christ among the Doctors.\n\nThe scenes on this panel are Carrying the Cross, Derobing of Christ, Crucifixion, Deposition, Descent into Limbo, Pious Women at the Tomb, Ascension, Pentecost, Last Judgment, Coronation of the Virgin and ‘Lex Amoris’.\n\nThe scenes on this panel are Raising of Lazarus, Entry into Jerusalem, Last Supper, Payment of Judas, Washing of the Feet, Institution of the Eucharist, Prayer in the Garden, Judas’s Betrayal, Capture of Christ, Christ before Caiafas, Mocking of Christ and Christ at the Column.\n\np.s. The Armadio degli Argenti (Silver Chest) may have been the most visible of the friar’s work by virtue of the site for which it was made. Santissima Annunziata was the motherhouse of the Servites, founded by St Filippo Benizzi (1233-1285), the only religious order that originated in Florence. The scarcity of the church was augmented further when, as legend recounted, an angel completed the fresco of the Annunciation in 1252. By the early 15th century, the Annunciation had become the centre of a major cult, receiving donations of precious silver. In the late 1440s, Michelozzo renovated Santissima Annunziata at the behest of Piero de’ Medici to accommodate the throngs of worshipers who flocked to behold the sacred image. To safeguard the silver offerings to the Annunciation, Piero commissioned a wooden cabinet, the movable shutters of which Fra Angelico painted. Angelico’s series depicting scenes from the life of Christ consisted of 40 paintings of equal size (38,5 x 37 cm) and one additional double-sized painting. From the 41 paintings 6 were lost during the centuries. From the 35 paintings conserved in the Museo di San Marco 3 can be attributed to Alessio Baldovinetti, all the others are the work of Fra Angelico.\n\nThe Tabernacle of the Linaioli is a marble aedicule designed by Lorenzo Ghiberti, with paintings by Fra Angelico (1432-1435)\n\nThe tabernacle was commissioned for the exterior of the seat of the Linaioli (the guild of line workers in Florence), in the former Old Market, in the October 1432. The marble parts were executed by Simone di Nanni da Fiesole, under design by Lorenzo Ghiberti. The contract for the internal paintings was signed by Angelico on 2 July 1433, for a total of 190 golden florins. It has been speculated that the marble frame was sized according to a pre-existing painting, which was later replaced by Fra Angelico’s, or that the size was inspired by that of the statues in Orsanmichele niches. The tabernacle is composed of a rectangular marble frame, with a triangular top with a sculpted almond depicting the “Blessing Christ and Cherubims\". In the center, within an arched opening, is Fra Angelico’s panel of the Maestà with twelve musician angels. Behind two draperies (perhaps a hint to the guild’s textile activities) is a ceiling painted in blue with stars and the Holy Spirit dove, which is similar to Masolino’s Annunciation in Washington, DC. At the front are two shutter panels with further paintings of saints. These are, internally, St. John the Baptist (left) and St. John the Evangelist (right); and externally St. Mark the Evangelist (left) and St. Peter (right). The panels are completed by a predella, placed below, with three scenes of St. Peter Dictating the Gospel to St. Mark, Adoration of the Magi and Martyrdom of St. Mark. The figure of Mark is recurrent due to his status as the patron of the corporation which commissioned the work. This tabernacle had been moved to the Palazzo della Borsa as early as 1777, together with other works commissioned by the city’s guilds. In that year it was transferred to the Uffizi, whence it was transferred to the current location in 1924. The tabernacle was restored in 2010.\n\nSaint Dominic Adoring the Crucifixion by Fra Angelico (1441-1442)—The fresco is situated in the Northern corridor, to left of the staircase accessing the upper floor. The fresco is enclosed in a later frame.\n\nThe figures are about half life size, the design similar to that which we have already seen in the cloister, but showing less ability. Nor are these the only Crucifixions which our artist painted. He has reproduced the subject in several cells, always varying either the attitude of the Saviour, or the persons who adore Him, but the serene attitude of the Son of God is unalterable. Without exaggerated contractions or violent action He remains fixed on the cross, His head bowed in mute contemplation of the figures below Him. These, on the contrary, are the prey of sorrow and despair; they cover their faces, or weep distractedly at His feet.\n\nFrom the Cloister of St. Antonino, a corridor on the north side gives access to a staircase leading to the upper dormitory and the rooms on the ground floor that made up the guest house, with the respective refectory.\n\nThe Dormitorio: Upstairs in the dormitory is where San Marco really shines. There are a great number of small frescoes by Angelico and his assistants in the monastic cells and a number of larger frescoes including the Annunciation.\n\nThe Annunciation by Fra Angelico (1438-1445)—Facing the entrance of the upper northern corridor of the cloister is the most famous work of art in the Museo San Marco: Fra Angelico’s Annunciation (聖告圖). Fra Angelico shows his mastery of perspective by placing Gabriel and the Virgin in an elaborate loggia, inspired by Michelozzo.\n\nUnder the arches between the Corinthian columns are the slender figures of the Madonna and of the angel in devout converse, regulated with the rhythm of gentle curves; in the background, on the left, the celestial fields with Tuscan cypresses; Gabriel’s wings stretch out like a rainbow. However, the lighting of the scene is curiously illogical; the interior of the arcaded loggia is evenly illuminated, despite the fairly strong light coming from the left.\n\nThe Medici chose the rising architect, Michelozzo di Bartolomeo to rebuild San Marco. The restoration proceeded with remarkable speed.\n\nThe twenty cells of the east corridor of the dormitory were built between late 1437 and 1438, when renovation of the church was begun.\n\nReconstruction continued sequentially, from the north corridor (left) for lay brothers and guests (1440-1441) to the south (right) for the novices (completed in 1442).\n\nEvery one of the monks’ cells on the upper floor has its own fresco. A stroll around each of the cells reveals snippets of many more fine religious reliefs by the Tuscan-born friar, who decorated the cells between 1440 and 1441 with deeply devotional frescoes to guide the meditation of his fellow friars. Most were executed by Fra’ Angelico himself; others are by aides under his supervision, including Benozzo Gozzoli.\n\nCells 12 to 14 were Savonarola’s plain rooms. Rising to the position of prior at the Dominican convent, it was from here that the fanatical monk railed against luxury, greed and corruption of the clergy. Kept as a kind of shrine to the turbulent priest, they house a portrait, a few personal items, the linen banner Savonarola carried in processions and a grand marble monument erected by admirers in 1873.\n\nCell 14: Painting of Savonarola’s execution in the Piazza della Signoria, on 23 May 1498 by Francesco Rosselli\n\np.s. From 1489, the Prior of the convent was Girolamo Savonarola, the inspiration and driving force behind the popular revolt of 1494, when the Medici were driven out of Florence and a Republican government with an extensive popular representation was set up in the city. In 1498, while in the convent of San Marco, Savonarola was captured by opponents within the government and was condemned to be burned at the stake in Piazza della Signoria.\n\nCell 22\n\nCell 35: Communion of the Apostles by Beato Angelico\n\nCells 38 and 39 were reserved for Cosimo il Vecchio when he retreated to the convent to find spiritual sustenance and peace.\n\nCell 39: The Adoration of the Magi and the Dead Christ (Vir Dolorum) by Beato Angelico and Benozzo Gozzoli\n\nThe Bibliotheca: On the upper floor, from the north corridor of the 15th century dormitories we enter the library constructed by Michelozzo on commission from Cosimo il Vecchio (1441). It is divided into three aisles, separated by columns with Ionic capitals and round arches; the central aisle has a barrel vault higher than the cross vaults of the side aisles. This was the first public library in Europe and contained many fine illuminated manuscripts donated by Cosimo himself.\n\n(http://www.museumsinflorence.com/musei/museum_of_san_marco.html)\n\nSmall Refectory/ Bookshop:\n\nThe Last Supper of San Marco by Domenico Ghirlandaio (1486), a reduced scale version of the Last Supper in the Church of Ognissanti\n\nThe supper takes place at a large table with a bright tablecloth, embroidered at the edges. Nothing about it is casual; the crockery, the decanters, the knives, the bread and the cherries, are carefully arranged in front of every guest. With customary ease, Ghirlandaio fills the lunettes with"
