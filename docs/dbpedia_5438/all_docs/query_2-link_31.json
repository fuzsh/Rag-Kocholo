        "text": "COVER PHOTO: Salone dei Cinquecento as seen from the rear balcony.\n\nPart 1 of these three related posts looked around the exterior of Florence’s Palazzo Vecchio. Part 2a gave some historical development outlining how the magnificent Salone dei Cinquecento (Hall of the Five Hundred) came into being. Here, Part 2b looks at some of the High Renaissance contents of the Hall.\n\nThis post is a continuation from Palazzo Vecchio (Part 2a, The Hall of the Five Hundred)\n\nSo, finally, let’s make our way to see the Salone dei Cinquecento!\n\nEntrance to the ground floor of the palazzo is open access (i.e. free to enter), as mentioned in our associated post, Palazzo Vecchio (Part 1, The Building), and consists of three courtyards. The first (redesigned by Michelozzo in 1453 and Ammannati in the 16th century) and the third (much more functional and prosaic) are open to the skies but the central courtyard is closed since, with massive late-15th century columns, its vaulted ceiling supports the floor of the Salone dei Cinquecento (Hall of the Five Hundred) above …\n\nBetween the first and second courtyards is the imposing and monumental staircase …\n\n… that leads to the sublime Salone dei Cinquecento …\n\n… the largest room in the palazzo at 54m (177ft) long, 23m (75ft) wide and 18m (59ft) high.\n\nAnd yes, if you think you recognise this hall, it might be just because you have seen the Dan Brown/Ron Howard film Inferno in which a secret agent comes crashing through the ceiling (not possible since the panels of the ceiling are solid wood!) onto the floor 59 ft below.\n\nOn making then-named Palazzo della Signoria into his family home, Cosimo I de’ Medici was determined to add something a little more ‘homely’ to the austere government building – and something that reflected the power and the majesty of the Medici, especially in terms of maintaining the link between the House of Medici and the patronage of the Arts and Humanities in the High Renaissance. For this task Cosimo employed the services of renowned artist and architect, Giorgio Vasari.\n\nAmong his many changes, Vasari increased the grandeur of Savonarola’s Hall of the Five Hundred by increasing its height by having it take up two floors-worth of the building …\n\nAt the raised business end of the hall, from where proclamations were made and the main members of the Council sat – an end that naturally had the attention of the 500 in attendance – what better place to install statues of some of the luminaries of the Medici family …\n\n.. taking centre stage here is Bandinelli‘s statue of Pope Leo X …\n\n… pope from 1513 to 1531, son of Lorenzo de’ Medici (Lorenzo the Magnificent) and related to Cosimo I through the broader Medici family tree.\n\nRoman statues as well of those of other prominent Medici adorn niches around the Hall including further works by Bandinelli, including Alessandro il Moro, Giovanni delle Bande Nere and, of course, Cosimo I himself dressed in classical Roman attire …\n\nBandinelli’s Medici statues are here in auspicious company with six of Vincenzo de’ Rossi‘s statues of the “Labours of Hecules” …\n\n… Giambologna’s gesso statue of “Florence Triumphant over Pisa” (1565) commissioned by Francesco de’ Medici (the corresponding marble sculpture is in the Bargello Museum) …\n\n… and Michelangelo’s “Genius of Victory” (c. 1530-1534), standing halfway along the east wall …\n\nMichelangelo’s statue, originally destined to adorn the tomb of Pope Julius II (several other unfinished statues for the tomb can be seen in the Accademia in the same hall as Michelangelo’s David), is also an unfinished work (especially the left side) that was still in Michelangelo’s workshop when he died. This passed into the hands of his nephew, Leonardo Buonarotti and it was Giorgio Vasari who convinced the nephew to donate the work to Duke Cosimo I for it to stand exactly where it stands today – in celebration of Duke Cosimo’s victory over Siena, as depicted in Vasari’s painting on the wall above.\n\nAh yes, the east and west walls!\n\nBy August 1512, Savonarola’s precious Republican furnishings had already been removed and the hall sectioned off into separate rooms. The major changes had to wait until after 1563 when the Republican coffered ceiling was removed and destroyed by Vasari.\n\nAt the same time, the whole roof was removed, extending the walls skyward, now over two floors, by another seven metres (23ft) – so allowing a vast expanse of wall space on which to emblazon in paint the greatness of the Medici war machine.\n\nAt the request of Cosimo, who wanted to celebrate Florence’s (ie the Medici’s) victories over Siena and Pisa, Vasari (and assistants) was commissioned to fresco the walls with panels displaying notable episodes from these wars.\n\nThe west wall shows scenes from the 13-year war with Pisa, stretching over 33m in length and 7.6m high. These are (from left to right), The defeat of the Pisans at the Tower of San Vincenzo, The Lifting of the Siege of Livorno from Maximilian of Austria and Pisa attacked by Florentine troops …\n\nThe similarly-dimensioned east wall’s frescoes illustrates the wars with Siena showing Taking of Fort Porta Camollia, Conquest of Port Ercole and The Battle of Marciano …\n\nNow it’s the Battle of Marciano, here on the right, that contains a mystery. High up within the painting there is a pennant (circled) …\n\n… upon which is written “Cerca trova” – He who seeks, finds.\n\nNow Vasari could have just put this here as an allusion to a passage in Dante’s Divine Comedy …\n\nHe goes in search of freedom, which is so dear,\n\nAs he who gives his life for it would know.\n\n(Purgatorio, Canto I, 70–72)\n\n… or it might have related to these paintings reflecting the glory of Cosimo’s success in battles and, as such, is just a piece of political propaganda (but if so, why up so high that it could not be read from floor level?). Or perhaps …\n\nGiorgio Vasari was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci and his work. In 1504, during the first Medici interregnum and fifty years before Vasari’s work, Leonardo and Michelangelo were commissioned to paint opposite walls within the Hall depicting successful Florentine battle scenes.\n\nLeonardo was to paint the East Wall and chose to depict a scene from the Battle of Anghiari (see our post, Anghiari and the Lost Leonardo) …\n\nUnfortunately, Leonardo, ever the innovator, tried a process that failed him (the encaustic process), soon after which he gave up. Leonardo’s work remained on the wall for some fifty years, until Vasari was commissioned to fresco the walls of the enlarged hall. During some restoration work on the Battle of Marciano it was discovered that Vasari’s work was painted on a wall a centimetre or two in front of a wall behind. Through cracks in Vasari’s painting it was possible to place probes that could detect that on the wall behind there were traces of artists’ paint, including a black pigment that was particularly associated with Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nSo could it be that Vasari, a known fan of Leonardo, was not able to bring himself to fresco over work (no matter in how poor a state) of his High Renaissance ‘superstar’ – and just left a tantalising “Cerca Trova” to beguile us all?\n\nWhatever the reality, it was decided that Vasari’s work would not be destroyed just in the hopes that lurking behind his fresco, there was an-albeit-failed ‘Lost Leonardo’.\n\nAnd then there is the ceiling!\n\nMuch of the ceiling is composed of three coffered bands each containing seven wooden panels. The band adjoining and parallel with the East Wall reflects scenes below of the War with Pisa (1494-1509). That adjoining and parallel with the West Wall relates to the scenes below from the War with Siena (1554-1555).\n\nThe central band reflects the history of Florence from 70BC to 1434. Here from the central band is Vasari’s tondo showing the allegories of two of the four historical districts of Florence: Santa Croce and Santo Spirito. On the two shields are visible the Cross, the symbol of Santa Croce, and the Dove with golden rays, the symbol of Santo Spirito …\n\nBut …\n\n… pride of place in the centre of the ceiling has to go to he who commissioned most of this work …\n\n… here portrayed being crowned by Florence, surrounded by the Coats of Arms of the City and Coats of Arms of the Guilds …\n\n… Cosimo I de’ Medici\n\nDuke of Florence, Grand Duke of Tuscany.\n\nThe Salone dei Cinquecento certainly draws from the viewer standing beneath and within, wonderment and awe at the magnitude and complexity of Vasari’s work and that of his High Renaissance peers.\n\nIt HAS to be on your ‘bucket’ list!\n\nShould you wish to visit the upper floors of the Palazzo, including the Salone, then tickets can be bought within the central, covered courtyard. However, do note that this is a functional, working building, the seat of the city council, so may at odd times be closed for special civic occasions.\n\nAs well as the ticket office, the central courtyard also contains an Information Point, a Bookshop, a cloakroom and a Lift.\n\nTimes of entry and prices can be found here.\n\nCiao Tutti!\n\nCOVER PHOTO: Palazzo Veccio photographed from Via del Monte alle Croci\n\nPart 1 of these three related posts looked around the exterior of Florence’s Palazzo Vecchio. Here, Part 2a moves inside the building, with some historical development outlining how the magnificent Salone dei Cinquecento (Hall of the Five Hundred) came into being. Moving on, Part 2b looks at some of the High Renaissance contents of the Hall.\n\nWith its tall tower seemingly standing guard over Florence’s Historic Centre and its crenelated battlements, Palazzo Vecchio seems to be the very essence of a defensive fortress …\n\nHowever, once inside, it is nothing less than a sumptuous palazzo with grand halls, apartments and chapels beautifully decorated by some of the most famous Renaissance artists of the 15th and 16th centuries, including Michelangelo, Donatello, Ghirlandaio, Bronzino, Botticelli and Vasari – there might also be a hidden Leonardo lurking in there somewhere! (More in Part 2b)\n\nSorry, but here comes a smidgen of historical context …\n\nThe completed palazzo can be seen from the Buonsignori Map of 1594 …\n\n… or from the wooden model of Florence …\n\nCommissioned in 1299, it took some fifteen years to complete the first phase of construction, consisting of the main body of the palazzo and the iconic Arnolfo Tower …\n\n… providing Florence with both a functional and defensive government building which included large meeting rooms and smaller administrative offices.\n\nAdorned with battlements, this austere fortified building reflected the political turmoil at the time – a time when Florence’s politics was dominated by two opposing factions: the Guelphs (supporting the Pope) and the Ghibellines (supporters of the Holy Roman Emperor). The year 1300 was the time when Dante Alighieri was elected as one of Florence’s six priors – those who ruled as supreme magistrates – and some years before the rise to prominence of the then embryonic Medici dynasty.\n\nThrough the late 1300s and 1400s during the rise to power of the Medici, various additions and modifications were made to the original structure as the palazzo increased its footprint beyond the original fortified building.\n\nIn 1494, the by-then-powerful Medici were expelled from Florence. This began an 18 year interregnum from Medici rule and the introduction of a new theocratic republic under the control of religious firebrand, Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola, who had partly orchestrated the Medici downfall. During his short rule, peppered with heavily political sermons, items of earthly pleasure such as musical instruments, cosmetics, books, statues, poetry, paintings were burned in what was named the Bonfire of the Vanities. Unfortunately, Savonarola himself fell foul to the same fate when he was charged with heresy and sedition by the pope and held in a small cell (the Alberghetto) in the Arnolfo Tower, only to be hanged and burned on a pyre just outside, in front of the Palazzo Vecchio on the 23 May 1498 …\n\nSo then, why the History Lesson?\n\nWell, the Salone dei Cinquecento (Hall of the Five Hundred) was constructed during the Republic of Savonarola and completed in just seven months from July 1495 to February 1496 …\n\nIt was commissioned by Savonarola himself, who wanted it as the seat of a decentralised Consiglio Maggiore (Great Council) – made up of more than 1500 citizens, who met in succession of 500 members at a time. In this way, Savonarola was successful in spreading power across the populace, rather than having ultimate power in the hands of a single person, as had been the case when the Medici were in control.\n\nIn line with Savonarola’s deeply religious beliefs, the Hall was frugal with little or no decoration. In terms of size, the floor area was the same as that seen today, but the ceiling was much lower.\n\nNow move forward to 1512 when the Medici were reinstated as rulers of Florence and then on to 1527 when an anti-Medici faction took back control, providing Florence with a second Medici interregnum – this time for just three years, meaning by 1530 they were back! By 1537 a 17-year-old Cosimo I de’Medici gained power and by 1540 Cosimo, now firmly in control, moved his family home into the the very heart of government, the Palazzo Vecchio (or Palazzo della Signoria, as it was then known) …\n\n… and it was Cosimo I de’ Medici who was instrumental in changing the Salone dei Cinquecento and the remainder of the palazzo into what we see today.\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF PALAZZO VECCHIO\n\nOrange/Yellow — Original building and Arnolfo Tower (1299 – 1314)\n\nGreen — First extension (1343 – 1346)\n\nBlue/Grey — The Salone dei Cinquecento of 1496 with changes and embellishments by Giorgio Vasari and Bartolomeo Ammannati (1540 – 1565)\n\nRed — The East Wing was built around the same time as the Salone dei Cinquecento but enhanced, including apartments for the Medici, by Bartolomeo Ammannati and Giorgio Vasari after 1540. Continued enhancements and modifications were made in the late 1500s and 1600s by Grand Duke Francesco I de’ Medici and his successors. These changes included the creation of more private apartments and artistic decorations.\n\nCertainly, the whole structure was more or less complete by the time of the Buonsignori (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) Map of 1594 (as shown above).\n\nEnd of History Lesson!\n\nSo, finally, let’s make our way to see inside the Salone dei Cinquecento with its associated art treasures!\n\nThis post continues in Palazzo Vecchio (Part 2b, The Hall of the Five Hundred) …\n\nShould you wish to visit the upper floors of the Palazzo, including the Salone, then tickets can be bought within the central, covered courtyard. However, do note that this is a functional, working building, the seat of the city council, so may at odd times be closed for special civic occasions.\n\nAs well as the ticket office, the central courtyard also contains an Information Point, a Bookshop, a cloakroom and a Lift.\n\nTimes of entry and prices can be found here.\n\nCiao Tutti!\n\nCOVER PHOTO: View from the Piazzale Michelangelo of the Historic Centre of Florence\n\nThe Torre Arnolfo, the tower of Florence’s iconic Palazzo Vecchio (left), stands proud above the rooftops of the Centro Storico, along with the equally iconic Cathedral with its famous Brunelleschi Dome and beyond and slightly to the left, the smaller dome of the Chapel of the Princes.\n\nNOTE Palazzo Vecchio consists of three posts: Part 1 (here, looking at the exterior) and Part 2a & Part 2b, which investigate both the historical development and the contents of the Salone dei Cinquecento (Hall of the Five Hundred).\n\nAt 95m (312ft) high, Palazzo Vecchio‘s tower stands as the highest civic building in Florence and for over 700 years has been the symbol of civil power within the city …\n\nPalazzo Vecchio is located near the Arno River …\n\n… on the east side of the Piazza della Signoria …\n\n… with surroundings that form an open-air sculpture gallery …\n\nThe palazzo has taken several names during its existence. Built at the turn of the 14th century as Florence’s Town Hall, it was known originally as the Palazzo della Signoria (basically Palace of the Lord Protector). However, over time and with different uses it was also known as the Palazzo del Popolo, Palazzo dei Priori and Palazzo Ducale. It was only after Cosimo I de’ Medici moved his residence from here across to Palazzo Pitti did he rename the building as Palazzo Vecchio (the Old Palace).\n\nA palazzo had already existed here before 1299 when it was decided to build the current fortified residence/government offices under the auspices of architect, Arnolfo di Cambio, over previously destroyed towers. One such watchtower built on the site, the Guardingo tower, dated from the Lombard period (8th/9th centuries) in Florence. These towers themselves were built upon the remains of a large 1st century BCE Roman Theatre (capacity of up to 15,000) in what was the Roman colony of Florentia. These archaeological remains, first excavated in 1876, can be visited down the stairs beneath Palazzo Vecchio (there is a charge) …\n\nIts exact size and location can be seen from the following model, with a wire-frame outline of the current position of the Palazzo Vecchio superimposed …\n\nCambio’s Palazzo Vecchio is a mix of Romanesque, Gothic and later Renaissance styles, with the latter style having contributions from artist and architect, Giorgio Vasari in the 16th century.\n\nThe rustic building, comprised of unevenly-cut stone, has two rows of Gothic double windows surmounted by trefoil arches in between which Michelozzi added bas reliefs of a cross and the Florentine Lily in the 15th century …\n\nThe main part of the building is topped by crenelated battlements that project beyond the lines of the building below, supported by corbels with small Romanesque arches between …\n\nUnder these arches there is a repeated series of nine painted coats of arms of the Florentine Republic …\n\nThe top of the tower has a similar arched and corbelled arrangement, but here the crenelations are of the ‘swallow-tail’ type and the arches between the corbels are in a pointed Gothic style …\n\nIt is possible that the difference in the crenelations here is because the current tower rests on a pre-existing tower-house that was once part of the ancient Palazzo Foraboschi – and has maintained that style. The position of the earlier tower-house certainly accounts for the asymmetrical positioning of the tower above the Palazzo Vecchio itself.\n\nThe climb to the top of the tower (246 stone steps, of which 233 are ‘steep’ steps – not for the fainthearted!) certainly affords many different fabulous views of Florence. Here the view is down to the roof of the Loggia dei Lanzi, which serves as an open-air restaurant/café for the Uffizi Galleries, and the Piazza della Signoria …\n\nClimbing the steps to the top takes you past a small cell, the Alberghetto (the ‘small hotel’!) and past a significant part of Florentine history. Amongst other prisoners incarcerated here within the Alberghetto, two notables were Cosimo the Elder (before being exiled in 1433) and Girolamo Savanorola (before being hanged and burned in the Piazza below in 1498).\n\nThe (single) clock on the Torre Arnolfo was the first public clock to be installed anywhere in Florence …\n\nIt was designed by Florentine watchmaker, Niccolò di Bernardo, and installed in 1353. However, this was replaced with an exact replica made by George Lederle from Augsburg and installed by pupil of Galileo, Vincenzo Viviani, in 1667 – a clock that remains functional today.\n\nThe asymmetrically-placed, unpretentious ‘front door’ is guarded by a copy of Michelangelo’s David placed here in 1910 (the original now being one of the most popular tourist attractions in the Accademia) and Bandinelli’s Hercules and Cacus …\n\nThe ground-floor of the Palazzo Vecchio is open access and free to enter.\n\nOnce inside, a glimpse back outside reveals to one side across in the Loggia dei Lanzi, Cellini’s Perseus with the Head of Medusa and, to the other, the back side (literally) of Michelangelo’s David …\n\nOnce inside …\n\n… the first courtyard opens out …\n\nThe surrounding walls in here are adorned with vedute paintings from 1565 by Giorgio Vasari of major Austrian cities. This was at the time when Francesco I de’ Medici married Archduchess Johanna of Austria and were intended to make the Archduchess ‘feel at home’.\n\nThe central fountain is surmounted by a sculpture of a Putto (cherub) holding a Dolphin …\n\nThis is a copy of a work by Andrea del Verrocchio (1476) of which Verrocchio’s original can be seen displayed on the second floor of the palazzo.\n\nOnce inside this courtyard, look up …\n\nA 360o view around this courtyard can be seen here (Accessed 09/07/2024).\n\nThrough the second courtyard, passing Vasari’s staircase up to the Salone dei Cinquecento (more of which in Part 2 of these Palazzo Vecchio posts), leads out into the third courtyard, in the centre of which is a rampant lion …\n\nThis sculpture is a 20th century incarnation that first appeared in the Palazzo Vecchio‘s third courtyard in July 2023. At the feet of the lion lies a decapitated Roman dressed in a toga. The decapitated head is within the lion’s mouth and is about to be crushed. The symbolism here represents the clash between epochs separated by two millennia – here the 20th century lion aggressively destroys the 2nd century BCE civilisation.\n\nA 360o view around the third courtyard (without the lion!) can be seen here (Accessed 09/07/2024).\n\nSee you in Part 2a and Part 2b, when we head inside the palazzo to the Salone dei Cinquecento (Hall of the Five Hundred).\n\nCiao Tutti!\n\nPerhaps you have walked from the Ufizzi Gallery in Florence through the lower arcade (to the right in the above photograph) …\n\n… alongside the Arno River to the Ponte Vecchio …\n\n… perhaps not realising that in this structure, above your heads is another, ‘secret’, passageway …\n\n… that was built at the request of Duke Cosimo I de’ Medici (1519-1574) in 1565 …\n\nSo what’s the story?\n\nBear with, while all the pieces that constitute the reason for the existence of the Vasari Corridor are here assembled …\n\nPrior to 1540, the official Medici residence in Florence was the Palazzo Medici on the Via Larga. However, in 1540 the then Medici ruler and Duke of Florence, Cosimo I (in 1569 becoming the Grand Duke of Tuscany), decided living in a more strategic location from which to rule Florence would be the already 250-year-old Palazzo della Signoria in Florence’s Centro Storico (Historic Centre). Some years later, Cosimo I and family moved residence again, this time to the Palazzo Pitti on the other side of the Arno River, whereupon the Palazzo della Signoria was renamed by Cosimo as the Palazzo Vecchio (the Old Palace), a name that it retains to this day …\n\nWhile the Medici were well-connected, they were fundamentally bankers made good. They were not of noble birth. In order to extend the aggrandisement of the House of Medici and to enhance the power of their recently acquired ducal status, in 1539 Cosimo married the 17-year-old Eleanor of Toledo (1522-1562). Eleanor was the daughter of Pedro Álvarez de Toledo, the Viceroy of Naples, and the third cousin of Emperor Charles V, King of Spain and Archduke of Austria – Eleanor was of noble birth. At the time, Spain was in control of Florence, so the marriage to Eleanor offered Cosimo the opportunity to show allegiance to Spain, whilst at the same time mixing Medici blood with the blue blood of European royalty.\n\nWith the large dowry provided by her father on her marriage to Cosimo, Eleanor had sufficient wealth to buy Palazzo Pitti in 1549. Initially a summer retreat, the palazzo later became a family home suitable to bring up their eleven children (although only eight survived to maturity) in the fresh air of what was then countryside …\n\nPalazzo Pitti‘s location across the river away from the bustling city centre position meant that extensions and enlargements to the palazzo (made by Arezzo-born artist and architect Giorgio Vasari) were possible, so doubling the size of the new Medici home – making it much larger and grander than the Palazzo Vecchio (whose position in the Centro Storico meant extensions were not possible) and so more befitting of a Spanish noblewoman.\n\nOn the purchase of Palazzo Pitti, Eleanor embellished home life for Cosimo and her family by enhancing the land behind the palace on the Boboli Hill, creating in 1550 parkland and large Italian-style formal gardens covering 111 acres (45 hectares), the ‘Boboli Gardens’ – again something that could not be created at the Palazzo Vecchio …\n\nUpon the family’s relocation in 1560 to the Pitti Palace as their new residence, Palazzo Vecchio‘s main raison d’être was to become the seat of government.\n\nBy 1560, Cosimo had commissioned Giorgio Vasari to commence work designing and building a set of offices beside the Palazzo Vecchio to consolidate power and administrative control in one small area. These offices (or uffici in Italian) are what we know today as the Uffizi …\n\n… here below, viewed from within the Uffizi Gallery, looking back towards the Palazzo Vecchio, with the Piazzale degli Uffizi below and an ‘arm’ of the Uffizi on each side …\n\nSo, the pieces are all in place.\n\nCan you see Cosimo’s problem?\n\nAt a time when the Medici had not long since restored, wrested even, their power from the ruling council of the third Florentine Republic and at a time when political assassinations were not unusual, Cosimo was reluctant to openly walk amongst the public on the streets and across the Ponte Vecchio between his residence at Palazzo Pitti and the government buildings of the Palazzo Vecchio and the Uffizi.\n\nIn order to avoid walking amongst the hoi-polloi, Cosimo commissioned his architect, Giorgio Vasari, to design a passageway that would allow the Duke to walk unnoticed between his home and his workplace. Vasari’s design was to take Cosimo all the way between the two end palazzi above street level!\n\nThis elevated passageway was to become known as the\n\nVasari Corridor\n\nAt the Palazzo Vecchio end, Vasari made an opening in the side of the palazzo on the second floor out from Eleonor’s apartment to bridge the narrow Via della Ninna below, taking the other end of this bridge into the north end of the Uffizi buildings …\n\nThe corridor passes through the Uffizi, exiting as a corridor above street level across the Lungarno degli Archibusieri\n\n… before making an immediate right turn along and above the Lungarno degli Archibusieri …\n\nAt the corner of the Lungarno degli Archibusieri and the Ponte Vecchio there is a plaque on the wall above the archway…\n\nNow the corridor takes an immediate left turn to cross over the Ponte Vecchio …\n\nJust as now, filled with tourists, in the 16th century Ponte Vecchio was thronged with people going about their daily lives. Unfortunately for Cosimo, the bridge was the shortest route between his home and his workplace! Fortunately, in the Vasari Corridor he was above it all and could pass unnoticed by the rag-tag populace below …\n\nSpeaking of which …\n\nBefore the Vasari Corridor, The Ponte Vecchio housed butcher shops from one end to the other – well, it was convenient to throw the waste cuts over the side of the bridge into the river. But the smell …! The smell wafting up into the Grand Duke’s Corridor would have been unbearable for such refined noses, so all butcher shops were removed from the bridge and replaced by less-malodorous jewellery shops.\n\nEven today, over 400-years later, both sides of the Ponte Vecchio are still lined with jewellery (and trumpery!) shops …\n\nThe eastern, upstream, inland, side of the Vasari Corridor over the Ponte Vecchio has larger windows …\n\n… than the smaller porthole windows on the west, downstream, side …\n\nThe story is that these windows were small since their main role was to spot enemies approaching Florence by boat from the coast. The larger windows looked in a direction where there was less of a threat, so were bigger to allow more light, especially the morning sun, to enter the Corridor. Apocryphal maybe, but then why are there three large windows on that small-window side?\n\nHowever, not apocryphal is the story behind the the three large windows. In 1938, Mussolini was expecting a visit from Adolf Hitler in order to seal the mutual Rome-Berlin pact. Naturally, he wanted to impress his visitor with the grandeur that was Florence. Where better then than the Vasari Corridor. In order to maximise the view down the Arno, he had the three large, panoramic, windows installed from where Florence, the Arno and its bridges could best be seen and best impress …\n\nThe irony here is that, despite being impressed, Hitler’s retreating army blew up all Florence’s bridges across Arno in 1944 to stop the advancement of the Allies – apart from the Ponte Vecchio and the Vasari Corridor – ah, except, that is, for each end of the bridge which was reduced to rubble so no vehicles could cross, or even gain access to the bridge …\n\nGaining his power from wealth gave Cosimo almost carte blanche to construct his Corridor however and wherever. On the bridge at the time there were four towers belonging to (not as rich or as powerful) Florentine families, who were easily bought out and whose towers were demolished as the Corridor ploughed through. That is, except for one! At the south-east corner of the bridge stood the Manelli Tower. The Torre dei Manelli owners refused to comply with Cosimo’s wishes so Vasari had to dog-leg the Corridor around their tower …\n\n.. from where the Corridor passes across the Via de’ Bardi …\n\n… which, needless to say, is a reconstruction following the destruction of each end of the bridge during the Second World War.\n\nFrom here the Corridor snakes its way across the Oltrarno district of Florence over and through houses and across the Piazza Santa Felicita, before finding itself obscuring the façade of the Chiesa di Santa Felicita …\n\nTaking advantage of this position, Vasari opened up the side of the Corridor into the church, placing a balcony where the Medici family could take part in the church services without being seen by the people below …\n\nFrom the Uffizi there was no entrance or exit for Cosimo until the grey door here below, next to the Grotta del Buontalenti in the Boboli Gardens …\n\nOriginally the position of the Grotto marked the area where an aqueduct brought a water supply to the Pitti Palace, However, in the 1580s, Artist and Architect, but also Stage and theatrical designer, Buontalenti, took the already existing structure and ‘(over?)ornamented’ it to become the Grotto as seen today …\n\nSharp-eyed readers may have recognised the two front statues here as two of Michelangelo’s unfinished Prisoners (or Slaves), which upon the death of Michelangelo, were donated to Cosimo I de’ Medici and placed by Bernardo Buontalenti in the Grotto in 1583 according to the wishes of Grand Duke Francesco I, who had succeeded his father, Cosimo I …\n\nIn 1908, however, Michelangelo’s four Slaves in the Grotto were transferred to the Accademia Gallery, and now stand in the Hall of the Prisoners with Michelangelo’s David – while in the Grotto the originals were replaced with concrete replicas.\n\nWhile the Corridor was open to groups of visitors, the exit next to the Grotto at the Pitti Palace end of the Corridor was the exit that they had to use .\n\nHowever, the exit next to the Grotto was not the end of Vasari’s Corridor for Cosimo and family …\n\n… no, for Cosimo, the Corridor continued the short distance into the Pitti Palace itself, ending in the palazzo‘s gallery – this section of the Corridor has not been accessible to the public up to now (but see access details at the end of this post) …\n\nAlthough a practical project for Cosimo, facilitating his 750-metre pedestrian-free passage across Florence between the palazzi of home and of work, Vasari’s Corridor is also seen as something of a vanity project. Such a grand undertaking was designed to impress …\n\n… and to further cement the power of the Medici over Florence.\n\nACCESS DETAILS:\n\nThe Corridor has been closed for some time for refurbishment, but is supposed to have opened on 27 May 2024. This was the anniversary date of the damage to the Corridor from the 1993 car-bombing in the Via dei Georgofili beneath the beginning of the external part of the Corridor near the Uffizi.\n\nHowever, 27 May 2024 passed by without a reopening, despite the help of a US foundation donating $1 million to help complete the restoration work begun in 2021. Restoration was not the only end-goal, the overall safety of visitors has been achieved through architectural reinforcements, the addition of lifts and paved floors to increase accessibility and the introduction of emergency exits and removal of flammable materials en route. The comprehensive, but flammable, collection of portrait paintings that hung there previously are to be replaced by Greek and Roman marble epigraphs.\n\nOn 2 July 2024, the director of the Uffizi Galleries stated that the first section will reopen by late autumn 2024, with everything open by the end of the year.\n\nPlease check the Uffizi web site for any details.\n\nA great three-dimensional map of the Vasari Corridor can be found on the Florence with Flair website (Accessed 02/07/24).\n\nClick on their pictures of the maps to enlarge them.\n\nA one-minute fly-through video of the empty interior of the Corridor can be viewed on YouTube here. (Accessed 29/06/24)\n\nCiao Tutti!\n\nOne cannot deny the power, profligacy and hubris of the Medici.\n\nThis was a family that came from humble beginnings but rose to power through their banking wealth. They held sway over Florence, and eventually the whole of Tuscany, from when Cosimo the Elder rose to power in 1434, until the last Medici ruler, Gian Gastone de’ Medici, died without an heir in 1737. It was a ‘humble’ family that, over three centuries, produced four popes (Leo X, Clement VII, Pius IV, and Leo X), seven grand dukes of Tuscany (from 1569 to 1737), and who married into many European royal families.\n\nBefore describing the unbelievable opulence of the Chapel of the Princes, it is worth outlining how this one family had achieved so much wealth and power …\n\nIt was Giovanni di Bicci de’ Medici (1360-1429) who established the Banco Medici (Medici Bank) at the end of the 14th century …\n\n… a bank that was, in its heyday, to become the 15th century’s largest and most respected bank in Europe. During this time the bank introduced innovative practices, still used in modern finance today, such as Double-Entry Bookkeeping, Letters of Credit (providing a secure method of transferring funds across borders) and Holding Companies.\n\nAfter Giovanni’s demise in 1429, the bank was was taken to its reign of greatest profitability and extension throughout Europe by his son, Cosimo di Giovanni de’ Medici (1389-1464) …\n\n… making the Medici the wealthiest family in Europe during the Renaissance. With immense wealth comes power. Cosimo moved into politics establishing the charisma of the Medici, eventually rising to become the leader of the Florentine Republic. By then, the family had amassed a large fortune that helped Cosimo maintain power in Florence.\n\nBut by the end of the 15th century, with the French invasion of Italy of 1494 under the leadership of King Charles VIII of France, the bank, which for some time had been in decline, collapsed – but not before the Medici had attained a vast array of riches, land and power.\n\nWith their wealth and power, the Medici dynasty became great patrons of the Arts and Humanities and were among the ultimate movers-and-shakers in the rise of Florence to cultural prominence during the High Renaissance. Their patronage extended to many great artists, architects and scientists who were either native to Tuscany or drawn to Florence through the Medici patronage. These included (amongst many!): Ghiberti, Brunelleschi, Donatello, Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo and Michelangelo. Quite a line-up!\n\nThe House of Medici, not averse to a touch of hubris, capitalised on their patronage of Arts and Humanities to promote their grandeur and power. As such, there was a requirement for the family to have their own church in Florence, the official church of the Medici, …\n\n… San Lorenzo …\n\n… which was commissioned with the financial support of the Medici family’s wealth by Cosimo in 1419 and designed by Brunelleschi (1377 –1446). It took from 1422 to the 1490s to complete (although essentially completed by 1459), with delays in intervening periods due to financial challenges and political turmoil.\n\nThe small dome seen on the right (above) covers the Segrestia Nuova (New Sacristy) designed and adorned by Michelangelo and constructed in the 16th century. The equivalent sacristy on the opposite side of the church, the Segrestia Vecchia (Old Sacristy), was designed and built by Brunelleschi between 1421 and 1440, and was adorned internally by Donatello. The Old Sacristy houses the tomb of the Medici bank founder, Giovanni di Bicci de’ Medici, together with his wife, Piccarda Bueri.\n\nBoth the Old and New Sacristies are covered in our posts, Brunelleschi’s ‘Old’ Sacristy of San Lorenzo, Florence and Michelangelo’s ‘New’ Sacristy of San Lorenzo, Florence.\n\nHowever …\n\n… the LARGE dome in the above photograph covers what can only be described as a ‘super apse‘ – this is the Capella dei Principi (Chapel of the Princes) …\n\n… a dome second only in the Florence skyline to the dome of Florence Cathedral designed and built by Brunelleschi …\n\nWhile most ecclesiastical buildings have a ‘small’ semi-circular apse behind the altar, here the apse is a chapel in its own right …\n\nPassing through the entrance leads visitors directly into the vaulted crypt, holding the mortal remains of three-centuries worth of major and minor Medici (about 50 in total), including, amongst others, the second Duke of Florence, Cosimo I (1519-1574), Grand Duke Cosimo II (1590-1621), Prince Lorenzo (1492-1519), Cardinal Leopoldo (1617-1675).\n\nAlso to be found buried in the crypt is the final lineal descendant of the Medici Grand Dukes, Anna Maria Luisa de’ Medici, who died childless in 1743 at the age of 76. In order to avoid the sale and dispersion of the Medici heritage, Anna Maria’s will left most of the Medici possessions to the safekeeping of the city of Florence. These remain virtually intact to this day. Think on this as you visit the artworks in the Ufizzi Gallery, the Pitti Palace and elsewhere in the city. Anna Maria also willed sufficient funds to ensure the completion of the Medici Chapels here at San Lorenzo. As well as her mortal remains resting here, a recent bronze commemorative statue by Alfonso Boninsigni (1910-2003) of Anna Maria stands in the crypt near her tomb …\n\nAscending from the crypt leads either to the Segrestia Nuova, or to the overpowering magnificence and blinding grandeur of The Chapel of the Princes (itself a hubristic misnomer since no high-flying Medici was ever a prince, only ever rising to become Grand Dukes!) …\n\nHere, Baroque architect Matteo Nigetti (ca. 1560-1648) in a collaboration with, and based on designs by, Don Giovanni de’ Medici (1567-1621), was entrusted with supervising the construction. The chapel contains an opulent and sumptuous interior (which took almost two centuries to complete) almost entirely encrusted with marble, rare pietre dure (semi-precious stones) and bronze statues, making it a grand mausoleum promoting and celebrating the hegemony, wealth and glory of the Medici Grand Dukes …\n\n… while at the same time taking mausoleum design to a new level of ostentation!\n\nIts origins may have been conceived in the Renaissance, commissioned by Cosimo I in 1568, but it was completed in a flourish of exuberant Baroque architectural detail in the following century. Nigetti started work on the immense octagonal single structure mausoleum in 1604, personally completing his work 36 years later in 1640.\n\nIts internal dimensions measure 28 metres (92 feet) from each side to the opposite, ascending to a height of 59 metres (194 feet) into the cupola …\n\n… where the altar’s centrepiece in hard stones shows the Supper at Emmaus (painted by many artists elsewhere, but none so brilliantly as that painted by Caravaggio) …\n\nThe walls, floor and ceiling of the chapel were designed to be completely inlaid with thin veneers of different-coloured marble and semi-precious stones courtesy of the Opificio delle pietre dure (Workshop of semi-precious stones), a workshop instituted by Ferdinando I de’ Medici in 1588 specifically for this task, but still in operation today.\n\nWhile much work was completed, the demise of the last of the Medici after 1743 left the interior of the dome, in fact the whole chapel itself, unfinished. Originally the dome’s interior was to be entirely covered with lapis lazuli, but with no further Medici money for such an expensive outlay, the dome was instead frescoed by Pietro Benvenuti as ‘recently’ as 1828, featuring scenes from the Old and New Testaments depicting themes such as the last judgment, creation, death, resurrection, …\n\nHowever, no expense seems to have been spared on the smooth, uniform floor inlays, an intricate mosaic of marbles and hardstones begun in 1874 and finished only as recently as 1962 …\n\n… while not forgetting to incorporate the Medici crest (even in the floor!) …\n\nThe walls are also fully finished with stone mosaics of coloured marbles to produce a highly decorative effect …\n\nSet into the dado …\n\n…are the coats-of-arms of Florence and the Tuscan cities that were under Medici control, including:\n\nThe artistry of the stone workers can be seen in the intricacy of their marquetry …\n\n… and perhaps you can make out the materials inlaid that contribute to these complex portrayals: mother-of-pearl, lapis lazuli, coral, alabaster, quartz …\n\nThis Florentine marquetry of making pictures and decorating architecture, perfected in the Optificio, even went under its own name, ‘commesso fiorentino‘ (Florentine mosaic) – or ‘commesso in pietre dure‘ (mosaics of semi-precious stones).\n\nBut let us not forget why we are here …\n\n… this whole structure (including the crypt and the New Sacristy) were built to glorify the Medici dynasty by providing a sumptuous resting place, the largest of mausoleums, for the good and not-so-good members of the family.\n\nNow while other members of the household have their tombs in the crypt or the two Sacristies, the intention here in the Chapel of the Princes was to provide the ultimate resting place commensurate with the importance of the Medici Grand Dukes. As such, there are six porphyry sarcophagi which were to contain the remains of the Grand Dukes, set below niches to hold statues of the interred.\n\nHere are those of Grand Duke Ferdinand I and Grand Duke Cosimo II with bronze statues made by brothers Ferdinando and Pietro Tacca, assistant to Giambologna, between 1626 and 1642 …\n\n… while below is that of Grand Duke Cosimo III, where here, and with the other three niches, they find themselves devoid of statues …\n\nSo, a couple of things to notice here:\n\nThe six-ball Medici crest appears multiple times around the chapel.\n\nThe sarcophagi are each placed several feet off the floor; even in death the Medici are lauding their power OVER their ‘subjects’.\n\nEach niche has written over the top ‘Dux Etr‘, standing for Duke of Etruria. Etruria was the ancient name for Tuscany ruled over by kings and princes. This inclusion was possibly an act of self-aggrandisement with the Medici equating themselves with the ancient kings of Tuscany.\n\nOnly two of the six niches provided contain a statue. Unfortunately money and time ran out for the Medici – and the Chapel of the Princes. Fortunately, work on the Chapel was completed in the following centuries.\n\nHowever, these niches aren’t the only empty spaces – and here is the final irony of the Chapel of the Princes …\n\nWhile the Medici have achieved immortality through their record of wealth, power and patronage, not one of those sarcophagi in the Chapel of the Princes contains any of their (im)mortal remains!\n\nSo where are they?\n\nAll six grand dukes represented here in the Chapel are buried with their families beneath the floor of the crypt below – the crypt that you whisked past as you entered the building!\n\nDid you miss them?\n\nCiao Tutti!\n\nWe would certainly recommend having a look at the all-round 360o view of the Chapel of the Princes that can be found here (Accessed 24/06/2024)\n\n… and don’t forget to visit our posts on Brunelleschi’s and Michelangelo’s Sacristies of San Lorenzo here and here respectively.\n\nFor opening hours and ticket prices see the Medici Chapels website here.\n\nCOVER PHOTO: Tomb of Giuliano de’ Medici, Duke of Nemours, with Night and Day, Segrestia Nuova, San Lorenzo, Florence\n\nOur previous post, Brunelleschi’s ‘Old’ Sacristy of San Lorenzo, Florence, looked at the Basilica’s Segrestia Vecchia on the left transept, the construction of which was completed in 1428. This post takes us across the other side of the transept to pick up the story a century later, to 1519, when Michelangelo was commissioned to construct the ‘New’ Sacristy of San Lorenzo – the Segrestia Nuova.\n\nStrictly not a sacristy (a room in a church used by clergy to prepare for worship), Michelangelo’s ‘sacristy’ was primarily intended as a funerary chapel containing the mortal remains of members of the Medici family, but whose architecture was based on Brunelleschi’s design to maintain symmetry either side of the transept.\n\nNow while the Segrestia Vecchia is accessible from within the Basilica, there is no direct access to the New Sacristy from the Basilica itself – there is, but unfortunately this is closed off to visitors.\n\nThe Segrestia Nuova, together with the Chapel of Princes and the Crypt, are separate entities from the Basilica, combining in 1869 to become a state museum complex in their own right, the Cappelle Medici (Medici Chapels), that today fall under the auspices of the Florence’s Bargello Museum.\n\nEntry is around in the Piazza di Madonna degli Aldobrandini beneath the impressive dome …\n\n… second only in its inspiration to Brunelleschi’s dome that crowns Florence Cathedral.\n\nThe sign beside the entrance door, lists the museums principal contents …\n\nOnline reservation and details of entrance charges (covering the Crypt, the New Sacristy and the Chapel of Princes) and times of opening can be found here.\n\nThe entrance leads directly into the crypt, in which can be found the tombs of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany (all Medici). Here, for example, can be found the resting place of Cosimo il Vecchio (1389 -1464) Pater Patriae (father of the country) – founder of the Medici family as rulers of Florence …\n\n… together with the less grand members of the dynasty who invariably find their less grand tombs beneath stone slabs …\n\nA set of stairs leads up to the sublime Sagrestia Nuova (“New Sacristy”), both architecturally designed and adorned with statuary by Michelangelo …\n\nDirectly modelled on Brunelleschi’s Old Sacristy (1421 – 1440), Michelangelo produced a similar cube-surmounted-by-a-hemisphere structure, where here the coffered cupola reflects that of the Pantheon in Rome …\n\n…. but while the Old Sacristy had Brunelleschi as architect and Donatello as sculptor, in the New Sacristy (1520 – 1533), Michelangelo was both.\n\nThe Segrestia Nouva was Michelangelo’s first realisation of architecture. While his sculptural work here was in Marble, the architectural surrounds, such as the Corinthian pilasters, use the blue-grey pietra serena, an architectural stone commonly used in Renaissance buildings. In the use of these materials, here Michelangelo was promoting himself both as sculptor and architect.\n\nThe Medici reign was not continuous. After the failed Pazzi Conspiracy of 1478, which attempted to relieve the Medici of their power, significant challenges befell the Medici during the 1490s in which an angered Florentine public forced the exile of the then Medici leader, Piero di Lorenzo de’ Medici, beginning a first Medici interregnum from 1494 to 1512.\n\nThe first ennoblements of any of the Medici fell to Giuliano, Duke of Nemours (1479 -1516) who ruled Florence from 1512 to 1513 after the family had been restored to power, …\n\n… and Giuliano’s nephew, Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino (who died in 1519) …\n\nNow such illustrious members of the dynasty required a monumental resting place befitting of their status. Unfortunately, Brunelleschi’s ‘Old’ Sacristy was deemed too sacrosanct to change, to make additions, so a new sacristy was required.\n\nIn 1519 it was Pope Leo X, aka Giovanni di Lorenzo de’ Medici (1475 –1521), brother and uncle of the two recently deceased dukes, who commissioned Michelangelo to produce a mortuary chapel (a funerary chamber rather than a true sacristy) and adornments befitting their ennobled rank. Upon Leo’s death in 1521, there was a short hiatus after which the commission was continued by Leo’s cousin, Pope Clement VII (another Medici Pope), with work recommencing in 1524.\n\nThe sacristy was not only intended for the two dukes but was also to include final resting places for one of the more famous members of the Medici family and father of both Pope Leo X and Giuliano, Duke of Nemours, Lorenzo il Magnifico (1449 – 1492) together with Lorenzo’s brother Giuliano di Piero de’ Medici (1453 –1478) – who was also Pope Leo’s uncle.\n\nConvoluted, yes, brimming with hubris and nepotism, yes, but this was essentially Popes Leo X and Clement VII looking after their own and promoting their family’s power.\n\nA family tree of the Medici can be found in Encyclopaedia Britannica here (where the Family Tree can be enlarged).\n\nMichelangelo began work on the new sacristy and its interments from March 1520. Originally suggesting floor-mounted tombs, he eventually opted for wall-mounted tombs with the noble dukes within their own tombs and the two Medici ‘Magnificents’ sharing a single tomb. The work continued on-and-off until 1534 when Michelangelo was called away to Rome to continue his work on the tomb of Pope Julius II and to paint the Altar Wall in the Sistine Chapel with The Last Judgement – commissioned by Pope Clement VII.\n\nThe relatively unimpressive sepulchre containing both Lorenzo il Magnifico (d. 1492) and Giuliano di Piero de’ Medici (killed in the Pazzi Conspiracy in 1478) is to be found on the wall immediately to the right on entry to the Sacristy …\n\nOriginally intended to be buried in a free-standing monument, Lorenzo is buried with his brother Giuliano. This was the last tomb in the Sacristy to be ‘completed’ by Michelangelo and was unfinished since it was during this later phase that Michelangelo was called to work in Rome (but completed by pupils of Michelangelo after his departure).\n\nThe tomb is surmounted by three statues. Either side of Michelangelo’s Madonna and Child …\n\n… are the patron saints of the Medici family each centring their gaze on the Madonna, Saint Cosmas (left) and Saint Damian (right) by sculptors Montorsoli and Montelupo respectively. These three sculptures were eventually placed here by Giorgio Vasari in 1554 …\n\nAlthough Lorenzo the Magnificent was perhaps one of the most famous members of the Medici family, the crowning glory in the Segrestia Nuova are the two Ducal tombs with each surmounted by a major sculpture by Michelangelo representing (though not with a true likeness) of the duke interred thereunder. The two ducal tombs are not free-standing, just set against the wall. No, each is an architectural and sculptural complex with Michelangelo ’embedding’ each in its individual wall – an irremovable relationship between the overall structure of the sacristy, the statues and the sepulchres.\n\nThe tomb of Giuliano, Duke of Nemours, the first of the House of Medici to obtain a noble title, is on the side wall to the right …\n\n… with the head of Giuliano’s representative figure turned towards the Madonna and Child above Lorenzo’s tomb on the adjacent wall.\n\nReclining on the top of the sarcophagus itself are two of Michelangelo’s allegorical figures of the four phases of the day – reflecting the passage of time – Night and Day.\n\nEither side of the main sculpture is an empty niche, designed to hold statues representing Heaven and Earth but, with Michelangelo executing several other projects at the same time (including the tomb of Pope Julius II and the Laurentian Library), they were never created.\n\nGiuliano himself is represented by a classical Roman general holding an army commander’s baton with both hands …\n\n… perched above his sarcophagus on which lie the recumbent Night and Day – with all three sculptures carved from individual marble blocks by Michelangelo …\n\nBoth the lower figures appear incomplete, with smooth-bodied Night emerging from, and still attached to, the marble block from which she was formed (albeit roughly decorated with an owl – a nocturnal bird – and a mask – representing deception) …\n\n… as is Day, but here even his head appears to have been left roughly hewn compared with the smoothness of the rest of his torso and limbs …\n\nOn the opposite wall is the tomb of Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino …\n\n… a dukedom that had been secured with the help of his uncle – Pope Leo X!\n\nAs with Giuliano’s tomb opposite, each of the two upper side niches were meant to hold a statue, this time of Knowledge and Will, but again these were never completed with Michelangelo’s departure to Rome …\n\n… and, as with the tomb of Giuliano, the head of the idealised representation of a contemplative Lorenzo in the centre niche here too is turned towards the Madonna and Child …\n\nAgain, recumbent on the sarcophagus itself are two further allegorical personifications of the times of day – Twilight (left) and Dawn (right) …\n\n.. with what again appear to be incomplete sculptures – each smooth, muscular statue being irrevocably bound to the rough hewn marble blocks from which they were formed …\n\nInvestigations of the contents of this tomb indicated a second body, that of Lorenzo’s illegitimate, but recognised, son, Alessandro de’ Medici, first duke of Florence, murdered at age 27 in a conspiracy by distant relative Lorenzino de’ Medici in 1537. What a tangled web they wove!\n\nFrom behind the altar, the orientation of the sacristy becomes more obvious …\n\nThe floor area of this square recess ‘behind’ the altar to the area of the funerary chamber beyond is in the ratio 1:4 – exactly as in Brunelleschi’s sacristy. Essentially this smaller area is a chapel – with the room of tombs behind as a backdrop.\n\nHowever, what is more interesting here in the altar’s recess is the graffiti covering much of the walls, now behind Perspex screens – part of which is shown here …\n\nThe walls are covered with graffiti of characters, animals and architectural features – none of which can be absolutely attributable to Michelangelo himself, being more likely the work of his assistants.\n\nHowever, …\n\n… from the Segrestia Nuova here there is trap-door access to a barrel-vaulted chamber beneath, discovered in 1975 during restoration work, whose walls are covered in charcoal sketches – this time it is more likely to be the work of Michelangelo since the drawings show his past and current works, including for the proposed allegorical figure of Night found on the tomb of Giuliano, Duke of Nemours.\n\nFurther details on the secret room with accompanying photographs of the sketches and why Michelangelo was there can be found in an article by The Florentine available here (updated 23/01/24 and accessed 25/04/24 – let me know if this is ever withdrawn).\n\nNote that access to this room is by advanced booking only and allows timed entrance for a 15-minute visit for just four people at a time. Entry to the ‘Secret Room’ itself costs €20.00 (2024 price) on top of the access charge to the Medici Chapels. Advanced ticket booking can be obtained from here or by phone by calling (+39) 055294883.\n\nBy 1534, Michelangelo’s permanent departure to Rome left the New Sacristy unfinished with the statues left scattered around the sacristy’s floor – only to be placed in their final positions by Giorgio Vasari some 20 years later.\n\nWe would certainly recommend having a look at the all-round 360o view of the Segrestia Nuova that can be found here (Accessed 25/05/2024)\n\nSee also our previous post on San Lorenzo’s ‘Old’ Sacristy by Brunelleschi and our next post on the Chapel of the Princes.\n\nIf you have a ‘Bucket List’ of things to do in Italy, the Medici Chapels should be somewhere near the top!\n\nCiao Tutti!\n\nCOVER PHOTO: Statue of Giovanni delle Bande Nere in front of the Basilica di San Lorenzo, Florence\n\nAn inscription on the back of the supporting plinth beneath the marble statue of Giovanni delle Bande Nere by Italian Renaissance sculptor, by Baccio Bandinelli, (literal translation by Google Translate) reads:\n\n“A part of this monument, intended by Cosimo Primo** to honour the memory of his father Giovanni delle Bande Nere***, which had been neglected for a long time, remained here and the vulgar called it the base of San Lorenzo, was restored in the year 1850 and placed there the statue of the great Captain, and at last the valuable work sculpted by Bandinelli was completed.”\n\n** Cosimo Primo is Cosimo I de’ Medici (1519 –1574)\n\n*** Giovanni delle Bande Nere was another name for Ludovico de’ Medici (1498 -1526) who was a condottiero (= contractor), a captain in command of mercenary companies during medieval times.\n\n… so Bandinelli‘s statue and plinth, commissioned by Cosimo I, which had taken from 1540 to 1560 to complete, were only positioned together here in 1850.\n\nOn the side of the plinth is the Medici Coat of Arms with its five ‘balls’ (more of which later) …\n\n… and therein lie the clues as to the family who held sway over this part of Florence.\n\nThe building behind is the Medici Family Church, the Basilica di San Lorenzo, designed by Brunelleschi (1377 –1446) with the financial support of Giovanni di Bicci de’ Medici (1360 -1429) and the Medici family’s wealth. As such, it is not surprising that there are many of the Medici family whose mortal remains can be found within the basilica.\n\nThe Basilica’s west front (in the Cover Photo above) shows a particularly prosaic frontage of coarse terracotta brick work – and has done so since completion at the end of the 15th century. A competition was held to design a much more elaborate façade – a competition won by Michelangelo. Unfortunately, his design only ever reached the (wooden) model stage. This can be seen nowadays in the Casa Buonarotti Museum, Florence. See our post, Casa Buonarotti Museum (Part 2)\n\nPLAN VIEW OF THE BASILICA DI SAN LORENZO\n\nThis post looks at Brunelleschi’s ‘Old’ Sacristy on the left side of the transept (labelled 1), the second post in this series at Michelangelo’s ‘New’ Sacristy on the right (labelled 2) and the third considers what may best be described as the “super-apse“, (labelled 3) the Chapel of the Princes (the latter two posts in course of preparation).\n\nCommissioned by the Medici as their family mausoleum, Filippo Brunelleschi’s ‘Old’ Sacristy (Sagrestia Vecchia) in the left transept is essentially a cube surmounted by a hemispherical dome. Even so, in its detail it is a masterpiece of early Renaissance architecture …\n\nTaking nine years to complete, from 1419 to 1428, it simply oozes the 15th century revival of Classical architecture with its Roman arches, architrave, Corinthian pilasters and Ionic columns.\n\nAstronomers have ascertained that the frescoes in the small dome in the apse above the crucifix, attributed to Giuliano d’Arrigo (aka Pesello), show the Sun and the constellations as they appeared over Florence most likely on the night of 4 July 1442 …\n\nThe tomb beneath the centre table is that of Giovanni di Bicci de’ Medici (1360 –1429) and his wife, Piccarda Bueri (1368 –1433) …\n\nGiovanni was the father of Cosimo il Vecchio (1389 –1464) and great-great-great-grandfather of Cosimo I de’ Medici (1519 –1574).\n\nAt his death, Giovanni was one of the richest people in Florence having founded the Medici bank – the largest in Europe in the 15th century. The power of the Medici fortune led directly to the rise of one of the main branches of the mighty Medici dynasty that lasted for around three centuries (whose family tree from the time of Giovanni di Bicci can be seen here). From humble beginnings, over time the family rose to becoming the Grand Dukes of Tuscany whilst also providing four Popes and two Queens of France. The last Medici ruler, Gian Gastone de’ Medici, died without a male heir in 1737, so bringing the dynasty to an end.\n\nOnce the Sagrestia Vecchia was completed, it was left to Donatello (1386 – 1466), one of the most outstanding sculptors of the day, to complete the adornments some time between 1428 and 1443.\n\nIn the above photograph can be seen some of Donatello’s contributions, such as the two double bronze doors with relief panels …\n\n… above each door can be found Donatello’s stucco reliefs of four saints, including the Medici patron saints, Cosmas and Damian …\n\nBoth By Donatello – from the book: Rolf C. Wirtz, Donatello, Könemann, Colonia 1998, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6885730 & https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6885722\n\nDating about 20 years later (1469-72), the side wall of the Segrestia Vecchia holds a tomb, commissioned by Lorenzo de’ Medici (1449 – 1492) and completed by Andrea del Verrocchio (1435 – 1488), containing the mortal remains of Lorenzo’s father, Piero di Cosimo de’ Medici (1416 – 1469) and his uncle, Giovanni di Cosimo de’ Medici (1421 – 1463) …\n\nThe eight roundels just below the cupola contain painted stucco reliefs by Donatello, one of which shows the Ascension of John the Baptist …\n\nImmediately below the tondo is the Medici Crest, this time showing eight balls. Why eight? On the side of the plinth above there were only six. When first adopted as the family coat-of-arms, there were 12, here in the Sagrestia Vecchia there are 8 and by the time of Cosimo I, it had settled down to just the 6. The reason for the variation seems to have become lost in the mists of time, as is the use of balls on a gold shield. Here the explanations range from being pharmaceutical pills (after all the name Medici translates as ‘doctors’, the family’s original trade), through to coins (their association with banking) or even dents in a shield from their time in battle. No one knows for sure.\n\nOne thing IS for sure, the Medici crest adorns many of the buildings of Florence – such as here, in the central courtyard of the Palazzo Vecchio …\n\nYou may notice that the later crests have one ball different to the rest …\n\nThe blue ball in the Medici crest features the symbol of the French monarchy, three golden lilies. Folklore tells us that Louis XI (1423 – 1483), King of France, owed money to the Medici family. So in 1465, to reduce his debts, he allowed the Medici to incorporate the royal symbol into their crest – which, if correct, would have been willingly accepted by the Medici since it added kudos and gravitas to their dynasty.\n\nWe would certainly recommend having a look at the all-round 360o view of the Segrestia Vecchia that can be found here (Accessed 12/05/2024)\n\nThe bust in the glass case behind the camera operator is that of Donatello\n\nSee also our posts on San Lorenzo’s ‘New’ Sacristy by Michelangelo and the Chapel of the Princes (sorry, still inpreparation!)\n\nCiao Tutti!\n\nCOVER PHOTO: A view across Lake Como from the tip of the promontory that is Bellagio. By Daderot – Self-photographed, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=15153875\n\nFrom Bellagio …\n\n… to Skipton, a charming market town in the Craven District of North Yorkshire, England …\n\n… where the occasional cobbled streets and alleyways have a beguiling charm …\n\n… and where the town lies astride the Leeds-Liverpool canal …\n\nStretching 127 miles and taking 46 years to complete, the Leeds-Liverpool canal is Britain’s longest inland waterway, with its first section opening in 1773 from Bingley to Skipton. The canal played a significant part in Skipton’s development, becoming a major hub facilitating the transport between Yorkshire and Lancashire of stone (from which most of Skipton’s traditional houses are made), cotton, coal, grain and wool. Nowadays the canal has become a wonderful leisure facility for those who ply their iconic narrowboats (a link with the Industrial Revolution in Britain) along the canal through idyllic countryside and bustling towns and cities.\n\nOn market days, Skipton’s High Street is thronged with temporary market stalls and willing customers …\n\n… and at the head of the High Street is the 11th century Skipton Castle …\n\nBut wait! Hold on! Why am I giving you a travelogue of a market town in England when all the other posts in Italian Reflections are Italy-based? Let me explain …\n\nI was visiting Skipton when I happened to pass the Library, noticing this plaque outside …\n\n… and it wasn’t the apparently misplaced apostrophe in the word “Mechanic’s” that drew my attention (who was this Skipton Mechanic?)! No, it was the fact that the library’s main benefactor was the ‘American’ (but born in Scotland) steel magnate and one-time one of the richest individuals in the America, Andrew Carnegie! What association had he with Skipton?\n\nThe Craven Herald & Pioneer from the 11th October 2019 (Accessed 30/04/2024) can explain in more detail than space allows here.\n\nSo no Italian link there! However, …\n\n… look down the list of names on the right (passing by George Harrison!) …\n\n… and there, amongst local names such as Birtwhistle, Bairstow and Dewhurst, there appears a Thomas Fattorini – someone who must have had Italian forebears. Who were they? Why and when did they come to England?\n\nThe scene now shifts to the Lakes of Lombardy during the 1820s post-Napoleonic, pre-Risorgimento Italy, to Bellagio, a promontory in the inverted-Y that is Lake Como …\n\nDuring the early 19th century, this area of Lake Como, then part of Switzerland, was left impoverished by the Napoleonic Wars but was particularly well-endowed with artisans adept at making barometers, clocks and other precision instruments. In order to maintain a livelihood, there was a migration of these artisans to an emerging industrial power – England. One such migrant was Antonio Fattorini (1797 -1859).\n\nArriving in Dewsbury, Yorkshire in about 1820, for several years Antonio made a living as a travelling salesman and selling items at street markets. By 1831, 1841 and 1846 he had bought three shops (in Dewsbury, Harrogate and Bradford, respectively) – and had had seven sons!\n\nBy 1827, the Fattorini family opened a shop selling jewellery, clocks and other luxury goods on the corner of Skipton’s High Street and Newmarket Street.\n\nAhh, the link becomes clearer!\n\nAlthough all part of the same family, Thomas Fattorini Ltd of Skipton was distinct from Fattorini and Sons of Bradford (established 1829) and Antonio Fattorini in Harrogate (est.1831).\n\nMoving into the 20th Century, Thomas Fattorini Ltd opened a factory in Birmingham to manufacture medals, brooches etc …\n\n… including Lonsdale Belts, awarded to champion professional boxers, first awarded in 1909 …\n\nThe company progressed to such an extent that it was granted a Royal Warrant of Appointment to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 2008.\n\nThe Fattorini family was later instrumental in setting up a selling method whereby customers could afford to buy more expensive goods by purchasing them over a 20-week regular payment of instalments (the so-called, never-never). This new method of purchase eventually morphed into the Grattan Warehouses Ltd company, founded in 1912 by John Enrico Fattorini and Empire Stores, first registered in 1909. The demise of Empire Stores is well chronicled in the Bradford Telegraph & Argus of 11th January 2008 (Accessed 30/04/2024).\n\nHowever the Fattorini Group is still a major player in the manufacture of Emblematic Jewellery, Trophies, Medals and Badges, Ceremonial Swords, Civic Insignia, Automotive Products and Prestigious Silverware. Their website can be found here. Today Thomas Fattorini Ltd is based on three sites: London, Manchester and Birmingham, but its headquarters are registered at …\n\nWait for it …!\n\nSo, back to Skipton and the mystery of who is …\n\nBy 1910, the year Skipton Library opened, the Fattorini family were well established major characters in Skipton (and Yorkshire) life, with Thomas Fattorini (1864-1934) mentioned here on the library plaque as a Trustee. This Thomas was the son of Innocent Fattorini (1830 – 1874) and the grandson of the ‘original’ Fattorini, Antonio (1797-1859) from Bellagio.\n\nSo that was one mystery solved, but there was another …\n\nAbove, I left hanging the statement that “Thomas Fattorini Ltd … headquarters are registered at …”\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause their headquarters are registered at Skipton Castle!\n\nBack in 1956, the Fattorini family were wealthy enough to purchase this Grade I Listed medieval castle, built in 1090 by Robert de Romille, a Norman baron. It is a Fattorini-owned private residence but, apart from their private wing, is a tourist attraction currently managed by Sebastian Fattorini, open for visits, £12.00 for adults (18 – 64 years old) and £11.00 for seniors (65 and older), 2024 prices.\n\nSorted!\n\nThe Fattorini family have made great contributions not only to Yorkshire life, but British life as a whole – and still do after 200 years since leaving Bellagio.\n\nSkipton is an enchanting, archetypal, historic Yorkshire market town set in stunning countryside on the southern end of the Yorkshire Dales National Park and just to the east of the Forest of Bowland National Landscape.\n\nDo visit!\n\n… and see if you can find out more about Antonio Fattorini and his descendants!\n\nCiao Tutti!\n\nor this time\n\nTa’ra!\n\nCOVER PHOTO: Casa Buonarotti, Via Ghibellina 70, 50122 Firenze (43°46′11.32″N 11°15′48.93″E)\n\nPart 1 of our Casa Buonarotti posts gives a brief history of the Casa and has a look around the ground floor. In Part 2 here we ascend the stairs to visit rooms on the first floor.\n\nAt the top of the first flight of stairs is a landing where hang images of Michelangelo – a person who painted portraits only in exceptional cases and who disliked having portraits painted of him. Fortunately for us, he allowed just the two portraits to be painted by friends, one here by Jacopino del Conte (originally believed to be a self-portrait) …\n\n… while other paintings of Michelangelo on the landing are derivative works.\n\nThe second original portrait of Michelangelo (wearing a turban) by Giuliano Bugiardini (who assisted Michelangelo on the vault of the Sistine Chapel), hangs in an adjacent room accompanying a bronze bust of Michelangelo created by Daniele da Volterra, a trusted friend of Michelangelo (who was there to assist him on his deathbed and to remove his death mask in 1564) …\n\nA copy of di Volterra’s bust of Michelangelo can be found over the front door of Casa Buonarotti – and in many tourist shops in Florence!\n\nTwo of Michelangelo’s earliest sculptures can be found here on the first floor; works that were completed while under the patronage of Lorenzo de’ Medici. This, while a teenager, was a time during which Michelangelo lived with the Medici family, absorbing the scientific, philosophical, poetical and artistic influences from the many philosophers and artists who frequented the courts of the Medici.\n\nThe earlier of the two sculptures had been donated along with drawings by Leonardo Buonarotti to Cosimo I de’Medici around 1566, but were donated back by Grand Duke Cosimo II de’Medici in 1616 to Michelangelo’s grand-nephew, Michelangelo the Younger, specifically to place in the Casa Buonarotti in recognition of the Younger’s work in instituting the house-museum to his illustrious ancestor.\n\nThe 57cm x 40cm (22″ x 16″) Madonna of the Stairs, influenced by his study of the works of Donatello, was sculpted in marble by the 15-year-old around 1490 using the low-relief stiacciato technique …\n\nHere the Madonna sits on a stone slab with the child held firmly on her lap. Along and up the stairs, youngsters are seen handling a long cloth. Even on such a low-relief sculpture the Madonna’s drapery hangs realistically around her and over the stone block, exhibiting an illusory 3-dimensionality that belies the shallow depth of the sculptor’s chisel cuts.\n\nDo YOU know any 15-year-olds that could produce such an amazing, mature, piece of work!?\n\nThe later of the two sculptures, the unfinished 84.5cm x 90.5cm (33″ x 36″) marble Battle of the Centaurs ), his final work while under Lorenzo’s patronage, was created at the age of 17 around 1472 …\n\nThis scene of utter mayhem, a chaotic tangle of writhing bodies, represents the battle between the Aeolian tribe of the Lapiths and the Centaurs (half-horse, half-human) at the wedding feast of Pirithous – a favourite composition from ancient Greek mythology.\n\nThe use of the subbia chisel (a pointed chisel or punch) has produced the unfinished (non finito) appearance of the surfaces, as opposed to the smoothness of the earlier work (above) …\n\nWhile the Madonna of the Stairs was completed as a shallow-relief, this sculpture is truly high-relief in which the characters come bursting out of the scene …\n\nThe room off to one side of the space containing these two sculptures is devoted to the wooden model (2.83m wide by 2.10m high) designed by Michelangelo of the proposed marble façade …\n\n… for the incomplete, rough-stone, gable-end of the Basilica di San Lorenzo, the Brunelleschi-designed church dating from 1421, considered by the Medici as their own family church …\n\n… although, as can be seen, Michelangelo’s marble façade was never implemented!\n\nOn the opposite side to the room containing the two marble sculptures is the Galleria …\n\n… with walls and ceilings adorned with paintings by contemporary Italian artists, including Artemesia Gentileschi‘s ‘Allegory of Inclination’ as one of the ceiling panels (discussed in Part 1) …\n\nThe Gallery, the ornamental plan of which was designed by Michelangelo the Younger, is overseen from one end by Michelangelo himself in the form of a statue created specifically for the Casa by Antonio Novelli (1599 – 1662) around 1633 …\n\nCommissioned by Michelangelo the Younger, the statue portrays Michelangelo as the classical philosopher, dressed in a toga and holding a scroll, in a similar pensive mode that Michelangelo himself had created for the tomb of Lorenzo de’ Medici in the Medici Chapel in the 1520s …\n\nThe walls of the Gallery are adorned with panels showing scenes from Michelangelo’s life, such as the painting by Anastasio Fontebuoni (1571–1626) showing Michelangelo introducing himself to Pope Julius II in Bologna …\n\n… or the painting by Cosimo Gamberucci (1562 – 1621) in which a young Michelangelo meets with Francesco I de’ Medici …\n\nThe Gallery continues through to the Camera della Notte e del Dì (Room of Night and Day) completed in 1637-1638, depicting members of the Buonarroti family and events connected with them. This is the room that contains Giuliano Bugiardini’s turban wearing portrait and di Volterra’s bronze bust of Michelangelo (both mentioned above) …\n\nSo through to the next room, the Camera degli Angioli (Room of the Angels), which from 1677 was used as a chapel, containing frescoes by Jacopo Vignali of the good and great of Florence in a procession lead by John the Baptist …\n\nThe cupola and the ceiling of the former chapel are decorated with frescoes by Michelangelo Cinganelli, with the ceiling panels depicting angels, from which the room takes its name …\n\n… and the cupola containing an image of St. Michael the Archangel …\n\nThe following, final room along from the Galleria, is the Studio, a room originally belonging to an adjoining apartment but incorporated into the Casa in 1633 by Michelangelo the Younger. The ceiling portrays Fame, a trompe l’oeil painting by Cecco Bravo …\n\n… while the perimeter of the upper part of walls is festooned with a gallery of the great and good of Tuscany, including mathematicians, physicists, historians, philosophers, judges …\n\nThe small room just beyond is the Stanzino dell’Apollo (Small Room of Apollo), completing the run of monumental rooms created by Michelangelo the Younger. This room is named after the marble statue therein, a restored 1st-century BCE Roman sculpture of Apollo, behind which there is a faded fresco of a terrace that opens onto a garden …\n\n… and on the side wall is an arm carved from marble, probably from a Roman copy of Greek sculptor Myron’s portrayal of Discobolus, the “Discus Thrower” …\n\nThere is so much more to see in the Casa Buonarotti including around 200 drawings, sketches and cartoons (although some of which found their way into the British Museum in London in the mid-19th century) …\n\nWith the death of Michelangelo’s last direct collateral descendant and heir, Cosimo Buonarotti, all remaining works and the Casa itself were left for the public good. The drawings up to the 1960s were on permanent display in frames and display cases, but suffered some damage. For their conservation they were restored at the Uffizi and returned to the Casa Buonarroti in 1975. Since then only a rotating selection have been released for public view.\n\nThe collection also includes texts and letters, including this sonnet to Giovanni da Pistoia …\n\n… a translation of which can be found here.\n\nWe have not covered the whole of Casa Buonarotti here. As somewhere that is so full of riches and is off the well-worn beaten track of Tourist-Florence, it just has to be included on your must-see stops in the city.\n\nCasa Buonarotti is a fabulous find, giving an overview of Michelangelo, his work and his descendants.\n\nFor a tour of the Casa via Google Street View, have a look here …\n\n… start on the ground floor at the front door here …\n\n… and then have a look around upstairs, starting with Artemesia, here.\n\nJust step inside and wander round!\n\nCiao Tutti!\n\nCOVER PHOTO: Casa Buonarotti, Via Ghibellina 70, 50122 Firenze (43°46′11.32″N 11°15′48.93″E)\n\nPart 1 here investigates some of the history of the Casa Buonarotti and what can be seen on the ground floor. Part 2 moves upstairs to see some of the exhibits on the first floor.\n\nContained within what for Florence is an assuming house on an unassuming street (but is, nevertheless, a 17th-century palazzo) can be found one of the most outstanding artistic treasure-troves of Florence. This is the Casa Buonarotti, an absolutely ‘must-visit’, where the exterior disguises the richness of its contents and its history …\n\nAnyone who has visited the museums of Florence will have experienced the queues snaking around the block to enter the larger, more widely known galleries such as the Uffizi, or the Bargello or the Accademia; but often here, at the Casa Buonarotti, it is possible to walk in directly off the street …\n\n… and if you haven’t already guessed, the bust above the door gives the game away …\n\n… this is the house, part of a complex of five buildings, bought in 1508 and 1514 by the great Renaissance artist, Michelangelo Buonarotti.\n\nWhile not his main residence – he spent much of his time in Rome – Michelangelo is known to have occupied two of the buildings within this complex (with the other three buildings rented out) from 1516 to 1525 while he was working on the façade of the Basilica di San Lorenzo.\n\nAll five were rented out between 1525 and 1534, while Michelangelo lived elsewhere in Florence. With a permanent move to Rome in 1534, Michelangelo requested of his nephew, Leonardo Buonarotti, to transform all five buildings into a single entity that would represent and house memorabilia of the Buonarotti inheritance in one building. On Michelangelo’s death in 1564, Leonardo inherited the estate, but left it until 1590 to partially restore and unify the complex. However, Michelangelo’s vision was only realised after the death of Leonardo in 1599, when the buildings passed to mathematician and Michelangelo’s grand-nephew, ‘Michelangelo Buonarotti the Younger’ (1568 – 1646) …\n\n… an ardent supporter of his family’s distinguished ancestor, who from 1612 began the transformation to what we see today as the Casa Buonarotti…\n\nSubsequent to the integration of the five buildings into one, Michelangelo the Younger set about retrieving autograph manuscripts and drawings and other artefacts by, or belonging to, his famous ancestor.\n\nOn entering the Casa, the first room on the right deals not with Michelangelo himself, but with an archaeological collection that was put together by Michelangelo the Younger and later, and more significantly, by antiquarian, numismatist, archaeologist and great-grandnephew, Filippo Buonarotti (1661 – 1733) …\n\nThe room contains over 150 archaeological pieces, mainly Etruscan and Roman, including urns and terracotta figures and two large Roman Togati (toga wearers) statues that originally stood in the courtyard of the Casa …\n\nThe following room displays works all completed in the 16th century by artists wishing to emulate the style of Michelangelo. Here can be seen, for example, adaptations from The Last Judgement and a Sybil from the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel …\n\nThe next room holds various works of art from the Buonarotti family collection including a sculpture of Michelangelo as a child sculpting the head of a Faun …\n\n… however, this is a 19th century sculpture by Emilio Zocchi (1835 – 1913).\n\nOut into the Casa‘s 19th century internal courtyard, modelled after the central courtyards of Roman houses, stands a marble statue of a 2nd-century Togato which formerly stood in the Uffizi Gallery before being moved here in 1875 …\n\nOn our 2023 trip to Florence, we were extremely fortunate to visit Casa Buonarotti during a particular exhibition, ‘Artemisia in the Museum of Michelangelo’, which ran from September 2023 to January 2024 …\n\nArtemisia Gentileschi (1593 – 1656), a widely-acclaimed and important 17th-century Baroque artist, has a fascinating, but gruesome, story; but why does she warrant an exhibition in the Casa Buonarotti?\n\nIn 1615, Artemisia came to the attention of Michelangelo the Younger who, at the time, was preparing the Casa Buonarotti as a ‘shrine’ to his illustrious forbear. Under his patronage, several artists including Artemisia were commissioned to paint panels for the ceiling in the Galleria (more of which in Part 2 – in preparation) which represented personal traits associated with Michelangelo. Artemisia’s, entitled ‘Allegory of Inclination‘, depicts the inborn creative ability of Michelangelo …\n\nOriginally painted as a nude in 1615, the drapes were added at a later date by Baldassare Franceschini in 1684 to avoid any embarrassment for the viewer.\n\nDuring 2022, the painting was removed from the ceiling for restoration. Although it would not be possible to remove the drapery without damaging the painting, modern scientific techniques were able to reconstruct how the painting would have looked in its original form. By 2023, the restoration work was completed, allowing for the Artemisia exhibition at the Casa.\n\nA fabulous tour, setting the rooms of the Casa Buonarotti in context, can be experienced using Google Street View.\n\nStart on the ground floor at the front door here …\n\n… and in the meantime, proceed to Part 2 (but not yet – in the course of preparation) to view the exhibits on the first floor.\n\nCasa Buonarotti opening hours 10.00 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.\n\nAdmission Full price: € 8.00 Reduced: € 5.00 (2024 prices)\n\nCiao (for now!)"
