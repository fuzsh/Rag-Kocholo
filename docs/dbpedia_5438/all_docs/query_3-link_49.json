Summer 2024.\n\nCoronation Street favourite Paul Foreman will be killed off later this year after the character is diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease (MND).\n\nThe soap is working closely with the MND Association on this storyline and will explore the impact of the diagnosis on Paul and his loved ones as his condition progresses.\n\nMND is a fatal, rapidly progressing disease that affects the brain and spinal cord, attacking the nerves that control movement so muscles no longer work, often impacting the patient's senses such as sight, sound and feeling.\n\nActor Peter Ash said: \"Paul is completely blindsided by the diagnosis and he decides to keep it from his family and friends as he tries to come to terms with the news.\n\n\"I knew very little about MND before embarking on the storyline and I am hugely grateful to the MND Association for all their help and support. For any actor playing a role which examines a real life issue or condition there comes a huge sense of responsibility and we are aware that some people watching this storyline are experiencing it in reality, it is their life.\n\n\"Awareness and education are really important. I have learned so much even in the short time I have been involved in this storyline. We hope Paul’s journey can make people more aware of the symptoms and what it is like for someone to live with MND.\"\n\nThe character will therefore die when the storyline concludes.\n\nRowan Cunliffe (Emrhys Cooper)\n\nWhen is Rowan Cunliffe leaving? 2024.\n\nIt seems the Institute storyline is coming to an end - at some point - with Emrhys Cooper reportedly leaving his role as Rowan Cunliffe.\n\nWhile there is still much of the story to play out on-screen, The Mirror reports that Rowan will leave at the end of the storyline.\n\nIt is understood that this was always the plan with the storyline with Rowan having a fixed shelf life to serve the plot.\n\nSo, how will the villainous Rowan depart?\n\nGail Rodwell (Helen Worth)\n\nWhen is Gail Rodwell leaving? Late 2024.\n\nCoronation Street legend Helen Worth is leaving the soap after 50 years in the role of Gail Rodwell.\n\nThe actress decided to leave the role after half a century on the street and will depart following a major exit storyline for the Platt family.\n\nHelen will start filming her exit story next month and the emotional scenes will be on screen at the end of the year.\n\nHelen said: “This year felt like the perfect time to leave the show after celebrating 50 years in the most wonderful job on the most wonderful street in the world. I made the decision at the start of the year and spoke to the producers who were very kind and understanding.\n\n“I have been truly blessed to have been given the most incredible scripts week in week out, and to have worked with fantastic actors, directors and a brilliant crew.\n\n“The past 50 years have flown by and I don't think the fact that I am leaving has quite sunk in yet.”\n\nExecutive Producer Iain Macleod said: “The words ‘legend’ and ‘icon’ get used a lot these days but they genuinely do apply to Gail and to Helen Worth. However, given her humility, I know Helen won’t thank me for saying so! In Helen’s hands, Gail has been a huge part of Coronation Street for five decades and at the centre of some of the most memorable storylines - often deriving from her catastrophically bad luck in choosing husbands!\"\n\nHe added: “Gail has given us countless hours of entertainment but it should also be said that Helen herself is a consummate professional and a thoroughly good egg. Everyone connected to the show will miss having her around the place just as much as the viewers will miss having her on their screens and we wish her all the very best for the future.”\n\nRETURNING\n\nMartin Platt (Sean Wilson)\n\nWhen is Martin Platt returning? October 2024.\n\nSean Wilson has been confirmed to be reprising his role as classic character Martin Platt for ex-wife Gail Rodwell's exit storyline later this year.\n\nWilson began filming on Wednesday 24th July and his return will air in October.\n\nSpeaking about his comeback, the actor said: \"It was great to be invited back to Coro St again, to contribute to Helen’s exit story.\n\n\"We’ll have a few months to catch up with Martin and Gail again, following the ebbs and flows of the unfolding storyline.\n\n\"Playing Martin has been a joy since day one, and in a way, I’ll be slipping back to where I left off, which no doubt will throw a spanner into the heart of the Platt family,\" Wilson teased.\n\n\"It’s just like slipping on an old and comfortable jumper from the back of the wardrobe… I’m looking forward to reuniting with my TV family.\"\n\nThe Sun reports that it is only a fixed-term return and it will provide Gail with a romantic, happy ending; reuniting Gail with arguably her most stable husband. ITV has yet to confirm Martin's return.\n\nMartin originally appeared in the soap over two decades from 1985 and 2005, making some guest returns to visit son David Platt, last being seen in 2018.\n\nWe wonder what David will make of Martin's comeback and reunion with his mum!\n\nWho has left Coronation Street in 2024?\n\nThe following regular characters have departed Coronation Street in 2024.\n\nSarge Bailey (Guest)\n\nMoses Ekundayo\n\nHarvey Gaskell\n\nDamon Hay\n\nViolet Wilson (Guest)\n\nEliza Woodrow\n\nSimon Barlow\n\nWho has left Coronation Street in 2023?\n\nThe following regular characters have departed Coronation Street in 2023.\n\nGriff Reynolds\n\nJacob Hay\n\nMike Hargrave\n\nEsther Hargrave\n\nTeddy Thompkins\n\nCilla the Cincilla\n\nDaryan Zahawi\n\nRufus Donahue\n\nJustin Rutherford\n\nKaren Rutherford\n\nAaron Sandford\n\nGeoffrey \"Spider\" Nugent\n\nIsabella Benvenuti\n\nHenry Newton\n\nShelly Rossington\n\nStephen Reid\n\nDarren Vance\n\nCourtney Vance\n\nCrystal Hyde\n\nPeter Barlow\n\nWho left Coronation Street in 2022?\n\nThe following regular characters have departed Coronation Street in 2022.\n\nTed Spear\n\nMarrium Nazier\n\nClint Stubbins\n\nLinda Hancock\n\nGrace Vickers\n\nLydia Chambers\n\nJon Spear\n\nEmma Brooker\n\nLaura Neelan\n\nElsie\n\nBen Chancellor\n\nImran Habeeb\n\nCathy Matthews\n\nNicky Wheatley\n\nCamilla Perrin\n\nMimi Halliday\n\nFrank Bardsley\n\nPhill Whittaker\n\nGeoff Metcalfe (Guest, hallucination)\n\nSaira Habeeb\n\nRick Neelan (Guest, hallucination)\n\nKelly Neelan\n\nLeo Thompkins\n\nJames Bailey\n\nMartha Fraser\n\nWendy Crozier\n\nHarvey Gaskell\n\nWho else will remain in Weatherfield by the end of the year?\n\nVisit our dedicated Coronation Street page for all the latest news, interviews and spoilers.
