Nino is a worker who tries, but can not fit into the Swiss mentality: he is constantly in conflict with the police, because with his unbridled southern temperament he disturbs the “cold” Swiss. Nino soon meets new people, finds new work engagements, but he has to hide his Italian origin from everyone. Despite everything, he does not give up to “conquer” Switzerland …\n\nDirector Franco Brusati (1920-1993) was a lawyer by education, and began his career as a journalist.

In the second part, Salvatore, who constantly dreams of America, despite the fierce opposition of his mother (that patriarchal icon in Mediterranean cinema) sells out all his property. In the third, on the other hand, one step closer to the American soil, the mysterious beauty Lucy (Ginsbourg) appears, an elegant woman of mysterious origin, who will partially direct the fate of the male members of the Mancuso family …\n\nChrialeze’s NEW WORLD has got around 50 awards and nominations.
