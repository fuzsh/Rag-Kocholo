        "text": "It gives us great pleasure to announce that, for the third consecutive year, we have been awarded the \"ST Star Award\" as the best Italian language school in Italy!\n\nWe at the Scuola Leonardo da Vinci are truly honored to receive this important international recognition, sponsored by Study Travel Magazine and awarded by experts in the field, including agencies around the world specializing in overseas study trips, who organize language study vacations for thousands of students every year.\n\nSo for all this, we have to say a triple thank you!\n\nFirst, we have to thank our partners, who we work with every day. Once again, we have to thank all of you for this prize, which is a reward for our efforts in providing a high quality service for students from around the world!\n\nSecondly, we must thank our students. Over the past 46 years, we have shared our knowledge and passion for learning the Italian language with more than a quarter of a million students coming from 120 different countries, often making memories that stay with them for their whole lives. And every time we receive a letter, you talk about us in glowing terms on social media or we read positive feedback on our Google, Tripadvisor and Facebook pages, we feel as excited as we did when we first started out all the way back in 1977. It is these small gestures that give all of our staff energy and enthusiasm, and for this we are so grateful.\n\nAnd lastly, special thanks to all those who made this victory possible: our teachers, secretarial staff and all of our partners. Heartfelt thanks for all of your work which makes these great milestones possible.\n\nGRAZIE! GRAZIE! GRAZIE!\n\nListen to the special dedicated episode of the \"Italiano ON-Air\" podcast entitled: Premiati 3 volte di fila - Episodio 4 (stagione 5)\n\nWatch the special video with photos and images from the award ceremony night."
