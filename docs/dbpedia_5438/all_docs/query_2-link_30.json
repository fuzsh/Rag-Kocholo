Alcuni di questi film includono corti di registi di fama come George Lucas, Robert Zemekis etc. Con oltre 25 anni di esperienza nell'industria cinematografica e nei festival internazionali sin dalla sua posizione come promoter di film all'Unifrance Film International, Sandrine Cassidy ha costruito la propria carriera specializzandosi nella distribuzione, esposizione di corti e lungometraggi e il supporto di registi indipendenti.\n\nAndrea Lodovichetti\n\nAndrea Lodovichetti was born in Italy in 1976 and currently lives between Europe and the US. Graduated in Film Directing at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia (National School of Film in Italy), he worked as 2AD for the Academy Award winner director Paolo Sorrentino. Director, producer and screenwriter, he won a consistent number of international Awards including the Italian Golden Globe and the Looking for a Genius Award at the Babelgum Film Festival in Cannes, headed by Spike Lee.\n\nLuca Nervegna\n\nLuca Nervegna works as director of photography and has nearly twenty years of experience in the cinema field. After years spent working whithin the industry in Rome, he has founded a film company, in partnership with Giacomo Benini and entirely focused on the region of Romagna: the Furia Film.\n\nTony Parnis\n\nTony undertook film studies in Canada and produced and hosted Servizz Xandir Malti on Graham Cable TV in Toronto.

Tony is the Festival Director/Producer of The Malta International TV Short Film Festival that is broadcasted by PBS, Malta national television for the past eleven years.\n\nElena Zanni\n\nElena Zanni was born in a cinephile family of entrepreneurs. She spends her childhood in the many cinemas owned by his family, who also run some independent movie theatres like the parish indie cinema in Gabicce Mare, the very first challenge of his father, Silvio Zanni, back in the 60s. Elena literally grows up in the movie houses. She now runs one of the most known movie theatres in the world and in Italy: Fulgor, Fellini's movie theatre. Praised, discussed and still loved by many for its long history, Fulgor movie house is more than 100 years old and it raised the little Federico Fellini who fell in love with it. That is why Fulgor is displayed in many of his movies.\n\nIt is the first indie cinema to open its doors in Rimini, in 1914, and it was led by a resourceful woman, Ida Ravulli. The cinema reopens in January 2018, on Fellini's birthday, to celebrate the non-forgotten director. This time, another charismatic woman is in charge of it: Elena Zanni. She begins her activity in 2009 thanks to his father. Together, they decide to take over Settebello in Rimini to turn it into an independent movie theatre. Thanks to the precious help of the many collaborators she meets during her carrier and thanks to her foresight, she takes over her family business and runs it with success, winning the management of Fulgor. Nowadays, she manages projects which lead to the great cultural events organized in her movie theatres in Rimini. Writers, artists, actors, directors, musicians but also scientists and entrepreneurs, leaders of the national cultural scene, animate those spaces which are no more just 'cinemas', but a real cultural, social, artistic and humanitarian melting pot. All of this is possible thanks to the sensible and big efforts that her team put in place every day, in order to convey feelings and awareness to people.\n\nFELLINI'S AWARD JURY\n\nFrancesca Fabbri Fellini\n\nMy name is Francesca Fabbri Fellini, born in 1965, professional journalist. Being daughter of his sister, Maria Maddalena, I'm the only remaining heir for Maestro Federico Fellini's DNA. I'm the worldwide ambassador of this work. In addition to being peacefully legitimized to the protection of Maestro's name and image by being his heir, I'm also the only and exclusive owner for trade marks composed of FEDERICO FELLINI's patronymic (including his signature), registered trademark in Italy and abroad, in order to distinguish actual and/or potential commercial activities suited to Maestro's prestige and image, and to avoid the attempts of hoarding sales power connected to Fellini's name by third parties. Therefore, I take care of Maestro Fellini's name, image of his works and of his signature. Defending artist Fellini is a job. Born in Bologna in 1965 under the sign of Gemini, with Libra on the ascendant, Francesca lived her first 19 years in Rimini, with her parents Maria Maddalena Fellini and Giorgio Fabbri, a pediatrician. At 23 years she graduated in Foreign Languages and Literature and in 1987 she signed her first writing in video for RAI, for the program \"Muoviamoci su Rai Due\" with Sidney Rome, composed of 180 episodes.\n\nAfter this experience, she signed many more contracts with RAI: from 1999 to 2006 she's one of the correspondents for \"La vita in diretta\" with Michele Cucuzza on Raiuno. She worked with authors such as Michele Guardì, Senza Sampò, Licia Colò. She really likes television, but cinema has been in her chromosomes since forever (she defines herself as \"raised with cinema and tortellini\"): from 1993 and 1997 she collaborated with radio network RTL 102.5, managing cinema, and thanks to this experience she became a professional journalist. From 2004 to 2006 she signed and hosted on RTL: \"Asa NIsi MAsa  L'ANIMA del cinema\", which took its name from the magic sentence repeated by Guido/Mastroianni, main character of \"Otto e mezzo\".\n\nFrancesca thought about this title for her program as a tribute to her uncle \"CHICCO\". The 'Fellinette', as her uncle Federico used to call her, loves good food, theatre, books, flowers and spending her time with her little big friend Alfie, a white poodle who only lacks of words. Her favorite movie is Amarcord, of which she knows every line and which she watches as soon as she can.\n\nBlasco Giurato\n\nBorn in Rome on 7th June 1941, he's a cinematographer and became known working with Giuseppe Tornatore in \"Nuovo Cinema Paradiso\". Thanks to his work with his film he also gained a nomination to BAFTA.\n\nFilmography (partial):\n\nSapore di mare 2 - Un anno dopo (Bruno Cortini, 1983)\n\nOlga e i suoi figli (Salvatore Nocita, 1985)\n\nIl camorrista (Giuseppe Tornatore, 1986)\n\nTeresa (Dino Risi, 1987)\n\nNuovo Cinema Paradiso (Giuseppe Tornatore, 1989)\n\nSinbad of the Seven Seas (Enzo G.

In 1980 he arrives in Rome, contacted by Paolo Tommasi, set designer and costume designer for Giancarlo Cobelli. After two years as assistant to the costume designer, he meets Pietro Farani who asks him help in running tailoring history: there, the majority of the costumes for the masterpieces in Italian cinema from 60s to 70s were realized. And all of this happened thanks to the collaboration with Danilo Donati, usual costume maker for Pasolini, Fellini e Zeffirelli, two Oscar Awards and several other prizes. Since 1997, after the passing of Farani, the tailoring passes directly into his hands; without disowning his past, tailoring oriented in historical reconstruction of costumes and, with great pride, between his last years' clients we can remember Colleen Atwood, Tim Burton's costume designer, who won four Oscars.\n\nStarting with a small fundus found in tailoring, during the years Piccolo created a notable collection of authentical dresses: more than 3000 pieces, starting from 1750s to High Fashion collections of the 60s; he uses this material for studying, which is very important to philologically reproduce the time.\n\nFor five years now he's teaching, with great passion, reciprocated by his students, History of Cinema at IED in Rome and, for a year now, History of Costume at Accademia di moda e costume (Academy of fashion and costume), which is also based in Rome.\n\nALDINA JURY\n\nSamuele Sbrighi\n\n(Born in Santarcangelo di Romagna, Rimini - 21.10.1975).
