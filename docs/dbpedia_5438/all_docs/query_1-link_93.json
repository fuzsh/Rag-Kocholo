At the age of 11, he took his first violin lessons. The music was in his blood and so two years later he began taking piano lessons. At 14 he made ​​his first steps as a composer and arranger.\n\nFrom 1941 he attended the Conservatory in Frankfurt where he gained first experiences with jazz by Carlo Bohländer and Emil Mangelsdorff. In 1943 he was summoned to the labor service, and is drafted into the Wehrmacht. Heinz Gietz founded his own quartet in 1945 and worked as a jazz musician in the combo of The Hotclub Frankfurt. His first composition he wrote in 1946 for the \"Little Theatre\" and was received in the same year in the STAGMA (later GEMA). After the currency reform of 1948, he worked mainly as a composer and arranger for the Hessian Radio and other broadcasters.\n\nIn 1949 appears the first record with the Heinz Gietz composition \"Scharfe Kurven\". His first \"hit\" arrangement was in 1951 with “Das machen nur die Beine von Dolores”. A year later, his composition \"Blumen für die Dame\" is sung by Gitta Lind and became his first hit. With a new discovery called Caterina Valente in 1953 his first test shots Südwestfunk in Baden-Baden are made. In the same year a long and highly successful collaboration with the lyricist and producer Kurt Feltz starts. Heinz Gietz composed and arranged from 1954, the hits “O Mama, o Mama, o Mamajo” and “Baio Bongo” for Caterina Valente.\n\nDuring the next 10 years Gietz continued to turn out hits for such artists as Valente, Bill Ramsey and Chris Howland. In 1963 Gietz becomes the musical director of \"The Peter Weck Show\" for ARD television. He also penned the love theme, for the film \"Der Musterknabe\", sung by Conny Froboess and Peter Alexander.\n\nIn 1965, he starts his own record label \"Cornet- Records \". He is also musical director of the downstream television series \"Sing ein Lied mit Onkel Bill\" and writes the music for three Euro- western films \"Massacre at Marble City\" (1964), \"Count Bobby, the Terror of the West\" (1965) and \"The Man Called Gringo\" (165). The Cornet label will be decommissioned in 1977 and Gietz began working again as a freelance producer for the EMI Electrola.\n\nIn 1980 Gietz composed, arranged and produced \"Catherine and Potemkin\". Gietz worked during the following years for various television shows, such as \"Glücksspirale\" and is also the musical director of the series \"Wie wär’s heut mit Revue?\" with Harald Juhnke and Ingrid Steeger.\n\nGietz died on December 24, 1989 in Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. He was only 65 years-old.\n\nToday we remember Heinz Gietz on what would have been his 90th birthday.\n\n50 Year Anniversary of Esplugas City\n\nEsplugues remembers its golden years as the home of the 'spaghetti western'\n\nThe Film Studio Balcazar welcomed the filming of fifty Westerns in the 1960s, until a minister for Franco ordered its demolition.\n\nAlmeria was not the only home for Spanish Spaghetti westerns. Catalonia also had a small set, located in the metropolitan area, although there is almost no sign of the location today, neither the physical space or in the collective cultural memory. “$5,000 on One Ace”, “A Pistol for Ringo”, “Oklahoma John” are some western movies that were filmed here during the 1960s in the village known as Esplugas City, a huge set built by the Film Studio Balcazar in Esplugues de Llobregat. The company was one of the most important of its time, I had a studio shoot in the same city, playing Cornella, and looked for a site on which to record the exterior.\n\n\"It was a genuinely American western genre, but the Balcazars were responsible for a new vision and were the foundation for the genre growing in Europe,\" recalls Juan Salvador, Esplugues neighbor who knew firsthand the town and author of Beyond Esplugas City. Those responsible for the Theatrical Productions of Balcazar were Alfonso, Francisco and Jaime Jesus brothers detected the potential importance of having a set to shoot films known as spaghetti westerns, set in the Wild West but filmed in Europe, as it would lower the recording costs.\n\nTime proved them right and in fact after Esplugas City of Oste, three villages were built in the desert of Tabernas Almeria: Fraile (1965), Juan Garcia (1966) , and in the town of Tecisa Gergal (1966).\n\nThis year is the 50th anniversary of the building of the town which will be celebrated. \"We want to remember from a recreational standpoint,\" explains Councillor for Culture, Eduard Sanz, who recalls that the council has commissioned the Council of Nens proposing activities to raise awareness of this heritage city.\n\nThe Balcazars had no relationship with Esplugues but the fire at the facilities used in the mountains of Montjuïc of Barcelona and the inability to restore them made ​​them look for a new space in the Barcelona area. \"The venue was placed in Esplugues where a studio with over 5,500 square meters of sets, and the sets that were recorded outside, with more than 10,000 square meters that used some fields,\" John recalls. In Esplugas City over forty buildings were recreated, from the saloon to the sheriff's office to the general store, barber, blacksmith, hotel, bank and church. Most of the buildings were complete while others were only built with the fronts and there was nothing inside.\n\nJuan Salvador recalls that the village was in full swing between 1964 and 1967. \"It rolled all day and even at night,\" he recalls, and notes that\" the construction of the B-23 motorway meant the movement of the village and the construction of a much smaller set across the highway, where currently is the Mallola school.\"\n\nAlthough the town was in the center of town, it was in an enclosed space that they could not access the neighbors.\" The economic relationship was anecdotal,\" says Councillor for Culture.\" I once walked through the Watcher precinct, as a retired policeman,\" explains John. The actors but not the workers mingled with the neighbors. Juan Salvador recalls,\" The company had a hotel in Barcelona where the actors, who moved to Esplugues studios for filming and then to Esplugas City to shoot were staying.\"\n\nThe operation of the system itself was a certain relationship with a company and the city, as did Figuls pastry candy with which the living room windows were built so they could break without actors suffering damage. \"The students of the school Isidre Martí after school went to collect the remains of crystals and ate them like candy lollipops,\" says John, who recalls that some neighbors also worked as extras in some of the productions. The locals also lived with the noise form the shooting going on at Esplugas City.\n\nThe artistic director of the town, Juan Alberto Soler, also had to find resources to avoid the reality of the city that could sneak into the shootings. To do this, for example, he placed a tower with a large water tank to cover the antennas of buildings, or a fireplace two feet high to make sense of the smoke from the nearby pottery factory Pujol i Baussis, which had two chimneys which operated alternately.\n\nThe move to the new location, in the late 1960s, coincided with the decline of the genre, which revived the series after “They Call Me Trinity”. In the early 1970s, the Balcazar brothers, seeing the decline of the genre, tried to convert the set into a theme park, which would have been the first in Spain. They got the proper permits but they could not make it happen.\n\nIf fire was the end of the Balcazar studies in Barcelona, ​​it also did the same at Esplugues, albeit for different reasons. The Minister of Information and Tourism Alfredo Sánchez Bella Franco discovered the village one day accessed by car from Barcelona El Prat Airport. He considered that \"it was a bad image\" and ordered its dismantling. Given the high cost to demolish the town, the officers of the company decided to record one last film, “Now They Call Him Sacramento”, which ends with a fire that destroyed the entire town. \"It was a spectacular fire that was recorded with three cameras, in case any failed, because it could not be repeated,\" John, who considered this a worthy way he remembers Esplugas City.\n\nHappy 75th Birthday to Terence Hill\n\nMario Girotti was born on March 29, 1939 in Venice, Veneto, Italy. His mother, Hildegard (Thieme), was German, from Dresden, and his father, Girolamo Girotti, was an Italian chemist.\n\nAs a child, he lived in the small town of Lommatzsch, Germany from 1943 to 1945 during World War II, surviving the Dresden Bombing. After being discovered by Italian filmmaker Dino Risi for Vacanze col Gangster “Holiday with the Gangster” (1951) at the early age of 12, he had, after 27 movies in Italy including, a major role in Luchino Visconti's “The Leopard” (1963). In 1964, he returned to Germany and there appeared in a series of, adventure and western films, made from the novels of German author Karl May. In 1967, he returned to Italy to act in “God Forgives... I Don't!” (1968). He changed his name to Terence Hill the same year. The name was made up as a publicity stunt by the film producers; he had to choose from a list of twenty names and picked the one with his mother's initials.\n\nIn the following years, he starred in many action and over nineteen Spaghetti Westerns together with his longtime colleague and friend Bud Spencer. The pair were notable for their comedy films, successful not only in Italy, but also internationally. They made a large number of Italian Westerns and other films together. Many of these have alternate titles, depending upon the country and distributor. Their most famous film is the 1971 western “They Call Me Trinity” and the 1972 sequel “Trinity Is STILL My Name!”. Terence has stated in interviews that “My Name Is Nobody” (1973), in which he co-starred with Henry Fonda, is his personal favorite of all his films.\n\nHis first American films were “Mr. Billion” and “March or Die” (both 1977), after which he divided his time between Italy and the U.S.\n\nHill's adopted son Ross was killed in an accident in Stockbridge, Massachusetts in 1990 while the actor was preparing to film “Lucky Luke” on the Bonanza Creek Ranch near Santa Fe. Hill later went on to a successful television career in Italy.\n\nIn 2000, he landed the leading role in the Italian television series ‘Don Matteo’, as a crime fighting parish priest.\n\nTerence and Bud Spencer were awarded the David di Donatello Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2010.\n\nToday we celebrate Terence Hill’s 75th birthday."
