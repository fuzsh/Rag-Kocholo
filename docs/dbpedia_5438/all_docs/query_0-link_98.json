        "text": "In 1935 the Venice Biennale organized an atypical exhibition commemorating its 40th anniversary. The “Mostra dei Quarant’anni” was mostly devoted to art from the Triveneto. Yet four rooms showed works by European artists who had exhibited in the Biennale, and were part of the collections of the Gallerie d’Arte Moderna in Rome and Venice. The show reflected on the evolution of modern art and of the Biennale between 1895 and 1935, exemplifying the aesthetic criteria of Italian public collections at the time. It included many artists that are still considered part of the modernist canon but most of them are now all but forgotten. It thus represents an optimal case study to analyze renegotiations of the artistic canon. Furthermore, the “Mostra” played a key role in re-defining the international role of Venice within fascist artistic organization. As the “Mostra” took place in the gap year between two Biennales and received little support from governmental institutions, it is generally overlooked in the literature on the period. Yet, on the basis of unpublished archival documentation and of the digital reconstruction of these rooms, this paper argues that the “Mostra dei Quarant’anni” is crucial for our understanding of the history of the Biennale and of the cultural policies of the fascist state.\n\nThe volume addresses the issue of migration from a particular perspective, focusing on cases of artists - or groups of artists - who went to Rome and remained there permanently. The intent is to deepen the understanding of the process of integration of the foreign artist in the local environment, exploring the migration patterns and the dynamics of settlement in the papal city, the parallel, complementary or contrasting experiences of artists who were gradually transformed from \"itinerant\" to stable \"immigrants\". The volume inaugurates the series \"Pensieri ad Arte\", result of the collaboration between Stefan Albl, Francesca Parrilla and Ariane Varela Braga in the framework of the Rome Art History Network. The series hosts volumes of History of Art and Architecture dedicated to Italy and to Rome in particular. With a chronological period open from the Middle Ages to the contemporary, it offers a new space for original investigations, which highlight the richness of artistic contexts and the mutual exchange between local, regional and national cultures. The volumes, in the form of monographs or collections of essays, are the work established scholars and young researchers, both Italian and foreign.\n\nDespite a new interest in historical studies regarding Italy’s colonial past, rare are the researches about artists’ response to colonial theme. Among the many decorative enterprises that Giulio Rosso (object of my PhD research) carried out during the fascist ventennio, the black and white mosaic panels designed for the Foro Mussolini in Rome and the Grand Hotel Uaddan in Tripoli are of much interest once analysed from this particular point of view. Indeed, they both deal with the problem of representing overseas colonies, presenting different approaches and solutions to evidently different exigencies. The Foro Mussolini was built as an example of ‘total work of art’, by the Opera Nazionale Balilla (ONB). In 1936, Corrado Ricci commissioned architect Luigi Moretti with the design of a large entrance thoroughfare to celebrate the conquest of Ethiopia. Moretti chose four artists – Achille Capizzano, Angelo Canevari, Giulio Rosso and Gino Severini - to design 7500 square meters of mosaics celebrating sports and artistic and economic enterprises of the fascist regime. Only two panels referred to contemporary events: Giulio Rosso’s Marcia su Roma and The conquest of Addis Ababa. The latter is a propagandistic collage of different images celebrating war, technology, and submission. It is a comprehensive (and involuntarily merciless) picture of what the public opinion was driven to believe about the self-proclaimed civilizing mission, the organizational efficiency, and the fatal destiny of Fascist Italy. On the other hand, Rosso gave a slightly different picture of colonial life in the mosaics for the so-called Turkish Bath of the Hotel Uaddan. Here another version of the colonial myth was represented, one that is more consistent with the general context of European culture of the time. It recalls a dreamy flight in an imagined Libya, suffused with oriental exoticisms, ready to be enjoyed by foreign tourists and Italian administrators in an exclusive environment.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 70s, on the wake of social and political activism, several Italian artists based their work upon a multi sensory approach to photographs conceived not just as representations, but as material objects and social agents. Mario Cresci was one of these artists, and the peculiarity of his contribution lies in the work he did as a member of the cross-disciplinary collective Il Politecnico. Composed of Cresci himself, along with architects and urbanists, a sociologist and a local historian, the collective was hired by local authorities in 1966 to draw the master plans of two cities in Basilicata, a rural area in southern Italy strongly hit by emigration. The master plans were based on participatory urban planning and practices of active citizenship. Cresci, who was trained as a graphic and product designer, defined himself as an ‘artistic operator’ directly intervening upon reality, acting within complex networks of relations among people, animals and objects. Distancing himself from the sentimentalist and aestheticising nostalgia of the Italian rural south typical of the work of photographers such as Cartier-Bresson, Cresci used his own photographs, as well as family photographs of sorts, as means to trace models of sociability strongly related to the identity of places and people. Though a constant dialogue among Cresci and the other members of Il Politecnico, photographs conceived as material objects with their social biographies were fully integrated into urban planning as research tools and as means of communication, as a way of encouraging historical awareness, building community identity, improving local economy, encouraging local craft.\n\n«Spero che non fra molto, a Lisbona le spalle a Roma il volto», said the young Francisco de Matos, aka Vieira Lusitano (Lisbon, 1699-1783) to his friend and colleague Agostino Ratti (Savona, 1699- Genoa, 1775). He put into words his wish to returning to Rome the city where he has studied. That quote comes from a letter part of the rich epistoclar exchange over the years between both friends. The aforementioned correspondence is known to us through Bottari's Raccolta. It allows us to understand the professional and friendship network built by Vieira during his stay in Rome. «Spero che non fra molto, a Lisbona le spalle a Roma il volto». Con estas palabras trasladaba el joven Francisco de Matos, más conocido como Vieira Lusitano (Lisboa, 1699-1783), a su amigo y compañero de fatigas Agostino Ratti (Savona, 1699- Génova, 1775) su deseo de regresar a la ciudad en la que se había formado. Esa carta es el inicio de un conspicuo intercambio epistolar enriquecido con dibujos y grabados que a lo largo de los años compartirían y del que se tiene constancia gracias a la Raccolta de Bottari . Esta fuente permite reconstruir parcialmente las relaciones profesionales y amistosas que Vieira desarrolló en su estancia en Roma y que habrían de servirle en su exordio en el panorama internacional."
