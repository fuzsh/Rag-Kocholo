He worked for more than 40 years as a correspondent for Reuters news agency, with postings in Europe, the Middle East, the United States and Rome. Since retirement in 2012, he has devoted himself to translation, mainly of poetry including a selection of work by the Latin poet Propertius and La Divina Commedia.)\n\nPatrick Worsnip will be introduced by the poet Jeffrey Wainwright.\n\nUmberto Saba (1883-1957) is one of the towering figures of Twentieth-Century Italian poetry, jointly with Eugenio Montale and Giuseppe Ungaretti. His Canzoniere (first published in 1921, but subsequently re-edited and expanded until its final edition of 1956) was much loved and embraced by younger poets and yet, it is still today rarely frequented by Italian readers, and, what’s more important for us today, virtually unknown to British readers. This is being redressed at last, by the volume Umberto Saba, 100 Poems, edited and translated by Patrick Worsnip, published by Carcanet Press.\n\nPresentation of the volume, which then will be followed by a poetry reading in English and Italian.\n\nThe talk (in English and Italian) will be followed by a social gathering with a glass of wine and nibbles.\n\nAdmission: members FREE / non-members £ 3.00\n\nTo better arrange seating and refreshments, please book in advance by emailing us at dante@newfuture.org\n\nAGM (Riunione Annuale Soci) – members only\n\nFriday 17 March 2023 – 6.00pm (ZOOM)\n\nPlease confirm your attendance to dante@newfuture.org and you will receive the Zoom link a couple of days prior to the meeting.\n\nAGM (Annual General Meeting / Riunione Annuale Soci) – members only\n\n– Welcome/opening remarks\n\n– Treasurer’s report 2022\n\n– All members of the current Executive Committee to step-down except for the Honorary President\n\n– New Executive Committee to be elected\n\n– Overview of SDA activities in 2022\n\n– Discussion and proposals for future events and activities in 2023\n\n– Any other relevant business\n\nVi aspettiamo!\n\nTransitions in Print: Revealing Secrets of the European Printing Revolution\n\nThursday 9 February 2023 – Arrival 5:00pm onwards – Talk starts at 5:45pm\n\nJohn Rylands Research Institute and Library, 150 Deansgate, Manchester M3 3EH\n\nIt will be possible to browse/visit the exhibition from 5:00-5:45pm on arrival, with the talk/presentation and close up session to take place between 5:45-6:45 in the Teaching Room.\n\nhe Rylands has one of the world’s greatest collections of 15th-century European printing.

Prof. Stephen Milner has been particularly involved in one project that uses protein and DNA analysis of interrogate books printed on parchment (animal skin), especially in Venice during the time of Aldus Manutius the famous printer and inventor of the ‘italic’ typeface.\n\nTalk by our Honorary President, Prof. Stephen J.

Cineuropa\n\nMaud Crayon (Valérie Donzelli), a single mother and struggling architect, wins a competition to redesign the esplanade in front of Notre-Dame. What should be a career-defining opportunity, however, only brings more drama when the project becomes a media scandal. Juggling professional challenges with the complications presented by her ex-fiancé, Bacchus (Pierre Deladonchamps), Maud’s quest to find a sense of balance is easier said than done.

Lina Wertmüller with Giancarlo Giannini, Fernando Rey, Shirley Stoler\n\nThis film is a journey into the moral awareness of an everyday Neapolitan man – Pasquale Frafuso – ironically nicknamed by local people as Pasqualino Sette Bellezze (seven beauties). In 1930s Fascist Italy, he makes a point of living a carefree life, steering clear of any socio-political discourse. Yet life and history have a different plan for him. So after a funny start, the story takes a dramatic twist, as Pasqualino’s attempt to escape from a mental hospital ends in his imprisonment in a Nazi concentration camp. Here he will be forced to face horrible and impossible choices in order to survive. For this film, Lina Wertmüller was the first female director to be nominated for the Academy Awards in 1977, together with nominations as best screenplay written directly for the screen; best actor in a leading role (Giancarlo Giannini) and best foreign language film.\n\nWhen she received an Honorary Academy Award in 2019, trailblazing Italian filmmaker Lina Wertmüller added another historic notch in her career belt.\n\nIn Italian with English subtitles\n\nRegister here\n\nwww.eventbrite.co.uk/e/breaking-the-celluloid-ceiling-women-in-european-cinema-day-4-screening-tickets-303524258227\n\nDante, light and technology\n\nSaturday 2 April 2022 – 4.15pm for 4.30pm start\n\nCross Street Chapel, Cross Street, Manchester M2 1NL\n\nA talk by Jim Howell and Angelo Cangelosi (Professor of Machine Learning and Robotics at the University of Manchester) with “special guest” the small robot Nao.\n\nJim Howell – Dante was fascinated by light both poetically and scientifically.

The composition is divided into the fourteen customary stations plus the introductory hymn “Vexilla Regis”: in many ways, it is the only reflection of the last hours of Jesus’ life on earth written for piano.\n\nAmong the many performances of the Via Crucis by Alessandra are those at the Franz Liszt Museum and Academy in Budapest, the Musei Vaticani, Casa Verdi, the Philharmonia of Krakow, Villa d’Este in Tivoli, the Cathedrals of Sheffield, Lancaster, Glasgow and Wrexham.\n\nFor more info, please visit https://www.alessandrapompili.com/projects\n\n“Ricomincio da tre / I am starting from three”\n\n(members only)\n\nSunday 14th February at 4 PM (on Zoom)\n\nOn St. Valentine’s Day, members of our Society are invited to watch together the lovely movie by Massimo Troisi, “I am starting from three”, a celebration of love and friendship.

I poeti/librettisti, generalmente di modesto calibro, eccetto qualche rara eccezione, riflettevano il livello della poesia dei melodrammi nel XIX secolo, un periodo nel quale il rapporto tra parola e musica vedeva quest’ultima dominare. Ascolteremo una serie di esempi tratti da opere di Verdi, per evidenziare il peculiare uso della lingua italiana nei libretti d’opera verdiani e mostrare come Verdi abbia influenzato i suoi librettisti sulla base delle idee musicali che aveva in mente. Si cercherà inoltre di chiarire il concetto di “parola scenica” col quale si intende definire la qualità drammatica di un testo operistico. Questo è un concetto coniato da Verdi nel 1870 che si basa sull’idea che ciò che è rilevante in un libretto è l’efficacia drammaturgica delle parole e della trama, piuttosto che la sublimità e la qualità letteraria del linguaggio stesso.\n\nRoberta Collingwood è un Music Editor. Ha lavorato per 9 anni per Casa Ricordi (l’editore, tra gli altri, di Verdi e Puccini). È attualmente il Redattore Coordinatore della nuova Edizione Critica delle Opere di Antonio Vivaldi, pubblicata dall’Istituto Italiano Antonio Vivaldi di Venezia, in collaborazione con Casa Ricordi. Ha conseguito il dottorato di ricerca in musicologia al King’s College London (University of London), sotto la guida del Professor Roger Parker. Il suo ambito di ricerca è la filologia della musica applicata al repertorio operistico italiano di Ottocento e primo Novecento.\n\n……………\n\nENGLISH\n\nThe libretto as a literary genre has never enjoyed praise, more often has been the object of harsh criticism. Poets/librettists were generally of modest stature, with a few exceptions, and reflected the level of the poetry for librettos in the 19th century, a period in which the relationship between word and music saw the latter as dominant. We will listen to a series of examples from Verdi’s work, in order to highlight the peculiar use of Italian language in the librettos for his operas, and see how he influenced librettists’ writing on the basis of the musical ideas he had in mind. We will try to clarify the concept “parola scenica” (theatrical word) meant to describe the dramatic quality of an opera text. This is a key concept coined by Verdi in 1870 based on the idea that what is relevant in a libretto is the dramaturgical effectiveness of words and storyline, rather than the sublimity and literary quality of the language itself.\n\nRoberta Collingwood is a Music Editor. She worked for 9 years for Casa Ricordi (the Italian publisher of Verdi and Puccini, amongst others). She is currently the Managing Editor of the new Critical Edition of the Works of Antonio Vivaldi, published by the Istituto Italiano Antonio Vivaldi in Venice, in partnership with Ricordi. She undertook a PhD in Music Research at King’s College London (University of London), under the supervision of Professor Roger Parker. Her research interests are philology of music and 19th-century and early 20th-century Italian opera studies.\n\n……………\n\nTo allow us to organise the seats and nibbles please book in advance at dante@newfuture.org\n\nWe are also pleased to inform you that the opera Don Pasquale performed in London on Thursday 24th October will be screened live at Vue Manchester Printworks, Manchester M4 2BS, and replicated the following Sunday.\n\nCONCERTO DI NATALE –\n\nCHRISTMAS RECITAL\n\nSUNDAY 8th December 2019 – 4.30PM for 5.00PM start\n\nVenue: Cross Street Chapel, Cross Street, Manchester M2 1NL\n\n(Download the leaflet: Music Recital – Natale 2019)\n\nThe recital will include works by Puccini, Rossini, Bellini, Leoncavallo, Tosti and more…\n\nIsla MacEwan Soprano\n\nTim Kennedy Piano\n\nCome along for a special gathering to exchange the Season’s greetings over a glass (or two, why not?) of Prosecco and a slice of panettone or pandoro!\n\nAdmission: members £ 2.00 / non-members £ 4.00\n\nAdvanced booking is appreciated in order for us to get enough panettone and (above all!)

During the celebrations, horse races were organised and labour animals were dispensed from work and decorated with flowers. Such ancient traditions are still alive today, virtually unchanged in their form and participation, during the “Palio dell’Assunta” which takes place on 16 August in Siena.\n\nThe popular tradition of the Ferragosto trip arises during Fascism. Starting from the second half of the 1920s, in the mid-August period, the regime organised hundreds of popular trips, due to the setting up of the “People’s Trains of Ferragosto”, at hard discounted prices. The initiative gave the opportunity also to the less well-off social classes to visit Italian cities or to reach seaside and mountain resorts.\n\nFriday 20 May 2016 – 6.45 pm for 7.00 pm start\n\nOf Publishers, Poets, and Politicians: the story of the 1911 ‘Edizione Monumentale’ of the Divine Comedy‘ (the talk will be in English)\n\nThis paper will tell the extraordinary story of a major initiative to produce a deluxe edition of Dante’ s Divina commedia in 1911 under the patronage of KIng Vittorio Emanuele III. The tale involves a cast of the great and good of Italian literature, scholarship, and publishing in the early 1900s and an expected connection with the ‘Manchester Dante Society’ which was founded in 1906. Involving rare books, court cases, and battleships, this talk will tell the story for the first time of how this famous landmark edition of Dante’s classic poem came into being.\n\nSpeaker: Stephen Milner, Serena Professor of Italian, The University of Manchester\n\nVenue: Cross Street Chapel, Cross Street, Manchester M2 1NL\n\nThe evening will close with a social gathering and some conversation in Italian over a glass of wine and nibbles.\n\nAdmission: FREE for members and students – £ 3.00 for non-members\n\n*****\n\nSunday 22 May 2016 from 16:00 to 18:30\n\nEMERGENCY EXIT – Young Italians Abroad\n\nMembers and Friends of our Society are invited to attend the following film/documentary screening:\n\nVenue: RNCM Stage Door – Rosamond Street West, Manchester, M13 9RD\n\nTickets £3.52 – Available from www.eventbrite.co.uk\n\nwww.eventbrite.co.uk/e/emergency-exit-young-italians-abroad-film-screening–tickets-22493627044?utm_campaign=201308&ref=esfb&utm_source=Facebookenivtefor001\n\nCOM.IT.ES (Comitato degli Italiani all’Estero) Manchester presents ‘Emergency Exit’, a documentary project about Italy and the consequences of the last 20 years of politics on the young generation. A lot of young Italians leave their country every year and more than 90% of them are graduated and professionally skilled. They move away because of a lot of reason, but nobody in Italy seems to have the desire to listen or care for them.

Sisters Fiordiligi and Dorabella are engaged to Guglielmo and Ferrando. The men trust their fiancées’ faithfulness implicitly but when their friend Don Alfonso tells them a woman’s fidelity is never guaranteed, he is challenged to prove his theory. So a wager is made. Don Alfonso tells the sisters that their sweethearts are to be sent away with their regiment. A tearful farewell follows. Then things really start to get complicated…\n\nMozart’s opera is the great composer’s most divisive and controversial work.\n\nDeep down, Cosí provides a sharp reminder of how personal choice plays as important a part as fate in our relationships.
