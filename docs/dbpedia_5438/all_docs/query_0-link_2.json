        "text": "Since the origins of cinematographic art, Italian directors have influenced and inspired the most famous directors from all over the world, creating some of the most important absolutely must-see movie, cinema masterpieces of all time. Italy is one of the birthplaces of arthouse cinema and the artistic element has actually been the most essential element in the history of Italian cinema.\n\nThe first Italian filmmakers began to take an interest in films a couple of months after the Lumière brothers began their film exhibitions. The very first Italian director is thought to have been Vittorio Calcina, an associate of the Lumière brothers, who filmed Pope Leo XIII in 1896. The very first films date back to 1896 and were shot in the main Italian cities. These short experiments immediately interested the working class as entertainment, motivating Italian directors to produce unreleased films to the point of laying the foundations for the birth of a real film market. In the early years of the 20th century, silent cinema established itself, with various avant-garde Italian directors. In the early 1900s, creative and legendary films such as Othello (1906), The Last Days of Pompeii (1908), The Inferno (1911), Quo Vadis (1913), and Cabiria (1914), were made as adaptations of books or theatrical performances. Italian directors used elaborate sets, luxurious clothing and record spending plans to produce pioneering films.\n\nThe first European film movement, Italian futurism, dates back to the late 1910s. After a period of contraction in the 1920s, the Italian film market rejuvenated in the 1930s with the arrival of sound cinema. Many Italian directors dedicated themselves in those years to the cinema of Telefoni Bianchi, comedies with attractive settings. While the Italian fascist government provided financial support to the country’s film market, particularly the construction of the Cinecittà studios, the largest film studio in Europe, it similarly participated in censorship, and thus many Italian films produced in the late 1930s they were films by propaganda. A renewal for Italian directors occurred at the end of the Second World War with the birth of the Italian neorealist movement, which achieved broad public and critical consensus throughout the post-war period, and which introduced the careers of Luchino Visconti, Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica. Neorealism declined in the late 1950s in favor of lighter films, such as those of Italian comedy and great directors such as Federico Fellini and Michelangelo Antonioni. Actresses such as Sophia Loren, Giulietta Masina and Gina Lollobrigida achieved worldwide fame during that period.\n\nFrom the mid-1950s to the end of the 1970s, Commedia all’Italiana and many other categories developed thanks to auteur cinema, and Italian directors achieved a position of excellence both nationally and abroad. [13] [14] Spaghetti Westerns achieved appeal in the mid-1960s, reaching their peak with Sergio Leone’s Dollars Trilogy. Italian erotic thrillers, or Giallo, produced by Italian directors such as Mario Bava and Dario Argento in the 1970s, influenced the horror category around the world. In the 1980s, for various reasons, Italian directors went through a crisis. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Italian directors such as Ermanno Olmi, Bernardo Bertolucci, Giuseppe Tornatore, Gabriele Salvatores and Roberto Benigni brought Italian cinema crucial praise, while the most appreciated directors of the 2000s and 2010s were Matteo Garrone, Paolo Sorrentino, Marco Bellocchio, Nanni Moretti.\n\nHere is a partial list of Italian directors to know (in alphabetical order)\n\nGianni Amelio\n\nGianni Amelio was born in San Pietro di Magisano, province of Catanzaro, in Calabria. His father moved to Argentina soon after he was born. He spent his youth and adolescence with his mother and grandmother. The lack of a father figure will be a common thread in Amelio’s future works. During his university studies in Messina, Amelio began to think about cinema, writing as a film critic for a local newspaper. In 1965 he moved to Rome, where he worked as an operator and assistant director for people such as Liliana Cavani and Vittorio De Seta.\n\nAmelio’s initial work is the television film La città del sole, directed in 1973 for RAI and inspired by the work of Tommaso Campanella. In 1982 he made his film debut with Colpire al cuore, about Italian terrorism, presented at the Venice Film Festival. In 1987 Amelio created The Boys of Through Panisperna, about the lives of Italian physicists of the 1930s such as Enrico Fermi and Edoardo Amaldi. 1989’s Open Doors (Open Doors), including Gian Maria Volonté, established Amelio as one of Italy’s best directors and won best foreign film at the 1991 Academy Awards.\n\nInteresting was The Child Thief in 1992, which won the Special Jury Prize at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival plus 2 Silver Ribbons and 5 David di Donatello.
