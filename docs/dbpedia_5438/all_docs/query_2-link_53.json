        "text": "BUZZ VENICE FILMS\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nAchilles And The Tortoise (Akires To Kame) (Jap)\n\nDir: Takeshi Kitano\n\nThe story: Follows a failed painter and the long-suffering family that supports him.\n\nThe cast: Kitano takes the lead, alongside Kanako Higuchi and popular actress Kumiko Aso, whose credits include Dororo.\n\nThe buzz: A well-established figure on the Lido, Kitano returns with a more orthodox tale which features his own artwork - he is known for his painting talent - as did his 1997 Golden Lion winner Hana-bi.\n\nInt'l sales: Celluloid Dreams, (33) 1 49 70 03 70\n\nBirdwatchers (La Terra Degli Uomini Rossi) (It)\n\nDir: Marco Bechis\n\nThe story: Amazon-set film about personal identity and tribal heritage as two worlds collide.\n\nThe cast: Claudio Santamaria, one of Italy's top talents, with credits including Crime Novel and Casino Royale, stars with Chiara Caselli and a Brazilian cast of professionals including Leonardo Medeiros and non-professionals.\n\nThe buzz: Bechis spent years preparing the film, working with the Amazon natives. The director's last appearance in Venice was in Cinema del Presente in 2001 with Hijos, also set in Brazil.\n\nInt'l sales: Celluloid Dreams, (33) 1 49 70 03 70.\n\nA Perfect Day (Un Giorno Perfetto) (It)\n\nDir: Ferzan Ozpetek\n\nThe story: An adaptation of the novel by popular writer Melania Mazzucco, which looks at life in Rome over 24 hours.\n\nThe cast: As with his previous films, Ozpetek lines up an ensemble cast of Italy's best-loved actors - Valerio Mastandrea and Isabella Ferrari top the bill alongside veteran actress Stefania Sandrelli.\n\nThe buzz: Last year Ozpetek was on the Venice jury and this is his first year in Venice's official competition. The film is also his first to be produced by Domenico Procacci's Fandango. It is co-produced by Rai Cinema.\n\nInt'l sales: Fandango Portobello, (44) 20 7605 1396; Claudia Tomassini, (39) 334 3075056\n\nThe Hurt Locker (US)\n\nDir: Kathryn Bigelow\n\nThe story: The new leader of an elite bomb-disposal unit in Iraq plunges his soldiers into a game of urban combat which has long-term effects on their lives.\n\nThe cast: Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty, Ralph Fiennes.\n\nThe buzz: Bigelow can always be relied on to deliver heart-pounding thrills with intelligent storytelling. She returns to Venice for the first time in 13 years since the world premiere of Strange Days.\n\nNorth American rights: CAA, (1) 424 288 2000\n\nInt'l sales: Voltage Pictures, (1) 310 890 4199\n\nThe Burning Plain (US)\n\nDir: Guillermo Arriaga\n\nThe story: Four interlinked tales of love and redemption examine the lengths to which people will go to exorcise the demons of the past.\n\nThe cast: Charlize Theron and Kim Basinger.\n\nThe buzz: The feature directorial debut from the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Babel and 21 Grams has been a while in the making. Can Arriaga translate his writer's gift for complex storytelling into a well-crafted feature'\n\nNorth American sales: UTA, (1) 310 271 6700\n\nInt'l sales: 2929 International, (1) 310 309 5200\n\nInland (Gabbla) (Alg-Fr)\n\nDir: Tariq Teguia\n\nThe story: A topographer meets a traumatised woman in western Algeria who persuades him to accompany her back home across the Sahara and through war-torn regions in the east.\n\nThe cast: Unknowns including Kader Affak, Ines Rose Djakou, Fethi Ghares, Kouider Medjahed and Djalila Kadi-Hanifi star alongside Ahmed Benaissa who also appeared in Teguia's Rome Rather Than You.\n\nThe buzz: Inland is one of two African films in competition at Venice this year. Director Teguia has an impressive track record - his debut, the short film Hacla, won the special jury award at Marrakesh in 2003 and his second film, Rome Rather Than You, was in Venice's Horizons sidebar in 2006. Marco Mueller has called him the 'most important voice of new Arab cinema'.\n\nInt'l sales: Neffa Films, (213) 66209 6500\n\nInju, La Bete Dans L'Ombre (Fr)\n\nDir: Barbet Schroeder\n\nThe story: A French writer heads to Japan to promote his new book and becomes embroiled in a real-life thriller.\n\nThe cast: Benoit Magimel, Lika Minamoto and Shun Sugata. Magimel is a huge star in France and one of the most prolific actors working today; international audiences may recognise him from Michael Haneke's The Piano Teacher. This is Minamoto's first major role while Sugata has done much work in Japan and had small roles in such US fare as Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol 1 and The Last Samurai.\n\nThe buzz: This is a return to Venice for Schroeder who last competed in 2000 with Our Lady Of The Assassins. For that film he took the president of the Italian senate's gold medal. Inju is Schroeder's first fiction work in France since 1986 (last year he directed the documentary Terror's Advocate, about French attorney Jacques Verges).\n\nInt'l sales: UGC International, (33) 1 46 40 44 00\n\nJerichow (Ger)\n\nDir: Christian Petzold\n\nThe story: A young man returns to his home town in eastern Germany and begins an affair with a married woman. Their plan to murder her husband triggers a catastrophe.\n\nThe cast: Jerichow marks Petzold's fourth collaboration with lead actress Nina Hoss following Something To Remind Me, Wolfsburg and Yella, for which she was awarded the best actress Silver Bear at last year's Berlinale. It is also the third time the director has cast Benno Furmann (previously seen in Wolfsburg and Ghosts), but the first project with Turkish-born actor Hilmi Sozer, the third member of the love triangle.\n\nThe buzz: Partly inspired by Vincente Minnelli's 1958 film Some Came Running, Jerichow is 'about love, honesty, deception and betrayal', says Petzold. It is his seventh film with Berlin-based producer Schramm Film which also produced his drama The State I Am In (it premiered in Venice's Cinema del Presente sidebar in 2000). According to producer Florian Koerner von Gustorf: 'Christian is drawing the essence out of all of his previous works and letting everything flow into Jerichow.'\n\nInt'l sales: The Match Factory, (49) 2 21 5 39 70 90\n\nMilk (Sut) (Turk-Fr-Ger)\n\nDir: Semih Kaplanoglu\n\nThe story: The second film in Kaplanoglu's 'Yusef' trilogy - Egg, Milk, Honey - which focuses on the change in the social and economic life in the Anatolian provinces within the framework of a mother-son relationship. Milk is about a young boy who discovers his mother is having a secret affair with the town's stationmaster.\n\nThe cast: Melih Selcuk plays Yusef, while Basak Koklukaya plays the boy's mother. Her most recent film, Kucuk Kiyamet, was in competition at the Istanbul film festival last year, and she has starred in films for Ferzan Ozpetek.\n\nThe buzz: Milk is the first Turkish film to screen in competition at Venice since Omer Kavur's Gizli Yuz in 1991. No stranger to success on the international festival circuit (winning nine of the 10 awards for which he has competed), it is not surprising Kaplanoglu is 'excited' to be at Venice for the first time. Could be one to watch.\n\nInt'l sales: Match Factory, (49) 2 21 5 39 7090\n\nNuit De Chien (Fr)\n\nDir: Werner Schroeter\n\nThe story: A man returns to a fictitious country to join the woman he loves. Instead, he confronts a violent militia which is terrorising the city and has sent it spiralling into chaos.\n\nThe cast: A starry line-up includes Pascal Greggory, Bruno Todeschini, Eric Caravaca, Amira Casar, Jean-Francois Stevenin and Elsa Zylberstein. The prolific Greggory last appeared in 2007's smash hit La Vie En Rose.\n\nThe buzz: This is Schroeter's first time in competition in Venice. The German director's last film was also a French effort, Deux in 2002.\n\nInt'l sales: Alfama Films Productions, (33) 1 42 01 07 05\n\nPaper Soldier (Bumazhny Soldat) (Rus)\n\nDir: Aleksey German Jr\n\nThe story: Set in the Baikonur space centre in 1961, Paper Soldier is the story of a doctor involved in preparations for the first human space flight, who is torn between his wife and his lover.\n\nThe cast: Acclaimed Russian actress Chulpan Khamatova, who appeared in Good Bye Lenin!, stars alongside her Luna Papa co-star, Georgian actor Merab Ninidze, and newcomer Anastasya Shevelyova, a theatre actress from Omsk in Siberia.\n\nThe buzz: This is the second time German has appeared in competition at Venice. His last film, Garpastum, competed in 2005, and he also won the Luigi De Laurentiis special mention in 2003 for The Last Train (Posledniy Poezd). German, one of Russia's hottest young directors, says he has his 'fingers crossed' for a win this year.\n\nInt'l sales: Elle Driver, (33) 1 56 43 48 76\n\nPlastic City (Dangkou) (Braz-Chi-HK-Jap)\n\nDir: Yu Lik-wai\n\nThe story: Set amid the Japanese immigrant community in Sao Paulo, the story follows an Asian gangster who is forced to defend his father's criminal empire when the older man is arrested and then disappears into the jungle.\n\nThe cast: Japanese star Joe Odagiri (Shinobi, Bright Future) heads the cast which also include Hong Kong's Anthony Wong (Infernal Affairs) and promising Chinese actress Huang Yi.\n\nThe buzz: Renowned as a DoP who works with Jia Zhangke, Hong Kong-born Yu Lik-wai has previously directed two highly stylised features - Love Will Tear Us Apart and All Tomorrow's Parties - which were both selected for Cannes. His third feature deals with gangsters in an intriguing multicultural setting, although the action is more psychological then physical, and his depiction of Sao Paulo is tinged with hallucinatory visuals.\n\nInt'l sales: Celluloid Dreams, (33) 1 49 70 03 70\n\nThe Other One (L'Autre) (Fr)\n\nDirs: Patrick-Mario Bernard, Pierre Trividic\n\nThe story: Based on the novel L'Occupation by Annie Ernaux, The Other One follows a woman who becomes dangerously obsessed with the new woman in her ex-lover's life.\n\nThe cast: Dominique Blanc, one of France's best-known stars who has won several Cesars including best actress for 2001's Stand-by, stars alongside Cyril Guei, Peter Bonke and Christele Tual.\n\nThe buzz: The film is the fifth collaboration between writer-directors Bernard and Trividic - they made their feature debut with festival favourite Dancing in 2003 in which they also starred. Their credits include Ceci Est Une Pipe for Canal Plus and a programme about author HP Lovecraft for France 3.\n\nInt'l sales: Films Distribution, (33) 1 53 10 33 99\n\nPonyo On The Cliff By The Sea (Gake No Ue No Ponyo) (Jap)\n\nDir: Hayao Miyazaki\n\nThe story: Animated fantasy about a fish with a girl's face who befriends a young boy.\n\nThe buzz: Japan's animation giant returns to the Lido four years after Howl's Moving Castle screened in competition and won a Golden Osella. Here, Miyazaki trades CG for a hand-painted watercolour look.\n\nA megahit in Japan, grossing $50m and counting, Ponyo's international premiere in Venice comes ahead of a US release by Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy. The pair were requested to head the project by Ponyo producer Toshio Suzuki.\n\nInt'l sales: Wild Bunch, (33) 1 5301 5021\n\nRachel Getting Married (US)\n\nDir: Jonathan Demme\n\nThe story: A cynical drama queen returns home for a family wedding and awakens deep tensions.\n\nThe cast: Anne Hathaway, Rosemarie DeWitt, Debra Winger.\n\nThe buzz: Demme returns to Venice with a top-notch female cast following last year's Fipresci-prize winner Jimmy Carter Man From Plains and 2004's The Manchurian Candidate.\n\nNorth American distribution: Sony Pictures Classics\n\nInt'l distribution: Sony Pictures Releasing International\n\nIl Seme Della Discordia (It)\n\nDir: Pappi Corsicato\n\nThe story: Comic unofficial remake of Eric Rohmer's The Marquise Of O. A young woman has to explain her pregnancy to her husband on the day he discovers he is sterile.\n\nThe cast: Alessandro Gassman and Caterina Murino (Casino Royale) take the lead roles. Gassman recently earned Italy's David Di Donatello award for best supporting actor for his role as Nanni Moretti's brother in Quiet Chaos. The cast also includes A Perfect Day's Isabella Ferrari.\n\nThe buzz: This film from Neapolitan director Corsicato provides the comedy relief in this year's competition; he was last in competition in Venice with The Vesuvians.

He was honoured at Locarno in 1976 for Harvest: 3,000 Years (Mirt Sost Shi Amit) which took the Silver Leopard. In Berlin he picked up the Fipresci award in 1983 for Ashes And Embers, and his Sankofa appeared there in competition in 1993.\n\nInt'l sales: The Match Factory, (49) 2 215 39 7090\n\nVegas: Based On A True Story (US)\n\nDir: Amir Naderi\n\nThe story: A compulsive gambler and his long-suffering wife who live on outskirts of Las Vegas are made an offer by a stranger which tests how far they are prepared to go.\n\nThe cast: Mark Greenfield, Nancy La Scala and Zach Thomas in their first starring roles.\n\nThe buzz: Iranian writer-director-photographer Amir Naderi's fifth US feature claims to be an intense tale about money and obsession based on true-life stories told to the director during his stay in Sin City. It marks his third trip to Venice after The Runner (Davandeh) in 1985 (in the Venezia Speciali section) and Manhattan By Numbers in 1993 (Windows On Images). His A, B, C... Manhattan was screened in Un Certain Regard at Cannes in 1997.\n\nInt'l sales: Cinetic Media, (1) 212 204 7979\n\nThe Wrestler (US)\n\nDir: Darren Aronofsky\n\nThe story: A former pro wrestler, now on the amateur circuit, seeks one final showdown with his arch-rival.\n\nThe cast: Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei.\n\nThe buzz: Two years after premiering The Fountain, Aronofsky returns to the Lido with a tale of courage and transformation that has sparked talk of possible awards for Rourke. At press time, rights were available in North America, Spain, Australia, Scandinavia, Japan and Latin America.\n\nNorth American rights: CAA\n\nInt'l sales: Wild Bunch, (33) 1 53 01 50 25\n\nThe Sky Crawlers (Jap)\n\nDir: Mamoru Oshii\n\nThe story: Based on the best-selling novel by Hiroshi Mori, this animated film centres on teenage pilots who are raised to engage in aerial battles over Europe for the entertainment of adults.\n\nThe cast: An A-list Japanese voice cast is headed by Oscar-nominated actress Rinko Kikuchi (Babel) and Ryo Kase (Letters From Iwo Jima).\n\nThe buzz: Oshii's Innocence was the first animated Japanese film to compete for the Palme d'Or and he returns to the Lido a year after his Tachigui: The Amazing Lives Of The Fast Food Grifters screened in the Horizons sidebar in 2006. Oshii explores new emotional depths in the film which also boasts Production I.G's CG wizardry.\n\nInt'l sales: Nippon Television Network Corp, (81) 3 6215 2882\n\nIl Papa Di Giovanna (It)\n\nDir: Pupi Avati\n\nThe story: Set in the 1930s and 1940s, Il Papa is the story of an artist who is dedicated to his daughter; but tragedy ensues when she commits murder.\n\nThe cast: Silvio Orlando (Quiet Chaos, The Caiman), Alba Rohrwacher (Days And Clouds, My Brother's An Only Child) and Francesca Neri star.\n\nThe buzz: The film has the most downbeat subject matter of the Italian entries, however Marco Mueller describes it as the 'zenith' of Avati's career. The director has only once been in competition in Venice, with 2005's La Seconda Notte Di Nozze. He served on the jury in 1989. Medusa distributes.\n\nInt'l sales: DueA, (39) 06 321 4851; Medusa, (39) 06 663 901\n\nOUT OF COMPETITION\n\n35 Rhums (Fr)\n\nDir: Claire Denis\n\nThe story: Drama about the relationship between a father and his adult daughter.\n\nThe cast: Eriq Ebouaney stars with Gregoire Colin and Alex Descas.

Helena Ignez, the muse of 1970s B-movies, also stars.\n\nThe buzz: This is the third part in the Coffin Joe trash- horror trilogy and closes the story that began with At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul (1963) and This Night I'll Possess Your Corpse (1967).

Besides a segment of the compilation Chacun Son Cinema for Cannes in 2007, his most recent film was one third of the trilogy Tickets, which premiered at Berlin in 2005.\n\nInt'l sales: TBC\n\nVinyan (Fr-UK-Bel)\n\nDir: Fabrice du Welz\n\nThe story: A couple lose their son in the 2004 tsunami in Thailand. Searching for him, they find a nightmare community ruled by children.\n\nThe cast: Emmanuelle Beart is joined by Rufus Sewell and Julie Dreyfus. Beart is a huge star in France and here will speak English along with UK actor Sewell (The Holiday). Dreyfus also stars in Tokyo, the triptych by Leos Carax, Bong Joon-ho and Michel Gondry which screened at Cannes.\n\nThe buzz: Du Welz burst on the scene at Cannes in 2004 with Calvaire. Vinyan has been a long-gestating project that has a lot of buzz surrounding it.
