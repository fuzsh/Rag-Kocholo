One of the great Italian passions. To watch, to practice, to play, to applaud.\n\nAn exhibition on the history, present and future of sport in Italy is an opportunity to recount not only the great Italian achievements in the various competitive disciplines but also the entire transformation of the country through a unique lens.\n\nIts great economic, social, cultural and urban changes, its vices and virtues, its strengths and weaknesses: its great loves and antipathies.\n\nThere is no sport that does not reflect the profound changes taking place in the country, and the issues and doubts that our sport raises are the litmus test for as many open questions about Italy’s present and future.\n\nNot just an exhibition about sport, but an exhibition that tells the great choral story of a country that underwent profound changes in the 20th century and is changing ever more rapidly.\n\nA country that, thanks to its communities of Italians abroad and its rich international collective imagination, enjoys a projection that transcends national borders and spans the globe.\n\nQUOTE\n\n“The Republic recognises the educational, social value and promotion of psychophysical well-being of sporting activity in all its forms”. Art. 33 Constitution of the Italian Republic\n\n——————————————\n\nTwentieth Century\n\nThe twentieth century was the century that changed Italy the most. A century characterised by great economic, socio-professional and cultural transformations, of great movements of people, the century of urbanisation and the conquest of wealth. We went from peasants to office workers, from hunger to obesity, but the inequalities remained, between north and south, between town and country, between rich and poor, between men and women.\n\nIt was also the century in which Italians discovered and fell in love with sport. It was a bumpy road, but one that led to a general expansion of the presence of sport in our society.\n\nThis section is therefore a great tribute to all those Italians who, day after day, in the midst of their daily lives, practise sport, out of passion, out of love, in order to live a better life. It is a wish for more and more of them in the future.\n\nITALY – YEAR 1900\n\nOn 1 January 1900, Italy was a backward country with a GDP half that of Great Britain. 44% of Italians lived below the poverty line, 30% were undernourished. 9 out of 10 Italians worked in the fields, 1 in 4 children died before the age of 5, and life expectancy was 30. It was not an ideal environment for sport: bodies were shaped by hard labour, manual farming and industrial activities that relied on the exploitation of workers’ physical strength.\n\nWithin twenty years, Italy began a first phase of transformation. During the so-called ‘Giolittian Age’, with the creation of the first modern infrastructure networks and the first large industries, the industrial and financial bourgeoisie emerged in the cities of the north and began to imitate the lifestyles of the rest of Europe, including the practice of sport.\n\nDISCOVERING THE COUNTRY\n\nIn 1894, a group of young entrepreneurs from Milan founded the Touring Club Ciclistico Italiano – the future Touring Club Italiano – with the aim of providing its members with a network of contacts and services for travelling by bicycle, car, train and on foot. The CAI-Club Alpino Italiano was founded in 1863, following the ascent of the Monviso in the same year, with the intention of imitating similar organisations that already existed in other European countries. Its activities involved both tourist trekking and sports mountaineering, with the opening of new routes and the construction of a dense network of refuges. While holidays at the seaside were limited to health treatments, those in the mountains multiplied: all activities which, until the First World War, were reserved for a very limited and wealthy section of the population, but which by the 1920s were already attracting a much wider audience.\n\nFROM PLAY TO SPORT\n\nGames and agonism have ancient origins, but it was not until the Industrial Revolution that sport took on a modern character, establishing itself in Victorian England and spreading first inside and then outside the British Empire. For the first time, sport displayed characteristics such as secularism, equality of opportunity and conditions, specialisation, rationalisation, bureaucratisation, quantification of performance and, above all, the concept of the record. It was horse-racing that led the way until the ‘Games’ arrived in Italy at the end of the 19th century: although they achieved rapid success, they needed national founding myths to legitimise them. Legends immediately sprang up claiming a direct link between football and Florentine football, or tracing the birth of golf to Roman legionnaires and basketball to the Italian Middle Ages.\n\nFROM THE BATTLEFIELD TO THE PITCH\n\nIn the newly unified Italy, the sporting experience was borrowed from the habits of the Piedmontese elite, linked to military life and the education of the aristocracy, such as hunting, fencing, target shooting or horse riding. Soon the idea spread that these disciplines could contribute to ‘making Italians’ and thus began a commitment by the new state to their dissemination in the rest of the peninsula. In the ‘Spring of Shooting’, Garibaldi himself travelled around Italy to promote their practice and in 1861 the National Shooting Society was founded. The various regional fencing schools were ‘nationalised’ in 1883, thanks to the Neapolitan master Masaniello Parise, who standardised teaching methods, while the Italian Fencing Federation was only founded in 1909. In horsemanship, Federico Caprilli was the protagonist of a real revolution that would lead to the birth of modern horsemanship, through the invention of a method to make the rider’s movement more coherent with the horse, leaning forward and improving the effectiveness and the safety of jumping.\n\n‘GYMNASTICS’\n\nGymnastics can be considered the discipline par excellence in liberal Italy, given the large number of practitioners. After an initial diffidence, the public authorities attributed civic and civil significance to it and gave it widespread support. In March 1844, the Swiss instructor Rodolfo Obermann, together with the former officer Count Ernesto Ricardi di Netro, Doctor Luigi Balestra and other illustrious Turin personalities founded the Turin Gymnastics Society for educational purposes. From that moment until 1869, when the Gymnastics Federation was founded, Turin became the driving force behind gymnastics, first in the Kingdom of Piedmont and then in Italy. After the Unification, courses were also organised to train the first physical education teachers of the new kingdom.\n\nTHE MYTH OF SPEED\n\nThe automobile immediately fascinated the Italians. In 1895, Michele Lanza from Piedmont built the first Italian car and in 1900 the Motor Show was inaugurated in Turin. Speed calls for competition and the first races were immediately born: in France in 1894 with cars reaching the ‘crazy’ speed of 22km/H, in Italy in 1895 with the Turin-Asti and in 1901 with the first Giro d’Italia featuring automobiles, promoted by the newspaper ‘Corriere della Sera’. In 1906, the first Targa Florio was held, organised by the naval entrepreneur of the same name, but the most famous was the Mille Miglia, which was run from 1927 to 1957, when, after an accident involving the public crowded along the roadside, racing on public roads was banned. A myth was generated around the drivers: of recklessness and disregard for danger, one example being Tazio Nuvolari, the son of farmers, who won the podium in all the races he ran from 1920 to 1948 and set three international speed records.\n\nA SILENT HUMAN-POWERED MACHINE\n\nBetween 1900 and 1920, Italian factories produced countless bicycles. Immediately the first races were born: on iron vehicles and with low-resistance tyres, groups of riders challenged the elements and the limits of their bodies. In 1909, the newspaper ‘La Gazzetta dello Sport’ organised the first Giro d’Italia. On very long routes, cyclists get lost, stop, get rides, taking up to 12 hours per stage and are often given up for lost: they are tests of endurance rather than speed. At the turn of the century, velodrome races were still very popular, with duels such as the one between cyclist Romolo Buni and Buffalo Bill, the famous American cowboy, at the Trotter velodrome in Milan in 1894. During the First World War, 12 battalions of cyclists are deployed at the front: Carlo Oriani, winner of the 1931 Giro, dies of pneumonia after swimming across the Piave; Ottavio Bottecchia, later winner of the Tour de France saves several machine guns from the Austrians by cycling over the Izoard Pass. But none are as famous as Enrico Toti, a lone, one-legged pedaller, who lost his life in 1916.\n\nFOOTBALL (THE ORIGINAL ONE)\n\nThe game of football – quite different from the English game that later took the same name – had already acquired a national character even before the political unification of the country. In 1863, the American intellectual William Story had described it as ‘the Italian national game, like cricket for the English’, and Goethe in his 1816 ‘Italian Journey’, referred to it as ‘the classic game of the Italians’. The ball game, with its Renaissance origins (Messer Scaino’s essay on the ball game dates from 1555), had become popular by the end of the 17th century, attracting a large public. In the early 19th century, it competed in popularity with melodrama and opera. It was played close to the city walls or in the ‘sferisteri’, sports hall built thanks to funding from the municipalities. Its champions, such as Carlo Didimi, are celebrated by poets and writers, such as Giacomo Leopardi, Gioacchino Belli and Edmondo De Amicis.\n\nTHE 1911 WORLD’S FAIR\n\nThe 1911 Exhibition of Industry and Labour in Turin, designed to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Unification of Italy and the country’s achievements to date, was also the first major showcase for the Italian sports industry, reflecting the interest and growth that the sector had already experienced. An entire pavilion of the exhibition was dedicated to sports industries in several categories: Gymnastics, Running, Athletics, Fencing and Games, Shooting and Volleyball, Rowing, Sailing and Swimming, Mountaineering, Horse Racing and Racing, Motor Sport, Motorcycling and Motorboating, Cycling and Tourism. Added to this was the Alpine Club pavilion. The mountaineering industries as well as the automobile and motorbike industries played a prominent role, the latter including Alfa, Isotta Fraschini, Fiat, Lancia and Bianchi.\n\nA WAR THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING\n\nThe First World War was an authentic watershed for Italian sport. Although the entry into the war in 1915 had caused the interruption of all major national competitions, the conflict helped to increase the popularity of the sport in rural Italy. In fact, life in the trenches reduced the distance between the cities, where sport had been increasingly popular for a few years, and the countryside, where it was still virtually unknown. Sports tournaments were organised in the rear to keep troop morale high, and the presence of the British and American armies as allies on the battlefield helped to spread new practices. The end of the conflict saw an exponential growth in sporting activity across the peninsula.\n\nFASCISM AND THE ‘NEW MAN’\n\nFascism entailed a change of pace for Italian sport, due to the political role assigned to it by the ideology of the ‘New Man’, a concept explained by Mussolini himself in a 1932 interview: ‘We are for the collective meaning of life, and this we want to strengthen, at the cost of individual lives. With this we do not want to turn men into figures, but we consider them above all in their function in the State’. To reinforce the concept, Lando Ferretti, director of ‘Sport Fascista’ and president of CONI between 1925 and 1928, wrote: ‘citizen equals soldier […] and soldier in all its extension of the term: in the firm and tempered body, in the spirit ready for the supreme sacrifice, in the technical preparation always up to date, in an atmosphere of discipline that makes enthusiasm the decisive weapon of all victories’.\n\nTHE GIRO OF REBIRTH\n\nAfter the Second World War, the Giro d’Italia resumed as early as 1946, unlike the Tour de France, which had to wait until 1947 to resume. To do so on roads still scarred by war and bombing, in a country in the midst of reconstruction, was a considerable undertaking, and so it was renamed the “Giro of Rebirth”. The organisers, with the explicit intention of asserting their Italian identity, managed to obtain permission from the Allied authorities to run the Giro through Trieste.\n\nMIRACLE!\n\n1963 saw the end of the ‘economic miracle’, an expansive period following the Second World War that radically changed the face of Italy. In just a few years, Italy went from being a rural economy to being the world’s seventh industrial power. Italians left the countryside and moved to the big cities to find work in the factories; despite the hard work on the assembly line, the certainty of a salary at the end of the month completely changed their lifestyle. Italians begin to buy houses and electrical appliances on instalments, discover motorbikes and utility vehicles, leisure, holidays, mass consumption, sport. The middle class was born, able for the first time to spend their salaries on luxuries and activities not related to mere survival.\n\nRITES, MIRACLES AND MYTHS\n\nThe post-war period is the era of Fausto Coppi, Gino Bartali and Fiorenzo Magni. Italians are united in their support for cycling, but they are divided in their support for the champions, in a sporting, personal, political and regional rivalry: north against centre, secular against Catholic, Communists against Christian Democrats. Coppi seems immortal in the saddle, but he has a fragile physique. Son of peasants, protagonist of the pink news; prisoner in Africa, he returned home by bike across the wartime peninsula. Winner of five Giri, two Tours, world champion in 1953, he died of malaria in 1960. Bartali survives him by half a century. A devout Catholic, during the years of fascism he dedicated his victories to the Pope and Our Lady. During the occupation he saved many Jews from deportation. He drinks, he smokes, but he looks like iron. Legend has it that his victory in the Tour in July 1948 prevented an insurrection. In 1952, on a mountain stage of the Tour, the two of them pass each other a water bottle. It is the most famous sprint in Italian cycling.\n\nDEMOCRATIC SPORT FOR ALL\n\nIf in the last years of Fascism, the control of young people’s leisure time was entrusted to top-down mass organisations, after the fall of Fascism it was the newly formed political parties that invested in sport. A series of subsidiary sports organisations emerged with which the Italian political subcultures democratically sought to win the hearts and minds of young Italians. In 1944, Catholic Action founded the Centro Sportivo Italiano. Also of Catholic origin were the Libertas Sports Centre and the Unione Sportiva ACLI. On the left, on the other hand, the most important organisation was the Unione Italiana Sport Popolare (UISP), but almost every party had those that were recognised by CONI in 1967 as bodies promoting sport.\n\nFROM FARMERS TO EMPLOYEES\n\nSince the 1970s, Italy has been living immersed in the fourth industrial revolution, the IT revolution. The shift of labour from agriculture to industry and services is still going on. If in 1900 66% of income went on food, today 80% of our economic availability is used for ‘accessory goods’, i.e. goods not related to the need for food and shelter. 70% of the population live in cities and in many cases reach levels of higher education that were unthinkable only a century ago.\n\n‘HEALTHIER AND MORE BEAUTIFUL’\n\nFitness and wellness are two words that have entered the Italian vernacular, hand in hand with the spread of aerobic exercises or variable resistance machines “for everyone”, no longer limited to bodybuilders. Born in the United States in the 1950s, these activities reached their peak thirty years later and arrived in our country. The idea of going to the gym to improve physical fitness and general wellbeing took root. In 1984, the Italian company Technogym launched its first complete range of equipment and five years later the first edition of the country’s most famous fitness fair was held in Rimini. Since then, the sector has expanded with the most varied formulas: step, Zumba, spinning, fit-boxing, yoga-fit, Pilates, up to CrossFit, TRX, HIIT training…\n\nMORE AND MORE SPORTSMEN\n\nHand in hand with the great changes that have affected all spheres of Italian life, the number of Italians practising sport on a regular basis has also increased rapidly and significantly since the middle of the 20th century: if we look at the first 20 years of the 21st century alone, the percentage of inactive people has fallen by 7 percentage points.\n\nPercentage of people aged 6+ who participate in sport on a regular basis:\n\n1959 2,6\n\n1982 15,4\n\n1988 22,9\n\n1995 18,0\n\n2001 19,2\n\n2005 21,1\n\n2011 22,0\n\n2015 23,8\n\n2022 26,3\n\nSPORT IN TIMES OF PANDEMIC\n\nIn March 2020, Italy and the world discover their vulnerability: the Covid-19 pandemic emergency breaks out. Millions of people are forced to change their lifestyle and face the fear of illness and death. Many must discontinue their workouts; others, with increased free time due to the cessation of work and economic activities, are discovering physical activity, also thanks to the availability of classes via multiple streaming platforms. In the year of the pandemic, the number of card-carrying members and members of organised sports clubs fell drastically, but this was offset by an increase in the number of people taking part in leisure and outdoor sports. By the end of 2020, the number of people who practise sport continuously had already reached an all-time high (+05 percentage points compared with 2019, +8 compared with 2001).\n\n1 in 3 Italians changed their sport during the pandemic.\n\n53% of adults continued the same sport in different ways.\n\n66% of Italians exercised during Covid: 34% outdoors, 18% at home with video lessons, 17% at home alone.\n\n2 out of 3 ‘lazy people’ started some kind of physical activity during Covid.\n\nThe number of visits to diet or fitness websites or apps increased in 2020 by 69% in France, 20% in Germany, 31% in Spain, 23% in the UK and 133% in Italy.\n\nOut of 2.3 billion Facebook users worldwide, 700 million people follow sports pages.\n\nWITH YOUR HEAD IN THE BALLOON\n\nFootball tops the list of Italian sporting passions. But what other sports are played by adults in our country? And has it always been like this?\n\n% of practitioners in the various disciplines\n\n1993\n\nFootball/Football 50.0\n\nVolleyball 47.2\n\nBasketball 56.3\n\nSwimming/Diving 24.3\n\nTennis 17.7\n\nAthletics 48.3\n\nCycling 16.3\n\nMartial Arts 55.8\n\nAlpine skiing 7.6\n\nMountain biking 3.9\n\n2023\n\nFootball 34%\n\nSwimming 29%\n\nCycling 26%\n\nTennis 20%\n\nSkiing 16%\n\nVolleyball 14%\n\nBasketball 13%\n\nAthletics (including running) 10%.\n\nMotor sports 4%\n\nRugby 3%\n\n25% of people who exercise regularly without being CONI members do some form of gymnastics, such as aerobics, fitness or bodybuilding.\n\nMAD TO RUN\n\nSince the early 2000s, the proportion of Italians who run at least once a month has risen continuously: 59%. The use of smartphones for running enthusiasts and apps designed for physical activities has increased the desire to run in 52% of cases. Italians run to feel good (41%) more than to lose weight (27%), and those who run imagine that they will run more in the future. 22% of occasional runners say that if they had more time, they would participate in races, aiming for competitive or semi-competitive running (12% already do this).\n\nTHE MIRAGE OF SHAPE\n\nIt seems that only 1 in 5 Italians consider themselves satisfied with their physical fitness and ready to tackle the famous ‘swimsuit test’. On top of this, more than 1 in 2 Italians spend many hours at work. As a natural consequence, achieving visible results in a short time has become a necessity. Thus, in 2015, a start-up was born in Italy that launched the format of a high-intensity sports practice with the use of machines that promise to maintain a good state of health in 20 minutes a week. A format that has seen exponential growth in the last 7 years, with a rate of opening new centres of +62.3% per year.\n\nFOR SPORT OR FASHION?\n\nHow many sports have entered our habits as trends? How many have remained as enduring practices? Who does not remember the era of squash, windsurfing or water-skiing? The era of roller skates and inline skates? Who hasn’t wondered in recent years if it wasn’t time to play padel or try aerial yoga or pole dancing? A few decades ago, snowboarding did not exist and is now all the rage; conversely, bowling was a very popular sport. Many sports have been invented and then abandoned: rollerblading, horse racing on frozen lakes or snowy fields, airplane racing on wheels or underwater obstacle racing.\n\nFOR SPORT OR JUST TO BE THERE\n\nAround 4,500 people take part in the Marcialonga, the most important amateur cross-country skiing event, and 12,000 in a cycling rally such as the Nove Colli di Cesenatico. An average of 10,000 people take part each year in the various stages of the Deejay Ten, the amateur race organised by the radio station of the same name, and in 2024 40,000 people ran in the 40th anniversary edition of Vivicittà, the first of the running events organised in our country. Participation, taking part in an event that is perceived as relevant and feeling part of a community that shares values and passions seems to be the focus of these experiences, in addition to the sporting activity itself. From the Pink Run to the Race for the Cure, from the Corsa di Miguel to the Smile Run, from the Crossfit Woda Charity Tour to the Race for Life, there is something for every sport and every cause.\n\nA GENERATOR OF ECONOMIC GROWTH\n\nSport is also a major generator of economic opportunities. Gyms, sports facilities, teaching, participation in and organisation of competitions and championships, rights, merchandising, but also tourism and the entire clothing and equipment industry: these are just some of the fields of influence of the sports economy. The tourism sector, in particular, has seen huge growth: per capita spending by sports tourists is set to increase by 9% between 2019 and 2023, thanks to the increase in activities undertaken during the trip as a result of the desire to take part in or follow a sports event, with peaks of +27% for visits to exhibitions, museums, etc., despite the increase in costs due to inflation. Finally, according to some studies, every euro invested in sport has generated 3 in social benefits: sport is a multiplier in our national system.\n\nThe Economics of Sport, 2023\n\n1.3% of GDP\n\nEUR 22 billion\n\n400,000 employees\n\n15,000 companies\n\n82,000 non-profit organisations\n\nTHE PRIDE OF MADE IN ITALY\n\n‘Made in Italy’ is the expression that stands for the excellence of Italian savoir-faire, which combines innovation, perfection, design, high quality raw materials, creativity and ingenuity, and is widely used in the clothing and sports equipment sectors. There are many brands that have made history, introducing new shapes, new materials, new technologies that have given rise to fashions and paradigm shifts. Every Italian has a special emotional attachment to some of them, and the list could go on and on. There are over 750 Italian companies involved in production and distribution in this sector, employing 30,000 people. Seventy per cent of production is destined for foreign markets, which shows how highly our “know-how” is valued.\n\n——————————————\n\nWomen\n\nThe 20th century was the century of women. They entered the public arena as protagonists in all fields, politics, culture, science and even sport. A long and bumpy road, which still sees them struggle to achieve equality in many areas, but which has seen them as pioneers, precursors and genuine heroines, also and above all in sport.\n\nThis section recounts an obstacle race against prejudices, commonplaces and widespread hostility and the constant attempt to relegate women to ‘girly’ disciplines and defined aesthetic canons. Finally, this section opens up the question of sport beyond gender and the role of sport in the integration of women from different cultures: two of the challenges facing our country.\n\nNOT ONLY MOTHERS AND WIVES\n\nIn the many facets of peasant society, women had a far from marginal role. It was the eldest woman in a family group who organised everyone’s finances and decided the roles of the other members, and it was women who managed relations with other families. Women therefore played a fundamental role in the economy of the family for the wellbeing of all, far removed from the ‘angel of the hearth’ model that would be imposed with the rise of the bourgeoisie and later the middle class.\n\nLOVE AND GYMNASTICS\n\nBetween May and June 1891, the short story ‘Amore e ginnastica’ (Love and gymnastics) by Edmondo de Amicis – best known as the author of the book ‘Cuore’ (Heart), a staple of every Italian child’s school career – was published in the magazine ‘Nuova Antologia’. The protagonist of the story is Signorina Pedani, a passionate gymnastics teacher, strict and disciplined, but also a symbol of female emancipation, modernity and progress. The construction of the character is significant because it tells us about a context in which there was growing attention to physical health and gymnastics, as part of a wider movement to improve public health.\n\nTHE CONTRADICTIONS OF THE REGIME\n\nThe great diffusion of American motion pictures in the cinemas of our country imposed the aesthetic models of actresses such as Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich or Jean Harlow, fostering, in the collective imagination of many Italians, the diffusion of a prototype of female beauty that harmonised with American canons rather than with those recalled by the rhetoric of the regime. From 1931, Fascism organised a campaign against Hollywood female stereotypes: the skinny and masculine ‘crisis woman’, the product of overseas film fantasy, was countered by the ‘authentic woman’, defined as ‘well nourished’. And yet the fascist sportswoman resembles the very American stereotypes that the regime wanted to combat.\n\nGYMNASTICS FOR NEW ITALIANS\n\nDuring the Fascist period, women were among the main figures in the reorganisation of physical education for young people desired by the regime, and in 1932 the Accademia Femminile di Orvieto was founded to train future teachers. The most famous of these was the commander of the academy itself, Elisa Lombardi from Cuneo. Paradoxically, despite the regime’s rhetoric on the role of women, profound elements of modernity were introduced. The bodies of the would-be teachers were not those of the ‘matron’ but were more akin to American athletes and actresses; while the wearing of shorts above the knee was something unprecedented for the time, as it contradicted the public morality that envisaged ankle-length trousers and skirts.\n\nPAVIA’S LITTLE GYMNASTS\n\nIn 1928 women’s athletics and gymnastics were included in the Olympic Games. And it was in gymnastics that Italy won its first medal, thanks to a team made up entirely of gymnasts from Pavia: Clara Marangoni, Lavinia Gianoni, Bianca Ambrosetti, Virginia Giorgi, Germana Malabarba, Luigina Perversi, Diana Pizzavini, Anna Tanzini, Carolina Tronconi, Ines Vercesi, Rita Vittadini and Luigina Giavotti. The Italian gymnasts won a prestigious silver medal behind the Dutch team, only to be excluded from the delegation to the 1932 Los Angeles Games on the grounds that they would have inevitably engaged in promiscuous behaviour with their male colleagues on the journey by boat.\n\nTHE GRACE OLYMPICS\n\nThe first major international women’s athletics event in Italy was held in Florence in the spring of 1931, with the evocative name of the ‘ Olympics of Grace ‘. On the stage of the Giglio Rosso track, the strongest female athletes of the time from no less than eleven nations competed: Austria, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, France, Germany, England, Yugoslavia, Poland, Romania, Hungary and, of course, Italy.\n\nFEMINISM\n\nBetween the end of the 1960s and the 1970s, the world of women changed dramatically. On the one hand, the economic crisis necessitated a second income; on the other hand, migration and the transition of many women to the middle class led them to confront more dynamic social realities and to study longer. In this context, feminist movements were born, hand in hand with those of workers and students. The struggles that lead to the reform of family law, economic emancipation and divorce emphasise the fight for women’s autonomy. Although the link between political feminism and sporting feminism is not direct and the right to practise sport is not part of the panorama of feminist movements’ claims, the practice of sport itself has an emancipatory character and female athletes also begin to claim equal opportunities, reflecting the spirit of the times.\n\n‘THE BODY IS MINE AND I DECIDE’\n\nThe history of women’s sport has also accompanied and determined the changes involving women’s bodies and their use in public debate. In fact, the twentieth century saw the emergence of a physicality to be used and displayed according to norms that were less and less influenced by moral judgements. The bodies of working women, as well as those of sportswomen, with their need for movement and practicality have led to the questioning of the very meaning of many taboos. Women are discovering that they are masters of their own bodies.\n\nTOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE: WOMEN’S SPORTSWEAR\n\nThe evolution of women’s sportswear reflects profound cultural and social changes, developing as the practice of sport conquers more significant segments of the population. Originally, women played sports in long, opaque dresses. The transition to more functional clothing began in the late 19th century, when women shed their corsets and ‘bloomers’ were introduced, later joined by the jumpsuit invented by futurist Ernesto Hayat. In the 1930s and 1940s, sports fashion introduced short trousers and skirts above the knee, and even reduced the fabric of swimming costumes, but only and strictly in the context of competitions. In 1932, the athletics federation declared that “under no circumstances may athletes go beyond the fence of the sports ground without wearing long trousers”, and the basketball federation added that “all athletes must play in regulation skirts”. Many Italian designers have ventured into fashion for sport, from the Fontana sisters to Emilio Pucci to Gianfranco Ferré, from Pierre Cardin to Giorgio Armani, and many Italian companies have produced great innovations in women’s technical clothing. The process of uncovering the body has grown to the point of generating problems on the opposite side: in the last Olympic editions of beach volleyball and artistic gymnastics, extremely skimpy outfits have provoked debates on their appropriateness and functionality and the refusal of female athletes to use them. Who gets to decide how women should dress?\n\nA QUESTION OF TIME (AND POWER)\n\n‘Without women working and without women doing sport the country does not grow, or at least grows less than it could’: this is the clear conclusion of the CENSIS Report on Women, Work and Sport in Italy (2024).\n\n8.5 million Italians women practice sport\n\n9 million Italians women engage in at least some form of physical activity.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2021, the difference in sports participation between men and women was reduced by almost 30%.\n\nHEROINES AND CHAMPIONS\n\nThere are many women who have marked the history of Italian sport, but some, more than others, have set records or paved the way for other girls to enter the collective imagination in sports previously considered unsuitable for women.\n\nA CENTURY-LONG JOURNEY\n\nThe Olympics have been slow to include women in their competitions. It was only during the 2024 edition in Paris that a 50-50 split in gender representation was achieved.\n\nChronology of Olympic disciplines open to women:\n\n1900 First Olympic Games open to women, with 22 athletes, 2% of all competitors.\n\nGolf and tennis were the only disciplines with exclusively female competitions\n\n1908 Archery, Pairs Figure Skating\n\n1912 Swimming\n\n1924 1924 Figure Skating and Fencing1928 Athletics\n\n1948 Downhill and slalom, shot put\n\n1984 Women’s marathon, 20km cross-country skiing and cycling\n\n1988 Table tennis\n\n1992 Judo\n\n2012 Boxing\n\n2000 Pole Vault and Hammer Throw\n\n2020 Beijing Olympics 48% of participants are female athletes\n\n2024 Paris Olympics gender equality target\n\nGIRLS’ SPORTS?\n\nIn common parlance, we often hear gender stereotyping in relation to sport: there are disciplines that are more suited to men and those that are more ‘feminine’ (by which we often mean choreographed activities or those that are more associated with an idea of elegance in movement). In fact, there is ample evidence that these are cultural and linguistic stereotypes, and that people of different genders can excel without limit in all disciplines.\n\nWomen > 3 years old practising some physical activity by type of sport\n\nGymnastics, aerobics, fitness 39.5%\n\nWater sports 29.9%\n\nDance and dancing 13.5%\n\nAthletics, jogging, jogging 10.8%\n\nVolleyball 8%\n\nMartial arts and combat sports 2.10\n\nFootball and five-a-side football 1.5%\n\nBasketball 1.4%\n\nBASKETBALL: A SPORT FOR LADIES?\n\n‘Pallacanestro’ – the Italian translation of American basketball – arrived in Italy as a ‘sport for young ladies’. In fact, it was Ida Nomi Venerosi Pesciolini who, in 1907, translated James Naishmith’s basketball manual into Italian for the first time and demonstrated the game with two teams of girls from the Mens Sana gymnastics club in Siena. This intuition was the first step towards spreading throughout Italy what was presented in a pamphlet written by the Maestra as the ‘Basket-ball, giuoco ginnastico per giovinette’ (Basket-ball, gymnastic game for young girls).\n\nVOLLEYBALL: A SPORT FOR BOYS?\n\nUntil the 1980s, volleyball in Italy was a predominantly male affair. In 1978 there were more players than female members, but a decade later, the latter had surpassed the former, making Fipav the federation of a team sport with the most women in its ranks. The general increase in women’s participation in sport in the 1980s and the fact that some schoolgirls chose volleyball as their sport at school contributed to this. However, it was also a matter of imagination that determined this boom, produced by the airing of two famous Japanese cartoons: ‘Mimì and the Volleyball Girls’, broadcast in Italy in 1982, and ‘Mila and Shiro: Two Hearts in Volleyball’, in 1986. It would then be the girls of that generation who would give women’s volleyball its first world laurel in 2002.\n\nFOOTBALL: A SPORT FOR EVERYONE!\n\nThe difficult parabola of women’s football began in 1933, with the creation of the women’s football group in Milan, ‘supported’ by the then CONI president Leandro Arpinati. This experience was short-lived due to the difficulty of organising matches and because of the aversion of the secretary of the National Fascist Party, Achille Starace, who, after having assumed the leadership of CONI, decided to ban women’s football in public spaces. The regime, in fact, supported by the Catholic Church, considered football inappropriate for women and risky for motherhood. With the end of fascism and the beginning of the republican era, the situation did not improve because of the opposition of the Football League, which urged clubs not to allow women to play on their pitches. This attitude was supported by the irony and stigma of the media and by the Ministry of the Interior, which in 1959 asked prefects and quaestors not to allow women to play on municipal pitches. It was not until 1968, after a fierce battle with CONI that went as far as the courts, that the first national women’s championships were held. Finally in 1974, a tournament was organised under the aegis of the Federazione Femminile Italiana Unificata Giuoco Calcio. The latter lost its autonomy in 1986 when it became part of the Federazione Italiana Gioco Calcio (Italian Football Federation), which made it part of the National Amateur League. It is only from the 2022/2023 season that the women’s game will become fully professional.\n\nPIONEER: THE FIRST TIME\n\nMARIA ANTONIETTA\n\nIt was 1922 when a woman, the Countess Maria Antonietta Avanzo, appeared behind the wheel of her Alfa Romeo at the starting grid of the Targa Florio: she was the only woman. That year, however, she was in a team with Enzo Ferrari, giving Nuvolari a run for his money. She boasted that she had learned to drive by herself, stealing her father’s car, and it was her husband who gave her her first sports car to celebrate the end of the First World War, with which she took part in the Giro del Lazio.\n\nALFONSINA\n\nAnother woman with a passion for wheels was Alfonsina Strada, from Alfonsine, Ravenna. Born into a peasant family, she developed a passion for cycling and started taking part in all the local races, earning the nickname ‘the devil in a skirt’. In 1924 she caused a scandal by becoming the first woman to take part in the Giro d’Italia. She finished second in the third stage and was disqualified from the fourth stage for not finishing in time, but finished the whole Giro. In 1938, at Longchamp, she won the women’s hour record (35.28 km). It was not until the 1950s that she gave up cycling to take up motorcycling. She died in a motorcycle accident in 1959.\n\nONDINA\n\nIn 1936, in a Berlin wallpapered with swastikas, it was the hurdler Ondina Valla who broke records, winning gold in the 80-metre hurdles, Italy’s first Olympic gold medal. Excluded from the 1932 Olympics because the Church objected to the idea of a 16-year-old girl travelling alone in an all-male expedition, she was immediately included in Fascist propaganda as a symbol of her achievements. Valla also holds another record: she is the first for the number of streets that have been dedicated to women’s sport.\n\nCLEMENTINE\n\nA singular case in point is the life of Clementine Brida, the daughter of Italian immigrants in the United States, who started playing baseball as early as 1897, creating a true story of female emancipation through sport. She went on to become the owner of a traveling women’s baseball team that included another Italian, Margaret Gisolo, who was even allowed to play on a men’s team in the 1920s.\n\nMIRANDA\n\nIn 1952, the cross-country skier Fides Romanin was the first Italian woman flag-bearer at the opening ceremony of an Olympic Games, the Winter Olympics in Oslo. That same year, at the Melbourne Summer Games, Forlì gymnast Miranda Cicognani carried the Olympic flag. The first woman ever to read the Olympic oath was also an Italian: the skier Giuliana Minuzzo at the 1956 Winter Games in Cortina d’Ampezzo.\n\nWOMEN ON BIKES\n\nAs was the case a hundred years ago, the practice of sport can be a gateway to women’s emancipation, enabling them to overcome cultural barriers that still preclude them from cycling, for example. Many municipalities in Emilia Romagna have promoted courses to teach immigrant girls how to ride a bicycle, and many Italian NGOs are engaged in development cooperation programmes that are based precisely on promoting cycling among girls. In 2023, a girl from Rwanda was also the first African woman to race the Giro d’Italia: Violette Irakoze Neza of the Africa Rising team. Rwanda will host the World Road Cycling Championships in September 2025.\n\nCHALLENGES\n\nFeminist movements laid the groundwork for the discussion of many stereotypes related to gender identity issues, influencing subsequent LGBTQIA+ movements. Sport has been a field of action for women’s and LGBTQIA+ rights and female athletes have challenged gender prejudices, paving the way for greater inclusion. Today, the theme extends from claiming the right to respect for sexual orientation to gender identity. In 2003, the IOC adopted a policy allowing transgender athletes to participate in sports competitions.\n\n——————————————\n\nTravel\n\nThe 20th century was the century of great mass migrations. Italy has been at the centre of immense movements of people who have left, moved within and arrived in our country from the most diverse places in the world. Today, Italy faces new challenges, linked to the existence of vast communities of Italians abroad for multiple generations, and to the rootedness of communities of different origins in Italy, also of two or three generations.\n\nSport has been deeply affected by these movements: many of the disciplines practised in Italy today have come from abroad, just as abroad our country is known for its sporting passion and great champions.\n\nThis section tells the story of how Italians have taken their sporting passion abroad, and how sport can be a driving force for a more inclusive society in our country.\n\nA CROSSROADS OF PEOPLES\n\nIn almost every Italian family there is at least one relative who has gone or lives abroad and almost everyone knows someone who has come to Italy to change their life. Our peninsula has always been a land of arrivals and departures. In the 20th century, migratory flows amplified, becoming a mass phenomenon. Today there are 5.3 million foreign citizens in our country, 9.5% of the total population, and there are 6 million Italians abroad.\n\nTHE BEGINNINGS OF ITALIAN SPORTS ABROAD\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Italian emigrants also brought with them the games they played in their homeland, such as the ball, for which they built a “sferisterio” – as the halls where it was played were called – in San Francisco, capable of holding thousands of spectators. They brought the ‘ruzzola’ and the ‘lippa’, which were played in the streets with wooden cylinders. Italian miners, farmers and carpenters were also early to distinguish themselves for their physical strength and athletic ability. In the United States, for example, the Italian Lawrence Brignola won the second edition of the Boston Marathon in 1899. The American tour of Dorando Pietri, ‘moral winner’ of the London Olympics marathon, which attracted over 20,000 spectators in the New York leg, was a great success with the public.\n\nA PEOPLE OF FIGHTERS\n\nThe Italian Boxing Federation was founded in 1916, but its greatest competitive success and fame came during the Fascist period and the economic boom. For Mussolini, boxing was ‘an exquisitely fascist means of expression’ and Italians were supposed to be a ‘people of fighters’: strong, bold and resistant. The ultimate emblem of the instrumentalization of the sport is Primo Carnera. The mastodontic Friulian, who emigrated first to France and then to the United States, fought 113 fights, winning 85 of them. Another myth of Fascist boxing is Michele Bonaglia, winner of the middleweight against the champion of the still democratic Weimar Germany in 1929: first a squadronist and then a republican, he died in a partisan ambush in 1944. A victim of the regime is instead Leone Efrati, of Jewish religion, among the top ten featherweights of the 1930s. After the racial laws, he was deported to Auschwitz, where the Germans kept him fighting until his death in 1944.\n\nEXPORTING SAMPLES\n\nEven in recent times, our country has been ‘exporting’ champions and talents all over the world. In football, one of the first was Giorgio Chinaglia, who, after playing for Lazio from 1976 to 1983, wore the jersey of the New York Cosmos. In the mid-1990s, several Italians chose the Premier League: among them Gianluca Vialli and Gianfranco Zola, wearing the Chelsea shirt. Vialli even coached and played for the London team. But we can also remember the experiences of Paolo Di Canio, Fabrizio Ravanelli, Pierluigi Casiraghi and Roberto Di Matteo. Of the players who played in the Spanish league, Christian Vieri was the most fortunate with Atletico Madrid. Following the World Cup in Germany and the Calciopoli scandal, several players left Juventus, including Gianluca Zambrotta and Fabio Cannavaro, the former to Barcelona and the latter to Real Madrid. In other sports, basketball players such as Andrea Bargnani, Marco Belinelli and Danilo Gallinari have left for the NBA. In women’s volleyball, the most famous players to have crossed the border are Maurizia Cacciatori, Francesca Piccinini, Eleonora Lo Bianco and, today, Paola Egonu. The former played in one Brazilian championship, while the latter played five seasons in Turkey, where she also spent a season.\n\n‘I AM ITALIAN, SO WHAT?’\n\nSport, like cooking, has been a powerful factor for integration among those living far from the motherland. Gathering to cheer on one’s team or the national team, celebrating all together the victories of one’s favourites, gives emigrants a strong sense of identity and cements the sense of belonging to supportive communities, making them feel less alone and claiming an identity that they often try to camouflage in order to integrate into the society of arrival. “I am Italian, so what?” This is the famous phrase with which Nino Manfredi justifies his cheering for the Italian national team in the 1974 film ‘Pane e Cioccolata’ (Bread and Chocolate), in which he plays an emigrant in Switzerland who tries to hide his identity until his faith in football betrays him in a public place.\n\nCRICKET\n\nAlthough cricket was one of the first English sports to arrive in the Italian peninsula – suffice it to say that Genoa football was born in 1893 as the Genoa Cricket and Athletic Club – the game never found much fertile ground in Italy and soon fell out of favour. Today, the presence of citizens from India, Bangladesh and Pakistan – all territories that were part of the former British Empire and where the influence of the British has taken such deep root that cricket has become the national sport – have brought it back into vogue, organising real leagues in the cities where they live, uniting people from countries at war with each other and overcoming conflict through sport. In 2021, the magical year of Italian sport, our national team made headlines by beating England in the European Cricket Championship. Our national team was captained by Baljit Singh and coached by Kamal Kariyawasam Indipolage.\n\nREADY TO LEARN\n\nIn sport, our country has long been a landing place for great football champions, but since the early 2000s it has become increasingly difficult for clubs to attract foreign champions. In addition to the players, great coaches arrived, including the Argentine Helenio Herrera and the Hungarians Ernó Egri Erbstein and Árpád Weisz, the latter two linked by a tragic death. The former died in the Superga tragedy in 1949, while the latter was murdered in the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944 because he was Jewish. The arrival of foreign coaches and players had a profound impact on the game. Several NBA champions participated in the basketball league from the 1980s and some coaches modernised the playing techniques of several national teams, such as Ratko Rudić for the water polo sevens or Julio Velasco who took the Azzurri volleyball team to the roofs of Europe and the world. The Americans Doug Beal, one of the most important innovators in the world of volleyball, and Dan Peterson in basketball, who also helped many inhabitants of the ‘Bel Paese’ to understand North American sport with his television reports, will never be forgotten.\n\nSECOND GENERATIONS ABROAD\n\nSport became an opportunity for socialising and an instrument of integration, as was the case with many Italian-American boxers and baseball players who, thanks to their athletic prowess, became household names in the American imagination, including Rocky Marciano and Joe Di Maggio, but also Aldo Spoldi ‘Kid Dynamite’. Italian sports clubs sprang up almost everywhere, such as the Gloria Club in Paris, Boca Junior in Argentina and Palestra Italia, the future Palmeiras, in Brazil, as well as competitions dedicated to emigrants, such as the cycling criterium for Italians living in France.\n\nA PEOPLE OF EXPLORERS AND NAVIGATORS\n\nWhile motorboating and recreational flying are now niche sports, at one time these disciplines appeared pioneering enough to be featured in the great adventure novels. The rhetoric of Fascism, built around the figures of First World War aviators and extolling the exploits of those who had lost their lives in the conflict, such as Francesco Baracca, helped to make flying one of the regime’s icons. Francesco Baracca, who died in 1918 after several victorious battles, had drawn a prancing horse on his biplane, which later became the symbol of the Ferrari car company. The pilots who survived the conflict and contributed to the growth of Italian aviation in the inter-war period were also celebrated. Italo Balbo’s transatlantic flights between Italy and Brazil (1930) and between Italy and Chicago (1933), which was hosting the World’s Fair that year, were among the most celebrated. On the seas, the jewel of the Italian merchant navy, the transatlantic liner Rex, distinguished itself by winning the Nastro Azzurro in 1932, crossing the Atlantic between Europe and New York in 4 days and 13 hours at an average speed of 28.92 knots.\n\nTHE K2\n\nNinety years after the founding of the Club Alpino Italiano, mountaineering in Italy achieved a great success: the conquest of K2, a goal that had been pursued since 1909. The Duke of the Abruzzi, among others, had tried. But in the 1950s, the ideal conditions were created: Italy had just become a republic, the Second World War had recently ended, and the Italians needed a heroic feat to inspire them. Nothing better than to be the first to reach 8000 metres. The feat, supported by De Gasperi himself and organised by the CAI, was achieved in 1954, despite controversy among the members of the expedition.\n\n‘ORIUNDI’ AND NEW ITALIANS\n\nAfter unification, Italy was marked for more than a century by high emigration rates, which led to the establishment of numerous Italian communities abroad. In 1969, for the first time, the migration balance was reversed, and immigrants began to outnumber emigrants, often our compatriots returning. On their return, they brought with them the popular sports of the countries of emigration – rugby, cricket or ice hockey – and the role of the so-called ‘oriundi’ was often decisive in many disciplines. In football, the contribution of South American footballers of Italian origin has been crucial to world championship triumphs: from Monti and Orsi in 1934 to Camoranesi in 2006. In the last thirty years, the presence and success of Italian athletes of foreign origin has grown exponentially. There have been two symbolic moments at the Olympic Games: in 2000, Carlton Myers carried the flag during the athletes’ parade and in 2021, Paola Egonu carried the Olympic flag with the five circles at the Tokyo Games. In football, Sara Gama has captained the national team on 30 occasions.\n\nTHE ‘IUS SPORTIS’?\n\n‘Ius sportis’: this is the name given to the informal recognition of citizenship granted by the world of sport to all those children, born in Italy to parents from other countries who participate in our sporting movement at all levels. In 2016, Italy recognised by law the right of these children and young people to register in sports clubs. At the last European Athletics Championships, a third of our team, which achieved great successes, was made up of second-generation athletes. The Italian Boxing Federation is the first to have introduced into its regulations the right of foreigners under 16 years of age with a residence permit to register as Italians.\n\nPARIS 2024\n\nIn 2015 and with a view to the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, the IOC created the Refugee Team to represent athletes who have not yet obtained citizenship in their country of immigration and who are no longer able to compete for their home Olympic committee for political reasons. In Tokyo, the refugee team included no fewer than 29 athletes (including the Italian shooter Niccolò Campriani). In Paris, there are no less than 36, including two of Iranian origin who are living and training in Italy thanks to the support of CONI: Iman Mahdavi (wrestling) and Hadi Tiranvalipour (taekwondo).\n\n——————————————\n\nIn corpore sano\n\nThe 20th century was the century in which infant mortality was defeated, diseases that used to be fatal were eradicated, millions of people had access to better medical care, healthier places to live and work, and more calories available. All this has significantly increased the life expectancy of Italians, who are now among the longest-living people in the world. Italians have become more aware of the need for a healthy lifestyle and exercise, often thanks to government intervention in physical education and the promotion of sport. This section explores the importance and role of sport in the various age groups and how much it contributes to the overall health of the population, while also reducing the costs of our welfare system.\n\nIt also recounts the various stages of the State’s intervention in the promotion of sport, a commitment that began at the very beginning of our country’s unitary history and that led to the approval, in 2023, of the amendment to Article 33 of our Constitution, which now states that ‘the Republic recognises the educational, social and promotional value of sporting activity in all its forms for psychophysical well-being’, reaffirming the role and importance of the sporting environment in education after the family and school.\n\nA CHILD’S PLAY\n\nEven today, in Italy, young people are the most active in sport, thanks to the role played by schools and public institutions in promoting sport. It is no coincidence that one of the immediate consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on school age and youth was the interruption of sporting practice, which inevitably led to a real tragedy for young people: in 2021, 20% of Italians between the ages of 3 and 17 had to move away from their sport and the whole world of positive social relations that it generates.\n\nSTATE PHYSICAL EDUCATION\n\nSince political and institutional unification, the Italian state has recognised the importance of introducing physical education into the school curriculum in order to improve the fragile health of Italian children and to instil military discipline. The Casati Law of 1859 introduced gymnastics in schools, followed by the De Sanctis Law of 1878. However, the Gentile Reform of 1923, which shaped the Fascist school, did not include physical education in the ordinary school curriculum, delegating it to a special body. In 1946, with the Gonella Law, physical education in the schools of the new Italian Republic was oriented towards the harmonious development of students, eliminating military formalisms and emphasising physical and spiritual preparation. But it was Aldo Moro, Minister of Public Education, who introduced the first post-war organic law on physical education (1958), which reaffirmed its compulsory nature and put it on an equal footing with other subjects.\n\nBALILLA AND GIL\n\nIn 1927 in the context of the construction of the ‘New Man’, the Opera Nazionale Balilla (ONB) was founded, a youth organisation of the regime placed directly under the aegis of Mussolini, which ended up absorbing all pre-existing youth organisations. Complementary to the school, young people between the ages of 6 and 18 were to be trained as citizens/soldiers. In 1937 the Opera Nazionale Balilla was replaced by the Gioventù Italiana del Littorio, one of the cornerstones of the regime. One of the fundamental elements of the education of the Italians of tomorrow was gymnastic and sporting activity, aimed at strengthening the physique and morals of Italian youth. Sport also played a fundamental role in the activities of the Fasci Giovanili di Combattimento and the Fascist university groups, whose representatives competed every year in the Littoriali dello Sport, which was held in its winter and summer versions from 1932 to 1940.\n\nYOUTH GAMES\n\nOne of the most important initiatives in the context of the sportsmanship of Italian schoolchildren were the Youth Games. These came into being on the eve of the 1968 Mexico City Olympics thanks to CONI, on the initiative of President Giulio Onesti, who believed that strengthening the competitive component of school sport would benefit the entire sports movement in the peninsula. The federations, the promotion bodies and, from 1974, even the Ministry of Education officially contributed to its implementation from 1977 onwards, with the involvement of primary school pupils, giving around 9 million students a year the opportunity to take part in the games.\n\nMORALLY USEFUL SPORT: THE CATHOLIC CHURCH\n\nThe Catholic Church opened up to physical activity and sport on the wave of Leo XIII’s encyclical ‘Rerum Novarum’, which showed not only a special attention to the new social dynamics created by the industrial revolution in the world of work, but also a growing interest in modernity. This thinking was also influenced by the desire to provide an element of dialogue with the new generations to counter the Protestant proselytes who had played sport in the British Empire and gymnastics in Germany. After a heated debate between traditionalists and modernists, ‘muscular Catholicism’ soon established itself in Italy, first in the context of elitist colleges, such as those of the Jesuits, and then in society as a whole, thanks to bodies such as the Federation of Italian Catholic Sports Associations and ‘Forza e Grazia’, the counterpart women’s organisation founded in 1923. The activities of these organisations were influenced by the thought of Father Giovanni Semeria, one of the pioneers of Catholic sport, who stated: ‘Sport is not only of physical utility, but also of moral utility. A healthy body is impossible without a healthy mind. Games in which the social and collective element is found are of special importance and utility’.\n\nLITTLE GAMES IN THE ORATORY\n\nStarting in the 1840s, Don Giovanni Bosco and his collaborators gave impetus to the oratories, with the intention of creating a space for young people belonging to all social classes. After World War II, oratories played a not insignificant role in welcoming and caring for many youngsters in the afternoon hours and on holidays. Playgrounds and cinemas spread equally in the oratories, but their presence was not homogeneous throughout the country: they grew mainly in the large cities of the north, particularly in Lombardy and the Veneto.\n\nORGANISING SPORT\n\nThe first institutional organisation of Italian sport was the Gymnastics Federation, despite increasing competition from individual sports federations. Their coordination was complicated until 1921, when the Italian National Olympic Committee, established in 1914, took over. After the Second World War, CONI, duly democratised and freed from Fascist ideology, took on a threefold role, guiding sports policy until recently under the slogan “Sport for sportspeople”. Today we are going through a long phase of reform, which has seen the creation, alongside CONI, of Sport e Salute and various institutions of a ministerial nature.\n\nGIULIO\n\nInitially appointed as liquidator, the Turin lawyer Giulio Onesti became the deus ex machina of the new post-fascist CONI. Convinced that a new body would have to be created from scratch in the event of liquidation, he not only managed to preserve CONI, but also to make it the pillar of the sporting system in republican Italy, remaining at its helm until 1978. Under the leadership of Onesti, Italian sport experienced a season of growth and hosted the Olympic Games for the first time.\n\nPROMOTING SPORT\n\nThe link between elite Italian sport and the Armed Forces is a very old tradition that was only regulated in 1954, when the first convention was signed to support the training of athletes as an investment by the State in fostering the growth of great champions. Despite being a legacy of a time when participation in the Olympics was formally reserved for amateur athletes, this link continues to grow. Today, some 2,500 athletes are registered with the Military Sports Groups (Army, Carabinieri, Air Force, Navy and Guardia di Finanza) and the State Corps (Police, Fire Brigade and Prison Police).\n\nA QUESTION OF SPORTS DIPLOMACY\n\nOver the years, the activities of the Italian government and diplomacy have extended to sport, within the broader framework of ‘diplomacy for growth’. Through sport it is in fact possible to strengthen good relations with friendly countries and promote Italy’s image abroad. The organisation of major events has represented and continues to represent an important moment for countries to meet and cooperate, and they have always also been showcases for the promotion of the country, territories, culture, businesses and districts, generating economic inducements, stimulating tourism and attracting foreign investment.\n\nMORE AND MORE ELDERLY PEOPLE\n\nDuring the 20th century, the life expectancy of Italians has lengthened considerably. Improvements in overall living and working conditions, a richer and more nutritious diet, and access to better and more consistent health care have increased life expectancy from 29 to 82.4 years. However, these improvements have also brought new challenges: the discovery of new diseases, a greater awareness of the role of lifestyle in health and of the importance of an active life and a healthy diet as a means of prevention.\n\nLife expectancy at birth\n\nyear life expectancy at birth\n\n1861 29\n\n1881 35\n\n1901 43\n\n1921 49\n\n1941 56\n\n1961 69\n\n1981 75\n\n2001 80\n\n2021 83\n\nTHE COST OF BEING LAZY\n\nSedentariness causes\n\n9% of cardiovascular diseases,\n\n11% of type 2 diabetes cases,\n\n16% of breast and colorectal cancer cases\n\n60% is the correlation between sedentariness and excess weight\n\nIN PRISONS\n\nArticle 27 of the Italian Constitution enshrines the principle that sentences must aim at the re-education of the convicted person, so Article 15 of the 1975 Prison Ordinance stipulates that ‘the treatment of convicted and imprisoned persons shall be carried out by making use mainly of education, work, religion, cultural, recreational and sporting activities’ and therefore ‘Cultural, sporting and recreational activities shall be encouraged and organised in the institutes’. With a Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2013, CONI launched the excellence ‘Sport in Prison’ project in many Italian prisons.\n\nSPORT IN THE SUBURBS\n\nIt has been widely demonstrated how sport can play a fundamental role as a tool for social and urban regeneration and for combating deviance and criminality among young people in urban peripheries and areas of social marginalisation and poverty or economic and cultural deprivation. In Italy, two significant examples are the Paladiamante project in Begato (Genoa), developed in 2010, and the Spazio47 neighbourhood centre, inaugurated in Catania in 2015. In 2018, the Open Space project, present in the suburbs of four Italian cities, used sport to socially reactivate public spaces and combat marginalisation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.\n\nSPORTCITY: A GLIMPSE INTO THE FUTURE\n\nThe Sport City concept represents a possible solution to all of the above. This concept is not limited to the mere presence of sports facilities in cities but configures a city model that integrates sport into every aspect of life, from mobility to public health. The idea is that sport is not just a competitive activity, but an element of social inclusion and quality of life. The concept has been theorised by various urban planners and architects, including Richard Sennett and Jan Gehl. Following the example of the Olympic Park in Barcelona, or the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London, Italian cities such as Turin are now taking the lead in this movement.\n\n——————————————\n\nSuperhumans\n\nIn the 20th century, our knowledge of the body, medicine, physics and chemistry has expanded considerably: we have discovered and are discovering the origins of many diseases and are decoding the deep workings of our bodies and brains. Technology and science have made great strides, allowing us today to equip the human body with devices that increase its ability to go faster, higher and further, but also expose it to serious threats to survival.\n\nThis section asks how far man will go in his quest for perfection, beyond the limits of his humanity, and what questions the combination of technology, medicine and sport will raise for the future. Will we all become a little more superhuman? Will technology and science help us to be better or will they confront us with moral choices that are more important than ever in sport?\n\nTECHNOLOGIES THAT EMPOWER US, TECHNOLOGIES THAT PROTECT US\n\nSince the dawn of time, humans have realised that their ability to build tools would be crucial to compensate for the fragility and limitations of their bodies. They began to invent ways to protect themself, but also to empower themselves, and this quest for protection and performance enhancement is evident in the field of sport, where there are almost endless technologies developed to go ‘stronger, faster and farther’, and to do so more safely. The regulations of the various disciplines themselves have increasingly focused on preserving the health of athletes, introducing the compulsory use of a range of equipment and accessories necessary to safeguard their bodies and prohibiting risky practices.\n\nTHE MOTORBIKE AIRBAG: AN ITALIAN EXCELLENCE\n\nHelmets, goggles, gloves, boots, armour and all sorts of devices for protection in the event of an accident have accompanied the history of motorsport: many revolutions in this sector have arisen in Vicenza. Indeed, from the imagination of Lino Dainese and his collaborators came a series of technological leaps, such as the full leather suit, modular back protectors inspired by armadillos, sliders and, above all, the electronic airbag. A revolution that, developed today for motorcycling sports and otherwise, can be applied to the protection of all athletes and all fragile members of society, such as the elderly and children, limiting damage in the event of a fall.\n\nTHE GREAT PROSTHETICS WAR\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, several doctors in Tuscany were at the forefront of research into the development of orthopaedic prostheses that would allow rudimentary movement. Returning from the Libyan war, one of them, Giuliano Vanghetti, had attempted to operate on amputated limbs while preserving their functionality. It was not until the First World War, with its dramatic increase in the number of invalids, that prosthetic construction was developed to a more complex level. The Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute in Bologna became one of the main centres for the treatment and rehabilitation of soldiers returning from the front with severe mutilations. The results of the workshops set up a few years earlier led to the creation of prostheses that were no longer mere fillers, but useful hands capable of performing simple gestures thanks to the residual impulse given by the injured muscles, thus restoring a semblance of normality to life.\n\nINAIL AND ITALIAN EXCELLENCE\n\nEven today, Italy is still a world leader in the testing of orthopaedic prostheses for sports and other fields. Thanks to INAIL – National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work – and its orthopaedic workshop inaugurated in 1961, and thanks to the collaboration between it and the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa, our country is in fact at the forefront in the field of robotic prostheses. The work of these two public bodies shows the state’s commitment to caring for citizens who are victims of accidents or have congenital disabilities to improve their quality of life. In addition to developing all the prostheses for the Italian National Paralympic Team, the two organisations have also developed the patent for the ‘Hannes’ bionic hand, the ‘Exo-H2’ wearable exoskeleton and a range of bioelectric prostheses that use artificial intelligence to analyse the wearer’s muscle signals in real time.\n\nTHE PARALYMPIC GAMES\n\nItaly can also boast another great success in the field of adapted sport: the organisation of the first Paralympic Games. In fact, it is thanks to the work of Dr Alfredo Maglio, his intuition and collaboration with Ludwig Guttmann, organiser of the 1948 Stoke Mandeville Games in the United States, that sport for people with disabilities made significant progress. Maglio, who specialised in the rehabilitation of victims of work-related injuries, soon realised the importance of sport for the motor and psychological rehabilitation of his patients. In 1961, he founded the Paraplegic Centre in Ostia, near Rome, for INAIL, which played a crucial role in promoting sport for people with disabilities, transforming social perceptions around them. This gave rise to the idea of the first ‘Paralympics’, organised in Rome in 1960, starting a global movement that led to the founding of the International Paralympic Committee in 1989.\n\nItalian Paralympic medals\n\nItalian Paralympic athletes with the most medals\n\nSUPERHEROES?\n\nBEBE\n\nWho doesn’t know Bebe Vio? Gold medallist in individual fencing at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 and Tokyo 2020 games and holder of countless European and world titles, the Veneto athlete is a role model for thousands of people, so much so that she was awarded the title of Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic for her contribution not only to the Italian sports movement, but to society as a whole as an example of courage, resilience and overcoming prejudice.\n\nALEX\n\nAlex Zanardi, who has become a symbol of resilience and determination, began his sporting career as a racing driver. After winning two titles in the American CART championship, he was the victim of a serious accident in 2001 that led to the amputation of his legs.. Recovering, he returned to racing with adapted cars and devoted himself to paracycling, winning a long series of world championships and two medals at the Paralympic Games in London 2012 and Rio 2016, becoming a true legend. Paralympic Games, becoming a true legend. In 2020, an accident during a road race once again threatened Alex Zanardi’s life, leaving the Italian public in suspense.\n\nTHE FUEL OF SPORTSMEN\n\nToday, we all take the importance of nutrition in sport for granted. A good nutritionist is just as important as a trainer, because it is through food that our bodies find the energy to exercise and regenerate after intense training. All the elements are equally important: vitamins, proteins, carbohydrates, fibre – the perfect balance of our Mediterranean diet. For a long time, however, this was not offered to athletes, who were given high doses of protein. It was not until the 1950s that the relationship between nutrition and sport became a field of study, with the emphasis on our Mediterranean diet based on cereals. Among the first to understand its importance were Fausto Coppi and Giacomo Agostini, who recognised the importance of nutrition and general physical training for high performance in their disciplines.\n\nEAT MORE SUGAR!\n\nBefore the triumph of light or protein foods and supplements, the athlete’s diet was already the subject of marketing, but in completely unexpected ways. In the 1950s and 1960s, sugar and sweets were promoted as ideal foods for athletes through massive advertising campaigns; companies presented them as sources of quick energy, associating their consumption with athletic performance. Athletes were often portrayed consuming sweets, consolidating the idea that they were essential for physical activity. The lack of knowledge of the risks associated with excessive sugar consumption contributed to this perception, which now seems decidedly outdated.\n\nALCOHOL\n\nAt the turn of the century, alcohol took the lion’s share of the tables of all Italians, who drew most of the calories they could not get from other, more nutritious foods from alcoholic beverages. It was therefore normal, even for athletes, to consider alcohol a food like any other. Things changed in the 1920s. As the first diet books appeared, people began to restrict the use of alcohol, which could impair athletes’ performance.\n\nSMOKING\n\nToday, it would be unthinkable for a professional athlete to smoke, except in a few cases, but the perception of the damage caused by smoking has struggled to take hold. Up until the 1960s and 1970s, it was not uncommon to see athletes smoking, but the situation began to change as scientific evidence of the damage to health and the negative impact on physical and respiratory performance grew. This change in mentality became more pronounced in the 1980s, when many sports organisations began to discourage smoking among athletes. In the 1990s and early 2000s, anti-smoking policies became more stringent, with the introduction of laws banning smoking in many public places, including sports stadiums and arenas.\n\nPLAYING DIRTY: DOPING\n\nAccording to the most influential Italian encyclopaedia, Treccani, ‘the term doping indicates the use of drugs, pharmacological combinations or medical practices with the aim of improving performance during sporting activity’. Combinations and practices spread across multiple disciplines and developed in step with the medical-scientific and pharmacological knowledge available in the various eras and increased as top-level sport became a spectacle and a lucrative industry. At the end of the 19th century, two Italian physiologists, Angelo Mosso and Paolo Mantegazza, were the first to demonstrate through their studies the benefits that could be obtained in sport from the use of certain substances such as cocaine and caffeine, and in 1904 the term ‘doping’ appeared for the first time in the ‘Gazzetta dello Sport’, referring to the use of doping quadrupeds in horse racing.\n\nDoping practices have devastating effects on the psycho-physical health of those who take them, whether professionals or amateurs. In Italy, the first death caused by doping was that of the cyclist Alfredo Falzini in 1949, in the middle of the Milano-Sanremo race. Nevertheless, the growing awareness of the mirage of miraculous sporting results promised by these substances has led to experimentation with ever more sophisticated systems.\n\nGUARDS AND THIEVES, ANTI-DOPING\n\n‘The practice of doping in sport is not only cheating, a shortcut that nullifies dignity, but it is also wanting to steal from God that spark which, by his mysterious designs, he has given to some in a special form’, Pope Bergoglio said in 2021, closing any possible discussion on doping, effectively justifying the rigid moral division between ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ and the challenge between guards and thieves that has developed in the anti-doping sector. The first international body to combat it was the IAAF in 1928, but it was not until 1967 that the IOC decided to introduce anti-doping tests. In Italy, the introduction of testing in the Giro d’Italia came as early as 1968 and the first organic anti-doping law was introduced in 1971, which was then updated in 2000 when doping was equated with a criminal offence by aggravating only the sporting offence.\n\nCOPPI’S ‘BOMB’\n\nIn cycling at the beginning of the century, in a still backward Italy, the real ‘doping’ – and even for some cyclists of very humble origins the real mirage – was to be able to eat well and in abundance. On the other hand, cycling, with its heavy bicycles, bumpy roads and disproportionately high mileage, required an inhuman effort. Apart from ‘natural’ doping, such as the intake of 34 eggs that Alberto Binda is said to have eaten during the Tour of Lombardy in 1926, all riders tried to resort to energising mixtures. After the Second World War came a ‘modernisation’ in the use of stimulants. Coppi was the first to understand the importance of being followed by a doctor to dose energisers. In 1952, in a radio interview, he revealed the contents of the mythical ‘bomb’, based mainly on an amphetamine, sympamine, synthesised in Italy in 1937, and which until the 1970s was sold as a tonic in pharmacies; today it is considered a narcotic and used only in limited clinical cases.\n\nTHE APOGEE OF EPO\n\nMarco Pantani is synonymous with Italian cycling in the 1990s. The ‘Pirate’ captured the Italian summer and imagination from 1994 to 1999. His whole life was thrown into the limelight when, in 1994, he climbed the Stelvio and the Mortirolo, the area where the myth of Coppi was born. His legend, however, is more enduring than his fortune: having won the Tour and Giro in the same season, he was stopped by the doping squad at Madonna di Campiglio in 1999, at the height of his fame. Pantani, who tested positive for the use of Epo, a substance that increases the number of red blood cells widely used by cyclists in the 1990s to facilitate endurance and recovery – which was to be at the centre of the Lace Armstrong scandal, winner of seven consecutive laps. was disqualified. “This time I won’t get up again,” he tells reporters. What remains of him is the myth and the belief in his innocence of the last “people” of cycling.\n\nA GLIMPSE INTO THE FUTURE: CYBORG-ATHLETES\n\nLooking to the future and considering all that has been said in this section, cyborgs, human-machine hybridisation and artificial intelligence appear on the horizon as fascinating and controversial scenarios for sport. Athletes with advanced prosthetics have shown that a human with prosthetics can run even faster and more efficiently than one without. Furthermore, AI could revolutionise training, analysing biometric data in real time to optimise performance to the point of opening chip hybridisation scenarios to influence a person’s emotional state. However, the integration of technology raises ethical, regulatory and philosophical questions: what will sport be when we are no longer ‘just human’, fragile and subject to the unpredictability of existence?\n\n——————————————\n\nLove\n\nSport is also, and above all, a matter of love. A long history of rituals and myths, gestures and superstitions to be respected, ritual pilgrimages, heroes to imitate, choirs to sing.\n\nTo use the categories of the great English historian Eric Hobsbawm, we can without a doubt consider sport to be one of the ‘secular religions’ of our time: just as with religions, there are gods, apostles, preachers, practitioners, worshippers and calendars to be respected with certain doses of sacredness and ritual.\n\nThis section is a small emotional journey through the Italians’ support for their favourite sports, from the stands to the sports bars, from all-time champions to the unconditional love for the national team, from the World Cup on the big screens to the radios of the 1950s, from the Fantacalcio card to ‘Novantesimo Minuto’. A mosaic of memories in which all Italians can recognise themselves.\n\nTIFO\n\nItalian is one of the few languages to have found its own word for public support at sporting events: ‘Tifo’ a name borrowed from a disease that causes high fever. The dictionary defines ‘tifo’ as “passionate enthusiasm, often fanatical, for a sports team, a champion or even a public figure”, which goes beyond the moment of the match and becomes a way of life and a declaration of belonging and identity. On the other hand, there would be no sport without cheering: no performance and no victory would be meaningful without the presence, support, gossip and coverage of the public in the stands. And Italians, as fans, crowd the stands of arenas and stadiums, undertake gruelling journeys to follow their favourite team, crowd the roadsides to cheer on cyclists, set off fireworks, build merry-go-rounds, share beer and watermelons in front of big screens, comment on sporting events in bars and all the meeting places, and finally, they pay huge sums to subscribe to all the platforms that allow them to follow their idols from the comfort of their sofas at home.\n\nCOUCH ATHLETES\n\nItalians are world-famous for the liveliness of their cheering, a practice that, it is said, fascinates them more than the sporting activity itself. But what are the 10 sports that keep us glued us to the sofa?\n\nTOTOCALCIO\n\nWho has not experienced at least once in their life the thrill of filling in the 0-X-1 slip, hoping that on Sunday evening their winning combination will appear and their bank account will suddenly be flush with funds? This is the ritual of the Totocalcio, created in 1946 by Massimo Della Pergola, a betting game on the results of Italian football. Inspired by the English ‘football pools’, it was introduced to finance CONI and the Italian sports sector and quickly became a collective act of millions of Italians. With the advent of online betting, its popularity declined, but it remains an icon in our collective imagination.\n\nTHE ‘FIGURINE’\n\n‘Figurine’ (stickers) arrived in Italy in the 1920s and 1930s as an advertising tool, all shapes and colours were printed, and sport was one of the last themes to appear in collections. Helvetia chocolate from Reggio Emilia was one of the first to include a collection of sports-themed stickers in its packaging. It was 1929 and of the 90 motifs, 33 were dedicated to cycling, 15 to motorcycling and football, 12 to motor racing, 9 to boxing and 6 to running. But the quality of this new medium really took off with the founding of the Panini company in Modena in 1961, which launched the first album dedicated to the Football World Cup that same year. Self-adhesive stickers and all the commercial activity that went with them quickly became a cultural phenomenon that influenced several generations and is still an integral part of Italian childhood.\n\nPLAYING SPORTS\n\nAnyone who was a child during the years of the economic miracle can tell of the hours spent playing with crown caps – the caps that close soft drinks or tomato bottles – covered with pictures of their favourite racers and weighed down by a perfectly filed slide. They are the rudimentary version of another game with which they soon hybridised: marbles. Marbles, no longer made of terracotta or glass, but of plastic, with a transparent hemisphere enclosing the cyclist’s figurine and with which fierce races are run on tracks slowly modelled on the beach or in the earth. And what child of the 1980s does not remember with emotion Subbuteo and its players, with their hemispherical bases that could be pushed forward with the fingers? Invented in the immediate post-war period in Great Britain, it is the alter ego of another great leisure time classic of Italians, the table football or, as it was called in Mussolini’s time, the ‘Calcio-Balilla’, the absolute protagonist, along with table tennis, of afternoons in oratories, party sections, bars and summer beaches.\n\nFANTACALCIO\n\nCreated in the late 1980s by journalist Riccardo Albini, who was inspired by US baseball and football fantasy leagues, Fantacalcio quickly became a passion for millions of Italians. Its success and popularity was largely due to the collaboration of La Gazzetta dello Sport: since 1994, the sports daily has devoted several pages to the game, providing votes to calculate the scores. It is in fact a virtual game in which ‘fanta-trainers’ build a team with real players, whose score is derived from the actual performances they put on the pitch every Sunday. It is a game that strengthens and destroys friendships, is a topic of conversation in bars and among colleagues, but above all it helps to make football the most popular sport among Italians.\n\nWHAT SHALL WE CALL HIM?\n\nWhat makes two people to choose a name for their newborn child? In the past it was family and religious traditions, then the desire to wish prosperity and success, and finally the desire to emulate myths from popular culture. First names from operas, then those from literature, and finally those from film and television. Since the 1920s, however, the names of sporting heroes have also imposed themselves, hand in hand with the spread of the mass media that build sports stardom and the figure of the champion. A fashion that has never gone out of fashion, considering that between 1984 and 1991 alone, 515 children were registered in the Naples registry office with the name Diego or Diego Armando.\n\nPLACES OF DEVOTION\n\nLike any religion, sport also has its places of devotion, often linked to the myth of certain great teams and which are inserted into urban landscapes, becoming protagonists in photographs and postcards. Sports facilities have seen the greatest names in Italian architecture put their skills to the test, integrating themselves into the urban fabric and even transforming it to meet the needs of a sporting movement, the crowds and the increasingly numerous and frequent competitions. From the Dall’Ara stadium to the stadium in Florence, designed by Pier Luigi Nervi, from the Foro Italico to the Marassi in Genoa, several stadiums and sports facilities are also monuments, while others are linked to mythologies, such as the Filadelfia stadium in Turin, which preserves in its new structure part of the bleachers that witnessed the exploits of Valentino Mazzola and the Grande Torino. Arenas, stadiums, rings, swimming pools and facilities of all kinds are also real places of pilgrimage for fans, so much so that some have been turned into museums, such as the Madonna del Ghisallo or the Juventus Stadium.\n\nITALY AT THE OLYMPICS\n\nThe modern Olympic Games were born in 1894 from the intuition of the French baron Pierre de Coubertin, who was idealistically convinced that a sporting festival, inspired by the Olympic Games of ancient times and the Universal Exhibitions, bringing together the youth of the world every four years, could be a vehicle for peace. Two years later, the first edition was held in Athens: Italy sent no delegation, but two Italian athletes, Rivabella and Airoldi, tried to take part. The former possibly competed in the shot – but we do not know his placing – the latter wanted to run the first marathon in history but was disqualified for professionalism. Until 1992, the Games were reserved, at least formally, for amateurs. The first medals arrived in Paris in 1900, an edition that was swallowed up by the Universal Exhibition.\n\n27 participations in the Summer Olympics\n\nGENERAL CLASSIFICATION POSITION\n\nSummer Olympics: 6th\n\nWinter Olympics: 12th\n\nOverall medallist: 7th\n\nTotal medals won: 741\n\nOverall ranking by total number of medals in summer and winter disciplines\n\nThe 5 most medalled Italian athletes of all time:\n\nEdoardo Mangiarotti (fencing) – 13 medals.\n\nArianna Fontana (short track) – 11 medals.\n\nStefania Belmondo (cross-country skiing) – 10 medals.\n\nValentina Vezzali (fencing) – 9 medals.\n\nGiulio Gaudini (fencing) – 9 medals.\n\nThe 3 athletes who have participated in multiple Olympic Games\n\n8 editions: Raimondo and Piero D’Inzeo (horse riding); Josefa Idem (canoeing); Giovanni Pellielo (shooting)\n\nHEROES OF THE MARATHON\n\nThe fascination of running lies in man’s attempt to overcome his own limitations using only his legs. Ugo Frigerio, marcher, led Italy to its first Olympic medal in 1920. The record of 19’72” for the 200 metres flat, set by Pietro Mennea in 1979, remained unbeaten until 1996. However, the Apulian sprinter never achieved the popularity of other sportsmen, not only because of his tendency to embody a spirit of sacrifice rather than enthusiasm, but also because of the lack of interest shown in athletics by sponsors for a long time. Following the memory of Dorando Pietri, Italy also became home to marathon runners: in 1988 Gelindo Bordin, a good-tempered Veneto native, won the first Italian gold medal in the queen of races. The podium was then regained by Stefano Baldini in Athens in 2004, the last Westerner to reach the top step before the triumphs of Kenyan athletes.\n\nROME 1960\n\nThe first Olympic Games, held in Italy, marked a radical change in modern sport. The Olympic Games took on a commercial dimension and athletes became tools and vehicles for advertising. Demands for equal rights and non-discrimination on the basis of race and gender grew, so much so that the United States chose an African-American, Rafer Johnson, to be the flag bearer. Rome is a city trying to shake off the legacy of fascism – evident in the symbols of the Foro Italico, built by Mussolini for the coveted 1944 Olympic Games. In a medal table dominated by the Soviet Union and the United States, Italy finished third with 13 gold medals. These included the 200 metres on the flat, won by Livio Berruti, and the welterweight boxer Nino Benvenuti. The former, a former sick child who ran with sunglasses to compensate for severe short-sightedness, broke the Olympic record with 20″5 and became a national hero. The second, a former European champion, turned professional and then entered the Hall of Fame of the greatest boxers of all time.\n\nTHE HOME OF THE WINTER OLYMPICS\n\nUnlike the summer Olympics, hosted in Italy on only one occasion, our country has already organised the winter Olympics on two occasions and is preparing to do so for the third time. The first, held in Cortina d’Ampezzo in 1956, just four years after the end of a war in which Italy was a defeated power, symbolically confirmed the country’s full re-entry into the international sporting arena. Fifty years later, the Winter Games returned to the Italian Alps: in Turin 2006, the Italian delegation won five gold and six bronze medals. The Piedmontese capital also managed to complete its urban transformation into a post-industrial city thanks to the Olympic event. Only twenty years after the second one, Italy is now preparing to host its third winter edition: Milan-Cortina 2026. An enterprise that will involve no less than three regions: Lombardy, Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige.\n\nTHE AZZURRI\n\nAlthough the Italian flag is green, white and red, our national team is known around the world as the ‘Azzurri’. An anomaly that has its roots in the political and institutional history of our country. Light blue, the official colour of the Savoy dynasty, which ruled Italy until 1946, was adopted as the badge of Italian athletes from 1910, when it was used by the national football team in a match against France. The newly born Italian Republic decided not to break with the custom and the sentimental baggage that the colour carried, maintaining the colour of the sovereigns even after the end of the monarchy.\n\nTRICOLOUR HEART\n\nThe success at the men’s European Football Championship in 1968 and the ride to the final at the World Cup in Mexico in 1970 triggered spontaneous celebrations in the streets and squares of Italy, in those years associated with political and social conflicts, in which, from below and without any party connotations, there was a massive display of national symbols. There was a widespread feeling that shared belonging to the blue colours had the ability to suspend political divisions. The wait on the eve of the match, marked by early closures and half-empty transports, the liturgy of the night match broadcast live on television, the great heat and the alternation of emotions all contributed to the crowds of Italians invading public spaces at the final whistle in an uncontrollable euphoria that involved not only young men, but also the elderly, children and many women. From that moment on, the festive invasion of public space and the unfurling of national symbols became a tradition to celebrate each victory achieved by the Azzurri.\n\nTHE 82 WORLD CUP\n\nMadrid, 1982. World Cup final Italy-Germany: 32 million people tuned in to set a new record for television viewing figures. The World Cup got off to a bad start for Italy, after a scandal that resulted in the disqualification of centre forward Paolo Rossi for two years. After the first qualifying round, nobody would have bet on the continuation of the adventure of Enzo Bearzot’s national team. But everything changed after the clash with Brazil, which ended 3-2 to Italy in the 89th minute. For the final, 30,000 Italian fans arrived in the Spanish capital, including the President of the Republic Sandro Pertini, who threw his arms up to the sky, mad with joy at the 3-1 win with goals from Paolo Rossi, Marco Tardelli and Alessandro Altobelli. At a difficult time for the country, when the secular religions of politics were beginning to fade and the wounds of the “anni di piombo” were still fresh, football managed to unite Italians where many had failed.\n\nITALY 90\n\nFor the ruling class of the time, it was supposed to be the litmus test of the seventh world power of the 1980s, for everyone it was the ‘missed chance’: or so the 1990 World Cup was called. Much had been invested in this edition of the Cup, which the Italians entered as the favourites. It was Maradona who put an end to the Azzurri’s ‘magic nights’ and led Argentina to the final against West Germany. Some hoped that the Azzurri would be able to repeat the success of Vittorio Pozzo’s Italy, who had won their first World Cup on home soil in 1934; others believed that they would be able to see the burning torches of the fans who had greeted the first European Championship victory in 1968 in the stands of the Olimpico. Ten years after Italia 80, the Italian national team had reached the semi-finals.\n\nMAGICAL NIGHTS\n\nProminent contemporary composers were brought in to celebrate major sporting events. Among the creators of the World Cup and Olympic anthems were two Italian Oscar winners: Ennio Morricone and Giorgio Moroder. Morricone, whose name until then was linked to the films of Sergio Leone, Elio Petri and Pier Paolo Pasolini, composed the theme for the controversial 1978 World Cup in Argentina; while Moroder, after winning Oscars in 1979, 1984 and 1987, wrote the music for ‘Hand in Hand’, the anthem of the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games. Moroder was also called upon to write the notes of what became a real summer hit, ‘To Be Number One’, better known in Italy as ‘Un’estate Italiana’ (An Italian Summer), which, sung by two pop stars Gianna Nannini and Edoardo Bennato, was renamed ‘Notti Magiche’ (Magical Nights) for its famous refrain.\n\nTHE GAME OF THE HEART\n\nThe singers’ love for football was also demonstrated in 1992 with the creation of the ‘partita del cuore’, a charity event that for the last 32 years has pitted the national team of Italian singers against various teams, including RAI Radio and Telecronists, pilots and politicians. If the first match in 1992 (80,000 spectators) was the most attended, followed by the matches with the sports champions in 1994 (60,000) and with the magistrates (70,000), one of the most interesting matches was the one with the parliamentarians in 1996. The singers fielded, among others, Mogol, Enrico Ruggeri, Luca Barbarossa, Gianni Morandi, Eros Ramazzotti and Luciano Ligabue; the politicians, in the first year of the Prodi government, presented themselves with a bipartisan line-up, which included Roberto Maroni, Ignazio La Russa, Pierferdinando Casini, Massimo D’Alema, Clemente Mastella and Walter Veltroni. The match ended 2-2 after regulation time. After the penalties, in a friendly spirit, it was decided to end the match with a result of 4-4.\n\nTHE CHAMPIONS CUP\n\nIn 1981, in the song ‘Milano’, Lucio Dalla ends a verse by stating: ‘then Milan and Benfica, Milan that struggles…’. The reference is to the first Champions Cup won by Milan in 1963, against the strong Portuguese team, defending champions: the first of the seven Champions Cups/Champions League won by Milan. Today, the Rossoneri are, after Real Madrid, the team with the most victories. Other Italian teams to have excelled in the competition include Inter in 1964 and 1965, under Angelo Moratti, and his son Massimo in 2010. The Champions Cup has been a curse for Juventus, who won it twice, in 1985 and 1996, but lost seven times in the final. The first of the Bianconeri’s two trophies came against Liverpool in Brussels. The victory, overshadowed by the drama that unfolded that night at the Heysel stadium, brought attention to the problem of violence in stadiums. Among the Italians who reached the final without victory were Roma, who at the Olympic Stadium lost on penalties against Liverpool in 1983, and Fiorentina, who lost the final to Alfredo Di Stefano’s Real in 1957.\n\nCHAMPIONS\n\nEach of us has a champion in our heart. A character who has marked our individual and collective imagination, who has made us passionate with their charisma and their exploits. A great pantheon that makes us all feel a little more Italian.\n\nFEDERICA\n\nFederica Pellegrini, the ‘Divina’ of Italian swimming, has conquered everyone’s heart with her extraordinary feats. The first woman to break 4 minutes in the 400m freestyle, she has won 1 Olympic gold, 1 silver and 6 world gold medals. She has participated in five Olympic Games, from Athens 2004 to Tokyo 2020. Her career, which lasted from 2001 to 2021, is a symbol of excellence, grit and inspiration for all.\n\nVALENTINO\n\nOn 5 June 2009, Valentino Rossi triumphed in one of the most epic MotoGP races in Catalonia, cementing his status as a living legend. The ‘Doctor’, who owes his fame and the devotion of many to his charisma as well as his talent, started racing at the age of just 9 and collected 9 world titles in different categories, becoming one of the most successful riders ever. His career, from 1996 to 2021, saw successes with teams such as Aprilia, Honda, Yamaha and Ducati. With 115 victories and 235 podiums in 432 races, he is still a rider the world envies.\n\nMARCEL AND GIANMARCO\n\nOn 1 August 2021, Marcel Jacobs and Gianmarco Tamberi wrote an indelible page in Italian sports history. On the same day, Jacobs won gold in the 100 metres at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games with a time of 9.80 seconds, while Tamberi won gold in the high jump, clearing 2.37 metres. Jacobs, a sprinter extraordinaire, is the first Italian to win the Olympic 100 metres; while Tamberi, with his charisma and resilience, overcame a career marred by injuries. These simultaneous triumphs ignited national pride, paving the way for successes to be repeated in the 2024 Europeans.\n\nJANNICK\n\nIn the summer of 2024, Italy was thrilled by a red-haired young man: Jannik Sinner, who became world number one, an epic achievement for the young man from San Candido, a small mountain village in northern Italy. Growing up in the Dolomites, Sinner started out as a skier, but found his true passion in tennis. His rise is extraordinary: in 2021 he wins his first Masters 1000 in Miami, in 2022 he triumphs at Wimbled"
