        "text": "“Most people only live once. But I’ve lived 141 lives,” said Claude Joséphine Rose Cardinale in 2014. She is known by the world as Claudia Cardinale, one of the most successful European movie actresses of all time, with a career spanning nearly 70 years.\n\n“The loveliest compliment I’ve ever received was from David Niven. When we were shooting The Pink Panther (1963), he said: ‘After spaghetti, you’re Italy’s happiest invention,’” Cardinale added on that occasion, when she was receiving the Actor’s Mission Award in Slovakia.\n\nIn collaboration with Cinecittà (Rome), the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) of New York is this month presenting an in-depth retrospective of Cardinale’s work, including 23 films, 12 of which are restorations.\n\nBorn in Tunisia (Africa) to Sicilian parents on April 15th, 1938, Cardinale will be 85 this spring. Her first film appearance was in 1958, a minor role in Goha, with Omar Sharif, and since then she has never stopped working in films and, occasionally, theater. Even last year a new movie of hers came out: The Island of Forgiveness, written and shot by Ridha Behi in Tunisia.\n\nA truly international actress, fluent in Italian, French, English, Spanish, Sicilian dialect, and Tunisian Arabic, she has worked with the most famous Italian filmmakers and screenwriters, including Federico Fellini, Luchino Visconti, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci, Valerio Zurlini and Sergio Leone.\n\nCuriously, because of her natural French accent, it was not until 1963 in Fellini’s Otto e mezzo (8½) that Cardinale’s own voice was used in her Italian films. “When I arrived for my first movie, I couldn’t speak a word. I thought I was on the moon. I couldn’t understand what they were talking about. And I was speaking in French; in fact I was dubbed. And Federico Fellini was the first one who used my voice. I think I had a very strange voice,” she told The Guardian in May 2003. Luckily, she added, “In Italy in the sixties, it was the magic moment of Italian cinema. We were always together, the directors, the actors, it was an incredible atmosphere.”\n\nIn the same interview, Cardinale commented: “Bridgett Bardot says: ´You’re not a woman, you’re a man´.” And: “I don’t think I’m an actress. I think I have the capacity and the possibility to become the woman I’m supposed to… I like silence… I don’t like the star system… For me, work is something, and private life is something else, very separate… I’m a normal person. I like to live in Europe. I mean, I’ve been going to Hollywood many, many times, but I didn’t want to sign a contract.”\n\nIn over five decades (1961-2014) she has won six out of seven nominations for the David di Donatello Awards, the biggest honor bestowed by the Accademia del Cinema Italiano. The prestigious Venice Film Festival has given her two awards: for Best Actress (1984) and Career Golden Lion (Leone d’oro alla carrier, 1993). And in 2002 she received an Honorary Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival. She is also an active feminist and has been a UNESCO goodwill ambassador for the Defense of Women’s Rights since 2000.\n\nIn February 2011, The Los Angeles Times Magazine listed Cardinale among the 50 most beautiful women in film history. The legendary actress, who currently lives in Paris, did not attend the opening night at the MoMA, but was represented by her daughter, Claudia Squitieri, who also directs The Fondazione Claudia Cardinale.\n\nThe ceremony started with the screening of Un Cardinale donna (2023), “a short poetical portrait” of the actress directed by Manuel Maria Perrone. Also part of the retrospective is the publication of the Cinecittà book “Claudia Cardinale. L’indomabile -The indomitable”, curated by her daughter. Among so many other details, the book reminds us that Visconti described Cardinale as “a splendid tabby cat that for the time being scratches at the cushions in the living room (…) but that one of these days we will realize is a tiger.”\n\nF. Murray Abraham (Golden Globe winner in 1985) attended the opening at MoMA, fresh from his recent nomination as Best Supporting Actor – Television Limited Series/Motion Picture for The White Lotus. Next to him was his “son” from that show, Michael Imperioli, two-time Golden Globe nominee for The Sopranos.\n\nThis retrospective has been curated by Joshua Siegel (MoMA), and Camilla Cormanni and Paola Ruggiero (Cinecittà).
