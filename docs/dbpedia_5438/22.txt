In this episode of our podcast, we have two guests from the Scuola Leonardo Da Vinci: Chiara Avidano and Wolfango Poggi, the directors of the schools in Turin and Milan. They will tell us about the 2023 "ST Star Award" award ceremony in which they participated, and how exciting it was to receive the award as the best "Italian language school".

This award, very important in the language travel sector, is collected every year at a gala evening held in a luxury hotel in London.

A real Oscar (but we could say a "David di Donatello"â€¦ do you remember the episode?) for all those who work in the field of study holidays abroad.

The episode will also focus on the expression "3 volte di fila".
