        "text": "MARGARET WARNER:\n\nFor more on the president's choice for homeland security chief, we turn now to three people who know Michael Chertoff.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger was deputy attorney general for the first President Bush during the years that Chertoff served as a U.S. Attorney, and he has maintained a personal and professional friendship with Chertoff since then.\n\nRichard Ben-Veniste, a member of the 9/11 Commission, squared off against Chertoff during the Whitewater hearings, when Ben-Veniste was chief counsel for the Senate Democrats.\n\nAnd Elaine Shannon has covered the Justice Department for years as crime and national security correspondent for Time Magazine. Welcome to you all.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, give us some insight into Michael Chertoff. What does he bring in a terms of his personal professional qualities to this job?\n\nELAINE SHANNON:\n\nWell, he was the brain behind the whole 9/11 strategy, except for some of the Supreme Court arguments.\n\nHe's the guy who said we're going to go spitting on the sidewalk strategy now; that means that if you're an illegal alien, they happen to find you, maybe you were not connected in any way with terrorists, still if you are illegal they would take you in and they would hold you and then you'd end up facing deportation proceedings.\n\nIf they thought you were a terrorist, they would use any law they could to get you off the streets. It's an old term from mob prosecution days, and Mike Chertoff is an old mob prosecutor, and it was very effective but very controversial.\n\nGEORGE TERWILLIGER:\n\nWell, that's a great question because it does go to Mike's ability and his background to do this job well, I think, Margaret, because what Mike's mark was that he could work with a wide variety of people from a wide variety of agencies and not just federal agencies, but state and local as well.\n\nMike was extremely well respected in New Jersey as giving everybody a place at the table and an opportunity to participate.\n\nRICHARD BEN-VENISTE:\n\nThe senators on the majority side. As we know, Whitewater discovered neither impropriety, much less illegality on the part of the president. But Mike is a hard-charger, he's aggressive, and I think the knock on him is, if anything, over aggressiveness.\n\nNow, that was almost ten years ago. So he's had some time to mature, I think, and this is a much different assignment. And so I was pleased to hear that he talked this morning about balancing the need to protect civil rights and privacy, because that is an essential part of this job.\n\nELAINE SHANNON:\n\nYes, I think he was very much taking the point on those. Now, if you look at the larger actions that the administration did, I don't believe that he was on the side of military tribunals.\n\nHe'd come up in the criminal justice system as we've traditionally known, and I believe that he thought that process could work fine; George can tell you more about that. Also I don't know where he stood on the issue on Geneva Conventions.\n\nThe torture memo that we heard about last week that came out of the White House and out of Alberto Gonzales' office, that never went through Chertoff's office; it's very interesting that the people who had been in jury trials and the Justice Department never got to see that memo; it was sort of off to the side there.\n\nGEORGE TERWILLIGER:\n\nNot perhaps so much as a friend of his but as somebody that had the opportunity to converse with Mike and other people immediately in the time after 9/11. I think it's important that we keep in mind that this wasn't a one-phase type of reaction.\n\nThere was a phase and a reaction that was entirely appropriate immediately after 9/11 when the country seemed, and I think was in extreme danger. And there was an aggressive use, taking the law to its limits to make â€”\n\nGEORGE TERWILLIGER:\n\nExactly, to keep the country safe. Then we turn to a more long-term solution. And I think that's where Mike probably made his greatest contribution was in looking down the road; as the president has said time and again, this is not a one-year or two-year problem, this is a very long-term problem and we need some long-term strategies to deal with it.\n\nAnd I'm glad Mike will be back in the mix on policy to help with that.\n\nELAINE SHANNON:\n\nWell, number one, he can get confirmed in a heartbeat. This guy has been through that process three times, he leads a rather austere life, as far as I can tell. I think he works almost all the time, and when he is not taking care of his kids and running, he's in the office. I don't think he sleeps.\n\nNumber two:\n\nhe is a very decisive man. I've never heard anybody call him a bully or unpleasant, but he likes to get in there, he's a man of action, he doesn't like to chew the fat for hours and hours; in other words, I think he likes to fish or cut bait. And that will be, I think, his management style at the Department of Homeland Security, where there's a huge, huge management problem there.\n\nRICHARD BEN-VENISTE:\n\nNot particularly, I don't think. And that's the area of skepticism with respect to this. But Gov. Ridge had Adm. Lloyd, I'm sure Mike Chertoff will supplement his skills and abilities with able administrators.\n\nBut this is a challenge beyond that, which anybody has faced in getting these 22 agencies working together, singing from the same song book, and using the same IT.\n\nGEORGE TERWILLIGER:\n\nWell, I think Mike will be a really hands-on manager. I mean, he ran a large U.S. Attorney's office, running the criminal division of the Justice Department is a national responsibility.\n\nI don't think Mike will have any difficulty taking the next step up to a cabinet position. And I have no doubt that people throughout the Department of Homeland Security from top to bottom will know exactly what the secretary wants.\n\nRICHARD BEN-VENISTE:\n\nAside from the administrative job of melding these different agencies in one cohesive agency, the job entails prioritizing, assessing our vulnerabilities, and then making decisions as to where the dollars need to go to protect our homeland.\n\nBorder security, transportation, beyond airline security we've got rail, and port security to deal with. And then there's the issue of prioritizing the funds from national, from this Department to the states and cities.\n\nIt's a mess now; it's pork barrel now; and it's got to change. New York City, which has been the target of I think six terrorist attacks, is 49th out of 50 states in terms of per capita dollars that they are receiving. So there's got to be some strength and leadership there in terms of prioritizing that process.\n\nELAINE SHANNON:\n\nWe've got to get the Europeans and other foreign countries to go along.\n\nThey need to start telling the United States who's on the airplanes and the other conveyances coming into this country before they get up in the air, or they take off because there's just not enough time to run down their backgrounds without date of birth, a passport number and other information.\n\nThis last Department tried and was not able to get that kind of information early on, and they need to work on this now.\n\nGEORGE TERWILLIGER:\n\nWell, it is a big part of the job, and it's really the Homeland Security Department I think is on the forefront of a totally new relationship between the federal government and the states and localities.\n\nThe need for cooperation and joint effort is as if never, it's never been before. I think Mike is well suited to that; when he was a U.S. Attorney in New Jersey he ran an organization from his office that was designed to coordinate law enforcement activities in areas like drugs and violent crime and gangs and so forth.\n\nSo he knows how to get it done. And I think when a person who has been a U.S. Attorney has had the opportunity to be on the ground and listen firsthand to police chiefs, mayors and other state and local officials who really communicate what their needs are, can't always meet them, but I think they'll find a friend."
