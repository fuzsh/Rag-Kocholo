        "meta_description": "Chertoff covers numerous aspects of his long association with the Bush White House. In the first half, Chertoff focuses on his activities in Bush’s Department of Justice (DOJ), with particular focus on the DOJ’s prosecution of terrorists after the September 11 (9/11) terrorist attacks, the USA PATRIOT Act, Guantanamo Bay, and the prosecution of the Enron scandal. In the second half, Chertoff focuses on his time as Secretary of Homeland Security and the challenges of running a new department with an excessively broad scope of issues. Chertoff discusses the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)’s “all hazards” approach to numerous issues, ranging from biological weapons and cybercrimes to natural disaster planning and responses. Of particular focus in this section are the government’s response to Hurricane Katrina, the role and purpose of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and coordination among DHS, state governments, and local governments. He also briefly discusses Congress’s attempt to reform immigration.",

        "text": "Riley\n\nThis is the Michael Chertoff interview as a part of the George W. Bush Oral History Project. We’re at your offices in Washington, thank you very much. I’m Russell Riley. I’m the chair of the Oral History Program. Martha, say a few words so the transcriber will know your voice.\n\nDerthick\n\nI’m retired from the faculty of the University of Virginia. I was, for five years before that, Director of Governmental Studies at the Brookings Institution. I retired from teaching in 1999 but have retained an interest in American government.\n\nBrown\n\nI’m Seyom Brown. I’m now at SMU [Southern Methodist University]. I’m Director of Studies at the John G. Tower Center for Political Studies, and also I’m involved in an oral history project there.\n\nRiley\n\nI don’t want to wander too much into biography, but I have a couple of questions about your early career, particularly your clerkship with Justice [William] Brennan, and then your time with the Whitewater Committee. I’d be interested in your observations about what you were picking up about Washington and public service during those periods, that you bring with you later into the higher-level government position.\n\nChertoff\n\nClerking is not really Washington so much as it is experience in the judicial process. You see what goes on inside the Supreme Court and you work closely with the Justice. I don’t know that it gives you much insight into the larger political environment, except what you read in the newspapers with everybody else.\n\nThe Whitewater experience—Again, it’s specific to Congress. I guess it does teach you a little bit about what goes on in Congressional investigations, the fact that the rhythm of what occurs is very much driven by the public affairs element. Everything has to be condensed and pitched in a way to appeal to television and news, rather than some other audience. In that sense it’s an interesting lesson in the fact that much of the agenda in Washington—not all of it, but much of it—is driven by the media and trying to deal with public engagement on various issues.\n\nRiley\n\nSo your sense about press relations is something that’s important to you later as you go into these other—\n\nChertoff\n\nI just think you become aware of the fact that you’ve got to be able to explain things quickly, understandably, and with some recognition of the fact that it’s going to have to be self-contained. The press doesn’t have a lot of patience for footnotes when you give an explanation, so you’ve got to be able to give a self-contained discussion.\n\nRiley\n\nWere you at all involved in the campaign in 2000?\n\nChertoff\n\nOnly a little bit. I raised a little bit of money, not much. And there was a group of people, a large group I’m sure, who were asked to contribute policy papers or policy observations, and I did some of that. I wouldn’t say I was by any means at the core of it. I wasn’t a Vulcan or anything, but I did contribute some on the criminal justice process. I had been U.S. attorney under President [George H. W.] Bush, so I was well known to people in the criminal justice group who were around then-Governor Bush.\n\nRiley\n\nWho would those people be?\n\nChertoff\n\nI don’t remember, to be honest with you.\n\nRiley\n\nWould [Alberto] Gonzalez have been somebody in that group?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo. But I remember submitting a paper in which I talked about what I thought were going to be the big issues in criminal justice in the next five to ten years. One of them was terrorism; one of them was money laundering; and one was high-tech crime. I guess I actually turned out to be right about that.\n\nRiley\n\nHow did you end up then moving into the administration?\n\nChertoff\n\nMy secretary at work—I was a partner at a law firm—got a call one day from the White House, asking if I would be willing to go down and talk to the personnel people. This must have been right after the President was inaugurated, maybe slightly before but probably afterward, about the possibility of the job as head of the Criminal Division. I said sure, and I went down and met with someone in the personnel office and talked to him about 30 minutes. They actually had my résumé and knew who I was. Someone had told me previously that my name had come up on a list of people who might get a Justice Department job. Then they sent me over to meet with John Ashcroft, who was then either the AG [Attorney General] or designated AG. I don’t know if he was confirmed yet.\n\nBrown\n\nHad you known him before at all?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo. I met with him for about 30 minutes, and then sometime within the next week or two I got a call on my cell phone from the personnel office saying that the President would like to nominate me to be head of the Criminal Division. If I was willing to accept, I had to start the paperwork, the background check. I said yes and then I was off to the races.\n\nRiley\n\nWere there other positions in the administration that you thought you might like to move into?\n\nChertoff\n\nI didn’t really think about getting a position.\n\nRiley\n\nSo you were happy in private practice at the time?\n\nChertoff\n\nYes. I had no expectation of getting a position, but I was certainly—Having had the experience of being the U.S. attorney, being head of the Criminal Division seemed like an attractive job.\n\nDerthick\n\nDid you think of the job primarily as an administrative job, or does the head of the Criminal Division often do prosecutions?\n\nChertoff\n\nThat’s an interesting question, and depending on who you ask that question, you’re going to get a different answer. If you ask the United States Attorneys, they think it’s an administrative job. If you ask different Assistant Attorneys General, you probably would have gotten a different answer. There’s no doubt I went into it with the idea that it was going to be a litigating job, that the Criminal Division was going to be a litigating division and would be going to court.\n\nIn that sense I was probably a little different from some other heads of the Criminal Division. It’s probably fair to say that people in the division liked that, by and large. Some didn’t. Some were comfortable being behind the scenes, but some of them liked it. Some U.S. attorneys didn’t care for it very much, partly because after 9/11 the center of gravity changed, and partly because of my background. Having tried a lot of cases and having been a U.S. attorney, I probably had a little more ability and drive than maybe someone else would have.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you have discussions with the Attorney General about your characterizations of the position?\n\nChertoff\n\nI don’t know that I specifically did. As things evolved, and particularly after 9/11, it became clear that—I think it temperamentally suited the Attorney General, that this was going to require much more involvement by Washington, because the international security issues are much more national than the typical type of prosecution that you get in a U.S. Attorney’s office.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat were your impressions of Ashcroft when you met with him?\n\nChertoff\n\nA really nice man, smart, somewhat self-effacing, very focused on doing the right thing.\n\nRiley\n\nThat post, if I recall correctly, was one where there were a number of different candidates who had been contemplated. I have this vague sense that maybe Ashcroft had been designated late.\n\nChertoff\n\nNo, but I think he had a little bit of trouble getting confirmed.\n\nRiley\n\nOK.\n\nChertoff\n\nI don’t think he was designated late, but he had a little bit more—There was a little pushback on the confirmation.\n\nRiley\n\nWhich is a little unusual, right? Normally the Senate, if they take one of their—\n\nChertoff\n\nWell, if you look at John Tower, I think the days when there was Senatorial courtesy are gone.\n\nRiley\n\nOK, fair enough. Did you have understandings with the Attorney General about access or about your latitude in operating?\n\nChertoff\n\nNot going into it. Over a period of time the Attorney General came to trust me, and to like me. I always felt I had good access to him and very good support from him, so that was never an issue for me.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd by the time you come in—\n\nChertoff\n\nI came in either May 31st or June 1st of 2001.\n\nRiley\n\nBy that time, is there a lot of internal momentum, or is there a sort of backlog of things?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo. What there is is a lot of unconfirmed positions because the process was very slow. You had an AG, you had a deputy, I was in there, [Theodore] Ted Olson was in, and Viet Dinh, and that may be it. There may not have been any other confirmed positions.\n\nRiley\n\nIs that a problem?\n\nChertoff\n\nIt’s a problem when you have to do anything, because unconfirmed leadership tends not to have the ability to really drive decisions. I don’t think it’s atypical for an administration, because the first year becomes not a very dynamic year because we don’t have a lot of people in place. It became more relevant after 9/11.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat are the major things that are on your agenda?\n\nChertoff\n\nAlong the lines of what I said to you, I really wanted to have the division be a litigating division, not a service division. So I sat down and met with all the unit chiefs, and frankly, I replaced some and we did some reorganization because I thought there were some people who had been there for a long time, had a very settled way of doing things, and they weren’t in any rush to get things done. I always felt like you have a fixed amount of time in the job. If you’re going to accomplish things, you’ve got to get moving. So we shook things up a little bit. That was probably in the first two or three months: June, July, August. August was kind of a quiet time in Washington. So that process took place in that period of time.\n\nRiley\n\nThose are career people that you—?\n\nChertoff\n\nYes, right. You don’t fire them but maybe you move them to a different job.\n\nDerthick\n\nHow important is the Criminal Division within the Justice Department? Is that seen as a main—\n\nChertoff\n\nIt depends. There are certain things by rule or regulation that the division has to approve, so in that sense it has authority. It does not actually supervise the U.S. attorneys—a big misconception. The Deputy Attorney General does. The Assistant Attorney General is, in a way, equal to the U.S. attorney, even a bit higher, because there are certain things where he has the authority to approve or not approve certain kinds of prosecutions. But in terms of actually running cases or investigations, it’s not clearly demarcated where he has running room or not. Certainly, some of the big U.S. attorney offices tend to resist the Criminal Division coming in. Now as part of what happened—There were two big things that happened in my tenure that changed that: 9/11, but also Enron.\n\nWhen Enron came, the U.S. attorney’s office in Houston claimed it. I’m sure the Southern District of New York would have claimed it too, but since it was in Houston, it was kind of hard for them. However, it turned out that there were so many recusals in Houston because so many people in the office knew people who had worked there or had lost money there, that at some point they began to think, you know, this is not going to work. Then what I did was I recruited an Enron task force. I hired assistant U.S. attorneys from around the country, or brought them in, because I wanted to get topflight people, but I also wanted to have a credible group, and then we announced it.\n\nWe took over all the Enron prosecutions, and that was probably a coup for the division, because in the old days it would have been the Southern District of New York or another district that would have grabbed onto them, but we just moved quickly to do it. Probably by that time my relationship with the AG was sufficiently strong that I got the backup. Had I not had that relationship, I might not have been able to carry that out.\n\nSo we wound up basically, between the terrorism stuff, which we also centralized, and the Enron stuff, probably changing the way the division operates. I think it’s still true that the division now is viewed much more as a litigating division than it was prior to my tenure.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you have a lot of personnel decisions to make when you came in?\n\nChertoff\n\nWell, there were the changes at the top.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nChertoff\n\nSo there were those, and then you hire people, but that’s just hiring your entry-level positions.\n\nRiley\n\nRight. And other than that, the shuffling around of the career folks that you’ve already talked about.\n\nChertoff\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\nThe division of labor that you mentioned—You said the Deputy AG usually would have—\n\nChertoff\n\nHe actually supervises the U.S. Attorneys.\n\nRiley\n\nRight. What’s the rationale for that?\n\nChertoff\n\nIt’s always been that way, or it’s been that way since I can remember. The rationale is that the U.S. Attorneys are viewed as separate components. I can’t explain why; it’s just always been that way. That’s the table of organization.\n\nBrown\n\nIn the earlier part of your career, both as a clerk to Brennan, and maybe even going back to law school, and then when you were prosecutor, were you developing anything that you would call a kind of philosophy of your approach?\n\nChertoff\n\nYes, it’s probably fair to say—I don’t think the clerking—I was just a young person. But from being prosecutor, from being the U.S. Attorney, my philosophy was that time is short. Figure out what you want to do. Establish your priorities, and then understand you’re working under the clock. That means you can’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. It means you don’t have an endless amount of time to make cases, and it means you’ve got to decide, since you have only a certain amount of time during the day, what you really want to spend your time doing. And that’s the way I operated as U.S. Attorney.\n\nI focused very much on political corruption cases, organized crime, and big fraud cases. And we set deadlines. You have to have the judgment to know when a case is ready and when it’s not ready, but I also know there are people who always hope that if they work on a case, at some point the smoking gun or the treasure trove will turn up, and that’s rarely what’s going to happen. At some point when you have enough, enough is enough and you’ve got to pull the trigger. I would say that was my philosophy: Decide what you want to do, understand the amount of time and the resources you have to do it, and then plan accordingly.\n\nBrown\n\nWhat about substantively?\n\nChertoff\n\nI’m not sure what you mean.\n\nBrown\n\nWell, the rights of the criminal type of things that the Civil Liberties Union people were always concerned with, as opposed to the rights of the victim, and so on.\n\nChertoff\n\nGenerally, my opinion on that was we have a set of rules, you stay within the lines, but within the lines you’re as aggressive as you can be. But I was a defense attorney for many years, too, and I was aggressive as a defense attorney. Lawyers are basically lawyers. You give them a set of rules, and then they play within the rules.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat about the substantive areas that you confronted—let’s deal with the period before 9/11 as a separate element.\n\nChertoff\n\nThe truth is it really was not a lot of time, because if you consider the fact that it’s June, July, August—August is always a slow month.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nChertoff\n\nSometime in August, I remember saying to my wife, “You know, things are really kind of slow around here. I hope it doesn’t turn out to be boring.” My wife frequently reminds me when I say things are boring, “Don’t say that. We’ll have another disaster.”\n\nIt was mainly organizational. I thought we’d probably do big fraud cases, corruption cases, the normal things. We had one big terrorism case: We indicted the Khobar Towers bombing that summer, which goes back to ’96. Other than that, it was pretty slow, pretty much organizational. I don’t think there was any real—We hadn’t gotten traction in terms of setting up a positive agenda like things where I would say, OK, we’re going to pursue these areas. Then of course 9/11 came, and the whole thing changed.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat can you tell us about the interior life and culture of the Department of Justice while you were there? There are a lot of different divisions. What’s the relationship like? Is there competition for resources?\n\nChertoff\n\nThe divisions are quite separate and the lanes in the road are quite different. There’s very little competition because they don’t really rub up against each other. I couldn’t have told you what the Antitrust Division was doing. Once 9/11 came, there was a little more interaction with the Civil Division because some of the terrorism stuff they had to handle, and some we handled. But it wasn’t competitive; it was kind of cooperative. Likewise, we had some interaction with the Office of Legal Counsel because of the 9/11 stuff, and with the SG’s [Solicitor General] office because of appeals. But by and large, the lanes on the road are pretty clearly marked out in the divisions.\n\nRiley\n\nWere there the equivalent of Cabinet meetings? Did you have all-staff meetings where the division heads—?\n\nChertoff\n\nThe deputy used to have meetings of the division heads periodically, every couple of weeks or so, and then after 9/11 they set up a little internal security council that would meet periodically. That would be the heads of the components that were focused on national security issues.\n\nRiley\n\nBut there’s nothing else in the pre-9/11 period that really merited those meetings?\n\nChertoff\n\nWe didn’t really have a fully confirmed complement, so there weren’t a lot of people to meet. It was a pretty small group.\n\nRiley\n\nSo you’re not a full year into the administration but you’re talking about losing the better part of the first year, without having people in or any people.\n\nChertoff\n\nWell, but for 9/11, we probably would not have had confirmed people until late in the year, fully across the board. After 9/11 everyone said, “We can’t mess around anymore.” But certainly for the first three months—June, July, August—maybe only half a dozen people were confirmed.\n\nRiley\n\nYou had said earlier that you had included terrorism on the list of issues that you thought would be important.\n\nChertoff\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nWhy was that the case?\n\nChertoff\n\nKhobar Towers, in 1998 bombings in East Africa, the USS [United States Ship] Cole. It was obvious that it was a big issue and it was going to increase. I didn’t anticipate that it was going to be at the level it was, but I mean just from awareness of what was going on. I had also been somewhat involved in the ’93 investigation at the World Trade Center.\n\nRiley\n\nIs that right? How was that?\n\nChertoff\n\nBecause I was the U.S. attorney of New Jersey and a lot of the activity occurred in New Jersey.\n\nRiley\n\nCan you tell us your account of 9/11, where you were?\n\nChertoff\n\nYes, which I’ve told many times. For some reason, we had something at home and I was slightly late getting in. So I’m in the car shortly before 9:00, and I’m on the Rock Creek, coming into Washington.\n\nRiley\n\nYour residence was in upper northwest?\n\nChertoff\n\nIt was in Chevy Chase. I’m on the phone with my assistant Valerie [Smith] and she says, “Bruce Swartz,” who was one of my Deputies, “wants to talk to you.” She shifts me over and Bruce says, “A plane just went into the World Trade Center.” My first thought, like everybody else, was that some pilot had committed a grievous error, a small-plane pilot. He’s got the TV on and we’re talking about it and he says after a moment, “Another plane went into the World Trade Center.” I said, “Oh, blank. This is an attack.” We decided that I would park and we’d go across to the SIOC, the Strategic Information and Operations Center at the Bureau [Federal Bureau of Investigations] on the fifth floor, which is where, at that time before DHS [Department of Homeland Security], they ran all domestic incidents.\n\nSo I park and we go across the street. I don’t know whether I was there when the plane hit the Pentagon or whether I had just made it over to the Bureau at that point. We go in and the place is completely—It’s a beehive of activity. Remember, you have Bob Mueller, who has been there for eight days. I had known Bob for years. We were in the first Bush administration together. The AG was in Minnesota, on a plane, because he was supposed to give a speech. Larry Thompson, I think, eventually went out to a location, and so I’m the only confirmed person besides Mueller in the thing. That day we’re all trying to figure out what the heck happened and, most importantly, to try to prevent something else from happening.\n\nWe hear about United 93, conflicting reports about where it is, whether it’s crashed, whether it’s not crashed. I’m in an SVC, a secure videoconference, at one point, and I hear the order given to shoot the plane down, which is something I never thought I would hear. In fact, for about two days, I actually thought 93 had been shot down.\n\nBrown\n\nWhen you say you heard about that order—\n\nChertoff\n\nI was present on the SVC and the Vice President passed down the order. I think that’s a real memory, not a false memory, that the plane was going to be shot down, authorizing the plane to be shot down.\n\nRiley\n\nBut you characterized that as the Vice President passed on—\n\nChertoff\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nYour sense was that it was something that he had gotten from the President himself?\n\nChertoff\n\nI’m reading a book now that is debating that and deconstructing it, and I can’t weigh in on that. I can only tell you what I heard. I wasn’t trying to figure out who had spoken to whom first.\n\nRiley\n\nOf course.\n\nChertoff\n\nAt one point the fire alarm went off in the State Department and there was a belief that a bomb had gone off in the State Department. There was a rumor that we had to run down, about taxi drivers detonating bombs in front of public buildings. Then during the course of that day what we did was—People calling up from the planes enabled us to triangulate, to some degree, the locations on the planes where the hijackers had been sitting. From that, we were able to put the manifest together. My recollection is that by the end of the first day we pretty much knew most of the hijackers, what their identities were, and we began the process then of investigating, in other words, finding out: How did they get there? What was the infrastructure that allowed them to get on the planes? How did they pay for the tickets? That gives you credit cards and you can track that back to find out what hotels they stayed in.\n\nBrown\n\nYou’re describing a process that starts. Is this something that you were ordering from your position?\n\nChertoff\n\nI’m working with Mueller and Tom Pickard in ordering this. We had to generate the subpoenas and things. It was a collaborative effort. We were all sitting in a big room, and I had a little space outside that where I had some folks from the division sitting. I’d go out and we’d get paper out and we’d do some legal stuff and we’d come back in. It was all a stew of people.\n\nRiley\n\nI don’t want you to lose your train of thought in recounting this, but I do want to ask a question. You said that lawyers are good at, or what they do is you give them a set of rules that they use as the parameters that they work in.\n\nChertoff\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\nAt this time, are you conscious of where those boundaries are? Or is the need to deal with the issue at hand creating either a separate set of boundaries—\n\nChertoff\n\nYou have to take it in slices. The first day, you’re not really getting into bumping up against because you’re just issuing subpoenas. You want to find out what you can about who paid for the tickets. From that, where did they stay in hotels? Get search warrants. Search rooms. You’re trying to track back.\n\nRiley\n\nOK.\n\nChertoff\n\nAt some point as the days go on—It’s like one giant day. For about two months, the routine was pretty much the same: Get into the office around 6:00 and go right to the Bureau. I wasn’t even in my office at Justice for probably two months. Then stay there until probably 9:00 or 10:00 at night, go home, come back. So it was like one long day.\n\nDuring the course of this, we realized we were going to hit—We’re starting to uncover people who are connected in some way to the hijackers. Now, many of them may be connected innocently. We found a couple of people who had sold them false documentation. They were arrested because it was obviously a crime. What winds up happening is—What you’re most worried about is, are there other people out there who are going to pull the trigger on something else? The question is how do you incapacitate them? How do you prevent them from doing that while you’re determining whether they’re a risk or not a risk?\n\nThey basically fall into three categories: There are some people like the people who provided the phony documentation, who have committed a crime, so you can arrest them and then you’ve got a whole established process. It turns out there are a lot of people you run across who are in violation of the immigration laws. It’s not a crime. Well, it actually is a crime but it’s not a typical criminal code offense, but it is something that allows you to hold them. They go before an immigration judge, but if you’re in the country illegally, you don’t really have much of a claim to bail. So there is a host of people that we run across who are connected in some way: Maybe they shared a residence; maybe they had some financial interaction with a hijacker. While we’re trying to figure out if they are dangerous or not, we are able to hold them under the immigration laws.\n\nThen there is a group of people who don’t fit within either category, who the law allows you to hold as material witnesses. Again, it’s under a judge’s supervision, and you can hold them as material witnesses as long as you are going to put them, at some point, in front of a grand jury and get evidence from them. In these cases, we pushed the law to the line; in other words, we were creative in applying the law but we always stayed within the bounds of the law. Contrary to urban legend, we didn’t detain people without a legal basis. Everybody always had a right to go before a judge, although judges are not super inclined to release people if they think there’s some uncertainty about whether they’re a risk or not.\n\nThe total number of people who were held in the course of this process was about 750, contrary to the rumor of thousands of people, which is not true. The IG [Inspector General] did an investigation in this eventually and found only one case out of 750 where there was not a legal basis to detain somebody. Were we aggressive in seeking detention when the law allowed it? Absolutely. But no one was ever detained without a legal basis.\n\nBrown\n\nHow large a group of people did you deploy to handle that?\n\nChertoff\n\nThe Bureau pretty much threw everybody at it they had.\n\nRiley\n\nI want to go back—I interrupted your account of the first day.\n\nChertoff\n\nBasically the first day is about tracking down and identifying, beginning the process of linking up the hijackers to other people, whether it is how they got the documents, where they had rooms, where they rented cars, what the phony identification was. Then that just continues over the course of subsequent days.\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nChertoff\n\nAt some point in that process, the AG came in and said that the President has asked us to look at any legislation that we might need at this point, so we began the process of putting together what became the Patriot Act. Also, there were numerous briefings for the Hill. I remember going up to the Hill with Mueller, probably three or four times, and meeting with all the Members of Congress the first week, literally in the Chamber, and talking about what was going on, what the investigation was showing, things of that sort.\n\nRiley\n\nBut in the earliest stages, you weren’t feeling greatly constrained by the legal parameters that you were working in, in terms of conducting the investigation as you wanted to conduct it.\n\nChertoff\n\nNo. You could usually find a legal tool that would allow you to do what you needed to do. Some of them were imperfectly adapted. In an ideal world, you would have a set of legal tools that were better adapted to this process. The happenstance of whether someone is in immigration violation or not—It happened that it was convenient in a way that many of them were, so that was an available tool. If they hadn’t been, it would have become more of a problem in terms of how to detain people while you’re deciding whether they’re a threat or not.\n\nThe thing that people forget is there was a real serious question, particularly given the fact that we had not had an inkling of what happened on 9/11 before, about whether we were going to have even more serious attacks. Had we conducted business as usual, and had there been another attack, it would have been devastating for the confidence of the American people in the government. The reason people didn’t lose confidence was because of the very vigorous response afterward.\n\nBrown\n\nWould it be incorrect to say that you were telling people, “If there is any suspicion at all, detain them, and we’ll find a legal basis for it”?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo. It was correct to say, “If there’s suspicion, reasonable suspicion, find a legal basis, and if there is a legal basis, detain them.” No one ever said, “Detain them and then we’ll find a legal basis.” That would not be correct.\n\nRiley\n\nWas it also the case that, because of the circumstances, the judges that you were relying on, in many instances, were vastly more amenable?\n\nChertoff\n\nI think the judges applied common sense. We didn’t come in with bogus things, so there was always a legal basis to detain. Then the only issue is the judge exercising discretion about whether they think someone is a bail risk. And in an environment where there’s some connection to terrorism, and given the fact that, by definition, someone is out of status, so there is question about their bail—It’s not a hard stretch to get people to say we’re not going to release them.\n\nRiley\n\nThe cluster of questions relates to what you were just beginning to address, which is, the Attorney General comes to you and says, “We’re thinking about legislation.”\n\nChertoff\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\nThe fundamental notion behind the legislation is there must be things that we can improve on or correct. What I’m trying to figure out is how are you becoming aware of the limitations that are in existence through prevailing law?\n\nChertoff\n\nI don’t think it was specific to the experience we had in the first days after 9/11. There were two main things. There are some little cats and dogs that wound up in the bill that I wasn’t really involved with, but the two main things were: one, preventing the division or the split between intelligence information and criminal information, which had been the prevailing rule of the Justice Department. It prevented us from combining to get a full picture, connecting the dots. That was the main thing we tried to do in the Patriot Act.\n\nAs it turns out, we probably didn’t need to do the Patriot Act for that, because eventually the FISA [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] Court of Review said the original Justice Department interpretation was too conservative, and actually the old rule would have allowed us to combine things. But at the time, it wasn’t clear and we wanted to make it clear. Then there were some technological upgrades that took account of the fact that the Internet as a form of communications resulted in a discontinuity between the things you could do with analog telephones, in terms of wiretapping, and the things you could do with Internet. We wanted to have it be a level technological playing field.\n\nOn the issue of the silos, two or three days after 9/11, I finally got permission as head of the Criminal Division—the judge gave us permission to go and look at the intelligence files. I may have been the first person to see the [Zacarias] Moussaoui file. This is a guy who had been arrested taking flying lessons. He was in violation of his immigration status. He was in custody as an immigration detainee prior to 9/11, in August, in Minnesota. They thought there was something funny about the guy. They wanted to search his laptop but they couldn’t get permission because they didn’t have enough probable cause from an intelligence standpoint and they couldn’t treat it as a criminal case because of the division.\n\nFinally, when that was lifted after 9/11, the judge let us look at that stuff. We saw what was on his laptop, which was stuff that suggested involvement in 9/11. I remember saying—Pat [Patrick] Fitzgerald was there—I think I said, “Oh, shit, when they see this they’re going to realize that there was evidence that this was going to happen beforehand.” I remember telling the AG and Mueller, “You guys better take a look at this because you’re going to be hearing about this.” Of course, ultimately we did the case against Moussaoui, but also that became one of the issues in the 9/11 Commission: What had been known beforehand? That was something I personally witnessed, how that barrier had prevented us from seeing that. When it lifted and I saw what we had missed, it motivated me on the Patriot Act piece.\n\nRiley\n\nThat’s “the wall.”\n\nChertoff\n\nThat’s right, the wall.\n\nRiley\n\nHad your take on the wall been earlier that it had been too conservative?\n\nChertoff\n\nEarlier I thought it was kind of foolish, mainly because when I first came on board, again because there were so few people, there were times when I was Acting Attorney General if the AG was out of the District. As Acting Attorney General I would have to sign the FISA warrants before they went to the judge. So in theory, when I was Acting Attorney General, I was seeing things on one side of the wall that I would have to forget when I went back to being head of the Criminal Division, which strikes me as kind of a fundamentally silly arrangement.\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nChertoff\n\nThat was obviously much more profound as a problem when 9/11 revealed the fact that there were actually things that could have been connected that were not because of the wall.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd your experience tells you that the wall was in reality being—\n\nChertoff\n\nWell, it’s not my experience; it was the FISA Court of Review. Eventually a case made its way up and they said, by the way, even prior to the Patriot Act, that the requirement of a barrier was overstated and the Department of Justice was overly cautious in reading what the law was.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd the roots of that would have been in the [William J.] Clinton administration?\n\nChertoff\n\nI think it went back a ways. I’m not criticizing the Clinton administration for this. In general, when it comes to lawyering in the government, lawyers are by and large prone to be very cautious about even approaching the line. Over time, a crust develops, where you wind up being pushed further and further back, because no one wants to get even close to the line, but you also leave space that could be occupied by the government. And in the case of 9/11, it probably was a significant contributor.\n\nRiley\n\nYou had indicated that you went up to the Hill several times very early on. Could you tell us about the meetings on the Hill? Who went up? Who you were meeting with?\n\nChertoff\n\nI usually went with Mueller and we met either with Senators or Members of the House, and lots of them would come and we would brief them on what was going on: where we were, what we had learned.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat were you hearing from them?\n\nChertoff\n\nQuestions, a lot of support, no criticism, a lot of, “Do whatever you have to do.”\n\nRiley\n\nSo they were amenable to—\n\nChertoff\n\nThe Patriot Act—I had asked the Senate—I think Russ Feingold was the only guy who voted against it.\n\nDerthick\n\nHad you known Mueller before?\n\nChertoff\n\nI know Bob going back to ’87, ’88, when he was assistant to Dick Thornburgh and I was first assistant and then U.S. attorney in New Jersey. So I had known him since the late ’80s.\n\nDerthick\n\nSo you were working closely with him.\n\nChertoff\n\nOh, yes, I was a good friend of Bob’s.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat about your own involvement in the development of the Patriot Act?\n\nChertoff\n\nViet Dinh and I had the task of assembling the various suggestions. The general rule that the AG had was: Let’s not put really controversial things in. Keep it to stuff that’s pretty plain vanilla, because there were a lot of proposals at any given point in time that were floating around the Department of Justice, and everybody has their pet project. So if it was something that we thought was going to be a controversial issue, we’d put it to one side. Everything we put in was by and large pretty straightforward. It was either getting rid of the wall, or it was creating a technological level playing field between the new technologies and the old technologies.\n\nRiley\n\nDo you remember any ideas in particular that you jettisoned?\n\nChertoff\n\nI don’t remember any. I’m sure there were some, but nothing that comes to mind.\n\nRiley\n\nRight. And this happened all very quickly?\n\nChertoff\n\nPretty quickly, yes, in a matter of days.\n\nRiley\n\nIn retrospect, were there things that you should have put in it, or were there mistakes made in what did go in?\n\nChertoff\n\nI’ve heard people go ballistic about it in the years since, and I’ve said to people, “What is it that you find objectionable?” I’ve heard things like, “Well, it allowed illegal wiretapping,” which I have to say it didn’t. And by the way, by definition that can’t be right, since it’s the law. It can’t be an illegal law. Or people would say, “Well, it authorized the war in Iraq.” I’d say that’s delusional.\n\nIf you look at it, it’s quite plain vanilla. They actually added a few things afterward, like the “lone wolf” provision, which we didn’t have in the first go-around. Notwithstanding the fact that the name, which Members of Congress came up with, probably was the most controversial element of the bill, I think it’s actually pretty plain vanilla.\n\nBrown\n\nWhat about the issue of warrants?\n\nChertoff\n\nIn terms of what?\n\nRiley\n\nThe Patriot Act. That it somehow allowed for an end run around.\n\nChertoff\n\nI don’t think it allows an end run around. What it did is it leveled the playing field for Internet communication so that it was congruent to what you had with telephony. And there were roving wiretaps, which allowed you to basically get a warrant for a phone, rather than for a person. In many cases this had been approved by judges years before, in narcotics cases. Our general rule was if it’s legal to do something in a drug case, for marijuana, it should be legal to do it in a terrorism case. It doesn’t make sense to say, “Oh, yes, for a load of marijuana you can do X-Y-Z, but if it’s blowing up a city, you can’t do that.” But there was no end run, because by definition, as long as you’re inside the Constitution, the law is the law, and I don’t think it changed the warrant requirement.\n\nDerthick\n\nWere there individual Members of Congress, maybe Senator [Patrick] Leahy, who really wanted to get a hand in it, or was the attitude kind of subordinate?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo, I mean, at some point there were Members of Congress who pushed back on certain things. Senator Leahy was one of them but I don’t remember what the particular issue was. There were some things we agreed to, we compromised on. I forget what the issue was but I remember getting a call from someone at the White House and they said, “If we go along with this suggestion by Senator Leahy, is that OK as far as you’re concerned?” And I said, “That’s fine.” They would probably tell you they felt that they didn’t have a lot of political ability to stand in the way of the Patriot Act. That might be true, but that’s what you get paid for as a Member of Congress. If you think something is wrong, you should say it, notwithstanding the political costs.\n\nRiley\n\nThe question I was going to pose and I wasn’t sure about my time sequences, was the AUMF, the Authorization for Use of Military Force the President signs several weeks before the Patriot Act comes up. Did you have any piece of the action on that?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo. I had nothing to do with that.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd there were, beginning fairly early on, a series of memoranda coming out of the Office of Legal Counsel, related to all manner of issues concerning Presidential power. Are you in any way involved at this very early stage in those?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo.\n\nRiley\n\nAre you aware that that traffic is going back and forth?\n\nChertoff\n\nI might have been dimly aware but I was very operationally focused on trying to figure out: Are there more people in the country that are going to be blowing up buildings?\n\nRiley\n\nOK. So the sort of legal and constitutional superstructures, the argument on those things is taking place someplace else.\n\nChertoff\n\nRight, correct.\n\nRiley\n\nRather than in your office, which is a very low-to-the-ground enterprise.\n\nChertoff\n\nWell, I wouldn’t say “low-to-the-ground.” It’s very operational and not very theoretical.\n\nRiley\n\nDid the anthrax attacks—Does that get on your report too?\n\nChertoff\n\nYes. That becomes part of our responsibility as well. Of course initially the thought was that this was perhaps the next wave of terrorism. I don’t remember that much about it, but for some period of time we were investigating it from the standpoint of seeing whether it might be kind of round two. I don’t know at what point the feeling was that it probably wasn’t terrorism from al-Qaeda, that it was something different. It was probably the quality of the weapons, the quality of the anthrax. But there was evidence they picked up in Afghanistan that al-Qaeda had been experimenting to try to develop anthrax and other kinds of biological weapons. So it was by no means fanciful to think that might be the case.\n\nRiley\n\nThere emerges over time an argument about characterizing what the United States is going through as either a war or a criminal justice matter. Is that an argument that—\n\nChertoff\n\nI don’t remember hearing that argument. I think we knew we were at war. There had been a declaration of war against us. The one thing probably not often understood is that in the administration we took an all-of-the-above approach. There was not a view that you should only do things in the military or you should only do things with criminal justice. The view was you should use all the tools. Some tools are more appropriate in some cases and some were appropriate in others.\n\nI’ll tell you my general approach, which I think is pretty much what the AG’s approach was. If someone was a U.S. citizen and they go into the regular criminal justice system—If you apprehend them in the U.S., the presumption is that they’re going to go into the criminal justice system, but it’s a rebuttable presumption. You might hold somebody for a period of time to question them, or if you don’t have a criminal case you might detain them under the laws of war. Eventually, though, probably they’re going to wind up going into the criminal justice system. If someone is caught in the battlefield and they’re not a U.S. citizen, they’re probably not going to go into the criminal justice system. I think it reflected a sense that, from a civil liberties standpoint, you’re uncomfortable if a President can actually arrest people in the U.S. and not have them see a courtroom.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nChertoff\n\nThat could take you down a bad road. If someone is in a battlefield in Afghanistan, it’s like World War II. They don’t get a trial; they just get detained. Then you get some close cases in the middle where, if circumstances suggest there’s a good reason, you might shift the presumption. Basically, with the people who were apprehended in the U.S., like the “shoe bomber,” the Lackawanna, the cases up in Portland and in Washington State—We brought those into the criminal justice system. Moussaoui we brought into the criminal justice system, and that was not without controversy. There were some people who wanted all that stuff in the military, but the AG and I felt that from a civil liberties standpoint you don’t want to take domestic people, people who are caught in a domestic area, and put them in the military, unless there’s some really compelling reason to do it. There was, to be honest, a certain amount of internal stress in the administration over that for the couple years I was there at the Criminal Division.\n\nRiley\n\nThe pushback coming from…?\n\nChertoff\n\nThe Defense Department and the Vice President’s Office generally had the view that pretty much everything ought to go into the military system. We’re at war and everything is a military matter. The AG thought no, not so much in the case of people caught domestically.\n\nRiley\n\nHow much interaction are you having with the White House during this period of time?\n\nChertoff\n\nSome, once we get rolling with the cases. For example, when the final decision was going to be made in December of 2001, about whether Moussaoui was going to go into a military path or going to be tried in Virginia, the AG and deputy used to go over every day to the White House, at that point. They had a morning meeting every day on terrorism threats. The AG and deputy asked me to come to the Oval Office to stand by in case the President wanted to talk to me about it.\n\nAt some point the President called me in and he asked me, “If we do this case, are you going to be able to keep classified information classified?” I said yes. “And do you think the judge is going to keep him in, or is he or she going to let them out on bail?” I said, “They’re not going to let him out on bail.” The President then agreed to have it go into the criminal justice path. There was a debate about whether that would be efficacious or not, so part of what happened when there was a development in the case was we’d go to the White House and say, “Well, this is going on in the case,” and we’d explain what the significance was.\n\nWe also did it with respect to [John Walker] Lindh, because there were issues that were always with Lindh and what he wanted to get in discovery. Again, the White House wanted to know if this is going to be a problem in terms of security, of what’s going on in Guantanamo in terms of our ability to—Is our intelligence going to be revealed? We would generally meet with the White House Counsel and fill him in on what was going on.\n\nRiley\n\nWas that meeting the first time that you had met President Bush?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo. I had met him previously.\n\nRiley\n\nUnder what circumstances?\n\nChertoff\n\nI’m reluctant to talk about it. He talked to me about a possible job, moving me to another position, in the summer of 2001 after I became head of the Criminal Division. So I had actually spent some time talking about it.\n\nRiley\n\nCan you tell us what the position was?\n\nChertoff\n\nWhen they were looking for an FBI director. I was asked to come in and talk about it, and I actually said to him, “I think Mueller is the right choice for that.” So I had met him previously.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you regret telling him that?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo, I didn’t. I think it worked out well for me.\n\nRiley\n\nI bet. OK.\n\nBrown\n\nDid the Attorney General, the Justice Department and so on, get involved in the controversy over the applicability of the Geneva Accords?\n\nChertoff\n\nI can’t talk for the Attorney General, but I wasn’t involved in that.\n\nBrown\n\nNot at all?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo. I mean, I was told. At some point someone said, “Geneva doesn’t apply,” or whatever it was, but that didn’t mean anything to me because it wasn’t my domain.\n\nBrown\n\nSo you didn’t see any of that stuff?\n\nChertoff\n\nI think at some point I was shown an opinion or informed of an opinion on Geneva, but I wasn’t involved in it.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat are the pieces that were missing in this early era? What are the other things that are occupying your time, particularly on the War on Terror?\n\nChertoff\n\nA lot of our focus was in helping investigate whether there were other threats out there. And then you had the various homegrown things that came up. There was the Portland case, and the case up in the state of Washington, and the Lackawanna case. There was John Walker Lindh. There was Moussaoui. There was a file review later on of Guantanamo detainees to determine whether people could be sent back or not, and the Criminal Division, not me personally, used to participate in that and assess the evidence. So we got involved in the prevention piece of this.\n\nRiley\n\nRight, right. Were there vulnerabilities in having your organization involved in the prevention piece? Vulnerability may not be the right word. It’s not clear to me at what level you would have a piece of the action.\n\nChertoff\n\nIn the sense that we’d either know whether there was a criminal case that we could bring somebody, but also just how we developed over a period of time a certain expertise, because we had spent so much time investigating these things, that there was a fund of domestic knowledge on this. We were part owners of that fund, along with the Bureau.\n\nRiley\n\nDoes Enron start as early as the fall?\n\nChertoff\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nOK. And you had a big piece of that.\n\nChertoff\n\nCorrect. Right.\n\nRiley\n\nSo that gets layered on top of everything else that you’re dealing with.\n\nChertoff\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nTell us how that comes to you.\n\nChertoff\n\nWell, as I have said earlier, what happened was, obviously, when they went bankrupt and it became evident there was a criminal problem there, we wanted to be very aggressive in getting ahead of it. First there was a little bit of arm wrestling about whether the U.S. attorney’s office in Houston would do it. It turned out they had too many recusal problems, so I collected a group, kind of an A-team of prosecutors, and said to the AG, “We’re going to set up a task force,” and jumped the Southern district of New York or whoever else might otherwise have tried to grab that. I thought it was important for the division and I thought it was a national case. And it’s ridiculous that you can’t do a national case out of the Criminal Division.\n\nSo we set up this team and we began the process of investigating, and I was pretty personally involved. I used to get a weekly report and I’d sit down with the prosecutors and talk about what their strategy was. Then I got very much involved, of course, in the Arthur Andersen piece.\n\nRiley\n\nWere there political sensitivities that you had to deal with at the time because this is in Texas?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo. I was told at some point that someone in the economic area of the White House was complaining that we were being too aggressive, but I think the President said something publicly that made it clear that he was 100 percent supportive, and that shut that down. The AG, nobody else—the politics never got into it.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd there weren’t sensitivities that you were encountering?\n\nChertoff\n\nWell, there was a huge sensitivity in Arthur Andersen with regard to that, but on the rest of the Enron stuff, not. I once ran into Ken Lay. I was giving a speech and he was in the audience and he came up and it was a little uncomfortable, but that was about the extent.\n\nRiley\n\nThat wasn’t what I was thinking about.\n\nChertoff\n\nThe Arthur Andersen thing got—There was a huge lobbying and letter-writing and emailing campaign that Arthur Andersen tried to generate, including having their foreign subs go to the U.S. Ambassadors and trying to get the U.S. Ambassadors to weigh in, but nobody in the Justice Department and nobody at the White House ever said boo about it.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd I take it, it didn’t do them any good.\n\nChertoff\n\nWell, what happened with Arthur Andersen was this: They had a really good lawyer, Bob Fiske. This arose out of the fact that—First of all, they had had previous problems with securities violations and essentially had been warned by the SEC [Securities & Exchange Commission] and had signed consent decrees and stuff. In this case what happened is there was evidence that when the investigation of Enron got launched, they decided they were going to dispose of either one or two tractor-trailer loads of relevant documents, which is an obstruction of justice. And it was fairly high level. This was not like one guy shredding some stuff. This was certainly at the high level of Houston, pretty senior folks, and a very visible matter. So we said, “This is a criminal offense and the accounting firm is liable for this.”\n\nThey had a lawyer, Bob Fiske, come in, and we were discussing a possible negotiated resolution of it, which would have involved either deferred prosecution where they admit guilt but we agree that we won’t—They’ll pay a fine, but we’ll agree that if they have a monitor, or whatever it is, we’ll ultimately dismiss the charges.\n\nThen they switched lawyers, and they came in and they took a much harder position. I’ll never forget this. At one point the guy—It’s a Sunday, and the CEO comes in. Of course they’re being sued and they’ve got all kinds of problems that are even beyond ours, and they say, “We don’t want to have any settlement with the Department of Justice, but we’re willing to settle with the SEC, where we’ll settle over four years of having false books and records, an SEC type of settlement, and we won’t admit or deny. We’ll pay a fine and we’ll do X-Y-Z.” I said, “I don’t understand this. You’re willing to essentially settle something that would say that four years of your accounting work was bad, but when we ask you to even enter into a deferred prosecution where you’ll admit that you destroyed the documents, an obstruction which is beyond a doubt and that’s not part of your core business, you absolutely refuse to do it. I don’t understand why you’re willing to do the SEC and you’re not willing to do the Department of Justice.”\n\nAnd somebody said, “Well, for accounting firms, an SEC resolution where you don’t admit or deny—that’s like a cost of doing business. Everybody understands that it’s not going to damage the business in the long run. But if we admit to doing something that’s a criminal offense for the Department of Justice, that’s going to have a real impact.” Let me tell you, that was probably the worst negotiating statement I’ve ever experienced.\n\nWe left the room and I looked at the prosecutors and said, “What the guy says is if you slap us on the wrist, we’ll be OK with it.” So we said we’re not going to do it. Then they started a huge letter-writing campaign and they’re trying to push back on our indicting them. It doesn’t work, so we indicted them.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd the White House keeps their fingers off.\n\nChertoff\n\nYes. In fact, at some point the President—because that may be where somebody in the White House was beginning to grumble a little bit. But then the President said something publicly, essentially making it clear that he approved, and that shut that all down. Now, we didn’t ask his permission.\n\nRiley\n\nSure, of course.\n\nChertoff\n\nHe was never—When it came to doing the right thing, or being tough, that never got any negative thing from the President.\n\nRiley\n\nHow often were you brought back into the White House to consult?\n\nChertoff\n\nI can’t say I was a regular denizen but I was probably—a couple of times a month or something like that.\n\nRiley\n\nWere these usually meetings with the President?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo. Usually meetings with people in the White House Counsel’s Office.\n\nRiley\n\nWith the Counsel’s Office.\n\nChertoff\n\nYes. Meetings with the President? I don’t know, maybe half a dozen.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd the Counsel at the time was?\n\nChertoff\n\nGonzales.\n\nRiley\n\nThese were primarily “War on Terror” talks?\n\nChertoff\n\nExclusively. We never discussed Enron or anything like that.\n\nRiley\n\nWho were the other members of the core team involved in these discussions?\n\nChertoff\n\nUsually people from OLC [Office of Legal Counsel], DoD [Department of Defense], CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] lawyers.\n\nRiley\n\nJohn Yoo.\n\nChertoff\n\nJohn Yoo, Pat [John Patrick] Philbin. I’d usually go in with my deputy, Alice Fisher, We usually had Scott Muller from the CIA, Jim [William James, II] Haynes from DoD.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd this was a global discussion?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo. There may have been other discussion, but I was involved—Normally it had to do with reporting on some development involving one of our cases.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat were the principal cases you were dealing with at this time?\n\nChertoff\n\nMostly Moussaoui, some on Lindh, and then there might have been something on [Richard] Reid when there were milestones.\n\nRiley\n\nCould you sort of track us through the Moussaoui case? Start at the beginning.\n\nChertoff\n\nShortly after 9/11, the U.S. attorney’s office in Boston, taking a bunch of documents and records, had put together a very compelling indictment that showed how there was a common funder named [Mustafa] al-Hawsawi who funded most of the 9/11 hijackers, but also funded Moussaoui’s trip. There was a commonality of either telephone numbers or money, that when you put it all together and created a timeline, you had a very strong circumstantial case against Moussaoui. That’s apart from anything he might have said or anything of that sort. Just if you looked at what he did, when he did it, who he connected with, you would have been able to convict him. We were pretty confident that no matter what happened, we had a good case against Moussaoui.\n\nSo once the President signed off on our taking it to the criminal as opposed to the military, we indicted him. We didn’t pull the best judge in the world, from our standpoint. Leonie Brinkema was a little too nervous as a judge, and too hesitant, but for us it was a road test: Can we successfully bring a case like this through the criminal justice system?\n\nRiley\n\nDo you remember when the indictment occurs?\n\nChertoff\n\nProbably December of 2001, January of 2002.\n\nRiley\n\nOK, that early.\n\nChertoff\n\nYes. I know we were approved in December, but whether it actually issued in December or early the next year, I don’t remember. You can look it up.\n\nRiley\n\nThe timeline on this would have followed a sort of normal timeline?\n\nChertoff\n\nHe was in custody for immigration, so he wasn’t going anywhere, so there was no rush.\n\nRiley\n\nAll right.\n\nChertoff\n\nBut along with my philosophy of not taking a lot of time, you want to get moving pretty briskly.\n\nRiley\n\nYou had just said that you saw this as sort of a test case, and that might have suggested that you wanted to expedite things.\n\nChertoff\n\nYes, but I think in general we would have expedited it.\n\nRiley\n\nOK, go ahead.\n\nChertoff\n\nI don’t remember the ins and outs of a case all the time, but you wind up with all kinds of litigation about discovery. What discovery is he entitled to get? What is he not entitled to get? That goes on for an extended period of time, and I leave before that gets fully resolved. Ultimately he pleads guilty and winds up going for sentencing.\n\nBrown\n\nWho was representing him?\n\nChertoff\n\nHe had public defenders. Edward MacMahon was one and there was another guy, too, whom he abused. He was a disruptive guy. He would abuse his own lawyers, he would abuse us, abuse the judge. He ultimately pled guilty and then went through the death penalty phase and I guess didn’t get the death penalty.\n\nRiley\n\nThe case spun out as you had hoped it would?\n\nChertoff\n\nHe was resistant at every stage. He’d file crazy motions. He’d want to fire his lawyers. He was committing guerrilla warfare against the court. That’s not an unknown thing; that happens in other cases too. Occasionally you get criminal defendants who decide they’re going to go to war with the system and they fight every step of the way. A good judge can manage that well. I would say Judge Brinkema was a middling judge and managed it imperfectly. Even so, in the end it navigated to a reasonably successful conclusion: He was convicted and he’s going to spend life in jail. And there were no significant problems from the standpoint of revealing classified material or having the guy being able to run around and interview Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and stuff like that. The judge shut that down. So I wouldn’t say it’s a model case, but with a difficult defendant and difficult set of circumstances and a first-time case, I think it worked out reasonably well.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat about the Lindh case?\n\nChertoff\n\nSame thing. Lindh was a little easier in the sense it was pretty straightforward. He was litigating various kinds of motions, but I don’t think any of them had a lot of merit. I forget who the judge in the case was.\n\nRiley\n\nWe can add it. [Thomas Selby Ellis, III]\n\nChertoff\n\nAnyway, he was good. In the end, they decided to plead guilty. Again, there were just a lot of discovery motions. He wanted to interview everybody in Guantanamo. So we decided, given the nature of the plea, and the fact that it was a headache, it was a good resolution to take the plea we took. Now there’s an urban legend that we took the plea to prevent him from revealing that he was tortured by the troops in Afghanistan. That, however, is false, because he actually filed a motion alleging that before we settled the case, so there was no gag order or restraint on him publicizing his allegations, which I don’t think were accurate. In any case, that’s just a myth. It’s not borne out by the timeline.\n\nRiley\n\nWere there any other cases that are historically important?\n\nChertoff\n\nReid was very quickly disposed of. He wasn’t going anywhere. He had a bomb in his shoe. There was no defense, so he pled guilty. And then we did the Lackawanna case, and there were a couple of cases up in the Northwest.\n\nRiley\n\nNo details of those have any…?\n\nChertoff\n\nNothing sticks out in my mind.\n\nRiley\n\nOK. You had mentioned Guantanamo earlier. Were you a part of the consultations about what to do with what they were collecting on the battlefield and what the legal status of Guantanamo was?\n\nChertoff\n\nSomewhat, in the sense that people in the Criminal Division participated in reviewing files of detainees, to offer an opinion about whether we thought they were safe to send back home or whether we thought they were too dangerous. So that process went on. It went on after I left, obviously, but it started when I was there.\n\nRiley\n\nBut the predicate about the legal status of Guantanamo—\n\nChertoff\n\nNo. That was decided by OLC. We were not part of that. We accepted that that’s where people were going to be kept, and it made sense and that was fine.\n\nBrown\n\nHow many people were detained originally? You said 700 something.\n\nChertoff\n\nIn the U.S. as part of our post-9/11—That initial wave was something like 750.\n\nBrown\n\nWhat proportion of those were you able to determine might have a plausible case to actually prosecute them?\n\nChertoff\n\nWith the exception of one person, everyone was either prosecuted for a criminal offense, or deported, or had an immigration thing. In terms of whether they were terrorists, there were probably a couple for whom we had some reasonable basis to believe they might have been involved in some stuff. I remember we looked at [Anwar] Awlaki for a while, but we didn’t really feel we had enough to pursue him. Obviously now, according to the newspapers, he’s come to justice in a different way. There was another guy named [Lotfi] Raissi, who we looked at. He left the country, though, before we could get him. Again, it was ambiguous issues, things to raise questions. In the end it didn’t generate terrorism prosecutions, but our general philosophy was that if there was another case to be made based on another crime, we’ll do that.\n\nBrown\n\nIf you could prosecute them on some other basis, you’d do that?\n\nChertoff\n\nRight. Everybody wound up either getting prosecuted—I guess the people held on material witness warrants probably got released when they had given their testimony, unless something came up and they were prosecuted. The people arrested on criminal cases were prosecuted, and the immigration violations were probably deported.\n\nBrown\n\nWhen somebody is detained—Can you go through what happens to them?\n\nChertoff\n\nI can’t generalize. First of all, they’re in the domain of the Marshals and the prison service and I’m not really visible into that. Generally what happens is at some point they get presented to a judge. If it’s immigration, it’s an immigration judge. If it’s a criminal case, it’s a federal judge. If it’s a criminal case they get a lawyer. Immigration, I’m not sure. They’re entitled to a lawyer but I don’t think they get a free one. Then they ask for bail and the judge says yea or nay. In these cases the judges pretty much always said nay, and then you go through the process. If it’s a criminal case, you get indicted and you either get tried or you plead guilty. If it’s an immigration case you get deported, or you appeal and fight it out in the Appellate Courts.\n\nBrown\n\nIn locating these 700 and some people, what kind of guidance did you give to your people as to—\n\nChertoff\n\nIt was mainly the FBI and it was done by basically tracking links. You go back and see where the 19 hijackers were. If they stayed someplace, you want to talk to the people in that place. If there’s something about their interaction with the hijackers that raises a question, and if you’ve got a legal basis to detain them, you’ll do it. The guys who sold the phony documents. There was a mosque in San Diego that some of them spent some time in. People involved in that, who might have had a lot of interaction with them or might have, for example, vouched for them or paid rent for them, would be people you would take a look at. Anybody who looked like they were part of the support network that enabled these guys to operate in the country for a period of months was somebody that you would take a hard look at.\n\nThere were a couple of folks who got on a train with box cutters, and they had a weird travel pattern. I think they went down to Texas. They wound up getting arrested. Anomalies like that, where people whose behavior in an aviation setting, for example, raised suspicion, would be arrested. It was always based on some articulable suspicion, whether it was a connection to the hijackers or some behavior that suggested a potential terrorist motivation.\n\nBrown\n\nWas some connection with al-Qaeda?\n\nChertoff\n\nI mean connection with a hijacker, like if you had someone who rented a room to two hijackers. I don’t know that I could say that was an al-Qaeda person, but you would certainly say, “Why would two hijackers—Why would someone pay for their rent?” There might be an innocent explanation but you’d be nuts if you didn’t ask the question of whether they knew there was something up, and they were supporting them in the United States. That would be an example of somebody about whom you would say, “If there is a basis to detain that person, we’d better do a better investigation.”\n\nBrown\n\nHow much of this came back to you?\n\nChertoff\n\nSome came to my level. We had other prosecutors working it, and there were a lot of FBI agents. Most of the actual fieldwork was done by the FBI. Some of it came to me. Most of it didn’t come to me, personally, but I was aware of the general program.\n\nRiley\n\nThe relationship with the FBI was good through this entire time?\n\nChertoff\n\nGreat.\n\nRiley\n\nWere there any tensions that you can recall? Are there usually tensions between the FBI and the Division?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo. Occasionally, but not that I experienced.\n\nRiley\n\nThe Criminal Division and the FBI are hand-in-glove?\n\nChertoff\n\nYes, and we worked very closely on this.\n\nDerthick\n\nWhat was the quality and quantity of press coverage in this phase of activity?\n\nChertoff\n\nI wasn’t reading the newspaper a lot, particularly in the first couple of months, because I would be in at six in the morning and leave around nine or ten at night, so I don’t know that I had a clear sense of the press coverage. I’m quite sure there was a lot of press coverage but I don’t have a real clear sense of it.\n\nRiley\n\nDid your wife manage OK?\n\nChertoff\n\nYes. Of course, we had the sniper. That was also something we had to deal with, and we tracked that too. I had middle school kids and one of them, in the first sniping thing, was with a bunch of other kids put in the coat closet because they thought there might be a risk at the school he was in.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nChertoff\n\nI remember taking my kids to their school bus, and you’d have to look around to see if there is a line of fire. People forget—You know, if you look at all that stuff together—9/11, anthrax and the sniper—It really began to look as if we were in a dangerous state of affairs unlike people have had in the United States maybe since the Civil War, where in the United States there were a lot of threats. So we were involved in that too.\n\nRiley\n\nHow many false alarms are you getting?\n\nChertoff\n\nYou get a lot of false alarms.\n\nRiley\n\nHow do you learn to read those out?\n\nChertoff\n\nAfter a period of time you get a feeling for what is likely to be a real threat and what’s likely not to be a real threat. The sniper was—That was a very high-profile serious thing that we spent a lot of time on.\n\nRiley\n\nIn Charlottesville—One of the incidents was in Fredericksburg so there was a concern that it might swing there.\n\nBrown\n\nThe Department of Justice gets involved in the issue of interrogation, and there are some key memos that are written. [Jay] Bybee’s memo, and John Yoo gets involved, at least in drafting it. Can you tell us a little bit about that?\n\nChertoff\n\nAt some point in the summer of 2002, the deputy asked me to go to a meeting—I think John Bellinger was there; some folks from the CIA, lawyers, John Yoo; DoD lawyers may have been there—to talk about this issue about interrogation. This not at Guantanamo; this is high-level targets. The question arose, would the Criminal Division somehow immunize in advance? I said, “No, can’t do that.” Subsequently, I was asked again about that and we actually did a little bit of research and I said, “No, can’t do that.”\n\nThen subsequently—and I don’t know when the memo was begun, and this is all public. It’s been discussed ad nauseum—John showed me a memo he was doing generally on the torture statute. The idea was for me to look, not at the statute itself, which requires a lot of research that was out of my domain, but to look at the issue of intent, under the general criminal law, and ask him from a practical standpoint as a prosecutor, “When you say something has to be willful, what does that really mean?” I said to him, “John, in law school, ‘willful’ means that even if you’re acting in bad faith or you didn’t know—If I hit you in the face and I say I don’t know that you’re going to bleed, I’m not willfully causing you to bleed.” I said, “In real life, I would not want to defend that case. When you look at willfulness, what you really have to say as a practical matter is that you have a good faith belief that what you’re doing doesn’t violate the law. And it’s got to be based on some reasonable set of facts. It can’t be based on just imaginary facts or wishful thinking. The more you can demonstrate that you’ve got a reasonable fact-based judgment that what you’re doing falls short of a violation of the law, the better off you are.” That was essentially my interaction with him on it.\n\nBrown\n\nThe so-called “torture memos,” Bybee and others, went through a whole detailed analysis of the various kinds of techniques that were being used.\n\nChertoff\n\nThere was one memo that I didn’t see, that got into specific things. That’s not what I was shown. The one I was shown was the general analysis of the statute. It was a long memo and it talked about cases in Northern Ireland and a lot of international law stuff, because there’s actually very little domestic case law on this. But that was not specific to particular techniques; that was general as to what the statute meant.\n\nBrown\n\nBut that famous memo in which they are indicating to the CIA people that things like waterboarding and so on—What would be the CIA interrogators’ future susceptibility to prosecution? I think that’s what the Attorney General’s Office was asked to comment on, was it not?\n\nChertoff\n\nI don’t know.\n\nBrown\n\nYou didn’t get involved in that?\n\nChertoff\n\nI didn’t get involved in that memo. I became aware of the fact that they were given permission to do certain techniques, or told that certain techniques would not violate the law. They were not given immunity or protection from prosecution. That was my decision and I didn’t do that. They were given a legal opinion about what would fall inside and what would fall outside.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat is the relationship with the OLC memo to the legal vulnerabilities on these things?\n\nChertoff\n\nYou know, it never came up with me, because we didn’t get to the point where we were faced with a prosecution, but essentially it should be something—Again, it’s a matter of good faith: If you in good faith rely upon it, it probably means you haven’t violated the law. If you’re acting in bad faith, that’s a different story. It’s not going to help you.\n\nRiley\n\nI guess what I’m partly interested in is the fact that you refused to issue—I don’t know the legal term of it.\n\nChertoff\n\nAn advance immunity.\n\nRiley\n\nDeclination to prosecute, or something like that, in advance.\n\nChertoff\n\nRight, in advance.\n\nRiley\n\nDoes that create a situation for greater legal vulnerabilities down the road?\n\nChertoff\n\nIt probably does in the sense that if you could do an advance declination, which you can’t do, so it’s a kind of a hypothetical discussion, then I guess that would eliminate the possibility of prosecution. The problem for them is there’s no such thing. Otherwise, I could just grab myself the immunity to violate the law, so you can’t do that.\n\nWhat you then have to do is look at the law and say, “Here’s what the line is”—and it’s normally an ambiguous line—and then you have to say, “In good faith, on a certain state of facts, am I inside the line or outside the line?” If you believe in good faith that you’re inside the line, you should be OK. Now does that mean someone won’t try to prosecute you? Evidently it doesn’t mean that. That’s one of the reasons why, over time, people in the government tend to get very conservative. As they get nervous about getting close to the line, they go further and further back from the line. The problem with that is that you sometimes have real operational sacrifices by doing that.\n\nRiley\n\nAnything else on that?\n\nBrown\n\nNo. There begins to be a public debate about these kinds of things going on.\n\nChertoff\n\nI’m gone by then.\n\nBrown\n\nYou’re gone by the time the public—\n\nChertoff\n\nYes. It was really Abu Ghraib, and that’s 2004.\n\nBrown\n\nIt opened it up, yes.\n\nChertoff\n\nI’m out of there by June of 2003.\n\nBrown\n\nBut within the Department of Justice, there was no real debate on these things?\n\nChertoff\n\nI don’t remember there being—I mean, I wouldn’t have been privy to it and it wasn’t really an issue. At one point I was made aware of the fact that someone had died in custody and I designated a prosecutor to work with the Inspector General to investigate that. So I was aware that there was an investigation going on, and we put a prosecutor on it, but I was gone before that came to fruition.\n\nRiley\n\nIn that particular case, is there anything more you can tell us about that?\n\nChertoff\n\nI don’t know whether it wound up being one of the cases they’re still looking at. It was a case where someone died in custody someplace.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nChertoff\n\nThe IG had opened a case and was looking at this and I assigned a prosecutor to it because they told me about it, which they had to do, the Agency. I said, “If you’re going to do stuff that is getting close to the line on interrogation, you had better be sure you are very disciplined about how to do it, because you do not want to have cowboys out there doing this kind of thing.”\n\nRiley\n\nAre you being approached by counsels in the Defense Department, or from the CIA, on these things?\n\nChertoff\n\nMostly the CIA. We had some interaction with the Defense Department, but mostly the CIA, and OLC. At some point we talked to DoD about the procedures for the military commissions. We gave them some advice. They were very slow in getting these cases moving, and the AG used to kind of needle [Donald H.] Rumsfeld. Colin Powell did too: “When are you going to start bringing these cases? No one’s getting any younger and it’s hurting you to have people sitting in there and there’s no process, and a year and a half has gone by.” There were a couple of people who were willing to plead guilty and we actually said, “We’re happy to show you guys how to set up a system where you can take the guilty plea, or at least be able to get some people through the process.” Rumsfeld was always pushing it off, to the AG’s frustration, because he felt, rightly, that the more time you took before processing people, the worse your legal position was going to be.\n\nPart of what the AG was about was defending these cases in court. And they started to lose some cases—again, more or less after I left—because the amount of time it was taking to process the cases meant the judge was starting to wonder, What’s going on here? Are you guys ever going to give any kind of process at all? So we were somewhat involved with DoD on that.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd they wanted to keep these cases.\n\nChertoff\n\nYes. The AG’s position was: Do something with them. Don’t just keep them if you cannot do anything with them.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you have a position? Would you have preferred to have taken these cases from them?\n\nChertoff\n\nYes, to get something moving. The basic idea was, you don’t have to give them a criminal trial, but you need to give them some kind of a process. You can’t just have them sit there for two years, and not move on anything.\n\nRiley\n\nCould the criminal justice system have handled these cases?\n\nChertoff\n\nProbably some of them would have been difficult to do, but some of these guys were willing to admit what they had done.\n\nRiley\n\nRight. But they would have been difficult on…?\n\nBrown\n\nProcess grounds?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo. Because they were in the battlefield, and the collection of evidence isn’t necessarily what you would have for admissible evidence in a courtroom. It’s mechanically difficult.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat about the security issue in courtrooms?\n\nChertoff\n\nI think if you got to that—If you were to bring people from Guantanamo into the U.S., you’d have a real security issue in the courtroom and in the neighborhood. Even when we did Moussaoui, there was a lot of security in the courtroom and there was security in the area. If you started to do a bunch of cases like that, it would probably be a real imposition on the people in the region.\n\nBrown\n\nIn the public discourse, editorials and so on—maybe it was already after you went over to Homeland Security—there was a lot of talk about the reasons why very few cases were brought into the criminal system, that why they needed to have the military was that some of the people who were suspected of being the most dangerous were subjected to kinds of interrogation that would not have allowed them to get into the criminal system.\n\nChertoff\n\nWell, for many of those cases, you wouldn’t need the fruit of the interrogation. You could just use other evidence, like with Moussaoui. With Moussaoui, we didn’t need anything he said, because we had a lot of circumstantial evidence. If you’re paid by the same guy who paid the hijackers; if you go through the same training; if you go through flight training and you’re not going to be hired by the airlines; if you have stuff on your computer about [Osama] bin Laden—it’s not going to be hard to convict you.\n\nI think a larger obstacle is people caught in the battlefield. It’s not like CSI: Miami, where you can collect all the trace evidence and that sometimes creates issues. Also, with some of these people, it’s not a question of trying them for crimes as much as it is just incapacitating them so they don’t go back to the battlefield. It’s like in World War II, when we had captured soldiers, we didn’t try them necessarily, but you don’t release them so they can go pick up a gun and start fighting again. In those cases, having a military process for detention makes sense if you’re going to get people in the battlefield. You don’t really want to bring them into a criminal court unless they’re U.S. citizens. However, you still have to do something. You’ve got to have some kind of a process. They didn’t process them very quickly and that created a legal disadvantage when the cases were litigated in court.\n\nRiley\n\nYou said you also had discussion with CIA counsel.\n\nChertoff\n\nWell, that was when they came in with someone who had died in custody, so we would have interaction with them.\n\nRiley\n\nRight, OK. What about rendition?\n\nChertoff\n\nNot involved in that. I mean, I was aware of it.\n\nRiley\n\nBut there was no corollary approach to you about legal vulnerabilities on the question of rendition?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo. Legal analysis was generally OLC. The only reason I got involved in this little issue on the one memo was, I was friendly with John because you wanted to get a sense from a prosecutor’s experience on the issue of intent, which is general. It’s not unique to the statute; it’s a general legal concept. How do prosecutors look at that? Academically, you might look at it and say, “Even if I’m unreasonable, as long as I don’t have a bad intent, I’m not guilty.” That’s technically true. In real life I would not want to argue that position in front of a jury, because the jury is going to look at you like you’re crazy. You’ve got to be able to say, “Look, it’s a reasonable position, and here’s why it’s reasonable.”\n\nRiley\n\nDid you find that the memo that proceeded from those discussions reflected your concerns?\n\nChertoff\n\nI think the passage on that to a degree reflected that advice.\n\nRiley\n\nOK. Why don’t we take a break for a couple of minutes?\n\n[BREAK]\n\nM. Chertoff, 1/31/12 31\n\nChertoff\n\nThat’s where maybe personality comes in. I’d say that, without the experience, you’d be reckless if you just went ahead, but without the personality, no amount of experience is going to give you the confidence to make decisions. I would say this: Probably a combination of personality and the experience taught me how to make decisions based on less than perfect information and in a reasonable time frame, because you never get perfect information. Not to decide is to decide as well. It’s decision by default.\n\nRiley\n\nYou’d leave. Why did you leave?\n\nChertoff\n\nFor a few months, the White House Counsel’s Office had said, “There’s a judgeship open on the Third Circuit.” Would I be interested in doing it? I said, “Well, I figure I’m too valuable here.” At some point they said to me, “Look, we’ve kind of been holding this, but honestly if you’re not going to accept it, we’re going to give it to somebody else.” I went home and said to my wife, “You know, I’ve done this for two years. Maybe instead of thinking about the next year, we ought to think about the rest of our lives.” We decided it was the right thing to do and so I did it.\n\nRiley\n\nHad you wanted to be a judge before?\n\nChertoff\n\nIt’s one of the things I always thought I wanted to do, and I enjoyed it.\n\nRiley\n\nBut you didn’t do it very long.\n\nChertoff\n\nCorrect.\n\nRiley\n\nThat’s a puzzle to some of us.\n\nChertoff\n\nIt’s a life tenure job; it’s not a life sentence. When the request came to consider becoming a Cabinet Secretary in an area that I cared about, which is security, because of 9/11, it’s kind of hard to say no to that.\n\nRiley\n\nTell us about the circumstances of being approached, and the decision making.\n\nChertoff\n\n[Bernard] Kerik had been nominated, or maybe not nominated but he’d been selected. Then he fell out of it and I remember saying to my wife—we went on vacation that year to the Virgin Islands—“I wonder who they’re going to pick for Kerik’s replacement?” We get back right after the New Year, I’m sitting in my office chambers, and I get a call from the White House Personnel Office. They had called me once previously the year before, about whether I would be willing to be considered to be Deputy AG when that fell vacant, and I said no.\n\nSo I get a call: Would I be willing to be considered to be Secretary of Homeland Security? I said, “Well, it’s hard to say no to that. Let me talk to my wife and I’ll get back to you.” I called her up and said, “It’s kind of hard to say no to this. Why don’t I at least raise the issue? It probably won’t happen.” Meryl [Chertoff] said, “Oh, it’s probably going to happen, so you’d better be sure you want to do it.”\n\nI call back the next day, which I think was a Thursday, and I said, “OK, I’d be willing to be considered and if Andy Card”—who was the Chief—“wants to talk to me, I’ve got a judicial sitting next week, but I’ll be happy to come down after that’s over.” They said, “No, we’d like you to come today.” I said, “I really can’t come today because, first of all, I’m not really dressed.” They said, “Well, come tomorrow morning.”\n\nI said OK, and I went down Friday morning and met with Dina Powell and Andy Card, and talked about the job and some general expectations. The President was away. They said, “The President would like to meet with you.” I said, “Fine, but I do think I need to tell my kids first, to make sure they don’t go ballistic, before I actually say yes, so let me go back.”\n\nI’m on the train going back home on Friday and I get a call just as we were leaving Philly to go up to Newark and they said, “Could you come and meet the President now? He’s just come back and he wants to see you.” I said, “First of all, I don’t think I could physically get back there today. Second, I’d like to talk to my kids.” They said, “Hang on,” and they went and talked to the President, and came back and said, “OK, how about tomorrow morning?” I said fine. I go home and talk to the kids. We decide I’m going to go do this. I’m going to say, “Yes, I’m willing to do it.”\n\nI flew in the next morning really early and met with the President for about a half an hour, 40 minutes. He knew me from being head of Criminal, so it wasn’t my first rodeo, so to speak. Then I went back and they basically said, “He’s going to make his mind up very quickly.” The next day, which was Sunday, I’m at home, the phone rings and it’s the President. He says, “I’d like to offer you the position.” I said, “I’d be honored to accept.” I went down Tuesday and we announced it. That was it.\n\nRiley\n\nYou said it would be hard to turn down. Why is that?\n\nChertoff\n\nBecause it’s something I cared deeply about, which was security, and it is the President asking you to do something. And, you know, being a Cabinet Officer is a pretty unique privilege.\n\nBrown\n\nBut in the prior conversation with the President, you said it took about a half hour or so.\n\nChertoff\n\nAbout 40 minutes.\n\nBrown\n\nWhat went on in that conversation?\n\nChertoff\n\nDiscussion about the job and my views on various things.\n\nDerthick\n\nHow old were your kids? Is this a matter of protocol, or they’re going to exercise some sort of judgment?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo. I wasn’t going to let the kids decide, but you kind of feel like—\n\nDerthick\n\nYou should.\n\nChertoff\n\nYes. You ought to hear them out before you say yes or no.\n\nRiley\n\nIt’s possible they could have said something that caused you to change your mind?\n\nChertoff\n\nIt’s hard to imagine what that would have been, but yes, it is possible.\n\nRiley\n\nProbably a direct no wouldn’t have done it.\n\nChertoff\n\nIf they became unhinged, maybe you’d have to think twice about it. The good news is it worked out really great for them. They were happy. They got into a good school and everything worked out terrific.\n\nRiley\n\nBut leaving the bench for you was not a traumatic experience?\n\nChertoff\n\nIt wasn’t traumatic. I liked it, but when an opportunity presents itself that’s unique—Again, this is an area I cared a lot about, because I lived through the whole 9/11 business.\n\nRiley\n\nIn your discussions with the President, was there a kind of agenda-setting, or were there priorities discussed?\n\nChertoff\n\nI think he was concerned about making sure—It was a new Department. It was less than two years old.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nChertoff\n\nHe was very concerned about making sure that it was integrated properly and efficiently, and matured.\n\nBrown\n\nWas there a sense in your discussion with the President that this would be a very difficult Department to manage?\n\nChertoff\n\nYes.\n\nBrown\n\nSo many things were thrown in, and some things were left out.\n\nChertoff\n\nI think there was recognition that it was going to be a real challenge.\n\nRiley\n\nDid that concern you, the size of the job?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo, not really. I knew what I was getting into.\n\nDerthick\n\nYou probably don’t want to talk about what the President said about it, but did the subject of whether you would have freedom in picking your own subordinates come up?\n\nChertoff\n\nIt actually didn’t, and that’s probably my mistake. But as it turned out, I think that maybe Andy Card had recommended Michael Jackson as a deputy, but it was always made very clear to me that no one was going to force anybody on me. Michael came on board. I interviewed him, I was happy with him, we had a good relationship, and that worked out really well. Then for some of the other positions over time, we would actually recommend people to the White House, and they generally took the attitude that, unless the person had been vociferously anti-Bush in 2004, they gave us a pretty free hand. In fact, I might have appointed a couple of Democrats. The White House was very hands-off on personnel. They did not mess with our personnel very much.\n\nThat whole thing about having people pick—That never was a problem with us. I’m saying it because I’ve heard it often enough from people complaining historically, and just from books, that they didn’t control their own subordinates. That never happened. The President was very respectful of the Cabinet Officers.\n\nBrown\n\nDid anybody at that time—friends, colleagues, and so on—say, “You don’t want that position. This is an impossible job”?\n\nChertoff\n\nMy wife might have said something like that.\n\nRiley\n\nNot your kids though.\n\nChertoff\n\nThere weren’t a lot of people I talked to. It was just very closely held, so I don’t know that there was very much conversation with other people about it.\n\nRiley\n\nHow much of your job at the Justice Department involved management?\n\nChertoff\n\nNot a lot of people, but it did involve making decisions, learning about things, setting agendas, and driving things to conclusion. I wind up thinking at the end of the day that it’s pretty good preparation for running a large enterprise.\n\nRiley\n\nThat’s the fundamental question, looking through your CV [curriculum vitae].\n\nChertoff\n\nIt turns out that if you’re able to assimilate facts quickly, listen to people, and decide things, you could pretty much manage anything. The actual nuts and bolts of knowing every detail—First of all, no one could know every detail of the Department because there are too many different dimensions to it, but the qualities that I’ve outlined are pretty much what you need.\n\nRiley\n\nHow did you go about educating yourself for the job?\n\nChertoff\n\nSome of what the Department did I knew about because I knew the law enforcement side and the intelligence side. The stuff that I had to learn was the immigration piece, although I had a little bit of experience with that as a judge. The Coast Guard’s mission and roles—you just pick that up over a period of time. When I came onboard we did a review, a second-stage review, which was designed to look at where the Department was and where we wanted to make changes.\n\nThe one thing I saw early on was—We did an exercise in the summer of 2005 called TOPOFF [Top Officials Exercise], which was an exercise with a scenario involving biological weapons, in Northern New Jersey and Connecticut and New York, and it became evident to me that the planning for scenarios was not well developed and that people hadn’t really thought through a lot of what they would do in those circumstances. As a consequence, we began the process of trying to build and mature the planning capability in DHS, which was really a four-year project. Then, again proving the history I have of starting a job and within a few months a catastrophe happens, we had Katrina, and that illustrated the lack of a planning capability and accelerated that process.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat else in terms of personnel? You mentioned the White House—you hadn’t insisted on any independence there.\n\nChertoff\n\nRight, but they pretty much gave it.\n\nRiley\n\nRight. But you ended up with the people that you wanted.\n\nChertoff\n\nOver time. First of all, we eliminated some positions when people left, to condense the Department, to kind of flatten it. Then, when people left of their own accord, except in one case, we had a pretty free hand in picking people. When Rob Bonner left as head of Customs and Border Protection, we had the head of Secret Service, Ralph Basham, moved over to that. He was a professional law enforcement guy. We were able to fill the positions with people that we liked.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd they all worked out well?\n\nChertoff\n\nYes, actually they did.\n\nRiley\n\nYou said, “with one exception.”\n\nChertoff\n\nMichael Brown. He didn’t leave of his own accord. He was fired, basically.\n\nDerthick\n\nAbout Brown, and this is maybe getting a little ahead, but the President’s book quoted you as saying that after, I forget how many days, you had lost confidence in Brown. I wondered if you ever had confidence in him.\n\nChertoff\n\nNo, I didn’t. Here’s the story: We knew he was a problem when we did the second-stage review, which finished up in July or August. We knew he was going to be a problem. The difficulty was, we were going into hurricane season and his deputy was really inexperienced. He had been like an advance man. So we said to ourselves, if we fire the guy now, the guy who is underneath him is really going to be incompetent. Brown had apparently done a good job in 2004, with the hurricanes he had then, so we figured—I think he saw the handwriting on the wall and basically signaled he was going to leave at the end of the year. So we figure we’ll run the course of hurricane season, hopefully he’ll do a competent job like he did last year, and then we’ll transition out. It was like playing musical chairs but the music stopped. Yes, we knew he was not somebody we wanted to keep on, but we ran out of time.\n\nRiley\n\nI know Martha has got a lot of questions about Katrina, but a couple of preliminaries: The second-stage review was something that you instituted?\n\nChertoff\n\nYes, we instituted it.\n\nRiley\n\nWas that done at the recommendation of the White House?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo. Michael Jackson suggested it and I thought it was a good idea, as we were taking stock and also giving us an opportunity to retool.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd the collapsing of the organization, that was something that was consistent with the second stage?\n\nChertoff\n\nYes, but also I felt there were a couple of layers that we didn’t need. Generally, when I managed either at DOJ [Department of Justice] or as the U.S. attorney or in DHS, I didn’t like to have a gatekeeper. I like to deal directly with the operational component heads and not have layers between them, so we eliminated a layer at DHS.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd there was no pushback from—\n\nChertoff\n\nNo, because it was vacant. The person had left. There was no incumbent so it was not a problem.\n\nRiley\n\nAll right. And the second-stage review is completed before Katrina?\n\nChertoff\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nSix weeks, or something like that. Did it produce what you thought it would produce?\n\nChertoff\n\nIt produced a good roadmap. The problem is, we didn’t get very far down the road. Ultimately it wound up getting implemented largely, including the planning piece and all that. Katrina also resulted in a bit of a reorganization by Congress, so it got kind of swept up in all of that.\n\nRiley\n\nWere there things that were excluded from the review that you had anticipated you might want to include?\n\nChertoff\n\nNo.\n\nRiley\n\nFrom your own sense of order and logic, was DHS a logical institutional when you came in?\n\nChertoff\n\nI think it was logical. You could argue about whether FBI and DEA [Drug Enforcement Agency] ought to have been in it too, on the fear that you get all the police agencies together. Politically, that would never have happened. But I thought it was pretty logical.\n\nRiley\n\nThis is a sort of global question: From your perspective, is it a manageable organization?\n\nChertoff\n\nYes. In fact, in many ways it’s more manageable than a lot of agencies. Once we got it matured to a certain point, we created more jointness in planning and in operations and even in personnel. It was pretty efficient. In some ways, some of the problems you put up with in more mature departments where people are very entrenched and fight back against change—One of the benefits of having disrupted everybody is no one was entrenched, so we had a certain amount of flexibility. You could argue that in some ways what you get now is made over in the image of the people who were involved in it during my tenure, and our particular styles of management may be part of the DNA of the Department, but from our standpoint it worked out pretty well.\n\nRiley\n\nWere there important modifications in organization? I’m just looking at my timeline here.\n\nChertoff\n\nWe eliminated a layer, basically Border and Transportation Security, and so you had direct reports from CBP [Customs and Boarder Protection], TSA [Transportation Security Administration], right up to the Secretary and the deputy. That was the major organizational change.\n\nThen we created a directorate—maybe directorate is the wrong word—of planning and operations, which was a growth out of the integration staff that Tom [Ridge] had set up, that was meant to integrate all the planning among all the components, and be able to help manage operationally across the Department and with other agencies. Roger Rufe was the guy we put in charge of that.\n\nRiley\n\nAgain, let’s deal with the pre-Katrina period and we’ll get into that in just a second. How were your relations with the White House staff after you moved into the Cabinet?\n\nChertoff\n\nI’ll give you a timeline over the entire period. When I came in, Tom said to me, “You know, the White House staff is really all over the Department because they feel it’s not mature.” I think that was true. Over a period of time, that lessened and there was less of what Mike Jackson used to call pushups and reporting, and it diminished over time. Probably by 2007–2008, there was not a lot of heavy supervision. But the first year there was quite a bit of supervision.\n\nRiley\n\nIn your original conversation with the President, did he provide to you a kind of assessment about how well the department was working before you came on board?\n\nChertoff\n\nHe said that it was a work in progress and needed to continue to progress.\n\nRiley\n\nOK. How are you different from Tom Ridge?\n\nChertoff\n\nTom, because he has a political background, probably was more attuned initially to the public face of the job. I was more attuned to law enforcement and intelligence—I mean the intelligence agency dimension to the job—and maybe more operational and a little more inclined to get into the detail.\n\nBrown\n\nBack to the logic again, and maybe this is too abstract and academic a question, but Homeland Security is of course one of the primary objectives of the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency. You have some anomalies here: the Coast Guard is under your jurisdiction.\n\nChertoff\n\nWell, it actually makes a lot of sense if you think about this way: DoD is largely, but not exclusively, away. We don’t really have DoD operating in the U.S. unless you’re literally fighting a war in the U.S. Exceptions are air cover "
