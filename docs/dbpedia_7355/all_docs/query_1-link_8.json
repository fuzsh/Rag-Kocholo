        "text": "KWAME HOLMAN:\n\nChertoff is well-known to most senators. He was the Republicans' special counsel during the Senate's Whitewater investigation of President Clinton. He's a former federal prosecutor, and ran the Justice Department's criminal division during the first few years of the Bush administration.\n\nTwo years ago, the president gave him a lifetime judicial appointment on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nMICHAEL CHERTOFF:\n\nThe call to serve in helping to protect America was the one call I could not decline. And I have to say, since having begun the process with the announcement by the president of his intent to nominate me, I have been privileged as I travel back and forth from home to Washington, to have people come up to me and express how much they care about the work of the Department and how important it is to them.\n\nI think they have a sense of ownership unlike any I've ever experienced, and that has redoubled my sense that it was right for me, if I can add value and make a contribution, to put my personal considerations aside and to accept this challenge.\n\nMICHAEL CHERTOFF:\n\nWell, I think what I've observed certainly as a citizen over the years my own experience has been that the driver's license has become in many respects the standard identifying document. In fact, I remember trying to get into — I won't even mention the agencies, but certain buildings using my credentials and people saying, \"No, I want to see your driver's license instead.\"\n\nThat suggests that the reality is at a minimum we need to make sure that driver's licenses are reliable. There's no, it seems to me, argument in having unreliable licenses. I certainly look forward to working on that. As to the larger issue, because I know it's complicated, it's something I'd certainly want to study and consider very carefully.\n\nMICHAEL CHERTOFF:\n\nAnd I agree with you, Senator. This is an area where we can't use a cookie cutter. Every state is different. I mean, there are geographic issues, as you point out, that certainly cry out as a matter of common sense for treatment that's different from treating two cities that are, you know, 500 miles apart.\n\nI don't know why we — why the Department sometimes misses that. As I said, people make mistakes. What I do want to put into place is a strong system of feedback so that before we reach a final decision, if we're doing something silly, we hear about it.\n\nMICHAEL CHERTOFF:\n\nI do agree that this is an area of potential significant risk. And I think we need to be able, the federal government needs to be able to use a whole range of tools to bring the industry up to an appropriate standard. At a minimum, we have to give them — and I know there are surveys and guidance that we can give them of things they can do on their own.\n\nI think there are incentives we ought to consider, including working with the insurance industry. My experience with Y2K was a lot of industry woke up when the insurance people started to talk about what they were prepared to insure or not insure.\n\nBut also I understand the president has indicated that he supports, if necessary, the use of authorities to require chemical companies to come up to certain standards with appropriate penalties if they don't do so. I think the president has indicated that that kind of approach, if necessary, would be appropriate to make sure our chemical plants are safe.\n\nKWAME HOLMAN:\n\nThere were sharp questions from Michigan's Carl Levin, centering on Chertoff's years at the Justice Department and his role in forming Bush administration policy on the use of torture to interrogate suspected foreign terrorists.\n\nChertoff responded by stating torture is illegal, and that his input was limited to giving this advice: That whatever the action, be sure it falls well within the law. Chertoff is expected to be confirmed by the full Senate next week."
