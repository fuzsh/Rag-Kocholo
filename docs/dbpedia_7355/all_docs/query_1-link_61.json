        "text": "WASHINGTON, August 16, 2022 — The Chertoff Group, a global security advisory firm that enables clients to navigate changes in security risk, technology, and policy, today announced the appointment of Jerome Pickett and John Taflan to its team of respected Senior Advisors. Both had established careers holding high-ranking positions in the U.S. government and were instrumental in national security operations. Their experience and expertise will further enable The Chertoff Group to meet the diverse needs of its clients.\n\n“We are excited to bring both Jerome Pickett and John Taflan on board as Senior Advisors,” said Michael Chertoff, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman of The Chertoff Group. “Our clients will benefit from their strategic perspective, cultivated over decades of impactful government and private sector risk management and leadership experience.”\n\nJerome Pickett began his career as a Special Agent with the United States Secret Service (USSS) focusing on global investigations related to abuses of technology to include computer fraud, network intrusion, identity theft, and terrorism. During his 17-year career with USSS Pickett participated in search and rescue operations at Ground Zero and investigated the terrorists involved in the attack. He also served on the Presidential Protective Details for Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Following his government career, Pickett served as Executive Vice President and Chief Security Officer for the National Basketball Association where he led all aspects of the league’s global security operations. He furthered his career in security by joining CLEAR, a secure identity company, as SVP and General Manager of their sports and entertainment business.\n\n“I am thrilled to join The Chertoff Group working alongside some of the brightest industry experts to help companies level-up, manage risk and innovate.” said Pickett. “I will continue to partner with companies bringing to bear the full breadth of my experiences in government, corporate security and tech.”\n\nJohn Taflan joins The Chertoff Group following a distinguished twenty-year career at the National Security Agency (NSA). While at NSA, he held a variety of senior roles, most recently serving on the NSA’s Governing Board of Directors, overseeing support activities including security and counterintelligence, installations and facilities management, and global logistics. He also served as the NSA’s Chief of Global Installations, Facilities, and Logistics, where he designed and oversaw the construction of the NSA’s Integrated Cyber Center and its multi-billion-dollar campus at Fort Meade. Prior to his career at the NSA, Taflan was the Director of Human Resource Administration at The Ohio State University. Taflan is also a retired U.S. Army Officer.\n\n“I have followed the work of The Chertoff Group since the beginning and have continually been impressed by the impact their incredibly talented workforce has made on national security,” said Taflan. “I hope to bring the expertise I developed in the Army and the National Security Agency to help advance the mission of this great firm.”"
