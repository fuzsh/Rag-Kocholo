MAURICE HICKS, JR., OF LOUISIANA, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA; AND WILLIAM EMIL MOSCHELLA, OF VIRGINIA, NOMINEE TO BE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ---------- WEDNESDAY, APRIL 30, 2003 United States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:09 a.m., in room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Orrin G. Hatch, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Hatch, Leahy, Kennedy, Feingold, Schumer, and Durbin. Chairman Hatch. Good morning. I am happy to welcome to the Committee four outstanding nominees. We will consider three judicial nominees: John Roberts for the District of Columbia Circuit; David Campbell for the District of Arizona; and Maury Hicks for the Western District of Louisiana. We will also hear from Will Moschella, who has been nominated to be Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legislative Affairs at the Department of Justice. Now, I think if it is all right with you, Senator Leahy, why don't we defer our statements until our colleagues testify so we can save them time. I apologize for being just a little bit late, but I just couldn't get through with the meetings in my office this morning. Senator Leahy. Especially with such a distinguished trio, of course, we should do that. Chairman Hatch. Well, all right. I think if we can, then, why don't we turn to Senator Warner first, then Senator Breaux, and then Hon. Jim McCrery. We welcome you here as well. We welcome all three of you and appreciate having you here. Senator Warner? PRESENTATION OF WILLIAM EMIL MOSCHELLA, NOMINEE TO BE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, AND JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR., NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, BY HON. JOHN WARNER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VIRGINIA Senator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, on behalf of my distinguished colleague, George Allen, I will ask that the record accept his statement. he is unavoidably detained this morning. Chairman Hatch. Without objection. Senator Warner. So I shall proceed on behalf of both of us in expressing my privilege to be here to introduce William Moschella, who has been nominated to serve as Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs at the Justice Department. He is joined today by his lovely family, including his wife Amy, his daughter Emily, his son Matthew, and his parents. They are right in the front row. If you all would stand and be recognized? Now is your chance. There we are. Chairman Hatch. Well, we welcome all of you. We welcome you all, and we are grateful to have you here. Senator Warner. This candidate's distinguished background makes him highly qualified, I say to our distinguished Chairman and distinguished ranking member, to be in this position. Subsequent to earning his law degree from George Mason University Law School, he served as a legislative assistant in the office of my fellow delegation colleague, Congressman Frank Wolf. After leaving the Congressman's office, he held positions in the House Government Reform Committee, House Rules Committee, and several positions in the House Judiciary Committee. At present, he serves as chief legislative counsel for the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. Chairman, he is obviously a very accomplished individual, and he served a large portion of his career in public service, well qualified I am certain; therefore, he will serve in this position with distinction, reflecting credit upon our President and this institution, the Congress which he has served these many years. Now, Mr. Chairman, I should like to say a few words on behalf of Mr. Roberts. This is my second appearance on behalf of this distinguished individual, and I must say in my 25 years in the Senate, I do not believe I have ever done this before. But at the invitation of the Chair, I will appear over and over again, be it necessary, on behalf of this individual because I personally and, if I may say, professionally feel very strongly about this nominee. He has been nominated for a position on the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. If I may say, following my graduation from the University of Virginia Law School in 1953, I return this weekend for my 50th reunion, where I am privileged to address my class. But following that, I was privileged to be a law clerk to Judge E. Barrett Prettyman on the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, the very circuit to which this nominee has been appointed by the President of the United States. I have a strong knowledge of this circuit, having started my career there 48 years ago, and I feel that this candidate will measure up in every respect to the distinguished members of the circuit that have served in the past and who are serving today. And I urge in the strongest of terms that he be given fair consideration by this Committee and that he will be voted out favorably. Mr. Chairman and Senator Leahy, we start with he graduated from Harvard College summa cum laude in 1976. Three years later, he graduated from Harvard Law School magna cum laude, where he served as managing editor of the Harvard Law Review. He served as law clerk to Judge Friendly on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and worked as law clerk to the current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, Hon. Judge Rehnquist. Also, he has practiced law for over 20 years. He served as associate counsel to President Ronald Reagan, worked as the Principal Deputy Solicitor General of the United States, and has worked as a civil litigator in the firm of Hogan and Hartson, which, I must say, I also served in following my clerkship with Judge Prettyman. So I do urge upon this Committee, Mr. Chairman, and all members, that the fair consideration that is the duty of the United States Senate under the Constitution under the advise and consent provisions be exercised on behalf of this distinguished nominee. I thank you for the attention of the Committee, and I wish you well. Chairman Hatch. Thank you so much, Senator Warner. We appreciate those very strong recommendations. Senator Leahy. I was impressed, the 50th reunion, so you graduated at the age of 10? Senator Warner. I beg your pardon? Senator Leahy. You graduated at the age of 10? I was very impressed, your 50th reunion. Senator Warner. No, I was not a child prodigy. [Laughter.] Senator Warner. Nor am I a senior prodigy. I am just one of your fellow Senators. Senator Leahy. And a good friend and highly respected on both sides of the aisle, I might add. Senator Warner. I thank you. Chairman Hatch. We are grateful to have you here, Senator Warner. We appreciate that. Senator Breaux? We will turn to you, Senator Breaux. PRESENTATION OF S. MAURICE HICKS, JR., NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA, BY HON. JOHN BREAUX, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF LOUISIANA Senator Breaux. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Senator Leahy and Senator Durbin. A tough act to follow our colleague from Virginia. I am here on behalf of and to speak for Maury Hicks, our friend from Shreveport, Louisiana, who has been nominated to be the district judge for the Western District of Louisiana, which is the Shreveport area and the area south of that area. I am joined in spirit by my colleague Senator Mary Landrieu, who will have a statement of support on behalf of Maury Hicks as well. He is the type of person that I think we can recommend without hesitation. I have always felt that at the district level I would personally rather see a person who is not an author or a scholar or a professor of law in some university but, rather, someone who comes from the day-to-day activities of being a trial lawyer in the area, in the district in which we are nominating them to become a Federal district judge. And that is what we have in Maury Hicks, a person who knows the people as well as knowing the law. He graduated from Texas Christian university but he later redeemed himself from that mistake by graduating from the LSU Law School, and I think that will overcome any Texas problems that he might have experienced. [Laughter.] Senator Breaux. But he has been engaged in the practice of law, like I said, dealing with all types of problems--local problems that go before both the State courts and the Federal courts--since 1977. That is the type of people I think do good jobs on the Federal district bench. They know the law, but they also know the people, and I think he brings that talent. You might have noted that on the list as one of his organizations is the Mystic Crew of Louisiana. I would just point out to Senator Durbin and to others that might wonder if that is some subterranean terrorist organization from the State of Louisiana, it indeed is not. It is the organization that runs the Mardi Gras celebrations here in Washington for the last 50 years. I happen to serve as captain of the crew, which means Maury Hicks is part of our organization that runs the Mardi Gras. It is a wonderful organization that does great things and has a lot of fun doing it. He is joined here by his wife, Glynda, and their children, who I am sure he will be introducing later. He is a good choice. I hope that you can vote him out as quickly as we possibly can. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Hatch. Thank you, Senator Breaux. We appreciate your comments, and we really appreciate you taking time to come. I think it is an honor to the people that you have recommended. Thank you. We will be happy to let you go. We know you have-- Senator Breaux. I want to hear if he is for him, too. Chairman Hatch. Well, Congressman McCrery, we are honored to have you here. We look forward to taking your testimony. PRESENTATION OF S. MAURICE HICKS, JR., NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA, BY HON. JIM MCCRERY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF LOUISIANA Representative McCrery. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Leahy, my old friend from the House Senator Durbin. It is nice to be here with you today. I certainly want to second the comments of my friend and colleague from Louisiana, Senator Breaux. I have known Maury Hicks since Maury was a freshman in law school at LSU and have watched him practice law in my home town of Shreveport for a number of years. And I can tell you without reservation that Maury Hicks is a very well respected member of the bar in Shreveport. He has extensive experience at the bar in court. He is an accomplished litigator. He has with him today his family: his wife Glynda, his children Christy and Tyler. He also has with him some friends from the Shreveport area, and just to show you how well respected Maury is in the bar in Shreveport, he brought with him both defense attorneys and plaintiffs' attorneys, and they are all for him. So I think that will tell you how well respected Maury Hicks is. Maury is smart. He is honest. He is a hard worker. He is everything I think we want in a Federal district judge. He will be welcomed by the bar in the Western District because I know that Maury will be the kind of judge that lawyers in any part of our country would appreciate. He will work hard. He will get the job done. He will be fair. And so I recommend without hesitation Maury Hicks as the next Federal judge from the Western District of Louisiana. Chairman Hatch. Well, thank you, Congressman. We appreciate that. Mr. Hicks certainly has to be very pleased to have both of you come and testify for him. Thank you for being here. We appreciate it. Representative McCrery. Thank you. Senator Breaux. Thank you. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN G. HATCH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH Chairman Hatch. We will make our statements now. Let me say a few words about our first nominee, John Roberts, who has quite a history as a judicial nominee. He was originally nominated for a seat on the D.C. Circuit more than 11 years ago by the first President Bush, but was never given a hearing and was never confirmed. He was renominated by the current President Bush on May 9, 2001, but he did not receive a hearing in the 107th Congress. He was then renominated for the third time this past January, and all told, he has been nominated by two different Presidents on three separate occasions for the Federal appellate bench over the last 12 years. The Committee finally held a hearing on Mr. Roberts' nomination on January 29th of this year, and during that marathon hearing, which started at 9:30 a.m. and did not end until approximately 9:30 that night, he answered every question that he was asked in a precise and informative manner. He also answered a myriad written questions submitted to him after the hearing--more than 70, to be precise. The Committee favorably reported his nomination for consideration by the full Senate with bipartisan support. All ten Republican Members of the Committee voted for Mr. Roberts, along with four Democratic Members. However, pursuant to an agreement between the Republican and Democratic Senate leadership, I have asked Mr. Roberts to return for this hearing with the clear understanding that his nomination will move to the Senate floor for an up or down vote without undue delay. In fact, our agreement was within a week after we finally move you out of Committee. Now, this means that, pursuant to our agreement, the Committee will vote on Mr. Roberts' nomination a week from tomorrow, which is Thursday--you will be put on tomorrow's markup, but literally I am putting you over until next Thursday so our colleagues will have enough time to submit any written questions they desire. Any written questions should accordingly be submitted to Mr. Roberts and the other nominees no later than 5:00 p.m. on Friday, May 2nd. Now, Mr. Roberts is widely considered to be one of the premier appellate litigators of his generation. His legal accomplishments are superb, including a remarkable 29 arguments before the United States Supreme Court. His record leaves no doubt that he is mainstream and fair. During the course of his career, he has argued both sides of the same issue in different cases, demonstrating that he is indeed a lawyer's lawyer. He has also represented parties from all sides of the political spectrum. His clients have included large and small corporations, trade organizations, non-profit organizations, States, and individuals. So it is really an honor to have such a remarkable legal mind before this Committee. Senator Warner did comment about some of Mr. Roberts' legal background. No question he had great academic credentials at Harvard College and later Harvard Law School. He served as law clerk for Second Circuit Judge Henry Friendly, one of the pillars of judicial matters throughout many years, and then for Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist. His public service career included tenure as special assistant to Attorney General William French Smith, Associate White House Counsel, and Principal Deputy Solicitor General. Since 1993, he has been a partner with the prestigious D.C. law firm of Hogan and Hartson, where his practice has focused on Federal appellate litigation. Now, there is no question that Mr. Roberts has the experience and intelligence to be an outstanding Federal appellate judge. And if the support for his nomination from his peers is any indication, he also has the requisite judicial temperament and unbiased fairness that are the hallmarks of truly great judges. One letter the Committee received is from 156 members of the D.C. Bar, all of whom urge Mr. Roberts' swift confirmation. The letter is signed by such legal luminaries as Lloyd Cutler, who was White House Counsel to both President Carter and President Clinton; Boyden Gray, who was White House Counsel to the first President Bush; and Seth Waxman, who was President Clinton's Solicitor General. The letter states: ``Although, as individuals, we reflect a wide spectrum of political party affiliation and ideology, we are united in our belief that John Roberts will be an outstanding Federal court of appeals judge and should be confirmed by the United States Senate. He is one of the very best and most highly respected appellate lawyers in the Nation, with a deserved reputation as a brilliant writer and oral advocate. He is also a wonderful professional colleague both because of his enormous skills and because of his unquestioned integrity and fair-mindedness. In short, John Roberts represents the best of the bar and, we have no doubt, would be a superb Federal court of appeals judge.'' Another letter is from 13 of Mr. Roberts' former colleagues at the Solicitor General's Office. This letter states: ``Although we are of diverse political parties and persuasions, each of us is firmly convinced that Mr. Roberts would be a truly superb addition to the Federal court of appeals. . . .Mr. Roberts was attentive and respectful of all views, and he represented the United States zealously but fairly. He had the deepest respect for legal principles and legal precedent-- instincts that will serve him well as a court of appeals judge.'' Now, others echo these sentiments. Clinton Solicitor General Seth Waxman called Mr. Roberts an ``exceptionally well- qualified appellate advocate.'' Another Clinton Solicitor General, Walter Dellinger, said, ``In my view. . .there is no better appellate advocate than John Roberts.'' And one Yale law professor provided this personal glimpse: ``. . .I asked Mr. Roberts whether he would be comfortable taking me--a Democratic young lawyer--under his wing. His response: `Not only would I be comfortable with it, I want you here because I want to learn what others who may at times see the world differently than I think.''' In my view, Mr. Roberts is precisely the type of person we want to see confirmed as a Federal appellate judge, one who will be respectful of all sides of an argument and who will follow the law, not some personal agenda, in deciding which party should prevail. I personally have every confidence that John Roberts will make a sterling addition to the D.C. Circuit, and I look forward to hearing from him today. I will reserve my remarks about the other nominees we are considering until they are called forward. So, with that, we will turn to the ranking member, and then we will go to questions. STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK J. LEAHY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT Senator Leahy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I also welcome John Roberts here again, having been nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. And I am pleased that in this hearing he can have the undivided attention that a lifetime nomination to this most important circuit deserves, and I look forward to hearing his answers to our questions. When last he was here, he was flanked by two other circuit court candidates--Sixth Circuit nominees Jeffrey Sutton and Deborah Cook. Mr. Roberts will recall that on that long day which stretched way into the evening, the overwhelming majority of questions were not to him at all. They were directed to Mr. Sutton, with others to Judge Cook, and he sort of got barely-- we barely had time to even talk to him. So today we are going to have a chance to focus on him in our effort to determine what kind of a judge he would be if he was confirmed. We regret that he was thrown into that most unusual hearing earlier this year. I think it was unfair to him and actually to the other nominees, but especially to the American public because the District of Columbia Circuit is a most important one. It is a circuit to which President Clinton nominated two outstanding individuals during his second term. They were not allowed to have votes by this Committee because the Republicans decided they should not be allowed to have votes. So given its special jurisdictional responsibilities, the District of Columbia Circuit is a most important circuit. I wish that the obstruction of President Clinton's nominees could have been remedied in trying to get some balance in the courts, but the President has decided--and this is his right to decide who he wants to go forward with, but he has decided to divide, not unite, on this matter. I do appreciate what the Chairman has done in having this hearing. It shows how quickly we can move things when we work together, just as the Chairman and I have been working together since I held a hearing last year on asbestos reform and he has held one this year on asbestos reform. And for some of you who are interested, I think the work of Senator Hatch, myself, and a number of other interested members on both sides are coming to fruition. For the first time in years on this complex subject, I actually think, Orrin, we are actually coming close to a solution, and it shows what can happen when we work together. Then we are going to hear from district court nominees Maurice Hicks of Louisiana and David Campbell of Arizona. Both attorneys have the support of their home State Senators. Then we have before us the nomination of William Moschella to be Assistant Attorney General in the Office of Legislative Affairs at the Department of Justice. It is an important office, especially as the Justice Department has been really less than responsive to both the House and the Senate in requests for information. Since September 11th, many of us have been calling for and working for appropriate oversight. I submitted many oversight letters to the Justice Department containing requests for information that have not been responded to, as have a number of Republican Senators. The Justice Department is required to respond to Congress' requirements for reports about various programs that it funds, and it has not done that. For example, they are required to report regarding the current and future use of technologies being developed by the Total Information Awareness project at the Defense Department. So I look forward to hearing how Mr. Moschella works on this. Many of us have worked with him when he was at the House Judiciary Committee, and I know that both Chairman Sensenbrenner and Chairman Hyde, two friends of mine, two people I have a great deal of respect for, think the world of him. I know a lot of the members in the Committee, both Democrats and Republicans, respect his integrity, ability, and commitment. I might say that I share those feelings. So I hope he won't forget his roots here. Obviously, his first responsibility has to--and I am going out on a limb here sort of predicting that he will get through okay. His first responsibility has to be to the administration that is appointing him, but I hope he realizes that there has been a lot of concern expressed by both Republicans and Democrats about the lack of responsiveness from the Department of Justice. And we are all counting on him to correct that. No difficult task there. So, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for having these hearings. Again, I thank you for your work and cooperation on the asbestos thing, and I think that between the two of us we are finally going to--I think we have a real opportunity to bring this perplexing matter to conclusion, to be a benefit to the victims, be a benefit to the companies, a benefit to the American economy, and I think that the court systems will probably breathe a huge sigh of relief if we are able to do that. Chairman Hatch. Well, thank you, Senator. Mr. Roberts, if you will stand and be sworn? Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Mr. Roberts. I do. Chairman Hatch. Thank you. Mr. Roberts, we welcome you again to the Committee. We are honored to have you back, and do you have any statement you would care to make? STATEMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR., NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT Mr. Roberts. No, Mr. Chairman, other than to introduce my parents, Jack and Rosemary Roberts; my sister, Peggy; and my wife, Jane. Chairman Hatch. Please stand up. We are really happy to welcome you all here once again. Okay. [The biographical information of Mr. Roberts follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.001 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.002 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.003 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.004 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.005 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.006 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.007 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.008 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.009 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.010 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.011 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.012 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.013 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.014 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.015 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.016 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.017 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.018 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.019 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.020 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.021 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.022 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.023 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.024 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.025 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.026 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.027 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.028 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.029 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.030 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.031 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.032 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.033 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2548.034 Chairman Hatch. Then we will just start with questions, if it all right with you. Senator Leahy, I will turn to you. Senator Leahy. Well, thank you. Mr. Roberts, over the last decade, the Supreme Court has issued a series of 5-4 decisions. These struck down legislation on federalism grounds. And some see this as a federalism crusade and a very activist Court. It has included--those who have seen laws to protect them struck down have included people with disabilities, older workers, children in gun-infested schools, intellectual property owners, and victims of violence motivated by gender. I am talking about such cases as Alden v. Maine, Florida Prepaid, Garrison, Morrison, Lopez, Kimmel. You are familiar with all those, I know. You have commented publicly on some of these decisions that have overruled Congressional enactments as unconstitutional. My questions are these: Do you believe that they represent a departure or a continuing trend? And what has contributed to this dramatic shift, mostly in the past decade, in the Supreme Court's interpretations of the powers of Congress? Mr. Roberts. Well, I think the first of the series of those cases, to limit myself to the State sovereign immunity cases, the Seminole Tribe case, the question whether it was a departure or a continuation was one of the issues that the Court addressed at some length, both the majority and the dissent. There was a particular prior precedent that seemed to have addressed the question of whether Congress under the Commerce Clause could override State sovereign immunity, and the majority explained why they didn't read the case that way; and if it was going to be read that way, it would be no longer controlling. And the dissent, of course, joined issue on that. So the Court has addressed in that first case the question of whether it was a departure or a continuation, and I think recognized that, at least to some extent, to the extent they were moving away from that prior arguable precedent that the majority and the dissent read differently, it certainly can be regarded as a departure. The cases since then have addressed different refinements on that issue, and that certainly is a continuation of the lead Seminole Tribe case. These cases construe the 11th Amendment, and this is not the first time in our history that the 11th Amendment has been a cause of some division. When the Supreme Court early in its existence decided Chisholm v. Georgia and held that a citizen of another State could sue the State of Georgia, that prompted a reaction in the country that led to the 11th Amendment. And then I think perhaps the key departure, if you will, came in the case of Hans v. Louisiana, where the Court held that although the 11th Amendment addressed only the issue of a citizen of another State suing a State, its reasoning, its principle applied when a citizen of the same State sued. Senator Leahy. Mr. Roberts, I hesitate to interrupt but-- and I appreciate the history and I don't disagree with that. But I am wondering why so many in the past few years. Do you see this as a basic shift? Do you see this as a reaction to Congress? Do you see this as a trend that is going to continue? Mr. Roberts. Well, I think there's--so many in the last few years is because, given that Seminole Tribe was sort of the first of the decisions--again, this is the debate, whether it's a departure or continuation. But it was the first of them, and the ones you've had following in the wake of it are kind of fleshing out that principle, the application of the 11th Amendment and the question whether it can be abrogated under the Commerce Clause, which was the issue in Seminole Tribe or some of the other principles. Others cases I think may well follow, which is in a reaction to the sovereign immunity decisions, because the Court has recognized there are ways for the Federal Government to--I don't want to say get around the 11th Amendment, but address this issue without running afoul of it. Section 5 of the 14th Amendment-- Senator Leahy. It seems that some of the cases coming down in the last few years are finding less and less ways--again, we are even going to intellectual property cases and copyright. Mr. Roberts. Well, what you have-- Senator Leahy. It is almost as though copyright was something new even though it is in our Constitution. Mr. Roberts. Well, the patent and copyright clause, you know, in Seminole Tribe the issue was: Does the Commerce Clause allow the Federal Government to overrule it? Then you're sort of going down each of the different provisions. Does the Intellectual Property Clause allow Congress to overrule it? And they're addressing those. But the Court has-- Senator Leahy. Well, don't Lopez and Morrison--would you agree with Judge Noonan's contention that the ones most likely to overturn Congressional statutes are conservative judges? He uses, I believe, Morrison and Lopez as an example of that. Mr. Roberts. Well, I do not know that conservative or liberal justices are more likely to overturn laws. Certainly, in the Warren Court era, for example, I would suppose it would be the justices you would consider more liberal who were overturning laws. Senator Leahy. So you do not agree with Judge Noonan, then. Mr. Roberts. I have not read his book. I know it is there. Senator Leahy. I would recommend it to you. It is not a beach book, by any means, but it is one where when it came out, I got it and read it. And I am not one who has always agreed with Judge Noonan, but the book is well worthwhile. I do not, let me quickly add, Mr. Chairman, I do not get any percentage of the profits on the books, and I am not a noted author like you are, but I thought this was a--I also read his book. But what worries me on it, on this whole issue of federalism, it seems to me the Court is going more and more to saying they would superimpose their views, an unelected court, on the views of an elected representative form of Government, the Congress, in disability areas, and intellectual property and others, and I worry about that, and I worry about that trend. Now, I realize, on the court you are going on, of course you are restricted to stare decisis, but you know you are not going to have too many cases that fit on all fours, and there is a great deal of flexibility. It is very easy for somebody up for either a district or a circuit court judgeship to say, ``Well, I have to follow the dictates of the next higher court.'' But usually when they get to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, you do not have many cases that get all of the way up to you guys that they are on all fours, on something that the Supreme Court has ruled on. There is hardly any use for it. You mentioned, in your earlier hearing, that in certain situations the Constitution is very clear. Then, you said there are certain areas where literalism obviously does not work. If you are dealing with the Fourth Amendment, something on unreasonable search and seizure, the text is only going to get you so far, well, then what does guide you? Take the Commerce Clause, take the spending power, what does guide you? Obviously, the text is not enough by itself, but I agree with you on that. You cannot go by the literal words on a number of these things in a changing economic world, but what does guide you? What is your lodestone? Mr. Roberts. Well, certainly, as a circuit judge, of course, my lodestar would be the Supreme Court precedence, and they have volumes of them on how to interpret the Commerce Clause, fewer precedents on how to interpret the Spending Clause. I think there are going to be more important cases in that area in the future. But starting with McCullough v. Maryland, Chief Justice Marshall gave a very broad and expansive reading to the powers of the Federal Government and explained that--and I don't remember the exact quote--but if the ends be legitimate, then any means chosen to achieve them are within the power of the Federal Government, and cases interpreting that, throughout the years, have come down. Certainly, by the time Lopez was decided, many of us had learned in law school that it was just sort of a formality to say that interstate commerce was affected and that cases weren't going to be thrown out that way. Lopez certainly breathed new life into the Commerce Clause. I think it remains to be seen, in subsequent decisions, how rigorous a showing, and in many cases, it is just a showing. It's not a question of an abstract fact, does this affect interstate commerce or not, but has this body, the Congress, demonstrated the impact on interstate commerce that drove them to legislate? That's a very important factor. It wasn't present in Lopez at all. I think the members of Congress had heard the same thing I had heard in law school, that this is an important--and they hadn't gone through the process of establishing a record in that case. Other cases are different. But, again, as a circuit judge-- Senator Leahy. We have got some cases, like the Disability Act, where we have had hundreds and hundreds of hearings around the country, thousands of pages of testimony, and the Court says, of course, we have not established a record. You sometimes think that there is picking and choosing. For example, in your NPR interview, you talked about an originalist approach to Constitution interpretation, but how do you do that? Does a judge pick and choose, based on his or her own predilections, whether they are going to use the context of the 18th century or the context of the 21st century? Obviously, there are some things that it would be impossible, although Justice Scalia said that the Constitution means today what it meant when it was written, and he even uses an 18th century dictionary to understand what the 1789 words meant. Do you believe judges pick and choose? I mean, how do you do a literal interpretation? Mr. Roberts. Well, we talked about this some at the first hearing. Again, the Supreme Court has given some guidance on particular areas and said that when you're interpreting this particular provision, this is the kind of approach you should use. The example I like to give is the Seventh Amendment. The Court has said: We take a very historical approach to deciding whether you have a right to a jury trial because of the way the Seventh Amendment is worded. So even if I decided I am going to be a textualist or an originalist or whatever, I do not have the flexibility, when I get to a Seventh Amendment case. The approach, not just the particular results, but the approach is laid out as well there. Now, when you get to the Eleventh Amendment, the one thing we know from the Supreme Court's decision is that strict adherence to a text doesn't give you what the Supreme Court says are the right answers. You have to look at the historical context a little more, and it varies with provisions, as we've said. There's a provision in the Constitution that says a two- thirds vote of the Senate is required. Well, even if you think provisions should be interpreted in light of evolving standards, that doesn't mean two-thirds can become three- fifths. Unreasonable searches and seizures, that's a little more difficult to say just based on the text I know what's unreasonable and what's not. You have to look beyond the text in interpreting that. Senator Leahy. Thank you. I will have further questions. I will submit some for the record, and I know that the distinguished Chairman intends to have a Committee vote next week, and I would urge you to get answers back in time so that we can have a chance to review them in case there are follow- ups. Mr. Roberts. Thank you, Senator. Senator Leahy. It is good to see you again. Mr. Roberts. Thank you. Chairman Hatch. Thank you, Senator. We will turn to Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy? Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome back. Mr. Roberts. Senator Kennedy, thank you. STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD M. KENNEDY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS Senator Kennedy. We welcome the nominee back to the Committee to continue the hearing which began 3 months ago. The advice and consent function assigned to us by the Framers of the Constitution is vital to the proper functioning of our Government. It was a major feature of the structure of the Framer's design, not only for themselves, but for all future generations, and we do not sit here today merely to express our individual preferences about particular judges or even to express the preference of our constituents. We act today as inheritors of a great tradition and a great responsibility to balance the powers of the Executive Branch in selecting the members of the Judicial Branch. We were given the advice and consent power over judicial appointments so that the two elected branches--the Executive and the Legislative--would share coordinate and co-equal responsibility for the third branch, the undemocratic branch, in which the judges are insulated from us, and from the President and from the electorate by lifetime appointments. But the Framers gave us insulation, too, so that we could exercise our functions, including the advice and consent function, fearlessly and freely, even when required to consider the actions of a popular President. We were given 6-year terms, longer the House, longer the President. We were given staggered terms so no more than a third of us would be elected at one time, and we were given the authority to set our own rules for the way we exercise our responsibilities, including advice and consent. We had the constitutional obligation to assure the Judicial Branch remains free and independent, is not a political tool of the Executive, that its obligation is to the constitutional principles, constitutional rights which lie at the heart of our democracy. Our role is positive and proactive, not passive and reactive, regardless of whether the President shares our political or philosophical views. And we, on the Judiciary Committee, have a unique role which we cannot fulfill unless we have ample opportunity in Committee to question the nominee and to discuss in detail how we think the advice and consent power should be exercised with respect to each nominee, and that process resumes today with respect to Mr. Roberts. His nomination is a special one because he has been nominated for a special court. The D.C. Circuit makes the decision with national impact on the lives of all of the American people. Its decisions govern the scope and the effectiveness of our Occupational Health and Safety laws, o of our consumer protection laws, of Federal labor laws, of fair employment laws, including race, gender, disability and discrimination cases, of workers' rights to organize, Clean Air Act rules, Freedom of Information rules, First Amendment rights in broadcast media and many other rights of individuals under the Constitution laws enacted by Congress, and so we must take special care with this and all other appointments to this court. No one has the right to be appointed to any Federal appellate court. The burden is on the President and the nominee to demonstrate that the nomination should have our consent. The less weight the President places on the Senate's advice role, the more weight must be placed on our consent role. Because the District of Columbia has no Senators of its own, the usual prenomination consultation has not occurred, leaving an even heavier burden on the process that we conduct today. So let us approach it with the seriousness of purpose and deliberation it deserves. Mr. Roberts, you responded to questions, the written questions, for which I am grateful. I would like to pick up on some of these. You describe your judicial philosophy as insisting that judges confine themselves to adjudication of the cases before them and not legislate. You want judges to show an essential humility, grounded in the limited role of an undemocratic judiciary, reflected in deference to legislative policy judgments and judicial restraint, not shaping policy. Now, as you are well aware, in the recent years, we in Congress have made bipartisan legislative judgments about policy on issues vital to the public, based on extensive hearings and findings, yet we have had our policy discussion second-guessed by appellate judges. How would you describe the presumption of validity that should attach to our actions, and what do you think we can do to insulate ourselves from this second-guessing on policy issues by judges who do not adhere to the humility and deference standard you prescribe? And what in your writings, in your professional record, should demonstrate and reassure us that, as a judge, you would, in fact, act with the humility and deference to Congressional judgments which you claim is your philosophy? Mr. Roberts. Well, the Supreme Court has, throughout its history, on many occasions described the deference that is due to legislative judgments. Justice Holmes described assessing the constitutionality of an act of Congress as the gravest duty that the Supreme Court is called upon to perform. I'm familiar with those quotations because I've used them in briefs many times when I was in the Justice Department representing the United States and defending acts of Congress before the Supreme Court, and it's a principle that is easily stated and needs to be observed in practice, as well as in theory. Now, the Court, of course, has the obligation, and has been recognized since Marbury v. Madison, to assess the constitutionality of acts of Congress, and when those acts are challenged, it is the obligation of the Court to say what the law is. The determination of when deference to legislative policy judgments goes too far and becomes abdication of the judicial responsibility, and when scrutiny of those judgments goes too far on the part of the judges and becomes what I think is properly called judicial activism, that is certainly the central dilemma of having an unelected, as you describe it correctly, undemocratic judiciary in a democratic republic. And certainly the most gifted commentators we've had have struggled with that. I think the doctrines of deference that have developed over the years, when you're assessing a legislative classification and an area that doesn't implicate a protected class like race or gender, disability, then all you have to show is a rational basis, and that shouldn't be too hard. If you're in one of those other areas, the Court has developed a stricter scrutiny because they think in those areas there is more reason to probe a lot more deeply. But you asked what in my work sort of shows that, I guess I would look to the job I did when I was deputy solicitor general and was defending acts of Congress before the Supreme Court. Senator Kennedy. I am going to come back to the judicial deference in a minute. We had, in your exchanges with Senator Leahy about the power of the Congress, we have seen that the Supreme Court has limited the ability to legislate under the Commerce Clause, the Lopez case. And under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment--that is the ADA case and the RFRA case--we had extensive hearings, listened to Republican and Democrat Attorneys General. There is no even suggestion at that time that we were not going to meet the constitutional requirement. For some of us, the last great authority is the spending power, and the concern that many of us have is where you are going to be on this issue, further limitation of the power of the Congress in using the spending power. The Supreme Court has ruled on this, as you well know, that in the Dole case involving Congress, could, under the Spending Clause, condition Federal highway funds on States, raise the minimum drinking age. Rehnquist authored the opinion. White, Marshall, Blackmun, Powell, Stevens, even Scalia, agreed with that. What is your own view about the authority in the Spending Clause and the power of Congress to use the Spending Clause to achieve its objectives? Is there anything, in terms of your own view, that would, in any way, find that that Spending Clause would be compromised to permit to--to undermine the Dole case? Mr. Roberts. Well, first of all, of course, if I were to be confirmed, my own personal views would not be relevant. I would follow the Supreme Court precedent. There is not a lot of precedent in this area. Senator Kennedy. The only problem is we have seen the changes and the difference in the interpretation by the Court in the Commerce Clause and in Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. I mean, I was the Chairman of the Committee when we had those, and we listened, and there was not going to be a problem on that. And, of course, there were decisions that were made that reinterpreted past history on it. I want to know whether we are taking a chance with you on the Spending Clause. That is the last real authority for us. Mr. Roberts. You discussed the Dole case, South Dakota v. Dole, and in that case, the justices you listed reaffirmed Congress's power to say: If you're going to accept Federal funds, here's what you've got to do. Senator Kennedy. You are not troubled by that? Mr. Roberts. No, it's a basic principle, and I would just point out, as an aside, you listed the justices who agreed with that, the justices who disagreed and dissented in South Dakota v. Dole were Justices Brennan and O'Connor. It is not necessarily the sort of division, sort of the typical conservative/liberal lines at all. In South Dakota v. Dole, the Court referred to a prior precedent. I think it is the Stewart Machine case. And the argument has been made, well, aren't--the issue that I think the Court will address is are there limits on that; is it if you accept one dime of Federal money you have to do all sorts of things, even if they're not germane or proportional? Those are the two standards that had been developed in the prior cases. It wasn't an issue in South Dakota v. Dole. If you didn't lower the drinking age, you lost highway funds. There was certainly a relationship between underage drinking and highway accidents. So the Court ruled in that case that that was an appropriate proportional and germane response. I worked on a brief in that case with my--I was an associate at that time-- Senator Kennedy. You understand this is the law, and this would be the precedent that you would follow. Mr. Roberts. The South Dakota case. Senator Kennedy. Yes, the Dole. Mr. Roberts. Yes. Senator Kennedy. Let me move on, if I could. I do not mean to cut you off. You talked about the judicial activism. Would you agree that activism can come from both sides of the ideological spectrum? Mr. Roberts. Certainly. Senator Kennedy. Could you give us some examples of any of the appellate cases you believe that show impermissible activism on each side. Mr. Roberts. Well, I cited in my written responses a case from California, an old case from the California Supreme Court, because I thought it was important to avoid criticizing binding Supreme Court precedent, in which the California Supreme Court--it was a Lochner era-type case--struck down, on substantive due process grounds, a California law that required employers to pay employees at certain intervals. Their reasoning was that employees are free to negotiate whatever agreements they want, and if they don't negotiate that, you shouldn't interfere with their liberty of contract. Several Supreme Court cases follow the same principle in what people loosely call the Lochner era. I think that's an example of judicial activism. A policy judgment had been made by the State legislature in that case to address a real problem, the inequity in negotiating positions, the fact that employers were frequently not paying employees. I think there were a lot in the mining industry that were directly affected when wages were due, but many months later, and that was a policy judgment. I don't think that was a constitutional evaluation. Senator Kennedy. How about on the other side of the philosophical spectrum, do you see other examples? I mean, conservative/liberal, how would you find? Do you think there has been activism on both sides of the spectrum? And, if so, how would you define that? Mr. Roberts. Well, I do think there has been activism on both sides. I haven't given any thought to a particular Supreme Court case that I thought exhibited liberal judicial activism. Again, I feel reluctant to criticize pending or binding-- Senator Kennedy. Well, I can understand that, but we are trying to give life to your words. You talk about your professed philosophy of deference and humility as real and not just words. That is what I am trying to see from your own kind of experience, in response to those questions, whether you had examples that would give light to those words. President Bush ran on a platform of selecting judges who will be like Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas. We all understand that meant judges who will be activists in reducing the power of Congress to protect people's rights. You must understand, as everyone else does, that you were selected because those at the White House and the Justice Department knew your record and assured the President your decisions would please President Bush. What can you tell us which will reassure us that you will not necessarily follow the lead of Justice Scalia and Thomas? Mr. Roberts. Well, I will follow the lead of the Supreme Court majority in any precedents that are applicable there. And if Justices Scalia and Thomas are in dissent in those cases, I am not going to follow the dissent. I'm going to follow the majority. Senator Kennedy. Are there any cases which you believe that either one of them showed insufficient deference to Congress and became judicial activists? Mr. Roberts. No, I haven't gone through and looked for particular occasions. If they were majority opinions by either of those justices, I would not feel it appropriate for me to criticize those because I would have to apply that majority opinion, whether I agree with it or not. And I think it's important for the Committee to understand I have been asked questions in some areas I think because people wonder whether I'm going to follow a particular precedent or because they're concerned I might not, and in other areas the concern seems to be that I might, depending on whether a particular questioner is critical or supportive of those decisions. I am going to follow both the decisions I agree with and the decisions that I don't agree with, regardless of any personal view. Senator Kennedy. Well, as you understand, I am not trying to get the outcome of your judgment on a particular fact situation, but I have listened for 40 years nominees say that they are going to follow the precedent and interpret the law, and yet every single day on just about every single court, they come out in different directions. Some are in the majority and some are in the minority, and they have sat here and given similar kind of answers. And what I am trying to find out is what is behind those answers so that we can give some light to it. Because, as you understand, every single day people are applying what they understand is the law and applying what the President--and there is, in many, many instances, a wide difference. Certainly, there is even in the courts. So our ability for--you give words about, particularly on the authority and responsibility of Congress, you are talking you would be a nonjudicial activist, and we are trying to find out what these words mean in terms of your own kind of life experience, either by your writings, your statements or your opinions about this, and that I think we are entitled to find out. Mr. Roberts. I guess what I would point to, Senator--I'm obviously not a sitting judge. I don't have decisions--but I do have a history of litigating cases, and when you talk about the ability to set aside personal views and apply precedent without regard to personal ideology or personal views, that's something I've been able to do in my practice. My practice has not been ideological in any sense. My clients and their positions are liberal and conservative across the board. I have argued in favor of environmental restrictions and against takings claims. I've argued in favor of affirmative action. I've argued in favor of prisoners' rights under the Eighth Amendment. I've argued in favor of antitrust enforcement. At the same time, I've represented defendants charged with antitrust cases. I've argued cases against affirmative action. And what I've been able to do in each of those cases is set aside any personal views and discharge the professional obligation of an advocate. And I would urge you to look at cases on both sides. Look at the brief, look at the argument where I was arguing the pro environmental position. Take a brief and an argument where I was arguing against environmental enforcement on behalf of a client. See if the professional skills applied, the zealous advocacy is any different in either of those cases. I would respectfully submit that you'll find that it was not. Now, that's not judging, I understand that, but it is the same skill, setting aside personal views, taking the precedents and applying them either as an advocate or as a judge. Senator Kennedy. Well, now, I hear you on this. But, every day, responsible disagree with one another, and there is an implicit band of discretion in the decisions before them. In many cases, there is an explicit role for judicial discretion. That is what I am interested in. That is what I am interested in. Do you really believe that the judge's sensitivity to the purpose and the result of the laws they interpret is irrelevant to the way they will exercise their discretionary review of other judges or review other judge's exercise of discretion. I am interested in what in your background or expertise demonstrate you will be sensitive to the human impact of your decisions. You are going to be a judge that is going to be making judgments and decisions on these range of issues--health and safety, consumer protection, the labor laws, fair employment, gender, race, disability, Clean Air, workers' rights, Freedom of Information, a whole range, a whole range, a whole range. What can you tell us, in your own experience, would reflect on your judgment in being sensitive to the human conditions that are going to be involved in the great numbers of cases there are going to be for that? Mr. Roberts. I don't know if this is responsive or not because, of course, when you are an advocate, you're advocating a client's position, and you're concerned about a particular human impact and not others. Certainly, when you're a judge, you want to apply the law and, yes, you have to be sensitive to the impact of your decision, but at the same time apply the law fairly without regard--what the judicial oath says--without regard to persons. At the same time, I appreciate the fact that the law has impact on people in society, and I think it's, for example, an important obligation of a lawyer to do pro bono work, to address the situation of people impacted by the law who don't have the resources to respond. Senator Kennedy. Maybe you can tell us. Talk about that. Mr. Roberts. One of the cases I handled before the D.C. Court of Appeals was Little v. Barry. I represented a class of general public welfare recipients in the District who had had their welfare benefits terminated, and we argued, and argued on the basis of Goldberg v. Kelly, a landmark civil rights case, that those individuals were entitled to individualized hearings before their welfare benefits were terminated. I argued that before the court of appeals on a pro bono basis. And that was a case where the law had a very real and direct impact on the most needy citizens in our country, and I was happy to take that case on behalf of that class of welfare recipients. Senator Kennedy. If there are others, I would be interested in it. Mr. Roberts. Well, there are other-- Senator Kennedy. We can talk now, but there is going to be this band of discretion. You are going to apply the law, as you have outlined. You can be on the pro and con. You have answered that kind of question, but there is that band of discretion which judges are exercising, and this court makes judgments on matters that have enormous impact in terms of the quality of life and rights of individuals. And I am looking for that ingredient in your kind of life experience that would help to show that the human element that is being considered in this is something that you both understand, appreciate and would be concerned with. Mr. Roberts. Senator, there are other examples. The first case I argued in the Supreme Court was on a pro bono basis on behalf of an individual facing the almighty might of the U.S. Government, going after him criminally and civilly. I regularly participate, our firm has a Community Services Department that does pro bono work. Whenever there is an appeal involved, I and members of our appellate group help prepare. We have recently done issues involving termination of parental rights. I can't imagine a more direct impact on an individual. Minority voting rights is another case we participated in, in which we prepare the people arguing pro bono for the appeals. I do a street law program that I think is important. Senator Kennedy. With the law school or with-- Mr. Roberts. It's done in conjunction with the Supreme Court Historical Society. Every summer high school teachers who are teaching about the courts come to learn a little bit about it, and I talk to them about how the Supreme Court functions, and it's a very, I've always found it very rewarding to sit with the high school teachers and hear what they, the difficulties they have in communicating with their students about the justice system. Senator Kennedy. That is very, I am interested in it, and I appreciate your response to these questions and anything else on this would be useful. I just had one final. I know I am out of time, but I have one final question, Chairman. In your answers to the committee's questions, you indicate your understanding the Framers insulated the judges from the public pressures. Do you also understand and agree that in keeping the Senate small and giving us the staggered terms, letting us make our own rules for exercising the key responsibility of the advice and consent also intended to insulate us to exercise our authority to prevent the Executive Branch from going too far in the assertion of their powers and the exertion of the Executive Branch powers? Mr. Roberts. Well, I don't know about in particular reference to advice and consent, but certainly, as I understand the structure of the Constitution, the Senate was, as you indicated earlier, given a longer term, given staggered terms because it was supposed to exercise something of a restraining influence on the more popularly responsive branches of government. Senator Kennedy. This is a well-rooted responsibility, as I understand. I mean, we have seen at times when you can take-- the most obvious historic would be the court-packing by President Roosevelt, when there would be an important responsibility by the Congress to stand up to a President, actions of the Executive Branch. And as someone who is a constitutional authority, such as yourself, where of that historic responsibility and role and thought about it, if there is anything you can tell-- Mr. Roberts. Well, I don't claim to be a constitutional authority, but certainly the Senate obviously has a critical responsibility in this area. My memory may not be correct, but I believe original drafts of the Constitution provided that the Senate would actually be appointing the judges. [Laughter.] Senator Kennedy. There you go. Did you hear that, Orrin? Chairman Hatch. That is what they think they are doing now. [Laughter.] Mr. Roberts. Cooler heads prevailed before the end. Chairman Hatch. I am glad you added that last part. Mr. Roberts. But I am happy to be scrutinized under whatever standard the Committee or the Senate wishes to apply. Senator Kennedy. Thank you very much. Chairman Hatch. We will turn to Senator Durbin now. STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD J. DURBIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Senator Durbin. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Roberts, thank you for coming back. I am glad we had a chance for this hearing, and I thank the Chairman. I think we have reached an accommodation here that may be helpful in moving this Committee forward in a better environment. I understand my fate in life as a back-bencher in the minority in the Senate with a Republican President, that nominees that come before us are not likely to share my political philosophy. That is a fact of life. I also understand that I have a responsibility under the Constitution to ask questions of those nominees to satisfy my judgment that they would be well-suited to serve on the Federal bench. Many of the nominees have been forthcoming, and open, and candid in their answers, others have not. As a politician, I can certainly identify with that. I have danced around questions in my life, Waltz steps, Polka steps, Samba steps, I try them all when I do not want to answer a question. And now I am going to ask you a question, just a limited number of questions relating to some dance steps I see in your answers here. So, in 1991, you are in the Solicitor General's Office, and in Rust v. Sullivan, you end up signing on to a brief which calls for overturning Roe v. Wade, one of the more controversial Supreme Court cases of my lifetime. When we asked repeatedly in questions of you what your position is on Roe v. Wade, you have basically danced away and said, ``No, no, my personal views mean nothing. I am just going to apply the law.'' This, in my mind, is evasive. I need to hear something more definitive from you. Was the statement in that brief an expression of your personal and legal feelings about Roe v. Wade, that it should be repealed? What is your position today, in terms of that decision? Mr. Roberts. The statement in the brief was my position as an advocate for a client. We were defending a Health and Human Services program in which the allegation was that the regulations issued by the Department of Health and Human Services burdened the constitutional right to an abortion recognized in Roe v. Wade. At that time, it was the position of the administration, articulated in four different briefs filed with the Supreme Court, briefs that I hadn't worked on, that Roe v. Wade should be overturned. Now, if Roe v. Wade were to be overturned, the challenge to the regulations that we were tasked with defending would fail, and so it was appropriate in that case to include that argument. I think it was all of one or two sentences. The bulk of the brief was addressed to why the regulations were valid, in any event. But since that was the administration position, and the administration was my client, I reiterated that position in the brief because it was my responsibility to defend that HHS program. Senator Durbin. Understood. I have been an attorney, represented a client, sometimes argued a position that I did not necessarily buy, personally. And so I am asking you today what is your position on Roe v. Wade? Mr. Roberts. I don't--Roe v. Wade is the settled law of the land. It is not--it's a little more than settled. It was reaffirmed in the face of a challenge that it should be overruled in the Casey decision. Accordingly, it's the settled law of the land. There's nothing in my personal views that would prevent me from fully and faithfully applying that precedent, as well as Casey. Senator Durbin. Then, let me ask you this question. You make a painful analogy, from my point of view, when you suggest that calling for the overturn of Roe v. Wade was not any different than the Government calling for overturning Plessy v. Ferguson and Brown v. Board of Education. Plessy v. Ferguson, separate, but equal, was really the basis for racial discrimination and segregation in America for decades. I hope that that is just a strict legal analogy and does not reflect your opinion of Roe v. Wade policy compared to Plessy v. Ferguson policy. Mr. Roberts. Senator, the question I was asked, were there other occasions in which the Department--if I am remembering correctly--if there were other occasions in which the Solicitor General had urged that a Supreme Court precedent be overturned, and that is just--Brown v. Board of Education is the most prominent one. The answer wasn't meant to draw a particular substantive analogy. Senator Durbin. And I will not push any further because I was hoping that is what your response would be. So in the panel that you were on the last time before us, Justice Deborah Cook of the Ohio Supreme Court was one of the members of the panel, and I sent a written question to her, which I sent to you. And the basic question goes into the cliches we use in this Committee about strict construction, and where are you, and how do you compare yourself to Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas, and then try to draw some conclusions. Now, as oblique as those questions may be, that is as good as it gets in this Committee. That is as close as we can get to trying to find out what is really ticking in your heart when it comes to your judicial philosophy. And her answers were, as I have said, painful, but painfully honest. She said she was not a strict constructionist, but she conceded in answers to question that if the Supreme Court had a majority of strict constructionists, it is not likely they would have reached the same conclusion in Brown v. Board of Education, the Miranda decision or Roe v. Wade. I thought that was the most honest answer we have been given by a Bush nominee, and I have used it as kind of a standard ever since to just see how far other nominees would go in their candor and honesty. I found your answer evasive. When I look at what you had to say about your philosophy, you said, ``In short, I do not think beginning with an all-encompassing approach to constitutional interpretation is the best way to faithfully construe the document,'' and then you went on to say I am not going to draw any conclusions on the Supreme Court decisions. I need more. I need to hear more from you about where you are coming from and, at least hypothetically, if you agree that those who call themselves strict constructionists would not likely be in the vanguard of the socially important Supreme Court decisions that we have seen in Brown v. Board, Miranda or Roe v. Wade. Mr. Roberts. Well, Senator, I don't know if that's a flaw for a judicial nominee or not, not to have a comprehensive philosophy about constitutional interpretation, to be able to say, ``I'm an originalist, I'm a textualist, I'm a literalist or this or that.'' I just don't feel comfortable with any of those particular labels. One reason is that as the Constitution uses the term ``inferior court judge,'' I'll be bound to follow the Supreme Court precedent regardless of what type of constructionist I, personally, might be. The other thing is, in my review over the years and looking at Supreme Court constitutional decisions, I don't necessarily think that it's the best approach to have an all-encompassing philosophy. The Supreme Court certainly doesn't. There are some areas where they apply what you might think of as a strict construction; there are other areas where they don't. And I don't accept the proposition that a strict constructionist is necessarily hostile to civil rights. For example, Justice Black thought he was a strict constructionist of the First Amendment. No law means no law. Well, that's a very sympathetic view to people who have First Amendment claims. I can see the argument that someone who is going to be a strict constructionist on the Eleventh Amendment might result, come forward with decisions that are more acceptable to some of the questions Senator Leahy was raising earlier. The Eleventh Amendment says the citizen of another State, so how does it apply with citizen of the same State if you are going to be a strict constructionist? The Supreme Court doesn't apply a uniform and consistent approach. I certainly don't feel comfortable with any uniform or c"
