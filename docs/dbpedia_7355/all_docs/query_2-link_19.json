        "text": "WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 - President Bush on Tuesday nominated Michael Chertoff, a federal appeals judge and former prosecutor who helped oversee the Justice Department's antiterrorism efforts after the Sept. 11 attacks, to succeed Tom Ridge as homeland security secretary.\n\nMr. Bush made the announcement a month and a day after his original choice to succeed Mr. Ridge, Bernard B. Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner, withdrew his nomination amid legal and ethical questions.\n\nIn Judge Chertoff, Mr. Bush chose another veteran of law enforcement in the New York region who, as the president pointedly noted, has been confirmed three times by the Senate to previous posts, the last in 2003.\n\n\"When Mike is confirmed by the Senate, the Department of Homeland Security will be led by a practical organizer, a skilled manager and a brilliant thinker,\" Mr. Bush said.\n\nHe praised Judge Chertoff as having an \"impressive record of cutting through red tape and moving organizations into action.\"\n\nIn brief remarks, Judge Chertoff recalled helping respond to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as head of the criminal division at the Justice Department and said that if confirmed, \"I will be proud to stand again with the men and women who form our front line against terror.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
