        "text": "Like many U.S. Supreme Court justices and nominees to the high court before him, nominee Merrick Garland is a graduate of Harvard Law School.\n\nHe obtained his law degree in 1977, and one of his law school friends — who was one year behind him — is Michael Chertoff. Chertoff went on to serve as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia and as the second Secretary of Homeland Security. He and Garland have crossed professional paths over the years, and, he says, have been friends for more than 40 years.\n\nChertoff joined WBUR's All Things Considered to share his reaction to Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court."
