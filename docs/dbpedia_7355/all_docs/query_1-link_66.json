MICHAEL CHERTOFF ---------- WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 2005 U.S. Senate, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:03 a.m., in room SD-342, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Susan M. Collins, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Collins, Coleman, Bennett, Domenici, Warner, Lieberman, Levin, Akaka, Dayton, Carper, and Lautenberg. OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN COLLINS Chairman Collins. Good morning. The Committee will come to order. Today, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs will consider the nomination of Judge Michael Chertoff to be the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. This is an extraordinarily challenging job, a job that requires an individual with extraordinary leadership skills, extraordinary dedication, extraordinary energy, and at times, extraordinarily thick skin. Before I begin, I would like to express my gratitude to the person Judge Chertoff seeks to replace. Following the attacks of September 11, Tom Ridge answered the call of service to his country. At a time when homeland security was little more than a concept, Tom Ridge stepped forward to begin the monumental task of making it a reality. He is a pioneer and a patriot, and on behalf of all Americans, I thank him and wish him great success in his future endeavors. Judge Chertoff now steps forward to answer that call. The strengths and experience he brings are impressive. He has devoted a significant part of his life to public service, as a Federal prosecutor in New Jersey, then as head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, and now as a Federal judge. As the overwhelming vote for his confirmation 2 years ago demonstrated, he is well respected on both sides of the aisle. That is also evident from the fact that two of our distinguished Democratic colleagues are here to introduce him this morning. Since September 11, Judge Chertoff has established himself as a leading expert on the legal and national security issues surrounding the war on terrorism. The purpose of this hearing is, of course, to evaluate the qualifications, integrity, and positions of the nominee. It is inevitable and necessary that we do so in the context of where the Department currently stands and where we want it to go. To do that, I believe it is important that we should also consider the context in which the Department was born. In the immediate aftermath of September 11, America was a Nation determined to defeat terrorism, but still feeling its way toward an effective response. We knew from the start that ensuring our Nation's security should not come at the cost of our civil liberties, the very freedoms that Americans cherish and that define us as a country. In those perilous, uncertain days, we also knew that we needed to take decisive action immediately to protect our citizens from further attacks. Some now question whether we tilted the balance too far towards security. It is always appropriate to ask that question, but it is also important to remember the atrocities that led us to take action and to remember that the threat continues today. One of the difficult balancing questions that has been raised in conjunction with this nomination is the matter of interrogating those detained in the war on terror. In his responses to our written questions, Judge Chertoff makes absolutely clear that he believes that torture is wrong, no matter where it occurs. Of course, that is exactly right. But the larger issue of security versus liberty is much more complex and I very much look forward to discussing this balance with Judge Chertoff today. Since it began operations nearly 2 years ago, the Department of Homeland Security has made considerable progress in its mission of protecting our Nation against terrorism and improving our ability to respond should an attack occur. The melding of 22 Federal agencies with some 185,000 employees has proven to be a task as difficult as it sounds, but it has not been the impossibility that some predicted. We are, in fact, better protected today and our ability to respond is greatly improved. This new year begins, however, with fresh reminders of the great challenges that lie ahead. A week ago, this Committee held an oversight hearing to assess those challenges and they are considerable. From the lack of long-range strategic planning to an inefficient management structure to unexplained delays in the Transportation Worker Identification Credential, our expert witnesses made a powerful argument that homeland security remains very much a work in progress. The Government Accountability Office's high-risk list released last week bolsters that assessment. Many of the difficulties the GAO foresaw 2 years ago in consolidating 22 separate agencies into one new and cohesive Department remain to be overcome. Now, the GAO additionally finds that information sharing, both within the Department and with other departments and other levels of government, is a weakness that also must be addressed. There are other important challenges that the new Secretary will face. They include strengthening the security of our ports, ensuring adequate funding for our first responders, fostering stronger relationships with State and local law enforcement, and securing our critical infrastructure. The new Secretary will have a full plate. The Committee looks forward to hearing Judge Chertoff's views about the direction and the future of the new Department as well as his own priorities. Senator Lieberman. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR LIEBERMAN Senator Lieberman. Thanks, Madam Chairman, and welcome, Judge Chertoff. Madam Chairman, I was thinking as I was listening to your opening statement that after our work together on the intelligence reform bill last year, you said it would be dangerous if we ever didn't agree on something because we know so much about how each other thinks. Your opening statement proves that either that is true or we have the same person drafting our opening statements. [Laughter.] So I will speak more briefly than I had intended. The fact is that the Department of Homeland Security, in the 2 years since this Committee led the way in creating it, has become the leader in the U.S. Government in protecting the security of the American people here at home. And you are absolutely right, Senator Collins. Secretary Ridge deserves credit for beginning the enormous transformation that the Homeland Security Department's creation required, and for enabling us all to say today that we are safer than we were on September 11, 2001. Yet as you know, Judge Chertoff--and as we heard from the panel of experts and independent analysts that we had in here last week--significant challenges await the next Secretary, ranging from the development of a clear strategic plan--and I do not see how we can ask you to do the job that we want you to do and that I know you want to do, without having a plan which includes setting of priorities for the Department in a time when you just can not do everything right away--to improving the Department's day-to-day operations. We heard some very powerful testimony that the position of Secretary of Homeland Security and those who serve the Secretary as deputies may not have all the authority that they need to carry out their responsibilities that we have given them. They may not, in fact, have within their own offices the staff that they need to carry out their responsibilities that we have given those offices. There was a suggestion made last week by several of the experts in regard to the lack of a strategic plan and priorities for the agency that we establish an Under Secretary for Policy and Planning. I gather that you have expressed some interest in the creation of that position. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on it today. But most importantly, the Department has to receive adequate financial support to carry out the enormous responsibilities we have given you in law to protect the American people from a terrorist who will strike us where we are vulnerable. And in an open society, there are many vulnerabilities. We are never going to be able to close them all against fanatics who, as someone else has said, hate us more than they love their own lives. They are prepared to take their own lives in destroying us. But we know that there remain persistent vulnerabilities that we have to close at our borders and ports, within our rail and transit system, at the Nation's core energy, telecommunications, water, transportation, financial, and chemical industry networks that exist. The Coast Guard is in dire need of a modernized fleet. The administration and we must do more to prepare the Nation for a possible bioterror attack that could put millions of Americans at risk. The bottom line is, this Department needs more authority from us to help you do what we have asked you to do in our defense. It needs more money. I just can not cloud that in any other way. I know how difficult it will be in a resource- limited environment, but we have the best military in the world and therefore the best international security operation in the world today because we have invested in it, and we will only have the same here at home if we invest in it. To do that, we are going to have to regain some of that sense of urgency that propelled us following September 11, 2001, and we are going to have to express that urgency in the way we support and you administer the Department of Homeland Security. Judge Chertoff, I have examined your record. I have had the chance to speak to you at some length. You have served your country with distinction. I greatly appreciate your willingness to leave the circuit court to take on these truly awesome responsibilities. I think you know that a number of questions have been raised in recent days, as the Chairman indicated, about your role in the administration's prosecution of the war on terror, most recently with regard to advice you provided regarding the laws prohibiting torture, advice you may have provided while you were head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division. I know that you discussed that issue with the Committee's staff extensively on Monday. Today, I think it is important that you discuss these issues publicly before the Committee and the American people. My interest here is, first, to determine what your role was in those various policies, what your opinions are today with regard to those. But then, second, notwithstanding whether we agree or disagree with you about your course of conduct in those matters or your opinions today, if they in any way affect your ability to assume the responsibilities for which you are nominated. Otherwise, beyond those questions, I would say you are extraordinarily well qualified for the position. I look forward to the testimony and ultimately I look forward to working with you to keep America and the American people safe from terrorist attack. Thank you. Chairman Collins. Thank you, Senator Lieberman. As is customary, we will be following the early bird rule and I will now call upon the other Members for opening statements, not to exceed 3 minutes in length. Senator Warner. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR WARNER Senator Warner. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Welcome, Judge. We had a wonderful visit in my office, exchanged our respective views very cordially and very forthright. We both started our careers as law clerks for the Federal judiciary and you succeeded. You ended up on the bench. This country owes you a great debt of gratitude, having resigned that position to which you aspired, I presume most of your life, to take on the new challenges of this day. So as a citizen, we thank you for that, and your family. I would simply say, Madam Chairman, that we take notice that the U.S. Senate has confirmed this extraordinary public servant on one occasion and I anticipate, and I intend to give you my support, you will be confirmed again. Once in office, I will try and offer to work with you to see that there is a seamless and full cooperation between the Department of Defense, over which I have some responsibilities together with several members, the chairman and ranking member on my committee, the Armed Services, and your new Department, because America deserves no less than the full coordination of every single asset we have to perform your challenging mission. Good luck. Chairman Collins. Thank you, Senator. Senator Levin. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR LEVIN Senator Levin. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and welcome, Judge Chertoff. The new Secretary of Homeland Security will have an enormous challenge, including strengthening the programs that fund our domestic preparedness and response capabilities, protecting our borders and ports, and improving our transportation security, and taking all the necessary steps to enhance our collective security without eroding our core values. I want to thank our Chairman and Ranking Member for making reference to Governor Ridge and the dedication that he showed towards that challenge. I know that you both spoke for really, I am sure, every Member of this Committee and every member of Senate and the people of the United States in expressing our gratitude to Secretary Ridge. There are a lot of funding issues that relate to the Department that Judge Chertoff will hopefully address. The State Homeland Security Grant Program, which is one of the most important sources of funding for our first responders, was actually cut last year. The administration requested only $700 million for the program, which had been funded at $1.7 billion in fiscal year 2004. Congress stepped in and increased the amount to $1.1 billion in the final Homeland Security appropriations bill. But if we are serious about homeland security, we have to fund it. We also need to change the way funding is distributed by allocating it to those areas where the threat and the risk of attacks are most significant. The existing funding formula used to allocate funding in some of the largest Department of Homeland Security grant programs has led to some irrational and some inequitable results. Secretary Ridge opposed the formula that led to those results and the administration said it would propose that the funding be allocated more on risk. I look forward to Judge Chertoff's perspective on those funding issues, as well as a number of issues which have been raised. I raise issues which he addressed as head of the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice. He headed the division from May 2001 until March 2003. Judge Chertoff, you have a reputation of being a thoughtful person and a straight shooter, and the presence of these two Senators from New Jersey here today in support of your nomination is surely a testimony, an eloquent testimony, of that reputation. The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which is a different division from yours, took actions that were troubling during the period in which you headed the Criminal Division, most notably its promulgation of legal theories circumventing legal prohibitions against torture and inhumane treatment of detainees. Judge Chertoff's role in the development of those legal theories needs to be clarified. Those theories helped to create an environment in which the abusive behavior of prisoners was either permitted or was perceived to be permitted. That distortion of our legal and moral obligation to treat prisoners humanely undermines the safety of our troops. It also undermines our standing in the world. Judge Chertoff's written answers to pre-hearing questions state that he reviewed a draft of the August 1, 2002, Office of Legal Counsel memorandum that interpreted the definition of torture prohibited under our anti-torture laws. That discredited August 2002 memorandum defined what constitutes prohibited torture very narrowly, including the claim that, ``physical pain amounting to torture must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily functions, or even death.'' Judge Chertoff has acknowledged that he was consulted on how he, as chief Federal prosecutor, would apply the law. Last weekend, The New York Times reported that the Justice Department's Criminal Division, then under Judge Chertoff, was consulted on several occasions by the CIA as to whether their agents could be subject to criminal prosecution for using specified interrogation techniques, and I hope Judge Chertoff will elaborate on the advice that he and the Criminal Division provided regarding the definition of torture and the legality of specific interrogation techniques. There are other events that were reported to have occurred during Judge Chertoff's tenure at the Department of Justice that I hope he will address, as well. For example, a report from the Department's Inspector General stated that some alleged immigration law violators detained following the September 11 attacks were prevented from obtaining counsel in a timely fashion. So again, I thank you, Madam Chairman and Senator Lieberman, for your comments. I share those thoughts of yours not only relative to Governor Ridge but relative to the principal role of this agency which Judge Chertoff is going to head and I believe can head with distinction. Chairman Collins. Thank you. Senator Coleman. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR COLEMAN Senator Coleman. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I want to thank you for moving so quickly on this very important hearing that we are having today. Thank you for your leadership. I want to join in those who have acknowledged and applauded Tom Ridge. No one expects the Secretary of Transportation to prevent every highway death. No one expects the Director of the EPA to prevent all pollution. But we expect the head of Homeland Security in this country to make sure that America is safe and not failing, would have a tremendous impact. So it is an extraordinarily difficult job and Secretary Ridge did an extraordinary job. Judge Chertoff, there is no question in my mind about your qualifications, and the Chairman laid out that this hearing is about qualifications and integrity of your position in terms of leading this Department. I think you come with extraordinary credentials. The one concern I have as a former mayor, as a local official, and reflecting on your background as a Federal prosecutor and as a Federal judge, as working in the Justice Department, is the level of coordination between this Department and folks at the local level. I remain deeply concerned about that. Part of it goes to funding. We had a situation in Minnesota where the Twin Cities, as they are known in the Twin Cities, perhaps not in Washington, but as the Twin Cities, Minneapolis gets funded and St. Paul gets zeroed out. And the level of communication with local elected officials, in that instance, the mayor is called the morning of the announcement. There is no communication, no consultation. As I speak to law enforcement folks, first responders, they still raise concerns today about the level of communication. International Falls, Minnesota, is in a rural area. It is the coldest place in the United States. It is one of the 50 busiest land ports of entry in the United States. We have two nuclear facilities, one in Red Wing, Minnesota, a rural area on the Mississippi River, one in Monticello, outside the urban center and considered a rural area. And the level of communication between folks at the Federal level and the local level has to be better than it is. So I look at that funding issue that we had and the lack of communication, lack of understanding. I speak to local law enforcement and the concerns are there and they are still there. So certainly in my questioning, I hope we can discuss your vision for what can we do to improve the level of communication so that our real first responders know what is going on, are in consultation, are in contact, are consulted and have the level of confidence they need to be the ones who, God forbid there ever is an attack on our homeland, have the ability to respond in the right way. So with that, I do look forward to this hearing. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Chairman Collins. Thank you. Senator Akaka. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR AKAKA Senator Akaka. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman. I want to thank you for expediting this hearing of the confirmation of Judge Michael Chertoff. I want to welcome Judge Chertoff to this Committee with my congratulations on your nomination. I also want to welcome your family who are present here today. I am certain that they all share your pride in being nominated as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. My colleagues and I will lay before you a variety of issues that concern us and suggest solutions, just as we did with your predecessor, Secretary Ridge, who led this new agency with strength and grace. DHS remains an agency still in the process of being created. Madam Chairman, I would ask that my full statement be placed in the record. Chairman Collins. Without objection. [The prepared statement of Senator Akaka follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR AKAKA Judge Chertoff, please accept my heartiest congratulations on your nomination. I welcome you and your family today. I am certain they all share your pride in being nominated as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Today's hearing presents a special opportunity for you to articulate your vision of how DHS will carry out its mission of defending the Nation's borders and protecting us from terrorism while defending our civil liberties. The challenges you will face, if confirmed, are demanding and will require you to search for answers beyond the commonplace and apply your impressive skills to this new job. My colleagues and I will lay before you a variety of issues that concern us and suggest solutions just as we did for your predecessor, Secretary Ridge, who led this new agency with strength and grace. But DHS remains an agency still in the process of being created. The December 2004 DHS Inspector General report on management challenges outlines an array of worrisome problems--some of which are to be expected when 22 entitles are combined in a single department. I have a number of concerns, some of which I will summarize today. I want your assurance that you will defend the Constitution to safeguard our civil liberties. The price of security should never erode our constitutional freedoms, which are essential to the preservation of this democracy. When we met a couple of days ago, you and I talked about the just- released personnel regulations covering the 180,000 men and women who staff DHS. To make these new regulations work, there must be significant and meaningful outreach to this dedicated workforce, their unions, and their managers. With just about half of the Federal workforce eligible for retirement in the next 5 years, DHS and other Federal agencies must promote a sense of trust and a sense of worth among its employees. Madam Chairman, I wish to insert into the record an editorial from the January 31, 2005,\\1\\ Washington Post that goes straight to my concerns about the new DHS personnel rules: Implementing a pay for performance system without a strong performance management system in place, internalizing employee appeals without independent members and adequate external oversight, and the continued position by some that belonging to a union is a threat to national security. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Article from The Washington Post, appears in the Appendix on page 61. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Judge Chertoff, it will be up to you to make sure that DHS recruits and retains the best and brightest to be on the front lines of our national defense. DHS has been given, by statute, a prominent seat in the Intelligence Community. But the Department will need to earn the respect of that community through the quality of its analysis and its response to threats. The Department must have the financial management systems and practices in place to provide meaningful and timely information needed for sound and efficient management decisionmaking. I am particularly pleased that a provision similar to legislation I sponsored with our former colleague, Senator Peter Fitzgerald, is now law, thus bringing DHS under the Chief Financial Officers Act and ensuring a Senate- confirmed CFO who reports directly to the Secretary of DHS. Judge Chertoff, when we met earlier this week we also discussed my home State of Hawaii. Given the State's unique geographic location, nearly 2,500 miles from the West Coast, there are unique challenges to securing Hawaii from asymmetric threats. For example, when disaster strikes, Hawaii cannot call on neighboring States for assistance due to the distance and time differences. Our eight inhabited islands must be self-sufficient. Secretary Ridge recognized this and took the opportunity to visit Hawaii. I hope you will go there, too. Hawaii, as an island State, depends heavily on air travel. We are waiting for TSA funding to install in-line Explosive Detection System (EDS) machines. This need is critical at all our airports. Honolulu International Airport serves more than 20 million travelers each year, and each of the other islands have international travelers as well. In fact, the neighbor islands combined serve as many visitors as Honolulu. Because tourism is the State's largest industry, crowded lobbies due to long wait times pose a threat to this critical economic sector. Judge Chertoff, I look forward to a productive working relationship with you. Congress was the impetus for creating DHS. We want to work with you to ensure the Department carries out its mission. I am pleased you have stressed the need to cooperate closely with Congress, particularly this Committee, and to provide the information we need to do our job. You will find this Committee very detailed-oriented; but details are necessary to conduct effective oversight in order to provide you with the resources and support you will need to be successful. Thank you Madam Chairman. I look forward to hearing from our nominee. Senator Akaka. I have a number of concerns, some of which I summarize today. I want your assurance that you will defend the Constitution to safeguard our civil liberties.

You will find this Committee very detail-oriented, but details are necessary to conduct the effective oversight in order to provide you with the resources and support you will need to be successful. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Chairman Collins. Thank you. Senator Bennett. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR BENNETT Senator Bennett. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I first met Michael Chertoff as a very green, very new Member of the U.S. Senate when Senator Riegel was chairing the Whitewater hearings and Michael Chertoff came in to inform those of us that were unburdened with a legal education as to what was really going on. I was tremendously impressed with him at that time, learned a great deal from him, and have followed his career with great interest. I am happy to make it clear that I will be a very enthusiastic endorser for his nomination. Mr. Secretary, I think it is, echoing what Senator Warner said, a demonstration of your willingness to serve your country that you will give up a lifetime appointment with a permanent pension to step into a situation that can only be described as dysfunctional. That in no way is a criticism of Secretary Ridge. I said to this Committee and my colleagues when the Department was created, let us be under no illusions that it will work for at least 5 years. The past history of departments put together like this demonstrates that the administrative challenge of making something like this work requires a tremendous amount of time and a tremendous amount of talent, and I agree with those Senators who said that Secretary Ridge has handled the first 2 years with great distinction. But the challenge is still just as great and I, for one, am grateful to you, Mr. Secretary, for your willingness to take it on. I will have some specific questions about the area of greatest concern that I have, which is cyber security, which I have discussed with the nominee in the confines of my office, and I will save that for the questioning period. Chairman Collins. Thank you. Senator Dayton. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR DAYTON Senator Dayton. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Senator Bennett mentioned a lifetime appointment and a permanent pension. He didn't mention you also wouldn't have to appear before Senate committees, but all the more to your credit that you are willing to take this assignment on. I apologize for not being able to meet with you. Mad cow disease is one of the priorities in Minnesota, so I apologize that that intervened. I will save most of my comments for the questioning period, but I do support very strongly what my colleague from Minnesota said. You notice there are two Minnesotans on this Committee, so I will be watching to see if you visit International Falls twice for every one time you go to Honolulu. [Laughter.] Particularly since this body has in the past debated the need for additional funds for first responders, for local enforcement and response efforts and the majority decision was not to provide that additional funding, it is particularly distressing to see these, what appear to me to be very arbitrary and nonsensical elimination of funding for certain areas while others continue at the same or even reduced level. Senator Levin had mentioned the threat assessment. The people I represent, the threat is omnipresent and telling people in one area that their threat is not real in an era where, as September 11 showed, even the inconceivable is possible, just is not something that I can get away with saying in Minnesota and I defer to my colleagues elsewhere. I also want to address later the Transportation Security Agency. One thing we are all experts on is flying and getting in and out of airports and the like, and while there have been some improvements there since pre-September 11, there is also, in my view, as a result of some of the management decisions that have been made, less than optimal performance and consistency there. So again, I will look forward to the chance to question you and thank you very much for your dedication to our country. Chairman Collins. Thank you. Senator Domenici. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR DOMENICI Senator Domenici. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Judge Chertoff, I didn't ask you to come up and visit with me before you came here to testify because I had no reason to interview you. I already know you. I will have ample time in this hearing to discuss issues as I see them for my State and we will probably do that in the next couple of days. I want to hearken back for a minute to about 6 years ago. I was visiting with then-President Clinton. He asked me if I would talk with him about a problem and give him some suggestions. The problem was the Immigration Service and the Border Patrol and he said, ``Senator, do you have any ideas on how to fix it up?'' Frankly, I said, I wish you could have asked me about any other thing. I just don't know the answer. Our borders are so broken that I don't know what to do about it. Well, we haven't fixed it. We just packaged it up and gave it to DHS, and then we gave it an additional concern in that we now live in an era of terrorism and our borders take on a huge new level of importance. I tell you that only because, Judge, you will have an enormous job at DHS. Many of the pieces that we put together in the Department are not functioning properly now, and it will be very difficult to make them function after you inherit them, so I wish you the best. I hope you know that most of what you have to do is manage a monster. I don't know who the President could have nominated that would have been a natural worldwide, renowned manager. He had a choice and he picked you, not because you are a worldwide, renowned manager, but because you are a very committed citizen. You are very intelligent and every government job you have had, you have done very well. You understand the law, and law enforcement, and that is a big part of this job, so I wish you the very best. There is no doubt in my mind that you will do it well. But I don't want to join the chorus here who says you need more money. You may need more money, but what we need to do is make sure that you tell us what things you have to do and what things you don't think you have to do, and I must say they are not always consistent with Congress's wishes. That is why I won't talk to you about how you are going to distribute money in terms of first responders. If I were to make you respond to that question today, you might get some Senators angry enough that they wouldn't vote for you on the floor, because the truth of the matter is, you can't distribute first responder money the way all the Senators want it distributed. Some first responder requests do not pose a significant enough risk to be funded. You know that, and you will find it out more the longer you are in office, without question. I expect you, without telling us how today, to not address every risk that everybody tells you is a threat. I expect you to find a security plan, an overall strategy that tells us how to assess risks, how to fund them and which ones are real threats. Every first responder request is not responding to a risk that is worth funding, no question about it. Everybody that clamors for first responder money knows that, but they want money, even for things that aren't necessarily risks we should be taking care of. I close with a little story. When I was 16, I had a very bad bone problem with one of my legs. The doctor told my mother that I shouldn't walk around too much, and over exert my leg, and she said, ``Oh, don't worry. I will never let him move.'' And the doctor said, ``Well, if you overdo this, you could put him in bed and leave him there, and one day you could wake up to find that he has fallen out of bed and has broken his neck.'' So you can't eliminate every risk. I thank you very much for trying. Do the best you can, and good luck. Chairman Collins. Thank you, Senator Domenici, though I am not quite sure what the moral of that story is. [Laughter.] I appreciate your comments. We are very pleased this morning to be joined by two of our distinguished colleagues who are here to present the nominee. Senator Lautenberg is a Member of the Committee, as well, so I would first want to see if he has opening comments that he would like to give and then call upon him to begin the introduction of the nominee. I would note to Judge Chertoff that you are very fortunate to have two such distinguished Members here with you today. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR LAUTENBERG Senator Lautenberg. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman. This might be considered double-dipping because first I get to make my statement and then I get to introduce our distinguished guest and friend. On September 11, 2001, 700 of the Americans who lost their lives were from our home State of New Jersey. The people of North Jersey could see the smoke rising from the World Trade Centers. The New York-New Jersey region was attacked on that terrible day and our region continues to be most at risk of terrorist attack. This morning, there was a plane crash at Teterboro Airport, a very busy commercial airport in our State, and as I listened to the report on TV, the first questions that seemed to arise from the commentators was whether this was sabotage or terrorism. It shows you the sensitivity. If this had happened elsewhere in the country, I doubt that question would have been raised. But when you look at the region where the tragedy struck on September 11 in such proportion that we are still in shock over that day, it tells you something. Judge Chertoff and I have discussed the FBI's finding that the two-mile stretch between the Port of Newark and Newark Liberty International Airport is one of the most at-risk areas in the entire Nation for terrorist attack. That ought to be a top priority for protection. Now, Michael Chertoff understands that risk and vulnerability must be the principal yardsticks. I saw his head shaking positively as Senator Levin talked about that and others about the risk factor. Right now, funds are not being distributed strictly on the basis of risk and vulnerability. But I am confident that Judge Chertoff knows that needs to be changed. One of the recommendations in the 9/11 Commission report states, ``Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities and should not remain a program for general revenue sharing.'' So Senator Corzine and I are drafting a bill to require that all homeland security grants for terrorism prevention and preparedness be based on relative risk, threats, and vulnerabilities, and our bill will follow the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. It will give the Secretary of Homeland Security the discretion and the authority necessary to distribute Federal resources to those areas that are most at risk and I hope that we will have the support of then-Secretary Chertoff. So I look forward to working with him on meeting the homeland security needs of New Jersey and the entire Nation. Madam Chairman, do I slip into my introduction at this point? Chairman Collins. That would be great. Senator Lautenberg. I thank you, because we are so pleased that President Bush has nominated a kind of hometown fellow from New Jersey. Judge Michael Chertoff is one so well suited for this critical position of Secretary of Homeland Security. He has the intellect, we understand that, both academically and as a member of the Court of Appeals. We have seen him in several positions. I had the good fortune to have recommended Judge Chertoff three times. In this case, it is three times and you are in. We are so lucky to have someone like Michael Chertoff who can come in and take on this task following Secretary Ridge's very arduous task and getting the framework established in the first place. It still has plenty to go, as Michael Chertoff knows, and he is prepared to take on that task. Judge Chertoff has the experience to be an excellent Homeland Security Secretary, lengthy background in law enforcement, keen understanding of New Jersey and America's homeland security. Judge Chertoff was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and distinguished himself academically as an undergraduate and law student at Harvard. After graduating from law school, he served as a law clerk to Judge Murray Gurfein on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Following his clerkship on the Second Circuit, Judge Chertoff served as a clerk to a legendary Justice from our home State, U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan. In 1990, Judge Chertoff became the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. During his tenure, which lasted 4 years, he aggressively attacked organized crime, public corruption, health care, and bank fraud. And I particularly appreciate the critical role that he has held in New Jersey, getting the State Legislature to investigate racial profiling in our State. There was an expression that driving while black should not be a crime, and it was a reference to a casual process that had people being stopped for no reason other than the fact that they were people of color. That propelled the bill that I introduced in the Senate to ban racial profiling. Based on his past performance in so many different jobs, I am confident that Judge Michael Chertoff will be a strong, effective leader of the Department of Homeland Security and I am also confident that he will make sure that States under actual risk and threat of terrorism, including our own home State, obviously, get an appropriate share of Homeland Security funding. It does matter. We have seen reductions in funding in two of our major cities, Jersey City and Newark, substantial reductions, and overall, a reduction of some 30 percent in funding available. We desperately need that help to cope with so many problems that we have in the region. Madam Chairman, you know that Judge Chertoff currently serves on the prestigious U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and I think a good measure of his commitment to public service, as was said by others, is to give up a lifelong appointment on the second-highest court in the land to accept President Bush's call to duty. So, Chairman Collins and fellow Committee Members, I strongly support Judge Chertoff's nomination. I am proud of him and proud of the fact that he is going to have a chance to serve, bringing his full skills and abilities of considerable proportion to do this job. I urge this Committee to report the nomination to the full Senate as soon as possible and I thank you, Madam Chairman. Chairman Collins. Thank you, Senator. Your endorsement means a great deal to this Committee on which you have served so well. Senator Corzine. STATEMENT OF HON. JON CORZINE,\\1\\ A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY Senator Corzine. Thank you, Madam Chairman and Ranking Member Lieberman, and to all the Committee, thank you for allowing me to join in both recommending and endorsing his candidacy and speaking up for an individual who I deeply believe will do an outstanding job as the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The prepared statement of Senator Corzine appears in the Appendix on page 65. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I will say that, hearkening back to the Morris Udall comment that whatever could be said has been said except by who is saying it, so I will be brief and I will submit my formal statement for the record. Before I do that, though, I do want to make a couple of comments. First of all, I want to congratulate this Committee for taking on the intelligence reform issue and driving it to conclusion. I think the leadership, both of the Chairman and the Ranking Member and those on the Committee, has been extraordinary service to the country, as well as the efforts of Secretary Ridge in serving as the initial leader of this. So I think those need to be said. I am sitting next to a remarkable individual. He is one of the most able lawyers I think America has. Senator Lautenberg talked about his credentials. He is intelligent, and as we heard in the 9/11 Commission, we need imagination to be able to deal in protecting the American people. No one, I think, will bring greater intelligence and imagination to this effort than Judge Chertoff. I know him as an honorable and impartial man. Sometimes people will use that he is a tough, straight shooter. I think that is what we need in this position. He will call them as he sees them. I think the idea that he has demonstrated, as others have mentioned, that he is prepared to give up a lifetime appointment to take on a job that will come with lots of rocks and stones and bows and arrows from all of us is a statement to how committed he is to public service. This is the third time I have sat at a table recommending Judge Chertoff. I have to admit he is a personal friend and I like the idea he is from New Jersey. But I think this is one of America's most able public servants. I know you are going to ask questions about detention. You are going to ask questions about torture memos and other issues. I will refer back to the work that I saw done at the New Jersey State Senate level with regard to racial profiling. It was a test of balancing, protecting the American public, or protecting the New Jersey public and our civil liberties. No one could have done that more intelligently and then worked to try to create legislation that would bring that to be addressed in a way that really searched for the right balance. I have read some of the writings, I have reviewed some of the speeches, and I have had personal conversations about this search for the right balance that, Judge Chertoff, we will certainly talk to you about. I don't think there is anybody better to be looking for this. Finally, I would just say this is a focused individual, policy-based, objective. I think we need to follow the 9/11 Commission's recommendation on threat and vulnerability assessments. I would like to make that case in the context of New Jersey. As Senator Lautenberg said, we have got this two- mile stretch. Whatever the outcome is, we really need to make sure that we are allocating those scarce resources that Senator Domenici talked about based on the optimization of protecting the American people on threat and vulnerability. I think this is a man that will do it. I have to lobby for something that I have been fighting for on chemical plant security. We have seen in recent rail issues that the vulnerability that is associated with our infrastructure can be deadly just in its normal course of events, let alone within the context of a terrorist attack. I hope that when it comes to setting priorities, we will all work to help Judge Chertoff deal with something that I know that he will imbue in how he goes about making his judgments, and I hope we will all help him in the day-to-day operations, the managerial issues that I think come from a colossally difficult job in managing 180,000 people in all of these 22 groups. I think this is the individual that will do as good a job as anybody who could be put forward and I proudly recommend him to the Committee. I hope you will ask great questions about this balancing issue because I think it is the question of our time, but I do think we have the right person and I recommend him. Thank you. Chairman Collins. Thank you very much, Senator. I would be happy to have Senator Lautenberg come join us on the panel and I would be happy to excuse Senator Corzine if you do need to leave to go on to other events. We thank you very much for being here today to present the nominee. Judge Chertoff has filed responses to a biographical and financial questionnaire, answered pre-hearing questions submitted by the Committee, and had his financial statements reviewed by the Office of Government Ethics. Without objection, this information will be made part of the hearing record, with the exception of the financial data, which are on file and available for public inspection in the Committee offices. Our Committee rules require that all witnesses at nomination hearings give their testimony under oath, so Judge Chertoff, I would ask that you stand and raise your right hand. Do you swear the testimony you are about to give the Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God? Judge Chertoff. I do. Chairman Collins. Thank you. Judge Chertoff, I understand that you have some family members present and I would invite you to present them to the Committee at this time. Judge Chertoff. Actually, my wife, Meryl, is present. She is sitting right behind me. Chairman Collins. We welcome you to the Committee today. Judge Chertoff. I do have two children. They are at home and they should be in school. [Laughter.] We will find out when I get back. Chairman Collins. Do you have a statement you would like to make at this time? If so, please proceed with your statement. TESTIMONY OF HON. MICHAEL CHERTOFF,\\1\\ TO BE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY Judge Chertoff. Thank you. Chairman Collins, Ranking Member Lieberman, and Members of the Committee, I am pleased to appear before this Committee as you consider the President's nomination of me to be Secretary of Homeland Security. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The prepared statement of Judge Chertoff appears in the Appendix on page 72. The biographical information and pre-hearing questionnaire of Judge Chertoff appears in the Appendix on page 74. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I want to begin by thanking my family, whom we have just mentioned, for their support and sacrifice. I also want to thank Senators Lautenberg and Corzine for their introductions. I have known them and I have been friends with them for a long time. They are distinguished public servants and their praise means a great deal to me professionally and personally. I was deeply honored by the President's decision to nominate me to be Secretary of DHS. As I said at the time of the announcement, if confirmed, I would feel privileged to serve with the thousands of men and women who stand watch protecting America's security and promoting America's freedom. Since September 11, 2001, the challenge of our generation has been to defend our country against the evil of terrorism while honoring our fundamental commitment to liberties and privacy. We must work together to preserve an America that is safe, secure, and free. I want to take this opportunity very briefly to outline some of the experiences which I will bring to bear if I am confirmed as Secretary of DHS. As Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice from 2001 to 2003, I shared in the management of the Department during and in the wake of the attacks of September 11. As a consequence, I have had the rare experience of managing a critical government organization under the stress of a national emergency. I became fully familiar with the central elements of the war against terrorism, the strategic response, the need to break down barriers to intelligence sharing, the imperative of cooperating with other agencies, including what became the Department of Homeland Security, and the importance of negotiating cooperation with our State and local government officials and our counterparts overseas. While serving as the head of the Criminal Division, I was required to evaluate information from many intelligence agencies as a prerequisite to operational decisionmaking. As a result, the values and the limitations of intelligence are familiar to me as a manager. Additionally, I reconfigured many of our component sections to push resources into the field and to increase our operational capacity. My style is to lead by example, and that includes a willingness to get into and understand the challenges faced in the field. I have also dealt directly with the issue of security at a State and local level. As a young prosecutor, I worked closely with agents from services which have now become part of DHS, including the Customs Service and the Secret Service, and with first responders, such as State police and local police. As a United States Attorney in the 1990's, State and local officials joined me in fashioning a comprehensive response to addressing urban crime and social problems under programs such as Weed and Seed. I have learned to appreciate the perspectives of State and local officials because I have shared their vantage point, and just as important, from my vantage point on September 11 and in the weeks and months that followed, along with everyone else in America, I saw and honored the heroism and sacrifice of fire fighters, police, and other emergency response professionals. If confirmed, I look forward to working with them to make the great promise of this still young Department a reality for them and those they serve. I also believe the Secretary of Homeland Security will have to be mindful of the need to reconcile the imperatives of security with the preservation of liberty and privacy. As an attorney representing indigent defendants, as a legislative counsel examining racial profiling, and as a U.S. Circuit Court judge, I have committed to fostering liberty and privacy. If confirmed, I will draw on this background to promote measures that enhance our security while affirming our constitutional values. Finally, the cornerstone of my leadership philosophy has always been this: Respect those with whom you work. That means invite candid discussion and advice, make prompt decisions, articulate clear goals, expect accountability, and reward service. If I am confirmed as Secretary, we will work as a Department to improve our technology, strengthen our management practices, secure our borders and transportation systems, and most important, focus each and every day on keeping America safe from attacks. I will be privileged to strive under the leadership of President Bush to accomplish these goals. I will also look forward to working with this Committee and with Congress in pursuit of our shared goal of keeping America secure and free. I cannot promise perfection in our efforts, but I can promise we will work tirelessly and do everything within the law to keep our Nation safe. I will be pleased to answer questions from this Committee. Thank you. Chairman Collins. Thank you, Judge Chertoff. There are three standard questions that the Committee asks of all nominees and I would like to dispose of those first. First, is there anything that you are aware of in your background which might present a conflict of interest with the duties of the office to which you have been nominated? Judge Chertoff. No. Chairman Collins. Second, do you know of anything personal or otherwise that would in any way prevent you from fully and honorably discharging the responsibilities of the office to which you have been nominated? Judge Chertoff. No. Chairman Collins. Third, do you agree without reservation to respond to any reasonable summons to appear and testify before any duly constituted Committee of Congress if you are confirmed? Judge Chertoff. Yes. Chairman Collins. And Judge, I am going to add a fourth question because this was brought up by several Members. The Committee has several ongoing investigations involving the Department of Homeland Security and many of us have experienced difficulties in gaining access to information and individuals during the course of our investigations, so I am going to ask you, do you agree to cooperate with the Committee's investigations? Judge Chertoff. Yes. Chairman Collins. Thank you, Judge. We will now start the first round of questions. They will be limited to 8 minutes each. I want to assure each of our Members that there will be a second round, so I would ask you to adhere to the 8 minutes so that every Member gets to speak before it gets too late in the day. But there will be a second round. Judge Chertoff, many of the Members of this Committee have mentioned that you are giving up a very prestigious judicial appointment, a lifetime appointment on one of the most prestigious courts in the country in order to take over a troubled Department, a Department that has experienced and undoubtedly will experience growing pains. I want to start my questioning by asking you, why are you willing to give up your very secure position to take on such an extraordinarily difficult job? Judge Chertoff. Senator, thank you for the question. I want to begin by saying that the nomination and confirmation by the Senate of my appointment as a circuit judge was the high point of my professional life and I have loved every minute of my service on the Court of Appeals. But September 11 and the challenge it posed was, at least by my lights, the greatest challenge of my generation and it is one which touched me both personally and in my work at the Department of Justice. The call to serve in helping to protect America is the one call I could not decline, and I have to say, since having begun the process with the announcement by the President of his intent to nominate me, I have been privileged as I travel back and forth from home to Washington, D.C., to have people come up to me and express how much they care about the work of the Department and how important it is to them. I think they have a sense of ownership, unlike any I have ever experienced, and that has redoubled my sense that it was right for me, if I can add value and make a contribution, to put my personal considerations aside and to accept this challenge. Chairman Collins. Judge, speaking as one Senator, I am very impressed with your commitment and your willingness to make that sacrifice for your country. I think it reflects a deep commitment to public service for which I salute you. In your responses to the Committee's pre-hearing questionnaire, you talked about the balance that I mentioned in my opening statement between liberty and security. In a speech that you gave at Rutgers Law School in 2003, you discussed the balance between the government's need to exercise emergency powers in times of crisis with the need to protect civil liberties and you said the following, ``Measures that are easily accepted in the sudden response to overwhelming crisis demand somewhat greater testing in the light of experience. In the heat of the battle, the decision maker has to rely on foresight because he has no hindsight. We should, therefore, not judge him in hindsight, but at the same time, when hindsight does become available, we would be foolish if we did not take advantage of its lessons for the future.'' You were involved in developing the Justice Department's investigative strategy in the immediate aftermath of the attacks on our country. In your view, looking back now, did the Department strike the right balance in the policies that it pursued? Judge Chertoff. Senator, let me begin by making the principle I believe in very clear. I believe that we cannot live in liberty without security, but we would not want to live in security without liberty. So we need both of those to fashion the architecture of our civilization going forward. I believe in the response to September 11, the Department, at least speaking from my vantage point, did everything we could to strike the right balance. But I also know the lesson of history is, as I said in the speech, dealing in a crisis, particularly an unexpected crisis, fashioning a response with the tools that we have at hand, there are inevitably going to be imperfections, and the critical thing is to learn from things that experience teaches us. In response to our efforts after September 11, I think there has been considerable review of that, for example, by the Inspector General. I have appreciated the opportunity to look at what the Inspector General found and I think there are some lessons which we have learned and can continue to learn as we attempt to get ever closer to what I think is that ideal balance between liberty and security. Chairman Collins. Judge, one of the greatest challenges that I believe that you will face is strengthening the security of our ports. This is an area that I do believe has not received the attention it deserves nor the funding that is needed. The Coast Guard, for example, has estimated that implementing the Maritime Transportation Security Act would cost $7.3 billion over 10 years, yet in the current fiscal year, the Department of Homeland Security will distribute only $150 million in port security grants. That is a huge gap. But that is a major step forward, believe it or not. That was the first budget in which there was funding that exceeded $100 million. We have three ports in my home State, including the economically strategic port in Maine's largest city of Portland. They still have significant needs in terms of port security. I hear from the director of the port that there is not enough flexibility in the system nor enough funding. In response to written questions from the Committee, you noted that this is an important area. Can you tell me what you plan to do to improve the security of our ports and will you push for more funding? Judge Chertoff. Well, I am acutely aware, because I also come from a State which has major ports, of how important the issue of ports are from a standpoint of our security. I know the Department has already taken steps forward in terms of the screening and inspection of cargo. I know the Coast Guard has taken steps to improve port security. But I know we have a lot left to do. My general philosophy on all of these issues of protecting our vulnerable infrastructure is to be disciplined about identifying and prioritizing so that we are not spending all of our effort on one type of infrastructure, for example, aviation, and neglecting other parts, such as ports and cargo. I do think we need to be flexible. I think we have to have a formula for funding and a formula for lending assistance to State and local governments across the board that takes account of the reality of vulnerabilities and risks in making sure that we are making a fair allocation, and I think we need to encourage feedback to make sure we are on the right path. Chairman Collins. I recently visited our Nation's two largest ports in California, Los Angeles and Long Beach. Those two ports alone handle some 43 percent of all the containers coming into our country. Just a couple of days after I left, an alert crane operator spotted 32 Chinese nationals in two separate containers who had been smuggled into the country. That really concerns me, because if the smugglers of illegal aliens know to use the container system, then surely al Qaeda has identified that as a possible means of smuggling an al Qaeda cell into our country. Despite all the high-tech cameras and other surveillance techniques and the Department's screening programs, none of those caught these illegal Chinese citizens. It was, in fact, an alert crane operator. What does that say about the effectiveness of the programs that we have now to ensure that containers have cargo that is harmless to our country and important to our commerce rather than containing threats to our country, such as the makings of a dirty bomb or even terrorists themselves? Judge Chertoff. I share your concern about the story. I read it. I don't know the facts. I think every time there is an instance where we find a penetration of our security, whether it be people coming in through containers or people slipping things into airports, it raises a concern in my mind. It seems to me these are opportunities to learn. We need to go back and see what this tells us about something that we are not doing and then we ought to make adjustments. And one of the things I would hope to do if confirmed is set about finding out with respect to this and other instances what the lesson is. Chairman Collins. Thank you. Senator Lieberman. Senator Lieberman. Thanks, Madam Chairman. Thanks, Judge Chertoff. I want to go to some of the questions that have been raised about things that happened that you may have been involved in while you were head of the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice post-September 11. After September 11 and the attacks, do you recall participating in the development of the investigative strategy at the Department of Justice that led to the detention of a large number of people on immigration violations, I believe over 760 people? Judge Chertoff. Yes. Senator Lieberman. In April 2003, the Inspector General for the Department of Justice determined that there had been wrongdoing in the carrying out of that policy, and that many of the detainees had been encountered by investigators coincidentally with no connections to leads on terrorism. Others were detained based on anonymous tips from the public suspicious of Arab or Muslim neighbors who, in their opinion, were keeping unusual schedules. Once detained, a significant number of the individuals were not allowed to call their lawyers or their family, and according to the IG, some were physically abused. The detainees were held for an average of 80 days, according to the IG's report, primarily because of FBI delays in clearing them, and in the end, none of the detainees were charged in connection with terrorist activities. Needless to say, I, and I know most everybody who read the IG's report, was very troubled by the findings. I wanted to ask you now what was your reaction to the report, whether you think mistakes were made in the carrying out of that strategy that you helped devise at the Justice Department. Judge Chertoff. I am happy to answer that, Senator, and if I may, just for a moment, to set the context of the policy as I participated in formulating it. Senator Lieberman. Please. Judge Chertoff. I remember very vividly in the couple of days after September 11 being struck by the fact that 19 hijackers had seamlessly gotten into the country, gotten on airplanes, and with the exception of the heroism of the passengers in the last plane, had carried out their missions. Based on my experience investigating, it seemed obvious to me that there was a likelihood that there were other people in the country who had assisted them, wittingly or unwittingly, in carrying out their mission. I also thought, based on the history of al Qaeda, there was a very serious risk that there were going to be other attacks, including, to be honest, attacks that would be worse than September 11. So the objective, as I saw it, and I think this was generally shared, was to begin the kind of investigation we would normally do but compressed in a very tight time frame and on a huge scale, using in many cases agents who had never had prior experience with terrorism. And the mandate that went out was, follow all of the leads that are generated by the hijackers and their behavior. For example, if we found pocket litter in a rent-a-car that had been used by a hijacker and there are phone numbers, follow the numbers, credit card receipts. Senator Lieberman. Right. Judge Chertoff. So that was the plan as conceived and I think that it was a reasonable plan under the circumstances. What I did not participate in was the actual decisionmaking about where people should be detained or how they should be housed. I did read the IG report when it came out and I was troubled to see that certainly the plan as conceived had not always been executed perfectly. For example, I understand from the report that there were agents who sometimes perhaps took a tip without much foundation and used that as a basis to pursue investigation. I understand that because I know that, particularly in New York, people were laboring under the emotional stress of seeing their colleagues killed, under very difficult physical conditions. But clearly, that is something that is regrettable. I understand, in fact, was informed at the time there were delays in clearing people, the idea being that everybody who was arrested was in violation of the law, so they were lawful arrests---- Senator Lieberman. They were, and let me just clarify, in violation of immigration---- Judge Chertoff. Immigration or criminal laws. Senator Lieberman. Right. Judge Chertoff. And everybody who was detained was detained in accordance with the law, but nevertheless, the policy was to try to clear people as quickly as possible so that we no longer had to argue to keep them detained. I understand that process was slower. In fact, I raised it a couple of times with the FBI during the process. But again, they were operating from a position of simply never having had to contend with this kind of pressure. As far as the reports by the Inspector General concerning people not getting access to lawyers, that was, frankly, not something I was aware of at the time. That is clearly not something that should have happened. And to the extent that there were instances of guards acting in an improper fashion, that is also clearly inappropriate and my understanding is that, I think, probably is under investigation as we speak. Senator Lieberman. I appreciate your answer. I must say, the part of the IG's report that most agitated me was the fact that people would be held without a right to counsel, which is such a fundamental right in the United States. I appreciate your saying that you thought that was a mistake. Let me ask you now, as you approach becoming leader of the Department in which the Immigration and Naturalization Service and other entities associated with immigrants are located, what would you do to ensure that similar abuses do not occur again in the future? Judge Chertoff. Well, I know, first of all, that the Inspector General recommended a series of steps. His report came out, I think, a matter of days before I left for the bench, but I believe that some of those proposals had already been put into effect. Others, there was a commitment to put into effect. So clearly, we have to again learn the lessons and put into effect protocols to prevent these kinds of issues from arising again. Part of it is intelligence and training. Frankly, if we have better databases and people are better trained, and I believe that has happened, the ability to identify who really has a link to terrorism and who doesn't is going to be enhanced. So that is going to eliminate or reduce one set of problems. It also will make the clearance problem become diminished because we will have a better ability to get at databases. We won't be wondering if we have complete information. I think to the extent, and I think this applies across the board, to the extent we deal with people who are properly and lawfully detained because of legal violations, there should never be any possibility of those people being mistreated by guards. I think that if a clear message is sent through the investigative and disciplinary process, people will understand that a person is presumed innocent. And even if we need to detain somebody in accordance with the law because we are investigating the possibility of involvement with terrorism, that is not an excuse or a license to mistreat that person. Senator Lieberman. I thank you again for that. Let me say to you that in the aftermath of September 11, as you well know, there was and continues to be a lot of agitation about the Patriot Act and how it was used to abuse individual freedoms. I personally find some but little evidence of that. But I do find some significant evidence that deprivations of due process and rights occurred, as in this case, under immigration law, and that, in fact, immigration law is greatly lacking in some of the fundamental due process protections that we associate with what it means to be American or be in America and enjoy American protections. I would just finally ask you if you would consider, with everything else we are asking you to do, to bring to bear in this new position your law enforcement, your legal, and your judicial experience to recommend to the Congress and to the administration steps that can be taken to improve the existence of due process in the conduct of our immigration laws. Judge Chertoff. I would certainly like to work on that, Senator. Senator Lieberman. Thank you. Chairman Collins. Thank you. Senator Warner. Senator Warner. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Judge, I am privileged to kind of step in every now and then and help the District of Columbia with its problems, and during the course of the inauguration, the District of Columbia, in coordination with Virginia and Maryland, really stepped up and did a marvelous job on the questions of security and other costs associated with it. You need not respond to this question because your able staff, whom I know quite well, right behind you are going to take notes. But there is a question on the funding and the reimbursement. The budgets of the District are quite stretched and I want to speak up on behalf of the Mayor and the citizens and the security team that he put forth in this and see if we can't ask your staff to reconcile that situation. Likewise, the Congressional delegations of Maryland and Virginia, working with the Representative for D.C., Eleanor Holmes Norton, we put in an amendment to the homeland defense legislation establishing the Office of the National Capital Region. It is basically to coordinate issues regarding homeland defense. At some point, not the first week or the second week, but at some point, take a look at that because this region has the pride of the Nation's capital. So much of the infrastructure of our government is in the two States and the Nation's capital. I think that it needs to be taken a look at and see if you can give it a little personal attention. In due course, you will have the responsibility of determining whether your current infrastructure space is adequate. I represent to you I will be glad to help you on that. I think probably some improvement is needed. Your predecessor, who did an admirable job, did the best he could in a very short period of time. And on other budget matters, I would hope to work with the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee. If you think there is additional funding needed, let us bring it to the attention of this Committee and see what we can do to work it out. Today's Washington Post carried a very interesting article by a highly recognized and respected journalist. I don't know whether you have had a chance to look at it or not, but I was rather intrigued here on your opening day to be greeted by this valentine that dropped on your desk. [Laughter.] It has got a number of critical points in here, but one that really caught my eye, and I will repeat it, ``Two arms of the Department are gridlocked over efforts to secure hazardous chemicals on trains.'' Well, regrettably, we have witnessed here recently two incidents where there was a very tragic situation on trains. Can you represent to us that you will move that agenda item up---- Judge Chertoff. Yes. Senator Warner [continuing]. And take a good look at it? Judge Chertoff. I will. Senator Warner. Trains are very difficult to put secure. We saw that tragic incident of the individual who presumably had a mental problem and now caused the death of a lot of people. Our Nation's railroads are absolutely a central part of the infrastructure and we have got to improve it. Another point, and I am just going to ask this question just forthright, and that is, again, we both served in the prosecutor's office and I watched with great interest when you prosecuted cases in my State of Virginia as a Federal prosecutor in the area of terrorism. Time and time again, the issue of the identification of terrorists comes up. I think you have got to face up to this question of the national I.D. card and what this Nation should do about it. Have you got some views that you would share with us this morning on that tough issue? Judge Chertoff. Well, Senator, I know it is a tough issue. I know that there is legislation, I think in the Intelligence Reform Act, that talks about setting national standards for drivers' licenses. Senator Warner. Yes. That is sort of a fallback, in a way. Judge Chertoff. Whether or not the country ultimately decides it wants to move to some more standardized identification, I think what I have observed certainly as a citizen over the years, my own experience has been that the drivers' license has become in many respects the standard identifying document. In fact, I remember trying to get into--I won't even mention the agencies, but certain buildings using my credentials and people saying, no, I want to see your driver's license instead. That suggested the reality is, at a minimum, we need to make sure that drivers' licenses are reliable. There is no, it seems to me, argument in favor of having unreliable licenses. So I certainly look forward to working on that. As to the larger issue, because I know it is complicated, it is something I would certainly want to study and consider very carefully. Senator Warner. Well, there are tremendous advancements in the technical community as to how to take certain, whether it is your eyes, your fingerprints, or so forth, and make that I.D. a very credible instrument and one that does not lend itself to forgery or wrongful duplication. You said if the country decides. You can't sit around waiting for the country to decide. Somebody has got to stand up and let the brickbats come at them and make the recommendation and hopefully the Congress will step up to that tough decision and give you the support that you feel the issue deserves. I think that the terrorists have an agenda for this Nation and I think the work that has been done by Secretary Ridge and others has heavily contributed to deterring a major attack. But we will have to sleep with one eye open for the indefinite future and I feel very comfortable with you there. You are kind of like the boxer sitting in his corner and that bell is ringing and when you come out, you start swinging, because this article this morning points out that apparently more clout is needed, and you understand what clout is. Judge Chertoff. I do. Senator Warner. You do, and you don't need this Committee to put that definition before you. You are ready to exercise it and see that your cabinet position elevates itself and you take on the Secretary of Defense, is that correct? Judge Chertoff. I am prepared to use every faculty at my command to make sure that we get the job done. Senator Warner. Thank you, sir. With that, I think I will yield back my time. Chairman Collins. Thank you, Senator. Senator Levin. Senator Levin. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Judge Chertoff, the 9/11 Commission said the following about the allocation of homeland security funds. ``Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities,'' Do you agree? Judge Chertoff. That is my philosophy, yes. Senator Levin. Now, there are a number of questions which have been raised about your actions when you were head of the Criminal Division and I would like to spend the balance of my time this first round on those issues. I think you have acknowledged having conversations from time to time with lawyers from agencies outside of the Department of Justice who were seeking advice related to specific interrogation techniques. Was the CIA one of those agencies that talked to you? Judge Chertoff. I think, Senator, and this is the position I took with the staff, I did speak with lawyers for the intelligence community. I don't know that identifying a specific agency is--might be getting into betraying a confidence, which I feel that I am kind of committed to honor. I am certainly, though, and I have indicated that I will be pleased to indicate what my position was and what I communicated to those lawyers. Senator Levin. OK, and we will get to that. Does the Federal statute that prohibits torture, 18 U.S. Code 2340, apply to the CIA? Judge Chertoff. My understanding is that the statute applies to official action. I don't have the statute in front of me. I have a recollection that there is a geographic limitation to the statute, but I may be wrong about that. Senator Levin. But that it applies to--I think you are wrong about that, but that it does apply to all employees of the Federal Government? Judge Chertoff. My understanding is it applies to any official action. I think it also applies to foreign official action. Senator Levin. Now, the statute defines torture as, ``an act committed by a person acting under the color of law, specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering upon another person within his custody or physical control.'' A memorandum interpreting that statute by the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, which was not your division but nevertheless you are familiar with it, obviously, that memorandum was prepared for White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales on August 1, 2002. It defined, ``severe physical pain or suffering'' as pain rising to the ``level that would ordinarily be associated with a sufficiently serious physical condition or injury, such as death, organ failure, or serious impairment of bodily functions.'' You said in your answers to pre-hearing questions that the Office of Legal Counsel showed you a draft of what you, ``believe developed into the August 1 memorandum'' to obtain your views on how a prosecutor might apply the anti-torture law in a practical sense. Is that accurate? Judge Chertoff. That is correct. Senator Levin. All right. Now, do you agree with the definition of torture contained in the August 1, 2002, memo? Judge Chertoff. Let me begin by saying, first of all, of course, torture is illegal, so we begin with that proposition. And, in fact, the President has said that on a number of occasions. Second, I don't--since I saw a draft of what I believe became this memo, I don't remember if that language was in it or whether it was used as or purported to be kind of a bottom- line definition. Senator Levin. My question is do you agree, not did you. I will get to the ``did'' in a moment. Judge Chertoff. With that as a--I do not believe that definition is a sufficiently comprehensive definition of torture. Senator Levin. All right. Now, let us go back in time. Did you object to the definition in the memo in 2002? Judge Chertoff. As I say, because I don't remember the way it was specifically worded, I can tell you that my role in dealing with the memo was limited to this. I was asked to communicate what my views were as a kind of practical prosecutor about how a statute like the torture statute would be applied, and my essential position--and again, this is talking to other lawyers so it is really lawyer-to-lawyer kind of discussion--was that when you are dealing with a statute with a general standard and an intent issue, the question of good faith and an honest and reasonable assessment of what you are doing becomes critical and whether or not a particular type of thing that someone proposes to do violates the statute is going to depend on whether a prosecutor views it as a violation of the statute is going to depend a great deal upon whether the particular technique is specifically mentioned in the statute, or if it is not, whether the people who are thinking about doing it are making an honest assessment about whether what they are going to do rises to the level of the statute. I guess my bottom-line advice was this. You are dealing in an area where there is potential criminal liability. You had better be very careful to make sure that whatever it is you decide to do falls well within what is required by the law. Senator Levin. Wasn't the main purpose of that memo to address the definition of torture? How could that issue not have come up? Judge Chertoff. It is--again, since I was not involved in the process of how the memo was generated, I can't tell you why it was generated or what the purpose was. And, of course, to the extent there was scholarship done or review of cases or legal materials, I had no involvement in that and frankly don't know what those were. I could only give the practical advice that I have, I guess, based on my experience over the years in dealing with this kind of statute, and that advice was very simple. You are dealing with a definition which in some respects is general. There is an intent issue in the case. You had better be sure that you have good faith and you have operated diligently to make sure what you are considering doing is well within the law. Senator Levin. Last weekend, the New York Times reported that you were consulted on several occasions by the CIA as to whether CIA officers risked prosecution by using particular interrogation techniques. The article stated that, ``one technique that CIA officers could use under certain circumstances without fear of prosecution was strapping a subject down and making him experience a feeling of drowning.'' Now, it is unclear whether or not they are quoting somebody as saying that was your comment, but nonetheless, that is in the article. Do you believe that the technique which was described in the New York Times article violates the statute? Judge Chertoff. Again, and this is--I am confident I was consistent about this on the handful of occasions this question came up. As a prosecutor, and in dealing with lawyers, as a prosecutor, institutionally, my position was not to give advance advice about what you can do. It was to look at a historic state of facts and then determine whether the statute applies. So I was not prepared to say to people, to approve things in advance or to give people speculative opinions that they might later take as some kind of a license to do something. My position was limited to making sure people understood-- and these are lawyers I am talking to--that what is critical here is the honest good faith assessment by these people of what the effects of what they are doing is and how it measures against the statute. Senator Levin. Let me just wind this question up because I am almost out of time. Were you asked whether or not that technique, the use of that technique, would subject the user to prosecution? Specifically, were you asked? Judge Chertoff. I am sure a number of techniques were mentioned to me. It is sometimes difficult now in retrospect to know what I was told at the time versus what I have now read in the copious discussion in the press. But I can tell you that whatever was mentioned to me at the time, my answer was exactly the same. I am not in a position to evaluate a set of facts based on a hypothetical circumstance. I will tell you, if you are dealing with something that makes you nervous, you better make sure that you are doing the right thing and you better check it out and that means doing honest and diligent examination of what you are doing and not really putting your head in the sand and turning a blind eye. Senator Levin. To summarize, you would not, then, have given a yes or no answer to that question? Judge Chertoff. Correct. Senator Levin. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Chairman Collins. Thank you. Senator Coleman. Senator Coleman. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I am just going to touch briefly on the torture issue just so it is clear and it is very clear for the record here and it is certainly clear in your answers. You stated the President has said that, ``torture is wrong no matter where it occurs,'' and your position on that is---- Judge Chertoff. Exactly correct. I completely support the President's view on that. Senator Coleman. And as a former prosecutor, I must say, Judge, I have great respect for your analysis and basically telling folks, if you are not sure it is a problem, you had better act very carefully. You had better look at the statute. But my concern, as we have this discussion, is that we get into situations where we are judging certain techniques and making judgments and coming to speculative opinions about things that are in front of us. I think that could be dangerous, so I respect your analysis and I respect your judgment. I associate myself with the comments of the Ranking Member, Senator Lieberman, who talked about this issue of basic notions of due process, right to counsel, very basic stuff, no license to mistreat, and adhering to those standards are important and what I heard from you today was a reflection of that and agreeing with that. The other side of that is I want to make sure that we are not gun shy in these areas. That may not be a great analogy, but our Permanent Subcommittee did an investigation of sham tax transactions. We had the IRS in front of us and the IRS went through a lot of difficulties with this Congress over abusive behavior across a number of years and I almost got the sense that they were then stepping back where they should have been stepping in because of the nature of their experience here. So with that fundamental understanding, notions of due process, notions of liberty, no license to mistreat, I would hope, then, that we are not hesitant to step forward and do those things to protect security where they need to be done, the Patriot Act being a good example. Judge Chertoff. I can say the Patriot Act, for example, in the areas in which I dealt with it, was a significant aid in allowing us to pursue terrorism cases. To be very brief about it, I was surprised shortly after I came on the job to realize there were large amounts of intelligence relevant to terrorism that I was legally forbidden to see as head of the Criminal Division because of this wall between intelligence and law enforcement. And when the act brought that down and a subsequent court decision brought that down, I was astonished at what there was that we could now use to make cases and actually prosecute people involved in terrorism because we could have the full picture, and I think that is an example of a very important step forward. Senator Coleman. And it has been effective. Judge Chertoff. Yes. Senator Coleman. I was very pleased that the Chairman decided to ask a fourth basic question--and you said you would cooperate with the investigations of this Committee. I take it that also means Subcommittees of this Committee. Judge Chertoff. Yes. Senator Coleman. The Permanent Subcommittee is looking into the issue of container security. Ranking Member Levin and I, along with the Chairman and Senator Lieberman, Ranking Member of the full Committee, have submitted two letters to Under Secretary Hutchinson, chairman's letters requesting certain documents, so again, I take it that the answer is an affirmative across the board and we look forward to working with you on that. Judge Chertoff. Yes, it is. Senator Coleman. Let me just go back to my issue of communications one more time. I understand the issue of standards for funding that have to be based on risk and assessment. My concern is how you get there. My concern is the process that is used in making that assessment and that it is not a Washington bureaucratic process, but it is one that understands what is happening on the ground. That is our concern, Senator Dayton and I representing Minnesota, with what happened in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Anybody who looks at a map or anybody who just knows the name ``Twin Cities'' understands that they work hand in hand. You have an assessment process that in the end zeroes out completely funding for one entity, one urban center, while putting a lesser amount of money in the other urban center. So my concern is with the process, not with the political decision, are we getting money, but is the Department communicating in a way with folks at the local level so they really know what is going on. One other issue of communication, HBO had a film called ``Dirty War'' which described the chaos of a dirty bomb---- Judge Chertoff. I saw that, yes. Senator Coleman. It is worth looking at. Judge Chertoff. Yes, I saw that. Senator Coleman. One of the issues there was this whole issue of first responders not saying that they were adequately trained, didn't get adequate information. I have had a conversation, for instance, with the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office, Captain Brian Johnson, who from his perspective still feels th"
