DINH TO BE ASSISTANT ATTORNEYS GENERAL ---------- WEDNESDAY, MAY 9, 2001 U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:10 a.m, in room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Orrin G. Hatch, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Hatch, Specter, Sessions, Leahy, and Durbin. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN G. HATCH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH Chairman Hatch. Well, good morning, everybody, and welcome to the nomination hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee today. Today we will be considering the nominations of Michael Chertoff to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division and Viet Dinh to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Policy Development. Before we begin, I would like to congratulate both of these nominees for being chosen by the President for these important positions. Both of you have distinguished yourselves by your hard work, your intellect, your fairness and decency, and I think you will do great service to the Department of Justice and the citizens of this country upon your confirmation. The position of Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division is vital to the Department of Justice and to this country and to every citizen in this country. The Criminal Division develops, enforces, and supervises the application of almost all Federal criminal laws. The person who fills this job has to have unquestioned integrity and competency and must be able to exercise good judgment and provide objective legal advice to the Attorney General and other departments and branches of Government. So this is an extremely important position, and it needs to be filled now. Mr. Chertoff meets all of these requirements. His distinguished legal career includes substantial experience not only in the private sector but also in all three branches of the Federal Government. Highlights of his career include graduating with honors from Harvard College and Harvard Law School and serving as a law clerk for Justice Brennan of the U.S. Supreme Court. He also served as Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and as U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. In 1994, Mr. Chertoff served as special counsel to the U.S. Senate Special Committee to Investigate Whitewater and Related Matters, and I think most Senators would readily concede that he was very fair in what he did. Most recently, he has worked as a partner in the prestigious law firm of Latham and Watkins, where he serves as national chair of the firm's white-collar criminal practice. It is difficult for me--or anybody else, I think--to imagine a person more suited to be chief of the Criminal Division, which explains why his nomination has received such significant bipartisan support. Viet Dinh is a similarly good fit for the position of Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Policy Development. This is an extremely important position within the Department of Justice. The OPD coordinates Department initiatives, briefing materials, and policy statements. It also works to review legislation and to ensure that the administration's agenda is being carried forward in the policy arena. Moreover, the office serves as a liaison to the Office of Management and Budget and other agencies on regulatory matters. Although Mr. Dinh is still young, there is no doubt that his life experiences and professional accomplishments make him eminently qualified for this role. I hope he will tell us about coming to this country from Vietnam when he was 10 years of age. But we already know from the mountain of materials he has submitted to the Committee that he has been writing and making public appearances ever since. Mr. Dinh has a very impressive academic background, having graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School with honors. After law school, he clerked for Judge Laurence Silberman on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and then for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court. Upon completion of these esteemed clerkships, he served as associate special counsel for the Senate Special Committee to Investigate Whitewater. Then in 1996, he became a professor at the Georgetown Law Center, where he received tenure last year. All great accomplishments. Mr. Dinh's academic interests have incredible breadth. He has written on structural constitutional issues and separation of powers as well as on international business law and development. He also has a great deal of experience with administrative law, which will assist him with the responsibilities of this position. In addition to his academic work, Mr. Dinh has provided insightful commentary on many of the difficult social issues of our time. Mr. Dinh will be a tremendous asset to the Office of Policy Development and will lead the office with the intelligence and good judgment for which he is known. So it is a pleasure to welcome both of you and your families here today, and we will now turn to the Democratic leader on the Committee, Senator Leahy. Senator Leahy. Mr. Chairman, I understand that Representative Sanchez is going to have a vote in just a few minutes in the House. Chairman Hatch. Would you like for her to go forward? Senator Leahy. I would be happy to have her go forward. In fact, I think her appearance today speaks volumes about her and her willingness to go the extra mile to seek to be bipartisan, especially when you consider how outrageously you were treated by some in your election to the House. In that, you probably do not know which way the person you are going to speak about went, but I think it speaks volumes for you, Representative Sanchez, and I admire you for being here. I will withhold and speak after her. Chairman Hatch. With that gracious concession, let me turn to Ms. Sanchez. I understand you have a vote within the next 5 minutes. Representative Sanchez. Yes, actually, the vote is on the House floor right now. Chairman Hatch. We will extend this courtesy to you. PRESENTATION OF VIET DINH, NOMINEE TO BE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR LEGAL POLICY BY HON. LORETTA SANCHEZ, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Representative Sanchez. If you do not mind, I have less than maybe a minute or two. First of all, thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Leahy, for allowing me to come before you today to introduce to you Viet Dinh. I am here today because Viet Dinh is a very intelligent young man who, of course, has been nominated for Assistant Attorney General for Legal Policy. First and foremost, I would like to acknowledge that his parents are here today. They have traveled here from the Los Angeles area to be with us, Nga Nguyen and Phong Dinh, who is his father. Would you please stand here? Chairman Hatch. We certainly welcome both of you here. I was happy to meet you before this hearing. You are such nice people. Representative Sanchez. As you know, Mr. Chairman, I represent the largest Vietnamese population outside of Vietnam in the world, and Viet Dinh was born in Votoi, Vietnam, on February 22, 1969. He is the youngest of seven children, and his father was a city council member in their hometown back in Vietnam. He was imprisoned in 1975, and his family needed to flee the country and was able to flee to Malaysia in 1978, where they met up with the father. They then came here to America, and I do hope that Viet will talk to you a little bit about his experience fleeing in a boat. His family first came to Oregon when they came to the United States. They picked strawberries for a living, and then they were eventually able to come down to Southern California, to Fullerton, California, in Orange County. Dinh enrolled in Fullerton High School, and, of course, he went on to Harvard Law School and completed graduation, being a graduate of the law school there. I am sure that you will have many questions for him today, but I am pleased to introduce him in a very bipartisan manner from Orange County, California. Thank you. Chairman Hatch. Thank you. We respect that, and we appreciate your taking the time to come over. I know you have that vote, so we will excuse you at this time. Thank you for taking the time. Representative Sanchez. Thank you. Chairman Hatch. I am sure Mr. Dinh and his family appreciate it very much. We will turn to the Democratic leader on the Committee, and then I intend to turn to Senator Domenici as soon as you are through. STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK J. LEAHY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT Senator Leahy. Mr. Chairman, I join with you in welcoming the nominees and their families and friends to what is now the fourth confirmation hearing of this Congress, two very important nominations: the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division, and the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Policy Development. While we consider these current nominations, we should note that the many dedicated employees of the Department of Justice, thousands of them, continue to work, to do their job, to serve the public, as they always have. And I would note that it is the administration, not you, Mr. Chairman, nor I, who called upon United States attorneys, who serve as the front line for our Federal law enforcement efforts, to resign, for most of them to resign in advance of a single nomination to head those important offices around the country. I commend the Chairman for his ambitious schedule, his weekly proceedings on Justice Department nominations. Somebody has an important phone call. I will hold if they want to take it. We have moved very, very quickly. We are proceeding today with the nomination even though the usual pile of background materials of the nominee continued to be supplemented through yesterday. We have had Professor Dinh's questionnaire for less than 2 weeks. In the meantime, it has been supplemented by a correction letter, and then by a large binder supplementing the five binders of material that accompanied his questionnaire. Then we were informed of a number of missing amicus briefs written by the nominee, easy to overlook, perhaps, but one was in the case of Bush v. Gore that had inadvertently been overlooked, and only yesterday yet another supplement to his questionnaire arrived listing additional overlooked appearances by the nominee. Now, I am eager to help the administration staff the Justice Department. As you recall, we moved within about 1 week of Attorney General Ashcroft's hearing and voted him on the floor within 24 hours, 48 hours, something like that, of actually receiving the papers on him. So I want to help, but I think we should not be scheduling hearings for nominees whose papers are only just being received. These papers the Senators have not had a chance to read. I recall by way of contrast the recriminations and delay that accompanied the slightest perceived problems with the timely production of materials by the former President's nominees. Take, for example, the delays and opposition to the tentative nomination of Margaret Morrow when she failed to provide materials from a Bar magazine column. It went on for months. In fact, we even had one Senator asking if she would tell how she had voted on secret ballots on California elections before they would go forward. But I thank the members of the Committee for their cooperation and the effort they are making to proceed with this hearing today. I would hope the Chairman would take these matters into account and accord Senators more than the normal week we have usually allowed for the submission of written questions after the conclusion of the hearing and testimony. I know that Michael Chertoff is a well-known figure here on Capitol Hill. Many will recognize Mr. Chertoff from his time serving as chief counsel for Senator D'Amato's Whitewater investigation of President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton and others. Through this hearing, we will get the opportunity to learn of his academic record, his clerkship for Supreme Court Justice William Brennan--who was a friend of both of ours, Mr. Chairman--his service as a Federal prosecutor in New Jersey, and his private practice of law. Professor Viet Dinh teaches at Georgetown University Law Center, as does my former chief counsel and former chief of staff John Podesta. He, too, spent time on Capitol Hill serving as an associate counsel to the Whitewater investigation and telling the Republicans how they should move forward on the impeachment of President Clinton. One of the major responsibilities of the Office of Policy Development at the Department of Justice, which Professor Dinh has been nominated to head, is the evaluation of the qualifications and fitness of candidates for the Federal judiciary. Many of us have great interest in that, and so I would look forward to inquiring about his plans for judicial nomination and his qualification. I have a much longer statement, but, Mr. Chairman, I know you want to get moving forward, and I will put the rest of it in the record with your permission. [The prepared statement of Senator Leahy follows:] Statement of Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, a U.S. Senator from the State of Vermont I join with the Chairman in welcoming the nominees and their families and friends to the fourth confirmation hearing of this Congress. Again, this morning we proceed on two important nominations. This morning we consider the nominees to be the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division and the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Policy Development at the Department of Justice. Early this year we proceeded with hearings on the nomination of Attorney General Ashcroft even before the nomination was received from the President. We debated and voted on that nomination in Committee within a day of its receipt by the Senate from the President in late January. Working together, Democrats and Republicans on this Committee expedited consideration of that matter so that Senate action was completed after less than two days of debate on February 2. By contrast, Attorney General Reno was not confirmed until March of the first year of the Clinton Administration. I have spoken to Attorney General Ashcroft about the staffing needs of the Department of Justice and assured him that I will do my part. For those with short memories, let us recall that the Deputy Attorney General and the Solicitor General for the last Administration, Phillip Heymann and Drew Days, were not confirmed until May 28th that year. President Clinton's outstanding nominee to head the Antitrust Division, Anne Bingaman, was not confirmed until June 16, and his first Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legislative Affairs, Sheila Anthony, was not confirmed until June 30. President Clinton's Assistant Attorney General heading the Office of Policy Development was not confirmed until August 2, 95 days after her nomination, and President Clinton's Assistant Attorney General to head the Criminal Division was not confirmed until November 20, 74 days after her nomination. Chairman Biden worked hard with Senator Hatch, who then served as the Ranking Member, to reach those dates in the late spring, summer and fall of 1993. I also recall that the1993 nomination of the distinguished professor and scholar Walter Dellinger to serve as an Assistant Attorney General heading the Office of Legal Counsel took six months to confirm and that we had to overcome a filibuster in the Senate before we were able to get to a vote. The nomination of Lois Schiffer to serve as the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Environment and Natural Resources Division took eight months before she was confirmed. Ray Fischer's nomination to be the number three position at the Department, the Associate Attorney General, was not confirmed for five months. By the way, I do not believe that President Bush has yet nominated anyone to serve as the Associate Attorney General, the third highest ranking position in the Department. More recently, under the Chairmanship of Senator Hatch, President Clinton's nomination to head the Civil Division, David Ogden, was held up for 18 months before he was finally confirmed. Randy Moss, the last Assistant Attorney General to head the Office of Legal Counsel took 13 months before he was finally confirmed. Glenn Fine, the Inspector General for the Department took seven months to confirm. Robert Raben, a House Judiciary Committee staffer who was endorsed by Chairman Hyde, took five months to confirm as the most recent Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Office of Legislative Affairs. Nor do these names include the many fine nominees who never were accorded a vote and those who never even received a hearing. In particular, I deeply regret this Committee's and the Senate's treatment of the nomination of Bill Lann Lee. He was nominated by the President to serve as the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division in July 1997 and renominated in 1998 and 2000. He never received a Senate vote in three and one-half years, although he served admirably in an acting capacity and then as the Assistant Attorney General pursuant to a recess appointment of the President. I note this recent history not to urge Democrats to repeat the tactics and excesses engaged in by Republicans over the course of the most recent Democratic Administration, but to add context and time frames against which to consider the progress we are making in staffing the appointed positions at the Department of Justice. While we consider the current nominations, the many dedicated employees at the Department of Justice continue to work, to do their jobs and to serve the public. I also note that it is the Administration, and not the Senate, that has called upon United States Attorneys, who serve as the front line of our federal law enforcement efforts, to resign in advance of a single nomination to head those important offices around the country even being received. I commend the Chairman for his ambitious schedule and his weekly proceedings on Justice Department nominations. We continue to proceed within days of our receiving materials on these nominations. Take for example today's hearing. The Committee is proceeding with a nomination today even though the usual file of background materials on the nominee continued to be supplemented through yesterday. We have had Professor Dinh's questionnaire for less than two weeks. In the meantime it has been supplemented by a correction letter and a large binder supplementing the five binders of materials that accompanied his questionnaire. Then we were informed of a number of missing amicus briefs written by the nominee, including one in the well-known case of Bush v. Gore that had inadvertently been omitted from the materials provided the Committee. And, only yesterday, yet another supplement to his questionnaire arrived, listing additional overlooked media appearances by the nominee. As eager as I am to help the Administration staff the Justice Department, I do not think that this Committee ought to be scheduling hearings for nominees whose papers are only just being received and whose papers Senators have not had an opportunity to review. I also recall, by way of contrast, the recriminations and delay that accompanied the slightest perceived problem with the timely production of materials by a Clinton nominee. Take for example the delays and opposition that attended the nomination of Margaret Morrow when she failed to provide materials from a bar magazine column. I thank all Members of the Committee for their cooperation and the effort they are making to proceed with this hearing today. I trust the Chairman will take these matters into account and accord Senators more than the normal week we have usually allowed for the submission of written questions after the conclusion of the hearing testimony. Turning now to the nominees, I note that Michael Chertoff is a well-known figure here on Capitol Hill. Many will recognize Mr. Chertoff from his time serving as chief counsel for Senator D'Amato's Whitewater investigation. Through this hearing we will get the opportunity to learn of his academic record, his clerkship for Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, his service as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey and his private practice of law. We welcome you, Mr. Chertoff. Professor Viet Dinh teaches at Georgetown University Law Center. He, too, spent time on Capitol Hill, serving as an associate counsel to the Whitewater investigation and giving advice to Republicans on the impeachment of President Clinton. One of the major responsibilities of the Office of Policy Development at the Department of Justice, which Professor Dinh has been nominated to head, is the evaluation of the qualifications and fitness of candidates for the federal judiciary. That is a subject on which many Senators and many American have great interest. I look forward to inquiring about plans for judicial nominations and your own qualifications for that position, Professor Dinh. Chairman Hatch. Well, thank you. We are now in the fifth month here, and we have one person confirmed down at the Department of Justice, and then only after a very tough hearing, which many on our side felt was fairly conducted but, nevertheless, there were a lot of aspects about it that were seen as smear tactics by outside groups and others. Now, Senator Domenici-- Senator Leahy. I do recall at least one member of your side of the aisle, when I had agreed to your request on witnesses and procedures there, then on national television called me ``a criminal and a lawyer''--I mean ``a liar''--maybe he meant the same thing-- [Laughter.] Senator Leahy.--for agreeing to your suggestion, Mr. Chairman. So I seem to be in a position of being damned if I do and damned if I don't. If I agree with you, your side blasts me, and if I don't agree with you, your side blasts me. It is an uncomfortable position for you to be in, uncomfortable for me. I would point out the Deputy Attorney General and the Solicitor General for the last administration were not confirmed until May 28th of that year. Anne Bingaman took until June 16th, Sheila Anthony not until June 30th, and on and on. Chairman Hatch. I might add that Ms. Reno was confirmed 1 day after, and we did not have outside witnesses, and we treated a whole bunch of them that way. We confirmed almost immediately. They had hearings very quickly, but we will get into that later. Senator Leahy. We had outside-- Chairman Hatch. Let's get into that later. Senator Domenici, we will go to you. PRESENTATION OF VIET DINH, NOMINEE TO BE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR LEGAL POLICY BY HON. PETE V. DOMENICI, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO Senator Domenici. Thank you very much. First I want to thank you for the hearing today. I would like my remarks on Viet Dinh to be put in the record, if you would, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Hatch. We would be happy to put it in the record, and we are honored to have both of you here today, to have U.S. Senators take time from busy schedules. Both of you are very busy. Senator Domenici, we understand you are in the middle of these budget problems and probably the busiest guy on Capitol Hill. Senator Domenici. Let me say, this is beyond being busy. Senator Leahy, it is good to be with you, and to both of you and those on this Committee that will pass judgment on nominees. Let me say it is really hard for me to see a better situation that depicts the American dream and the ability of people that start with almost nothing to achieve high things. Who would have thought that 23 years ago, the nominee was in a small fishing boat, just 23 years ago, out on the waters, having escaped from Vietnam, and he was there with a number of other Vietnamese but without his father, who had been put in jail because he had been a council person in Vietnam? And he is there with his mother and his siblings and other Vietnamese people, and the story should just briefly go to a very fortunate thing that he eventually ended up with his siblings and mother in the United States. It was a long time before the father came, but in the meantime, the family stuck together, and guess what? One of those in those boats 23 years ago, to wit Viet Dinh, has since that time graduated from Harvard with a magna cum laude undergrad, went to law school there and graduated magna cum laude, and today is a full professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University. Now, if there was nothing else in between, it would seem that we would be here in the Senate very interested in expediting this nominee and laying claim to a great American success story. If you are looking for diversity of appointments, with qualifications second to no one, you have got one. You will have a Vietnamese, a scholar, who just 23 years ago was a young man out on a boat at sea, who could just have well have drowned and we never would have heard from him. But because of loving family around him, they eventually ended up American citizens, he, his siblings, and his mother. Since then, people looking would be saying what a marvelous young man, what a great success story. That is not all he has done to qualify him. He has worked for people in the judicial system who are in high, high positions in our Government who had to do very, very important legal work, for a Supreme Court judge, a circuit judge, while in the meantime working here on the Hill for a few years. And today, a full-time professor at Georgetown. About past records and his history, all I know is that he is exemplary in all respects, an example to those of us who have been more fortunate to have been either born here or third generation here or, like Patrick Leahy and I, at least half of his is Italian, and he is not very far away from the immigrants that came, in my case two immigrants. Senator Leahy. I was waiting to see how long that was going to take for Pete to mention that. [Laughter.] Senator Domenici. I do have trouble when I tell our friends that Leahy is Italian. They say, ``Does he spell it L-e-h-i?'' And I say, ``No, no, no.'' Senator Leahy. But what Senator Domenici does, if he really needs my vote on something, he calls my uncle in Italy and tells him to get on my case. Senator Domenici. I do not know where he is because I lost track of him, but I will call him this week about this nomination. [Laughter.] Senator Domenici. If you would help by sending the phone number or if your wife would, it would help. I want to close by saying I am hopeful that we will see him in the halls of Congress again, but I hope he will be testifying here before us as the OPD for the Justice Department. He will do every employee there justice, and his fairness and judicial temperament and knowledge of the law will serve our country very, very well. Thank you for giving me a few moments. I appreciate it. Chairman Hatch. Well, thank you, Senator Domenici. I have listened to a lot of recommendations on this Committee through the years. I have never heard a better one than you have just given from a person who is any more respected than you. We are very, very grateful that you took time from your schedule. Senator Domenici. Thank you very much. Chairman Hatch. We are going to release you so you can go about your busy schedule. Senator Domenici. Good to be here with you. Thank you, Senator. We really appreciate that, and it is an excellent statement on behalf of somebody from a different party, and I appreciate it very much. [The prepared statement of Senator Domenici follows:] Statement of Hon. Pete V. Domenici, a U.S. Senator from the State of New Mexico Mr Chairman and distinguished members of this Committee. I am delighted to present Viet Dinh, the President's nominee to be Assistant Attorney General the Office of Policy Development. Professor Dinh is not a New Mexican. Despite that failing, I appear on his behalf because I have had the pleasure of knowing him both professionally and personally over the past several years.? Professor Dinh's journey to this hearing began 23-years ago on a small fishing boat off the coast of Vietnam. For 12 days, the ten-year- old Viet and 84 others fought storms hunger and gunfire as their boat drifted throughout the South China Sea. Fortunately, Viet, his mother, and six siblings, reached a refugee camp after coming ashore in Malaysia. After being admitted the United States, Viet's family arrived in Oregon and later moved to California, where Viet became a U.S. citizen. Those early years presented many challenges for Viet and his family. They had little money and worked long hours in the berry fields. Moreover, Viet's father had been incarcerated in Vietnam because of his role as a city councilman. It was not until 1983 that they were finally reunited after his father's successful escape from Vietnam. Despite this tumultuous beginning, Dinh persevered. More than that- he excelled. Perhaps these early obstacles hardened Viet's resolve and fueled his rapid ascent through the legal profession. Viet graduated magna cum laude from both Harvard College and Harvard Law School, where he was a Class Marshal and a Olin Research Fellow in Law and Economics. He served as a law clerk to Judge Laurence H. Silberman of the U.S. Court Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Shortly after Viet completed his Supreme Court clerkship, he came to work for the U.S. Senate, where I had the opportunity to work with him for the first time. He quickly demonstrated his outstanding legal ability, superb professional judgment, and fine character. Professor Dinh's record of achievement continued in academia. Viet currently is a professor of law at Georgetown University, where he is the Deputy Director of the Asian Law and Policy Studies Program. In addition to his expertise in constitutional law, Professor Dinh is accomplished in corporations law and international law. He has served as counsel to the Special Master mediating lawsuits by Holocaust victims against German and Austrian banks. Since he left the Senate, I have called on him from time to time for counsel on constitutional issues. On each occasion, Viet exhibited a comprehensive knowledge of the law and extraordinary energy. In closing, Mr. Chairman, I believe that Professor Dinh's character, along with his distinguished academic and professional accomplishments, make him uniquely qualified to serve in the Department of Justice. Thus, it is with great pleasure that I offer Professor. Dinh my highest recommendation for confirmation as Assistant Attorney General. Chairman Hatch. Senator Corzine, we are honored to have you here as well, and we look forward to hearing your testimony. PRESENTATION OF MICHAEL CHERTOFF, NOMINEE TO BE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE CRIMINAL DIVISION BY HON. JON CORZINE, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY Senator Corzine. Mr. Chairman, I am honored to be here. Senator Leahy and members of the Committee, this is a terrific opportunity for me to introduce someone who I believe is terrific, Michael Chertoff, nominee for Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division. Mr. Chertoff has served the citizens of New Jersey in a number of capacities, as well as the Department of Justice and indeed the Nation, and we will all be fortunate to have his tremendous skills at the helm of the Criminal Division. I also speak for Senator Torricelli, who unfortunately cannot be here today, but he also strongly supports Mr. Chertoff's nomination. Chairman Hatch. He did indicate that to me yesterday, and I appreciate that very much. Senator Corzine. Mr. Chertoff has impeccable credentials, not the least of which is being a native New Jerseyan. We like to see those folks get ahead. He attended Harvard College, then Harvard Law School, where he was editor of the Law Review. He served as a Supreme Court law clerk to one of New Jersey's absolutely finest citizens ever, Justice Brennan. And in both private practice and public service since then, he has developed a reputation as a brilliant, tough, fair, and truly world-class litigator and earned the respect of his peers and adversaries. Indeed, one of New Jersey's papers have suggested that he might be New Jersey's ``lawyer laureate.'' He is a little young for that. While I should acknowledge that we might not agree on every issue, I consider Mr. Chertoff to be one of the finest lawyers my State has to offer, and he will do an outstanding job. From 1990 to 1994, Mr. Chertoff served New Jersey exceptionally well as our U.S. Attorney, where he tackled organized crime, public corruption, health care fraud, and bank fraud. Unlike his predecessors, as U.S. Attorney he continued to try cases himself, and his long hours and unending commitment to the job and the citizens of New Jersey were legendary. He tackled the highest-profile cases in a serious and thoughtful manner and, despite being one of the youngest U.S. Attorneys in the Nation, raised the profile and reputation for excellence of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Newark. More recently, Mr. Chertoff has played a critical and important role in helping the State of New Jersey investigate a very, very difficult issue--racial profiling. As special counsel to the State Senate Judiciary Committee, he helped handle the racial profiling concerns with our State police in an excellent manner. His work was bipartisan and thoroughly professional, and helped expose the fact that for too long, our State authorities were aware that statistics showed minority motorists were being treated unfairly by law enforcement and yet had ignored the problem. As this Committee well knows, and as President Bush himself has stated, racial profiling is a critical issue not just in New Jersey but across our Nation. And I hope that, working with Mr. Chertoff and Senator Feingold and a whole other group of folks, we can work together to address this at the Federal level. Mr. Chairman, I know it will be clear to the Committee that Mr. Chertoff is one of the Nation's most competent and respected lawyers, with a very distinguished record of public service and private service. He is a good man. I am pleased to support his nomination. Senator Corzine. Thank you very much. Chairman Hatch. All right. Well, thank you for being here. We will excuse you. If I could have the two nominees come forward. If you will raise you right hands. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Mr. Chertoff. I do. Mr. Dinh. I do. Chairman Hatch. Thank you very much. Mr. Chertoff, I have known you a long time. I could not have a higher opinion of an attorney than I do of you, and I have known some great attorneys in my life. So we will turn to you first. And, Professor Dinh, I could not have a higher opinion than I do of you, and I have known a lot of professors. And what you have come through in your life and what you have been able to accomplish, really, these things are truly amazing. So we will start with Mr. Chertoff, and then we will take your testimony, and then we will open the floor for questions. STATEMENT OF MICHAEL CHERTOFF, OF NEW JERSEY, NOMINEE TO BE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, CRIMINAL DIVISION, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Mr. Chertoff. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy, members of the Committee, I am pleased to appear before you today at these hearings, and I am honored that President Bush has nominated me for the position of Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. Before I give the testimony I have prepared, I would like to introduce my family. My wife, Meryl, is here. My daughter, Emily, is here. My son, Philip, was given the opportunity to come, and after considering that, he said that he thought he ought to spend the time in school. And I guess that speaks very well for the school. Chairman Hatch. I think he is going to follow after his father and mother. [Laughter.] Chairman Hatch. We welcome you, Mrs. Chertoff, and--is it Emily? Emily, we welcome both of you, and we are so happy to have you here. Mr. Chertoff. I wish my parents could be here. They were present when I was sworn in as United States Attorney. They have since passed away. I hope and believe that wherever they are now, they are looking down upon us here. And, finally, I would like to thank both Senator Corzine and Senator Torricelli for their support of my nomination. Contemplating today's proceedings, I was reminded of the day almost 18 years ago when I first entered service at the Department of Justice. On that day, in the presence of my parents, I took the oath as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. And in taking that oath, I began over a decade of service in the company of a superb group of lawyers and public servants--Federal prosecutors. At that time, it was customary to present new Assistant U.S. Attorneys with a certificate that, in part, set forth the following principle: ``To be an Assistant United State Attorney...requires commitment to absolute integrity and fair play; to candor and fairness in dealing with adversaries and the courts; to careful preparation, not making any assumptions or leaving anything to chance; and never proceeding in any case unless convinced of the correctness of one's position or the guilt of the accused.'' I still have that certificate, and I believe its exhortation remains the principle that should guide the work of all Federal prosecutors. During the 10 and a half years I served as a prosecutor, including 4 years as United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, I had the great fortune to represent the United States in many settings and many types of criminal cases. In the Southern District of New York, for example, I was privileged to lead the prosecution of the bosses and underbosses who comprised the infamous Commission of La Cosa Nostra--the so-called Board of Directors of the Mafia in the United States. That case, which resulted in the conviction of every defendant for crimes ranging from murder to extortion, was the product of the effort, ingenuity, and courage of literally dozens of lawyers, Federal agents, and police detectives. Prosecutions such as the Commission case demonstrate the capability of the Department of Justice in the face of the most implacable and entrenched criminal enterprises. When the Senate confirmed me as United States Attorney for New Jersey in 1991, I was honored with the leadership of one of the outstanding prosecutorial offices in the country. The reputation of the U.S. Attorney's Office--inherited from my predecessors and burnished by my colleagues--was that of a vigorous, fair, and evenhanded agency of law enforcement. During my tenure, the office conducted many noteworthy and successful prosecutions, convicting top-echelon organized crime and narcotics offenders, imprisoning savings and loan bandits and securities law violators, and successfully prosecuting criminals who preyed on the most vulnerable members of our society. As we made successful cases against local gang leaders or worked with community residents on neighborhood policing initiatives, I was often reminded of the tangible ability that we had to visibly improve the lives of citizens in all settings. At the same time, I took pride in the fact that the lawyers in my office adhered to the rule of law and principle of fair play in carrying out their work. In the 7 years since I left Government, I have continued to participate in the criminal justice process, but from the standpoint of a private attorney. I have represented both large corporations and individuals in all manner of criminal cases, including trials. And I have remained involved in public service. Several years ago, I was privileged to serve as special counsel to the Special Committee of the Senate empaneled to investigate Whitewater and related matters. Also during the 1990's, I was appointed by a Federal judge to investigate misconduct within a labor union that was placed under court supervision. In that capacity, my colleagues and I successfully obtained the dismissal of dozens of members on charges of corruption or organized crime association and helped restore democracy to the union. More recently, I have served as special counsel to a New Jersey State Senate Committee examining the issue of racial profiling and how it was handled by State law enforcement authorities. As I sit before you today, therefore, I have the benefit of a wide range of experiences in the criminal justice arena, covering virtually every type of Federal case, and the perspectives of a former line prosecutor, United States Attorney, and defense counsel. If confirmed, I will be guided in office by the following principles: First, the power to investigate and charge criminal conduct is an awesome power of Government, which must not only be exercised fairly and impartially, but also must be seen to be so exercised. Prosecution must be vigorous, but respectful of constitutional rights. As Justice Sutherland famously said, prosecutors may strike hard blows, but not foul ones. Second, we need to keep pace with the evolving, ever more international and high tech face of crime. Criminals are quick to exploit faster global communications and finance; we must be quicker. Organized crime enterprises can take advantage of, or subvert, weak national police structures; we must foster and aid those structures. More and more of our National assets take the form of intellectual property and technology; we must increase our capacity to protect those assets. Third, the foundation of law enforcement remains the public trust. To promote that trust, all members of law enforcement must respect the rights and needs of victims, coordinate appropriately with State and local officials and with the community, and, unquestionably, conduct themselves without a hint of bias or prejudice. I am conscious of the great responsibility and authority reposed in the office for which I have been nominated. If confirmed, I will carry out this responsibility and exercise this authority with all the vigor, fairness, and dedication I can muster. Thank you.

You are welcome. Thank you so much for your testimony. Professor Dinh, we will take you. STATEMENT OF VIET D. DINH, OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, NOMINEE TO BE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR LEGAL POLICY, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Mr. Dinh. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy. Thank you very much for having me here today, and I really do sincerely apologize to you and to your staff for any inconvenience that my submission of my voluminous paper trail may have caused you. The oversights were truly inadvertent. I also want to thank Congresswoman Sanchez for introducing me and Senator Domenici for those moving words of support. I know that Congresswoman Sanchez had recognized my parents, but I would like to take the opportunity to introduce them again, because they really are the heroes of that story that Senator Domenici said. My parents are here: my father, Dinh Hong Phong, and my mother, Nguyen Thi Nga. Thank you so much. Chairman Hatch. We are so happy to have you here, and we are honored to have you in our presence. Mr. Dinh. With your permission, I would like to start by telling you a little bit about the reason why I consider them the heroes, not only in my life but in the story that Senator Domenici has told. My father was a government official in the Government of South Vietnam. When the war ended in 1975, he was imprisoned, but in a re-education camp for 3 years. He escaped from that camp in the morning of June 1978, and he lived as a fugitive in that country for several years before he was finally able to escape that country. After 25 unsuccessful attempts, he was finally able to find freedom here in America in 1983. At the same time that my father escaped from the camp, my mother took us, her children, simultaneously onto a small boat to find freedom from Vietnam. After 12 days drifting at sea, you could imagine our joy and absolute elation when we finally saw land in a harbor in Malaysia. But instead of encountering a warm welcome to freedom, what we encountered was a hail of bullets fired at us in warning, forcing us back out to international waters. Our boat was not seaworthy for another sea voyage over to Singapore, probably our nearest port, so in the middle of the night, my mother decided that we should turn back into the beach, into the deserted beach in the middle of the night. And so as the boat beached onto the shore and we all swam to the shore, I turned back and there alone on the boat was my mother wielding an axe that was almost as tall as she was. She was using that axe in order to put a hole in the side of the boat to sink it so that the authorities would not be able to force us back on in the morning. That image of my mother destroying our last link to Vietnam really stands in my mind to this day as to the incredible courage she possesses, but also the incredible lengths to which my parents, like so many other people, have gone to in order to find that promise of freedom and opportunity, a promise that so many people have lost their lives in order to attain and so many Americans have given up their lives to protect. It is that belief in that promise of opportunity and freedom that has led me to devote my life to one living in the law, which has been so aptly described as ``a system of wise restraints that set men free.'' My academic interest, while, as Senator Hatch noted, has been varying and broad, has all centered on a common theme; that is, I have been interested in studying the institutions and mechanisms of governance, those wise restraints that set us free. I am very grateful to the President and the Attorney General for this opportunity for me to repay the debt of opportunity that my family owes this great country of ours and for me to have a small hand in helping to think about and work on those wise restraints that set us free. As I contemplate the position to which I am nominated, I was thinking about how I would approach the job if I am confirmed by this Committee and by the Senate. And to me, it seems to me that if I am confirmed as the Assistant Attorney General for Legal Policy, I will be guided by two abiding principles that to me serve as the foundation of this promise of opportunity and freedom in our country. First, America makes that promise to all her citizens and that all of her citizens, all Americans, should enjoy the equal protection of the law. I will work to ensure that the privileges and burdens of law are accorded equally. Invidious discrimination affects me personally as a Vietnamese American and offends me morally as an American. And all Americans-- regardless of race, class, sex, religion, socioeconomic status, or any other status--should enjoy the security that comes with the faithful and vigorous execution of the law. Such personal security is essential for individual freedom to flourish. Second, governmental power should be exercised only according to legitimate authority. The Department has the tremendous responsibility to enforce the laws of the United States. It must discharge that responsibility faithfully and vigorously. But at the same time, the Department must make sure that it acts only when it may and not simply because it can, that government actions are based not on raw power but on legitimate constitutional and legislative authority. Such respect for law fosters individual liberty and freedom from arbitrary governmental coercion. Senators, I have personally experienced government that does not work, where law is non-existent and power exercised by arbitrary whim, by caprice, by personal will. That experience teaches me not to take our system of laws for granted, but to work constantly toward its improvement. I hope I will have the opportunity to work with you in that common endeavor, to listen to your concerns and those of others, and to find common ground among diverse viewpoints. This Committee has a proud history of working to improve our legal system to meet new and constant challenge, and if confirmed, I promise to help you in any way I can to build on that tradition. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement and biographical information of Mr. Dinh follow:] Statment of Viet D. Dinh, Nominee to be Assistant Attorney General for Legal Policy Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy, and Members of the Committee, Thank you very much for having me here today, and for taking time to meet with me personally over the past week. It is an honor to appear before you. With your permission, I would like to share the honor by introducing my father, Phong Dinh, and my mother, Nga Nguyen. Without their many sacrifices, I would not be before you today, so I would like to tell you a little about my parents. My father was an official in the government of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). After the communist takeover in 1975, he was imprisoned in a reeducation camp. In 1978, he escaped from the camp and lived as a fugitive for several years in Vietnam. Finally, in 1983, after 25 attempts, he successfully escaped to find freedom here in America. Simultaneous with my father's escape from the reeducation camp, my mother took her children onto a small boat with 85 other persons. After twelve days at sea, many of them drifting without food or water, we entered a harbor in Malaysia. Instead of a welcome to freedom, however, we encountered what Senator Kennedy has aptly described as ``compassion fatigue.'' A patrol boat fired warning shots at us, forcing the boat back out to international waters. Because our boat could not have survived another sea voyage, we turned back to a deserted beach after nightfall. After swimming to shore, I looked back and saw my mother. She alone was still on the boat, trying to put a hole in it, to sink it so that we could not be forced back on. That image remains vivid in my mind, speaking to the lengths to which my parents, like so many other Americans, have gone to seek the American promise of opportunity and freedom. As a ten-year-old child in the refugee camp and even after our family landed in Oregon on Thanksgiving Day, 1978, in my wildest dreams I could not have foreseen the opportunities that this country has given our family. Even then, however, I knew the value of America's promise of freedom-a promise that so many people have risked their lives to attain and so many Americans have lost their lives to protect. Belief in this promise is why I have chosen a life in the law, ``the system of wise restraints that set men free.'' My interests in the different doctrinal areas of constitutional, international, and corporations law stem from the same source, my desire to study the institutions and mechanisms of governance, the wise restraints that make us free. I am grateful to President Bush and Attorney General Ashcroft for the chance to repay the debt of opportunity I owe to this country and her people. I am humbled to have been nominated to be Assistant Attorney General for Legal Policy. If confirmed, I will formulate and implement legal policy for the Department of Justice and the Administration. In doing so, I will be guided by two principles that, to me, serve as the foundation for America's promise of freedom. First, America makes that promise to all, and every American is entitled to the equal protection of the law. I am committed to working to ensure that the privileges and burdens of the law are accorded equally. Invidious discrimination affects me personally as a Vietnamese American and offends me morally as an American. All Americans- regardless of race, religion, sex, socioeconomic status, or any other status-should enjoy the security that comes with the faithful and vigorous execution of the laws. Such personal security is essential for individual freedom to flourish. Second, governmental power should be exercised only according to legitimate authority. The Department of Justice has the tremendous responsibility to enforce the laws of the United States. It must discharge that responsibility faithfully and vigorously so that all citizens receive full protection of the law. But, at the same time, the Department must ensure that it acts not because it can, but only when it may-that governmental actions are based not on unfettered power, but on legitimate constitutional and legislative authority. Such respect for law fosters individual liberty, freedom from the specter of arbitrary governmental coercion. I have personally experienced government that does not work--where law is nonexistent and power exercised by arbitrary whim. That experience teaches me not to take our system of laws for granted, but to work constantly toward its improvement. I hope I will have the opportunity to work with you in that common endeavor, to listen to your concerns and those of others, and to find common ground among diverse viewpoints. If confirmed, I will be your partner in shaping our country's legal policy to meet new and constant challenges. Thank you.

Thank you, Professor. I am so impressed with both of you, and I know both of you well, and I really commend this administration for picking each of you for your respective positions. I am very grateful to President Bush and others. I think you are going to bring a dimension to the Justice Department that I think it sorely needs at this time, so I am very grateful to have both of you here. I think I will turn to Senator Leahy and let him begin the questions. Senator Leahy. You go ahead, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Hatch. No, you go ahead. I am happy to do that. Senator Leahy. Mr. Chertoff, I just want to make sure I have got the times of the time you were U.S. Attorney. You were appointed by the 41st President, President Bush, in 1990. Is that correct? Mr. Chertoff. Actually, Senator, I was a court-appointed U.S. Attorney in 1990. I was actually nominated--I was actually confirmed in 1991. Senator Leahy. In? Mr. Chertoff. I was confirmed in 1991. Senator Leahy. And then President Clinton, after his election, kept you there until April 1994? Mr. Chertoff. That's correct. Senator Leahy. Now, I think probably--I know you are well known in New Jersey for your work there, but I think you are best known to the country as the special counsel to the U.S. Senate Whitewater Committee, one of the first and best known of what some would say the anti-Clinton investigations that was chaired by former Senator Alfonse D'Amato. It was on the news most nights, good shots of you there. And I, of course, was pleased to see the news media would carry somebody with what I considered an appropriate hairline. But, on the other hand, of course, there were those who felt both you, Senator D'Amato, and the investigation were of a very partisan and political nature. I am not saying anything differently than I have said to my friend Al D'Amato, who is a friend of mine. And because of that, some will see you as a partisan political choice, named as a reward to your party. And as you have heard, even some Members of Congress have made that claim, so I want to give you a chance to refer to that so you can speak about it, being someone who would uphold the law and make fair decisions about prosecutions brought by the Federal Government. As you know, I, like most other former prosecutors in the Senate, feel prosecution should be brought irrespective of one's political party, but based on the facts. So, Mr. Chertoff, here is your chance. You have heard some of these complaints, and I thought I would give you a chance to give your side. Mr. Chertoff. Thank you, Senator, and I appreciate the opportunity to address this. As you know, Senator, I was retained by the majority of the Committee--actually, I think I began as minority counsel when the Banking Committee did the investigation, and then was asked to come back as majority counsel when the Committee was constituted. And I have to say it was a privilege to serve the Senate as a lawyer and to work with both the members on both sides and the staff on both sides in what was a very challenging and interesting matter. I understand people have different views of it. I have very fond recollections of my time working here. That being said, the job for which I have been nominated is one which is entirely different in character. If confirmed, the position that I would assume would be that of a Federal prosecutor seeking to enforce the law. I am absolutely committed, if confirmed, to having nothing whatsoever to do with anything political other than voting. And I would say, Senator, that those who are familiar with my service as a Federal prosecutor in the past, as both an Assistant U.S. Attorney and as United States Attorney, will see that that was my policy and my practice and my commitment back then. During the years I was a prosecutor, I had nothing whatsoever to do with politics. My office, the office I had working with and the office I led, was evenhanded and fair. I took no account of partisanship or politics in any of the decisions that were made. And I made it an article of faith, which I communicated to the people on my staff and which I would communicate to the people in the Division if I were confirmed, that politics has no place in enforcement of the law. There is no more awesome power, there is no more sacred trust than enforcing the criminal laws. And that has to be something that is above and beyond any partisan or political considerations. So you absolutely have my pledge that, if confirmed, I will continue with that principle as I, in fact, conducted myself when I was United States Attorney in New Jersey. Senator Leahy. Let me ask your opinion on one thing because you have been involved in Senate investigations. In the past number of years, we seem to have spent more time investigating than legislating. One of the things that bothered me is that a number of lower-level staffers get called up here, sometimes spend days preparing for something, and then basically are dismissed or asked nominal questions. They are working on lower-level Government salaries, but they could spend darn near a year's salary just on legal fees, sometimes in what seems to be almost capricious ways, other times serious ones. But there are a number of us on both sides of the aisle who have expressed concern about line attorneys like the Department of Justice being called. Now, I suspect you did in your office as U.S. Attorney the same thing that most prosecutors do on a close case. You will have some very key attorneys come in and have one say, look, I want you to give me the best case for the defendant, the other one says I want you to give the best case for the Government. Now, obviously later on--I mean, you have to come for confirmation, you are before the Senate and all that. But later on, somebody could call in those who gave the case for the defendant and say, But didn't you argue that--whatever, that they might be--or vice versa, depending--in other words, take the team that took the position different than what you ultimately decided on, which happened a great deal up here. Somebody would come up when there had been this A team and B team, and a lot was made of the testimony of those who were on whatever team on a close call, it came out differently than the person making--they had to make the final call. How do you feel about having line attorneys being called or those who are not in a Senate-confirmed position to testify before Congressional Committees? Mr. Chertoff. Well, Senator, I am familiar with this issue from a variety of standpoints, having been both a United States Attorney, obviously, and also having very recently, in fact, been involved in serving as counsel to a State senate Committee that looked, among other things, at law enforcement. I am a firm believer in Congressional oversight. I think it's important. I don't think wisdom is exclusively lodged in the executive branch, and I think there's an important responsibility that the Senate has and the House has to conduct oversight of the operations of the departments. At the same time, I think, Senator, obviously, as a former U.S. Attorney, you have a keen appreciation for the need for people to have candid discussion, particularly about matters relating to criminal law, where we deal with issues of confidentiality and sensitive issues that could compromise investigations. I certainly would want to work with Congress in instances where there is oversight to make sure that as the person responsible, ultimately as the Presidential appointee, if confirmed, that I would be able to answer and account for any questions and lay before Congress whatever is necessary. And I think that it is possible in any instance that I can envision to find a way to serve the Congress' needs for oversight while accommodating, I think, the legitimate concerns of confidentiality and deliberation, which I know you understand. Senator Leahy. And understand what I am saying, I mean, Mr. Chertoff, I am worried--I don't care whether it is a Democratic administration, Republican administration, or anything else, I am worried that you are going to have line attorneys who are going to be very concerned about sending you in your case or Attorney General Ashcroft in his case, or others, a memo saying I want you to know my very strong feelings that so-and-so should be prosecuted, or should not be prosecuted, when they know ultimately the final decision is going to be made by you or by the Attorney General. But I am afraid that some may feel very worried about being that candid if they think they are someday going to be up here to answer all kinds of questions and spending on legal fees maybe the next 3 years' tuition for one of their kids. I realize this is as much a problem for the Senate, but I would hope that we would get off that. Now, in 1993, you published an article in the Michigan Law Review entitled ``Chopping Miranda Down to Size,'' which argued for a narrow interpretation of the Miranda rule. Given the Supreme Court's recent reaffirmance of Miranda, and they also found the statute that Congress had passed overruled Miranda to be unconstitutional, do you have any problem in now relying on the Supreme Court's decision even if it varied with your earlier opinion? Mr. Chertoff. The Supreme Court has settled the matter. I never have difficulty following Supreme Court decisions. Senator Leahy. I had that feeling. I just wanted--now, the McDade law sort of slipped into the omnibus--or some would call it ominous--appropriations law at the end of the 105th Congress to rein in overzealous prosecutors, but what it also has done, it has impeded important criminal prosecutions. It has chilled the use of federally authorized investigative techniques. I introduced a bill that would establish a clear choice of law room under which Federal prosecutors would be subject to the ethics rules of the Federal courts in which they practice. I found, in fact, in one very notable case that investigations were so hampered because of the McDade law that some could argue that people lost their lives as a result of it. You may know the case I mean. I can discuss it with you privately after if you would like. But do you feel that we should do something with the legislation? In fact, a number of members on both sides of the aisle here support under which Federal prosecutors would be subject to the ethics rules of the Federal courts in which they practice? Mr. Chertoff. Well, Senator, first let me say I haven't seen the precise legislation, but I am very familiar with the issue. Senator Leahy. Then maybe I should say it this way: Do you feel that there has got to be changes in the McDade law first? Mr. Chertoff. Well, let me say that, of course, I begin with the principle that we want to have attorneys for the Government following the highest standards of ethics as lawyers, and we don't want to have, certainly, any suggestion that there should be a lower standard. At the same time, from my own experience, I am well aware of the fact that issues have arisen in particular States concerning whether undercover operations can be conducted or wiretapping can be conducted, and there has been a concern about a chilling effect upon prosecutions of what could potentially be very serious crimes, including matters that affect life and death. And, clearly, that is something which we have to address. What I would like to do, if confirmed, is work with the Attorney General, with the Congress, on fashioning a resolution that accommodates the concern that people have to make sure that attorneys are being ethical, but making sure we can also do the kinds of investigative activities and use the investigative tools which Congress has given us and which we need to be able to employ to protect this country. Senator Leahy. Thank you. I will wait until my next round. Chairman Hatch. Well, thank you, Senator Leahy. We will turn to Senator Specter, who is chairing a hearing, so I am going to accommodate him right now. Senator Specter. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I regret that I can only stay a short time because I am chairing the hearing on breast cancer on the Subcommittee of Labor, Health, Human Services for Appropriations. I thank both of you gentlemen for coming by to see me yesterday. We only had a brief meeting, but I appreciated the opportunity to talk to both of you. I note you both bring extraordinary records to these positions: Mr. Chertoff, magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1975 and magna cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1978; and, Mr. Dinh, magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1990 and magna cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1993. I have two observations. I wonder why neither of you went to Yale. Chairman Hatch. It is a little scary, you know. Senator Specter. And I wonder why we are having so much brain power from one institution. I wonder if that isn't really risking an undue market share. Chairman Hatch. I hadn't thought about that. It is a little scary to have all these Harvardians down here. Senator Specter. It may be an antitrust issue. I don't know. Chairman Hatch. Count on Senator Specter to come up with very unique twists in the law. [Laughter.] Senator Specter. Well, I think academic records are very important. I have hired more than a few lawyers in my time, and I think that is a very solid indication as to your performance. Mr. Chertoff, a question was raised about having line attorneys before the Committee, which is something which is done very, very rarely, and only on a showing of extraordinary cause. And when the Committee did it last year, it was after rejecting a personal appeal from the Attorney General. And you may want to take a look at that matter. That is up to you. But this Committee, through the Subcommittee which I chair, took a close look at campaign finance investigations and the issue of independent counsel, and the head of the Public Integrity Section testified in this room that he had given a critical recommendation opposing independent counsel because he thought it was--I don't know quite what word to use--``stupid,'' ``bad,'' ``inadvertent''--inappropriate law. And I would like you to take a look at that, and I would like your view as to the appropriate range of discretion for a key member of the Justice Department to not enforce the law because he/she doesn't agree with it. And I expressed myself as being very offended by that position. The individual said that Congress didn't understand the law when they passed it. He made an exception for me because I was a former prosecutor and had a pretty good academic record like you men do. But I think that is a very serious matter, and when Congress passes a law, we expect it to be observed, just as your observance, Mr. Chertoff, of the Miranda rule, which is another very complex subject. I had a chance to talk to you briefly yesterday, Mr. Chertoff, about the issue of criminal prosecutions for commercial conduct where there is conscious disregard of the safety of others resulting in death, came into sharp focus last year in the Ford/Firestone tire issue, and reckless disregard for the safety of others is the equivalent of malice, and where death results, can support a conviction for murder in the second degree at common law and under State statutory provisions. I would like you to take a look at that in your work. Part of the legislation which I introduced on Ford/Firestone was incorporated into the final bill. And we have seen many manufacturers, regrettably, put products into commerce where they know that death may result. And we talk a lot about punitive damages, and punitive damages are under a lot of criticism for being excessive. And I have had a concern about the ineffectiveness. But if there was a criminal sanction, that really could be effective and might lead to a re-evaluation as to punitive damages in a civil context. The one question I want to ask you, Mr. Chertoff, relates to programs such as Project Exile in Richmond and Ceasefire in Philadelphia. We brought a special task force to the Eastern District back in 1988, and I would like your observations as to how the Criminal Division can be more effective. Gun control is a matter of enormous controversy, but nobody disagrees that there ought to be very tough measures cracking down on criminals who violate the laws with guns, as, for example, the armed career criminal bill. I would be interested in your views on that. Mr. Chertoff. I would be happy to talk about it, Senator. Obviously, the Attorney General has expressed to this Committee and elsewhere his strong commitment and intent to make enforcement of existing gun laws a priority. I have experience actually as U.S. Attorney with a similar program. We had Project Triggerlock in my district. And I found it to be a very effective way of dealing with the issue of criminals who either possess guns when they should not or who use guns in the commission of felonies. We worked very constructively with State authorities in selecting cases where we really could take some of the worst actors off the street and take their guns away and achieve real deterrence. I think both as chief of the Criminal Division, if confirmed, and also as one who would work with U.S. Attorneys, it is critical that we devote as much as we can in terms of resources and energy to these kinds of programs to get guns and the threat of gun violence off the streets and out of the hands of criminals. Senator Specter. Professor Dinh, you have confirmation for the Office of Policy Development. If you could pick out just one policy that you would like to develop, what would it be? Mr. Dinh. Thank you very much, Senator. I think it is the opportunity, if confirmed, to work on the improvement of the administration of justice, to ensure that the protection of the law is available to all equally. The promise of that security-- Senator Specter. On achieving that, do you think it is important to confirm Federal judges? Mr. Dinh. I think that is also very important to confirm Federal judges. Senator Specter. I am sorry the panel is so limited to Republicans, but that word may be transmitted. Go ahead, sir. Mr. Dinh. I think it is very important for the administration and also the country to not only have judges nominated but also confirmed and appointed in order to meet the workload of the Federal judiciary, yes. Senator Specter. Thank you very much, Professor Dinh. Thank you, Mr. Chertoff. Thank you. Chairman Hatch. Thank you, Senator Specter. I am going to turn back to Senator Leahy who has some additional questions. He is on the phone for right now. Do you have any questions, Senator Sessions? Senator Sessions. Yes. Chairman Hatch. Senator Leahy is here, though. We will turn back to Senator Leahy for his questions. Senator Leahy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am trying to juggle an Appropriations Committee at the same time, and I know you would much rather I stay here. Chairman Hatch. No, no. I think Appropriations-- [Laughter.] Senator Leahy. I was waiting. Chairman Hatch. No, I would rather have you stay here. I want to get these people confirmed, and we need you, Senator, and we are hoping that you will be willing to do that tomorrow. Senator Leahy. As I said in my opening, we usually give a week for the submission of any questions and obviously when some of the-- Chairman Hatch. You will have plenty of time before they call it up on the floor, and, frankly, these two people are so well known that I just cannot imagine delaying any further. Senator Leahy. Mr. Chairman, you and I have discussed the need for an executive session tomorrow, which we will not-- Chairman Hatch. We are not going to have an executive session tomorrow. I am willing to maybe have one tonight, if you want to, because we recess until the call of the Chair. So I am willing to meet at 6 o'clock tonight. But if not, then we are going to mark up tomorrow. Everybody understands all this? If you don't want to vote for the people, you can vote against them. Senator Leahy. Mr. Chairman, I think one of the things we will do is follow the Senate Rules. Chairman Hatch. That is what I am doing. Senator Leahy. Of course, you can call a meeting any time you want, and once you have a quorum, then anybody can move to-- Chairman Hatch. And you can keep us from having a quorum, like you did last week. And if you do that, you are going to have to face the problems to that. Senator Leahy. Mr. Chairman, I told you last week that two of the nominees required an executive session to discuss matters in the-- Chairman Hatch. Then we will meet at 6 tonight. I am willing to accommodate you. Senator Leahy. And you did not want to go forward with that last week, but let's be very serious about this. I was trying to also protect the names of those we want to go in executive session about, and I have been trying to work out a time with you to do that that is realistic. Chairman Hatch. I am not putting off the markup for one more day. I will accommodate you. We had two private meetings on nominees. Every issue has been raised. I don't see any reason for an executive session, but if you want one, I will hold one tonight, which is the only way I can do it. And I will accommodate you. You tell me what time after 6 o'clock you want to have it, I will have it, or even before 6. But it is difficult for all of us until 6 o'clock. Senator Leahy. Mr. Chairman, I don't-- Chairman Hatch. But I will accommodate you. Senator Leahy. I don't think it is fair-- Chairman Hatch. It is not fair to ask for an executive session after two closed sessions. Senator Leahy. Mr. Chairman, it is not fair to talk about the reason for the executive session because we do-- Chairman Hatch. It is not fair to even raise executive sessions at this point, in my view, after we had two private sessions where every issue was raised. Senator Leahy. Mr. Chairman, we have not had an executive session about the FBI reports on some of the nominees. We have a right to have that. Chairman Hatch. We have had executive--we have had private sessions, and every Senator is informed and aware who was there, and every Senator was asked to come. Senator Leahy. Have we had an executive session on the background reports on any of the nominees so far this year? Chairman Hatch. I am willing to have one this evening, if you want one. Senator Leahy. Have we had any yet? Chairman Hatch. We hardly have ever had one in my 25 years in the Senate. Senator Leahy. I have been here for-- Chairman Hatch. So I am willing to accommodate you. If you want one, tell me what time after 6 o'clock, and I will be here, and we will have an executive session to meet this technical requirement of yours. Senator Leahy. Mr. Chairman, you-- Chairman Hatch. But I am not going to fail to go ahead with the markup tomorrow. If you don't want to show up, that is your business. Senator Leahy. Mr. Chairman, you and I jointly requested, as I recall, on one nominee an executive session, and-- Chairman Hatch. We are not jointly requesting it this time. I am willing to grant it for you. Senator Leahy. Maybe that was because it was a nominee of a Democrat that we-- Chairman Hatch. It had nothing to do with it. I have been fair to Democrats. You may criticize some people on our side, but you can't criticize me on that. Senator Leahy. Mr. Chertoff, the drafts of the report of the Whitewater Special Committee were given to the press several days before the report was officially released by the Committee. Was that improper, especially as it did not include the report of the Democrats on that Committee? Mr. Chertoff. Senator, I don't know the circumstances under which things were provided to the press in that instance. I can tell you, though, in terms of the work of the Criminal Division and the work of prosecutors in general-- Senator Leahy. But you recall that thing happening? Mr. Chertoff. I remember there being press reports anticipating things that were going to be said in the report. Senator Leahy. Would it have been proper for members to release part of the report, the part just of the then-majority members, the Republican members, and not those of the Democratic members? Mr. Chertoff. Senator, again, as I recall the rules at that time--and I have to say it's been several years--there were certain matters that were confidential which had been agreed upon by both sides, which has to be maintained confidentially. As to how conclusions or parts of reports were released, I don't know how the press got what they got. I don't remember what they got. Senator Leahy. There was never any investigation in the Committee of that? Mr. Chertoff. I think the Committee's work concluded within a matter of days thereafter. Senator Leahy. One of the ground rules for the Whitewater Committee's investigation was that all fact finding was to be conducted jointly by majority and minority Committee representatives. During the Whitewater Committee investigation, did you ever have any communications with the Office of Independent Counsel, Kenneth Starr, to which a member of the minority staff was not a party? Mr. Chertoff. Senator, as I recall, the resolution that set up the Committee mandated that the Committee coordinate with Mr. Starr's office in terms of the issue of witnesses. And I recollect there being conversations from time to time either that were had by the Chairman or by lawyers on the staff concerning whether particular witnesses would be called or not. I don't know that minority Senators or counsel were present for all those conversations, but I think the substance of the conversations was always relayed. And, likewise, my recollection-- Senator Leahy. But if they weren't there, would that have been violative of the Whitewater Committee's rules? Mr. Chertoff. I don't think so, Senator, because my recollection is also that the minority also from time to time had contact with potential witnesses-- Senator Leahy. Did you ever get any evidence from the Office of the Independent Counsel without the knowledge of a member of the minority staff? Mr. Chertoff. Not that I'm aware of. Senator Leahy. Did you ever have any conversations with anyone from the Office of the Independent Counsel concerning witnesses who were to testify before the Whitewater Committee? Mr. Chertoff. Well, as I said, Senator, my recollection of the original resolution required the Committee to consult with the special counsel regarding the issue of witnesses, witness availability, and the issue of immunity, obviously. So I know there were conversations that were had by the Chairman and by attorneys with attorneys from Mr. Starr's staff concerning the issue of whether witnesses would be made available. And, again, as I recall, I think that the substance of those communications were made available to the minority. And as I have to say, my recollection is the minority also from time to time had conversations with witnesses and then would tell us about it after the fact. But there was no evidence that was conveyed that wasn't made available to both sides. Senator Leahy. You realize what I am doing on some of these questions, like my first question, giving you a chance to answer some of the things that have been floating out that that might not get asked otherwise. Now, Senator Hatch and I had the honor, really, of representing the Senate and this Committee at the funeral of Justice Brennan. In fact, I recall that we sat with the Attorney General and the President and First Lady. I had the rare pleasure of--it was St. Matthew's Cathedral--of translating the Latin for everybody, which should make my Jesuit professors happy, I suppose. And I am sure you found that experience to be a great one, clerking for Justice Brennan, especially as we learn more about how he many times was the one that could mold--be a bridge of the conservatives and liberals on the Court. And I only raise that because we have had a couple nominees here who clerked for Justice Brennan, and some on the other side have said that is a reason to deny moving forward quickly on their nominations. I am sure you don't share that. Mr. Chertoff. I think it was a privilege to clerk for Justice Brennan, and I think anybody who had that experience greatly benefited from it. Senator Leahy. Now, Professor Dinh, you have distinguished yourself so much academically. Your story is, of course, a compelling one. Your parents, I am so happy that they can be here with you. We are actually honored by the presence of your father and mother in this Committee room. As you know, so many people of your generation who fled never saw their parents again, never saw their siblings again. And so you are twice blessed by having been able to escape and by having your parents, who strike me as being very distinguished in their own right to be here with you. And I am sure you realize that truly is a blessing. It goes beyond anything else that might happen in your life. Mr. Dinh. Yes, sir, very, very much so. Senator Leahy. Now, you have not represented clients in a trial or in a courtroom. You have been involved in a number of investigations into President Clinton, former President Clinton, but not been in a courtroom. But you are going to have to screen and evaluate candidates for the Federal bench. Seventy percent of them are going to be candidates to serve as judges in the trial bench. How do you do that? I mean, I know there is a merit-based evaluation system set up by Assistant Attorney General Eleanor Acheson during the Clinton administration. But, I mean, how do you do this? Because you don't have experience in the courts. Nobody is questioning your brilliance or your abilities, but everybody has been a trial lawyer, Senator Sessions has, Senator Hatch has, I have, others. That is sort of a unique experience. How do you go about evaluating especially those who are going to be on the trial bench? Mr. Dinh. Senator, let me begin by saying that I understand that the traditional role of the component has been, with some exceptions, to be helpful in the judicial selection and nomination process. I have not had any specific conversations regarding the role of the component if I should be confirmed, but to the extent that I am involved in the judicial nomination process, it seems to me that the fitness for judicial office can be characterized generally as men and women of deep personal character, of professional and intellectual competence, and those who possess a commitment to the rule of law and an appreciation for the proper role of a judge in a democratic society. I recognize from your question my lack of experience in an actual courtroom. I fully plan, if confirmed, to augment that lack of experience by relying upon the advice of staff who are experienced in that process in order to make these types of evaluations, especially on the trial bench, in order to fit these--find men and women that fit these criteria. Senator Leahy. Does that mean talking to these people, talking with those who have appeared against them in court, or with them in court? Mr. Dinh. At minimum, it will be a personal interview, but it goes beyond that process. If I am confirmed, and to the extent that I am involved in this process, I anticipate to be talking to counsel who have worked with a particular prospect, a particular candidate, both for and against that person in a counsel capacity, perhaps even talking with judges who have seen firsthand the demeanor and professional character of these particular attorneys who may be candidates and from that sense get a good impression of his or her character and also professional competence. Senator Leahy. There is that one part that it is impossible to define, sort of to paraphrase Justice Potter Stewart in another case, you know it when you see it, and that is judicial temperament. There is so much power in the Federal court, especially at trial level. They can become autocratic. They can become abusive to attorneys. And they basically can get away with it. Now, in the past, there has always been a lot of use of the professional attorneys and others in the Department of Justice, those who continue on no matter who is President, to help with that evaluation. Would you see any reason to discontinue that practice? Mr. Dinh. No, Senator. I do believe that our system of justice is the front door and really the most prominent feature o"
