Oracle Corp. Thursday continued its string of acquisitions, announcing it will buy content management software company Stellent Inc. for about US$440 million.

Stellent becomes Oracle’s latest buy, following its acquisition of companies like Siebel Systems Inc., and PeopleSoft Inc..

Oracle offered Stellent shareholders $13.50 per share in a cash deal. It said Stellent’s Universal Content Management would be integrated with its own Content Database to expand its content management offerings.

The transaction is subject to customary conditions and is expected to close at the end of this calendar year or early 2007, Oracle said.

Stellent also announced second quarter 2007 revenues of $33.7 million, with profits of $1.3 million.
