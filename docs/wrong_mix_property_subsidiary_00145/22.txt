Oracle Corp. reported a 25-per-cent rise in quarterly profit yesterday, boosted by higher-than-expected sales of new software. The company's revenue and earnings per share excluding special items beat average Wall Street expectations. Profit jumped to $840-million (U.S.), or 16 cents a share, for the first quarter ended Aug. 31, from $670-million, or 13 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 26 per cent to $4.53-billion, beating the average analyst target of $4.36-billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Earnings, excluding items such as acquisition-related charges, were 22 cents a share. The results were buoyed by sales of products that were not in its lineup a year ago. Oracle added them after buying Hyperion Solutions Corp., Stellent Inc., MetaSolv Inc. and others over the past year. ORCL (Nasdaq) rose 20 cents to $21.04.
