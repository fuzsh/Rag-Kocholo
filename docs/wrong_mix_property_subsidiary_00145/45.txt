Enterprise Content Management (or ECM) allows users to share content across the enterprise, automate document workflow, and consolidate web sites into a single platform.

About 80% of all data is unstructured (doesn't fit into rows and columns). ECM is Oracle's solution for storing unstructured content like documents, web pages, videos, images, etc.

Main products are:

Content DB Suite (Oracle Content DB or Stellent's Content Server)
