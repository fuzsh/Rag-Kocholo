        "text": "Principal Architect\n\nRelativity\n\n•\n\nChicago, USA\n\n2020-2023 Researched, designed, and orchestrated the move of Relativity's monolithic, tenant-specific, VM-hosted workloads into Azure-based Kubernetes clusters with minimal code changes. Doing so required significant consensus building across the organization and breaking existing code hosting paradigms both architecturally and culturally. This move represented a multimillion-dollar reduction in COGS for Relativity's flagship SaaS product.\n\n2018-2019 Successfully championed Kubernetes to the C-suite over several Azure-specific options. Oversaw and coordinated the development and global roll out of the initial clusters and workloads. After much consensus building and under significant pressure from leadership, the first feature driven by the new Kubernetes clusters was available to beta customers in only 7 months.\n\n2022 Clarified the benefits of Apache Spark to the organization through a self-directed R&D effort comparing its performance on a large Avro-based data set versus a time-boxed, hand-coded, C# implementation.\n\n2018 Revitalized a software group struggling from a lack of technological leadership and negative management. Streamlined the existing 'process heavy' culture while coaching and mentoring the teams as we re-architected a complex text ingestion pipeline at the core of Relativity's search functionality. The top results were significantly improved team satisfaction scores and a 3X performance increase in search indexing speed.\n\n2017 Solved critical issues causing significant negative customer feedback on the newly released Relativity One SaaS product. Leveraged front-end coding skills to improve the average navigation time between documents, the most common user workflow in Relativity, from several seconds to well under half a second and in many cases into the 10s of milliseconds range."
