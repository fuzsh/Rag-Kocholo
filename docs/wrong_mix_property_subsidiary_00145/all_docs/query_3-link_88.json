B-1 Appendix C Opinion of A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc. C-1 Appendix D Section 351.455 of the General and Business Corporation Law of Missouri D-1\n\nii\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n\nThe following are some of the questions that you, as a shareholder of TALX, may have, and answers to those questions. These questions and answers, as well as the following summary, are not meant to be a substitute for the information contained in the remainder of this document, and this information is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed descriptions and explanations contained elsewhere in this document. We urge you to read this document in its entirety prior to making any decision.\n\nQ: Why am I receiving this document?\n\nA:Equifax and TALX have entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which they have agreed to combine their respective businesses by means of a merger of TALX with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Equifax. TALX is holding a special meeting of its shareholders in order to obtain shareholder approval of the merger agreement, as described in this document. We will be unable to complete the merger unless shareholders holding two-thirds of the outstanding shares of TALX common stock approve the merger agreement at the special meeting.\n\nWe have included in this document important information about the merger, the merger agreement, and the special meeting of the shareholders of TALX. You should read this information carefully and in its entirety. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Appendix A to this document. The enclosed voting materials allow you to vote your shares without attending the TALX special meeting. Your vote is very important and we encourage you to vote your proxy as soon as possible.\n\nQ: What will I be entitled to receive in the merger?\n\nA:If the merger is completed, for each share of TALX common stock that you own, you will have the right to elect to receive either 0.861 of a share of Equifax common stock, or $35.50 in cash, without interest. However, under the merger agreement, Equifax and TALX have agreed that, regardless of the elections made by TALX shareholders, 75% of the outstanding shares of TALX common stock will be converted into shares of Equifax common stock, and the remaining 25% of the shares will be converted into cash. Therefore, the cash and stock elections that you make will be subject to proration to preserve this requirement. As a result, you could receive cash or shares of Equifax common stock for greater or fewer TALX shares than you specify in your election. The consideration payable to TALX shareholders in connection with the merger, and these election procedures, are described in more detail under the heading \"The Merger AgreementMerger Consideration\" on page 69.\n\nQ: When and how must I elect the type of merger consideration that I want to receive?\n\nA:If you are a holder of record of TALX common stock, you should carefully review and follow the instructions set forth in the election form that is provided with this document. These instructions require that a properly completed and signed election form be received by the exchange agent by the election deadline, which is 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on [  ], 2007. Holders of record who do not submit a properly completed and signed election form to the exchange agent by the election deadline will have no control over the type of merger consideration they receive, and, as a consequence, may receive only cash, only Equifax common stock, or a combination of cash and Equifax common stock as a result of the merger.\n\nIf your shares of TALX common stock are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you must follow your broker's, bank's, or other nominee's procedures for electing the type of merger consideration that you want to receive in the merger. If you do not properly follow these instructions for election, you will have no control over the type of merger\n\n1\n\nconsideration you receive, and, as a consequence, may receive only cash, only Equifax common stock, or a combination of cash and Equifax common stock as a result of the merger.\n\nQ: Can I change my election after I submit my election form?\n\nA:Yes. A holder of record of TALX common stock can revoke an election and submit new election materials before the election deadline by submitting a written notice to the exchange agent that is received prior to the election deadline at the following address:\n\nThe revocation must specify the account name and such other information as the exchange agent may request, and revocations may not be made in part. New elections must be submitted in accordance with the election procedures described in this document.\n\nIf you instructed a broker, bank, or other nominee to submit an election for your shares, you must follow your broker's, bank's, or other nominee's directions for changing those instructions.\n\nQ: What should I do with my share certificates?\n\nA:Do not send in your share certificates for TALX common stock with your proxy card or election form.\n\nIn order to receive the merger consideration, holders of record of TALX common stock will be required to send their share certificates to the exchange agent. If you are a holder of record, you may send your share certificates to the exchange agent following completion of the merger by following the directions set forth in the letter of transmittal that will be sent to TALX shareholders after the merger. Holders of record will not be entitled to receive the merger consideration following completion of the merger until their share certificates (or other acceptable evidence of ownership) are received by the exchange agent.\n\nIf your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you should follow your broker's, bank's, or other nominee's instructions for receiving the merger consideration.\n\nQ: What is required to complete the merger?\n\nA:We are not required to complete the merger unless a number of conditions are satisfied or waived. These conditions include receipt of approval of TALX shareholders, expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, and receipt of legal opinions that the merger will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which we refer to as the Code. For a more complete summary of the conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to completion of the merger, see \"The Merger AgreementConditions to the Merger\" beginning on page 86.\n\nQ: When and where will the special meeting of TALX shareholders be held?\n\nA:The special meeting of TALX shareholders is scheduled to be held at the Ritz-Carlton of St. Louis, 100 Carondelet Plaza, St. Louis, Missouri 63105, St. Louis time, on [  ], 2007 at [  ] a.m., unless it is postponed or adjourned.\n\n2\n\nQ: Who is entitled to vote at the TALX special meeting?\n\nA:TALX has fixed [  ], 2007 as the record date for the TALX special meeting. If you were a TALX shareholder at the close of business on the record date, you are entitled to vote on matters that come before the TALX special meeting. However, a TALX shareholder may only vote his or her shares if he or she is present in person, or is represented by proxy, at the special meeting.\n\nQ: How do I vote?\n\nA:If you are entitled to vote at the special meeting, you can vote in person by completing a ballot at the special meeting, or you can vote by proxy before the special meeting. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to vote your shares by proxy as soon as possible. After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this document, please submit your proxy by telephone or Internet in accordance with the instructions set forth on the enclosed proxy card, or fill out, sign, and date the proxy card, and then mail your signed proxy card in the enclosed envelope as soon as possible so that your shares may be voted at the special meeting.\n\nFor detailed information, please see \"Information About the TALX Special MeetingHow to Vote\" beginning on page 65.\n\nQ: If I hold my TALX shares in \"street name,\" how are they voted?\n\nA:If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the \"beneficial holder\" of the shares held for you in what is known as \"street name.\" If this is the case, this document has been forwarded to you by your brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, or its agent. As the beneficial holder, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, or other nominee as to how to vote your shares at the special meeting. If you do not provide your broker, bank, or other nominee with instructions on how to vote your \"street name\" shares, your broker, bank, or other nominee will not be permitted to vote them on the proposal to approve the merger agreement. You should therefore be sure to provide your broker, bank, or other nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares at the special meeting.\n\nQ: How many votes do I have?\n\nA:You are entitled to one vote for each share of TALX common stock that you owned as of the record date for the special meeting. As of the close of business on [  ], 2007, there were [  ] outstanding shares of TALX common stock. As of that date, [  ]% of the outstanding shares of TALX common stock were held by the directors and executive officers of TALX.\n\nQ: What constitutes a quorum for purposes of the special meeting?\n\nA:Shareholders who hold at least a majority of the outstanding shares of TALX common stock as of the close of business on the record date must be present, either in person or represented by proxy, in order for there to be a quorum necessary to conduct business at the TALX special meeting.\n\nAbstentions and shares voted by a broker, bank, or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum.\n\nQ: What vote is required to approve the merger agreement, and what is the effect of not voting?\n\nA:The affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of TALX common stock entitled to vote is required to approve the merger agreement. Because the affirmative vote required to approve the merger agreement is based upon the total number of outstanding TALX shares, the failure to submit a proxy card (or to submit a proxy by telephone or by Internet or to vote in person at the TALX special meeting) or the abstention from voting by a shareholder will\n\n3\n\nhave the same effect as a vote against approval of the merger agreement. Brokers, banks, or other nominees holding TALX common stock as nominees will not have discretionary authority to vote those shares in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owners of those shares, so the failure to provide voting instructions to your broker, bank, or nominee will also have the same effect as a vote against approval of the merger agreement.\n\nQ: What is the recommendation of the TALX board of directors?\n\nA:The TALX board of directors recommends that TALX shareholders vote \"FOR\" the proposal to approve the merger agreement. See \"The MergerTALX's Reasons for the Merger\" beginning on page 33, and \"The MergerRecommendation of the TALX Board of Directors\" beginning on page 36.\n\nQ: What if I return my proxy but do not mark it to show how I am voting?\n\nA:If your proxy card is signed and returned without specifying your choice, your shares will be voted \"FOR\" the approval of the merger agreement according to the recommendation of TALX's board of directors.\n\nQ: Can I change my vote after I have submitted a proxy by telephone or Internet or mailed my signed proxy card?\n\nA:Yes. You can change your vote by revoking your proxy at any time before it is exercised at the special meeting. You can revoke your proxy in one of four ways:\n\nvote again by telephone or Internet prior to midnight on the night before the special meeting;\n\nsign another proxy card with a later date and return it prior to the special meeting;\n\nattend the special meeting and complete a ballot; or\n\nsend a written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary of TALX.\n\nIf your shares of TALX common stock are held by a broker, bank, or other nominee, you must follow your broker's, bank's, or other nominee's procedures for changing your instructions on how to vote.\n\nQ: What are the tax consequences of the merger to me?\n\nA:Neither Equifax nor TALX will be required to complete the merger unless it receives a legal opinion to the effect that the merger will qualify as a \"reorganization\" for United States federal income tax purposes. Therefore, we expect the transaction to generally be tax-free to holders of TALX common stock for federal income tax purposes except to the extent that they receive cash, including the cash consideration in the merger and any cash that they receive instead of fractional shares of Equifax common stock.\n\nThose holders receiving solely cash for their TALX common stock generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and their tax basis in their shares of TALX common stock. Those holders receiving both Equifax common stock and cash for their TALX common stock generally will recognize gain equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of cash received and (ii) the excess of the \"amount realized\" in the transaction (i.e., the fair market value of the Equifax common stock at the effective time of the merger plus the amount of cash received) over their tax basis in their TALX common stock. In certain circumstances, the gain or, in the case of recipients of cash only, the entire amount of cash received, could be taxable as ordinary income rather than as a capital gain.\n\n4\n\nQ: What risks should I consider before I vote on the merger?\n\nA:We encourage you to read carefully the detailed information about the merger and the merger agreement contained in this document, including the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" beginning on page 23.\n\nQ: When do you expect the merger to be completed?\n\nA:We are working to complete the merger late in the second or early in the third quarter of 2007. However, the merger is subject to various regulatory approvals and other conditions, and it is possible that factors outside the control of both companies could result in the merger being completed at a later time, or not at all. We cannot assure you as to when all of the conditions to the merger will be met, nor can we predict the exact timing of the merger. It is possible that we will not complete the merger.\n\nQ: What do I need to do now?\n\nA:Please read and consider carefully the information contained in this document, and then vote your shares as soon as possible so that your shares may be represented at the TALX special meeting.\n\nQ: Do I have dissenters' rights of appraisal if I object to the merger?\n\nA:Yes. As a holder of TALX common stock, you are entitled to dissenters' rights of appraisal under the General and Business Corporation Law of Missouri, which we refer to as the MBCL, in connection with the merger if you meet certain conditions, which conditions are described in this document under the heading \"The MergerDissenters' Rights of Appraisal\" beginning on page 62.\n\nQ: Who can help answer my questions?\n\nA:If you have questions about the merger, or if you need assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares or need additional copies of this document or the enclosed proxy card, you should contact Mellon Investor Services L.L.C., which we refer to as Mellon Investor Services, the proxy solicitation agent for TALX, at [  ] (toll free) or (201) 680-5285 (collect). If your shares are held by a broker, bank, or other nominee, you should call your broker, bank, or other nominee for additional information.\n\n5\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThis summary highlights selected information about the merger described elsewhere in this document and does not contain all of the information that may be important to you. You should carefully read this entire document and the other documents to which this document refers for a more complete understanding of the matters being considered at the special meeting.

Unless we have stated otherwise, all references in this document to Equifax are to Equifax Inc., all references to TALX are to TALX Corporation, all references to Merger Sub are to Chipper Corporation, and all references to the merger agreement are to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated February 14, 2007, by and among Equifax, TALX and Merger Sub, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A to this document.\n\nThe Companies (Page 27)\n\nTALX Corporation\n\nTALX Corporation\n\n11432 Lackland Road\n\nSt. Louis, Missouri 63146\n\n(314) 214-7000\n\nTALX Corporation was incorporated in Missouri in 1971. TALX is a leading provider of payroll-related and human resources business process outsourcing services. TALX's services enable clients to outsource and automate the performance of certain payroll and human resources business processes that would otherwise be performed by their own in-house payroll and/or human resources departments. TALX's clients are primarily large and mid-size organizations, including more than three-fourths of the Fortune 500 companies in a wide variety of industries, as well as a number of government agencies and public sector organizations. Current services offered by TALX include employment and income verification and other payroll-related services, unemployment tax management services, tax credit and incentive services, and talent management services.\n\nEquifax\n\nEquifax Inc.\n\n1550 Peachtree Street, N.W.\n\nAtlanta, Georgia 30309\n\n(404) 885-8000\n\nEquifax Inc. was incorporated in Georgia in 1913, its common stock has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange, which we refer to as the NYSE, since 1971, and it is a member of the S&P 500 and certain other indices. Equifax collects, organizes, and manages numerous types of credit, financial, public record, demographic, and marketing information regarding individuals and businesses. Its products and services include consumer credit information, information database management, marketing information, business credit information, decisioning and analytical tools, and identity verification services that enable businesses to make informed decisions about extending credit or service, mitigate fraud, manage portfolio risk, and develop marketing strategies for consumers and businesses. Equifax also sells products directly via the Internet and in various hard-copy formats to consumers to enable them to manage and protect their financial affairs.\n\nMerger Sub\n\nChipper Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Equifax, which we refer to as Merger Sub, is a Missouri corporation formed on February 14, 2007 for the purpose of effecting the merger. Upon completion of the merger, TALX will be merged with and into Merger Sub. The resulting company will\n\n6\n\nbe called \"TALX Corporation\" and will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Equifax. Merger Sub has not conducted any activities other than those incidental to its formation and the matters contemplated by the merger agreement, including the preparation of applicable regulatory filings in connection with the merger.\n\nThe Merger (Page 29)\n\nThe transaction will be implemented by means of a merger of TALX Corporation with and into Merger Sub. As a result of the merger, TALX will cease to exist as a separate corporation. The resulting company will be re-named \"TALX Corporation,\" and will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Equifax.\n\nMerger Consideration (Page 69)\n\nIf the merger is completed, you will have the right to elect to receive either $35.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.861 of a share of Equifax common stock, for each share of TALX common stock that you own. For example, if you own 100 shares of TALX common stock, you could elect to receive cash in exchange for 40 shares and shares of Equifax common stock in exchange for the other 60 shares.\n\nHowever, regardless of the elections made by individual TALX shareholders, Equifax and TALX have agreed to fix the number of shares of TALX common stock that will be converted into shares of Equifax common stock, and the number of shares that will be converted into cash. Under the merger agreement, 75% of the shares of TALX common stock outstanding immediately before completion of the merger will be converted into shares of Equifax common stock, and the remaining 25% of the shares will be converted into cash. Therefore, the cash and stock elections that you make with respect to your shares of TALX common stock will be subject to proration to preserve this requirement.\n\nSpecifically, if TALX shareholders elect to receive more stock or cash than is provided for under the merger agreement, elections for the over-subscribed form of merger consideration will be prorated so that the overall 75/25 split of the merger consideration is achieved. For example, if TALX shareholders elect in the aggregate to exchange more than 75% of the outstanding TALX shares for shares of Equifax common stock, then TALX shareholders who elected to receive Equifax common stock for shares of TALX common stock will receive for those TALX shares a pro rata portion of the available Equifax shares plus cash for those TALX shares not converted into Equifax common stock. As a result, you could receive cash or shares of Equifax stock for greater or fewer TALX shares than you specify in your election.\n\nBased upon the closing sales price of Equifax common stock as reported on the NYSE on March 15, 2007, the per share consideration to be received by TALX shareholders who receive Equifax stock in the merger is $31.81. The implied value of the stock consideration will fluctuate as the market price of Equifax common stock fluctuates and, because elections are subject to proration as described above, there can be no assurance that you will receive Equifax common stock, rather than cash, as to each share of TALX common stock for which you make a stock election. Equifax common stock trades on the NYSE under the ticker symbol \"EFX.\" TALX common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol \"TALX.\" You may obtain current market price quotations for each company's common stock from newspapers, over the Internet, or from other sources.\n\nHolders of TALX common stock who receive shares of Equifax common stock in the merger will not receive any fractional shares of Equifax common stock. Instead, the total number of shares of Equifax common stock that a TALX shareholder will receive in the merger will be rounded down to the nearest whole number and Equifax will pay cash for any resulting fractional share of Equifax common stock that a TALX shareholder otherwise would be entitled to receive. The amount of cash payable for a fractional share of Equifax common stock will be determined by multiplying the fraction (rounded down to the nearest one-hundredth of a share) by the average closing price for a share of\n\n7\n\nEquifax common stock for the five trading days ending on and including the last trading day prior to the date on which the merger is completed.\n\nConversion of Shares; Exchange of Certificates; Elections as to Form of Consideration (Page 72)\n\nRecord Holders\n\nIf you are a holder of record of TALX common stock and wish to elect the type of merger consideration that you want to receive in the merger, you should carefully review and follow the instructions set forth in the election form that is provided with this document. These instructions require that a properly completed and signed election form be received by Computershare Investor Services, LLC, the exchange agent, by the election deadline, which is 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on [  ], 2007. Holders of record who do not submit a properly completed and signed election form to the exchange agent by the election deadline will have no control over the type of merger consideration they receive. Their shares will be treated as \"non-electing shares\" as described on page 69, and as a consequence, they may receive only cash, only Equifax common stock, or a combination of cash and Equifax common stock as a result of the merger.\n\nA holder of record of TALX common stock can revoke an election and submit new election materials before the election deadline. This may be done by submitting a written notice to the exchange agent that is received before the election deadline at the following address:\n\nThe revocation must specify the account name and such other information as the exchange agent may request, and revocations may not be made in part. New elections must be submitted in accordance with the election procedures described in this document.\n\nDo not send your TALX stock certificates in the envelope provided for returning your proxy card or in the envelope provided for returning your election form.\n\nIn order to receive the merger consideration, holders of record of TALX common stock will be required to send their share certificates to the exchange agent. Before or promptly after the effective time of the merger, Equifax will cause the exchange agent to provide a letter of transmittal reasonably agreed upon by Equifax and TALX to each holder of record of TALX common stock as of the effective time of the merger, advising them of the procedures for surrendering their share certificates to the exchange agent. You may send your share certificates to the exchange agent by following the directions set forth in this letter of transmittal. Holders of record will not be entitled to receive the merger consideration following completion of the merger until their share certificates (or other acceptable evidence of ownership) are received by the exchange agent.\n\nIf your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you should follow your broker's, bank's, or other nominee's instructions for receiving the merger consideration.\n\nStreet Name Holders\n\nIf your shares of TALX common stock are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you must follow your broker's, bank's, or other nominee's procedures for electing the type of merger consideration that you want to receive in the merger. If you do not properly follow these instructions for election, you will have no control over the type of merger consideration you\n\n8\n\nreceive, and, as a consequence, you may receive only cash, only Equifax common stock, or a combination of cash and Equifax common stock as a result of the merger.\n\nIf you instructed a broker, bank, or other nominee to submit an election for your shares and you want to change that election, you must follow your broker's, bank's, or other nominee's directions for changing those instructions.\n\nIf your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you should follow your broker's, bank's, or other nominee's instructions for receiving the merger consideration.\n\nRecommendation of the TALX Board of Directors (Page 36)\n\nAfter careful consideration, the TALX board of directors approved the merger agreement. The TALX board of directors recommends that TALX's shareholders vote \"FOR\" the approval of the merger agreement.\n\nThe TALX board of directors consulted with TALX's management and TALX's legal and financial advisors in its evaluation of the merger and, in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and to recommend that TALX shareholders vote to approve the merger agreement, considered a number of strategic, financial, and other considerations referred to under \"The MergerTALX's Reasons for the Merger\" beginning on page 33.\n\nOpinions of TALX's Financial Advisors (Page 37)\n\nCIBC World Markets Corp.\n\nIn connection with the merger, the TALX board of directors received a written opinion of CIBC World Markets Corp., which we refer to as CIBC World Markets, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the merger consideration to be received by holders of TALX common stock. The full text of CIBC World Markets' written opinion, dated February 14, 2007, is attached to this document as Appendix B. Holders of TALX common stock are encouraged to read this opinion carefully in its entirety for a description of the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations on the review undertaken. CIBC World Markets' opinion was provided to the TALX board of directors in connection with its evaluation of the merger consideration from a financial point of view. CIBC World Markets' opinion does not address any other aspect of the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder as to any election to be made by such shareholder with respect to the merger consideration or as to how any such shareholder should vote or act with respect to any matters relating to the merger.\n\nA.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc.\n\nOn February 14, 2007, at a meeting of the TALX board of directors held to review the proposed transaction, A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., which we refer to as A.G. Edwards, delivered to the TALX board of directors its written opinion, dated February 14, 2007, to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations described in the opinion, the merger consideration described below to be received by TALX's shareholders in respect of each share of TALX common stock in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of TALX common stock. The full text of A.G. Edwards' opinion describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by A.G. Edwards. A.G. Edwards' opinion is attached as Appendix C to this document and is incorporated by reference. A.G. Edwards' opinion is directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the merger consideration to be received by the holders of TALX common stock and does not address any other aspect of the transaction. A.G. Edwards' opinion does not address the merits of the underlying decision of TALX to\n\n9\n\nenter into the transaction and does not represent a recommendation as to how shareholders should vote with respect to the merger. Additionally, A.G. Edwards is not expressing any opinion as to whether shareholders of TALX should elect to receive cash or Equifax common stock as consideration in the transaction. Holders of TALX common stock are encouraged to read the opinion carefully in its entirety.\n\nTreatment of TALX Stock Options and Restricted Stock in the Merger (Page 57)\n\nThe vesting of all outstanding TALX stock options and shares of restricted stock will accelerate upon a \"change of control,\" as defined in the applicable plan or agreement, except for any shares of restricted stock or options awarded after the date of the merger agreement. All outstanding TALX stock options (whether vested or unvested) will be converted into options to acquire shares of Equifax common stock at exercise prices determined in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. Each share of restricted stock will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $35.50 in cash or 0.861 of a share of Equifax common stock in accordance with the allocation procedures described in the merger agreement.\n\nInterests of TALX's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (Page 52)\n\nYou should be aware that some of the directors and executive officers of TALX have interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of TALX shareholders generally. These interests relate to the treatment of equity-based compensation awards held by directors and executive officers of TALX in the merger, the appointment of the Chairman of the Board of TALX as a director of Equifax after the merger, Equifax's commitment to assume the current employment agreements of TALX's executive officers, and the indemnification of TALX directors and officers by Equifax. In addition, these interests include severance benefits payable to TALX's executive officers if the officers' employment is terminated under certain conditions.\n\nEquifax Board Seat for William W. Canfield\n\nThe merger agreement provides that following the effective time of the merger, Equifax's board of directors will appoint William W. Canfield to Equifax's board of directors, to serve until his successor has been duly elected and qualified or until his earlier death, resignation, or removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Equifax and applicable law.\n\nShareholder Agreement\n\nEquifax and William W. Canfield entered into a shareholder agreement on February 14, 2007. Pursuant to the shareholder agreement, Mr. Canfield has agreed to vote, or cause to be voted, his TALX shares (which currently constitute approximately 6.4% of the outstanding shares of TALX common stock, including shares underlying stock options exercisable within 60 days) in favor of approval of the merger agreement and each of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Additionally, Mr. Canfield generally agreed not to transfer any of his TALX shares or any interest therein to any person other than pursuant to the shareholder agreement or the merger agreement.\n\nMaterial United States Federal Income Tax Consequences (Page 58)\n\nNeither Equifax nor TALX will be required to complete the merger unless it receives a legal opinion to the effect that the merger will qualify as a \"reorganization\" for United States federal income tax purposes. Therefore, we expect the transaction generally to be tax-free to holders of TALX common stock for federal income tax purposes except to the extent that they receive cash, including the\n\n10\n\ncash consideration in the merger and any cash that they receive instead of fractional shares of Equifax common stock.\n\nThose holders receiving solely cash for their TALX common stock generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and their tax basis in their shares of TALX common stock. Those holders receiving both Equifax common stock and cash for their TALX common stock generally will recognize gain equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of cash received and (ii) the excess of the \"amount realized\" in the transaction (i.e., the fair market value of the Equifax common stock at the effective time of the merger plus the amount of cash received) over their tax basis in their TALX common stock. In certain circumstances, the gain or, in the case of recipients of cash only, the entire amount of cash received, could be taxable as ordinary income rather than as a capital gain.\n\nAccounting Treatment (Page 61)\n\nThe merger will be accounted for as an acquisition of TALX by Equifax under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nRegulatory Matters Related to the Merger (Page 61)\n\nHSR Act and Antitrust\n\nThe merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, which we refer to as the HSR Act, which prevents Equifax and TALX from completing the merger until they furnish required information and materials to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, which we refer to as the DOJ, and the Federal Trade Commission, which we refer to as the FTC, and the applicable waiting period is terminated or expires. On March 6, 2007, Equifax and TALX filed the requisite Pre-Merger Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC.\n\nOther Regulatory Matters\n\nThe merger may be subject to certain regulatory requirements of other municipal, state, and federal governmental agencies and authorities.\n\nDissenters' Rights of Appraisal (Page 62)\n\nUnder Missouri law, holders of TALX common stock have the right to dissent from the merger and to receive payment in cash of an amount equal to the fair value of their shares of TALX common stock in lieu of the merger consideration. To dissent, a TALX shareholder must follow certain procedures, including but not limited to delivering a written objection to TALX prior to or at the TALX special meeting, not voting in favor of the merger agreement, and delivering a written demand for payment of the fair value of such shareholder's shares after the merger is effected. A dissenter may receive either an agreed upon value of his or her shares of TALX common stock in cash or a judicially appraised value of his or her shares of TALX common stock in cash. If the dissenting shareholder fails to comply with the strict requirements of Missouri law, dissenters' rights will not be available. See \"The MergerDissenters' Rights of Appraisal\" beginning on page 62 for additional information regarding dissenters' rights.\n\nUnder the shareholder agreement, William W. Canfield agreed to waive, and not to exercise or assert, any dissenters' or similar rights under Section 351.455 of the MBCL or other applicable law in connection with the merger.\n\n11\n\nThe Merger Agreement (Page 69)\n\nThe merger agreement is described beginning on page 69. The merger agreement also is attached as Appendix A to this document. We urge you to read the merger agreement in its entirety because it contains important provisions governing the terms and conditions of the merger.\n\nAcquisition Proposals (Page 76)\n\nUnder the merger agreement, TALX:\n\nis not permitted to initiate, solicit, or knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a proposal or offer, which we refer to as an acquisition proposal, with respect to:\n\na merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business combination, or similar transaction involving TALX or any of its subsidiaries whose assets constitute more than 20% of TALX's consolidated assets; or\n\nthe acquisition of 20% or more of the equity securities of TALX or any of its subsidiaries whose assets constitute more than 20% of TALX's consolidated assets;\n\nis generally not permitted to engage in, continue, or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to any person in connection with or in response to, an acquisition proposal for TALX;\n\nis not permitted to modify, amend, terminate, waive, or release any standstill or similar agreement which is applicable to any acquisition proposal for TALX and to which TALX or any of its subsidiaries is a party; and\n\nis not permitted to take any action to render any takeover statute inapplicable to an acquisition proposal for TALX or exclude any person from the applicability of any takeover statute in connection with an acquisition proposal for TALX.\n\nHowever, before the merger agreement is approved by TALX shareholders, TALX may:\n\nprovide information requested by a person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal for TALX if TALX receives an executed confidentiality agreement from that person; or\n\nengage in discussions with any person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal for TALX;\n\nonly if, in each case, the TALX board of directors determines in good faith that the failure to take such action is inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law and the acquisition proposal either constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a superior proposal to the merger with Equifax.\n\nConditions to the Merger (Page 86)\n\nThe completion of the merger depends on a number of conditions being met, including:\n\napproval of the merger agreement by TALX shareholders;\n\nreceipt of required regulatory approvals, including expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act;\n\nmaking all notices, reports, and other filings required to be made prior to the effective time, and receiving all approvals and authorizations from, any governmental entity, other than those for which failure to make such notices, reports, or other filings, or to receive such approvals or\n\n12\n\nauthorizations would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to result in a material adverse effect on Equifax or TALX;\n\nthe absence of any legal prohibition on consummation of the merger;\n\nthe registration statement of which this document forms a part having become effective under the Securities Act and no stop order or proceedings seeking a stop order having been issued, initiated, or threatened by the SEC;\n\nEquifax will have received state securities and \"blue sky\" permits and approvals necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and\n\napproval of listing on the NYSE of the shares of Equifax common stock to be issued to TALX shareholders in the merger.\n\nEquifax's and Merger Sub's obligations to complete the merger also are separately subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:\n\naccuracy of the representations and warranties made by TALX in the merger agreement;\n\nperformance by TALX of its obligations under the merger agreement;\n\nreceipt of a tax opinion from Kilpatrick Stockton LLP that the merger qualifies as a \"reorganization\" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code;\n\nexcept with respect to the pending FTC investigation of TALX, the absence of pending or threatened legal action by any governmental entity seeking to restrain or prohibit Equifax's ownership of TALX or the operation of its business and TALX's business, or compel Equifax to dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion of the business or assets of TALX or Equifax, or that otherwise would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on Equifax or TALX;\n\nexcept with respect to the pending FTC investigation of TALX, no governmental entity shall have taken any action or imposed any condition, or enacted or enforced any law that would reasonably be likely to result in any of the effects described in the immediately preceding bullet point, other than the application of the waiting period provisions of the HSR Act to the merger;\n\nthere shall not have occurred any event, occurrence, discovery, or development after the date of the merger agreement that, individually or in the aggregate, has resulted, or would reasonably be likely to result, in a material adverse effect on TALX and that is in existence at the closing; and\n\nless than 10% of the total outstanding shares of TALX common stock dissent from the merger.\n\nTALX's obligations to complete the merger also are separately subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:\n\naccuracy of the representations and warranties made by Equifax in the merger agreement;\n\nperformance by Equifax and Merger Sub of their obligations under the merger agreement;\n\nreceipt of a tax opinion from Bryan Cave LLP that the merger qualifies as a \"reorganization\" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code;\n\nthe absence of pending or threatened legal action by any governmental entity seeking to restrain or prohibit Equifax's ownership or operation of all or any material portion of its business or assets which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on Equifax or compel Equifax to dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion of its business or assets, or that otherwise would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on Equifax or TALX;\n\n13\n\nno governmental entity shall have taken any action or imposed any condition or enacted or enforced any law that would reasonably be likely to result in any of the effects described in the preceding bullet point, other than the application of the waiting period provisions of the HSR Act to the merger; and\n\nthere shall not have occurred any event, occurrence, discovery, or development after the date of the merger agreement that, individually or in the aggregate, has resulted, or would reasonably be likely to result, in a material adverse effect on Equifax and that is in existence at the closing.\n\nTermination of the Merger Agreement (Page 88)\n\nThe merger agreement can be terminated in the following circumstances:\n\nby mutual written consent of Equifax and TALX;\n\nby either Equifax or TALX if:\n\nthe merger is not completed by December 31, 2007;\n\nthe shareholders of TALX do not approve the merger agreement;\n\nany order of a governmental entity permanently restricting, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the completion of the merger becomes final and non-appealable; or\n\nthere is a breach by the other party of its representations, warranties, or covenants that, if existing at closing, would give the party the right not to complete the transaction, and which breach is not cured (or is not capable of being cured) within 30 days of written notice of the breach;\n\nby Equifax if:\n\nTALX's board of directors changes its recommendation to TALX shareholders regarding the merger agreement before it is approved by TALX shareholders; or\n\nTALX willfully or intentionally breaches its obligations under the merger agreement regarding alternative acquisition proposals; or\n\nby TALX if, before the merger agreement is approved by TALX shareholders, the TALX board of directors approves an acquisition proposal superior to the merger with Equifax in accordance with the provisions of the merger agreement, authorizes TALX to enter into a binding written agreement with respect to such superior acquisition proposal, and pays a termination fee to Equifax.\n\nEffect of Termination (Page 89)\n\nIn general, if the merger agreement is terminated and the merger is abandoned, the merger agreement will be void and of no effect, and neither Equifax nor TALX will have any liability to the other under the merger agreement other than for damages resulting from willful or intentional breach of any covenant in the merger agreement or from an obligation to pay, if applicable, the fees and reimbursement in accordance with the merger agreement.\n\nTermination Fees and Expenses (Page 90)\n\nIf TALX terminates the merger agreement because its board of directors has approved an acquisition proposal superior to the merger with Equifax, and has authorized TALX to enter into a binding written agreement providing for such superior proposal, before or simultaneous with the termination of the merger agreement, TALX will be required to pay to Equifax a termination fee of $12 million.\n\n14\n\nIf Equifax terminates the merger agreement because TALX's board of directors has withheld, withdrawn, qualified, or modified in a manner adverse to Equifax its recommendation that the merger agreement be approved prior to approval by TALX shareholders, TALX will be required to pay to Equifax a termination fee of $12 million.\n\nAdditionally, TALX will be required to pay to Equifax a $12 million termination fee if the merger agreement is:\n\nterminated by Equifax because of a willful or intentional breach by TALX in any material respect of its obligations under the merger agreement relating to acquisition proposals; or\n\nterminated by either Equifax or TALX because of either the merger not having been consummated before the termination date or the failure of the TALX shareholders to approve the merger agreement at the TALX special meeting; and\n\nat or prior to any such termination, a bona fide acquisition proposal involving more than 50% of the outstanding shares of TALX common stock or assets of TALX representing more than 50% of the consolidated assets of TALX is made to TALX or any of its subsidiaries or is made directly to TALX's shareholders generally or any person publicly announces an intention to make a bona fide acquisition proposal with respect to TALX and such acquisition proposal is not withdrawn prior to the date of such termination and if on or within 12 months after the date of such termination, TALX consummates the acquisition proposal or enters into a definitive agreement with respect to the acquisition proposal.\n\nComparison of Shareholder Rights (Page 104)\n\nThe conversion of all or a portion of your shares of TALX common stock into the right to receive shares of Equifax common stock in the merger will result in differences between your rights as a TALX shareholder, which are governed by the MBCL and TALX's articles of incorporation and bylaws, and your rights as an Equifax shareholder, which are governed by the Georgia Business Corporation Code, which we refer to as the GBCC, and Equifax's articles of incorporation and bylaws.\n\n15\n\nSELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA OF EQUIFAX\n\nThe table below summarizes selected historical financial information for Equifax for each of its last five fiscal years.

The resulting restatement affected the fiscal years ended March 31, 1999 through 2003 and the first two quarters of fiscal year 2004. The restatement had practically no cumulative impact on TALX's financial results or financial condition. It had the effect of reducing revenues by $1.0 million for fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001 and increasing revenues by a similar amount in fiscal years 2002 and 2003. The impact on the fiscal years 2002 and 2003 was an increase in revenues of $0.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively. In addition to the revenue adjustments, the related commissions associated with the revenues were adjusted accordingly and the income tax provisions were amended to reflect the impact of these restatements. After adjustment for the 3-for-2 stock splits, the annual impact to diluted earnings per share was an increase of $0.01 for both fiscal years 2002 and 2003.\n\n(2)Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the incremental increase in common shares outstanding assuming the exercise of all employee stock options and warrants that would have had a dilutive effect on earnings per share and the dilutive effect of all restricted stock. The weighted-average number of shares is based on common stock outstanding for basic earnings per share and common stock outstanding, restricted stock outstanding, and common stock options and warrants for diluted earnings per share in periods when such common stock options and warrants are not antidilutive. On January 6, 2005, TALX declared a 3-for-2 stock split, which was effected in the form of a 50 percent stock dividend, payable February 17, 2005, to shareholders of record on January 20, 2005. On November 14, 2005, TALX declared a 3-for-2 stock split, which was effected in the form of a 50 percent stock dividend, payable January 17, 2006, to shareholders of record on December 19, 2005. Earnings per share and the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding have been retroactively adjusted for the 3-for-2 stock splits.\n\n(3)Effective April 1, 2006, TALX adopted SFAS 123R, which resulted in incremental stock-based compensation for the nine months ended December 31, 2006. For additional information about the impact of SFAS 123R, see TALX's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31, 2006, which is incorporated by reference in this document.\n\n18\n\nSELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA\n\nCONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL DATA\n\nFOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006\n\nThe following table sets forth selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data of Equifax and TALX as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. The pro forma amounts in the table below are based upon the historical financial statements of Equifax and TALX, adjusted to give effect to the merger. It has been assumed for purposes of the pro forma financial data provided below that the merger was completed on January 1, 2006 for income statement purposes, and on December 31, 2006 for balance sheet purposes. These pro forma amounts have been derived from (a) the audited consolidated financial statements of Equifax contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, which are incorporated by reference in this document, (b) the audited consolidated financial statements of TALX contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, which are incorporated by reference in this document, and (c) the unaudited consolidated financial statements of TALX contained in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q at and for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2006, which are incorporated by reference in this document.\n\nThis information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the merger had been completed as of the dates indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial position of the combined company.\n\nThe pro forma financial data in the table below does not include the realization of cost savings from operating efficiencies, revenue synergies, or restructuring costs resulting from the merger. You should read this information in conjunction with the separate historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of Equifax and TALX that are incorporated by reference in this document and the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 beginning on page 91.\n\n19\n\nUNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA\n\nFOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006\n\nThe following table summarizes unaudited per share information for Equifax and TALX on a historical basis, a pro forma combined basis for Equifax, giving effect to the pro forma effects of the merger, and an equivalent pro forma combined basis for TALX. It has been assumed for purposes of the pro forma financial information provided below that the merger was completed on January 1, 2006 for income statement purposes, and on December 31, 2006 for balance sheet purposes.\n\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of Equifax and TALX as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and March 31, 2006, respectively, which are incorporated by reference into this document, the unaudited consolidated financial statements of TALX at and for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2006, which are incorporated by reference into this document, and the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 beginning on page 91. The pro forma information below is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the merger had been completed as of the beginning of the periods presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial position of the combined company.\n\nThe historical book value per share is computed by dividing total shareholders' equity by the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the end of the period. The pro forma per share income from continuing operations of the combined company is computed by dividing the pro forma income from continuing operations available to holders of the combined company's common stock by the pro forma weighted-average number of shares outstanding over the period. The pro forma combined book value per share is computed by dividing total pro forma shareholders' equity by the pro forma number of shares of common stock outstanding at the end of the period. TALX equivalent pro forma combined per share amounts are calculated by multiplying the pro forma combined per share amounts by the percentage of the merger consideration to be paid in shares of Equifax common stock of 75% and by 0.861, the number of shares of Equifax common stock that would be exchanged for each share of TALX common stock in the merger. The TALX equivalent per share amounts do not include the benefits of the cash component of the merger consideration.\n\n(1)TALX equivalent per share amounts are calculated by multiplying pro forma per share amounts by the percentage of the merger consideration to be paid in shares of Equifax common stock and by the exchange ratio of 0.861.\n\n20\n\nCOMPARATIVE MARKET DATA\n\nEquifax common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol \"EFX.\" The common stock of TALX is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \"TALX.\" The following table presents trading information for Equifax and TALX common stock on February 14, 2007, the last trading day before the public announcement of the execution of the merger agreement, and March 15, 2007, the latest practicable trading day before the date of this document. You should read the information presented below in conjunction with \"Comparative Per Share Market Price Data and Dividend Information\" on page 22.\n\nFor illustrative purposes, the following table provides TALX equivalent per share information on each of the relevant dates. TALX equivalent per share amounts are calculated\n\nfor a mixed election by adding the product of 75% (representing the stock portion of the merger consideration) of the Equifax per share amounts by the exchange ratio of 0.861 and $8.88 (representing the cash price per share multiplied by 25% which is the cash portion of the merger consideration); and\n\nfor an all-stock election by multiplying the Equifax per share amounts by the exchange ratio of 0.861.\n\n21\n\nCOMPARATIVE PER SHARE MARKET PRICE DATA AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION\n\nThe table below sets forth, for the calendar quarters indicated, the high and low sales prices per share reported on the NYSE and NASDAQ Global Select Market, and dividends declared on Equifax and TALX common stock.\n\nEquifax Common Stock TALX Common Stock Calendar Year\n\nHigh Low Dividends High Low Dividends 2005 First Quarter $ 31.57 $ 26.97 $ 0.03 $ 16.34 $ 10.29 $ 0.03 Second Quarter $ 36.52 $ 29.63 $ 0.04 $ 21.84 $ 11.94 $ 0.03 Third Quarter $ 38.07 $ 32.60 $ 0.04 $ 27.57 $ 17.84 $ 0.03 Fourth Quarter $ 38.98 $ 33.50 $ 0.04 $ 32.53 $ 20.71 $ 0.03 2006 First Quarter $ 39.42 $ 36.20 $ 0.04 $ 36.76 $ 25.70 $ 0.04 Second Quarter $ 38.86 $ 33.59 $ 0.04 $ 29.15 $ 21.05 $ 0.04 Third Quarter $ 37.84 $ 30.15 $ 0.04 $ 26.93 $ 17.86 $ 0.05 Fourth Quarter $ 41.64 $ 35.30 $ 0.04 $ 27.87 $ 22.40 $ 0.05 2007 First Quarter (through March 15, 2007) $ 42.00 $ 35.91 $ 0.04 $ 36.94 $ 26.98 $ 0.05\n\nOn March 15, 2007, the latest practicable trading day prior to the date of this document, the last sale price per share of Equifax common stock reported on the NYSE was $36.95, and the last sale price per share of TALX common stock reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market was $32.75.\n\nWe urge you to obtain current market quotations before you make your decision regarding the merger. Because the exchange ratio will not be adjusted for changes in the market value of the stock of either company, the market value of the shares of Equifax common stock that holders of TALX common stock will receive in the merger, if consummated, may vary significantly from the market value of such shares on the date of the merger agreement, this document, or the special meeting of the shareholders of TALX.\n\n22\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nWe urge you to consider carefully all of the information we have included and incorporated by reference in this document before you vote. See \"Where You Can Find More Information\" beginning on page 125. You should also read and consider the risks associated with each of the businesses of Equifax and TALX because these risks will affect the resulting company. These risks can be found in the Equifax and TALX Annual Reports on Form 10-K for fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and March 31, 2006, respectively, and in subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, which are filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference into this document. In addition, we urge you to consider carefully the following material risks relating to the merger and the business of the resulting company.\n\nEquifax may fail to realize the anticipated revenue and earnings growth and other benefits expected from the merger, which could adversely affect the value of shares of Equifax common stock after the merger.\n\nThe merger involves the integration of two companies that previously operated independently. The integration of two previously independent companies is a challenging, time-consuming, and costly process.\n\nThe value of shares of Equifax common stock following completion of the merger may be affected by the ability of Equifax to achieve the benefits expected to result from the merger. Achieving the benefits of the merger will depend in part upon meeting the challenges inherent in the successful combination of two business enterprises of the size and scope of Equifax and TALX, and the possible resulting diversion of management attention for an extended period of time. It is possible that the process of combining the companies could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that adversely affect the ability of the companies to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, and employees, or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. In addition, the successful combination of the companies will require the dedication of significant management resources, which could temporarily detract attention from the day-to-day business of the combined company.\n\nThere can be no assurance that these challenges will be met and that the diversion of management attention will not negatively impact the operations of the combined company following the merger. Delays encountered in the transition process could have a material adverse effect on the revenues, expenses, operating results, and financial condition of the combined company following the merger. Although Equifax and TALX expect significant benefits, such as revenue and earnings growth, to result from the merger, there can be no assurance that the combined company will actually realize any of these anticipated benefits. See \"The MergerEquifax's Reasons for the Merger\" beginning on page 36.\n\nBecause the market price of Equifax common stock will fluctuate, TALX shareholders cannot be sure of the market value of the Equifax common stock that they will receive in the merger.\n\nUpon completion of the merger, 75% of the outstanding shares of TALX common stock will be converted into shares of Equifax common stock. The ratio at which those shares will be converted is fixed and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either Equifax common stock or TALX common stock. The merger agreement does not provide for any price-based termination right. Accordingly, the market value of the Equifax common stock that TALX shareholders will be entitled to receive upon completion of the merger will depend on the market value of Equifax common stock at the time of the completion of the merger and could vary significantly from the market value on the date of this document or the date of the TALX special meeting. The market value of the Equifax common stock that TALX shareholders will be entitled to receive in the merger also will continue to fluctuate after the completion of the merger. For example, during the third and fourth calendar quarters of 2006, the sale price of Equifax common stock has ranged from a low of $30.15 to a high of $41.64, and during the first calendar quarter of 2007, the sale price of Equifax common stock ranged\n\n23\n\nfrom a low of $35.91 to a high of $42.00, all as reported on the NYSE. See \"Comparative Per Share Market Price Data and Dividend Information\" beginning on page 22.\n\nSuch variations could be the result of changes in the business, operations, or prospects of TALX or Equifax before the merger, or the combined company following the merger, market assessments of the likelihood that the merger will be completed or the timing of the completion of the merger, regulatory considerations, general market and economic conditions, and other factors both within and beyond the control of Equifax and TALX. Because the date that the merger is completed will be later than the date of the TALX special meeting, at the time of the special meeting TALX shareholders will not know with certainty the value of the shares of Equifax common stock that they will receive upon completion of the merger.\n\nThe pendency of the merger could materially adversely affect the future business and operations of Equifax and TALX.\n\nIn connection with the pending merger, some customers and strategic partners of Equifax or TALX may delay or defer decisions, which could negatively impact revenues, earnings, and cash flows of Equifax and TALX, as well as the market prices of Equifax common stock and TALX common stock, regardless of whether the merger is completed. Similarly, current and prospective employees of Equifax and TALX may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the merger, which may materially adversely affect the ability of Equifax and TALX to attract and retain key management, sales, marketing, technical, and other personnel.\n\nA delay in effecting Equifax's planned stock repurchases could adversely affect its financial results.\n\nIn connection with the authorization of the merger, Equifax's board of directors authorized an additional $400 million in stock repurchases, bringing its total repurchase authorization to $783 million as of February 14, 2007. Equifax expects to expend approximately $700 million of this authorization with the goal of acquiring within approximately six months following the merger a significant portion of the shares to be issued in the merger. Subject to market conditions and applicable securities laws, these repurchases would be effected through structured repurchase and open-market transactions. The merger is expected to be dilutive to Equifax's earnings per share, determined according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, for 2007 and 2008. If Equifax is unable to repurchase the planned number of shares within its anticipated price range and time frame, Equifax's earnings per share will be adversely affected and dilution will be greater than expected.\n\nIn connection with the merger, Equifax has authorized the use of a substantial portion of its borrowing capacity to repurchase its shares following the merger.\n\nIn February 2007, Equifax's board of directors approved, contingent upon the merger, an increase in its authorized stock repurchases to $783 million. Equifax expects to use approximately $700 million of this authorized repurchase within approximately six months following the merger and intends to finance the stock repurchases through issuance of additional fixed and/or variable rate debt. The incurrence of debt for repurchases may or may not be on terms favorable to Equifax, potentially in terms of covenants which may be required in debt borrowings, but particularly in regards to the potential for market interest rates to change between now and the time such debt is issued, which would have an impact on the combined company's future expenses and cash flows. In addition, the incurrence of variable interest rate debt may introduce additional variability to the combined company's expected future cash flows over time as a result of future interest rate changes.\n\n24\n\nIn connection with the merger, Equifax will incur additional indebtedness which may limit its ability to complete other transactions.\n\nEquifax expects to incur additional long-term debt to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration and to finance stock repurchases. The use of funds for this purpose could limit Equifax's flexibility to complete acquisitions of businesses or other transactions or make investments in other aspects of its operations that might be in its best interests.\n\nDirectors and executive officers of TALX may have potential conflicts of interest in recommending that you vote in favor of the merger agreement.\n\nSome of the directors and executive officers of TALX have interests in the merger that may be different from, or are in addition to, the interests of TALX shareholders generally. These interests relate to the treatment of equity-based compensation awards held by directors and executive officers of TALX in the merger, the appointment of the Chairman of the Board of TALX as a director of Equifax after the merger, Equifax's commitment to assume the current employment agreements of TALX's executive officers, the indemnification of TALX directors and officers by Equifax, and the payment of severance benefits to certain executive officers of TALX under certain circumstances. You should consider these interests in connection with your vote on the merger, including whether these interests may have influenced these directors and executive officers to recommend or support the merger. See \"The MergerInterests of TALX's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\" beginning on page 52.\n\nTALX shareholders may receive a form or combination of consideration different from what they elect.\n\nWhile each TALX shareholder may elect to receive all cash, all Equifax common stock, or a combination of cash and Equifax common stock in the merger, the pools of cash and Equifax common stock available for all TALX shareholders will be fixed amounts. Accordingly, depending on the elections made by other TALX shareholders, if you elect to receive all cash in the merger, you may receive a portion of your consideration in Equifax common stock and if you elect to receive all Equifax common stock in the merger, you may receive a portion of your consideration in cash. If you elect to receive a combination of cash and Equifax common stock in the merger, you may receive cash and Equifax common stock in a proportion different from what you elected. If you do not submit a properly completed and signed election form to the exchange agent by the election deadline, then you will have no control over the type of merger consideration you may receive, and, consequently, may receive only cash, only Equifax common stock, or a combination of cash and Equifax common stock in the merger.\n\nThe merger agreement restricts TALX's ability to pursue alternatives to the merger.\n\nThe merger agreement contains \"no shop\" provisions that, subject to limited fiduciary exceptions, restrict TALX's ability to directly or indirectly initiate, solicit, encourage, facilitate, discuss, or commit to competing third-party proposals to acquire all or a significant portion of TALX. Further, there are only limited exceptions to TALX's agreement that the TALX board of directors will not withdraw, modify, or qualify in any manner adverse to Equifax its approval of the merger agreement or its recommendation to holders of TALX common stock that they vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement, or recommend any other acquisition proposal. Although the TALX board of directors is permitted to take these actions if it determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law in connection with a superior proposal, doing so in specified situations could entitle Equifax to terminate the merger agreement and to be paid by TALX a termination fee of $12 million in cash.\n\n25\n\nEquifax required that TALX agree to these provisions as a condition to Equifax's willingness to enter into the merger agreement. However, these provisions could discourage a potential competing acquiror that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of TALX from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the consideration Equifax proposes to pay in the merger, or might result in a potential competing acquiror proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire TALX than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added cost of the termination fee that may become payable to Equifax in certain circumstances.\n\nThe market price of the shares of Equifax common stock and the results of operations of Equifax after the merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting TALX or Equifax currently.\n\nThe businesses of Equifax and TALX differ in some respects and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of the combined company's shares of common stock may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations and market prices of each of Equifax or TALX. For a discussion of the businesses of Equifax and TALX and certain factors to consider in connection with those businesses, see the documents incorporated by reference in this document and referred to under \"Where You Can Find More Information\" beginning on page 125.\n\nAny delay in completing the merger may reduce or eliminate the benefits expected.\n\nIn addition to the required regulatory clearances and approvals, the merger is subject to a number of other conditions beyond the control of Equifax and TALX that may prevent, delay, or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion. We cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied. Further, the requirements for obtaining the required clearances and approvals could delay the completion of the merger for a period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in completing the merger could cause Equifax not to realize some of the benefits that Equifax expects to achieve following the merger if it successfully completes the merger within its expected timeframe and integrates TALX's business with its other businesses.\n\nThe rights of TALX shareholders will change when they become shareholders of Equifax upon completion of the merger.\n\nUpon completion of the merger, TALX shareholders who receive Equifax shares in the merger will become Equifax shareholders. There are numerous differences between the rights of a shareholder of TALX, a Missouri corporation, and the rights of a shareholder of Equifax, a Georgia corporation. For a detailed discussion of these differences, see \"Comparison of Shareholder Rights\" beginning on page 104.\n\nThe costs and expenses incurred in connection with the integration of Equifax's and TALX's businesses may affect the combined company's operating results.\n\nThe combined company will incur certain costs and expenses in connection with the integration of Equifax's and TALX's businesses. These costs and expenses may have a negative effect on the combined company's results of operations.\n\n26\n\nTHE COMPANIES\n\nTALX\n\nTALX is a Missouri corporation incorporated in 1971. Its common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. TALX is a leading provider of payroll-related and human resources business process outsourcing services.
