Gone are the days when managing records seemed to affect only a small group of individuals within corporations, institutions and government organizations. Due to legal and regulatory compliance as well as litigation consequences, effective records management has become the responsibility of all employees, and in particular, of corporate executives such as the CEO and CFO.\n\nFrom process improvements to cost avoidance, technology plays a critical role in a formal records management program. If records are managed in disparate repositories — each with separate retention rules, security models, search/retrieval capabilities and organizational structures — finding the right information can quickly become an arduous task. And in civil litigation and government investigations, time is an important issue during pre-trial discovery since a lengthy discovery process — resulting in wasted employee time and skyrocketing legal fees — can greatly impact the bottom line. Moreover, as a result of inefficient processes or an inability to prove the integrity of business records, organizations may settle lawsuits based on estimated costs to comply with discovery requests instead of on the merits of the case. While compliance affects the operation of an organization's business, non-compliance can be even more costly due to fines, sanctions, forced case settlements or even imprisonment of company officers.\n\nStellent® Records Management helps organizations control the creation, declaration, classification, retention and destruction of business records. The Stellent solution manages records, along with documents, digital assets, e-mails, e-mail attachments, collaboration and Web content, within one server via a common user interface — making it easier to use and helping achieve a lower total cost of ownership. Stellent Records Management permits organizations to quickly and cost effectively meet corporate compliance requirements, reduce the cost of legal discovery and limit legal liability.\n\nClick Here To Download:\n\nProduct Brochure: Records Management"
