        "text": "WALTHAM, Mass., Jan. 27 /PRNewswire/ --Metalogix Software, a leading provider of SharePoint migration, management, archiving, and recovery solutions as well as email archiving solutions for Microsoft ExchangeÂ®, today announced Metalogix Migration Manager for Oracle Content Server (Stellent). Simplifying the migration of Stellent content to Microsoft SharePoint, the new Migration Manager for Oracle Content Server (Stellent) offers flexible migration and consolidation features through a familiar \"tree-to-tree\" interface.\n\nThe Metalogix Migration Manager for Oracle Content Server (Stellent) is another component of Metalogix's comprehensive strategy for migrating more Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems than any other vendor into SharePoint 2003, 2007 or 2010. Metalogix also simplifies migrating content from EMC Documentum eRoom to SharePoint, and Microsoft Content Management Server (MCMS) 2002 to SharePoint.\n\nWhile organizations continue to rely on ECM systems for formal documents, SharePoint is ideal for less formal communications and document sharing throughout the enterprise. Migrating informal ECM documents to SharePoint can increase collaboration and sharing while freeing up space on ECM servers, thus decreasing the need for additional ECM licenses.\n\n\"SharePoint is becoming the content management solution of choice for many companies hit with ECM maintenance costs that are substantially higher than before Stellent was purchased by Oracle,\" said Chris Risley, CEO, Metalogix. \"ECM sticker shock makes migrating content into SharePoint a priority but overworked IT organizations may not understand where to start or may think the process is too complicated. Metalogix makes this migration process both cost effective and easy so organizations can quickly consolidate their valued business content without losing the integrity of its structure, metadata or user-edit information.\"\n\nMetalogix Migration Manager for Oracle Content Server (Stellent) allows users to move existing Stellent content all at once or reorganize it during the migration process. The tool preserves both content and metadata and features a tree-based user interface with copy-and-paste functions similar to the familiar Windows File Explorer.\n\nThe Metalogix solution migrates all types of Stellent content including discussions, revisions, Stellent users, metadata, customizations and Stellent roles. It also preserves version histories and user permissions while enabling the migration administrator to connect to multiple Stellent and SharePoint sites across any number of servers for easy consolidation and distribution. Migration activities can be performed remotely from any client machine and migration operations may also be batched to run at any time. Migration is performed through the supported SharePoint and Stellent APIs to assure compliance and data integrity.\n\nMetalogix is the innovation leader in SharePoint migration solutions, which empower organizations to securely and automatically migrate more ECM systems than any other vendor into SharePoint 2003, 2007 or 2010. More than 2500 customers have migrated to SharePoint using Metalogix products.\n\nFor more information or to download a free trial, please visit: http://www.metalogix.net/Products/Migration-Manager-for-Oracle-And-Stellent/Free-Trial/\n\nAbout Metalogix Software\n\nMetalogix Software delivers award-winning content migration and archiving software that enables organizations to migrate, manage, archive and recover enterprise content to ensure availability, regulatory compliance, efficiency, and cost effectiveness.
