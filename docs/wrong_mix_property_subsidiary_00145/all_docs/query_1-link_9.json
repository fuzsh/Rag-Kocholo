It said Stellent’s Universal Content Management would be integrated with its own Content Database to expand its content management offerings.\n\nThe transaction is subject to customary conditions and is expected to close at the end of this calendar year or early 2007, Oracle said.\n\nStellent also announced second-quarter 2007 revenues of $33.7 million, with profits of $1.3 million.\n\n-Steven Schwankert, IDG News Service (Beijing Bureau)"
