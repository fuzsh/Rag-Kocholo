        "text": "What led you to data science?\n\n“My interest has been in applying data science skills to different problems that primarily fall in a scientific domain. I wanted to take data and apply it to scientific applications. Before CIBO, I was pursuing a Masters at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and as part of my research, I worked with a team of biologists at Cornell to help them study how birds migrate across the US using weather radar data. We were trying to identify the roosting locations of tree swallows to understand their migration patterns throughout the year. The goal was to build tools that allow us to monitor bird populations and how various environmental factors might impact them.”\n\n“I also like learning about astronomy and have done project work with data obtained from modern telescopes to help identify astronomical objects such as stars, galaxies, and supernovae. Astronomical datasets are often terabytes in size and you need machine learning-based tools to process these datasets and generate meaningful results. I also volunteer with a research lab in astronomy where we use machine learning to study gravitational lensing from telescope images. This in turns helps improve my data science and computer vision skills.”\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being a data scientist?\n\n“I transitioned into this field less than a year ago. I initially joined CIBO as a software engineer, then transitioned into a data scientist. I’m new to the field, so the process itself is exciting – coming up with a question to answer, looking at how we can use the data to test our hypothesis, performing analysis to get results, and finally creating visualizations to communicate those results.”\n\n“For example, here in the remote sensing team, we are working to improve our reliability maps. When we make some improvements to our model we try and generate visualizations, such as a map of reliability scores for multiple states in the US. We use these maps to explain the high-level insights. For instance, the presence of a water body, such as a river nearby may improve the reliability of that land and result in a higher score. The visualizations make it easier for people to understand these ideas that may otherwise be difficult to communicate.”\n\nWhat is one thing that would surprise people about your field of work in data?\n\n“As someone without a background in agriculture, I’m surprised how data-intensive the field is. I was amazed to find that combines are equipped with sensors to track its location on the field as well as to measure the rate at which grains are falling into the combine. Family farm groups that hire expert agronomists, whom I call farmer data scientists, to work with the data, clean it and process it. So clearly farming is a lot more complicated than planting and harvesting, which is what my naive self thought.”\n\nWhat kinds of things do you think we should be doing to encourage more people to pursue a career in science?\n\n“I think it would definitely help to spend more effort on public outreach and education about the importance of science in our daily lives. I believe there’s never been a better time to be a scientist than now. We are connected as a species like never before, thanks to the internet. We have the resources to solve important problems in the world, thanks to technology. We just need to be creative in our minds and be motivated to produce scientific solutions to those problems. This is not always easy because of the excess of bad/negative things shown in today’s media. We as individuals need to realize that there are a lot of good things happening, especially in science. We are making new breakthroughs, inventing new cures for diseases, designing new technologies that can fundamentally change our lives. Encouraging people to adopt a positive mindset towards science would be a good way to have them like the field and want to get involved.”\n\nHow are you involved in the local science community?\n\n“I am one of the organizers of a local data science meetup group, very creatively named the Boston Data Science meetup. Once a month, I lead a book club meeting, where we pick a book on machine learning that we are interested in reading, go through it and discuss our thoughts about it. The book club is reasonably popular, at one point, we had over 40 people joining us. It helps to build a community of people from different industries and network around data science topics.”\n\nWhat brought you to CIBO?\n\n“I came to CIBO because I was interested in applying data to scientific applications. The focus of the company in agriculture aligned well with my career aspirations. I also came because I had just graduated and was looking for a job, but I stayed because the work environment was conducive to research and growth and it aligned with my personal goals of working in a scientific field.”\n\nWhat are your primary responsibilities at CIBO?\n\n“I’m a Data Scientist on the Remote Sensing team. I work on improving our remote-sensing products. I’ve chiefly worked on stability/reliability maps and expanding their reach to include crops like cotton and wheat. I’ve also worked on tools that allow us to generate these maps and scores at scale across the US. Other than that I’m also involved in the Data Science Journal club, where we look at how we apply the latest research in Data Science, Machine Learning and Computer Vision to build tools that will help CIBO in the long term.”\n\nWhat do you find the most rewarding about your work here?\n\n“The freedom to pursue independent research – bring your own ideas on how you can improve the product and get a chance to explore them for a reasonable length of time. CIBO also provides the opportunity for personal development and shape your career the way you want it. I am from an Engineering background, transitioning into Data Science. I really wanted to improve my stats skills since it was important for my current job and future career. CIBO has allowed me to dedicate time to pursue online courses and even sponsored course subscriptions wherever needed.”\n\nAbout Pankaj Bhambhani\n\nPankaj Bhambhani is a Data Scientist at CIBO, a science-driven software startup. He holds a B.Tech in Information and Communication Technology from Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology and a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n\nWhat brought you to CIBO?\n\n“I find the application of computer vision to satellite imagery and remote sensing at CIBO exciting. In particular, using computer vision and machine learning techniques to understand crop fields is extremely interesting. Additionally, CIBO was looking to use wide range of different approaches to solving these kinds of problems, from Bayesian statistical models to deep learning, which lined up perfectly with my Ph.D. and academic research experience.”\n\nWhat inspired you to pursue a career in data?\n\n“My academic training is in traditional computer vision. When I first started my work in this field 15 years ago, it was a relatively new area with a huge number of problems yet to be solved. Although we have made incredible progress since then, there are still many challenging computer vision problems that need solutions that can be applied in the real world. In particular, computer vision applied to remote sensing is very new and we have only scratched the surface of what can be accomplished.”\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being a computer scientist?\n\n“The best part of being a computer scientist in computer vision is working on incredibly challenging problems that have the potential to impact the future in a very real way. In particular, working at CIBO has given me the opportunity to tackle these problems in a highly collaborative, multidisciplinary environment, which makes this type of work even more enjoyable.”\n\nWhat is one thing that would surprise people about your part of computer science?\n\n“The fact that computer vision, as a scientific problem, is incredibly difficult. I think it is hard to grasp this because human vision is extremely “easy” for us; we make sense of the world through what we see without seemingly any effort. However, the underlying processes controlling vision are extremely complex and took millions of years of evolution to get right. “Solving” computer vision would mean essentially replicating this ability in computers — a very challenging task!”\n\nWhat are your primary responsibilities at CIBO?\n\n“My main role is to design and develop algorithms for understanding remotely sensed imagery, e.g., what can we say about a crop field given some satellite images of it. Part of my responsibility is also to understand the impact of solving each problem on business outcomes for CIBO, as well as on the work of other scientists here, with the ultimate goal of moving the remote sensing work in a direction that is beneficial to the company.”\n\nWhat do you find the most rewarding about your work here?\n\n“The problems we solve at CIBO are extremely challenging and exciting, with lots of potential societal impact. Also, the people here are extremely talented and so much fun to work with.”\n\nPublished articles\n\nFor further articles by Ernesto Brau, visit his Google Scholar Page: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e8qul0UAAAAJ&hl=en\n\nAbout Ernesto Brau\n\nErnesto Brau is the Lead Computer Vision Scientist at CIBO, a science-driven software startup. Prior to CIBO, he worked on computer vision for AiBee Inc., Intel Corporation, and Hewlett-Packard Laboratories. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the Universidad de Sonora in Mexico, along with an MS and PhD in Computer Science from the University of Arizona.\n\nWhat led you to software development?\n\nLike a lot of people my age, I had the dream of creating video games, so I chose the Computer Science path. In addition to that, I knew that programmers were in high demand, and finding work wouldn’t be that difficult. I had an internship my senior year of school developing test automation scripts and noticed that I was pretty good at it, and I enjoyed it.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being in software development?\n\nI get to create and be creative for my job. Exercising the will to create something that didn’t exist before, refining it, making it better, and contributing to a larger project is what I want to be doing.\n\nWhat is one thing that would surprise people about software development?\n\nProbably that we aren’t sitting in front of a bunch of 1’s and 0’s all day and that we all have to look up information to help us finish whatever project we are working on.\n\nWhat kinds of things do you think we should be doing to encourage more people to pursue a career in software development?\n\nWe certainly need more women in software development. I’m not exactly sure how to do that, but I would say that I know a lot of people that don’t write software think it’s magic and are very intimidated by the idea of being a programmer. It would help to kill any stigma out there that it’s just for men and to kill the idea that it’s only for the smartest students.\n\nWhat brought you to CIBO?\n\nI have some connections here from previous employment engagements. That was the initiation connection. Then I learned that I could be part of a project that brings more light to the effects our farming strategies have on our environment. I’ve always been very interested in being a positive change for the environment, and working at a company trying to do so was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up.\n\nWhat are your primary responsibilities at CIBO?\n\nBuilding structures in our software development process that prevent bugs from leaking to our customers. If/when bugs do make it to production, strategizing so that the bug never shows up again. Primarily test automation development related work that we leverage to simulate how our users will interact with our software.\n\nWhat do you find the most rewarding about your work here?\n\nBeing part of a company that is actively working to reduce the amount of CO2e that is being put into the air.\n\nAbout Tim Brown\n\nTim Brown is the SDET Manager at CIBO, a science-driven software startup. Prior to CIBO, he worked at Field Nation, RedBrick Health, and MakeMusic. He holds a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Philosophy from Bethel University.\n\nWhat led you to astronomy and how does it tie into your job at CIBO?\n\n“In high school, I took a telescope out to my backyard and was hooked by looking at the stars. It seemed amazing to me that people were actually paid to stargaze. I decided I wanted to be one of those people!”\n\n“My work in astronomy was always more observational in nature rather than theoretical. I would go to a telescope, observe an astronomical object, analyze the resulting data and publish my findings. What I enjoyed most was talking to other researchers about how my conclusions fit in (or did not fit in!) with their findings. I also enjoyed writing code to clean and analyze data. I engage in very similar activities at CIBO, spending the majority of my time cleaning and analyzing data, as well as sharing my conclusions with others on the team.”\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being a data scientist?\n\n“The initial discovery phase is my favorite because you don’t know exactly what you’re going to find. It usually occurs after you have done the cleanup work that’s critical but not always the most exciting. This is where your key contribution will be — to figure out what’s important in the data. You find key insights that weren’t known before and you get to share them with others. What could be better than that!”\n\nWhat is one thing that would surprise people about data science?\n\n“The sheer amount of that effort must be expended on pre-processing and data cleaning. It almost always ends up being a majority of the time and effort when you tackle a new data science project.”\n\nWhat brought you to CIBO?\n\n“I was drawn to CIBO because I wanted to have a positive impact with my work. CIBO has a strong focus on changing the way we understand agriculture in a way that will be beneficial across many sectors of the agricultural economy. In addition, from a technical perspective, it was also appealing to me to learn Scala and to be expected to use Bayesian analysis techniques in my work.”\n\nWhat are your primary responsibilities at CIBO?\n\n“Right now, my task is to get our cotton model working smoothly across the country. I’m leading a small team and making sure that the work we are doing is aligned with the goals and needs of CIBO’s core product offering. I also make individual contributions to the team, primarily handling our data ingestion and model validation tasks.”\n\n“In the past, I’ve worked on the remote sensing team and helped to make contributions to our proprietary CIBO reliability score.”\n\nWhat do you find the most rewarding about your work here?\n\n“It’s a combination of being intellectually stimulated and having a positive impact on the environment. Especially with the sustainability emphasis, I believe that we’re tackling challenging but tractable problems. My work has a positive impact on the world!”\n\nAbout Shane Bussmann\n\nShane Bussmann is a Senior Data Scientist at CIBO, a science-driven software startup. Prior to CIBO, he worked as the Lead Data Scientist for Understory, Inc. He holds a B.A. in Physics and Astrophysics, along with a Ph.D. in Astronomy from the University of Arizona.\n\nWhat led you to pursue a career in data science?\n\n“Early on in my career as a software developer, I got engaged in data analytics and found the experience rewarding. There is an unexpected joy when working with data, the possibility of finding answers to interesting questions and hypotheses which is very fulfilling.\n\nDriven by this interest, I went on to complete my Master’s in data science at Indiana University, Bloomington. Post-graduation, I accepted a full-time job offer at CIBO as a Data Scientist.”\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being a data scientist?\n\n“The prospect of seeking and finding the truth. Statistics and data science have long driven scientific research leading to the discovery of new facts about the world. Being a data scientist gives me the privilege to contribute to the scientific advancements by leveraging data science skills and subject knowledge to model real-world systems and processes. These models can then be used to simulate different scenarios and help answer complex questions.”\n\nWhat is one thing that would surprise people about your work in data science?\n\n“Although data science has come into vogue lately and has received increasing attention, I think there is a less formal acknowledgment of its roots in rational and native human thought processes.”\n\n“The human mind is a great statistical machine. Our mind continuously and incrementally aggregates and summarizes observed inputs, as storable and retrievable knowledge blocks, that makes reasoning, and inferencing so seamless. Data science is analogous to the way our brains work and provides a formalized systematic framework to think about and apply. The Bayesian learning frameworks in Data science reflects these ideas very closely.”\n\nWhat kinds of things do you think we should be doing to encourage more people to pursue a career in science?\n\n“We should provide opportunities for high school and middle school students to engage with scientific research. This can help them appreciate the process of trial and error and balance all outcomes. Academic institutions and industry can further augment this effort.”\n\nWhat brought you to CiBO?\n\n“I graduated from Indiana University, Bloomington in 2017 earning a Masters degree in data science. CiBO appealed to me for its groundbreaking work combining science and Technology.”\n\n“Furthermore, I found the idea of applying technology in the agriculture sector enticing as farming is one of the oldest human professions yet most underserved by technology.”\n\nWhat are your primary responsibilities at CiBO?\n\n“As a Data Scientist in the modeling team at CIBO, over the past two+ years I’ve worked extensively on our core crop models in validating and improving them. This has been done in collaboration with our expert cross-sectional team of crop modelers and scientists. I have worked on using statistical techniques to identify sources of errors and help identify potential model improvements and development. I am also responsible for programming these models into production deployable workflows.”\n\n“More recently, I’ve been working on the Farmland valuation project that is chartered with goals to estimate the values of Farmland across the continental US. We employ state-of-the-art data science methods combined with our core simulation models to estimate farmland values.”\n\nWhat do you find the most rewarding about your work here?\n\n“The diversity of skills at CiBO amazes me and inspires me to do my best and continuously strive to up the bar. We have experts in a range of diverse domains such as software engineering, crop science, soil science, computer vision, and data science. The learning potential cutting across these different domains is immense and enriching. It is very gratifying to know that we are tackling some of the biggest challenges in human history, and contributing to solve problems in the agriculture domain and help our farmers grow more sustainably and also help improve their livelihood scenarios by increasing profitability and maximizing outcomes.”\n\n“I think CIBO is uniquely placed in terms of skills and capabilities needed to combine science and engineering at a large scale to develop a platform that can address some of the complex problems of our lifetimes.”\n\nAbout Subhash Bylaiah\n\nSubhash Bylaiah is a Senior Data Scientist at CIBO, a science-driven software startup. He holds a Bachelors of Engineering from the Malnad College of Engineering and a Master of Science in Data Science from Indiana University Bloomington.\n\nWhat led you to agriculture?\n\nI was originally trained as a hydrogeologist and paleoclimatologist, studying how water and carbon are stored in and cycled through the subsurface. From here, it was a natural transition to work in agriculture, where understanding the interactions among soils, water, crops, and the climate are critically important to the livelihood of the individual growers and to the sustainability of our agricultural system as a whole.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being a crop modeler?\n\nI love the scales involved. We can apply the same models to small areas within a grower’s field; or tens of thousands of fields across the U.S., depending on what we are interested in learning. This presents many challenges, both in terms of engineering and data management, but also in how best to interpret results at these scales. It makes for a really interesting problem to work on.\n\nWhat is one thing that would surprise people about your field of work in agriculture?\n\nMany growers are scientists in their own right. They run experiments, comparing new seed products, crop management practices, and digital tools in direct head-to-head comparisons in their own fields. It is a constantly evolving industry, and one where individual growers need concrete evidence that a new product will lead to a better outcome on their own farms.\n\nDo you have any papers or articles we can reference?\n\nCarlson P.E., Noronha A.L., Banner J.L., Jenson J.W., Moore M.W., Partin J.W., Deininger M., Breecker D.O., and Bautista K.K.

While I’ve given the requisite talks at scientific conferences, the talks I’m most proud of were the ones given to non-technical audiences. I was invited to speak on climate change risk in Texas at a teacher development workshop in Austin. I spoke about the increased risk of drought in central and west Texas, increased flood risk throughout the state, and increased hurricane severity along the Gulf Coast. Coincidentally, the day I gave this presentation was the same day Hurricane Harvey formed, a storm that would make landfall in Houston a week later, becoming the costliest natural disaster in Texas history.\n\nWhat brought you to CIBO?\n\nI worked in digital agriculture for a few years before CIBO and was looking to move to a company that focused primarily on sustainable and regenerative agriculture. When I read about the SALUS model that serves as the engine behind CIBO products, I was absolutely blown away. The combination of CIBO’s technical capabilities and commitment to a sustainable future meant CIBO was the place for me.\n\nWhat are your primary responsibilities at CIBO?\n\nI am a crop and soil modeler. I will help to develop new crop models and further develop our models of the interactions between plants and soils.\n\nPeter Carlson is a Crop Modeler at CIBO Technologies, a science-driven software startup. Prior to CIBO, he worked for The Climate Corporation as a data scientist and geospatial engineer. He holds a degree in geological and earth sciences/geosciences from Northwestern University along with a Ph.D. in geological and earth sciences/geosciences from the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nWhat led you to computer science?\n\n“In college, I studied mathematics and on graduating I naturally gravitated to computer science. Computer science, like math, has interesting problems that can be solved in a multitude of ways and finding the right way or better way to solve a problem can be an interesting challenge.”\n\n“Another aspect of computer science that I enjoy is the sense of creating something useful that others can use. In mathematics, usefulness is not a primary concern and it’s quite possible that you end up having solved a rather hard, esoteric problem that just ends up collecting dust somewhere.”\n\nWhy did you join CIBO and what do you enjoy about the role?\n\n“I joined CIBO because I found the work interesting. Being able to combine large data sets with a good, practical and intuitive UI is quite tricky. You need to be able to understand the statistics and then somehow make all that information not overwhelm the user and make it accessible. The question is can we accurately convey how the land is being used, why it was a success or failed to meet expectations. Will a farmer be able to see how his/her land compares to others and how s/he might improve it? There are a lot of questions to answer and our hope is that we can provide useful insights into agriculture.”\n\n“I work on the Marketplace (MP) back-end, which provides the front-end with the information that the data scientists have managed to collect and compute. At the moment, my main focus has been on providing functional tests and enhancing the self-documenting nature of the application.”\n\nAbout Eva Cordes\n\nEva Cordes is a Software Engineer at CIBO, a science-driven software startup. Prior to CIBO, she worked for RedBrick Health, Gyassa Software, and Oracle. She holds a Bachelors and Masters in Mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nWhat led you to your career?\n\nMost of my professional experience has been in account management or sales/customer service, but I have always leaned toward the operations side. If there is a better way to do something that will result in a better customer experience, I want to make that happen.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about focusing on operations or implementation?\n\nWhen something does not go as anticipated, it presents an opportunity for the organization to make improvements. I enjoy going back to that customer and demonstrating that we listened to them and made adjustments because we value their business – it is a great conversation to have and serves to strengthen the partnership.\n\nWhat kinds of things do you think we should be doing to encourage more people to pursue a career in science?\n\nFind something you’re passionate about! Even if you’re not a “science person,” there are so many ways you can contribute to the organization’s success.\n\nWhat brought you to CIBO?\n\nA number of former coworkers for whom I have so much admiration and respect landed at CIBO – when an opportunity for me to join the team arose, I was thrilled!\n\nWhat are your primary responsibilities at CIBO?\n\nMy work includes all the work to bring new clients on board – from collecting information from them to get them into the platform to training internal admins on how to maximize the benefits of using the platform, etc. Then I will also work with CIBO internal teams to explore enhancements to the platform based on client feedback and suggestions. Whatever is needed to ensure our clients have the best experience with the platform.\n\nWhat do you find the most rewarding about your work here?\n\nSo often, we feel powerless to have any meaningful impact on larger issues that are plaguing our world. The work at CIBO will help jumpstart real, sustainable change in our fundamental processes in our food chain and how we view the role that agriculture plays in our climate crisis. To be able to play even the smallest role in that is incredibly gratifying.\n\nAbout Marie Doll\n\nMarie Doll is the Implementation Manager at CIBO, a science-driven software startup. Prior to CIBO, she worked as an Account Manager at Parameters. She holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Sociology from University of North Dakota.\n\nWhat brought you to CIBO?\n\n“It was CIBO’s technology. CIBO’s crop modeling platform includes models whose development started at Michigan State University. The company is truly a knowledge hub, continuously building upon scientific research it conducts over time to address real-world problems. I knew CIBO’s platform was a powerful piece of science and engineering, and there is a wide range of applications that can be based on it. I joined CIBO because I believe there are lots of things I can offer to make this technology even better.”\n\nWhat is one thing that would surprise people about your field of work in agriculture/data?\n\n“One thing that surprises people is the number of advanced mathematical, statistical, and systems analysis methods that have been adapted to agricultural sciences. Agriculture has not been traditionally a maths-oriented field. However, methods developed in other disciplines (e.g., biology or engineering) have been adopted by a certain group of scientists to make agricultural decision-making more efficient. When most folks think of agriculture, they imagine soil science or crop science, but actually, there is much more to the field. Mathematical modeling, for example, is widely used in agricultural sciences to support decision making.”\n\nHow did you get into your line of work?\n\n“It was during my last year at the School of Agronomy in Togo, West Africa that I became interested in crop modeling. I attended a seminar on systems dynamics during which the speaker demonstrated a different perspective on analyzing crop growth using simulations—that was very different from what is usually done in traditional agronomy. The speaker explained how systems analysis methods developed in industrial engineering could be applied to agricultural systems to enhance the decision-making process. By considering crop growth, for example, as occurring in a system and placing the problem to solve at the center of the system, one can develop multi-disciplinary solutions using simulation models as tools. I was fascinated by this approach and decided to continue my studies in systems analysis and crop modeling.”\n\nWhat are your primary responsibilities at CIBO?\n\n“I contribute to the development of new crop models, along with testing and validation of existing crop models. My work involves expanding the capabilities of our crop models to include other data science techniques. I help make the crop model outputs more useful to our customers.”\n\nWhat is your most memorable moment at work?\n\n“My favorite times at work are when I get together with other colleagues from different backgrounds to work on projects. We dig deep into solutions and try to find the best and practical ones. I love deep scientific curiosity. Once you start digging into details, you can find things you don’t expect. I love doing that. It keeps the scientific curiosity alive. Working with people with different backgrounds gives you the opportunity to hear different points of view and try methods you may not have thought of on your own.”\n\n“You don’t always find this level of scientific curiosity and collegiality at other companies. CIBO encourages employees to deep dive into issues and find impactful solutions.”\n\nWhat do you find most rewarding about your work here?\n\n“I get to work on the most pressing issues in agriculture of our time and collaborate with very clever people from diverse backgrounds and points of view. It’s rewarding because sometimes you see problems or solutions only from your perspective. Someone who brings a different perspective to an issue can help you learn from their expertise—and broaden your views.”\n\nWhat kinds of things do you think we should be doing to encourage more people to pursue a career in science?\n\n“I think Universities should offer courses that prepare students for careers that aren’t necessarily academic. A significant proportion of students in the agricultural sciences may not want to stay in academia—they might be interested in a career in the private sector, for example. The jump from school with a degree in science to a non-academic environment is not trivial. Helping students bridge that gap very early on would go a long way.”\n\nWhat advice would you give to young people interested in a career in science?\n\n“It’s a common perception that science is very abstract and theoretical. Students might think that pursuing a career in science outside of academia is hard—but this is not necessarily true.”\n\n“I think it would be useful for young people interested in a career in science to do an internship with a company that they like. It’s important to read job descriptions to get a feel for the kind of positions available, the kind of skills companies are looking for, or even unresolved issues they might want to tackle through entrepreneurship—all these while still in school. They can then re-shape their academic programs to suit the current requirements of the job market better.”\n\nWhat are your hobbies and do they influence your work?\n\n“In my spare time, I enjoy going for runs and pretending like I’m preparing for marathons. I also love reading popular science books because they help me learn techniques to distill science into easy-to-understand and interesting stories.”\n\nWhat do you hope to see in your field in the next 10 years?\n\n“The digital ag sector is slowly emerging. While the ag sector is a bit resistant to new technologies, I hope to see a high adoption rate of these technologies in the near future. I want the agriculture sector to accelerate its transition to the digital age and catch up with other industries.”\n\nWhy are you excited about CIBO?\n\n“In terms of the digital ag sector that CIBO is part of, I believe one hundred percent in the company. I think CIBO has the best technologies, the best platform, and the right strategy. This combination really gets me excited!”\n\nAbout Kofi Dzotsi\n\nKofi Dzotsi is a the Lead and Principal Scientist of Crop Modeling at CIBO Technologies, a science-driven software startup. Prior to CIBO, he worked for The Climate Corporation as a crop simulation modeler and quantitative researcher. He holds a degree in agricultural engineering and agronomy from the University of Lomé along with an MS and Ph.D. in agricultural and biological engineering from the University of Florida.\n\nWhy did you decide to join CIBO?\n\n“CIBO’s position as a science-driven software company was immediately interesting to me. In my role before CIBO, I was working at the McDonnell Genome Institute, writing software to support scientists doing cutting-edge medical research. While I had no direct contact with patients, I still felt like I was helping the scientific community.”\n\n“Similarly, working closely with scientists here at CIBO provides an opportunity for me to contribute to agricultural science, including food security and environmental sustainability. I enjoy being in an environment where I’m helping to build something that has the potential to change the world.”\n\nHow did you get into your line of work?\n\n“When I was a kid, I would play around with LOGO, a programming language. That experience sparked my passion to focus on engineering in college. When I took my first computer science 101 class, I enjoyed the work and decided to continue in that direction. It was fascinating to go from drawing shapes with the LOGO turtle to designing complex software systems.”\n\nWhat is your most memorable moment at work?\n\n“My most interesting project at CIBO was a client project where we had been contracted to figure out how seeds were germinating. I wrote computer vision algorithms to process images of seeds growing in a controlled environment. Using computer vision, we were able to detect each seed, detect the moment of germination, and measure root growth over time. These measurements were sent to a frontend display where the client’s scientists could monitor their germination experiments.”\n\nHow can we encourage more women to pursue a career in science?\n\n“Having a network of good mentors is critical to pursuing a STEM career. For me, many people have been critical in shaping my career by being role models and by providing sound advice. Having the backing of someone who understands you is invaluable.”\n\n“My advice to those interested in a career in science is to follow the subject and projects that you enjoy most. That is how I ended up finding a career in engineering.”\n\nWhat are your hobbies outside of work?\n\n“I am in a band called Robbie and the Rockin’ Fools that plays old rock and roll music. We perform a couple of times a month at local bars. My passion for music began in elementary school when I started piano lessons. I continued to play in high school, and after college, I started hanging around people playing music and ended up in my first band. Now I play not just with my own band, I also back up other people who have a similar style to me.”\n\nWhy are you excited about CIBO?\n\n“I’m excited to be at CIBO because I’m always learning. I’ve recently transitioned roles from an individual contributor in engineering to a leadership position. It’s a new challenge, and I enjoy growing my skill set.”\n\nWhat are your primary responsibilities at CIBO?\n\n“When I joined CIBO, I started as an individual engineer working on different teams, including computer vision, engagement, and the model introspection team. Last January, I was asked to lead a small team developing a critical internal service. From there, my leadership role has expanded and I now lead a team supporting all of our internal services and data acquisition. It’s been an interesting journey transitioning from an individual engineer to a leadership role. It’s always exciting to see my team members put their own individual strengths to work. The most rewarding part of this job is seeing my team come together to do excellent work.”\n\nAbout Amy Hawkins\n\nAmy Hawkins is a Lead Software Engineer at CIBO, a science-driven software startup. Prior to CIBO, she worked for the McDonnell Genome Institute developing software programs to support large scale genome sequencing. She holds a Masters degree in Computer Science and B.S. in Computer Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nWhat led you to software engineering?\n\n“When I was in elementary school our school had a Radio Shack TRS-80 that came with a built in BASIC interpreter. I spent most of my free time figuring out how to write programs for it. Ever since then I’ve been fascinated with computers and writing software.”\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being a software engineer\n\n“One of my favorite things about being a software engineer is the flexibility to apply those skills to a lot of different domains. Over the course of my career, I’ve worked in a number of different industries. I’ve always been broadly curious so it is fun to be able to work on many different problems while still developing a specialized technical skill set.”\n\nWhat is one thing that would surprise people about software engineering?\n\n“One thing that surprises people who are not directly involved in software engineering is how much of it there is everywhere. For example, people are often surprised by how much software/technology there is in farming.”\n\nWhat brought you to CIBO?\n\n“The opportunity to work at a company that is basing its product on actual science in a fundamental way. Agriculture is interesting because it’s an important, productive part of the economy and there are opportunities to build something more meaningful than the next social media app. I also knew there were really smart teammates here who would be great to work with.”\n\nWhat are your primary responsibilities at CIBO?\n\n“I am leveraging my software engineering expertise to help the science and modeling team deliver data-driven insights at scale.”\n\nWhat do you find the most rewarding about your work here?\n\n“One of the most rewarding things has been working with experts from a variety of fields. I’m impressed and humbled by the depth of knowledge everyone brings to the team. Watching as we come together to generate new information and insights about farmland around the US is pretty amazing.”\n\nAbout Jeremy Keillor\n\nJeremy Keillor is the Director, Software Engineering at CIBO, a science-driven software startup. Prior to CIBO, he worked for Virgin Pulse, RedBrick Health, and Godengo. He holds a Bachelors degree in English Literature and Computer Science from Bethel University.\n\nWhat led you to software development?\n\n“I’ve always had an interest in math and science-related fields and also enjoy problem-solving. In college I found that computer science is a bit of a combination of these things, and I also found I really enjoy building software, which led me to the career of software development.”\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being a software developer?\n\n“I like seeing other people find value in the software and products I, as a software developer, get to be a part of creating.”\n\nWhat is one thing that would surprise people about your field of work in software development?\n\n“I’d say that it’s the effort and thought that goes into nearly every feature of a product under development. There are many standard features that go into almost every software product, such as accepting payments, but despite how common they are, it many times still takes a lot of work to provide a great customer experience. In the payments example, for instance, there are many paths a user can take through the payment process, and all those paths have to be thought through with well-behaved responses from the product at each step.”\n\nWhat kinds of things do you think we should be doing to encourage more people to pursue a career in computer science?\n\n“For me, it would be encouraging more exposure at earlier ages. I have two kids, and I’ve thought a bit about how to get them excited about computers and technology. There are a lot of toys now that emphasize coding and building with electronics, which can cultivate an interest in technology and could lead to a career in software development.”\n\nWhat brought you to CIBO?\n\n“I was looking for and have always been interested in joining a company with an emphasis on science and technology. When I heard about the opportunity at CIBO and what they were working on in agriculture, it piqued my interest.”\n\nWhat are your primary responsibilities at CIBO?\n\n“I work on the backend of our product. My work spans search infrastructure, APIs, authentication API, and general backend work.”\n\nWhat do you find the most rewarding about your work here?\n\n“For me, it’s the colleagues I work with every day. I also enjoy working on CIBO’s product, as I believe it will provide a lot of value to its users.”\n\nAbout Garrett Kolpin\n\nGarrett Kolpin is a Lead Software Engineer at CIBO, a science-driven software startup. Prior to CIBO, he worked for Virgin Pulse, RedBrick Health, and Thomson Reuters. He holds a Bachelors in Mathematics and Computer Science from Gustavus Adolphus College and a Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nWhat brought you to CIBO?\n\n“I was looking for a small company because I wanted to work at a faster pace. I really liked CIBO’s focus on sustainability. As a society, we have the data and knowledge to better manage our land. I wanted to work for a company that had a mission that resonated with me. CIBO fits into my skills really well with the combination of biology, agriculture, and data science.”\n\nWhat led you to data science?\n\n“Ecology led me to data science. I’ve always loved the natural world but didn’t know what jobs were in this space. As a girl who was interested in science and math, I was steered toward computer science. My parents were also computer scientists and because I was inclined towards technology, this was a good fit initially.”\n\n“While working in the computer world in Washington, DC, I became interested in environmental justice and land use. I learned about alternative business models for agriculture, including Community Supported Agriculture. Eventually, I left my computer job and went to work on an organic vegetable farm. But I missed research, so I found a way to combine my environmental interests with my background in computer science. I decided to pursue an advanced degree in ecology with a focus on the effects of human-caused change to the environment.”\n\n“Part of my Ph.D. focused on beef production in the US and the economics behind it. Other parts of my dissertation concentrated on plant ecology and biodiversity. My advisor’s background was in plant ecology, but he had recently become focused on sustainable food production and the question of how to feed 9 billion people in an environmentally sustainable way.”\n\n“It turned out that my background in computer science was useful because a lot of ecologists don’t have a background in computer science. I brought this combination of skills to CIBO because I was attracted to the mix of complex problems, agriculture and computer science within my role.”\n\nWhat are your primary responsibilities at CIBO?\n\n“I lead the sustainability team. My team’s job is to develop algorithms to estimate the environmental impact of farming on agricultural land throughout the country.”\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being a scientist?\n\n“I enjoy understanding and explaining some of the complexities of the biological world.”\n\nWhat is one thing that would surprise people about your field of work in agriculture/data?\n\n“The thing that surprised me the most was how much we don’t know about the natural world. We don’t know what all the functions of a cell are. We don’t know why zebras have stripes. We don’t know some very fundamental things that people assume scientists know. We’re better at understanding cars and computers and other built things than our own bodies and the environment we inhabit.”\n\nWhat kinds of things do you think we should be doing to encourage more people to pursue a career in science?\n\n“The most important thing is to teach kids that science is a process of exploration and not a set of facts. We have textbooks and tell kids to memorize the content. I didn’t take a biology course until I was in graduate school because to me biology meant memorizing things about cells and molecules and organic chemistry. I didn’t want to memorize things I could look up.”\n\n“Science is not a list of facts and things we know. It’s about asking questions and trying to figure out the answers. That is fun for kids. I think when kids learn science in a well-taught process-based framework, it hooks into their natural curiosity and engages them.”\n\n“I also find that people perceive a bigger gulf between scientists and nonscientists than is actually there. For several years, I built and managed citizen science projects that brought anyone who wanted to volunteer into the science fold by having them participate in real science projects with scientists. I highly recommend anyone interested in participating directly in science research visit the Zooniverse, which hosts many such projects and with which I collaborated.”\n\nWhat do you find the most rewarding about your work here?\n\n“I find it rewarding to have my work incorporated into the product, the application that is seen and used by other people. In academia, I worked on the impacts of global change, and especially climate change. That’s important work, but you don’t necessarily see the results. You can write a paper and send it out into the world but you don’t know who’s reading it and if it will impact policy. But here, I come up with an algorithm, write the code, and can see how it impacts the product.”\n\nPress Coverage:\n\nUndark – Taking the Pulse of the Planet\n\nWired – Drones Are Turning Civilians Into an Air Force of Citizen Scientists\n\nScience Daily – Use artificial intelligence to identify, count, describe wild animals\n\nVenture Beat – Researchers develop AI that identifies and counts wildlife with 96.6% accuracy\n\nWired – The Animals of the Serengeti Get Caught in Surprise Selfies\n\nHakai Magazine – Citizen Science Comes of Age\n\nBuzzfeed – 23 Animal Selfies For Everyday Situations\n\nSpeaking Events\n\n2016 – Brown University, Providence, RI.

Prior to CIBO, she was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University and a predoctoral fellow at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History. She holds a Ph.D. in Ecology from the University of Minnesota and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Brown University.\n\nWhat led you to software engineering?\n\nGrowing up, my father worked as a mainframe operator, and I was always amazed by his ability to work with massive IBM towers. I want to credit this as one of my primary motivators for becoming a programmer/software engineer. Furthermore, I have always been a huge nerd-coding in my spare time is one of my favorite things, and I am always trying to read a textbook of some sort at any given time.\n\nRegarding the shift to working on agriculture software, I was able to work under Dr. Danelle Larson at the USGS on some problems related to applying non-traditional data analysis techniques to ecological research. This was an incredible experience that later inspired me to join CIBO.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being a scientist?\n\nI’m not a scientist (in CIBO terminology, I don’t actively develop crop/climatology models); however, I’ve learned that I love surrounding myself with them! My role at CIBO involves implementing software based on the ideas and theories developed by our research staff. My favorite part of this is being able to work on some really “out there” problems while also trying to use engineering best practices.\n\nWhat is one thing that would surprise people about your field of work in agriculture/data?\n\nWe have a well-developed technology stack comparable to many other SaaS companies. The maturity of our software tooling surprised me when I first joined CIBO, considering that we operate with a modestly-sized group of engineers!\n\nWhat kinds of things do you think we should be doing to encourage more people to pursue a career in science?\n\nVocalize the impacts of an individual’s work in two contexts:\n\nFrom the professional/technical perspective : clever solutions, engineering choices, new models, etc.\n\nFrom the perspective of how their work affects the company/organization/world : For example : thanks to X feature, we improved model accuracy, which will affect Y number of credits issued in a given year. These credits incentivize (some number) of farmers to practice (insert sustainable practice)\n\nWhat brought you to CIBO?\n\nAn awesome mission statement, cool problems to work on, and a staff that genuinely believes in the problems that their product is trying to solve.\n\nWhat are your primary responsibilities at CIBO?\n\nI’m a software engineer working on building tooling for scientists and other engineers at CIBO; my day-to-day is focused around coding and providing advice/assistance on software-related problems.\n\nWhat do you find the most rewarding about your work here?\n\nI feel incredibly lucky to work with a team of engineers who are constantly working towards the best possible solutions to a given problem. The enthusiasm for discussion and collaboration with our research staff is also incredible.\n\nAbout Douglas Krouth\n\nDouglas Krouth is a Software Engineer at CIBO, a science-driven software startup. Prior to CIBO, he worked at Schneider and HORNE. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse.\n\nWhat led you to dev-ops engineering?\n\n“I gained a statistic background in college, learned to program, then went into computer science. I’ve always enjoyed plants and plant biology, so I ended up at CIBO. Since joining the team, I’ve transitioned into the infostructure team. Most of the work is problem-solving, which is fun to do.”\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being a scientist?\n\n“In Dev-ops, it’s the ability to keep a graph in my head that connects everything within our infrastructure. My end users in this role are the internal folks at CIBO to support and build the infostructure to go fast enough for their work.”\n\n“As a software engineer, my favorite thing is to create a useful application. You get to design it from the top down from designing, architecting, then building it out and dealing with the problems along the way.”\n\nWhat is one thing that would surprise people about your field of work?\n\n“You aren’t typing or coding as often as you think. You’re usually whiteboarding, brainstorming, or thinking about the problem you’re trying to solve.”\n\nWhat kinds of things do you think we should be doing to encourage more people to pursue a career in software engineering?\n\n“We should be more diverse, inclusive, and welcoming to everyone but also making it a safe space. People interested should not only participate but encouraged and welcomed to join. You can bring someone into the room, but if you don’t welcome that, then they won’t get the feeling of being a participant.”\n\nWhat brought you to CIBO?\n\n“The idea that the work would not be completely product or computer software engineering-led. It’s a significant collaboration between product and software. I was also happy to work with data scientists and scientists, as I’ve found those experiences helpful in the past.”\n\nWhat are your primary responsibilities at CIBO?\n\n“Managing the infostructure with Alec Kloss. We make sure its stable for everyone and improve it in ways that help people jobs get done better and fast along with fixing anything that goes wrong.”\n\nWhat do you find the most rewarding about your work here?\n\n“I like infostructure because you get to figure out how to make disparate systems work together that may not have been meant to be together. Ordering matters, it’s all in your head, and it’s hard to make a graph of it, but it runs every part of the company.”\n\nAbout César Lizárraga\n\nCésar Lizárraga is a Software Engineer at CIBO, a science-driven software startup. Prior to CIBO, he worked for the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and Benson Hill Biosystems. He holds a Bachelors in Probability and Statistics from Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nWhat led you to agriculture?\n\nI was inspired to pursue a career in agriculture because of its connection to climate change – both as a source and solution to climate challenges.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being an account executive?\n\nI love problem-solving, especially complex problems that impact people; it’s what continues to excite me about the overlap between agriculture and climate change mitigation. Being an account executive puts me in direct collaboration with the people working within the world’s largest companies, trying to solve this very problem. It’s a great opportunity to support their work and play a collective role by exploring how CIBO’s solution can catalyze their supply chain emissions reduction goals.\n\nWhat do you think we should do to encourage more people to pursue careers in science?\n\nScience is the foundation for solving our world’s biggest challenges, and it starts with a curious mindset. By supporting science literacy and showing people that scientists don’t only end up in the lab but also in board rooms, software companies, government offices, and more, we can encourage people to see science as a pathway to making a difference.\n\nAward:\n\nIn 2019, I was awarded a nine-month social enterprise fellowship through the Bush Foundation’s FINNOVATION Lab Social Enterprise program. The program enabled me to research agricultural supply chains, which led me to graduate studies and research in supply chain resilience and agricultural economics.\n\nWhat brought you to CIBO?\n\nThe people! CIBO has an incredible team of people who deeply care about the people we work with and the problems we’re tackling.\n\nWhat are your primary responsibilities at CIBO?\n\nAs an account executive, I build relationships with people from food and agricultural companies and support the launch of EQIP programs with our Grower Network Partners in the Midwest.\n\nAbout Katie Myhre\n\nKatie Myhre is an Account Executive at CIBO, a science-driven software startup. Her career has spanned from early-stage supply chain tech startups to conducting research and consulting in the non-profit sector. Prior to CIBO, she worked as a Product Manager at Big Wheelbarrow, building supplier management software to support direct sourcing in the grocery industry. She holds an M.S. from the University of Minnesota in Supply Chain Management and a B.A. from St. Olaf College in Biology and Environmental Studies.\n\nWhat led you to software engineering?\n\n“I first became interested in software engineering in high school. It was back when the Apple 2 first appeared in school, but no one else was using them, so I would mess around with them and play with the software over vacations.”\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being a scientist?\n\n“Problem-solving, I like solving puzzles with purpose.”\n\nWhat is one thing that would surprise people about your field of work in software engineering?\n\n“It’s less about what you know and than if you know how to find answers. When software engineers don’t know how to complete a task, we look up how to do it. The work is about how you get things done when you’re presented with a problem, either through documentation or searches or through collaboration with others.”\n\nWhat kinds of things do you think we should be doing to encourage more people to pursue a career in computer science?\n\n“50% of the problem will be solved by more encouragement from parents to get their daughters interested in software, mathematics, and the sciences. The other half is making math and science more interesting in general.”\n\nWhat brought you to CIBO?\n\n“I was recruited by an employee who knew I was looking for a change. I had been at my previous company for 30 years, and I came to CIBO to be in an environment where I would always be learning.”\n\nWhat are your primary responsibilities at CIBO?\n\n“I focus on the performance and efficiency of the software. My work ensures that the technology can run the same task 5 million times in a row without faltering.”\n\nWhat do you find the most rewarding about your work here?\n\n“Even at this point, the work feels new. I’ve had the chance to learn and use the Scala programming language and application platforms such as Kubernetes as well as learning new things about how data science is applied to tasks like ours.”\n\nAbout Joel Skelton\n\nJoel Skelton is a Senior Software Engineer at CIBO, a science-driven software startup. Prior to CIBO, he worked as a software engineer at Intergraph, Leica Geosystems, and ERDAS. Intergraph, Leica Geosystems, and ERDAS. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics from the Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\nWhat led you to product development?\n\n“Early in my career I was focused on building my technical skills, however, I found that even if you have the best skills in the room, if the product stinks, no one cares how great the code is. Product is the bridge between technology and users; working in this area hits all my checkboxes for a rewarding career.”\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being in product development?\n\n“Working on something that has a direct connection with users. My goal is to delight users and leverage technology to solve their problems.”\n\nWhat is one thing that would surprise people about product development?\n\n“Product developers care very much about what users think.”\n\n“Most people don’t understand that product development is about deeply understanding the users and needs and trying to deliver the best possible solution to their needs. It doesn’t always mean giving customers what they ask for but, rather, figuring out how your product can best solve their needs.”\n\nWhat kinds of things do you think we should be doing to encourage more people to pursue a career in product development?\n\n“One of the things I remind people is that good product ideas can come from anywhere, it’s not just the responsibility of one designated person or group. Likewise, bad ideas can come from places we expect good ideas, which is why it’s the whole team’s responsibility to deliver a great product. If you enjoy a collaborative, multidisciplinary environment, you can participate in product development by leveraging a variety of skills.”\n\nWhat brought you to CIBO?\n\n“The unique opportunity to build a product in a space ripe for transformation. I could immediately see that CIBO has the talent and potential to be an industry leader.”\n\nWhat are your primary responsibilities at CIBO?\n\n“Building top-notch consumer products that enable our users to easily tap into the incredible depth of data offered on the CIBO platform.”\n\nWhat do you find the most rewarding about your work here?\n\n“Working among such highly intelligent and insightful area experts is a rarity in anyone’s career. The combination of the people I work with, our position to transform an industry, and the ability to leverage my technical skills makes every day exciting.”\n\nAbout Jackson Tomlinson\n\nJackson Tomlinson is the VP, Software Engineering at CIBO Technologies, a science-driven software startup. He is an experienced web and mobile application development professional with expertise delivering highly available software across a broad range of devices. Prior to CIBO, he has worked for Wells Fargo, RedBrick Health, and Cooper Power Systems. He holds a BS in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities.\n\nWhat led you to soil science and agroecology?\n\nI have always enjoyed learning and applying ideas and concepts from multiple disciplines, but I was particularly fascinated by the fact that plants must use their complex physiology to compensate for their inability to physically relocate themselves to more favorable environmental conditions, and the fact that this process is so critical to human society and life on Earth as we know it. Although photosynthesis is sexy, a plant’s ability to adapt in situ to a range of environmental conditions is largely housed in its non-photosynthetic root system, which forms a physical, chemical, and biological continuum with the soil known as the rhizosphere. I fell in love with this life-giving interface between plants and soil ecosystems through my PhD research and gradually branched out to study other aspects of agroecosystems through government and industry research. I deeply appreciate the breathtaking complexity of soils and agroecosystems, their significance to our society, and the fact that there will always be more to learn about them.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being a scientist?\n\nI get to contribute to the evolution of knowledge by thinking critically about facts, discovering new facts, and overturning old facts. I accomplish this via creative and collaborative strategies involving the acquisition, analysis, interpretation, and extrapolation of data. Data must be handled through this partially subjective process before yielding any facts.\n\nWhat is one thing that would surprise people about your field of work in agriculture/data?\n\nSoil science and agroecology demand the application of knowledge from mathematics, physics, organic and inorganic chemistry, geology, hydrology, microbiology, plant physiology, genetics, software engineering, mechanical and electrical engineering, economics, sociology, and probably many other disciplines that I have not considered. There is room for everyone in agricultural research.\n\nWhat do you think we should do to encourage more people to pursue careers in science?\n\nConvince people that their perspectives are valued, that they can learn and ask whatever they choose, that knowledge is not fixed, and that they, too, can contribute to its evolution.\n\nAwards\n\nI was awarded the opportunity to conduct a portion of my PhD research at Argonne and Pacific Northwest National Labs through the DOE Office of Science SCGSR Program and through general user proposals to the Advanced Photon Source and Environmental Molecular Sciences Lab user facilities.\n\nPublished Articles\n\nLeTourneau et al.

I would also like to support the refinement and expansion of CIBO’s crop models as a functional repository of the knowledge that will be needed to develop, incentivize, and implement more sustainable agricultural management practices.\n\nWhat are your primary responsibilities at CIBO?\n\nI am focused on model development and improvement, especially in terms of how soil processes are represented in the models and how the models can be used to predict soil conservation outcomes.\n\nWhat do you find the most rewarding about your work here?\n\nThis is a great team to work with. There is no limit to what I can learn or to what knowledge I can apply here.\n\nAbout Melissa LeTourneau\n\nMelissa LeTourneau is a Soil Model Scientist at CIBO, a science-driven software startup. Prior to CIBO, she worked as a Soil Biogeochemist at Ginkgo Bioworks and Research Soil Scientist at the USDA. She holds a Ph.d from Washington State University in Soil Chemistry and Microbiology, a B.A. from Oregon State University in Computer Science and a B.S. from Indiana University in Geological Sciences.\n\nWhat led you to software development?\n\nMy path to becoming a developer was long and winding and took me through periods working in technical support, product management, and user experience design. As a product manager, I took on a few small coding projects and found that I really enjoyed the practical, hands-on work, and logical frame of software development. I built up my skills in development by attending FlatIron School’s developer boot camp.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being a software developer?\n\nSince I have a background that spans the breadth of the software development lifecycle, I enjoy bringing a comprehensive user-centered perspective to the work that I’m doing and building a product that users will enjoy.\n\nWhat is one thing that would surprise people about your field of work in software development?\n\nI think that most people are surprised to find how accessible certain technical skills are. I always enjoy showing people how to use the developer tools in their browser to see why they’re having trouble on a website, or to find an image source, and tell them that they’re now officially a hacker.\n\nWhat kinds of things do you think we should be doing to encourage more people to pursue a career in computer science?\n\nAn understanding of what computer science actually meant would have definitely led me to computer science sooner. I studied Psychology in college, and while I enjoyed math, it didn’t seem like something that could lead me to a practical career. I think that a focus on coding and an understanding of what it looks like and can accomplish in elementary education is a great way to overcome that challenge.\n\nWhat brought you to CIBO?\n\nI’ve always been interested in working on a product and for a company that has a positive impact on the world and people’s lives. Learning that CIBO was working on a carbon platform for farmers piqued my interest. Knowing that I’d be working with a team of smart, motivated folks sealed the deal.\n\nWhat do you find the most rewarding about your work here?\n\nKnowing that I’m working on a product that has can both help growers choose sustainable practices in land management, and make a positive impact on climate change."
