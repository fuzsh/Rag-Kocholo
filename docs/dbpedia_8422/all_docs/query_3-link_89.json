        "text": "Uprising\n\nIn the early 1950s, the majority Greek-Cypriot population of Cyprus had been demanding Enosis, or union with Greece. The British, who had administered Cyprus since 1878, ruled this out in 1954 as it planned to transfer its Suez military headquarters to Cyprus.\n\nThis led Colonel George Grivasâ€™s EOKA (National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters) to begin a guerrilla campaign aimed at driving the British out.\n\nEOKA\n\nAt its peak, EOKA probably numbered around 1,250 members.\n\nThey were poorly armed, relying on smuggled or stolen weapons and even homemade firearms.\n\nIts fighters had no access to larger weapons, like mortars, and simply made their own. This mortar is a simple metal tube, which fired a homemade bomb full of scrap iron."
