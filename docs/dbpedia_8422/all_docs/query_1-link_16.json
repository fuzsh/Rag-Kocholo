The natural increase is expected to be positive, as the number of births will exceed the number of deaths by 5,891. If external migration will remain on the previous year level, the population will be increased by 7,750 due to the migration reasons. It means that the number of people who move into Cyprus (to which they are not native) in order to settle there as permanent residents (immigrants) will prevail over the number of people who leave the country to settle permanently in another country (emigrants).\n\nPopulation change rates in 2024\n\nAccording to our estimations, daily change rates of Cyprus population in 2024 will be the following:\n\n40 live births average per day (1.65 in an hour)\n\n23 deaths average per day (0.98 in an hour)\n\n21 immigrants average per day (0.88 in an hour)\n\nThe population of Cyprus will be increasing by 37 persons daily in 2024.\n\nDemographics of Cyprus 2023\n\nAs of 1 January 2024, the population of Cyprus was estimated to be 1,256,107 people. This is an increase of 1.09 % (13,495 people) compared to population of 1,242,612 the year before. In 2023 the natural increase was positive, as the number of births exceeded the number of deaths by 5,828. Due to external migration, the population increased by 7,667. The sex ratio of the total population was 1.044 (1,044 males per 1,000 females) which is higher than global sex ratio. The global sex ratio in the world was approximately 1,016 males to 1,000 females as of 2023.\n\nBelow are the key figures for Cyprus population in 2023:\n\n14,302 live births\n\n8,475 deaths\n\nNatural increase: 5,828 people\n\nNet migration: 7,667 people\n\n641,555 males as of 31 December 2023\n\n614,552 females as of 31 December 2023\n\nGrowth Rate 1952 - 2024\n\nCyprus population density\n\nCyprus population density is 135.8 people per square kilometer (351.7/mi2) as of August 2024. Density of population is calculated as permanently settled population of Cyprus divided by total area of the country. Total area is the sum of land and water areas within international boundaries and coastlines of Cyprus. The total area of Cyprus is 9,250 km2 (3,571 mi2) according to the United Nations Statistics Division .\n\nReligion in Cyprus\n\nReligion Number of followers Percentage of\n\ntotal population Christianity927,05473.3 %Islam319,97925.3 %Religiously Unaffiliated15,1771.2 %Buddhism2,5290.2 %\n\nSource: Pew Research Center. The Global Religious Landscape .\n\nNumber of followers estimated by Countrymeters (Monday, August 19 2024).\n\nCyprus age structure\n\nAs of the beginning of 2024 according to our estimates Cyprus had the following population age distribution:\n\n16.2 73.4 10.4\n\n- percentage of population under 15 - percentage of population between 15 and 64 years old - percentage of population 65+\n\nIn absolute figures (estimate):\n\n203,251 young people under 15 years old ( 104,571 males / 98,680 females)\n\n921,857 persons between 15 and 64 years old ( 479,519 males / 442,338 females)\n\n130,999 persons above 64 years old ( 56,902 males / 74,098 females)\n\nWe prepared a simplified model of the population distribution pyramid which is broken down into 3 main age groups. The groups are the same as we used above: population under 15, between 15 and 64 and population which is over 65 year old.\n\n65+\n\n15-64\n\n0-14\n\nmale female\n\nNote: The pyramid provided is not corresponding to data given above because the age groups have different number of years.\n\nAs we can see the Cyprus population pyramid has a contracting type. This type of pyramid is more common for highly developed countries with low birth and death rates. Usually countries with such kind of population age distribution model have long life expectancy, high level of education and good health care.\n\nSource: The estimation data for section \"Cyprus age structure\" is based on the latest demographic and social statistics by United Nations Statistics Division .\n\nAge dependency ratio\n\nDependency ratio of population is a ratio of people who are generally not in the labor force (the dependents) to workforce of a country (the productive part of population). The dependent part includes the population under 15 years old and people aged 65 and over. The productive part of population accordingly consists of population between 15 and 64 years.\n\nThis ratio shows the pressure on productive population produced by the dependent part of population.\n\nThe total dependency ratio of population in Cyprus is 36.3 %.\n\nThe value of 36.3 % is relatively low. It shows that the dependent part of population is less than a half of the working part. In other words the working population (labor force) in Cyprus must provide goods for itself and cover expenditure on children and aged persons. And this part of population is less than 50% of working population. The value of less than 50% means that the pressure on productive population in Cyprus is relatively low.\n\nChild dependency ratio\n\nChild dependency ratio is a ratio of people below working age (under 15) to workforce of a country.\n\nChild dependency ratio in Cyprus is 22 %.\n\nAged dependency ratio\n\nAged dependency ratio is a ratio of people above working age (65+) to workforce of a country.\n\nAged dependency ratio in Cyprus is 14.2 %.\n\nSource: The estimation data for section \"Cyprus age dependency ratio\" is based on the latest demographic and social statistics by United Nations Statistics Division .\n\nLife expectancy\n\nLife expectancy at birth is one of the most important demographic indicator. It shows the number of years a newborn infant would live assuming that birth and death rates will remain at the same level during the whole lifetime.\n\nTotal life expectancy (both sexes) at birth for Cyprus is 77.8 years.\n\nThis is above the average life expectancy at birth of the global population which is about 71 years (according to Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations).\n\nMale life expectancy at birth is 75 years.\n\nFemale life expectancy at birth is 80.7 years.\n\nLiteracy of population\n\nAccording to our estimates 1,043,025 persons or 99.07% of adult population (aged 15 years and above) in Cyprus are able to read and write. Accordingly about 9,832 adults are illiterate.\n\nLiteracy rate for adult male population is 99.46% (533,540 persons). 2,881 are illiterate.\n\nLiteracy rate for adult female population is 98.65% (509,485 persons). 6,951 are illiterate.\n\nYouth literacy rates are 99.84% and 99.88% for males and females accordingly. The overall youth literacy rate is 99.86%. Youth literacy rate definition covers the population between the ages of 15 to 24 years.\n\nSource: The estimation data for section \"Cyprus population literacy\" is based on the latest data published by UNESCO Institute for Statistics (retrieved March 13, 2016) .\n\nCyprus population history\n\nYearPopulationGrowth Rate 1951497,227N/A %1952503,5241.27 %1953510,0571.30 %1954517,3391.43 %1955525,6141.60 %1956534,7951.75 %1957544,5571.83 %1958554,2201.77 %1959562,9661.58 %1960569,9671.24 %1961574,6820.83 %1962577,0540.41 %1963577,8080.13 %1964578,2750.08 %1965579,8100.27 %1966583,1600.58 %1967588,3320.89 %1968594,9181.12 %1969602,3391.25 %1970609,9001.26 %1971617,2691.21 %1972624,4511.16 %1973631,5831.14 %1974638,7431.13 %1975646,0681.15 %1976653,6601.18 %1977661,5551.21 %1978669,4191.19 %1979676,6591.08 %1980682,7240.90 %1981687,3040.67 %1982690,4530.46 %1983692,9060.36 %1984695,9050.43 %1985700,7290.69 %1986708,0501.04 %1987717,9051.39 %1988729,9661.68 %1989743,8191.90 %1990758,8932.03 %1991774,9362.11 %1992791,9132.19 %1993809,7552.25 %1994828,0022.25 %1995846,3232.21 %1996864,4582.14 %1997882,3812.07 %1998900,0222.00 %1999917,4511.94 %2000934,7161.88 %2001951,8511.83 %2002968,6901.77 %2003985,3331.72 %20041,002,0321.69 %20051,019,1041.70 %20061,036,6561.72 %20071,054,6831.74 %20081,072,6871.71 %20091,089,8961.60 %20101,105,4131.42 %20111,118,7771.21 %20121,129,9691.00 %20131,139,4920.84 %20141,148,1160.76 %20151,156,6780.75 %20161,165,6130.77 %20171,174,9760.80 %20181,184,5130.81 %20191,193,9560.80 %20201,202,9920.76 %20211,216,0561.09 %20221,229,2621.09 %20231,242,6121.09 %20241,256,1071.09 %\n\nThe data is given as of 1st of January of an year."
