        "text": "This article explores the involvement of the Norman nobility in the wars between Christians and Muslims in the Ebro Valley in the rst half of the 12th Century. The work recognises how the participation of this particular ethno-cultural group in the peninsula was renovated to a certain degree by the deeds and religious transformation that took place as a result of the preaching and success of the First Crusade. Furthermore, by exploring the careers of Rotrou of Perche, Robert Burdet and Walter Guidvilla this piece demonstrates how their religiosity as well as the lial relations and traditional desire for wealth that characterise this group of warriors, made the Iberian theatre of con ict so attractive at this particular period. Also, this article, tries to show how their Iberians lay and clerical coreligionists perceived the usefulness of these Norman contingents in their con ict with the Almoravids.\n\nThis article revisits the failed attempt to conquer Lisbon by a combined host of Anglo-Norman and Portuguese crusaders in 1142 within the wider context of both the crusader movement to the Holy Land and the Iberian Reconquista. Focusing on the Historia Gothorum, De expugnatione Lyxbonensi and other sources, it endeavours to demonstrate the degree of involvement of the Anglo-Norman contingents in maritime adventures at a time when no other crusades had been declared. Finally, it illustrates the consequence of this undertaking for the final conquest of Lisbon, as part of the Second Crusade, in 1147.\n\nIn contemporary Western societies, who are going through a neo-romantic stage, the Crusades have led to an immense literature and a remarkable popularity. In the scientific field, this phenomenon has encouraged the debate on the ideological and cultural issues surrounding Crusade. Since that in the Iberian Peninsula had developed fights between Muslims and Christians before 1096, it is inevitable that historians have wondered about the influence of the reconquest in the origins of the crusading movement. In this paper, we critized the widespread view among Anglo-Saxon historians, according to which secular piety and spirituality were instrumental in the development of the First Crusade, and struggles carried out in the Iberian Peninsula did not influence in the extraordinary adhesion of the European nobles to this issue. In addition, other concepts that may help to explain the intensity of the response, such as \" aristocratic networks, \" and at the same time help to understand the weight of the Hispanic experience in this movement.\n\nThis article focuses on the Frisian narrative De itinere frisonum, while comparing it with other evidence available in order to explain the behaviour of the Frisian fleet's actions in the Iberian Peninsula during the Fifth Crusade. It examines the Frisian activities within the framework of the crusading traditions established by this group. It also discusses why despite Innocent III's disqualification of the Iberian theatre in Quia maior, the Frisians did not change their views on the crusading nature of their actions in that theatre as has been traditionally argued by reinterpreting the source material. Also, it addresses how the Frisian author of De itinere sought to legitimise his compatriots' actions in comparison to other groups during the crusading journey. Additionally, this article contains in the appendix an edited version of De itinere frisonum in Latin with its corresponding English translation.\n\nMy paper today seeks to integrate sources from across time, cultures, and disciplines to achieve a better understanding of the Crusades, and to change our focus from land to sea. To answer Tyerman’s famous question: Yes, there were Crusades in the 12 century – a plurality of them, in the ‘military intention’ view of Riley-Smith and Phillips. All around the European Atlantic, said Levecq: ... the river peoples... became globally integrated... and the frontier regions, won in an outburst of faith, became more and more... [important] to develop and to control maritime commerce for political and economic benefit."
