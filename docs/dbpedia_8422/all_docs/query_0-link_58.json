Spending increased for all major types; the largest increase was for air PAC (12.4 percent). Real spending for pollution abatement (PA), the largest component of PAC, increased 7.6 percent in 1994. Spending increased substantially across all major sectors of the economy; the largest increase was for personal consumption PA (11.8 percent). During 1972-94, real PAC spending increased at an average annual rate of 3.6 percent. By type, the fastest growth was in solid waste PAC spending (6.3 percent). I\\egularf6eatures 1 Business Situation RealcDP increased 4.8 percent in the second quarter of 1996 after increasing 2.0 percent in the first quarter; the step-up was largely accounted for by an upturn in inventory investment and a pickup in government spending. Corporate profits increased $8.7 billion in the second quarter after increasing $33.3 billion in the first. As a result of larger increases in receipts than in expenditures, the Federal Government current deficit decreased $24.2 billion, to $131.0 billion, and the State and local government current surplus increased $10.0 billion, to $101.0 billion. 42 State and Local Government Fiscal Position, 1995 The current surplus of State and local governments decreased $4.7 billion, to $95.0 billion, in 1995. Receipts decelerated slightly, reflecting decelerations in all components except personal income taxes. Current expenditures accelerated, largely reflecting accelerations in consumption expenditures and in transfer payments for medical care. For 1996, available information suggests an increase of about $8-$i4 billion in the current surplus of State and local governments. —Continued on next page — ti SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS and statistical presentations 11 National Income and Product Accounts 11 35 37 Selected NIPA Tables NIPA Charts Reconciliation and Other Special Tables 38 Selected Monthly Estimates 40 Customer Satisfaction Report 69 Foreign Direct Investment in the United States: Detail for Historical-Cost Position and Related Capital and Income Flows, 1995 98 U.S. Direct Investment Abroad: Detail for Historical-Cost Position and Related Capital and Income Flows, 1995 Inside back cover: BEA Information (A listing of recent BEA publications available from the Government Printing Office) Back cover: Schedule of Upcoming BEA News Releases LOOKING AHEAD Revision of Annual State Personal Income.

September 1996 SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS September 1996 This article was prepared by Larry R. Moran, Daniel Larkins, Ralph W. Morris, Deborah Y. Sieff, and Michael W. Webb. BUSINESS SITUATION CCORDING TO the \"preliminary\" estimates of e national income and product accounts (NIPA'S), real gross domestic product (GDP) increased 4.8 percent in the second quarter of 1996 (table i and chart i); the \"advance\" estimate of real GDP, reported in the August \"Business Situation,\" had shown a 4.2-percent increase.1 The upward revision was more than accounted for by upward revisions to net exports and to nonresidential fixed investment. The change in real final sales of domestic product was revised up to a 4.3-percent increase from the 3.5-percent increase reported a month ago. (The sources of the revisions are discussed in the \"Revisions\" section.) The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 2.1 percent, o.i percentage point more than reported a month ago. The 4.8-percent increase in real GDP was the largest increase in 2 years; real GDP increased 2.0 percent in the first quarter. The large stepup was primarily accounted for by an upturn in inventory investment and by a pickup in government spending, but residential investment, exports, and imports also contributed. Personal consumption expenditures increased about the CHART 1 Real Product: Change from Preceding Quarter Billion chained (1992)$ 100 60 40 i. Quarterly estimates in the NIPA'S are expressed at seasonally adjusted annual rates, and quarterly changes are differences between these rates. Quarter-to-quarter percent changes are annualized.

Real gross domestic purchases increased 5.4 percent in the second quarter after increasing 3.0 percent in the first. Unlike GDP, gross domestic purchases includes imports and excludes exports; thus, it represents purchases by U.S. residents regardless of where the goods and services were produced. In the second quarter, exports of goods and services increased more than in the first quarter, while imports increased less than in the first quarter. The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 2.1 percent in the second quarter after increasing 2.3 percent in the first. The price index for GDP increased 2.2 percent in the second quarter after increasing 2.3 percent in the first.

An upturn in medical care and a step-up in household operation were offset by slowdowns in \"other\" services and in transportation. The step-up in household operation reflected an upturn in \"other household operation\" and an even larger increase in electricity than in the first quarter, reflecting an increase in the demand for heating in response to colderthan-normal temperatures. In \"other\" services, step-ups in recreational services and education were more than offset by a downturn in personal business services—primarily in brokerage and investment counseling. Housing services increased the same in both quarters. 5.6 percent. Real disposable personal income increased less in the second quarter than in the first—1.6 percent, compared with 2.0 percent. The Index of Consumer Sentiment (prepared by the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center) increased for the second consecutive quarter but remained below the levels posted in most of 1994 and 1995. Expenditures for durable goods jumped 11.8 percent after increasing 8.2 percent. The acceleration was more than accounted for by furniture and household equipment—largely consumer electronics. \"Other\" durable goods and motor vehicles both increased less in the second quarter than in the first. In \"other\" durable goods, a step-up in sporting equipment was more than offset by a slowdown in jewelry and watches. In motor vehicles, new trucks decreased in the second quarter after increasing in the first, and new autos decreased more in the second quarter than in the first. Nonresidential fixed investment Real private nonresidential fixed investment increased 4.0 percent in the second quarter after increasing 11.6 percent in the first (table 3). Both producers' durable equipment (PDE) and structures contributed to the slowdown. Factors that affect investment spending have been mixed recently. On the one hand, real final sales of domestic product increased 3.1 percent over the past four quarters, and domestic corporate profits increased 19.3 percent. On the other hand, the capacity utilization rate in manufacturing decreased about i percentage point over the same four quarters. Long-term interest rates have shown little trend over the period; for example, Expenditures for nondurable goods increased 1.6 percent after increasing 3.7 percent. The slowdown was more than accounted for by expenditures for food, which declined after increasing; also contributing to the slowdown were \"other\" nondurable goods, which increased less in the second quarter than in the first, and fuel and coal, which turned down. Gasoline and oil turned up, and clothing and shoes increased more in the second quarter than in the first.

PDE increased 6.0 percent after increasing 13.1 percent. Three of the four major components of PDE contributed to the slowdown: Information processing equipment—especially computers and peripheral equipment—increased less than in the first quarter; transportation equipment turned down, reflecting a downturn in aircraft; and \"other\" PDE increased less than in the first quarter. In contrast, industrial equipment increased somewhat more than in the first quarter. Structures decreased 1.2 percent after increasing 7.7 percent. Mining exploration, shafts, and wells was little changed from the first quarter, when it posted its biggest increase since 1987; nonresidential buildings turned down, and \"other\" structures decreased more than in the first quarter. In contrast, construction by utilities increased somewhat more in the second quarter than in the first. Residential investment Real residential investment increased 15.9 percent in the second quarter, more than double the 7.4-percent increase in the first (table 3). All three major components—singlefamily structures, multifamily structures, and \"other\" residential investment—contributed to the step-up. Single-family structures increased 15.7 percent after increasing 11.0 percent. Investment in single-family structures, which measures value of construction put-in-place rather than the value of home sales, make up about half of residential investment. Housing starts are a major contributor in determining single-family construction: Single-family construction in a quarter largely reflects single-family housing starts in the first 2 months of that quarter and the last 2 months of the preceding quarter. Therefore, construction in the second quarter of 1996 reflected starts that occurred in February through May. For that period, housing starts averaged 1.17 million units, up from an average of 1.15 million units in November through February, the 4 months reflected in the first-quarter construction estimates (chart 3). Multifamily construction increased 42.2 percent after increasing 16.7 percent. \"Other\" residential investment increased 12.3 percent after increasing 2.0 percent.2 The stepup was accounted for by brokers' commissions, which increased nearly three times faster in the second quarter than in the first, and by mobile homes, which turned up in the second quarter. The large second-quarter increase in brokers' commissions, which make up about one-eighth of total residential investment, reflected an increase in sales of new and existing homes. Sales 2. \"Other\" residential investment includes improvements, new mobile home sales, brokers' commissions on house sales, and residential equipment.

September 1996 Wholesale trade inventories increased slightly less in the second quarter than in the first. The small step-down was more than accounted for by inventories of durable goods, which increased less than in the first quarter; In contrast, inventories of nondurable goods increased after decreasing; the increase was accounted for by paper products and \"other nondurable goods.\" \"Other\" nonfarm inventories also increased less in the second quarter than in the first.3 Manufacturing inventories decreased in the second quarter after increasing for 13 consecutive quarters. The downturn was accounted for by both durable and nondurable goods; durable goods increased much less in the second quarter than in the first, and nondurable goods decreased much more in the second quarter than in the first. Farm inventories decreased $5.2 billion in the second quarter after decreasing $6.5 billion in the first; the second quarter marked the sixth consecutive quarter of inventory reduction. Inventories of both crops and livestock decreased in the second quarter. The ratio of real nonfarm business inventories to real final sales of domestic business declined to 2.24 in the second quarter from 2.26 in the first. The inventory-sales ratio in which final sales are limited to goods and structures declined to 4.01, the lowest level in 8 years, from 4.06. Inventory investment Real inventory investment—that is, the change in business inventories—increased $10.2 billion in the second quarter, as business added $7.2 billion to inventories after reducing them $3.0 billion in the first quarter. In contrast, inventory investment had decreased $17.6 billion in the first quarter (table 4). The upswing in inventory investment largely reflected an upturn in nonfarm inventories, which was more than accounted for by inventories of retail motor vehicle dealers. Nonfarm inventories increased $11.9 billion in the second quarter after increasing $2.9 billion in the first. The second-quarter step-up was more than accounted for by retail trade inventories, which increased more in the second quarter than in the first. Wholesale trade and \"other\" inventories increased less than in the first quarter. Retail trade inventories increased in the second quarter after a substantial drop in the first. The second-quarter upturn was largely accounted for by inventories of motor vehicle dealers, but other durable goods and nondurable goods also contributed. Inventories of motor vehicle dealers edged up slightly after dropping sharply in the first quarter; the drop reflected a reduction in output that was partly due to a strike by workers of a motor vehicle manufacturer. Other durable goods, particularly auto and home supply and lumber and building materials, increased a little more in the second quarter than in the first, and inventories of nondurable goods decreased less in the second quarter than in the first. Exports and imports Real exports of goods and services increased 4.8 percent in the second quarter after increasing 1.8 percent in the first (table 5).

Imports of services turned down; much of the downturn was accounted for by travel abroad by U.S. residents, which decreased after increasing. Exports of goods increased 7.0 percent after increasing 1.5 percent. A downturn in exports of agricultural goods was more than offset by an upturn in exports of nonagricultural goods that largely reflected a step-up in exports of nonautomotive capital goods. Among capital goods, exports of civilian aircraft increased substantially more in the second quarter than in the first, and exports of capital goods excluding aircraft and computers decreased substantially less than in the first quarter; in contrast, exports of computers slowed. Exports of services turned down. Imports of goods increased 11.6 percent after increasing 10.2 percent. The step-up was more than accounted for by a sharp upturn in petroleum imports; imports of nonpetroleum goods slowed as imports of nonautomotive capital goods turned down. Among capital goods, Government spending Real government consumption expenditures and gross investment increased 8.2 percent in the second quarter after increasing 1.6 percent in the first (table 6). Federal Government spending increased more than in the first quarter, and State and local government spending turned up sharply. Federal defense spending increased 11.6 percent after increasing 4.1 percent.

Investment decreased slightly after increasing substantially. Federal nondefense spending increased 9.0 percent after increasing 10.1 percent. The secondquarter increase was accounted for by consumption expenditures, primarily for employee compensation. State and local government spending increased 6.8 percent after decreasing 0.9 percent. The upswing was attributable to upturns in employee compensation, which reflected work made up in the second quarter by education employees for work that had been lost in the first quarter as a result of the Blizzard of 1996, and in investment in structures.4 The upward revision to government spending was primarily in Federal defense spending and mainly reflected the incorporation of detailed Treasury Department data for June and detailed Defense Department data for the quarter. These detailed data are used to adjust the timing and coverage of other source data to make them conform to the Federal defense spending concepts and definitions used in the NIPA'S and to fill gaps in their coverage. Complete detailed data are generally not available for the advanced estimate. The downward revision to consumer spending primarily reflected revised Census Bureau data on retail trade sales for May and June. The downward revision to the change in business inventories was more than accounted for Table 7.—Revisions to Real Gross Domestic Product and Prices, Second Quarter 1996 [Seasonally adjusted at annual rates] Revisions As noted earlier, the preliminary estimate of a 4.8-percent increase in real GDP in the second quarter is 0.6 percentage point higher than the advance estimate (table 7); for 1981-92, the average revision, without regard to sign, from the advance estimate of real GDP to the preliminary estimate was 0.6 percentage point. The preliminary estimate of the increase in the price index for gross domestic purchases is 2.1 percent in the second quarter, o.i percentage point higher than the advance estimate. The upward revision to real GDP was more than accounted for by upward revisions to net exports and to nonresidential fixed investment. The upward revision to net exports reflected a much larger downward revision to imports than to exports. The downward revision to imports reflected revisions both to goods, based on new Census Bureau data for June, and to services, based largely on new source data for June. The downward revision to exports reflected revisions to services, based on new source data for June. The upward revision to nonresidential fixed investment mainly reflected newly available Census Bureau data for the value of construction put in place (used to estimate structures) for June and revised Census Bureau data for manufacturers' shipments of machinery and equipment (used to estimate PDE) for June. 4. BEA estimated the first-quarter loss of real government output due to the shutdowns associated with the January 8 blizzard at $2.1 billion for the Federal Government and $4.0 billion for State and local governments, and BEA estimated the second-quarter addition for State and local government output as a result of days worked by education employees to make up for days lost to the blizzard at $1.8 billion.

SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS 8 • September 1996 by revisions to nonfarm inventories and reflected newly available Census Bureau data on the book value of manufacturing and trade inventories for June. The increase in real disposable personal income was revised up o.i percentage point to 1.6 percent; current-dollar personal income was revised up slightly, and personal tax and nontax payments was revised down slightly. The personal saving rate was revised up o.i percentage point to 4.4 percent. Corporate Profits Profits from current production increased $8.7 billion in the second quarter after increasing $33.3 billion in the first (table 8).5 Profits from domestic operations increased $14.5 billion after increasing $31.9 billion. Profits of financial corporations increased slightly in the second quarter after increasing sharply in the first. Profits of nonfinancial corporations 5.

The difference between the $36.2 billion slowdown in PBT and the $24.6 billion slowdown in profits from current production was more than accounted for by inventory profits (especially in petroleum .003 0 .002 NOTE.-Levels of these and other profits series are found in NIPA tables 1.14, 1.16, 6.16C, and 7.15. Industry profits.—Industry profits—corporate profits with inventory valuation adjustment— increased $6.2 billion in the second quarter after increasing $29.5 billion in the first.6 The slowdown mainly reflected a sharp deceleration in profits of financial corporations and a downturn in profits from the rest of the world. For financial corporations, profits had rebounded in the first quarter from a fourth-quarter level that had been depressed by claims arising from Hurricane Opal. For profits from the rest of the world—that is, receipts of profits from foreign affiliates of U.S. companies less payments of profits by U.S. affiliates of foreign companies—preliminary and incomplete information suggests that the secondquarter downturn was more than accounted for by a downturn in receipts. For nonfinancial corporations, manufacturing profits increased about as much in the second quarter as in the first; a downturn in profits of wholesale trade was more than offset by an upturn in profits of the transportation and utilities group. 6.2 12.2 Dollars Unit price, costs, and profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations: Unit price Unit labor cost Unit nonlabor cost Unit profits from current production increased about the same amount in both quarters; both real output and unit profits increased in both quarters. The increases in unit profits reflected higher unit prices and lower unit nonlabor costs that more than offset an increase in unit labor costs. Profits from the rest of the world turned down, decreasing $5.9 billion after increasing $1.5 billion. Cash flow from current production, a profitsrelated measure of internally generated funds available for investment, increased $7.2 billion after increasing $15.4 billion. The ratio of cash flow to nonresidential fixed investment, an indicator of the share of the current level of investment that could be financed by internally generated funds, increased to 83.2 percent from 82.9 percent. These levels are near the low end of the range in which the ratio has fluctuated during most of this decade but are substantially higher than the levels typically posted in the 1980*5. 6. Industry profits, which are estimated as the sum of corporate profits before tax and the inventory valuation adjustment, are shown in NIPA table 6.i6c. Estimates of the capital consumption adjustment do not exist at a detailed industry level; they are available only for total financial and total nonfinancial industries. SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS refining), which are represented in the NIPA'S by the inventory valuation adjustment (with the sign reversed). Government Sector The fiscal position of the government sector improved in the second quarter of 1996, as the combined current deficit of the Federal Government and State and local governments decreased $34.2 billion, to $30.1 billion (table 9). The improvement was attributable to a decrease in the Federal Government current deficit and to an increase in the State and local government current surplus. September 1996 • acceleration was primarily attributable to contributions for social security (old-age, survivors, disability, and health insurance), which increased $8.8 billion after increasing $6.0 billion; these increases reflect the pattern of wages and salaries, and in the first quarter, an increase in the social security taxable wage base. Corporate profits tax accruals increased $2.8 billion after increasing $12.1 billion. The deceleration reflected the pattern of corporate profits. Table 9.—Government Sector Receipts and Current Expenditures Level Federal The Federal Government current deficit decreased $24.2 billion, to $131.0 billion, in the second quarter after increasing $0.7 billion in the first. The Federal current deficit is the smallest since the third quarter of 1989. Receipts.—Receipts increased $49.4 billion in the second quarter after increasing $28.4 billion in the first. The acceleration was more than accounted for by personal tax and nontax receipts. Personal tax and nontax receipts increased $38.5 billion after increasing $16.3 billion. The acceleration was attributable to income taxes. Estimated income tax payments less refunds increased $22.5 billion after increasing $13.1 billion; this acceleration reflected provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 that allowed certain retroactive taxes to be paid in three annual installments, the last of which was due in April 1996. Withheld income taxes increased $13.3 billion after increasing $3.6 billion; annual indexation for inflation on the 1996 withholding tables held down the first-quarter increase, and an acceleration in wages and salaries boosted the second-quarter increase. Indirect business tax and nontax accruals decreased $1.2 billion after decreasing $6.9 billion. The decreases were largely attributable to air transport excise taxes, which decreased $0.9 billion after decreasing $5.9 billion. These taxes expired at the end of 1995 as a result of the Federal budget impasse in December, but an additional $0.9 billion in taxes was recorded in the NIPA'S in the first quarter because some tickets were purchased before December 31 for flights taken in the first quarter. Contributions for social insurance increased $9.4 billion after increasing $6.7 billion. The 9 1996: II Government sector Receipts .

The deceleration was more than accounted for by transfer payments. Transfer payments (net) increased $1.4 billion after increasing $25.3 billion; the slowdown was due to a downturn in payments to the rest of the world and to a deceleration in payments to persons. Transfer payments to the rest of the world decreased $7.5 billion after increasing $7.4 billion; the increase in the first quarter was more than accounted for by $9.6 billion (annual rate) in payments to Israel to finance military purchases. Transfer payments to persons increased $8.9 billion after increasing $17.9 billion. Most of this deceleration was accounted for by social security benefits (old-age, survivors, and disability insurance), which increased $2.3 billion after increasing $9.8 billion; the first-quarter increase reflected a 2.6-percent cost-of-living adjustment that went into effect in January. In addition, the first-quarter growth in transfer payments to persons was boosted by a $2.9 billion increase in earned income tax credits. Consumption expenditures increased $11.1 billion after increasing $2.2 billion. Expenditures for national defense increased $9.6 billion after decreasing $1.4 billion. The upturn was mostly accounted for by a turnaround in defense services, which increased $5.7 billion after decreasing $3.6 billion. Within services, upturns in installation support and personnel support and an acceleration in research and development were partly offset by downturns in compensation of employees. Compensation decreased $1.1 billion after increasing $1.6 billion, reflecting the pattern of military employment and Department of Defense civilian employment and a military pay raise that went into effect in January. Nondefense consumption expenditures increased $1.5 billion after increasing $3.6 billion; the deceleration re- flected a Federal civilian pay raise that went into effect in January. Grants-in-aid to State and local governments increased $11.7 billion after increasing $4.3 billion. The acceleration was more than accounted for by grants for medicaid, which increased $10.6 billion after decreasing $0.4 billion. Net interest paid increased $0.3 billion after decreasing $3.4 billion. The upturn was accounted for by net interest paid to the rest of the world, which increased $3.2 billion after decreasing $0.5 billion. State and local The State and local government current surplus increased $10.0 billion, to $101.0 billion, in the second quarter after increasing $2.9 billion in the first. The acceleration was attributable to receipts. Receipts increased $22.8 billion after increasing $15.9 billion. The acceleration was more than accounted for by Federal grants-in-aid. Personal tax and nontax receipts increased $3.9 billion after increasing $1.5 billion. The acceleration was attributable to income taxes: Annual indexation for inflation in several States held down the increase in the first quarter, and an acceleration in wages and salaries boosted income taxes in the second. Corporate profits tax accruals increased $0.6 billion after increasing $2.5 billion, reflecting the deceleration in corporate profits. Indirect business tax and nontax accruals increased $5.9 billion after increasing $6.9 billion; sales taxes and other tax and nontax accruals contributed to the deceleration. Current expenditures increased $12.8 billion after increasing $13.0 billion. Consumption expenditures increased $8.9 billion after increasing $9.4 billion; the deceleration was mostly attributable to services other than compensation and to consumption of general government fixed capital. Transfer payments to persons increased $3.9 billion after increasing $3.5 billion.

Because the formula for the chain-type quantity indexes uses weights of more than one period, the corresponding chained-dollar estimates are usually not additive. The residual line is the difference between the first line and the sum of the most detailed lines. l6 ® September 1996 SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS 3.
