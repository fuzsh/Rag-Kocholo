        "text": "Turkish Cypriots who voted for the plan now feel they were shunned by their Greek countrymen as well as the EU they’d hoped to join.\n\n“We said ‘yes,’ but we’re still out because of the ‘no’ vote of another community,” Akıncı said.\n\nWhile the Turkish and Greek halves have in many ways grown further apart since 2004, they have also had time to explore the other side, after the Green Line was opened in 2003. That means anyone can now cross over, as long as they show ID.\n\nThe poorer Turks tend to cross more. They spent €16 million in southern Cyprus in 2014, while Greeks spent €11.6 million in the north, according to the card processing company JCC Payment Systems.\n\nBut there are still many, especially Greeks — even in Nicosia, with a crossing point in the city center — who have never ventured over. The very idea of showing a passport or ID to enter a part of their own country, some say, is too upsetting.\n\nEconomic prize\n\nIt’s the economic impetus of reunification that has helped to build the current momentum for a deal.\n\nReunification could add around €12,000 to per capita incomes and expand the economy by €20 billion over 20 years, the PRIO Cyprus Centre reported in May 2014. That would almost double the Greek Cypriot government-controlled area’s GDP of $23.23 billion in 2014. Northern Cyprus’ GDP is estimated to be $4.27 billion.\n\nThe benefits range from resurrecting the ghost town of Varosha in the north, closed off by the Turkish military since 1974, to its former glory as one of Europe’s most exclusive seaside resorts, to reopening the Turkish part’s ports and airports, currently boycotted by the Greek Cypriot government and many of its economic partners, to selling the country’s newly discovered wealth of offshore natural gas.\n\n“We are really looking desperately for a solution,” said Mehmet Harmancı, mayor of the Turkish side of Nicosia. “After the solution we would be able to compete with other European towns and cities in terms of infrastructure, in terms of quality of people’s lives, and of course for the flow of tourists.”\n\nThe country’s first gas discovery in late 2011, the Aphrodite field, has further fueled hope for a solution. It’s not a huge gas deposit, with 127 billion cubic meters, but it’s enough to rake in new export revenues, and is expected to be the first of more.\n\nOil and gas companies and the government have looked at a variety of options for selling the gas since 2011, including combining it with Israel’s offshore gas and exporting it by ship, from a gas liquefaction plant, or by pipeline to Turkey, Egypt, Jordan or Lebanon. Turkey, however, remains out of the question for now, unless Cyprus reunifies and normalizes its relationship with Ankara.\n\nUntil then, the gas could also drive tensions between the Cypriot government, which wants to plough ahead with exploration for more resources, and Turkey and Turkish Cypriots, who say the gas belongs to the entire country. Turkey sent ships to Cypriot waters in October 2014 to protest the exploration work, prompting Anastasiades to walk away from settlement talks.\n\nAnastasiades’ government launched a new bidding round for exploration rights in late March. While it’s likely to be many months at least before those permits lead to drilling, Akıncı is quick to warn that drilling before reunification would put the talks in jeopardy.\n\nAkıncı, as well as many in the industry, argue the pipeline to Turkey is the cheapest and quickest option for selling the gas. Nicosia is keeping its options open, and in the meantime is courting gas-hungry Egypt, although that market’s potential for Cyprus is less clear since the discovery of the huge Zohr gas field last year in Egyptian waters.\n\nTurkish wild card\n\nWhile Anastasiades and Akıncı negotiate head-to-head, another presence looms large; Ankara and its strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.\n\nGreek Cypriots are adamant that Turkey withdraw all of its troops and recognize the Cypriot government as the country’s legitimate government and member of the EU that Ankara also says it wants to join.\n\n“We have not yet seen a real signal from the decision-makers in Turkey that it will withdraw its guarantee and troops,” said Kornelios Korneliou, Cyprus’ ambassador to the EU. “Ankara has the key to this.”\n\nAs the smaller of the two groups, Turkish Cypriots instead worry about being swallowed up by the Greeks. They accept the need to reduce Turkey’s presence, but are reluctant to sever the tie entirely.\n\n“Security, in the eyes, in the minds, of the Turkish Cypriots is connected with the continuation of Turkish guarantees,” Akıncı said. “The crux of the matter here is: How do we [ensure] this security concern of the Turkish Cypriots is not perceived as a threat by the Greek Cypriot population?”\n\nHe said he would be willing to cut the number of Turkish troops down to 650, as called for in Cyprus’ 1960 constitution (which also provided for 950 from Greece).\n\nOf course, if Cyprus does reach a resolution, its gas could also create new grounds for cooperation with Turkey. Turkey’s demand for gas is growing, and the country’s relationship with one of its primary suppliers — Russia — is souring. Even gas imports from Israel would have to cross Cypriot waters to get to Turkey, which won’t happen unless Cyprus gets behind the project. A pipeline to Turkey would generate €1.3 billion in fresh investment in Cyprus, according to the PRIO research.\n\nPresident Erdoğan has hinted that he would like the Cyprus Problem to be put to rest. The standoff with Nicosia impedes the country from entering full-fledged negotiations to join the EU, or at least form a special bond with the bloc. One problem for Erdoğan is that Turkish settlers now make up roughly half the population in the north, many of them born in Cyprus. The Greek side’s demand to repatriate settlers may be opposed by Ankara.\n\nHome sweet home\n\nVisions of lucrative gas deals haven’t drained the emotions from the dispute.\n\nAt the heart of the negotiations is the loss of property, and the question of how to compensate people who were forced out of their homes 42 years ago. It gets even trickier when considering the interests of those who now occupy those buildings and plots.\n\nIt’s going be an expensive problem to resolve, and a highly sensitive one. Early estimates put the total cost of reunification at €20-25 billion, much of it for property.\n\nGreek Cypriots feel that Turkey has denied their rights to use their own property — a position that Loizidou, the Nicosia tourist guide, confirmed in the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights in 2014 ordered Turkey to pay €90 million for human rights violations related to the Cypriot occupation.\n\nLoizidou is the only person on the island that Turkey has ever compensated for the loss, as well as moral damage, of property to which she still has a title — $1.2 million (including interest) in 2003. The Strasbourg-based court in 2014 also ordered Turkey to pay €90 million for other human rights violations related to the Cypriot occupation, but Ankara has refused to pay.\n\nAnastasiades and Akıncı agree that property claims will be dealt with case-by-case, through a committee made up of an equal number of Greeks and Turks, and one foreigner.\n\nBut they’re not entirely in sync on the issue. Many Greeks — who lost the majority of the property at issue — say they want it back. Turks say they’ll likely stay put in the north.\n\n“For the Turkish Cypriots, the main psychological issue will be security, they would prefer to be secure than to go and live over there,” Harmancı said.\n\n“Imagine people who are 25, 30 or 40 years old — they have created their lives in the north or south. I don’t expect people would leave their streets, leave their communities, to live in a place where they feel like they’re in England, or another foreign country.”"
