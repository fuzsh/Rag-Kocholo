        "text": "November 24, 2004 Government Presents Conditions for Nicosia's Vote on Turkey's Accession Talks Washington, D.C. - The Cyprus government identified five conditions that it said Turkey would have to meet if Nicosia is to agree to the start of its accession talks at the December 17 EU summit. According to Foreign Minister George Iacovou, the Cyprus government expects Turkey to recognize the Republic of Cyprus; set a timetable for the withdrawal of some 35,000 Turkish troops from northern Cyprus; carry out the repatriation of the Turkish settlers in the north; implement measures to prevent the sale of Greek Cypriot-owned property in northern Cyprus; and lift its ban on Cyprus becoming a member of international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Iacovou said the message to Turkey was: \"Help us if you want us to help you, or do not make things difficult for us so we do not make problems for you.\" He added, \"It seems ridiculous for Turkey to recognize a positive vote from Cyprus and, on December 18, not to recognize the Republic of Cyprus.\" In addition, he asked how the European Commission could say that it \"will protect Europe from Turkish migration when Turkey is already . . . changing the population ratios\" in Cyprus through the settlement of tens of thousands of Turks from the mainland. President Tassos Papadopoulos said the Cyprus government supported the granting of a date for Turkey to begin accession negotiations \"if Turkey complies and respects its obligations vis-à-vis the European Union and each member state.\" He added that, \"from there on, there are contacts taking place, in an effort to present a consensus proposal, so that Turkey will comply with these obligations.\" Papadopoulos asserted that Turkey's recognition of Cyprus was inevitable, though it was not clear when it would happen. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said that Turkey does not intend to recognize Cyprus prior to the EU summit. Turkey has also said it would be unwilling to accept any conditions related to Cyprus attached to the EU's decision to open membership talks. October 29, 2004 Diplomatic Protest Over U.S. Inspection of Northern Cyprus Airport Washington, D.C. - President Tassos Papadopoulos said his government had been in contact with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) concerning the October 20-21 visit of officials from the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) to northern Cyprus to inspect the safety and security features of the Ercan airport. Papadopoulos asserted that he believed Cyprus had a strong case against any possible opening of airports in the north, which the government regards as illegal. Referring to the visit of the TSA officials, he pledged \"to face this blow to the legality and the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus.\" Government spokesman Kypros Chrysostomides said Cyprus’s position was \"based on international conventions, on international law, and on the right of every country to define its legal airports and ports for entry to and exit from the Republic of Cyprus.\" Foreign Minister George Iacovou said the government had lodged a protest with the U.S. Embassy in Nicosia concerning the inspection of the airport. State Department spokesman Adam Ereli said the United States, by deciding to \"gather more details involving the security of airports and flights\" to and from northern Cyprus, \"looks forward to finding ways to support the recommendations of the United Nations secretary general to facilitate the settlement of the Cyprus issue with the termination of the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community.\" Ereli stated that the ICAO had not been involved in the visit of the TSA officials and that the U.S. \"has not decided whether it will inaugurate an air link between the U.S. and northern Cyprus.\" Under the guidelines set up by the United Nations, the ICAO recognizes the Cyprus government as the sovereign entity responsible for implementing the safety standards established by the ICAO at airports in the country. October 22, 2004 Turkish Cypriot Government Resigns Washington, D.C. - The Turkish Cypriot prime minister, Mehmet Ali Talat, announced the resignation of his coalition government on October 20 following months of negotiations between the government and other parties in search of an ally that would enable the coalition to regain a majority in the Turkish Cypriot parliament. Talat had been in office for nine months. The coalition, made up of Talat's Republican Turkish Party and Serdar Denktash's Democrat Party, lost its slim majority in the 50-seat parliament two days after the April 24 referendum on the Annan reunification plan because of defections from the parliamentary groups of both parties. Talat said he would remain in office as a caretaker prime minister until a new government was established. Rauf Denktash, the president of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, asked former Turkish Cypriot prime minister Dervis Eroglu, the leader of the National Unity Party, the largest group in parliament, to form a government. Eroglu opposed endorsement of the Annan plan in the referendum. Denktash has the authority to call early elections within 60 days if efforts to set up a coalition fail. Talat, who, backed by Ankara, spearheaded a campaign to encourage Turkish Cypriots to vote \"yes\" on the Annan plan in the referendum, is popular in northern Cyprus for his pro-EU, pro-reunification stance. Sixty-five percent of Turkish Cypriots voted to adopt the plan. Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos stated that the resignation of Talat's government \"does not affect us\" but, \"because our constant efforts have been the resumption of talks to find a viable and acceptable settlement, we want to have a reliable interlocutor of the Turkish Cypriot side, even though the other side's interlocutor is basically Turkey and not the Turkish Cypriot leadership.\" October 22, 2004 No EU Decision on Direct Trade with Northern Cyprus This Year Washington, D.C. - The European Union’s Dutch presidency stated that the EU and the Cyprus government would need more time to formulate terms for direct trade between the bloc and northern Cyprus that they could both agree on. The debate and decision on these trade arrangements by the EU member nations would, therefore, be postponed until next year, it said. Cyprus has agreed to approve EU aid of about $320 million for northern Cyprus to help develop its infrastructure. Jean-Christophe Filori, a spokesman for European Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen, said it appeared that the financial aid “would go forward” but it would be “decoupled” from the proposal on direct trade, although the two had originally been planned as a package. The EU foreign ministers are expected to approve the aid package in November. The Cyprus government has opposed the EU’s proposal to open direct trade links with northern Cyprus, believing that such a move would amount to recognition of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus as a separate state. October 22, 2004 U.S. Surveys Safety Issues at Northern Cyprus Airport Washington, D.C. - The United States sent two working level officials from the Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) to northern Cyprus to conduct an informal survey of the security and safety features of the Ercan airport in the town of Tymbou. The survey was part of the U.S.’s inquiry into obstacles that may stand in the way of establishing air connections between northern Cyprus and countries that include the United States. Washington has made no decision on whether direct air links with northern Cyprus will be opened. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, referring to the survey, said the United States was examining “steps that can help ease the isolation of Turkish Cypriots,” adding that “one of the steps we are looking at is the status of travel.” Commenting on the visit of the TSA officials, President Tassos Papadopoulos said Cyprus would work against any move that might be harmful to the sovereignty and legal status of the Republic of Cyprus. “We have been informed about the visit, and know of Washington’s persistent efforts to open up the illegal airports in occupied Cyprus,” Papadopoulos stated. Foreign Minister George Iacovou said the Cyprus government considered the TSA’s survey to be an unnecessary move, noting that “the role of the U.S. is not to check airports and especially airports that are illegal.” October 15, 2004 Issue of Turkey's Recognition of Cyprus Under Debate Washington, D.C. - Cyprus Foreign Minister George Iacovou, addressing the EU's General Affairs Council concerning the European Commission's recommendation that Ankara's accession talks with the bloc should begin, called on Turkey to recognize the Republic of Cyprus before the December EU summit, where the question of granting Turkey a date for talks will be decided. In response, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Namik Tan stated that \"Greek Cypriots would always come up with various demands,\" as they try \"to somehow shrug off the responsibility for the failure to resolve the Cyprus conflict,\" an apparent reference to the rejection of the Annan reunification plan by the Greek Cypriots in the April referendum. Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos asserted that, although Cyprus \"is, in principle, positively predisposed\" toward the entry of Turkey into the EU and \"does not wish to prove an obstacle to this process,\" an EU candidate seeking a date for accession talks \"cannot, in good faith, refuse to extend to a member state treatment equal to that accorded to the rest of the European partners.\" The Turkish Cypriot prime minister, Mehmet Ali Talat, stated that no one expected Turkey to recognize the Republic of Cyprus before a solution to the Cyprus problem was found. At this time, he said, this recognition \"cannot and must not be mentioned.\" U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Michael Klosson said the U.S. government was ready to assist Cyprus settlement efforts, \"but proposals on next steps [toward a solution] must come from Nicosia, not foreign capitals.\" Klosson also said that he saw no \"formal linkage\" between Turkey's European Union accession course and the question of Cyprus. October 8, 2004 Annan Calls for One-Third Reduction of Peacekeeping Force Washington, D.C. - U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan recommended in a report to the Security Council that the size of the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) be reduced by one-third, from 1,230 troops to 860. The report, released on October 5, was based on the findings of a U.N. team that conducted a review of the mandate, force levels, and concept of operations of the force, at Annan's request, from August 29 to September 5. Annan said the review team had found that the security situation in Cyprus had become \"increasingly benign\" over the past few years, \"with a steady reduction in the number of incidents and violations of the ceasefire by the opposing forces.\" He said the team had concluded that \"a recurrence of fighting in Cyprus is increasingly unlikely,\" though \"the potential for minor local violence and challenges to the ceasefire regime still exists.\" As a result, he said, the emphasis of UNFICYP, the world's longest-serving peacekeeping force, sent to Cyprus in 1964, \"is moving towards liaison, observation, and mediation, rather than the deployment of forces to prevent the recurrence of fighting and to maintain the status quo.\" Since a permanent presence of the troops is no longer required in all areas, he said, \"a further shift in emphasis from static to mobile surveillance would be appropriate at this stage, resulting in savings of personnel and resources.\" This more mobile concept of operations, he noted, would allow the recommended force reduction to take place. Annan also said up to 40 military observers and liaison officers should be incorporated into the force, while the civilian police deployment would be increased and the mission's political and civil affairs component would be strengthened. He called for a six-month renewal of the force's mandate, beginning on December 15. In the absence of a Cyprus settlement, the secretary general asserted that he continued to believe \"the presence of UNFICYP. . . remains necessary for the maintenance of the ceasefire and to foster conditions conducive to a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem.\" He said the review team had found that \"this view is shared by both sides on the island, as well as by the guarantor Powers and other interested parties.\" Annan noted that, following the failed April referendum on his reunification plan, the role of UNFICYP had \"become particularly important since the mission remains the only United Nations political interface on the island.\" He said that, although political developments might require the appointment of a full-time Special Advisor at some stage, he did not intend to make such an appointment at this time. Therefore, the Chief of Mission of UNFICYP would act as Annan's \"Special Representative on the ground for continuous contact at the highest level with the two sides and other key players on the Cyprus question,\" a factor that would require the strengthening of the capacity of UNFICYP for political analysis and reporting. The secretary general said he might \"consider designating, on an ad hoc basis, senior officials of the [U.N.] Secretariat to deal with any particular aspects of my good offices that might require special attention.\" Annan stated that official contacts between the leaders of both sides in the Cyprus issue had ceased since the April referendum and \"signs of mutual distrust have reappeared.\" Although Cyprus's accession to the EU had not provided the catalyst for a Cyprus settlement, as hoped, the EU framework has the potential to improve the climate between Cyprus and Turkey, help reduce the disparities between the two communities on the island and promote confidence between them, and build and sustain constituencies on each side in favor of reconciliation and reunification, he stated. The secretary general said that the measures recommended for altering the force size and structure would \"provide the basis for a further transformation of the mission, as warranted by developments on the ground, after a further review, which should take place before the end of the next mandate period, in mid-2005.\" Cyprus Foreign Minister George Iacovou stated that it was positive that UNFICYP's mandate was being maintained, with a more efficient use of resources, even though the military component was being reduced. The Turkish Cypriot deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Serdar Denktash, said \"the reason for UNFICYP's presence in Cyprus and the description of its duties should change,\" adding that \"there should be a big difference between the initial and the current assignments [concerning the force] in light of the atmosphere that has developed.\" (Click here for report and select English to view.) October 1, 2004 U.S. Committed to Helping Find a Cyprus Settlement Washington, D.C. - Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman met with Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York to reaffirm Washington’s interest in a comprehensive settlement for the reunification of Cyprus and to hear the views of the Cyprus government on how to move forward toward this goal. Following his talks with Papadopoulos, Grossman said the United States remained \"interested and committed\" to finding a fair solution to the Cyprus problem and, \"if we can,\" to getting \"actively involved\" in this process. The U.S., Grossman said, shared Papadopoulos’s belief that the division of Cyprus should not continue and that all Cypriots should someday live together. The undersecretary stated that he thought there would be another chance, at some indefinite date, for Cypriots to debate and consider a unified Cyprus. Grossman said he did not believe that the \"shuttle diplomacy\" that preceded the April referendum on the Annan plan for the reunification of Cyprus would take place now, adding that, following the intense effort to unite the country, he believed, as did Papadopoulos, that \"people need to reflect a little bit.\" The question, Grossman said, is what does it take to make the majority of both sides vote \"yes\" on a settlement plan? The undersecretary said he disagreed with statements that the U.S. government had intended to penalize Greek Cypriots for voting \"no\" on the referendum. \"Among the things that we have never done, never intended to do . . . was to punish anybody,\" he stated, noting that Washington was \"trying to move forward\" and was attempting to do so \"in a fair and equitable way.\" Concerning the possibility that Turkey will, at the EU summit in December, be granted a date for the start of EU accession talks and the effect such an eventuality will have on the Cyprus issue, Grossman said a Turkey that was slated to begin negotiations for entry into the EU would be \"a Turkey with a European perspective,\" which should be good for Cyprus, Greece, Turkey, and the United States. Following his meetings with Grossman and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan in New York, Papadopoulos said he had reiterated the position that, by voting \"no\" on the April referendum, Greek Cypriots had not rejected the potential reunification of the country. He said Greek Cypriots \"remain firm to the position that the solution to the Cyprus problem must be found in the framework of the Annan plan for a bizonal, bicommunal federation.\" The Cyprus president added that it would not be suitable to launch a new reunification initiative until after December. September 24, 2004 Greek, Turkish Military Exercises in Cyprus Cancelled as Confidence-Building Measure Washington, D.C. - Greek Foreign Minister Petros Molyviatis and Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, following talks on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York, said Greece and Turkey would cancel annual military exercises that each had scheduled in and around Cyprus in October as a reflection of improving relations between the two countries. The military maneuvers planned in Cyprus were \"Nikiforos,\" which Greece and the Greek Cypriots conduct jointly, and \"Toros,\" which Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots carry out together. \"Toxotis\" and \"Barbaros,\" naval exercises designed to support the military operations in Cyprus, were also planned by Greece and Turkey, respectively. A joint statement by the ministers said Greece and Turkey had made the decision \"in line with good neighborly relations and as part of their determination to contribute to the existing atmosphere of confidence.\" In addition, Gul said, he and Molyviatis had decided that the bilateral process of broadening confidence-building measures between the two countries should be accelerated. He reiterated an invitation he had previously extended to Molyviatis to visit Turkey. Molyviatis said the cancellation of Greece's maneuvers, in consultation with the Cyprus government, with which Athens has a joint defense doctrine, was \"an indication of the trust\" that had developed between Athens and Ankara and \"another indication of our strong commitment to peace, to cooperation, and to friendship.\" This will be the third year that Greece and Turkey have mutually agreed to cancel all four exercises. In 2003, the two sides said the decision had been made as a sign of improved bilateral ties. In 2002, the cancellations were in support of the push by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to reach a settlement in Cyprus. In 2001, the naval maneuvers were called off in the post-September 11 environment, amid preparations for U.S.-led military operations in Afghanistan, which involved the use of facilities in both Greece and Turkey. However, the land exercises in Cyprus did go forward in October and November 2001, respectively. September 17, 2004 Cyprus Eyes Eurozone Membership by 2007 Washington, D.C. - The Cyprus cabinet approved a budget with austerity measures for 2005 designed to prepare Cyprus for entry into the single European currency by 2007. The government’s goal is to lower the deficit to 1.6 percent of GDP and the debt to 67.3 percent of GDP by 2007. Finance Minister Makis Keravnos said the budget measures, geared toward curbing public spending, would result in a 2005 deficit just under the 3 percent ceiling permitted by the EU, in contrast to a 7 percent shortfall in 2003 and a projected deficit of 5.2 percent in 2004. In 2003, the debt reached 70.9 percent of GDP, exceeding the EU’s limit of 60 percent, and is expected to increase to 75.2 percent in 2004. There will be a freeze on new public sector jobs and salaries, which comprise 60 percent of the state’s expenditures, until 2007. The retirement age for civil servants will increase from 60 to 63, while the general retirement age will be raised from 63 to 65. Without these measures, the deficit would reach 8.9 percent, according to government estimates. Keravnos said that the 2005 budget, which he characterized as “stabilizing,” would keep inflation under 3 percent, while providing funds to build roads, schools, and hospitals. The budget, providing for $7.5 billion in spending and a deficit of $1.7 billion, must be approved by parliament. September 10, 2004 Cyprus Appeals Directly to EU for Return of Varosha Washington, D.C. - Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos submitted a detailed outline to the European Commission regarding the government's proposal for the opening of the port of Famagusta in exchange for the return of the adjacent, former Greek Cypriot resort of Varosha, now a ghost town, to its legal residents. The submission of the details of the proposal was follow-up to Papadopoulos's earlier verbal presentation of the idea to European Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen. Cyprus government spokesman Kypros Chrysostomides said the operation of the port, which could function with the participation of both the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots under the supervision of the European Union, could be useful to the process of reconstructing the city of Famagusta. Turkish Cypriot prime minister Mehmet Ali Talat stated that the future of Varosha and the port of Famagusta should not be referred to the European Union and should only be addressed through a comprehensive agreement to resolve the Cyprus problem, such as that envisaged by the Annan reunification plan. The plan was endorsed by the Turkish Cypriots and rejected by the Greek Cypriots in the April 2004 referenda in both communities. The EU reportedly has reservations concerning the Cyprus government's proposal, while certain member states, including the Netherlands, which currently holds the EU presidency, do not want the proposal to be under consideration going into the months preceding the bloc's December assessment of Turkey's readiness for EU accession talks. September 3, 2004 U.N. to Review Utility of Peacekeeping Operation Washington, D.C. - United Nations experts arrived in Cyprus on August 30 to reassess the continuing mandate, troop levels, and concept of operation of the 1,200-member U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) at the request of Secretary General Kofi Annan, following the rejection of his peace plan for reunification of the country by the Greek Cypriots in the April referendum. In his May 26, 2004 report, Annan stated that the outcome of the referendum warranted an overall reappraisal of the peacekeeping activities in Cyprus, to be completed within three months. He is expected to submit any recommendations that result from the reassessment in September. UNFICYP, the world's longest-serving peacekeeping force, was sent to Cyprus in 1964 to prevent further violence between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities. In 1974, its responsibilities were expanded to include supervision of the 112-mile ceasefire line, or buffer zone. The Cyprus government, which pays $16 million of the $45 million required to maintain the force annually, is opposed to any reduction in the size of UNFICYP or change in its mandate. The Greek government covers $9 million of the force’s annual costs. The main troop contributors are Britain, Argentina, and Slovakia. Cyprus government spokesman Kypros Chrysostomides stated that the deployment of the force, as defined by the Security Council, \"seems to remain necessary\" since \"the presence of the [Turkish] occupation army continues\" in northern Cyprus. September 3, 2004 Christian Liturgies in Northern Cyprus for First Time Since 1974 Washington, D.C. - For the first time since 1974, Christian Orthodox liturgies were held in the Aghios Mamas Church in a northern Cypriot town, as up to 2,000 Greek Cypriot worshipers participated in the services and Turkish Cypriot prime minister Mehmet Ali Talat paid a brief visit to the church while a service was in progress as a gesture of good will. Amid heavy security at the church in Morphou (Guzelyurt in Turkish), 18 miles west of Nicosia, due to a bomb attack that had damaged it on August 26, Talat stated that he had come to \"say hello\" and expressed the wish that the Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots \"would succeed in their efforts for peace.\" Earlier, Talat had condemned the bomb attack, which he characterized as a \"terrorist\" attack, stating that stringent measures had been taken to prevent any problems during the liturgies. If the perpetrators \"hope to bring fear to our country, they are mistaken,\" Talat said, adding that \"no one has the right to upset our internal peace.\" No one has claimed responsibility for the blast. Some 650 Turkish Cypriot police, one-third of the entire police force in northern Cyprus, surrounded the church to ensure the safety of the pilgrims from the south as they marked Saint Mamas Day, the feast of the town's patron saint. As part of the security strategy, a military helicopter also flew over the area, fire trucks stood by, and snipers guarded the main road linking Nicosia and Morphou as the Greek Cypriot worshipers traveled north to the church. Those entering the church courtyard were searched using metal detectors. While the liturgies were in progress, a group of about 100 Turkish Cypriots held a religious ceremony in a mosque 150 feet from the church in memory of Turkish Cypriots killed in intercommunal violence in Cyprus. Both gatherings were held peacefully. Turkish Cypriot president Rauf Denktash opposed the opening of the church for the religious rites, stating that \"the arrival of thousands of Greek Cypriots [in northern Cyprus] . . . constitutes a serious provocation toward Turkish Cypriots.\" August 27, 2004 EU Framework for Intra-Island Trade Goes into Effect Washington, D.C. - Legal trade between Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot community resumed on August 23 for the first time since 1974 as the European Union rules for this commerce went into effect. This trade process fulfills Brussels' goal that the Green Line not be regarded as an EU external border. The rules, adopted by the European Commission in July, stipulate that Turkish Cypriot goods coming into the Greek Cypriot market must comply with EU standards, including those concerning food safety and plant health. In addition, the Turkish Cypriot Chamber of Commerce must certify that the products going south have originated in northern Cyprus. Live animals, animal products, animal feed, and fish will not be permitted as part of this trade across the Green Line. As soon as the legislation came into force, entrepreneurs wishing to trade goods such as fruit, vegetables, textiles, and furniture began registering their products with the Chamber of Commerce. In addition, the Turkish Cypriot leadership has decided to lift the ban on the marketing of Greek Cypriot products in northern Cyprus. Initially, it said, this trade would be limited to semi-manufactured goods and raw materials originating in the south. In mid-September, the EU Council of Ministers will resume discussions on the European Commission's proposal for direct trade between northern Cyprus and the European Union through ports in the north, as well as the Commission's $320 million EU financial assistance package for the Turkish Cypriots. The Council must approve the proposals for them to go into effect. Although the Turkish Cypriots seek direct trade with the European Union for Turkish Cypriot products, the Cyprus government opposes it. In a separate development, Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos stated that Cyprus did not wish to veto Turkey's accession to the European Union as long as Turkey accepts the conditions and regulations of the acquis communautaire, or body of EU laws, and \"as long as it does not use policies and tactics which perpetuate divisive tendencies in Cyprus, as has been going on recently.\" Papadopoulos said he did not think anyone could expect Cyprus \"to sit back passively . . . without having the right to ask for a connection between a Cyprus problem solution and Turkey's EU accession prospects.\" \"We wish to see Turkey's stance help itself, so that we help, rather than hinder its EU accession,\" Papadopoulos added. Rauf Denktash, the president of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), announced that he would not stand for re-election when elections are held in April 2005. Denktash has held the position since 1983, when the TRNC, recognized only by Turkey, was unilaterally declared. August 13, 2004 Turkish Cypriot Politician Travels Via Larnaca Airport for First Time Washington, D.C. - Mustafa Akinci, the leader of the opposition Peace and Democracy Movement in the Turkish Cypriot parliament, departed from Cyprus for the opening ceremony of the Athens Olympics through the internationally recognized Larnaca Airport in the south. His action marked the first time a Turkish Cypriot politician had flown out of Cyprus from the south instead of departing from an airport in the north. Akinci stated that, by traveling via Larnaca on August 12, he wanted \"to send a message of peace that Greek and Turkish Cypriots should find a solution to the Cyprus problem on their own.\" Traveling to Athens on a Turkish passport, Akinci attended the Olympic ceremony at the invitation of the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization (OTE), one of the major sponsors of the games. On August 6, George Vasiliou, the former president of Cyprus and the current head of the Greek Cypriot United Democrats Party (EDI), met with Turkish Cypriot prime minister Mehmet Ali Talat and members of his Republican Turkish Party in northern Nicosia to discuss ways to increase contacts between both communities. They agreed that a solution to the Cyprus problem should be found as soon as possible. The meeting occurred a week after meetings were held between Talat and Nicos Anastasiades, the leader of the opposition, right-wing, Greek Cypriot Democratic Rally party (DISY), and between Akinci and Anastasiades, which resulted in agreements to establish joint committees between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot parties to discuss the Cyprus problem. August 6, 2004 Greek Cypriots Facilitate Trade, Travel Between North and South Washington, D.C. - The Cyprus government, on July 30, announced a series of measures aimed at promoting economic and trade relations between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots by facilitating the sale of Turkish Cypriot products in the south and the passage of Turkish Cypriot trucks, buses, and taxis across the Green Line. The proposals have been submitted to the European Commission for approval and are designed to further the implementation of the measure adopted by the EU Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers on April 29, the so-called Green Line Regulation, governing intra-island trade. The proposals eliminate Greek Cypriot middlemen who currently handle the transport of Turkish Cypriot goods to the south, allowing Turkish Cypriots to carry their products into the south and trade directly with Greek Cypriots. They include exempting a Turkish Cypriot from having to register in the Value Added Tax (VAT) system or pay VAT if he or she sells less than $20,000 worth of goods directly to Greek Cypriot consumers annually. If sales remain within this limit, the tax will be paid by the Greek Cypriot buyer of the goods or services. Turkish Cypriots will be required to pay VAT only if the value of the merchandise they plan to sell in the south exceeds $20,000 annually. Turkish Cypriot consumers will not have to pay VAT on Greek Cypriot goods or EU imports making their way into the north from the south. Cyprus government authorities will also make it easier for Turkish Cypriots to export their goods to Europe through the southern ports of Larnaca and Limassol. Another proposal exempts goods produced in the north from duties or surcharges when they cross the Green Line and treats the products as if they originated in the European Union, enabling their export to the rest of the EU. To encourage the transport of goods and passengers by Turkish Cypriot-owned trucks, tourist buses, and taxis back and forth across the Green Line, the Cyprus government proposed the granting of temporary driver's licenses to Turkish Cypriots, circulation licenses for their vehicles, and roadworthiness certificates, which will be valid for one year at no charge. The operators of Turkish Cypriot tourist buses will be required to bring passengers they transport to the south back to the north, following their participation in a tour, excursion, or conference in the south. Mehmet Ali Talat, the Turkish Cypriot prime minister, stated that measures enhancing trade and travel across the Green Line had been sought by the Turkish Cypriots since the Line was opened to two-way crossings in April 2003. Although the Greek Cypriot measures fell \"far short of what was expected,\" Talat stated, the Turkish Cypriots \"are not in a position to reject them.\" Talat was critical of the fact that rental cars registered in the north would not be able to travel south, while Turkish Cypriot buses would not be able to pick up tourists arriving in the south and take them to hotels in the north. He also said the measures did not adequately facilitate the sale of products in the south by Turkish Cypriot entrepreneurs. Adriaan van der Meer, the European Commission's representative in Nicosia, said the European Union welcomed any initiative that will bring the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities together. The Commission, on August 4, released $3 million for clearing thousands of land mines in the 110-mile buffer zone in Cyprus. The de-mining operations, which can begin in September, are expected to initially focus on the area in and around Nicosia, and will make possible the opening of new crossing points along the Green Line, now numbering four. The destruction of the mines will be coordinated by a Mine Action Cell to be established in the U.N. Protected Area in Nicosia. On July 31, Nicos Anastasiades, the leader of the opposition, right-wing, Greek Cypriot Democratic Rally party (DISY), and Talat met in northern Nicosia at the office of Talat's Republican Turkish Party to discuss ways to promote a reunification settlement. The two parties will establish a joint committee to work on the Cyprus problem, having agreed that it was necessary to reach a settlement as soon as possible. Following another meeting in northern Nicosia, Anastasiades and Mustafa Akinci, the Turkish Cypriot leader of the Peace and Democracy Movement, also agreed to form a joint committee to examine issues concerning the Cyprus problem. July 30, 2004 EU Vote on Aid, Direct Trade for Turkish Cypriots in Autumn Washington, D.C. - The European Union decided that the vote of the EU Council of Ministers on the European Commission's $320 million aid package for the Turkish Cypriots will take place in September, followed by an October debate and vote on the Commission's measures for direct trade with northern Cyprus. Cyprus Foreign Minister George Iacovou said the decision to wait until the fall to vote on the measures \"opens a window of opportunity for the Republic of Cyprus to start consultations with European governments\" concerning them. Although the Cyprus government supports the proposal to award the aid package to the Turkish Cypriots, it regards the measures providing for direct trade between the EU and northern Cyprus to be \"unsound on both political and legal grounds,\" according to Iacovou. Nicosia insists that Turkish Cypriot products should exit Cyprus through the internationally recognized ports and airports in the south, asserting that direct trade with the north implies de facto recognition of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. A representative of the European Commission's Legal Service said there were legal problems associated with the measures concerning direct trade with northern Cyprus since they were based on Article 133, dealing with EU trade with third countries, of the Treaty establishing the European Community. Northern Cyprus, the representative said, could not be considered a third country. Iacovou stated that the Cyprus government was satisfied with this interpretation, having previously asserted that the whole of Cyprus joined the EU on May 1, despite the fact that the acquis communautaire, or body of EU laws, was suspended in the north upon accession. A statement by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said, \"Turkey attaches great importance to the swift entry into force of the [EU] draft regulations [on direct trade and financial aid] without any amendments.\" Iacovou, on July 26, announced a series of Cyprus government initiatives aimed at easing trade and travel across the Green Line. The initiatives included allowing Turkish Cypriots to drive their trucks, tourist buses, and taxis across the Line and into the south loaded with products or passengers. In response to statements by Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos that he was ready to re-negotiate the Annan plan in an attempt to achieve a reunification settlement, the Turkish Cypriot foreign ministry issued a statement asserting that the Annan plan \"is not open for changes and, as such, the process has been completed.\" The statement added, \"As a result, our side cannot accept any attempt aimed at changing the plan, be it by Mr. Papadopoulos or any other third party.\" July 23, 2004 Cyprus Government Proposes Confidence-Building Measures Washington, D.C. - The Cyprus government on July 16 proposed a series of confidence-building measures it said would provide the necessary basis for the establishment of conditions to promote security and trust among Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos said the measures needed to be implemented until a settlement is reached to reunify the country. The president said the Cyprus government \"urgently\" wanted to achieve a settlement and was working toward reunification on the basis of a \"bizonal, bicommunal, and functional federation, which the Annan plan can offer with the appropriate improvements to it.\" One of the confidence-building proposals is the withdrawal of up to 2,000 Greek Cypriot National Guardsmen from the U.N.-guarded Green Line, or buffer zone, if Turkey matches the offer by pulling the same number of its troops back from the Line. Other proposals include establishing a military-free area 1.2 miles wide on both sides of the Line, where military exercises would be halted as a result of the pullback of forces; the de-mining of both sides of the buffer zone; the opening of eight new crossings through the zone to encourage expanded trade and travel; and the withdrawal of troops from the old walled city of Nicosia and from areas in eastern Cyprus such as Famagusta and Strovilia. In addition, the government offered to open the port of Famagusta to international trade if the Turkish Cypriots agree to cede control of the adjacent town of Varosha to the Greek Cypriots. It also proposed that the port be turned over to the control of the European Union, while a joint Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot committee would be formed to run it. Cyprus government spokesman Kypros Chrysostomides said Nicosia had submitted a request to the European Commission on June 30 for the return of Varosha to Greek Cypriot property owners. Varosha, a former Greek Cypriot resort town, has been uninhabited since 1974. Chrysostomides stated that establishing security and trust among the two communities in Cyprus \"contributes to the efforts for a political settlement of the Cyprus problem\" and \"strengthens the prospect for the viability of the solution\" that will be achieved. Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Namik Tan dismissed the confidence-building measures, referring to them as an attempt to block efforts by Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots to end the economic isolation of northern Cyprus, rather than a move toward improving security. Tan said the proposals also constituted an effort to change the direction of the international community’s discussions on the future of Cyprus. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan stated that Turkey would not cede control of Varosha to the Greek Cypriots. The Turkish Cypriot prime minister, Mehmet Ali Talat, stated that the results sought by the Greek Cypriots through the proposed measures would have been achieved if they had voted in favor of the adoption of the Annan plan in the April 24 referendum on the plan. He also announced on June 18 that the Turkish Cypriots would open an additional crossing point along the Green Line to facilitate trade in agricultural products. Talat said more crossing points could be opened if demand warranted them. The United Nations welcomed the announcement of the measures and said it remained committed to facilitating all confidence-building measures proposed. Jean Christophe-Filore, a spokesman for European Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen, stated that the Commission welcomed any measures that could establish a climate of confidence among Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. According to U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, Washington would welcome any mutually agreed upon steps that could reduce military tensions in Cyprus and was always looking for ways to provide both communities in the country \"with a greater sense of security.\" Boucher noted that the U.S. has been urging all parties involved in the Cyprus issue to refrain from military exercises in the fall, as they have for several years, adding that military confidence-building measures were no substitute for a comprehensive political settlement in the form of the Annan plan. Such measures \"don’t fully address the general security concerns the Greek Cypriots have expressed, nor do they address the economic aspirations that are so central for the Turkish Cypriots,\" Boucher stated. In a separate development, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul called on Turkish businessmen to market their goods in the \"Greek Cypriot sector\" of Cyprus. \"This will not mean, however, that we officially recognize the Greek Cypriot sector. We want to have free trade,\" Gul said. July 23, 2004 Assistant Secretary of State Assumes Duties of Special Cyprus Coordinator Washington, D.C. - Laura Kennedy, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, has assumed the responsibilities of the State Department's Special Coordinator for Cyprus, a position held since 1999 by Thomas Weston, who is stepping down in August to teach at Georgetown University. The Special Cyprus Coordinator position has not been abolished. On her first trip to the region in this capacity the week of July 19, Kennedy held talks with both Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot officials on efforts to solve the Cyprus problem and the details of the $30 million financial aid package Washington is planning to give to the Turkish Cypriots. In Turkey, Kennedy met with Deputy Undersecretary of the Foreign Ministry Ali Tuygan and officials from the Turkish General Staff to discuss Cyprus, Iraq, and issues concerning the Caucasus, the fight against terrorism, and Turkey's bid to join the European Union. The relevant officials in Greece were not available to meet with Kennedy during this trip but will be consulted by her in the future. July 16, 2004 U.S. Grants Economic Aid to Turkish Cypriots Washington, D.C. - The United States will give the Turkish Cypriots $30 million in aid in 2004 to ease their economic isolation and reward them for voting in favor of the Annan reunification plan in the April 24 referendum in Cyprus. The aid will include measures to promote the restructuring of the financial sector, the strengthening of small- and medium-sized enterprises, and the continuation of bicommunal activities to encourage reconciliation. The announcement concerning the U.S. aid was made on July 9, two days after the European Commission stated that it was proposing a $320 million aid package for northern Cyprus over the next three years, along with measures that would open up direct trade between the Turkish Cypriots and the European Union. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that the U.S. funding was aimed at \"the economic development of northern Cyprus and the economic integration of the island in support of eventual reunification.\" The U.S. hopes that the economic progress envisioned will enable the Turkish Cypriots to assume their share of the costs associated with an eventual reunification settlement and help them bring their economy in line with European Union standards. Boucher added that the U.S. had been reviewing its policies concerning northern Cyprus so that they would \"be compatible with the moves of the European Union, always in cooperation and coordination with it.\" He said Washington looked forward to the implementation of the EU aid package and the measures promoting direct trade with northern Cyprus, following approval of them by the EU Council of Ministers, because they \"can help support eventually the reunification of the island.\" Cyprus Foreign Minister George Iacovou, in Brussels to attend a meeting of the EU General Affairs Council, urged his fellow EU ministers to delay for six months their vote on the Commission's measures allowing direct trade with the Turkish Cypriots. He said this would allow time to ascertain whether the export of Turkish Cypriot goods through the internationally recognized ports and airports in the south of Cyprus could be achieved on the basis of intra-island trade rules proposed by the Commission, which the Cyprus government was ready to help implement. Iacovou stated that the Cyprus government was in favor of granting the $320 million aid package to the Turkish Cypriots, on condition that some changes are made in the package. He suggested, however, that, if the vote on direct trade is not delayed, the government could cast a vote against the aid package. A vote against the direct trade measures by Cyprus, which regards them as contributing to the de facto recognition of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, would not block their implementation since only a qualified majority is required to approve them. However, a \"no\" vote on the aid package by Cyprus would prevent its implementation since unanimous approval of it by the EU Council of Ministers is required. Iacovou stated that there were \"substantial problems\" regarding allowing direct trade between northern Cyprus and the EU because this trade \"is based on false political assumptions and on unsound law.\" Foreign Minister Ben Bot of the Netherlands, which holds the rotating EU presidency through December, stated on July 12 that the vote by the EU Council of Ministers on the European Commission's proposals would probably be delayed until the next EU General Affairs Council meeting on September 13-14. Bot noted that the measures must first be approved by the permanent representatives of EU members (COREPER), who will convene until August. July 10, 2004 EU Announces Measures for Economic Aid, Trade with Northern Cyprus Washington, D.C. - The European Commission announced measures that will provide a three-year $320 million aid package for northern Cyprus, allow the Turkish Cypriots to trade directly with European Union countries, and define regulations for goods crossing the Green Line within Cyprus. The EU Council of Ministers will have to approve the measures for them to go into effect. Adoption of the direct trade measure requires approval by a qualified majority of EU member states, while a unanimous vote of all 25 members will be needed to adopt the aid package. European Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen stated that the aim of the measures, announced on July 7, was to \"bring the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community to an end.\" He asserted that, through the measures, which would \"build new bridges between the two communities\" in Cyprus, the Commission sought \"to contribute to the solution of the Cyprus conflict and finally to bring about the reunification of the island.\" Verheugen added that eliminating the wide economic disparities between the two communities was a precondition for a political settlement. He said there was no risk that the measures would lead, directly or indirectly, to the recognition of the breakaway entity in northern Cyprus, noting that the Commission \"has not the slightest interest in seeing a mini-Turkish state\" in the north. In allocating the economic aid, previously earmarked for the Turkish Cypriots in the event of a reunification settlement, the Commission would target the development of the north, Verheugen said, although it would seek to fund projects that benefited both Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots. The projects include making Turkish Cypriot legislation compatible with EU law, establishing social programs, and improving infrastructure. The Commission proposes the release of $7.5 million this year, $141.3 million in 2005, and $172.2 million in 2006. The measures envision the reopening of ports in northern Cyprus, closed to international commerce since 1974, to facilitate the direct import of Turkish Cypriot products by the EU. In addition, the Turkish Cypriot Chamber of Commerce will be authorized to issue documents for the products, particularly agricultural produce, to certify that they have originated in northern Cyprus. Turkish Cypriot goods will enter the EU under a quota system that will \"encourage economic development, while avoiding the creation of artificial trade patterns or facilitating fraud,\" according to the Commission. Verheugen stated that the European Commission was not entitled to make a decision concerning the issue of direct flights to northern Cyprus, adding that it would be up to the individual EU member countries to determine whether they would initiate direct travel to the region. Turkey, the sole country that recognizes the TRNC, is the only nation that currently provides direct air links into northern Cyprus. The commissioner said that, because the acquis communautaire, or body of EU laws, had been suspended in northern Cyprus when Cyprus joined the EU on May 1, this part of the country had to be treated as a \"third country,\" a move that the European Union considered normal trade policy. Cyprus government spokesman Kypros Chrysostomides said the Cyprus government did not agree with the Commission's decision to base its proposal for direct trade on Article 133 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, asserting that the article refers to \"third countries\" that are not members of the European Union. According to the treaty of accession admitting Cyprus to the EU, Chrysostomides said, all of the territory of Cyprus had acceded to the bloc, so the government did not consider Article 133 to be applicable to the EU's policy on trade with northern Cyprus. The government spokesman also said the EU, with respect to northern Cyprus, could not \"determine the ports or airports, or entry or exit points, without the consent of the lawful government of the Republic [of Cyprus].\" During the discussions of the committee of permanent representatives of EU members (COREPER) and the EU Council of Ministers regarding the Commission's measures, Chrysostomides stated, the Cyprus government \"will make every effort and use all diplomatic means to avert measures that reinforce secessionist tendencies and the consolidation of division\" in Cyprus. He added that \"a referral of these measures to the Commission's Legal Service, as well as a postponement [of their adoption], will be requested.\" Chrysostomides also stated that the government had \"at its disposal the procedures of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg\" and \"all the details of the proposed measures, if they are finally adopted by the European Council, will be discussed before the Court.\" Nicosia opposes the reopening of Turkish Cypriot ports, maintaining that such a move would confer de facto recognition on the north, while also fostering further division of the country, and has sought the export of Turkish Cypriot goods through internationally recognized ports in the south. Chrysostomides stated that the government agreed with the measures for the economic support and upgrading of the Turkish Cypriot community, \"but they should be measures that aim at the economic integration of the two communities and serve the final objective of reunification.\" The Commission's proposals, he said, \"contain positive elements to that effect, but they also contain elements that imply and promote secessionist tendencies.\" Cyprus Foreign Minister George Iacovou said he believed that the regulation concerning direct trade with the Turkish Cypriots was \"not necessary\" and satisfied Turkish demands \"for clearly political reasons.\" He added that Brussels should have \"given a certain period of time\" to allow the provision on intra-island trade across the Green Line to take effect, noting that regulations were already in place for Turkish Cypriot goods to be exported through Greek Cypriot ports. Chrysostomides mentioned the fact that Verheugen had described as \"interesting\" a proposal by Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos for the reopening of the port of Famagusta to international trade, which would involve joint operation of the port by both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. The proposal was presented to the commissioner by Papadopoulos the week of June 28. Chrysostomides also said the government would announce a series of administrative measures aimed at facilitating the implementation of economic measures for the Turkish Cypriots, including some demilitarization within the walls of old Nicosia, as well as a reduction of arms and de-mining along the buffer zone. Mehmet Ali Talat, the prime minister of the TRNC, referred to the European Commission's measures as \"a step forward,\" noting that they implemented \"a kind of customs union between the TRNC and the EU.\" He called for the initiation of direct air links with northern Cyprus. Returning from talks in London with British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and Secretary for European Affairs Dennis McShane, Talat urged Britain, as one of the guarantor powers for Cyprus, to begin these direct flights. The Turkish Foreign Ministry, in a statement, said the Commission's package of measures \"was an important step in the process of putting into practice the political will that was put forward during the meeting of the EU foreign ministers on April 26, 2004, to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots.\" The statement called on the EU to take further steps and \"create the necessary conditions, especially in the transport sector, as soon as possible to implement provisions of the package.\" Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul stated that there was \"still much work to do\" toward easing Turkish Cypriot isolation. Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Yiorgos Koumoutsakos said Greece welcomed the proposed $320 million in economic aid to northern Cyprus but believed that the Commission's measures had \"negative aspects,\" particularly the \"procedures to establish direct contacts\" between the EU and the Turkish Cypriots. July 10, 2004 Olympic Flame Relay Cancelled in Northern Cyprus Washington, D.C. - Plans to have the Olympic flame pass through northern Cyprus have been cancelled following a lack of agreement between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots over the details of the ceremonies accompanying the flame relay. Mehmet Ali Talat, the Turkish Cypriot prime minister, said the passage of the flame into the north had fallen through because of a dispute concerning whether the Turkish Cypriots would be allowed to hold a welcoming ceremony for the runners that matched the one planned by the Greek Cypriots. Talat said lengthy discussions had been conducted concerning \"whether or not this violates the principle of equality between the two communities.\" The Turkish Cypriot sports minister, Ozkan Yorgancioglu, said the conditions set by the Greek Cypriots included no ceremony in the north and no speech by the mayor of the Turkish Cypriot section of Nicosia. Kikis Lazarides, the head of the Cyprus Olympic Committee (COC) said, \"There have been some differences [of opinion] and there has not been an understanding with the Turkish Cypriots\" concerning the relay. The COC, in conjunction with the Athens 2004 Olympic Games Organizing Committee, had given the go-ahead for the flame to pass through northern Cyprus during its stop on the island July 8, the last leg of its 27-nation journey before it returned the next day to Greece, in preparation for the opening of the Olympics on August 13. The two organizations had initially announced that the flame would be carried by Turkish Cypriot runners in northern Cyprus in keeping with the spirit of the flame relay's motto, \"Our flame unites the world.\" The Cyprus government had said its only stipulations were that Turkish Cypriot authorities waive passport requirements for runners and their entourage at checkpoints along the Green Line. The flame was carried through Istanbul, Turkey, and Sofia, Bulgaria, before arriving in Cyprus. July 2, 2004 Cyprus Rejects Reported EU Plans for Direct Trade and Travel Links with Turkish Cypriots Washington, D.C. - Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos termed a draft package of European Union measures that will reportedly open direct trade and travel links with northern Cyprus as \"unacceptable,\" maintaining that such measures would contradict EU rules and regulations. On July 7, the EU is due to vote on the package, which is still under discussion and is designed to ease the economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriots. Papadopoulos said the Cyprus government, which views the measures as contributing to the consolidation of the division of the island, would work with the EU in an attempt to find ways to boost the Turkish Cypriot economy without violating international laws and EU regulations. Without the consent of the Cyprus government, Papadopoulos stated, \"it would be very difficult to see ports and airports in occupied Cyprus operate legally.\" As a last resort, he said, his government could file a complaint with the European Court of Justice with regard to the EU measures. Mehmet Ali Talat, the prime minister of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, rejected proposals by the Cyprus government to partially demilitarize the buffer zone and open 11 new crossing points along the Green Line. The Greek Cypriots proposed a ban on military maneuvers within two miles of the buffer zone and the removal of land mines in the area. Talat said the proposals constituted \"a pointless attempt to raise issues that are not currently under discussion,\" asserting that there were other matters that needed to be resolved first, such as easing the international isolation of the Turkish Cypriots. Papadopoulos called on the European Union to become involved in efforts to achieve a Cyprus settlement, in cooperation with the United Nations. Both the EU and the U.N. have said that they have no immediate plans to undertake initiatives to reunify Cyprus. June 18, 2004 U.S. Loosens Travel Restrictions for Government, Military Personnel to North Washington, D.C. - Washington has authorized the travel of U.S. government and military personnel directly into northern Cyprus, a radical departure from past policy that forbade direct travel into the region north of the Green Line by such personnel under any circumstances and limited their entry into the area to crossing over the line from the south. Whether the reason for the travel is official business or tourism, these individuals are to use only their tourist passports, not their diplomatic passports, upon direct entry into the north, a reflection of the fact that the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) is not recognized by the United States. U.S. government and military personnel who cross the Green Line from the south to the north present their diplomatic passports at the line as a form of identification. If U.S. officials or officers are going directly to northern Cyprus for official business, they must receive approval from the U.S. Embassy in Nicosia before they fly or take a boat to northern Cyprus. If the purpose of their direct travel is tourism, they do not need to notify the embassy to receive clearance. U.S. government and military employees have been made aware that attempting to travel south across the Green Line after entering the north directly could lead to problems with the Greek Cypriot authorities. The new travel provision concerning northern Cyprus is expected to be especially attractive to the 1,100 U.S. military personnel stationed at Incirlik Air Base in southeastern Turkey for vacation purposes, since Turkey, the sole nation that recognizes the TRNC, is the only country providing direct flights into the north. Private U.S. citizens have never been restricted from traveling directly into northern Cyprus and may continue to do so. On June 9, State Department Special Coordinator for Cyprus Thomas Weston visited the representative of the TRNC in New York, Resat Caglar, in his office at Turkey's permanent mission to the United Nations. In the past, Weston has sought a neutral venue for his meetings with Caglar. On June 17, he visited the TRNC representative in Washington, Osman Ertug, in the latter's office, a departure from his previous practice of meeting with Ertug at a neutral venue or in Weston's own office at the State Department. Following his meeting with Ertug, Weston stated that his visit to Ertug's office was part of the approach the United States is taking to end the international isolation of the Turkish Cypriots. He said the U.S. would do its best to contribute to the economy of northern Cyprus in order to bring it to a level similar to that of the Greek Cypriots. June 18, 2004 U.N. Approves Extension of UNFICYP Mandate, Awaits Annan Review of Force Washington, D.C. - The U.N. Security Council, on June 11, renewed the mandate of the 1,200-member United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) for another six months, from June 15 to December 15, 2004, on the recommendation of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who said the absence of a settlement made the presence of the force \"necessary for the maintenance of the ceasefire.\" The move was in keeping with the Council's longstanding pattern of renewing the force's mandate twice a year, following reports on its operation and recommendations for renewal by the secretary general. However, in a departure from past practice, Annan, in a report to the Security Council released June 3, stated that he would conduct a review, to be completed within three months, of \"UNFICYP's mandate, force levels, and concept of operations\" in view of the failed April 24 referendum on the Annan settlement plan and as part of an overall reappraisal of the U.N.'s peacekeeping activities in Cyprus. On June 11, the Security Council said it welcomed Annan's intention to conduct such a review. It also stated that it would consider the recommendations he was planning to submit to the Council and would act upon his proposals \"within one month of receiving them.\" This action by the Council would, therefore, be expected in October. June 18, 2004 Party Loyalties Remain Generally Static in European Parliament Elections Washington, D.C. - The results of Cyprus's first European Parliament elections, following the country's entry into the European Union on May 1, basically reaffirmed the party loyalties of the Greek Cypriot electorate exhibited in the parliamentary elections of May 2001. In the June 10-13 Euroelections, the main opposition, right-wing Democratic Rally Party (DISY), the party of former Cyprus president Glafcos Clerides, now led by Nicos Anastasiades, received 28.2 percent of the vote. AKEL, the Eurocommunist party and the largest party in Cyprus, headed by Dimitris Christofias, came in second with 27.9 percent. Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos's center-right Democratic Party (DIKO) came in third with 17.1 percent. AKEL and DISY won two seats each, while DIKO and the \"For Europe\" party each won a seat. For Europe is comprised of lawmakers who broke away from DISY in protest over its support for the Annan plan in the failed April 24 referendum. In the May 2001 elections for the Cyprus House of Representatives, AKEL garnered 34.7 percent of the vote, taking 20 seats, while DISY won 34.0 percent, taking 19 seats. DIKO received 14.8 percent, giving it 9 seats in the 56-seat body. In the February 2003 presidential election, Papadopoulos was supported by a broad coalition of parties ranging from his own Democratic Party to AKEL. Only 97 of the 503 Turkish Cypriots registered to vote in the European Parliament elections, taking place only in the south, crossed the Green Line to take part. There was only one Turkish Cypriot candidate, Istanbul University professor Mehmet Hasan, an independent. The Turkish Cypriots were able to vote for either this candidate or any of the Greek Cypriot candidates, just as the Greek Cypriots were. Mehmet Ali Talat, the prime minister of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, said that two of Cyprus's six seats in the European Parliament should remain empty if two Turkish Cypriots are not elected to these seats. He also said that, in the absence of reserving two seats for Turkish Cypriots, he wanted two Turkish Cypriots to be included in the European Parliament as observers. June 4, 2004 Papadopoulos Rebuts Annan Report Washington, D.C. - Responding to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's report on the reunification negotiations leading up to the failed April 24 referendum, Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos strongly opposed the secretary general's urging that the Security Council \"give a strong lead to all states to cooperate both bilaterally and in international bodies to eliminate unnecessary restrictions and barriers that have the effect of isolating the Turkish Cypriots.\" The submission of the June 7 letter, which will circulate as an official U.N. document, occurred as the discussion opened in the Security Council on the Annan report, released on June 3. The Council has until June 15 to adopt a decision on the report. Papadopoulos asserted that Annan's suggestion regarding international cooperation with the Turkish Cypriots lay outside the secretary general's good offices mission concerning the Cyprus negotiations, was \"in direct contravention\" of the Security Council's resolutions and international law, and would lead to \"the upgrading of and creeping or overt recognition of this secessionist entity,\" a reference to the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The president said the welfare and prosperity of the people of Cyprus lay in the economic integration of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities and the unification of their economies. He noted that the Cyprus government had implemented two packages of measures in April that had promoted intra-island trade and the export of Turkish Cypriot goods through its legal seaports and airports. The Turkish Cypriots, he stated, were not making use of these measures. Papadopoulos welcomed Annan's recognition of the fact that serious concerns of the Greek Cypriot community, particularly those regarding security were, as Papadopoulos stated, \"to a great extent, ignored.\" The concerns involved primarily the Greek Cypriots' opposition to the provision interpreted as allowing all Turkish settlers to remain in Cyprus, with the possibility that there would be a permanent flow of these settlers into the country; the permanent stationing of downsized Turkish military forces in Cyprus, even after Turkey's eventual accession to the European Union; and the expansion of the rights of the guarantor powers provided by the Treaty of Guarantee, giving Turkey the right to intervene militarily in the Greek Cypriot component state. Papadopoulos emphasized that Annan had erred in assuming that the Greek Cypriots' rejection of the specific version of the Annan plan voted on during the referendum constituted a vote against the reunification of Cyprus and against an eventual solution based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation. The president maintained that provisions in the Annan plan \"clearly serving Turkish interests and aims in Cyprus\" explain to a large extent why the plan was overwhelmingly rejected by the Greek Cypriots, approved by the Turkish Cypriot side, and \"so emphatically endorsed by the Turkish government.\" These provisions, he said, included divisive bizonality provisions, strategic economic benefits, and \"sufficient troops, even if reduced in numbers, to allow [Turkey] again to intervene militarily through a bridgehead in Cyprus, a right Turkey still insists she enjoys.\" The main objection of the Greek Cypriot community to the plan, Papadopoulos stated, \"was the fact that foreign interests, primarily Turkish ones, were satisfied, instead of those of the Cypriot population, Greek and Turkish Cypriots alike.\" He asserted that the two benefits in the plan for Greek Cypriots, territorial adjustments and reductions in the size of the Turkish army contingent in Cyprus, would have taken a number of years to be phased in, making the implementation of the plan contingent on Turkey's good will, rather than on \"concrete and ironclad guarantees.\" Papadopoulos stated that Greek Cypriots also had serious doubts concerning whether the final Annan plan, the fifth version, was compatible with the acquis communautaire, the EU's body of laws, asserting that the European Commission had only examined and approved the first version of the plan. Papadopoulos stated that the ability of Cyprus to function effectively within the EU as a member state would not have been achieved by the version of the Annan plan put to a referendum. June 11, 2004 U.N. Calls on Greek Cypriots to Outline Future Course for Cyprus Reunification Washington, D.C. - During a briefing accompanying the Security Council's discussion of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's report on the settlement negotiations, the secretary general's special advisor for Cyprus, Alvaro de Soto, stated that it was necessary for the U.N. to better understand \"how the Greek Cypriot side sees the way forward\" toward the eventual goal of reunification and why 76 percent of Greek Cypriots voted \"no\" on the Annan plan in the April 24 referendum. De Soto stated that the U.N. needed to know \"if questions of security and implementation were, indeed, the main concern, and, if so, what can be done by the Security Council to address them.\" He noted that the secretary general had encouraged the Council to \"stand ready to do so if those concerns can be articulated with clarity and finality.\" Throughout the U.N. negotiation effort, which began in late 1999, the goal was to bring about a settlement \"through a decision of the people on each side,\" de Soto stated. Now that a decision has been made, he said, it \"must be respected.\" Annan's envoy pointed out that a great deal had been achieved through the negotiation process. He called for building on these achievements, in addition to \"a number of elements put in place, to keep alive the prospects for reconciliation and reunification.\" He acknowledged the \"extensive and consistent\" efforts of many Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots to reunify Cyprus, noting that they \"have to continue.\" De Soto welcomed the Turkish Cypriots' approval of the Annan plan in the referendum as \"more than a mere expression of goodwill for a solution to the Cyprus problem.\" The Turkish Cypriot people \"have clearly backed away from their search for separate sovereign statehood,\" de Soto asserted, adding that this was \"a fundamental turnabout in the direction taken by the Turkish Cypriot side for over two decades.\" June 4, 2004 Annan Urges Easing of Turkish Cypriot Isolation, Criticizes Greek Cypriot Campaign to Defeat Settlement Plan Washington, D.C. - U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, in a report to the U.N. Security Council on the Cyprus settlement negotiations over the year leading up to the failed April 24 referendum, urged the global community to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots, who, he said, had \"clearly and convincingly come out in favor of the reunification of Cyprus in a bicommunal, bizonal federation\" through their decision to vote \"yes\" on the Annan plan. The decision of the Turkish Cypriots to support the plan \"has undone whatever rationale might have existed for pressuring and isolating\" them, Annan stated in the report, released on June 2. \"I would hope the members of the Council can give a strong lead to all states to cooperate both bilaterally and in international bodies to eliminate unnecessary restrictions and barriers that have the effect of isolating the Turkish Cypriots and impeding their development, not for the purposes of affording recognition or assisting secession, but as a positive contribution to the goal of reunification,\" he stated. The secretary general said he wanted to express his \"appreciation of the efforts of Mr. [Mehmet Ali] Talat,\" the prime minister of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus who campaigned for a \"yes\" vote on the referendum, \"both in the [negotiating] process and in the run-up to the referendum.\" Annan also said he \"appreciated the strong support of the Turkish government\" for his efforts to reach a settlement, noting that Ankara's change of policy under the leadership of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan had \"enabled this new [settlement] effort to take off.\" Referring to Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos's April 7 speech, in which the Cyprus head of state called on Greek Cypriots to reject the Annan plan in the referendum, the secretary general said he did \"not believe the speech accurately reflected the contents of the plan on a range of issues.\" Annan also maintained that he did not accept the president's argument in the speech that \"Turkey's concerns were satisfied and Greek Cypriot concerns largely ignored\" in the plan. Annan said it \"might have been possible to accommodate other Greek Cypriot concerns had the Greek Cypriot side been more willing to engage in give and take\" at the negotiations in Burgenstock, Switzerland, and in earlier talks. He also criticized the Greek Cypriot side for failing to \"prioritize its objectives.\" The secretary general said he \"was surprised\" that Papadopoulos's speech had warned Greek Cypriots against \"doing away with our internationally recognized state exactly at the very moment it strengthens its political weight, with its accession to the European Union,\" in light of \"what Mr. Papadopoulos had said to me in Brussels in January 2004.\" Annan said it was \"regrettable\" that \"little was done by some participants in the negotiations to prepare the people for a compromise,\" adding that \"the opportunity for frank and constructive negotiations was not fully utilized.\" He said he had \"concerns regarding the way in which the plan was presented to the public, particularly on one side.\" If the Greek Cypriots remain willing to resolve the Cyprus problem through a bicommunal, bizonal federation, \"this needs to be demonstrated, not just by word, but by action,\" the secretary general stated. \"Lingering Greek Cypriot concerns about security and implementation of the plan need to be articulated with clarity and finality,\" he asserted, noting that the Security Council \"would be well advised to stand ready to address such concerns.\" The secretary general said Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis \"had declared his view that the benefits of the plan outweighed the difficulties in it, and that the difficulties could be ironed out as Cyprus acceded to the European Union.\" Annan added that he had \"always been able to count on Greece's support\" for his efforts toward the reunification of Cyprus. Annan said he did not \"see any basis\" for resuming the U.N.'s efforts to reach a settlement in Cyprus \"as long as this stand-off remains.\" He maintained, however, that, \"while the plan is legally null and void in the aftermath of the referendum, its acceptance by the Turkish Cypriot electorate means that the shape of any final settlement to reunify Cyprus would appear to be set.\" The secretary general said the plan remained the \"only foreseeable basis which the Cypriots have to achieve a settlement.\" A spokesman for European Union Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen stated that the Commission viewed Annan's report positively. Christophe Filori said the report \"is in accord with the results we have reached.\" In a separate report on the United Nations operation in Cyprus, released along with the report on the settlement negotiations, Annan recommended that the Security Council extend the mandate of the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) for a further period of six months until December 15, 2004. In this report, Annan stated that, in view of the \"watershed vote\" of April 24 and as part of a reappraisal of the U.N. peacekeeping activities in Cyprus, he would conduct a review, to be completed within three months, of UNFICYP's \"mandate, force levels, and concept of operations.\" He said he would submit to the Security Council \"recommendations on the adjustments or restructuring that may be required.\" June 4, 2004 Papadopoulos Critical of Annan's Report on Settlement Negotiations Washington, D.C. - Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos, reacting to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's report to the Security Council on the settlement negotiations, stated that the Greek Cypriots were \"particularly offended and consider unfounded\" Annan's view that their rejection of his settlement plan \"was tantamount to a rejection of a settlement.\" The president said the report contained \"a number of inaccuracies as regards to the facts, and we disagree with the secretary general's evaluation of the stance of both sides.\" Papadopoulos emphasized that, by voting \"no\" on the April 24 referendum on the Annan plan, the Greek Cypriots had expressed their displeasure with the plan as it stood, but their vote did not signify a rejection of the goal of reaching a Cyprus settlement. The Greek Cypriots, he said, decided that this specific plan did not fulfill the basic requirements for a solution. The Greek Cypriots, the president said, still believe that the Annan plan is \"a good basis for an eventual solution\" and still support the creation of a bizonal, bicommunal federation. He added that the shape of the final settlement was \"too important to expect us to rush into such a fundamental and irreversible change with what can only be described as an unseemly haste which would not be acceptable to any other state.\" The president said it was important to find \"an agreed solution between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots for our own interest, rather than serve the interests of the outsiders, mainly of Turkey, or the Europeans, or the U.S., or other countries.\" Following a meeting between Annan and Papadopoulos in New York on June 3, the day after the report was released, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the secretary general had urged the Cyprus president to find a way to break the impasse in the search for a reunification settlement. \"The secretary general said that, after the decisive rejection of the plan by the Greek Cypriots, it would be for that side to explain clearly to the Turkish Cypriots, the United Nations, and the rest of the world how they see the way forward,\" Eckhard stated. Eckhard also said Annan had called on Papadopoulos to respond positively to the secretary general's appeal, in his report, for states to eliminate unnecessary barriers to the development of the Turkish Cypriots. \"This will signal that the Greek Cypriots wish to reach out to their Turkish Cypriot compatriots in the north, and assist them and help facilitate the eventual goal of reunification,\" the spokesman said. Papadopoulos said he wished to help the Turkish Cypriots reap the benefits of European Union accession and see that they received as many benefits as possible on condition that these were permissible and possible in the context of EU and international law, as well as the decisions of the Security Council. June 4, 2004 U.S. Eases Visa Regulations for Turkish Cypriots Washington, D.C. - The U.S. government has amended visa regulations for Turkish Cypriots to grant them longer stays in the United States, the latest of a number of measures that are being considered by Washington to ease the international isolation of Turkish Cypriots. While previous regulations allowed Turkish Cypriots to remain in the U.S. for three months, with a total of two entries permitted during that time, they will now be issued two-year visas with multiple entries. The U.S. Embassy in Nicosia, which issues the visas, stated that the new regulations would be particularly beneficial for Turkish Cypriot students. To apply for a visa, Turkish Cypriots can present either a Republic of Cyprus passport or a passport issued by the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), which is not recognized by the United States. If they present a TRNC passport, not recognized as a valid passport since it has not been issued by a recognized entity, this document will be accepted as a \"travel document\" for identity purposes. The visa will then be stamped on a U.S. government form, which will be stapled inside the TRNC passport. Turkish Cypriots presenting a Republic of Cyprus passport will be granted the same visa issued to Greek Cypriots. The United States is continuing to review additional measures it will take concerning northern Cyprus and will implement them individually over the coming weeks as final decisions are made, according to the State Department. May 28, 2004 U.S. Expands Contacts with Turkish Cypriots as Debate Over Protocol for Green Line Crossings Continues Washington, D.C. - The United States, which is expected to announce a series of measures soon to ease the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots, invited, for the first time, an ambassador representing the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) to a U.S. diplomatic activity. U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Eric Edelman extended an invitation to the TRNC's ambassador to Turkey, Ahmet Zeki Bulunc, to attend a late May reception at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara commemorating the American independence day, the Fourth of July. The reception usually takes place the last week of June, but it was held earlier this year because of the June 28-29 NATO summit in Istanbul and the visit of President Bush to Turkey for the event. On May 21, U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Michael Klosson visited the prime minister of the TRNC, Mehmet Ali Talat, at the TRNC prime ministry, marking the first visit to that office by a U.S. ambassador. During Talat's early May visit to Washington, Secretary of State Colin Powell, in an unprecedented move, addressed him as \"prime minister.\" State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher stated that the U.S. now considers Talat to be the leader of the Turkish Cypriots, a title long accorded to Rauf Denktash, the TRNC president who served as the Turkish Cypriot representative at settlement negotiations until the March settlement talks in Burgenstock, Switzerland, when Talat took over the task. World Bank Country Director for Turkey Andrew Vorkink stated that the Bank would extend its help to the Turkish Cypriots to alleviate their isolation, noting that the Turkish Cypriot banking, state administration, and social security systems needed to be reformed. Although the income level of the Turkish Cypriots is only one-third of that of the Greek Cypriots, Vorkink said, the potential for tourism in the north is far greater than it is in the south and there will be foreign investment in this sector. He stated that the economic growth rate in northern Cyprus stands at 6 percent, while it is 2 percent in the south. In the meantime, the Turkish Cypriot administration, on May 25, ended its practice of requiring Greek Cypriots residing in Cyprus to present their passports at the Green Line when traveling north and allowed them to begin showing their identity cards instead. The presentation of identity cards had been considered sufficient for all other EU citizens traveling north, including Greek Cypriots living outside Cyprus, under a May 21 decree issued by the Turkish Cypriot cabinet. After Turkish Cypriot authorities opened the Green Line to two-way traffic in April 2003, they required Greek Cypriots to show their passports upon crossing the line, a stipulation that the Cyprus government opposed since the practice, in its view, inferred tacit recognition of the Turkish Cypriot administration. While the passport requirement remained in effect, Cyprus Government Spokesman Kypros Chrysostomides said, \"The issue proves an attempt [by the Turkish Cypriots] to take advantage of what Cyprus's accession to the EU offers\" for the purpose of tourism. He also criticized Talat for requiring EU Budget Commissioner Marcos Kyprianou, the former Cyprus finance minister, to show his passport upon crossing into the north, stating that the action was proof that \"the Turkish Cypriots are in contempt of EU representatives.\" Cyprus Foreign Minister George Iacovou said the demand that Greek Cypriots show their passports at the Green Line had always been illegal. Following the Turkish Cypriot decision to allow Greek Cypriots to present only their identity cards at the line, the foreign minister of the TRNC, Serdar Denktash, stated that \"the Greek Cypriot leadership should immediately stop discriminating between TRNC citizens on the basis of their place of birth.\" His comment was a reference to the fact that the Cyprus government does not allow settlers from Turkey living in the north to enter the south across the Green Line. Denktash said he would refer the matter to Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos. May 21, 2004 Cyprus Hosts EU Exercise to Curb Illegal Migration Washington, D.C. - Shortly after its May 1 entry into the European Union, Cyprus served as the command center for a groundbreaking EU exercise to combat illegal migration in the eastern Mediterranean, with the participation of seven other countries and the European Police Office (Europol) in The Hague. The 13-day exercise, called \"Operation Neptune,\" ended on May 15 and was coordinated from the Marine and Port Police Headquarters in the Cypriot port of Limassol. Cyprus provided a helicopter and an airplane, manned by a total of 20 military personnel, while both aircraft and ships were provided by Britain, France, Greece, and Italy. Germany, Malta, Spain, and Europol sent representatives to observe the exercise. The head of the Italian parliament's Schengen, Europol, and Immigration Committee, Alberto di Luca, stated that Cyprus played a major role in the EU from a geographical point of view since, located at the bloc's easternmost border, it was Europe's gateway to the Middle East. Italy, which launched the initiative for Operation Neptune, estimated that up to 50,000 illegal migrants on their way to Europe pass through open waters off the coast of Cyprus each year via the Middle East. Cyprus Police Chief Tassos Panayiotou said that more than 200 ships were intercepted during the exercise and checked for illegal immigrants, but none was found. Panayiotou asserted that there were over 30,000 illegal immigrants in Cyprus, while 1,550 have been arrested so far this year. May 14, 2004 Legal Status of Green Line Raised Under EU's Freedom of Movement Policy Washington, D.C. - The European Union's intention to allow the free movement of EU citizens across the U.N.-administered Green Line has been met with hints by the Cyprus government that it may impose fines on tourists who enter the country through the unrecognized ports or airports in the north and travel into the south. The EU asserts that free movement across this line must be maintained since it does not regard the line to be an external border of the bloc. Cyprus Commerce, Industry, and Tourism Minister George Lillikas said the Cyprus government had the exclusive right to decide on the possible penalties it may impose on persons entering the country via the north instead of through the internationally recognized ports and airports in the south. Cyprus Justice Minister Doros Theodorou said that, \"for those who come in from an illegal port or airport, the law of the republic [of Cyprus] is still valid.\" The European Commission's representative in Cyprus, Adriaan van der Meer, said the EU would \"not welcome\" fines being imposed on EU citizens. Although Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos stated that the government did not want to impose penalties related to the location of a person's entry into Cyprus, he said that such an issue, if it arose, would be political and should be decided by the relevant authorities. Papadopoulos further stated that, according to a law adopted by the Cyprus House of Representatives, European Union citizens have the right to free movement regardless of where they enter the country. However, he said, this law gives the Cyprus government the right to impose administrative measures. \"If and when the government decides to impose these measures will depend on the developments, but we do not wish and it is not our intention to impose measures,\" the president said. Before Cyprus became an EU member on May 1, tourists were denied entry into the south across the Green Line if they had entered the country through the north. In some cases, these individuals were arrested and deported. Though tourists who entered Cyprus through the south were allowed to travel north over the Green Line, they were not allowed to stay there overnight, a stipulation that the EU will no longer allow. Consultations between the Cyprus government and the European Union continue concerning the Green Line regulation adopted by the EU, which outlines special rules for the movement of goods, persons, and services across the line. The government is setting up a monitoring group and two technical committees to handle implementation of the regulation. The monitoring group will be comprised of officials from the ministries of agriculture, justice, and foreign affairs, as well as government legal authorities. It will advise the technical committees, while also conducting consultations with the European Commission and the authorities of the British sovereign bases to ensure the proper implementation of the regulation. May 10, 2004 Cyprus Joins EU, Papadopoulos Laments Turkish Cypriot Exclusion Washington, D.C. - Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos, in a speech marking the May 1 accession of Cyprus to the EU, stated that the Greek Cypriots' joy in acceding to the bloc was overshadowed by their \"grief\" over the fact that the moment could not be celebrated along with the Turkish Cypriots and by \"disappointment\" over the absence of a settlement. \"We do not want to enjoy the benefits of accession on our own. We want to share them with the Turkish Cypriots,\" Papadopoulos stated, adding that the Turkish Cypriots were entitled to these benefits as legitimate citizens of the Republic of Cyprus. Papadopoulos, who had successfully urged Greek Cypriots to vote \"no\" on the Annan plan in the referendum, said the government would work toward the reunification of the country and \"a functional and viable solution\" to the Cyprus problem. \"The rejection of one particular plan does not amount to the end of our efforts and our mission,\" he said. European Parliament President Pat Cox stated that the EU should recognize \"a special European duty of care to the community and leaders of Turkish Cyprus who were prepared to show leadership and an appetite for reconciliation\" by voting \"yes\" on the Annan plan. He said the European Parliament would insist that the $311 million earmarked for northern Cyprus by the EU was allocated to the Turkish Cypriot community and that the European Commission would supervise the expenditure of the funds. The head of the European Commission delegation in Nicosia, Adriaan van der Meer, assured the Turkish Cypriots that the Commission \"will use every means in our power\" to bring them closer to the EU and will search for ways to promote their economic development. The EU enlargement ceremony, admitting Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia to the bloc, was held in Ireland, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency. Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis emphasized that it was important for the international community to remain focused on the Cyprus problem since the basic objective was the reunification of the country to enable all Cypriots to benefit from EU accession. May 10, 2004 Talat Urges U.S. to End Turkish Cypriot Isolation Washington, D.C. - Secretary of State Colin Powell, in a May 4 meeting with Mehmet Ali Talat, the prime minister of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, said the Bush administration would soon announce a U.S. aid package aimed at easing the international isolation of the Turkish Cypriots. He reiterated his earlier statement that the U.S. would coordinate its policy toward northern Cyprus with that of the European Union, which announced that it would provide the Turkish Cypriots with $311 million in aid. The secretary of state praised the support of the Turkish Cypriots for the Annan plan in the referendum, expressing regret that the Greek Cypriots had rejected it. Powell, who met with Talat at the United Nations headquarters in New York 10 days after the referendum, was the highest-ranking U.S. official to meet with a Turkish Cypriot leader since Secretary of State James Baker III met with Rauf Denktash, the TRNC president and long-time Turkish Cypriot settlement negotiator, in the early 1990s. State Department Special Coordinator for Cyprus Thomas Weston has met regularly with Turkish Cypriot officials. Talat also met with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan in New York. The Turkish Cypriot official, who stated that he was not seeking formal diplomatic recognition for the TRNC, said he had told Powell and Annan that the Turkish Cypriots' first priority was persuading the international community to lift the ban on direct passenger flights into northern Cyprus in order to end the statelet's economic isolation and boost its tourist industry. The current requirement that any flight bound for northern Cyprus must first touch down in Turkey increases the cost of a trip and is time-consuming, he said. Talat noted that the primary source of income for the Turkish Cypriots in the future is likely to be tourism. Talat also said the opening of seaports in northern Cyprus to international commercial ships and to passenger vessels would facilitate both trade and tourism. He is also seeking the lifting of international restrictions on sporting activities and investment in the north. In Washington, Talat held meetings with U.S. Representative Henry Hyde (R-Illinois), the chairman of the House Committee on International Relations; Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Elizabeth Jones; and IMF European I Department Director Michael Deppler. Talat said the IMF would provide technical support for the development of a banking system and monetary policies in northern Cyprus. Before arriving in the United States, Talat said he was not satisfied with the measures announced by the European Union that would facilitate the export of Turkish Cypriot goods to the EU across the Green Line and through the internationally recognized seaports and airports of the Republic of Cyprus. He noted that the fact that the EU gave Greek Cypriots authority over Turkish Cypriot trade was not acceptable. \"The Greek Cypriot administration has no such authority,\" Talat said. Both Talat and the Turkish government have urged the European Union to establish direct transportation and trade links between the bloc's member states and northern Cyprus. Talat campaigned actively for a \"yes\" vote on the Annan plan, despite the opposition of Rauf Denktash to the plan. Talat has said that, although he remains committed to resolving the division of Cyprus, it would not be possible for the Turkish Cypriots to accept a re-negotiation of the Annan plan. Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos has said the plan was still on the table and there were efforts underway to make it more acceptable to the Greek Cypriots. President Bush telephoned Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to say that he welcomed Erdogan's \"strong leadership\" in helping to secure Turkish Cypriot approval of the Annan plan. A White House spokesman said both leaders noted their support for efforts by the EU and others to \"lessen the economic isolation of Turkish Cypriots by strengthening economic ties with Greek Cypriots and the outside world.\" They also expressed their hope for the reunification of Cyprus as provided for in the Annan plan. U.S. Representative Ed Whitfield (R-Kentucky) submitted a bill to the House of Representatives calling on Washington and the EU to take steps to \"abolish the economic and political isolation\" of the Turkish Cypriots. The bill also said the Turkish Cypriots should not abandon hope for a united Cyprus and EU membership, while also congratulating them for their \"yes\" vote on the Annan plan in the referendum. May 10, 2004 Turkey Hints at Possible Recognition of Cyprus Government Washington, D.C. - Although Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said it was too early to make a decision on the matter, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan signaled that Ankara could be considering recognition of the Republic of Cyprus. Turkey has long refused to grant diplomatic recognition to the internationally recognized Cyprus government and has, instead, recognized the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), which is recognized only by Ankara. \"Saying ‘I don't recognize [the Cyprus government]'. . . won't bring you anything or benefit you. In fact, these could harm positive developments for the future,\" Erdogan stated. He said Turkey did not \"want to clash or conflict with the realities of the world,\" adding that \"we have to take our place within these realities.\" Gul noted that Turkey, as an EU candidate, would have to be in contact with the Greek Cypriots within the European Union framework since they are now part of the EU. \"We will have to talk to them, shake hands with them whether we favor this or not,\" Gul said. For this reason, he stated, Turkey had wanted a united Cyprus to enter the EU. Gul asserted that r"
