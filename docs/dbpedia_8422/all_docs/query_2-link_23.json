        "text": "Characteristics of the health care system\n\nCyprus is in the process of implementing a comprehensive National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) (starting with outpatient care). A semi-governmental organization, namely the Health Insurance Organization, is responsible for the design, implementation and running of the new NHIS. Cyprus is currently moving towards the introduction of a primary care driven, universal health care coverage system for the entire population, with quality improvement processes as an important incorporated component. However, for the time being, Cyprus operates in a dual system of health care delivery, offering publicly funded health care services to low – and medium-income citizens, while the rest, mostly well-off part of the society, utilizes services from the private sector, covering their expenses either from private health insurance schemes or through out-of-pocket compensation. The majority of public as well as private primary care settings are characterized by underuse of contemporary information technologies, limited monitoring systems, and variable use of clinical standards of care such as chronic disease management guidelines and patient satisfaction surveys.\n\nAt the moment the government, as an employer, provides medical insurance to its employees through the public health sector. Employer and trade union sponsored schemes also provide medical insurance to their members, such as those organized by semi-government organizations and large private companies (e.g. banks) that offer health care coverage (including at least in-hospital insurance) to employees and their families. Furthermore, there is the Government Regular Employees Health Care and Welfare Scheme, administered by trade unions and governed jointly by representatives of the Ministry of Health, workers’ unions and others. This situation will change fundamentally when the NHIS is fully implemented. Under the new regime, the public health system will receive funding from the compulsory health insurance contributions and will also provide comprehensive medical care to the entire resident population at all levels of health care. The NHIS proposed for Cyprus aims at equity in finance and universal provision of health care with efficient delivery, high standards and containment of costs. Every person will be registered with a personal doctor (a GP for adults and a paediatrician for those under 16 years old). The selection of specialist and hospital will be the patient’s choice (public or private). As long as the specialist of their choice complies with the system parameters there should be no out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe share of health expenditure to GDP for Cyprus is well below the EU average and just above 6% of GDP (2009), with 2.8% and 3.4% being the corresponding shares of the public and private sector (see ). In contrast, in the EU, average total health care expenditure based on the same estimates was 8.9% of GDP, with 6.8% and 2.1% being the public and private sector health expenditure to GDP, respectively. The low percentage of health expenditure to GDP in Cyprus can be attributed to the following factors:\n\nTable A4.1\n\nDevelopment of health care resources and utilization.\n\nlack of a universal national health insurance scheme, which consequently leads to a very high out-of-pocket payment from patients, estimated at 50% of the total expenditure;\n\nyoung structure of the population as shown above (one of the highest percentages in Europe);\n\nlimited spending on medical research (one of the lowest percentages in Europe).\n\nThe 43% of the population in Cyprus who are not covered for pharmaceutical care must pay out of pocket for all medicines, in contrast to many other EU countries. Consequently, the pharmaceutical market is divided into two distinct sectors, public and private, which supply prescription and over-the-counter products, but operate independently at all levels. Cyprus has 435 private pharmacies and 43 public ones (2009). As a percentage of total health expenditure, pharmaceutical expenditure was 21% in Cyprus, compared to 17.8% on average in OECD countries (2002). Finally, during 2008, 66 429 patients were admitted for treatment and discharged from the general hospitals, compared with 63 344 in 2007, recording an increase of 4.9%.\n\n2.1. Primary care governance\n\nPrimary care in Cyprus is generally underdeveloped. A clear vision on the development of primary care in Cyprus has been set out after the preparation of the new NHIS by the Health Insurance Organization (HIO). A document on primary care reform was issued by the HIO in 2009. The policy paper at the moment has been transformed into a draft law, which is at the final stage of being approved by the Cyprus Parliament. At present the Ministry of Health is struggling to manage the pressure on public primary care due to the financial crisis by setting up new public primary health care centres in order to alleviate the problem. The current situation in primary care is that young doctors cover the rural areas. After serving in rural areas they can choose an urban primary care centre. Following the introduction of the NHIS, primary care will be covered by personal-family physicians and paediatricians. The governmental primary care centres will only operate in areas that will not be covered by personal physicians. Importantly, according to the NHIS, personal physicians will be divided into adult and children’s (up to 16 years) personal physicians (APPs and CPPs respectively).\n\nCurrently, no separate budget exists for primary care but, under the new NHIS, there will be a separate budget for primary care. The primary care budget will be clearly divided into two other budgets: the primary care budget for APPs and the primary care budget for CPPs. The primary care budget will be distributed to APPs and CPPs based on capitation, chronic disease management quality indicators and other incentives such as adoption and meaningful use of electronic health records.\n\nAt present, public primary care centres report to local hospitals’ medical directors. Under the new NHIS plan this will change and all the private primary care centres (which will be the vast majority) will be decentralized and autonomous, reporting only to the HIO. At present, very few responsibilities have been decentralized to the local level; the use of an appointment system is decided by the primary care centre itself but the number of personnel, service provision and priority setting is still undertaken by the regional hospital’s General Director and the Ministry of Health Medical Department. At present, no specific unit for health care inspection exists although, under the new NHIS, a unit for waste, fraud and abuse will be set up, with dual responsibility for primary and secondary care.\n\nThere is a requirement for a specialization in family medicine. Notwithstanding this, due to the fact that there is a lack of trained family physicians, the government employs in primary care a number of physicians who do not have special training in family medicine. Thus there is tremendous impact on the quality of care offered by public primary care centres. Based on the reform, all family physicians must provide documentary evidence of training in primary care in order to be contracted under the new NHIS. There is a variety of specialties in public primary care, however, since although the majority of doctors are GPs or family physicians, there are also non-specialized physicians, surgeons and urologists who work in primary care.\n\nAccording to the new NHIS, the requirements for setting up a practice will specify the number of square metres for premises (a minimum number is set), the building infrastructure (access for disabled patients, waiting room) and the primary care infrastructure (ECG, blood pressure measurement devices, point of care tests, etc.). Currently clinical guidelines are under development based on the adoption process. In the new NHIS plan (implementation date 2012), the connection of clinical guidelines, quality indicators and financial incentives (pay for performance) is considered an important tool in improving the quality of care. Moreover, the implementation according to the same plan of electronically based disease prevention and management programmes, and connecting them with financial incentives, is also expected to improve the quality of public and private primary care in Cyprus. Finally, the publication of primary care patient-centred outcomes, the encouragement to form group practices, the introduction of an electronic health records system and the overall enhanced medical leadership role of physicians will significantly improve the quality of care.\n\nDisease management guidelines have been produced in primary care but these have not been introduced officially, monitored or incentivized, nor has their implementation and impact on quality of care been assessed. The new NHIS will introduce electronic disease management programmes incentivized through extra reimbursement of personal physicians (PPs). The model of production of clinical guidelines for the new NHIS is based on the adoption of European guidelines (for example, from NICE [National Centre for Health and Care Excellence]). A procedure to process patient complaints is available only in secondary care, and specifically in public hospitals. There is, however, a complaint process which has been designed for the NHIS, covering all levels and aspects of care through different means (written, e-mail, telephone, etc.).\n\n2.2. Economic conditions of primary care\n\nThe expenditure on outpatient care as a percentage of total expenditure on health (Eurostat, 2009) is estimated at 26.2% (in 2006), but an estimate of current expenditure on primary care is not feasible due to the fact that more than 50% of primary care services are delivered in the private sector. Total expenditure on primary care and outpatient specialists within the new health care system is estimated at approximately 40% of total health expenditure. Preventive care and health promotion account for 0.6% (in 2006) of all expenditures on health, which is very low number in comparison with other European countries (Eurostat, 2009). Although 80% of the population is covered for primary care and secondary care costs, only 50% of these people are estimated to use the public services. The majority of public primary care patients are elderly people and the great majority of the younger population visit private medical centres, either hospital based or solo or group practices, and are either paying out of pocket or through private or work-based medical insurance. The long-awaited health care reform is expected to change this situation, since all the population will be covered to visit their doctor for free, with a free choice of either a private or a public primary care centre.\n\nThe private sector primary care physicians are self-employed and those in the public sector are salaried employees. In the private sector, PC physicians are paid on a fee-for-service basis, either out of pocket or through various insurance schemes. No regulatory mechanism exists except for the setting of an indicative minimum fee by the Cyprus Medical Association. The coverage of visits, lab tests and drugs varies between the different insurance schemes. In the public sector the co-payment for such services is extremely low, less than 1%, and there is almost 100% subsidization, with a very low fixed co-payment for medicines prescribed in primary care. The range of publicly available drugs is limited, with a number of generics included. Currently the proportion of the population uninsured for medical expenses may be about 10% of the population (all the low-income population is covered by public sector) and 80% of the population is covered by the services provided by public primary care centres. However, the quality of care differs significantly between the private and public sectors. Thus the vast majority of well-off patients use the private sector, with direct access to specialist care. Based on the current system, GPs are paid a flat salary, although, under the forthcoming health care reform, GPs will be paid a monthly salary tightly related to both the number of their patients and to performance indicators (e.g. quality indicators). No performance-related salary schemes exist currently in public primary care but a pay-for-performance scheme is planned with the introduction of the new NHIS.\n\nSelf-employed GPs are on fee-for-service payment. The (estimated) gross annual income of a “mid-career” GP in the public sector is approximately €55 000 while in the private sector the amount varies greatly, depending on the area served, qualifications, inpatient care and so on. The average income of a mid-career qualified GP in the public sector is the same as other specializations. However in the private sector there is a tremendous difference in favour of other specialists. In public general practice centres all the above costs, including infrastructure, is covered by public funds, while in the private sector the infrastructure costs of the practices are covered by the physicians themselves.\n\n2.3. Primary care workforce development\n\nIn the public sector there is direct access to the majority of specialists. Recently, the Ministry of Health has stopped the direct access of patients to specific specialties with a long waiting list, for example in orthopaedics. Notwithstanding this, primary care in Cyprus does not provide a gatekeeper service, resulting in high expenditure, duplicate expenses, lack of coordinated care and lack of continuity of care, lack of preventive services, etc. The average age of practising GPs in public primary care is estimated to be approximately more than 50 years, as the public primary care sector is currently underdeveloped and the majority of newly qualified physicians seek a career in other specializations. It is worth noting that since patients have direct access to specialist care in the public sector, public primary care physicians are mainly providing treatment for minor illness, prescriptions and lab test orders.\n\nThere is currently no government policy in place to increase the number of GPs in Cyprus. On the contrary, there was a 20% decrease in GPs from 1995 to 2000. A primary care workforce capacity plan is warranted in the near future in order to secure a sufficient number of trained GPs for the new NHIS. Moreover, there is an urgent need to update the GPs’ specialty programme. The general-family medicine specialization programme in collaboration with the Cyprus Ministry of Health was initiated in the early 2000s and has not been revised since then. This is a four-year training in general/family medicine. No academic medical institution exists at the moment in Cyprus, although there is a plan to establish a public Cyprus medical school and a private medical school. The General Medicine National Association is the official association of the four-year officially trained general-family physicians, and has 60 GPs as members. The association mainly undertakes educational and scientific activities, as well as contacts with the Ministry of Health in order to support the development of family medicine in Cyprus. Notwithstanding this, there is another association of general physicians, of which about 165 GPs are members, mainly those over the age of 50, who are physicians who have worked in primary care for many years but have not gone through the four-year official training scheme.\n\n3.1. Access to primary care services\n\nIt is estimated that Cyprus has 0.31 GPs per 1000 population so, due to the fact that there is a significant shortage of four-year trained GPs, the government is recruiting non-general practice trained physicians to general practice posts. No problems exist in the availability of medicines in rural areas, because every rural health centre has its own pharmacy. Usually the opening hours for public primary care centres are 7:30 pm to 2:30 pm and once a week the public primary care centres are open till 6 pm. Private primary care physicians usually work from 9 am till 8 pm, five days a week. Out-of-hours coverage is usually carried out through telephone consultation with private GPs and by private and public hospital emergency rooms. Home visits are not performed by public GPs, and only occasionally by private GPs, while community nurses are only rarely involved in home visits. Cancer patients are cared for at home by a non-profit-making organization which provides specialized cancer nursing. Patients in public primary care usually do not pay anything or an insignificant symbolic amount, while in the private sector there is always a payment, either out of pocket or via private insurance coverage.\n\nPrivate primary care sector practices always provide telephone consultations, occasionally e-mail consultations, occasionally have web sites and have appointment systems for the majority of patient contacts. On the contrary, none of the above usually exists in the public primary care sector, or very rarely. According to a European study (Dobrev et al., 2008), 3.5% of GPs in Cyprus (mixed sample, private and public) e-mail patients about administrative or health issues (in 2007) and 14% of GPs (only private GPs) were found to have their own practice web site. The same study showed that 95% of patients find it easy to reach and gain access to GPs (a collective response representing both public and private practice).\n\n3.2. Continuity of primary care services\n\nIn the current primary care system, GPs do not yet have a patient list system. As a result, the care received is fragmented and a significant waste of resources is observed (e.g. double ordering of lab tests, lack of continuity of care, lack of a universal electronic medical record). Based on the deployment of the health care reform plan (NHIS) the GPs will have a patient list, are expected to be more motivated to initiate disease management programmes, will have certain specific quality indicators and will be remunerated based on target accomplishments (tier 2–3).\n\nIt is estimated that almost all GPs keep clinical records. However, the vast majority of them diverge significantly in the quality of clinical records. The reform will introduce a universal electronic health records system that will be able to secure continuity of care, quality of medical data, data mining and data monitoring processes (Samoutis et al., 2007). About 54% of all GPs have access to a computer in the consultation room (Dobrev et al., 2008), but private sector GPs’ use is estimated to be much higher (estimated 70–80%). However, they do not use a comprehensive electronic medical record. Public sector GPs rarely use a computer and a paper-based health record is mandatory. Based on the current situation, patients can freely choose their public GP and centre, and, according to the new NHIS, patients will also be free to choose their GP and they will be able to change their GP every six months, should they wish to do so. However, in reality, restrictions in enjoying the right of free choice of a general practice centre still apply in rural areas, due to the limited choice. Based on a recent study (Samoutis et al., 2010), the vast majority of patients in public primary care are very satisfied with the care provided. The expectations of patients visiting public health care centres are very low compared with those patients visiting the private primary care centres. This may be explained by the fact that the average age, socioeconomic status and educational background of public primary care users is significantly different from those who use the private sector.\n\n3.4. Comprehensiveness of primary care services\n\nThe average number of patient contacts that are handled solely by GPs in Cyprus without referral to other providers is not known, although it is estimated that this patient contact number is not high. In public primary care the percentage of patient contacts handled solely by GPs without referrals to other providers is significantly smaller than in the private sector. GPs in Cyprus usually offer a medium to small range of services such as glucose test, dressings and bandages, otoscope examination, ECG (see ). However, no gynaecological examination is offered (nor is a cervical cytology test, sexually transmitted disease screening, etc.) nor a simple peak flow meter measurement.\n\nTable A4.2\n\nGPs’ involvement in delivery of various primary care services.\n\nGPs also deal with a narrow array of first-contact common health problems. Paediatric first-contact health problems are managed by paediatricians, just as are gynaecological first-contact problems are managed by gynaecologists. Inevitably, the public GPs are usually managing first-contact health problems mainly in the elderly low – to medium-income population. Concerning follow-up appointments, due to the lack of continuity of care the vast majority of patients with chronic diseases are followed by specialists in parallel with GPs, resulting again in duplication of costs and resources. The array of activities performed by GPs or general practice nurses is also limited; for example they do not perform any minor surgery procedures such as resection of ingrown toenail, wound suturing or excision of warts, nor any ophthalmological (fundoscopy, removal of rusty spot from the cornea) or gynaecological procedures (insertion of IUD).\n\nConcerning preventive activities in primary care undertaken by GPs, the same pattern is followed as above, with only a moderate array performed in primary care, such as cholesterol level checking and influenza vaccination, whereas the majority are undertaken by specialists (cervical cancer screening by gynaecologists, sigmoidoscopy by gastroenterologists, etc.). Mother and child and reproductive health care is not at all in the scope of GPs’ care.\n\n4.1. Quality of primary care\n\nAs stated above there is a significant room for improvement in primary care in Cyprus. The great majority of newly qualified physicians are not following general practice specialization, resulting in a limited number of trained GPs. The total number of physicians in Cyprus is 2226 (Cyprus Medical Association 2008 data) with only 255 GPs (9.8%) among them (219 in urban areas and 36 in rural areas). Only 25% of GPs have gone through the four-year training in family medicine. Notwithstanding this current structure, however, the new NHIS will change the picture and primary care will be brought to the centre of the health care system.\n\nThe average number of prescriptions annually provided by GPs has not been estimated. In 2007 a total of 16 million boxes of drugs was prescribed in total in the Cyprus health care system. Cyprus physicians in general are among the higher prescribers in Europe and about 33.9 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day of antibiotics were prescribed by ambulatory physicians in 2007 (ESAC, 2009).\n\nConcerning the quality of management of chronic diseases, data are only available from a pilot study in public primary care (Samoutis et al., 2010). Based on this study, approximately 30% of hypertensive patients were on target, whereas for the HbA1C target for patients with diabetes the success rate was approximately 55%. Preventive care data for Cyprus are limited. The screening coverage of women ever having had a mammogram in 1997 was estimated at 16.0% (patients do not need a referral to receive mammography because Cyprus has a national screening programme that targets women aged 50–69 every two years). Pap test screening is performed by gynaecologists in Cyprus and the screening rate is estimated to be relatively high, although no official data exists.\n\nThe average length of consultation in public primary care is estimated at an average of 15 minutes, whereas in the private sector it is on average 20 minutes. The above data are expert estimations and not official statistical data as at the moment these data do not exist. It is estimated that 10–20% of public primary care contacts end in a referral, whereas this proportion is 5–10% in private primary care."
