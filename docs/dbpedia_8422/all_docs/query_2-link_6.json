        "text": "Cyprus has approximately 1.21 million people, making it the 158th-largest country in the world. Cities in Cyprus have English names, Greek names, and Turkish names. The most populous city in Cyprus is Nicosia, which has 200,000 people, about 16.6% of the country’s total population. Nicosia is also Cyprus’s capital and the seat of government. The second-most populous city is Limassol, with about 184,000 people. Limassol is considered to be an up-and-coming world travel destination. Larnaca is the third-most populous city, located on the southern coast of Cyprus. Larnaca’s population is about 144,000 and is home to the country’s primary airport. These are the only three cities with populations above 100,000 and, together, comprise about 44% of the country’s total population.\n\nAbout 66.8% of Cyprus’s population lives in urban areas and cities. This is a slight decline from 2009 when the urban population was 67.7%."
