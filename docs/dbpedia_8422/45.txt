DEMOGRAPHY

1. Population of Cyprus

The population of Cyprus by ethnic group at independence in 1960 and in 1973, the last year before the Turkish invasion, was as follows:

TABLE 1 Population by Ethnic Group in 1960 and 1973 1960 (Census) 1973 (Census) Number% Number % Greek Cypriot Community (1) 447,901 78.20 498,511 78.9 Turkish Cypriot Community 103,822 18.13 116,000 18.4 Others 20,984 3.66 17,26 2.7 Total: 572,707 100.00 631,778 100.00

(1) According to the 1960 Constitution, the small religious minorities of Maronites, Armenians and Latins opted to be classified demographically within the Greek Cypriot Community. They are hence presented as one total.

The Census of 1973 showed the population of Cyprus to be 631,778, giving an average rate of growth of 0.8% between 1960 and 1973. The ethnic distribution of the population did not really change over this period and the proportion of each community remained stable whilst birth rates declined and Cyprus lost a part of the natural increase of its population through emigration.

The impact of the Turkish invasion on the population was devastating. As a result the total population declined and for a number of years remained below the figure for 1974. Gradually with birth and death rates and migration becoming more normal, population picked up and started growing again. Even so, it was in 1982 that finally the total population of Cyprus exceeded the highest figure reached in mid-1974 as shown in Table 2, which gives a summary of developments in population and other demographic variables after 1974. These are based on the assumption that Turkish Cypriot demographic variables have gone through the same changes as that of the population in the Government controlled areas, as shown in Table 3. However, on the basis of data available from Turkish Cypriot sources the number of Turkish Cypriots must be much smaller as a result of high emigration.

2. Population of Turkish Cypriots and of Turkish Mainland Settlers in the Occupied Areas.

The population statistics given by the Turkish occupation authorities for the occupied area of Cyprus are shown in Table 4 below.

The first figures given for March 1975 are clearly the true figures which agree with those available to the Government of Cyprus at the time. From then on they diverge considerably as the table below clearly shows.

The higher figures of the Turkish occupation authorities as compared to those of the Cyprus Government indicate the illegal introduction of settlers from Turkey to the occupied area of Cyprus with the aim of altering the demographic structure of the country.

While published data on such demographic variables as crude birth and death rates are similar to those in the Government-controlled areas, Turkish Cypriots do not publish any information regarding migration. They do not give any data in this field, because it will clearly show the loss of indigenous Turkish Cypriots emigrating, being replaced by an even greater number of mainland Turkish settlers, in what is a clear attempt by the occupation authorities to alter the demographic structure of Cyprus.

Indeed, according to press reports and comments by Turkish Cypriot politicians, Turkish Cypriots faced with the problems of unemployment, economic uncertainty and the pressures from Turkish settlers who are given many privileges, continue to emigrate. It is estimated that over 30,000 Turkish Cypriots have emigrated since 1974.

Given the continuing reports of emigration of Turkish Cypriots and the fact that the population in the occupied areas increases every year by more than the birth and death rates justify, it is obvious that the number of illegal Turkish mainland settlers is much higher. According to the Turkish Cypriot daily Yeniduzen of 14.2.1990 and statements by Turkish Cypriot politicians, the number of settlers from Turkey must have by now reached 80,000 while the Turkish Cypriot population is not more than 100,000. Nevertheless, the crucial issue is the illegal presence of Turkish mainland settlers in the occupied areas and its extremely negative impact on the search for a Cyprus solution - much more than the exact number of settlers.

3. Displaced Population

When in 1974 Turkish troops occupied about 37% of the area of Cyprus they evicted all but about 12,000 of the Greek Cypriot population of that area. Since then, most of the Greek Cypriots remaining in the occupied area were also forced to leave their homes and move to the Government-controlled area.

The latest count in June 1992 showed that only a handful of Greek Cypriots remain in the occupied area reinforcing the claim of the forced change of the demographic structure of the country in general and of the occupied areas in particular.

The number of Greek Cypriot refugees and the number of Greek Cypriots remaining in the occupied area since 1974 are given in Table 5. The estimates for the size of the refugee population take into account the natural increase of the population that has taken place since 1974.

TABLE 5 Greek Cypriot Refugees and Enclaved in the Occupied Areas, Refugees ('000s) Enclaved 1974 162(1) 12,289 1975 166 9,544 1976 173 4,095 1977 176 2,452 1982 187 1,395 1984 192 1,133 1985 194 1,060 1986 197 1,015 1987 199 951 1988 201 902 1989 203 869 1990 205 846 1991 207 816 1992 209 753

(1) In 1974 the actual number of refugees was 201,000. But about 40,000 people who became refugees in 1974 because they lived in dangerous areas close to the line of occupation but within the Government Controlled Area returned to their homes in 1977.
