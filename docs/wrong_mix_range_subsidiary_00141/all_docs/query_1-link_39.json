Users will need to contact the VETS-4212 Service Desk and register with the application in order to remove or change a point of contact.\n\nHave questions on how to fill out and complete your company's VETS-4212 Report?\n\nThe VETS-4212 Report should be filed if a business has a current federal government contract or subcontract worth $150,000 or more, regardless of the number of employees. The contract or subcontract may be with any department or agency of the United States for the procurement of personal property or non-personal services. Services include, but are not limited to, utility, construction, transportation, research, insurance, and fund depository, regardless whether the government is the purchaser or seller. The obligation to report is the responsibility of the contractor or subcontractor. If unsure of the requirements to file a report, please contact the authority requesting that the report be filed for clarification. Generally speaking, this authority is the federal contracting officer (CO) in charge of awarding the contract.\n\nIf the company does not have a current contract that meets the reporting threshold, as of January 1 with the federal government, it does not need to file a VETS-4212 for the current filing cycle.\n\nThe reporting requirements do not apply to state and local government agencies or state and local government contractors and subcontractors that do not participate in work under a federal contract or subcontract according to 41 CFR 60-300.\n\nA bank, financial institution or a private sector FDIC insured is covered under the Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Act (VEVRAA) if it has a single contract that meets the dollar threshold amount under VEVRAA filing requirements. Federal contracts held by banks and other financial institutions include, but are not limited to, agreements to serve as fund depositories, agreements for federal share and deposit insurance, and agreements to serve as an issuing and paying agent for U.S. savings bonds and savings notes.\n\nIf a company which is required to submit a VETS-4212 Report undergoes a merger or an acquisition, it is not necessary to notify the Veterans' Employment and Training Service for the purposes of filing the VETS-4212 Report. If an acquired or merged company maintains its identity once it has been merged with or acquired by another company, it is still required to file using its current Employer Identification Number (EIN). If the acquired or merged company does not maintain its identity once it has been merged with or acquired by another company, it is not required to file. Accordingly, the acquiring or merging company should not include the acquired or merged company’s information if the acquired or merged company maintains its identity. The acquiring or merging company must include the acquired or merged company’s information if the acquired or merged company does not maintain its identity.\n\nIf a company is not subject to the regulatory requirements under the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA), they are exempt from the requirement to file a VETS-4212. A notification informing the VETS-4212 Service Desk that a company does not have to file a VETS-4212 Report is not required. Additionally, the VETS-4212 Service Center does not provide information certifying that a company does not have to file. Any requirements placed on a company by a federal contracting officer (CO) to certify that it is not required to file should be addressed with the CO.\n\nFederal contractors and subcontractors who are required, but fail, to file the VETS-4212 Report will not be subject to fines. However, federal contracting agencies are prohibited from obligating or expending funds to enter into a contract with the contractor or subcontractor.\n\nThe reporting organization indicates the type of contractual relationship (either a prime contractor or a subcontractor) that the organization has with the federal government. If the organization serves as both a prime contractor and a subcontractor on various federal contracts, select both options.\n\nA prime contractor is the company which was initially awarded a contract to provide a service or product to the federal government. The Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Act (VEVRAA) requires covered federal contractors and subcontractors to file the VETS-4212 Report. The VETS-4212 Report requires a company to indicate the type of contractual relationship that it has with the federal government. If the company serves as a prime contractor, please select \"Prime Contractor\" under the \"Type of Reporting Organization\" section.\n\nA subcontractor is a business who receives a contract from a federal contractor (prime contractor or subcontractor) to perform a specific task as part of a contract awarded by the federal government. The Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Act (VEVRAA) requires covered federal contractors and subcontractors to file the VETS-4212 Report. The VETS-4212 Report requires a company to indicate the type of contractual relationship that it has with the federal government. If the company serves as both a prime contractor and a subcontractor on federal contracts, please select both \"Prime Contractor\" and \"Subcontractor\" under the \"Type of Reporting Organization\" section.\n\nThe VETS-4212 Report requires a company to indicate the type of contractual relationship that it has with the federal government. If the company serves as both a prime contractor and a subcontractor on federal contracts, please select both \"Prime Contractor\" and \"Subcontractor\" under the \"Type of Reporting Organization\" section.\n\nReporting organizations that submit a VETS-4212 Report for a single location should select Single Establishment. If the reporting organization submits more than one form, only one form should be submitted as Multiple Establishment-Headquarters. The remaining forms should be submitted as either Multiple Establishment-Hiring Location or Multiple Establishment-State Consolidated. For state consolidated forms, the number of hiring locations included in that report should be entered in the space provided.\n\nThe term \"Hiring Location\" refers to an economic unit which produces goods or services, such as a factory, office, store, or mine. In most instances, the establishment is a single physical location engaged in one, or predominantly one, economic activity. Employers required to file the VETS-4212 Report must file a completed report for its establishment. Multiple establishment employers with more than one hiring location must file a VETS-4212 Report for the headquarters office and for each establishment. If the multiple establishment hiring locations within a state employ fewer than 50 persons, the employer can file separate reports for each location, or state consolidated reports that cover all hiring location establishments within one state.\n\nCompanies are not required to report on locations outside of the U.S. and its territories.\n\n\"Parent Company\" refers to any corporation which owns all or the majority stock of another corporation so that the latter stands in relation to it as a subsidiary company.\n\nFor the purposes of filing a VETS-4212 Report, a subsidiary company is a company of which a parent company owns all or the majority of the subsidiary company’s stock.\n\nA subsidiary company that is a federal contractor or subcontractor must file a Multiple Establishment-Hiring Location Report for the parent company which owns all or the majority of the company’s stock. For the purposes of filing a VETS-4212 Report, a subsidiary company that is not a federal contractor or subcontractor should not be included in the Parent Company's VETS-4212 Report. The obligation to file a report is the responsibility of the contractor or subcontractor. If unsure of the requirements to file a report, please contact the authority requesting that the report be filed. Generally speaking, this authority is the federal contracting officer (CO) in charge of awarding a contract.\n\nMultiple establishment employers are those employers doing business at more than one hiring location. In addition to filing a completed VETS-4212 Report covering the principal or headquarters office, these employers must:\n\nFile a separate VETS-4212 Report for each hiring location or state consolidated for each state employing 50 or fewer persons; and\n\n* See Question 22\n\nMultiple establishment employers do business at more than one hiring location. When filing for a headquarters office, employers must:\n\nFile one completed VETS-4212 Report covering the principal or headquarters office; and\n\nSelect \"Multiple Establishment - Headquarters\" under the \"Type of Form\" section.\n\nIn addition to filing a completed VETS-4212 Report covering the principal or headquarters office, and separate VETS-4212 Reports for each hiring location within one state employing 50 or more persons, multiple establishment employers must either:\n\nFile a separate report for each hiring location, select “Multiple Establishment - Hiring Location;” or\n\nFile state consolidated reports that cover hiring locations within one state that have fewer than 50 employees, select “Multiple Establishment - State Consolidated,” and specify the number of Multi-State Consolidated (MSC) locations in the space provided.\n\nMultiple establishment employers may file multiple establishment state consolidated (MSC) reports that cover hiring locations within one state that have fewer than 50 employees. The MSC Number indicates the number of hiring locations when filing a VETS-4212 Multiple Establishment - State Consolidated Report. The MSC number is a required field in order to submit a Multiple Establishment - State Consolidated report and indicates the number of hiring locations within the state consolidated report. The MSC number is not a required field if a Multiple Establishment - State Consolidated Report is not being filed.\n\nIf a VETS-4212 Report has been filed in the past, you will need to enter the company number assigned in previously submitted reports. The company number is a company identifier used when filing the VETS-4212 report. The company number should start with a letter \"T\" followed by six digits. A company that filed in 2019 should use the same company number when filing in 2020. If a company number is not available, please leave the field blank. If there are any questions regarding a company number, please contact the VETS-4212 Customer Support Center at 1-866-237-0275 or vets4212-customersupport@dolncc.dol.gov.\n\nFor purposes of completing VETS-4212 Reports, enter the end date for the 12 month “reporting period” used as the basis for filing the VETS-4212 Report. The \"reporting period\" is the 12 months preceding the selected payroll period ending date. To determine the “reporting period,” the contractor should select a date in the applicable year between July 1 and August 31 that represents the end of a payroll period. For example, if a contractor's payroll period ends on August 15, 2023, it would then go back one year to August 16, 2022. This is the year that would represent the reporting period for the 2023 filing cycle. In addition, you can use December 31 of the previous year.\n\nYes. Certain federal contractors are required by the Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 (VEVRAA) to report annually on their affirmative action efforts in employing veterans. They report this information on the VETS-4212 Report. Federal contractors that file both the EEO-1 and the VETS-4212 Report may choose the last full pay period in each calendar year for the purposes of counting employees for both reports.\n\nThe EEO-1 allows employers to choose any one pay period between October 1 and December 31 for the purpose of counting employees (the “workforce snapshot period”). The VETS-4212 regulations allow contractors to count employees for the VETS-4212 Report as of a December 31 “VEVRAA Ending Date” if the federal contractor has “previous written approval” from the EEOC to do so for purposes of submitting the EEO-1. The EEOC has already given blanket “previous written approval” to federal contractors in the form of the implementation notice for the revised EEO-1. DOL, which administers and enforces contractors’ obligations under VEVRAA, has accepted this as the EEOC’s “previous written approval.” DOL has also confirmed that if the last pay period of a calendar year does not end exactly on December 31, it will not cite contractors with any violation for using a VEVRAA Ending Date that falls on the last day of the final full pay period in the calendar year. DOL notes that this does not affect the filing deadline for the VETS-4212 Report; which must be filed no later than September 30 of the following calendar year.\n\nFor purposes of completing the VETS-4212 Report, enter the name and address of the \"Parent Company\" for which the VETS-4212 Report is filed. The \"Parent Company\" refers to any corporation which owns all or the majority stock of another corporation so that the latter stands in relation to it as a subsidiary company. For \"Parent Company\" headquarters location, complete the name and address for the \"Parent Company\" headquarters, and leave blank the name and address of the \"Hiring Location.\" For \"Hiring Locations\" of a parent company, complete the address for the \"Parent Company\" location, and the name and address for the \"Hiring Location.\"\n\nFor purposes of completing the VETS-4212 Report, enter the name, telephone number, and email address for the \"Company Contact\" for the employer for which the VETS-4212 Report is filed. The \"Company Contact\" is the primary point of contact who is responsible for the management of the company, report, and user information which is submitted through the VETS-4212 Reporting Application. The \"Company Contact\" can be removed or designated by the registered user only. Users will need to contact the VETS-4212 Service Desk and register with the application in order to remove or change a \"Company Contact.\"\n\nThe term \"Hiring Location\" refers to an economic unit which produces goods or services, such as a factory, office, store, or mine. In most instances, the establishment is a single physical location engaged in one, or predominantly one, economic activity. Employers required to file the VETS-4212 Report must file a completed report for its establishment. Multiple establishment employers with more than one hiring location must file a VETS-4212 Report for the headquarters office and for each hiring location. If the multiple establishment hiring location employs fewer than 50 persons, the employer may file separate reports for each location or state consolidated reports that cover hiring location establishments within one state.\n\nThe term “Employee” for purposes of VETS-4212 reporting means any individual on the payroll of an employer who is an employee for purposes of the employer’s withholding of Social Security taxes (except insurance sales agents who are considered to be employees for such purposes solely because of the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 3121(d)(3)(B)), including part-time and leased employees. The term “Employee” does not include persons who are hired on a casual basis for a specific job (e.g., persons at a construction site whose employment relationship is expected to terminate with the end of the employee’s work at the site); persons employed temporarily in an industry other than construction who are hired through a hiring hall or some other referral arrangement; or persons on the payroll of an employment agency who are referred by such agency for work to be performed on the premises of another employer under that employer’s direction and control, as provided in 41 CFR 61-300.2(b)(5).\n\nA \"New Hire\" is a regular full-time or part-time employee who is hired and included in the payroll for the first time during the reporting period. The VETS-4212 reporting period is considered to be the 12-month period preceding the ending date of the selected payroll period which is between July 1 and August 31 of the filing year, or the 12-month period preceding December 31 of the previous year.\n\nFor the purposes of VETS-4212 reporting, “Protected Veterans” are veterans who are protected under the nondiscrimination and affirmative action provisions of the Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA); specifically veterans who may be classified as:\n\nActive Duty Wartime or Campaign Badge Veterans (“other protected veterans”);\n\nArmed Forces Service Medal Veterans;\n\nDisabled Veterans; or\n\nRecently Separated Veterans.\n\nA complete description of these veteran categories can be found in regulation 41 CFR 61-300.

A complete description of this veteran category can be found in regulation 41 CFR 61-300.\n\nFor the purposes of VETS-4212 reporting, “Armed Forces Service Medal Veterans” are individuals who, while serving on active duty in the U.S military, ground, naval, or air service, participated in a United States military operation for which an Armed Forces Service Medal was awarded. A complete description of this veteran category can be found in regulation 41 CFR 61-300.\n\nFor the purposes of VETS-4212 reporting, veterans of the U.S. military, ground, naval, or air service are generally considered to be disabled if they are entitled to compensation under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Veterans may also fall under this category if they were discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability. A complete description of this veteran category can be found in regulation 41 CFR 61-300.\n\nFor the purposes of VETS-4212 reporting, “recently separated veterans” are individuals who served on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval, or air service during the three-year period beginning on the date of each such veteran’s discharge or release from active duty. Recently separated veterans will be counted in the \"Number of Employees\" and/or the \"New Hires\" section of the VETS-4212 Report accordingly. A complete description of this veteran category can be found in regulation 41 CFR 61-300.\n\nContractors and subcontractors are not required to survey their workforces to solicit information about veterans’ status for the purpose of completing the VETS-4212 Report. A contractor is permitted to solicit information about veterans’ status in any lawful manner. For example, if a contractor periodically surveys its employees for the purpose of updating personnel records, the contractor could ask the employees to provide information regarding their veterans’ status at that time. More information concerning what may or may not be solicited can be found on the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs' Frequently Asked Questions webpage.\n\nA federal contractor is required to invite applicants to disclose whether they are veterans covered under the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA) and wish to benefit under the contractor’s affirmative action program (AAP) for covered veterans. The contractor may invite applicants to voluntarily self-identify as a veteran at any time before the applicant begins his or her employment duties. More information concerning what may or may not be solicited can be found in 41 CFR Appendix B to Part 60-300.\n\nFor the purposes of VETS-4212 reporting, employees who are considered to be “Executive/Senior Level Officials and Managers” are individuals who plan, direct, and formulate policies; and provide overall direction of organizations for the development and delivery of products and services. A complete description and a list of worker types that fall under this job category can be found in regulation 41 CFR 61-300.\n\nFor the purposes of VETS-4212 reporting, employees who are considered to be “First/Mid-Level Officials and Managers” are individuals who receive directions from executive/senior level officials and management, and typically lead major business units.
