And his entire career was based on that triangle.”\n\nAngela Petriccione, Payroll Administrator, 39 Years with Lincoln Investment: “Nick truly believed that he had the best people in the world working for him, and I think that that is probably what differentiates Lincoln from other firms, is how they value their employees.”\n\nDenis Houser, Senior Vice President, Business Development: “When you talk about hiring people that are hungry, humble, and smart, it’s a set of character traits that carries out throughout the organization.”\n\nLouis Manon, Investment Services Advisor: “I like helping people. That is the best part about being an advisor. And I like the culture at Lincoln because it’s people centered, and so it’s very easy for me to be myself and not have to be a cardboard cutout of what you think a financial advisor should be.”\n\nEd Forst: “I think advisor leadership is really important. Dad and I both started out as advisors. Together we provided advisor leadership for the last 50 years.”\n\nTom Lakatos: “When I think about Lincoln, what I think about first and foremost is fiercely committed independence. This firm has been very financially responsible, and put itself in a position to last 50 years.”\n\nDeirdre Koerick, Senior Vice President Chief Compliance Officer: “Everything we do we take ownership of, and I think that then carries us through to make sure we do it well.”\n\nDenis Houser: “It’s just a natural part of the culture is that we have a very deep care for what we do. I think it’s that combination of that family type organization and solutions based, from that practical innovation, I think that allows us to deliver what the client needs.”\n\nEd Forst: “We found a need to provide specialized services to high networth families. In 2012, we invited Capital Analysts and their advisors to join Lincoln. As Lincoln focused in the middle market they brought special skills, special abilities, special tools that we never had. For us to really kind of fulfill our destiny and fulfill our mission I think is the next 50 years. And the next 50 years will be even more change than the first 50 years. And I think that’s what we’re all focused on. So we’ve done what we need to do and we’ve completed our mission of getting to the first 50 years and the entire focus now is on the next 50.”\n\nWords on screen:\n\nLincoln Investment\n\nLincoln Investment | Registered Investment Adviser, Broker/Dealer, Member FINRA/SIPC. www.lincolninvestment.com\n\nCoporate office: 601 Office Center Drive, Suite 300, Fort Washington, PA 19034 (800) 242-1421"
