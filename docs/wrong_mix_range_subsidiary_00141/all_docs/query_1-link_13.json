The decisions about your implementation of Oracle Fusion Applications are affected by your:\n\nIndustry\n\nBusiness unit requirements for autonomy\n\nBusiness and accounting policies\n\nBusiness functions performed by business units and optionally, centralized in shared service centers\n\nLocations of facilities\n\nEvery enterprise has three fundamental structures, legal, managerial, and functional, that are used to describe its operations and provide a basis for reporting. In Oracle Fusion, these structures are implemented using the chart of accounts and organizations. Although many alternative hierarchies can be implemented and used for reporting, you are likely to have one primary structure that organizes your business into divisions, business units, and departments aligned by your strategic objectives.\n\nLegal Structure\n\nThe figure above shows a typical group of legal entities, operating various business and functional organizations. Your ability to buy and sell, own, and employ comes from your charter in the legal system. A corporation is a distinct legal entity from its owners and managers. The corporation is owned by its shareholders, who may be individuals or other corporations. There are many other kinds of legal entities, such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, and government agencies.\n\nA legally recognized entity can own and trade assets and employ people in the jurisdiction in which it is registered. When granted these privileges, legal entities are also assigned responsibilities to:\n\nAccount for themselves to the public through statutory and external reporting\n\nComply with legislation and regulations\n\nPay income and transaction taxes\n\nProcess value added tax (VAT) collection on behalf of the taxing authority\n\nMany large enterprises isolate risk and optimize taxes by incorporating subsidiaries. They create legal entities to facilitate legal compliance, segregate operations, optimize taxes, complete contractual relationships, and isolate risk. Enterprises use legal entities to establish their enterprise's identity under the laws of each country in which their enterprise operates.\n\nIn the figure above, a separate card represents a series of registered companies. Each company, including the public holding company, InFusion America, must be registered in the countries where they do business. Each company consists of various divisions created for purposes of management reporting. These are shown as vertical columns on each card. For example, a group might have a separate company for each business in the United States (US), but have their United Kingdom (UK) legal entity represent all businesses in that country. The divisions are linked across the cards so that a business can appear on some or all of the cards. For example, the air quality monitoring systems business might be operated by the US, UK, and France companies. The list of business divisions is on the Business Axis. Each company's card is also horizontally striped by functional groups, such as the sales team and the finance team. This functional list is called the Functional Axis. The overall image suggests that information might, at a minimum, be tracked by company, business, division, and function in a group environment. In Oracle Fusion Applications, the legal structure is implemented using legal entities.\n\nManagement Structure\n\nSuccessfully managing multiple businesses requires that you segregate them by their strategic objectives, and measure their results. Although related to your legal structure, the business organizational hierarchies do not need to be reflected directly in the legal structure of the enterprise. The management structure can include divisions, subdivisions, lines of business, strategic business units, and cost centers. In the figure above, the management structure is shown on the Business Axis. In Oracle Fusion Applications, the management structure is implemented using divisions and business units.\n\nFunctional Structure\n\nStraddling the legal and business organizations is a functional organization structured around people and their competencies. For example, sales, manufacturing, and service teams are functional organizations. This functional structure is represented by the Functional Axis in the figure above. You reflect the efforts and expenses of your functional organizations directly on the income statement. Organizations must manage and report revenues, cost of sales, and functional expenses such as research and development (R&D) and selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses. In Oracle Fusion Applications, the functional structure is implemented using departments and organizations, including sales, marketing, project, cost, and inventory organizations.\n\nEnterprise Structures Business Process Model: Explained\n\nIn Oracle Fusion Applications, the Enterprise Performance and Planning Business Process Model illustrates the major implementation tasks that you perform to create your enterprise structures. This process model includes the Set Up Enterprise Structures business process, which consist of implementation activities that span many product families. Information Technology is a second Business Process Model which contains the Set Up Information Technology Management business process. Define Reference Data Sharing is one of the activities in this business process and is important in the implementation of the enterprise structures. This activity creates the mechanism to share reference data sets across multiple ledgers, business units, and warehouses, reducing the administrative burden and decreasing the time needed to implement.\n\nThe following figure and chart describes the Business Process Model structures and activities.\n\nGlobal Enterprise Configuration: Points to Consider\n\nStart your global enterprise structure configuration by discussing what your organization's reporting needs are and how to represent those needs in the Oracle Fusion Applications. Consider deployment on a single instance, or at least, on as few instances as possible, to simplify reporting and consolidations for your global enterprises. The following are some questions and points to consider as you design your global enterprise structure in Oracle Fusion.\n\nEnterprise Configuration\n\nBusiness Unit Management\n\nSecurity Structure\n\nCompliance Requirements\n\nEnterprise Configuration\n\nWhat is the level of configuration needed to achieve the reporting and accounting requirements? What components of your enterprise do you need to report on separately? Which components can be represented by building a hierarchy of values to provide reporting at both detail and summary levels? Where are you on the spectrum of centralization versus decentralization?\n\nBusiness Unit Management\n\nWhat reporting do I need by business unit? How can you set up your departments or business unit accounts to achieve departmental hierarchies that report accurately on your lines of business? What reporting do you need to support the managers of your business units, and the executives who measure them? How often are business unit results aggregated? What level of reporting detail is required across business units?\n\nSecurity Structure\n\nWhat level of security and access is allowed? Are business unit managers and the people that report to them secured to transactions within their own business unit? Are the transactions for their business unit largely performed by a corporate department or shared service center?\n\nCompliance Requirements\n\nHow do you comply with your corporate external reporting requirements and local statutory reporting requirements? Do you tend to prefer a corporate first or an autonomous local approach? Where are you on a spectrum of centralization, very centralized or decentralized?\n\nModeling Your Enterprise Management Structure in Oracle Fusion: Example\n\nThis example uses a fictitious global company to demonstrate the analysis that can occur during the enterprise structure configuration planning process.\n\nScenario\n\nYour company, InFusion Corporation, is a multinational conglomerate that operates in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). InFusion has purchased an Oracle Fusion enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution including Oracle Fusion General Ledger and all of the Oracle Fusion subledgers. You are chairing a committee to discuss creation of a model for your global enterprise structure including both your US and UK operations.\n\nInFusion Corporation\n\nInFusion Corporation has 400 plus employees and revenue of $120 million. Your product line includes all the components to build and maintain air quality monitoring (AQM) systems for homes and businesses. You have two distribution centers and three warehouses that share a common item master in the US and UK. Your financial services organization provides funding to your customers for the start up costs of these systems.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe following are elements you need to consider in creating your model for your global enterprise structure.\n\nYour company is required to report using US GAAP standards and UK Statements of Standard Accounting Practice and Financial Reporting Standards. How many ledgers do you need to achieve proper statutory reporting?\n\nYour managers need reports that show profit and loss (revenue and expenses) for their lines of business. Do you use business units and balancing segments to represent your divisions and businesses? Do you secure data by two segments in your chart of accounts which represents each department and legal entity or one segment that represents both to produce useful, but confidential management reports?\n\nYour corporate management requires reports showing total organizational performance with drill down capability to the supporting details. Do you need multiple balancing segment hierarchies to achieve proper rollup of balances for reporting requirements?\n\nYour company has all administrative, account payables, procurement, and human resources functions performed at their corporate headquarters. Do you need one or more business unit in which to perform all these functions? How will your shared service center be configured?\n\nGlobal Enterprise Structure Model\n\nThe following figure and table summarize the model that your committee has designed and uses numerical values to provide a sample representation of your structure. The model includes the following recommendations:\n\nCreation of three separate ledgers representing your separate legal entities:\n\nInFusion America Inc.\n\nInFusion Financial Services Inc.\n\nInFusion UK Services Inc.\n\nConsolidation of results for system components, installations, and maintenance product lines across the enterprise\n\nAll UK general and administrative costs processed at the UK headquarters\n\nUS Systems' general and administrative costs processed at US Corporate headquarters\n\nUS Financial Services maintains its own payables and receivables departments\n\nIn this chart, the green globe stands for mandatory and gold globe stands for optional setup. The following statements expand on the data in the chart.\n\nThe enterprise is mandatory because it serves as an umbrella for the entire implementation. All organizations are created within an enterprise.\n\nLegal entities are also mandatory. They can be optionally mapped to balancing segment values or represented by ledgers. Mapping balancing segment values to legal entities is mandatory if you plan to use the intercompany functionality.\n\nAt least one ledger is mandatory in an implementation in which you record your accounting transactions.\n\nBusiness units are also mandatory because financial transactions are processed in business units.\n\nA shared service center is optional, but if used, must be a business unit.\n\nDivisions are optional and can be represented with a hierarchy of cost centers or by a second balancing segment value.\n\nDepartments are mandatory because they track your employees.\n\nOptionally, add an item master organization and inventory organizations if you are tracking your inventory transactions in Oracle Fusion Applications.\n\nDefine Initial Configuration with the Enterprise Structures Configurator\n\nEstablishing Enterprise Structures Using the Enterprise Structures Configurator: Explained\n\nThe Enterprise Structures Configurator is an interview-based tool that guides you through the process of setting up a basic enterprise structure. By answering questions about your enterprise, the tool creates a structure of divisions, legal entities, business units, and reference data sets that reflects your enterprise structure. After you create your enterprise structure, you also follow a guided process to determine whether or not to use positions, and whether to set up additional attributes for jobs and positions. After you define your enterprise structure and your job and position structures, you can review them, make any necessary changes, and then load the final configuration.\n\nThis figure illustrates the process to configure your enterprise using the Enterprise Structures Configurator.\n\nTo be able to use the Enterprise Structures Configurator, you must select the Enterprise Structures Guided Flow feature within the offerings in the Functional Setup Manager (FSM). If you do not select this feature, then you must set up your enterprise structure using individual tasks provided elsewhere in the offerings, and you cannot create multiple configurations to compare different scenarios.\n\nEstablish Enterprise Structures\n\nTo define your enterprise structures, you use the guided flow within the Establish Enterprise Structures task to enter basic information about your enterprise, such as the primary industry and the location of your headquarters. You then create divisions, legal entities, business units, and reference data sets. The Establish Enterprise Structures task enables you to create multiple enterprise configurations so that you can compare different scenarios. Until you load a configuration, you can continue to create and edit multiple configurations until you arrive at one that best suits your enterprise.\n\nEstablish Job and Position Structures\n\nIn addition to using the Establish Enterprise Structures task to create the basic structure of your enterprise, you also use a guided process to determine whether you want to use jobs only, or jobs and positions. The primary industry that you select in the Establish Enterprise Structures task provides the application with the information needed to make an initial recommendation. You can either accept the recommendation, or you can answer additional questions about how you manage people in your enterprise, and then make a selection. After you select whether to use jobs or positions, the guided process prompts you to set up a descriptive flexfield structure for jobs, and for positions if you have chosen to use them. Descriptive flexfields enable you to capture additional information when you create jobs and positions.\n\nReview Configuration\n\nAfter you create enterprise configurations and job and position structures, you can review a summary of the results of the two interview processes. For each configuration, the online summary lists the divisions, legal entities, business units, reference data sets, and job and position structures that the application will create when you load the configuration.\n\nFor a more detailed analysis of a configuration, you can access the Technical Summary Report. This report lists the same information as the online summary, but also lists the following information that will be created by the application when you load the configuration, based on your configuration:\n\nLegislative data groups (the application creates one legislative data group for each country that is identified in the configuration.)\n\nName of the legislative data group that will be assigned to the payroll statutory unit that is generated for each legal entity.\n\nOrganization hierarchy.\n\nThe Technical Summary report also lists the default settings that will be loaded for these fields, which you access from the Manage Enterprise HCM Information task: Worker Number Generation, Employment Model and Allow Employment Terms Override. You can print the Technical Summary Report for each of your configurations and compare each scenario.\n\nLoad Configuration\n\nYou can load only one configuration. When you load a configuration, the application creates the divisions, legal entities, business units, and so on. After you load the configuration, you then use individual tasks to edit, add, and delete enterprise structures.\n\nDesigning an Enterprise Configuration: Example\n\nThis example illustrates how to set up an enterprise based on a global company operating mainly in the US and the UK with a single primary industry.\n\nScenario\n\nInFusion Corporation is a multinational enterprise in the high technology industry with product lines that include all the components that are required to build and maintain air quality monitoring (AQM) systems for homes and businesses. Its primary locations are in the US and the UK, but it has smaller outlets in France, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nEnterprise Details\n\nIn the US, InFusion employs 400 people and has a company revenue of $120 million. Outside the US, InFusion employs 200 people and has revenue of $60 million.\n\nAnalysis\n\nInFusion requires three divisions. The US division will cover the US locations. The Europe division will cover the UK and France. Saudi Arabia and the UAE will be covered by the Middle East division.\n\nInFusion requires legal entities with legal employers, payroll statutory units, tax reporting units, and legislative data groups for the US, UK, France, Saudi Arabia, and UAE, in order to employ and pay its workers in those countries.\n\nInFusion requires a number of departments across the enterprise for each area of business, such as sales and marketing, and a number of cost centers to track and report on the costs of those departments.\n\nInFusion requires business units for human capital management (HCM) purposes. Infusion has general managers responsible for business units within each country. Those business units may share reference data. Some reference data can be defined within a reference data set that multiple business units may subscribe to. Business units are also required for financial purposes. Financial transactions are always processed within a business unit.\n\nResulting Enterprise Configuration\n\nBased on this analysis, InFusion requires an enterprise with multiple divisions, ledgers, legal employers, payroll statutory units, tax reporting units, legislative data groups, departments, cost centers, and business units.\n\nThis figure illustrates the enterprise configuration that results from the analysis of InFusion Corporation.\n\nDivision: Explained\n\nManaging multiple businesses requires that you segregate them by their strategic objectives and measure their results. Responsibility to reach objectives can be delegated along the management structure. Although related to your legal structure, the business organizational hierarchies do not need to reflect directly the legal structure of the enterprise. The management entities and structure can include divisions and subdivisions, lines of business, and other strategic business units, and include their own revenue and cost centers. These organizations can be included in many alternative hierarchies and used for reporting, as long as they have representation in the chart of accounts.\n\nDivisions\n\nA division refers to a business oriented subdivision within an enterprise, in which each division organizes itself differently to deliver products and services or address different markets. A division can operate in one or more countries, and can be comprised of many companies or parts of different companies that are represented by business units.\n\nA division is a profit center or grouping of profit and cost centers, where the division manager is responsible for attaining business goals including profit goals. A division can be responsible for a share of the company's existing product lines or for a separate business. Managers of divisions may also have return on investment goals requiring tracking of the assets and liabilities of the division. The division manager reports to a top corporate executive.\n\nBy definition a division can be represented in the chart of accounts. Companies may choose to represent product lines, brands, or geographies as their divisions: their choice represents the primary organizing principle of the enterprise. This may coincide with the management segment used in segment reporting.\n\nOracle Fusion Applications supports a qualified management segment and recommends that you use this segment to represent your hierarchy of business units and divisions. If managers of divisions have return on investment goals, make the management segment a balancing segment. Oracle Fusion applications allows up to three balancing segments. The values of the management segment can be comprised of business units that roll up in a hierarchy to report by division.\n\nHistorically, divisions were implemented as a node in a hierarchy of segment values. For example, Oracle E-Business Suite has only one balancing segment, and often the division and legal entity are combined into a single segment where each value stands for both division and legal entity.\n\nUse of Divisions in Oracle Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM)\n\nDivisions are used in HCM to define the management organization hierarchy, using the generic organization hierarchy. This hierarchy can be used to create organization based security profiles.\n\nLegal Entities: Explained\n\nA legal entity is a recognized party with rights and responsibilities given by legislation.\n\nLegal entities have the right to own property, the right to trade, the responsibility to repay debt, and the responsibility to account for themselves to regulators, taxation authorities, and owners according to rules specified in the relevant legislation. Their rights and responsibilities may be enforced through the judicial system. Define a legal entity for each registered company or other entity recognized in law for which you want to record assets, liabilities, and income, pay transaction taxes, or perform intercompany trading.\n\nA legal entity has responsibility for elements of your enterprise for the following reasons:\n\nFacilitating local compliance\n\nTaking advantage of lower corporation taxation in some jurisdictions\n\nPreparing for acquisitions or disposals of parts of the enterprise\n\nIsolating one area of the business from risks in another area. For example, your enterprise develops property and also leases properties. You could operate the property development business as a separate legal entity to limit risk to your leasing business.\n\nThe Role of Your Legal Entities\n\nIn configuring your enterprise structure in Oracle Fusion Applications, you need to understand that the contracting party on any transaction is always the legal entity. Individual legal entities own the assets of the enterprise, record sales and pay taxes on those sales, make purchases and incur expenses, and perform other transactions.\n\nLegal entities must comply with the regulations of jurisdictions, in which they register. Europe now allows for companies to register in one member country and do business in all member countries, and the US allows for companies to register in one state and do business in all states. To support local reporting requirements, legal reporting units are created and registered.\n\nYou are required to publish specific and periodic disclosures of your legal entities' operations based on different jurisdictions' requirements. Certain annual or more frequent accounting reports are referred to as statutory or external reporting. These reports must be filed with specified national and regulatory authorities. For example, in the United States (US), your publicly owned entities (corporations) are required to file quarterly and annual reports, as well as other periodic reports, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who enforces statutory reporting requirements for public corporations.\n\nIndividual entities privately held or held by public companies do not have to file separately. In other countries, your individual entities do have to file in their own name, as well as at the public group level. Disclosure requirements are diverse. For example, your local entities may have to file locally to comply with local regulations in a local currency, as well as being included in your enterprise's reporting requirements in different currency.\n\nA legal entity can represent all or part of your enterprise's management framework. For example, if you operate in a large country such as the United Kingdom or Germany, you might incorporate each division in the country as a separate legal entity. In a smaller country, for example Austria, you might use a single legal entity to host all of your business operations across divisions.\n\nCreating Legal Entities in the Enterprise Structures Configurator: Points to Consider\n\nUsing the Enterprise Structures Configurator (ESC), you can create legal entities for your enterprise automatically, based on the countries in which divisions of your business operate, or you can upload a list of legal entities from a spreadsheet.\n\nAutomatically Creating Legal Entities\n\nIf you are not certain of the number of legal entities that you need, you can create them automatically. To use this option, you first identify all of the countries in which your enterprise operates. The application opens the Map Divisions by Country page, which contains a matrix of the countries that you identified, your enterprise, and the divisions that you created. You select the check boxes where your enterprise and divisions intersect with the countries to identify the legal entities that you want the application to create. The enterprise is included for situations where your enterprise operates in a country and acts on behalf of several divisions within the enterprise and is a legal employer in a country. If you select the enterprise for a country, the application creates a country holding company.\n\nThe application automatically creates the legal entities that you select, and identifies them as payroll statutory units and legal employers. For each country that you indicated that your enterprise operates in, and for each country that you created a location for, the application also automatically creates a legislative data group.\n\nAny legal entities that you create automatically cannot be deleted from the Create Legal Entities page within the Enterprise Structures Configurator. You must return to the Map Divisions by Country page and deselect the legal entities that you no longer want.\n\nExample: Creating Legal Entities Automatically\n\nInFusion Corporation is using the ESC to set up their enterprise structure. They have identified two divisions, one for Lighting, and one for Security. The Lighting division operates in Japan and the US, and the Security division operates in the UK and India.\n\nThis figure illustrates InFusion Corporation's enterprise structure.\n\nThis table represents the selections that InFusion Corporation makes when specifying which legal entities to create on the Map Divisions by Country page.\n\nCountry\n\nEnterprise\n\nInFusion Lighting\n\nInFusion Security\n\nJapan\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nUS\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nUK\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nIndia\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nBased on the selections made in the preceding table, the ESC creates the following four legal entities:\n\nInFusion Lighting Japan LE\n\nInFusion Lighting US LE\n\nInFusion Security UK LE\n\nInFusion Security India LE\n\nCreating Legal Entities Using a Spreadsheet\n\nIf you have a list of legal entities already defined for your enterprise, you can upload them from a spreadsheet. To use this option, you first download a spreadsheet template, then add your legal entity information to the spreadsheet, and then upload directly to your enterprise configuration. You can export and import the spreadsheet multiple times to accommodate revisions.\n\nLegal Entity in Oracle Fusion: Points to Consider\n\nOracle Fusion Applications support the modeling of your legal entities. If you make purchases from or sell to other legal entities, define these other legal entities in your customer and supplier registers, which are part of the Oracle Fusion Trading Community Architecture. When your legal entities are trading with each other, you represent both of them as legal entities and also as customers and suppliers in your customer and supplier registers. Use legal entity relationships to determine which transactions are intercompany and require intercompany accounting. Your legal entities can be identified as legal employers and therefore, are available for use in Human Capital Management (HCM) applications.\n\nThere are several decisions that need to be considered in creating your legal entities.\n\nThe importance of legal entity in transactions\n\nLegal entity and its relationship to business units\n\nLegal entity and its relationship to divisions\n\nLegal entity and its relationship to ledgers\n\nLegal entity and its relationship to balancing segments\n\nLegal entity and its relationship to consolidation rules\n\nLegal entity and its relationship to intercompany transactions\n\nLegal entity and its relationship to worker assignments and legal employer\n\nLegal entity and payroll reporting\n\nLegal reporting units\n\nThe Importance of Legal Entity in Transactions\n\nAll of the assets of the enterprise are owned by individual legal entities. Oracle Fusion Financials allow your users to enter legal entities on transactions that represent a movement in value or obligation.\n\nFor example, the creation of a sales order creates an obligation for the legal entity that books the order to deliver the goods on the acknowledged date, and an obligation of the purchaser to receive and pay for those goods. Under contract law in most countries, damages can be sought for both actual losses, putting the injured party in the same state as if they had not entered into the contract, and what is called loss of bargain, or the profit that would have made on a transaction.\n\nIn another example, if you revalued your inventory in a warehouse to account for raw material price increases, the revaluation and revaluation reserves must be reflected in your legal entity's accounts. In Oracle Fusion Applications, your inventory within an inventory organization is managed by a single business unit and belongs to one legal entity.\n\nLegal Entity and Its Relationship to Business Units\n\nA business unit can process transactions on behalf of many legal entities. Frequently, a business unit is part of a single legal entity. In most cases the legal entity is explicit on your transactions. For example, a payables invoice has an explicit legal entity field. Your accounts payables department can process supplier invoices on behalf of one or many business units.\n\nIn some cases, your legal entity is inferred from your business unit that is processing the transaction. For example, your business unit A agrees on terms for the transfer of inventory to your business unit B. This transaction is binding on your default legal entities assigned to each business unit. Oracle Fusion Procurement, Oracle Fusion Projects, and Oracle Fusion Supply Chain applications rely on deriving the legal entity information from the business unit.\n\nLegal Entity and Its Relationship to Divisions\n\nThe division is an area of management responsibility that can correspond to a collection of legal entities. If desired, you can aggregate the results for your divisions by legal entity or by combining parts of other legal entities. Define date-effective hierarchies for your cost center or legal entity segment in your chart of accounts to facilitate the aggregation and reporting by division. Divisions and legal entities are independent concepts.\n\nLegal Entity and Its Relationship to Ledgers\n\nOne of your major responsibilities is to file financial statements for your legal entities. Map legal entities to specific ledgers using the Oracle Fusion General Ledger Accounting Configuration Manager. Within a ledger, you can optionally map a legal entity to one or more balancing segment values.\n\nLegal Entity and Its Relationship to Balancing Segments\n\nOracle Fusion General Ledger supports up to three balancing segments, Best practices recommend that one of these segments represents your legal entity to ease your requirement to account for your operations to regulatory agencies, tax authorities, and investors. Accounting for your operations means you must produce a balanced trial balance sheet by legal entity. If you account for many legal entities in a single ledger, you must:\n\nIdentify the legal entities within the ledger\n\nBalance transactions that cross legal entity boundaries through intercompany transactions\n\nDecide which balancing segments correspond to each legal entity and assign them in Oracle Fusion General Ledger Accounting Configuration Manager. Once you assign one balancing segment value in a ledger, then all your balancing segment values must be assigned. This recommended best practice facilitates reporting on assets, liabilities, and income by legal entity.\n\nRepresent your legal entities by at least one balancing segment value. You may represent it by two or three balancing segment values if more granular reporting is required. For example, if your legal entity operates in multiple jurisdictions in Europe, you might define balancing segment values and map them to legal reporting units. You can represent a legal entity by more than one balancing segment value, do not use a single balancing segment value to represent more than one legal entity.\n\nIn Oracle Fusion General Ledger, there are three balancing segments. You can use separate balancing segments to represent your divisions or strategic business units to enable management reporting at the balance sheet level for each division or business unit. For example, use this solution to empower your business unit and divisional managers to track and assume responsibility for their asset utilization or return on investment. Using multiple balancing segments is also useful when you know at the time of implementation that you are disposing of a part of a legal entity and need to isolate the assets and liabilities for that entity.\n\nNote\n\nImplementing multiple balancing segments requires every journal entry that is not balanced by division or business unit, to generate balancing lines. Also, you cannot change to multiple balancing segments easily after you have begun to use the ledger because your historical data is not balanced by the new multiple balancing segments. Restating historical data must be done at that point.\n\nTo use this feature for disposal of a part of a legal entity, implement multiple balancing segments at the beginning of the legal entity's corporate life or on conversion to Oracle Fusion.\n\nIf you decided to account for each legal entity in a separate ledger, there is no requirement to identify the legal entity with a balancing segment value within the ledger.\n\nLegal Entity and Its Relationship to Consolidation Rules\n\nIn Oracle Fusion Applications you can map legal entities to balancing segments and then define consolidation rules using your balancing segments. You are creating a relationship between the definition of your legal entities and their role in your consolidation.\n\nLegal Entity and its Relationship to Intercompany Transactions\n\nUse Oracle Fusion Intercompany functionality for automatic creation of intercompany entries across your balancing segments. Intercompany processing updates legal ownership within the enterprise's groups of legal entities. Invoices or journals are created as needed. To limit the number of trading pairs for your enterprise, set up intercompany organizations and assign then to your authorized legal entities. Define processing options and intercompany accounts to use when creating intercompany transactions and to assist in consolidation elimination entries. These accounts are derived and automatically entered on your intercompany transactions based on legal entities assigned to your intercompany organizations.\n\nIntracompany trading, in which legal ownership isn't changed but other organizational responsibilities are, is also supported. For example, you can track assets and liabilities that move between your departments within your legal entities by creating departmental level intercompany organizations.\n\nLegal Entity and Its Relationship to Worker Assignments and Legal Employer\n\nLegal entities that employ people are called legal employers in the Oracle Fusion Legal Entity Configurator. You must enter legal employers on worker assignments in Oracle Fusion HCM.\n\nLegal Entity and Payroll Reporting\n\nYour legal entities are required to pay payroll tax and social insurance such as social security on your payroll. In Oracle Fusion Applications, you can register payroll statutory units to pay and report on payroll tax and social insurance on behalf of many of your legal entities. As the legal employer, you might be required to pay payroll tax, not only at the national level, but also at the local level. You meet this obligation by establishing your legal entity as a place of work within the jurisdiction of a local authority. Set up legal reporting units to represent the part of your enterprise with a specific legal reporting obligation. You can also mark these legal reporting units as tax reporting units if the legal entity must pay taxes as a result of establishing a place of business within the jurisdiction.\n\nBusiness Units: Explained\n\nA business unit is a unit of an enterprise that performs one or many business functions that can be rolled up in a management hierarchy. A business unit can process transactions on behalf of many legal entities. Normally, it will have a manager, strategic objectives, a level of autonomy, and responsibility for its profit and loss. Roll business units up into divisions if you structure your chart of accounts with this type of hierarchy. In Oracle Fusion Applications, you assign your business units to one primary ledger. For example, if a business unit is processing payables invoices they will need to post to a particular ledger. This assignment is mandatory for your business units with business functions that produce financial transactions.\n\nIn Oracle Fusion Applications, use business unit as a securing mechanism for transactions. For example, if you run your export business separately from your domestic sales business, secure the export business data to prevent access by the domestic sales employees. To accomplish this security, set up the export business and domestic sales business as two separate business units.\n\nThe Oracle Fusion Applications business unit model:\n\nAllows for flexible implementation\n\nProvides a consistent entity for controlling and reporting on transactions\n\nAnchors the sharing of sets of reference data across applications\n\nBusiness units process transactions using reference data sets that reflect your business rules and policies and can differ from country to country. With Oracle Fusion Application functionality, you can choose to share reference data, such as payment terms and transaction types, across business units, or you can choose to have each business unit manage its own set depending on the level at which you wish to enforce common policies.\n\nIn countries where gapless and chronological sequencing of documents is required for subledger transactions, define your business units in alignment with your ledger definition, because the uniqueness of sequencing is only ensured within a ledger. In these cases, define a single ledger and assign one legal entity and business unit.\n\nIn summary, use business units in the following ways:\n\nManagement reporting\n\nProcessing of transactions\n\nSecurity of transactional data\n\nReference data definition and sharing\n\nBrief Overview of Business Unit Security\n\nBusiness units are used by a number of Oracle Fusion Applications to implement data security. You assign data roles to your users to give them access to data in business units and permit them to perform specific functions on this data. When a business function is enabled for a business unit, the application can trigger the creation of data roles for this business unit base on the business function's related job roles.\n\nFor example, if a payables invoicing business function is enabled, then it is clear that there are employees in this business unit that perform the function of payables invoicing, and need access to the payables invoicing functionality. Therefore, based on the correspondence between the business function and the job roles, appropriate data roles are generated automatically. Use Human Capital Management (HCM) security profiles to administer security for employees in business units.\n\nCreating Business Units in the Enterprise Structures Configurator: Points to Consider\n\nBusiness units are used within Oracle Fusion applications for management reporting, processing of transactions, and security of transactional data. Using the Enterprise Structures Configurator (ESC), you create business units for your enterprise either automatically or manually.\n\nAutomatically Creating Business Units\n\nTo create business units automatically, you must specify the level at which to create business units. Business units within your enterprise may be represented at the business function level, such as Sales, Consulting, Product Development, and so on, or they may be represented at a more detailed level, where a business unit exists for each combination of countries in which you operate and the functions in those countries.\n\nYou can automatically create business units at the following levels:\n\nCountry\n\nCountry and Division\n\nCountry and business function\n\nDivision\n\nDivision and legal entity\n\nDivision and business function\n\nBusiness function\n\nLegal entity\n\nBusiness function and legal entity\n\nSelect the option that best meets your business requirements, but consider the following:\n\nIf you use Oracle Fusion Financials, the legal entity option is recommended because of the manner in which financial transactions are processed.\n\nThe business unit level that you select determines how the application automatically creates reference data sets.\n\nAfter you select a business unit level, the application generates a list of business units, and you select the ones you want the application to create. If you select a level that has two components, such as country and division, then the system displays a table listing both components, and you select the check boxes at the intersections of the components.\n\nThe business units listed by the application are suggestions only, and are meant to simplify the process to create business units. You are not required to select all of the business units suggested. When you navigate to the next page in the ESC guided flow, which is the Manage Business Units page, you cannot delete any of the business units that were created automatically. You must return to the Create Business Units page and deselect any business units that you no longer want.\n\nExample: Selecting Business Unit Levels\n\nInFusion Corporation is using the Enterprise Structures Configurator to set up their enterprise structure. They have identified two divisions, one for Lighting, and one for Security. They operate in four countries: US, UK, Japan, and India, and they have created a legal entity for each of the countries. The sales and marketing functions are based in both India and Japan, while the US and the UK have only the sales function.\n\nThis figure illustrates InFusion Corporation's enterprise structure.\n\nThe following table lists the options for business unit levels and the resulting business units that the application suggests for InFusion Corporation.\n\nBusiness Unit Level\n\nSuggested Business Units\n\nCountry\n\nUS\n\nUK\n\nJapan\n\nIndia\n\nCountry and Division\n\nInFusion Lighting: Japan\n\nInFusion Lighting: US\n\nInfusion Security: UK\n\nInfusion Security: India\n\nCountry and business function\n\nSales: Japan\n\nMarketing: Japan\n\nSales: US\n\nSales: UK\n\nMarketing: India\n\nSales: India\n\nDivision\n\nInFusion Lighting\n\nInFusion Security\n\nDivision and Legal Entity\n\nInFusion Lighting: Japan\n\nInFusion Lighting: US\n\nInfusion Security: UK\n\nInfusion Security: India\n\nDivision and Business Function\n\nInFusion Lighting, Sales\n\nInFusion Lighting, Marketing\n\nInFusion Security, Sales\n\nInFusion Security, Marketing\n\nBusiness Function\n\nSales\n\nMarketing\n\nLegal Entity\n\nLegal Entity: Japan\n\nLegal Entity: US\n\nLegal Entity: UK\n\nLegal Entity India\n\nLegal Entity and Business Function\n\nLegal Entity: Japan, Sales\n\nLegal Entity: Japan, Marketing\n\nLegal Entity: US, Sales\n\nLegal Entity: UK, Sales\n\nLegal Entity India, Marketing\n\nLegal Entity India, Sales\n\nManually Creating Business Units\n\nIf none of the levels for creating business units meets your business needs, you can create business units manually, and you create them on the Manage Business Units page. If you create business units manually, then no reference data sets are created automatically. You must create them manually as well.\n\nReference Data Sets and Sharing Methods: Explained\n\nOracle Fusion Applications reference data sharing feature is also known as SetID. The reference data sharing functionality supports operations in multiple ledgers, business units, and warehouses, thereby reducing the administrative burden and decreasing the time needed to implement new business units. For example, you can share sales methods, transaction types, or payment terms across business units or selected other data across asset books, cost organizations, or project units.\n\nThe reference data sharing features use reference data sets to which reference data is assigned. The reference data sets group assigned reference data. The sets can be understood as buckets of reference data assigned to multiple business units or other application components.\n\nReference Data Sets\n\nYou begin this part of your implementation by creating and assigning reference data to sets. Make changes carefully as changes to a particular set will affect all business units or application components using that set. You can assign a separate set to each business unit for the type of object that is being shared. For example, assign separate sets for payment terms, transaction types, and sales methods to your business units.\n\nYour enterprise can decide that some aspects of corporate policy should affect all business units and leave other aspects to the discretion of the business unit manager. This allows your enterprise to balance autonomy and control for each business unit. For example, if your enterprise holds business unit managers accountable for their profit and loss, but manages working capital requirements at a corporate level, you can let managers define their own sales methods, but define payment terms centrally. In this case, each business unit would have its own reference data set for sales methods, and there would be one central reference data set for payment terms assigned to all business units.\n\nThe reference data sharing is especially valuable for lowering the cost of setting up new business units. For example, your enterprise operates in the hospitality industry. You are adding a new business unit to track your new spa services. The hospitality divisional reference data set can be assigned to the new business unit to quickly setup data for this entity component. You can establish other business unit reference data in a business unit specific reference data set as needed\n\nReference Data Sharing Methods\n\nThere are variations in the methods used to share data in reference data sets across different types of objects. The following list identifies the methods:\n\nAssignment to one set only, no common values allowed. The simplest form of sharing reference data that allows assigning a reference data object instance to one and only one set. For example, Asset Prorate Conventions are defined and assigned to only one reference data set. This set can be shared across multiple asset books, but all the values are contained only in this one set.\n\nAssignment to one set only, with common values. The most commonly used method of sharing reference data that allows defining reference data object instance across all sets. For example, Receivables Transaction Types are assigned to a common set that is available to all the business units without the need to be explicitly assigned the transaction types to each business unit. In addition, you can assign a business unit specific set of transaction types. At transaction entry, the list of values for transaction types includes transaction types from the set assigned to the business unit, as well as transaction types assigned to the common set that is shared across all business units.\n\nAssignment to multiple sets, no common values allowed. The method of sharing reference data that allows a reference data object instance to be assigned to multiple sets. For instance, Payables Payment Terms use this method. It means that each payment term can be assigned to one or more than one set. For example, you assign the payment term Net 30 to several sets, but the payment term Net 15 is assigned to only your corporate business unit specific set. At transaction entry, the list of values for payment terms consists of only one set of data; the set that is assigned to the transaction's business unit.\n\nNote: Oracle Fusion Applications contains a reference data set called Enterprise. Define any reference data that affects your entire enterprise in this set.\n\nBusiness Units and Reference Data Sets: How They Work Together\n\nReference data sharing is a feature within Oracle Fusion that enables you to group set-enabled reference data such as jobs or grades so that the data can be shared across different parts of the organization. Sets also enable you to filter reference data at the transaction level so that only data that has been assigned to certain sets is available to select. To filter reference data, Oracle Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM), applications use the business unit on the transaction. To set up reference data sharing in Oracle Fusion HCM, you create business units and sets, and then assign the sets to the business units.\n\nCommon Set Versus Specific Sets\n\nSome reference data in your organization may be considered global, and should therefore be made available for use within the entire enterprise. You can assign this type of data to the Common Set, which is a predefined set. Regardless of the business unit on a transaction, reference data that has been assigned to the Common Set will always be available, in addition to the reference data that has been assigned to the set that corresponds to the business unit on the transaction.\n\nOther types of reference data may be specific to certain business units, so you want to restrict the use of the data to those business units. In this case, you can create sets specifically for this type of data, and assign the sets to the business units.\n\nBusiness Unit Set Assignment\n\nWhen you assign reference data sets to business units, you assign a default reference data set that will be used for all reference data types for that business unit. You can override the set assignment for one or more data types.\n\nExample: Assigning Sets to Business Units\n\nInFusion Corporation has two divisions: Lighting and Security, and the divisions each have two locations. Each location has one or more business functions.\n\nThe following figure illustrates the structure of InFusion Corporation.\n\nWhen deciding how to create business units, InFusion decides to create them using the country and business function level. Therefore, they created the following business units:\n\nSales_Japan\n\nMarketing_Japan\n\nSales_US\n\nSales_UK\n\nMarketing_India\n\nSales_India\n\nBecause locations, departments, and grades are specific to each business unit, InFusion does not want to share these types of reference data across business units. They will create a reference data set for each business unit so that data of those types can be set up separately. Because the jobs in the Sales business function are the same across many locations, InFusion decides to create one additional set called Jobs and they will override the set assignment for the Jobs reference data group and assign it to the Jobs set. Based on these requirements, they create the following sets:\n\nSales_Japan_Set\n\nMktg_Japan_Set\n\nSales_US_Set\n\nSales_UK_Set\n\nMktg_India_Set\n\nSales_India_Set\n\nGrades_Set\n\nInFusion assigns business units to sets as follows:\n\nWhen setting up grades, departments, and locations for the business units, InFusion will assign the data to the default set for each business unit. When setting up jobs, they will assign the Jobs set and will assign the Common Set to any jobs that may be used throughout the entire organization.\n\nWhen using grades, departments, and locations at the transaction level, users will be able to select data from the set that corresponds to the business unit that they enter on the transaction, and any data that was assigned to the Common Set. For example, for transactions for the Marketing_Japan business unit, grades, locations, and departments from the Mktg_Japan_Set will be available to select, as well as from the Common Set.\n\nWhen using jobs at the transaction level, users will be able to select jobs from the Jobs set and from the Common Set when they enter one of the Sales business units on the transaction. For example, when a manager hires an employee for the Sales_India business unit, the list of jobs will be filtered to show jobs from the Jobs set and from the Common Set.\n\nThe following figure illustrates what sets of jobs can be accessed when a manager creates an assignment for a worker.\n\nCreating Reference Data Sets in the Enterprise Structures Configurator: Explained\n\nIf you created business units automatically, then the Enterprise Structures Configurator automatically creates reference data sets for you. The Enterprise Structures Configurator creates one reference data set for each business unit. You can add additional sets, but you cannot delete any of the sets that were created automatically.\n\nA standard set called the Enterprise set is predefined.\n\nCommon Set\n\nThe common set is a predefined set that enables you to share reference data across business units. When you select set-enabled data at the transaction level, the list of values includes data in both the common set and the set associated with the data type for the business unit on the transaction. For example, when you create an assignment, the list of values for grades will include both grades in the common set and in the set that is assigned to grades for the business unit in which you creating the assignment.\n\nJobs and Positions: Critical Choices\n\nJobs and positions represent roles that enable you to distinguish between tasks and the individuals who perform those tasks. The key to whether to use jobs or positions is how each is used. Positions offer a well-defined space independent of the person performing the job. Jobs are a space defined by the person. A job can be defined globally in the Common Set, whereas a position is defined within one business unit.\n\nYou can update the job and department of a position at any time. This is useful if you hire someone into a new role and want to transfer the position to another department.\n\nDuring implementation, one of the earliest decisions you will make is whether to use jobs or a combination of jobs and positions. The determinants for this decision are:\n\nThe primary industry of your enterprise\n\nHow you manage your people\n\nPrimary Industry of Your Enterprise\n\nPrimary industries and how they usually set up their workforce are listed in the table below.\n\nManagement of People\n\nThe following table displays suggestions of whether to use jobs or a combination of jobs and positions based on your industry and how you manage your employees when there is turnover.\n\nPositions: Examples\n\nPositions are typically used by industries that use detailed approval rules, which perform detailed budgeting and maintain head counts, or have high turnover rates.\n\nRetail Industry\n\nABC Corporation has high turnover. It loses approximately 5% of their cashiers monthly. The job of cashier includes three positions: front line cashier, service desk cashier, and layaway cashier. Each job is cross trained to take over another cashier position. When one cashier leaves from any of the positions, another existing cashier from the front line, service desk or layaway can assist where needed. . But to ensure short lines and customer satisfaction, ABC must replace each cashier lost to turnover.\n\nSince turnover is high in retail it is better for this industry to use positions. There is an automatic vacancy when an employee terminates employment. The position exists even when there are no holders. This is important if the person who leaves the company is a manager or supervisor with direct reports. All direct reports continue reporting to the position even if it is empty. You do not need to reassign these employees to another manager or supervisor; the replacement manager is assigned to the existing position.\n\nAlso, an advantage to using positions is that when you hire somebody new many of the attributes are defaulted in from the position. This speeds up the hiring process.\n\nThis figure illustrates the retail position setup.\n\nHealth Care Industry\n\nThe hospital has a structured head count and detailed budgeting. For example, a specific number of surgeons, nurses, and interns of various types are needed. These positions need to be filled in order for the hospital to run smoothly. Use jobs and positions if you need to apply detailed head count rules.\n\nHealth care is an industry that needs to regulate employment, roles, and compensation according to strict policies and procedures. Fixed roles tend to endure over time, surviving multiple incumbents. Industries that manage roles rather than individuals, where roles continue to exist after individuals leave, typically model the workforce using positions.\n\nThis figure illustrates the hospital position setup.\n\nJobs: Example\n\nJobs are typically used without positions by service industries where flexibility and organizational change are key features.\n\nSoftware Industry\n\nFor example, XYZ Corporation has a director over the departments for developers, quality assurance, and technical writers. Recently, three developers have left the company. The director decides to redirect the head count to other areas. Instead of hiring all three back into development, one person is hired to each department, quality assurance, and technical writing.\n\nIn software industries, the organization is fluid. Using jobs gives an enterprise the flexibility to determine where to use head count, because the job only exists through the person performing it. In this example, when the three developers leave XYZ Corporation, their jobs no longer exist, therefore the corporation has the flexibility to move the headcount to other areas.\n\nThis figure illustrates the software industry job setup.\n\nJob and Position Structures: Explained\n\nJob and position structures identify the descriptive flexfield structure that enables you to specify additional attributes that you want to capture when you define jobs and positions. Job and position attributes provide further detail to make jobs and positions more specific. You also use attributes to define the structure of your jobs and positions. You can specify attributes at the enterprise level for jobs and positions, at the business unit level for positions, and at the reference data set level for jobs. Job and position structures are optional.\n\nEnterprise-Level Job Attributes\n\nWhen you define a job, you enter a value for the name of the job. To make job names more specific, set up attributes that enable you to identify additional details about the job, such as the nature of the work that is performed or the relative skill level required for the job. If these attributes apply to all jobs within your enterprise, set up enterprise-level job attributes. Standard capabilities mean that you can use the different segments of the name to identify common jobs or job holders for analysis or compensation, or for grouping records in reports, for example, to find all jobs of a specific job type. You should not use attributes with values that change regularly, for example, salary ranges or expense approval levels that change every year.\n\nThis figure illustrates how job type and job level provide further details for the HR Application Specialist job.\n\nEnterprise-Level Position Attributes\n\nPosition attributes at the enterprise level are similar to those for jobs. Each position that you define identifies a specific role in the enterprise, which you can manage independently of the person in the position, and it will belong to one specific department or organization. The name of each position must be unique. To simplify the process of managing unique names for positions, set up enterprise-level attributes to identify separate components of the position name. For example, you can set up an attribute for position title and one for position number. When defining the attributes that make up the structure of a position name you should also consider if any of your attributes are part of the definition of a common job type. Using job types for a position can help you manage common information that applies to many different positions. For example you can define a job type of Manager.Level 1 and use this for comparison of positions across departments or lines or business, or for setting common job requirements. You can then define multiple manager type positions in your HR department, each of which has responsibility for a different management function or group.\n\nThis figure illustrates how title and position number provide further details for the manager position.\n\nBusiness Unit-Level Attributes for Positions\n\nIf you have information that you want to capture for positions that is specific to each business unit, then you can define attributes at the business unit level for positions. When you create positions, these attributes appear in addition to any enterprise-level attributes. For example, you may want to identify the sales region for all positions in the sales business unit. You can set up a text attribute called Sales Region and use it to enter the necessary information when creating positions for the sales business unit.\n\nReference Data Set-Level Attributes for Jobs\n\nIf you have information for jobs that applies to specific reference data sets, set up attributes for jobs at the reference data set level. When you create jobs, these attributes appear in addition to any enterprise-level attributes. For example, you may want to identify all information technology (IT) jobs within a specific set. You can set up a text attribute called Function and use it to enter IT in jobs that you create that perform an IT function within a specific set.\n\nFAQs for Define Initial Configuration\n\nWhat happens if I don't use the Enterprise Structures Configurator to set up my enterprise structures?\n\nThe Enterprise Structures Configurator is an interview-based tool that guides you through setting up divisions, legal entities, business units, and reference data sets. The tool also enables you to assign reference data sets to business units and locations. You can set up multiple configurations to perform what-if scenarios, and then print each configuration to compare the resulting enterprise structure. If you do not use the Enterprise Structures Configurator, then you must set up your enterprise structure using the individual tasks that correspond to each enterprise component. In addition, you will not be able to set up multiple configurations and compare different scenarios. It is recommended that you use the Enterprise Structures Configurator.\n\nWhat's an ultimate holding company?\n\nThe legal entity that represents the top level in your organization hierarchy, as defined by the legal name entered for the enterprise. This designation is used only to create an organization tree, with the ultimate holding company as the top level, divisions and country holding companies as the second level, and legal employers as the third level.\n\nWhat's the default reference data set?\n\nThe reference data set that is assigned to a business unit for all reference data groups, such as grades, locations, departments, and jobs. You can override the default reference data set for any reference data group.\n\nWhat happens if I override the set assignment?\n\nFor the selected business unit, you can override the default reference data set for one or more reference data groups. For example, assume you have three reference data groups: Vision 1 SET, Vision 2 SET, and Vision 3 SET, where Vision SET 1 is the default set for business unit United Kingdom Vision 1 BU. You can override the default so that grades are assigned to Vision 2 SET, departments are assigned to Vision 3 SET, and jobs are assigned to the default set, Vision 3 SET.\n\nDefine Reference Data Sharing\n\nReference Data Sharing: Explained\n\nReference data sharing facilitates sharing of configuration data such as jobs and payment terms, across organizational divisions or business units. You define reference data sets and determine how the data is shared or partitioned. Use reference data sets to reduce duplication and maintenance by sharing common data across business entities where appropriate. Depending on the requirement (specific or common), each business unit can maintain its data at a central location, using a set of values either specific to it or shared by other business units.\n\nYou can share reference data after it is filtered on the basis of sets. A common reference data set is available as the default set, which can be assigned to several business units sharing the same reference data. For commonly used data such as currencies, you can use the common reference data set and assign it to multiple business units in various countries that use the same currency. In cases where the default set cannot be assigned to an entity, you can create specific sets. The data set visible on the transactional page depends on the sharing method used to share reference data.\n\nFor example, XYZ Corporation uses the same grades throughout the entire organization. Instead of managers in different business units setting up the same grades, XYZ Corporation decides to create a set called Grades and assign the grades reference data group for all business units in the organization to the Grades set, so that the grades can be shared.\n\nReference Data Sets: Explained\n\nReference data sets are logical groups of reference data that can be accessed by various transactional entities depending on the business context. Oracle Fusion Applications contains a common reference data set as well as an enterprise set that may be used as a default set. Depending on your business requirement you can create and maintain additional reference data sets, while continuing to use the common reference data set.\n\nConsider the following scenario.\n\nYour enterprise can decide that some aspects of corporate policy should affect all business units and leave other aspects to the discretion of the business unit manager. This allows your enterprise to balance autonomy and control for each business unit. For example, if your enterprise holds business unit managers accountable for their profit and loss, but manages working capital requirements at a corporate level, you can let managers define their own sales methods, but define payment terms centrally. In this case, each business unit would have its own reference data set for sales methods, and there would be one central reference data set for payment terms assigned to all business units.\n\nPartitioning\n\nThe partitioning of reference data and creation of data sets enable you to create reference entities across tables or lookup types, and share modular information and data processing options among business units. With the help of partitioning, you can choose to create separate sets and subsets for each business unit depending upon its business requirement, or create common sets or subsets to enable sharing reference data between several business units, without the need for duplicating the reference data. Partitioning provides you the flexibility to handle the reference data in a way appropriate to your business needs.\n\nThe following figure illustrates the reference data sharing method (assignment to one set only, with common values) where the user can access the data assigned to a specific set in a particular business unit, as well as access the data assigned to the common set.\n\nReference Data Sets and Sharing Methods: Explained\n\nOracle Fusion Applications reference data sharing feature is also known as SetID. The reference data sharing functionality supports operations in multiple ledgers, business units, and warehouses, thereby reducing the administrative burden and decreasing the time needed to implement new business units. For example, you can share sales methods, transaction types, or payment terms across business units or selected other data across asset books, cost organizations, or project units.\n\nThe reference data sharing features use reference data sets to which reference data is assigned. The reference data sets group assigned reference data. The sets can be understood as buckets of reference data assigned to multiple business units or other application components.\n\nReference Data Sets\n\nYou begin this part of your implementation by creating and assigning reference data to sets. Make changes carefully as changes to a particular set will affect all business units or application components using that set. You can assign a separate set to each business unit for the type of object that is being shared. For example, assign separate sets for payment terms, transaction types, and sales methods to your business units.\n\nYour enterprise can decide that some aspects of corporate policy should affect all business units and leave other aspects to the discretion of the business unit manager. This allows your enterprise to balance autonomy and control for each business unit. For example, if your enterprise holds business unit managers accountable for their profit and loss, but manages working capital requirements at a corporate level, you can let managers define their own sales methods, but define payment terms centrally. In this case, each business unit would have its own reference data set for sales methods, and there would be one central reference data set for payment terms assigned to all business units.\n\nThe reference data sharing is especially valuable for lowering the cost of setting up new business units. For example, your enterprise operates in the hospitality industry. You are adding a new business unit to track your new spa services. The hospitality divisional reference data set can be assigned to the new business unit to quickly setup data for this entity component. You can establish other business unit reference data in a business unit specific reference data set as needed\n\nReference Data Sharing Methods\n\nThere are variations in the methods used to share data in reference data sets across different types of objects. The following list identifies the methods:\n\nAssignment to one set only, no common values allowed. The simplest form of sharing reference data that allows assigning a reference data object instance to one and only one set. For example, Asset Prorate Conventions are defined and assigned to only one reference data set. This set can be shared across multiple asset books, but all the values are contained only in this one set.\n\nAssignment to one set only, with common values. The most commonly used method of sharing reference data that allows defining reference data object instance across all sets. For example, Receivables Transaction Types are assigned to a common set that is available to all the business units without the need to be explicitly assigned the transaction types to each business unit. In addition, you can assign a business unit specific set of transaction types. At transaction entry, the list of values for transaction types includes transaction types from the set assigned to the business unit, as well as transaction types assigned to the common set that is shared across all business units.\n\nAssignment to multiple sets, no common values allowed. The method of sharing reference data that allows a reference data object instance to be assigned to multiple sets. For instance, Payables Payment Terms use this method. It means that each payment term can be assigned to one or more than one set. For example, you assign the payment term Net 30 to several sets, but the payment term Net 15 is assigned to only your corporate business unit specific set. At transaction entry, the list of values for payment terms consists of only one set of data; the set that is assigned to the transaction's business unit.\n\nNote: Oracle Fusion Applications contains a reference data set called Enterprise. Define any reference data that affects your entire enterprise in this set.\n\nAssigning Reference Data Sets to Reference Objects: Points to Consider\n\nYou can assign the reference data sets to reference objects on the Manage Reference Data Set Assignments page. For multiple assignments, you can classify different types of reference data sets into groups and assign them to reference entity objects. The assignment takes into consideration the determinant type, determinant, and reference group, if any.\n\nDeterminant Types\n\nThe partitioned reference data is shared based on a business context setting called the determinant type. It is the point of reference used in the data assignment process. The following table lists the determinant types used in the reference data assignment.\n\nDeterminant\n\nThe determinant or determinant value is the value that corresponds to the selected determinant type. The determinant is one of the criteria for selecting the appropriate reference data set. For example, when managing set assignments for the set determinant type, Reference Data Set is the determinant type, and you would enter the corresponding set code value as the corresponding determinant value.\n\nReference Groups\n\nA transactional entity may have multiple reference entities (generally considered to be setup data) that are treated in the same manner because of commonness in implementing business policies and legal rules. Such reference entities in your application are grouped into logical units called reference groups, based on the functional area and the partitioning requirements that they have in common. For example, all tables and views that define Sales Order Type details might be part of the same reference group.\n\nProduct Specific Reference Data Sharing: Explained\n\nSome products required special logic for reference data sharing and have implemented their own domain specific ways for sharing data.\n\nItems and supplier sites are two such product specific reference data objects that use product specific mechanisms to share data.\n\nItems\n\nIf you share your items across warehouses or manufacturing facilities, you can access them through a common item master. Configure one or multiple item masters for your enterprise, based your enterprise structure. A single item master is recommended because it provides simpler and more efficient maintenance. However, in rare cases, it may be beneficial to keep multiple item masters. For example, if you acquire another enterprise and need to continue to operate your lines of business separately, maintaining a second item master might be the best decision.\n\nSuppliers Sites\n\nYou can approve particular suppliers to supply specified commodities and authorize your business units to buy from those suppliers when the need arises. For example, you might be a household cleaning products manufacturer and need dyes, plastics, and perfumes to make your products. You purchase from a central supplier 70% of your perfume supplies with an additional supplier, in reserve, from whom you purchase the remaining 30%. At the same time, each of your business units purchases plastics and dyes from the same supplier, but from different local supplier sites to save transportation costs.\n\nTo implement business unit specific supplier sites, Oracle Fusion Procurement supports a method for defining suppliers sites as owned and managed by the business unit responsible for negotiating the supplier terms. Your other business units that have a service provider relationship defined with your procurement business unit, subscribe to the supplier sites using the supplier site assignments feature. In addition, Procurement allows sharing of the following procurement data objects across business units:\n\nSupplier qualification data, such as approved supplier lists\n\nCatalog content, such as agreements, smart forms, public shopping lists, and content zones\n\nProcurement configuration data\n\nFAQs for Define Reference Data Sharing\n\nWhat reference data objects can be shared across business units?\n\nThe following list contains the reference data objects for the Oracle Fusion Applications that can be shared across business units and the method in which the reference data for each is shared.\n\nWhat reference data objects can be shared across asset books?\n\nThe following list contains the reference data objects for Oracle Fusion Assets that can be shared across asset books and the method in which the reference data for each is shared.\n\nWhat reference data objects can be shared across cost organizations?\n\nThe following list contains the reference data objects for Oracle Fusion Cost Management that can be shared across cost organizations and the method in which the reference data for each is shared.\n\nWhat reference data objects can be shared across project units?\n\nThe following list contains the reference data objects for Oracle Fusion Project Foundation that can be shared across project units and the method in which the reference data for each is shared.\n\nApplication Name\n\nReference Data Object\n\nMethod of Sharing\n\nProject Foundation\n\nProject Definition\n\nAssignment to multiple sets, no common values allowed\n\nProject Foundation\n\nProject Transaction Types\n\nAssignment to multiple sets, no common values allowed\n\nDefine Enterprise: Manage Enterprise HCM Information\n\nEnterprise: Explained\n\nAn enterprise consists of legal entities under common control and management.\n\nEnterprise Defined\n\nWhen implementing Oracle Fusion Applications you operate within the context of an enterprise that has already been created in the application for you. This is either a predefined enterprise or an enterprise that has been created in the application by a system administrator.\n\nAn enterprise organization captures the name of the deploying enterprise and the location of the headquarters. There is normally a single enterprise organization in a production environment. Multiple enterprises are defined when the system is used to administer multiple customer companies, for example, multiple tenants, or when a customer chooses to set up additional enterprises for testing or development.\n\nOracle Fusion Applications offers capabilities for multiple tenants to share the same applications instance for some human resources processes. If you offer business process outsourcing services to a set of clients, each of those clients may be represented as an enterprise within an Oracle Fusion Application instance. To support this functionality, system owned reference data such as sequences, sets, and flexfields are also defined within an enterprise.\n\nIn Oracle Fusion Applications, an organization classified as an enterprise is defined before defining any other organizations in the HCM Common Organization Model. All other organizations are defined as belonging to an enterprise.\n\nManaging Enterprise Information for Non-Oracle Fusion HCM Users: Explained\n\nThe Manage Enterprise HCM Information task includes default settings for your enterprise such as the employment model, worker number generation, and so on. If you are not implementing Oracle Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM), then the only action you may need to perform using this task is to change the enterprise name, if necessary. The other settings are HCM-specific and are not relevant outside of Oracle Fusion HCM.\n\nHCM Foundation and Oracle Fusion Workforce Directory Management (WDM): How They Fit in Oracle Fusion\n\nHCM Foundation and Oracle Fusion Workforce Directory Management (WDM) provide access to a restricted set of Oracle Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM) features to customers who do not purchase the full Oracle Fusion HCM license.\n\nHCM Foundation\n\nIf you do not purchase any HCM products and purchase one of the products that has data dependencies on HCM, you get a restricted set of HCM features, including:\n\nUser interfaces that facilitate the setup and maintenance of certain common entities such as persons, organizations, or jobs\n\nServices that enable you to enter and maintain HCM data\n\nA simplified user management functionality that enables you to enter and maintain user accounts\n\nUser Interfaces\n\nThe following table lists the user interfaces you can use to enter and maintain HCM data:\n\nServices\n\nWDM\n\nWDM supports the coexistence scenario where Oracle Fusion HCM products and E-Business Suite or Peoplesoft Enterprise exist together. WDM enables you to use the following Oracle HCM Fusion functionality alongside your existing implementation: Workforce Compensation, Goal Management, Network at Work, Performance Management, Profile Management, and Talent Review. WDM provides the entire HCM Foundation functionality plus access to the following:\n\nHR-to-HR interface, which enables you to upload and replicate your Peoplesoft Enterprise and E-Business Suite data in WDM\n\nGallery portrait, which is a selection of information about a worker or nonworker, including contact information, personal and employment details, account information, experience and qualifications, and compensation details\n\nHR specialist and manager dashboards, which provide HR specialist and line manager users personalized views of information and a starting point for their tasks. HCM coexistence users can access a restricted set of analytics in these dashboards.\n\nAdditional user-interfaces\n\nDashboard Analytics for HCM Coexistence\n\nThe following analytics are available in the HR specialist dashboard:\n\nThe following analytics are available in the manager dashboard:\n\nAdditional User-Interfaces in WDM\n\nDefine Enterprise: Manage Locations\n\nLocations: Explained\n\nA location identifies physical addresses of a workforce structure, such as a department or a job. You can also create locations to enter the addresses of external organizations that you want to maintain, such as employment agencies, tax authorities, and insurance or benefits carriers.\n\nThe locations that you create exist as separate structures that you can use for reporting purposes, and also in rules that determine employee eligibility for various types of compensation and benefits. You enter information about a location only once. Subsequently, when you set up other workforce structures you select the location from a list.\n\nLocation Sets\n\nWhen you create a location, you must associate it with a set. Only those users who have access to the set's business unit can access the location set and other associated workforce structure sets, such as those that contain departments and jobs.\n\nYou can also associate the location to the common set so that users across your enterprise can access the location irrespective of their business unit. When users search for locations, they can see the locations that they have access to along with the locations in the common set.\n\nThe following figure shows how locations sets restrict access to users.\n\nFAQs for Manage Locations\n\nWhy can't I see my location in the search results?\n\nYou can search for approved locations only. Also, if you created a location in Oracle Fusion Trading Community Model, then you can't access that location from Oracle Fusion Global Human Resources. For use in Oracle Fusion HCM, you must recreate the location from the Manage Locations page.\n\nWhat happens if I select a geographic hierarchy node when I'm creating or editing a location?\n\nThe calendar events that were created for the geographical node start to apply for the location and may impact the availability of worker assignments at that location. The geographical hierarchy nodes available for selection on the Locations page display from a predefined geographic hierarchy.\n\nWhat happens if I select an inventory organization when I'm creating or editing a location?\n\nThe location is available for selection in purchase documents of that inventory organization in Oracle Fusion Inventory Management. If you don't select an inventory organization, then the location is available in purchase documents across all inventory organizations.\n\nWhat happens if I inactivate a location?\n\nStarting from the effective date that you entered, you can no longer associate the location with other workforce structures, assignments, or applications. If the location is already in use, it will continue to be available to the components that currently use it.\n\nHow can I associate a location with an inventory organization?\n\nFrom the Manage Locations page in Oracle Fusion Global Human Resources.\n\nTo appear on the Create or Edit Location pages, your inventory organization must be effective on today's date and must exist in the location set that you selected.\n\nDefine Geographies\n\nDefining Address Cleansing: Explained\n\nAddress cleansing provides a way to validate, correct, and standardize addresses that are entered in a user interface. Geography validation only validates the geography attributes of an address, for example, State, City, and Postal codes; address cleansing validates both the geography attributes and the address line attributes.\n\nAddress cleansing can only be used through the Oracle Fusion Trading Community Data Quality product, because the feature is delivered using Data Quality integration. You need to ensure that you have a license for the countries that will use Trading Community Data Quality data cleansing.\n\nYou can specify the real time address cleansing level for each country by choosing either None, meaning that there is no real time address cleansing, or by choosing Optional, meaning that you will have the choice to cleanse addresses. Once you have enabled address cleansing for a country a Verify Address icon appears at address entry points in the application. You can then click the icon to perform address cleansing and receive a corrected, standardized address. If Trading Community Data Quality does not find a matching address the application will alert you.\n\nGeography Structure, Hierarchy, and Validation : How They Fit Together\n\nThere are three components that are dependent on each other when defining a country: geography structure, geography hierarchy, and geography validation. Every country has to have the geography structure defined first before the hierarchy can be defined, and the geography hierarchy has to be defined before the validation can be defined.\n\nGeography Structure\n\nFirstly, you need to create a geography structure for each country to define which geography types are part of the country structure, and how the geography types are hierarchically related within the country structure. For example, you can create geography types called State, City, and Postal Code. Then you can rank the State geography type as the highest level within the country, the City as the second level, and the Postal Code as the lowest level within the country structure. Geography structure can be defined using the Manage Geographies task, or can be imported using tasks in the Define Geographies activity.\n\nGeography Hierarchy\n\nOnce the geography structure is defined, the geographies for each geography type can be added to the hierarchy. For example, below the United States you can create a geography called California using a State geography type.\n\nAs part of managing the geography hierarchy you can view, create, edit, and delete the geographies for each geography type in the country structure. You can also add a primary and alternate name and code for each geography. A geography hierarchy can be created using the Manage Geographies task, or can be imported using tasks in the Define Geographies activity.\n\nGeography Validation\n\nAfter defining the geography hierarchy, you need to specify the geography validations for the country. You can choose which address style formats you would like to use for the country, and for each selected address style format you can map geography types to address attributes. You can also select which geography types should be included in geography or tax validation, and which geography types will display in a list of values during address entry in other user interfaces. The geography validation level for the country, such as error or warning, can also be selected.\n\nGeography Structures: Explained\n\nA geography structure is a hierarchical grouping of geography types for a country. For example, the geography structure for United States is: State, County, City, then Postal Code.\n\nYou can use the geography structure to establish:\n\nHow geographies can be related\n\nThe types of geographies you can define for the country\n\nHow Geographies Can Be Related\n\nYou can determine how a country's geographies are hierarchically related by firstly creating the hierarchy of the geography types in the geography structure. When you define a country's structure the country geography type is implicitly at the top of the geography structure, and the numbering of the subsequent levels start with 1 as the next geography level after country.\n\nYou must add a geography type as a level in the country structure before you can define a geography for that geography type in a country. For example, before defining the state of California, the State geography type must be added to the United States country structure. Only one geography type can be used for each level, you cannot define more than one geography type at the same level.\n\nTo simplify the creation of a country structure you can copy a structure from another country, and then amend the geography type hierarchy for the country.\n\nThe Types of Geographies You Can Define for the Country\n\nThe application provides you with a set of available master reference geography types. If required, you can create a geography type before adding it to the country structure. Each geography type is added below the current lowest level.\n\nYou can delete geography types only if geographies do not exist at that level. If the geography type is not the lowest level in the country structure, then you have to delete that level and all levels below it.\n\nGeography Hierarchy: Explained\n\nGeography hierarchy is a data model that lets you establish conceptual parent-child relationships between geographies. A geography, such as Tokyo or Peru, describes a boundary on the surface of the earth. The application can extrapolate information based on this network of hierarchical geographical relationships.\n\nFor example, in the geography hierarchy the state of California is defined as the parent of San Mateo county, which is the parent of Redwood City, which is the parent of the postal code 94065. If you enter just 94065, the application can determine that the postal code is in California, or that the corresponding city is Redwood City.\n\nThe application leverages geography hierarchy information to facilitate business processes that rely on geography information, for example, tax calculation, order sourcing rules, sales territory definition. The geography hierarchy information is centrally located in the Trading Community Model and shared among other application offerings.\n\nThe top level of the geography hierarchy is Country, so the hierarchy essentially contains countries and their child geographies. Other aspects of the geography hierarchy include:\n\nGeography\n\nGeography type\n\nGeography usage\n\nMaster reference geography hierarchy\n\nUser defined zones\n\nGeography\n\nA geography is a boundary such as a country, state, province or city. It is a physical space with boundaries that is a defined instance of a geography type. For example, San Jose is a geography of the City geography type.\n\nGeography Type\n\nGeography types are a divisional grouping of geographies, which can be either geopolitical (for example, City, Province, and District) or user defined (for example, Continent, Country Regions, Tax Regions).\n\nGeography Usage\n\nGeography usage indicates how a geography type or geography is used in the application. A master reference geography always has the usage of Master Reference. User defined zones can have the usages of Tax, Shipping, or Territory, based on what is relevant for their purpose.\n\nMaster Reference Geography Hierarchy\n\nThe geography hierarchy data is considered to be the single source of truth for geographies. It is all the data, including geography types and geographies, that you define and maintain in the Trading Community Model tables.\n\nThe geography usage for the entire hierarchy is the master reference, and defined geography types and geographies are considered as master reference geography types and geographies. For example, Country is a universally recognized geography type, and United States is considered a master geography.\n\nUser Defined Zones\n\nUser defined zones are a collection of geographical data, created from master reference data for a specific purpose. For example, territory zones are collections of master reference geographies ordered in a hierarchy. Tax and shipping zones are collections of master reference geographies without a hierarchical grouping.\n\nGeography Validation: Explained\n\nGeography validation determines the geography mapping and validation for a country's address styles, as well as the overall geography validation control for a country.\n\nThe No Styles Format address style format is the default address style format for a country. By defining the mapping and validation for this format you will ensure that validations can be performed for any address in the country. After the No Styles Format is defined you can set up additional mapping for specific address styles.\n\nFor each address style format, you can define the following:\n\nMap to attribute\n\nEnable list of values\n\nTax validation\n\nGeography validation\n\nGeography validation control\n\nMap to Attribute\n\nFor every address style format, you can map each geography type to an address attribute. For example, you can map the State geography type to the State address attribute for the United States, or map the State geography type to the County address attribute for the United Kingdom. The geography types that appear are based on how the country structure is defined. The list of address attributes that appear are based on address formats delivered with the application, or your customer defined address formats.\n\nEnable List of Values\n\nOnce a geography type is mapped to an attribute, then you can specify whether the geography type will appear in a list of values during address entry in user interfaces. It is very important to review carefully if you want to enable a list of values. You should only enable a list of values if you have sufficient geography data imported or created for that geography. Once you have enabled a list of values for an address attribute, you can only select the geography data available for the geography type. This means that if a specific geography value is not available in the geography hierarchy, you cannot create an address with a different geography value.\n\nTax Validation\n\nYou can also specify whether a geography type will be included in tax validation. For example, for the United States North America address style format you specify that County, State, and City are used for tax validation. This will mean that when a transaction involves an address with the North America address style, the address must have the correct county, state, and city combination based on the geography hierarchy data, to be considered valid for tax calculation.\n\nGeography Validation\n\nYou can specify whether a geography type will be included in geography validation. This will mean that, for example, when the user enters a United States address using the North America address style format, the address must have the correct country, state, and postal code combination based on geography hierarchy data to be considered geographically valid.\n\nIf an address element is mapped to a geography type, but not selected for geography validation usage, then suggested values can be provided for that address element during address entry, but that element is not validated.\n\nGeography Validation Control\n\nYou can select the geography validation level for a country. Validation will check if the entered address maps to the geography hierarchy data available for the country, and the geography validation control determines whether you can save an address that did not pass validation during address entry. For example, if the validation level is Warning, then an address can still be saved if the values do not match the geography hierarchy data.\n\nThese are the geography validation levels you can choose:\n\nError - only completely valid addresses can be saved, with all mandatory address elements entered.\n\nNo Validation - all addresses can be saved including incomplete and invalid addresses.\n\nWarning - invalid addresses are saved after warning users.\n\nRegardless of the result of validation, the validation process will try to map any address at"
