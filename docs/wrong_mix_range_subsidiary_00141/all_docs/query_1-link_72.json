And despite a downturn in enterprise IT investment during the period, Oracle continued to deliver innovation and results. The era has been marked with major technical breakthroughs for Oracle—some, the result of millions of dollars and years of research and development—that would set the company’s future course. Oracle Real Application Clusters, Oracle E-Business Suite, Oracle Grid Computing, support for enterprise Linux, and Oracle Fusion all fuel a commitment to innovation and leadership that has defined Oracle for 30 years.Prepared by Roula Abou Samra\n\n2.
