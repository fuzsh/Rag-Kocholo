        "text": "Chapter 1: BREATH\n\n“Are you excited for our family reunion?” my dad had asked. Excited? How could I be excited? Mom left when I was three and I haven’t seen her since. Family reunion, more like no mom reunion.\n\nWith all these thoughts going through my head, I could barely take the one breath I desperately needed. The one breath that could have given me security about this family that I hadn’t seen in years. The last family reunion that we had was when I was three. To get you more caught up, I am now seventeen. That means I haven’t seen them in fourteen years. All except for my dad, at least. I wasn’t ready for this. I was scared of meeting my family again. The only thing I could do right now was go to sleep.\n\nRING, RING, RING! Yawwnnn. The bright sun shone on my face like a warm tornado. I breathed in and then out. Finally a breath of relief. I did it again and I felt calmer. More relaxed.\n\nWhen my eyes slowly opened, I could see my aesthetic, blue room. I could see blue clouds above my bed, all my blue stuffed animals, my blue blanket, and my blue open doors with light shining in from the deck. I could also see my dad hovering over me and my blue blanket with his scary statue-like glare and body position. Although, I knew he wasn’t mad. He had that same facial expression since Mom left. It was almost like a curse.\n\nChapter 2: CURSE\n\nOops. Did I say it? The C-word. Yep, that’s right. My family is cursed. Ever since my mom left, our family has been cursed. My dad has the curse of that glare, but I got the worst curse. I can’t talk. Not a single word. Sure, I’m smart, kind, and strong. Those were my blessings when I was born. My family used to be the blessing kind of family. We all had our own blessings, and those blessings made us special in our own kind of way. Except for my mom.\n\nWell, now we’re talking about my mom. She was the curse to our family. She was the one who was cursed by an evil witch who took away her blessings and claimed them for herself. Now she is a wreck living somewhere unknown. Although I know, deep down inside, she is still the kind woman she used to be. When I close my eyes, I imagine her loving heart still inside my mind.\n\nChapter 3: BACK TO MY DAD\n\nLike I said, my dad was standing over me in his statue-like position.\n\n“Get dressed,” he said, “I’m going to take you for breakfast.” So I got up, went to my closet, and took out a pair of denim shorts and a peach crop top. I went over to my dad, and we started walking in the direction of Jouns, a sweet, little cafe. It sucked that I couldn’t say anything to my dad. I couldn’t even tell him that I loved him. All I could do was nod my head.\n\nWhen we got to Jouns, I pointed at a seat that I wanted to sit at, but he didn’t see my finger, and he took me to eat inside. I hated sitting inside. The loud noises haunted my ears. But what could I do? I couldn’t talk and I only knew the slightest bit of sign language. I couldn’t even tell my dad that I wanted to learn sign language.\n\nWe took a seat at a small table with two, little, white chairs. A nice waiter greeted us.\n\n“Should we start with some drinks?” she asked.\n\n“That shall be lovely,” my Dad said. “What will you be wanting today?” the waiter asked.\n\n“One small latte and one large orange juice,” my dad told the waitress. Orange juice was my least favorite juice, and now I had to drink a large. But how was I supposed to tell my dad that? I needed to go somewhere alone. And I didn’t just mean outside. I wanted to go on a trip. Not to Hawaii or California. I wanted to find my mom.\n\nChapter 4: STORY\n\nI was in my blue bed with my donut pajamas and my dad beside me. I know, I know. I’m seventeen, and my dad shouldn’t be tucking me in, but it felt good. I had no one else to love. No friends, no brother, no sister, no mom. Who else was I supposed to trust?\n\nI blinked really hard at my dad. This was my way of telling him I wanted to hear a story.\n\n“Okay, okay,” my dad started, “I think you’re old enough to know this. Remember how the evil witch crashed our family reunion when you were three and took away your mom and her blessings? You know how the witch was unknown? Well, the witch is not unknown. She is your mom’s evil sister. She was jealous of your mom, so she cursed her and the rest of her family. Not just you and me. Pops is blind. Gram Gram is always grumpy. Grandma and Grandpa are poor and homeless. Julie can’t fall asleep, and Aunt Harmonica is so unsmart. Uncle Jerry has it the worst, though. He is so greedy and always wants more.”\n\n“Anything more?” I say in sign language.\n\n“Well, there is one more thing. It is the mother’s daughter’s job to travel to all of the three worlds in which your mom could have been banished, find her, and heal her of her curse. When you do, our family will be the blessing kind of family once again. You will take this bag. In this bag is the cure to give your mom and a tool for each world you go to. You will leave first thing in the morning. Don’t come to me to say goodbye, just knock on your closet door three times.” He kissed me on my forehead and then left. I guess you could say I was happy. I got to make my decisions. I hadn’t done that in fourteen years.\n\nChapter 5 – April 24, 1976: THE JOURNEY HAS BEGUN\n\nRING, RING, RING! sounded my alarm clock. I had set it to 5:00. I got in my closet and changed into blue-ribbed leggings and a pink crop top. I tied a sweater around my waist.\n\nBefore knocking on my closet, I grabbed the bag my dad had said to take and, at the last second, I grabbed a fresh journal from my shelf and shoved it in the bag along with a pen. I went into my closet and closed the door. I knocked once, twice, three times.\n\nChapter 6: TIME\n\nIt didn’t happen suddenly. It took time. Maybe five or ten minutes. I took that time to write.\n\nDear Diary,\n\nFinally, I get to defend myself in the world. I guess I’m happy. Finally, no Dad ordering me a large orange juice at a restaurant. I can order a large apple juice! Not that there will be juice or restaurants in the three worlds. No one to tell me, “Time for bed, Pearl,” or “You love orange juice, don’t you, Pearl?” I’m free for the first time in fourteen years. But part of me worries. What if I can’t help our cursed family before the reunion? Or what if I can’t help my family at all? Will I die? Will my family die? Will my mom die? Will my family stay the same? Will my mom stay the same? Thanks for understanding, Diary. Just arrived. Talk to you later.\n\nChapter 7: JOY\n\nI stepped out of my closet and onto a rainbow floor. I saw a girl with her head in her hands, crying. I went over to her. I couldn’t even ask her what was wrong. Maybe she knew sign language.\n\n“What’s wrong?” I said in sign language.\n\n“This is the planet of joy,” she said. I let her continue. “You’re supposed to be joyful! But what if I’m not?” A shiver I had never seen before ran through her body. I laid my head on hers. I couldn’t even ask her what was wrong. I couldn’t even tell her about my life to make her feel better. But what if I could?\n\nI put out a finger to represent one second and I went into my closet to grab the bag my dad had given me. Inside was a speaker. Not like a microphone, but a fancy speaker. This fancy speaker’s magnifier was not supposed to be around in 1976. I felt like I was in the future. This wasn’t a regular speaker. I could talk with this speaker! I put this fancy speaker on and I tried to mouth the word “Test.” I could hear my voice going through my body. I was speaking for the first time in fourteen years. A note on the microphone said you have ten sentences. This meant that I had used one and had nine left.\n\nI went over to the girl a second time. Her makeup was messed up, and her tears were now dried up. “I have nine sentences on this speaker,” I told the girl. “What’s wrong?”\n\n“My mom wants me to marry this man,” she said, “He will make me happy and joyful. But he doesn’t make me happy. He makes me upset. He swears and gets mad at me for the tiniest things. For heaven’s sake, this is the planet of joy!”\n\nNow I knew, this was the planet of joy. I had eight sentences left. “Why can’t you tell your parents that you don’t want to marry him?”\n\n“They will be disappointed in me. They just want to make me happy. Besides, who else will I marry? Do I even have to marry if I don’t want to?” I shook my head, meaning no.\n\n“Take me to your parents,” I said.\n\n“Okay,” she responded. I followed her through rainbow trees, crowds of joyful people with bright clothes, and finally a rainbow cobblestone step leading to a bright, orange, two-story house with a nice, red deck. I thought about ringing the doorbell, but then the girl stepped right through. Inside, I could see a rainbow couch, a bright blue TV blaring many colors, and two moms watching the TV in matching, green dresses. They weren’t staring at the TV, though. They were staring at each other. Here it comes, I thought. I was right. Smooch smooch smooch. I hadn’t seen that in fourteen years.\n\n“Mom, moma! I told you not to do that infront of me.” One mom blushed.\n\n“Sorry hon, didn’t know you were there.”\n\n“Today’s their honeymoon,” the girl explained.\n\n“Your daughter has something to tell you.” I got right to the point. I had five sentences left. I gestured towards the girl.\n\nShe took a deep breath and then blurted it all out. “I don’t want to marry Tom! He swears and gets mad at me!” She turns her voice into a whisper. “He-he doesn’t make me joyful.”\n\n“Oh honey,” The other mom said, “Marry who you want.”\n\n“Really?” said the girl.\n\n“Of course,” both of the moms said. They go over to hug the girl. As soon as that happened, my speaker dropped to the floor, I went right back to my closet, and it took off.\n\nChapter 8: DEAR DIARY ENTRY #2\n\nDear Diary,\n\nI just helped a girl (I don’t know her name) be joyful. I talked for the first time in fourteen years and I saw true love for the first time in what seems like forever. Longer than fourteen years, I’m sure, because my parents didn’t kiss or even show they loved each other during or even before the reunion. I do know one thing, though. I have to save my mom before the family reunion. I have to make sure my parents fall in love once again. Or, I don’t know what will happen. Probably something unknown and so very frightful. I wonder if the witch is still alive? If she is, will I have to face her? If I do, will I win? I am starting to doubt myself. Thanks for listening, Diary. I have just landed and have to go, bye.\n\nI know what you’re thinking. You treat your diary like a friend! You make the D in “diary” uppercase! Remember, I don’t have any friends. Besides my dad, I can only talk to this Diary.\n\nChapter 9: THE PLANET OF LOVE\n\nI stepped out of my closet. I saw a pink heart. No, but seriously big. It covered a whole room. And yes, I had landed inside, inside a small room. I knew that because I saw a wall about ten feet away from the ground. I heard a conversation coming from another room only a few feet away from where I was standing. I walked closer and peeked my head through the door. I could see a boy trying to kiss a girl, but the girl refused.\n\n“Get away from me Jeff!” the girl said. Then she spotted me. I tried to quickly but quietly move away and act like I was never there, but she beat me to it. “Who are you?” she said in a snobby voice.\n\nNo turning back now. I stepped in a little bit and said in sign language, “I can’t talk.” She didn’t understand. I could also see that Jeff was confused as well. He was staring at the woman (maybe twenty-five or thirty) with loving eyes. I was going to have to do this the hard way. I pointed at myself. I pointed at my mouth. Then I made an X with my fingers. The woman finally understood.\n\n“You can’t talk,” the girl said in a surprised voice, “My name is Hannah. This is Jeff,” she said in an exasperated voice. Well, the Jeff part.\n\nI once again put a finger out to represent one second and ran to my closet. Inside the closet was my bag. Inside my bag was a note. This is what it said:\n\nDear my dear Pearl,\n\nThis couple is like a broken heart. You need to help this couple get back together before the sun sets on this day. Your estimated time is seven hours. If you do not help this couple in time, the world of love will turn to darkness, and you will get sent back home without saving your mom and your family.\n\n– Good luck, DAD\n\nIf I didn’t help this poor couple, I would be dead. Dead meat. I couldn’t go home without saving my mom. What would my dad think of me? What would my family think of me? I couldn’t do this. I went to a dark corner in the room, rolled up into a ball, and started to cry. Tears ran down my face like big puddles.\n\nAfter a few minutes of sulking, I could hear something. Something in my head. It was saying: “We’ll always love you. No matter what. Amen.” I could remember this place. It was the day of the reunion. My family all next to me, smiling. In my little high chair I felt so proud. Next I saw pictures flying in my head. I could see the witch’s wart. Big, on the side of her nose, liquid oozing out of it. The green was a pop of color compared to her plain, peachy-white skin. Next, I saw her wand zapping and making a big firework-like show that caused a boom and made a hole in our wall that my dad had to fix later. Then I saw me and I heard the last word I ever said which was AHHH! I saw my mom get picked up by the evil witch’s wand and leave with the evil witch.\n\nI woke up in the same darkened corner of the room. My eyes darted around. I could see the shape of the heart, the door leading to the next room, my closet, and my pile of tears around me. I felt sweat, warm and sticky all over my body. I saw Hannah standing above me, Jeff beside her. I handed Hannah the note.\n\n“This note was probably not made by your dad. First of all, Jeff and I were just in a fight, but we’re still together. She went over and kissed Jeff on the lips. I sighed a sigh of relief. “Second of all, this looks a lot like the evil witch’s handwriting. Every planet knows the evil witch. She’s infamous everywhere.” I gulped. “She lives on the planet of dismay along with a mom she kidnapped. I can take you there, but it’s a pretty long journey.”\n\nI stopped her. I pointed at myself. Then in the air I spelled out: M-O-M. Before she could be surprised, I took her hand and pulled her into my closet. I knocked three times on the door.\n\nChapter 10: DEAR DIARY ENTRY #3\n\nDear Diary,\n\nI met this woman named Hannah. She looks around twenty or thirty, and she told me the most surprising fact. Guess what! My Dad didn’t send me that note, the evil witch did. I don’t understand. He said he sent me something for each world. But he didn’t. Do you know what could have happened? The other thing is, I should have known my mom is in the world of dismay. Why would the evil witch send her to a world of joy or a world of love? Well, I guess I can’t continue unless I solve the problem that’s going on in the planet. But on the love planet Hannah and Jeff solved the problem. I guess I was my problem for that world. Maybe the planet of Love and the planet of Joy were obstacles to get to the planet of Dismay? We’ve just landed. Have to go, Bye Diary!\n\nChapter 11: THE PLANET OF DISMAY\n\nI stepped out of my closet and I got goosebumps from a cold rush of wind. I took my sweater and put it on. Hannah put on a sweater as well. I grabbed my bag and put it on like it’s a purse. When I was done with all of this, I took a moment to look at my surroundings. First thing I saw was that Hannah was in shock, her mouth was wide open and she couldn’t even mumble out one word. Welcome to the club. I saw Darkness, lots of black and no happiness, and big black pieces of dust. I saw huge pictures of the witch and flashbacks from the reunion building of huge monsters towering over me.\n\nBut in the middle of it all, I saw my mom. She looked older. Brown curly hair like mine and brownish-tan skin like mine. But her face was more wrinkled. Not too wrinkled but the slightest bit wrinkled. I did some quick math and realized she was in her late fifties.\n\nI slowly walked over to her, and Hannah did too, trailing behind me. I walked over to my mom and laid my head on her shoulder, and she laid her head on my head and started sulking. Hannah sat beside me feeling sorry for me in the best possible way. I took out a bottle, and gave it to my Mom. I imitated drinking something, and Mom knew what to do. When she drank the bottle, her tears ran dry and the dust went away and turned into a beautiful sun. Then I saw the Witch cackling.\n\n“Think you can get away!” The witch said, her wart still looking the same. I grabbed my mom’s hand and we ran. We ran past the evaporating dust, and the big rocks, and the long, tall grass. We ran even though the witch was above us, cackling like she was mad. We ran fast, until we realized that Hannah was gone. We turned back through the long grass and the big rocks, and the evaporating dust. We saw Hannah had tripped over a rock, and blood was all around her neck. We have to think fast, but I couldn’t stand looking at blood, and the witch was an inch away from us! With no hesitation, my mom grabbed Hannah and held her above her head like a fireman saving someone from a fire. Next, we ran past the evaporating dust, the big rocks and the tall grass. We quickly ran to the closet with the witch behind us, her cackling loud and clear. My mom didn’t hesitate and she ran fast, even though Hannah was on her back and there was a witch behind her. The witch got close, too close, and I could feel her breath. It smelled like human flesh. She reached out her wand, but just in time I slammed the closet door and knocked on it three times.\n\nChapter 12: DEAR DIARY, LAST ENTRY\n\nDear Diary,\n\nI finally found Mom. She is now forgetful of what just happened and is asleep. She won’t wake up until we get home. She won’t have a single memory of this whole adventure. I found that note in my bag. Another thing is that we dropped Hannah off at the world of love. I wanted to stay and make sure she was ok. I wasn’t able to say goodbye and I feel bad. When I had to leave Hannah I cried up some tears. But at least we left her in the right hands. This is my last diary entry of this journey, so goodbye forever dear Diary. Just landed.\n\nChapter 13: APRIL 27, 1976 – THE JOURNEY HAS ENDED\n\nI stepped out of my closet into my aesthetic, blue room. Mom acted like this was a normal day and nothing happened. “Change out of that outfit, Pearl honey. It’s filled with dust.” I smirked.\n\n“Wonder where that dust came from,” I said. Huh, I said. I said!\n\n“Me too,” said Mom.\n\nI changed into a plain white shirt and skinny jeans with 3 buttons on the top. I walked downstairs and over to my dad. “Why didn’t you send me any material for the world of love?” I asked.\n\n“I didn’t send anything for any world. You knew what you needed, you thought about it, and you got what you wanted. As for the world of love, well, you were your obstacle. If you didn’t break down, you would’ve gotten past that world in a matter of seconds.”\n\n“You were watchin-” I started.\n\n“No more talk about this nonsense dream you had,” he said and winked at me. I smiled.\n\nThe End\n\nI was lost. I mean, you can’t blame me. The streets of D.C. are more like a maze than a couple of roads. If you hadn’t guessed, I’m an alley cat. I don’t have a name, but I’ve been called a scoundrel and the like. I have no idea why. I wouldn’t be upset if a needy kitten was digging through my garbage! Ok, are you creeped out yet? No? I thought you would have realized it by now, but I guess I have to spell it out for you: CATS DON’T WRITE JOURNALS! Yeah, you really should have at least put some thought to that fact. Well, the truth is, this story is being written down after the story you are about to read has happened. Also, I’m not the one writing this. I’m just telling my friend Olivia what to put in here. Surprised? No? Maybe, just in case, I should spell it out again: CATS DON’T TALK! You know what? Maybe it would be easier if I just told the story.\n\nOk, back to the beginning: I was lost. Suddenly, I remembered where I was. Or at least, where I should be. Wendy’s is near here! I thought. I tumbled over to where I knew some half-eaten, half-rotten cheeseburgers would await me: the Wendy’s trash cans, any alley cat’s dream! There were four trash cans out there, and three smelled like fast food. The other one, though… I couldn’t put a finger on it! Or a paw, for that matter. It didn’t smell like magically good food, it smelled like actual, pure magic! I jumped inside to find out if there was anything to eat. There wasn’t, but I felt weird all of a sudden. I saw sparkles, and spun around and around. Maybe the trash can was empty, and I had hurt my head on the metal bottom. Then, the whirling stopped. I still saw sparkles, though. And pink trees. And flying cows. I had a feeling that I was not in D.C. anymore.\n\nI didn’t know it yet, but I had fallen through a portal in the bottom of the trash can into a town called Misty Hill. It was set apart from the outside world, and for good reason: the people of Misty Hill knew magic, and used it on a daily basis! However, they needed some way to get to the “normals”, so they put up a portal. It was a bit unfortunate that they put it on the bottom of a trash can, since those half-eaten, half-rotten cheeseburgers I was drooling about earlier kept falling through, but even their wisest elders couldn’t figure out the principles of closing a portal.\n\nAnyways, the cheeseburgers turned out to be a good thing because they cushioned the fall. At the time, the townspeople were inside. Except for one little girl jumping rope, that is. She was also eating a cookie, which sounds unsafe while turning a jump rope, but the rope was turning on its own! I walked up to her, and rubbed against her legs. My golden fur gleamed in the sun, and I made my big eyes even bigger.\n\n“Meeeeooooow.”\n\n“Hi little kitty! Like my trick?” She asked. I thought, yes! As hard as I could. I guess it worked because she said, “It’s only practice. My parents are teaching me how to do magic! It really helps when I’m hungry, as you can see!” Then she looked at me. “My parents are teaching me all about magic gems. My favorite is opal. It’s soooooo pretty! I have an idea…” She went inside a house, and stayed in there for a bit. Then, she came out holding something. I couldn’t tell what it was, just that it was glowing. It was also covered in bright, shiny, multicolored stones. She skipped up to me. “An opal collar,” she said. “For you! It has so many magical properties! It could make you able to fly, immortal, or even…” She paused for dramatic effect. “IT COULD MAKE YOU ABLE TO TALK!” she blurted out. My tiny jaw dropped. Put it on, put it on, PUT IT ON! I thought. “Here, let me get it on you,” she said. I resisted from scratching her. Suddenly, I felt like the shine from the opal was inside of me!\n\n“Thanks! It’s pretty!” I said. Wait a moment… I SAID STUFF?! I guess the collar worked. Hmm… it was supposed to have other powers… maybe I could fly, too! I focused on being light, and floating on a cloud. Suddenly, everything around me started to shrink. Wait, no… I was just going higher and higher! I tried to go left — success! To go right — nailed it! To go down — I was home again! I didn’t want to try out immortality, though, because if I wasn’t immortal, I would die! Besides, I think immortality is one of those things you just have to depend on.\n\n“I don’t have a name, because I was an alley cat before I came, but I want to know yours,” I said.\n\n“Oh! Sorry, I still haven’t gotten used to, well, a talking cat. My name is Olivia. And do you know what? I’d like you to be my pet! Hmm… I think I’ll call you Pixie!” She said. I was overjoyed! Suddenly, a storm cloud appeared. It settled down on the hill that gave the town its name. Then, it turned into a person! A witch, in fact. She wore all black, and looked… well, evil!\n\n“Who is she?” I whispered to Olivia, terrified.\n\n“She calls herself the Shadow Witch. She thinks she rules the town, and I guess she kinda does, with all her evil magic.”\n\n“Greetings, lowly peasants! I would just like to inform you that anyone who disobeys the following rules will be personally punished by yours truly:\n\nDo not attempt to stop my reign.\n\nDo not assist those who I hold captive.\n\nReport anybody who disobeys the first two rules directly to me.\n\nRemember, I am your ruler forever, and I CAN FIND YOU!” The shadow witch glared at the town one last time, then turned back into the black cloud and floated away.\n\n“She was scary! But what did she mean by ‘I am your ruler forever’?” I asked Olivia.\n\n“She’s immortal. That’s why nobody dares challenge her. She’s impossible to defeat! But you know what? I bet we could do it! We could save Misty Hill!” she replied. It was a good idea, but there was one flaw.\n\n“If we manage to kill her, which is already a huge difficulty, how would that make us any less evil than her?” I said with a worried look on my face. Then, it hit me.\n\n“I have an idea! What if we just try to turn her good? Also, um, do you know the particularly handsome black cat that was next to her?”\n\n“Some kitty has a cruuuuuuuuush!” Olivia teased. “But good plan!” She quickly added. I blushed, if cats can blush.\n\n“I do not have a crush! Anyway, what’s his name?” I asked.\n\n“His name is Vampire. And I’m sure you do like him on some level. Maybe if the Shadow Witch turns good, he will too. Anyway, we really should start our quest. But, before we go, I need to tell you something. You are a helpless little kitten without that collar, okay? You need to keep it safe in order to keep yourself safe.”\n\n“I am not helpless without it! I can do all the stuff cats can usually do!” I retorted.\n\n“Listen, I really don’t want to start an argument with you. Just keep the collar safe, ok?”\n\n“Ok,” I agreed. I’ll prove you wrong. You’ll see, I thought. Then, I realized there was something very important we needed to know.\n\n“Where does the Shadow Witch live?” I asked.\n\n“I have no idea, actually. You know what, though? My parents will!” she exclaimed. So, we set off to her house.\n\nTwo minutes later, we arrived at the house she had gone into to make my collar. Thinking about that made me think about our argument. I felt bad for disagreeing with her. After all, she was my only friend, even if she was wrong about me. I remembered a phrase I had heard long ago that seemed quite literal now. Don’t bite the hand that feeds you, I thought to myself. We walked inside, only to have a terrible smell blasted into our nostrils.\n\n“Ugh! Is mom trying her hand at cooking again? Daddy, I thought you promised not to let her do that anymore!” Olivia said. Her voice sounded funny, probably because she was pinching her nose.\n\n“I’m truly sorry, honey. She read about a recipe that she thought would be simple, and I couldn’t stop her!” her dad replied.\n\n“By the way, do you by any chance know where the Shadow Witch lives? Pixie and I want to make her good!” Olivia said casually.\n\n“Well, um, are you sure you want to face her? I mean, I know you’re a brave girl, and your cat has that magic collar,” her father replied, flabbergasted. There it was again! Did underestimating me without my collar run in their family? I decided not to mention it. Don’t bite the hand that feeds you, dumdum! I reminded myself over and over again.\n\n“Daddy, I’m serious. Pixie and I really want to do this! It could save us all!” Olivia whined.\n\n“Um, if it’s any help, I also really want to do this. She’s telling the truth!” I mumbled.\n\n“Alright then, girls, she lives on Craggy Cliff,” her dad told us. Olivia’s eyes widened with recognition.\n\n“You mean the Craggy Cliff, the main eyesore of Misty Hill? No way! Nobody could live there and not be evil!”\n\n“True,” her dad said.\n\n“I think you girls should go ahead. Be careful, though. Ok?” her dad said.\n\n“Promise, Daddy.” With that, we started concocting a genius plan.\n\nWe agreed that first, I would fly out there to see if she was home. Craggy Cliff was at the edge of the town, but thankfully, the town was not very large, so the edge of it was only a ten minute flight. If the Shadow Witch was home, I would carry Olivia back to the lair with me. Then, we would talk to her (I would actually be talking more to Vampire, because he doesn’t speak human but I do speak cat, also because he is gorgeous). After the Shadow Witch turned good, we would become a foursome, working together to keep Misty Hill safe. Now, we just had to hope that everything would go according to plan.\n\nLike we had agreed, I flew across the town to Craggy Cliff, where I saw a pitch-black castle shrouded in fog. I went over to one of the windows, and peered in, hoping I would not get caught. The Shadow Witch was even scarier up close. Not wanting to spend any more time on that horrible cliff, I flew back to where Olivia was waiting.\n\n“She’s home, and she’s terrifying!” I whimpered to Olivia. Now, it was time for step two: I would fly back to the castle carrying Olivia. That seemed risky, seeing as she was a lot bigger than I was, but we tried anyway. We never got off the ground.\n\n“It’s hopeless! We’ll never be able to save anyone!” Olivia wailed. Then, I had an idea.\n\n“Olivia! I can’t carry you, but you can carry me!”\n\n“Yeah, but I don’t see how that would help. You’re the one who can fly,” she said sadly.\n\n“I can only fly because of the collar! But if you let me take it off, just this once, then you could wear it as a bracelet! And if you did that, then you could fly there carrying me, instead of the other way around!” I said excitedly.\n\n“Pixie, you’re a genius! Just promise me that you’ll put it back on once we get there.”\n\n“I promise! Come on, let’s try it!” I exclaimed. She took off my collar. Without it, I felt like I was an alley cat again. She slipped it onto her wrist. It fit her perfectly! She scooped me up under her arm, and flew away. She was unsteady at first, but then she got the hang of it. In what felt like the blink of an eye, we were there! As bravely as we could muster, we walked up to the front door… and knocked.\n\nThe door opened. The Shadow Witch stood in front of us, and I could practically see the evil oozing out from her ears. She shooed us inside, and gestured for us to sit on rickety stools. Then, she spoke.\n\n“I have a feeling you aren’t here to help me. However, if you are, I will accept the gift that you should have brought. Oooooooooh, is this it?” She was looking at my MY OPAL COLLAR!\n\n“Opal always was a favorite of mine. Thank you!” Just like that, the plan was shattered. She had taken away my opal collar, and with it, my ability to talk. I had expected that, though, so I had another plan. One that, along with saving Misty Hill, would also make people stop underestimating me. I walked up to the Shadow Witch and rubbed against her legs, just like I had this morning with Olivia. Now, that was a distant memory. I don’t mean in the ‘it feels like so much time has passed’ way, just that I have a bad memory and, as you are noticing right now, a very short attention span. Anyway, back to the story.\n\nI rubbed against the Shadow Witch’s legs and purred like a motorboat.\n\n“Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.” I made my eyes extra large, especially for her.\n\n“Meeeooooooooooow!” I could pinpoint the moment that her hard heart melted, and the moment Olivia realized she had misjudged me. My collar was not who I was. I was who I was. And I was adorable.\n\n“Oh, I’ve been so mean to the people of Misty Hill! I wanted respect, but I got it the wrong way. I owe everyone a huge apology!” the Shadow Witch confessed.\n\n“Yeah, ya really do. But don’t worry, it’ll be ok. Pixie, I owe you an apology. I underestimated you and overestimated your collar. Friends, everyone?” Olivia asked.\n\n“FRIENDS!” everyone shouted together. Except for Vampire. He meowed.\n\nThe next day, the Shadow Witch came once again to Misty Hill. she declared peace, and apologized, as promised.\n\n“I know that I did a terrible thing, forcing you to do as I said through dark magic. I apologize for that, and hope that you can find it in your hearts to forgive me. Also, I have appointed a new ruler, since I was so bad at it. Everyone, please give a round of applause for the Sunshine Witch and her cat, Pixie!”\n\nOlivia and I stood up from our picnic blanket in the audience, and got up onto the stage. She was smiling from ear to ear, and so was I. Then, she spoke.\n\n“Hi everyone. Um, my name is Olivia, but you can call me the Sunshine Witch. I am happy to stand in front of you today, and start to spread joy around Misty Hill. However, I couldn’t have done it without my cat, Pixie. Pixie, would you like to say a few words?”\n\n“Hi. I am also happy that Olivia is your new leader. She is a great leader, if a bit stubborn. So, yeah. That’s all.” Everyone applauded. I walked over to Vampire.\n\n“Hi! You were great up there,” he said. Oh, yeah, I almost forgot: he has an opal collar now! Olivia made a matching one for him!\n\n“Thanks,” I said, blushing. Olivia walked over to us.\n\n“Pixie, come with me. I have to take you somewhere!” I followed her to the portal.\n\n“Do I have to go back to the outside world? Is this goodbye?” I said, a bit overdramatically.\n\n“No! I would never part with you! You’re my pet, remember? Just jump in! Trust me!” I jumped through the portal.\n\nI tumbled out inside a Wendy’s trash can. I hopped out so that Olivia wouldn’t fall on top of me. A few seconds later, I heard a clunk, and Olivia clambered out of the trash can. We walked up to the front of the Wendy’s.\n\n“Wait here,” Olivia said. I sat down next to the door, and Olivia went inside. She came out with a bag. It smelled like Wendy’s, but not rotten!\n\n“I thought you deserved to try some Wendy’s that wasn’t from a trash can,” she said. She reached into the bag and produced a cheeseburger.\n\n“Is it all for me?” I asked, mouth watering.\n\n“Yup!” was Olivia’s excited reply. I stuck my nose into the soft bun. It smelled like butter. I savored the smell until I couldn’t wait any longer, then bit in. it was the best thing I had ever tasted! In about a millisecond, I had sucked down the whole thing. When Olivia had finished hers, we went back through the portal. The Shadow Witch and Vampire were waiting for us. It was good to be home.\n\nAs predicted by yours truly, Olivia was a great ruler. The Shadow Witch, Vampire, Olivia, and I became a foursome. We practiced magic, had sleepovers, and did karaoke. The opal collars also made it so that Vampire and I didn’t grow up, and stayed cute little kittens forever. The Shadow Witch enchanted Olivia with the same spell that made her immortal, so we literally had forever to keep being awesome. So, yeah. We went all over Misty Hill, solving problems and making people happy. (With, of course, very frequent trips through the portal to get Wendy’s!)\n\nSo, basically, that’s my life story. Except, y’know, it doesn’t end there. It keeps going, because I am still alive! I will be forever! Olivia went home for the day. Her fingers got tired, so she taught me how to type. So, yes, you now have a talking, flying, immortal, and typing cat. I think next, I might learn how to jump rope or play hopscotch, so that I can play more with Olivia. The Shadow Witch and Vampire are out getting me some cheeseburgers. Wait! Did I just hear my magic kitty-phone ring? I did! It’s Vampire… oh no! Maybe the cheeseburgers sold out! No, not that. Vampire says – he says the Shadow Witch sensed dark magic! She said it wasn’t coming from Misty Hill, though! She said… the dark magic is coming from the outside world!\n\nChapter I – The Isolation Experiment\n\nThe Isolation Experiment was a famous scientific test in which 5 humans were placed in large, white boxes with a chair, a bed, and a slot in which they would receive food. The goal was to test what happened if a person didn’t see anyone or anything but the room they were in for a month. To make sure that the subjects could stay active(ish), they would get to walk down the hall and back again.\n\nOut of coincidence, or so they thought, they all met in the same place, at the same time.\n\nEliza and Maxwell were a mere wall away, yet never saw each other. Both began to lose their minds after a week (“People need people,” Eliza would mutter constantly).\n\nAlly was in the next room from Maxwell, who took an approach to imagine that there were people in the room with her. She would have conversations with air that she was imagining was a person that she created. It was found that she stayed more mentally stable than the rest. Her room was next to Arianna’s, who was just surprisingly good at being alone. She would find a new way to entertain herself in a different way each day. She was the youngest of the group, being 19 at the time.\n\nAnthony was in the first room to the right (next to Arianna), and from the first day, he tried to find a way that he could find a loophole in the experiment so that he could get some new scenery, see another person, or something else like that to maintain his sanity. Thinking about how to do one of these things was actually what kept him from going crazy, until he found out how to do it.\n\nChapter II – Into the Unknown\n\nEliza was in the farthest room on the left. Her sister, Lilian, had signed her up without consulting her first, therefore, she didn’t know until three days before the experiment had begun. Without being prepared and by being a “people person,” she fell victim to being alone immediately and began begging through the camera that she forfeit the experiment. After nobody came for a week, she lost hope and sat on her bed all day, every day, except for when she got her meals through the slot in the door and walked down the hall and back every day. She felt as if this would be her life forever, and that she would never see a face again.\n\nThat changed when the subjects met.\n\nMaxwell signed himself up, thinking he’d be fine while being isolated from all of humanity, and, like Eliza, let loneliness get the best of him. His room was to the right of Eliza’s. He decided that it was best to just wait for the experiment to end.\n\nAlly decided that she would sign up. She thought that if being put alone in a room would mess with her mind, she would just imagine that she wasn’t alone or that she was somewhere else. The experiment found that she was almost as mentally stable as before the experiment.\n\nArianna was just bored, and decided that the experiment would help her pass the time. She knew that the experiment would limit what she had to do, so she decided to keep herself busy every day with something else to do in the room.\n\nAnthony was tricked into the experiment as a prank and just accepted to enter it, but he knew that he would do anything he could to escape or find a loophole. That’s exactly what he did. How it went down was that he used his hallway walk to change the experiment’s participants’ walk schedule so that they would all meet in the hallway at the same time. He took an alternate (and half improvised) route to the dry-erase calendar that depicted the subjects’ time in and out of the room, meal times, notes about each participant, etc. He had to find a way to not be seen by any of the lab’s cameras or anyone in the building. He erased the calendar so that everyone would be out of their rooms at the same time. He hurried back to his room and waited for the next day to come when his plan would be put into action.\n\nAnthony’s plan would succeed and all of the experiment participants would meet at the same time, in the same place, and the experiment would be ruined.\n\nChapter III – Meetup in Hallway 9\n\nThe day had started like any other, and every experiment subject woke up at the same moment from a loud alarm through a speaker connected to the camera in each room. At 1:00 p.m. sharp, all of the participants began their walk. Anthony, being closest to the end of the hallway, arrived first to where all of the subjects would meet. He was quickly followed by Arianna, who gasped upon seeing him. “Another human!” she said, delighted.\n\nAlly turned up next and froze before Anthony and Arianna, before slowly approaching them and saying, “… am I hallucinating?… !”\n\nMaxwell was coming next, but Eliza came running from behind them, stopping abruptly when she saw other people. “The hallways are long and I’m the farthest from here… might as well run,” she said when she saw Arianna’s face.\n\nWhen Maxwell made it to the end of the hall and lifted his head, his eyes widened and he said, “Hello there… ” slowly.\n\nSuddenly, out of nowhere, loud alarms sounded from every direction. A voice echoed through the hallway. “MEETUP IN HALLWAY 9!” it screamed continuously.\n\n“Run. My room’s the closest,” said Anthony. Everyone ran to Anthony’s room, went in, and locked the door.\n\n“I guess we’re waiting here, then,” said Ally calmly.\n\n“Guess so,” said Maxwell.\n\n“We have to escape next,” said Anthony.\n\nChapter IV – The Tile\n\nThere were now 5 people in 1 small room with laboratory guards pounding on its locked door. The room didn’t have any openings other than the door, and for obvious reasons, it wouldn’t be the brightest idea to unlock it. There wasn’t anything to break a wall with in the room, so breaking a wall wasn’t possible. Eliza’s description fit perfectly. “Dead end,” she said.\n\n“There must be something that people use to get out of these rooms… other than the door… ” said Eliza before her voice trailed off.\n\nFor thirty minutes, the five test subjects searched the room relentlessly for an exit. Maxwell pushed on the walls, Arianna kicked them.\n\n“The floor… ” said Anthony slowly. “There’s a tile in the floor that’s loose. There could be something under it.”\n\nAnthony headed to the corner of the room in which one of the floor tiles was significantly looser than the rest, being easy to pick up. Anthony did so, revealing a gaping hole. The tiles around the one that had been removed fell instantly. The hole seemed bottomless from where Anthony, Ally, Arianna, Eliza, and Maxwell were standing.\n\n“Maybe we should drop something down fir — ” Ally began, but Arianna had already hopped down the hole.\n\n“Is it safe?” bellowed Anthony, but by then, everyone else had stepped off the edge of the hole and was descending into the floor except for him and Eliza.\n\n“Well then, see you at the bottom,” said Eliza before going after the others.\n\nAnthony decided that if everyone else had gone and the guards were nearly through the door, he might as well take the only way out. “Here goes nothing.”\n\nChapter V – Welcome to Michigan\n\nAnthony fell with a bang in a dark, sewage-like black tunnel. The other four were walking down the hallway it led into (well, Eliza was pretty much running again). Once everyone had made their way to the end of the hall, there was a large door. It took all five of them to open it. There was a large staircase that led to a busy highway. “What now?” asked Arianna.\n\n“We find out where we are,” said Ally steadily. There was a sign about 200 feet away from where Ally was standing so she started walking towards it. The sign read, ‘Welcome to Michigan!’ and that there was a welcome center close by.\n\n“Then let’s head to that welcome center,” said Anthony when he had caught up.\n\nArianna, Maxwell, Eliza, and Anthony trailed behind Ally to the welcome center in the distance. When they arrived, the people in the welcome center didn’t move. Probably because they were in disheveled, dirty laboratory clothing.\n\n“Welcome to Michigan… ” squeaked a small man behind a large oak desk. Ally stepped forward.\n\n“Look. We need a hotel. Where can we find one?” Ally said.\n\n“The next exit on the highway,” said the man behind the desk nervously.\n\n“Well then, farewell,” said Ally before walking out the door.\n\nEveryone arrived at the hotel an hour later. To the five’s shock, there were a group of reporters eagerly waiting. There was a wave of shouting from the reporters saying things like, ‘Why did you decide to escape?’ and, ‘How did you get past the laboratory’s guards?’ and, ‘Do you regret your escape?’ and with that, Ally said, “Now we face the media.”\n\nChapter VI – The Media\n\nWhen Eliza, Maxwell, Ally, Arianna, and Anthony had been brought to the Michigan Today news tower and offered clean clothing, the questioning began. There were sleek, grey cameras everywhere, and a woman with blonde hair sitting across from the five of them.\n\n“This is Michigan Today News and I’m Olivia Murphy with the five escaped subjects of The Isolation Experiment,” the woman said. “First question,” she said, turning to Anthony. “The Worldwide Laboratory’s cameras saw that the way you escaped was through a hole in your room’s floor. How did you think of checking under a loose tile?”\n\n“Uh — what else were we gonna do?” Anthony responded.\n\n“Next question is for you, Arianna,” said the newscaster carelessly.\n\nArianna jerked her head upwards upon hearing her name.\n\n“You jumped into the hole first. Why did you do that before even testing it?”\n\n“I guess if there’s a giant hole that seems to have purposely been put there, it must be safe to go down it… ” responded Arianna.\n\n“Next question is for Eliza. Why did you decide to escape with the others?”\n\n“If there are angry guards pounding at my door and an opportunity to get out of an experiment that is torturing me, I’m going to take it, of course,” responded Eliza angrily.\n\n“We have to take a quick commercial break, but we’ll be back with the Isolation Experiment escapees afterwards,” said the newscaster.\n\nChapter VII – The Isolation Experiment (?)\n\nThe Isolation Experiment was a famous scientific test in which 5 humans were placed in large white boxes with a chair, a bed, and a slot in which they would receive food. The goal was to put the experiment’s subjects into a psychopathic state of mind by isolating them from all other people. Either the scientists would watch them lose their minds… or they’d be a small percentage of the population that would find a way out of the experiment… through a tunnel, a welcome center, a hotel, and a news tower.\n\nBut surely, they wouldn’t figure that out.\n\nAnd even if they did, how could they know it had all been planned? How would they guess that it wasn’t just good luck?\n\nThe Lab also had an extraordinary reputation. Nobody would believe that they would set up a fake experiment and have five participants agree to that while actually just mentally torturing them, it was scientists from around the world’s word versus the word of five people with no proof. This “Isolation Experiment” was going to go just as planned. They couldn’t escape.\n\nBut could they?\n\nChapter VIII – About the Lab…\n\nEverything went wrong for the scientists at The Worldwide Laboratory. Their 5 test subjects were informed about the criminal plan and that there were phone calls, secret letters, and camera records proving it. They were told by an investigator that had become involved in the case. It had been in the airport that they were all set to depart back to their homes from.\n\n“About the Lab… ” the investigator started. “… it was all a plan. They wanted to watch you all lose your minds.”\n\nArianna gasped slightly, but in a way, that suggested that she knew that what was said was true all along.\n\n“They made the hole purposely… but tried to make it look like it just so happened to be there… ” Eliza said softly, apparently deep in thought, eyes staring blankly ahead.\n\n“I could tell that it was all fake a bit… ” Maxwell began. “… but I told myself that it couldn’t be… at least it couldn’t be happening to me.”\n\nThere was an uncomfortable silence, with no sounds but the bustling of the airport in the background.\n\n“When we all found each other at the end of that hallway, they must’ve known that we might have the wit to escape,” said Ally blankly.\n\n“Or perhaps they made the hole for themselves to escape in case they were found out and if the lab was raided,” added Maxwell. “Anyone’s guess, honestly.”\n\nThe people in charge of The Isolation Experiment were all arrested on the spot. It was one of the most shocking scandals the world had seen at that time.\n\nChapter IX – The Farewell\n\nAll five of them rushed to their planes to return home, but not one of them thought that it would be the last time, because who knew what would happen next to The Isolation Experiment Escapees. They were now considered as celebrities all around the world. Their story would be told over and over, the wondrous story of The Isolation Experiment.\n\nCh. 1\n\nDale and Artemis walked through the entrance. They were here in Steam City for Dale and Art’s work as journalists. A quote from one of his co-workers rang in his head: “Once they go to Steam City… well, they either don’t come back, or they come back almost, brainwashed. It’s almost like they encode their brains or something. Good luck, mate.”\n\n“When we get some information on The City, we can leave. Hopefully, what Steve said was a lie,” Dale said cheerfully.\n\nA hand tapped on his back. Instinctively, Artemis ducked down and swung her leg to swipe the attacker off their feet.\n\n“Whoa!” The guard fell down to the ground. “Jeez!” The helmet rolled off his head to show a young man, about 30 years old. On his armor was a small tag that said #56.\n\n“You’re new here. Don’t stay here too long! They’ll get to you. Don’t let them get to your brain. I’ve grown up seeing everyone like this. It’s not what you think. They don’t let us out of The City. I haven’t even seen the sky in my life! My name is Clyde.”\n\n“Whoa, buddy! Maybe try saying that a little slower.”\n\n“They encode the citizens’ brains. I’m resistant to mind control. You need to run. They can’t find me talking to you.”\n\n“How do you know we can trust him?” Artemis said accusingly.\n\n“You might want to hide the baby, too,” Clyde said.\n\n“It is our job to report things, even if we don’t have any concrete evidence. We have to do this,” Dale reminded.\n\n“Welcome to Steam City. Here in The City, we strive to make each and every one of our citizen’s happy. We have specifically designed every detail for our citizens’ benefit, and they are helping us, too. We hope you have a great time in our industrial utopia!” the speaker boomed in an automated voice all across the steel-plexiglass streets. Some children all of the same size were air biking, the exact same speed, in the exact same line. The baker walked through the street. A platinum-laced aerotrain showed up beside him.\n\n“You have been walking so, so long, sir. Are you sure you don’t want to ride on our aerotrain?” a person who you couldn’t tell was a man or woman with a blue and silver mask, symbolising that they were a train conductor, asked.\n\n“Yes, Conductor. I am thankful you came.”\n\n“It is fine, kind sir. This job pays very well.” The conductor held up a small graphite-gold coin. “I get paid 1 graphite piece every day! I love this job.”\n\n“I see we have some tourists. Welcome!”\n\n“Dale, I’m starting to think that guard guy was right,” Artemis muttered under her breath.\n\n“I don’t trust this, either,” Dale replied back.\n\n“I wouldn’t recommend being unhappy here. Things will start to go wrong.” The train veered off track and into a donut shop on the left side of the street.\n\n“Take Nathan and run!” The man ran across the street and almost to the wall. A single tear dropped down his cheek.\n\n“I’m sorry, Nate. I can’t take you with me. Try to survive.” He left the baby on the doorstep of a silver pod-house near the wall, saying a final goodbye. He quietly slipped under the silver wall.\n\n[Camera #21, broadcasting to Guard #56]\n\nNow that Dale had left the child in his hands, he promised he would not let it down. Clyde decided he should have started what Dale and Art hadn’t finished, and began investigating what went on in the chamber hall where the counsellor decided what to do with the city.\n\n[Camera #21, broadcasting to Guard #56]\n\n“What is this corruption?!” a sharp and icy voice called from the chamber hall.\n\n“I’m sorry, sir, the prisoners escaped! The child and mother died in the crash. The man escaped.”\n\n“Impossible,” the white haired counselor sneered. “No one can escape this place.”\n\n“It’s assumed that he had help. From a guard named Clyde.”\n\nThe counselor opened a digi-book, and skimmed through the pages.\n\n“Clyde… hmm… found it! Men, find Guard 56 and bring him to me! Remember, if it isn’t in order, it doesn’t belong. Unite through submission!”\n\nUpon hearing this, the guard who had been spying on the meeting hastily ripped his number tag radar off and hid it in a spot far away. Now they would never be able to find him.\n\nHe would begin a new life, assume a new identity, and play by new rules.\n\nCh. 2\n\n“Get back here!” The wind rushed in Nathan’s spiky hair as he raced through the plexiglass streets of Steam City, which used to be known as Vancouver. His beaten navy blue jacket and black and white edge corp games t-shirt billowed like a sail in the wind. The Chrometanium plated guards had their eyes locked on a shiny plastic object in Nathan’s hand. Nate hooked his hands on the hard exoskeleton guard mech suits, and hooked his jacket like a zipline along the power cords above the city. The guards clenched their fists and cables shot out of their wrists. The cables caught his jacket, and he lurched forward onto the ground. Nate was cornered.\n\n“Hand over the treats, kid! You got nowhere to run now.”\n\n“Who said anything about running?” He stomped on the left side of the storm drain, shifting its weight, and ultimately causing it to open. He landed with a splash in the drains of Steam City.\n\n“Ten steps forward… eight steps right… three steps forward. Five steps left. Ten steps forward… here!” He scrambled up a ladder right above a pod house, of which he was sure to be his. He carefully untwisted the hatch that would lead to the food storage area in his tiny apartment.\n\nWhen he opened the hatch, he was blinded by bright yellow walls and an electroplate. An old lady snored on a massage chair in the corner of the room. He carefully backed down the ladder and retraced his steps.\n\n“Stupid! Hmm, what was it. Oh! It was ten steps left and five steps forward!” He slowly made his way to the correct hatch, and into his home.\n\n“I brought snacks!” he called from the food cellar. Nate’s house consisted of five main parts. The food cellar was underground, or, technically speaking, under-pod-floating-over-ground. The kitchen was the fanciest room, consisting of a marble floor and an oven. On the countertop on the side, there was a microwave with a heat and cool setting. Clyde, Nate’s adoptive guardian, was sitting at the countertop on an old computer he had salvaged from a construction site. He greeted Nate with the usual refrain when he came back from getting food.\n\n“Jeez, Nate! Please at least try to fit in! If we get found out then — ”\n\n“The chancellor will find us and brainwash us to be zombies that he can control to his pleasure and ultimately our old selves will be erased from history, yada, yada, yada. I know!” Nate said quickly. Clyde’s mood lightened.\n\n“But… I guess it’s worth it. You really know how to run! What’d you get this time?” He looked at the box.\n\n“Jones box with rice and extra tamarind sauce? You know me, kid! What did you get yourself?”\n\nNate replied, “Chicken Curry,” he said. They walked to the counter and began to indulge in a feast.\n\n***\n\nMidnight… a knock sounded at the door… Nate got up from his makeshift bed and creeped down the stairs. They found me. He quietly opened the door, making sure they didn’t see him. He hid on the underside of the door.\n\n“Tell us where the child is and we’ll leave you in peace. The chancellor will make you happy. He will make you both happy.”\n\n“Never! You’ll never get Nate. I believe that he can liberate this city. He can liberate all the cities.” Liberate the cities?! I can’t do that. I’m just a kid! There isn’t anyone like me… is there?\n\n“Wait, I sense something. There! Behind the door!” Clyde blinked a message in their secret language that they would use in case of an emergency. He said,\n\n“Run. Don’t worry about me. I’ll handle this. Go.” Nate jumped up on top of the guards and soared onto the bed which suspended from the ceiling. He quickly hefted the plexi-glass frame off the window next to the bed and leaped out. He felt like he was flying — until he landed on top of an electrical pole next to a tall building. All those years of training has prepared me for this moment. He clenched his fists and a shock came through his gloves. Luckily, almost everything in the city was made of metal, so it wasn’t a problem leaping from building to building and climbing walls. What was a problem, though, was the huge jump in front of him.\n\n“You’re cornered.”\n\nNate panicked, not knowing what to do.\n\n***\n\n“The chancellor will see you soon.” Oh no… this is all my fault. I shouldn’t have been so reckless. Stupid Nathan! Focus on getting out of here! He scanned the area for an opening. I still have my magnet gloves in my pocket, but they’re out of battery. Well, it’s worth a shot. A warden came to deliver food. The gruel on the plate looked disgusting, and Nathan did not want to eat it. He pulled his gloves out of his pocket and slipped them on. When the warden put his metal mech-suit glove into the food slip, Nate quickly reached for his hand and pulled hard. The warden’s suit helmet clanged across the bars, making him fall to the ground. They say the suits can custom change the interior to fit whatever size… it’s worth a shot. He struggled to get the suit on, with so many complex parts, but when he managed to fit it on, nobody knew it was him. He clenched his fist, trying the suit’s mechanics out. A cable shot out and wrapped around the warden. He picked the person up and locked him in the cell where he’d recently been.\n\n“Oh no! That boy just escaped! Get him!”\n\nNathan tried his best to impersonate the steel-faced warden. Almost immediately, the guards flocked out of the door. He strode down the streets of Steam City, knowing he couldn’t get caught. Once he reached the wall, he tried to get through, but the guards stopped him.\n\n“ID card, please?” they asked in unison.\n\n“I can arrest you if I wanted to — ” Nate was cut off by the guards.\n\n“Rule number 85 page 56 paragraph two clearly states that guards can not be arrested. Impostor.” Oh no. RUN! He clenched his fist, and a sign that said, “No More Cable,” appeared on the screen attached to his left arm. I don’t still have that glove, do I? What if I did the magnetic boom with the metal hand…\n\n“Huh!” He slammed his glove upon the interior of the suit. The suit started to give out a small magnetic signal. It may have not been strong enough, but it was enough to scale the high wall.\n\n“Get him!” they called in unison. They shot cables out of their fists and grappled up to his height. Nate tried everything, but nothing came as a solution. He even activated a peanut dispenser in the helmet! He clenched his fingers, hoping for something to happen. This suit has CLAWS?! A pair of retractable claws shot out of the fingertips of the arm. I wonder…\n\nHe sliced at the cables aimed straight towards him. It sliced through them like butter.\n\n“Yah!” He pulled himself over the wall. “I’m free-aaah!” Free. Free but tumbling. Is this the end? His life flashed before his eyes. “Oof!” He landed in a junk pile next to a run down old store, which what was left of the sign said “Mac / onalds”.\n\nA creature that he couldn’t tell was Fox, Squirrel, or Seal trotted up to him.\n\n“Hey there, buddy… you must’ve become like this from the radiation, huh? These suits can block the poisonous air, so…” He picked up a helmet that had fallen down from the wall, and it fit right on the “furreal,” which sounded a lot like Surreal. “Hey, Surreal… do you want to come with me?” The Furreal wagged its bushy flipper tail and nuzzled his suit. “Come on… we have some cities to liberate.” They walked hours and hours through the wasteland, and they were both getting tired. The water and food supply stored in both of their helmets had run out and you could hear their stomachs growling from a mile away. “So… tired…” Nate moaned. “Wish there were people… ah!” He let out a weak groan as he and Surreal were hoisted into the air by some kind of trap. It was made of a metal cage that seemed to shock them every few second. By the second shock, they passed out.\n\n***\n\nNate opened his eyes. Where am I? Surreal?! He scanned around for his pet and found him on the other side of the room. There was a cool breeze, and a flickering light hung above a sort of scrap lab. In a makeshift door next to him, he heard voices saying,\n\n“The suit looks as if it was from the Steam City Unit.” A girl’s voice that sounded like it was Australian came from the other room.\n\n“What would a Steam City Guard be doing out here in Parallel City scraps?” a male voice said. Parallel city?! Surely they couldn’t have walked that far! It seemed as if they were children, but he couldn’t be sure.\n\n“What should we do with him?” a high-pitched voice asked.\n\n“Leave him be, once he wakes up, we can interrogate him.”\n\n“Help! Anyone!” Nate screamed at the top of his lungs, dehydrated. Four people shot out of the other room. The girl had long, raven hair with highlights of magenta that shot out only in the back, and piercing, steel eyes that could cut through diamonds. A boy with dark skin, and hair that looked like fields of chocolate shaved on one side stood behind his chair. He had two big round glasses on his head and wore a knitted, wooly sweater. Two children, a boy and girl, who looked as if they were of East Asian descent, stood on his right side. They looked like they were twins, but he couldn’t be sure.\n\n“Stop screaming like a baby. What even is a Steam City unit guard doing out in the scraps? Why are you also harboring a mutant?” Diamond Eyes said fiercely.\n\n“I swear, I’m not a guard! I’m just a kid!”\n\n“Oh no, no, no, no no. We might catch his mind control virus!” Field Hair headed for the door.\n\n“The control isn’t contagious.” The girl twin squeaked.\n\n“He could mind control us through the suit.” The boy piped.\n\n“Wait! No! This is complicated… I’m not affected, can’t you see?!” Diamond eyes shot a disbelieving glance at him. “Let’s do a test… the mind controlled always does what they’re told.” She picked up a matchbox, and struck a match. She handed it to Nate. “Go light that trash pile on fire.” Nate knew the obvious decision, but he decided to have fun with it. He slowly walked to the trash pile, and said,\n\n“Yes, master,” in a robotic voice. Right as he was about to drop it, he turned around, and said\n\n“Nope. I got you, didn’t I?”\n\nDiamond rolled her eyes. “Fine… you’re like us, and now you’re one of us,” she quickly muttered,\n\n“Oh, this is going to be a pain.”\n\nThere used to be a woman, and she worked late nights. While coming home, her car fuel ran out. She was stuck in this atrocious place. It was dark, and it had lots of trees. There was no street sign. However, she saw this building so she decided to go inside it as it was dark outside. She went inside and saw a man with a white coat panting and hiding in a corner.\n\n“Are you okay?” the woman asked.\n\n“You need to hide, I cannot say anything right now as I’ve just met you.”\n\nThe woman was shocked, and feeling scared. The woman quickly hid with the man, who was a scientist. Soon, before their eyes, a large jet black creature came upon them. Next second, they screamed. The woman and scientist were never to be seen again.\n\nThe scientist had created this creature by accident. Nobody was supposed to go to this place, but a group of teens went, and let’s just say we shouldn’t talk about what was found of them but that they were never seen alive again.\n\nThe creature was now in town. It had seen all the people and was ready for them. People were scared to death.\n\nEverybody was staying inside hiding. Some people HAD to go out for work. And those were the people who never came back home. Some people died because the creature had found them hiding, and some people died out of starvation or thirst because they forgot to bring food when they were hiding and didn’t have enough courage to go get it. In total, 150 people died because of these reasons. The creature decided to give up since he couldn’t find any more people and left.\n\nThere was this brave person who checked every day if the creature had left and that day when the creature had left, he cried tears of joy. However, it was never sure when the creature could come back.\n\n14 Years Later\n\n“Hope they don’t come after us, hahaha.”\n\n“Don’t worry, Dylan, they don’t even know who we are, hahaha.”\n\n“I have to go, bye.”\n\n“Bye!”\n\nDylan was a 13 year old boy who lives in a big village. He was the only child. He was born a year after the incident (you know, that creature coming to the village). His parents told him to always be careful of the creature, but he didn’t care. He didn’t believe that the creature was real, although sometimes he did believe that the creature might be real because of him remembering his mother and father running with him. There was something behind them that they were running away from. But sometimes he just thought it was a dream.\n\n“Mom! It’s not real. Now stop bugging me.”\n\nHis mom sighed. She wanted to convince Dylan that the creature was real so he could be more careful. But he just wouldn’t listen.\n\n“Mom always talks about this nonsense!”\n\n“Yeah, same. This stupid dangerous creature rubbish.”\n\n“Anyway, let’s prank Mrs. Robins today!”\n\nDylan actually planned to go to the place that the creature used to stay to prove everyone wrong.\n\n“Wanna have some Fuchka?”\n\n“You bet I do!”\n\nFuchka was a common food in their village.\n\n“I have to go finish homework, bye, Liam!”\n\n“Please say you haven’t eaten Fuchka, you always eat it!” said Dylan’s mom.\n\n“Sorry… I ate it,” said Dylan.\n\n“Haven’t you heard about our neighbor who ate too much fuchka and then threw up for one WHOLE day and wasn’t able to digest anything?!”\n\n“Mom, you know she threw up for a whole day, and wasn’t able to digest anything due to eating it for the first time. Her stomach didn’t recognize it.”\n\n“Go to your room now!”\n\nDylan went to his room and started his homework, thankful he wasn’t grounded.\n\nDylan was a smart student, and he was also clever. His cleverness would help him for something big that was going to happen.\n\nIn the morning, Dylan went to Liam’s house. There was no school and he figured Liam would be awake.\n\n“Hi, is Liam awake?” asked Dylan.\n\n“Yes, he is,” said Liam’s mom.\n\n“May I go inside to meet him?”\n\n“Sure, come in.”\n\n“Hey Liam, I need to talk to you about something.”\n\n“Okay? What do you want to talk about?”\n\n“Could we go outside?”\n\n“Okay?” Dylan said, confused.\n\nThey stepped outside.\n\n“You know that ‘creature,’ well, I was wondering if we could go secretly to the spot that it was hiding so we can prove everyone wrong.”\n\n“Great idea, but when do you plan on going?” said Liam with a smirk on his face.\n\nLiam also wanted everybody to stop talking about the creature.\n\n“Around 7:00 PM?” said Dylan, answering Liam’s question with a stern face.\n\n“Okay, let’s meet at your house though.”\n\n“Okay, see you. Bye!”\n\nAt 7:00 PM, Liam came to Dylan’s house. Coincidentally, a young boy stabbed a young girl with scissors by accident. Everybody was helping the girl and trying to find the boy who ran away. This gave Dylan and Liam a better chance of not being caught. When they went, Dylan told Liam to go inside and yell his name if something was wrong while Dylan would see if there was anything outside the hideout.\n\nDylan realized that the place was dark and had lots of trees. That’s it. Next thing you know, Liam screamed. Dylan ran to Liam, and whatever Liam saw was gone. Dylan kept on asking Liam what he had seen, but Liam was shaking and not able to say anything.\n\n“Liam! Are you okay?”\n\nLiam shook.\n\n“Sit down!”\n\nDylan sat Liam down.\n\n“You seem traumatized! Let’s go home!”\n\nThey went home. Dylan took Liam home and told his mom that he had found him like this. He then whispered to his ear, “Don’t tell anyone.”\n\nAfter going home that night, Dylan thought about the creature. Could it actually be real? Are we in danger? Thinking and thinking, he fell asleep.\n\nFor a week, he checked up on Liam every day, hoping he would get better, and if he could tell Dylan what he saw. One of the village people came running to Dylan’s house one day to tell him Liam had started talking. Dylan felt happy that his best friend was speaking, but also felt worried about whether he had told anybody what had happened. If Liam told anyone, then they would be in trouble and not be able to investigate.\n\nHe ran to Liam’s house and asked him if he was okay. Liam was stuttering and said he was okay.\n\n“Are you okay?”\n\n“Y-Yes.”\n\nDylan went to Liam’s house in the afternoon to talk to him about what he saw because there weren’t going to be many people around him at that time.\n\n“Hey, Liam. What did you see? Is the creature real?”\n\nLiam had stopped stuttering.\n\n“I don’t know what I saw! It was jet black with no arms and white eyes.”\n\nDylan realized that was the description of the creature. He sat/fell down with his mouth wide open thinking about so many things. Liam gave Dylan a glass of water. Dylan drank the glass of water and said, “What are we going to do now?”\n\n“I don’t know, we have to think of something,” said Liam.\n\nThey found out that the boy who stabbed the girl by “accident” came back. So to get their minds off of this for a while, they decided to go to the boy and ask him why he did this. The boy said, “I don’t know, I just blacked out and then next second, I realized I had stabbed someone.”\n\nDylan thought that when they went to see if the creature was real, it was there when the boy ran away.\n\n“Wait, can it possess people?!?!” Dylan said out loud.\n\nLiam then kicked Dylan in the leg.\n\nThe boy said, “Huh?”\n\n“Nothing! We were working on a play and we are planning what the monster does in it.”\n\n“Oh, okay,” said the boy.\n\nDylan and Liam then left and Dylan told Liam, “I think the creature can possess people!”\n\nSince it was the evening, which was a perfect time to do something, Dylan and Liam went to the hideout, Liam put some bright flashlights inside the hideout. His mom told him that the creature only struck at evening or night because the light blinded it. A couple minutes later, they heard screeching and screaming. They ran away from the hideout, hoping and praying that everything would be all right.\n\n17 Years Later\n\n“Remember when we hurt the creature?” said Liam.\n\n“I’m pretty sure we killed it. It would have no chance for those hot flashlights.”\n\n“It hasn’t attacked anyone from that day. Let’s forget about this situation. It’s been 17 years since it happened,” said Dylan.\n\nDylan had learned that he should have trusted the people. He became stronger and more sensible after that situation.\n\nThe creature had died because, even eternities later, the creature did not strike.\n\nI am a soldier in Nevada at Area 51 and see a UFO. I shoot it with a bazooka five times. It falls. My military team and I look at it, and we find the ship but no driver. We start fixing it, and when we’re done, we send it out for a test flight. It turns out that it works perfectly. We send it on a trip to our boss. He says we are lying. We show him that it flies perfectly and shoots laser beams perfectly.\n\nThe aliens\n\nWhen we take another trip back to Nevada, our UFO stops completely in the middle of nowhere and falls. Right before it touches the ground, the aliens stop the ship and say, “Why did you take our ship?”\n\nWe were scared so we left, running away, hoping they wouldn’t kill us. We call our boss and tell him to bring a car. It came in five minutes. We say, “thanks,” then we get on and it takes us seven minutes because we have to dodge the aliens’ laser beams. We get there safely, but terrorized. We outsped the aliens by a lot.\n\nThe Ship\n\nThe next day, I’m trapped inside a ship. We’re terrified when they open the door and start talking. To me, they say the captain’s name is Frédérique hunk. I’m the one to ask. Then I get a message and it says the alien cannot talk to me and that this is all training.\n\n“I made this training for you,” says my boss. I get so mad when I get out of the training that I go and skin my boss.\n\nWhat If They Existed\n\nI’m so happy yet so sad that I thought that the aliens were actually in the spaceship. I searched it five times but nobody was there. That’s when I start having an interest in looking for them. After five years of work, I finally was able to find them and they were in front of him the whole time. They were in Area 51 and all of them were there.\n\nAfter 10 years, I decide to end my career and become a guy that just lays out in the summer the whole time without doing anything.\n\nThe Marriage\n\nHe decides to marry his girlfriend after six months of dating. After a year, they have a baby. His name is Mort. After five years, his son decides to have the same interest and since they both have the same interests, his father gave him a lot of tips. One of his tips was don’t go try hard when it can all be in front of you where they lived in Area 51, because that’s where you wanted to stay and in his end, he shows me the fake alien ship that they found and he was happy for his life. That day was when his son found an alien, a real live one. His son and the alien were best friends. But I knew it wouldn’t last, it was too dangerous that night, he killed him.\n\nThe next morning, the alien is gone. The boy asks his dad if he had seen it. He says no.\n\nThe next morning, at 3 am, there’s a gunshot. His dad wakes up and sees the window open and his son is dead. They call the cops.\n\nThe Crime\n\nTheir first hypothesis is that the alien killed him. He says that’s impossible because he killed the alien and found out that it was just a robot from ten years ago from military training. So it must be something else and the weird thing is that we heard a gunshot, but there were no bullets on the body.\n\n“That’s impossible,” replies the officer.\n\n“Trust me, it’s true. There was a gunshot whether you believe me or not I heard one.”\n\nThere are no heart vitals. He goes back to his son’s room and finds a hole under his bed. He goes inside the hole, it was really deep at the end of the hole. He found a whole alien village. They see him capture him and put him in a cage.\n\nHe woke up in a cage and couldn’t remember anything but that he was in the cage. He tried getting out, but couldn’t. It was locked. He had no clue what had happened. He tried to remember and remember. He was in the alien village under his son’s bed and that he was captured by the aliens. He sees an alien and says, “Where am I?”\n\nThe alien doesn’t understand anything. I grab him by his feet and make him fall to take the key, get the security guards gun, and run out. I blast the gem that holds the village up.\n\nThe village is being destroyed. I try to get out, but it was too late. I ran as fast as I could, but I clearly couldn’t. I gave up. I tried to look at the village, but bam, one huge rock squishes my body. I was dead.\n\nI wake up in my house. Everything seems normal except that me and my family are aliens.\n\nThe Alien Family\n\nThe dad also has laser eyes. He is scared. He decides to kill his wife. He is desperate for money. He decides to go to a store. He points the gun in the cashier’s face and says give me the money. He gets $1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 from the grocery store. He decides to kill himself and burns all of his money.\n\nAfter he shot his wife, he robbed the store. At the store, there was a security camera with a hallucinating bullet. He did not die. He hallucinated it. Two days later, he woke up in a jail cell with six security guards around the cage. A guy shows up in front of him and tells him that he did not die. He told him that it was all a hallucination.\n\nThe Truth\n\nHe also told him that he had an important mission. The mission was that a meteor was going to crash into Earth and he had to destroy it before it destroyed the whole world. He had to go by himself in space. The guy said that if he didn’t do it they would kill him.\n\nThe Training\n\nOne month before the mission he would have lots of training such as being in a fake ship to be ready for the departure and landing. They also taught him how to drive the ship. The training was really hard but he passed it and went on the mission.\n\nThe Mission\n\nThe day he had to go he was terrified and he was not ready. Or so he thought he was now ready for the departure. At first, everything seemed to be all right until he hit a meteor. His ship was not working anymore and he had just passed the atmosphere. He was in the middle of nowhere.\n\nHe sees a weird pink, blue, and red type of hole. He was extremely terrified. The ship was going straight inside the hole.\n\nThe Hole\n\nAs soon as we enter the hole, our ship starts to stumble. I am super scared. We enter an alien galaxy. I could tell because I saw aliens floating everywhere. I was super scared as soon as I got off the spaceship. The aliens greeted me with food and jewelry. They thought I was a god, so they made me their king.\n\nLife As A King\n\nIn the beginning, it felt weird having all that power. But then I got used to it, life as a king of 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 trillion aliens. After a lot of thinking, I decided to go back to earth and dominate the Earth. While it had been 13 hours in the alien galaxy instead it had been 1,300 years in the normal world.\n\nThe World\n\nG__o took over the world and is keeping everybody as prisoners. He was planning on taking over all the galaxies. We had to stop them before it was too late. We had two days to stop his master plan. He had guards everywhere around the world. We told all the aliens to attack. We had a lot more aliens than they had. Something we did not know is that they have an A.N.B. (alien nuclear bomb). They destroyed all the aliens and me.\n\nThe Boy?___\n\nHe always wanted to take over the world and as he said, he would do until he found Gano.\n\nGano was the most powerful person or should I say robot in the world. He was the guard of the opusdelerami. This was a very antique gem that gave you infinite power.\n\nThe Story\n\nAs a kid he always got bullied. Everybody would make fun of him. Even the teacher makes fun of him. Until one day he fell into a sewer and found the opusdelerami. He didn’t know what it was, so threw it back into the sewer and went back up every day. He kept wondering what it was. Until one day he decided to go back into the sewer and got it.\n\nThe Sewer\n\nWhile he was in there he found everything but the opusdelerami. Until he saw GANO, he told him that if you would drop the opusdelerami, it would. You are lucky it didn’t.\n\n(GANO) I was about to die so get this ring and put it on so you will have any superpower you want.\n\nOkay fine.\n\nThe Ring\n\nThe next morning, I went to school. Became invisible and stripoed the bully’s face. I shoved it down his throat, made him poop it, and shoved it back up to his mouth. Then flushed his body down the toilet piece by piece.\n\nAnd did the same to every person who treated.\n\n“Calm down, Ivy!” my older brother irritatedly shouts at me over the loud music, as I am practically bouncing up and down in the brown leather seat of his car.\n\nWe pull into the parking lot of Topiary Garden and Tea House. Let me rewind. I am Ivy Marie Wildson, and I love iguanas. I have been begging my parents for an iguana since I was five years old. I am 12 now, and we found an iguana from Iguana Love Rescue online, and I finally convinced my parents to get it for me. His name is Albert Einstein. We are going to pick him up today. I get out of my brother’s Subaru, the hot summer air engulfing my body. We live in Miami, Florida. My mom pulls out her phone and checks the address the organization gave us.\n\n“Yup, this is the right place,” she says.\n\nWe walk towards the main building, the rubber straps of my flip-flops rubbing against my skin, but I barely notice the pain. Walking through the big oak door, the air conditioning relieves my skin. The man at the front desk has a friendly smile and a hairy unibrow. He points us in the direction of the manager’s office. We walk down the long marble corridor and come to a wooden door with a golden plaque reading: CAROL RODREGUIZ; MANAGER.\n\nMy mom knocks lightly, and a shrill voice yells, “Come in!”\n\nI open the door, just to see a tower of boxes guarding it. We slide around the maze of packing boxes, and just when I think they don’t end, my eyes come upon her. She has small round librarian glasses perched on the very tip of her long, pale nose. Folds upon folds of skin adorn her face, making her look like the world’s oldest person. Long, white hairs, bleached by age, sit on her tiny head.\n\n“Hello, dears,” she says with a smile full of yellowing teeth. “Tis so sad that I cannot bring Albert with me, but the apartment I am moving to does not allow pets. Please take good care of him.”\n\nShe carefully places the metal cage in my arms. While she and my mom take care of the paperwork, I sit on one of the duct taped cardboard boxes. I lower my head and look at him. I gasp. The first thing I notice are his brilliant eyes. One is blue, one brown. White tipped spikes adorn his green scaly body.\n\n“He’s a beau, isn’t he,” she says.\n\n“Yes,” I say.\n\nWe thank her and walk back out to the lobby, and out into the afternoon sunlight.\n\nThe comfort of my duvet cover hugs my feet as I lay on my bed, Albert in front of me. I stroke his dewlap, the piece of loose skin that hangs below his chin, kind of like a beard. My dad had a beard that would he would shave every morning, but it would still keep growing. I remember the night my dad left. I was so young, but it is one of my clearest memories.\n\n***\n\n“I want you to leave this house right now, Simon,” I remember my mother yelled, her voice stinging with sadness.\n\nI heard a door slam, and Travis say, “Mommy, where is Daddy going?” and then my dad grabbed his keys and whispered softly to Travis, and my mom said, “Daddy is going away for a while, okay, sweetheart?” and then my dad slammed the front door, and Travis cried, and Dad’s car started and ran over our mailbox with a loud crash.\n\nI remember him pulling out of our driveway and driving down the street really fast and Travis crying even more and Mom crying and yelling. The next morning, I remember hearing a stranger coming to the door and taking all of dad’s stuff away. For the next month, Mom cried every night, and I didn’t know why.\n\n***\n\n“Ivy! Bedtime!” my mom yells, snapping me out of my thoughts.\n\nI get into my pajamas and brush my teeth. I slip under my comforter, and my mom opens my door a crack.\n\nShe sits down on the edge of my bed, and I ask, “Mom, why did Dad leave?”\n\nI can tell she is surprised by my sudden question, and her face turns pale for a second, and I trace a hint of anger in her eyes.\n\n“We are not going to talk about that right now, Ivy,” she says, clearly angry.\n\n“Then when will we talk about it Mom?” I yell. “I deserve to know what happened to him!” I say, my voice rising.\n\nFor a second, her eyes shine with fear. “We are not going to talk about that right now. I will now turn off the light, and you will go to bed,” she yells, standing up, walking across the room, and flipping the light switch. She stops walking and turns around to face me. “I love you, Ivy,” she says softly, her voice now more scared than angry.\n\nBut I just turn my back to her until I hear the door close, then I cry myself to sleep.\n\nI feel my pale face burning red, and I put my head down and focus my eyes on the armful of books in my arms. I continue shuffling my feet forward through the school halls. Suddenly, I trip. Oh crud, I think as my face meets the cold tile. I hear snickers and whispers around me. I gather up my belongings but then slip on a history book and fall back onto the floor. I feel hot tears sneaking out of the corners of my eyes, and I try to keep them in. The sound of laughter rises around me, but then the bell rings, and the crowd around me disperses. I just sit there, willing my feet to get up, but they feel too heavy to move. All of a sudden, a set of hands appears and starts stacking up the books. I look up and a familiar face meets my eyes. He always looks the same. Curly brown hair. A face dotted with freckles. Calm hazel eyes. I nod a silent thanks.\n\n“You’re new here, right?” he asks with a small smile.\n\n“Not really,” I replied, my voice quivering.\n\n“I haven’t noticed you.”\n\n“Okay, well I’m here,” I say, starting to get agitated.\n\n“Are you nervous?” he says.\n\nI wake up in a cold sweat, the sheets twisted around my legs. That is the seventh time I’ve had that dream in the last month. Every time, it has the same scenario. I fall in a crowd of people and humiliate myself. And every time, there is that same face of that stranger boy who helps me pick up my stuff and asks me those same questions.\n\nThe next morning, Mom is gone to Alabama on a work trip, and Travis is taking care of me. I spend my morning playing with Albert and listening to music. Travis is working at Harvey’s, the local burger joint, for his day shift. I finish the newest Rick Riordan book, play some Mario Kart, build a cardboard maze for Albert, and it feels like this day will never end. I go outside and sit on the old creaky rocking chair. The rain stops, and it looks like a picture perfect sunset accompanied by crystal clear glittering waters reflecting the ombre of colors. The temperature is perfect.\n\nFinally Travis comes home, and the fight with Mom feels distant, like it was ages ago. He makes us some mac n cheese, and we watch the news. It says that there is going to be another storm to hit us tonight, but I don’t mind enough to pay that much attention.\n\n“They always say the storm is going to directly hit, but then it completely avoids us,” he says with a sigh.\n\nHis phone beeps, and he glances at it, but shields the message from my view. He gets up and grabs his jacket.\n\n“Where are you going?” I ask.\n\n“Out with some friends,” he says. “I won’t be back too late.”\n\nI turn back to the TV and surf the channels, but nothing good is on. I am about to turn it off, but suddenly, the screen goes black. Oh, the power must be out, I think. I hear the pitter patter of raindrops on the roof and the whooshing of the wind through the palm fronds. I pad my way up the stairs and into my room. I coo to Albert as I gently pull him out of his cage. Plopping onto my bed, I snatch my most recent library book, The Art of Racing in the Rain by Garth Stein, off my shelf. I place Albert on my lap and open my book. I have just almost gotten to the end of the seventh chapter when I hear a loud boom of lighting that makes me jump out of my skin. I cuddle Albert and soothe him, though it seems that I’m the one that needs soothing. I sit on top of the covers of my bed and suddenly, it seems that the world goes silent, except for the dripping of water from the ceiling.\n\nDrip.\n\nDrip\n\nDrip\n\nI put my old coffee mug under the leak and look out the window. I can barely see the front lawn; the rain is coming down in thick walls. I hear tree branches snapping and electrical lines sparking. I suddenly start thinking, maybe I should have listened to those storm warning signs. I huddle under the covers with Albert and try to read my book over the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. It feels as if the house is shaking. I can’t concentrate, so I go downstairs to get a snack. As I’m pulling the Goldfish box out from the pantry, the front door slams open and bangs against the wall. I run to the living room and don’t expect to see what’s outside. The sight is unbearable. The wind pulling the trees out of the ground. The streets are flooded, and it seems as if the sky turned to rain and is falling. Creak. Uh oh. Small particles of drywall float in front of my eyes, almost peacefully. Crash! I slowly turn around just to see a piece of ceiling fall onto the floor. My eyes widen, and I slowly walk backwards and out the door. I stand on my front lawn and look up at my house, the beautiful cream yellow house with white window trim and the bay window with the soft pillow, crashing to the ground. Then I remember Albert. I had put him on my shoulder, and there he was, gripping onto my shoulder in such a cartoonish way. His front claws hook into my tank top, and his back legs fly behind him. I reach out my hand to grab him, but at the very moment my finger touches his claw, he falls off my shoulder and onto a piece of driftwood.\n\n“No!” I yell.\n\nI run after him as he is swept away by the current. I scramble forward, plunging into the water, my hands feeling for his sandpaper scales. The current carries me, and I am blinded by the stinging winds. The street I once lived on feels like a roaring ocean.\n\nI attempt to climb up onto a soggy mattress, but the waves just pull me under. I forget to hold my breath; seawater filling my lungs. I thrash and kick, pulling myself through the surface. I gasp for air, and the cold, damp oxygen filling my lungs hurts my chest. The waves slam my body into a wall, and a searing pain cuts through my body. I fight to keep my aching body above the surface, and I try and pull myself onto a ragged dirt hill that I remembered sat on the edge of my block with the swing set and play structure. The dirt crumbles under my feet as I scramble up onto the small hill. I pull myself up and collapse on the wet grass. I sit up on the hill, pulling my shaking knees to my chest. I look up, the rain clouding my vision. I see a shadow moving slowly towards me. I hear a creak, then a crack. Uh oh. I see the shadow moving faster. I recognize the familiar shape a little too late. I let out an ear-piercing scream, and the world around me goes black as a tree falls on my leg. I come back to consciousness, and I try and bear the pain. I feel as if someone is splitting my leg open. That gives me an idea. I try and feel the rocks around me. I feel a sharp one and start banging it against the other rocks, slowly chipping it into a sharp point. I stab it into the stem of the palm frond and wince. I saw at it and attempt to cut it in half.\n\n“Urgh!” I clench my teeth, beads of sweat running down my pale face.\n\nI try and pull my leg out from under the palm frond tree. The blood circulation of my leg is slowly getting cut off from the rest of my body. I push my tangled, soggy locks out of my eyes and continue working on cutting the palm frond in half. The pain is so great that my leg is turning pale and numb. I would cry, but I have no more tears in my dehydrated eyes. I bite my bottom lip, the taste of blood seeping into my mouth. I decide to take a break, and I lay on the wet ground and start thinking. Suddenly, I sit up. I can’t believe I was stupid enough to not have realized this before. I connect the dots. Heavy rain. Fast winds. Loud roars. One word flashes through my mind. Hurricane.\n\nBloody Mary\n\nChapter One: Mary, Just Mary\n\nHi my name is Mary. I have short red hair and brown eyes. I am one of the youngest people in my fifth grade class. I have no friends. I have an older sister who hates me. I have a younger brother who hates me. I also have a dad that hates me. My mother passed away half a year ago. She died from lung cancer. She was the only person I was friends with. We were close.\n\nI always ask myself, “Why does nobody like me?” Even at school, I ask myself that. Everybody makes fun of me for having no mom. I don’t know why.\n\n“Why do you make fun of me for having no mom?!” I asked the three main people that were making fun of me. There were three people standing in a triangle. It was lunch time. There was a boy in the middle, a girl on the left, and a boy on the right. The boy in the middle’s name is Justin. The girl is Jessica. The other boy is Mark. They are all friends, but each have different friend groups as well.\n\nThe girl stepped forward and finally answered. “Because nobody likes you! You’re so easy to make fun of! Now it is way better that your mom is dead. You don’t have anybody who loves you!” she said. Then they all chuckled. I stepped one step forward to be right in front of her. I pointed my finger at her. I opened my mouth, but then just gave up. I walked away. I knew everything I should have said. I just didn’t say it. I knew there would be consequences.\n\nI was gonna say, “You don’t know what it feels like! You don’t know what it feels like to have the only good person in your life gone! It sucks!” I knew she would have just come up with a mean response. She laughed when I walked away. Everyone did.\n\nEvery night my family makes me eat in another room. I’m okay with that. I don’t know why they make me do that though. My family is starting to be nicer to me though. If I am done eating early, I am allowed to sit at the table with them. When I was in my bed about to go to sleep, I realized something about what I was thinking about earlier, that they don’t know what it feels like to not have a mom or the only good person in your life. I kept on thinking about everything I was thinking about saying and stuff that I said. I started to miss my mom a lot. Everyone who ever made fun of me will regret it. It’s time to make them feel like… me.\n\nChapter Two: Bloody Mary’s beginning\n\nToday was the day I was gonna start my mission. I am gonna kill the mom of every kid that has ever made fun of me for having no mom. So basically everybody in the grade. At 11 o’clock tonight, I am going to sneak out of the house and kill somebody’s mom. I will find out today. First person to make fun of me today, their mom will die. Then after, I will just choose at random. Watchout.\n\nI arrived at school. Ten minutes till class will begin. Jessica and her friends walked up to me.\n\n“Oh, hi loser! Still no mom? right?!” Jessica said. They all laughed.\n\n“Your mom will be the first to go,” I whispered underneath their laughing.\n\n“What was that you just said? Was it that you still suck? Yeah, cuz that’s right!” she said. Then they all laughed again.\n\nOnce it grew silent I said, “Sorry, in advance!” Then I pointed my right knee.\n\n“About what? How much you suck!” Jessica responded. They laughed again. Their laughs are so annoying!\n\n“You will find out soon enough,” I said, then flipped my hair and walked away.\n\nToday at school was so suspenseful! I have to keep cover and not let anybody know what I am gonna do. I don’t know if I can keep this up. I had to think about how I am going to murder Jessica’s mom. And I also didn’t want anybody catching me writing stuff down or anything. But at the end of the day I came up with what I am gonna do. I am gonna stab her with a knife, then cut off the handle with another sharp tool, clean it, then throw it in the bushes in the front of the house. I know it will be found, but I am okay with that. I have a black outfit that I plan to wear. There is also a black ski mask. I finished the job just in time then headed back to my house. I had no guilt that night.\n\nChapter Three: Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary\n\nIt was the next week. I had killed a few other moms by now. Still, no guilt.\n\n“Hey! Mary!” I heard from behind me, then turned around.\n\n“Oh, hi Ashley,” I responded. Ashley and I are kind of friends. But she has a friend group that doesn’t let me hang out with them. I definitely won’t kill her mom. We started to chat.\n\n“Did you know that the moms of some of the kids in the grade are being murdered?!” she asked.\n\n“Yeah! Isn’t so crazy?! They haven’t even been caught! What a criminal mastermind, right?!” I asked.\n\n“Yeah. but I am scared they are gonna kill my mom!” she said with a very worried look on her face.\n\n“You won’t! All of the kids whose moms died, are annoying and mean! Like Jessica, Justin, Mark, George, and so on,” I said and comforted her.\n\nShe agreed. “Thanks, Mary! I feel a lot better.” Then Ashley left.\n\nNobody has said anything about my mom passing. Except the people whose moms hadn’t passed. I have a list of whose moms I am gonna kill first. Victoria, Molly, Andrew, then Sophia’s mom. It was recess time and I heard people whispering. I walked up to a group of five people and asked what everyone is talking about.\n\n“Well, you know that a bunch of the moms have been dying?” one of them asked.\n\n“Yeah,” I responded.\n\n“Well, there is a rumor that if you look in the mirror and say Bloody Mary three times, your mom will pass,” he told me. I got really nervous because my name is Mary I thought they knew I am the murderer.\n\n“Uh, um, I am Mary! I am not a murderer what?!” I said really quickly. I was bright red.\n\n“Chillax! It is just a myth about a girl named Mary who killed people a long time ago. People just changed it for this situation. It is really scary,” He said. I said thanks then just walked away.\n\nI heard that the cops and detectives are closing in on this case. They said that it was a student at our school. So at school no kid will talk to each other. I finished killing all the moms. Still, no guilt. I don’t care about other people when they did this to me. Just myself. I am a queen. It’s always me, myself, and I.\n\nI walked straight to the park today. I just need some time to breath. I just wanted some fresh air. I still had no guilt, just checking to see if I did anything wrong with my murders, like leaving gum, or hair. The park was just two blocks away from my school. I would go home any minute now because I thought I was done. I was sitting on a bench. There were trees everywhere. And there was a bridge over water. On the opposite side of the park I saw two cops walking toward me. One of them looked at the other and pointed to me. They were coming toward me. I looked at my watch, then pretended I was running late. I started to run while glancing at my watch to make it believable. I got home in time.\n\nAt dinner time, my family invited me to permanently be allowed to eat with them! I thanked them. We were talking about the murders of the moms in my school. They didn’t suspect is was me at all. I went to bed at night, still, no guilt.\n\nChapter Four: The Interrogation Room\n\nDo you remember the run in with the cops last week? I sure do. They know the murderer is a child from the school. They just don’t know which one. There are five suspects. I am one of them because my mom didn’t die by this. And the rest of the people I just didn’t kill their moms. Each of the kids that are suspect, are going in an interrogation room. I went to the park bench again today. The cops were there. Thy were already in front of me. I couldn’t run.\n\n“My name is Officer Wells, and this is, Officer Smalls,” one of the officers said to me.\n\n“Nice to meet you! I am Mary!” Then I shook their hands. I acted really innocent.\n\n“I believe you know about the recent murders by some kids in your grade,” Officer Wells said.\n\n“Yeah, it is so sad!” I said.\n\n“Well, because your mom has not passed away due to this, as well as other moms, you are a suspect,” Officer Smalls said.\n\n“Oh no! That is really, really bad!” I said. I think they’re buying it.\n\n“Come in this Saturday for an interrogation,” Officer Smalls said.\n\n“Okay. Thank you, officers!” I said. Then they left. “Phew!” I finally said, once the officers were completely gone.\n\nI went straight back home to work on my alibi. It was Thursday. I only have a couple of days left until I go to the interrogation room. I have been to our precinct before. I have vandalised city property. The person on the case of my vandalism was Jack Smith. I also committed some other crimes, but I didn’t get caught. My dad says I might be doing vandalism to forget about my mom passing. Jack is so annoying. He is also the number one detective. "
