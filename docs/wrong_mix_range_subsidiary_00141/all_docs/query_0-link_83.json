Results: Sequencing of the bacterial 16S gene from dust samples revealed that indoor bacterial communities were extremely diverse, containing more than 32,750 OTUs (operational taxonomic units, 97% sequence similarity cutoff), but most communities were dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Deinococci. Architectural design characteristics related to space type, building arrangement, human use and movement, and ventilation source had a large influence on the structure of bacterial communities. Restrooms contained bacterial communities that were highly distinct from all other rooms, and spaces with high human occupant diversity and a high degree of connectedness to other spaces via ventilation or human movement contained a distinct set of bacterial taxa when compared to spaces with low occupant diversity and low connectedness. Within offices, the source of ventilation air had the greatest effect on bacterial community structure.

The first two floors of the building are primarily devoted to classrooms and share a similar floorplan.

Methods Study Location We analyzed bacterial communities in dust collected from 155 spaces in the Lillis Hall, a four-story classroom and office building on the University of Oregon campus in Eugene, Oregon, USA. This building was chosen as a study site for several reasons. Architecturally, Lillis Hall was designed to accommodate natural ventilation for both fresh air and cooling; the building is thin, allowing most rooms access to the building skin for supplying outside air directly through windows and louvers, and it has a central atrium used for exhausting air through stack ventilation. From a study design perspective, diverse space types, occupancy levels, and building management strategies were located in close proximity within the same building, making it possible to compare their relative influences on indoor biogeography.

Architectural Design Data Data on architectural design attributes of each space including function, form, and organization were obtained using architectural plans, field observation, and a building information model (Fig. 1). Spaces in the building were classified into one of seven space types. This classification system was developed for the present study based on the Oregon University System’s space type codes and definitions [40]. These categories are based on the overall architectural design and intended human use pattern for each space, and include circulation (e.g. hallways, atria), classrooms, classroom support (e.g. reading and practice rooms), offices, office support (e.g. most storage spaces, conference rooms), building support (e.g. mechanical equipment rooms, janitor closets), and restrooms. We measured numerous spatial and architectural attributes of each space including level (floor), wing (east versus west), size (net floor area), air handling unit (AHU) (13 different AHUs supply air to different rooms, so AHU is a categorical variable with 15 levels, one for each AHU as well as a ‘none’ category for rooms without mechanically supplied air, and a ‘multiple’ category for circulation spaces fed by multiple supply sources), and a separate binary variable denoting whether the space was only capable of being naturally ventilated by unfiltered outside air (e.g. via windows or louvers; 41 rooms) or by dedicated mechanical AHU supply (114 rooms). Metrics related to form and organization were quantified using network analysis (Fig. 2) and information from building construction drawings. Spaces were considered to be spatially connected if they shared a doorway or other physical connection that would permit a person to move directly between the two spaces. The network of spatial connections among spaces was used to calculate two measures of network centrality [22], [41] for each space in the building: betweenness, a measure of the fraction of shortest paths among all spaces in the building that would pass through a space, and degree, the number of connections a space has to other spaces. The network of spatial connections between spaces was also used to define a connectance distance between all pairs of spaces in the building, defined as the minimum number of spaces a person would need to travel through to move between two spaces. We considered using ventilation-based distance (how much duct length separates two connected spaces) as a connectance distance, however preliminary investigation indicated that connectance distance and ventilation distance were strongly correlated.

Figure 2. Network analysis metrics used to quantify spatial arrangement of spaces within Lillis Hall. Examples in the left column follow classic network representation, while those in the right column embody the architectural translation of networks. Shaded nodes and building spaces correspond to centrality measures [22] of betweenness (the number of shortest paths between all pairs of spaces that pass through a given space over the sum of all shortest paths between all pairs of spaces in the building) and degree (the number of connections a space has to other spaces); connectance distance (the number of doors between any two spaces) is a pairwise metric, shown here as the range of connectance distance values for each complete network/building. Since betweenness and degree strongly co-vary and are both measures of network centrality [22], they are considered together in some analyses. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087093.g002 PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e87093 Slides for UC Davis EVE161 Course Taught by Jonathan Eisen Winter 2014\n\n14. Human use patterns are a product of functional classification, but they also dictate form and organizational attributes of building design. In this study, human use patterns for each space were estimated based on a qualitative assessment of the expected patterns of human diversity and annual occupied hours in each space. Briefly, human diversity was defined on a three-point scale, ranging from low human diversity (spaces likely to be occupied by at most a single individual during a typical day; e.g. a closet) to high human diversity (spaces likely to be occupied by numerous different individuals during a typical day; e.g. a hallway). Annual occupied hours (person-hours per year) were similarly defined along a three-point scale from low (spaces that are typically vacant or occupied at low density; e.g. a mechanical support space) to high (spaces that are frequently occupied at relatively high density; e.g. administrative offices). Both of these human occupancy variables are explained in more detail in Table S1. At the time of microbial community sampling, ambient air temperature and relative humidity measurements were taken from each space. Relative humidity measurements were detrended using daily mean values to account for temporal changes over the sampling period.

Biological Sampling Sampling of dust was carried out with a Shop-Vac® 9.4L Hang Up vacuum (www.shopvac.com; #215726) fitted with a Dustream™ Collector vacuum filter sampling device (www.inbio.com/dustream.html). Dust samples were collected by vacuuming an area of approximately 2m2 on horizontal surfaces above head level for 2 minutes in each space. We preferentially chose these surfaces for sampling since they minimized the frequency of disturbance by cleaning, and thus likely serve as a long-term sample of airborne particles in each space [21]. All samples were collected during June 22–24, 2012. Building construction was completed in 2003, and dust has presumably been accumulating in some sampled spaces since that time.

SFig1. High degree of correlation between three beta-diversity metrics. Multivariate community analysis was carried out with the Canberra taxonomic metric; this choice results in de-emphasis of the most abundant species (as opposed to using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric), and also ignores nuanced evolutionary relationships between bacterial OTUs (as opposed to using the phylogenetic Weighted UniFrac distance). While the choice of a beta-diversity metric can impact results, the three potential candidates that we explored resulted in largely the same distance between samples in multivariate space. All three metrics are bounded between 0 and 1. Pearson’s correlations (r) are given in the upper right panels.

Conclusion Churchill famously stated that “[w]e shape our buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us.” Humans help to direct microbial biodiversity patterns in buildings – not only as building occupants, but also through architectural design strategies. The impact of human design decisions in structuring the indoor microbiome offers the possibility to use ecological knowledge to shape our buildings in a way that will select for an indoor microbiome that promotes our health and well-being.

Microbiome 2014, 2:1 http://www.microbiomejournal.com/content/2/1/1 RESEARCH Open Access Microbes in the neonatal intensive care unit resemble those found in the gut of premature infants Brandon Brooks1, Brian A Firek2, Christopher S Miller1,3, Itai Sharon1, Brian C Thomas1, Robyn Baker4, Michael J Morowitz2 and Jillian F Banfield1* Abstract Background: The source inoculum of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbes is largely influenced by delivery mode in full-term infants, but these influences may be decoupled in very low birth weight (VLBW, <1,500 g) neonates via conventional broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. We hypothesize the built environment (BE), specifically room surfaces frequently touched by humans, is a predominant source of colonizing microbes in the gut of premature VLBW infants. Here, we present the first matched fecal-BE time series analysis of two preterm VLBW neonates housed in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) over the first month of life. Results: Fresh fecal samples were collected every 3 days and metagenomes sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 Slides for approximately 33 Course Taught by Jonathan Eisen Winter 2014 device. For each fecal sample, UC Davis EVE161swabs were collected from each NICU room from 6 specified areas:\n\n27. set of n an LBW emely ition, 19].

Subsequent reassembly of metagenomic data from infant 2’s samples using the iterative Velvet-based assembly approach [54] generated a significantly better result. As >90% of reads could be mapped to the scaffolds generated by the Velvet assembly, this assembly was chosen for further analysis. The de novo assemblies reconstructed a majority of the genomes for 4 of the 5 and 8 of the 11 most abundant bacterial colonists from infant 1 and infant 2’s metagenomes, respectively. For infant 1, time-series organism abundance patterns in the sample sets analyzed via ESOM (Figure 3) defined five major genome bins for which between 37% and 99% of the single copy genes were identified, based on standard analyses of the single copy gene inventory (Table 4). For infant 2, time-series organism abundance patterns in the sample sets analyzed via ESOM (Figure 3) defined 11 major genome bins for which between 27 and 99% of the single copy genes were identified (Table 4). Infant 1 and infant 2’s gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbial communities are distinctly different. Infant 1’s colonization pattern echoes the canonical observation in infant GIT succession that facultative anaerobes dominate early phase colonization whereas late stage colonizers are primarily obligate anaerobes [12]. This shift is observed on day of life 12 in infant 1, but is not observed in infant 2, in whom facultative anaerobes were observed throughout the study period. The metagenomic EMIRGE analyses corroborated the binningbased compositional analyses in that no sequences for new taxa were assembled for scaffolds included in the ESOM. Some 16S rRNA genes were identified in the metagenomic assemblies and match EMIRGE generated sequences with approximately 100% identity. The E.

The maximum likelihood phylogeny of E. faecalis strains was based on a concatenation of single-copy, highly conserved ribosomal proteins from our data set and available reference genomes. Bootstrap values greater than 50 are shown. An excerpt of the E. faecalis clade is shown to the right. Next-generation sequencing surveys in the ICU have of antibiotic treatments [58]. Resistance to multiple types of antibiotics can arise from a single resistance mechanism reported high levels of community diversity. Poza et al. such as efflux pumping [59]. In addition to antibiotics, found 1,145 distinct OTUs in an ICU in Spain [8] and these pumps can expel quaternary ammonium com- subsequent studies reported 1,621 and 3,925 OTUs in a pounds (QACs), the active biocide in the detergent used NICU in the US and in an Austrian ICU, respectively [9,10].
