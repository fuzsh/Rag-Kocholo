        "text": "Aerospace & Defense Update\n\nAlphabet, Google’s parent company, announced its plans to sell Boston Dynamics, the legged-robot maker, as a result of internal disagreements and concerns about the Company’s ability to develop a marketable product within the next few years. Alphabet acquired Boston Dynamics and six other companies in 2013, as part of an acquisition spree to develop a robotics unit dubbed Replicant. Due to organizational conflicts, Alphabet recently dissolved Replicant and reassigned its employees to the Company’s X division, a future innovations arm that focuses on “moonshots”. However, Alphabet executives struggled to find a proper fit for Boston Dynamics, as Boston Dynamics executives resisted Alphabet’s demands to abandon humanoid robots in order to work towards solving transportation or logistics problems. Additionally, Boston Dynamics robots’ distinguishing feature, their ability to walk on two or four legs, is primarily useful for military applications creating further conflicts of fit as Alphabet stated it would not sell robots for military purposes.\n\nGovernment officials and U.S. aerospace companies are striving to develop new cockpit-equipment standards that would eventually allow aircraft to tap into local satellite-navigation systems across the globe. Recent efforts to draft regulations and common technical benchmarks aim to enhance airline safety by supplementing signals from U.S.-operated Global Positioning Satellites (“GPS”) with broadcasts from separate regional or ground-based technology. Although the concept has been discussed in principle for years, many industry leaders and regulators are increasingly advocating for joint standards with the ultimate goal of enabling more precise and redundant location information worldwide, regardless of airline or aircraft type. Industry leaders also outlined the importance of establishing signal integrity and availability requirements in order to address potential increases in intentional signal interference or hacking.\n\nGovernment Technology Solutions Update\n\nIn preparing its 2015 FISMA report, the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) found that Federal agencies reported over 77,000 cyber incidents in 2015, an increase of ~10% from 2014. The 2015 figure continues a decade-long trend of increasing Federal cyber incidents dating back to 2006 in which only 5,500 incidents were reported. Despite an increase in total incidents, the OMB found 30% were unrelated to cyber-intrusion, including mishandling of sensitive information, loss of physical data records, and policy violations. To understand if agencies’ cyber capabilities are successfully adapting to evolving threats, the 2015 Federal Inspectors General implemented an Information Security Continuous Monitoring (“ISCM”) framework to assess capabilities. Their findings revealed 21 of the 24 CFO Act agencies implemented low-level ISCM maturity; only the General Services Administration (“GSA”) received a favorable score of 91%, exceeding the 68% average. While there is still room for improvement, the OPM has cited significant improvement for areas targeted in last year’s cyber sprint, and is hopeful the $19 billion provision for cyber improvements in the President’s FY2017 budget request will accelerate this effort.\n\nThe GSA established its initial dedicated cloud computing effort nearly seven years ago; however, given the scale of the project, the agency continues its work of migrating to the cloud in pursuit of enhanced capabilities and reduced costs. In order to expedite this process for the GSA and other Federal agencies, the Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies (“OCSIT”) recently released a Request for Information (“RFI”) to gain a better understanding of vendors’ capabilities in the space. The primary aim is to create a robust portfolio of cloud products, tools, platforms, and services that can support Federal agencies as they transition to the cloud. The RFI focuses on five critical areas focused on both government experience and suggested contractor responsibilities. Primarily, the OCSIT is looking for contractors who not only understand the challenges that are inherent to government operations, but also that bring distinctive and innovative perspectives. By encouraging creativity and calculated risk-taking on smaller projects, the OCSIT hopes to leverage any insights learned from successes or failures to improve processes on significant projects in the future.\n\nBig Movers\n\nMercury Systems (Up 11.2%) – Shares were up this week after the Company announced plans to acquire certain businesses from Microsemi Corporation\n\nSmith & Wesson (Down 9.7%) – Shares were down this week after Sportsman’s Warehouse projected a decrease in firearm sales for FY2016\n\nTransactions\n\nFTG Aerospace acquired Airco Industries, Inc., a provider of displays and control panels for military and commercial airborne and ground communications and navigation systems. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nMercury Systems to acquire Embedded Security, RF and Microwave, and Custom Microelectronics businesses from Microsemi Corporation, a provider of high-frequency components and subsystem solutions for defense electronics, homeland security, and other government end-use applications. The deal is worth an estimated $300 million.\n\nMicro Focus International to acquire Serena Software, a provider of orchestrated IT solutions and application lifecycle management for Global 2000 companies and Federal customers.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed\n\nClick here to review comparable company analysis.\n\nAerospace & Defense Update\n\nBoeing, which is facing competitive pricing pressure from Airbus’ increasing market share, announced it will consolidate its 747 and 767 jet programs as part of a broader cost cutting initiative. Elizabeth Lund, who is the general manager of the 777 program, will head the newly combined programs in addition to the 777 program. As part of the cost cutting initiative, the company is seeking to reduce layers of executive management to both reduce costs and provide a more direct reporting structure. Boeing recently announced a series of promotions and retirements and as a result, the general managers for Boeing’s five commercial jet programs will now directly report to Ray Conner, Boeing’s Commercial Airplane Chief Executive. This leadership realignment provides a more streamlined reporting structure, which will strengthen the bonds between the operations and manufacturing aspects of the business.\n\nUnder new owner Lockheed Martin, Sikorsky announced it will be developing a weapons package for its Black Hawk helicopter series, signifying a cultural change for the firm. The specifics on the weapons package is still being determined, but the company believes its application spans across a wide international user base. The idea was originated shortly after the acquisition in a meeting between Sikorsky’s Defense Systems & Services unit and Lockheed’s Missiles and Fire Control office. Under previous owners United Technologies, which is not as focused on the defense industry, the two organizations did not have as many complimentary activities between them. However, under new ownership, Sikorsky is now part of Lockheed’s extensive presence in the defense industry, providing complementary capabilities and strong growth prospects moving forward.\n\nGovernment Technology Solutions Update\n\nThe National Institute of Health IT Acquisition and Assessment Center (“NITAAC”) plans to add additional small businesses to its CIO-Solutions and Partners 3 (“CIO-SP3”) Small Business (“SB”) acquisitions vehicle as the program reaches year five of its 10-year life. At the halfway mark of the vehicle’s period of performance, companies are required to recertify their status, with the expectation that a number of companies will no longer be classified as SB. While these companies can remain on the vehicle through 2022, the additions are meant to maintain CIO-SP3 SB’s status as an SB resource across the Federal government. There are currently 94 SB contract holders and NITAAC plans to make an additional 20 to 35 awards during the on-ramp period, with the intent to increase participation from underrepresented set-aside categories, primarily SDVOSB and HUBZone. As noted by NITACC Director Robert Coen, “We’re doing this now to ensure we have sufficient competition in all of the socio-economic categories” as companies outgrow their SB classification. Bids are due April 18, with an award announcement expected in January 2017.\n\nThe Department of Veteran Affairs (“VA”) received another low score this week on its cybersecurity procedures per a report issued by the VA Office of the Inspector General. The report noted “material weakness” in the VA’s information security, particularly in incident response, security logs, and identity and access management. VA Chief Information Office (“CIO”) LaVerne Council agreed with the report’s findings. To address these issues, the VA is requesting $370 million for cybersecurity-related initiatives in GFY2017, an increase of more than 100% from $180 million in GFY2016. The money would support the Council’s plan to reboot the VA’s information security procedures and policies.\n\nBig Movers\n\nBombardier (Up 13.0%) – Shares were up this week after it was announced the Canadian government finished reviewing a request for aid for the CSeries jet and will make an announcement within weeks\n\nVectrus (Up 10.0%) – Shares were up this week after the Company announced strong Q1 2016 earnings\n\nTransactions\n\nCTS Corporation to acquire CTG Advanced Materials, LLC, a provider of high-performance piezoelectric single crystals for defense and ultrasonic industries.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nTetra Tech, Inc. acquired Indus Corporation, a provider of IT solutions focused on data analytics, geospatial analysis, secure infrastructure, and software applications. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nClick here to review comparable company analysis.\n\nAerospace & Defense Update\n\nAlmost five months after the Air Force awarded Northrop Grumman a contract to provide the Long Range Strike-Bomber (“LRS-B”), Air Force secretary Deborah Lee James finally disclosed seven major contractors who will join Northrop in building, what is now officially designated, the B-21. James announced that Pratt & Whitney will build the B-21 engines at its facility in East Hartford, Connecticut. James also noted the Air Force’s decision not to go with GE aviation on the engines reflects a departure from the legacy B-2 stealth bomber. The other partners that will supply the airframe or mission systems include BAE Systems, GKN Aerospace, Janicki Industries, Orbital ATK, Rockwell Collins, and Spirit AeroSystems. James did not disclose additional details about which B-21 component each contractor will build. The Air Force’s decision to release the names of the key contractors is the first major step in the on-going effort to increase transparency and build support for the program.\n\nOrbital ATK featured a wide range of satellite and space launch, propulsion, and logistics technologies during the Satellite 2016 conference and exhibition. The Company highlighted their ability to design, build and deliver products to orbit for a variety of commercial and government customers around the world. During the conference, Orbital ATK announced it is close to signing a pioneering contract with Intelsat to launch robotic space tugs to extend the life of geriatric satellites circling the Earth. In addition to repositioning satellites, the tug would eventually fuel or repair ailing craft with robotic technology, which would permit satellites to be blasted into space with minimum fuel on board, generating substantial weight and cost savings. The deal is expected to be announced as early as next month and would cap a lengthy struggle to turn in-orbit satellite servicing into a commercial reality.\n\nGovernment Technology Solutions Update\n\nThe Department of Veteran’s Affairs (“VA”) announced the awardees to its $22.3 billion Transformation Twenty-One Total Technology Next Generation Acquisition (“T4NG”) program this week. 21 contractors won spots on the program, including 10 service-disabled veteran owned small businesses (“SDVOSB”), two small businesses, and nine large businesses, with all 21 having the ability to bid on any of the task orders (“TOs”) released under the vehicle. The contracts have a base period of five-years and a one-year option period. The program seeks to foster private-public sector strategic cooperation in order to provide information technology (“IT”) services and solutions to support “MyVA” initiatives, including health IT, telecommunications, cybersecurity, and cloud mobility to further support and improve veteran care.\n\nAs part of the Executive Branch’s initiative to improve IT interoperability, the White House plans to release the plans for a pilot program that will call for the sharing of source code amongst Federal agencies. The plan will call for agencies to release at least 20% of their new code as open-source in order to support improved access to the custom codes of these agencies. Custom codes are defined as those codes developed by third parties for specific agencies. As noted by U.S. Chief Information Officer (“CIO”) Tony Scott, “this policy is consistent with the Federal Government’s long-standing policy of technology neutrality through which we seek to ensure that Federal investments in IT are merit-based, improve the performance of our government and create value for the American people.” To support the initiative, the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) will launch “Project Open Source” to aid agencies in implementing the White House’s guidance within 90 days of announcement.\n\nBig Movers\n\nComtech Telecommunications (Up 7.3%) – Shares were up this week following a dividend announcement of $0.30 per share, representing a $1.20 dividend on an annualized basis and a yield of 5.57%\n\nFinmeccanica (Up 7.3%) – Shares were up this week after the Company announced contract awards totaling around $130 million for air traffic control management systems\n\nTransactions\n\nDrew Marine, Inc. to acquire NAL Research Corporation, a provider of iridium satellite modem and tracking terminal services. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nJet Aviation AG, a subsidiary of General Dynamics, to acquire AvJet Corporation, a provider of private jet management services. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nClick here to review comparable company analysis.\n\nAerospace & Defense Update\n\nHoneywell International announced that it is no longer pursuing an acquisition of United Technologies, roughly two weeks after it placed a $90 billion bid (excluding debt) for the target. Honeywell believes that a strategic combination will create value for both shareholders as both firms have complementary business portfolios; however, United Technologies has been unwilling to negotiate, stating the transaction would receive heavy anti-trust regulatory scrutiny and create resistance among customers. For now, talks between the two parties, which have been going on since last April, have ceased. In other news, Airbus received a $2.9 billion order from Air China for 12 A330-300 long-haul wide-bodied jets. Air China, which is the country’s third-largest carrier based on passenger volume, is seeking to increase capacity given the country’s growth in the industry. China is expected to surpass the U.S. as the largest aircraft market within the next two decades.\n\nThe Helicopter Association International Heli-Expo was held this week in Louisville, Kentucky with attendees ranging from corporate executives and government officials to industry professionals and media personnel. The conference, which provides a platform for many companies to showcase their innovative products and solutions, brought together roughly 20,000 attendees and 500 exhibitors from a wide range of locations. This is the first time Kentucky, which is home to a large and growing aviation industry, hosted the Heli-Expo. Aviation in Kentucky is estimated to be roughly a $10 billion industry and the conference will help bring more economic activity to both the region and the helicopter industry as a whole. During the conference, AHS executive director Mike Hirschberg stated that growth in global commercial helicopter sales will offset the decline in the military market. Military aircraft sales are expected to fall by 24% from 2016 – 2020, while civil rotorcraft sales are expected to grow by 32% during the same period.\n\nGovernment Technology Solutions Update\n\nThe Pentagon is currently accepting bids for Encore III, a $17.5 billion contract to provide global IT services to branches of the military and various defense agencies. The contract is the follow-on to Encore II, a $12.2 billion vehicle awarded to 14 unrestricted contractors and 12 small businesses in 2008. The final Request for Proposal (“RFP”) released by the Defense Information Systems Agency (“DISA”) reveals the contract as an Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity (“IDIQ”) with a five-year base period and five one-year options. This vehicle aims to further the Department of Defense’s (“DoD”) technology modernization efforts and “enhance combat effectiveness through greatly increased battle-space awareness,” according to the RFP.\n\nThe Department of Veteran Affairs (“VA”) has raised concerns from lawmakers over its GFY2017 request for modernization of the Veterans Health Integrated System Technology Architecture (“VistA Evolution”). The VA requested $50 million less than its GFY2016 request, causing fears that the VA is scaling back its Health IT (“HIT”) system modernization and interoperability goals. According to VA CIO LaVerne Council, the smaller request is a result of a business case study examining the framework set forth by VistA Evolution, and a re-evaluation of whether the VA should pivot away from the EHR platform. In light of their concerns, Council has reassured lawmakers that despite the decreased request, the VA fully expects to meet its goal of being interoperable with the DoD by the end of 2016, as proposed in the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nBig Movers\n\nEngility Holdings (Up 19.4%) – Shares were up this week after the company reported earnings that exceeded analyst expectations\n\nAirbus Group (Up 8.8%) – Shares were up this week after the Company received a $2.9 billion order from Air China for 12 A330-300 wide-bodied jets\n\nTransactions\n\nAlbany International Corporation to acquire Harris Corporation, Advanced Composites Business, a provider of advanced composite products primarily for airframe applications.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nClick here to review comparable company analysis.\n\nAerospace & Defense Update\n\nThe chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee (“SASC”), Senator John McCain, stated he will not authorize the Long Range Strike-Bomber (“LRS-B”) if the procurement is on a cost-plus basis. Senator McCain expressed concern of the additional costs associated with the contract structure and voiced opposition to hear the Air Force’s perspective on the matter. Following the Senator’s remarks, the Air Force revealed the contract will be divided into two parts, cost-plus and firm fixed price. The first phase, which consists of engineering and manufacturing development, is currently structured as a cost-plus with incentives. The Air Force and Senator McCain are scheduled to discuss concerns surrounding the project during closed briefings with the SASC and the House Armed Services Committee in the following weeks.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, Honeywell reportedly offered a merger proposal of around $105 billion, including debt, for United Technologies. The industrial titans have a combined $95 billion in annual revenue and share an extended list of overlapping products and customers. Following a decade of consolidation among aerospace suppliers, the two Companies are seeking to increase their leverage with their customers by demonstrating their expansive suite of products and technical expertise. United Technologies expressed concerns around a potential transaction as the merger proposal was a source of unease from major customers and regulators on three continents. However, Honeywell remains persistent and is continuing its pressure on United Technologies to remain engaged in merger talks.\n\nGovernment Technology Solutions Update\n\nAs part of the Department of Defense’s (“DoD”) Third Offset Strategy, it is reaching out to non-defense technology companies to help increase its technological competencies and harness the benefits of recent IT advancements. The biggest challenge the DoD faces is dispelling the perception that government contracting stifles technology advancement given an arduous and time-consuming acquisition process and a limited ability for vendors to develop internal Intellectual Property (“IP”). The Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (“DIUx”), located in Silicon Valley, was created to build and strengthen relationships with innovative companies, identify emerging technologies, and serve as a west-coast presence for the DoD. The department recognizes it has traditionally fallen behind in these areas, and has established DIUx to bolster military capabilities in preparation for technological challenges and opportunities in the future.\n\nThe Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (“FedRAMP”) has postponed launching its high baseline standards for cloud authorization by one to two months in an effort to reduce its existing backlog. Initially, in 2012, FedRAMP successfully vetted cloud providers in six months; today that process takes anywhere from 12 to 18 months, according to FedRAMP Director Matt Goodrich. Part of the slowdown has been caused by an increasing number of Cloud Service Providers (“CSPs”) and Third-Party Assessment Organizations (“3PAO”). To more effectively manage the workload, FedRAMP is working with stakeholders to redesign the authorization process to focus primarily on actual capabilities and security, rather than documentation. Goodrich expects the redesign to “make every authorization happen in less than six months,” and will provide a six-month FedRAMP update within the next two weeks.\n\nBig Movers\n\nUnited Technologies (Up 10.7%) – Shares were up this week following the news of a potential merger with Honeywell\n\nZodiac Aerospace (Down 28.4%) – Shares were down this week after the Company forecasted a recovery that will take longer than the 18 months initially planned\n\nTransactions\n\nCAE, Inc. to acquire Lockheed Martin Commercial Flight Training (“LMCFT”), a provider commercial aviation training products and services.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nClick here to review comparable company analysis.\n\nAerospace & Defense Update\n\nThe Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) denied Boeing and Lockheed Martin’s protest of the Pentagon’s award of the Long Range Strike Bomber (“LRS-B”) contract to Northrop Grumman. However, Boeing still has the option of pursuing the matter in court, and has suggested it’s considering doing so. Northrop Grumman was initially awarded the contract on October 27, 2015, but the decision was soon after protested. Now that the GAO has denied the protest, Northrop Grumman will resume its development and engineering work for the LRS-B, which is tentatively scheduled for initial operating capability in 2025. The LRS-B contract, which is expected to exceed $55 billion over the program’s lifespan, is the largest military aircraft contract since the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter was awarded to Lockheed Martin.\n\nAirbus Group announced it will not include its border security business in the planned sale of its defense electronics unit. The decision was driven by the border security business missing its goal to reach a deal by early 2016 on a border project in Saudi Arabia. For now, the border security business will be retained within Airbus’ Defence and Space division, but it could be sold separately at a later date. According to a source familiar with the matter, the removal of the border security business, which is experiencing substantial declines in revenue over recent years, is not expected to lower the overall valuation of the defense electronics unit (~$1.5 billion). As a result, the sale process of the defense electronics unit is expected to continue as planned, with a potential announcement likely to come within several weeks. The sale is part of a company-wide initiative to reduce its exposure in the defense market and further shift its focus to the aerospace market, where growth prospects are expected to be more attractive.\n\nGovernment Technology Solutions Update\n\nOn Thursday, IBM announced that it has agreed to purchase Truven Health Analytics (“Truven”), a provider of health data analytics solutions, from Veritas Capital. The $2.6 billion acquisition stands to be IBM’s largest purchase in three years, and the Company’s fourth health data-related acquisition in the past 12 months, after Merge Healthcare, Explorys, and Phytel. The acquisition highlights IBM’s commitment to expanding its presence within the healthcare industry through continued investment in data and technology solutions. Truven will provide IBM with access to various health-related data points from 300 million patients, allowing the Company to focus on delivering insights into value-based care for patients. Partially as a result of the acquisition, IBM’s stock rose 5.0% on Thursday, the largest single-day increase for the company in more than four years. The deal is expected to close before the end of 2016.\n\nThe President’s GFY2017 budget request proposes a significant change to how Federal IT modernization should be prioritized. The GFY17 $89.8 billion Federal IT request includes provisions for a $3.1 billion IT Modernization Fund run by the General Services Administration (“GSA”), which would encourage spending on modernized systems as opposed to continued maintenance of legacy systems. The latest estimates show that while only approximately 24% of the GFY16 $88 billion Federal IT budget was allocated to Development, Modernization, and Enhancement (“DME”), compared to Operations and Maintenance (“O&M”), the GFY17 request has a proposed 9% hike in spending on new IT systems. David Bray, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) CIO explained that modernizing IT systems should prioritize three things: first and foremost, agility; secondly, resiliency, cybersecurity, and continuity of operations; and finally, improving efficiencies.\n\nBig Movers\n\nEngility Holdings (Up 13.7%) – Shares were up this week after the company won a prime position on the $900 million Joint Enterprise-Contracted Logistics and Services Support (“JE-CLaSS”) contract\n\nViaSat (Up 15.0%) – Shares were up this week after American Airlines announced it is considering switching its Wi-Fi provider from Gogo Inc. to ViaSat\n\nTransactions\n\nAssured Enterprises, Inc. acquired Nova Defense & Aerospace International, LLC, a provider of intelligence, IT, and business strategy consulting solutions for aerospace, security, and acquisition markets.

The probe, prompted by a whistleblower’s complaint, concentrates on projections made by the Company about the long term profitability of two of its best known jetliners. Both aircraft are renowned for the technological advancements they introduced into the aerospace industry. The SEC investigation will be concentrated on Boeing’s use of program accounting, which allows the Company to average out upfront costs of manufacturing and the anticipated profits of planes over the full duration of production programs. Though SEC officials have not determined if a case will need to be filed, Boeing’s share prices fell 6.8% on Thursday, marking the second large drop this month.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Obama administration released its $582.7 billion Government Fiscal Year (“GFY”) 2017 budget request to Congress. The Defense Department’s request includes $71.8 billion for research and development (“R&D”), a 4% increase from the enacted $69 billion of last year. The increase in R&D is expected to provide a foundation for the Third Offset high-tech investment portfolio, the Pentagon’s plan to restore rapidly declining U.S. military technological supremacy. Over recent years the Pentagon’s budget requests exceeded past caps established by the Budget Control Act, also known as sequestration, however, this year’s request falls under Bipartisan Budget Act (“BBA”) providing the Pentagon with increased certainty on its funding levels.\n\nGovernment Technology Solutions Update\n\nPresident Barack Obama cited the Federal government’s portfolio of aging IT systems as a major focus area in his final budget request to Congress. On a combined basis, IT spending for civilian agencies, the DoD, and the intelligence community makes up approximately $90 billion of the budget request. “And I just want to say as an aside here [that] one of the biggest gaps between the public sector and the private sector is in our IT space, and it makes everybody’s information vulnerable,” Obama said. A critical component of the budget request is for updated IT systems and infrastructure to replace archaic legacy systems. In addition, the request highlighted the need for additional cloud adoption, the integration of interagency systems, and increased cybersecurity activities. Currently, 26 Federal agencies are focusing on the successful migration of their IT to cloud based systems and converged agency infrastructure, as well as improving their cybersecurity practices and protocols, a trend likely to continue over the near term.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Obama administration announced a national cybersecurity action plan designed to address fundamental security challenges exacerbated by swift technological changes and the migration of Federal systems to the cloud. The action plan focuses on three areas: (i.) substantially increasing Federal funds dedicated to cybersecurity; (ii.) the appointment of a Chief Information Security Official (“CISO”) that would report directly to Tony Scott, the Federal Chief Information Officer; and (iii.) the expansion of efforts to increase the nation’s cybersecurity workforce and public cyber-education initiatives. To accomplish these goals, the plan proposes increasing cybersecurity funding to $19 billion, up 35% from last year’s allocation of $14 billion. The fund would operate out of the General Services Administration, with set benchmarks the program must reach to receive further funding. The funding will be complemented by a $62 million increase in the currently $4 billion initiative to increase the size of the nation’s cybersecurity corps reserve, as well as the creation of a Federal Privacy Council designed to monitor the progress Federal agencies are making in securing their networks.\n\nBig Movers\n\nBoeing (Down 11.4%) – Shares were down this week after the SEC launched an investigation on the Company’s accounting practices\n\nAmerican Science & Engineering (Down 30.6%) – Shares were down this week after the Company reported disappointing earnings\n\nTransactions\n\nAssured Enterprises has acquired Nova Defense & Aerospace International, a provider of IT and cyber security consulting to sensitive national security clients.

According to Carter, the $583 billion budget takes a “long view” approach, as the U.S. prepares for challenges decades down the road. The planning of the budget was driven by several key factors including the rise of Russia and China, the threat of North Korea, Iran’s influence in the Gulf Coast, and the current fight against the Islamic State. For example, Carter stated that the Pentagon will request $7.5 billion for the fight against the Islamic State, representing a 50% increase over GFY2016 levels. Further budget shifts include cutting five of 48 F-35As from the U.S. Air Force’s original GFY2017 plan. It remains unclear whether the initial plan to purchase a total of 1,763 aircraft will be reduced. Despite these changes, the Air Force will fully fund the Long Range Strike Bomber and the KC-46 tanker programs. Moreover, the budget also includes the Pentagon’s $2 billion request over the next five years to purchase 4,000 Tomahawk weapons and fund the development of more advanced capabilities for ship-based weaponry. Overall, the GFY2017 budget request marks a “major inflection point” for the department as it looks for new ways to combat challenges in the short, medium, and long term. To combat all of the outlined challenges, the U.S. will not only focus on air, land, and sea methodologies, but will also increase efforts in areas of cyber, space, and electronic warfare.\n\nGovernment Technology Solutions Update\n\nXerox has announced that it intends to split into two separate publicly-traded companies, an $11 billion document technology company and a $7 billion business services company. The announced split, which will separate Xerox’s hardware business from its services business, effectively reverses Xerox’s $6.4 billion acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services in 2010. The transaction follows similar strategic moves by Science Applications International Corp. and Hewlett-Packard, and more recently Computer Science Corp. and Lockheed Martin Corporation. Consistent with these portfolio-shaping activities, Xerox believes that the split will allow both companies to refocus on core capabilities and subsequently be more competitive in the marketplace and increase shareholder value. Names and management teams of the new entities have not yet been announced, but the tax-free separation is expected to close by year end.\n\nThe Department of Defense (“DoD”) GFY2017 budget preview, which was released on February 2nd, includes approximately $7.0 billion for cyberspace operations. This represents a 27.3% increase over the $5.5 billion GFY16 request. Defense Secretary Ash Carter has cited the need to bolster network defenses, improve training for personnel, and develop the tools and infrastructure required to provide offensive cyber operations. The DoD cyber budget is expected to exceed $35.0 billion over the next five years and represents only a fraction of the DoD’s broader IT expenditures. The Pentagon’s request also includes $71.4 billion for Research and Development (“R&D”), marking the second straight year R&D budgets have grown. Carter has emphasized that the increased cyber budget and continued growth in R&D marks an inflection point for the DoD, in which the department aims to address long-term strategic challenges posed by U.S. competitors, particularly in cyberspace, electronic warfare, and space.\n\nBig Movers\n\nEsterline Technologies Corporation (Down 32.6%) – Shares were down this week after the Company reported disappointing earnings for the quarter in addition to news breaking out of a pending investigation for potential violations of federal security law\n\nCACI International, Inc.

The guidance sent shares down 8.9% to end Wednesday trading at $116.58, its lowest close since October 2013. However, Boeing achieved first flight of its 737 MAX on Friday, hoping to stay competitive against Airbus for the next decade in short-haul airliners. The first flight comes nine days after the first delivery of the rival Airbus A320neo and begins more than a year of flight tests to achieve certification by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”). The Company plans to deliver its first jet to Southwest Airlines in the third quarter of 2017.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain introduced legislation to repeal a provision that allows the unlimited purchase and use of rocket engines manufactured by the Russian company, NPO Energomash. The two lawmakers believe NPO Energomash is controlled by friends of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and argue that U.S. purchases enrich the Putin regime and fuel Russia’s military industrial base. The provision in question was a component of the 2016 omnibus spending legislation that allowed United Launch Alliance (“ULA”) to continue purchasing RD-180 engines from Moscow until a domestic alternative became available. The Russian engines have powered dozens of ULA and Air Force launches over the past decade. McCarthy and McCain believe the ban will facilitate a competitive domestic environment that provides the incentive to scale each component required to access space.\n\nGovernment Technology Solutions Update\n\nOn Tuesday, Lockheed Martin officially announced that it has entered into an agreement to separate and combine its Information Systems & Global Solutions (“IS&GS”) business with Leidos. Since the announcement, investor sentiment has been mixed. Initially, stock prices for both companies fell considerably and while Lockheed’s share price quickly rebounded, Leidos’ share price closed the week at $46.12, or approximately 15% off of its pre-announcement price. The $5 billion, tax-free transaction includes a $1.8 billion one-time special cash payment by Leidos to Lockheed. In addition, Lockheed’s shareholders will receive approximately 50% of Leidos’ outstanding stock, which has an estimated value of approximately $3.2 billion. In conjunction with the transaction, Leidos also plans to issue a $1 billion special dividend to its existing shareholders. To fund both payments, Leidos will rely on cash on hand, existing revolving credit facilities, and approximately $1.5 billion of new debt. The combined company is expected to reach $10 billion in revenue with approximately $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and would become the largest federal IT services provider, surpassing the newly formed CSRA. Management anticipates approximately $120 million in annual cost synergies by late 2018 and that the transaction will be accretive to adjusted EPS in the second quarter of combined operations. While the deal is expected to create significant revenue and cost synergies, some investors are concerned about the relatively high valuation of the transaction along with integration risks associated with the mega-merger.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force announced awardees to its Platform for Engineering and Integration Tactical and Strategic Systems (“PEITSS”) contract earlier this week. Of the ten companies that bid, six were awarded spots on the contract, which is valued at $538 million over seven years with expected completion in January 2023. Companies will support systems within the Air Force that provide tactical and strategic command and control capabilities and battle management. These capabilities will likely include surveillance, weapons control, and airspace management.\n\nBig Movers\n\nOSI Systems, Inc.

According to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, Iraq will use the weapons systems and logistic services to maintain its F-16 fleet functionality and support pilot training. Iraq currently operates four F-16 Block 52 aircraft and expects to receive four to five more fighters in the near future. Furthermore, they previously purchased a total 36 F-16 aircraft, which are expected to arrive by November or October of this year. In order to establish maintenance support and training for these incoming aircraft, roughly 400 U.S. government and contractor personnel will need to reside in Iraq until 2020. There are seven principal contractors for the sale, which are Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Pratt & Whitney, The Marvin Group, Michael Baker International, and the Royal Jordanian Air Academy.\n\nBoeing has announced that it will cut 747-8 production rates by half in September from twelve to six aircraft a year, citing weakness in the air cargo market. The four-engine aircraft, which was used more frequently for air travel in the past, has been overtaken by a more fuel-efficient twin-engine jet. As a result, its usage has been predominately for passenger air cargo. However, the air cargo market, which has been rebounding since late 2013, has cited weakness in the recent months due to sluggish growth in international trade. Boeing only booked two 747-8 in 2015 compared to 71 orders for the more popular 787 aircraft. The company will most likely address the announcement in their 4Q 2015 earnings call, which is scheduled on Wednesday, January 27th.\n\nGovernment Technology Solutions Update\n\nIt was announced earlier this week that Leidos Holdings is nearing a deal to merge with Lockheed Martin’s IT services business. With revenues of $5 billion, the merger would create the largest government services provider in the U.S., surpassing the recently formed CSRA. The proposed merger would provide Leidos with significant scale in the face of an increasingly competitive market environment as well as improved margins, which are expected to approach 9%. For Lockheed, the transaction would provide the Company with the ability to pay down a portion of its $8 billion of debt, which is partially attributable to its recent acquisition of Sikorsky. The proposed merger could take the form of a Reverse Morris Trust, which would be a tax-free event for Lockheed, and could be announced as early as next week.\n\nWhile protests have been in the headlines frequently, a recent decision by the Department of Veteran Affairs (“VA”) signals a rare move to protest the Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) guidance to reevaluate the basis of its task order of Transformation Twenty-One Total Technology (“T4”) to Booz Allen Hamilton. Following the VA’s initial task order to Booz, ASM Research filed a protest for which the GAO ruled that the VA should reconsider the task order. While the GAO’s decision is a suggestion rather than a declaration, it would be highly unusual for the VA to completely ignore the GAO’s directive. Historically, agencies almost always follow the GAO’s guidance, partially because the GAO submits to Congress a list of agencies which choose not to follow their recommendations. The GAO has until April 25th to make a decision on the VA’s request.\n\nBig Movers\n\nChemring Group.
