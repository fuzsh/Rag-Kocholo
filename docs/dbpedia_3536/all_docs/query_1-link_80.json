        "text": "Originally Posted by FINTAIL (Post 3693371)\n\nSaw Avengers 2. In 3D :D\n\nIs it worthwhile? A definite yes.\n\nLuckily they didn't take substantial time to introduce all the characters- Something which they had done for the first movie.\n\nOriginally Posted by BraveArc (Post 3690160)\n\nTell me.....Do you bleed?\n\nCannot wait for this to come out. Gonna be epic. It's irritating to think we have to wait till next year for it's release.\n\nGuess we'll have to make do with Star Wars, Jurassic World & The Avengers till then."
