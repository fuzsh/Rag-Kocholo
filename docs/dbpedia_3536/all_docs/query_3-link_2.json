        "text": "In the year the American science fiction movie 'The Black Hole' is due for release in cinemas, theoretical physicist Professor Stephen Hawking tells us the facts about this phenomena. Hawking was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in his early twenties and over the years his speech deteriorated. Understood by only his close acquaintances, in this interview a colleague translates as he explains his Theory of Black Holes.\n\nIn 1979, Professor Hawking became the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, one of the most prestigious academic posts in the world.\n\nThe East Anglian Film Archive, the first and largest Regional Film Archive in England, was established in 1976. Since 1984, EAFA has been owned and operated by the University of East Anglia, Norwich (UEA), to support research and work to preserve our moving image heritage. More than 250 hours are freely available online as examples of the wide range of film which attracts interest the world over."
