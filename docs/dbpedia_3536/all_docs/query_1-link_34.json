        "text": "Hot on the heels of Eddie Redmayne‘s Oscar win for his role as Stephen Hawking in “The Theory of Everything,” Working Title Films has released the first image of the actor playing a lesser-known pioneer.\n\nRedmayne portrays Danish artist Einar Wegener, later known as Lili Elbe — one of the first people to undergo a sex-change operation — in “The Danish Girl.”\n\nThe film, based on David Ebershoff’s novel of the same name, reteams Redmayne with his “Les Miserables” director, Tom Hooper.\n\nAlicia Vikander plays Wegener’s wife, Greta, who painted him in drag and later helped him during his transition. Matthias Schoenaerts and Amber Heard also star in the 1920s-set romance drama.\n\nRedmayne told the Daily Mail that he worked with his “Theory of Everything” movement director Alexandra Reynolds to prepare for the role, “observing the minutiae of feminine physicality.”\n\n“We’re looking at everything from a feminine perspective,” he said. “I think it’s the most sensitive role I have played.”"
