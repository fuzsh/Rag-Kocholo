        "text": "Earnest Pugh Stirs Hearts With Don’t Give Up\n\nHouston, Texas: The Leading Man of Gospel Earnest Pugh has inspired the masses for over 2 decades with timeless messages of hope and encouragement. He continues the standard with the lead single from Kerry Douglas’s Love Mountain Movie soundtrack— “Don’t Give Up” making its entrance in the top 30 on Mediabase Gospel Chart this week.\n\nPugh says that he wrote the song based on his character Elliot in the Love Mountain movie. In it, he encourages his son and daughter-in-law to fight for their marriage amidst opposition, tests, and trials and to never give up on love because leaving is not an option.\n\nAaron Carter produced the song. According to Blacksmoke CEO Mr. Kerry Douglas, “The song is applicable in various respects. Life is filled with hard knocks and severe blows. We are also in the fight of our lives for civil rights, rights to healthcare, and even our rightful place in the marketplace. I am optimistic about the impact of this single as a message to the masses on both gospel and R&B platforms.”\n\n“Don’t Give Up” is also the lead single from Pugh’s forthcoming 2025 full-length CD, The Outpour Experience, Vol. 2. This live Recording, produced by E. Devon Goodwin, took place earlier this year and features Sunday Best’s Tiffany Andrews, Ricky Dillard’s and New G featured soloist Neek Smith, and Blacksmoke Gospel Sensation and emerging artist Cedric Ballard.\n\nFor tour dates and bookings, visit www.earnestpugh.com"
