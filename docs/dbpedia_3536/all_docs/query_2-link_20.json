        "text": "Successful horror movies never stop at one film - Nun II, part of The Conjuring series, will be the ninth in the franchise, after all - but luckily, The Purge series has an interesting premise that deserves exploring: what if all crime, including murder, was legal for one night?\n\nThe movies have used the concept to explore the Purge's impact on different classes and races, as well as linking to politics - but not in order, it would seem, with The First Purge rewinding to explore the origins of such a dystopian event.\n\nTo muddle things even further, The Purge series also had a TV spin-off, meaning keeping track is much like trying to watch all the Marvel movies in order with the many Disney Plus shows.\n\nMore like this\n\nHowever, with The Forever Purge having come and gone, we have restored structure to the franchise's timeline - here's how to watch all The Purge movies in order.\n\nHow to watch The Purge movies: chronological timeline order\n\nWhile The Purge films are mostly anthologies with a rotating cast of main characters, they do mostly follow on from each other chronologically.\n\nThere are, of course, two notable standouts: The Purge TV show and, you guessed it, The First Purge.\n\nAlthough it was the fourth movie to be released in cinemas, as the name would suggest The First Purge is actually the very first instalment of the series. The prequel rewinds back to 21st March 2017, when The Purge was simply a sociological experiment limited to Staten Island.\n\nWhile the remaining films then chronologically take place in release order, the TV show slots in after the first two films and before The Purge: Election Year.\n\nThe first film's protagonist James Sandin, played by Ethan Hawke, even makes an appearance to link the universe together.\n\nHere are the Purge movies in chronological order:\n\nThe First Purge (2018)\n\nThe Purge (2013)\n\nThe Purge: Anarchy (2014)\n\nThe Purge television series (2018-2019)\n\nThe Purge: Election Year (2016)\n\nThe Forever Purge (2021)\n\nThe Purge Timeline\n\nFor those really into their Purge lore, the fact that most of the films take place over the same night every year means we can pinpoint the exact dates of many of the films.\n\nSpanning 30 years, here's the surprisingly coherent timeline of The Purge universe, which all kicks off after The New Founding Fathers of America take office in 2014.\n\nThe First Purge (21st March 2017)\n\nThe Purge (21st March 2022)\n\nThe Purge: Anarchy (21st March 2023)\n\nThe Purge television series (2027-2031)\n\nThe Purge: Election Year (21st March 2040)\n\nThe Forever Purge (2048)\n\nHow to watch The Purge movies in release order\n\nDespite a few prequels, The Purge films can still be enjoyed in release order, which is definitely the easiest way to watch them for new viewers.\n\nAfter all, the films mostly follow chronological order - besides the clear exception of The First Purge, as well as the TV series, which is an optional extra to your Purge movie marathon.\n\nHere's how you watch The Purge movies in order of release:\n\nThe Purge (2013)\n\nThe Purge: Anarachy (2014)\n\nThe Purge: Election Year (2016)\n\nThe First Purge (2018)\n\nThe Purge television series (2018-2019)\n\nThe Forever Purge (2021)\n\nThe Purge (2013)\n\nThe first Purge film - but not a depiction of the very first Purge - is set in 2022, when The Purge is accepted and an annual part of life. Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey star as James and Mary Sandin, a wealthy couple who become the target of a group of Purgers after saving a stranger from their clutches.\n\nWhere to watch: NowTV\n\nThe Purge: Anarchy (2014)\n\nOne year after the events of the first film, The Purge: Anarchy follows Frank Grillo's Sergeant who uses the night as an excuse to exact revenge on those responsible for his murdered son, while a rebellion group also starts forming.\n\nWhere to watch: NowTV\n\nThe Purge: Election Year (2016)\n\nThe only instalment to bring back a previous character, Sergeant returns to protect Presidential nominee Charlene \"Charlie\" Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) as she campaigns for the 2040 election on an anti-Purge platform.\n\nWhere to watch: NowTV\n\nThe First Purge (2018)\n\nThe fourth film rewinds back to 2017 to explore the political machinations behind The Purge, when The New Founding Fathers of America implement a test Purge limited to Staten Island.\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon\n\nThe Purge TV series (2018-19)\n\nFour films would be enough for most franchises, but The Purge slashed its way to the small screen in 2018 to explore its concept over a longer period of time. The show tackled new approaches - for example, season two followed the interim period between two Purges - and even featured a flashback starring Ethan Hawke to link the show to the films.\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon\n\nThe Forever Purge (2021)\n\nTaking place eight years after The Purge: Election Year, the film sees the New Founding Fathers of America reinstate the annual Purge after an eight-year absence - until an anti-immigration hate group continues purging long after daybreak.\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nWhere to watch The Purge movies\n\nSorry for those feeling the urge to Purge online - The Purge films are sadly not all available on a single streaming service. The first three films - The Purge, The Purge: Anarchy and The Purge: Election Year - are available on NowTV (£6.99-£9.99 a month). Both seasons of The Purge television show are available on Amazon Prime (£8.99 a month) for no extra cost.\n\nThe First Purge can be bought on Blu-ray for £2.99 from Amazon and finally, The Forever Purge can be streamed on Netflix (£4.99, £10.99, £15.99)."
