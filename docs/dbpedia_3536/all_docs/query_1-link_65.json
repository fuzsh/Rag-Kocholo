        "text": "'Devon Pravesh'\n\nDevon begins his residency with a text from Conrad \"Meet me in Physical therapy. Try not to be a dick.\" When they meet in Devon's eye it was one of the worst meetings. Conrad tells him to take his tie off, he's not in Harvard anymore. Conrad asked him what he was into. He was asking him what his type was. Devon scoffs in disbelief, stating, \"I don't understand\". Devon was not prepared, going from professional people to Conrad. A man who works in his own way. Conrad brags a little about scoring higher on \"19 first authors\". Devon scores 267 while Conrad scored 280. After a couple hours or so, Devon walks up to Nic saying he needs a new residence. Nic, however, convinces him this was not the best idea. Saying that Devon could with a mechanic whos polite nice, runs all the test but charges you thousands to fix the car. Only to find out when your driving home you hear the same rattle. You could have that or you could have a mechanic that is rude, arrogant, and annoying but fixes the rattle and only charges $5. Devon sticks with Conrad seeing as he had no choice.\n\nOver time, without admitting it, Devon sees that while Conrad was rude and arrogant. Conrad was good at he does and gets results. The two work well along with each. Of course, there's a lot of disagreement along the way, fights, and rule-breaking. However, the two get the job done. The two do occasionally hang outside of work at a bar. As Conrad, Devon and Nic work on taking down Lane Hunter they all become closer. Sometimes at one or another's house. The two do care for each other and will show from time to time. When Conrad sprained his ankle after crashing into a biker while running. Devon admits Conrad as a patient under his care. He refused to let Conrad blow him off. It took until almost the end of the shift for Conrad to finally admit he needed help. Conrad talked to Devon about several things, several first while working.\n\nWhile the two may not be best friends, they are close to each other. Caring for one another and helping each other along the way. Conrad picks on him along the way, but does it to push Devon into becoming a great doctor.\n\nIn A Wedding, A Funeral, Conrad had asked Devon to be his best man, but Devon had to go be with his family due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent death of his father.}}\n\nKit Voss Kit and Conrad, when seen together are clearly seen to support one another, especially when Kit is emotionally attached to patients in which Conrad often helps her out.\n\nInitially, Bell and Conrad's relationship was terrible, they argued many times, especially over patients because of Conrad breaking rules to save lives, in more recent seasons, Bell and Conrad are shown to have somewhat fixed their relationship with Conrad even calling Bell his friend on one occasion."
