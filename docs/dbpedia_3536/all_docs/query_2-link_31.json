        "text": "In 2007, DC kicked off their line of DCU Animated Original Movies, a more dark and adult-skewing franchise that has pleased comic book fans and has now grown to over 40 films! To help you navigate this impressive library, we’ve put together a guide on how to watch the DC animated movies in order!\n\nIn the beginning, the DCU animated original movies were mostly stand-alone (Superman: Doomsday, Wonder Woman, Batman: Under the Red Hood) or formed their own brief line-up like Year One combined with the two-part Dark Knight Returns.\n\nBut starting in 2013, the movies mainly stuck to a single continuity known as the DC Animated Movie Universe, a 16-part arc that starts with Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox and ending with 2020’s Justice League Dark: Apokolips War. Here’s how to watch the DC Animated Movie Universe in order:\n\nJustice League: The Flashpoint Paradox (2013)\n\nJustice League: War (2014)\n\nSon of Batman (2014)\n\nJustice League: Throne of Atlantis (2015)\n\nBatman vs. Robin (2015)\n\nBatman: Bad Blood (2016)\n\nJustice League vs. Teen Titans (2016)\n\nJustice League Dark (2017)\n\nTeen Titans: The Judas Contract (2017)\n\nSuicide Squad: Hell to Pay (2018)\n\nThe Death of Superman (2018)\n\nConstantine: City of Demons (2018)\n\nReign of the Supermen (2019)\n\nBatman: Hush (2019)\n\nWonder Woman: Bloodlines (2019)\n\nJustice League Dark: Apokolips War (2020)\n\nSince then, the DC Universe Animated Original Movies have returned to standalone films (Batman: Soul of the Dragon, Injustice) and setting up the new Tomorrowverse, which includes Superman: Man of Tomorrow, Justice Society: World War II, the two-part Long Halloween, and Green Lantern: Beware My Power. In fact, the Tomorrowverse has gone on long enough to warrant its own bulleted list:\n\nSuperman: Man of Tomorrow (2020)\n\nJustice Society: World War II (2021)\n\nBatman: The Long Halloween, Part One & Two (2021)\n\nGreen Lantern: Beware My Power (2022)\n\nLegion of Super-Heroes (2023)\n\nJustice League: Warworld (2023)\n\nJustice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths – Part One (2024)\n\nJustice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths – Part Two (2024)\n\nRead on to see the DC Universe Animated Original Movies in order of release, including standalone, DC Animated Universe, and Tomorrowverse movies! —Alex Vo\n\n#1\n\nSuperman: Doomsday (2007) 57%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 17745%\n\nCritics Consensus: No consensus yet.\n\nSynopsis: The Man of Steel (Adam Baldwin) battles an intergalactic killer, accidentally unearthed by a corporation....
