Mark Wielosz, detachment commander for the Strathmore RCMP, said Wednesday investigators are now looking into a white 2013 Dodge RAM with teal aftermarket rims and bullet shell shaped lug nuts that was stolen from the 400 block of Abadan Place N.E. in Calgary, just before 6 a.m. on Monday.\n\nWielosz said investigators are looking for witnesses or footage of that truck or its occupants from the time of the theft to the time of the shooting.\n\nAn image of the truck has been released.\n\nInvestigators are now looking into a white 2013 Dodge RAM with teal aftermarket rims and bullet shell shaped lug nuts that was stolen from the 400 block of Abadan Place N.E. in Calgary, in connection with a deadly shooting east of Calgary. (Supplied: RCMP)\n\nWielosz said the suspects fled the scene in a white half-ton pickup truck, which was a Rocky View County fleet vehicle.\n\nPolice tracked the vehicle to another location, near Township Road 252 and Range Road 260.\n\nThe vehicle had been dumped and the suspects were no longer in the area.\n\nAs of Wednesday evening, the suspects remained at large and were considered to be armed and dangerous.\n\n\"We do not have enough information to provide the public with firm descriptors of these subjects,\" Wielosz said.\n\nWielosz said the motive for the violence is unknown.\n\nBut he also said the immediate danger in the area is believed to be over.\n\n\"At this point in time, I would say the risk level is low,\" he said.\n\n\"We don't believe these offenders are in the area. We don't believe that they're coming back.\""
