        "text": "So they’re making a movie about your life? Sounds great — until they screw up the historical details or, worst of all, cast Ashton Kutcher in the lead role.\n\nBiopics can be dicey business, especially for the real-life figures who inspire them. Not everyone is honored by the process or likes the end result.\n\nLast year was a ridiculously busy one for biopics. And many of those films ended up making the Oscar nomination list.\n\nWe’ll learn soon enough how the Academy voters feel about these films, but how about the actual figures? Take a look:\n\n‘Wild’\n\nReese Witherspoon plays Cheryl Strayed, a once-troubled woman who decided to undertake a 1,100-mile solo hike through the wilderness.\n\nThe real Strayed was heavily involved in the filmmaking process and offered Witherspoon plenty of pointers. She also has said that director Jean-Marc Vallée valued her input.\n\nNo surprise, then, that Strayed liked “Wild.”\n\n“It’s funny, it never occurred to me that a movie star would play me,” she told Mother Jones. “But now that she is playing me, it’s like, of course, it couldn’t be anyone else . . . Watching the movie for me is uncanny, because they have her wearing the clothes I wore . . . She just became me in a way that’s like, shocking.”\n\n‘American Sniper’\n\nThe story of the military’s most lethal marksman has stirred up plenty of controversy since it was released in December — just not any with Chris Kyle’s widow, Taya.\n\nShe’s been actively promoting the film and is happy with it. She’s called the making of “American Sniper” “healing” for her.\n\n“[Screenwriter] Jason Hall spent all this time with me, and I’m talking about my memories and my life and my love, and the love of Chris toward me and the kids,” Taya told USA Today. “It was healing for me to be able to give that, and to be able to preserve some of those memories in a different way. It’s been a really beautiful thing.”\n\n‘Selma’\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.’s family has a complicated relationship with “Selma,” the movie that portrays the civil rights leader’s Alabama march.\n\nKing’s children are involved in a competing Steven Spielberg biopic about their late father, and as a result, the heirs did not cooperate with “Selma” or allow the filmmakers to use the text of King’s actual speeches.\n\nThe family has, however, attended screenings at the studio’s invitation and offered generally positive feedback.\n\n“The film shows that through endurance, you can be successful, and you can do it in a peaceful way,” Martin Luther King III told Variety. “These issues have been here for a long time. But Dr. King’s example showed us that if we are resilient, if we stay the course, we can in fact bring about change.”\n\nKing III was skeptical about the accuracy of “Selma” when it came to portraying his mother and father’s relationship.\n\n“How would [director] Ava DuVernay know what existed in the bedroom of my mom and dad? You really have to create some of that,” King III said. “Under the circumstances, I think that the film did the best it could.”\n\n‘The Imitation Game’\n\nThe film centers on the efforts of British mathematician Alan Turing to break a Nazi code during World War II. Turing died in 1954. He was gay and did not have any children.\n\nHis niece, Rachel Barnes, is apparently enthusiastic about the movie. She has attended screenings and also signed a petition inspired by “The Imitation Game” asking the British government to pardon homosexuals who were convicted under indecency laws.\n\nThe family of Alastair Denniston, the commander at Bletchley Park played by Charles Dance, is less enthusiastic. They’ve complained that the portrayal of Denniston as a villain who worked to hamper Turing’s efforts is false.\n\n“He is completely misrepresented,” granddaughter Judith Finch wrote in a letter to the Daily Telegraph. “They needed a baddy and they’ve put him in there without researching the truth about the contribution he made.”\n\n‘Foxcatcher’\n\nTell us how you really feel about “Foxcatcher,” Mark Schultz.\n\n“I HATE [director] BENNETT MILLER,” Schultz tweeted last December. “I HATE EVERYTHING THAT SCUM TOUCHES. EVERYTHING!!!”\n\n“YOU THINK I’M GOING TO SIT BACK AND WATCH YOU DESTROY MY NAME AND REPUTATION I SWEAT BLOOD FOR. YOU AINT’ SEEN NOTHING YET DUDE,” he also wrote. The tweets were later deleted, and Schultz apologized.\n\nSchultz, who is played by Channing Tatum in the wrestling-world biopic, had been critical of the film late last year. In a Facebook post, he called it “primarily fiction.”\n\nHe was especially upset by a scene that suggests that the character based on him had a sexual relationship with John Du Pont (Steve Carell). Schultz has said that he asked Miller to cut the scene, but the director refused.\n\nHowever, Schultz appears to have now made peace with the film and its portrayal of him.\n\n‘The Theory of Everything’\n\nThe biopic about physicist Stephen Hawking gets mixed reviews from its two main players.\n\nHawking himself has praised star Eddie Redmayne, calling the film “broadly true.”\n\n“I thought Eddie Redmayne portrayed me very well in ‘The Theory of Everything’ movie,” Hawking wrote on his Facebook page. “He spent time with ALS sufferers so he could be authentic. At times, I thought he was me.”\n\nHawking’s ex-wife and current partner, Jane, doesn’t appear to be as enthusiastic, though she has said it’s a “great privilege” to have a film made about her and her ex-husband."
