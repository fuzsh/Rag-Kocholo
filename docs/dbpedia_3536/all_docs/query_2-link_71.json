        "text": "Drakeford back in government as health secretary\n\nFormer first minister Mark Drakeford is returning to government after being appointed as health secretary by Eluned Morgan.\n\nMs Morgan said he would do the job on an \"interim basis\" and \"bring his significant knowledge and experience to bear to continue our work to improve transparency and delivery\".\n\nMs Morgan, who became Wales' first female first minister on Tuesday, led the health department from 2021 until she took Welsh Labour's top job.\n\nMr Drakeford, who stood down in March after five years as first minister, previously served as health minister between 2013 and 2016.\n\nMs Morgan also confirmed the appointment of Climate Change and Rural Affairs Secretary Huw Irranca-Davies as deputy first minister.\n\nHe stood on a \"joint unity ticket\" with Ms Morgan for the Welsh Labour leadership.\n\nMs Morgan said he would \"support me in my role as first minister and will work alongside me to deliver for the people for Wales\".\n\nElisabeth Jones has been nominated as counsel general, or chief legal adviser, on an interim basis, but that position requires the approval of Members of the Senedd.\n\nMs Jones was previously the Senedd's chief legal adviser.\n\nA full reshuffle is expected in the autumn.\n\nMr Drakeford returns to the health job at a time when the Welsh NHS is in deep trouble.\n\nFigures released last month showed the waiting list for hospital treatment reached a record high, with about a fifth of the Welsh population waiting to be seen.\n\nMr Irranca-Davies told BBC Wales the appointment gave the government \"real continuity and stability\" with \"somebody who has not only vast experience in that role but also in his role as first minister as well\".\n\nAs the man who had led Wales through the coronavirus pandemic he was a \"really sure pair of hands on that brief\" for the rest of the summer, said Mr Irranca-Davies, while \"we go out and actually engage with people across Wales\".\n\n\"I think there is a desire from the public to see stable, grown-up government that is acting on their behalf and doing the right thing, and I think Mark brings that, as well as the other cabinet appointments that have been confirmed today.\"\n\nMs Morgan is seeking to restore order and unity to the Welsh government and Labour Senedd group, after months of infighting.\n\nShe replaced Vaughan Gething as first minister, after he resigned last month when four members of his cabinet quit their jobs and Ms Morgan was elected unopposed as Welsh Labour leader.\n\nMr Gething, Wales' first black first minister, became mired in controversy after accepting donations from a man twice convicted of environmental offences for his election campaign and sacking one of his cabinet ministers over leaked messages.\n\nOne of the ministers who quit Mr Gething's cabinet in July was his former leadership challenger Jeremy Miles, and responsibility for the Welsh language moved from Mr Miles to Ms Morgan.\n\nShe continues to be minister for the language as first minister."
