        "text": "With its stunning coastal scenery of seas, sand dunes, and expansive beaches, Camber Sands provides the ideal backdrop for all kinds of cinematic productions, from documentaries to beloved classics.\n\nThis peaceful stretch of shoreline has hosted its fair share of famous films over the years. Some of the most notable movies to have filmed scenes at Camber Sands include:\n\nThe Theory of Everything (2014)\n\nThe acclaimed biographical drama detailing the life of famed physicist Stephen Hawking incorporated filming sites across the United Kingdom, such as the University of Cambridge and numerous London locales. One particularly charming scene shows Hawking (portrayed by Oscar-winning actor Eddie Redmayne) enjoying a day at the seaside with his family. The beach used for this scene was the picturesque Camber Sands.\n\nCriminal (2016)\n\nThe crime drama Criminal, starring big names like Kevin Costner, Gal Gadot, Gary Oldman and Ryan Reynolds, filmed its emotional final scene (spoiler warning) on the sunny coastline of Camber Sands. This poignant montage features breathtaking aerial views of the beach’s striking sandy shores. Though the movie itself received mixed reviews, the beautiful Camber Sands sequences stand out as a highlight. The scenic seaside setting provides a memorable backdrop despite the film’s uneven reception.\n\nKiss Kiss Bang Bang (2001)\n\nThe British comedy thriller starring Stellan Skarsgård as former hitman Felix, tasked with looking after a rich man’s reclusive grown son (Chris Penn). The film includes a scene filmed on location at Camber Sands.\n\nThe Monuments Men (2014)\n\nCamber Sands has stood in for the beaches of France in several World War II films due to its visual similarities to the historically important shorelines of Normandy and Dunkirk.\n\nOne such movie is The Monuments Men, featuring an all-star cast of John Goodman, George Clooney, Matt Damon and Bill Murray. They play a group tasked with locating and safeguarding culturally significant art and artifacts before the Nazis can steal or ruin them. In one scene, the Monuments Men arrive on the beach in “France,” which was actually filmed on location at Camber Sands. The sweeping sandy vistas allow the beach to convincingly portray the French coast during World War II events.\n\nAfter Life (2019)\n\nIn the Netflix series, a newspaper writer grieving his wife’s passing adopts a brusque facade as a way to distance himself from those attempting to provide support. Struggling with the loss, he spends time alone on the beach, with all the seaside scenes shot on location at Camber Sands. Viewers familiar with the area’s iconic sandy dunes will recognise the landscape from the trailer. The expansive beaches of Camber Sands offer a poignant and dramatic coastal setting for the lead character as he grapples with devastating grief.\n\nDunkirk (1958)\n\nThe film Dunkirk used Camber Sands as a stand-in for the beaches of Dunkirk, France, though the more recent 2017 movie of the same name filmed on location at the real Dunkirk. The earlier Dunkirk production depicts Operation Dynamo, also known as the Dunkirk evacuation, which took place on the coast of northern France during World War II. Despite the 2017 version opting for authentic filming sites, Camber Sands convincingly portrayed the Dunkirk beaches for the classic film. Its sweeping seaside vistas capture the scenic conditions of the real Operation Dynamo location.\n\nThe Loneliness of The Long Distance Runner (1962)\n\nThough nearly 60 years have passed since its release, the beaches of Camber Sands appear unchanged and make the perfect setting for this classic coming-of-age drama. Adapted from a short story of the same title, the film follows a talented young runner in rural England. It features a joyful scene with the main character frolicking on the sandy shores of Camber Sands. Despite being made decades ago, the timeless beauty and expansive landscapes of Camber Sands provide an evocative backdrop for this tale of youth and self-discovery.\n\nWant to see what the fuss is about?"
