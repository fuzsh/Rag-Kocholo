        "text": "Professor Stephen Hawking has become an unlikely contender for a James Bond villain after saying that he would love to play a “baddie”.\n\nThe theoretical physicist, 72, reckons he has the right voice for the role and has previously featured on The Simpsons, Star Trek and Monty Python's recent live shows.\n\nDiagnosed with motor neurone disease aged 21, the nearly completely paralysed Hawking now ‘speaks’ via a computer that he operates by twitching his cheek.\n\n“My ideal role would be a baddie in a James Bond film,” he said in an interview with Wired magazine. “I think the wheelchair and the computer voice would fit the part.”\n\nThe A Brief History of Time author is currently being played by Eddie Redmayne in Oscar-tipped movie The Theory of Everything.\n\nHawking has said he was so impressed with Redmayne’s performance that he cried and even mistook the actor for himself in some scenes.\n\n“I thought Eddie portrayed me very well,” he said. “At times I thought he was me. I think Eddie’s commitment will have a bit emotional impact.”\n\nRedmayne admitted being daunted by the prospect of playing Hawking but describing preparing for the role as “riveting”.\n\nFelicity Jones stars as Hawking’s ex-wife Jane Wilde in the film, due for UK release on 1 January."
