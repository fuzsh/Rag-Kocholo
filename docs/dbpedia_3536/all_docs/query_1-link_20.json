        "text": "Nathanial Eker (Creative Writing and Film Studies, Liverpool Screen School)\n\nThe second Dis/Ability on Screen film seminar, for which I was responsible, focused on the question: ‘Should non-disabled actors play disabled characters?’, in relation to The Theory of Everything (2015, James Marsh).\n\n‘The social model of disability is first and foremost, a focus on the environmental and social barriers which exclude people with perceived impairments from mainstream society’ (Barnes et al, 1999, p.78). Disabled people are marginalised constantly by society, and the film and television industries show no exception. The discussion around non-disabled actors portraying disabled characters on screen as an issue of misrepresentation and questionable ethicality has brewed within the disabled acting community for some time, though publicly it has risen as a topic for debate in the past five years. In the UK, The Guardian has notably written multiple articles on the issue, including one by Frances Ryan (2015) donning the term ‘cripping up.’ Ryan compares able-bodied actors who take on disabled roles to those who undertake the universally panned practice of ‘blacking up’ to physically accommodate an imaginary race of African descent, often as a caricature: ‘While blacking up is now rightly greeted with outrage, ‘cripping up’ is still greeted with awards.’ (Ryan, 2015). Ryan’s article was written in direct response to the casting of Eddie Redmayne as Professor Stephen Hawking, and thus served as a key facet of the film screening for which I was responsible. Very similarly to Ryan, Barnes (1992) already noted when discussing My Left Foot (1989, Jim Sheridan) that the title character in this film too was played by non-disabled actor. ‘Unfortunately,’ he wrote, ‘this is common policy in the film world and partly due to the fact that most drama schools and colleges have not recruited disabled students for the acting profession’ (Barnes, 1992, p.8-9). This shows a disconnect between the way the film industry treats the disabled acting community, and a breakdown of a relationship between them, due to studios taking parts that could be suitable for disabled people away from them, marginalising them in the process. More recently, Ellis noted in agreement with Barnes (1992) that a key critique of the film and television industries comes from a lack of appropriate representation: ‘The media – and television in particular – is consistently criticised for its representation of disability. Critiques concentrate on underrepresentation, negative portrayals and inaccurate portrayals of normalisation’ (Ellis, 2015, p.82).\n\nIn light of these comments, following the screening of the film, the first and most important question that the audience was asked was: ‘is this a role that could have been performed (at least in part) by a disabled actor?’ The response to this question at first was uniformly negative. Most participants rightly pointed to the narrative of the film being driven by the progression of Hawking’s amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Motor Neuron disease), thus the role fundamentally required an able-bodied actor to show the degeneration of Hawking’s physical state over decades. ALS ‘refers to a group of progressive diseases that cause dysfunction in the nerves that cause muscle movement’ (McIntosh, 2017) and as such often eventually causes the sufferer to lose the ability to walk, move their limbs, and limits their speech. It was suggested by one audience member that to offer a disabled actor a ‘half role’ where they only played the character in the ‘disabled years’ would be disrespectful and would devalue the agency of the actor. Notably, however, ‘we do not know how disabled people themselves feel about their marginalisation from some of the most powerful and influential mass media forms such as television’ (Ross, 1997, p.1).\n\nThe audience was also asked the question of whether they viewed ‘cripping up’ as an issue of exclusion and misrepresentation. This proved to be a more divided issue. One audience member insisted that it is an actor’s job to take on another identity, regardless of their gender, impairment, or sexuality. He concluded that if we disallow actors from taking on disabled character roles, particularly when representing invisible disabilities such as deafness, we will fundamentally shift what it means to be an actor. However, it is clear that the relationship with the industry is equally tumultuous for other marginalised groups such as the trans community, who lose trans roles to cisgender actors. Though there are exceptions, such as Pose which ‘features the largest cast of transgender actors in television history’ (Pollard, 2019), these works are the exception to the rule. It is important to note the similarities to the disconnected relationship of the disabled acting community that are often coequal in scope of rejection. Much of the audience found ‘cripping up’ to be an issue that takes work away from an already marginalised group, citing popular films that chose to cast able bodied actors in disabled roles. Indeed, Barnes describes My Left Foot as ‘an excellent opportunity for a disabled actor’ in the same way that Ryan describes the role of Hawking.\n\nMy research into activism by the disabled community led me to discover Adam Pearson, a UK based actor who has neurofibromatosis. He has tumours across 90% of his face. Pearson spoke out against ‘cripping up’ saying that it was a culture of exclusion that ‘is a systematic problem’ (Ryan, 2018). Adam was not offered an audition for the BBC’s upcoming television adaptation of The Elephant Man, with the role going to able-bodied actor Charlie Heaton, despite Pearson’s appropriate mainstream acting credentials, appearing in Under the Skin (2013, Johnathan Glazer) opposite Scarlett Johansson. As Goodley and Van Hove (2005, p.22) note, ‘disabled people are rarely afforded a leading role in such cultural pastimes [as film] … [and] disabling discourses prevail’. The audience members’ perceptions of the disabled community being marginalised were fuelled by Pearson’s public personal rejection, pointing to the fact that members of the disabled community who have ALS themselves, could have given a more authentic performance as Hawking, concurrently exploring a subtext of how the condition affects real people. This opinion was retorted by another audience member, who noted that ALS has many different expressions, so that no one person with the condition will be identical to another. To properly portray Hawking’s life, one would need an able-bodied actor to mimic his specific condition precisely.\n\nThe vocal majority who agreed that ‘actors should be allowed to act’ suggested that limiting the repertoire of characters that an actor is allowed to portray damages the industry. One person pointed to a recent controversy surrounding the casting of the straight actor and comedian Jack Whitehall as ‘the first openly gay character in a Disney film’ (Staples, 2018). The petitioners suggested that only a homosexual man would truly be able to portray the character accurately. Thus, the audience member suggested that by theoretically disallowing Eddie Redmayne the role of Stephen Hawking, we would head down a slippery slope, that prevents actors from being allowed to act. It was further noted that the industry is founded on the public perception and recognition of famous faces. Recognisable, celebrity actors are what draw crowds and often play a part in the film’s commercial and critical success. The Theory of Everything made five times its initial budget at the box office, in addition to Redmayne winning the film’s sole academy award, for best actor.\n\nThis led to the discussion that actors take on disabled roles as ‘Oscar bait.’ Frances Ryan opens her article discussing the issue; ‘If you do a film about the holocaust, you’re guaranteed an Oscar; or so goes the famous Kate Winslet joke in Extras. The same can be said for an actor doing a film about disability. Unless you’re a disabled actor, that is. Then you’re lucky to even get the part’ (Ryan, 2015; see also Kermode, 2019). It was agreed that there is a clear cause and effect with able-bodied actors who take disabled character parts and subsequent academy recognition. John Hurt in The Elephant Man (1980, David Lynch), Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot (1989, Jim Sheridan), and more recently Sally Hawkins in The Shape of Water (2017, Guillermo del Toro) are all examples. The correlation became clear; sentimental performances about disability by able-bodied actors win Oscars (Kermode, 2019). Indeed, already in 1992 Barnes noted that ‘of fourteen actors in the category of best actors / actresses won by films dealing with disability, only one winner, Marlee Martin in ‘Children of a Lesser God’ – a film about a deaf woman’s relationship with a non-disabled teacher in a school for deaf people -had experience of the impairment [sic]portrayed’ (Barnes, 1992, p.9). It is also relevant to add that many critics at the time considered Martin’s win a ‘pity vote,’ something that Kirstie Mitchell touched on. Mitchell notes that ‘this contradicts the need for authentic representation, therefore overlooking acting ability based on actors being Deaf or having a disability’ (Mitchell, 2018, p.26).\n\nThe discussion led most participants to agree that a middle ground needs to be reached. This idea is embodied by disabled theatre actor Mat Fraser, who played ‘crippled Richard III.’ He said [of the theatre industry, though it remains relevant to film] ‘ideally, anybody should be able to play anybody, but only when there is a truly level playing field of opportunity’ (Pepper, 2019). What was clear from my research and the film seminar, is that it is far from a level playing field. The BBC pledged in 2014 that they would quadruple the number of disabled actors on screen by 2017 (Singh, 2014). While the likes of disabled actor Liz Carr in Silent Witness have emerged during this time, no official statistics have been released. In light of this, the pledge cannot be taken as anything more than hyperbolised self-promotion, for goodwill PR with the disabled community. Ultimately, the audience concurred that it is the industry that needs to change, not the actors. If the industry becomes more accommodating to marginalised communities, and gives them a fair opportunity to audition, the friction felt towards the way films and television programmes are currently cast, could be significantly eased.\n\nTo conclude, my research allowed me to ascertain that there is a disability in the relationship between the film industry and the disabled community that they misrepresent and further marginalise, by casting non-disabled actors. This is due to an uneven playing field, facilitated by film studios that almost always prefer to cast an actor giving an imitation of disability, rather an actor with that disability. While some studios profess to attempt an increased diversity by casting more disabled actors (Singh, 2014), there is little proof that this has been actioned, and it can feel like a tick-box exercise. Throughout the seminar and my research, portrayals of people of marginalised sexuality, ethnicity, and gender all appear to suffer from this same disconnect. The relationship between these acting communities and the mainstream studio system is equally disengaged, leading to further marginalisation by a system that nearly always favours a straight white impersonation, as opposed to casting someone who has the same attribute as the character. Though there are arguments to be made in favour of casting non-disabled actors (chiefly in promotion and PR and to accurately present the physical deterioration of a person with a degenerative condition), it is clear that the relationship between the industry and the disabled acting community is fractured, and that the playing field must become more even, in order to establish true equality.\n\nReferences\n\nBarnes, C.
