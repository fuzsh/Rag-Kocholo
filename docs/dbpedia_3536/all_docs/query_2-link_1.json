        "text": "Overview of the events of 2013 in film\n\nList of years in film\n\n+...\n\n2013 in film is an overview of events, including award ceremonies, festivals, a list of country- and genre-specific lists of films, notable deaths, and film debuts. Three popular films (Top Gun, Jurassic Park, and The Wizard of Oz) were re-released in 3D and IMAX.\n\nEvaluation of the year\n\n[edit]\n\nRichard Brody of The New Yorker said, \"The year 2013 has been an amazing one for movies, though maybe every year is an amazing year for movies if one is ready to be amazed by movies. It's also a particularly apt year to make a list of the best films. Making a list is not merely a numerical act but also a polemical one, and the best of this year's films are polemical in their assertion of the singularity of cinema, as well as of the art form's opposition to the disposable images of television. The 2013 crop comprises an unplanned, if not accidental, collective declaration of the essence of the cinema, an art of images and sounds that, at their best, don't exist to tell a story or to tantalize the audience (though they may well do so) but, rather, to reflect a crisis in the life of the filmmaker and the state of the artist's mind or, even, soul.\" He also stated, \"The best movies this year are films of combative cinema, audacious inventions in vision. The specificity and originality of their moment-to-moment creation of images offers new ways for viewers to confront the notion of what \"narrative\" might be. Their revitalization of storytelling as experience restores to the cinema its primordial mode of redefining consciousness. It's significant that some of the filmmakers in the forefront of that charge are from the generation of the elders, innovators of the seventies. In the age of radical cinema sparked by digital technology, the rise of independent producers, and the ready ubiquity of the history of cinema (thanks to DVDs and streaming video), these older directors have experienced a glorious second youth. That artistic rejuvenation is also due to the stimulating ambiance of actual youth—a young generation of freethinking cinephiles, critics, and filmmakers who, thanks to the Internet, make their appreciation of these sublime extremes widely and quickly known, even when the mainstream of viewers and reviewers miss out.\"[1]\n\nHighest-grossing films\n\n[edit]\n\nThe top 10 films released in 2013 by worldwide gross are as follows:\n\nHighest-grossing films of 2013[2] Rank Title Distributor Worldwide gross[a] 1 Frozen Disney $1,280,802,282 2 Iron Man 3 $1,214,811,252 3 Despicable Me 2 Universal $970,766,005 4 The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug Warner Bros. $958,366,855 5 The Hunger Games: Catching Fire Lionsgate $865,011,746 6 Fast & Furious 6 Universal $788,679,850 7 Monsters University Disney $743,559,607 8 Gravity Warner Bros. $723,192,705 9 Man of Steel $670,145,518 10 Thor: The Dark World Disney $644,783,140\n\nBox office records\n\n[edit]\n\nFrozen and Iron Man 3 both grossed over $1.2 billion, making them among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time.\n\nFrozen became the second animated film after Toy Story 3 (2010) to gross $1 billion, and became the highest-grossing animated film at release.\n\nIron Man 3 became the second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to gross over $1 billion, after The Avengers.\n\nDespicable Me 2 became the highest-grossing non-Disney animated film worldwide, surpassing the 9-year record of Shrek 2 (2004).
