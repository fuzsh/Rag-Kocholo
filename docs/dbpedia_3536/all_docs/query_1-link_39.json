        "text": "The way that people are portrayed in popular media can have a real impact on not only how they are viewed by society, but also how people view themselves. Films are one way that many people with disabilities will start to see how society views them, and also experience how other disabled people see the world.\n\nAs experts in caring for individuals with disability and mobility issues with walk in baths and walk in showers – we understand how challenging life can become with these barriers in place.\n\nSo, we’ve brought together 10 of the best movies about disabilities (in no particular order), from Alzheimer’s to ALS, to show the diversity of disabilities that are represented in film.\n\n1. The Theory of Everything\n\nThe first film on our list is the biographical dramatization of the life of the well-known theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking. Based on the novel Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen, by his ex-wife Jane Hawking, this film was critically acclaimed across the globe and deals with Jane’s relationship with Stephen, from its inception, through his diagnosis with ALS, right up until their divorce. This bittersweet love story is both moving and inspirational, absolutely a must see. 7.3/10\n\nGet a FREE Brochure\n\nSimply complete our form to see a full range of bathing solutions & their key features. It takes no time at all!\n\n3. Inside I’m Dancing (Rory O’Shea Was Here)\n\nAlso released under the title Rory O’Shea Was Here, this film stars a young James McAvoy, long before he became Professor Xavier. Inside I’m Dancing is the story of two young men with disabilities who live in a residential home for the disabled. The two men reject the ‘protective’ care that they are placed under, and rebel against society’s attitudes towards them – especially pity – and long for independence. 5.8/10\n\n4. Still Alice\n\nStill Alice stars Julienne Moore as the titular Alice, a linguistic professor who gets diagnosed with Alzheimer’s shortly after her 50th birthday. The film follows Alice as her illness progresses, and was widely praised by critics. Julienne Moore won an Oscar, among other awards, for her gripping performance as Alice. Still Alice is one of the few films that treats Alzheimer’s with a delicate sensitivity, but also bravery. Astonishingly delicate and sad, a definite must watch. 7.4/10\n\n5. I Am Sam\n\nAnother masterful movie featuring a character with special needs, Sean Penn was nominated for an Oscar for his role as the titular Sam in this 2001 drama. Penn portrays a father with developmental disabilities and Dakota Fanning appears as his young daughter who he must care for. They encounter many challenges, including Sam’s daughter becoming more intellectually advanced than her father, whether Sam is declared a fit parent, and whether or not she can continue to live with him. An emotionally uplifting story, if a little obvious. 4.6/10\n\n8. My Left Foot\n\nThe highest rated film on our list, My Left Foot stars Daniel Day-Lewis in one of the best performances of his life – so much so that he won the Oscar for his work. The true story of Irish cerebral palsy victim Christy Brown, who grew up to be a well-known painter, author and fundraiser. My Left Foot is notable for avoiding the Hollywood stereotype of a disabled person, as Brown was not a loveable character, and a notorious alcoholic. My Left Foot does not sugarcoat disability, and presents it in a real and resonating way. 8.1/10\n\n10. Forrest Gump\n\nThe next film on our list is an oldie but a goody. Certainly, one of the most iconic movies with a disabled main character. Forrest Gump follows the life of the titular character over several decades. While Forrest’s disability is never explicitly stated, it is assumed that he has a form of autism – long before the disease was really classified the way it is today. Tom Hanks shines in this role, and watching Forrest Gump is sure to bring a smile to anyone’s face. 7.2/10\n\n11. The Peanut Butter Falcon\n\nThis heart-warming movie follows Zak, a boy with Down’s Syndrome runs away from the nursing homes he lives at to pursue his dream of becoming a wrestler. On the road he encounters a wayward fisherman played by Shia LaBeouf, who takes him under his wing to help him on his quest. As the pair become friends, the movie highlights the importance of friendships and meaningful connections. Most importantly this movie is the debut of actor Zack Gottsagen, “a disarming performer who creates a sweet and funny character” as Zak. Glenn Kenny wrote in his review in The New York Times. 7.6/10\n\n12. The Father\n\nBased on and co-written by the author of the award-winning play Le Père, this moving film sheds light on the reality of taking care of a loved one with dementia. Anthony, played by Anthony Hopkins, is an 80-year-old man desperately clinging to his independence as his mental state regresses. His daughter, played by Olivia Colman, struggles keeping up with her own life as well as taking care of his father, we get a glimpse into both sides of the story. 8.4/10\n\nDid you watch any of these films?
