        "text": "The DCEU is over and the DCU - helmed by James Gunn and Peter Safran - is about to begin in 2025.\n\nUntil then, we're guiding you through how to watch the DCEU movies in order, from Man of Steel right through to The Flash, Blue Beetle, and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.\n\nWe'll also offer up a DCEU chronological watch order for those who want to spice up their DC marathons. There's also a look at how non-canon DC films and Elseworlds films fit in, such as Zack Snyder's Justice League, Joker, and The Batman. For the MCU side of things, we also have a guide on how to watch the Marvel movies in order.\n\nHow to watch DC movies in order – release order\n\nMan of Steel (2013)\n\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)\n\nSuicide Squad (2016)\n\nWonder Woman (2017)\n\nJustice League (2017)\n\nAquaman (2018)\n\nShazam! (2019)\n\nJoker (2019) [non-DCEU]\n\nBirds of Prey (2020)\n\nWonder Woman 1984 (2020)\n\nZack Snyder's Justice League (2021) [non-canon]\n\nThe Suicide Squad (2021)\n\nThe Batman (2022) [non-DCEU]\n\nDC League of Super-Pets (2022) [non-DCEU]\n\nBlack Adam (2022)\n\nShazam! Fury of the Gods (2023)\n\nThe Flash (2023)\n\nBlue Beetle (2023)\n\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023)\n\nBest for: Newcomers to DC\n\nWhile the likes of Christopher Nolan’s Bat-trilogy and Constantine don’t count as part of a cinematic universe and should be treated as standalone entities, almost everything from Man of Steel onwards is in the same DC Extended Universe (DCEU). However, there are some oddities when attempting to watch the DC movies in order.\n\nFor simplicity’s sake, we’re sticking to everything released under the DC banner, though Joker and The Batman are completely standalone stories in their own universe away from the DCEU (more on that below).\n\nAs for the Snyder Cut, we recommend watching the 2017 theatrical Justice League release for 'canon' purposes, but Zack Snyder's 2021 version for a different and more definitive take on some of your favorite characters – plus, it's a superior movie, even if it is four hours long. Best of all, the already-released DC movies mentioned below can, for the most part, be watched right now on Max.\n\nIn terms of current releases, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is the latest DC movie, with a new cinematic universe under the stewardship of James Gunn and Peter Safran (the DCU) set to begin in 2025 with Superman: Legacy. But that's not something we need to worry about right now.\n\nHere’s how to watch DC movies in release order, discounting the movies that haven’t yet been released. We'll get deeper in to the thorny issue of the DCU in just a bit.\n\nHow to watch DC movies in order – chronological order\n\nWonder Woman (main story) (1914-18)\n\nWonder Woman 1984\n\nMan of Steel\n\nThe Flash (alternate timeline scenes)\n\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\n\nWonder Woman (modern-day scenes)\n\nSuicide Squad\n\nJustice League (theatrical)\n\nAquaman\n\nShazam!\n\nBirds of Prey\n\nThe Suicide Squad\n\nBlack Adam\n\nShazam! Fury of the Gods\n\nThe Flash\n\nBlue Beetle\n\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom\n\nBest for: Those who are rewatching the DCEU.\n\nThe chronological order of DC movies begins with Wonder Woman; it's mostly easy and pales in comparison to the monstrous Marvel timeline. Still, some (such as Aquaman, Shazam!, and Birds of Prey) are quite hard to pin down into the correct timeframe. Atlantis doesn’t exactly have underwater calendars in every scene.\n\nEven if the years aren’t nailed down beyond Wonder Woman’s entries, there is an agreed-upon chronological order thanks to some Easter eggs (such as a \"Superman is back!\" poster in Shazam! and Harley Quinn’s Birds of Prey break-up with Joker) that keeps things relatively simple... until The Flash.\n\nYep, the Scarlet Speedster is in danger of blowing up the entire DC watch order. It technically takes place after the events of Justice League but, without going into spoilers, can also be watched concurrently with Man of Steel. But it also exists on a completely separate timeline. Our advice? Leave it until the end, but in the knowledge that some of its scenes come during Superman's solo adventure on a completely different, parallel timeline.\n\nIf you want to get even more granular, you can queue up certain scenes to watch in chronological order – but it could get messy.\n\nSome of Justice League, for example, clearly overlaps with Aquaman. Suicide Squad also features some pre-Man of Steel flashbacks to Bruce Wayne's early crusading in Gotham. But, by and large, it helps to keep things streamlined and to use the list above, with only Wonder Woman’s \"modern day\" scenes being crucial to the chronological order of the DCEU in terms of plot.\n\nHow does James Gunn's DCU affect the DC watch order?\n\nRight now, it doesn't. But that's going to change in 2025. DCU Chapter One is the first step in a new rebooted cinematic universe, which makes everything from Man of Steel to The Flash (largely) redundant in terms of the new grand story it's trying to tell.\n\nWhile that's a bridge we cross when we get to it, the Aquaman sequel is officially the final DCEU movie.\n\nJames Gunn, for his part, has said on Threads that, moving forward, his DCU works will be 'canon.' Nothing in the DCEU, seemingly, will matter as part of this cinematic universe.\n\n\"Nothing is canon until Creature Commandos [in 2024] – a sort of aperitif to the DCU – & then a deeper dive into the universe with Superman: Legacy after that,\" Gunn wrote. \"It’s a very human drive to want to understand everything all the time, but I think its okay to be confused on what’s happening in the DCU since no one has seen anything from the DCU yet.\"\n\nFrom then on, that collection of movies from 2013 to 2023 listed above (not including 'Elseworlds' movies like The Batman that exist outside of that main canon) will be in part of an older cinematic universe that is being left behind. Everything going forward from Superman: Legacy and Creature Commando onwards will be part of the new DCU, though some character and story elements could still transfer over like Blue Beetle. It's... confusing.\n\nTL;DR: the DCU is going to be completely new and not related to the previous DCEU. They may have some similarities, but it's all going to be very different and a fresh cinematic universe from hereon in. You can start fresh here if you're planning a DCU marathon.\n\nFor more on all 10 currently confirmed projects, check out our guide to DCU Chapter One.\n\nHow does the Snyder Cut affect the DC watch order?\n\nFor now, Zack Snyder's Justice League is still not considered canon. For many fans, however, ZSJL is the culmination of a trilogy that started in Man of Steel and continued through Batman v Superman. The director then had plans for Justice League 2, as well as a third movie that would have seen Superman's son become the new Batman.\n\nThose movies will not come to pass, but you can still enjoy Snyder's trilogy: Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Zack Snyder's Justice League.\n\nAre The Batman and Joker connected to the DCEU?\n\nWhen it comes to Robert Pattinson's The Batman and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker, there's no correct watch order (at least, not until the sequels and spin-offs come out). The two movies are also not connected in any way – in fact, The Batman introduces its own version of the Clown Prince of Crime.\n\nBoth The Batman and Joker can be watched at your own leisure and do not need to be part of your DCEU watch.\n\nHowever, if you really want to get every DC movie under your belt, there's no harm watching these amid your release order watch through, but don't expect Phoenix to pop up and fight the Justice League anytime soon. Both movies fall under the Elseworlds banner of the new DCU, meaning they all take place in different universes away from the main action."
