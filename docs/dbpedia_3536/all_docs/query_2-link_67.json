But George Orwell, author of the classicsÂ Animal FarmÂ andÂ 1984, was very clear in his beliefs. While he was progressive and prescient in many ways, he wasnât without his flaws. This week, Sean Illing explores the real George Orwell withÂ Laura Beers, the author ofÂ Orwell's Ghosts: Wisdom and Warnings for the Twenty-First Century.\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@seanilling), host, The Gray Area\n\nGuest: Laura Beers\n\nEnjoyed this episode?

They discuss how Nietzsche's work has been interpreted â and misinterpreted â since his death in 1900, how his radical political views emerge from his body of work, and how we can use Nietzsche's philosophy in order to interpret some key features of our contemporary politics.\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@seanilling), host, The Gray Area\n\nGuest: Matt McManus.\n\nEnjoyed this episode?

One hotspot of this tension lies in India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi employs autocratic language and tactics to maintain power. But a recent election may indicate that voters are losing interest in this style of rule. Guest host Zack Beauchamp talks with scholar Pratap Bhanu Mehta about the past of the Indian liberal tradition and what the current politics of the worldâs largest democracy say about the state of global politics.Â\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@seanilling), host, The Gray Area\n\nGuest: Pratap Bhanu Mehta\n\nEnjoyed this episode?
