        "text": "Hardworking, melodic quintet performs at Nobby's on Jan. 25\n\nHas any musical genre invoked more love-it-or-hate-it venom than emo rock? For every musician like Conor Oberst shocking us with brutally honest and beautifully composed masterpieces, there's a Fall Out Boy assaulting our fashion senses and our eardrums with slick hipster preening. For every band like The Get Up Kids injecting hyperkinetic energy into their scrappy pop-punk, there's a My Chemical Romance piling silly uniforms and tired futuristic concepts atop what's actually decent music.\n\nThrow all those misconceptions out the window, however, when approaching Springfield, Ill., quintet Our Lady. This band of early twenty-somethings proudly wears its emo influences on its sleeve, all while serving up some of the most impassioned and sonically resonant underground punk rock in the nation. It's hard to believe that Tim Williams, Molli Squires, Jess Knight, Jordan Fein and Kyle Ratliff all started playing their respective instruments only a few years ago. But in that time, their music has gone from endearing and shaggily sped up to meditative and melodically precise.\n\nDrift chatted with Williams about the band's acoustic past, hardworking present and promising future.\n\nDrift: Coming from Illinois, you guys must be excited about playing in Florida next week.\n\nTim Williams: We have never toured in Florida, and I can say that the thing we're looking forward to the most is warmer weather and the possibility of seeing the ocean. I will be wearing shorts.\n\nDrift: Nice. How did you guys set up the four Florida dates you'll play next week?\n\nTW: [Illinois native and St. Augustine musician] PJ Famicom helped us set up most of the Florida shows. PJ has been very punk rock for a very long time, and he's made a lot of friends doing it, so that helped.\n\nDrift:Take us back to how Our Lady originally came together.\n\nTW: We've all known each other for quite a while. The band started about three years ago, but we've only been touring for about a year and a half. We all got together originally to play acoustic songs, and things have really matured as we've gotten better at our instruments and continued to write and experiment with new song structures. We love to tour, we love to be around each other, we love to make new friends, and we love to play shows, so it's all very exciting for us.\n\nDrift: How did you guys shift from acoustic to what can best be described as loud, uptempo emo rock?\n\nTW: When we first formed Our Lady, we were definitely going in a different acoustic, folkie type direction. And now it's definitely evolved into a mature emo-punk sound. We all live in a big house together, and we all continue to play in each other's bands, too, so that helps.\n\nDrift: For those people not acutely aware of the emo scene, who would you compare yourselves to? What bands do you listen to for inspiration?\n\nTW: The two genres we listen to the most are post-rock - Sigur Rós and Russian Circles - and the whole '90s emo vibe like Sunny Day Real Estate and Knapsack. But everyone has their own little thing; Kyle comes from a more hardcore background, Jordan comes from an indie background, and Jess and Molli are into pretty much everything. We have very wide musical tastes.\n\nDrift: Molli Squires plays cello, which is pretty unusual for a punk band. How hard was it to work that instrument into Our Lady's technically sound and melodically strong aesthetic?\n\nTW: Actually kind of difficult. We all learned our instruments as we started the band - including Molli - and we've been practicing and dedicating ourselves to learning these songs simply for ourselves more than anything. Everyone has evolved into great musicians, and I'm very proud looking back at how far we've all come. It gives us all lots of confidence when someone compliments our playing without knowing that a lot of us haven't been doing it for very long.\n\nDrift: The excellent recording quality of all your songs certainly helps. Have you done that in a studio or on your own?\n\nTW: No, we've gone through a very wonderful friend of ours, Brandon Carnes, who's actually in relations with our bass player Jess. Brandon's a talented musician who has a lot of recording equipment and is going in that direction: recording bands, helping them get their names out, and helping out the community here in Springfield. He's progressed with the band and has helped us in ways that we can't even begin to thank him for.\n\nDrift: How much touring has Our Lady done?\n\nTW: We did a little two-week acoustic tour through the Midwest and East Coast when we first started out that put us in the mindset of what we needed to do. Then we went on a month-long tour through Texas ad Oklahoma, up the West Coast to Portland, and then through Montana. We've also done two or three other two- and three-week tours. But the most fun thing we've done is the Plan-It-X Fest in Bloomington, Ind.\n\nDrift: Outside of band, do you guys have day jobs?Or is Our Lady your full-time gig?\n\nTW: The process of making it a full-time gig is very difficult, but we're all trying to arrange our lives to make that a possibility in the very near future. Molli and Jess have day jobs that are very secure and OK with them leaving. Kyle, our drummer, works at a hippie sub shop that's also cool with him leaving. And then Jordan and I have been working on getting everything set for this tour and then writing a full- length so that as soon as we come home we can run into the studio and get some of this new stuff out there as quickly as possible.\n\nDrift: It seems like Springfield has a really strong, grounded DIY music scene. Has that always been the case?\n\nTW: We grow happier and happier every day to be a part of this scene. But when we first popped, it was a big down point when things were recycling themselves, the younger kids hadn't moved yet, and there wasn't much besides straight-edge hardcore and death metal happening at our local venue, The Black Sheep Cafe. But there's been a whole community effort getting Springfield back up on its feet, and now we do have an amazing DIY culture with really close-knit, awesome people who put the most incredible amount of work into doing things for each other. We're starting to do shows here at houses and venues, and I hope a lot more bands come through here as often as humanly possible and see how welcoming we are.\n\nDrift: Our Lady has really embraced social media, updating its Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr pages regularly. Is that necessary in this day and age?\n\nTW: Actually, that was something that someone had to tell us. We originally weren't very adamant about our Internet presence, but as touring became more and more what we wanted to do with our lives, we realized that having a reoccurring connection with people you've played for before is really important. The guy from Angst In The Industry Records, who put out our 2011 album Scales, totally kicked us into gear by noticing that we didn't put any effort into our online presence. He was on a strictly DIY level, so we took hearing that from him to heart. We try to make it known to everybody that we're out there getting things done.\n\nDrift: So will 2013 be a big year for Our Lady?\n\nTW: That's what we're hoping. The harder we work, hopefully the more people will want to see us and listen to our music. The band makes us happy, so we're going to hit it hard and try to make it the main focal point of our lives. That's the most important thing for us.\n\n***\n\nOur Lady performs on Friday, Jan. 25 at Nobby's, 10 Anastasia Blvd. The show starts at 9 p.m., with local bands Thunderhoof and Julianne, along with Arkansas folk artist Real Live Tigers, opening. Tickets are $4, and more information can be found by calling 547-2188."
