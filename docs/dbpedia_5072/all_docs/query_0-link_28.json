        "text": "Listening to punk music has been a part of my life for numerous years. It's a part of my life that won't soon leave, even after I finish this blog. The end of this blog is definitely not the end of punk music. Punk has been around for many decades, and will be around for many future decades.\n\nI still plan on being an enthusiast of music within many genres after submitting this final post. The death of this blog is not the death of my interest in music. Punk is never going to die.\n\nGrowing up is giving up.\n\nStay punk.\n\nAndrew Jackson Jihad is a two-piece folk punk band from Phoenix, Arizona. Knife Man is their fourth full-length album, and it is unlike any of theirs that preceded it. Their previous albums contain mostly an assortment of acoustic guitar and upright bass, but many of the songs on Knife Man feature a full band.\n\nA wide variety of folky punk is offered in this album. Some songs you would expect to find on one of their previous albums. One song is akin to tear-in-your-beer country songs. Every song does a fantastic job of telling a story, and it's easy to find yourself engulfed in this album.\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10\n\nJoyce manor is a pop-punk band from Torrance, California, and the poppy punk that they play is unlike any other band of its kind. Unlike other pop-punk bands that feature pretty production and clean vocals, Joyce Manor brings a more raw feeling into their recordings.\n\nOf All Things I Will Soon Grow Tired is the band's second full length album, and it lives up to the precedent set by their first self titled full length. The songs are short, but full of energy. Every song is as catchy as the last, and the instruments are both innovative and clever. The band offers a range of emotions with this album; the lyrics can be funny and heartbreaking.\n\nJoyce Manor has used complete innovation to create this album. Even the most hardcore of punks find themselves tapping their feet to the melodies that Joyce Manor offers. Most of the nine tracks within this album are within the one to two minute mark, making this album an extremely easy, short listen. Definitely recommended.\n\nFavorite Tracks: These Kinds of Ice Skates, Comfortable Clothes, See How Tame I Can Be, Bride of Usher\n\nVerdict: 8/10\n\nDads is a two piece emo/math rock outfit from New Jersey that has done much for \"emo revival\". They're all around cool dudes.\n\nTheir first album, Brush Your Teeth ;), is followed up by Brush Your Teeth, Again ;), which is the same album with four more songs added to the end of it. This album is full of noodly riffs and straining vocals. All eight songs aren't terribly long either, so it's pretty easy to give this album a quick listen.\n\nYou can stream the album for free on Bandcamp, and they've also provided a mediafire link there as well so you can download the album for free.\n\nhttp://dadsnj.bandcamp.com/album/brush-your-teeth-again\n\nFavorite Tracks: Dan's Christopher Walken Impersonation, The Deer in the Basement, New Pantera\n\nFinal Verdict: 7.5/10\n\nWilliam Bonney was an emo/screamo band from South Bend, Indiana that had only released a split with the band Droughts, a demo, and the EP Good Vibes. They played their last show in July of 2013.\n\nGood Vibes is what most consider to be William Bonney's magnum opus, and rightfully so. Diving into this piece is much like reading somebody's diary that they have left out on their nightstand. The lyrics are emotional, and the subject matter is depressing. Just look at the album art. Sad.\n\nDuring my first listen of this EP I was mostly put off by the vocals. This is screamo, but not the screamo that comes to most people's mind when thinking of the genre. After a few listens, the vocals became very easy for me to enjoy. It also helps to look up the lyrics so you actually know what's being said.\n\nDespite not enjoying the vocals during my first listen, I was in love with the music being played from the beginning. The band has been labeled as \"twinkle daddies\" by some, which I believe is a good description. Some of the guitars being played by William Bonney are what many describe as \"twinkly\" or \"noodly\". It's hard to comprehend what these terms mean without listening to the music, and I wouldn't recommend William Bonney as the first twinkly band to listen to. If you want to comprehend what \"twinkle\" sounds like in music, give this song by the band Dads a listen:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE5rIpDSz0g\n\nYou can stream the entire album for free and buy it for $5 on Bandcamp:\n\nhttp://sigd.bandcamp.com/album/good-vibes\n\nFAVORITE TRACKS: All of them.\n\nFinal verdict: 8/10\n\nStrange Homes is the latest, and probably the last, effort put out by acoustic folk punk band Mallory. Featuring a vast array of instrumentals, from an accordion to a banjo, Mallory manages to put out some of the best folk punk I have ever heard.\n\nApart from the distinct sound of the instruments, this album, just like Mallory's last effort, Lights in the Quarry, features a distinct lo-fi sound that isn't present in other folk punk releases, but I believe that the sound fits perfectly with the music being played.\n\nYou can stream and download their entire album for free on their bandcamp: http://malloryfolk.bandcamp.com/\n\nFAVORITE TRACKS: The House You Were Raised In, Dissident, These Bones are on Loan, The Tide\n\nLEAST FAVORITE TRACKS: Green River Sometimes\n\nVerdict: 9/10"
