        "text": "49.) My Elise (Summer Vacation split)\n\nSorry Matt, but this track just doesn’t stand up against the rest. The track that wraps up their split with Summer Vacation is the only track on which bassist/backing vocalist Matt Ebert handles all lead vocal duties. The track is marred by forgettable lyrics and guitar work, but it’s not entirely unenjoyable.\n\n48.) Dry Heat (Ew Gross)\n\nIt may be unfair to throw earlier Joyce Manor tracks in here. Ew Gross was an EP that they eventually scrapped due to dissatisfaction, but the tracks later resurfaced. Included on the EP are early versions of “Chumped” (called “Chumped on a Bus”), “DFHP?” (with its full title, “Do Fish Have Periods?”), and “Derailed,” as well as the final recording of “Stir Crazy” before it was reworked into “Ashtray Petting Zoo.” The remaining tracks, including “Dry Heat,” show a band beginning to carve out their sound; they don’t quite feel like Joyce Manor tracks.\n\n47.) Shortout Socket (Ew Gross)\n\nThis song just feels awfully forgettable. In total contrast to a large majority of their later discography, this song feels totally lifeless. From the staccato chords in the bridge to the bland chanting of “don’t they know?” at the end of the song, this song doesn’t quite reach the necessary energy.\n\n46.) Fuck Koalacaust (Demo)\n\nThe first song they ever wrote. This song just doesn’t really do anything for me. Like “Shortout Socket,” it’s just kinda forgettable. Weirdly enough, they’ve been playing it live recently. Does Joyce Manor actually have beef with Koalacaust?\n\n45.) I Know Why (Ew Gross)\n\nPerhaps some of these Ew Gross songs would benefit from re-recordings. This song is a particularly good example. I liked some of the lyrics in this song (“I don’t mind you rock ‘n’ rollin’ with your fucking junkie friends”), and crisper recordings would put the edge on Barry’s voice that this song so desperately needed.\n\nKeep reading\n\nThose who have been around since the beginning/read the “About” section may remember that this blog started as a documentation of my New Years Resolution to listen to a new release (be it an album, an EP, a mixtape, etc.) every day for the rest of the year. I think it has really helped me develop my writing skills as they relate to music reviews, and I definitely drew myself out of my comfort zone a handful of times. I’ve been dormant for a while, and that is mostly due to me growing overwhelmed as last semester drew to a close. I think at it’s fullest, my list of reviews-to-finish was around 40-something. I lost a lot of motivation to write about releases that didn’t do a whole lot for me. I decided to purge my Drafts of all releases I didn’t give too much of a fuck about and finish those that I actually wanted to write about.\n\nNow, I’m all caught up and hoping to begin a new phase of this blog. In the future, I’d like to add lists, interviews, articles, and more. I guess I’m trying to make this more of a music blog than just a place for me to say “yeah, this album is pretty good.” Additionally, I’m going to be slightly modifying my review objectives, like going from a whole-number rating system to a tenths rating system (so like 7.8 instead of 8).\n\nI will usher in the new era with my end-of-the-year lists from 2014 (timely, I know). Thank you to everyone who has reblogged, liked, shared, or just simply read anything I’ve posted here. It means a lot that 106 people found my thoughts compelling enough to allow me to invade their dashboard with bulky posts every once in a while.\n\nHaki - Positive\n\nDate Listened: 11/20/14\n\nGenre: No Wave\n\nThoughts: This album was a trip. Saw someone somewhere post something about them and said something nice that piqued my interest. A lot of the lesser-known bands I’m pointed towards sound okay at best, but this album sounds awesome. Everything sounds clear. Their bassist often vies for attention; a lot of the bass lines stand out among the cacophonous guitar and aggressive drums. Some songs get a bit goofy, but more so in the way intense emotions lead people to come unhinged than in a goofy way. Some parts make you sit and think about how their artistic process led them there; you think “what the hell is this?” before settling in and accepting the grooves. Strange DIY punk in all its glory. 8/10\n\nFavorite Tracks: “Dull,” “Fran Griffin for State Senator,” “Wolfie”\n\n“I am ready to die\n\nAnd I’ve never been happier”\n\nPeace Be Still - 64\n\nDate Listened: 11/21/14\n\nGenre: Emo\n\nThoughts: Right off the bat, this band called to mind images of Braid, Drive Like Jehu, and Rites of Spring, in that order. The first track left me with high hopes, but as the album wore on, what I thought would be a great album turned into an okay album. I felt like there was a lot of untapped potential. A lot of the chord progressions felt very similar, and many of the songs had the same kind of energy to them. The lyrics have that kind of youthful pop punk vibe to them. What they have going on sounds good, but it seems like this album was written too fast. I’d be interested in hearing their later stuff, at least. 6/10\n\nFavorite Tracks: “Hey Jerkwad, You Sprayed Poison On My Veggie Wrap,” “Midland,” Video\"\n\n“Did you sleep tonight?\n\nDid you make it through?\n\nDid you see the hell\n\nThat’s inside of you?\n\nLike an ingrown nail or a swollen tongue\n\nDid you see the light?\n\nThat’s inside of you ”"
