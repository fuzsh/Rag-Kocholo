Panel - It&#39;s Airborne!\n\nIn 2004, Deep Elm Record&#39;s legendary compilation series The Emo Diaries unofficially came to rest as the longest running compilation series in the history of indie rock with its tenth chapter and a total of 135 unreleased songs. Deep Elm cited the bastardization of the term &quot;emo&quot; in today&#39;s pop culture, as well as mainstream&#39;s stranglehold and subsequent commercialization of the genre, which placed the focus squarely on the aesthetic...not the music, the energy or the passion. Essentially, Deep Elm refused to play the game and closed the doors on the genre they helped to document, nurture and expose to the world. But this is now and Deep Elm is Taking Back What&#39;s Ours. The Emo Diaries, Chapter 11 features unreleased songs from Above Them (Pontefract, England), This Drama (Tenerife, Spain), While You Were Gone (Houston, TX), Knockout Kings (Keller, TX), Andy Tanner &amp; His Grand Piano (Colorado Springs, CO), The Crash Engine (Portland, OR), The Decoration (San Francisco, CA), I&#39;m Fashion, You&#39;re Victim (Kettering, England), Young Hearts (Brooklyn, NY), The City Beautiful (Rotterdam, Netherlands), My Awesome Compilation (Leicestershire, England) and Panel (Cardiff, Wales). Songs were chosen from 1,200 open submissions. Absolutely Essential. (DER-465) \r\n\r\nThe Emo Diaries, Chapter 11 &quot;Taking Back What&#39;s Ours&quot; features unreleased and exclusive songs from Above Them (Pontefract, England), This Drama (Tenerife, Spain), While You Were Gone (Houston, TX), Knockout Kings (Keller, TX), Andy Tanner &amp; His Grand Piano (Colorado Springs, CO), The Crash Engine (Portland, OR), The Decoration (San Francisco, CA), I&#39;m Fashion, You&#39;re Victim (Kettering, England), Young Hearts (Brooklyn, NY), The City Beautiful (Rotterdam, Netherlands), My Awesome Compilation (Leicestershire, England) and Panel (Cardiff, Wales). Songs were chosen from 1,200 open submissions. Absolutely Essential. (DER-465) \r\n\r\n&quot;Deep Elm are one of THE legendary underground record labels from the US, right up there with Dischord, No Idea and Jade Tree. The Emo Diaries stopped in 2004, but three years later, Deep Elm are taking back emo with Chapter 11. If you&#39;re familiar with the Deep Elm back catalogue you&#39;ll have a pretty good idea what to expect here: emotionally charged indie rock with melodic guitars and harmonies. Above Them are definitely the standout for me, but there&#39;s a nice variety of stuff on show here. I&#39;m Fashion, You&#39;re Victim sound kinda like Thrice covering Poison the Well, and the female vocals of While You Were Gone make a nice change. If you already know Deep Elm then you probably want a copy of this already. If you don&#39;t, but you yearn for something more than Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance then start with The Emo Diaries.&quot; - Die Shellsuit, Die!\r\n\r\n&quot;With The Emo Diaries No. 11, Deep Elm seek to reclaim the genre which they helped to shape. Assisting them are twelve bands fighting for their own acclaim by giving their very best tracks. Twelve blasts of emotionally charged rock later and the emo pretenders lie broken and bloodied on the floor. Throughout its entirety, Emo 11 barely misses a step, rendering it perhaps one of the greatest compilations of the century. All of the songs pack the requisite punch and Taking Back What&#39;s Ours takes the listener on a journey through the musical genres covered by the emo tag. Knockout Kings show that they are aptly monikered with their searing punk fueled offering. Also up for special commendation is Andy Tanner, kicking up an expansive piano-led ballad which isn&#39;t afraid to nail you to the wall with bursts of heavy rock. If you are a fan of alternative, hardcore, punk, indie or rock then this album should be marked as a mandatory item. In the end, these bands bring a measure of pride back to the emo name. Mission accomplished.&quot; - Strange Glue\r\n\r\n&quot;Above Them kick off The Emo Diaries No.11 in true angst ridden style. For a compilation that sets out to celebrate the best unheard emo and subvert the mainstream juggernaut that has hijacked the genre, there is a healthy sense of real emotion and very little added sweetener. The band&#39;s blood is up in defense of their chosen genre and what better way to showcase the real emo heroes than on &#39;the longest running compilation series in the history of indie rock.&#39; Each song is unreleased and highlights include This Drama and the exuberant Young Hearts. The Emo Diaries is a compilation that trades in sugar highs, but rather than the chemical substitute it remains resolutely full.&quot; - New-Noise \r\n\r\n&quot;Three years after Deep Elm retired the Emo Diaries, it looks like the label is ready to make some well deserved &quot;Taking Back&quot; pot shots and rescue one of the most overused terms in music from Silverstein, make-up and MySpace. Almost every track on Chapter 11 seems to draw influence from Deep Elm&#39;s roster, with sonic similarities to Cross My Heart, Camber and the Appleseed Cast popping up everywhere. While You Were Gone&#39;s &#39;Hey Lola&#39;, a pop punk gem delivered with all the earnestness of classic Pollen, is easily the strongest selection while Panel&#39;s passionate aping of Planes Mistaken For Stars is another stand-out. Taking Back What&#39;s Ours serves up some strong examples of non-Victory Records emo.&quot; - Exclaim!\r\n\r\nwww.deepelm.com/emodiaries",

(this world is not fine on its own, so i'll show them just how much they mean to me) i wanna know what makes you grit your teeth, and everything that questions your motives. when will we ever see your face and how you look today? i wonder, i wonder why must we be so self-contained, and will this ever change? i wonder, i wonder (i'm sick of playing by the rules cause i think you played us like a fool so lets take a timeout and reevaluate your situation.) (take that plank out of your eye, before your judge the one in mine.) i'm sick of playing by the rules, åcause i think you played us like a fool\n\n5.\n\ni'd dream awake if i could. cause its nights like this i wish i had my girl. i'll break this off like i should. but this worlds to empty for me and counting souls. so say what i know you'll say, i don't know. give all the words give. break all the things you touch. it just goes on and on and on. she doesn't talk to silhouettes when shes the ghostman. i write letters on photographs when i'm the ghostman. he stops yelling at telephone poles when he's the ghostman. i just need to get away where's the ghostman. i'd lose the drugs if i could. but high schools the most tired i've ever been. and when my heart starts to drone. my head gets heavy and i lose control. so say what i know you'll say,i don't know. give all the words give. break all the things you touch. it just goes on and on and on. she doesn't like light cigarettes when shes the ghostman. i don't need to tear out my chest when i'm the ghostman. he likes to make you smile not cry when he's the ghostman. this worlds empty on counting souls. so long,the ghostman\n\n6.\n\nit's coming down. ten past the hour. filling up this empty street. as i watch it drown. beneath the water. i feel the pavement slipping out from under me. what we know has left us cold. it's sewn on us like a shadow. it opened up and never stopped. it's always raining. out of the rain. into the ocean. wash away whats left of me. the breaking waves. sound like explosions. my lungs are open to the water that i breathe. i'm sinking now. the sky retreats. as i'm depleted i feel a calm wash over me. there is no sound. there's just a feeling. and as i'm leaving i can finally see. there's no way out of this. there's no way\n\n7.\n\ni want love and some fame, some success without shame. to seek out perfection when our past is mentioned. how can i move forward, make progress, reward her. where is the logic, what are the facts. cuz i'm having the most terrible time. feeding my ego it binges and purges, progress takes some time. sad is my version, a perfect perversion, well i guess you could be right. remember and shiver, the secrets get bigger. i'm older more sober, my memory is over. intentions revealed now, its unclear if they count. show me some structure, draw me a map. cuz i'm having the most terrible time. feeding my ego it binges and purges, progress takes some time. sad is my version, a perfect perversion, well i guess you could be right. action right away tethered to purpose. well i guess you could be right. what's the point again, forgive me i'm stupid. well, i guess you could be right\n\n8.\n\nif i could hurt you. make this your last, final hour. like rain i will watch you fall. like rain i will watch you fall. here you lose. its your time to die now. they kill every one in ten (with more). with more than half your eye line. with more than half an eye. coursing like painful acid through veins. this dangerous situation, dangerous games. when you fall, fall like rain. this scarlet red moment will bring you. here you choose. its your time to fly now. they kill every one in ten (with more). with more than half your eye line. don't look back again. look away, always time to follow. those words that are set in stone (your last). your last and final hour last and final home\n\n9.\n\nthe end of the summer is the best time for nostalgia. these days are shorter. they remind me: i'm too old for this anyway. this chance was never meant to be mine. my time is up. i'm no longer scared of dying. i'm learning endings are always coming down on you. and if we challenge ourselves to learn, then we will have to challenge ourselves later. we'll have to make a choice. i'll have to make a choice: use what we learned or forget it; do what we love or regret it. i'm learning endings are always coming down on youä a crushing weight like a dark moonless nightä like a heavy wave frozen above you. there's a chill in the air and warmth in our chest. this summer sun just set down. autumn winds, it's gonna get real cold real soon. it's not over yet. 12 fucking years, this ending's not how i envisioned it. then again it's these songs that told me that l could have the world. the summer is ending, but its not over. our songs are forever. lets make them louder, while we can. this is looking to be a great fall. this coming fall is looking great, grab the bandages and tighten up the tourniquets and then with the turning golden leaves. i'm looking forward to my fall\n\n10.\n\nexplore. why don't you enjoy? there's more in life to see. get a grip and come over. adore. why don't you come over? there's more in life to see. at times, it's real hard you know. the day will come. when i step outside. and there's no need to run. and take a closer look. but i just always run away. run and run away. there's no place where i stay. when tension takes over. run and run away. run and run away. there's no place where i stay. when eyes stab me. ignore. the things you know you shouldn't see. get a grip, come on, enjoy. there's no crowd watching you. and run. and run. and run. and run away\n\n11.\n\ni'm not asking to always be the winner. how does it feel to have odds in your favour? i bet that it feels better. i bet it feels a damn sight better than this. i hope it does or it's pointless. i bet that it feels better. i bet it feels a damn sight better than this. i hope it does because i need the rush. hit hard, hit where it hurts. because the bigger they are, the harder they fall. i wont throw in the towel. with my eyes on the prize i sense a victory. it's not a fair fight but i wont be a quitter. how does it feel to be a main contender? i bet that it feels better. i bet it feels a damn sight better than this\n\n12.\n\nPanel - It's Airborne! 05:59"
