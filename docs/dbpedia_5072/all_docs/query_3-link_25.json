        "text": "Fatigue means feeling very tired, exhausted and lacking energy. It can be a symptom of the cancer itself or a side effect of treatment.\n\nFatigue is very common in people with cancer. Research suggests cancer related fatigue affects almost 65 out of 100 people with cancer (almost 65%).\n\nFor many, it can be the most troubling symptom of treatment and the most disruptive side effect of all.\n\nCancer related fatigue can affect you physically, emotionally, and mentally. How long it lasts, how severe it is, and how often you might have it is different from person to person.\n\nSymptoms of fatigue\n\nCancer related fatigue symptoms are very general and other things can cause them too.\n\nHere is a list of some symptoms you might have if you have cancer related fatigue:\n\nlack of energy – you may just want to stay in bed all day\n\nthe need to rest even when you’ve done little or no activity\n\nfeeling you just cannot be bothered to do much\n\nsleeping problems such as unable to sleep or disturbed sleep\n\nfinding it hard to get up in the morning\n\nfeeling anxious, sad or depressed\n\npain in your muscles – you may find it hard to climb stairs or walk short distances\n\nfeeling breathless after doing small tasks, for example, having a shower or making your bed\n\nfinding it hard to concentrate, even just watching TV or talking to a friend\n\nfinding it hard to think clearly or make decisions easily\n\nloss of interest in sex\n\nloss of interest in doing things you usually enjoy\n\nnegative feelings about yourself and others\n\nHow long can fatigue last?\n\nCancer related fatigue can be severe and last for different amounts of time depending on what’s causing it. Fatigue is different from tiredness which is usually short term and you feel better after you stop, sleep or rest. Cancer fatigue doesn’t usually go away with sleep or rest.\n\nThe symptoms of fatigue can often improve after your cancer treatment finishes. But fatigue can continue for several weeks, months, or even years after treatment.\n\nHow fatigue can affect your daily life\n\nFatigue can be very frustrating. You and your relatives might underestimate how much it can affect daily life.\n\nEveryday life can be difficult and you might not have the energy to cook, clean, bathe or go shopping. You might not even feel up to a chat. Things that you used to find easy to do can feel like hard work.\n\nFatigue can affect the way you feel about yourself and your relationships with other people. You can feel very down and not want to go out or be with people which can be hard for them to understand.\n\nYou might have to stop working or cut down your hours.\n\nSome people feel like fatigue is a constant reminder of their cancer and this can be hard to accept.\n\nYou might worry that because you feel so tired all the time your cancer could be getting worse. But it is more likely to be a side effect of treatment, or due to the fact that cancer can cause fatigue.\n\nAt the start of, and during your treatment your nurse or doctor will ask about your symptoms and how they affect your daily life. It’s important to tell them how you’re coping day to day and if you are struggling.\n\nManaging cancer fatigue\n\nFatigue is very real and can have a big impact on your life. There are some things you can do to help with fatigue. Speak with your doctor or nurse if you are feeling very tired or if you think you have symptoms of fatigue. There are ways of managing it and your healthcare team will try to help you."
