        "text": "Through the years, Nigerian popular music has undergone a plethora of interesting phases where audience interaction is concerned. In an effort to both understand the various new sounds emerging from Nigeria, and de-center Western narratives and their umbrella terms like “Afrobeats,” artists and fans alike have taken it upon themselves to create new genres for the country’s music. As Rema’s Afro-Rave or Burna Boy’s Afro-Fusion dominated the conversations, a slew of debatable options rose to the surface, including “Afro-Emo” and “Yahoopiano,” of which CKay and Shallipopi were crowned pioneers. Another running joke during this time was Omah Lay’s Afro-Depression; and while the name sounds distasteful, it accurately represents the thematic elements of Omah Lay’s music thus far, more specifically on his acclaimed debut ‘Boy Alone.’\n\nWhile the project was littered with groovy, upbeat synths alongside more melancholic rhythms, praise for the debut was largely due to the unbridled honesty and vulnerability captured throughout the album. Unlike his peers whose music orbited similar themes of women, sex and money, Omah Lay’s messaging and delivery stuck out mostly for how unafraid he was to discuss mental health; specifically anxiety and depression. This was an even bigger deal because it was happening in an African context, where those topics are only just beginning to gain serious attention; it was rare to find people talking openly about struggling mentally, let alone putting those struggles at the forefront of a newcomer’s music.\n\nOn Justin Bieber-assisted “attention” and “tell everybody,” Omah Lay delved into heartbreak, unabashedly begging his love interest for her undivided attention while screaming of their love from the highest rooftops. Despite retaining the same storyline, “never forget” and “soso” provide an even more wounded perspective to heartbreak, alluding to Omah’s over-dependence on his muse for his survival. However, he uses tracks like “understand” to get personal, emphasising his utter confusion with life with brooding hums on the melodious hook, “Everything I do I under under, I no fit under under under/Me I no fit under oh, under under I no fit understand.”\n\nHeartbreak-leaning hits aside, Omah Lay’s unfiltered rawness becomes most apparent on the early album opener “i’m a mess.” Pensive guitar strings create a tender atmosphere on “i’m a mess,” ushering in Omah Lay’s weighty confessions. “Sometimes I’m happy, sometimes I’m sad/I don’t know what’s over me,” he sings on the intro. His confusion becomes clearer in subsequent lines as he shares his struggle to understand the inconsistencies of his feelings. As much as “i’m a mess” details a very personal journey to self-discovery, it also expands on the effects that kind of instability can have on the people we surround ourselves with. Ultimately, when turning to those around him yielded no results, Omah Lay commits to a new found friend, alcohol, and a heavy reliance on substances, while searching for an escape from his reality. Despite the heavy messaging of the track, the groovy Niphkeys-produced instrumentals balance the mood without allowing listeners to lose sight of the self-deprecating number. And by the time it draws to its unsettling close, Omah Lay feelings are still unresolved. On “i’m a mess” and through the rest of ‘Boy Alone,’ Omah Lay is clearly most interested in flipping melancholy on its many sides, showing listeners the inner workings of his mind.\n\nNow a few weeks past the two year anniversary of ‘Boy Alone’ and a cryptic sophomore album announcement shared via X, it’s safe to say that Omah Lay’s tone in recent releases and features has taken a new direction. From a glittering delivery on Victony & Tempoe’s “Soweto (Remix)” to his final single of 2023, “Holy Ghost,” Omah Lay’s artistry has proven to be one stacked with consistent hit contributions but day 1 listeners are still weary we may have lost the sad boy elements he vehemently led with in the early stages of his career. Whether that is true or not, we can always rely on the fact that Omah Lay’s sophomore release will be one laced with honest, personal confessionals truly representative of the artist and whatever phase of life he is currently experiencing.\n\nFeatured Image Credits/The NATIVE"
