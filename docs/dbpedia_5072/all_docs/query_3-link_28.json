        "text": "Prescription Drugs\n\nPrescription drugs may also be an option for men with BPH. Types of drugs include:\n\nAlpha blockers are pills used to relax the muscles of the prostate and bladder to reduce BPH symptoms. They do not shrink the prostate but they may improve urine flow if there is a blockage. One benefit of alpha blockers is they start to work right away. Side effects may include dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue and difficulty ejaculating. Men with moderate to severe BPH and men who are bothered by their symptoms are good candidates. Alpha blockers are not a good choice if you plan to have cataract surgery soon.\n\nAlpha-blocking drugs include alfuzosin, doxazosin, silodosin, tamsulosin and terazosin.\n\n5-Alpha reductase inhibitors are pills that can increase urine flow and shrink the prostate by blocking DHT.DHT is a male hormone that can build up in the prostate and may cause prostate growth. These drugs may lower the risk of BPH problems and the need for surgery. Side effects include erectile dysfunction and reduced libido (sex drive).You must keep taking the pills to prevent symptoms from coming back. These may be best for men with very large prostate glands.\n\nThese prescription drugs may take many months to become fully effective and include dutasteride and finasteride.\n\nCombined therapy uses both an alpha blocker and a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor. They may work better together than either drug does alone to stop BPH from getting worse. By taking two drugs, you may have more side effects than if you were taking just one. Some side effects may include dizziness, erectile dysfunction, weakness or lack of energy and a drop in blood pressure when moving from sitting or lying down to standing. A urologist may add antimuscarinics for patients with overactive bladder symptoms. Overactive bladder is when the bladder muscles squeeze uncontrollably. It leads to frequent and urgent need to pass urine. It can lead to incontinence (leaking). Antimuscarinics relax the bladder muscles.\n\nMen with larger prostates are good candidates for this treatment.\n\nPossible drug combinations include:\n\nFinasteride and doxazosin\n\nDutasteride and tamsulosin, a combination of both medications that is available in a single tablet\n\nAlpha blockers and antimuscarinics\n\nPhytotherapies or herbal therapies are not recommended by health care providers. One popular herb is saw palmetto. Several important studies show they do not work. Also, the quality and purity of supplements vary.\n\nLess Invasive Surgery\n\nLess invasive surgery or minimally invasive surgical treatments (MIST) can often be done as an outpatient, without a stay in the hospital. Recovery time is usually quicker. It can offer relief from symptoms, including urine control problems. Some MISTS do not reduce your risk for another surgery or needing to take medications again. Be sure to ask your urologist about re-treatment rates whenever considering a MIST or even more invasive surgery.\n\nGood candidates include men who have taken BPH medication that did not work or men with the following symptoms:\n\nWeak stream of urine\n\nStraining to start to pass urine\n\nUrinary tract obstruction, bladder stones and/or blood in your urine\n\nIncomplete emptying\n\nBleeding from the prostate\n\nThere are several types of less invasive surgeries from which to choose. The option will depend on the size of your prostate, your overall health and your personal choice.\n\nProstatic urethral lift (PUL) uses a needle to place tiny implants in the prostate. These implants lift and compress the enlarged prostate so that it no longer blocks the urethra. These implants stay in the body forever and are not easily removed. PUL may be done with either local or general anesthesia.\n\nWith this treatment there are no cuts in the body and tissue is not destroyed or removed. Many men with enlarged prostates and urinary symptoms are good candidates. There are fewer sexual side effects with this, compared to other types of prostate surgery. MRI can still be done if you had a PUL. Talk to your doctor about how PUL may impact the image quality of future MRI used for prostate cancer detection and if you are allergic to nickel, titanium or stainless steel. Current studies have evaluated five years of treatment with PUL and future studies may help to determine long term durability.\n\nWater vapor thermal therapy (WVTT) uses water vapor (steam) to destroy prostate cells squeezing the urethra. This treatment can be done in a doctor’s office with local anesthesia or after you have taken a pill for pain. It uses a special handheld device with a needle at the end. It combines radiofrequency energy and water to create steam. The needle and steam cause rapid cell death. The body’s natural healing response then breaks down and removes the dead tissue, causing the prostate to shrink.\n\nMen may be good candidates if they do not want to take medication for BPH or if they have tried prescription drugs and found they do not work. Men who prefer not to have surgery or want to avoid sexual side effects may also be good candidates.\n\nYou may have blood in your urine and need to use a catheter for a few days. Painful or frequent urination should go away within about two to three weeks. Sexual side effects, such as erectile dysfunction, are unlikely.\n\nStudies currently suggest that symptom improvement lasts for at least five years.\n\nTemporary Implanted Prostatic Devices (TIPD) are placed in the prostatic urethra through a cystoscope and remain there for a period of about a week after which it is removed by the urologist. While in position, it functions to re-shape the urine channel. In re-shaping the urethra, there is a modest lessening of the prostatic obstruction and thus a modest improvement in the symptoms of BPH and improved urine flow. It is a low-risk procedure that can be inserted in the OR or in the office. It may relieve bladder obstruction. TIPD poses a low risk of side effects, such as urinary tract infections, urinary incontinence and scarring in the urethra. Some men have symptoms that include frequent or intense urges to pass urine and a burning feeling when passing urine.\n\nProstate Artery Embolization (PAE) is a radiologic procedure done by radiologists to block blood flow to the prostate to try to shrink the entire gland to improve symptoms. This newer procedure does not have long term data to understand its durability. PAE probably improves urinary symptoms, at least for short periods measured for less than a year. There is a shortage of substantial evidence to recommend PAE over more widely available minimally invasive therapies for the routine treatment of LUTS, but there is evidence showing a short-term benefit of PAE compared to observation in a very select patient population.\n\nCatheterization uses a tube called a catheter in the bladder to drain urine. Catheters can be placed through the urethra or via a small puncture in the bladder above the pubic bone. This option is helpful for men with bladder control problems and a blocked prostate. Still, catheters' benefits are temporary. Infection is a risk. This treatment is best for men who are waiting for medication to work, or waiting for surgery. They also help when there is an infection, or for men toward the end of their lives, when surgery is not advised. There are two types:\n\nClean, where the catheter is placed and removed every six to eight hours. This can be done by yourself or by a caregiver. For this, the catheter is removed when the urine flow stops.\n\nIndwelling, where the catheter stays in the bladder for longer periods of time.\n\nMore Invasive Surgery\n\nIn severe cases of BPH or when other options fail, more invasive surgery is recommended. Surgery is best if you:\n\nAre unable to pass urine\n\nHave kidney damage\n\nHave frequent urinary tract infections\n\nHave a lot of bleeding\n\nHave stones in the bladder\n\nThere are several types of more invasive surgery options from which to choose. The option will depend on your health, your doctor’s expertise and your personal choice. Options below appear in order of least invasive to most invasive.\n\nTransurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) is used to widen the urethra if the prostate gland is small but causes a major blockage. For TUIP, the surgeon makes small cuts in the bladder neck, where the urethra joins the bladder and in the prostate. This widens the urethra and reduces the pressure of the prostate on the urethra, making urination easier. The hospital stay is one to three days. A catheter is left in your bladder for one to three days after surgery. Some men need follow-up treatment. Men who do not want a complete prostatectomy (removal of the prostate) but need surgery are good candidates.\n\nPhotoselective vaporization (PVP) is a way to vaporize prostate tissue with a high-powered laser. Most men can have a PVP without problems. The procedure is done as an outpatient procedure at the hospital or sometimes in the doctor’s office. There are few side effects. After PVP, most men can stop medical therapy. This method is useful for most men except those with the largest of prostates. Because this method causes very little blood loss it is particularly useful in men with a higher risk of bleeding, such as those taking blood-thinning medications or those with weak hearts.\n\nTransurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is a common surgery for BPH.TURP uses electric current or laser light to cut and remove tissue. This is done with anesthesia and a tool called a resectoscope inserted through the penis. The resectoscope provides light, irrigating fluid and an electrical loop. The loop cuts tissue and seals blood vessels. The removed tissue is flushed into the bladder and out of the body with a catheter. Men who require surgery because of moderate to severe BPH symptoms may be good candidates for TURP.\n\nHolmium laser enucleation of prostate (HoLEP) is when a surgeon places a resectoscope through the penis into the urethra. A laser inserted into the resectoscope destroys excess prostate tissue. No incisions (cuts) are needed and there is very little bleeding. You may only need to stay one night in the hospital. A catheter is used, but it is usually removed the next day. Men with larger prostates who wish to avoid more-invasive surgery may be good candidates for this treatment. Men with a higher risk of bleeding, such as those taking blood-thinning medications, may also be good candidates for HoLEP.\n\nThulium laser enucleation of the prostate (ThuLEP) is similar to HoLEP but uses a different type of laser. As in HoLEP, the surgeon places a resectoscope through the penis into the urethra. A laser inserted into the resectoscope destroys excess prostate tissue. Men with larger prostates who wish to avoid more-invasive surgery may be good candidates for this treatment. No incisions (cuts) are needed and there is very little bleeding. You may only need to stay one night in the hospital. A catheter is used, but it is usually removed the next day. Men with a higher risk of bleeding, such as those taking blood-thinning medications, may also be good candidates for ThuLEP.\n\nTransurethral vaporization of the prostate (TUVP) is when the surgeon inserts a resectoscope into the urethra with a lens, a light, and a tool that sends out an electrical current to destroy prostate tissue. Heat from the electrical current seals small blood vessels, reducing the risk of bleeding. There is little bleeding or fluid absorption. You may stay one night in the hospital and you can usually return home without a catheter. Men with larger prostates who wish to avoid more-invasive surgery may be good candidates for TUVP.\n\nTransurethral water–jet ablation (TWJA) uses high-pressure water jets to destroy excess prostate tissue. The surgeon first uses ultrasound to precisely map the location of the excess tissue. Then the high-pressure water jets are directed to that area. Following this, the surgeon inserts another instrument to seal small blood vessels to reduce the risk of bleeding. The patient needs to stay in the hospital one night to irrigate the bladder to prevent blood clots. You may need to use a catheter for about 48 hours after the procedure and should be able to go home the next day.\n\nSimple prostatectomy removes the entire prostate gland with laparoscopic or robotic-assisted surgery. It is important for the surgeon to be skilled at this surgery. This is only offered to men with the largest of prostate glands. This is a long- term cure. You will probably stay in the hospital for a few days after surgery and your activities will be limited for several weeks. A catheter will usually be needed for 1 to 2 weeks while you heal.\n\nWhat to Expect After Surgery\n\nFor most men, symptoms of BPH improve after treatment. After surgery, it can take time for sexual function to return fully. Most experts believe that if you were able to have an erection shortly before surgery, you will be able to after surgery. Your orgasm is not expected to change. In some cases, men can experience an issue where semen enters the bladder rather than out the penis (retrograde ejaculation.)\n\nInfection, bleeding and incontinence may also occur after some BPH treatments. In some cases, scar tissue may form. Side effects vary with the type of treatment you choose and most side effects are temporary. Some men need further or new treatment for their BPH symptoms after initial treatment.\n\nIt is of great value to tell your doctor about any side effect you may have to get help."
