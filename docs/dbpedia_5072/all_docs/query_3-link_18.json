        "text": "What are eating disorders?\n\nEating disorders are serious, biologically influenced medical illnesses marked by severe disturbances to one’s eating behaviors. Although many people may be concerned about their health, weight, or appearance from time to time, some people become fixated or obsessed with weight loss, body weight or shape, and controlling their food intake. These may be signs of an eating disorder.\n\nEating disorders are not a choice. These disorders can affect a person’s physical and mental health. In some cases, they can be life-threatening. With treatment, however, people can recover completely from eating disorders.\n\nWho is at risk for eating disorders?\n\nEating disorders can affect people of all ages, racial and ethnic backgrounds, body weights, and genders. Even people who appear healthy, such as athletes, can have eating disorders and be extremely ill. People with eating disorders can be underweight, normal weight, or overweight. In other words, you can’t tell if someone has an eating disorder by looking at them.\n\nThe exact cause of eating disorders is not fully understood. Research suggests a combination of genetic, biological, behavioral, psychological, and social factors can raise a person’s risk.\n\nWhat are the common types of eating disorders?\n\nCommon eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, and avoidant restrictive food intake disorder. Each of these disorders is associated with different but sometimes overlapping symptoms. People exhibiting any combination of these symptoms may have an eating disorder and should be evaluated by a health care provider.\n\nWhat is anorexia nervosa?\n\nAnorexia nervosa is a condition where people avoid food, severely restrict food, or eat very small quantities of only certain foods. They also may weigh themselves repeatedly. Even when dangerously underweight, they may see themselves as overweight.\n\nThere are two subtypes of anorexia nervosa: a restrictive subtype and a binge-purge subtype.\n\nRestrictive: People with the restrictive subtype of anorexia nervosa severely limit the amount and type of food they consume.\n\nBinge-Purge: People with the binge-purge subtype of anorexia nervosa also greatly restrict the amount and type of food they consume. In addition, they may have binge-eating and purging episodes—eating large amounts of food in a short time followed by vomiting or using laxatives or diuretics to get rid of what was consumed.\n\nSymptoms of anorexia nervosa include:\n\nExtremely restricted eating and/or intensive and excessive exercise\n\nExtreme thinness (emaciation)\n\nA relentless pursuit of thinness and unwillingness to maintain a normal or healthy weight\n\nIntense fear of gaining weight\n\nDistorted body or self-image that is heavily influenced by perceptions of body weight and shape\n\nDenial of the seriousness of low body weight\n\nOver time, anorexia nervosa can lead to numerous serious health consequences, including:\n\nThinning of the bones (osteopenia or osteoporosis)\n\nMild anemia\n\nMuscle wasting and weakness\n\nBrittle hair and nails\n\nDry and yellowish skin\n\nGrowth of fine hair all over the body (lanugo)\n\nSevere constipation\n\nLow blood pressure\n\nSlowed breathing and pulse\n\nDamage to the structure and function of the heart\n\nDrop in internal body temperature, causing a person to feel cold all the time\n\nLethargy, sluggishness, or feeling tired all the time\n\nInfertility\n\nBrain damage\n\nMultiple organ failure\n\nAnorexia nervosa can be fatal. It has an extremely high death (mortality) rate compared with other mental disorders. People with anorexia are at risk of dying from medical complications associated with starvation. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for people diagnosed with anorexia nervosa.\n\nWhat is bulimia nervosa?\n\nBulimia nervosa is a condition where people have recurrent episodes of eating unusually large amounts of food and feeling a lack of control over their eating. This binge eating is followed by behaviors that compensate for the overeating to prevent weight gain, such as forced vomiting, excessive use of laxatives or diuretics, fasting, excessive exercise, or a combination of these behaviors. Unlike those with anorexia nervosa, people with bulimia nervosa may maintain a normal weight or be overweight.\n\nSymptoms and health consequences of bulimia nervosa include:\n\nChronically inflamed and sore throat\n\nSwollen salivary glands in the neck and jaw area\n\nWorn tooth enamel and increasingly sensitive and decaying teeth from exposure to stomach acid when vomiting\n\nAcid reflux disorder and other gastrointestinal problems\n\nIntestinal distress and irritation from laxative abuse\n\nSevere dehydration from purging\n\nElectrolyte imbalance (too low or too high levels of sodium, calcium, potassium, and other minerals), which can lead to stroke or heart attack\n\nWhat is binge-eating disorder?\n\nBinge-eating disorder is a condition where people lose control of their eating and have reoccurring episodes of eating unusually large amounts of food. Unlike bulimia nervosa, periods of binge eating are not followed by purging, excessive exercise, or fasting. As a result, people with binge-eating disorder are often overweight or obese.\n\nSymptoms of binge-eating disorder include:\n\nEating unusually large amounts of food in a short amount of time, for example, within two hours\n\nEating rapidly during binge episodes\n\nEating even when full or not hungry\n\nEating until uncomfortably full\n\nEating alone or in secret to avoid embarrassment\n\nFeeling distressed, ashamed, or guilty about eating\n\nFrequently dieting, possibly without weight loss\n\nWhat is avoidant restrictive food intake disorder?\n\nAvoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), previously known as selective eating disorder, is a condition where people limit the amount or type of food eaten. Unlike anorexia nervosa, people with ARFID do not have a distorted body image or extreme fear of gaining weight. ARFID is most common in middle childhood and usually has an earlier onset than other eating disorders. Many children go through phases of picky eating, but a child with ARFID does not eat enough calories to grow and develop properly, and an adult with ARFID does not eat enough calories to maintain basic body function.\n\nSymptoms of ARFID include:\n\nDramatic restriction of types or amount of food eaten\n\nLack of appetite or interest in food\n\nDramatic weight loss\n\nUpset stomach, abdominal pain, or other gastrointestinal issues with no other known cause\n\nLimited range of preferred foods that becomes even more limited (“picky eating” that gets progressively worse)\n\nHow are eating disorders treated?\n\nEating disorders can be treated successfully. Early detection and treatment are important for a full recovery. People with eating disorders are at higher risk for suicide and medical complications.\n\nA person’s family can play a crucial role in treatment. Family members can encourage the person with eating or body image issues to seek help. They also can provide support during treatment and can be a great ally to both the individual and the health care provider. Research suggests that incorporating the family into treatment for eating disorders can improve treatment outcomes, particularly for adolescents.\n\nTreatment plans for eating disorders include psychotherapy, medical care and monitoring, nutritional counseling, medications, or a combination of these approaches. Typical treatment goals include:\n\nRestoring adequate nutrition\n\nBringing weight to a healthy level\n\nReducing excessive exercise\n\nStopping binge-purge and binge-eating behaviors\n\nPeople with eating disorders also may have other mental disorders (such as depression or anxiety) or problems with substance use. It’s critical to treat any co-occurring conditions as part of the treatment plan.\n\nSpecific forms of psychotherapy (“talk therapy”) and cognitive-behavioral approaches can treat certain eating disorders effectively. For general information about psychotherapies, visit the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) psychotherapies webpage.\n\nResearch also suggests that medications may help treat some eating disorders and co-occurring anxiety or depression related to eating disorders. Information about medications changes frequently, so talk to your health care provider. Visit the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website for the latest warnings, patient medication guides, and FDA-approved medications.\n\nAre there clinical trials studying eating disorders?\n\nNIMH supports a wide range of research, including clinical trials that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions, including eating disorders. Although individuals may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future.\n\nResearchers at NIMH and around the country conduct clinical trials with patients and healthy volunteers. Talk to your health care provider about clinical trials, their benefits and risks, and whether one is right for you. For more information about clinical research and how to find clinical trials being conducted around the country, visit NIMH's clinical trials webpage.\n\nReprints\n\nThe information in this publication is in the public domain and may be reused or copied without permission.
