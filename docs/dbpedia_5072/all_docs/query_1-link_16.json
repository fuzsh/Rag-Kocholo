        "text": "Joyce Manor an American rock band that formed in Torrance, California. The banded formed in 2008 and the members are Barry Johnson, Chase Knobbe, Jeff Enzor and Matt Ebert. The originally band was just a duo of Barry and Chase, they got the idea while they where hammered at Disneyland. Their first release was a split with 7″ with Summer Vacation in the fall of 2010.\n\nJoyce Manor released their self-tilted, full-length album in 2011 and to their surprise the band received a lot of praise. Not only from the fans Punknews named it their “2011 Album of the Year” also landing the band on a lot of best-of list. The whole album is a hit there is not a single bad song on this album. Every track is considered a classic to most of the punk community.\n\nThe next album Of All Things I Will Soon Grow Tired was released in 2012. The album has a cover of the song Video Killed the Radio Star by The Buggles. Its a nice short album that flows well with each song that is great to bass the time. The third album Never Hungover Again was released in 2014. Joyce Manor received a lot of attention within the punk and indie communities for their stance stage divers when the band called out several sets to call out stage divers. Heres the link to the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LalVmgtcK-U&feature=youtu.be .\n\nJoyce Manor are legends in the punk and indie communities. Ever since they released their first album they have been producing hits after hits and keeping their fans happy. The latest album Cody which was just released this year. Has received almost nothing but positive feed back. These guys are legends and should keep an eye on them because they will do something ground breaking again very soon.\n\nModerrn Baseball is a pop punk band the band was form with Brendan Luckens and Jake Ewald. They werefriends in high school from Brunswick, Maryland they where originally an acoustic duo before they move to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to go to college. Later on they met the drummer Sean Huber and bassist Ian Farmer. Luckens and Ewald come up with the name Modern Baseball from a book that Ewald father owned called “Modern Baseball Techniques”.\n\nModern Baseball has three albums Sports, You’re Gonna Miss It All, and Holy ghost. Sports is the first album and has many of the bands classic songs on it. Re-Do , Re-Done, Tears Over Beers, and last but not less The Weekend. Its a goofy album that reminds you of what youth really is. With this album Modern Baseball quickly become one of the most popular band in the indie/emo scene.\n\nWith the attention that they received from releasing Sports that grabbed the attention of Run For Cover. Modern Baseball signed up with Run For Cover in early 2013. They released another album one year later You’re Gonna Miss It All being another hit album. You’re Gonna Miss It All charted at #97 on the Billboard’s Top 200.\n\nThe newest album Holy Ghost is an album where you can hear how the band has mature. As the band has gotten older their music has mature as well as their audience. These guys have produce hit after hit and are still changing their sounds. No matter what Modern Baseball has done they still produce results its just the mark of a great band that has changed the music scene.\n\nTigers Jaw is an American rock band from Scranton, Pennsylvanian. The band formed in 2005 and soon went on hiatus in 2013. The original members were Ben Walsh, Brianna Collins, Adam Mcllwee, Mike May, Dennis Mishko, Par Brier. Now the band only consists of Ben and Brianna. Run for Cover Records posted that the band never broke up and that they are still making music.\n\nAbsolutePunk gave Tigers Jaw’s self-titled album a generally good review . Saying that “Tigers Jaw is fueled by emotionally-driven lyrics brought to life by vocalist Adam McIlwee, whose voice is one of those that reveal passion while at the same time giving the impression that he’s barely trying. Aforementioned opener “The Sun” is one of the better tracks on the album, offering up a well-organized mix of Tigers Jaw’s two personas.”\n\nPunknews.org the punk music site during their critique of their album Tigers Jaw, said that the tracks “solid guitar work in the form of weeping, goosebump-inducing solos. Strong vocal harmonies and bouncy guitar work carry both “I Saw Water” and “Heat” to heights other bands would have a hard time reaching.” After reading what punknews said I needed to hear them and I was not disappointed at all. The third album Two Worlds is another great album with the song Two Worlds being the hit. The next album Charmer features the old band member’s.\n\nIt was great to listen back to the former Tigers Jaw with the new members back they sounded better than ever. Was played non-stop in my home, car, working, using the restroom it was the greats songs i have heard for awhile. The hit on the album was alright however I felt that Cool was a better song though. Tigers Jaw is a band that lives up to the genre of Indie rock that anyone will love.\n\n$uicideboy$ are underground rappers who are growing fairly large. They are different from what you would call traditional rap music. The music is loud and somewhat angry with beat fetish which is the beats that are used are very captivating and alluring that just want you to listen to more. What they talk about might be a little to crazy for some however for other’s such as myself you will enjoy it o so very much.\n\nThe group consist of two people Ruby and $crim. Ruby and $crim are cousins that are from New Orleans. The subjects they talk about in their music would be consider more darker and controversial to some. Drugs, money, and other typical rap things but they put a little twist on it. The music is a little darker as in what they say, but its still amazing.\n\nAs of now they only have one album which is ETERNAL GREY and it is free on soundcloud. ETERNAL GREY has 14 tracks with features of DA$H, Chris Travis, Denzel Curry, and Yung Simmie. With the hit track Ultimate $uicide on the albume feat Denzel Curry is a must listen to anyone. The album is about 32 minutes long and its a must listen to anyone.\n\nAlong with having one album they also have some mixtapes most of their music can be found on soundcloud. All of their music is free so there is no need to pay for it! All of the music that they have made can be found there. Anything new that comes out will be found on the link.
