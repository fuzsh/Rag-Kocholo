        "text": "What is anorexia nervosa?\n\nAnorexia nervosa is an eating disorder and a serious mental illness. Eating disorders are not a choice. This can be very confusing to others looking on.\n\nOut of a fear of gaining weight, someone with anorexia nervosa may follow a restrictive diet and do too much exercise.\n\nA person with anorexia nervosa:\n\nhas a very distorted body image\n\nhas an intense and often irrational fear of gaining weight\n\nrestricts their energy intake\n\ndoes excessive exercise\n\nThe restriction in energy intake can cause a large amount of weight loss in a short period of time. It may result in you having a very low weight.\n\nPeople with anorexia nervosa often see themselves as being heavy or large when they are very underweight. Their body image can have a large influence on how they feel about themselves. Extreme weight loss can drastically change the way you think and how your brain functions.\n\nTypes of anorexia nervosa\n\nAnorexia nervosa falls into 2 general types:\n\nrestricting type\n\nbinge eating\n\nRestricting type\n\nPeople with this type of anorexia nervosa restrict the amount and type of food they eat.\n\nThis can include:\n\ncounting calories\n\nskipping meals\n\nlimiting or avoiding certain food groups (such as carbohydrates)\n\nfollowing obsessive rules, such as only eating foods of a certain colour\n\nThese behaviours may be accompanied by too much exercise.\n\nBinge eating/purging type\n\nPeople with this type of anorexia place severe restrictions on the food they eat and they also purge. Purging behaviours include vomiting (being sick) or misusing laxatives, diuretics or enemas.\n\nSome people may also binge eat — eat a large amount of food and feel out of control.\n\nAtypical anorexia nervosa\n\nAtypical anorexia nervosa is a type of eating disorder called Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders (OSFED).\n\nThis is when you have all the behaviours of anorexia nervosa, but your body mass index (BMI) is normal or above.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of anorexia nervosa?\n\nThe most obvious signs of anorexia nervosa are:\n\nbeing underweight\n\nlosing weight very quickly\n\nhaving dramatic weight fluctuations\n\ncontrolling and restricting food intake\n\nbeing preoccupied with food and body weight\n\nBeing very thin is not the only sign of anorexia nervosa. There are other signs that you may have with anorexia nervosa.\n\nPhysical signs\n\nPhysical signs can include:\n\nfainting or dizziness\n\nfeeling cold even when the weather is warm\n\nbloating, constipation or developing food intolerances\n\nfeeling tired and not sleeping well\n\nlow energy\n\nlooking pale or having sunken eyes\n\nfine hair on your face and body\n\nloss of menstruation (your period) in females\n\ndecreased libido (sex drive) in males\n\nPsychological signs\n\nPsychological signs can include:\n\nbeing preoccupied with eating, food, body shape and weight\n\nbeing extremely dissatisfied with body image and irrational ideas about body and weight\n\nbeing anxious, irritable or secretive at mealtimes\n\nfear of gaining weight\n\ndepression and anxiety\n\ndifficulty thinking and concentrating\n\nhaving rigid thoughts about food\n\nlow self-esteem and perfectionism\n\nBehavioural signs\n\nBehavioural signs can include:\n\nintense dieting (counting calories, avoiding foods)\n\ndeliberately misusing laxatives, appetite suppressants, enemas and diuretics\n\nobsessive behaviours around body weight or shape (repeated weighing, pinching waist or wrists)\n\nbinge eating\n\navoiding eating with other people and secrecy around food\n\nwanting to be alone\n\nexcessive exercising\n\nobsessive rituals around food\n\npreoccupation with cooking, recipes and nutrition\n\nself-harm, substance abuse or suicide attempts\n\nCHECK YOUR SYMPTOMS — Use the Symptom Checker and find out if you need to seek medical help.\n\nWhat causes anorexia nervosa?\n\nThe causes of anorexia nervosa are not fully understood.\n\nThere are some things that can increase your risk:\n\nGenetic risk factors — anorexia nervosa can run in families, suggesting there may be a genetic cause.\n\nCultural factors — related ideals of thinness promoted by the media and social media.\n\nEnvironmental factors — including the onset of puberty, stressful life events and relationship problems.\n\nFor some people, anorexia is a way of controlling areas of life that feel out of control. Their body image can define their entire sense of self-worth.\n\nPsychological factors such as anxiety may also play a role in the development of anorexia.\n\nWho gets anorexia nervosa?\n\nAnyone can get anorexia nervosa, but it’s most often diagnosed in females. This may be because many males do not show signs that are as obvious. However, the number of males diagnosed with anorexia nervosa is growing.\n\nAnorexia usually starts in adolescence, with 4 in 10 cases being diagnosed between 15 years and 19 years.\n\nWhen should I see my doctor?\n\nIf you are worried about your eating, it’s important to speak someone. You could talk to someone you trust like a friend, family member or teacher.\n\nYour doctor is also a good place to start. They will help you take the first steps towards treatment and recovery.\n\nIf you have anorexia nervosa, the earlier you get help, the better your chances of recovery. Seriously restricting calorie intake is dangerous and can have a serious impact on your health.\n\nIf you have signs of anorexia nervosa, it is important to get help as soon as possible.\n\nFIND A HEALTH SERVICE — The Service Finder can help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services.\n\nASK YOUR DOCTOR — Preparing for an appointment? Use the Question Builder for general tips on what to ask your GP or specialist.\n\nHow is anorexia nervosa diagnosed?\n\nYour doctor will examine you and ask you questions about your health. They will also check for any other mental or physical complications.\n\nYour doctor may diagnose anorexia nervosa based on your thoughts, feelings and eating behaviours.\n\nHow is anorexia nervosa treated?\n\nIt is possible to recover from anorexia nervosa, even if you have been living with the illness for many years. The road to recovery is often long and challenging. But with the right team supporting you and a high level of commitment, you can recover.\n\nPsychological support\n\nSeeing a psychologist or psychiatrist has been shown to reduce the length and impact of anorexia nervosa.\n\nCognitive behavioural therapy enhanced for eating disorders (CBT‐E) is usually the first treatment recommended for adults. This is typically delivered over 40 weekly sessions.\n\nFamily‐based therapy is usually the first treatment recommended for children and adolescents.\n\nA psychologist can help you learn behaviours that will help you get to and maintain a healthy weight.\n\nOther treatments\n\nYou may also see a:\n\ndietitian\n\nfamily therapist\n\nIf you have life-threatening medical complications or have very low body weight, you may need to spend time in hospital.\n\nAntidepressants and other medicines are sometimes used to treat anorexia nervosa, along with psychological therapy.\n\nComplications of anorexia nervosa\n\nIf you, or someone else, is at immediate risk of suicide, call triple zero (000) now for an ambulance.\n\nAnorexia nervosa can also cause physical complications including:\n\nanaemia\n\nintestinal problems\n\nproblems with your immune system\n\nan irregular heartbeat or other heart problems\n\nosteoporosis and bone problems that can increase the risk of broken bones\n\nkidney failure\n\nAnorexia nervosa can be life threatening. This can be due to the physical or psychological impacts of the disease.\n\nMental health complications can include self-harm, substance abuse and suicide.\n\nResources and support\n\nThe National Eating Disorders Collaboration has information on evidence-informed prevention and treatment of eating disorders.\n\nYou can speak confidentially to the Butterfly National Helpline.
