        "text": "So by now unless you have been living under a rock you are probably aware of the fact that emo has indeed become a major nostalgia point for millenials and that the genre is having a major renaissance.\n\nDuring the interim years when the genre was maybe not the coolest thing to admit to being a fan of, some of the genre's most reputable stars began second music careers in an attempt to distance themselves from that particular scene.\n\nIn honor of Emo Night LA's third Taking Back Tuesday at the Echoplex next month and a slew of great shows coming up like Dashboard Confessional at The Verizon Wireless Amphitheater we put together a list of Emo musicians who found even more success as indie or pop stars long after the days of swoopy bangs and girl jeans.\n\nBy: Domenico DeCaro\n\nTwin Forks - Chris Carraba of Dashboard Confessional\n\nChances are if you attended high school anytime between 2000-2008 you were a huge Dashboard Confessional fan. What wasn't to love, Chris Carraba had songs with angst ridden lyrics, beautiful melodies and hooks for days. Carraba never seemed like someone who was content with being pigeonholed though, and by 2014 his new Alt-Country tinged project Twin Forks had brought him critical acclaim and an entire new fan base. For anyone who missed his Emo days fear not, Dashboard is back in a big way touring with Third Eye Blind all summer long!\n\nVacationer - Kenny Vasoli of The Starting Line\n\nKenny Vasoli rose to emo stardom in his late teens and early 20s as the frontman of The Starting Line. The Starting Line are mostly remembered for their pop punk smash \"Best of Me\" which roughly 700 people sang along to in unison at last month's Emo Night LA at The Echoplex. After riding the emo wave for years Vasoli grew tired of the scene, changed his nickname, ditched his flatiron, disbanded The Starting Line and set off on a new musical path with Vacationer. Kenny now suddenly went by Kenneth and his music started having more in common with Panda Bear than New Found Glory with startlingly awesome results. Don't miss Vacationer opening for Rubblebucket at the Echoplex next week!\n\nMystery Skulls - Luis Dubuc of The Secret Handshake\n\nLuis Dubuc originally found fame on the pages of Alternative Press and on the stages at The Vans Warped Tour with his keyboard emo project known simply as The Secret Handshake. Dubuc's electro emo dance tracks were cute, endearing and extremely catchy. Near the end of The Secret Handshake he even started delving into Motown as a reference point. Still keeping it within the electronic realm, Dubuc emerged years later as a bonafide electro pop star hitting the college circuit with his new project Mystery Skulls. The band have in many ways have far surpassed the popularity of The Secret Handshake. Mystery Skulls debut album is out now!\n\nThe Kills/The Dead Weather - Allison Mosshart of Discount\n\nThough for the most part Mosshart refuses to discuss her emo past with the press, there are thousands of people across the states who would love to see her reunite Gainesville, Florida's Discount. Discount were a pop punk band long before it was fashionable and Echo's of Mosshart's energetic vocal style can still be heard today in indie rock through bands like Waxahatchee and Field Mouse. Ultimately we are still thrilled that Mosshart went on to more success with The Kills and of course The Dead Weather but that doesn't mean we still aren't holding out for a Discount reunion!\n\nSkrillex - Sonny Moore Of From First To Last\n\nPerhaps the biggest poster child for Life After Emo Sonny Moore blew away everyone when he evolved from being the shrieking high pitched singer/screamer of From First To Last into one of modern EDM's most massive stars as Skrillex. While there are an entire generation of scene kids holding out for the original lineup of From First To Last to reform with Sonny on vocals, Moore seems content with not resting on his laurels, by keeping busy in recent years with his new project Jack U which also features Diplo.\n\nNight Terrors Of 1927 - Jarrod Gorbel of The Honorary Title and Blake Sennet of Rilo Kiley\n\nGorbel and Sennet were more on the singer songwriter end of the emo spectrum but both definitely got their start playing in overly emotional bands. Gorbel's The Honorary Title had the insanely melodramatic (but still super awesome) Valentines's day ballad \"Everything I Once Had\" and Sennet shared an entire scene and fan base with emo forefathers like Bright Eyes, Death Cab For Cutie and Cursive. In this decade both are now destined for indie pop greatness with the perfectly modern Night Terrors of 1927 a band with arena rock ambitions and the tunes to back them up!\n\nFun. and Bleachers - Nate Ruess of The Format and Jack Antonoff of Steel Train\n\nMost people know Nate Ruess and Jack Antonoff for their massively successful pop bands Fun. and Bleachers, but both musicians also got their start in beloved emo bands. Antonoff bridged the gap between Arcade Fire, Wilco and Dashboard Confessional with Steel Train who were signed to pop-punk institution Drive-Thru Records. Ruess had already been making young girls swoon for years with his Arizona emo outfit The Format whose aptly titled \"The First Single\" was indeed the sign of his great pop success to come. (Seen here at The Mayan Theater in LA with Jim Adkins of Jimmy Eat World!)\n\nThe Cave Singers and Fleet Foxes - Morgan Henderson Of The Blood Brothers\n\nMorgan Henderson was the unforgettable bass player of Seattle's favorite post-everything-core band The Blood Brothers, but in recent years he has settled into adulthood quite well playing with indie folk darlings Fleet Foxes prior to their untimely breakup as well as The Cave Singers. While he certainly sounds beautiful on the flute as seen in the above video, we were still beyond stoked to catch him rock out again with The Blood Brothers during last year's reunion set at FYF Fest.\n\nPortugal The Man. - Kyle O' Quin of Gatsby's American Dream and The Rest Of The Band From Anatomy Of A Ghost\n\nGatsby's American Dream were one of the most interesting and intelligent Emo bands from Seattle and Anatomy of a Ghost were probably the only notable screamo/post-hardcore from Alaska but it wasn't until nearly a decade later with Portugal. The Man that some of the members finally hit it big. That being said, Portugal. The Man was not an overnight success, the band actually formed out of the ashes of Anatomy of a Ghost a little over ten years ago. Even though it took awhile we couldn't be happier for these guys and their recent set at Shaun White's Air + Style festival was definitely a highlight of the weekend.\n\nLieutenant and Foo Fighters - Nate Mendel Of Sunny Day Real Estate\n\nNate Mendel's list of musical accomplishments is somewhat out of this world. Not only is he the founding bassist of the legendary 90s emo band Sunny Day Real Estate he was also the founding bassist of a little band called The Foo Fighters who you might have heard a little bit about. If this all wasn't enough he has also recently found some more indie rock success with his new project Lieutenant who are headlining the Troubadour this month.\n\nBlood Orange - Dev Hynes of Test Icicles and Lightspeed Champion\n\nOne of our favorite records of 2014 was definitely Cupid Deluxe by Blood Orange, its echoes of 90s R&B, Prince, and early 2000s British Hip-Hop were an unstoppable force on both the summer festival circuit and the College Radio charts. Long before all of his success as Blood Orange Dev Hynes fronted to amazing bands with some seriously emo tendencies. The first was Test Icicles a band who sounded like Bloc Party jamming with the Blood Brothers at a thrash metal show and the second was the Bright Eyes influenced Lightspeed Champion. Both bands found great success on Domino Records, but never quite connected the way with American audiences that Blood Orange has."
