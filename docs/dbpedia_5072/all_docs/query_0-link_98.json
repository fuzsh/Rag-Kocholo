        "text": "Luke O’Neil knows two things: whiskey and emo.\n\nAlright, alright, he also knows a lot about Morrissey, cocktails and just how awful the internet can be. But he really knows whiskey and emo. You can find both at his Sinclair party tomorrow night — the monthly night's first move into the big room.\n\nThe second Emo Night Boston hosts Weezer tribute act Tired of Sex (doing “Pinkerton” in its entirety) and White Belts (doing emo’s greatest hits and deep cuts). Tickets are only $3 and you can get them here.\n\nTo get you in the mood to argue what is and isn’t emo, I hashed out a few details with O’Neil.\n\nGuestlisted: I consider \"Pinkerton\" to be the quintessential emo album. Besides being nearly perfect, it defines the genre, the aesthetic. But if feel like I'm in the minority. Don't emo kids love \"The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most\" or \"Bleed American\" or some other trifle more?\n\nLuke O’Neil: Well, \"Pinkerton\" is sort of a curious case. It's definitely not the first wave of emo, as you'd have to go back to the '80s with the first post-hardcore bands. And then there were other bands in the early \"90s, like Sunny Day Real Estate and Jawbreaker that sort of made up the first crossover wave of emo bands. But \"Pinkerton\" and Weezer in general were undeniably a huge influence on all of the successive generations of emo and pop-punk bands that have come along since then. I agree it's perfect, and a lot of what we commonly call emo exists in its DNA. That said, \"emo\" is sort of a loose term and a lot of people don't agree on what it means. I take a pretty broad view of it. Everything from the seminal early '90s stuff to cheesy pop mallcore metal emo is fine by me. Also, don't you dare talk that way about Dashboard!\n\nI like to hear you say that. Well, not that part about Dashboard, who is fine but not my favorite. I feel like by the late ‘90s emo and pop punk and power pop just oozed into the same thing. Yes, Jimmy Eat World was better than Good Charlotte but they were too close. I’m more in to the end of first wave/beginning of second wave camp with Sunny Day Real Estate. Does that make me normal emo or extra weird emo?\n\nI think, being a 30-something man, that puts you in exactly the sort of emo-appreciation bracket one might expect. Good Charlotte is not emo, even by my big tent definition however Jimmy Eat World, especially on their earlier records, was the epitome of emo. Particularly on \"Static Prevails,\" listen to the song \"Call It In the Air.\" That to me is what I think of as platonic emo.\n\nOK, sounds like I need to do some homework. We know what Weezer tribute Tired of Sex will be playing, what kind of emo hits would you like to hear from White Belts? What’s your perfect handful of songs?\n\nI don't want to give away their setlist, because I think people are going to be amazed by the stuff they're playing, but there is a broad spectrum, from earlier stuff like Texas Is the Reason, to more populist stuff like Taking Back Sunday. I didn't have anything to do with picking their set but it basically sounds like what we play at Emo Night already, more formative bands mixed in with singalong hits.\n\nNice. And you'll do a song or two?\n\n(Laughs) White Belts very kindly offered to have me do a number or two, but I didn't want to distract the attention from them with my immense vocal presence. I'll stick to my occasional Morrissey tribute band these days.\n\nI think everyone will find that very disappointing, but I understand."
