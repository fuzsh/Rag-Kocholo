        "text": "About Unconscious Bias\n\nVideo Url\n\nRenee Navarro, PharmD, MD, Vice Chancellor, Diversity and Outreach welcomes you to UCSF's initiative to address unconscious bias. ( Read the transcript. )\n\nBias is a prejudice in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another usually in a way that's considered to be unfair. Biases may be held by an individual, group, or institution and can have negative or positive consequences. There are types of biases 1. Conscious bias (also known as explicit bias) and 2. Unconscious bias (also known as implicit bias)\n\nIt is important to note that biases, conscious or unconscious, are not limited to ethnicity and race. Though racial bias and discrimination are well documented, biases may exist toward any social group. One's age, gender, gender identity physical abilities, religion, sexual orientation, weight, and many other characteristics are subject to bias.\n\nUnconscious biases are social stereotypes about certain groups of people that individuals form outside their own conscious awareness. Everyone holds unconscious beliefs about various social and identity groups, and these biases stem from one's tendency to organize social worlds by categorizing.\n\nUnconscious bias is far more prevalent than conscious prejudice and often incompatible with one's conscious values. Certain scenarios can activate unconscious attitudes and beliefs. For example, biases may be more prevalent when multi-tasking or working under time pressure.\n\nVideo Url\n\nKizza Chadiha, MEPN, Program Coordinator, Office of the Dean, School of Nursing on the science of unconscious bias. (Transcript)\n\nOver the last three decades, our understanding of unconscious bias has evolved. The nature of unconscious bias is well understood, and an instrument (Implicit Association Test) to assess unconscious bias has been developed and rigorously tested.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nUnconscious biases develop at an early age: biases emerge during middle childhood and appear to develop across childhood (Dore, 2014).\n\nUnconscious biases have real world effects on behavior (Dasgupta, 2004).\n\nUnconscious biases are malleable-one can take steps to minimize the impact of unconscious bias (Dasgupta, 2013; Dasgupta & Greenwald, 2013).\n\nA substantial amount of research has been published demonstrating impact of unconscious bias in various domains including the criminal justice system, education, and health/health care (Kirwan Institute, 2014). Bias may have an impact on: hiring, and mentoring and may contribute to healthcare disparities.\n\nVideo Url\n\nRene Salazar, MD, Professor of Clinical Medicine and Director of Diversity, Graduate Medical Education on the impact of unconscious bias. (Transcript)\n\nFor example:\n\nFictitious resumes with White-sounding names sent to help-wanted ads were more likely to receive callbacks for interviews compared to resumes with African-American sounding names. Resumes with White-sounding names received 50% more callbacks for interviews (Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2004).\n\nScience faculty rated male applicants for a laboratory manager position as significantly more competent and hireable than female applicants. Faculty also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant (Moss-Racusin et al, 2012).\n\nAmong mentored career K08 or K23 recipients – mean salary of female researchers was about $31,000 less than males (Jagsi et al., 2013).\n\nImplicit bias among health care professionals can influence their behaviors and judgments (Stone & Moskowitz, 2011).\n\nSince 1997, more than 30 studies have been published relevant to unconscious bias and clinical decision-making. Racial bias is prevalent among healthcare providers and it appears that race influences medical decision making of healthcare providers (Paradies, 2013).\n\nVideo Url\n\nTeresa Scherzer, PhD, MSW, Academic Programs Evaluator, Office of the Dean, School of Nursing on strategies to assess unconscious bias. (Transcript)\n\nFor many years, scientists have been working on instruments to assess unconscious bias (also known as implicit associations). Of the various tools that are available, the Implicit Association Test (IAT) is one of the most popular and well-studies. The IAT was developed as part of a project to detect unconscious bias based on several factors including race, gender, sexual orientation and national origin. It was developed as part of Project Implicit, which blends basic research and educational outreach in a virtual laboratory that allows users to exam one's own hidden biases and understand stereotypes that exist below one's conscious awareness. Project Implicit comprises a network of laboratories, technicians, and research scientists at Harvard University, the University of Washington and the University of Virginia.\n\nHow does the IAT work?\n\nThe IAT measures the relative strength of associations between pairs of concepts. It is designed as a sorting task in which individuals are asked to sort images or words that appear on a computer screen into one of two categories. The basic premise is that when two concepts are highly correlated, people are able to pair those concepts more quickly than two concepts that are not well associated. The IAT is relatively resistant to social desirability concern, and the reliability and validity have been rigorously tested.\n\nHow is the IAT used?\n\nThe IAT is powerful instrument, which has been used to explore the impact of unconscious bias on behavior. Here are some examples highlighting the use of the IAT in healthcare.\n\nA greater pro-White bias (measured using the IAT) among physicians resulted in an increased likelihood of prescribing thrombolytics for White patients compared to Blacks presenting with acute coronary syndrome (Green, 2007).\n\nA greater pro-White bias (measured using the IAT) was associated with a greater inclination to prescribe pain medications for White versus Black children (Sabin, 2012).\n\nGreater pro-White bias (measured using the IAT) was associated with poorer ratings of interpersonal care among Black patients (Cooper, 2012).\n\nBertrand, M, Mullainathan, S.
