        "text": "Though there’s no agreed-upon dictionary definition for the best solar perfumes or set ingredient list that clearly defines the genre, they’re often categorized as sun-inspired fragrances that boost your spirits by way of cheerful notes like vanilla, amber, tropical florals, citrus, and coconut that evoke sun-drenched skin and long days spent sprawled out on a beach. What’s more inspiring and mood-lifting than a desktop-worthy escape in the depths of winter, after all, or in the middle of a long block of Zoom meetings?\n\nUnsurprisingly, perfumes with strong vacation energy make ideal summer scents, but they’re also perennial pick-me-ups on the days when sunlight is elusive and you’re tired of smelling like a log cabin. Turns out there are many ways to get your daily dose of vitamin D (figuratively speaking) via scent, thanks to a range of tropical and beachy perfumes, along with versatile slow-burners that start out bright and citrusy or sweet and floral but warm up with earthy woods and amber in the drydown. Here, some of our favorite solar perfumes that bottle up a blissful day in the sun.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nBest Floral Solar: DedCool Sunlit Blooms Eau de Parfum, $90\n\nBest Fruity Solar: Future Society Solar Canopy Eau de Parfum, $98\n\nBest Gourmand Solar: Tom Ford Soleil Blanc Eau de Parfum, $300\n\nBest Musky Solar: Phlur Solar Power Eau de Parfum, $99\n\nBest Luxe Solar OR Best Spicy Solar: The Harmonist Sun Force Eau de Parfum, $350 $245\n\nBest Fresh Solar: Ellis Brooklyn Salt Eau de Parfum, $110\n\nBest Woodsy Solar: L’Objet Cote Maquis Eau de Parfum, $160\n\nBest Citrusy Solar: Maison Francis Kurkdjian Aqua Vitae Cologne Forte Eau de Parfum, $240\n\nBest Powdery Solar: Courrèges Colorama l'Eau De Liesse Eau de Parfum, $135\n\nBest Floral Solar: DedCool Sunlit Blooms Eau de Parfum\n\nDedcool\n\nSunlit Blooms Eau de Parfum\n\nWhy it's worth it: Dedcool's Sunlit Blooms perfects the recipe for a smashing summer scent with delicate notes of white florals cut with salt and acid (courtesy of a squeeze of orange). “This fragrance is hazy without erring on nauseating, and adding salted vanilla was a genius savory twist on the trending gourmand note,” commerce writer Jen Hussein says. “It’s exactly how I want my summer to smell: sweet, warm, with just a hint of sweat.”\n\nKey notes: orange blossom, white florals, and salted vanilla | Sizes: 0.5 ounces, 1.7 ounces\n\nBest Fruity Solar: Future Society Solar Canopy Eau de Parfum\n\nFuture Society\n\nSolar Canopy Eau de Parfum\n\nWhy It's Worth It: Many solar fragrances evoke beach air and salty skin, but Future Society’s Solar Canopy is more about two living things that thrive under the glow of the sun: fruits and flowers. Associate beauty director Sarah Kinonen says the scent—brightened by lychee, pink sugar, and pistachio—is “floral and sweet, yet zesty, and definitely catches the attention of others.” Normally, she layers fragrances, but since this one is so attention-grabbing, she emphasizes, “It begs to be worn solo.”\n\nKey notes: Turkish rose, magnolia, lychee, pistachio, and pink sugar | Sizes: 1.6 ounces\n\nBest Gourmand Solar: Tom Ford Soleil Blanc Eau de Parfum\n\nWhy It's Worth It: This former Best of Beauty Award winner is like a sexy romp at the cabana, with familiar notes of creamy coconut and tonka bean that many scenthounds compare to a luxurious sunscreen. Cardamom and pink pepper bring the spice, while ylang ylang layers in creaminess for a sensual perfume that provides the same kind of liquid confidence as a boozy island cocktail or two.\n\nKey notes: coco de mer, ylang ylang, and cardamom | Sizes: 0.3 ounces, 1 ounce, 1.7 ounces, and 3.4 ounces\n\nBest Musky Solar: Phlur Solar Power Eau de Parfum\n\nWhy It's Worth It: Inspired by sunkissed skin, Phlur’s refreshing, bergamot-infused Solar Power hit all the right citrusy, floral notes to win over our Best of Beauty Award judges last year. “It blends with your body chemistry for a pleasant musky scent,\" senior editor Jesa Marie Calaor previously said, adding that she gets compliments every time she wears it out.”\n\nKey notes: bergamot, orange flower, and solar musk | Available Sizes: 0.33 ounces, 1.7 ounces\n\nBest Spicy Solar: The Harmonist Sun Force Eau de Parfum\n\nThe Harmonist\n\nThe Harmonist Sun Force Eau de Parfum\n\nWhy It's Worth It: This elevated perfume, packaged in a bottle that resembles liquid gold, feels like a celebration of a sun goddess. Spicy notes of cardamom and saffron combine with honey and vanilla-esque benzoin to give it a syrupy richness as if you’re closing in on a warm cardamom bun fresh out of the oven. Meanwhile, the incense and sandalwood let you know you’re in for a near-religious experience whenever you spritz this indulgent scent.\n\nKey notes: Hawaiian pomelo, Bulgarian rose, cardamom, incense, sandalwood, and musk | Sizes: 1.69 ounces\n\nBest Fresh Solar: Ellis Brooklyn Salt Eau de Parfum\n\nWhy It's Worth It: Salt is the stuff of sunkissed skin, briny ocean water, and umami seasonings, but it also makes for a brilliant summer perfume. This Best of Beauty Award-winning scent of the same name bottles up the clarity you feel after a brisk dip in the ocean, combining the natural beauty of the great outdoors with all the mineral saltiness of the sea in one fresh, clean, invigorating scent. And just trust us on this: It smells even better when you’re slicked with sweat.\n\nKey notes: ylang ylang, Tahitian tiare, and ambergris | Sizes: 0.34 ounces, 1.7 ounces, and 3.4 ounces\n\nBest Woodsy Solar: L’Objet Cote Maquis Eau de Parfum\n\nWhy It's Worth It: L’Objet’s Cote Maquis smells like a sacred beach ceremony (or long lost cousin to Jo Malone’s beloved Wood Sage and Sea Salt), anchored by mineral notes and earthy cashmere wood. It’s this writer’s favorite summer scent of all time, one that’s light enough that you can wear it like a secret and only lingers for a few hours. Still, the incense and musky labdanum notes are so otherworldly and special that you’ll want to spritz it on repeat well after Labor Day.\n\nKey notes: incense, cashmere wood, and labdanum | Sizes: 3.3 ounces\n\nBest Citrusy Solar: Maison Francis Kurkdjian Aqua Vitae Cologne Forte Eau de Parfum\n\nMaison Francis Kurkdjian\n\nAqua Vitae Cologne Forte Eau de Parfum\n\nWhy It's Worth It: This former Best of Beauty Award winner is a multifaceted perfume that we’ve called “practically prismatic” for its mercurial qualities (refreshing and citrusy one moment, musky and woody another). The solar notes in it give it a warmth and hopefulness that live up to its sun-kissed packaging: Think of wearing it like the first euphoric days of sun after a harsh winter.\n\nKey notes: bergamot, mandarin, solar floral accord, and musk accord | Sizes: 1.1 ounces, 2.4 ounces, and 6.8 ounces\n\nBest Powdery Solar: Courrèges Colorama l'Eau De Liesse Eau de Parfum\n\nCourrèges\n\nColorama l'Eau De Liesse Eau de Parfum\n\nWhy It's Worth It: Courreges’ Colorama l’Eau de Liesse is a delightfully powdery take on sunshine and flowers. It smells faintly of jasmine, but with a nostalgic nuttiness and sweetness to it that resembles a sepia-toned memory of a well-loved dessert (so it’s practically Proustian). As a lighter fragrance, it fades after a few hours, but it feels on brand for a scent that seems to celebrate the ephemeral.\n\nKey notes: almond, neroli, jasmine sambac, heliotrope, and vanilla | Sizes: 1.7 ounces, 3.4 ounces\n\nMore solar perfumes we love:\n\nArquiste Parfumeur Sydney Rock Pool Eau de Parfum\n\nArquiste Parfumeur\n\nSydney Rock Pool Eau de Parfum\n\nWhy It's Worth It: The beaches of Sydney played muse to L’Arquiste perfumer Rodrigo Flores-Roux when he crafted this complex aquatic scent layered with sun, salt, driftwood, seaweed, and minerals. It opens with coconut and white florals that smell pleasantly summery—but unlike SPF—and dry down to warm, earthy notes of amber and sandalwood that evoke a day basking in the sun.\n\nKey Notes: mineral accord, driftwood accord, ambermax, sea salt accord, Australian sandalwood, and coconut skin accord | Sizes: 3.38 ounces\n\nByredo Sundazed Eau de Parfum\n\nWhy It's Worth It: Cotton candy is the outlier in this citrusy fever dream that sets it apart from other solar scents of its kind. It has a soapiness to it that many people compare to detergent, but the saccharine quality of the candy also feels like a rush of adrenaline or dopamine that captures the excitement of hurtling down an amusement park ride, wisps of sugar dissolving in your mouth, or a sunset date on the boardwalk going just right.\n\nKey notes: mandarin, lemon, neroli, jasmine sambac, cotton candy, and musk | Sizes: 1.7 ounces\n\nL'Artisan Perfumer Soleil de Provence Eau de Parfum\n\nL'Artisan Parfumeur\n\nSoleil de Provence Eau de Parfum\n\nWhy It's Worth It: Unlike its ocean-inspired peers, Soleil de Provence pays tribute to the French countryside and the mimosa, an orange flower that blooms there in high summer. Bright bursts of lemon and bergamot are your first introduction to this cheerful, uplifting scent, which take their time harmonizing with vanilla and benzoin on the drydown. It’s a scent that feels like pure optimism, or the warm and fuzzy beginnings of a summer romance.\n\nKey notes: bergamot, ylang-ylang, mimosa, lemon, and vanilla | Sizes: 3.4 ounces\n\nLoewe Solo Ella Eau de Parfum\n\nLoewe\n\nSolo Ella Eau de Parfum\n\nWhy It's Worth It: Loewe’s Sola Ella belongs to a fragrance family inspired by sunsets and energized by contrasts, like the day fading into night. As a result, this scent opens up with juicy, tropical notes of passionfruit and dragonfruit that eventually give way to musky amber and sandalwood. It’s a fun, summery scent that transports you somewhere tropical like you’re sipping mai tais on a beach set to the backdrop of a truly epic sunset.\n\nKey notes: passionfruit, dragon fruit, cotton candy, musk, amber, vanilla, and sandalwood | Sizes: 0.34 ounces, 1.7 ounces\n\nTrudon Isla Eau de Parfum\n\nWhy It's Worth It: As its name (and sun-dappled bottle) suggests, Trudon’s Isla is an ode to easy island living, with bergamot-forward heart notes that practically radiate on your skin and garnishes of mint and rosemary that allude to the Mediterranean coast. It goes on strong and lasts long into the day, but if it feels too overpowering on your skin, try spritzing it as a room spray instead.\n\nKey notes: musk, bergamot, mint, cardamom, vetiver, and grapefruit | Sizes: 3.4 ounces\n\n27 87 Hamaca Eau de Parfum\n\n27 87\n\nHamaca Eau de Parfum\n\nWhy It's Worth It: Hamaca is what you get when you raid the frozen dessert aisle en route to the beach, or down one too many vanilla coconut puddings on a hot summer night. The scent smells like pure indulgence—at once intoxicatingly sugary and woody—leaving a heady trail of delectable gourmand notes in its wake after just one spray.\n\nKey notes: tonka bean, coconut, vanilla, and sandalwood | Sizes: 0.91 ounces, 2.94 ounces\n\nReady, set, spritz.
