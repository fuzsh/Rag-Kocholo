        "text": "Retro-Inspired Sounds are making a Rock Music Comeback\n\nEverything old is new again in the world of rock music. From ‘80s-inspired synth-pop to ‘90s-era hip-hop beats, retro sounds are making a major comeback. This is especially true in the Rock genre. 90% of the tracks we are considering for our shows are inspired heavily by the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s. What we look for at AVA Live Radio is rock music that steps outside of the usual. A spectacular range, grand guitar solo, vibrant harmonies, energetic drums or cultural percussion are all elements being scene in todays rock stars. This return to big rock ballads and charged up musical displays are sweetening the pot. Let’s hope it lasts this time.\n\nEmo is one Music Trend that I’m hearing lately in music submissions and I have to say it’s about time. It’s great to see this sub-genre reemerging among new creators.\n\nWhat Is Emo Music?\n\nEmo music is a subgenre of punk rock, indie rock, and alternative rock music defined by its heavy emotional expression. Emo is part of the post-hardcore band scene, with artists delving into songs with more substance and feeling.\n\nEMO rock became popular in the early 2000s, but we’re seeing a resurgence of this genre with a modern twist in 2023. Emotional lyrics, heavy guitar riffs, and screaming vocals are making a comeback in rock music.\n\nMore and more bands are also incorporating electronic elements into their sound. We can expect to see emo-inspired rock music making a major impact on the scene in May 2023. It’s going to be an exciting month for rock music fans!\n\nRock bands known for their EMO influence are also gaining popularity once again. Bands like My Chemical Romance, Dashboard Confessional, and Taking Back Sunday are being rediscovered by younger generations, while also maintaining a loyal fan base from their prime in the early 2000s.\n\nThe fusion of traditional rock instruments with electronic elements creates a fresh and dynamic sound that is sure to leave a lasting impact. It’s exciting to see the evolution of emo rock and its impact on the current music scene.\n\nTune in daily for Jacqueline Jax on AVA Live Radio\n\nI’ve just added EMO inspired rock tracks just discovered to our Rock Rising Playlist.
