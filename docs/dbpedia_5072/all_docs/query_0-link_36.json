        "text": "23 - 02.19.17\n\nArtist: Relient K\n\nAlbum: Collapsible Lung\n\nGenre: Pop/Rock\n\nRelease: 2013\n\nRating: 2/5\n\nMan, remember the controversy this album caused? After being dormant for a couple years, Relient K released this album to extremely varied reception. People thought it was too pop. It wasn’t Christian enough. It wasn’t as creative as previous Relient K efforts.\n\nSome of those criticisms are valid, I think. Musically, most of the songs aren’t that good or interesting. Lyrically, Matt Thiessen seems more concerned with having fun with his writing buddies than making a great album. It’s not all a loss, though. “Don’t Blink” and “Collapsible Lung” are two of the best Relient K tracks ever written. “Lost Boy” and “PTL” are two fun little pop jams. However, a lot of the album just feels very lackluster and dull. Now granted, Relient K was essentially falling apart at this point. The band went from a quintet to just Matt and Matt seemingly overnight. I’m sure that had an effect on it.\n\nFavorite tracks: “Don’t Blink,” “PTL,” “Collapsible Lung”\n\nThis is not the best Relient K album. It’s a bit dull, save for the tracks mentioned here. Honestly, you could probably just pick those up and be perfectly happy. (And then go listen to Air For Free.)\n\n22. - 02.17.17\n\nArtist: Arctic Monkeys\n\nAlbum: Favourite Worst Nightmare\n\nGenre: Indie Rock\n\nRelease: 2007\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nI’m sorry for three 4/5 reviews in a row, but I was on a roll on the 17th, I guess. Arctic Monkeys really need no introduction. Anyone who listens to indie rock at all has heard these guys.\n\nThis album doesn’t sound 10 years old at all. Heck, it sounds like something a garage band uploaded to Bandcamp two months ago, except it’s better-written and performed well. It’s hard not to fall head over heels for the bouncy, fuzzy guitars and the 70s-sounding drums. One thing this band does especially well here is write bass lines. The bass drives all these songs to the next level. Lyrically, it’s a pretty goofy album. You can tell Alex Turner thinks about sex like… a lot. That’s the main topic of nearly every song. However, you can barely here what he’s saying through his accent and all the warm distortion on the vocals. Just don’t look up the lyrics if you’re squeamish.\n\nFavorites: “D is for Dangerous,” “Fluorescent Adolescent,” “This House Is A Circus,” “505″\n\nAn indie rock classic, “Favourite Worst Nightmare” is a fun album to check out.\n\n21. 02.17.17\n\nArtist: Ivoryline\n\nAlbum: There Came A Lion\n\nGenre: Rock\n\nRelease: 2008\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nI never listened to Ivoryline when they were active. A couple years back, a friend gave me a couple of their records and this was one of them. Honestly, I hadn’t even really put them on until now. And I regret it.\n\n“There Came A Lion” totally sounds like a record from 2008. It shows it’s age, but in a charming, nostalgic way. It’s not in a cringe-inducing way like “Someday Came Suddenly.” This record will definitely call to mind comparisons to Anberlin or even some Emery. The lyrics on this record are fantastic. There’s not a bad line on here. The musicianship is also very good. The punk-influenced guitars are fantastic and ripping. You can tell the songs were written to be be performed live. Listening to this album will make you wish Ivoryline was still active.\n\nFavorite tracks: “Parade,” “Remind Me I’m Alive,” “The Last Words”\n\nIf you want a nostalgia trip to the days of Lifefest, SonShine Festival, or Purple Door, or just want some mid-00s rock, definitely check this one out.\n\n20. - 02.17.17\n\nArtist: LEAGUES\n\nAlbum: You Belong Here\n\nGenre: Indie Rock\n\nRelease: 2013\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nI can’t believe this record is already four years old. It still sticks out as fresh in my mind. I remember my junior year of high school, when “Spotlight” would allllllwayyys be playing on RadioU. Four years later, and I’m still listening to a lot of the songs on this record pretty regularly.\n\n“You Belong Here” is a fun album from start to finish. It’s bouncy and upbeat, saturated in reverb and dance-rock beats. Thad Cockrell’s high falsetto carries the snappy lyrics over waves of synths and guitars. This album is truly a piece of its time, when jangly, reverb-drenched music was all the rage with indie, hipster crowd. The 60s influence on here is heeeavvvvyyyy. That said, it’s very neatly produced (Paul Moak- dude is killer) and a joy to listen to.\n\nFavorite tracks: “Haunted,” “Walking Backwards,” “Friendly Fire”\n\nOne of my personal favorite indie rock albums from the last few years, definitely listen to “You Belong Here.”\n\n19. - 02.17.17\n\nArtist: Falling Up\n\nAlbum: Dawn Escapes\n\nGenre: Rock\n\nRelease: 2005\n\nRating: 3/5\n\nFalling Up was such an enigma of a band. Remembered (Okay, their last album’s only like a year old.) as a band who truly never cared what people thought of them, Falling Up solidified their place in music as the ultimate storytelling-indie rock band.\n\nBut this album’s not an indie rock album. And it doesn’t really have a story. Back when they first started, Falling Up was a straight-up hard rock band for a couple albums. This is their second release, Dawn Escapes. While it’s different, it’s by no means bad. There are a lot of songs I really love on here. The opener, “Searchlights” is super catchy with a lot of great guitar work. “Exhibition” has a killer piano line. Fan-favorite “Moonlit” is another catchy gem. The reason that I only gave this album a 3/5 is because I know Falling Up’s discography only gets better from here. The music and Jessy Ribordy’s vocals on this record don’t really mesh like they do on later albums. These songs tend to blur together, unlike later albums. This is a good album, but it all gets better from here.\n\nFavorite tracks: “Searchlights,” “Moonlit,” “Meridians,” “Lights of Reedsport.”\n\nIf you want to listen to all of Falling Up’s music, make sure you hear where they started from. Or listen to this one if you want a pretty solid hard rock album.\n\n18. - 02.17.17\n\nArtist: Paramore\n\nAlbum: All We Know Is Falling\n\nGenre: Pop-Punk / Rock\n\nRelease: 2005\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nI’m ashamed to say it, but before today, I had never heard this album in its entirety. I know. Where have I been for the past 12 years? Missing out, that’s where.\n\n“All We Know Is Falling” is a great debut album from then-new band, Paramore. It features some of the most musically-heavy moments in the band’s discography. There’s even some screaming. There’s also some great lyrics on “All We Know,” “Emergency,” and “Conspiracy.” The only song I can say I dislike is “Woah.” That’s the only one that falls remotely flat.\n\nFavorite tracks: “Pressure,” “Emergency,” “Conspiracy,” “My Heart”\n\nIt’s always interesting to see where a band started, and even if that’s not your main objective in listening, “All We Know…” is a solid album to check out.\n\n17. 02-17-17\n\nArtist: Owl City\n\nAlbum: Ocean Eyes (Deluxe Edition)\n\nGenre: Pop\n\nRelease: 2009\n\nRating: 5/5\n\nI am now officially one week into this listening adventure, so to celebrate, I thought it would be fun to listen to one of the albums that’s been most important to my life. Before “Ocean Eyes,” all I listened to was ska and Christian pop-punk and thought anyone who listened to pop music was a loser.\n\nThanks, Owl City for proving me wrong.\n\nThere aren’t many records like “Ocean Eyes.” Even within the Owl City catalogue, there’s nothing quite like it. Adam Young’s quirky lyrics and creative synth work paint a sonic picture unlike anything else. The songs on this record are that special kind of catchy, where they stick in your head for days on end. “Hello Seattle” and, of course, “Fireflies” will be running through your head for a solid week after you first hear them. The sonic textures of “Cave In” and “On the Wing” will take you places without you ever getting up. The bonus tracks are worth mentioning too. The “Hello Seattle” remix is still one of my all-time favorite Owl City tracks, as is “Strawberry Avalanche.”\n\nFavorite tracks: Look, if you haven’t already guessed that I love all the tracks on this album, you should go find another blog to read. I love this album and I love all of it.\n\n“Ocean Eyes” is incredibly easy to recommend. Granted you’ve probably already heard it (”Fireflies” went like 3x Platinum), it’s definitely worth revisiting.\n\n16. - 02.15.17\n\nArtist: Adam Young\n\nAlbum: Corduroy Road\n\nGenre: Soundtrack\n\nRelease: 2016\n\nRating: 3/5\n\nAdam Young’s “Scores” project resulted in a lot of interesting albums. Some of them were very different from the music many have come to expect from him. “Corduroy Road” was teased as a folk/country driven experience and that’s exactly what we got.\n\nYoung primarily sticks with acoustic guitars and pianos on this project. It’s very simple and relaxed, compared to several of his other scores. One thing I found interesting about this record were his drum samples. Young has demonstrated that few of his “drums” are really drums. You can hear the variation in each stomp and clap, giving the songs a very raw, organic feel. Young also puts his voice on some of the songs, singing some “woah’s” and reciting Scripture.\n\nFavorite tracks: “Georgia Boys,” “Sherman” “Country Hymn”\n\nNot the most spectacular of Young’s “Scores,” but by no means bad, “Corduroy Road” is an enjoyable listen.\n\n15. - 02.15.17\n\nArtist: The All-About\n\nAlbum: Suburban Heart\n\nGenre: Indie Pop\n\nRelease: 2013\n\nRating 5/5\n\nThis is another one of my “Noisetrade” bands. When I was a junior/senior in high school, I would mass download releases from Noisetrade and then put them on my iPod Nano (4th gen. the blue one) and listen through them on trips.\n\nThis is my favorite road trip album of all time. Everything about this album screams “summer” to me. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve fallen asleep to this one. “Suburban Heart” is a genuinely beautiful piece of indie pop. Zach Coe’s rough recording and masterful melodies give the record an incredibly personal touch that you just can’t find anywhere else.\n\nFavorite tracks: “Nashville,” “Summer Sheets,” “Jessie,” “Heat Wave,” “Peregrine”\n\nA beautiful mix between Owl City and Death Cab For Cutie, there’s a little something for everyone on “Suburban Heart.” You can download this album for free (with a beautiful PDF comic) so what are you waiting for?\n\n14. 02.15.17\n\nArtist: The Front Bottoms\n\nAlbum: I Hate My Friends\n\nGenre: Emo\n\nRelease: 2008\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nI honestly expected to hate this album. In fact, I kind of wanted to. The Front Bottoms have gotten huge in the last couple years, and I wanted to be one of the cool kids who hated them. However, they proved me wrong.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, this is a pretty stupid album. However, it’s self-aware in its stupidity. Every song is whiny and nihilistic, but to the point of it being fun to listen to. Brian Sella whines about everything under the sun. Girls. Money. His friends. Beer. It’s all there. But it’s almost charming in an indie B-movie sort of way. The instrumentals are sloppy and unpolished. The editing is choppy and by pop standards, bad. But that’s where the album’s charm comes from. It’s supposed to sound corny and goofy. It’s relatable.\n\nFavorite tracks: “Lipstick Covered Magnet,” “Pale Beneath the Sun,” “Twelve Feet Deep.”\n\nIf you’re in the mood for some goofy, lazy emo, definitely try this album. It’s crappy, but in the right ways."
