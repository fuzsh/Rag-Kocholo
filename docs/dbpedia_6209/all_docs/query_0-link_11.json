He was born ‘late in the fifth century in the city of Caesarea in Palestine. As to his _ education and early years we are not informed, but we know that he studied to fit himself for the legal profession. He came as a young man to Constaniti- nople, and seems to have made his mark immediately. For as early as the year 527 he was appointed legal , adviser and private secretary! to Belisarius, then a very young man who had been serving on the staff of the general Justinian, and had only recently been advanced to the office of general. Shortly after this Justinian was called by his uncle Justinus to share the throne of the Roman Empire, and four months later Justinus died, leaving Justinian sole emperor of the Romans. Thus the stage was set for the scenes which are presented in the pages of Procopius. His own activity continued till well nigh 1 tiuBovados, Proc. Bell. 1. xii. 24. He is elsewhere referred to as mapedpos or broypadeds. Vii INTRODUCTION the end of Justinian’s life, and he seems to have outlived his hero, Belisarius. During the eventful years of Belisarius’ cam- paigning in Africa, in Italy, and in the East, Procopius was moving about with him and was an eye-witness of the events he describes in his writings. In 527 we find him in Mesopotamia; in 533 he accompanied Belisarius to Africa; and in 536 he _ journeyed with him to Italy. He was therefore ‘ quite correct in the assertion which he makes rather modestly in the introduction of his history, that he was better qualified than anyone else to write the history of that period. Besides his intimacy with Belisarius it should be added that his position gave him the further advantage of a certain standing at the imperial court in Constantinople, and brought him the acquaintance of many of the lead- ing men of his day. Thus we have the testimony of one intimately associated with the administration, and this, together with the importance of the events through which he lived, makes his record exceedingly interesting as well as historically important. One must admit that his position was not one to encourage impartiality in his presentation of facts, and that the imperial favour was not won by plain speaking ; nevertheless we have before us a man who could not obliterate himself enough to play the abject flatterer always, and he gives us the reverse, too, of his brilliant picture, as we shall see presently. Procopius’ three works give us a fairly complete vill INTRODUCTION account of the reign of Justinian up till near the year 560 a.p., and he has done us the favour of setting forth three different points of view which vary so widely that posterity has sometimes found it difficult to reconcile them. His greatest work, as well as his earliest, is the History of the Wars, in eight books. The material is not arranged strictly according to chronological sequence, but so that the progress of events may be traced separately in each one of three wars. Thus the first two books are given over to the Persian wars, the next two contain the account of the war waged against the Vandals in Africa, the three following describe the struggle against the Goths in Italy. These seven books were published together first, and the eighth book was added later as a supplement to bring the history up to about the date of 554, being a general account of events in different parts of the empire. It is mecessary to bear in mind that the wars described separately by Procopius overlapped one another in time, and that while the Romans were striving to hold back the Persian aggressor they were also maintaining armies in Africa and in Italy. In fact the Byzantine empire was making a supreme effort to re-establish the old boundaries, and to reclaim the territories lost to the barbarian nations. The emperor Justinian was fired by the ambition to make the Roman Empire once more a world power, and he drained every resource in his eagerness to make possible the fulfilment of this dream. It was ix INTRODUCTION a splendid effort, but it was doomed to failure; the fallen edifice could not be permanently restored. The history is more general than the title would imply, and all the important events of the time are touched upon. So while we read much of the cam- paigns against the nations who were crowding back the boundaries of the old empire, we also hear of civic affairs such as the great Nika insurrection in Byzantium in 532 ; similarly a careful account is given of the pestilence of 540, and the care shown in de- scribing the nature of the disease shows plainly that the author must have had some acquaintance with the medical science of the time. After the seventh book of the History of the Wars Procopius wrote the Anecdota, or Secret History. Here he freed himself from all the restraints of respect or fear, and set down without scruple every- thing which he had been led to suppress or gloss over in the History through motives of policy. He attacks unmercifully the emperor and empress and even Belisarius and his wife Antonina, and displays to us one of the blackest pictures ever set down in writing. It is a record of wanton crime and shame- less debauchery, of intrigue and scandal- both in - public and in private life. It is plain that the thing is overdone, and the very extravagance of the calumny makes it impossible to be believed ; again and again we meet statements which, if not abso- lutely impossible, are at least highly improbable. Many of the events of the History are presented Xx i e INTRODUCTION in an entirely new light ; we seem to hear one speak- ing out of the bitterness of his heart, It should be said, at the same time, that there are very few con- tradictions in statements of fact. The author has plainly singled out the empress Theodora as the principal victim of his venomous darts, and he gives an account of her early years which is both shocking and disgusting, but which, happily, we are not forced to regard as true. It goes without saying that such a work as this could not have been published during the lifetime of the author, and it appears that it was not given to the world until after the death of Jus- tinian in 565. — Serious doubts have been entertairied in times past as to the authenticity of the Anecdota, for at first sight it seems impossible that the man who wrote in the calm tone of the History and who indulged in the fulsome praise of the panegyric On the Buildings could have also written the bitter libels of the Anecdota. It has come to be seen, however, that this feeling is not supported by any unanswerable arguments, and it is now. believed to be highly probable at least, that the Anecdota is the work of Procopius. Its bitterness may be extreme and its calumnies exaggerated beyond all reason, but it must be regarded as prompted by a reaction against the hollow life of the Byzantine court. The third work is entitled On the Buildings, and is plainly an attempt to gain favour with the emperor. We can only guess as to what the immediate occasion xi INTRODUCTION was for its composition. It is plain, however, that the publication of the History could not have aroused the enthusiasm of Justinian; there was no attempt in it to praise the emperor, and one might even read an unfavourable judgment between the lines. And it is not at all unlikely that he was moved to envy by the praises bestowed upon his general, Belisarius. At any rate the work On the Buildings is written in the empty style of the fawning flatterer. It is divided into six short books and contains an account of all the public buildings of Justinian’s reign in every district of the empire. The subject was well chosen and the material ample, and Procopius lost no opportunity of lauding his sovereign to the skies. It is an excellent example of the florid panegyric style which was, unfortunately, in great favour with the literary world of his own as well as later Byzantine times. But in spite of its faults, this work is a record of the greatest importance for the study of the period, since it is a storehouse of information concerning the internal administration of the empire. The style of Procopius is in general clear and straightforward, and shows the mind of one who endeavours to speak the truth in simple language wherever he is not under constraint to avoid it. At the same time he is not ignorant of the arts of rhetoric, and especially in the speeches he is fond of introducing sounding phrases and sententious state- ments. He was a great admirer of the classical xii kite Ree INTRODUCTION writers of prose, and their influence is everywhere apparent in his writing; in particular he is much indebted to the historians Herodotus and Thucydides, and he borrows from them many expressions and turns of phrase. But the Greek which he writes is not the pure Attic, and we find many evidences of the influence of the contemporary spoken language. Procopius writes at times as a Christian, and at times as one imbued with the ideas of the ancient religion of Greece. Doubtless his study of the classical writers led him into this, perhaps un- consciously. At any rate it seems not to have been with him a matter in which even consistency was demanded. It was politic to espouse the religion of the state, but still he often allows himself to speak as if he were a contemporary of Thucydides.

The edition is not important except as being the first. The Secret History was printed for the first time separately with a Latin translation by Alemannus, Lyon, 1623. The first complete edition was that of Maltretus, Paris, 1661-63, reprinted in Venice, 1729 ; the edition included a Latin translation of all the works, which was taken over into the edition of Procopius in the Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae by Dindorf, Bonn, 1833-38. Two editions of recent years are to be mentioned: Domenico Comparetti, La Guerra Gotica di Procopio di Cesarea ; testo Greco emendato sui manoscritti con tra- duxione Italiana, Rome, 1895-98; 3 vols. Jacobus Haury, Procopii Caesariensis Opera Omnia, Leipzig, 1905-13 ; 3 vols. (Bibl. Teub.).

PROCOPIUS OF CAESAREA HISTORY OF THE WARS: BOOK I THE PERSIAN WAR I Procorius of ities has written the history of the wars which Justinian, Emperor of the Romans, _ waged against the barbarians of the East and of the West, relating separately the events of each one, to the end that the long course of time may not over- whelm deeds of singular importance through lack of a record, and thus. abandon them to oblivion and utterly obliterate them. The memory of these events he deemed would be a great thing and. most helpful to men of the present time, and to future generations as well, in case time should ever again place men under a similar stress. For men who purpose to . enter upon a war or are. preparing themselves for any kind of struggle may derive some. benefit from a narrative of a similar situation in history, inasmuch as this discloses the final result attained by men of an earlier day in a struggle of the same sort, and foreshadows, at least for those who are most prudent in planning, what outcome present events. will probably have.

It was his conviction that while cleverness is appropriate to rhetoric, and in- ventiveness to poetry, truth alone is appropriate to history. In accordance with this. principle he has not concealed the failures of even his most intimate acquaintances, but has written down with complete accuracy everything which befell those congerned, whether it happened to be done well or ill by them. It will be evident that no more important or mightier deeds are to be found in history than those which have been enacted in these wars,—provided one wishes to base his judgment on the truth. For in them more remarkable feats have been performed than in any other wars with which we are acquainted ; unless, indeed, any reader of this narrative should give the place of honour to antiquity, and consider contemporary achievements unworthy to be counted remarkable. There are those, for example, who call the soldiers of the present day “ bowmen,’’ while to those of the most ancient times they wish to ‘attribute such lofty terms as “hand-to-hand fighters,” * shield-men,’’ and other names of that sort ; and they think that the valour of those times has by no means survived to the present,—an opinion which is at once careless and wholly remote from actual experience ofthese matters. For the thought has never occurred to them that, as regards the Homeric bowmen who had the misfortune to be ridiculed by this term! derived from their art, they were neither carried by 1 Of.

HISTORY OF THE WARS, I. i. 9-15 horse nor protected by spear or shield. In. fact there was no protection at all for their bodies; they entered battle on toot, and were compelled to conceal themselves, either singling out the shield of some comrade,’ or seeking safety behind a tombstone on a mound,? from which position they could neither save themselves in case of rout, nor fall upon a flying foe. Least of all could they participate in a decisive struggle in the open, but they always seemed to be stealing something which belonged to the men who were engaged in the struggle. And apart from this they were so indifferent in their practice of archery that they drew the bowstring only to the breast,* so that the missile sent forth was naturally impotent and harmless to those whom it hit.°. Such, it is evident, was the archery of the past. But the bowmen of the present time go into battle wearing corselets and fitted out. with greaves which extend up to the knee. From the right side hang their arrows, from the other the sword. And there are some who have a spear also attached to them and, at the shoulders, a sort of small shield without a grip, such as to cover the region of the face and neck. , They are expert horsemen, and are able without difficulty to direct their bows to either side while riding at full speed, and to shoot an opponent whether in pursuit or in flight. They draw the bowstring along by the forehead about opposite» the right ear, thereby charging the arrow with such an impetus as to kill whoever stands in the way, shield and corselet alike 1 Cf.

Still there are those who take into consideration none of these things, who reverence and worship the ancient times, and give no credit to modern improvements. But no such consideration will prevent the conclusion that most great and notable deeds have been performed in these wars. And the history of them will begin at some distance back, telling of the fortunes in war of the Romans and the Medes, their reverses and their successes. II Wuen the Roman Emperor Arcadius was at the point of death in Byzantium, having a malechild, Theo- _ dosius, who was still unweaned, he felt grave fears not only for him but for the government as well, not know- ing how he should provide wisely for both. For he perceived that, if he provided a partner in govern- ment for Theodosius, he would in fact be destroying his own son by bringing forward against him a foe clothed in the regal power; while if he set him alone over the empire, many would try to mount the throne, taking advantage, as they might be expected to do, of the helplessness of the child. These men would rise against the government, and, after des- troying Theodosius, would make themselves tyrants without difficulty, since the boy had no kinsman in Byzantium .to be his guardian. For Arcadius had no hope that the boy’s uncle, Honorius, would succour him, inasmuch as the situation in Italy was already troublesome.

When Arcadius was confronted with this difficult situation, though he had not shown himself sagacious in other matters, he devised a plan which was destined to preserve without trouble both his child and his throne, either as a result of conversation with certain of the learned men, such as are usually found in numbers among the advisers of a sovereign, or from some divine inspiration which came to him. For in drawing up the writings of his will, he desig- nated the child as his successor to the throne, but ap- pointed as guardian over him Isdigerdes, the Persian King, enjoining upon him earnestly in his will to pre- serve the empire for Theodosius by all his power and foresight. So Arcadius died, having thus arranged his private affairs as well as those of the empire. But Isdigerdes, the Persian King, when he saw this writing which was duly delivered to him, being even before a sovereign whose nobility of character had won for him the greatest renown, did then display a virtue at once amazing and remarkable. For, loyally observing the behests of Arcadius, he adopted and continued without interruption a policy of profound peace with the Romans, and thus: preserved. the empire for Theodosius. Indeed, he straightway dispatched a letter to the Roman senate, not de- clining the office of guardian of the Emperor Theo- dosius, and threatening war against any who should attempt to enter into a conspiracy against him. _ When Theodosius had grown to manhood and was in the prime of life, and Isdigerdes had been taken from the world by disease, Vararanes, the Persian King, invaded the Roman domains with a mighty It 441 A.D.

This came about in the following way. Anatolius, General of the East, had, as it happened, been sent by the Emperor Theodosius as ambassador to the Persians, alone and unaccompanied; as he approached the Median army, solitary as he was, he leapt down from his horse, and advanced on foot toward. Vararanes. And when Vararanes saw him, he enquired from those who were near who this man could be who was coming forward. And they replied that he was the general of the Romans. Thereupon the king was so dumbfounded by this excessive degree of respect that he himself wheeled his horse about and rode _ away, and the whole Persian host followed: him, When he had reached his own territory, he received the envoy with great cordiality, and) granted the treaty of peace on the terms which Anatolius desired of him; one condition, however, he added, that neither party should construct any new fortification in his.own territory in the neighbourhood of. the boundary line between the two countries. When this treaty had been executed, both sovereigns then continued to administer the affairs of their respective countries as seemed best to them. Ill Ar a, later time the Persian King Perozes became involved in a war concerning boundaries with the nation of the Ephthalitae Huns, who are called White Huns, gathered an imposing army, and marched against them. The Ephthalitae are of the stock of the Huns in fact as well as in name; however they 03 PROCOPIUS OF CAESAREA Kat ovoualovtat, ov pévTor dvapiyvuvtTae % émt- yopidtovew Oivvev ticlv dv tyeis lopev, érrel oUTE Ywpav avTois Gpwopov Exovawy ovTE TH AUTO dyxiora GKNVTAL, ara mpococobar pev Tlépoaus ™pos Boppav dvepov, ov $7) Toms Topye ovo pias mpos avtais tou Tails Tepody éoxatiais éoTw, évrad0a dé rept yis opiov SiapayecOai mpds GrAjrovs cidOaciv. ov yap vopddes cioly doTrEp Ta GAra Odvvixa On, arr’ él yopas ayabAs Twos €« TmadaLod iSpuvras. tabra Tot oudé Twa éaBodny TeToinvT al TOTOTE €S ‘Popaiar THY ya bre pny Evy 7) Myjdev oTpATe. povoe dé Otvver ovTOL AeuKot TE Ta ooépara Kal ovK dpopdot Tas dafpers eioty. ov pay ovTE THY Siavray 0 OmoLoT poTrov avTois exovoty ouTe Onpiov Biov Twa amrep éxetvot Sow, anda Kal Tpos Baoiréws évos apxYovTat Kal moNTeLay évvomov ExovTes addHroLs TE Kal Tols TéXas ael dp0as Kai Sixaiwms EvpBddXrovet, ‘Pepaiov te Kal Iepody ovdéy TL hocov. ot pévTou evdalpoves » abrrois girous érarpiovrat axpe és elkoow, dv obT@ TUXOL, i TOUT@Y Telous, olmrep avrois Evpmrorae Hev €s del yivovrat, TOV dé XPN maT eov _PETEXOUTL TAVTOV, Kowns TwWoOS éEovcias avTois és tavta ovens. éevday b€ TO avTovs éerarpioapevep TENEUTHO AL EvuBain, Tov- tous 6) Tovs avpas Cavras Evy avt@ és tov Taov eoxopites Bar VO MOS. “Eri TOUTOUS TOUS ‘Eg Oariras TD Tlepofy T0- pevopevep Evprrapiy mpeaBevtys, ds 69) eTuxe pos Bacihéws Zijvevos map avrTov éoTadpévos, EvoéBios dvoya. \"EdOaritar dé Soxnow. rape- 14 Wig te MA a le A HISTORY OF THE WARS, I. iii. 2-8 do not mingle with any of the Huns known. to us, for they occupy a land neither adjoining nor even very near to them; but their, territory lies immediately to the north of Persia; indeed, their city, called Gorgo, is located over against the Persian frontier, and is consequently the centre of frequent contests concerning boundary lines between the two peoples. For they are not nomads like the other Hunnic peoples, but for a long period have been established in a goodly land. As a result of this they haye never made any incursion into the Roman territory except in company with the Median army. They are the only ones among the Huns who have white bodies and countenances which are not ugly. It is also true that their manner of living is unlike that of their kinsmen, nor do they live a savage life as they do; but they are ruled by one king, and since they possess a lawful constitution, they observe. right and justice in their dealings both with one another and with their neighbours, in no degree less. than the Romans and the Persians. Moreover, the wealthy citizens are in the habit of.attaching to themselves friends to the number of twenty or more, as the case may be, and these become permanently. their banquet-companions, and have a share in all their property, enjoying some kind of a common right in this matter. Then, when the man who has gathered such a company together comes to die, it is the custom that all these men be borne alive into the tomb with him. Perozes, marching against these Ephthalitae, was accompanied by an ambassador, Eusebius by name, who, as it happened, had been sent to his court by the Emperor Zeno.

Now as one advanced between the moun- tains to a great distance, a broad way appeared in the valley, extending apparently to an indefinite distance, but at the end it had no outlet at all, but terminated in the very midst of the circle of mountains. So Perozes, with no thought at all of treachery, and forgetting that he was marching in a hostile country, continued the pursuit without the least caution. A small body of the Huns were in flight before him, _while the greater part of their force, by concealing themselves in the rough country, got in the rear of the hostile army; but as yet they desired not to be seen by them, in order that they might advance well into the trap'and get as far as possible in among the mountains, and thus be no longer able to turn back. When the Medes began to realize all this (for they now began to have a glimmering of their peril), though they refrained from speaking of the situation themselves through fear of Perozes, yet they earn- estly entreated Eusebius to urge upon the king, who was completely ignorant of his own plight, that he should take counsel rather than make an untimely display of daring, and consider well whether there was any way of safety open to them. So he went before Perozes, but by no means revealed the | calamity which was upon them; instead he began _ with a fable, telling how a lion once happened upon a goat bound down and bleating on a mound of no very great height, and how the lion, bent upon 17] VOL.

When Perozes heard this, a fear came over him lest perchance the Medes had brought harm upon themselves by their pursuit of the enemy. He therefore advanced no further, but, remaining where he was, began to consider the situation.. By this time the Huns were following him without any concealment, and were guarding the entrance of the place in order that their enemy might no longer be able to withdraw to the rear. Then at last the Persians saw clearly in what straits they were, and they felt that the situation was desperate ; for they had no hope that they would ever escape from the peril. Then the king of the Ephthalitae sent some of his followers to Perozes ; he upbraided him at length for his senseless fool- hardiness, by which he had wantonly destroyed both himself and the Persian people, but he an- nounced that even so the Huns would grant them deliverance, if Perozes should consent to prostrate himself before him as having proved himself master, and, taking the oaths traditional among the Persians, should give pledges that they would never again take the field against the nation of the Ephthalitae. When .Perozes heard this, he held a consultation: * with the Magi. who were present. and enquired of them whether he must comply with the terms dic- tated by the enemy. s The Magi replied that, as to the oath, he should settle the matter according to 19 c 2 20 21 22 PROCOPIUS OF CAESAREA TO Erepov copia meptenBeiv TOV TrOAeMLOV. elvaL yap avrots vomov Tas Too HALou dvaronas ™poo- Kuvelv pe a éxdorn.

And they reminded him that it was the custom among the Persians to prostrate themselves before the rising sun each day ; he should, therefore, watch the time closely and meet the leader of the Ephthalitae at dawn, and then, turning toward the rising sun, make his obeisance. In this way, they explained, he would be able in the future to escape the ignominy of the deed. Perozes accordingly gave the pledges concerning the peace, and prostrated himself before his foe ex- actly as the Magi had suggested, and so, with the whole Median army intact, gladly retired homeward. IV Nor long after this, disregarding the oath he had sworn, he was eager to avenge himself upon the Huns for the insult done him, He _ therefore straightway gathered together from the whole land all the Persians and their allies, and led them against the Ephthalitae; of all his sons he left behind him only one, Cabades by name, who, as it happened, was just past the age of boyhood ; all the others, about thirty in number, he took with him. The Ephthalitae, upon learning of his invasion, were aggrieved at the deception they had suffered at the hands of their enemy, and. bitterly reproached their king as having abandoned them to the Medes. He, with a laugh, enquired of them what in the world of theirs he had abandoned, whether their land or their arms or any other part of their possessions. © They thereupon retorted that he had abandoned nothing, 2. oO 10 PROCOPIUS OF CAESAREA.

For he insisted that as yet they had received no definite information as to the invasion, for the Persians were still within their own boundaries. So, remaining where he was, he busied himself as follows. In the plain where the Persians were to make their irruption into the land of the Ephthalitae he marked off a ‘tract of very great extent and made a deep trench of sufficient width; but in the ‘centre he left'a small ‘portion of ground intact, enough to serve as a way for ten horses. » Over the trench he placed reeds, and.upon the reeds he scattered earth, thereby concealing the true-surface. He then directed the forces of the Huns that, when the time came to retire inside the. trench, they should draw themselves together into a narrow.column and pass rather slowly across this neck of land, taking care that.they should _ not fall into the ditch.!_ And he hung from the. top of the royal banner the salt over which Perozes had once sworn the oath which he had. disregarded in taking the field against the Huns. Now as long as he heard that the enemy were in their own territory, he remained at rest; but when he learned from his scouts that they had reached the city of Gorgo which lies on the extreme Persian frontier, and that departing thence they wete now advancing against his army, remaining himself with the greater part of his troops inside the trench, he sent forward.a small The trench crossed the plain in an approximately straight line. The army of the Ephthalitae were drawn up behind it, facing the advancing Persians, while a few of them went out beyond the trench to draw the attack of the Persians. 23 11 12 13 14 15 16 PROCOPIUS OF CAESAREA op Ova per Tots évavtious év TO medio éxédeve paKpav arrobev, apdévras be povov eita ava KpaTos pevyew omricw, év pone, Tas avTod evrohas adh | TH KAT@PUXE éxovras, jvica 87 aQurins dry lorTa ixowvTo. ol dé Kara TAUTA érrotouv, Kal evel THS dcwpvyos ayxoTaTo & éryévovTo, &¢ | OALyous opas Euv- aryaryovTes SveBnoay a drravtTes kal TO ado oT pare dvepiryvurro. oi Oé Tlépoae Evveivas THS émiBourf] S ovdaph éyovtes KaTA Kpatos év Trediw May orr@, ediwxov, Gup@ TOAA® és Tous Trodepious EXO MEVOL, és Te THY sTappov eu Tren ToKaT W ATravTes,, 00x ot.

They did as directed, and,as they approached the trench, they drew themselves into a narrow column, and all passed over and joined the rest of the army. But the Persians, having no means of perceiving the stratagem, gave chase at full speed across a very level plain, possessed as they were by’a spirit of fury against the enemy, and fell into the trench, every man of them, not alone the first but also those who followed in the rear. For since they entered into the pursuit with great fury, as I have said, they failed to notice the catastrophe which had befallen their leaders, but fell in on top of them with their horses and lances, so that, as was natural, they: both destroyed them, and were themselves no less inyolyed in ruin. Among them were Perozes and all his. sons... And just as he was about to fall into this. pit, they say that he realized the danger, and seized and threw from him the pearl which hung from his right ear,—a gem of wonderful whiteness and greatly prized on account of its extraordinary size—in order, no doubt, that no one might wear it after him ; for it was a thing exceedingly beautiful to look upon, such as no king before him had possessed. This story, however, seems to me untrustworthy, because a man who found himself in such _ peril would have thought of nothing else; but I suppose that his ear was crushed in this disaster, and the pearl disappeared somewhere or other. This pearl the Roman Emperor then made every effort to buy from the Ephthalitae, but was utterly unsuccessful. 25 17 18 19 2 _ PROCOPIUS OF CAESAREA ov yap avro ebpéo far ot BapBapou elxpv, xatmep TOV@ TORO THY nrnoty Towne dpevor. pact pevrou \"Edbariras evpopéevous abo dorEpov TO KaSddy arroboa Gan. \"Oca 6& augl 76 d » TOUT Ilé oa pe papydape @ Iép Aéyoue ww elmety ak vov*. lows yap av T@ Kal ov mavTamac wy aTLoTOS 6 oyos Sofevey eval. re yourw ovv Tlépoae elvat pev ev TO xrevl 70 peapyapov Tobro év Garacon ¥ A év Tlépoas éotl, vnxer Oar bé TOV KTEVa Tis TauTn mpLOvos ov TON drrobev: dvewyevar TE avTou dupe Ta doTpaka, av 8 Kata pécov TO pdpyapov claret Oéapa Xorvyou: TOAD aor. | aro yap avT@ eixacOjvat ovda-- 3) éoxev ove TO peryeder ovTe TO KaAAEL EK TOD TAVTOS Xpovov.

However, they say that. the Hophinelitec found it later and sold it to Cabades. The story of this pearl, as told by the Persians, is worth recounting, for perhaps to some it may not seem altogether incredible. For they say that it was lodged in its oyster in the sea which washes the Persian coast, and that the oyster was swimming not far from the shore ; both its valves were standing open and the pearl lay between them, a wonderful sight and notable, for no pearl in all history could be compared with it at all, either in size orin beauty. A shark, then, of enormous size and dreadful fierceness, fell in love with this sight and followed close upon it, leaving it neither day nor night; even when he was compelled to take thought for food, he would only look about for something eatable where he was, and when he found some bit, he would snatch it up and eat it hurriedly; then overtaking the oyster immediately, he would sate himself again with the sight he loved. At length a fisherman, they say, noticed what was passing, but in terror of the monster he recoiled from the danger; however, he . reported the whole matter to the king, Perozes. Now when Perozes heard_his account, they say that a great longing for the pearl came over him, and he urged on this fisherman with many flatteries and hopes of reward. Unable to.resist the importunities of the monarch, he is said to have addressed Perozes as follows ; ‘‘ My master, precious to a man. is money, 27 23 pé PROCOPIUS OF CAESAREA Opamre Xpnpara, moBeworépa b€ 7) 4 wrx, TavT@v VTOL agi@rara TEKVOL.

Now I intend to make trial of the monster, and hope to make thee master of the pearl. And if I succeed in this struggle, it is plain that henceforth I shall be ranked among those who are counted blessed. For it is not unlikely that thou, as King of Kings, wilt reward me with all good things; and for me it will be sufficient, even if it so fall out that I gain no reward, to have shown myself a benefactor of my master. But if it must needs be that I become the prey of this monster, thy task indeed it will be, O King, to requite my children for their father’s death. _. Thus even after my death I shall still be a wage- earner among those closest to me, and. thou wilt win greater fame for thy goodness,—for in helping my children, thou wilt confer a boon upon me, who shall have no power to thank thee for the benefit— because generosity is seen to be without alloy only when it is displayed towards the dead.” With these words he departed. And when he came to the place where the oyster was accustomed to swim and the shark to follow, he seated himself there upon a rock, watching for an opportunity of catching the pearl alone without its admirer. - As soon as it came about that the shark had happened upon something which would serve him for food, and was delaying over it, the fisherman left upon: the beach those who were following him for this service, and made straight for the oyster with all his might ; already he had seized ° it and was hastening with all speed to get out of the water, when the shark noticed him and rushed to the rescue.

But the men who had been left upon the beach picked up the pearl, and, conveying it to the king, reported all that had happened: Such, then, is the story which the Persians relate, just as I have setit down, concerning this pearl. But I shall return ‘to the previous narrative. Thus Perozes was destroyed and the whole Persian army withhim. For the few who by chance did not fall into the ditch found themselves at the mercy of the enemy. | As aresult of this experience a law was established among the Persians that, while marching in hostile territory; they. should never engage in any ) ani persuit, even if it should happen that. the enemy had been driven back by force. . Thereupon those who had not marched with Perozes and had remained in their own land chose as. their king Cabades, the youngest son of Perozes, who was then the only one surviving. At that time, then, the Persians became subject and tributary to the Ephthalitae, until Cabades had established his power most securely and no longer deemed: it necessary to’ pay the annual tribute to them. And the ‘time these barbarians ruled over the Persians was two years. V Bur as time went on Cabades became more high-- handed in the administration of the government, and introduced innovations into the constitution, among ' which was a law which he promulgated providing 31 484 A.D.

Accordingly they rose against him, removed him from the throne, and kept him in prison in chains. They then chose Blases, the brother of Perozes, to be their king, since, as has been said, no male offspring of Perozes was left, and it is not lawful among the Persians for any man by birth a common citizen to be set upon the throne, except in case the royal family be totally extinct. Blases, upon receiving the royal power, gathered together the nobles of the Persians and held a conference con- cerning Cabades; for it was not the wish of the majority to put.the man to death. After the ex- _ pression of many opinions on both sides there came forward a certain man of repute among the Persians, whose name was Gousanastades, and whose office that of “ chanaranges ” (which would be the Persian term for general) ; his official province lay on the very frontier of the Persian territory in a district which adjoins tlic land of the Ephthalitae. Holding up his knife, the kind with which the Persians were accus- tomed to trim their nails, of about the length of a man’s finger, but not one-third as wide as a finger, he said: “ You see this knife, how extremely small it is; nevertheless it is able at the present time to accomplish a deed, which, be assured, my dear Persians, a little later two myriads of mail-clad men could not bring to pass.” This he said hinting that, if they did uot put Cabades to death, he would straightway make trouble for the Persians. But they were altogether unwilling to put to death a man of the royal blood, and decided to confine him 33 VOL. I.

On one occasion, however, the History of the Armenians relates that the operation of the law regarding the Prison of Oblivion was suspended by the Persians in the following way. There was once a truceless war, lasting two and thirty years, between the Persians and the Armenians, when Pacurius was king of the Persians, and of the Armenians, Arsaces, of the line of the Arsacidae. And by the long continuance.of this war it came about that both sides suffered beyond measure, and especially the Armenians. But each nation was possessed by such great distrust of the other that neither of them _ could make overtures of peace to their opponents. _ In the meantime it happened that the Persians became engaged in a war with certain other barbarians _ who lived’ not far from the Armenians. | Accordingly _ the Armenians, in their eagerness to make +a display _ to the Persians of their goodwill and desire for peace, decided to invade the land of these barbarians, first _ reyealing their plan to the Persians... Then they. fell upon them unexpectedly and killed almost the whole population, old and young alike. Thereupon Pacurius, who was overjoyed at the deed, sent certain of his _ trusted friends to Arsaces, and giving him pledges of security, invited him to his presence., And when Arsaces ‘came to him he showed him every kind- ness, and treated him as a brother on an equal footing with himself. Then he bound him by the most solemn oaths, and he himself swore likewise, 35 p 2 16 17 18 19 21 PROCOPIUS OF CAESAREA kataraBov Kal avtos ovdév TL hocoy d4@poKas pny edvous te Kal Evppdyovs Ilépocas re TO Aourrov Kal \"Appeviovs adXjAots elvat, adTixa OH avrov és Ta TatpLa HOn adjxev iévat.

Not. long after this certain persons. slandered Arsaces, saying that he was purposing to undertake some seditious enterprise. Pacurius was persuaded by these men and again summoned him, intimating that he was anxious to confer with him on general matters. And he, without any hesitation at all, came to the king, taking with him several of the most warlike among the Armenians, and among them Bassicius, who was at once his general and counsellor ; for he was both brave and sagacious to a remarkable degree. Straightway, then, Pacurius heaped reproach and abuse upon both Arsaces and Bassicius, because, disregarding the sworn compact, they had so speedily turned their thoughts toward secession... They, how- ever, denied the charge, and swore most insistently that no such thing had been considered by them. At first, therefore, Pacurius kept them under guard in disgrace, but after a time he enquired of the. Magi what should be done with them. Now the Magi deemed it by no means just to condemn men who denied their guilt and had not been explicitly found guilty, but they suggested to him an artifice by which Arsaces himself might be compelled to become openly his own accuser. They bade him cover the floor of the royal tent with earth, one half from the land of Persia, and the other half from Armenia. This the king did as directed.’ Then the Magi, after putting the whole tent under a spell by means of some magic rites, bade the king take his walk there rm 37 PROCOPIUS OF) CAESAREA éxéXevov Tov Baciréa Ety TO Apoakn Tovs Tepi- matous €vtav0a to.etcbar, émikadovvTa Tols> TE 23 EvyKerpévors Kal 6umpoopévors AvunvacOar.

They said, further, that they too must be present at the conversation, for in this way there would be witnesses of all that was said. Accordingly Pacurius straight- way summoned Arsaces, and began to walk to and fro with him. in the tent in the presence of the Magi; he enquired of the man why he had disregarded his sworn promises, and was setting about to harass the Persians and Armenians once more with grievous troubles. Now as long as the conversation took place on the ground which was covered with the earth from the land of Persia, Arsaces continued to make denial, and, pledging himself with the most _ fearful oaths, insisted that he was a faithful subject of Pacurius. But when, in the midst of his speaking, he came to the: centre of the tent where they stepped upon Armenian earth, then, compelled by some unknown power, he suddenly changed the tone. of his, words to-one of defiance, and:.from then on ceased not to threaten Pacurius and the Persians, announcing that he would have vengeance upon them for this insolence as soon as he should become his own master, These words of youthful folly he continued to utter as they walked all the way, until turning back, he came again to the earth from the Persian land. Thereupon, as if chanting a recantation, he was once more a suppliant, offering pitiable explanations to Pacurius. But when he came again to the Armenian earth, he returned to— his threats. In this way he changed many times to . one side and the other, and concealed none of his secrets.

After a time, when the Persians were marching against a barbarian nation, they were accompanied by an Armenian who had been especially intimate with Arsaces and had followed him when he went into the Persian land. This man proved himself a capable warrior in this campaign, as Pacurius observed, and was the chief cause of the Persian victory. For this _reason Pacurius begged him to make any request he wished, assuring him that he would be refused nothing by him. The Armenian asked for nothing else than that he might for one day pay homage to Arsaces in the way he might desire. Now it annoyed the king exceedingly, that he should be compelled to set aside a law so ancient ; however, in order to be wholly true to his word, he permitted that the request be granted. When the man found himself by the king’s order in the Prison of Oblivion, he greeted Arsaces, and both men, embracing each other, joined their voices in a sweet lament, and, bewailing the hard fate that was upon them, were able only with difficulty to release each other from the embrace. Then, when they had sated themselves with weeping and ceased from tears, the Armenian bathed Arsaces, and completely 36 eo ~I 39 40 PROCOPIUS OF CAESAREA Kal TANAKA OvK crn pen Levos eKOoUNCE, & oxhpa 5é avr mepiOéwevos TO Bacinetov émt ott Bados+ avéx wep. evtadOa Te.

Then Arsaces entertained those. present with a royal banquet just as was formerly his custom. During this feast many speeches. were made over the cups which greatly pleased Arsaces, and many incidents occurred which delighted his heart. The drinking was prolonged until nightfall, all feeling the keenest delight in their mutual intercourse; at length they parted from each other with great reluctance, and separated throughly imbued with happiness. Then they tell how Arsaces: said that after spending the sweetest day of. his life, and enjoying .the company of the man he had missed most of all, he would no. longer willingly endure _ the miseries of life ; and with these words, they say, he dispatched himself with a knife which, as it happened, he had purposely stolen at the banquet, and thus departed from among men. Such then is the story concerning this Arsaces, related in the Armenian History just as I have told it, and it was on that occasion that the law regarding the Prison of Oblivion was set aside. But I must return to the point from which I have strayed. VI Wuie Cabades was.in the prison he was cared for by- his wife, who went in to him constantly and earried him supplies of food.

In this way the keeper of the prison came to be familiar with the woman, and he conceived: for her an extraordinary love, and as a result permitted her to go in to her husband just as she wished, and to depart from there. again without interference from anyone. Now there was a Persian notable, Seoses by name, a devoted friend of Cabades, who was con- stantly in the neighbourhood of this prison, watching his opportunity, in the hope that he might in some way be able to effect his deliverance. And he sent word to Cabades through his wife that he was keeping horses and men in readiness not far from the prison, and he indicated to him a certain spot. Then one day as night drew near Cabades persuaded his wife to give him her own garment, and, dressing herself in his clothes, to sit instead of him in the - prison where he usually sat... In this way, therefore, Cabades made his. escape from the prison... For although the guards who were on. duty saw him, they supposed that it was the woman, and therefore decided not to hinder or otherwise annoy him, At daybreak they saw in the cell the woman in her husband’s clothes, and were so completely deceived as to think that Cabades was there, and this belief prevailed during several days, until Cabades had advanced. well on his way.

For the Persian accounts do not agree with each other, and for this reason I omit the narration of them. Cabades, in company with Seoses, completely escaped detection, and reached the Ephthalitae Huns ; there the king gave him his daughter in marriage, and then, since Cabades was now his son-in-law, he put under his command a very formidable army for a campaign against the Persians. This army the Persians were quite unwilling to encounter, and they made haste to flee in every direction. And when Cabades reached the territory where Gousanastades exercised his authority, he stated to some of his friends that he would appoint as chanaranges the first _ man of the Persians who should on that day come a into his presence and offer his services. _ But even as he said this, he repented his speech, for there came to his mind a law of the Persians which ordains that offices among the Persians shall not be conferred upon others than those to whom each particular honour belongs by right of birth. For he feared lest someone should come to him first who was not a kinsman of the present chanaranges, and that he would be compelled to set aside the law in. order to keep his word. Even as he was considering this matter, chance brought it about that, without dis- honouring the law, he could still keep his word. For the first man who came to him happened to be Adergoudounbades, a young man who was a relative of Gousanastades and an especially capable warrior. He addressed Cabades as “ Lord,” and was the first to do obeisance to him as king, and besought him to use him as a slave for any service whatever. So Cabades made his way into the royal palace without 47 488 A.D. 18 19 = PROCOPIUS OF CAESAREA Braonv tov apuvvopévwv AaBov e€etidrace, tTpoT@ 8) Ste TUProds ot Ilépca moveiy Tods Kaxoupyous ei@0acw, edavov Eovtes Kal avTo @$ uddiota Céov és Tors dPOarpmovs ovTL wHoYTAS EMLXEOVTES, 7) TEPOVNY TLVa TLONPaY TUpAKTOUVTES TavTn Te Tav ohOarpav Ta evTos yplovtes, Kal To Nourov év huraxn elyev apEavta Llepoav épiavtovs Sv0.

Thereafter Blases was kept in confinement, having raled over the Persians two years. Gousanastades was put to death _ and Adergoudounbades was established in his place in the office of chanaranges, while Seoses was imme- ‘diately proclaimed “adrastadaran salanes,’—a title designating the one set in authority over all magis- trates and over the whole army.

It was. for this reason, and for no just cause, that Cabades decided _to make an expedition against the Romans. _ First he invaded the land of the Armenians, moving with _ such rapidity as to anticipate the news of his coming, and, after plundering the greater part of it in a rapid eampaign, he unexpectedly arrived at the city of Amida, which is situated in Mesopotamia, and, although the season was winter, he invested the town. Now the citizens of Amida had no soldiers at hand, seeing that it was a time of peace and prosperity, and in other respects were utterly unprepared ; nevertheless they were quite unwilling to yield to the enemy, and shewed an unexpected fortitude in holding out against: dangers and hard- _ships., __.. Now there was among the Syrians a certain just | man, Jacobus by name, who had trained himself | with exactitude in matters pertaining to religion. | This ‘man had confined himself many years before in a’place called Endielon, a day’s journey from Amida, in order that he might with more security devote himself -to pious contemplation. The men of this place, assisting his. purpose, - had. surrounded. him with a kind of fencing, in which the stakes were not continuous, but. set at. intervals, so. that, those who approached could see and hold converse with him. pane they had constructed for him a ‘small roof over his head, sufficient to keep off the rain and snow. There this man had been sitting for a long time, _never yielding either to heat or .cold, and sus- taining his life with certain seeds, which he was | acctistomed to eat, not indéed every day, but only at long intervals.

But the hands of every one of them became motionless and utterly unable to manage the bow. When this was noised about through the army and came to the ears of Cabades, he desired to see the thing with his own eyes; and when he saw it, both he and the Persians who were with him were seized with great astonishment, and he entreated Jacobus to forgive the barbarians their crime. And he forgave them with a word, and the men were released from their distress. Cabades then bade the man ask for whatever he wished, Supposing that he would ask fora great sum of _ money, and he also added with youthful recklessness _ that he would be refused nothing by him. But he _requested Cabades to grant to him all the men who during that war should come to him as fugitives. | This request Cabades granted, and gave him a written _ pledge of his personal safety. And great numbers | of men, as might be expected, came flocking to him _ from all sides and found safety there ; for the deed became widely known. Thus, then, did these things take place. Cabades, in besieging Amida, brought against every part of the defences the engines known as rams; but the townspeople constantly broke off the heads of the rams by means of timbers thrown across them.! However, Cabades did not slacken his efforts until he realized that the wall could not be successfully assailed inthis way. For, though he battered the wall _ many times, he was quite unable to break down any portion of the defence, or even to shake it ; so secure 1 Cf.

Failing in this, Cabades raised an artificial hill to threaten. the city, consider- ably overtopping the wall; but the besieged, starting from the inside of their defences, made a tunnel extending under the hill, and from there stealthily - carried out the earth, until they hollowed out a great part of the inside of the hill. However, the outside ept the form which it had at first assumed, and afforded no opportunity to anyone of discovering what was being done. Accordingly many Persians mounted it, thinking it safe, and stationed them- sélves on: the ‘simmit with the purpose of shooting down upon the heads of those inside the fortifications. But with the great mass of men crowding upon it with a rush, the hill. suddenly fell in and killed almost all of them. Cabades, then, finding no remedy for the situation, decided to raise the siege, and he issued orders to the army to, retreat on the morrow. Then indeed the besieged, as though they had no thought. of their danger, began laughingly from the fortifications to jeer at the barbarians. © Besides this some courtesans shamelessly drew up their clothing and displayed. to Cabades, who was standing close by, those parts of a woman’s body which it is not proper that men should see uncovered. This was plainly seen by the Magi, and they there- upon’ came before the king and tried to prevent the _ retreat, declaring as their interpretation of what had. happened that the citizens of Amida would shortly disclose to:\\Cabades.all their secret and mien he So the Persian army remained there. 55 20 2 ro) 23 26 PROCOPIUS OF CAESAREA “Hyépars dé Tap Tes Hepoav ov Troddais dore- pov ayxiota TOV TUpyov Tues éxBornv vrrove- pov mahavod eidev ov Evy T@ aopanret Kecaup- pévyv, adr xarduEr cpixpais Te Kal od Alay cuxvais. vUKRT@P Te Hovos evrat0a Tpecov Kal THS etodov amorrerpacdpLevos évros Tob Tept- Béxou eyevero. dua &é EPS Tov TavTa oryov KaBddy am IpyyEtre. kal Os TH émuywopevy vurth Kripacas év 7 apacKevi) Tong dpevos Edy onréyous Tio ly évrad0a 706.

In the night he came there alone, and, making trial of the entrance, got inside the circuit-wall; then at daybreak he reported the whole matter to Cabades. -The king himself on the following night came to the spot with a few men, bringing ladders which he had made ready. And he was favoured by a piece of good fortune; for the defence of the very tower which happened to be nearest to the passage had fallen by lot to those of the Christians who are most careful in their observances, whom they call monks. These men, as chance would have it, were keeping some annual _ religious. festival to God on that day. When night came on they all felt great weari- ness? on account of the festival, and, having sated themselves with food and drink beyond their wont, they fell into a sweet and gentle sleep, and were conse- quently quite unaware of what was going on.
