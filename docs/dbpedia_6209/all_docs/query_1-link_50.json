        "text": "PM woos; hopeful for an honorable solution Bonnie Konyak Morung Express\n\nPM woos; hopeful for an honorable solution Bonnie Konyak Morung Express\n\nKohima | February 27 :Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs maiden address to the Nagas at the state capital Kohima today was a full 25 minutes of DAN bashing that dissected and put out for display, the failures of the hotchpotch coalition. The speech of the Prime Minister gained fiery momentum and packed punch after punch at Rios Government as he sought support of the people of Nagaland to change the ineffective and inefficient DAN government which has completely failed the people of Nagaland.\n\nSpeaking on the peace process, the Prime Minister elaborated on the need for peace in the State and expressed optimism that the Congress will succeed in its efforts for an honourable solution in its purposeful dialogue with disaffected groups. We have been open and liberal in our approach and are hopeful that we will succeed in our efforts for an honourable solution and added that the Congress is willing to go the extra mile for this purpose.\n\nNagaland needs an era of peace and stability so that the Naga people can devote all their energies to their cultural, educational, social and economic development, Manmohan said and finished off on an optimistic note with I believe the future for Nagaland is bright. I believe the future for Nagaland is secure. I believe the future for Nagaland is with the Congress party\n\nDenounces DAN as hotchpotch coalition Addressing the impressible gathering of Congress supporters, Manmohan minced no words as he said that for the last five years, Nagaland has been under a hotchpotch coalition of different political parties under the name DAN. They do not have a common ideology. They do not have a common agenda. Each one of them pulls in a different direction asserted the Prime Minister adding that the only thing common among the coalition partners was the desire to be in power (by hook or crook).\n\nManmohan Singh also rapped the erstwhile DAN Government on the law and order front saying that the people have suffered from the lawlessness here. A government which could not provide security to its people has no right to get the support of the people said the Prime Minister. He also accused Rios government of trying to divide the people on tribal, communal or racial lines with the result that in the last five years, Nagaland had missed out immense opportunities and fallen behind on the road to progress and prosperity, unable to enjoy peace and stability.\n\nIn typical campaign style, the prime Minister advertised the Congress party saying if the Nagas have to once again enjoy rapid development, peaceful life, if Nagaland is to fulfill its potential, you must once again bring the Congress party to power in the state. He said that the Congress alone can provide a stable, united and efficient government, deliver its promises and live up to the trust that the people of Nagaland repose on it.\n\nHarping on the special concern shown by the Nehru-Gandhi family to the Nagas and the state of Nagaland, Manmohan said that it was because of their commitment and unquestioned love for the Naga people that the Nagas have always supported the Congress. Making an obvious dig at the BJP party which is a coalition partner of the DAN, Manmohan said that Congress is the only national party that cares for the diversity that exist in India and the only party that has tried to bring the peoples of Nagaland and North East into the mainstream while at the same time protecting their unique history, culture and identity. No other party believed and practices the principles of secularism as we do he stated.\n\nImkong charges DAN of misrule CLP Leader I. Imkong was also in his element as he welcomed and thanked the Prime Minister for his concern for the state. He mentioned the concern of the UPA Government in constituting a ministerial team directly under the Prime Minister himself to negotiate with the NSCN (IM) and declaring peace with the NSCN (K) and magnanimously allotting huge amount of money to Nagaland for developmental works irrespective of party affiliation. Imkong however added that it was unfortunate that all these funds were misused and pocketed by the erstwhile DAN Government led by Rio and his colleagues.\n\nImkong also elaborated on the last five of misrule by the NPF led DAN Government trademarked by the frequent factional clashes in populated civilian areas, extortion, corruption while the state government shut their eyes and made the people suffer. The Regional Parties were out of power for so long and when they got the power, they had forgotten everybody and virtually looted the State, he mocked. Imkong flayed the road condition, selling of essential commodities in the market by Rio and the power situation while assuring that if voted to power the Congress would make power available to every nook and corner of Nagaland.\n\nImkong also question the promise of 25000 employment generation for Naga Youth promised by former Prime Minister AB Vajpayee and continued that the development preached by the DAN could be seen only in the resorts, commercial buildings, hotels and residential complexes of the DAN Chief Minister and ministers at Dimapur and Kohima. He accused Rio of taking away Rs. 340 crores from the State exchequer and using this looted money to buy votes of the people. Imkong also ridiculed the declaration 2006-2007 as Year of the Farmers, where money had been wasted in cheap popularity with organizing the Agri-Expo.\n\nToday the need of the people is peace and prosperity and employment for our unemployed youth, Imkong said that it was Congress government who initiated the peace process and it will only be a Congress Government who can bring lasting solution to the decades old Indo-Naga political problem which will be honourable and acceptable to all. Meanwhile NPCC President also castigated the DANs misrule and offered Congress as the remedy. AICC Secretary Incharge of Nagaland said termed the small regional parties a circus company that is usually not be found after a week.\n\nSumi Hoho reflects on unification morungexpress\n\nDimapur, February 28 (MExN): The Sumi Hoho iterates again support to Naga unification to bring all warring factions under one political organization so the bloodshed and fratricidal killings are stopped. A note form the Sumi Hoho president Hokishi Yepthomi made reflections over the entire issue. According to him gen Zuheto Swu stated in his patriot day speech on August 4, 2001 that from 1954-1964 485 Naga cadres were killed by the Indian security forces. These can be called patriots because they ere killed by the enemy for the cause the hoho president asserted. While asserting that the period between 1964 and 1990 was a silent feature where peace prevailed, the hoho president stated that in 1990 another new political dimension took place. This led to factionalism and Naga underground were engaged in fighting each other. We professed Nagaland for Christ but taking the name of Christ fratricidal killing started unabated. He Nagas claimed that thousands and thousands were sacrificed their lives for our motherland and called them as patriot? I would say we are murderers. No patriot will kill his own brothers he stated.\n\nFurther, reflecting over revolutionary history that there has been always two groups struggle for sovereignty the Sumi Hoho president referred to the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks in feudal Russia. He also referred to Mahatma Gandhi. But we Nagas through our ultimate goal is same sovereignty then why we fought among ourselves in the name of sovereignty he lamented. But there is political salvation, Yepthomi asserted, and this is through unification of all the Naga underground factions. Through this peace and prosperity will prevail in Nagaland, he maintained. We have to choose between bloodshed and peace. If we want to live in peace and harmony, we have no other option than unification of all factions he reminded.\n\nPMs speech hollow morungexpress\n\nDIMAPUR, FEBRUARY 28 (MExN): All India joint secretary (Org) of the BJP Party, V. Satish today threw barbs at the speech of the Prime Minister who made his maiden visit to the state, saying that in entire speech there was no specific message for the Naga people. It (the speech) was hollow, it was without any direction, only rhetoric, stated Satish as he made reference to honourable solution, disaffected people and other such words used the Prime Minister in his speech.\n\nDuring a press conference at the Dimapur Press Club, V. Satish said that instead of touching core issues of the Naga people, the PM simply involved himself in criticizing the DAN coalition when the Congress party themselves were in a coalition in most all states it ruled and even in the Centre. Referring to the United Progress Alliance (UPA) coalition at the Centre, Satish mocked that the alliance was neither united nor progressive.\n\nIt is an Ulta-Pulta alliance, unprincipled alliance he hit out and mentioned the partys sore issued that not letting the DAN complete its five years term by imposition Presidents Rule.\n\nSatish also accused the UPA Government of discriminatory attitude towards all the states that were ruled by a non-Congress coalition. He questioned the UPA on how much money had been release since 2004, from the Prime Ministers Package promised by AB Vajpayee the former Prime Minister of India when he had visited Nagaland.\n\nThe All India Joint Secretary also castigated the UPA on its reaction on National Security while referring to Jammu & Kashmir, Arunachal and Bangladesh, saying that the Central Government was very laid back on the matter. He flay that the Prime Minister had visited China but did not open his mouth on the claims the country made on Arunachal. The softness towards terrorist act will cost the country much he said.\n\nWith reference to the coming polls in Nagaland, Satish expressed fear of large scale bogus voters from neighbouring Assam. He said that it was the practice of the Congress to bring truckloads of voter from neighbouring Assam which had Congress in power and therefore appealed to the Election Commission and Chief Election Officer to take enough care that such bogus voting does not happen. The Joint Secretary also called the Congress in Nagaland as faceless party with no issue and frustrated party. He expressed confidence on the success of the BJP candidates declaring that the partys tally in the state would be increased in Nagaland as well as Meghalaya.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. HT Sangliana, who was also present in the Press conference at Dimapur Press Club Office along with Balla Subramania, and Avinash Koli, BJP General Secretary (Org) of Nagaland, also gave an account of their visit to five constituencies today and said that he was impressed by the response of the people to the party. Sangliana talked of the lack of roads and housing facilities in the districts and termed their visit to the villages as a fact finding venture.\n\nSangliana also rapt the lack of concrete visit in the Prime Ministers address to the people of Nagaland and added that Manmohan Singh did not address the peace negotiation pinpotedly. The BJP chief minister candidate of Mizoram also drew flake at the Railway budget, saying that it was merely a promise while demanding a white paper on how many promises made by Railway Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav had been fulfilled in the last four years.\n\nSangliana also appeared defensive as he tried to allay charges of BJPs secularism citing his own doubts in the beginning. He said that the followers of Christ should not feel shy to join hands with the BJP. Sangliana also conveyed optimism that out of the 23 candidates filed by the BJP, atleast 10 or 12 would come out successful in this coming election.\n\nAtal & Advani pursue voters\n\nDimapur, February 28 (MExN): Doing their bit for the Nagaland polls, former Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Opposition leader LK Advani today encouraged the people to elect BJP candidates in large numbers. A message claiming to be from the two BJP stalwarts issued through the states general secretary Avinash Koli, maintained that our partys commitment to ensuring a better future for Nagaland has been proven.\n\nThe BJP leaders took to fore their plank for peace and development. Peace is a precondition for development; without development, there can be no employment. The BJPs goal, both in Nagaland and in the rest of India, is to remove poverty they stated. Over the peace process, the message acknowledged that the overwhelming desire among Naga people is for a permanent peace with honor, dignity and respect for Naga history and culture. And it is this understanding which guided all the sincere and sustained efforts of the NDA government to ensure speedy and meaningful progress of the peace process.\n\nThe two leaders also observed that much depends on the strengthening of the democratic process in the state, since it is inextricably linked to our commonly cherished goals of peace and development. The two BJP leaders assured that if its candidates are elected, they would do their utmost to further the objectives of peace and development.\n\nWe appeal to you to elect BJP candidates in large numbers, the two leaders urged and wished the people the best.\n\nManmohan dividing the Nagas: NPF morungexpress\n\nDIMAPUR, FEBRUARY 28 (MExN): Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs charge against the DAN Government as being responsible for dividing the Naga people on tribal, communal and racial lines, is considered a violation of the model code of conduct by the NPF. The NPF today demanded appropriate action from the Election Commission of India. In a release, the NPF party said the accusation deserves special attention from the EC. It has sought immediate and appropriate action for inciting tribalism and communalism. The NPF party expressed shock at what it terms the contradictory statement of Dr. Manmohan Singh on Wednesday at Kohima. The NPF stated that the accusation made by the prime minister in terming the DAN coalition as a hotch potch government, only showed his lack of understanding and knowledge of the state of affairs in Nagaland. Compared to the UPA Government supported by the Left at the Centre, the DAN coalition was more stable and progressive. Such loose statement from a man of his stature is very unbecoming NPF stated.\n\nThe release issued jointly by vice president Zaka Tsukru, general secretary Dr. Kath, associate press secretary Shilumar and president of youth Wing Kakuto Shohe reminded that UPA was formed after the 2004 general election just to seize power after the Congress party lost miserably. UPA is a post-poll coalition with 14 parties having no common agenda, it stated.\n\nHowever, DAN, it said, is a pres-poll alliance in 2002 with clear Common Minimum Program which was release on January 30, 2003 by the then Defense Minister George Fernandes.\n\nThe NPF also thanked the Prime Minister for admitting that Nagaland has missed opportunities in terms of progress and prosperity and said that due to the insincerity and hypocritical approach of the UPA Government , DAN could not avail and implement the promise and commitments made by the then Prime Minister Vajpayee and various other proposals. It challenged the UPA Government that if it was serious and concerned for the Nagas, they should spell out in detail, the missed opportunities.\n\nThe regional party also questions the speech of the prime minister on the commitment of Indira, Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi to the well being and empowerment of the Nagas when the fact remains that during the tenures i.e. 1975, 1988, 1992 and 2008, Nagaland had experienced four Presidents Rule. The NPF also dismissed the various programmes and schemes by the PM as mere lip service to purchase the votes. The PM should know that Nagas are not mere commodities to be sold and used. The NPF appealed to the Nagas to give a befitting reply to the Congress for insulting Naga pride and dignity by imposing PR illegally and unconstitutionally. The party went on to say that if the Congress led UPA Government had so much concern for the Naga people, what had the Prime Minister doing during the last four years and why had he come to campaign only during the elections.\n\nIn addition the NPF turned its guns on K. Theries accusation that Rio, Thenucho, Lohe and Timikha had gone to Hebron Camp on February 22. This is pure fabrication meant to mislead the public, the party said. The NPF provided proof that on the said day, Rio had attended meetings at Chare village, Tuensang town and spent the night at Tuensang town and then again addressed NPF rallies at Tuensang, Noksen and Ungma the next day. The NPF advises Therie to stop hallucinating. Therie should substantiate his allegations with proper evidence. Countering back, the party stated that Therie had on February 29 at 3 AM, with a group of army, led by supporters terrorized civilians of Pfutsero village by grouping them at the village Church. Was this operation carried out at the behest and directive of the Prime Minister following his visit to Nagaland? the NPF questioned.\n\nRegarding Imkongs charge of withdrawal of 340 crore from the state exchequer and 92 crore on 22 December, the release said that DAN leader, Rio had already issued a detailed press statement of January 10 to that effect. It stated that till the imposition of PR on January 3, 2008, the state Government had no overdraft with the RBI, instead the state government had a surplus balance of a little ore than 90 crore in its RBI account from 13 to 31 December, 2007. An amount of 175.15 crore was withdrawn from the Government Treasury by various departments in the course of normal transaction, which includes payments on accounts of Centrally sponsored schemes, state plans, payments of arrears, salaries of work charge employees and 22 crore for LADP fund, it stated. The NPF pointed out that given the fact that the annual budget of the state is 3983 crore, the average monthly expenditure is around 332 crore, therefore the withdrawal of 175.15 crore by various departments during 13 to 30 December 2007 is absolutely nothing unusual. These baseless allegations are the usual attitude of the Congress party it stated and advised the public not to be misled and confused by such false statement.\n\nPM wants Naga economy to grow Chizokho Vero Morungexpress\n\nKohima | February 27 : Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh today asserted that the UPA government and the Congress party are committed to the development of Nagaland. We have taken many steps for improving its economic condition. We have made the development of infrastructure the cornerstone of our development policy for Nagaland, said Prime Minister while addressing public meeting here at the Kohima Local Ground.\n\nPrime Minister expressed his happiness that in the last 3 years, it had been able to connect 16 new habitations with new roads and upgrade many of the existing roads. A 4-lane National Highway is to be built from Dimapur to Kohima. Improvement of other national highways in the state connecting it to the rest of the North East has also been approved. More than 700 kms of roads will be upgraded. All the 11 districts headquarters are to be connected with national highways with 2-lane roads. All this is part of the UPA governments development plan for Nagaland, he said.\n\nApart from road connectivity, he said that it had also placed emphasis on telecom and air connectivity, adding that over one lakh telephone connections have been provided in the last four years. A new airport will be coming up at Chiethu, he said adding that improved air connectivity will also contribute to tourism and industrial development in Nagaland.\n\nAlso stating that the UPA government has formulated a new North East Industrial and Investment Promotion Policy, Dr Singh said  This policy will promote investment in the state- in hotels, in nursing homes and old age homes, in adventure and leisure sports, in training institutes and also in new power projects. All this will provide employment to the youth of Nagaland. Admitting that the people of Nagaland are highly talented and educated, he said I want them to have access to the best available employment opportunities in our country. I want Nagaland to be an active member of Indias growing economy. The initiatives of the UPA government will generate new employment opportunities for young people in Nagaland, he said adding that to ensure that young friends in the state are properly trained, we have improved educational facilities in Nagaland. Also highlighting about the setting up of ITIs in various districts, he informed that a new Institute of Hotel Management is also being set up.\n\nI find it extremely satisfying when I see Naga boys and girls engaged in jobs in other parts of the country , earning decent incomes. We need to bring these jobs to Nagaland, he said. This the Congress party will certainly do, he said adding that in the coming years, it will spend far more on education. He also assured that Nagaland will get its due share  so that you can have top class education facilities here.\n\nWith the funds provided by the UPA government, he said that more than one and half lakh children were getting mid-day meal, adding that under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, new schools are being opened, new school buildings are being built and new teachers are being appointed in schools. Touching on National Rural Health Mission, Prime Minister said that it had appointed over 1200 ASHAs to work in villages and improve health services.\n\nWe will work to see that the women of Nagaland, who are so active socially and economically, get their rightful share in the development process, and can have a bright future, he said. He also stated that he wanted every resident of Nagaland to enjoy good health and a life free of poverty and disease. I want every child to have access to the best educational facilities. This can be done only by the Congress party, he said.\n\nApart from infrastructure development, he said we have placed great emphasis on rural development. It is our solemn assurance that if the Congress party comes to office here, we will provide electricity in every village, will provide telephone connectivity to every village and ensure good drinking water supply to all.\n\nThis we are already doing under Bharat Nirman, he said. He, however, expressed his regret that the government here has so far been slow in implementing this programme effectively. The Congress party will see that a new Nagaland is created through liberal funding by the Central Government under Bharat Nirman. Referring to National Rural Employment Guarantee act, which provides assured employment of 100 days to all rural families, he said that 22,000 households have been provided employment in Nagaland.\n\nFrom 1 April, the entire state will be covered under this Act. I foresee this act eliminating chronic poverty from all parts of Nagaland. This was a promise of the Congress party in 2004 and you must remember this fact, Prime Minister said.\n\nAlso expressing his happiness that Kohima will benefit from the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission launched by the UPA government, he said We have provided funds for housing poor people in Kohima and Dimapur. Funds will also be provided for improving urban facilities including drinking water and sanitation in Kohima and Dimapur.\n\nAlso stating that he was aware that Nagaland has a tradition of strong local self-government through Village Development Councils, the Prime Minister said the Congress party will work to strengthen the Village Development Councils so that development at the grass roots is responsive to the needs of the people.\n\nArmy Chief visits Nagaland Special Correspondent The Hindu\n\nNEW DELHI: Chief of the Army Staff General Deepak Kapoor reviewed the security situation in Nagaland as the State is going to the polls in March.\n\nGen. Kapoor was briefed in Kohima about the security situation by General Officer Commanding 3 Corps Lt. Gen. M. S. Dadwal and Inspector General of Assam Rifles (North) Major Gen. K. S. Sethi with special reference to the coming elections and also the security situation in south Assam.\n\nThe Army Chief lauded the efforts of Assam Rifles and directed Maj. Gen. Sethi to continue the operations in the State to prevent any untoward incident before the polls.\n\nPM has no business with Nagaland poll: BJP The Hindu\n\nKohima (PTI): Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Nagaland to canvass for Congress candidates has come under severe criticism from the BJP which took a broadside against him saying he has no moral right to seek votes as he failed to realise any of his commitments made for northeast.\n\n\"For what business has he (Prime Minister) come to Nagaland ahead of the assembly election? He was elected to the Rajya Sabha from Assam but what has he done for the people of the region?\" BJP national vice president and former minister Juel Oram asked. Singh came here only on the eve of assembly election and not earlier, Oram told reporters at Dimapur.\n\nAlleging that Congress never gave any attention to the northeast, the BJP leader blamed the party for problems faced by the states.Oram also dared Congress to prove allegations of misappropriation of Central fund by the DAN government during the past five years.\n\n\"The Congress is launching misinformation campaign to tar the secular image of BJP, as it is worried over spurt in BJP's popularity in every part of the country, including Nagaland,\" Oram said.\n\nHR development is one of NPFs strength morungexpress\n\nDimapur, February 28 (MExN): The NPF party is marching to poll-battle armed with achievements secured in the human resources development sector, over the last four and a half years of DAN rule. NPF chief Dr. Shurhozelie envisages these achievements to be cornerstones to building the state, recognizing that human resource development  with particular reference to intellectual elevation  is one area that would be instrumental in taking Nagaland ahead.\n\nThe NPF party president highlighted these resource dimensions in Radio Talk a segment of All India Radio broadcast recently. Today, we are living in a world where intellectual competence is needed more than any other time in the history of mankind the NPF chief said. It is for this that the party aims at universally-adopted models of education. He explained: Since this political party represents the personality of the Naga people we made effort to introduce a system so as to prepare the whole personality of the Naga youth to perfection to discern what is good for us.\n\nWhen the then Prime Minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee visited Nagaland in October 2003, Dr. Shurhozelie said, the PM was happy to see our sincere effort to develop the State, and accordingly he had committed a sum of 1050 crores of rupees covering various packages of development. Of which, a sum of Rs. 35.00 crores was given for development of Nagaland University and also Rs. 10.00 crores for development of its Kohima campus With the completion of these two campuses, our youth will get all facilities to pursue their studies in higher education he said.\n\nFurther, during the NPF-led DANs rule, the School of Engineering & Technology and also School of Management Studies was incepted. Alongside, a Sainik school was planned and the foundation for it was laid in February 2005. It took two years to complete the infrastructure and the school is now two years old and our boys have been doing very good Dr. Shurhozelie expressed happiness.\n\nFor education of the rural masses, three colleges  Peren College in Peren, Wangli College in Longleng and Presidency College in Kiphire  were established. The government had also taken over Kohima Arts College in order to facilitate more seats to the Naga youth from other districts for those who want to study in the capital, he said. In the sphere of science and technology the government gave more importance to Science studies. Accordingly, Science wings in different districts were attached to Government Arts colleges. Besides Science education in Nagaland, the former education minister said, with the advent of new technologies and the ever-increasing importance of the ICT sector, an urgent need was felt for introducing courses dealing with ICT subjects. Accordingly, the Institute of Communication and Information Technology (ICIT) was established in Mokokchung under Third Technical Education Project. The State has now three technical institutes offering various diploma engineering programmes in civil, electrical and electronics, mechanical, computer electronics and communication, computer application, modern office practice, automobile and fashion technology.\n\nWe have also introduced computer education which will cover all our schools and colleges in due course of time. So far, we have covered 125 Government and 75 Private Schools and another 284 schools are being covered during the current year he informed. Furthermore, he said two private universities were established through legislation in the Nagaland Legislative Assembly. The two are Global Open University in Wokha as HQ and campuses at Kohima, Dimapur and elsewhere in the State. The other is ICFAI, with its headquartered at Dimapur. It is expected that these universities will produce proficient professionals by offering high quality education and creating well endowed academic infrastructure. Under this sector, we have also signed an agreement with Korean firms to start Polytechnic Institute in Nagaland and for those who pass out from this proposed Institute, the Koreans have agreed to take yearly 200 Naga youth to Korea for placement for three consecutive years. These and many more programmes are in the offing he said.\n\nDr. Shurhozelie also referred to the setting up of the Referral Hospital under the management of Christian Institute of Health Sciences and Research. He added that the DAN has a programme to start a nursing college in the first year which is to be followed by a medical college in another two to three years.\n\nLalu - train chugs into NagalandZakir Hussain\n\nDimapur | February 28 :After winning the hearts of the common man through his fifth railways budget, Railway Minister and RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav Thursday announced that the 85 Km Dimapur to Zubza Railway network at the cost of Rs. 10 crore would be a national project and would also consider a rail network between Tuli and Mokokchung.

He added that during RJD regime in Bihar, he was the only one who stopped the Rath Yatra of former deputy prime minister, LK Advani and put him behind bars at Jharkhand jail.\n\nHighlighting the plight of north Indian people, especially from Bihar in Maharashtra and Assam, he cautioned Raj Thackeray of Maharashtra Nav Nirman Sena and United Liberation Front of Asom not to target the Hindi-speaking people, especially Biharis. Talking about Bal Thackeray, he said that Thackeray was too old to fight in the name of religion, caste, community etc. and further challenged Thackeray that he was going to celebrate Chath Puja in Mumbai along with his people.\n\nStating about the turnaround of Indian Railway in the last four years, Yadav said I stopped corruption and mal-practices in the Railways. Stating about the Fifth Railways Budget, Yadav said girls till the completion of BA would get free traveling pass, boys till 12th standard and 50 percent concession for senior citizens (60 years), fully air-conditioned Garib Rath etc. Yadav also assured the porters of India (Coolie) with Grade IV jobs in the Railways.

Imkong.\n\nIn its petition to the CEC, the NPF stated that the issue of the UG hand had become a matter of grave concern to the peace loving public in the State and the public of 29 Jangpetkong AC in particular. The NPF alleged that altogether eight NSCN (IM) leaders were moving freely with their armed cadres threatening the innocent public to vote for a particular party. The eight named by the NPF include Meren, Deputy Kilonser of Nokphu village; Maongtoshi, Tatar of Waromung village; Lipok, Tatar of Molungyimsen village; Mrs Alemla Phomting, wife of Brig Phomting of Ceasefire Monitoring Cell; Remajemba, Tatar Dibui village; Lt Col Lanuangshi of Chungtia village; Captain Bendangyanger of Chungtia village and Captain Nungsang of Yaongyimsen village.\n\nThe NPF urged that their involvement was a very serious matter likely to influence the outcome of the election and therefore requested the EC to take up the matter with the Home Ministry as these NSCN groups instead of remaining in their designated camps are moving freely with arms threatening the public to vote in favour of a particular candidate and party. The NPF stated that in the interest of free and fair polls in the State, the EC was expected to uphold their promise to the people of the State to conduct fair poll and pointed out that otherwise the Naga people will no longer have faith in the Indian democracy.\n\nIn a separate appeal, the NPF 29 Jangpetkong AC pointed out to the Collective Leadership that the public of 29 Jangpetkong AC should not be forced to elect a person with dubious character and undemocratic behavior. Your armed cadres and civil officials are openly colluding with I. Imkong, Congress candidate threatening and harassing the public to vote for him, stated the appeal addressed to Isak Chishi Swu and Th Muivah.\n\nWe believe you are committed to political process and dialogue with the government of India and to bring the present talk to a successful conclusion on behalf of the Naga people, the appeal stated cautioning that the Collective Leadership and the organization they were heading would lose public support, goodwill and sympathy by their involvement in the State election.\n\nThe appeal also alleged that the public were openly talking that Brigadier Phomting of CMFG and his wife are the two main persons masterminding the NSCN (IM)s cadre involvement in the present election. The appeal reminded that during the last Manipur election as well, people had openly spoken about how the NSCN (IM)s involvement had resulted in creating division among the Naga brethrens in the hill areas of Manipur. It is our appeal to you to withdraw all your cadres involved in the present election and allow to hold the election in Nagaland State peacefully, the appeal stated.\n\nAR Ops heat up with more arrest morungexpress\n\nDimapur, February 28 (MExN): In the ongoing operations by Assam Rifles in poll bound Nagaland, the AR based on specific information on wee hours of February 28, a joint operation by 17 AR, 14 Mahar and IRB at Pfutseromi in form of cordon and search was launched which led to apprehension of individual Khrope Nagachu and recovery of huge amount of explosives, besides variety of ammunition and warlike stores while the apprehended individual was subsequently handed over to police. The place was being used a hideout by NSCN (IM) cadres.\n\nMeanwhile, the 31 AR raided a house in Burma Camp, Dimapur on February 27 night and apprehended Sachemi Cd, judicial secretary and, Aching Kami, deputy secretary, chaplee department of NSCN (IM) alongwith 2 beretta pistol and several live rounds and incriminating documents. Two vehicles one Bolero Regn No NL07  5984 and Alto Regn No MN 06L  2176 was also seized, further handed over to East police Station.\n\na MVCP laid by 37 AR at Hothoty (near Tiru) on February 27 night intercepted a unregistered tipper vehicle and arrested four NSCN (IM) cadres SS Pvt Ango Lotha, SS Pvt Dingom Konyak, SS Pvt Pelong Konyak and Driver Pranjal Gogoi besides recovering 1 riffle 303, 1 Riffle 7.62 bolt action, bayonet several live rounds and blank cash receipts.

Meanwhile an officer led patrol of 31 AR on February 27 night seized a gypsy Regn No NL01 8905 at Nihokhu village and confiscated 115 cases of IMFL subsequently handed over to police. In a separate incident MVCP laid by 42 AR at Zotsoma by pass on February 28 early morning intercepted an Alto, Tata safari and a minibus and recovered Cash 18 Lakhs, 7 Kgs Contraband (Ganja) and 91 cases of IMFL.\n\nAR sources revealed that all possible measures will be implemented to ensure peace and instill confidence in the local populace prior to elections and all erring factional cadres and anti-social elements will be dealt with stringent actions to ensure non interference to disturb the environment of poll bound Nagaland. All cadres should go into their designated camps as was brought out in CFMG / CFSB meetings. This was stated in a press note received here from Pallab Choudhury, Major, PRO, IGAR (N).\n\nPMs Poll Tonic morungexpress\n\nThe visit of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to Kohima on February 27 as part of the campaign ahead of the March 5 election was obviously well orchestrated by the Congress party managers sending out some crucial political signals to the electorate. Besides the assurance of an honorable settlement, the other issue of great public expectationthe construction of the 4-lane of National Highway 39was virtually laid out for the taking. As Prime Minister of India, it was only appropriate that he was slotted to campaign in the State Capital of Kohima while the Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi will do her chorus in cosmopolitan Dimapur and Congress bastion Mokokchung. Whether by projecting the face of a Congress Prime Minister in Kohima would have served the purpose of the State Congress in reaching out to the electorates across the Tenyimi region, especially the major districts of Kohima and Phekseen as strongholds of the NPF, one will have to wait for the end result after March 5. But what the Nagaland Congress did courtesy Mr Prime Minister from the rampart of the States political capital is definitely the high point of the Congress campaign so far.\n\nIt is also a strategic point for the Congress that if it wants to make a bigger impact in the tally count (crucial to get a simple majority), it needs to get at least some seats across the Kohima-Tseminyu-Phek-Meluri belt. The Congress was almost wiped out in this region winning only 2 seats out of 13 assembly constituency during the last elections. Even in its stronghold of Mokokchung district with 10 seats at stake, it is highly unlikely that the Congress can repeat its past performance because of various factors including realignment of political forces and ticket distribution. Our political guess is that for both the major party i.e. Congress and NPF, the key to coming to power will lie on not just sweeping their respective strongholds but to win seats across the State consistently.\n\nComing back to the visit, while the Prime Minister made other promises for peace, prosperity and development, his remarks on the Naga political issue would have been closely watched. The careful and selective use of terms such as extra-mile and honorable settlement on the Indo-Naga peace process is also an indication that Delhi has come to accept the issue as an emotive onecentered on the political aspiration and rights of the Naga people. Likewise, the statement of the Prime Minister that the UPA government has been open and liberal in their approach to the Naga talks will no doubt inject the much needed dose of confidence back into the peace process suffering from its lowest ebb in the aftermath of the remarks made by none other than the National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister.\n\nHowever the problem with the Prime Ministers assurance of honorable settlement and his assertion of open and liberal approach to the Naga talks is quite clearly, the timing. An election rally is never the best time or laboratory to test the political commitments of the establishment, especially when it comes to something as big as the Indo-Naga political issue. During the heat of election, any Prime Minister can woo the electorate with the choicest of words. So the real intent of the Prime Ministers assurance to the Naga public will be tested at the talks table and whether as the political head of the Indian government, the Prime Minister will indeed go the extra-mile and push for an honorable settlement. Even if it was for only 45 minutes, yet having made that political journey to Nagaland as the Prime Minister of a Congress led UPA government, the fortunes of the Congress in the years to come will now depend on how far the party will adhere to the promise spelled out in its election declaration. This is more so of the Prime Ministers assurance on the Naga political issue.\n\nNagaland: A time for peace or a time for war?Kaka D.Iralu\n\nBecause of the Indo-Naga-Myanmar war, my generation has not experienced peace on earth for the entire duration of their lives. Hence if there is one common cry in the hearts of my generation as well as every Naga heart, it is the cry for peace. However peace having eluded us for all this time, I am inclined to rethink whether, I have been crying for peace when actually it is a time for war. In this context, I was surprised to discover that the Bible which is the word of God and which had foretold everything that would happen in human history never promised us a utopia on earth where there would be universal world peace. (The Bible does mention that there would be a period of world peace during the millennium period when Jesus comes back to reign with his saints on earth- Rev20:4-6) However as for the period in which we are presently living, the Bible in Matt 24:4-8 and others, foretold that in the flow of human history, there would be wars and rumors of war. It also states that nations would rise against nations. These Biblical prophecies have been fulfilled over and over again in human history since the times of Jesus. These Biblical prophecies also overtook our nation when in the early 1950s India and Burma invaded our lands.\n\nNow many of us Christians like to think that the Bible talks only about good things regarding our salvation and personal happiness. Yes the Bible talks about these things, but it also talks about many other uncomfortable facts of life. For example, I for one would wish that the Bible would talk only about a time to be born and never about a time to die. I also wish there would only be times of laughter and never times of weeping and mourning. But the book of reality solemnly states that under Gods sovereignty, such contrasting times would happen in human lives and human history. (See Eccl 3:1-8)\n\nUnder the same order of Gods sovereign will, Eccl 3:8 states that there would be times of love and times of hate. It also declares that there would be times of war and times of peace. Here let us also recollect Jesus own words where he said that there would be wars and rumors of war.\n\nAs for the causes of war, James 4:2 states thus: You desire and do not have; so you kill. And you covet and cannot obtain; so you go to war. Now in the case of India and Burmas invasion of our lands, it is a clear case of coveting our mineral resources and strategic geo-political location for which they have forcefully annexed or lands to their own. Under such circumstances and times, are we supposed to go to war in self defense or are we supposed to beg for peace from them. Can there be peace in our lands when we are under invasion and two foreign flags are flying in our country? Can there be peace in our lands when foreign laws that can even shoot us to death on mere suspicion prevail in our lands? Can there indeed be peace in our lands when our very history, geography and even our liberty to live as free citizens in our own lands have been wrestled away by foreign powers?\n\nUnder the present circumstances, when it is indeed a time of war for us, are we evading the issue and obligation that we owe to God and our God given country to defend her? If instead of defending our God given country and our God given rights, we are instead collaborating with the enemy and pleading for peace with them, then we are guilty of treason both to God as well as to our country. Under the present circumstances, I would emphatically state that there cannot be peace in Nagaland as long as foreign flags and foreign soldiers are still in our lands.\n\nTherefore, in the light of these present glaring facts, the present times cannot be a time for peace in Nagaland but a time for war. It is a time for war because we have been invaded by our neighbors. And at such times as this, if the price for peace is war than we must go to war. And I say this, because lasting peace will never come through the evasion or compromise of justice and truth. Here, only the fainthearted and the cowardly would seek peace with those who seek to destroy our freedom and our liberty.\n\nFinally, to our own national leaders and workers allow me to say this:\n\nIn a time of war, only leaders without vision will be dividing and subdividing its people into factions and fractions. Such leaders cannot be saviors of the nation but destroyers of the nation. They are unworthy of national leadership and should therefore be removed from the helms of national affairs. Also in a time of war only insane leaders would try to start an internal revolution in order to forcefully impose a foreign political ideology upon an already broken and shattered people. Finally, it is a shameful and cowardly act on the part of any national leader to be hiding and cowering under a white flag of peace in a time of war.\n\nRather than all these madness, in a time of war, comrades and patriots should be tending to the wounds of injured comrades. Soldiers in uniform and arms should be standing behind trenches defending the motherland from foreign invasion. And most of all, let us get this clearly into our heads, that in times of war, only the insane and the lunatic would turn his gun upon his own fellow citizens. When will Nagas and Nagaland face these facts and truths of our present times and collectively fight back for our liberty and freedom? The need of the hour is collective reconciliation, unity and action - not collective anything else.\n\nPrime Minister who fulfills the Naga dreams Oken Jeet Sandham\n\nPrime Minister Manmohan Singhs keenness to resolve the Naga issue cannot be questioned. It was he who invited the collective leadership of the NSCN (IM) to come to New Delhi and also allowed them to stay in Nagaland to be in contact with leaders of various civil societies. Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio, his cabinet colleagues, leaders of other political parties and even Naga politicians from neighboring states held discussions with Chairman Isak Chishi Swu and general secretary Th Muivah at their Camp Hebron near Dimapur. This was a significant achievement on the part of the organization as it needed to study the ground realities and the credit for this goes to the Prime Minister. Manmohan Singh went further by fulfilling the NSCN-IMs demand that the bureaucratic-level talks, which were a mere get-together to keep the ceasefire alive, be upgraded to the level of a political one by constituting a ministerial team headed by Union minister Oscar Fernandez. In fact, interlocutor K Padmanabhaiah to the Center-NSCN (IM) peace talks played a crucial role in striking a balance even in the face of severe criticism for speaking out about the talks.\n\nHe was rapped and called a mere government servant who knew nothing about the Naga political issue and, at times, he had to retract his statements. Many doubted his continuity as New Delhis interlocutor when the BJP-led NDA lost power at the Center. But he survived the change of guard, as the new Congress-led UPA government required his experience in pushing the peace process forward.\n\nThis proved that the UPA genuinely wanted to solve the Naga problem and was not interested in political vengeance. One of the significant steps the UPA government took was to extend the ongoing ceasefire with the NSCN (IM) indefinitely. This, according to the government, was needed to concentrate more on the substantive issues as both parties had been wasting precious time on working out mostly for truce extensions.\n\nThat the UPA is keen to resolve the Indo-Naga political issue was clear from the fact that Oscar Fernandez flew to Dimapur by a special Indian Air Force plane to sign that historic ceasefire extension on 31 July last year. This clearly showed Dr Singhs integrity and his governments seriousness in resolving the Naga issue. This is rather a breakthrough as far as the peace process is concerned. It is also reported that out of the 30-point charter of demands put forward by the NSCN (IM), the government of India has reportedly agreed to 70 per cent in principle and that only 30 per cent remains to be settled which, perhaps, includes the critical areas of foreign policies, separate flag, currency, defence, etc, and, of course, the contentious issue of Naga integration. Political analysts and pundits have candidly suggested that since a large portion of the demands put up by the organization has already been agreed upon the collective leadership should not keep the process under wraps and instead move ahead to enter into a final agreement.\n\nAfter all, negotiation means give and take, and they have to be prepared to lose something. In reality, nobody can deny that from the very beginning it was former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao who had publicly declared that the Naga issue is political and it should be solved politically. This gave political status to the complex Naga issue and this has been translated into reality by Manmohan Singh with his formally constituting a ministerial team. This is also what the collective leadership of the NSCN (IM) had been demanding all along. It is very fortunate that the same Prime Minister who fulfilled the dreams of the Naga underground leaders visits the State and this shows what he really thinks for the Naga people.\n\nUnfortunately, some non-Congress political leaders, instead of appreciating the UPA Prime Ministers fulfilling demands of the Naga people, reacted to his visit saying that he would not be able to announce any economic package. The underlying question is whether to choose the solution to the long drawn out Naga political issue or economic package. If the people of Nagaland are asked to choose one from the two, they will choose the former.\n\nNDFB out of truce talks - Outfit asks for clarifications OUR CORRESPONDENT The Telegraph\n\nFile picture of an NDFB activist keeping vigil at the outfits headquarters at Kumguri in Assams Kokrajhar district\n\nKokrajhar, Feb. 28: Piqued at being kept waiting for peace talks with Delhi, the National Democratic Front of Boroland is now playing hard to get.\n\nThe Bodo militant group has backed out of a meeting tomorrow of the joint ceasefire monitoring group, citing a list of grievances ranging from truce violations by police to the governments reluctance to formally invite its leaders to a round of peace talks.\n\nThe NDFB's information and publicity secretary, S. Sanjarang, said today that the outfit would not even consider sitting for talks until the government clarified its position on some issues. He cited three instances of unarmed NDFB members being targeted, twice allegedly by police officers.\n\nThe outfit would like to know whether penal action has been initiated against Jayanta Basumatary and Jayanta Kalita, the former officers-in-charge of Sapatgram police station in Dhubri and Dokmoka police outpost in Karbi Anglong, for allegedly killing unarmed members, Sanjarang said.\n\nAnother police officer was accused of conspiracy. What action will the government take against P.K. Dutta, the superintendent of police in Baksa, who is hand-in-glove with Hitesh Basumatary, the BTC executive member, in inciting fratricidal killings? the militant leader asked.\n\nThe third question pertained to the murder of an NDFB member at Medhaghat in Baksa district in March last year.\n\nSanjarang said the NDFB also wanted information about its vice-president, Dhiren Boro.\n\nWhat is the government doing about B. Sungthagra alias Dhiren Boro, who has been languishing in Gangtok jail for the last five years? Is it not the responsibility of the government to arrange for his release on the ground that the party which he leads is in ceasefire with it? the publicity secretary asked. He said the government should not expect the NDFB leadership to agree to talks without a written invitation. We cannot accept wireless messages sent to the police as an official invitation to any meeting. A letter has to be issued.\n\nThe NDFBs complaints about being targeted and taken for granted coincided with another member, N. Muluksa, being injured in firing by unidentified assailants at Aila Chowk in Baksa district around 4.30pm. The outfit declared a 12-hour statewide bandh tomorrow to protest the incident.\n\nSanjarang insisted that all NDFB members had been abiding by the ground rules of the ceasefire since it took effect. But it has been observed that government forces are repeatedly violating the ground rules and committing unprovoked killings. The matter has been raised in meetings of the joint monitoring group earlier and the government has done nothing so far.\n\nThe NDFB called a truce in October 8, 2004.\n\nTrouble on Assam boundary A STAFF REPORTER The Telegraph\n\nGuwahati, Feb. 28: Assam will lodge a protest with Nagaland for the neighbouring states move to set up polling stations in the disturbed Assam border (DAB) areas. Nagaland has already set up election offices in the A, B and C sectors of the disturbed areas and has now initiated the process of setting up polling stations as well. Flags of political parties are seen fluttering at Old Leukha, New Leukha, New Runi Basti, Old Runi Basti, Haiyan and in the foothills of D sector. Assam home commissioner Rajib Bora visited the states border areas with Nagaland on Tuesday after the Golaghat district administration apprised Dispur of the development.\n\nGolaghat additional superintendent of police B.B. Gogoi said an inquiry was on to ascertain how many polling stations Nagaland was planning to set up and exactly where. We have seen them setting up election campaign booths in the disputed areas, he confirmed. He said if Dispur gives the go ahead, police would dismantle the polling stations inside Assams territory. A Sarupathar police official said there were reports that Naga politicians were bribing Assamese villagers residing in the disturbed areas to vote for them. Their names have already been included in the voters list of that state. Dhansiri sub-divisional police officer Bolin Deuri said the DAB area was also becoming a base for militant outfits.\n\nShopkeepers decry extortion bids By Our Staff Reporter Sangai Express\n\nIMPHAL, Feb 28: With an earnest appeal not to make monetary demands from shopkeepers doing business at Lamlong Bazar for their livelihood, shopkeepers of Lamlong Bazar staged a protest sitting today.\n\nDuring the protest sitting participated by shopkeepers and women vendors of Khurai Lamlong Bazar, all the markets and shops remained closed.\n\nTalking to the media, some of the protesters conveyed that they are not well to do or big business establishments.

Das said, for four consecutive years Burmese delegates have taken part in the trade fair, and recounted last year's participation as saying, \"Last year a big delegation from Myanmar [Burma] visited the 14th trade affair.\"\n\nBesides Burma, delegates from Thailand, UAE, Czech Republic, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Turkey will join Indian traders in the fair and show case their products, Das added.\n\nIn 2007, a 31-member Burmese delegation attended the trade fair and signed a memorandum of understanding with the Assam and Manipur states of India for better trade relationship.\n\nFrans on 02.29.08 @ 06:39 AM CST [link]\n\nAPO speaks its mind on unification The Morung Express\n\nAPO speaks its mind on unification The Morung Express\n\nDimapur, February 27 (MExN): Emerging to make its stand clear over the issue of Naga unification, the Angami Public Organization today issued a statement supporting the concept of unification. However, the apex Angami organization also made clear that all Nagas should be equally represented in the initiative for unification as well that respect should be accorded to each others territories and boundaries to restore hope and confidence in the people. The statement, appended by the organizations chief executives, also reminded that unification cannot be forced on the people by anger, threat and extortion or by the barrel of the gun.\n\nThe Angami Public Organization stated: The APO firmly holds the view that while the goal of unification is most important, the means to achieve the goal is no less vital, if not more. It is necessary that all the Naga tribes join hands together in the task because the Naga tribes must be equally represented in the initiative. Unification envisages peaceful co-existence with mutual respect for one anothers traditional territories and boundaries because there is no territory known as no-mans land anywhere throughout the breadth and length of the Naga contiguous inhabited areas.\n\nThe APO also reminded one and all in concern that unification cannot be imposed, dictated or forced upon the people by anger, threat and extortion or by the barrel of the gun. Because, the APO reminded, unification in the Naga context is part of the process of healing the souls of the Nagas. Any national dream not fuelled by God cannot stand the test of time it reminded.\n\nIn summary, the APO set forth its points of stand: Initiatives of unification should be broad-based so as to include all the Naga tribes and uphold Naga brotherhood. Peace and reconciliation among the political factions must precede unification initiatives so as to stop all forms of violence and fratricidal killings among Nagas. The Naga tribes must have mutual respect for one anothers traditional territories and boundaries so as to restore hope and confidence among the people.\n\nWhile agreeing that unification of the war-torn Nagas is the need of the hour to ensure their survival, the APO however expressed support to any initiative for the Nagas reconstruction and unification, based on the principles of Naga brotherhood, tolerance, peace and reconciliation acceptable to all Nagas.\n\nAR cracks whip in Nagaland; NSCN cadres held with arms, cash\n\nSource: The Sangai Express / Newmai News Network\n\nKohima, February 26: The Assam Rifles, during the last few days of intensified patrolling, to ensure environmental security during the forthcoming election has nabbed four underground cadres along with five arms, ammunition and cash amounting to Rs 22.24 lakhs.\n\nConfirming the report today in Kohima, Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Inspector General of Assam Rifles-North (IGAR-N), Major Pallab Chaudhury issued a statement stating that Assam Rifles have intensified security all over the State with increased patrolling of vantage points, establishing Mobile Vehicle Check Posts (MVCPs) and frisking of vehicles which have already yielded results.\n\nAR troops in collaboration other security agencies are carrying out combing operations day and night to ensure no underground elements are able to carry out any nefarious activities which lead to harassment of the innocent civilians.\n\nDuring the drive, personnel of 18 Assam Rifles apprehended one NSCN (IM) cadre and three civilians along with one AK-47 and two 9mm pistol today. During an operation led by 31 AR, Dimapur, troops apprehended a NSCN (Unified) cadre along with Rs 24,000 in cash besides several extortion notes and documents. AR patrols have also evicted NSCN (K) cadres from Yanongyimsen village while NSCN (IM) cadres were forced out of village Samjuram under Peren district. NSCN (IM) armed cadres moving in the general area Cheplema (near Piphima village) were also countered by AR patrols and eventually evicted from the civilian locality.\n\nOn February 25, the MVCP established by 42 AR at Zubza intercepted suspected NSCN (Unified) cadre along with a 7.65mm pistol, while the intensified follow-up search led to further apprehension of a NSCN (IM) cadre with one AK-47 rifles at Kukidolong along the National highway-39.Mobile area domination patrol of 37 AR apprehended two NSCN (K) cadres in uniform from Mon super market area, he stated.\n\nEarlier, on February 23, MVCP of 42 AR deployed at Zubza intercepted a Gypsy bearing regd.\n\nNo.NL01-8059 and recovered Rs.16 lakhs meant for use in election purposes. Addition stepped up vigil yielded further results when suspiciously moving Tata Safari Regn No AS01-C-6566 was intercepted by MVCP of 42 AR at Kukidolong which led to cash recovery of Rs.6 lakhs.\n\nIn addition to these, the Assam Rifles have managed to seize smuggled liquor at various check points established. On February 22, MVCP of 30 AR at Desai confiscated six cases of rum while 37 AR at Naginimora intercepted 128 bottles of IMFL which was destroyed in Situ. 37 AR at Tizit recovered five cases of IMFL from a NST bus during the course of surprise check.\n\nOn February 25, a huge consignment of IMFL � 1016 bottles of rum, 206 bottles of beer was confiscated by 27 AR at MVCP Atoizu, Zunheboto. The same was destroyed in the presence of Police. In addition to this contraband ganja weighing 80 kgs was also intercepted by troops of 37 AR at Nagini-mora, which was subsequently handed over to the police and destroyed in their presence, said the statement.\n\nAR statement also said that instructions have been issued to Commanders at all levels to maintain strict vigil and keep area of responsibility under round the clock surveillance with an overall aim to ensure peace and instill confidence within the public at the same time resorting to stringent actions to curb elements trying to vitiate and disrupt the election process early next month.\n\nSumi Hoho support Naga unification- Nagaland post\n\nThe Sumi Hoho facilitated and supports the ongoing Naga unification to bring all warring factions under one political organization so as to completely stop bloodshed and fratricidal killing.\n\nGen. Zuheto Swu in his Patriot Day speech on 4th August'2001 stated that from 1954-1964, 485 Naga national armies were killed by the Indian Security Forces. These people can be called patriots, because they were killed by the enemy for the cause. He said that he has recorded the names and where they were killed by the Indian Security Forces.\n\nFrom 1964-1990, there was silence in the Naga political movement and peace prevailed in Nagaland. But again from 1990, another new political dimension erupted among the Naga underground setup. Because of this factionalism, Naga underground were fighting among themselves, killing each other. We Nagas professed Nagaland for Christ, but taking the name of Christ, fratricidal killing started unabated. The Nagas claimed that thousands and thousands had sacrificed their lives for our motherhood and called them as patriots? I would say, we are murderers; no one will kill his own brothers.\n\nIf you trace back the revolutionary history of the world, there has been always two groups struggle for sovereignty. To take few examples, in Russia, there were two revolutionary groups, one under the leadership of Lenin, ie, Bolshevik. Bolshevik wanted to secure freedom from Czardom by means of non-violence. Another revolutionary party was called the Menshevik under the leadership of Kerensky wanted to achieve their goal by means of violence. But though they had different approach for their freedom, they did not fight among themselves. Both the political wings fought against Czarist to attain their goal. Same is the example of Indian political struggle. Mahatma Gandhi followed the path of non-violence and Satyagraha which ultimately brought freedom for India. But Subash Chandra Bose wanted to attain freedom through the means of violence and organized Azad Hind Fauj. But there was no record that they fought themselves. But we Nagas though our ultimate goal is the same \"Sovereignty\", we fought among ourselves in the name of sovereignty.\n\nNow what is the political salvation for the Nagas? It is only through the unification of all Naga underground factions, peace tranquility and prosperity will prevail in Nagaland. There are only two choices for the Nagas. We have to choose between bloodshed and peace. If we want to live in peace and harmony, we have no other option than \"unification of all factions\". With this end Sumi Hoho and Sumi public are working hard to bring peace in Nagaland.\n\nIn 1793, one of the organizers of the Girodin Club, Roland was suspected to be traitor and she was leading her way to Scaffold remarks: \"O Liberty, how many crimes are committed in thy name\".\n\nThe saying goes, \"A troubled mind often the product of a troubled soul\". Our souls are in trouble but we blame our mind. Let us clean our souls then our mind will be in peace.\n\nHokishe Yepthomi, president of Sumi Hoho.\n\nAmerican-style campaign in Nagaland OUR CORRESPONDENT The Telegraph\n\nKohima, Feb. 26: Hillary Clinton and Barak Obama are not the only ones sparring at election debates. Election candidates in Nagaland, too, are learning what Clinton feels like on being snubbed by her main political rival. Taking a cue from the American presidential elections, various organisations, especially students unions, have come forward to bring their local candidates to a common platform to interact with the people as well as the candidates.\n\nKohima village  the second biggest village in Asia  witnessed such a common platform today, where the three candidates from the Northern Angami-I Assembly constituency tried to outspeak each other in front of the audience. The platform was, however, a very tame affair with all the candidates  Shurhozelie Leizietsu of Nagaland Peoples Front, Seyiekuolie Angami (Congress) and Prasielie Angami (Independent)  voicing their poll promises and avoiding controversies. While all the three pitched for adequate employment avenues for youths and uplifting poor people and farmers, the NPF and Congress candidates stressed more on the need to facilitate the peace process between the Centre and the Naga outfits. Prasielie, who resigned as the Nagaland Youth Congress president to contest as an Independent after he was denied party ticket, said it was time for the Naga youths to arise and take the lead in the all fields.\n\nThe audience was, however, least bothered about peace talks, or for that matter, youth and womens empowerment. What mattered to them most was better roads, adequate water, uninterrupted power supply, better healthcare facilities and proper implementation of schemes for the farmers. Todays programme was jointly organised by the Kohima Village Students Union and Kohima Village Youth Organisation  the two most powerful organisations of the village. In another such meeting held recently at Phek, the candidates were asked to sign a paper promising to serve the people with utmost sincerity if elected. All the candidates promised to properly utilise the welfare schemes, construct roads and communication links, implement schemes for the farmers and generate employment opportunities for youths.\n\nA senior student leader from Kohima village, Neibu Angami, however, appeared doubtful about the promises of the candidates to provide the youths with jobs. Citing the failure of the 25,000-job opportunity programme announced by then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, he said, Hardly any Naga youths got jobs under the special package in the right way.\n\nHis friend Mhalezolie Kire, a social worker, said common platforms are important but added that they did not seem to have worked till now, accusing the candidates of shying away from promises. He said the idea would not work in the state as the candidate with the most money to offer the people will win. Whoever spends more money will win the elections, Kire said.\n\nVikheto Sumi, another social activist, said the present unrest and antisocial activities in the state were the direct result of the widened gap in the Naga society between the haves and have-nots, and majority of the people are deprived of the welfare programmes.\n\nGovt willing to go extra mile for peace in Nagaland Financial Express Kohima, Feb 27 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the UPA government was willing to go the extra mile to bring permanent peace in Nagaland, where the masses fed up with violence and want to be the part of an overall process of development and change in the country.\n\nAddressing a well-attended election rally here on Wednesday, the PM said, Development requires peace, stability and security and we alone are sincerely committed to bring a lasting peace to the north-eastern region, in particular Nagaland.\n\nWe have been open and liberal in our approach and are hopeful that we will succeed in our efforts towards finding an honourable solution, he told an election rally here. Singh, however, did not make any reference to contentious issue of integration of Naga inhabited areas.\n\nThe Congress party election manifesto has expressed its commitment to pursue implementation of the 16-point agreement of 1960 which in a clause mentions integration of contiguous Naga inhabited areas of the region. PTI\n\nWilling to go the extra mile to solve Naga problem Sushanta Talukdar The Hindu\n\nNiephiu Rio government has completely failed the people in the last five years, says Manmohan Singh\n\nKohima: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday said the Congress was willing to go the extra mile to find an honourable solution to the Naga problem and bring long-lasting peace to Nagaland.\n\nAddressing an election rally here on his maiden visit to Nagaland, he said: We have been engaged in a peaceful dialogue with disaffected groups to bring long-lasting peace. We have been open and liberal in our approach and are hopeful that we will succeed in our efforts. We were willing to go the extra mile for this purpose.\n\nDr. Singh assured the people that the Congress would do whatever is required to address all the genuine aspirations of the Naga people. Nagaland needs a period of peace and stability so that the Naga people can devote all their energies to their cultural, educational, social and economic development.\n\nFed up with violence\n\nThe people of the State, he said, were fed up with violence and they wanted to be part of the overall process of development and change. Development requires peace, stability and security. We alone are sincerely committed to bringing lasting peace to this region and, in particular, to Nagaland.\n\nDr. Singh urged the voters to change the ineffective and inefficient Democratic Alliance of Nagaland (DAN) government led by Niephiu Rio. He alleged that the Rio government had completely failed the people in the last five years.\n\nFor the last five years, Nagaland has been under a hotchpotch coalition of different political parties under the DAN. They do not have a common ideology. They do not have a common agenda. Each one of them pulls in a different direction. What is common among them is a desire to be in power.\n\nAlleging that there was no rule of law, the Prime Minister said: A government which could not provide security to its people has no right to get the support of the people again.\n\nDr. Singh claimed that his party alone could provide a stable, united and efficient government, deliver on its promises and live up to the trust that the people of Nagaland repose on it.\n\nAICC general secretary Margaret Alva, Congress Legislature Party leader I. Imkong and Pradesh Congress Committee president Hokheto Sumi spoke. Earlier, Dr. Singh was accorded a warm welcome and presented a dress of a traditional warrior of the Angami Naga tribe.\n\nUNC in manifesto chorus OUR CORRESPONDENT The telegraph\n\nImphal, Feb. 27: The United Naga Council (UNC) has condemned the Manipur Assemblys resolution taken against the Nagaland Congress manifesto, saying there was nothing wrong in including the demand for integration of Naga-inhabited areas.\n\nThe Manipur Assembly on February 22 adopted a private members resolution asking the AICC to withdraw the demand for integration from the Nagaland Congress manifesto. The manifesto said the Nagaland Congress would continue to remind the Centre of the need to implement the 16-point statehood agreement, including Clause 13 concerning Naga integration, in letter and spirit.\n\nAICC secretary Siddharth Patil said the AICC was committed to implementing the 16-point agreement. Another AICC general secretary Margaret Alva ruled out any change in the manifesto evoking sharp reactions from the Manipur Peoples Party, which had moved the private members resolution.\n\nThe UNC notes with seriousness the hue and cry raised in the Manipur Legislative Assembly over the inclusion of the 16-point agreement in the Nagaland PCC manifesto and passing of the private members resolution, UNC publicity secretary S. Milan said in a statement today.\n\nThe statement said the 16-point agreement was a pact between the Centre and the Naga Peoples Convention and New Delhis commitment was yet to be implemented. It is the wish of the Nagaland PCC to include it in its manifesto and we see nothing wrong in it. We condemn and oppose the Manipur Legislative Assembly in particular for always trying to object to the wishes of the Naga people, he said.\n\nThe five members sponsored by the UNC did not raise any objection when the House adopted the resolution. The UNC said it was not happy with the way the Naga MLAs failed in opposing the private members resolution, which aimed at opposing the Naga integration movement on the floor of the House. We caution them (Naga MLAs) not to repeat the mistakes for they will be accountable to the people, the statement said.\n\nPM avoids Naga integration issue at Kohima poll rally Oken Jeet Sandham Kangla\n\nKohima, Feb 27: Indian Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh has tactfully avoided mentioning the contentious Naga integration issue while addressing a mammoth Congress Party election rally here at Kohima Local Ground on Tuesday. He however assured the people of Nagaland that the Congress Party would do \"whatever is required to address all the genuine aspirations of the Naga people.\"\n\nIt may be mentioned that the election manifesto of the Nagaland Pradesh Congress Committee (NPCC) that said the \"Indian National Congress in Nagaland will continue to urge upon the Government of India the need to implement the 16-Point Agreement of 1960 in letter and spirit,\" had already created furor in neighboring Manipur demanding even to the extent of removing the text from the \"manifesto.\"\n\nDwelling mostly on the ongoing peace process, the Prime Minister said his Government had been engaged in a \"purposeful dialogue\" with disaffected groups to try and bring a \"long lasting peace to Nagaland.\" \"We have been open and liberal in our approach and are hopeful that we will succeed in our efforts for an honorable solution,\" he said adding, \"We are wiling to go the extra mile for this purpose.\"\n\nStating that the people of Nagaland were fed up with violence, Dr Singh maintained that the people wanted to be part of the overall process of development and change. The people wanted to benefit from the new opportunities being created, as their economy moved forward, he said. \"Nagaland needs an era of peace and stability so that Naga people can devote all their energies to their cultural, educational, social and economic development,\" he pointed out.\n\nTelling the people that he would like them to live a life of \"dignity, a life of self-respect, a life of prosperity and peace and a life of greater creativity and enterprise, the Prime Minister further assured that the Congress party would do whatever was required to address all the \"genuine aspirations of the Naga people.\"\n\nReminding the people of Nagaland as to how the Congress Party from the days of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had special affection for them, Dr Singh said it was Nehru who had the foresight to recognize the \"distinct identity of the Naga people and gave statehood to Nagaland.\" \"Nehruji wanted Nagas to maintain their distinct identity and genius,\" he added. Later, under the inspiring leadership of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Nagaland saw a new era of development. She and later, Rajiv Gandhi were deeply committed to the welfare, the well-being and the empowerment of the people of Nagaland. \"It is this proud tradition of abiding commitment to Nagaland`s development, to peace and security for every person in this state that we continue today in the Congress Party, under the inspiring leadership of our party president, Sonia Gandhi,\" the Prime Minister narrated.\n\nUrging the people of Nagaland to strengthen their hands and Sonia Gandhi`s as well to vote for the Party (Congress) and to vote for peace and prosperity in Nagaland, Dr Singh expressed belief that the future for the State was with the Congress party.\n\nCongress Promise On Naga Unity Raises Heat Newspost India\n\nAhead of the March 5 assembly polls in Nagaland, the Congress has promised to push for integration of Naga areas in the northeast. But other parties in the region are opposing the idea tooth and nail. The move has been vehemently protested not just by groups in Manipur that are wary of losing territory to Nagaland but has drawn the ire of outfits in Assam as well.\n\n'The Congress may be trying to woo voters by promising to integrate Naga areas in the region with Nagaland state, but we won't let this poll promise turn into reality. Not an inch of Assam territory would be parted with,' Apurba Bhattacharya, leader of the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), Assam's main opposition party, said in Guwahati.\n\nA powerful student group in Assam, the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP), has also said it is dangerous that the Congress in Nagaland is pursuing the same line as a frontline militant group on the Naga integration issue.\n\n'It is a threat to Assam. The Congress is talking in the same language as that of the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-IM),' AJYCP general secretary Manoj Baruah said.\n\nIn Nagaland, however, the Congress, which is pitted against its main rival, the regional Nagaland People's Front (NPF), is hoping to capitalise on Naga sentiments on the integration issue and take the wind out of the opposition sails.\n\nA total of 1.3 million voters are to exercise their franchise March 5 and the counting is scheduled for March 8. More than 90 percent of the state's nearly two million people are Christians.\n\nThe Congress, which has made this promise in its election manifesto, has actually succeeded in making the subject of integration an election issue, forcing rival parties to take note.\n\nThe NPF has said the party would go beyond the integration issue and is talking of the need for a permanent solution of the Naga problem.\n\n'We have to go beyond integration. What is needed is an acceptable solution to the Naga problem,' NPF secretary general Chubatemjen Ao said, referring to a solution to the Naga insurgency issue.\n\nThe Congress' promise to unify the Naga areas in the region may be nothing but a poll plank, but it has triggered off a controversy because the rebel NSCN faction headed by Isak Chishi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah has been pushing for the same demand.\n\nThe NSCN-IM's demand for integration of Naga-inhabited areas in Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh with the Naga-dominated state of Nagaland is being bitterly opposed by governments and parties outside Nagaland.\n\nManipur, in fact, had witnessed a mass uprising in June 2001 with protestors burning down the state assembly building and dozens of other government property after the centre announced the extension of the ceasefire with the NSCN-IM to areas outside Nagaland.\n\nThat decision was seen as the first step by New Delhi before dismembering Manipur and including the state's Naga areas with adjoining Nagaland. The centre eventually withdrew this plan after massive street violence in capital Imphal that culminated in 18 protestors being killed in police firing in June 2001\n\nUndemocratic Poll morungexpress\n\nAs a people known for their honesty and hard work, rooted in a culture of individual integrity and societys solidarity, Nagas today find themselves in the grip of alien systems, which we are unable to come to terms with. The western political concepts of majority democracy and elections because of their fixation with materialism and power struggles, has spawned a vicious cycle of greed, antagonisms, exploitation and social anarchy. And this is best demonstrated during so called democratic elections that we are witnessing today in Nagaland. This is indeed a travesty of truthpolitics without principles; wealth without work; business without morality; knowledge without character and power without conscience. This is the sorry state of affairs that plague us today.\n\nThe despicable resort to intimidation and muscle power during electioneering in Nagaland is a cause for concern and needs to be condemned by all right thinking people. While supporters of various political parties and the respective candidates have every right to campaign in a peaceful and democratic manner, any form of intimidation and resort to violence goes against the tenets of a civilized society. As such, reports of large scale violence reported from Mokokchung district is a matter of concern deserving urgent attention of the concerned authorities and civil society. The State government must be reminded again to ensure free and fair polls and that no untoward incident occurs, which may lead to loss of life and damage to property.\n\nWhat was most shameful of those resorting to violence yesterday was the complete disrespect shown to the goodwill gesture of the Ao Baptist Arogo Mungdang (Ao Baptist Churches Council) who had only hours earlier conducted a prayer fellowship at Impur (landmark of Christianity) with all the candidates for the coming assembly election under Mokokchung district present. Ironically, election related violence, with particular reference to Mokokchung district, and the appeal to abhor from it was a major subject that found space in each of the candidates prayer points. Likewise, the message from the Church to the invited candidates was to revere and adhere to Christian principles.\n\nIt is with great dismay that we note the series of poll related violence reported from across the State particularly Mokokchung district, considered to be among the first to receive the benefits of education and Christianity. As a matter of fact, the first sign of violence much ahead of the coming assembly election was reported from Tuli under Mokokchung district. And as election draws nearer, this so called forward looking district among the Nagas is at the center of most poll related violence taking place in the State. This is something that the Nagas in general and the Aos in particular should not be proud of.\n\nIt is equally distressing to note the involvement of armed cadres belonging to the underground groups freely partaking in the frenzy and lure of money. Force and coercion cannot be allowed to determine the outcome of choosing peoples representative and therefore the involvement of armed cadres using intimidation and bullying tactics is completely unacceptable. It is surprising that although the underground groups have officially declared not to involve in the current electioneering process, yet it is an open secret that this stand to remain apolitical is turning out to be a sham. It also goes to show that either there is confusion in the rank and file of the concerned organization or worse still, it shows that the top rung leaders are not able to exercise command and control over their wayward cadres. The UG leadership should show more seriousness to enforce its own decision. Also there is a need for everyone to remain vigilant against those who propagate a culture of violence driven by their ideology of power by any means.\n\nImkong using police, NSCN-IM: NPF Nagaland Post\n\nDIMAPUR, FEB 27 (NPN): Making serious allegations against CLP leader I.Imkong, the NPF under 29 Jangpetkong has drawn the attention of the Chief Election Commissioner Gopalaswami on the alleged use of 22 police personnel attached to I.Imkong to terrorise NPF supporters in league NSCN(I-M) activists under 29 Jangpetkong constituency.\n\nAccording to NPF Mangkolemba unit president Nuchet, the police personnel were identified as: ABSI Imrong (5th NAP), Hav. Katikaba (5th NAP), Hav. Alingba (2nd NAP), C/N Talinokcha (7th NAP), ASI Temsulemba (DEF Phek), UBI Temsunochet (DEF Kiphire), UBI Onenlepden (DEF Zunheboto), UBC Tekanangshi (DEF Mokokchung), UBC Aotsungba (DEF Mokokchung), L/NR Lanuyabang (7th NAP), C/N Limaysungchet (SB Mokokchung), C/N Temsuakum (2nd NAP), Hav. Mayangmendong (DEF Mon), C/N Imkongnochet (NAP), SI Apongtoba (DEF KIphire), C/N Jangdongshashi (6th NAP), C/N Imtinoktsung (2nd NAP), C/N Bendangnochet (2nd NAP), C/N Lanuwapang (2nd NAP), C/N Tekasunup (SB Kohima), C/N Tionglepden (2nd NAP) and C/N Lolenangba (2nd NAP).\n\nFurther, Nuchet alleged that the above police personnel were seen moving around in same vehicles with NSCN (I-M) men led by Maongtoshi (tatar), Remajemba (tatar) and Lipok (tatar).\n\nHe also alleged that all weapons in the possession of the 22 police personnel were arranged and supplied by Imkong and his trusted coteries.\n\nIt was also stated that on Tuesday, February 26 at around 6 a.m., the armed personnel attacked the NPF office at Mangkolemba in police uniform and used explosives and automatic weapons. The NPF said, IRB stationed at Mangkolemba intervened and arrested a suspected NSCN (I-M) activist alongwith a pistol from the house of a shopkeeper identified as one Rongpangkumba and also seized one AK-47, a service revolver and few explosives.\n\nHowever, instead of seizing the arms and arresting the five persons who were in the house, the SDPO Mangkolemba and the commander of IRB allowed the suspected NSCN (I-M) activist to escape. The NPF said the IRB jawans had vehemently protested against the decision which led to an open altercation between the IRB jawans and the officers in full view of the public. The NPF also alleged that on Tuesday evening around 4 p.m, another armed group in six Gypsies attacked Khar village from Mopungchuket side after crossing the Milak river.\n\nIt said the bomb which they were carrying accidentally exploded critically injuring a number of Congress workers and some of the armed attackers, who were shifted to Mokokchung hospital for treatment. Demanding immediate enquiry into the incidents, arrest of the personnel involved and suspension of the police officers for allowing the armed personnel to escape from Mangkolemba, the NPF said public were ready to give evidence of the involvement of police personnel.\n\nHypocrisy of elections Nagarealm.com\n\nThe Chief Election Commission has set a spending limit of Rs 5 lakh per candidate. State election commissioners are trying their best to keep track of each candidates expenditure. But there are money transactions between the voters and the candidates, which the local election authorities cannot detect and perhaps are not keen to unearth.\n\nAlmost every candidate in Meghalaya has expended at the very least Rs 6 to Rs 10 lakh at this point of time. They would require a fresh replenishment of funds from their respective parties and from individual funding sources for the last leg of the campaign. It is part of the election ritual for candidates to have an open house where food and drinks flow freely. Everyday, at least 100 supporters would be eating lunch and dinner. A candidate who tries to cut down on such hospitality will soon find himself isolated. In fact, the measure of a candidates popularity is the noise and fanfare that happens in his house and the number of people who come and go on a daily basis. Word spreads very quickly when the crowd at a particular candidates house begins to thin. Rumours are then set afloat that his/her popularity is on the wane.\n\nStar campaigners While a section of the intelligentsia is trying to spread the message of issue-based election to the voting public, this campaign is still a cry in the wilderness. As the star campaigners from Delhi descend one after the other on Meghalayan soil, voters may forget what they should actually be voting for. Sonia Gandhi raised a shrill campaign pitch in Jowai and Tura, leaving Shillong for the more composed and non-rhetorical Dr Manmohan Singh. Union minister for information and broadcasting Priya Ranjan Das Munshi is camping there to woo the non-tribal voters in their enclaves. It is doubtful that the non-tribal voter will buy into what Das Munshi says. After all, they are the more enlightened category of voters and know exactly what to expect from which candidate.\n\nIt is the tribal voter, especially in the rural areas, who could possibly be swayed by sentiments and filibuster. On Friday, the Khun Hynniewtrep National Awakening Movement (KHNAM) candidate had a public meeting at Smit where party stalwart and minister for urban affairs Paul Lyngdoh, known to be a master of rhetoric, took a dig at all political parties. Defending his partys support for the Meghalaya Democratic Alliance (MDA) government, he termed the KHNAM as a small party that acted as the brakes on the MDA vehicle and prevented it from speeding like a roller-coaster into disaster. The irrational crowd obviously loves such election wisecracks and applauded each time Lyngdoh delved into his kitty of wit and dark humour. No issues of concern were expounded for discussion by the electorate. It was a speech-making exercise designed to suit the mental capacities of the poor and illiterate voters. A similar speech in Shillong city would have cut no ice. This is the hypocrisy of elections. You devise different speeches for different sets of listeners.\n\nRural voters Travelling to the villages, especially those areas of Meghalaya where broomstick harvesting is on in full swing and farmers are parking themselves away from their hearths and homes in temporary sheds closer to the broomstick farms, the awareness about candidates is almost non-existent. Many know only the name of their sitting MLA but very little about the other candidates, much less about their symbols. If this is the 21st century for Shillong or Kohima, the rural voter is still living in the dark ages. On voting day, they will only go to the pooling booth if a candidate provides a vehicle and takes them there. In several villages, the nearest polling booth is quite a distance away. Only the enthusiastic camp followers would trudge the extra mile to cast their votes.\n\nLife in rural Meghalaya has changed very little since 1972, when the state was born. If there are changes, they are all for the worse. Large-scale deforestation  forests are the only sources of income  is visible in large parts of the state. There are indications that some villages have dipped even further below the poverty line because of low awareness about birth control. The average family size in rural Meghalaya is between eight and 10. It is a common narrative of women boasting that they have delivered a dozen or more kids. Obviously, the kids are all undernourished and barely have clothes to wear. To talk about education for such a family seems criminal because they can just about afford two square meals a day.\n\nThe Sarva Shikshya Aviyaan, which aims at bringing all children to school, and the midday meal scheme to retain those children in school have all suffered from lack of monitoring and supervision. Most upper primary schools, middle and high schools are located at least 3km away from the villages. Unless government thinks of boarding schools, it will be too taxing for children to be trudging 6km every day. That village kids still do not have access to senior schools is itself a stark reminder that MLAs have not cared enough for education. Yet this should have been the priority if MLAs were really committed to their electorate.\n\nTalk about health care and the scenario is even more dismal. Lack of proper health care impinges especially on women and those in the child bearing years. Only less than 40 per cent women in Meghalaya deliver a child under the supervision of a healthcare provider. The rest depend on dhais and other semi-trained midwives. Often women die because of complicated labour since they have no access to a hospital or a health centre. Not a single candidate discusses these crucial matters. Water and sanitation and the road-map to water sufficiency is not in the agenda of many candidates. All of them are harping on employment generation without actually spelling out how they will go about achieving this noble goal.\n\nUrban poverty Malcolm Tariang, an independent candidate from Laitumkhrah constituency, one of the leading localities of Shillong has come up with a swish tool kit for the voters. This is likely to go down well with the educated, suave, tech-savvy voter. But there are pockets in Laitumkhrah which are declared as slums and successive representatives have failed to address this phenomenon. Urban poverty in this locality is on the rise. This constituency also has a huge chunk of Mazhabi Sikhs, whose habitat is still pejoratively termed the Sweepers Colony.\n\nThose who have won the Laitumkhrah seat have done so on the strength of the non-tribal votes. All the eight candidates are desperately wooing this attractive chunk hoping that they would vote en-bloc. But whether any group actually votes en-bloc is the moot point. With two weeks to go before the final countdown candidates are using every trick of the trade and pulling all the stops to ensure their win. Failing to make any impression with the voters the Congress has unabashedly roped in Indian Idol 3 runner-up Amit Paul to woo voters.\n\nBut definitely the most crucial game in this last leg and what could possibly upset the fortunes of many is the ubiquitous envelope passed through a warm handshake. Candidates will ensure that the crisp notes fall in the hands of their committed vote banks. So long as the CEC has no mechanism to check the circulation of money, voters will be available to the highest bidder. Till such time elections are but a five-yearly fanfare of eating and merry-making of song and dance and finally electing the undeserving candidate because those who are truly committed to public service do not have the money to drive their election campaign.
