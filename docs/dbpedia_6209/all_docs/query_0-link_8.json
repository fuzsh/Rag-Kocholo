B THUCYDIDES IX BOOK I^ AVork on Thucydides published in the last thirty years has mostly shown two tendencies, the one, to regard Thucydides as having two successive attitudes towards history; the other to revert to Eduard Meyer's view that the work as we have it, in all important points of inter- pretation at least, was written at one time and that time after the Fall of Athens. I should say at once that I am sceptical about both these views and also — to go rather farther back in the discussion — I would agree with Pohlenz in doubting the far-reaching acti\\ ity of an ‘ editor ’ who left the end of the eighth book as we have it. Such unity of outlook as the whole work presents — such unity as Prof. Finley has stressed in his Thucydides — seems to me due, not to the work being written or finally shaped all at one time, but to its being written all by one man who from the first had strong and definite ideas and a clear notion of what he was tr\\ ing to do. The tendencies which I have mentioned naturally lead to the conclusion that the first book has been, if not written, yet reshaped or largely added to at a later stage in Thucydides’ career and may reflect a change of view about the causes or antecedents of the war. It seems worth while to e.vamine those parts of the book in which these effects would show thcmsekcs if they e.xist, i.e. chiefly in the speeches and the e.xcursus on the Pentckontactia and its setting.- The archaeologia proper, chapters 1-19, gives reasons for Thucydides’ expectation that the war would be a great one and more notable than any of its predecessors, judging this from the fact that both sides entered it at the height of their preparedness and that the whole Greek world was on one side or the other or contemplating joining one side or the other 1 i, i').* The Western Greeks got no further than this contemplation when the war began and it would be natural to suppose that Thucydides wrote these words when he did not yet know that they would go no further. The main argument of the archaeologia seems to show' how this height of pre- paredness and tendency to fall into two camps was reached, and the last sentence of 19 under- lines the conclusion. I would agree with those who have urged that chapters 20 and 21 are a continuation of the archaeologiamthtiZLxnc. straight line of thought and the last sentence of 21 makes a transition from the archaeologia to the actual events of the war itself and Thucydides’ treatment of them as described in chapter 22. In this chapter we have, as has been more than once observed, a natural interplay of ideas with chapters 20 and 21, e.g. xocAerrd ovra Ttavri TEKppplcp TTiCTTEuaai (20, i) . . ttiv aKpipeiav cturpv tcov Aexflsvrcov 5 iapvr|povEuaai (22, ij; ouTcos ocTocAaiTTCopos toTs ttoAAoTs f) ^tittictis Tijs dAriSeiag (20, 3) . . ettittovcos 5e rjupierKETO (22, 3) ; CTti TO TtpoCTOcycoyoTspov Tij aKpodoEi f| dArjOEcrTEpov (21, i) . . . es psv ttiv dKpoaaiv iCTOs TO pfi pu6c65es outcov dTspiTEOTEpov (22, 4) ; drr’ ccurcov tcov Epycov oxoTtouai (21, 2} . . . oooi bs ( 3 ouAf|CTOVTai tcov . . yEvopsveov to aaq)£s crKoiTElv (22, 4). It is hard to escape the con- clusion that it is the same Thucydides in the same mood w ho has written all these three chapters. By a natural transition he moves from the justification of his method of dealing with earlier history which establishes w'ith sufficient credibility his belief that the war would surpass its predecessors to the justification of a diflferent claim for his treatment of the war itself, including w'hat each side said either on the eve of w'ar or when engaged in it. What Thucydides claims to attain by the methods which he applies to speeches and to Td £pya tcov irpcxxflEVTcov ev tw ttoAepco is something for his reader’s study, viz. tcov yEvopEvcov to CTa9£S, a study which w'ill be a useful guide in judging the events of the future, for he postulates that human beings will react ^ What follows is largely based on a paper read to the Philological Society of Sir John Beazley’s University in 1945. It has gained by some alterations and omissions due to helpful discussion at the time. .Account has been taken of later published work, as of earlier, even w'hen no specific reference seemed to be required. The obligations of anv student of these questions are too wide and varied to be acknowledged in the space av'ailable. ■ The e.xcursuses on Cylon, Pausanias, and Themistocles do not effect the main issue; and the narrative of actual operations can be seen in much the same light whatever general view is accepted. “ .Vll references to Thucydides in which the Book is not mentioned come from Book I. THUCYDIDES IN BOOK I 3 in the same or similar way to the same or similar situation w'hen it occurs. At whatever precise date Thucydides actually wrote chapter 22 I find it hard to believe that it does not reveal the goal which he set before himself from the start. In view of the difficulties of which Thucydides shows himself aware in that chapter, to oacpEi must, I think, mean to him the result of a process by which, sparing no pains not merely to discover but to understand what was being done and said, undiverted by partiality, untempted by the seductions of a literary artist, he sets himself to attain — not perfect oKpipsia (for that is impossible) but an approximation to it near enough to justify his claim to its practical utility for those who have the mind to use it as it should be used. The statecraft of the future is to be illuminated not so much perhaps by the general education advocated by the sophists as by study in action of the statecraft of what has become the past. If one could ask Thucydides who ^vere those to whom his work would prove useful, he would, I imagine, reply ‘ men of action political and military ’, for to the fifth-century .\\thenian there was hardly any distinction between these activities, and I would imagine that he thought of Td psAAovTa as a series of political and military situations with which a man of action would be concerned. And about all the factors in such situations the future statesmen must be helped to judge by examining to aafeg of all the factors in the similar situations of the past. To take an instance : the emotional and intellectual make-up of a community — ^especially in those communities in which it directly affected State policy — may be an instructive study for any historian : the emotional and intellectual make-up of Athens and of Sparta, as it was or seemed to be in 432, would surely be to Thucydides a topic to be elucidated if one was to be able to examine tcov yEuopevcov to 00925.^ It was a factor in the calculation of a statesman, and the future statesman must know what it was, or seemed to be, if he is to know if it is a like factor in the situation with which he may be faced. And the more persistent it is, the more relevant it may be. In Book VI 1 1 , Thucydides observes that, had the Spartans beenToApqpoTepoi, they might have achieved great things by following up a victory with an immediate attack on the Piraeus. And then he adds that this was not the only instance in ^vhich the Athenians found the Lacedaemonians trduTcov Sf) ^up90pcbTorroi TrpoaTroAspfiaai- ....

To return ; the character of communities as they were, or as they ^v•ere reputed to be, at the time was a factor in any situation in which they were engaged, and a situation that leads to war is one in which this factor would most readily be apparent, and it was, one may suppose, very present to Thucydides’ mind. .And it is a priori probable that Thucydides realised in 432 the factors that affected 432. This does not mean that his political judgment might not ripen. It does not mean that he might not revalue some ideas ® — he may have come to assign more effectiveness to constitutional forms, to study the effect of popular excitement as it presented itself more clearly as the war went on. All this Thucydides might do, but it seems to me that the validity of his definition of his task would not be affected by it. The speeches in the First Book are parts of a long-drawn crisis : if the future statesman was to judge whether a similar crisis of his own day would issue in war and was to find Thucydides’ history a help to him, he must be given tcov yEvopEvcov to aa 9 ES. To estimate the historicity of the debates at Athens and Sparta we have to reconstruct the situation as Thucydides thought it was. We must realise what were to him to aiEi irapovTa so as to see cvhat were to him tcc Seovto TTEpi TCOV aiEi irapovTcov. Equally we have to remember that (as J. E.

The first part of that chapter hardh' concerns us at this moment. ^Vith the second part of the chapter we reach the introduction to the antecedents of the war which to Thucydides included more than the aiTiai of Corcyra and Fotidaea. Of that more will be said presently. It has often been maintained, and it is a \\ icw to which I have adhered in print,® that the famous sentence — Tpy psi/ ydp dAriOsaTccTriv upocpaaiv, d9av£crTcrrriv Se Aoycp, tous ’A6r|vaious fiyoupcn peydAous yiyvopevou?

My own vacillations are of no interest to anyone but myself — and wc remain entitled, indeed oljliged. to make the best judgment we can on the facts known to us about the historical reasons for the outbreak of the war. That is not a matter to be settled by authority, even the authority of Thucydides. But what we arc concerned with at the moment is rimcvdides' \\icw of the situation from which the war sprang. On the statement of the aiTiai and the dAr|6£crTdTr| Ttpocpaaij follows the narratic e 24-31 ! of the events which led to the first debate in the book '32-431. The speeches which appear as those of the Oorcyraeans and Ciorinthians ;ire doubtless based on a real debate which Thucydides may have heard ; and, in any event, tould have found out about), a debate which, at the time or soon after, must have seemed relevtint to his theme, falling in his category of speeches b\\’ those peAAovte; uoAeppaEiv. Granted the Thucydidean style, the omission of details such as the strength of the Coreyracan fleet ' Whiih he has already given in 25, 4), the formal arrangement under the leading topics of to SiKaiov and to ^Opepepov, the thrust and parr\\' of arguments between the two speeches, granted all this, how closely does Thucydides, in these two speeches, keep to q ^upTraaa yveopr) tcov ctAriOwg AexOevtcov, and how far does he confine himself to what could and would be said at the time? In the debate, held in the spring or early summer of 433. the Gorevraeans speak of a general conflict as peAAwv koi octov ou trapcoi; 36, i ) and say . . .

These contrasted statements are in each case to SlovTa trepi tcov TrapovTcov. The apparent anxiety of the Spartans two years before to see the peace preserv ed in the Greek world ^28, i ) does not suggest any general inceptive or dcsidcrative attitude of .Sparta towards war. But for the Corewraeans to say onh that Corinth was hostile to Athens and influential with Sparta was a dangerous line, as Athens might have merely deduced that it would then be well to remove Corinthian ill vvill. Thucydides in the chaj)ter after the debate savs it was thought that, in any event, it would come to war with the Peloponnesians .44, 2), which implies that, right 01 wrong, the Corcyraean view seemed to reflect the situation more accuratelv, at least to a majority of Athenians at the time. 1 hat, later on, many Athenians thought war could be aveited b\\ concessions (139, 4; would not be relevant to Athens' general attitude in 433.

The two possibilities envisaged — the first that the Siceliotes might wish to send a fleet to help the Peloponnesians, the other that the Athenians might wish to send a fleet into Sicilian waters, these possibilities were in fact present.

Corcvra proved an ineffective and wavering ally ot Athens, and after a time relapsed into neutrality. Her government pros ed not to be really stable : her foreign policy proved not to be trustworthy. In the Phormoplioroi of Herinippus, written before 424^ Ihe poet says of the Corcyraeans ‘ May Poseidon destroy them in their hollow ships, for they are double-minded ’ (frag. 63, 11 . 10 -III. Here is an argument, viz. that the Corcyraeans were not allies worth securing — it is not used. It would be based on considerations not present in 433 b.c. It must be admitted that if Thucydides' view of his task as being to present twv yEvopsveov TO aaepeg and his endeavour to keep as close as possible to f) ^upxraaa yvebpr] tcov dApOcog AgySevTCOV inhibit him from importing arguments that could not be used at the time, then the absence of such arguments is no proof that the speeches were not composed a good deal later than the c^■ents with which they are concerned. There are the two possible explanations, the first that Thucy- dides wrote these speeches quite early and the second that, whenever he wrote them, he avoided the anachronism of afterknowledge of later e\\ ents, and these do not necessarily exclude each other : they may be complementary. But if we may suppose that Thucydides' purpose from the start was not merely to relate what happened in the field of action — Tct spya tcov TTpaySevTcov, but also to e.xplain ^vhy it happened in the light of what could be known at the time — for this too belonged to tcov yavopevcov to 00955 — then the burden of proof rests on those \\s ho would suppose that he would not think the present could supply the necessary material for interpre- tation on those lines. And if Eduard Meyer is right in regarding the speeches as the ' Lehens- nerv ’ of Thuevdides' history, it seems hard to suppose that the historian would be content with preparing a narrative of events without adding, as soon as might be, the element that made his history lebensfdhig. I say ‘ as soon as might be ', for there might be good reasons for not reaching the composition of speeches for Bk \\’III and good reasons for the absence of speeches in the stretch of the history between the closing chapters of Bk I\\’ and the Melian dialogue. Also a speech like the Funeral Speech, which has a timeless quality in the sense that it is not part of a situation, may be placed in a category of its own. And now to turn to the speeches on the first conference at Sparta in the autumn of 432.^^ Let us look at these speeches in the light of what was known or could reasonably be conjectured in that year by Thucydides or anybody else. First the speech of the Corinthians. They were themselves moved by anger. Athens had stood in their path over Corcyra as she had done nearly a generation earlier over Megara, when she first aroused Corinth s CT9o5p6v 41005 (103, 4!. .And to the Corinthians a war did not seem a hopeless venture. They knew the superior skill of .Athenian crews, but they dreamt of overcoming that handicap. They had seen an incipient revolt in the .Athenian Empire, and if Potidaea was enabled to hold out this might spread. The attitude of Persia was ambiguous : at least it had been suspected by .Athens at the time of the Samian revolt ( 1 1 5-6) . .Athenian influence was growing in North-AVest Greece and \" The idea tliat used to be supported by the decrees about Rhegium and Leontini passed about this time. viz. that a new or more ambitious .\\thenian conception of western looking policy was concerned in the .Athenian alliance with Corcvra lost its support when \\V. Bauer lA/io, X\\’ ' 1917I 188 f showed that the two decrees were nothing more than the renewal of older treaties in identical form. Forschungen zur alien Geschkhte, II, 380. “ In much of what follows about this debate and that at the second conference I am in agreement with what Pro- fessor Gomme has written in the first volume of his Com- mentary to Thuevdides. When I tvrote what follows and read it at Oxford Professor Gomme's work was still unpublished, and I had no knowledge of its contents. Conversely, though Professor Gomme later read my paper, it tvas after his Commentary had been passed for press. Where our conclusions agree, they were arrived at independently (though I arn naturally strengthened in my opinion bv the agreement ' and I have left my arguments as they then stood. 6 F. E. ADCOCK might injure Corinthian trade there and with Sicily. Moved by this anger, these hopes and fears, Corinth was ready to take the risk of war. But they had to fear the possible inertia of the Lacedaemonians. Two years before Sparta had sought to see the peace kept when she ga\\ e diplomatic support to an attempt to settle the quarrel between Corinth and Corcyra. There was now at Sparta an activist tendency dominant perhaps among the ephors if these, as t6c teAt] toov AocK£6ai|Jovicou, had given promises of inter\\ ention to the cn\\ oys from Potidaea in the previous winter ijS, i). But the Spartans were not knights errant, and nothing that .Athens had done since the Thirty Years Truce directly impinged on Spartan interests. The grievances of Corinth, though real, might well not be enough to sway Sparta to bell so formidable a cat as Athens if she could safely leave it unbelled. What Sparta cared about most was her leadership in mainland Greece, and this Athens under Pericles had accepted in the Thirty Years Truce, and the Spartans were slow to anger at other men’s wrongs. The Megarians and the spokesmen for Aegina too had grievances and urged them. But when the Corinthians’ turn came they had to find more than grievances. They could hint at secession from Spartan leadership and Thucy- dides makes them do so (71, 4-6). But, with the Spartan-Argivc Treaty in force, this threat was not very compelling. \\\\’hat remained was to arouse in the Spartans the fear that their inertia might play into the hands of .Athenian initiative and restless greed for power. To make the power of Athens <p6pov Trap£X£iv, .Athens must be presented as a people that would never be content, born neither to be at peace themselves or let others remain at peace 170). The belief that they were this was also a real factor throughout the whole of the crisis, but it is not irrelevant to this debate. Granted that the formulation of the contrast between .Athens and Sparta is Thucydides’ own, with its sharp almost parado.xical phrasing, it does not seem far remo\\ ed from the line of argument which it would have served the Corinthians’ purpose to pursue. And it seems to contain nothing that was not implicit in the situation as it could be seen and debated in 432. At the same time this speech, together with those that follow, helps to build up a composite picture of the character of the two chief communities concerned, which would not be irrelevant to the understanding of what was to follow. Next the .Athenian speech. It seems fantastic to suppose that there were no .Athenian envoys at Sparta and that no speech was made by one of them. Whether or not .Athens invented the ‘ other business ’ on which they came, so as to discover what was afoot, no one can say (though some do), but Thucydides cannot well ha\\e invented an embassy which so many people still alive would know was an invention. The attitude consistently adopted by .A.thens in 432 was to meet all complaints by a reference to the arbitration clause in the Thirty A’ears Truce and, having done so, to yield to no demand. That at least was the policy of Pericles. It is true that many Athenians thought otherwise, but .Athenian envovs would not venture beyond what could be certain of approval at home. But so far they could go. Herein would lie the most actual part of their speech, and their insistence on Athens’ services to Greece and justification of her empire, couched in Thucydidean almost paradoxically phrased arguments, would not go beyond their brief. VV hile they do not say how Athens would meet a war — a topic on which they could hardly venture — they are made to point out how a Persian invasion did not cow the spirit of the Athenians or make them helpless ( 73 ~ 4 )- The speech, intransigent as is its tone, does reflect what seems to have been in fact the general spirit of Athens at the moment. It was not of the kind to make Athens appear less dangerous to her neighbours. And if we may assume for the moment that the speech of Archidamus which follow's represents the kind of thing he said, it is not irrelevant that he refers to the 9p6vTina of Athens (81,6) which would prevent them from yielding to an invasion and that he refers to their readiness to abide by the arbitra- tion clause (85, 2). Granted that Thucydides may have altered the balance of emphasis, sharpened the dialectic, and stiffened the attitude, there is nothing really improbable in the assumption that there w'as a general adherence to ij ^upTraaa yvebpq tcov dAnfloo? AexOevtcov. Schwartz’s observation that the speech se ems to intrude between the speech of the Das Geschichtswerk des Thukydides, 105. THUCYDIDES IN BOOK I 7 Corinthians and the speech of Archidamus — much of which is an answer to the speech of the Corinthians — does not mean that Schwartz was simply behaving like a Dionysius of Halicarnassus. It is true that, were the speech not there, no modern would have missed it. And it is impossible to deny that the passage (77, 6) about the unpopularity the Spartans might well incur if, having overthrown the Athenian Empire, they took the place of Athens may point to a date of composition later than the Fall of Athens if — as indeed it seems to be — it is an original element in the speech. But the words KaGeAovTS? pnag need not imply knowledge that Athens was overthrown, for it was, at any time in the second half of the fifth century, a necessary preliminary to a Spartan apyp, and the implied reference to Pausanias’ conduct is e\\ idence enough for a probable unpopularity without a knowledge of Lysander’s harmosts. And it may be doubted if Thucydides \\vould have written the generalisation dpsiKTa ydp vd T£ Ka 9 ’ 0 |jias cxuTOug vopipa Tolg dAAoig ex^ts Kai irpoaETi Eig eKacrrog e^icbv out£ Touroig xPfiTai ou9’ oig f) dAAri 'EAAdg vopi3£i 77, 6) without qualification, had he known of the effect of Brasidas' personality on the allies of Athens and felt himself free to use his knowledge. It may be added that, in view of Thucydides’ practice elsewhere, too much can be made of the supposed desirability of Siaaoi Aoyoi on the formal side. And e\\ en so, it might be contended that as the debate is in two phases — one in the presence of the allies, one after their withdrawal, Thucydides might regard two speeches in each phase as desirable. Aly standard of ^\\■hat is wholly fictitious may be unduly high : I cannot say that I think the Athenian speech reaches it. The speech of Archidamus follow's. Archidamus, addressing the Spartans alone, does not concern himself to debate the justice of the allies’ complaints. The .Athenians have been made to say that they did not come before the Spartans as SiKacrrai (73, 1), and the King does not set up to be a SiKaorfig. He proposes sending to Athens and urging the allies’ grievances and declares it is not vopipov to assume the Athenians’ guilt especially as they are ready to go to arbitration (85, 2). As has often been pointed out, this seems to echo the Athenian speech and had no such speech appeared in the debate it would have been more natural for him to say ‘ let us send envoys to make sure of the Athenians’ will to implement the arbitration clause ’. It might be urged that Thucydides is here anticipating the belated bad conscience of the Spartans on this point when they had suffered re\\erses in the war (V, 14, 3). But Archidamus was a man of formal scruples as is seen from his behaviour at Plataea three years later (I I, 74, 2). His belief that the Athenians would not be daunted by invasion, once it happens, and the tacit assumption that the Peloponnesians w ill not be vouchsafed the opportunity to end the war by a more decisive Tanagra, imply Pericles’ control of Athenian strategy ^Vhen in 431 .Archidamus warns his officers to expect an Athenian sortie (H, ii) he says what any cvise general would say.i® The Athenian Empire is regarded as beyond the reach of anything but a fleet. The speech in fact notably fits what a general like .Archidamus would think according to the evidence available in 432, as it fits its place in the debate. The defence of Spartan institutions against the strictures of the Corinthians would not seem strange to a Greek and assists the picture Thucvdides presents. The remark ‘ I fear rather we may bequeath the war to our sons ’ (81, 6) fits the drastic phrasing of the speech, and affords no indication of the date of com- position. That Archidamus, king and general, made a speech on this occasion may be re- garded as practically certain, and the proverbial secrecy of Lacedaemon would not prevent it being known abroad what kind of thing he said. A part of the argument about this belongs to the discussion of the second speech of the Corinthians and the first speech of Pericles, so any conclusion must be provisional : my own provisional conclusion would be that Thucydides has adhered pretty closely to q ^uuTracra yvcbiaq tcov dAqOcbg AexQevtcov. The brief allocution of the ephor Sthenelaidas (86) marks the due contrast, and the best answer to the aco9p6vcog EKAoyi^EaGai of the King, as it does to the speech assigned to the Athenians. It gives not so much argument as motive, and is a kind of echo of the dcApOEordTri Trp69aaig. That Sthenelaidas put the vote as ephor no one doubts, and the fact that after a See II, 12 and II, 18 and M. Pohlenz, GStt. Gel. dnc. 198 (1936) 285, n. 3. 8 F. E. ADCOCK change of ephors the Spartans went more hesitatingly to work does not make his yvchpr] less probable. So much for this debate. The decision of the Lacedaemonian Assembly is given as AsAuaSai ai crrrovSai Kai oi ’A9TivaToi ctSiKeiv (87, 2), or, apparently less precisely. Tag OTTOvSds AsAucrOai Kai TToAeijriTea (88). This incidentally means that Sparta can no longer appeal to the arbitration clause in the Thirty Years Truce, though Athens can, as indeed she did with notable dialectical force under the adroit guidance of Pericles. That an acceptable arbitrator could hardly be found is true enough, but it would have suited the temporising policy of Archidamus to explore e\\ ery avenue, even if every a\\'enue was a cul de sac. We may pass over, for the moment, the consulting of Apollo and the setting of the excursus on the Pentekontaetia and go at once to the speech of the Corinthians at the second conference, this time of the Peloponnesian League as such. Sparta had gi\\en a lead, but it is clear that if a majority of the League members voted against going to war, the League would not be in\\ ol\\ ed. The feverish acti\\ ity of the Corinthians which Thucydides, no doubt truly, ch'sc ribes suggests that the Corinthians thought an adverse vote possible. When Thucydides contented himself with one speech, that of the Corinthians, he presumably regarded them as exceptionally important, as he regards their grievances as more wcjrth retailing at length than those of the Megarians or .\\cginctans. The speech of the Corinthians, after referring to the fact that their criticism of Sparta had been met by the decision of the Spartan assembly, goes on Ut urge that inland states are threatened by Athenian navalism. This notion was not anachronistic in 432, cpiite apart from the implications of the Megarian Decree. At least the general idea is found in the Pscudo- Xenophontic Constitution of Athens ( 11 . 3-4), a work which few will put later than the Archi- damian war. So far as can be seen, the pressure of .Athenian navalism proved not so effective as is suggested in the Corinthian speech or in the Constitution of Athens, and, in so far, this argument is not likely to be an argument later imported by Thucydides. -After what seems to be a parry to a point in the speech of .Archidamus, comes the plea that Corinth is not asking for a war d outrance (120, 3). Nothing is imported to reflect cither the Corinthian disillusionment with the Peace of Nikias or the mood of the closing stages of the whole 27 years war. Then comes a partial answer to points inade in the .Archidamus speech about the prospects of the war and the potential resources of the Peloponnesians and an opti- mistic estimate of their chances (121-2).!'* The notion that in naval matters courage would prevail once a degree of skill was reached is reflected in the speech of the Peloponnesian commanders (IL 87), which docs not seem anachronistic. There is a reference to ^uppccycov aTTocrraCTis, but a moment when there was in fact a revolt is not a moment at which the reference would be inappropriate. ’Ettiteixictmos, which is also mentioned, was not first thought of at the time of Decelea. Something of the kind was tried again and again by .Athens in the .Archi- damian war.^^ So the speech passes through an aO^pais to a peroration, with the slogan of the EAeuOgpcoCTis Tijs ‘EAAdbos which was undoubtedly being voiced at the time. The whole speech, so it seems to me, is not merely well suited to the occasion in the light of the earlier debate but also reflects what we can suppose to have been in people's minds at the time. The Corinthians speak ‘ aus der Situation in die Situation hinein ’. With these words we may pass to the first speech of Pericles, for Xesselhauf has used these words, truly I think, of that speech so far as the diplomatic situation is concerned. And Pohlenz,*' in discussing the able dissertation of R. Zahn on this speech,*® has pointed out that the Periclean strategy is that implicit in the Pseudo-Xenophontic Constitution of Athens. The notion of a loan from Olympia or Delphi may have made shipwreck of Spartan scruples, but it was not, as has been suggested, something which could only have been advanced by the rationalistic Thucydides. Pericles, who after all did not rule out borrowing Athena's golden robes, is later made to use the slightly opprobrious word kiveiv of this proposed transaction, but after all he is not made to speak impartially.

As is well known, this dissertation is strengthened by what it contains from the pen of Professor Jacoby. THUCYDIDES IN BOOK I 9 The notion of STTiTsixiapog belonging to the strategical technique of Pericles' time, the treatment of military and naval problems in all these speeches does not import the lessons of the Sicilian expedition or of the Decelean-Ionian war. Pericles, like the Corinthians, is made to regard the Athenian supremacy at sea as exposed to one danger, the attraction away of oarsmen or the training of Peloponnesian crews to manoeuvre with Athenian skill ; 142—3). The naval defeats of Athens at Syracuse, which reduced her fleet to a strength that could be challenged, were due to an improvement of naval construction rather than to acquired skill in handling the ships, and this improvement was effective against an Athenian fleet fighting on the scene of Thermion's triumph ATI, 341. The revolts of allies are regarded by the Corinthians as a wav of reducing Athenian revenues f 122, i ) rather than as a factor in operations. To return to Pericles. His speech may include points made in an earlier debate in which the Megarian Decree was the chief topic, but though Athens had already rejected the Spartan demand, those who hoped to avoid war would not hesitate to rei ive the topic and urge that concessions should be made. At least Thucydides sa\\s that at the final debate some did declare cos Pij epiroSiov sivai to yricpiaiiaEipfivris ( I39^ 4', and Pericles would hardly have neglected the topic when speaking ixpos ’AOrjuaious p£Tap6uAous. In any event, the conflation of two speeches would not \\ iolate Thucydidean principles. The manner of the speech reflects an authoritative attitude in Pericles for which the evidence is not confined to Thucydides alone. The speech seems to give what Pericles thought in 432, and there is no good reason to suppose that he did not say what he thought. A passage which has often been adduced as evidence for the late composition of the speech or part of it, is ch. 144, i.

It has been argued that these words were written with knowledge of the great Sicilian Expedition.

Granted that this part of ii. 65 was written late, there is no reason to doubt the truth of Thucydides’ statement that Pericles did in fact urge this policy and that what we have in 144, i and in the latter part of 143, which reflects the notion of Tiovxd3£iv Kai TO vovrriKov SEpaixEUEiv, is in fact what Pericles said while he was alive to say it. It did not need the Sicilian Expedition to illuminate the logic of Periclean strategy.

That Pericles distrusted the judgment of the .Athenians when he did not guide it, is not to be doubted : it may, indeed, have been one reason why he was reluctant to see the issue of w ar postponed by concessions. It may be granted that as Thucydides looked back over the course of the whole w^ar he saw Pericles as a shrewder judge, a firmer handler of events than his successors, but I cannot myself detect in the First Book signs of a later rewriting ad maiorem Peridis gloriam, but rather the pre- sentation of political and military problems as they in fact presented themselves to any clear- sighted observer at the time. The military calculations of .Archidamus, the Corinthians and Pericles are interlocked, but thev seem to be real contemporary calculations which had to be made and had to be stated, which in fact did interlock. The hypothesis that much of the second Corinthian speech was E. Mever. op. at. II. 385; M. Pohlenz, Gott. Sachr. 1919, 121. lO F. E. ADCOCK invented in order to set up Aunt Sallies for Pericles to knock down, appears to approach the unrealistic. It is hard to suppose that Thucydides, who was presumably aware that States seek to avoid wars which they believe they will lose, did not set himself to give his readers a view of what these States did in fact believe, or what their leaders believed and urged on their allies and fellow-citizens. But most communities before they pass from peace to war, granted they have any choice in the matter, need more than the conv'iction that they are likely to win or that their cause is in itself just, or that the cause of their opponents is in itself other than just. Motives not wholly composed of either conviction come into play, and with these too Thucydides was bound from the start to be concerned. This leads on to the setting of the excursus on the Pentekontaetia in chapters 89-1 18. It is generally assumed that the excursus was written to give the evidence for the dApOga-rarri npocpaais. This assumption needs to be examined more closely. In chapter 88 Thucydides says that the Spartans voted that the Truce was ended and that they must go to war, not so much because they were persuaded by what their allies said as because they feared that the Athenians might become more powerful, observing that most of the Greek world was already under their control. He then continues — 01 ydp ’A6r|vaIoi Tporrco xoicpSe fjAdov erri Tct Trpayporra ev 015 Tiu^ijOriaau (89, i). The purpose of the excursus is then further given in 97, 2. It is to fill up a gap in his readers’ knowledge and to show how the Athenian dpxn was established. The excursus ends with the Thirtv' Years Truce, followed by an account of the Athenian suppression of the Samian revolt. So far it may be said to e.xplain how the Athenians founded their power and how the Spartans could observe that most of the Greek world was already under Athenian control, but it does not show why the Spartans should fear that the power of Athens would increase to Sparta’s disadvantage. Now the dAriOEcrrarri irpocpacris is not only the great- ness or power of Athens but also the fear which it inspired in the Lacedaemonians.^® In 1 18, I when Thucydides has ended the excursus with the reduction of Samos and the submission of Byzantium he proceeds — perd ToOxa Se fi5r) yiyvsrai ou ttoAAoIj ersenv OoTEpov Td TTpoEipppEva, xd X£ KEpKUpaiKd Kai xd TToxEiSEoxiKd Kai oaa Trp 69 aais xoOSs xoO TToAspou KorT£(jxr|. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that when Thucydides says TTpocpaCTis he is referring back to the dAri0£axdxr| Trp69aais of chapter 23, and, if so, then this is to be found, or at least partly found, in what happened a few years after the events he has described in the e.xcursus. The TTpocpaois then includes what Thucydides has been concerned with in the chap- ters that lie between the end of xd TToxEiSEcrriKd and the beginning of the excursus. For the TTpocpaais is more than what the excursus has described, it is more than the establishment of Athenian power or of the apyp — it is the combination of power and apparent dangerousness which was the truest explanation why Sparta felt bound to go to war. In saying ‘ felt bound to go to war ’ I may hav'e giv en too little force to the word dvocyKdaat in dvayKdoai £5 x6 ttoAepeIv (cf. also 118, 2). I did so to remind myself that one need not always assign to a word in Thucydides its most trenchant meaning. In his Paideia -1 W. Jaeger pointed out that there is a passage in V, 25, 3 which shows a certain parallelism to the dAriOscrrdxTi upocpaais. Thucydides has said that for 6 years and 10 months the Athenians and Lace- daemonians did not march against each other, but under cov er of an unstable truce injured each other and then continues ETTEixa psvxoi Kai ocvoyKacffiEvxES AOaai xds psxd xd 5ka Exp oxrovSd? a56is Is ttoAepov (pavEpov KoxEoxpaav. But if one examines what happened at that time it can hardly be said that the two States were enforced by an inexorable logic of events, and I would hesitate to suppose that in I, 23, 6 Thucydides need mean that, in his view, the Peloponnesian war was precisely what moderns call ‘ inevitable ’, a word which often conceals a certain economy of thought. But it may be suggested that Thucydides did intend his account of the debates at Sparta to suggest a kind of addition to his account of the establishment of the It is not difficult to forget that it has this double Aoyco 6 e dtpccvEcrrcfTrtv, tou^ 'AQrivaious oioaoci iisydAo'Jv yivoasvouv character. When Dionysius of Halicarnassus {de Thuc. iud. dvotyKOToi eij t 6 iro^EiiEiv, and it may be that Dionysius was 10; cites I, 23. 6 with the' text of Thucydides before him, he not the last uriter to be unprecise in this matter quotes It correctly, but in another work [Ep. U ad Ammae. 6) this is what he gives us : xriv atv ouv dAtiOKrTomiv amai;, THUCYDIDES IN BOOK I II Athenian Empire that ^v■as the source of Athens’ strength, namely reasons for the fear which that strength inspired in Sparta or rather the half reasoning, half emotional and not explicitly declared atmosphere, in which the alxlai precipitated a crisis that ended in war — a part of that atmosphere being precisely the unwillingness of Athenians to behave like Spartans, their ToAuppov Kai VECOTepoTTOua which, however groundlessly, had alarmed the Spartans once before at the time of the Helot revolt 1 102, 3). But if the excursus in chapters 89-1 18 is not the whole of the justification of the dApOscrraTp irpocpacns, it seems to imply its existence in the mind of Thucydides. And if one was sure that the excursus was not written until the end of the war, this would certainly suggest that the dApOEOTocTp rrpocpaais may describe something which Thucydides did not realise until about the end of the whole period of 27 years. The passage that matters is, of course, 97, 2. If K. Ziegler is right,-’ as I think he is, in urging that this passage originally said simply eypavpa 5 e ccurd xai Tfjv eKpoApv toO Aoyou erroipodupv 5 id toSe, oti toIs irpo IpioD diraCTiv ekAittes TOUTO fjv TO x&opiov KOI f| TO TTpo Twv MpSiKCOv 'EAApviKa ^uv£Tl 0 Eaav f) cxOrd to MpSmd. dpa Se Kai Tijs dpyfis diroSEi^iv syEi 195 tcov ’AOpvalcov ev oIco Tpoirco koteotp and that then Thucydides, on the publication of Hellanicus’ Atthi^ after 406, added a remark toutcov Se ooTTEp Kai fjipaTO EV Tp ’Attikp ^uyypacpp 'EAAdviKos, ppoyedig te Kai ypovoig orn< ccKpi^cos ETTEuvfiaOp — if Ziegler is right, then the reference to Hellanicus' work supplies not a terminus post quern for the composition of the \\\\'hole excursus but a terminus ante qiiem, which is a very different matter. The e.xcursus is to Thucydides an EKpoAp toO Aoyou which needs justifying, and Ziegler has urged that the excursus is derh ed from a work on the history of Greece in which Thucydides had been learning his trade as a historian before ever the war began. But it seems too selectively relevant not to be written, or at least rewritten, for purposes concerned with the causes of the war. But granted that, the e.xcursus itself has, so it seems to me, characteristics which tend to place it early in Thucydides’ career when indeed, I now think, Thucydides was evaluating all the motives that caused the war to break out. It is common ground that the excursus shows a lack of chronological precision about the intervals between military events. Thucydides may have supposed a chronology in archon years to be misleading, but it remains true that what he has given us rarely shows the spacing of events, and it is hard to escape the conclusion that this was because he could not discover the truth about it. On the other hand he does give indications of the length of certain enter- prises : Thasos’ surrender in the third year of the siege, the expedition to Egypt lasts six years. These facts, as \\\\h Kolbe has pointed out,^^ might be gathered from the Athenian casualty lists preserved in inscriptions. If for the moment we accept Kolbe’s suggestion that Thucydides turned to this source for information, did these inscriptions also give indications of the interv'als between wars by giving the absolute dates of the w'ars concerned ? The only heading that has survived, that of the Erechtheid decree, does not settle the point, for the words tou outou EViouToO ‘ In [or of] the same year ’ may either be, as it were, absolute or may refer back to chronological indications given in another list for what I will call that casualty year. The limits of a casualty year if, as most scholars now agree, Wilamowitz was right in making these the times of the public commemorations are not readily to be defined by ordinary Attic chronological formulae. But an indication might be given of the archon under whom the particular commemoration was held, and this would sufficiently define the period to those who know what the sviaurog meant. If on the other hand no such indication was given, Thucydides could deduce by putting lists together roughly how long wars lasted but not the intervals between them. One day this matter may be cleared up beyond doubt. Thucydides also knows that there is an interval of about 1 2 days between two Corinthian defeats in Megara, that the battle of Oenophyta is on the sixty-second day after Tanagra, that the Greeks and Eg>'ptians were besieged for eighteen months before the collapse of the Egyptian expedition, that Samos surrendered in the ninth month of the siege. These details may well be Rh. Mus. LXXVIII (19291 66, n. 2. loc. cit. 62 fF. Hermes LXXII (19371 246 ff., 266. Aristoleles und Athen, II, 292. 12 THUCYDIDES IN BOOK I derived from those who were engaged in these operations. From the same source cvould probably come information about the numbers of ships, for the size of fleets would be known to those who served on them but are not likely to figure in inscriptions. The first of these sources of information, that of the inscriptions, if in fact Thucydides used it, would be at his disposal either before his exile in the \\vinter of 424 3 or after the Fall of Athens. The second, the recol- lection of the combatants, would hardly be available more than 40 years or so after the e\\ cnts. Schwartz, who evas too honest a scholar to refuse to sec difficulties that might beset his con- clusions, writes : ' Daraus, class er die Pentekontaetie erst nach 404 schrieb, foigt mit nichten, dass cr erst damals das Material sammeltc. \\’on ctwa 430 an verfugt cr ausserdem itber seine persbnliche Erinnerung; scin historisches Interessc wire! auch nicht erst mit 431 begonnen liabcn.' It seems most economical of hvpothcsis to suppose that Thucydides saw reason to find out what he could about the Pentekontaetia and to write the excursus at latest before his exile in 424 3 and probably in connection with the outbreak of the war. The greater detail of the account of the Samian Revolt would be explained by the fact that for tliis he would ha\\ e access to the most recent knowledge and it has been suggested that he was drawing on a family tradition.-' Xow this is admittedly hypothetical, but it can fairly be said that the excursus on the Pente- kontaetia shosvs characteristics that arc most easily explained by supposing that it was written at a time not far removed from the outbreak of the war. If this is so, then Thucydides may have been conscious at that time that the establishment of the .Vthenian Empire and the general growth of Athenian power in that period w'as relevant to the cpiestion why the war happened and that he did quite early come to believe that the alTiai — the immediate grievances, were not the whole story. This does not mean that he ever regarded the amai as immaterial, as just ripples on the surface of a tide towards war. The greatness of Athens, the existence and maintenance of the Athenian Empire, did not in themselves violate the Thirty Years Truce, and if Sparta could acquiesce in these in 446 why not do so in 432 ? To this there was the answer that .Athens had crossed the path of Corinth and had aroused in her headstrong hatred. The Megarian Decree had revealed the drastic application of Athenian control of half the Greek worlci. But there was more than this. The known or supposed Athenian character (and the supposition did Athens little injustice) made the potential danger from .Athens greater than the actual. .At Sparta there were those who had regretted the compromise of the Thirtv A'ears Truce, who might be goaded to act by a picture of Spartan inertia, those w ho had perhaps outlived the old acocppoCTUvri with its inhibitions. The \\ery mi.xturc of .Athenian formal correctness and un- yielding refusal to mitigate the use of her power, attested inter alia by the Megarian Decree, had a formidable quality which might either daunt her neighbours into keeping the peace or terrify them into w ar. And to war, in the end, it came. This is, so I venture to think, the Thucydidean analysis reached in the light of what he could discern as the outbreak of w ar was reached. If this is so, then in the First Book we ha\\ e a view of the antecedents of the war which is all of a piece, and which does not need to be explained by the importation into it of Thucydidean SguTEpai cppovTlSss, a view which e.xplains what we find in these parts of the book, written to elucidate, for the benefit of the future man of action, tcov ysvopEvcov to aaipes.

Of course there is a chiton too, but it appears only round the ankles, outside the left elbow, on the front of the right upper arm, and above the right breast. The right arm was lowered, but the elbow must have been slightly bent ; the left bent at the elbow, with the forearm raised and extended somewhat to the left. The composition of the lower part of the statue is not clear at first sight, because the breaking away of the knees has given undue emphasis to the transverse folds of the himation between the left knee and the right shin. The feet are not crossed but the left foot is slightly drawn back (the remains of the toes, resting on the footstool, can be clearly seen in Plate I, vertically below the left knee) whilst the right foot is thrust forward over the front edge of the footstool, dragging the chiton with it: a perfectly natural, if slightly restless attitude. Commentators have remarked the contrast between the calm of the head and the restless- ness of the body and drapery. As regards emotion, the remark is just : but of physical move- ment in the head and neck. Plates II and III show that there is more than commonly supposed. Nor is this all : it will be noticed that the finish of the hair on the right side of the head, where it waves back from the temple, is more detailed than that on the left (pll. Ill, I\\';, and it might be thought that this higher finish was due to the turn of the head on the body, which exposes this side more fully: but further study shows that the edge of the cushion on the left is also treated in more summary fashion than that on the right, and a similar reason cannot here be valid (pi. VI). Furthermore, the top of the front throne-leg on the left side was half covered by drapery, whereas that on the right was completely exposed : and the structure of the seat also differs on one side from the other.n The inferences that may be drawn from these observations are, first, that the statue is not likely to have been set in one of the niches to which the expedition of Dilettanti and, more tentatively, Newton himself at first assigned it,i® since both sides alike w’ould have been hidden, the difference in treat- Throughout this article, even when the throne is being discussed, ' right ’ and ' left ’ refer to Demeter’s right and left, not the spectator’s. Compare the vase in Leningrad (Schefold Kertsch. Vos. 19b, figure on r.}. Curious that the breaking away of the knees should convey so false an idea of the composition as to deceive F. Poulsen, who {From the Coll. Ky. C. II p. 178) says that the feet are crossed. The relief in .Vthens (Walter Ret. kl. Akrop. 68, no. 1 1 7; preserves the transverse fold between the legs of a similar statue and explains how the error can arise. A startling demonstration of the amount of movement in the whole design is provided by E. A. Gardner's quaint device [Handbook (1896) fig. 99, and subsequent editions; also adopted by Klein [Praxit. (1898; fig. 74; of illustrating the statue in looking-glass fashion. See -AppendLx I B. Optical corrections, calculated for an oblique view from the right, are apparent in the left cheek, left eye, and in the hair on the left. A further differ- ence, which is apt to be obscured because imagination tends, wrongly, to restore the broken edge of the veil on the right level with that on the left, is that the right side of the face was more exposed, and this is a reason to be added to those given above and below, for a three-quarter view of the statue being intended. Another feature which escapes notice because of the broken veil is the skill with which the carving of the ears and the sides of the neck has been e.xecuted from the front, the marble of the veil having prevented access from the sides. There are some doubtful points about these niches, of which a view is given in Disc. pi. LIV. Newton {id. p. 376 1 gives the width of that on the (spectator’s) right as 2 ft. 5 ins. and its height as 4 ft. 4 ins. This would be both too narrow and too low for the statue of Demeter, which is 2 ft. 9I ins. wide and 4 ft. 1 1 ins. high. In the plan on pi. LIII of Disc., the scale shows this niche as 3 ft. 6 ins. wide : the discrepanev may be due to the inclusion of the frame. The left-hand niche is taller, though its height ‘ could not be ascertained, as the upper part is broken away ’ {Disc. 717), and slightlv wider. There is further confusion in the speculations on the possibility of the statue having fallen from one of the niches. It was not the seated Demeter that was found immediately below the cliff-face and almost under the niches (at 7 on Newton’s plan in Disc. PI. LIII . but the standing statue dedicated bv Nicocleia (B.M. Cat. Sculpt. II no. 1301,., at first identified as Demeter. Base, statue, and fragments of its limbs were found together, so that it would seem that they were near its original position. Moreover, the base is roughly rounded behind, it is dressed only so far back on the sides as a spectator can see from a three-quarter view ; even the statue itself — and especially the head — is very roughly finished at sides and back. .All the evidence points to its having stood in a niche : yet the left-hand niche seems too low to accommodate both statue and base, which together are just over 8 ft. high. The seated statue, which we now commonly call the De- meter of Cnidus, was found at 2 on Newton’s plan, and if it fell from the left-hand niche, which alone is large enough (though . — from a photograph — probably not deep enough) would have had to roll uphill to reach the spot where it was found. Near it was the inscribed base Inscr. in B.Af. DCCCXIII. The marble statuette of Kore (see pi. X and .Appendix II, p. 25'; was also found near (at r on Newton’s plan ' , and so were the fourth-century terracottas (at 3 on the plan ' . Naturally some of the sculptures may have been moved in later times, but to move uphill a statue weighing just a ton is no easy task. Lime-burners commonly prefer to burn sculptures on the spot or break them up into readily portable fragments. The balance of the evidence, then, is against the seated statue having been in the left-hand niche. It may have been on one of the two square bases in the centre of the temenos (Disc. 392, pi. LIII), or, more probably, near where it was found, namely in the building towards its western end. It should be added that, in addition to the objects enumerated above, the thin sheets of lead inscribed with curses were also found at this spot, which would thus seem to be the focus of the sanctuary and a likely position for the cult-statues. DEMETER OF CNIDUS 15 ment would have been purposeless, and the asymmetry of the drapery when seen from the front disturbing; second, that the statue may have been set at an angle to the spectator; third, that it may have been grouped with another statue. That the statue was set sideways or three-quarters to the spectator is not impossible,^® whilst it is extremely probable, since the temenos was a temenos not of Demeter only but of Demeter and Kore, and most of the dedications mention both the goddesses, that it contained a cult-statue of the daughter in addition to one of the mother. Is there any evidence what this statue of Kore was ? The answer to that question, given in Appendix II, is that it was of an Attic type well-known about the mid fourth century b.c., and if the answer is correct it implies an Attic origin for the statue that stood beside it. Instead of relying on this argument, I prefer to assume outright that the statue of Demeter is by an Athenian. This may seem to beg the question — if we are blind to what a thousand grave-reliefs show us of Attic style in the fourth century. It is, moreover, by a sculptor in whom the classical Athenian tradition — that of Pheidias — seems particularly strong. The monumental oval of the face, the broad yet subtle modelling of the forehead, the deep but unostentatious emotional content derive directly from the masterpieces of the fifth century : here is a man who has often walked on the Acropolis, has stood before the Lemnian, and has looked up at the Parthenos.^® He is a sculptor of great ability, and therefore one whose name is likely to be known to us from literary records ; he must have carved other sculptures in Athens and elsewhere : fragments of them may have survived, and if so, may give a clue to his identity. The most obvious of these fragments is the head of Alexander from the Acropolis (pll. XI, XII), and a comparison both of the general forms and of the details leaves little doubt that, despite the great difference of subject, the same mind and the same hands are at work. In particular, it is not easy to imagine that different artists designed and carved the mouths and put the finishing touches to the lips (pi. XI, c, d). Who, then, was this sculptor? Although one name, that of Leochares, has several times been mentioned in discussions of this portrait of Alexander, the issue has been confused partly because most writers have preferred to pass judgement on and to argue from, not the head of the Acropolis, which is an original, but the Erbach head, which is a Roman copy of it,^® and partly because the attribution has been supported by stylistic comparison with other Roman copies, of lost works whose identification is often doubtful — a kind of argument that can never be conclusive and is not often convincing,-^ with the result that what is in fact a strong case has not been properly appreciated. Let us approach the problem from a different direction. What would have been the essential conditions in choosing a sculptor for this commission — a statue of Alexander the Macedonian to be set up on the Acropolis at Athens in the fourth century b.c. ? For reasons of external policy it would have been important to employ one of eminence ; of internal, an Athenian ; and it must have been desirable that this Athenian should not be hostile to the Macedonians. The claims of Leochares, as I see them, are these. He had already made a statue of Isocrates, the ablest advocate of the Macedonian policy that Athens produced.-- He had worked for Philip just after Chaeronea on the gold-and-ivory For example, two of the three cult-images of about this date which are reproduced in the relief in Athens (Walter, Rel. kl. Akrop. 68, no. 117I were apparently turned at an angle to the spectator, and several of the .Attic reliefs of the Eleusinian goddesses (e.g. Kern AM XVII, 125 ff.'i for other reff. see n. 4 p. 13,' imply groups of which some of the statues were set thus. The horizontal section is given bv Caskey Boston Cat. 66 . If, as suggested below', he w'as also a worker in gold and Ivors', he may well have needed to study the Parthenos closelv. 19 Casson Acrop.

There are two copies, one at Erbach (Stark, ffeei Alexanderkopfe (1897. 121, the other, from Madytus, in Berlin (Blumel Cat. K.203). It is just possible that tw'O originals of similar ty'pe, one in marble and one in bronze, were produced by the fourth- century sculptor, and that the Erbach head, which has more meticulous detail in the hair than the head from the .Acropolis, is copied from the lost bronze. .Amelung long ago observed the Identity of style between Demeter and .Alexander {Ausonia III, 1908, 127 ff. .

It is likely that he preser\\ ed some record, in the form of .studies, if nothing more, of his sitters’ features, especially Alexander’s (for Alexander completed the dedication after Philip’s death, as is proved by the inclusion of Olympias; ; and that when the cjuestion anjse of commissioning a sculptor for the statue in Athens, this too was known : tradition is clear that not many artists had direct access to Alexander, and he was apt to be in some remote part of the world when sittings were needed, so the point is important, Leochares was later to work \\vith Ls sippus — pre-eminently the sculptor of Alexander's court — on the bronze group at Delphi of .\\lcxandcr hunting, which was commissioned by Craterus and, some years after his death in 321, dedicated by his son.“^ It is unlikely, then, that with this sculptor at hand, any other woidd ha\\c been employed for the making of a marble statue of this importance in .Vthens, his natis e city.-\" Finally, no less than seven signatures of Leochares have been fsund in .Vthens, one not a great distance from the find-spot of the head of Alexander.-*’ Is it possible to determine the most likely date for the dedication? .After Chacronca in 338 Philip sent Alexander to Athens bearing the ashes f>f the Athenians \\sho had been killed in the battle. The Athenians arc thought to ha\\c conferrcfl their citizenship on both Philip and Alexander in gratitude, and to have set up a statue of Philip in the agora.-' Were this certain, then it would be reasonable to argue that they did not at the same time set up one of .Alexander on the Acropolis, because a statue on the .Acropolis has ditferent implications. Thus 338 and, from historical circumstances, the year or two following, are improbable. Immediately after .Ale.xanclcr's death the state of feeling in .Athens, and, indeed, her political mo\\cs. rule out such a dedication : accordingly 323 is a fairly certain lower limit. Within the period 336 to 323 there are several occasions which might have prompted the dedication, but it is not easy to find a decisive factor : 334, after the battle of the Granicus, when .Mc.xandcr sent three hundred Persian panoplies to .Athens: 331, when he released the .Athenian prisoners taken in that battle and was awarded a crown by the .Athenians. Lastly, there is 324, when he claimed divine honours from the Greeks, and was in fact deified, though grudgingly, by the Athenians ; it must be admitted that the .Acropolis would be an appropriate place for a statue erected with that purpose: true, there is no external .sign of deification, and no diaderna, but their absence tells us nothing. Xor can anything certain be inferred from the apparent youth of the subject, although this is a promising line of approach u.scd by Bicber T.c. n. 19 above). .Age is difficult to guess in an ideal portrait, and her estimate of only fifteen or si.xtcen seems too low : if correct, it would fix near 340 the date when the sittings were gi\\cn and the type created, but it would not necessarily establish that date for the dedication, though increasing the probability that it too was early. In short, 330 remains a convenient central date, but Bieber’s argument tilts the balance to the period before it. ^\\ hat then of the statue of Demeter? Before attempting to fi.x its date either in relation to the head of .Alexander, or absolutely, it is worth glancing at a problem which has some bearing on both date and authorship, for if these two works represent the ste le of Leochares, that style should be recognisable among the remains of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, where he Pans.

I regret not having had an opportunity since 1937 of again studying this head at first hand; it is just possible that a fresh examination might give a hint of the kind of body to which it belonged, and thus of the purpose and date of the dedication. This is usually stated as an established fact, e.g. by Geyer in RE XIX 2. r.r. Philippes 2295. but it is no more than an inference from the authorities there cited, among whom only Pausanias il i.x 41 mentions a statue of Philip, sating that it. and one of .Vlexander, stood in front of the Odeion, but giving no date for cither. I thank Sir .\\rthur Pickard-Cambridge and Professor -V. \\V. Gomme for help in clearing up this point. DEMETER OF CNIDUS 17 was one of the four chief sculptors. The facts — or rather the alleged facts — are familiar. Pliny’s story, usually accepted, is that the reliefs on the east were by Scopas, those on the north by Bryaxis, those on the south by Timotheus, and those on the west by Leochares. Vitruvius has a rather different and — because less fairy-tale-like in pattern — slightly more plausible account.'^® Pliny’s words have sometimes been taken to imply more than they say, as, for instance, that any piece of sculpture, whether in relief or in the round, found on the north of the building, must be by Bry axis, any piece on the south by Timotheus, and so on : this is certainly unjustified ; but even what they say must not be taken literally. To prove this, only four slabs, from the Amazonomachy, need be examined closely. They alone reflect the style we are seeking, and the very fact that they are supposed to have been found in situ forces us to face the problem with common sense. They are slabs 1013, 1014, 1015, and 1016 (pll. XIII, XIV) . They were found by Newton on the eastern side, and therefore if Pliny’s account is to be accepted literally, ought to display the style of Scopas.^- If the sculptures of Tegea are a criterion of his style, they certainly do not: given that the subject is similar, nothing could be further from the rugged forms and wild e.xpressions of Tegea than these smooth muscles, calm features, and rhythmic poses. But that is by the way. We need only go so far, at present, as to remark that the slabs are not homogeneous, and it thus becomes clear that whatever the statements of Pliny and Vitruvius may imply, they do not mean that four artists took one side each and designed and executed all the relief-work upon it. For slabs 1013, 1014, and 1015 are clearly the design of a single mind (pi. XIII) : they may also have been executed by a single pair of hands ; but slab 1016 (pi. XIV), which was found with them and seems to belong to the same allegedly eastern series, clearly differs from them in execution. Perhaps more deeply : the horse, for instance, hardly comes from the same stable. At the least, we are forced to distinguish design from execution, and to assume that each main sculptor had a number of assistants, of unequal ability, working under him. This is but natural, since the physical labour necessary in this amount of carving demands some such system, and sculptors inevitably differ in merit. The design may well have been entirely by the master, even if broadly sketched : he probably supervised the carving, either closely or loosely, and he may have assisted any of his subordinates in the early, intermediate, or final stage : or he may, of course, have done parts entirely himself. This hypothesis, and this only, will permit us to accept the broad truth of the statements by Pliny and Vitruvius ; yet will account for the differences of touch within the same general approach, and will explain why some Plin.

Cf. .-\\melung, Aus. Ill 103. Zschietzschmann )Vett als Geschichte I (1935 > 435 goes to the other extreme, and main- tains that there was one designer only for the whole frieze. In situ is a phrase to be used \\s ith caution. Xewton did not imagine that the slabs werestill in position onthe building, but wrote {Disc. II loo'i ‘ They were founci lying in a row, and appear to form one continuous composition. They are in verv fine condition, and, nottvithstanding the extreme salience of the relief, are but little mutilated. It may be inferred from these circumstances that the spot where I discovered them is not far from their original position on the edifice, as, from the great weight of the slabs, one of which is 3 ft. 8 ins. in length, by i ft. in thickness, they could hardly have undergone much shifting about without presenting more signs of bad usage on their surface.’ Nothing can be added to this statement (e.xcept that Disc. I pi. IV shows that the slabs were not lying parallel with either the eastern or northern wall of the building ! : VOL. LXXI. each must decide for himself what the probabilities are. As did Xeugebauer in Studien uber Skopas ch. III. See also the reff. in n. 29 above, Lawrence, Cl. Sculpt. 264, and \\V ace's article on the whole question of design and execution (Ann. XXIV— \\'L 109I, tvhich appeared when my own was already at the printer’s. The weakness of that article is its failure to suggest how designs were transmitted from the ‘ master ’ to the carver. Was it by drawing on papyrus, by models in clay or w ax, or by some other method ? .\\nd in what degree of detail? There is of course no ground for assuming that the procedure in decorating a building with sculpture was identical everywhere and at e\\ ery period, but sculptors commonly find it easier to gi\\ e e.xpression to their ideas by carving or even by drawing, rather than by modelling, and on full scale rather than in miniature : that is why I think it likely that in the friezes of the Mausoleum the master or masters set out the design full-scale on the surface of the marble, and then supervised the execution, actually taking part in the carving where it was necessary to instruct, correct, or give the final subtlety of emphasis. How othen\\ ise can one account not only for the varietv but also for the excellence of the styles? The majority of fourth-century grave-reliefs and votive reliefs are much inferior, both in st\\ le and in execution. Repeated attempts, inspired by Pliny's statement, have been made to connect these with Scopas (see Richter, Sculpture and Sculptors 27OJ : the latest is by Buschor {Maus. u. Alex. 46;.
