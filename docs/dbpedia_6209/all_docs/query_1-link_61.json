With its unflinching dedication to call of duty, in its\n\nsterling dual role in ‘Peace and War’ times, BSF has earned itself many a\n\ngolden moments in the history of Nation building.\n\nBSF stands guard as the impregnable wall defending the motherland\n\nand its citizens. With sustained community interface programmes, BSF\n\nhas been at the forefront of fulfilling the Governments’ objective of\n\nensuring socio economic development of people inhabiting border areas.\n\nIn discharge of social obligations to Nation and society with post life\n\nOrgan donation drive, BSF has taken its call of duty on a higher calling,\n\nfrom ‘जीवन पय्र� क�र्�’ to ‘जीवन उपरांत क�्र�’. The eco-friendly initiatives\n\nlike Rain Water harvesting, use of bio-digesters etc. in BSF premises are\n\ncontributing to reduce the carbon footprint. Numerous welfare activities\n\nhave been undertaken in recent times to alleviate the living standards\n\nof BSF personnel. Energies have been focused, so that these measures\n\nreach every Borderman and their families. Inclusion of programmes like\n\nfinancial literacy, online learning module – prepmantra, skill development\n\nprogrammes are aimed for holistic well-being of the force personnel.\n\nAssimilating the onward march of excellence with courage & compassion,\n\na coffee table book has been envisaged and brought forward to chronicle\n\nthe humane and valiant face of Border Security Force.\n\nWith the supreme sacrifices of 1865 valiant Bordermen on the altar of\n\nduty and more than 2000 decorations on roll of Honour, BSF reiterates\n\nunflinching resolve to live upto its motto of ‘जीवन पय र्� क� ्र�’ in the\n\nservice of motherland.\n\nWherever this book reaches, I hope, it will familiarise the reader with\n\ninteresting details of versatility of BSF functioning and they will recognize\n\nwonderful contributions of combined teams of Seema Praharis in Nation\n\nbuilding.\n\nI am also confident that this pictorial display will inspire each Seema\n\nPrahari to seek greater level of professional excellence in all that they do-\n\npaving the way for greater glory and accomplishments by Border Security\n\nForce.\n\nJAI HIND.\n\nvi vii\n\nviii ix\n\nx xi\n\nxii xiii\n\nxiv xv\n\nCONTENTS 01 MILESTONES & GENESIS 06 TRAINING &\n\nSUPPORT UNITS\n\nxvi Page 2 -

East India and the rise 9\n\nof Nationalism in Bengal in the erstwhile\n\nEast Pakistan created the context for the\n\ngenesis of the Border Security Force – a\n\nservice dedicated to defending the long\n\nIndian border.\n\nThe inadequacy of the State Reserve Police\n\n(SRP) and the Central Reserve Force in\n\nchallenging the Pakistan forces in Gujarat\n\nin 1965, set the stage for the formation of a\n\nCentral Force to protect the borders of the\n\ncountry. A report by a study group led by Lt\n\nGen Kumaramangalem, the Vice Chief of the\n\nIndian Army in April 1965 which prepared\n\nthe blue print for raising the BSF with expert\n\ninputs from various agencies. In May 1965,\n\na meeting of the Home Minister and the\n\nPolice Chiefs of all the states was held at\n\nthe behest of Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri, then\n\nPrime Minister, in Delhi concluding with\n\nthe Prime Minister’s decision to raise a new\n\nCentral Force dedicated to the defence of\n\nIndian borders.\n\n8\n\nShri Khusro Faramurj Rustamji, IP\n\nFounder DG of BSF\n\nIt was on 21 July 1965 that Shri Khusro Faramurj Rustamji,\n\nIP was appointed the founder DG of BSF following which an\n\nadhoc committee of Secretaries met in New Delhi On 16 Nov\n\n1965 and agreed to the establishment of the Border Security\n\nForce which was officially raised on 01 Dec 1965 under Article\n\n356 of the constitution.\n\nThe birth pangs of the BSF as described in Rustamji’s own\n\nwords give an insight into the genesis of BSF. “I was called\n\nto Delhi in May 1965 and asked to take over the responsibility\n\nof raising the force. After handing over charge as IGP Madhya\n\nPradesh, I reached Delhi and wrote my joining report on 21 July\n\n1965 and became the head of a one man organisation. I raised\n\nit and nurtured it for nine long years. I was the sole Border\n\nman; nobody below me, nobody above me...”\n\nShri K F Rustamji interacting with the BSF team working on the development of rocketry.
