        "text": "Following a series of incident reports on damage caused by flooding due to continuous heavy rain in Freetown, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) has embarked on a rigorous risk assessment in six communities across the Western Area.\n\nThis assessment is part of NDMA’s commitment to disaster preparedness, mitigation, and response, especially in light of recent weather forecasts by the Sierra Leone Meteorological Agency and the ongoing intensification of rainfall across the country.\n\nThe assessment targeted the following communities: Congo Town, Kolloh Town, Gray Bush, Pamarokor, Calaba Town, Bottomoku, Wellington, and Portee. Initial findings indicate that flooding has affected 200 households in Congo Town, Kolloh Town, and Gray Bush, collectively referred to as the CKG communities, which are particularly prone to flooding and other rain-related disasters.\n\nSignificant damage was reported, including a slope collapse in Congo Town, which tragically resulted in one death and the collapse of a house. The NDMA, in collaboration with the Sierra Leone Police, facilitated the transfer of the deceased to Connaught Hospital Mortuary. The team also assessed property damage amounting to thousands of leones and encouraged residents to swiftly evacuate to safer areas.\n\nIn Pamarokor Community, Calaba Town, the Deputy Director of Relief and Response at NDMA, Farouk Newland, warned residents of a potential landslide identified during the assessment due to activities compromising the stability of hilltop areas. He ordered immediate relocation to safer places for their safety.\n\nFeedback from flood victims highlighted several contributing factors to the flooding, including poor drainage systems, inadequate waste management, and construction on waterways. These issues exacerbate the vulnerability of these communities to flooding and related disasters.\n\nThe NDMA’s comprehensive assessment aims to develop effective measures to address these challenges by working with other line ministries to enhance the resilience of the affected communities against future disasters. During period, the NDMA seeks to implement targeted interventions to safeguard lives and properties in these high-risk areas."
