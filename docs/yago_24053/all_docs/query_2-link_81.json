        "text": "The beauty of an English-Chinese bilingual wedding ceremony is that no friends or family members are left out of the romance! There’s something special for every guest to enjoy, no matter which of these two languages they’re fluent in.\n\nSome couples might want to translate each word of the ceremony line by line. In that case, we’d recommend finding a wedding officiant who’s truly fluent. You might decide to ask a close friend or family member who’s bilingual and already knows your personal style to get ordained online to marry you.\n\nFor other couples, it’s more practical to only translate certain parts of the ceremony – such as the first few lines of the officiant’s welcome, or the wedding vows, or a special wedding reading… Embracing just enough of each language to make the ceremony meaningful, easy to follow, and joyful for all guests.\n\nIt’s easy to get started.\n\nFirst, visit our Wedding Script Library and choose a wedding ceremony script.\n\nThen, add one or two of these popular Chinese love poems to personalize it.\n\nAdd a poem after exchanging vows, or use your favorite lines in place of traditional wedding vows, or include one as part of the ring exchange.\n\nPlace your favorite lines anywhere in the script that feels right to you. It’s your wedding, so let it reflect your style!\n\nNext, ask a friend to get ordained online to marry you, or to participate in the ceremony by reciting a poem.\n\n1. 上邪！Yuefu folk poem\n\n\"Oh Heaven!\"\n\n我欲与君相知，\n\nI want to be your love forever and ever,\n\n长命无绝衰。\n\nWithout break or decay.\n\n山无陵，\n\n‘Til the mountains crumble\n\n江水为竭，\n\nThe rivers run dry,\n\n冬雷震震，\n\nWhen thunder rumbles in winter,\n\n夏雨雪 ，\n\nWhen snow falls in summer.\n\n天地合，\n\nWhen heaven and earth come together as one,\n\n乃敢与君绝！\n\nNot til then will I part from you!\n\n(We think these passionate lines make a beautiful alternative to the usual wedding vows, and ChinaWhisper calls this Yuefu folk song poem from the Han Dynasty one of the most romantic Chinese verses of all time.)\n\n2. “Memory of my Wife” excerpt by Yuan Zhen\n\n曾经沧海难为水，除却巫山不是云。\n\nNo water is wide enough if you crossed the sea,\n\nNo cloud is beautiful but that crowns the Mountain Wu.\n\n(Show your undying love with this moving verse: Sun Jiahui writes that this poem from the Tang dynasty is one of the best known eulogy love poems. She says, “In ‘Memory of my Wife,’ Yuan writes this line to express that after his wife died, it was impossible for him to fall in love with another.” In essence, Yuan writes that once you’ve seen the greatest of things, nothing else compares.)\n\n3. 我在等你 by Xu Zhimo\n\n“I’m waiting for you”\n\n我藏不住秘密，也藏不住忧伤，\n\nI can't hide secrets, nor sadness,\n\n正如我藏不住爱你的喜悦，\n\nJust as I can't hide the joy of loving you,\n\n藏不住分离时的彷徨。\n\nCan't hide the hesitation of separation.\n\n我就是这样坦然，\n\nI'm so calm,\n\n你舍得伤，就伤。\n\nIf you are willing to hurt, you will hurt.\n\n如果有一天，你要离开我，\n\nIf one day you want to leave me,\n\n我不会留你，我知道你有你的理由；\n\nI will not keep you, I know you have your reasons;\n\n如果有一天，你说还爱我，\n\nIf one day, you say you still love me,\n\n我会告诉你，其实我一直在等你；\n\nI will tell you that, in fact, I have been waiting for you;\n\n如果有一天，我们擦肩而过，\n\nIf one day we pass by,\n\n我会停住脚步，凝视你远去的背影，\n\nI will stop and stare as you move into the distance,\n\n告诉自己那个人我曾经爱过。\n\nTell yourself I loved that person.\n\n或许人一生可以爱很多次，\n\nMaybe people can love many times in their life,\n\n然而总有一个人，\n\nBut there is always one person,\n\n可以让我们笑得最灿烂，\n\nCan make us laugh most brightly,\n\n哭得最透彻，想得最深切。\n\nCry the most thoroughly and think the most deeply.\n\n炊烟起了，我在门口等你。\n\nCooking smoke rises, I’ll wait for you at the door.\n\n夕阳下了，我在山边等你。\n\nThe sun is setting, I'll wait for you at the side of the mountain.\n\n叶子黄了，我在树下等你。\n\nThe leaves are yellow, I'll wait for you under the tree.\n\n月儿弯了，我在十五等你。\n\nThe moon is bending, I’ll wait for you on the fifteenth.\n\n细雨来了，我在伞下等你。\n\nThe drizzle is coming, I’ll wait for you under the umbrella.\n\n流水冻了，我在河畔等你。\n\nThe water is frozen, I’ll wait for you by the river.\n\n生命累了，我在天堂等你。\n\nLife is tired, I’m waiting for you in heaven.\n\n我们老了，我在来生等你。\n\nWe are old, I’ll wait for you in the afterlife.\n\n(Xu Zhimo is one of the most beloved modern Chinese romantic poets, known for founding the Crescent Moon Society in 1923. His work has been translated into English by only a few scholars. The poem above, however, was translated using Baidu and Google Translate… Please send us your best translation!)\n\n4. Excerpt from 易经\n\n(Excerpt from I Ching, Book of Changes)\n\n二人同心，其利断金；同心之言，其臭如兰。\n\nWhen two people are at one in their inmost hearts\n\nThey shatter even the strength of iron\n\nor of bronze\n\nAnd when two people understand each other in their inmost hearts\n\nTheir words are sweet and strong\n\nlike the fragrance of orchids.\n\n(This sweet sentiment about the unbreakable bond formed by two people who are fully honest and vulnerable with each other is taken from the Book of Changes, as translated by Hellmut Wilhelm.)\n\n5. 因為你 所以我 by 五月天 (Mayday)\n\n“Because of You”\n\n(translated into Pinyin and English)\n\n人群 烟火 香槟和气球\n\nRén qún yān huǒ xiāng bīn hé qì qiú\n\nCrowds, fireworks, champagne, and balloons\n\n是你 带我 从派对逃走\n\nShì nǐ dài wǒ cóng pài duì táo zǒu\n\nYou’re the one who helped me escape from the party\n\n逃离 人间 耳语和骚动\n\nTáo lí rén jiān ěr yǔ hé sāo dòng\n\nEscape from the whispers and uproars of the earth\n\n这里 只有 你我和星空\n\nZhè lǐ zhǐ yǒu nǐ wǒ hé xīng kōng\n\nHere,

looking at the sky\n\n背上 却都 有一对伤口\n\nBèi shàng què dōu yǒu yī duì shāng kǒu\n\nBut their backs have a pair of wounds\n\n生在 这个 凡人的星球\n\nShēng zài zhè ge fán rén de xīng qiú\n\nBeing born on this planet of ordinary people\n\n是否 不配 作天使的梦\n\nShì fǒu bù pèi zuò tiān shǐ de mèng\n\nAm I not worthy of dreaming an angel’s dream\n\n你将 你的 翅膀给了我\n\nNǐ jiāng nǐ de chì bǎng gěi le wǒ\n\nYou gave me your wings\n\n带我 穿越 狼群和镜头\n\nDài wǒ chuān yuè láng qún hé jìng tóu\n\nYou helped me pass through packs of wolves and cameras\n\n让我 能够 品尝 片刻自由\n\nRàng wǒ néng gòu pǐn cháng piàn kè zì yóu\n\nAnd allowed me to experience a brief moment of freedom\n\n因为你 所以我 爱上那 片天空\n\nYīn wèi nǐ suǒ yǐ wǒ ài shàng nà piàn tiān kōng\n\nIt’s because of you that I love the sky\n\n天空下 我在祈求 那是你 牵著我\n\nTiān kōng xià wǒ zài qí qiú nà shi nǐ qiān zhe wǒ\n\nUnder the sky, I prayed that you would hold my hand\n\n最深刻 的故事 最永恒 的传说\n\nZuì shēn kè de gù shi zuì yǒng héng de chuán shuō\n\nThe most profound story, the longest lasting legend\n\n不过 是你 是我 能够 平凡生活\n\nBù guò shì nǐ shì wǒ néng gòu píng fán shēng huó\n\nIs simply just you and me living an ordinary life\n\n人生 只是 须臾的刹那\n\nRén shēng zhǐ shì xū yú de chà nà\n\nLife is just a flash of a second\n\n人间 只是 天地的夹缝\n\nRén jiān zhǐ shì tiān dì de jiā fèng\n\nThe mortal world is just the crack between the heaven and the earth\n\n人们 何苦 要活成修罗\n\nRén men hé kǔ yào huó chéng xiū

These lyrics were translated by the folks at AsianEuphoria.com.\n\nAnd if you don’t want to recite these Mayday lyrics as a special wedding reading, the song might make the perfect recessional music or first dance song instead.)\n\nMayDay performing Because of You\n\nYou might also like:\n\nRed Wedding Dresses: Symbolism and Modern Meanings\n\n12 Love Poems for Your Wedding Ceremony\n\nHow to Include Family and Friends in the Wedding Ceremony"
