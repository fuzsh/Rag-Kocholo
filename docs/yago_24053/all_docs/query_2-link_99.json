        "text": "Cambridge in England is widely renowned in China, largely due to the famous Chinese poet Xu Zhimo and his widely-known poem, \"On Leaving Cambridge Again.\" I had the wonderful opportunity to visit Cambridge and experience the beauty of its scenery when I stayed in London.\n\nI purchased a train ticket to Cambridge at London's King's Cross Railway Station. While there, I took a moment to visit the Harry Potter platform in the station hall. Next to it was the Harry Potter store, where I bought a magic wand. Holding the wand in my hand, I made my way to the train platform, a bit apprehensive about getting on the wrong train. As I approached, I noticed a kind gentleman walking towards the train with a coffee and lunchbox in hand. I approached him and asked, \"Excuse me, sir, is this the train to Cambridge?\" He replied with a simple \"yes.\" Upon nearing Cambridge Station, I noticed him at the carriage door, holding his coffee, ready to disembark. I asked him, \"Sir, is this where I should get off for Cambridge?\" Once again, he replied with a reassuring \"yes.\" Though he didn't offer many words, his courteous demeanor exemplified the typical Cambridge resident. In a similar situation, if I were to ask for directions in Canada or the United States, I would expect a much more enthusiastic response.\n\nThe train ride from London to Cambridge takes approximately an hour. Stepping out of Cambridge Railway Station, I was immediately struck by the brightness of the sky and the freshness of the air in Cambridge. While exploring St Mary the Great in Cambridge, I engaged in a conversation with a volunteer, who happened to be a master's student. We discussed a book I had read, \"The Grammar of Science,\" written by 19th-century British scholar Karl Pearson. To be honest, I only grasped about half of the book, but it provided me with a great deal of inspiration. Pearson's approach, starting with skepticism, using criticism as a guide, and challenging superstition and dogma, made me rediscover the critical spirit that thrives in Cambridge.\n\nCambridge University is composed of numerous small colleges, each exuding a quiet and quaint charm. I visited the apple tree that inspired Newton's discovery of gravity and walked across the small wooden bridge spanning the river. At one point, I found myself stumbling upon a serene lane lined with small houses, some adorned with potted plants displaying colorful flowers on their windowsills. As I passed under those open windows, I could even hear whispers or a child's voice calling for their mother. Cambridge is a tranquil and warm place, brimming with humanity.\n\nI softly recited a line of poetry, \"Quietly I leave, just as I quietly came; My sleeves are waving, not taking away a single cloud\" (by Xu Zhimo, translated by Edward Connynham). Xu Zhimo departed without carrying away a single cloud from Cambridge. So, when bidding farewell to Cambridge, what can one take away? Thankfully, as American poet Mary Oliver said in her poem \"When Death Comes,\" \"I don't want to end up simply having visited this world.\" Xu Zhimo left us with his beautifully crafted words, and I can recite them often in my life, repeatedly touching the beauty of Cambridge.\n\nReferences\n\nXu Zhimo (1897–1931) was a Chinese romantic poet. In 1918, he obtained an undergraduate degree from Clark University in the United States and then studied finance at Columbia University Business School. In 1921, he left New York to study at Cambridge University in England.\n\nOn Leaving Cambridge Again (by Xu Zhimo, Tr, Edward Connynham)\n\nQuietly I leave,\n\nJust as I quietly came;\n\nI quietly wave,\n\nSaying goodbye to the bright clouds of the western sky.\n\nThe river banks golden willows,\n\nLike brides in a setting sun;\n\nBeautiful shadows in bright waves.\n\nWaving in my heart.\n\nThe soft mud’s green grasses,\n\nBright green, waving on the river bottom;\n\nWorld I were a blade of water grass,\n\nIn the river Cam’s gentle waves.\n\nThat lake under the Elm shadow,\n\nNot a clear fountain but a rainbow in heaven.\n\nTwisted into floating weeds.\n\nPrecipitating rainbow dreams.\n\nDream searching? Push a long boat pole,\n\nUpstream towards green grass and an even greener place.\n\nA boat filled with starlight,\n\nLet loose a song midst printed starlight.\n\nBut I cannot sing,\n\nIt is quiet like a parting Hsiao;\n\nThe summer insects are also quiet for me,\n\nCambridge tonight is silent.\n\nQuietly I leave,\n\nJust as I quietly came;\n\nMy sleeves are waving,\n\nNot taking away a single cloud.\n\n《When Death Comes》--Mary Oliver\n\n“When it' s over, I want to say all my life\n\nI was a bride married to amazement.\n\nI was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms.\n\nWhen it' s over, I don't want to wonder\n\nif I have made of my life something particular, and real.\n\nI don't want to find myself sighing and frightened, or full of argument.\n\nI don't want to end up simply having visited this world.”"
