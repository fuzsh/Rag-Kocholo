        "text": "Anthony\n\nread audio aloud\n\nDJ00123987\n\ndo you have such a feeling:\n\nthe fate between people disappears in an instant.\n\nthere is no hysterical collapse, nor a hoarse plea for retention, but a silent alienation.\n\none does not ask, the other does not say, tacitly disappears in each other's circle of friends.\n\nas \"tomorrow of Coswell\" says:\n\n\"as a matter of fact, there is no long Pavilion Ancient Road to see you off. No, I advise you to drink another glass of farewell wine, which is in the same early morning as in peace, and some people stayed yesterday.\"\n\nDon't ask questions, it's the biggest maturity after parting\n\nthe leaves do not turn yellow in a day, and the hearts of the people do not cool in a day.\n\nheard the story of a reader.\n\nat a party, he accidentally learned from his classmates that his college roommate had got married.\n\nhe thought it was a little strange because he had never browsed this moments at all.\n\nhe clicked on the profile picture of his college roommate, only to find that he was blocked.\n\npeople who stayed up late to read books, played ball together, queued up to eat in the canteen together, and agreed to be each other's best man ended up as strangers.\n\nthere is a poem that reads: \"the furthest distance in the world is not that the stars have no tracks of intersection, but that even though the tracks converge, they are nowhere to be found in a twinkling of an eye.\"\n\nalienation between people is sometimes like this:\n\nafter separation, each is busy. Sometimes I want to talk, but I don't know what to say. Look at the minutes of the last chat and stop when you make an appointment to get together again in your hometown.\n\nin the end, none of you brought up this topic again.\n\nif you don't comment on his circle of friends, he doesn't contact you anymore.\n\nexperienced more, will gradually understand that the adult world, you have your busy, I have my own busy, everyone has their own way to go.\n\nemotional abatement is natural, and there is no need to ask questions.\n\nsome people can only walk with you for a long time, so take care of yourself for the rest of your life.\n\nA leaf of duckweed returns to the sea, where does not meet in life?\n\ncherish it when you meet it, and let it go if you miss it.\n\nNo entanglement, it is the best decency for adults\n\nLife is a grand party, where there is a gathering, there is separation.\n\nstubbornly clinging to each other will only consume the last favor in a relationship, so it is better to end the encounter with dignity.\n\nthe marriage between Xu Zhimo and Zhang Youyi is arranged by the family, and their relationship is not deep.\n\nafter she got married, Zhang Youyi was not liked by her husband, was called a country bumpkin, and was disliked.\n\nbut she didn't complain and kept doing housework for him at home.\n\nlater, Xu Zhimo went to study abroad and got to know Lin Huiyin. From then on, Lin Huiyin was in his heart.\n\nso he called Zhang Youyi to go abroad and forced her to divorce.\n\nZhang Youyi decided to stop pestering when she knew about it. I gave birth to a child in Germany, studied German and went to college.\n\nafter returning to China, she worked as a German teacher and opened the first fashion store in Shanghai. Zhang Youyi, who left Xu Zhimo, became a popular queen.\n\nlater, when everyone wondered if Zhang Youyi would be uncomfortable, Zhang Youyi said faintly, \"it doesn't matter, I don't mind.\"\n\nNo entanglement is the decency and magnanimity of adults.\n\nas said in Rose Island:\n\n\"the best love is for two people to keep company with each other, not to bind, not to entangle, not to occupy, not to yearn for meaning from each other, it is doomed to fail.\n\nbut the two of us stand side by side and look at this lonely world. \"\n\nwhen you fall in love, there are three thousand in the floating world, and there are three in my love: sun, moon and Qing. The sun is the dynasty, the moon is the dusk, and the secretary is day and night.\n\nafter parting, I have the pleasure of meeting you, even though it is sad and sad.\n\nfrom now on, don't fall in love again. If you say goodbye to each other, you will be happy.\n\nDon't disturb, it's a person's last stubbornness\n\nonce the man went shopping in the supermarket, because of carelessness, he came back to find that the house was full of fire.\n\nhis son and daughter were in the raging fire, the miracle did not happen, the child died, and he became a sinner.\n\nwhen his wife divorced him, he also drank to drown his sorrows and had nothing to do, paralyzing himself with decadence.\n\nVarying from from the daring to the demure, our seductive prom outfits are surely your essentials. Options in varieties of styles and silhouette are available now!\n\nuntil years later, he ran into his ex-wife in the street.\n\nhis ex-wife hates him very much, but she already has a new family and children.\n\nwhen leaving, the hostess said to the man, \"maybe we can find a chance to have dinner together.\"\n\nthe man first showed a surprised expression when he heard this, but a moment later, he refused his ex-wife's kindness: \"No.\" I'd rather not. \"\n\nthe two bid farewell to each other completely, and there will be no intersection in life ever since.\n\nDon't bother, it's the way adults deal with farewell.\n\nin Sister Sunshine, Nami painted a portrait of a boy she had a crush on in high school, but the crush came to nothing.\n\nafter many years, she asked around and finally found that Xi.A guy you've been in love with.\n\nthe boy has become a middle-aged uncle, runs a good shop and has his own family.\n\nNami did not disturb him, but quietly left the painting on his desk and left.\n\neveryone is an adult, they all have their own new lives, and there are more important people in their lives, so it is inappropriate to disturb them at this time.\n\nin the next meeting, Yingying said to Hao Han, \"you have all my contact information. Let's go.\"\n\nlater I learned that some numbers can no longer be reached, and some relationships can never go back.\n\nthe ancients used to say that there are four things in life: to come is accidental, to go is inevitable, to take its course, to let nature take its course.\n\nthe young writer Peng Pai wrote a paragraph:\n\n\"We are in a hurry, but we cannot escape loneliness and exhaustion; we are full of pride, but we cannot hide our wounds and bruises all over us;\n\nWe look back and think that our friends have gone far away. You think that the journey of youth is the same destination, who knows its name will be indefinite. \"\n\nin the adult world, meeting is an accident, and parting is the norm.\n\nLife is like the water train in \"Thousand and thousand fathom\". It has a journey but no circuit.\n\nit's worth rejoicing to meet a bosom friend along the way, but don't regret if you miss it.\n\nthe origin is full of joy, and when the fate is over, it ends with dignity. From then on, the mountain has a long way to go, and each takes care of it.\n\njust like what thousand fathom was told by her friends when she came home: \"go ahead and don't look back.\""
