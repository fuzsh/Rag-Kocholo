        "text": "This article is dedicated to my teachers, who have given me guidance during times of great adversity and change.\n\nUpon enrolling at the CLC in December, I was lucky to take literature classes as part of the Chinese language curriculum. Some students enjoyed Chinese literature, others were indifferent, and some didn’t find it very interesting. In actuality, all our readings had historical, cultural, and literary value. Our teacher selected a range of different Chinese literature, which included prose and poetry in both classical and modern Chinese. I have organized the authors and works from order of time:\n\nBook of Odes 詩經 – Zhou Dynasty 周\n\nTao Yuanming 陶淵明 – Eastern Jin 東晉\n\nThe Ballad of Mulan 木蘭詩 – Northern and Southern Dynasties 南北朝\n\nLi Po 李白 – Tang Dynasty 唐\n\nHan Yu 韓愈 – Tang Dynasty 唐\n\nSu Shi 蘇軾 – Northern Song 北宋\n\nXu Zhimo 徐志摩\n\nQi Jun 琦君\n\nLin Haiyin 林海音\n\nLin Liang 林良\n\nXi Murong 席慕容\n\nHou Wenyong 侯文詠\n\nBelow are introductions to the authors and my translations of their literature.\n\nTao Yuanming 陶淵明 (365-437), Eastern Jin 東晉\n\nTao Yuanming (also know as Tao Qian 陶潛) was a Chinese poet and is perhaps one of the most influential pre-Tang Dynasty Chinese poets. Tao Yuanming held some minor government positions, but he was firm in his principles and refused to curry favors or flatter high government officials. He is often quoted for saying he would not “bow like a servant for five bushels of grain” 不為五斗米折腰.\n\nTao Yuanming is famous for his poetry and his preface to the Peach Blossom Spring 桃花源記, which describes a utopia (tao hua yuan 桃花源 now means utopia in modern Chinese) free from poverty, corruption and political turmoil, a clear contrast to the unstable period Tao Yuanming lived in during his lifetime. The story begins:\n\nDuring the Taiyuan era of the Eastern Jin, there lived a man of Wuling who made a living as a fisherman[1]. One day while following a stream, he had forgotten how far he had gone [and lost his way]. Suddenly, he came across a grove full of blossoming peach trees, the grove lined both sides of the banks for hundreds of paces and did not include any other kind of tree. All over were fragrant grasses and herbs, [above him] a fluttering mist of dazzling and fragrant blossom petals. Thinking this sight highly unusual, he continued forward to see how far the forest went. At the forest’s end he reached the fountainhead of the stream and saw a mountain with a small cave. It appeared to have a ray of light, and thus he left his boat and entered the small hole.\n\n晉太元中，武陵人，捕魚為業，緣溪行，忘路之遠近；忽逢桃花林，夾岸數百步，中無雜樹，芳草鮮美，落英繽紛；漁人甚異之。復前行，欲窮其林。林盡水源，便得一山。山有小口，彷彿若有光，便舍船，從口入。\n\n-beginning of the preface to The Peach Blossom Spring 桃花源記[2]\n\nLi Po 李白 (701-762) – Tang Dynasty 唐\n\nLi Po is one of the most well-known poets of the Tang Dynasty, including Wang Wei 王維 (699-759), Du Fu 杜甫 (712-770), Bai Juyi 白居易 (772–846), among many others. Below is my (rough…really rough) translation of his poem.\n\nPlease Have Some Wine\n\nDo you not see the Yellow River’s waters falling from the sky, flowing swiftly toward the ocean, never to return?\n\nDo you not see parents facing the clear mirror, vexed at their white hair, [once] black in the morning, turn to snow upon the evening?\n\nIn our satisfaction and joy, we should live for this moment, to never face the moon with an empty wine goblet.\n\nHeaven grants us all with a purpose, our riches once exhausted, will always be earned again.\n\nPrepare lamb and beef, let us live in ecstasy and toast three hundred cups!\n\nCen Fuzi, Dan Qiusheng,[3] please have some wine sirs, don’t stop drinking.\n\nAllow me to sing a tune, please listen carefully:\n\nThe life of expensive bells, drums, and gem-like delicacies is barren, but I only wish to stay forever intoxicated and never awake.\n\nSince ancient times, sages and men of virtue have felt lonely and reclusive, but only those who drink leave their name in this world.\n\nThe King of Chen[4] once held a great banquet in Pingle[5], fine wines worth tens of thousands, drunk willfully amidst happiness and laughter.\n\nHost, why must you speak of money matters? Quickly, purchase more wine and let us drink to our fill!\n\nMagnificent, fine patterned horses; exquisite, qian jin fur robes—\n\nTell the boy to exchange them for fine wine, and let us drown these ancient, distant sorrows!\n\n將進酒\n\n君不見黃河之水天上來，奔流到海不復回？\n\n君不見高堂明鏡悲白髮，朝如青絲暮成雪？\n\n人生得意須盡歡，莫使金樽空對月。\n\n天生我材必有用，千金散盡還復來。\n\n烹羊宰牛且為樂，會須一飲三百杯。\n\n岑夫子，丹丘生，將進酒，君莫停。\n\n與君歌一曲，請君為我側耳聽。\n\n鐘鼓饌玉不足貴，但願長醉不願醒。\n\n古來聖賢皆寂寞，唯有飲者留其名。\n\n陳王昔時宴平樂，斗酒十千恣讙謔。\n\n主人何為言少錢，徑須沽取對君酌。\n\n五花馬，千金裘，\n\n呼兒將出換美酒，與爾同銷萬古愁！\n\nHan Yu 韓愈 (768 – 825) – Tang Dynasty 唐\n\nHan Yu lost both his parents at an early age and was raised by his elder brother and sister-in-law. When he was young, Han Yu studied ancient texts and developed concern for politics. At thirty-four years old, he held a government position, but this didn’t last long. When he met with the Dezong Emperor and requested lighter taxes, the emperor became furious and banished him to Mt. Yang 陽山 (in Modern Guangdong Province).\n\nHan Yu was a strict Confucian and did his utmost to reject Buddhism and Daoism. He wrote the famous Memorial on the Bone Relics of the Buddha諫迎佛骨表, a subtle protest against the government’s wasting of resources, which angered the Xuanzong Emperor and got Han Yu banished to Chaozhou 潮州.\n\nDuring his life time, Han Yu led a movement to revitalize the ways of the ancients, emphasizing the need to “Write to convey truth” 文以載道, specifically to revive the simplistic and clear writing style common during the pre-Qin period.\n\nScholars of the ancient past always had teachers. Teachers should transmit teachings, provide [a course of] study, and answer questions. People are not born with reasoning and knowledge. Who can avoid being perplexed? Those who are confused but do not follow [the way] of their teachers: their perplexities will last a lifetime.\n\nThose who were born before me, their learning and reasoning is truly earlier than mine, and I still follow and learn from them; for those born after me who possess knowledge greater than mine, I also follow and learn from them. I am learning the Tao.[6] Does it actually matter whether or not my teacher was born before me? Thus, [the best] teacher is neither noble nor lowly, [their] age high or low unimportant: where the Tao exists, the teacher also exists.\n\n古之學者必有師。師者，所以傳道、受業、解惑也。人非生而知之者，孰能無惑？惑而不從師，其為惑也，終不解矣。\n\n生乎吾前，其聞道也，固先乎吾，吾從而師之。生乎吾後，其聞道也，亦先乎吾，吾從而師之。吾師道也，夫庸知其年之先後生於吾乎？是故無貴，無賤，無長，無少，道之所存，師之所存也。\n\n-Excerpt from On the Way of Teachers 師說, by Han Yu\n\nSu Shi 蘇軾 (1037-1101) – Northern Song Dynasty 北宋\n\nSu Shi was a statesman, writer, poet, artist, and calligrapher of the Northern Song period. His style name is “Scholar Su of the Eastern Slope” 蘇東坡. He is considered a genius for his many talents. Su Shi was banished from court many times, mostly because he openly expressed his opinions to the Emperor and opposed the reforms led by Wang Anshi 王安石 (1021-1086).\n\nSome of Su Shi’s famous literature include shui diao ge tou水 調歌頭 (or Remembering Su Che on the Mid-Autumn Festival), On the Xilin Wall 題西林壁, Remembering the Red Cliff , to the tune of Nian Nu Jiao 念奴嬌.赤壁懷古 (my translation below), among many others.\n\nRemembering the Red Cliff, to the tune of Nian Nu Jiao\n\nThe vast Yangzi flows to the east, river waters swelling endlessly, [and I recall the] outstanding heroes of thousand years past.\n\nIn the West there is an ancient fortress. People say it is the location of the Red Cliff, where Zhou Lang [fought against Cao Cao during] the Three Kingdoms era.\n\nThe Jagged stone slabs towering like fallen clouds, fierce waves ripping the shores and rolling up snow-like water blossoms in thousands.\n\nThe rivers and mountains are like a painting: [during the Three Kingdoms,] how many marvelous heroes appeared?\n\nI recall Zhou Yu when he had just married the beautiful Xiao Qiao, Zhou Yu’s bearing magnificent, his countenance refined.\n\nDressed in fine robes and waving a scholar’s fan, in between smiles and laughter, he burned his behemoth enemies into ashen dust.\n\nAs I ponder what happened here in the Kingdom of Wu, people will probably laugh at my sentiments and my middle-aged white hair.\n\nLife is like a dream: better to pour a cup of wine in tribute of the river and moon!\n\n念奴嬌-赤壁懷古\n\n大江東去，浪淘盡，千古風流人物。\n\n故壘西邊，人道是，三國周郎赤壁。\n\n亂石崩雲，驚濤裂岸，捲起千堆雪。\n\n江山如畫，一時多少豪傑。\n\n遙想公瑾當年，小喬出嫁了，雄姿英發。\n\n羽扇綸巾，談笑間，強虜飛灰湮滅。\n\n故國神遊，多情應笑我，早生華髮。\n\n人間如夢，一尊還酹江月！\n\nXu Zhimo 徐志摩 (1897-1931)\n\nXu Zhimo was a poet of early Republican China. He came from a wealthy family and later studied abroad in England. While study in Cambridge, Xu Zhimo fell in love with English romantic poetry. According to Hu Shi, Xu pursued “freedom and beauty” his whole life, which gave him great inspiration. He is known for his major contributions to China’s “new poetry” 新詩.\n\nXu Zhimo was a leader in China’s literary movement. He helped found the Crescent Moon Society 新月派 in 1923. He was also quite the romantic and had relations with three women: his formal wife Zhang Youyi 張幼儀, Lin Huiyin 林徽陰, and Lu Xiaoman 陸小曼 (this has been turned into a Chinese TV drama).\n\nBy Chance\n\nI am that patch of cloud in the sky,\n\nThat occasionally projects into your heart—\n\nYou musn’t be surprised,\n\nNor should you be delighted—\n\nIn this turning moment, my trace is extinguished.\n\nYou and I met on this dark night of the ocean,\n\nYou have your direction, and I have mine;\n\nYou can remember this moment,\n\nThough it’s best you forget,\n\nThe shining brightness of this shared encounter!\n\n偶然\n\n我是天空裡的一片雲，\n\n偶爾投影在你的波心──\n\n你不必訝異，\n\n更無須歡喜──\n\n在轉瞬間消滅了蹤影。\n\n你我相逢在黑夜的海上，\n\n你有你的，我有我的，方向；\n\n你記得也好，\n\n最好你忘掉，\n\n在這交會時互放的光亮！\n\nQi Jun 琦君 (1917-2006)\n\nQi Jun was born in Zhejiang province. Her specialty was Chinese prose, but she also wrote novels, literary criticism, translations, and children’s literature. Her literature has been translated into English, Japanese, Korean, and other languages.\n\nIn the early morning when I lift up the curtains and take a look, rain droplets are already scattered all over the window. Ah! Great, another rainy day. The rain lasts ten days, half a month, and even a whole month, the hanging flag-of-myriad-countries like clothes all wet, the walls and floors all emit an air of moisture, and I don’t feel a bit grudged. Rainy days always take me to another place; there, I can enjoy the happiness of my youth once again.\n\n-A Rainy Day, How Pleasant 下雨天，真好\n\nHou Wenyong 侯文詠 (1961-)\n\nHe is a contemporary Taiwanese writer from Chiayi county. Mr. Hou pursued medicine throughout his entire education, but always had an interest in writing. Later, he combined his interest in writing with the reality of his career and the careers of friends and colleagues in the medical field, becoming the author he is today.\n\nHis writings include prose, novels, and children’s literature. We read Making a Bet 打賭, a short story that gives the reader a glimpse into the atmosphere of the hospital environment and the relationship between doctors, patients, and visiting relatives.\n\nWhen I was a resident physician, there was a paralyzed patient in critical condition who was living in the intensive-care unit. Our head physician casually looked at his medical records and boldly affirmed the patient will not live past three days. At the time, I was young and arrogant, what I heard was unconvincing, and then I challenged him: “And what if he lives past three days?\n\n-selected passage from Making a Bet 打賭\n\nReflections\n\nTranslation challenges my abilities in English and Chinese. The Chinese language, like any language, changed over time, and thus translating classical Chinese means depicting and conveying more with terse, simple, and efficient language. The largest pitfall in translating is finding a balance between what is literally written and my interpretation. The translation inevitably loses some connotation from the original, and I find I can only translate the meaning, but struggle with conveying the complete spirit and essence of the work, because every author I translate has their own writing style, or write in literary forms unique in Chinese written tradition, and the authors lived in completely different time period: the question is whether the translator can transmit, from the author’s words, the echoing feelings and atmosphere the writer felt when he wrote the piece.\n\nPerhaps there are times when I become too invested in what I read, lost in the past, lost in a place between the author’s memories and their creative prowess. At times I want to transform myself into the setting, character, and spirit of what I read, to take myself somewhere only possible in imagination and personal consciousness. This becomes dangerous, and then I am reminded to come back, to return to reality, to the present.\n\n[1] The word in Chinese for fisherman (yu ren 漁人), is a pun for the word fool (yu ren 愚人).\n\n[2] The sound for the word ‘peach’ (tao 桃) is synonymous with the word ‘escape’ (tao 逃). This pun, in addition to the author’s play on truth and fiction in this piece, express his dissatisfaction with the current political and social conditions of his time.\n\n[3] These are two of Li Bai’s good friends.\n\n[4] chen wang 陳王refers to the famous poet Cao Zhi 曹植(192–232), the third son of Cao Cao 曹操 (155- 220).\n\n[5] Pingle 平樂 was located right outside the Western gate of Luoyang 洛陽, which was a public place of leisure for officials and wealthy families of the Han period.\n\n[6] Han Yu is not speaking of the Tao such as the teachings of Laozi or Zhuangzi, rather he is talking about “the Way” of teachers. With consideration to his Confucian beliefs, he may also be speaking of Confucian learning.\n\nLeaving Tainan, Taiwan\n\nBesides China, I have never been to any other foreign country. In truth, since my arrival in Taiwan, I began to call Tainan home. So in the evening when I got on the U-Bus, I felt distressed leaving the only place I truly knew away from home: I had grown to like Tainan’s narrow grey alleys, busy round-a-bouts, hidden coffee shops, and even the fierce rain and rumbling of the sky.\n\nTo avoid Visa problems, I had to leave the country and come back. I chose the Philippines, first because I was curious about life in a non-Chinese speaking country, second because Manila—being the capital—would be a safe place to get around for English speakers. I would arrive at 6/22 and return 6/24.\n\nI arrived at the International Taoyuan Airport exhausted from the bus ride. After picking up my ticket and boarding pass, getting pass security, I was finally free to roam around. Parts of the airport was still under reconstruction, but there was an interesting hall with a metal calligraphy piece on one side, and a wall of plants and flowers on the other. The calligraphy wall had lyrics by Fang Wenshan 方文山, who often writes lyrics for Jay Chou.\n\nThe flight was miserable. The attendants were way too energetic, especially considering it was 1:30am. From my window I watched Taoyuan shrink into little globes of amber lights; we then left Taiwan airspace. The flight attendant turned off the lights briefly, but for the sake of selling snacks, drinks, tax-free gifts, and Cebo Airline souvenirs, they turned on the lights again and disturbed everyone who was sleep-deprived. For the first hour of the flight, I didn’t sleep, and the second hour I still had trouble sleeping. When we finally landed, I felt groggy and dehydrated, but the worst was over: I had made it to the Philippines.\n\nNinoy Aquino Int’l Airport to Hotel Indah Manila\n\nIt was 3am when I arrived at the airport. I had no idea where I was going, so I went to the information desk. The employee was a pretty chill guy. He called my hotel and then gave me directions on how to get there by the LRT, Manila’s light rail system. Seeing as I had a few hours to kill, I asked him about some of the local foods I should try and Manila’s scenic spots. I made some trip goals: eat valut, tapsilog, adobo, sinigan, and visit Manila’s Intramuros, Bahay Tsinoy Museum, churches, Chinatown, and Mall of Asia.\n\nAt 6am I got on the shuttle bus to the EDSA station. For the next twenty minutes I faced the window, shocked at what I saw. When I first thought of Manila, I only imagined large cityscapes and tall buildings, but I saw the opposite: roofs rusty-brown, colorful snack and food stands crammed on street sides, billboards, signs, large and small scattered on buildings, almost like a Western, but even more beaten, rugged, the traffic intensifying the crowded and grungy feeling.\n\nThe EDSA station didn’t feel any different. I asked one of the station guards how to get to the hotel and made my way up to the LRT gate. I got out my camera and took a picture—out of nowhere, a little kid appeared at my side, pulling at my pant leg. I was face-to-face with poverty, his black pupils staring me down, the ‘rich’ foreigner. But I was afraid, I shook my head and moved on.\n\nI was tired, beaten, and hungry. This was the first time being in a truly foreign country; I didn’t understand the language, and I knew barely anything about the culture or the society. There was no one I could trust, and so I was on guard during the whole ride to the main station. There were people of all ages on the bus and also a lot of students dressed school uniforms. Actually, the ride also gave me a chance to take in the landscape and feeling of Manila. In many ways it was modern, with large buildings, electricity, and fairly convenient transportation. But on the other hand, the city felt like a shadow of its former self: dirtied building walls, tin roofs and abandoned buildings, age-old signs, complexes overrun by plants and vines. Then I remembered what the man at the information desk told me: 1943. The city of Manila was severely damaged during WWII, and the vestiges of that period still exist.\n\nBearing the culture shock, I walked down the cement platform and found a breakfast stand. This was my first time eating tapsilog. It only cost me 30 PP, a less than $1 US. I then went to the city hall and asked the guard how to get to the hotel. He was really official, especially with the 6-bullet revolve tucked away at his side. My hotel was in a little dead-end across from social services. I walked in with my luggage and checked in. After getting to the third floor by elevator, I found my room: 304. Then I slid the magnetic card and stepped inside. As I expected–nothing like the pictures. The room was dull and unfurnished, the AC unit probably older than I was. After dropping my luggage, I put the AC on blast, turned out the lights, and jumped into the comfy soft bed, ready to catch up on some lost sleep.\n\nIntramuros\n\nBy 10am I made it to Intramuros, which is Manila’s cultural center and main tourist spot for historical sites and buildings. Intramuros is encompassed by a giant circular stone wall, so it was no surprise when I found old cannons surrounding one side. The buildings within these walls were very Spanish which made me feel like I was walking through a rougher, less exquisite Spain. Other times, the Intramuros felt ancient, archaic, like I had just entered circa 1600 Manila. The Intramuros was a place for many: students, those living in impoverished conditions, bicycle-taxis who went from tourist to tourist selling 200 PP rides around the ancient city, restaurant owners, business owners, tourism entrepreneurs, vendors, peddlers, and lots of stray animals.\n\nWhen I got thirsty, I bought a cup of coconut juice. The vender cracked the coconut open right on the spot. After finishing it, I started walking along the wall again when two young kids came running up to me. They were probably orphans, or homeless, because they put their hands out for money. It was obvious I was a tourist, especially with the straw hat. I refused again, but then the pointed at my cup, which still had coconut left in it. They took it in their hand and ran away in laughter and smiles.\n\nI eventually made it to the Manila Cathedral. Spiritual views aside, given I had never been to a cathedral before, it felt good and holy. Right as I walked in, the archway, high pillars and ceiling, and giant organ made me feel tranquil. It was hard to imagine what an actual service would be like in the cathedral, but it would probably be magnificent.\n\nBahay Tsinoy Museum\n\nMy next stop after lunch was the museum. I had learned about it through the tourism pamphlet I got at the airport. Apparently, contact between China and the Philippines goes back several centuries. Present-day Chinese-Filipinos call themselves Tsinoys.\n\nTransnational Chinese identity is something I’ve always been interested in, especially being a Chinese-American myself. It seems—or maybe I haven’t left Oregon enough—Chinese-American ‘culture and history’ hasn’t been documented enough in the United States. Therefore, the Tsinoy way of life fascinated me, because they did not simply disappear into unknown territories or become assimilated, but instead, never forgot where they came from, adapted to the environment, and created a culture and identity unique in many ways.\n\nIn the center of the Kaisa-Angelo King Heritage Center 華裔文化傳統中心 there is a replica of the Qin-period Terra-cotta soldier, donated by the Taiwanese government (kudos Taiwan!). The museum costed 100 PP to get in, but quite worth it considering how much there is to learn about Chinese-Filipino history.\n\nArcheological digs have been conduct in the Philippines, and the relics that have been unearthed include Chinese wares. Inside, there were ancient coins dating from the Tang to the Qing Dynasty (roughly 1200 year time span), and bronze vessels from the Tang, Song/Yuan, and Ming Dynasty. Trade between the Philippines and China flourished during the 16-17th century, particularly because of the Dong-yang Zhen trading route 東洋針路.\n\nChina has known about the Philippines from as early as the Song Dynasty (circa 1000 AD). The Song Dynasty Annals 史冊 mentions Mayi 麻逸，which refers to the Philippines according to experts. During Spanish colonial rule, Chinese immigrants were placed in a place called The Parian (balian 八連), a type of ghetto constructed for Chinese immigrants in 1582. In 1603, the government unlawfully taxed the Chinese immigrants. Outraged, they revolted against the Spanish, but were wiped out. later, several tens of thousands Chinese immigrant to the Philippines, handling many different occupations. I discovered an interesting one at the museum, the public reader (讀書員) who reads and writes letters for illiterate Chinese.\n\nThe last part of the museum showcased famous Tsinoy. I noted three figures that were especially interesting: Ang Kiukok 洪救國 a famous painter known for painting fighting cocks, rabid dogs, and people wrapped in chains; Jeffrey Ching 莊祖欣, a famous sinologist and musician whose original research focused on the ancient court music of the Qin Emperor; and Lin Huixiang 林惠祥, a scholar who made many anthropological contributions.\n\nWhen I surveyed the information boards of all these talented, brave, and hard-working Tsinoy, I thought about my own journey through life as a Chinese-American: where would I be in ten years, and what achievements will I have made? In short, the museum was eye-opening, not only in realizing the power of the Chinese spirit, but that beyond racial and national boundaries, talent and genius can be found anywhere.\n\nChinatown and Mabini\n\nMy next stop was Chinatown. The museum was a great source of information, but I would not understand Tsinoy culture enough through the intellect alone: I needed to see it. I crossed the bridge to Chinatown–the environment was immediately different: boats small and large by the bank, towering buildings aged and modern, and sprawling car and pedestrian traffic.\n\nLater, I passed by the Filipino-Tsinoy friendship gate. I couldn’t find many places to eat, but I noticed there were a lot of banks trilingual in Chinese, tagalog, and English. Every bank had two officers armed with shotguns. By the time I reached the end of Chinatown, I asked one of the bank guards where Chinatown ended. He didn’t know either, but he really had an air of heroism: tall, built, sunglasses, and he was grinning. He looked ready to put shrapnel into anyone who had the slightest thought of robbing the bank.\n\nI passed by what looked like a Chinese school; I left pretty quickly because a bunch of bicycle taxi’s started shouting at me to use their service. After that, I walked along the man-made canal. It was very grungy and polluted with all sorts of trash: clothes, plastic bags, mysterious garbage, and I think I saw dead fish (nothing could survive in there). Then I saw a sign: Tsinoy-Filipino cooperation for a cleaner river. Up ahead, there was a man on a small little boat collecting trash. I thought to myself, if this is what they consider clean, they’re not doing a good enough job.\n\nLater, I stopped by a small dimsum restaurant and had some hao gao and siu mai, then I walked back to my hotel. After my nap, it was already about seven or eight pm, so I went to the bar next door, had a few beers and adobo (simmered lamb meat). I had planned to go to Mabini, the more happening part of town. First, I stopped by some of the food stands.\n\nThe first snack I had were chicken balls drenched in sweet, sour, and hot sauce. These were delicious, and the texture was excellent. I then tried a hotdog which was packed with cheese, vegetables, ketchup, and mustard (didn’t get to try the burger). One of the customers I talked to suggested I try the Filipino delicacy, freid chicken intestine. That was also delicious, especially with the sauce.\n\nIt was raining by then. I got on the jeepney to Mabini. There were bars, but also a lot of places to karaoke. I spent the rest of the night sitting on a Japanese karaoke bar drinking coke and whiskey, chatting with the beautiful ladies who worked there for a few hours. Then I hopped back on the jeepney toward my hotel. I almost didn’t make it to breakfast the next morning.\n\nMall of Asia\n\nThe next day I vistited the Mall of Asia, which stretches about 50 meters and boasts the largest mall in Asia. You can buy pretty much anything there, from power tools to musical instruments. It felt completely different from the rest of Manila, but probably because compared to the rest of the city, it was a location for rampant consumerism. There was also a large ice-skating rink and two movie theaters. Many expats were here too, and tourists.\n\nMy favorite part of the mall was the outdoors area facing the sea. By that time, it was raining, but the palm trees and rolling grey waves was still very beautiful. Some interesting shops: the cock shop, which sold shirts and products all featuring fighting cocks. I really wish I had seen fighting cocks do battle after seeing this store. On the upper floors, there was a toystore that looked like a fun place to work.\n\nIf I wanted to go on a shopping spree, the Mall of Asia would definitely be one of my top choices. Before I left, I bought some souvenirs at the Filipino culture store such as mango snacks and rum-flavored cigars.\n\nJeepney Ride to the Airport\n\nBy 6pm, I was ready to leave. I found a taxi, but he said he would only take me to the airport for 300 pp. I didn’t exchange enough money (and I had to pay the airport terminal fee of 750 pp), so he took me to the main roads instead.\n\nIt was raining really hard by then, and traffic was at an all time slow. I got soaked as soon as I left the taxi, and then I hopped on the nearest jeepney. It was the wrong one, but the young kid next to the driver led me to the jeepney that would take me to the airport.\n\nAs I sat on the jeepney, the sky began to get dark. The driver was blasting his stereo (imagine Santana soloing), and then I took a few pictures of the urban scenery. The rain never stopped—it just kept pounding and pounding, to the point cars were basically swimming in the flood of rain. Sometimes it cleared up, but it was the worst going downhill where water flow wasn’t well controlled.\n\nThe smell of gas and smoke singed my nostrils—that was how horrible traffic was. By this time, I felt really comfortable around the locals, especially compared to how I felt in the beginning. The Filipino people are very warm-hearted and are willing to help those in need. Everyone I asked for directions or for help did not hesitate to give me guidance, and for that I was very thankful.\n\nBack to Taiwan: reflections\n\nI jumped out of the jeepney and made my way to the airport. My shoes and socks were soaked, but this was inevitable. I had made it to the airport wet, but unscathed. After eating and checking in, I got to the security check where the guards confiscated my lam ba nog (coconut liquor) because it was flammable. they told me to drink it, so I chugged it with water and then felt fuzzy and warm from the alcohol. I finally boarded the plane and was on my way back home, where I would still have to take a five hour bus ride to Tainan.\n\nAlthough my trip to the Philippines was short, I can’t forget the urban landscape I found there, and the friendly people who looked at me with wonder and always treated me warmly. On the other hand, the government faces the problem of the gap between the wealthy and the poor—the images of naked running children, people brushing their teeth on the sides of the street, abandoned buildings, and the children who approached me with hopes that I will help them have all left a deep imprint in my heart. But, I believe with determination and help from the government the Filipino people will solve their problems and the Philippines will become more than just a place for tourists and expats. There is a special atmosphere and energy: even when a city like Manila is pounded by the great force of water and rain, the people and culture there cannot be extinguished or erased.\n\nIt’s been a wild Spring season here in Tainan. I taught English pretty much every day, and classes at the Chinese Language Center (CLC) were pretty rigorous, but I also had a lot of fun. Our class made a movie which was a sequel to The Peach Blossom Spring, and I participated in the Dragon Boat Race earlier this month. Sometimes the classes seemed never ending, but looking back, although the classes were full of challenges, I learned a lot. Below is a summary of each class this term.\n\nChinese Literature, Advanced III (I-2班)\n\nAlthough we were studying literature, the main focus of the core class was still learning language. Every lesson included a list of vocabulary with definitions and examples of usage. When we started reading classical Chinese, the teacher also began teaching Chinese idioms (cheng yu 成語), using the characters we learned in each lesson as a spring board. In addition to class discussion, different medias to teach the class (music, video, photos), we also learned ‘rhetoric’ of Chinese literature, such as the different uses of metaphor, parallelism, symbolism, among others. Like any core class, there were a lot of presentations, tests, homework, and writing assignments. I got used to my papers all marked in red ink pretty quick.\n\nAdvanced Expression （高級表達)\n\nThe learning goal was to teach students to express clearly and accurately, using advanced modes of expression and suitable vocabulary. The teacher gave us writing assignments, presentations, and taught idiom usage/context-based vocabulary use.\n\nThe writing assignments varied, for example, sometimes we took an extremely glib essay and revised it with more clarity and brevity. Other times, we wrote dialogues and performed them in front of the class (i.e. Dad’s Turn at Quitting Smoking). The most interesting assignment was writing a story based on an unfinished story: we were given a passage about a blind boy whose cardboard sign asking for help proved ineffective, until a man came by and rewrote it. We began adding content the story where the boy asks the man who he is, and what he wrote.\n\nThe presentations were okay. For example, a three minute presentation on which single Chinese character best represents Taiwan, or describing your shop (without revealing what it is) and having students guess what kind of shop it is. Besides regular class lecture, we had many activities where we all had to cooperate. In one session, we all took turns as reporters/interviewers on current events. In another, we role-played a law-case with three parties, all with lawyers: a husband, a wife, and the ‘secret lover.’ I got stuck playing the secret lover part. I was accused of apparently drugging the husband and seducing him afterwards (thanks 艾倫).\n\nChinese Stories (中國故事)\n\nThis class focused on improving reading abilities in Chinese and also gave students a chance to understand Chinese culture through folk and other well-known stories. Most of them were parables, but there was one love story （Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai 梁山伯與祝英臺) and a shortened version of a chapter from Romance of the Three Kingdoms 三國演義 (草船借箭). The teacher assigned readings every week, and each reading had sentences or vocabulary exercises at the end.\n\nCalligraphy (書法)\n\nMr. Huang taught this class. One would expect the calligraphy teacher to be an elder Chinese gentleman with a flowing air of erudition around him, but Mr. Huang was just a really chill teacher in his mid-late 20s from Kaohsiung. I took his calligraphy class in the Winter to learn the basic Kaishu 楷書 script, which I have yet to truly master. During the Spring, he taught us the running-hand script (xingkai shu 行楷書), which is more cursive-like, yet it still adheres to the structured forms of standard script. Next, we moved on to actual running script (xingshu 行書), a cursive calligraphy style, though the characters are still recognizable compared to grass script (caoshu 草書）。 The final was really hard, and I messed up a lot. I had to write a a 28 character poem (7-character quatrains 七言絕句). Below is my translation of this poem.\n\nOn the River, Seeing off Scholar Li 江上送別李秀才\n\nby Wei Zhuang 韋莊 (Tang 唐)\n\nMountains of thousand mangroves and myriads of clouds,\n\n千山紅樹萬山雲,\n\nWine in hand I face and see sun, once again turned to dusk.\n\n把酒相看日又曛.\n\nOne more song of separation that moves us to tears,\n\n一曲離歌兩行淚,\n\nFor I cannot know when we will meet again.\n\n不知何地再逢君.\n\nlearning chinese is Hard.\n\nEven after almost four years Chinese language training, I still feel my spoken Chinese is very weak. I could barely give extemporaneous speeches in class and relied a lot on scripts I had already written out. The writing process also felt more and more slow as the term went on. Although I’ve learned a lot of vocabulary, it’s difficult to find the right situation to use it in conversation, or even to use it in written form.\n\nIn short, having full control of the language is still a problem and can only be dealt with by using it. All four language components—speaking, listening, reading, writing—could use some work. But I can’t forget what a friend of mine said (he’s been studying Chinese a lot longer than me): the environment is the best teacher of the language and culture.\n\nplow through mountains of books.\n\nRecently I’ve reviewed all the class material and have begun writing four Chinese vocabulary notebooks with the Chinese characters, pronunciation, and definition: 1) vocabulary learned in the language classes, casual reading such as magazines or newspapers, and the internet; 2) Chinese idioms, common adages; 3) Chinese literature; 4) Classical Chinese.\n\nThis month, I’ve also been busy collecting reading material for the Summer (which I wont be able to finish), such as Lu Xun’s A Brief History of Chinese Fiction 中國小說史略, works by A Ying 阿英, resources on Chinese xiaoshuo, Chinese prose and poetry, and lots and lots of Classical Chinese. I hope that through reading and taking lots of notes, I can shrink my knowledge gap in Chinese language & literature, because everything in graduate school will take two or three times the effort to read, write, and comprehend compared to Chinese graduate students. I think the greatest challenges in graduate school will be difficulty with the language, completing assignments/tests with good marks, publishing and defending my thesis, and presenting at conferences (all in Chinese). Looks like I will be spending lots of time in the Professor’s office and in the library this coming Autumn."
