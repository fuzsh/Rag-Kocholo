        "text": "Saying goodbye to Cambridge again by Xu Zhimo\n\nFollow the Chinese tourists as you walk behind Trinity, Clare and King’s colleges.\n\nThey will lead you unerringly to this Beijing marble stone inscribed with the first and last verses of the best loved poem by China’s most popular poet.\n\nXu had been in an arranged marriage when he arrived to study English in Cambridge in 1921, but he fell in love with another woman, Lin Huiyin, despite her already being promised to someone else. In 1922 he returned to China and fell in love again, this time with Lu Xiaoman, the wife of a friend. They married in 1926, but their families ostracised them, there were money troubles, and Lu became depressed. Xu died in a plane crash in 1931, allegedly flying to meet Lin Huiyin.\n\nHe wrote the poem after a second and final visit to Cambridge in 1928. Every Chinese schoolchild learns it by heart, along with the story of Xu and Lin.\n\nStand a moment with the tourists, as they recall their own movings on; gently flicking their sleeves, not taking away even a wisp of cloud.\n\nSaying good-bye to Cambridge again\n\nVery quietly I take my leave\n\nAs quietly as I came here;\n\nQuietly I wave good-bye\n\nTo the rosy clouds in the western sky.\n\nThe golden willows by the riverside\n\nAre young brides in the setting sun;\n\nTheir reflections on the shimmering waves\n\nAlways linger in the depth of my heart.\n\nThe floating heart growing in the sludge\n\nSways leisurely under the water;\n\nIn the gentle waves of Cambridge\n\nI would be a water plant!\n\nThat pool under the shade of elm trees\n\nHolds not water but the rainbow from the sky;\n\nShattered to pieces among the duckweeds\n\nIs the sediment of a rainbow-like dream?\n\nTo seek a dream? Just to pole a boat upstream\n\nTo where the green grass is more verdant;\n\nOr to have the boat fully loaded with starlight\n\nAnd sing aloud in the splendor of starlight.\n\nBut I cannot sing aloud\n\nQuietness is my farewell music;\n\nEven summer insects heap silence for me\n\nSilent is Cambridge tonight!"
