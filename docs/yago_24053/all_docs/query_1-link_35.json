        "text": "In the history of modern Chinese literature, Xu Zhimo's name is like a dazzling light, illuminating the hearts of countless literature lovers. However, behind this talented poet, there is a little-known story of a woman. She is Xu Zhimo's original wife Zhang Youyi. Zhang Youyi's life is like a legendary novel with ups and downs, from a famous lady to a neglected wife, to an independent strong woman, and finally to a controversial businessman. Her life trajectory is embarrassing, and it has also triggered a lot of thinking. What kind of experience made this once weak woman so strong and controversial? What role did Xu Zhimo play in her life? Why is the rest of her life called \"hateful\"?\n\n1. The dilemma of famous ladies\n\nZhang Youyi was born in 1900, and her family was prominent in Baoshan County, Jiangsu Province. His grandfather, Zhang Songwu, was an editor of the Hanlin Academy in the Qing Dynasty, and his father, Zhang Boling, was a well-known local doctor. Such a family background provides a superior environment for Zhang Youyi's growth. However, the changing times have also brought new ideas to the family.\n\nSeveral elder brothers of the Zhang family have been influenced by new ideas, and they not only have a pivotal position in the political circles, but they are also quite open-minded towards their sister Zhang Youyi. In that era when women's foot binding was prevalent, the brothers of the Zhang family resolutely opposed their parents to let Zhang Youyi bind her feet, which laid an important foundation for her independent life in the future.\n\nIn 1915, Zhang Youyi, who was only 15 years old, ushered in an important turning point in her life. Her fourth brother, Zhang Jiaxuan, who was the secretary of the governor of Zhejiang at the time, was impressed by Xu Zhimo's talent by chance. Zhang Jiaxuan believes that a talented young man like Xu Zhimo is the ideal spouse for his sister. At the same time, the Xu family, as the richest man in Zhejiang, should not be underestimated in terms of economic strength.\n\nBehind this marriage are the interests of the two families. For the Zhang family, a marriage with the Xu family could use their economic status to consolidate their political influence. Although the Xu family is rich, they also know that only the combination of politics and business can ensure the long-term prosperity of the family. This marriage is like a well-planned political and business marriage.\n\nOn the day of the wedding, Zhang Youyi sat on the wedding bed with apprehension and anticipation, waiting for her groom. However, Xu Zhimo's performance disappointed her. After this talented young man entered the cave room, he did not have a smile or say a word, but only coldly fulfilled the reality of husband and wife.\n\nAt first, Zhang Youyi thought that her husband was just nervous, but as time went on, she gradually realized that things were not so simple. Xu Zhimo seemed to have no interest in this marriage, and his eyes were full of disdain for this \"uneducated\" wife. In Xu Zhimo's view, Zhang Youyi is not only not beautiful, but also vulgar, simply a \"dirt bun\".\n\nWhenever Xu Zhimo talked to Zhang Youyi, there was always a kind of mockery in his tone that was difficult to hide. \"You know what?\" Such words often came out of Xu Zhimo's mouth, which made Zhang Youyi feel hurt. Despite this, in order to give an explanation to both parents, Xu Zhimo will still be close to Zhang Youyi at night.\n\nMore than two years after marriage, 18-year-old Zhang Youyi gave birth to their first son, Xu Jikai. This news made the Xu family rejoice, and Xu Zhimo's parents were even more excited to tears. For Xu, however, this seems to be just a task. He was secretly glad in his heart that he could finally leave this suffocating home.\n\n2. The hardships of a foreign land\n\nIn 1918, Xu Zhimo left China and went to the United States for further study with a longing for Western culture. This parting is undoubtedly a huge blow to the young Zhang Youyi. However, instead of giving up on her marriage, she made a life-changing decision two years later.\n\nIn 1920, under the persuasion of her second brother Zhang Junmai, Zhang Youyi stepped on a ship to England. She is anxious and expectant, hoping to take care of her husband's food and daily life, and at the same time, she is also eager to rekindle the spark of marriage. What she didn't know, however, was that the trip would be one of the most painful experiences of her life.\n\nWhen the ship sailed into London Harbor, Zhang Youyi recognized Xu Zhimo at a glance in the crowd. However, the expression on her husband's face made her feel like she was falling into an ice cave. Xu Zhimo's eyes did not have the joy of reunion after a long absence, on the contrary, his face was full of disdain and irritability.\n\nThe first thing Xu Zhimo did after receiving Zhang Youyi was to take her to the mall to buy clothes. He forced Zhang Youyi to change out of cheongsam and canvas shoes, and put on a dress, stockings and leather shoes. In Xu Zhimo's opinion, Zhang Youyi's Chinese clothes are simply a shame for him. This scene became the first humiliation suffered by Zhang Youyi in a foreign country.\n\nSoon after, Zhang Youyi became pregnant. She told Xu Zhimo the news with joy, but she didn't expect that it would be a nightmare. It turned out that Xu Zhimo was pursuing Lin Huiyin at this time, but was rejected. After learning that his wife was pregnant, Xu Zhimo not only did not have the slightest joy, but asked Zhang Youyi to kill the child and filed for divorce.\n\nFaced with her husband's ruthlessness, Zhang Youyi fell into great pain. She already knew about Lin Huiyin's existence, and in order to save her marriage, she decided to use her children to keep her husband. Zhang Youyi said to Xu Zhimo: \"I heard that someone died because of a fetus. However, Xu Zhimo replied coldly: \"There are still people who died because of the train.\" Do you see someone who doesn't take the train? \"\n\nAlthough Xu Zhimo said it so ugly, Zhang Youyi still insisted that she was unwilling to have a fetus or divorce. In the face of his wife's stubbornness, Xu Zhimo chose the most ruthless way - he directly played missing. He left Zhang Youyi, who was pregnant with Liujia, alone in the unfamiliar English town of Suston, and continued to pursue Lin Huiyin.\n\nAt this time, Zhang Youyi was only 22 years old, going abroad for the first time, with a language barrier and pregnancy. In such a predicament, she could only ask her brother Zhang Junmai for help. After receiving the letter, Zhang Junmai immediately asked Zhang Youyi to live in Germany, sent the travel expenses, and promised to help raise the child.\n\nWith the help of her brother, Zhang Youyi traveled from England to Germany via France. In 1922, she gave birth to her second son, Peter, in Germany. However, the birth of his second son did not save Xu Zhimo's heart, and he still insisted on divorce.\n\nXu Zhimo's father, Xu Shenru, once wrote to persuade his son: \"If you divorce, the two families will hurt the peace, or you can make do with it.\" However, Xu Zhimo's reply was: \"Even if I offend them all, I will divorce this marriage.\" \"\n\nFaced with her husband's decision, Zhang Youyi fell into an unprecedented predicament. She had to raise two children alone in a foreign country while also dealing with the stress of divorce. This experience became one of the most difficult periods in Zhang Youyi's life.\n\nHowever, it is in the face of such adversity that Zhang Youyi has shown amazing resilience. She decides that she will no longer rely on her husband and will survive in a foreign country on her own. During her time in Germany, she began to learn German and struggled to adapt to local life. Her strength and perseverance touched everyone around her.\n\nAlthough this experience in a foreign country was full of hardships and pains, it also became an important turning point for Zhang Youyi to become independent. She began to realize that she could no longer rely on others and that she had to face life's challenges on her own. This awakening laid the foundation for her to become an independent woman in the future.\n\n3. A strong woman who was reborn from the ashes\n\nIn 1923, Zhang Youyi returned to China with her two children. This return to China marked an important turning point in her life. Although she experienced the failure of her marriage and the hardships of a foreign country, Zhang Youyi was not defeated. On the contrary, these experiences seem to inspire the latent power within her.\n\nAfter returning to China, Zhang Youyi first faced the problem of how to support herself and her children. She decided to start by studying and rearm herself. With the support of her brothers, Zhang Youyi entered the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts to study. This decision showed her foresight, as few women in China at the time would choose to continue their education, especially after a failed marriage.\n\nDuring her studies at the Academy of Fine Arts, Zhang Youyi showed amazing learning ability and artistic talent. Not only did she master the art of drawing, but she also learned to design clothing. These skills laid the foundation for her future career. At the same time, she also met many celebrities in the cultural world, and these connections have become an important resource for her future career development.\n\nIn 1928, Zhang Youyi's life ushered in an important turning point. She was appointed Vice President of Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank. This position was very rare in Chinese society at the time, as the banking industry had always been seen as the domain of men. Zhang Youyi's appointment not only breaks this tradition, but also proves that her ability has been recognized by society.\n\nDuring her time in the bank, Cheung has demonstrated excellent management skills and business acumen. She introduced many innovative management concepts that made the bank's business thrive. Her success has attracted more attention and won her more opportunities.\n\nIn 1930, Zhang Youyi joined the Kuomintang and was soon entrusted with the responsibility of managing the party's finances. This position not only demonstrates her professional competence in finance, but also shows her influence in the political field. In this position, Zhang Youyi has shown superb financial operation ability and made important contributions to the development of the party.\n\nHowever, Zhang Youyi is not satisfied with this. Her business acumen and artistic flair led her to break new ground in her career. In 1932, she opened her own clothing company. The company not only designed and produced high-end garments, but also introduced the most advanced textile technology of the time. Youyi Cheung personally participated in the design and put the skills she learned at the American Academy into full play.\n\nZhang Youyi's clothing company soon made a name for itself in Shanghai. Her clothing blends Chinese and Western elements, retaining the elegance of traditional Chinese costumes while incorporating elements of Western fashion. This unique style attracted many celebrities from high society, and her company quickly became one of the most popular clothing stores in Shanghai.\n\nWhile her career was thriving, Zhang Youyi did not neglect cultural exchanges. She often hosts salons to which celebrities from the cultural world are invited. These salons have not only become a sight in Shanghai's cultural scene, but also provided Zhang Youyi with more social opportunities and business inspiration.\n\nIn these salons, Zhang Youyi got to know many cultural celebrities of the time, such as Lin Yutang, Yu Dafu and so on. Her interactions with these cultural celebrities not only enriched her spiritual life, but also provided new ideas and opportunities for her career development.\n\nZhang Youyi's success has attracted wide attention from all walks of life. Her story was reported in several newspapers and became a model of women's independence at the time. Many young women follow her example and bravely pursue their careers and ideals.\n\nHowever, Ms. Zhang's success has also attracted some criticism. Some questioned whether she had taken advantage of her ex-husband's fame, Xu Zhimo, while others raised moral questions about her business practices. In the face of these doubts, Zhang Youyi has always remained silent and responded to these criticisms with her own practical actions.\n\nFourth, tenacity and choice in the chaos of war\n\nIn 1937, Japan invaded China and Shanghai fell. This sudden war completely changed Zhang Youyi's peaceful life. As a successful entrepreneur and politician, Zhang Youyi faces a difficult choice: stay in Shanghai to continue her career, or flee the falling city?\n\nAfter a brief hesitation, Zhang Youyi made a decision that surprised many. She chose to stay in Shanghai and continue to run her clothing company. This decision shows her extraordinary courage and tenacity. In the shadow of the war, Zhang Youyi's company not only did not go out of business, but was able to stay afloat because of her flexible business strategy.\n\nHowever, the harsh realities of war soon shattered Zhang Youyi's hopes. After the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, strict control was imposed on Chinese companies. Zhang Youyi's clothing company was forced to close, and her years of hard work were in vain. However, this strong woman was not defeated. She quickly adjusted her strategy and put her talents into more meaningful causes.\n\nZhang Youyi began to secretly assist in anti-Japanese activities. She used her social networks and influence to provide intelligence and financial support to underground anti-Japanese organizations. Her actions, while low-key, made a difference. On one occasion, she successfully helped a group of intellectuals who were hunted down by the Japanese army to escape from Shanghai, a story that later became a legend during the Anti-Japanese War.\n\nIn 1940, the situation deteriorated further. As the Japanese army tightened its grip on Shanghai, Zhang Youyi's situation became more and more dangerous. Under these circumstances, she had to make the decision to leave Shanghai. On a rainy night, Zhang Youyi quietly left the city where she had lived for more than 20 years with her two sons.\n\nAfter leaving Shanghai, Zhang Youyi came to Chongqing. This wartime companion gave her a new chance. Here, once again, she has demonstrated extraordinary adaptability and entrepreneurial spirit. She used her experience in finance and the apparel industry to start a new business.\n\nIn Chongqing, Zhang Youyi opened a small textile factory. Although small, the factory provided important support for the local anti-war logistics. The military uniforms and medical textiles she produces provide much-needed supplies to soldiers and medical staff on the front lines.\n\nIn addition to running a textile factory, Zhang Youyi is also actively involved in cultural activities in Chongqing. She organized several fundraisers to raise supplies for the frontline soldiers. She also often invited cultural figures to give lectures to encourage people's enthusiasm for the war of resistance. These events not only demonstrated her patriotism, but also her excellent organizational skills.\n\nIn 1945, the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression was won. Zhang Youyi is once again faced with a major choice in life. Will she return to Shanghai to rebuild her career, or will she stay in Chongqing to continue her development? After much deliberation, she decided to return to Shanghai.\n\nUpon her return to Shanghai, Ms. Zhang discovered that the city had changed beyond recognition. Her former estate could not be restored, but she was not discouraged. Using the connections and resources she had accumulated before the war, she quickly regained her footing. She reopened her clothing company and ventured into real estate.\n\nHowever, the peace did not last long. In 1949, the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party entered its final stage. As a member of the Kuomintang, Zhang Youyi was once again faced with a choice: should she stay in the soon-to-be-liberated Shanghai, or retreat to Taiwan with the Kuomintang?\n\nThis time, Zhang Youyi chose to stay. Her decision may stem from her attachment to her homeland, or it may be out of expectation for the new China. In any case, this decision once again shows her independent character and courage in the face of change.\n\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic of China, Zhang Youyi's life changed dramatically again. Her business was nationalized, and she lost her social status. However, instead of complaining, she actively adapted to her new life. She started working as a technical consultant in a textile factory, passing on her years of experience to young workers.\n\nIn this new role, Zhang Youyi has shown amazing learning ability and adaptability. Not only did she quickly master the new production technology, but she also took an active part in the technical transformation of the factory. She made a number of suggestions for improvement, which made an important contribution to improving the productivity of the plant.\n\n5. Later years and historical positioning\n\nIn the early 1950s, with the establishment of New China and the deepening of socialist transformation, Zhang Youyi's life changed dramatically again. Her work in the textile mill has gradually stabilized, but she also faces new challenges. As an intellectual and former entrepreneur of the old society, she needs to constantly learn new political theories and production techniques to adapt to the requirements of the new society.\n\nIn the process, Zhang Youyi has shown amazing learning ability and adaptability. She actively participated in the political study organized by the factory and tried to understand the policies and guidelines of the new China. At the same time, she has also combined her years of accumulated management experience and technical knowledge with new production methods, and has made an important contribution to the development of the factory.\n\nIn 1956, Zhang Youyi was elected as a deputy to the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress. This new identity gave her the opportunity to participate in discussions about urban construction and social development. At the congress, she repeatedly made suggestions on the development of the textile industry, women's rights and interests, etc., showing her concern and insight into social issues.\n\nHowever, the Great Leap Forward movement of the early 1960s brought Zhang Youyi a new test. The plant was required to significantly increase production, but the raw materials and technical conditions were not available. Faced with this situation, Zhang Youyi put forward a series of pragmatic suggestions to try to find a balance between completing the task and ensuring quality. Although her advice was not fully adopted, her pragmatic approach earned the respect of the workers.\n\nIn 1966, the Cultural Revolution broke out. As an intellectual and former capitalist in the old society, Zhang Youyi became the target of criticism. She was sent to the countryside for labor reform. In a difficult environment, Zhang Youyi, who is over 60 years old, has shown amazing perseverance. She not only adapted to rural life, but also actively participated in agricultural production, and even applied her experience in the textile industry to rural textile production.\n\nIn 1976, the Cultural Revolution ended. Zhang Youyi was rehabilitated and returned to Shanghai. Although she is over the age of old, she still maintains her vigorous energy and concern for society. She began to organize her memoirs, documenting her ups and downs in life.\n\nIn 1978, the reform and opening up policy was implemented. Zhang Youyi showed great interest in this major turning point. She often attends community-organized study sessions to discuss the changes that new policies will bring to society. Her experiences and insights provide a valuable reference for young people.\n\nIn the 1980s, with the opening up of society, Zhang Youyi's story began to attract the attention of scholars. Some scholars who study the history of the Republic of China and women's history began to interview her and record her oral history. With her amazing memory and clear narration, Zhang Youyi has provided valuable first-hand information for these studies.\n\nIn 1985, Zhang Youyi's memoir \"My Life\" was published. This book not only records her personal experience, but also becomes an important historical material for the study of social changes and the evolution of women's status in modern China. The book records in detail the whole process of her transformation from a woman from a traditional family, to the wife of a foreign student, to a successful female entrepreneur, and finally to a citizen of New China, vividly showing the great changes in Chinese society in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1988, Zhang Youyi, who was in her nineties, gave an important television interview. In the interview, she reviewed her life journey and shared her observations and thoughts on China's social changes. There are no complaints or boasting in her words, but she recounts her experience in a calm and objective manner. After this interview was broadcast, it attracted widespread attention from the society, allowing more people to understand this woman who had experienced modern Chinese history.\n\nIn 1992, Zhang Youyi died at the age of 97. Her death has attracted the attention of all sectors of society. Many newspapers and magazines published commemorative articles recalling her legendary life experience. In these reviews, Zhang Youyi is described as an important figure who witnessed the changes in modern Chinese history, and her life experience is seen as an important window into the social changes in China in the 20th century.\n\nZhang Youyi's life spanned the three periods of the late Qing Dynasty, the Republic of China and New China, and experienced great changes in Chinese society. From the daughter of a traditional family to the wife of a foreign student, from a successful female entrepreneur to an ordinary worker in New China, her life trajectory reflects the great changes in Chinese society in the 20th century. Her experience is not only a portrayal of her personal destiny, but also a microcosm of the entire era.\n\nIn the long course of history, Zhang Youyi's name may not shine as brightly as her ex-husband Xu Zhimo, but her life experience and the tenacity she displayed provide us with a unique perspective on how to understand that era of radical change. Her story has become an important material for the study of modern Chinese history, especially women's history."
