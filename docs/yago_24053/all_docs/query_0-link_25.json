        "text": "Synopsis\n\nZhang Youyi's name is inseparable from Xu Zhimo's, and her emotional entanglements with him were over half a century. She was not as shining as Lin Huiyin; she was more like a plain companion. Behind this romantic scholar, the halo as his first wife lost the color it deserved. With delicate tone like poetry, this book depicts the emotional entanglement through Zhang Youyi and Xu Zhimo through her whole life.\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title."
