        "text": "Xu zhimo was one of the modern famous romantic poets of 20C. He was given the name of Zhangxu (ç« å¿) and the courtesy name of Yousen (æ§±æ£®), later changed his courtesy name to Zhimo (å¿æ©). He was graduated from Peking University and then came to the Cambridge to study policy and economy. After two years studying in Cambridge, he was deeply influenced by the romanticism and aesthetic poets of Europe and America. In 1922 he went back to China and became a leader of the modern poetry movement. In 1923, he founded the Crescent Moon Society.\n\nXu, a great poet, lived quite short life, however, he made great contribution to world and Chinese literature. He was one of the first Chinese writers to successfully naturalize Western romantic forms into modern Chinese poetry. His poetries are the treasure of world literature.\n\nabout love\n\nXu’s first wife was Zhang Youyi(sister of Chinese famous politician Junyou Zhang), however, this was an arranged marriage, Xu didn’t love Zhang anymore. Both of them didn’t know each other and had’t seen each other until they got married. In 1921, while in London, Xu came across Lin Huiyin and soon fell in love with her, although Zhang gave birth to two sons, Xu still divorced his wife. Being not told Xu’s marriage, Lin went back to China and refused Xu. Four years later, Xu met his last lover- Lu Xiaoman-a married woman. For the love they want, they betrayed their family and friends, finally they got married. But not for long, Lu became more and more depressed, Xu had to take several jobs in different cities to fill the large expenses by Lu. As early as eight o'clock on November 19, 1931, Xu Zhimo flied to participate Lin Huiyin’s evening lecture organized by the Chinese architectural art. When the aircraft arrived in Jinan(æµå) area, it suddenly became foggy. Unexpectedly, the aircraft crashed into the mountains, all the crew - two pilots and Xu died in this accident.\n\nPoetry\n\nãåå«åº·æ¡¥ã\n\nSaying Good-bye to Cambridge Again\n\nå¾å¿æ© by Xu Zhimo\n\nè½»è½»çæèµ°äºï¼ Very quietly I take my leave\n\næ­£å¦æè½»è½»çæ¥ï¼ As quietly as I came here;\n\næè½»è½»çææï¼ Quietly I wave good-bye\n\nä½å«è¥¿å¤©çäºå½©ã To the rosy clouds in the western sky.\n\né£æ²³ççéæ³ The golden willows by the riverside\n\næ¯å¤é³ä¸­çæ°å¨ Are young brides in the setting sun\n\næ³¢å éçè³å½±ï¼ Their reflections on the shimmering waves\n\nå¨æçå¿å¤´è¡æ¼¾ã Always linger in the depth of my heart.\n\nè½¯æ³¥ä¸çéèï¼ The floatingheart growing in the sludge\n\næ²¹æ²¹çå¨æ°´åºææï¼ Sways leisurely under the water;\n\nå¨åº·æ²³çææ³¢éï¼ In the gentle waves of Cambridge\n\næçå¿åä¸æ¡æ°´è I would be a water plant!\n\né£æ¦è«ä¸çä¸æ½­ï¼ That pool under the shade of elm trees\n\nä¸æ¯æ¸ æ³ï¼æ¯å¤©ä¸è¹ Holds not water but the rainbow from the sky;\n\næç¢å¨æµ®è»é´ï¼ Shattered to pieces among the duckweeds\n\næ²æ·çå½©è¹ä¼¼çæ¢¦ã Is the sediment of a rainbow-like dream?\n\nå¯»æ¢¦ï¼ æä¸æ¯é¿ç¯ï¼ To seek a dream?
