        "text": "This article examines \"China\" in contemporary American poetry using the example of Timothy Yu's poems, titled \"Chinese Silence,\" which rewrite and / or parody texts from the American literary canon as well as public communication. It proposes a hallof-mirrors reading of these poems in order to show how Yu's poems refer to, reflect on, and relocate other authors' writing of \"China.\" It argues that Yu's poems, instead of making claims for an authentic \"China,\" attempt to bring Chinese Americans' lived experience into the American literary tradition.\n\nMichelle Yeh, Professor of Chinese Literature at the University of California, Davis, is arguably the most well known scholar writing in English on modern Chinese poetry. Yet she was not always a critic of Chinese literature. In this interview, CLT Deputy Editor in Chief Jonathan Stalling speaks with Yeh about her life-long interest in poetry, her career&#39;s shift into Chinese poetry, and some exciting new directions her work will take in the future. Along the way, Yeh explores the continually shifting yet always intertwined relationship between classical and modern Chinese poetry.\n\nFew Chinese poets who have come to prominence after the Misty Poetry phenomenon of the early to mid 1980s have cast a longer shadow than Wang Jiaxin. Wang, Professor of Literature at Renmin university (one of China’s most prestigious), is not only a major poet, but also an important editor and translator, and an influential literary critic. Because he is known for his uniquely cosmopolitan, existential style, many in China associate him with the so-called intellectual school, a term that would likely signal an “academic” flavor to most Western readers—but this simply would not be an accurate assessment ofWang’s poetic style. Through this interview with sinologist John Crespi, readers will gain a strong sense of Wang’s intimately subjective yet radically cosmopolitan poetics as he discusses the work of Western poets from Paul Celan to Emily Dickens, the relationship between writing and translating poetry, and the existential dislocation of physical/external locations and the psychological/ interior space of poets, such as himself, who have composed a significant body of work outside their homeland."
