        "text": "I am so thrilled to share that my NYU Tisch School of the Arts NYU Tisch Film & TV thesis film #POP! is finally hitting film festivals with its World Premiere at NewFilmmakers Los Angeles (NFMLA) on Saturday, August 3rd in Block 3 at 7:30pm. POP! is my most personal work so far, and I‚Äôm honored and humbled to finally be able to share with an audience. Logline/Synopsis POP! follows the travails of an unemployed, thirtysomething Chinese American woman living at home with her mother, as she obsesses over ways to remedy or mask her adult acne in time for a family friend‚Äôs Chinese New Year banquet, where she hopes to reunite with an old high school crush.

It‚Äôs been quite the ride over the last few weeks to get this all together ‚Äî Along with my project partner Anthony Ma , we wanted to commemorate the 40th year mark of Vincent Chin‚Äôs tragic murder that triggered the first nationwide Asian American civil rights movement. On Thursday, we hosted a series of virtual conversations with key players who contributed or were a part of Vincent Chin‚Äôs life, case, and the movement. We are so grateful to have found partners for our event. Thank you to NextShark for giving us a home. The event was live on Zoom and on Facebook through our event page ‚Äî https://lnkd.in/geFBxxGh. The recording is up on the event page, so if you missed, feel free to check this out! Unfortunately, the first 30 mins weren‚Äôt live/recorded, due to a technical glitch (technology is hard). What you may have missed is that Gary Koivu was unable to join the conversation to speak about Vincent - we would‚Äôve loved to learn who Vincent was through him. It was a last minute surprise for us as well, so we had to rush to solve the situation. Luckily during our research journey, we‚Äôve recorded most of our interviews for our own research purposes, and little did we know, we would eventually use them in this kind of way. With every door that‚Äôs closed opens a new one. Although Gary didn‚Äôt join us, it did give us the opportunity to play some clips from our interview with him and give you a glimpse of what we‚Äôve picked up along the way. Some of the photos that we showed are from our personal research album, articles, stills from ‚ÄúWho Killed Vincent Chin?‚Äù and photos we‚Äôve found from Google. We‚Äôve been doing research on this case for several years now and we‚Äôve had the pleasure of meeting some incredible people along the way who have compelling stories that add to the Chin legacy. Through these conversations, we hope to expand on whats currently known about this pivotal and historic case. Thank you to our guests Christine Choy and Theodore Merritt. Thank you to our webinar manager Jaclyn Amor. Thank you to our graphics designer Tiffany Wang. Thank you to our promotional partners UCLA Asian American Studies Center Asian America: The Ken Fong Podcast 1882 Foundation Chinese American Museum Washington, DC.

Clifford Lo Julian Chan Joshua Van Gundy Ashley Hermosura and of course our family members Tony Hsu Judy Wong YO YO JY Zhang We could not have done this without all of you.
