        "text": "This article is dedicated to my teachers, who have given me guidance during times of great adversity and change.\n\nUpon enrolling at the CLC in December, I was lucky to take literature classes as part of the Chinese language curriculum. Some students enjoyed Chinese literature, others were indifferent, and some didn’t find it very interesting. In actuality, all our readings had historical, cultural, and literary value. Our teacher selected a range of different Chinese literature, which included prose and poetry in both classical and modern Chinese. I have organized the authors and works from order of time:\n\nBook of Odes 詩經 – Zhou Dynasty 周\n\nTao Yuanming 陶淵明 – Eastern Jin 東晉\n\nThe Ballad of Mulan 木蘭詩 – Northern and Southern Dynasties 南北朝\n\nLi Po 李白 – Tang Dynasty 唐\n\nHan Yu 韓愈 – Tang Dynasty 唐\n\nSu Shi 蘇軾 – Northern Song 北宋\n\nXu Zhimo 徐志摩\n\nQi Jun 琦君\n\nLin Haiyin 林海音\n\nLin Liang 林良\n\nXi Murong 席慕容\n\nHou Wenyong 侯文詠\n\nBelow are introductions to the authors and my translations of their literature.\n\nTao Yuanming 陶淵明 (365-437), Eastern Jin 東晉\n\nTao Yuanming (also know as Tao Qian 陶潛) was a Chinese poet and is perhaps one of the most influential pre-Tang Dynasty Chinese poets. Tao Yuanming held some minor government positions, but he was firm in his principles and refused to curry favors or flatter high government officials. He is often quoted for saying he would not “bow like a servant for five bushels of grain” 不為五斗米折腰.\n\nTao Yuanming is famous for his poetry and his preface to the Peach Blossom Spring 桃花源記, which describes a utopia (tao hua yuan 桃花源 now means utopia in modern Chinese) free from poverty, corruption and political turmoil, a clear contrast to the unstable period Tao Yuanming lived in during his lifetime. The story begins:\n\nDuring the Taiyuan era of the Eastern Jin, there lived a man of Wuling who made a living as a fisherman[1]. One day while following a stream, he had forgotten how far he had gone [and lost his way]. Suddenly, he came across a grove full of blossoming peach trees, the grove lined both sides of the banks for hundreds of paces and did not include any other kind of tree. All over were fragrant grasses and herbs, [above him] a fluttering mist of dazzling and fragrant blossom petals. Thinking this sight highly unusual, he continued forward to see how far the forest went. At the forest’s end he reached the fountainhead of the stream and saw a mountain with a small cave. It appeared to have a ray of light, and thus he left his boat and entered the small hole.\n\n晉太元中，武陵人，捕魚為業，緣溪行，忘路之遠近；忽逢桃花林，夾岸數百步，中無雜樹，芳草鮮美，落英繽紛；漁人甚異之。復前行，欲窮其林。林盡水源，便得一山。山有小口，彷彿若有光，便舍船，從口入。\n\n-beginning of the preface to The Peach Blossom Spring 桃花源記[2]\n\nLi Po 李白 (701-762) – Tang Dynasty 唐\n\nLi Po is one of the most well-known poets of the Tang Dynasty, including Wang Wei 王維 (699-759), Du Fu 杜甫 (712-770), Bai Juyi 白居易 (772–846), among many others. Below is my (rough…really rough) translation of his poem.\n\nPlease Have Some Wine\n\nDo you not see the Yellow River’s waters falling from the sky, flowing swiftly toward the ocean, never to return?\n\nDo you not see parents facing the clear mirror, vexed at their white hair, [once] black in the morning, turn to snow upon the evening?\n\nIn our satisfaction and joy, we should live for this moment, to never face the moon with an empty wine goblet.\n\nHeaven grants us all with a purpose, our riches once exhausted, will always be earned again.\n\nPrepare lamb and beef, let us live in ecstasy and toast three hundred cups!\n\nCen Fuzi, Dan Qiusheng,[3] please have some wine sirs, don’t stop drinking.\n\nAllow me to sing a tune, please listen carefully:\n\nThe life of expensive bells, drums, and gem-like delicacies is barren, but I only wish to stay forever intoxicated and never awake.\n\nSince ancient times, sages and men of virtue have felt lonely and reclusive, but only those who drink leave their name in this world.\n\nThe King of Chen[4] once held a great banquet in Pingle[5], fine wines worth tens of thousands, drunk willfully amidst happiness and laughter.\n\nHost, why must you speak of money matters? Quickly, purchase more wine and let us drink to our fill!\n\nMagnificent, fine patterned horses; exquisite, qian jin fur robes—\n\nTell the boy to exchange them for fine wine, and let us drown these ancient, distant sorrows!\n\n將進酒\n\n君不見黃河之水天上來，奔流到海不復回？\n\n君不見高堂明鏡悲白髮，朝如青絲暮成雪？\n\n人生得意須盡歡，莫使金樽空對月。\n\n天生我材必有用，千金散盡還復來。\n\n烹羊宰牛且為樂，會須一飲三百杯。\n\n岑夫子，丹丘生，將進酒，君莫停。\n\n與君歌一曲，請君為我側耳聽。\n\n鐘鼓饌玉不足貴，但願長醉不願醒。\n\n古來聖賢皆寂寞，唯有飲者留其名。\n\n陳王昔時宴平樂，斗酒十千恣讙謔。\n\n主人何為言少錢，徑須沽取對君酌。\n\n五花馬，千金裘，\n\n呼兒將出換美酒，與爾同銷萬古愁！\n\nHan Yu 韓愈 (768 – 825) – Tang Dynasty 唐\n\nHan Yu lost both his parents at an early age and was raised by his elder brother and sister-in-law. When he was young, Han Yu studied ancient texts and developed concern for politics. At thirty-four years old, he held a government position, but this didn’t last long. When he met with the Dezong Emperor and requested lighter taxes, the emperor became furious and banished him to Mt. Yang 陽山 (in Modern Guangdong Province).\n\nHan Yu was a strict Confucian and did his utmost to reject Buddhism and Daoism. He wrote the famous Memorial on the Bone Relics of the Buddha諫迎佛骨表, a subtle protest against the government’s wasting of resources, which angered the Xuanzong Emperor and got Han Yu banished to Chaozhou 潮州.\n\nDuring his life time, Han Yu led a movement to revitalize the ways of the ancients, emphasizing the need to “Write to convey truth” 文以載道, specifically to revive the simplistic and clear writing style common during the pre-Qin period.\n\nScholars of the ancient past always had teachers. Teachers should transmit teachings, provide [a course of] study, and answer questions. People are not born with reasoning and knowledge. Who can avoid being perplexed? Those who are confused but do not follow [the way] of their teachers: their perplexities will last a lifetime.\n\nThose who were born before me, their learning and reasoning is truly earlier than mine, and I still follow and learn from them; for those born after me who possess knowledge greater than mine, I also follow and learn from them. I am learning the Tao.[6] Does it actually matter whether or not my teacher was born before me? Thus, [the best] teacher is neither noble nor lowly, [their] age high or low unimportant: where the Tao exists, the teacher also exists.\n\n古之學者必有師。師者，所以傳道、受業、解惑也。人非生而知之者，孰能無惑？惑而不從師，其為惑也，終不解矣。\n\n生乎吾前，其聞道也，固先乎吾，吾從而師之。生乎吾後，其聞道也，亦先乎吾，吾從而師之。吾師道也，夫庸知其年之先後生於吾乎？是故無貴，無賤，無長，無少，道之所存，師之所存也。\n\n-Excerpt from On the Way of Teachers 師說, by Han Yu\n\nSu Shi 蘇軾 (1037-1101) – Northern Song Dynasty 北宋\n\nSu Shi was a statesman, writer, poet, artist, and calligrapher of the Northern Song period. His style name is “Scholar Su of the Eastern Slope” 蘇東坡. He is considered a genius for his many talents. Su Shi was banished from court many times, mostly because he openly expressed his opinions to the Emperor and opposed the reforms led by Wang Anshi 王安石 (1021-1086).\n\nSome of Su Shi’s famous literature include shui diao ge tou水 調歌頭 (or Remembering Su Che on the Mid-Autumn Festival), On the Xilin Wall 題西林壁, Remembering the Red Cliff , to the tune of Nian Nu Jiao 念奴嬌.赤壁懷古 (my translation below), among many others.\n\nRemembering the Red Cliff, to the tune of Nian Nu Jiao\n\nThe vast Yangzi flows to the east, river waters swelling endlessly, [and I recall the] outstanding heroes of thousand years past.\n\nIn the West there is an ancient fortress. People say it is the location of the Red Cliff, where Zhou Lang [fought against Cao Cao during] the Three Kingdoms era.\n\nThe Jagged stone slabs towering like fallen clouds, fierce waves ripping the shores and rolling up snow-like water blossoms in thousands.\n\nThe rivers and mountains are like a painting: [during the Three Kingdoms,] how many marvelous heroes appeared?\n\nI recall Zhou Yu when he had just married the beautiful Xiao Qiao, Zhou Yu’s bearing magnificent, his countenance refined.\n\nDressed in fine robes and waving a scholar’s fan, in between smiles and laughter, he burned his behemoth enemies into ashen dust.\n\nAs I ponder what happened here in the Kingdom of Wu, people will probably laugh at my sentiments and my middle-aged white hair.\n\nLife is like a dream: better to pour a cup of wine in tribute of the river and moon!\n\n念奴嬌-赤壁懷古\n\n大江東去，浪淘盡，千古風流人物。\n\n故壘西邊，人道是，三國周郎赤壁。\n\n亂石崩雲，驚濤裂岸，捲起千堆雪。\n\n江山如畫，一時多少豪傑。\n\n遙想公瑾當年，小喬出嫁了，雄姿英發。\n\n羽扇綸巾，談笑間，強虜飛灰湮滅。\n\n故國神遊，多情應笑我，早生華髮。\n\n人間如夢，一尊還酹江月！\n\nXu Zhimo 徐志摩 (1897-1931)\n\nXu Zhimo was a poet of early Republican China. He came from a wealthy family and later studied abroad in England. While study in Cambridge, Xu Zhimo fell in love with English romantic poetry. According to Hu Shi, Xu pursued “freedom and beauty” his whole life, which gave him great inspiration. He is known for his major contributions to China’s “new poetry” 新詩.\n\nXu Zhimo was a leader in China’s literary movement. He helped found the Crescent Moon Society 新月派 in 1923. He was also quite the romantic and had relations with three women: his formal wife Zhang Youyi 張幼儀, Lin Huiyin 林徽陰, and Lu Xiaoman 陸小曼 (this has been turned into a Chinese TV drama).\n\nBy Chance\n\nI am that patch of cloud in the sky,\n\nThat occasionally projects into your heart—\n\nYou musn’t be surprised,\n\nNor should you be delighted—\n\nIn this turning moment, my trace is extinguished.\n\nYou and I met on this dark night of the ocean,\n\nYou have your direction, and I have mine;\n\nYou can remember this moment,\n\nThough it’s best you forget,\n\nThe shining brightness of this shared encounter!\n\n偶然\n\n我是天空裡的一片雲，\n\n偶爾投影在你的波心──\n\n你不必訝異，\n\n更無須歡喜──\n\n在轉瞬間消滅了蹤影。\n\n你我相逢在黑夜的海上，\n\n你有你的，我有我的，方向；\n\n你記得也好，\n\n最好你忘掉，\n\n在這交會時互放的光亮！\n\nQi Jun 琦君 (1917-2006)\n\nQi Jun was born in Zhejiang province. Her specialty was Chinese prose, but she also wrote novels, literary criticism, translations, and children’s literature. Her literature has been translated into English, Japanese, Korean, and other languages.\n\nIn the early morning when I lift up the curtains and take a look, rain droplets are already scattered all over the window. Ah! Great, another rainy day. The rain lasts ten days, half a month, and even a whole month, the hanging flag-of-myriad-countries like clothes all wet, the walls and floors all emit an air of moisture, and I don’t feel a bit grudged. Rainy days always take me to another place; there, I can enjoy the happiness of my youth once again.\n\n-A Rainy Day, How Pleasant 下雨天，真好\n\nHou Wenyong 侯文詠 (1961-)\n\nHe is a contemporary Taiwanese writer from Chiayi county. Mr. Hou pursued medicine throughout his entire education, but always had an interest in writing. Later, he combined his interest in writing with the reality of his career and the careers of friends and colleagues in the medical field, becoming the author he is today.\n\nHis writings include prose, novels, and children’s literature. We read Making a Bet 打賭, a short story that gives the reader a glimpse into the atmosphere of the hospital environment and the relationship between doctors, patients, and visiting relatives.\n\nWhen I was a resident physician, there was a paralyzed patient in critical condition who was living in the intensive-care unit. Our head physician casually looked at his medical records and boldly affirmed the patient will not live past three days. At the time, I was young and arrogant, what I heard was unconvincing, and then I challenged him: “And what if he lives past three days?\n\n-selected passage from Making a Bet 打賭\n\nReflections\n\nTranslation challenges my abilities in English and Chinese. The Chinese language, like any language, changed over time, and thus translating classical Chinese means depicting and conveying more with terse, simple, and efficient language. The largest pitfall in translating is finding a balance between what is literally written and my interpretation. The translation inevitably loses some connotation from the original, and I find I can only translate the meaning, but struggle with conveying the complete spirit and essence of the work, because every author I translate has their own writing style, or write in literary forms unique in Chinese written tradition, and the authors lived in completely different time period: the question is whether the translator can transmit, from the author’s words, the echoing feelings and atmosphere the writer felt when he wrote the piece.\n\nPerhaps there are times when I become too invested in what I read, lost in the past, lost in a place between the author’s memories and their creative prowess. At times I want to transform myself into the setting, character, and spirit of what I read, to take myself somewhere only possible in imagination and personal consciousness. This becomes dangerous, and then I am reminded to come back, to return to reality, to the present."
