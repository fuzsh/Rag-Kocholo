Saying Good-bye to Cambridge Again

å¾å¿æ© by Xu Zhimo

è½»è½»çæèµ°äºï¼ Very quietly I take my leave

æ­£å¦æè½»è½»çæ¥ï¼ As quietly as I came here;

æè½»è½»çææï¼ Quietly I wave good-bye

ä½å«è¥¿å¤©çäºå½©ã To the rosy clouds in the western sky.

é£æ²³ççéæ³ The golden willows by the riverside

æ¯å¤é³ä¸­çæ°å¨ Are young brides in the setting sun

æ³¢å éçè³å½±ï¼ Their reflections on the shimmering waves

å¨æçå¿å¤´è¡æ¼¾ã Always linger in the depth of my heart.

è½¯æ³¥ä¸çéèï¼ The floatingheart growing in the sludge

æ²¹æ²¹çå¨æ°´åºææï¼ Sways leisurely under the water;

å¨åº·æ²³çææ³¢éï¼ In the gentle waves of Cambridge

æçå¿åä¸æ¡æ°´è I would be a water plant!

é£æ¦è«ä¸çä¸æ½­ï¼ That pool under the shade of elm trees

ä¸æ¯æ¸ æ³ï¼æ¯å¤©ä¸è¹ Holds not water but the rainbow from the sky;

æç¢å¨æµ®è»é´ï¼ Shattered to pieces among the duckweeds

æ²æ·çå½©è¹ä¼¼çæ¢¦ã Is the sediment of a rainbow-like dream?

å¯»æ¢¦ï¼ æä¸æ¯é¿ç¯ï¼ To seek a dream? Just to pole a boat upstream

åéèæ´éå¤æ¼«æº¯ï¼ To wher the green grass is more verdant;

æ»¡è½½ä¸è¹æè¾ï¼ Or to have the boat fully loaded with starlight

å¨æè¾ææéæ¾æ­ And sing aloud in the splendour of starlight.

ä½æä¸è½æ¾æ­ï¼ But I cannot sing aloud

æææ¯å«ç¦»çç¬ç®«ï¼ Quietness is my farewell music;

å¤è«ä¹ä¸ºææ²é»ï¼ Even summer insects heep silence for me

æ²é»æ¯ä»æçåº·æ¡¥ï¼ Silent is Cambridge tonight!

ææçæèµ°äºï¼ Very quietly I take my leave

æ­£å¦æææçæ¥ï¼ As quietly as I came here;

ææ¥ä¸æ¥è¡£è¢ï¼ Gently I flick my sleeves

ä¸å¸¦èµ°ä¸çäºå½©ã Not even a wisp of cloud will I bring away.
