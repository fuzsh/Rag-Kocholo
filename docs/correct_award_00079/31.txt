South African writer Nadine Gordimer won the Nobel Prize for Literature on 7 December 1991.

Gordimer was the first woman in 25 years to be awarded the honour and the seventh woman laureate at the time in the near-century history of the Nobel Prize.

She is the author of ten novels and more than 200 short stories, her work over the past forty years has increasingly focused on the legacies and moral consequences of apartheid.

Heralded as well as banned in her native country, Gordimer has consistently refused to leave South Africa.

By addressing its political and racial turmoil in her fiction, she has chosen a spiritual exile over an actual one.
