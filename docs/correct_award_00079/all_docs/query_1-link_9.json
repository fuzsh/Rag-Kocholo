        "text": "Nadine Gordimer (born November 20, 1923, Springs, Transvaal [now in Gauteng], South Africa—died July 13, 2014, Johannesburg) was a South African novelist and short-story writer whose major theme was exile and alienation. She received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1991.\n\nGordimer was born into a privileged white middle-class family and began reading at an early age. By the age of 9 she was writing, and she published her first story in a magazine when she was 15. Her wide reading informed her about the world on the other side of apartheid—the official South African policy of racial segregation—and that discovery in time developed into strong political opposition to apartheid. Never an outstanding scholar, she attended the University of the Witwatersrand for one year. In addition to writing, she lectured and taught at various schools in the United States during the 1960s and ’70s.\n\nGordimer’s first book was Face to Face (1949), a collection of short stories. In 1953 a novel, The Lying Days, was published. Both exhibit the clear, controlled, and unsentimental style that became her hallmark. Her stories concern the devastating effects of apartheid on the lives of South Africans—the constant tension between personal isolation and the commitment to social justice, the numbness caused by the unwillingness to accept apartheid, the inability to change it, and the refusal of exile.\n\nIn 1974 Gordimer’s novel The Conservationist (1974) was a joint winner of the Booker Prize. Later novels included Burger’s Daughter (1979), July’s People (1981), A Sport of Nature (1987), My Son’s Story (1990), The House Gun (1998), and The Pickup (2001). Gordimer addressed environmental issues in Get a Life (2005), the story of a South African ecologist who, after receiving thyroid treatment, becomes radioactive and hence dangerous to others. Her final novel, No Time like the Present (2012), follows veterans of the battle against apartheid as they deal with the issues facing modern South Africa."
