        "text": "Gordimer’s first book was a collection of short stories. The title was The Soft Voice of the Serpent. It was published in 1952. Her first novel, The Lying Days, was published in 1953.\n\nHer most important works include the novels A Guest of Honour (1970), Burger’s Daughter (1979), July’s People (1981), A Sport of Nature (1987), My Son’s Story (1990), Get a Life (2005), and No Time Like the Present (2012). She also published more than 10 collections of short stories, as well as a number of nonfiction works. Her collections of short stories include A Soldier’s Embrace (1980), Crimes of Conscience (1991), and Loot and Other Stories (2003).\n\nGordimer’s books often have a political theme. She was regarded as a writer against apartheid. Apartheid was a system for keeping whites and people of color separated in South Africa. Many of her stories are about the negative effects of apartheid.\n\nGordimer received many international honors for her work. She won the Booker Prize, an important British award, for her novel The Conservationist (1974). In 2007 she was awarded the French Legion of Honor, which is France’s highest award. Gordimer also received at least 15 honorary doctorates from universities all over the world. She died on July 13, 2014, in Johannesburg, South Africa."
