She was 90.\n\nA prickly, astute writer who quoted Franz Kafka in calling literature “an ax to break up the frozen sea within us,” Gordimer condemned the racist system that for decades was imposed by a white minority on a black majority, saying it cauterized the human heart.\n\nShe supported the African National Congress’ liberation struggle, and when Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990, Gordimer was among the first people he met. She later turned against the party, accusing it of corruption.\n\nHer life’s theme was the exploration of how injustice, corruption and abuses of freedom echo in small, ordinary lives. Her 16 novels, including “A World of Strangers,” “The Conservationist” and “July’s People,” illuminated the effect of apartheid on people’s lives and decisions. Three of her books were banned under apartheid.\n\nIn 1991, Los Angeles Times correspondent Scott Kraft wrote of how “this unassuming, strong-willed white woman has used her manual Hermes typewriter to give the world some of the most perceptive and uncompromising works of fiction ever written about her homeland, South Africa.”\n\nBut after apartheid, some black critics derided her as a white liberal, belittling her role in helping the world understand what the barbaric apartheid system did to the human heart. In 1998, four years after the first free elections, “July’s People” was banned from study at schools by the ANC government of the country’s most populous state, Gauteng, which deemed the book “deeply racist, superior and patronizing.”\n\nIn her later years, she bitterly castigated the ANC government over a controversial secrecy bill, and wrote about its corruption and betrayal of its people.\n\nShe married Reinhold Cassirer, an art dealer who had been a refugee from Nazi Germany, in 1954. Cassirer died in 2001. She had two children, one from a previous marriage.\n\nBorn Nov. 20, 1923, Gordimer was the child of Jewish immigrants. Her father had arrived as a threadbare teenager from Lithuania (he was relieved, Gordimer once said, that as a white in South Africa at least some people were lower than him on the social order), and her mother was a middle-class woman from Britain (who felt charitable concern for the plight of blacks “all in a Lady Bountiful context,” Gordimer later said).\n\nGordimer was raised in a mining town, Springs, and educated at a Catholic convent school and at the University of Witwatersrand. She began writing as a child and sent her first short story to a magazine at 15, not revealing her age.\n\nTo her amazement, the magazine published it.\n\n“Now that was an immense thrill, never mind the Nobel Prize,” she later said. “That was when I knew I would be a writer.”\n\nBut it was not until apartheid became law in 1948 that her writings achieved their full force. Her first novel, “The Lying Days,” was published in 1953. About 20 years later, in 1974, she won the Booker Prize for “The Conservationist,” considered by some to be her finest work.\n\nWhen she won the Nobel Prize in 1991, the battle against apartheid was almost won. Mandela had been released from prison and negotiations on the deal that would secure democratic elections and majority rule were underway.\n\n“Gordimer writes with intense immediacy about the extremely complicated personal and social relationships in her environment,” the Swedish academy that bestows the award wrote. “At the same time as she feels a political involvement, and takes action on that basis, she does not permit this to encroach on her writings. Nevertheless, her literary works, in giving profound insights into the historical process, help to shape this process.”\n\nThough she conceded that it was “nice” to have recognition, she said at the time: “I never thought about the prize when I wrote. Writing is not a horse race.”\n\nShe once said she was “not nearly as brave as being a South African has turned out to require” and in another instance described the pain of sitting alone to write while friends from the liberation struggle movement were arrested or had to flee apartheid’s assassins.\n\n“You have to become involved with life, not only in personal relationships but for social causes. But at the same time, you have to stand apart to pursue your writing, to struggle with words to define the whole question of being and existence,” she told an interviewer after winning the Nobel. “They were being tortured and there I was, shutting myself away to write.”\n\nAn irony was that her books, extolled overseas particularly after the Nobel Prize win, were not widely read in South Africa, where educationists bemoan the lack of a reading culture. The impoverished, poorly educated black majority didn’t know her work, and some black intellectuals scorned it.\n\nBut she hoped her work would remain as a powerful legacy for future generations to discover.\n\nShe told one interviewer that supporters of the ANC were naive to believe that everything would change for the better once the liberation movement came to power.\n\n“We were naive, because we focused on removing the apartheid government and never thought deeply enough about what would follow,” she said.\n\nOriginally Published: July 13, 2014 at 11:01 p.m."
