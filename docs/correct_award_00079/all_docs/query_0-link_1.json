        "text": "Nadine Gordimer\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1991\n\nResidence at the time of the award: South Africa\n\nPrize motivation: “who through her magnificent epic writing has - in the words of Alfred Nobel - been of very great benefit to humanity”\n\nLanguage: English\n\nPrize share: 1/1\n\nLife\n\nNadine Gordimer was born in Springs, South Africa. Her parents were Jewish immigrants; her father was from Latvia and her mother was from England. Gordimer began writing at the age of nine, and was just 15 years old when her first work was published. The novel entitled The Conservationist (1974) gave her her international breakthrough. Gordimer was involved in the anti-apartheid movement early on and several of her books were banned by the apartheid regime. Gordimer has lived and worked in Johannesburg, South Africa, since 1948.\n\nWork\n\nNadine Gordimer's works include novels, short stories, and essays. During the 1960s and 1970s Gordimer wrote a number of novels set against the backdrop of the emerging resistance movement against apartheid, while the liberated South Africa provides the backdrop for her later works, written in the 1990s. The stories of individuals are always at the center of her narratives, in relation to external limitations and frameworks. As a whole, Gordimer's literary works create rich imagery of South Africa's historical development."
