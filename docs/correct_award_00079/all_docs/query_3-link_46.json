        "text": "In memory of Nadine Gordimer (1923-2014)\n\nNobel prize-winning South African writer Nadine Gordimer passed on 13 July 2014 at the age of 90. She was an outspoken voice against the evils of apartheid, and continued to express strong views even after its collapse and the emergence of a multiracial democracy. Gordimer was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1991, making her South Africa’s first winner of the prize. The New York Times published an article commemorating her life and work.\n\nHer writing career lasted over six decades and The Guardian highlighted her five must-read books including The Conservationist (1974), Burger’s Daughter (1979), July’s People (1981), Life Times: Stories 1952-2007 (2010), and No Time Like the Present (2012).\n\nThe Library has all of these books and many more by Gordimer. Come in soon and check them out.\n\nSundays and Mondays: CLOSED\n\nTuesdays and Wednesdays: 13h00 to 19h00\n\nThursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays: 10h00 to 16h00\n\nWe’ll be CLOSED all day on the following: Bastille Day Sunday 14 July; Olympic Games Opening Ceremony Friday 26 July; Assumption Thursday 15 August.\n\nLending Policy During the Games: No books will be due between 14 July and 15 August, and no overdue fines will accrue during the Games.\n\nIf you have questions about how to get to the Library in July and August, please see our webpage Accessing the Library during the Games.\n\nA charitable gift from your estate is simple to implement and is easy to change if you should need to access the assets during your lifetime.
