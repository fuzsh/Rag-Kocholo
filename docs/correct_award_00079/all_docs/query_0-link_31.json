        "text": "The Conservationist (1974)\n\nGordimer was joint winner of the Booker prize for this novel, which exposes the delusions of apartheid through the character of Mehring, a rich white businessman turned dilettante farmer, who is confronted with an unidentified corpse on his land. Mehring's certainty that he always does \"the right thing\" is undermined by a narrative that constantly undercuts his smug conservatism. Considering the novel as a contender for the Best of Booker prize, Sam Jordison wrote: \"The intensity of this writing requires serious concentration, especially when coupled with an impressionistic narrative that skips backwards and forwards over time and situates us right inside Mehring's head – an increasingly unpleasant place to be. It's hard work – but is correspondingly effective.\"\n\nBurger's Daughter (1979)\n\nRanked by one critic as one of the \"few truly great political novels ever written\", this book was described by Gordimer as a \"coded homage\" to the Afrikaner lawyer Bram Fischer, who defended Nelson Mandela and other anti-apartheid activists. It is narrated by the daughter of the central character, who faces the consequences of her parents' martyrdom for their political ideals. It was one of several Gordimer novels to be banned by the South African government, prompting her to issue a pamphlet protesting the censorship, What Happened to Burger's Daughter.\n\nJuly's People (1981)\n\nThis wasn't the first time Gordimer imagined a post-apartheid world: look at her 1970 novel A Guest of Honour. But whereas the earlier book was set in a nameless African state, here the location is explicitly South Africa, where revolution has driven a white, liberal family out of Johannesburg into the protection of their servant, July, in a small village riven with its own conflicts which is none too happy to shelter them. Banned under apartheid, it was still regarded as controversial as recently as 2001, when it was removed from the school reading list by a provincial education department which described it as \"deeply racist, superior and patronising\".\n\nLife Times: Stories 1952-2007 (2010)\n\nGordimer's Nobel prize, awarded in 1991, was given for her short stories as well as her novels. She published more than 200 of them from the late 1940s onwards, in periodicals, anthologies and collections, many of which are now out of print. This book, published in tandem with a collection of her non-fiction, contains key stories from some of her major collections, including Loot, Jump, and Beethoven Was One-Sixteenth Black."
