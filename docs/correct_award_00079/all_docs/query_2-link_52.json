        "text": "He was born on November 20, 1923 in Springs, Gauteng Province, a mining town near Johannesburg. His parents were Jewish, Zionist, middle-class immigrants. His father was a watchmaker from Lithuania, coming from a place near the Latvian border, and his mother came from London. He began writing stories at the early age of nine and at the age of fifteen he published the first of them in the magazine Forum. At the age of twenty-five he moved to Johannesburg, where he took up permanent residence. He never stood out as a student and although he entered the prestigious University of the Witwatersrand, he did not finish his studies. ​\n\nHe initially opted for short stories, publishing his first book in 1949 titled Face to Face; That same year she married for the first time. In 1953 she wrote The Soft Voice of the Serpent, continuing in the short story style. Already in these writings he began to address the social issue of South Africa, with the alienation of human behavior and racial segregation as a backdrop.\n\nHis first novel would not come until 1953, The Lying Days, in which her characteristic narrative technique would be captured, marked by a sober line, without sentimentality, although with great concern for the human degeneration that surrounded her. In 1954 she remarried Reinhold Cassirer, with whom she had a son. In later years she continued writing both novels and short stories: Six Feet of the Country (1956) A World of Strangers (1958) Friday's Footprint (1960) Occasion for Loving (1963) Not for Publication (1965) The Late Burgeois World (1966) A Guest of Honor (1970) Livingstone's Companions (1971) The Conservationist (1974) Selected stories (1975) and Burger's Daughter (1979). During these years he combined his literary activity with lectures at universities in Europe and America.\n\nIn the eighties he would publish some of his most important works: A Soldier's Embrace (1980) July's People (1981) Something Out There (1984) A Sport of Nature (1987) My Son's Story (1990)\n\nIn 1991, the year in which he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, he published Jump and Other Stories, continuing with its characteristic formal perfection, without using superfluous elements.\n\nIn 1994 he published No one to Accompany Me, although I had started writing it years before and The House Gun in 1998. Already in this century, The pickup (2001) Get a Life (2005) and his latest work, No Time Like the Present (2012), which shows current events in South Africa through the lives of a couple of former militants anti-apartheid.\n\nHe received a large number of awards and distinctions, such as fifteen honorary doctorates (from the universities of Yale, Harvard, Columbia, Cambridge, Leuven in Belgium, Cape Town and Witwatersrand among other).\n\nIn 2005, she was invited to the International Book Fair in Guadalajara, Mexico, sitting between Gabriel García Márquez and Carlos Fuentes.\n\na strong voice\n\nThe Nelson Mandela Foundation paid tribute to Gordimer, for its “deep sadness at the loss of the great lady of South African literature.” “We have lost a great writer, a patriot and a strong voice for equality and democracy in the world,” she added.\n\nIn his later years, Gordimer became active in the fight against HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and AIDS, raising funds for the Treatment Action Campaign, a group that seeks to help sick South Africans obtain free life-saving medicines.\n\nThemes of his work\n\nGordimer achieved lasting international recognition for his works, most of which address political issues, as well as the \"moral and psychological tensions of his racially divided native country.\" Virtually all of Gordimer's works deal with themes of love and politics, particularly about race in South Africa. Always questioning power relations and truth, Gordimer tells stories of ordinary people, revealing moral ambiguities and choices. His characterization is nuanced and is revealed more through the decisions his characters make than through their identities and beliefs.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 2006, Gordimer was attacked in her home by thieves, sparking outrage in the country. Apparently, Ella Gordimer refused to move into a gated complex, against the advice of some of her friends.\n\nIn a 1979-80 interview, Gordimer identified herself as an atheist, but added: “I think I have a basically religious temperament, perhaps even deeply religious.”\n\nGordimer had a daughter, Oriane (born 1950), from her first marriage in 1949 to Gerald Gavron, a local dentist, whom she divorced after three years. In 1954 she married Reinhold Cassirer, a highly respected art dealer who founded the South African subsidiary Sotheby's and later ran her own gallery; Her “wonderful marriage” lasted until his death from emphysema in 2001. Her son, Hugo, was born in 1955 and is a filmmaker in New York, with whom Gordimer collaborated on at least two documentaries.\n\nHe died on July 13, 2014, at the age of 90, at his residence in Johannesburg.\n\nunauthorized biography\n\nRonald Suresh Roberts published a biography of Gordimer, No Cold Kitchen, in 2006. Gordimer had granted Roberts interviews and access to his personal papers, with the understanding that he would authorize the biography in exchange for the right to review the manuscript before publication. However, Gordimer and Roberts did not reach an agreement over her account of the illness and death of Gordimer's husband, Reinhold Cassirer, and an affair Gordimer had in the 1950s, as well as criticism of his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Roberts published it independently, not as an “authority,” and Gordimer disowned the book, accusing Roberts of breach of trust.\n\nIn addition to these disagreements, Roberts criticizes Gordimer's post-apartheid advocacy for black South Africans, particularly his opposition to the government's management of the AIDS crisis, as paternalistic and hypocritical white liberalism. The biography also claimed that Gordimer's 1954 New Yorker essay, “A South African Childhood,” was not entirely biographical and contained some fabricated facts."
