The announcement that South African author Nadine Gordimer would receive the Nobel prize for literature was made on 3 October 1991.

Gordimer was the first woman in 25 years to be awarded the honour and the seventh woman laureate in the near-century history of the Nobel Prize at the time.

As a writer and a political activist, her work was mainly focused on the legacies and moral consequences of apartheid, with a career spanning over 40 years.
