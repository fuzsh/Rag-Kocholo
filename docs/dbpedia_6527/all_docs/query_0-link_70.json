Over the centuries, scholars have explored the myriad political, religious, military, and social aspects of these devastating civil wars. In recent years, however, researchers have also started to examine the memory of the Wars of Religion. They have asked how Catholics and Protestants looked back on the events they had experienced during the wars, how they recorded their memories, and what impact these memories had on post-war society. Most of the scholarship in this nascent field has focused on printed histories and elite memories, but we still know very little about the distinctions between local, national, and transnational memory practices; how memories varied throughout the social hierarchy, among individuals and groups, or within and between confessions; and what long-term impact traumatic memories had on early modern society. This conference aims to evaluate how the study of memory can reshape our understanding of the Wars of Religion."
