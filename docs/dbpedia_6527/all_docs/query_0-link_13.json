        "text": "Elizabethan Settlement Definition and Summary\n\nThe Elizabethan Settlement was religious legislation passed from 1559 to 1571 that intended to provide a compromise between English Catholics and Protestants. It included the Act of Supremacy, Act of Uniformity, a new Book of Common Prayer, and the Thirty-Nine Articles.\n\nBook of Common Prayer\n\nThe Book of Common Prayer gave English-speaking people prayers in their language. Its purpose was to give the common people access to liturgies and prayers.\n\nThe Elizabethan Settlement intended to provide a compromise between Catholics and Protestants by incorporating elements of each faith into the Church of England. Although it did not heal the divide brought on by the Reformation, it did stabilize the Church of England, and many of the religious decisions made during the Elizabethan Settlement period remain part of the Anglican church today.\n\nElizabethan Settlement Causes\n\nHenry VIII officially broke with the Catholic Church in Rome in 1534 by passing the First Act of Supremacy, making himself head of a new Church of England. This act ignited the English Reformation and established a unique form of Protestantism known as Anglicanism as the official religion. There was much debate among traditionalists and zealous reformers about how this new church should look. It did not help that the church's Supreme Head was easily influenced, highly paranoid, and dangerously erratic.\n\nWhy did Henry VIII break with the Catholic Church?\n\nHenry VIII secured his position on the throne through violence in 1485 when he defeated Richard III. His lineage was unstable, and his production of a male heir was necessary. After Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragon, failed to give Henry an heir to his throne, Henry's eyes wandered!\n\nDid you know?\n\nCatherine of Aragon was Henry VIII's brother's wife. He believed that as punishment by God for this communion, God was refusing him a male heir, and this influenced his decisions to divorce and remarry.\n\nHenry wished to dissolve his marriage to Catherine and to be remarried to Anne Boleyn, but Pope Clement VII refused. Henry was later excommunicated from the Catholic Church after his secret marriage to Anne. The Act of Supremacy in 1534 removed any religious authority in England from the Pope and gave it to himself, and his heirs. Meaning he could finally divorce Catherine!\n\nAnne gave birth to Henry's daughter; Elizabeth I and Henry was undoubtedly disappointed again.\n\nChurch of England and Lutheranism\n\nDuring Henry's reign, the Church of England went semi-Lutheran in 1537, asserting that justification by faith alone was central to doctrine and that the church should eliminate saint worship. Henry dissolved the English monasteries and seized their assets, causing widespread unrest. In 1539, Henry tried to walk back some of his more Lutheran-leaning reforms and make the Church of England more Catholic by reaffirming transubstantiation and celibacy for clerics.\n\nTransubstantiation\n\nThe belief that the wafer and wine literally transform into Christ's body and blood during Communion service.\n\nEdward Seymour's Reforms\n\nWhen Henry died in 1547, the Protestants gained the upper hand. Henry named Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, as regent for the young King Edward VI. Somerset was a Calvinist, and the young king grew up with a host of Protestant tutors. Edward VI believed that strict Protestantism was best for the Church of England, and his reforms undid all of the protections for traditional religion enacted in 1539. The reforms included allowing clerics to marry and denying transubstantiation. The upheaval by yet another major religious reform resulted in rebellion in many English provinces.\n\nEdward died at age seventeen in 1533, and England's official religion suffered dramatic changes again. When Edward VI died, his sister Mary I became queen. Mary was just as passionate a Catholic as Edward had been Protestant. Her brief reign sought to return England's church to Catholicism and reconcile with the Pope. While some were happy to return to the traditional religion, many were not, and the land was ripped apart by rebellion. Mary died in 1558, and England again faced upheaval in the name of religion.\n\nDid you know?\n\nEdward VI's death is believed to be caused by a subsequent case of tuberculosis after he suffered from measles.\n\nA United Church of England\n\nWhen Elizabeth I became queen in 1558, England's religious situation was dire. So much flipping back and forth between Protestantism and Catholicism left the country deeply divided. Elizabeth was a Protestant, but not a zealous one as her brother Edward VI had been. Instead, she approached religion with a more pragmatic air. One of her first acts as queen sought to heal the religious division brought on by the past half-century by treading a middle ground between the two sides: a new united Church of England.\n\nReligious Settlement 1559\n\nElizabeth I knew that one of her first acts as queen needed to resolve the ongoing confusion about what the Church of England was. Immediately, she established that England was not tied to Rome in any way. Elizabeth accepted the title of Supreme Governor of the Church of England upon her ascension in 1558. She envisioned a church rooted in traditional religious practices but upheld essential Protestant elements such as clerical marriage, Bibles in the vernacular language, and offering both kinds of communion (bread and wine) to all.\n\nSettlement Legislation\n\nAct of Supremacy (1559): This Act established Elizabeth I as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. She pledged not to interfere in issues of Church doctrine but only focus on administration. Her reason was:\n\nI would not open windows into men's souls\"- Elizabeth I 1\n\nAct of Uniformity (1559): This Act established the structure of the Church of England. Its doctrine was predominantly Protestant but retained a Catholic hierarchy with archbishops and bishops. Clergymen were allowed to marry as with Protestantism, but the services kept their elaborate Catholic-like ceremonial structure, except they were now in English. In addition, every church was required to have Bibles in English, and everyone was required to attend church on Sunday.\n\nBook of Common Prayer (1559): A moderate new prayer book was introduced, required for use in all English churches. Thomas Cranmer wrote this book during the reign of Edward VI, and Elizabeth's religious advisors made only minor changes to appeal to the more traditionalist religionists.\n\nThe Thirty-Nine Articles (1563-1571)\n\nThese articles served as the foundation for the Church of England's doctrine. They established the practice of faith and religious procedures in England. They went through several revisions and were finalized in 1571 and added to the Book of Common Prayer.\n\nThe articles are based on the Forty-Two articles written by Thomas Cranmer in 1553 but could not be implemented because of Edward VI's death during the same year. When Elizabeth I ascended to the throne, she took up the articles and gave them to a Convocation of religious leaders for revision for the new Church of England. They reduced the number to thirty-nine, leaving out a few that they thought would most offend the Catholics.\n\nThe finalized articles include:\n\nThe Holy Scriptures contain \"all things necessary for salvation.\"\n\nSalvation comes from God's grace alone and not through good works\n\nNo one is without sin except Christ.\n\nJustification by faith alone, meaning that salvation is a gift from God received through faith.\n\nPurgatory does not exist.\n\nThere are only two sacraments: Baptism and Communion, or the Lord's Supper. The articles removed Catholic sacraments: Confirmation, Penance, Holy Orders, Marriage, and Last Rites or Extreme Unction.\n\nAll Christians may receive the bread and wine of the Lord's Supper.\n\nThe Church will not prohibit oath-taking by Christians for civic purposes.\n\nElizabethan Settlement Significance and Legacy\n\nThe Elizabethan Settlement provided the foundation for the Church of England, much of which is still in place today. However, many Englishmen disagreed with its \"middle ground\" approach to religion to pacify Protestants and Catholics alike. Protestants thought the settlement did not provide enough reform. They tried to push more Protestant-leaning reforms in 1566 but failed. Those who chose not to adhere to the Church of England's rules were persecuted. Almost 200 Catholic priests and those who helped them were hunted and burned.\n\nHistorians debate how fast and complete the settlement changed religion in England. The traditionalist argument was very pro-Protestant. A.G. Dickens wrote of widespread popular support for Protestantism that made the Elizabethan settlement inevitable and immediately supported. However, Ronald Hutton argues that certain Catholic elements such as altars were present in some regional churches as late as 1567, demonstrating a reluctance to convert to the new Church.\n\nWhat do YOU think?\n\nWhich of the two mentioned historians do you agree with? Try and produce an argument for your decision by gathering evidence from the article!\n\nRegardless of how quickly Elizabethan reform spread throughout England, the legislation of the Elizabethan Settlement did stabilize the face of the Church of England. It remains a unique institution that treads between Catholicism and Protestantism known in other regions. But that does not mean that it was never again contested. The outbreak of Protestant radicalism during the English Civil War challenged ideas of inclusion and tolerance within the church. How far could one's views about faith go before the established church could no longer accept them? Again, the question remained a moving target, and many-faced persecution as the definition of acceptable religion continued to shift.\n\nElizabethan Settlement - Key takeaways\n\nThe Elizabethan Settlement sought to provide a compromise between Protestants and Catholics by making a Church of England that had elements of both.\n\nThe Church of England was Protestant at its core but took the hierarchy from the Catholics by keeping archbishops and bishops.\n\nThe Elizabethan Settlement did not heal the divide between Protestants and Catholics. However, those who refused to comply were persecuted.\n\nThe Church that Elizabeth created is unique. There is none other like it in Europe. Additionally, today's Anglican Church structure is essentially the same as it was in 1563.\n\nReferences\n\nElizabeth I.Oral Tradition, originating from a letter drafted by Bacon; in J. B.
