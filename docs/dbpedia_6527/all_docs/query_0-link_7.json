        "text": "Marriage: Impact on Foreign Relations\n\nElizabeth's Suitors:\n\n1534 Duke of Angoulme (third son of Francis I)\n\nc1542 A Prince of Portugal\n\n1543 Son of the Earl of Arran\n\n1544 Prince Philip (Philip II)\n\n1547 Sir Thomas Seymour\n\n1552 Prince of Denmark\n\n1553 Courtenay, Earl of Devonshire\n\n1554 Philibert Emanuel, Duke of Savoy\n\n1554 Prince of Denmark\n\n1556 Prince Eric of Sweden\n\n1556 Don Carlos (son of Philip II)\n\n1559 Philip II\n\n1559 Prince Eric of Sweden\n\n1559 Son of John Frederic, Duke of Saxony\n\n1559 Sir William Pickering\n\n1559 Earl of Arran\n\n1559 Henry Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel\n\n1559 Robert Dudley\n\n1560 King Eric of Sweden\n\n1560 Adolphus, Duke of Holstein\n\n1560 King Charles IX\n\n1560 Henry, Duke of Anjou\n\n1566 Robert Dudley\n\n1568 Archduke Charles\n\n1570 Henry Duke of Anjou\n\n1572- 1584 Francis, Duke of Alencon, later Anjou.\n\nSpain\n\nAt the beginning of her reign, an obvious candidate for Elizabeth to marry was her half sister's widow, Phillip of Spain. Their union had brought peace between Spain and England, and Elizabeth's Privy Council hoped to maintain this. They were also fearful that France would rekindle their loyalty to Scotland and threaten England from the north and south together. If this union between Scotland and France became something, Spain could help England by attacking France from below. However this union was appalling because he was Catholic was married to the previous queen, and a foreigner. Many people did not want a foreigner influencing England policy.\n\nFrance\n\nAnother serious contender was Francis, Duke of Alencon, later Duke of Anjou. He was younger than Elizabeth but their union was based on a mutual need for France and England to form an alliance. The traditional bonds between England and Spain were deteriorating and England needed the support of France for protection from Spain. The French were Catholic but did not have the same hostility to English Protestantism as Spain was. This was one of the more serious courtships of Elizabeth's reign. He even came to England to meet Elizabeth and she even announced before some of her courtiers that she would marry him. This pleased those eager for her to marry, but made many unhappy because they did not want her to marry a French Catholic.\n\nSweden\n\nAnother suitor for Elizabeth was Prince Eric of Sweden, later King Eric of Sweden. He was a protestant and head of his country; however England viewed Sweden as a mediocre power and not a nation to be linked with in marriage.\n\nHoly Roman Empire\n\nIn 1565 the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire proposed that Elizabeth marry Archduke Charles of Austria. The negotiations dragged on for four years with Elizabeth never giving a firm answer and Charles refusing to give up his Catholic faith.\n\nSpanish Armada\n\nMany reasons led to discontent between Spain and England. The first being Elizabeth's refusal of marriage to Phillip if Spain. Another being the English sympathy to the protestant rebels on the Netherlands. Also, the activities of English â€˜pirates', who looted Spanish ships, caused problems between Spain and England. In 1568, a final blow came when some Spanish ships were blown off course into English waters, and the English seized them. The Spanish responded by doing the same to the English.\n\nSeeing Spain as a threat, Elizabeth tried to form an alliance with France. France however, thought her intention was to create war between France and Spain while England looked on.\n\nThe Spanish Armada sailed in 1588 and was completely defeated by the English. Phillip was warned against this mission but believed he was on a mission from God. Their complete failure effectively ended any threat Spain posed to the English."
