        "text": "Born in 1499, Diane de Poitiers was the widow of Louis de Brézé, Grand-Sénéschal of Normandy, 39 years her senior and a grandson of King Charles VII by his mistress, Agnes Sorèl; he was also reputedly the ugliest man in France. Diane de Poitiers had joined the court at the age of 14 and had married to Louis de Brézé, a rich and powerful widower, the following year. An attractive young woman, Diane had a natural elegance and was careful of her looks. She never used make-up to enhance her appearance, using only cold water on her face and body; she went to bed early and took regular outdoor exercise, avoiding excesses of any sort. When she came to court, Diane was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Claude of France. When Claude died, she served Francis I’s mother, Louise de Savoie and the Queen Eleanor of Austria, King Francis’ second wife. Widowed in 1531, Diane wore black and white – the colour of mourning – for the rest of her life, and she retained control of her husband’s finances, the king allowing her to manage all her inherited estates without the supervision of a male guardian or relative, thus allowing Diane to be financially independent.\n\nThe younger son of Francis I and Queen Claude, Henri had spent 4 years in captivity in Spain from the age of 7. Following Francis I’s defeat at the Battle of Pavia in 1525, in order to obtain his own freedom, the French king had agreed to give up his 2 sons, Henri and his older brother, Francis, as hostages and had them despatched to captivity in Madrid. It was, perhaps, not surprising that Henri had returned from his four years in Spain at the age of eleven ‘an unpolished and silent boy.’1 The king asked Diane de Poitiers to become his son’s tutor. She and the prince developed a strong bond which would eventually develop into a romantic relationship, despite the fact she was 19 years older than Henri.\n\nIn 1533, Henri was married to Catherine de Medici and a year later, Diane became one of his mistresses. And in 1536, at the age of 18, Henri’s older brother, Francis, died suddenly, making the young prince dauphin of France. Two years later, Henri fathered a daughter on another mistress, Filipa Duci, who was the sister of one of his Piedmontese grooms. The baby girl was named Diane de France, in tribute to Henri’s favourite mistress. With his marriage to Catherine de Medici still childless, the birth of an illegitimate daughter was proof, as far as Henri was concerned, that the fault did not lay with him. It was, however, a humiliation for Catherine.\n\nOnce Henri became dauphin, the apparent barrenness of the prince and his wife became a serious concern. Talk at court began to centre around the possible repudiation of Catherine. Diane and Catherine, mistress and wife, formed a truce in order to ward off any attempts to force Henri and Catherine to divorce; concerned that Catherine was failing in her duty to produce an heir and that, although Henri liked Catherine well enough, he was not passionate with her. Aware that her own position would be threatened by the arrival of a new bride for Henri, Diane determined to help Catherine. To resolve the situation, Diane offered the dauphine advice on Henri’s preferred sexual positions and how to arouse the prince’s passion. Awkward! When this did not work, Catherine had spy holes made in her chamber floor so that she could watch Henri, in the chamber below, with Diane. Historian Estelle Paranque explains that; ‘the sight of their intimate encounter only succeeded in deeply hurting the dauphine, however, who realised that Henri did not perform the sexual act the same way with her as he did with his mistress.’2\n\nDiane continued to offer advice to Catherine, before eventually offering to stimulate the prince before sending him to his wife’s bedchamber. However awkward this must have been for both women, it apparently worked, with Catherine herself admitting to Henri showing more passion in their lovemaking. And by June 1543, Catherine was pregnant. A baby boy arrived on 19 January 1544, named Francis after his grandfather. And a year later, a baby girl named Elisabeth joined the little prince in the nursery. Catherine was finally able to feel safe from being discarded and abandoned. Ten children eventually filled the royal nursery, seven of whom reached adulthood.\n\nIn the autumn of 1544, probably somewhat to Catherine’s satisfaction, King Francis’ mistress, the duchesse d’Étampes, with whom Diane had a bitter rivalry, succeeded in arranging her banishment from court, after Henri had replaced one of the duchess’s protégés while campaigning against the English in Picardy. Diane retreated to her château at Anet, closely followed by a sulking Henri. She received permission to return to court the following year.\n\nIn spite of this, Catherine would remain in the shadow of Henri and Diane’s love throughout their marriage, with Henri continuing to shower his favourite mistress with patronage. He even had a monogram designed, interlacing the H and D of their names, and placed them everywhere he could. King Francis I died in 1547, and Henri was now King Henri II of France. But, while Catherine was now queen of France, she wielded little political influence and it was Diane’s star that rose still higher. She was made maitresse en titre and a permanent member of Henri’s privy council. She was showered with jewels and offices, as well as estates and other honours. The Venetian ambassador, Marino Cavalli noted Diane’s influence over the new king, stating that ‘this lady has made sure to indoctrinate, to correct, and counsel’ Henri.3 Wherever the king and queen were found, so too was Diane de Poitiers, walking right behind Catherine. In Paris, Diane was named in the same rank as the princesses of France, while in Rouen the aldermen brought her jewels and gifts made of gold and laid them at her feet. King Henri gave her the royal Château of Chenonceau, despite the protestations of Catherine, who thought it should be hers. Henri ignored Catherine’s pleas. Yet another slight the young queen had to endure due to her husband’s infatuation with Diane de Poitiers.\n\nAnd it was to Diane that the responsibility of impressing foreign ambassadors fell. In 1550 the English ambassador, William Pickering, was staying at the French court, at that time at Diane’s Château of Anet. After his audience with the king, Diane entertained the ambassador, showing him the magnificence of her château. And in 1552, Venetian ambassador Lorenzo Contarini remarked on Diane’s influence at court; ‘she knows about everything and every single day, after dinner, the king looks for her and spends an hour and a half with her to discuss everything that has happened.’4 At tournaments, it was Diane’s colours that the king displayed, not those of his queen. Created Duchess of Valentinois by Henri II, she was, quite literally, the love of his life. Although the king never had children with his maitresse en titre, he did have children with other mistresses and, of course, his wife.\n\nAs Henri’s reign progressed, he began to show greater confidence in his queen, but Diane still managed to thwart the Catherine achieving significant power. In 1548 and in 1552, when Henri was out of the country on campaign, he entrusted Catherine with the regency of France. However, in 1548 Diane managed to persuade Henri to appoint Anne de Montmorency (a man) as co-regent and in 1552, she had Chancellor Bertrandi named as co-regent, effectively forcing Catherine to answer to him.\n\nCatherine would, eventually get the upper hand.\n\nThe rivalry between Catherine de Medici and Diane de Poitiers would come to an abrupt end in the summer of 1559. In the March of that year, Henri had turned 40. He had spent the last 26 years of his life married to Catherine de Medici; for 25 of those years, he had been in love with Diane de Poitiers. On 22 June, Catherine and Henri’s daughter, Elisabeth, was married to Philip II, King of Spain, by proxy in Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. The wedding was followed by a series of celebratory tournaments. In 1552, Catherine had been warned by Simeoni, the famous astrologer, that Henri would die in a duel in his 40th year, and that the wound would first blind him. This knowledge made a superstitious Catherine quite anxious as the jousts started. However, the king was always eager to impress his mistress with his prowess in the lists, wearing her colours of black and white. The king performed admirably against his first opponent, winning when he hit his brother-in-law, the duke of Savoy, in the chest and unhorsed him. The second bout was a draw, and it was after this that Catherine asked him to retire, but Diane de Poitiers encouraged the king to continue and in the next joust, though unhurt, Henri fell off his horse. The king insisted on going again, against the same opponent, Gabriel de Montgomery, and it was at this moment that King Henri II’s luck ran out.\n\nMontgomery’s lance struck the king’s helmet, a fragment of the splintered lance having pierced Henri’s eye. Henri had fallen from his horse, and as his squires removed his helmet they revealed a face covered in blood. The mortally wounded king was carried to his chambers and placed in his bed, joined by Diane and Catherine, one at either side, both sobbing. Catherine called the renowned surgeon Ambroise Paré to attend the king, but after practicing the required surgery on executed prisoners, Paré had to tell the queen that the king could not be saved. Henri II lingered for 10 days, in agonising pain, before dying on 10 July 1559. He had been attended throughout by his queen. Henri is said to have called out for Diane, but she was not allowed to see him, nor attend the funeral. Diane was banished from court. Her influence ended with the king’s death and power now rested firmly in the hands of Queen Catherine, mother and regent to the new king, Francis II.\n\nOn hearing of Henri’s death, Diane wrote to Catherine asking for ‘pardon for my past offences against your person’ and signing the letter ‘your most obedient and loyal subject.’5 Diane sent back some crown jewels, items that had been gifted to her by Henri, in the hope that the queen would be compassionate. Diane de Poitiers knew that without the king’s protection, she was vulnerable to Catherine’s malice. The queen was not spiteful, however, and allowed Diane to keep all that she had acquired in her years at court. Except for the Château of Chenonceau. Diane retreated to her château at Anet, where she had once entertained ambassadors and lived there, a virtual exile. She would die there in 1566, following a fall from her horse the year before. For a quarter of a century, Diane de Poitiers had enjoyed more influence as the king’s mistress than any other woman in France, including the queen. Henri II had showered affection, riches and power on the woman who had held his heart, choosing to ignore the humiliations that he was heaping upon his wife.\n\nThe scandalous ménage-a-trois only ended with the king’s death.\n\n*\n\nImages:\n\nCourtesy of Wikipedia\n\nNotes:\n\n1.

Carol Ann’s new book Courting the Virgin Queen: Queen Elizabeth I and Her Suitors is due to be released on 30 July by Pen and Sword. If it is anything like her first book, The Tudors By Numbers: The Stories and Statistics Behind England’s Most Infamous Royal Dynasty, it will be a fabulous read!\n\n“All the Queen’s Men: The Courtships of the Virgin Queen”\n\nCarol Ann Lloyd\n\nIt’s ironic that the child of the most-married English monarch ever is the only English monarch to rule as an adult and never marry! Elizabeth I, daughter of the famous (infamous?) Henry VIII never married. But it was not for lack of options.\n\nThe big question is “Why?” Did Elizabeth really want to marry anyone? What kept her from marrying? Did she ever intend to marry, or was she just keeping all her options open as she navigated the perilous landscape of European politics on her own?\n\nI think there are many ways on answering this question. Let’s start at the beginning of her reign. Elizabeth was the least likely of Henry VIII’s children to come to the throne, and when she did everyone had the same question on their mind. As the Spanish Ambassador, the Count of Feria, reflected in the early days of the reign, “The more I think over this business the more certain I am that everything depends upon the husband this woman may take.” Elizabeth was questioned about her choice of husband by her council, ambassadors, and parliament. It was considered a public not a private matter, and the queen was repeatedly encouraged and counseled to get married and produce an heir for the good of the kingdom.\n\nSo, if everything depended on the husband her would take, what realistically were her options?\n\nSome people might be surprised to learn that one of her first suitors was the husband of her recently deceased sister. Philip of Spain had been married to Mary I until her death, and the couple had no children. Still committed to bringing England back into the Catholic fold, Philip believed he could marry and control Elizabeth. I was surprised as I read his correspondence how convinced Philip was that Elizabeth was desperate for a husband and eager for his offer. Many Catholics never accepted the validity of the marriage between Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, so Elizabeth’s hold on the throne was possibly tenuous. Philip believed he was the answer to Elizabeth’s problem. He thought she would jump at the chance.\n\nPhilip could not have been more wrong. Elizabeth knew very well that Philip would seek to involve England in Spain’s wars, as he had during Mary I’s reign. Using her skills in language, Elizabeth dallied with Feria and postponed giving a firm answer until it suited her. That answer was a definite “no.”\n\nThe offer from Philip was only the beginning. I discovered in my research that Elizabeth used the many marriage possibilities as a way of strengthening her position with the international community. She managed to keep several foreign leaders eager for an alliance with England and a marriage with her. Over the years, the king of Sweden, European dukes and archdukes, and even all three of Catherine de Medici’s sons in France were offered as possible husband. And that doesn’t take into account the Scottish and English nobles who wanted to marry the queen.\n\nSpeaking of men in England, was it really Robert Dudley who kept Elizabeth from marrying? He most likely was the love of her life, perhaps the only man she might have married if she had not been the queen. He was at the center of her life, from the day she learned Mary I had died, and she was queen. He became Elizabeth’s Master of the Horse, which meant he was always with her when she went riding, one of her favorite activities. And he was the only man in the kingdom with permission to touch the queen as he helped her onto and off horse.\n\nEven with Dudley’s favored position, there were a few problems in the way. For one thing, he was married. And then his wife died in very suspicious circumstances, making a future marriage potentially devastating for Elizabeth’s reputation. Dudley was unpopular among the council. And ultimately, I believe Elizabeth meant what she is reported to have shouted at him in anger: “I will have but one mistress here and no master.”\n\nSo, did everything depend upon the husband Elizabeth took? Yes, it turns out it did. I realized through the research that the one suitor that Elizabeth courted throughout her reign was the husband she had declared herself wed to when she became queen: her country and her people. Early in her reign, Elizabeth had responded to parliament’s request that she marry by responding that she was “already bound unto a husband which is the kingdom of England.” From the time she became queen, Elizabeth wooed her nation and her people, seeking their approval, favor, and love. That was the husband she took, and it meant everything to her.\n\nAbout the book:\n\nThe many courtships of the woman who became Elizabeth I began when she was an infant, displayed before foreign ambassadors who considered her as a possible clause of a contract between England and France. From such an unromantic beginning, Elizabeth grew to see her father marry multiple times and experienced frequent changes in stepmothers and status in the family. Eventually, she became the most eligible woman in Europe. From start to finish, her marriage prospects were as much political as they were personal.\n\nWhen she came to the throne in 1558, the primary question facing everyone from foreign monarchs to English nobles and ministers was which of her many suitors would finally win her hand. Through the longest Tudor reign, Elizabeth used courtship as a tool to consider foreign alliances, hold ambitious English courtiers in check, and navigate her role as a woman ruler in a world that considered her unnatural without a man at her side.\n\nElizabeth was, in fact, always the ‘Virgin Queen’, from the early days as a twenty-five-year-old presenting herself as a potential royal bride to her final years as an ageing and unmarried woman who was destined to end the Tudor dynasty. Ultimately, she became the only monarch in England to rule as an adult and never marry. Through it all, as friends and potential lovers faded away, she clung to the one true love of her life: England.\n\nCourting the Virgin Queen: Queen Elizabeth I and Her Suitors is available from Pen and Sword and Amazon.\n\nAbout the author:\n\nCarol Ann Lloyd turned an obsession with the Tudors into a speaking and writing career. She shares her love of history with Smithsonian Associates, Royal Oak Foundation, Agecroft Hall, Folger Shakespeare Library and other organizations.

As the eldest surviving child of Mary Tudor, dowager Queen of France and Duchess of Suffolk, Frances was fourth in line to the throne after the children of Henry VIII, Edward, Mary and Elizabeth. When settling the succession, the king had instructed that his younger sister Mary’s line should be preferred over that of his older sister, Margaret. As a consequence, Frances was frequently at court.\n\nThe couple’s first child, a son, died young. They had three surviving daughters. The eldest, Jane, was born in October 1537, about the same time as her cousin Edward, the future King Edward VI; with the birth of the longed-for heir to the throne, Jane’s own birth went almost unnoticed. Jane would have been named after Henry VIII’s tragic queen, Jane Seymour, who died within two weeks of Edward’s birth.\n\nJane Grey would be known to history as the Nine Days’ Queen.\n\nShe was raised at the family home of Bradgate Park, near Leicester. Frances and Henry Grey are said to have been very strict parents who were not prone to expressions of love and affection; the children were used to sarcasm, cuffs and criticism. In her teenage years, Jane herself is said to have complained to the visiting scholar Roger Ascham:\n\n‘When I am in the presence either of father or mother, whether I speak, keep silence, sit, stand or go, eat, drink, be merry or sad, be sewing, playing, dancing, or doing anything else, I must do it as it were in such weight, measure and number, even so perfectly as God made the world; or else I am so sharply taunted, so cruelly threatened, yea presently sometimes with pinches, nips and bobs and other ways (which I will not name for the honour I bear them) … that I think myself in hell.’1\n\nJane enjoyed study and excelled in all fields, including Greek and philosophy. She was afforded a first-class education and from 1545 her tutor was John Aylmer. Aylmer had been sponsored through his studies at Cambridge by Jane’s father, the Marquess of Dorset, and was a brilliant academic. As a future courtier, Jane was given lessons in dance and music; probably including the popular instruments, the lute, spinet and virginal. In religion, Jane and her sisters were raised as ‘evangelicals’, the common word in the first half of the sixteenth century for Protestants. From the age of nine, Jane’s mother would have taken her to court from time to time, to familiarise her daughter with the court and her future duties as a Maid of Honour. Frances was at the time serving as a Lady of the Privy Chamber to the king’s sixth wife, Kateryn Parr, Henry VIII’s 6th and final wife.\n\nIn January 1547, King Henry VIII died and was succeeded by his 9-year-old son, Edward VI. Jane and Edward were first cousins, once removed,and it is entirely possible – even likely – that Frances and Henry harboured hopes that Jane would marry the young king. It was Henry VIII’s will that shaped and dominated Jane’s future. More than ten years before his death, Parliament had granted Henry the right to bequeath the crown where he desired, rather than by strict primogeniture. In his final will, dated 26 December 1546, Henry excluded the Stuart line of his elder sister Margaret and settled the succession, should his children die without heirs, on the descendants of his younger sister, Mary, Duchess of Suffolk. Should Edward, Mary and Elizabeth all die without producing a child of their own, Jane would be queen; although Henry probably still held out hope that Frances would produce a son who could inherit ahead of the sisters.\n\nThe government of England was now in the hands of the boy-king’s uncle Edward Seymour, Earl of Somerset – soon to become duke of Somerset. Somerset and Henry Grey did not get along well and Grey, though he was the only marquess in England he was not appointed to the new king’s privy council. The younger brother of Somerset, Thomas Seymour, the Lord High Admiral of England and first Baron Seymour of Sudeley, having recently – and rather scandalously – married the king’s widow, proposed that he take on the wardship of Lady Jane. Henry Grey was reluctant, given the scandal attached to the hasty marriage of Queen Kateryn and Seymour just four months after the king’s death. However, Princess Elizabeth had already joined the dowager queen’s household and Seymour hinted at arranging a marriage between Jane and the young king when they were old enough, sweetening the deal with the offer of a payment of £2,000 for Jane’s wardship.\n\nJoining the household of the dowager queen was a great opportunity for Jane, which would provide her with connections that would benefit herself and her family. And so, at ten years-old, Jane was given into the custody of Thomas Seymour and from then on was frequently in the household of Kateryn Parr, at Chelsea and later at Sudeley Castle. This was one of the happiest periods of Jane’s short life.\n\nDuring her time in the dowager queen’s household, Jane got to know her cousin, Princess Elizabeth, better, though they never grew close. At thirteen, Elizabeth was too old to pay much attention to ten-year-old Jane. And despite her tender years, Elizabeth was rather self-contained and distant; she had already experienced the highs and lows of royal life, from being lauded as her father’s heir to being declared a bastard and knowing her mother was executed as a traitor. The princess had learned not to trust easily and to keep her own counsel. That Jane was, technically, Elizabeth’s heir, must have made the relationship more fractious in a world where one’s inheritance could be erased by an act of parliament.\n\nJane must have enjoyed living in a household of well educated, inquisitive women. One wonders, though, if she was aware of other goings-on in the household, as Thomas Seymour paid excessive attention to Princess Elizabeth. This caused tensions within the household, especially after the queen fell pregnant and began to fear that Seymour saw Elizabeth as a suitable replacement should she die in childbirth. Fearful for the princess’s reputation – and of her husband’s intentions – Elizabeth was sent away by Kateryn. Jane was now the most senior lady in the queen dowager’s household. And when Kateryn died a week after giving birth to her only child, Lady Mary Seymour, it was 11-year-old Jane who acted as chief mourner at her funeral, walking behind the queen’s coffin from the house to the chapel at Sudeley.\n\nAfter the funeral, the queen’s household was broken up and Jane sent home to her parents. Within a few weeks, however, Thomas Seymour, now over the first stages of grief at losing his wife, given the blow to his finances and status the queen’s death had caused, realised that he could yet regain some standing if he resumed his guardianship of Jane. It took some persuading, but Seymour assured Henry and Frances that Jane would be well cared for and under the supervision of his mother. Although the late dowager queen’s women were still in Seymour’s household, the atmosphere had changed; and as Seymour’s ambitions came under suspicion from the Privy Council, it must have been an uncomfortable place for Jane to be. Amid rumours that Thomas Seymour was intending to marry Princess Elizabeth, he was arrested, as were Elizabeth’s servants. Elizabeth herself continued to insist that she would never agree to marry anyone without the Council’s permission.\n\nSeymour was condemned for high treason by Act of Attainder and executed on 20 March 1549. On Seymour’s arrest, Jane had returned to Dorset House, her family’s London residence. Henry Grey may have seen his own hopes of advancement and Jane’s marriage to Edward VI disappear at Seymour’s arrest, but he must have been relieved that at least he had survived the affair with his head still on his shoulders. Besides, the wheel of fortune was about to turn his way. People were becoming increasingly disenchanted with Somerset’s rule and in the wake of Kett’s Rebellion in Norfolk, by 14 October it was Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, who was lodged in the Tower under arrest. John Dudley, Earl of Warwick and future Duke of Northumberland, took the reins of government. Henry Grey was finally appointed to the Privy Council and received numerous rewards of office and grants of lands and lordships.\n\nJane’s marriage was never far from the minds of those in power. Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset had wanted to marry Jane to his oldest son and heir, the earl of Hertford, also called Edward. Nothing had come of this plan by the time of Somerset’s fall. Before that, as early as 1541, the French Ambassador had proposed that she marry Charles, Duke of Orléans, third son of King Francis I, but the boy died in 1545. John Dudley initially favoured a marriage between Jane and the king. The children born of such a marriage would secure the succession and guarantee the continuance of the new religion within England’s borders. It would also resolve the problems associated with the succession of Mary or Elizabeth. Jane and Edward were good friends and corresponded regularly, but neither Jane nor Edward appeared enthusiastic about the suggestion and the idea was dropped, for the time being.\n\nBy February of 1553, the point was moot.\n\nThe young king was ill again, and it was becoming apparent that he was dying. Those around him started looking to the problem of the succession. The next in line was Princess Mary, a committed Catholic who would undo all the work Edward had done in advancing the Reformation. Edward could not pass over Mary’s claim to the crown in favour of Elizabeth, so chose to exclude all females from the succession and his ‘Device’ would leave the crown to ‘the Lady Jane’s heirs male’. As his health failed him, in June King Edward changed the wording of the Device to ‘The Lady Jane and her heirs male.’ Further arguments for excluding Mary and Elizabeth centred on their legitimacy – open to question after Henry VIII had, at various times, declared them both illegitimate – and the fear that they would marry outside of England.\n\nJane, on the other hand, was married to Lord Guildford Dudley, the fifteen-year-old son of John Dudley, now Duke of Northumberland and Lord President of the Council. Their parents saw the young couple as an alternative, Protestant king and queen to the Catholic Mary. The wedding had taken place in May 1553 in Dudley’s London home, Durham House. The young couple had been reluctant to marry and were bullied into it by their parents.\n\nAged just fifteen, King Edward VI died at Greenwich Palace on 6 July 1553. He was unmarried and left no heir. As the king lay dying Mary was summoned to the council, but instead rode to Kenninghall in Norfolk, with Robert Dudley despatched to intercept her with orders to take the princess to a place of safety. On 8 July, Mary heard the news of the king’s death and the following day proclaimed herself queen, despatching a letter to the Privy Council, ordering them to endorse her claim. She then moved to the formidable fortress of Framlingham Castle, where thousands flocked to her standard. Princess Elizabeth initially stayed away, pleading illness, watching and waiting to see how events played out. On 9 July the Privy Council summoned Lady Jane, recuperating from an illness at Chelsea, to appear before them. Dudley’s daughter, Mary Sidney, was sent to escort Jane by barge to Syon House, where she was greeted by two nobles who knelt before her, kissed her and informed her that Edward had nominated her as his successor. John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland and now father-in-law of the new queen, gave a lengthy speech, informing all present that King Edward’s wish had been for Jane to succeed him. Jane was left trembling and speechless before she fell to the ground, crying and declaring\n\nI am insufficient to fill the role.2\n\nJane’s reaction to the proclamation of her accession to the throne suggests that she was not aware of the plans of Edward, Dudley and her father to make her queen. Though she was a clever girl and may well have suspected what was afoot. The next morning, dressed in the green and white of the Tudors and accompanied by her husband Guildford dressed equally splendidly in white and gold, Jane was escorted to the Tower in a procession of barges. There were no flags being waved, and no crowds lining the river to get a glimpse of their new queen. London was only just learning of the king’s death. Jane was greeted at the Tower by the Marquess of Winchester and Sir John Bridges, Lieutenant of the Tower, and various other civilian and military officials. Winchester knelt before the young queen and presented the keys to the fortress. John Dudley stepped forward and took them. Jane then made her ceremonial entrance into the White Tower and, with flags flying, a fanfare of trumpets and guns firing in salute, was seated under the canopy of state. The crown was brought to her, but she initially refused to wear it, only putting it on when Winchester persuaded her that he wished to see how it suited her.\n\nOn one matter, Jane was adamant. She refused to make Guildford king: ‘If the crown belongs to me, I would be content to make my husband a duke. But I will never consent to make him king.’3 Royal blood flowed through Jane’s veins, not her husband’s. Apparently, Guildford fled the room in tears, but his parents were hopeful that Jane could be persuaded to change her mind. After all, they lived in a patriarchal society and no one expected that a woman could actually rule in her own right.\n\nThe Privy Council and leading judges declared Jane the new Queen of England.\n\nThat Sunday, at St Paul’s Cross, Bishop Ridley preached that as bastards, Mary and Elizabeth were unfit for the crown and that Mary’s Catholicism was a particular threat to the country, exposing it to foreign influence. A devout Protestant, Jane was seen as the symbol of continuity for the Protestant faith, untainted by any previous declarations of illegitimacy. However, there was no rejoicing and only the herald could be heard to shout ‘Long live the Queen!’\n\nFor 9 days, Jane was England’s first female monarch.\n\nBy 12 July, Mary and her supporters had gathered at Framlingham, Suffolk. Within days, the duke of Northumberland rode out of London with 3,000 men, promising to capture or kill Mary. Jane ordered the gates to the Tower be locked and the keys given to her. On 18 July, Jane began raising troops to be led against rebels in Buckinghamshire. But as Northumberland left London, everything began to fall apart. Rumours circulated that Mary had a force of 30,000. Londoners refused to rally to the duke’s army.\n\nNorthumberland’s coup collapsed.\n\nOn 19 July, Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, declared in favour of Mary. He entered his daughter’s chamber, where she sat at dinner under a canopy of state, and dramatically tore down the hangings. The next day, the Privy Council proclaimed Mary as Queen of England. And Jane went from being queen to a prisoner in the Tower of London; she was taken from the royal apartments to the Gentleman Gaoler’s lodgings. Her mother and ladies-in-waiting were allowed to return home, which they did without delay.\n\nMary was crowned on 1 October 1533, and Jane’s younger sisters Katherine and Mary became maids of honour to the new queen. Frances, too, was welcomed at court. John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, Jane’s father-in-law, had been tried and convicted of high treason and executed on 22 August 1553. After just a few days in the Tower, Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, was pardoned and allowed to go home to his wife.\n\nAs for Jane, in November, she, her husband and two of his brothers were tried and convicted of high treason. Mary was willing to be merciful and spared their lives, for the moment. Jane was kept in comfortable confinement and may have hoped that she would eventually be released, had her father not involved himself in yet another plot…\n\nOpposed to Mary’s proposed marriage to Philip of Spain, the Wyatt rebellion, led by Sir Thomas Wyatt, the son of the poet who was an admirer of Anne Boleyn, aimed to overthrow Mary. The intent was to marry Princess Elizabeth to Edward Courtney, Earl of Devon and a descendant of Edward IV, and put Elizabeth on the throne. As Wyatt raised an army in Kent, Grey was raising forces in the Midlands. However, Wyatt’s forces were overwhelmed as London closed its gates to them and Grey was arrested at his manor of Astley. He was taken prisoner, arraigned for his treason, condemned, and executed at the Tower on 23 February 1554, less than a month after his brief rebellion began.\n\nThough she was in no way implicated in the rebellion, her father’s actions had already sealed Jane’s fate; her very existence as a possible figurehead for Protestant discontent made her an unacceptable danger to the state. The queen could no longer afford to be merciful, and Mary signed the death warrant for Jane and Guildford; the sentence for Jane was commuted from burning to beheading. She received a few days’ stay of execution while Mary sent the dean of St Paul’s, John Feckenham, to her to try and persuade Jane to accept the Catholic faith. But Jane remained steadfast, writing ‘Lord, thou God and father of my life, hear me poor and desolute woman, arm me, I beseech thee, with thy armour, that I may stand fast.’4\n\nThe night before her execution, aware that her father, by now also imprisoned in the Tower, was in great distress over her fate, Jane wrote a final letter to him:\n\n‘Father, although it pleases God to hasten my death by one by whom my life should rather have been lengthened; yet can I so patiently take it, that I yield God more hearty thanks for shortening my woeful days, than if all the world had been given into my possession, with life lengthened at my own will. And albeit I am assured for your impatient dolours redoubled manifold ways, both in bewailing your own woe, and especially, as I hear, my unfortunate state; yet, dear father (if I may without offence rejoice in my own mishaps), herein I may account myself blessed, that washing my hands with the innocence of my fact, my guiltless blood may cry before the Lord, ‘Mercy to the innocent!’5\n\nAt ten the next morning Guildford Dudley was taken from the Tower and escorted to Tower Hill for his execution. Jane watched him leave from her window. As Jane walked to her own execution, Guildford’s body was carried into the Tower’s chapel, St Peter Ad Vincula, for burial. Dressed in black, Jane mounted the scaffold by the White Tower. Speaking to the assembled crowd, she performed the traditional admission of guilt, saying that she had acted against the queen’s highness, though qualified it with:\n\n‘Touching the procurement and desire thereof by me or on my behalf, I do wash my hands thereof in innocence.’6\n\nHaving said her piece, and her prayers, Jane gave her gloves and handkerchief to Elizabeth Tilney and her prayer book to Thomas Bridges, the brother of the Lieutenant of the Tower. Jane then removed her gown, headdress and neckerchief as the executioner knelt to ask her forgiveness, which Jane gave willingly.\n\nJane knelt and, with her handkerchief tied over her eyes, she had to feel for the block and cried out ‘What shall I do? Where is it?’ when she couldn’t find it.7 One of those close by guided her to the block.\n\nHer final words were ‘Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit!’8\n\nShe was despatched with one stroke of the axe.\n\nNotes:\n\n1 .Lady jane Grey quoted in Jill Armitage, Four Queens and a Countess: Mary Queen of Scots, Elizabeth I, Mary I, Lady Jane Grey and Bess of Hardwick, p. 54; 2.

I also liked the way some Tudor women pop up in several categories, highlighting the complexity of their lives. As with her medieval heroines, some of the categories are thought provoking, such as the idea of heroic mistresses and scandalous heroines, but this makes for a lively and engaging read.” Read the whole 5* review over at The Writing Desk.\n\nAnd Medieval Madame, on Instagram, also gave Heroines of the Tudor World 5 stars:\n\n“Automatically, when we think of the Tudor woman we tend to think of King Henry VIII’s wives, ladies in waiting or mistresses like Lady Jane Parker and Mary Boleyn. Yet so many women played a vital role, and they are lesser known but those who are more widely known don’t get enough recognition. Women, the weaker, frailer, gentler sex who should have a purpose: ‘stay at home, do embroidery, bear children – hope to survive!’ Not forgetting obey your Husband!\n\nThis book centres around women who, either by chance or decision, step out of the mould society cast upon them, even if it meant death. Remember, the Tudor World was one of the most vicious times in English history.\n\nIn this 12 chapter book, Sharon Bennett Connolly looks at many women from different backgrounds, and placed into chapters that’s what made their names live on. Take for example chapter 11 we see, “Literary Heroines,” here you can read about Margaret Roper, daughter of Sir Thomas More. Religious reformist, published, Queen Katherine Parr. Then French royalty who could well handle a quill!\n\nOther heroines include: Caterina Sforza, Elizabeth Barton, Katherine Willoughby, Mary Queen of Scots, Anne de Vere and so many more – the list is vast! That is what makes an interesting read. Whether by religion, royalty, nobility or scandal.\n\nSharon has achieved another piece of thought provoking literature by shining a light on this enjoyable and contemporary read. As a sequel to her “Heroines of the Medieval World,” this certainly does not disappoint, and I enjoyed it equally.\n\nFor an in-depth view on many resilient, defiant and warrior women, who could very well be the first step to what we know in modern times as feminism. This is it! This is an excellent read, most certainly in the top three reads of the year. Sharon has crafted her creative writing once more for our educational enjoyment.\n\n[Gifted] To Be Released 15 June 2024″\n\nAll About History\n\nAll About History magazine gave Heroines of the Tudor World 4 stars, highlighting that the book ‘reminds readers that the lot of women in this era was not an easy one, but in these fascinating stories she reminds us too that there have always been women who dared to challenge the status quo. Whether standing up for country, crown, family or love, the women who spring to life in these pages are richly deserving of their place in history.’\n\nThe first review on Amazon was from Helen Musson. It was short but oh so very, very sweet:\n\nBrilliant!\n\nAnd what an incredible review of Heroines of the Tudor World from Heidi Malagisi at Adventures of a Tudor Nerd:\n\n“Connolly gave her readers a thrilling look into the 16th century….my only complaint is that it was not a longer book…”If you have enjoyed Sharon Bennett Connolly’s previous books and you are a Tudor nerd, I highly suggest you read, ‘Heroines of the Tudor World.'”\n\nInterviews, podcasts and YouTube\n\nYou can find me talking about my choice of Heroines of the Tudor World on some of the best Tudor podcasts:\n\nOn Tudors Dynasty I may have mentioned to Rebecca Larsen that I don’t think much of Henry VIII.

Frances Walsingham was the daughter of Queen Elizabeth’s spymaster, Francis Walsingham who married three times, including the soldier-poet, Sir Philip Sidney and, later, Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex\n\nSo, over to Tony…\n\nFrances – Tudor Countess: The History Behind the Book\n\nThe origins of my latest book can be traced to my birth in Pembroke, Wales, close to the medieval castle where Henry Tudor was born. I couldn’t find any books which brought his story to life, and was inspired to write the Tudor Trilogy, where Henry is born in the first book, comes of age in the second, and becomes King of England in the third.\n\nThe success of the Tudor Trilogy led to the idea of following the dynasty in a continuous thread to the end, with the death of Queen Elizabeth I. I enjoy studying the real history to understand the social, political and economic context, and like to offer readers an historically authentic ‘immersive’ experience.\n\nOver the past ten years I’ve built an extensive reference collection of books on everything Tudor and Elizabethan, from medicine to recipes, childbirth to government, as well as numerous biographies of key players in the story of the Tudors. All this research provides the backdrop within which the real lives and relationships of my chosen subjects develop and evolve.\n\nFor my second trilogy I decided to write about the reign of Henry VIII as the ‘Brandon Trilogy’, from the perspective of his youngest sister, Mary, his best friend, Charles Brandon, and the woman who some say could have become his seventh wife, Katherine Willoughby.\n\nThis took me to the Elizabethan era, and the decision to explore the enigmatic queen through three of her favourite men, Drake, Essex and Raleigh. Each saw her very differently, as Drake was in awe of her, Essex was like the son she never had, and Raleigh became captain of her guard.\n\nI found that most of what I thought I knew about these men was wrong or missing vital details. I discovered Drake strived to understand and help liberate enslaved people. The heroic failure of the Essex rebellion was more about his lack of emotional intelligence than political ambition, and Raleigh’s colonisation of the New World was conducted from the comfort of his home through the courageous sacrifices of others.\n\nI also realised I would need to make the Elizabethan books a series of six, rather than a trilogy, and explore the complexity of Queen Elizabeth through the eyes of three of her ladies. I had plenty to choose from, but found the most interesting were Penelope, eldest daughter of the queen’s nemesis, Lady Lettice Knollys, Frances, the only surviving child of the queen’s spymaster, Walsingham, and one of her ‘Gentlewomen’, Bess Raleigh.\n\nOne of my favourite historical sources for the Elizabethan series is “The Elizabethan Court Day by Day” by Marion E. Colthorpe. A rich and varied collection of research, this is where I discovered such details as the queen’s chambers being infested with fleas, which accumulated at the windows, the lists of participants in Accession Day jousts, and actual menus for royal banquets. Most importantly, this resource enabled me to cross-check events on any day at the Elizabethan court with other sources to ensure historical accuracy.\n\nOf the many biographies I’ve studied, an unexpected source I found useful was Daphne du Maurier’s work on Francis and Anthony Bacon, who became important advisors to Frances in her struggle to understand and influence events at court. I also collected the works of the late Professor David Loades, particularly on the lives of William and Robert Cecil, who provide a connection between the books of the Elizabethan series.\n\nTo anyone looking for a deeper understanding of the Elizabethan world, I also recommend Liza Picard’s Elizabeth’s London: Everyday Life in Elizabethan London and The Time Traveller’s Guide to Elizabethan England by Ian Mortimer. There are plenty of well-researched books about the great events of the period, such as the Spanish Armada, but I was keen to develop a sense of how my subjects lived from day to day, what they wore, what they ate, and most importantly, how they thought about their world.\n\nWhen I set out on this ‘journey’ to tell the story of the Tudors I had no idea how much I would learn about fascinating women such as Frances Walsingham, who witnessed the key events of the Elizabethan era first-hand, yet is so little known – until now.\n\nTo Buy the book:\n\nFrances – Tudor Countess is new from Amazon in the United Kingdom and United States in eBook and Paperback, and an audiobook edition will be produced this year:\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nTony Riches is a full-time UK author of best-selling Tudor historical fiction.

Dumas also wrote of Marguerite de Valois, La Reine Margot, who appears in my latest book, Heroines of the Tudor World.\n\nMarguerite was the youngest surviving daughter of King Henri II of France and his queen, Catherine de Medici. She was born at the Château of St Germaine-en-Laye on 14 May 1553. She was her parents’ seventh child; their third daughter. She was raised alongside her two older sisters, Elisabeth (born in 1545) and Claude (born in 1547). Her brothers closest in age to her were Charles (born in 1550), Henri (born in 1551) and her younger brother Hercules (born in 1555), who would change his name to François when he was confirmed. Her brother, Henri, only two years older than her, was Marguerite’s closest family friendship as a child, though this did not last into adulthood. Henri would eventually rule France as King Henri III, succeeding to the throne on the death of his older brother Charles IX. Marguerite’s oldest brother was Francis – the future Francis II – who was born in 1544 and would go on to marry Mary, Queen of Scots. Another brother, Louis, died in 1550 at the age of just eighteen months.\n\nMarguerite experienced tragedy at an early age, when her father, Henri II, died in July 1559, ten days after a jousting accident in which a lance had pierced his eye. Marguerite was only six years old. The princess was well educated and studied literature, classics, history, and a number of ancient and contemporary languages. She was also taught the complexities and dangers of sixteenth century politics and saw her mother acting as regent for her brother, Charles IX, becoming the most powerful person in France and a woman of international importance.\n\nAs a teenager, Marguerite fell in love with Henry of Guise. He was a duke from a prominent family, but when they were found out, Henry was exiled from court and Marguerite was beaten so badly by her mother and brother, Charles IX, that her clothes were torn and ruined. The Guises might be a powerful family, and the most powerful Catholic faction at court, but their influence and popularity were a threat to the government of Catherine de Medici and the queen was not about to increase their prestige further by allowing the duke to marry her daughter.\n\nMarguerite was a princess of France and not free to follow her heart.\n\nThe family had other plans for her marriage. Queen Catherine arranged with Jeanne d’Albret, Queen of Navarre, that Marguerite would marry her son, the Huguenot prince, Henri of Navarre. Although he had grown up at the French court, Henri’s mother had insisted that he be raised a Protestant. Henri was from the Bourbon branch of the French royal family and was the closest male relative to the throne after Marguerite’s brothers, he was the ‘First Prince of the Blood.’ Should her brothers die without producing heirs of their own, Henri of Navarre, though a Protestant, would be next in line to the throne. In 1572, when Marguerite and Henri married, Henri’s succession would have been only a distant possibility, with the twenty-two-year-old king, Charles IX, recently married himself and hoping for an heir; and two younger brothers to follow him should he not provide a son of his own.\n\nThe marriage of Henri and Marguerite was intended to rebuild family ties and broker peace between the French Catholics and the Huguenots, the French Protestants. Since 1560, France had been riven by factions, with the powerful Guise family championing the prospect of eradicating Protestantism within France, backed by Spain and the papacy. The Bourbons, led by Henri of Navarre’s mother, Jeanne d’Albret, led the Huguenots, French Calvinists. As queen, Catherine de Medici tried for compromise, wanting France to be independent of foreign powers, such as Spain and the papacy. Tens of thousands of French had died in the religious wars, despite the signing of a number a peace treaties, which never held. The 1572 Peace of St Germain-en-Laye was to seal the treaty with a wedding.\n\nOf Marguerite, her future daughter-in-law, Jeanne d’Albret wrote:\n\n‘As for her beauty, I agree she has a good figure but she holds herself in too much. As for her face, she uses so much help, it does irritate me, because she will ruin herself. But in this court make-up is normal just like in Spain.’1\n\nMarguerite was a pawn in the midst of this political dispute. Born in December 1553, Henri was seven months younger than his bride. He and Marguerite were second cousins, both being the great-grandchildren of Charles, Count of Angoulême and his wife, Louise de Savoie. Marguerite descended from their son, Francis I, King of France, while Henri was descended from Francis’s sister, Marguerite d’Angoulême, Queen of Navarre. The young couple was betrothed in April 1572 and appeared to like each other at first, though it soon became evident that there was no chemistry between them, no physical attraction. It would be the first royal marriage between a Catholic and a Protestant. Henri’s mother, Jeanne d’Albret died before the wedding could take place, in June 1572, making Henri the new king of Navarre.\n\nThe wedding ceremony took place at the cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris, atop a platform that had been erected on the western façade of the church and hung with cloth of gold, so that everyone could watch; Protestant Henri refused to be married within the Catholic cathedral and so the wedding would be conducted outside. At three o’clock in the afternoon, the king of Navarre and his entourage made a stately procession to the church. Henri was dressed in a doublet and cape of rich yellow satin, embroidered with diamonds and pearls. He was escorted by two of the bride’s brothers, the dukes of Anjou and Alençon.\n\nThe vast crowds were there to see Marguerite, described as ‘the greatest beauty in the world’ by a Neapolitan ambassador. She was led from the archbishop’s palace, close to the cathedral, by her brother, King Charles IX. The princess was wearing an ermine-trimmed gown of royal blue silk. Her fifteen-foot train was carried by three ladies-in-waiting. The ceremony was officiated by the Cardinal de Bourbon and when he asked Marguerite if she would take Henri as her husband, she refused to answer; her brother pushed her head so that she appeared to nod, and the cardinal took this to be her assent. The vows concluded, Marguerite and her party went inside the church to hear Mass, while Henri and his entourage waited outside.\n\nThere were three days of feasting to celebrate the marriage of Henri and Marguerite, the King and Queen of Navarre, before the peace was shattered by an assassination attempt on the Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny. Coligny was shot in the shoulder by the Sieur de Marevert. Firing from a house belonging to the duke de Guise, he had been aiming to kill. Coligny survived and was taken back to his lodgings, where the bullet was removed, the king sending his own physician to assist in Coligny’s treatment. Tensions were running high and Henri of Navarre and his attendants, staying at the Hôtel de Navarre, were nervous. On the morning of 24 August, Marguerite was woken by banging on her door, at which a blood-stained soldier staggered in, shouting ‘Navarre! Navarre!,’ pursued by two more men, armed with bows and arrows.\n\nThe St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre was proceeding through the streets of Paris. Maurevert’s attempted assassination of Coligny, probably at the orders of Henry of Guise, had caused the King and his mother to fear that they would be blamed. In order to prevent reprisals, they chose to strike first, sending their soldiers against the Huguenot leadership. Coligny was among those killed, his body thrown out of the window of his lodgings and burned by the crowd. As other Huguenots were cut down, the Catholic Parisians joined in the bloodbath, slaughtering their Huguenot neighbours. Marguerite and her husband both made it to safety at the Louvre Palace, where they were protected by royal troops. Henri’s friends and attendants were not so lucky and were butchered within earshot of the newlyweds. As the violence spread to more cities in the following days and weeks, over 5,000 were killed.\n\nThe leadership of the Huguenot faction had been dealt a serious blow. The older leaders were dead, murdered, and the younger leaders, Henri of Navarre and his cousin, Henri de Condé, were virtual prisoners, confined to the royal court and on 26 September 1572, Henri of Navarre renounced Protestantism. Four years later, he finally managed to flee the court, leaving his wife behind. Returning to the Protestant faith, he was now twenty-two and assumed the leadership of the Huguenots. Marguerite had remained at the French court following her husband’s flight. There’s was a rather liberal marriage, with neither one concerned if the other took lovers. Politically though, Marguerite worked in support of her husband, despite him being a Protestant and she being Catholic.\n\nIn 1578, Marguerite and her mother made a journey south, with Catherine de Medici hoping to build some bridges with the king of Navarre by delivering his wife to him. For the next five years, until 1583, Marguerite and Henri lived as husband and wife at Nérac, 100km south-east of Bordeaux. Initially, the marriage appeared to be experiencing a revival, but then Henri had an affair with on of Marguerite’s ladies, known as La Fosseuse, before moving onto a more serious relationship with Corisande de’Andouins, Countess of Guiche. In 1582 Henri III, King of France, summoned Marguerite back to court, with the hope that her husband would follow. Marguerite came but Henri did not.\n\nWhile back at the French court, Marguerite had an affair with Jacques de Harlay, Sieur de Champvallon, and there were rumours that she was pregnant by him. Marguerite was ordered to leave court by her brother and left Paris on 8 August. As she travelled south, her party was stopped by a troop of royal archers, who insulted Marguerite and arrested two of her ladies. They were questioned about Marguerite’s baby, if there was one. All trace of the child, whether she was pregnant or not, had disappeared. On 13 April, Marguerite was reunited with her husband at Port St Marie, just north of Nérac. Just two months later, they heard of the death of Marguerite’s youngest brother, Francis, Duke of Anjou, who was a close ally of Henri of Navarre.\n\nFrancis’s death was a pivotal moment for the king of Navarre. He had been the heir of his brother Henri III and now, the heir was Henri of Navarre himself, at least until Henri III were to have a son of his own. The Holy Catholic League, however, funded by the king of Spain and the papacy, recognised the ageing and childless Cardinal de Bourbon as the heir to the throne. On 31 March 1585, the cardinal issued a proclamation promising to restore France to Catholicism and declaring that ‘subjects are not required to recognise or sustain the domination of a prince who has parted from the Catholic faith…’ On 9 September 1585 Pope Sixtus V excommunicated both Henri of Navarre and his cousin Condé – even though they were Protestants – and deprived them of their hereditary rights. He even declared that Henri had no right to the kingdom of Navarre. Henry of Guise was manoeuvring to promote his own candidacy for the throne of France by excluding Henri of Navarre.\n\nAfter the death of his brother Francis, Henri III was forced to make war on Navarre by Henry of Guise, thus starting the War of the Three Henries. It was at this point that Marguerite took her life and future into her own hands. Having realised that she could not be content living with Henri, she left his court and moved to Agen, claiming she wanted to devote herself to the celebration of Easter. She joined the Holy Catholic League and with 2,000 soldiers she took Agen and held it in the name of the League. But after a bout of plague was seen as the punishment of God for Marguerite rebelling against her husband and brother, and the destruction of the garrison gunpowder left the city indefensible, she was forced to abandon Agen and moved further inland to another of her fortresses at Carlat.\n\nAs she left for Carlat, Marguerite was arrested by her brother’s forces under the command of the Marquis de Canillac, who escorted her to the great fortress at Usson. Marguerite charmed Canillac and within a year she was no longer a prisoner, but the sovereign lady of the territory, in the heart of the Auvergne. Marguerite spent the next 19 years living in Usson, as the Wars of Religion ground to their conclusion with a succession of deaths. The duke of Guise died in 1588, killed on the king’s orders. Catherine de Medici died in January 1589, just a few months before her 70th birthday. And in August 1589, King Henri III was assassinated by a Catholic enthusiast.\n\nThis left Henri of Navarre as the victor, though the war continued for 4 more years, as the Catholic League refused to accept a Protestant king. In 1593 Henri’s conversion to Catholicism, supposedly with the words ‘Paris is worth a Mass,’ Henri of Navarre became King Henri IV of France, his coronation taking place in Chartres Cathedral in February 1594. The Edict of Nantes finally ended the Wars of Religion in 1598, establishing Catholicism as the state religion in France, but allowing Huguenots to worship freely in many parts of France (excluding Paris). Though she was no longer living with Henri, Marguerite, the last surviving child of Henri II and Catherine de Medici, was now Queen of France and Navarre, and she and Henri were back on good terms. She established her court at Usson, writing her memoirs and poetry and building a library.\n\nIn 1593 Marguerite made an agreement with Henri whereby he would give her 50,000 francs a year and pay her debts of 200,000 écus in return for her applying for the annulment of their marriage; she cited her barrenness, consanguinity and that she was forced to marry against her will as grounds for the annulment. Though the annulment was not granted by the pope until 1599, it did eventually leave Henri free to marry again, to Marie de Medici, and produce the all-important heir – the future King Louis XIII. Although she had been a pawn to the political manoeuvrings of her mother on her marriage to Henri of Navarre, Marguerite had, to all intents and purposes, managed to forge her own path in her later years. Her agreement to the annulment of her marriage meant the continuation of the line of Henri IV and secured the future of France. Marguerite returned to Paris in 1605 and lived there until her death in 1615.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n1.

Rozsa is here to share with you why Margaret is important to history as a founding figure of European coalition politics.\n\nOver to Rozsa….\n\nMargaret knew, or was related to, most of early 16th century Europe’s rulers.\n\nHer action-packed childhood prepared her for a lifetime of leadership as ruler of the Burgundian-Habsburg Netherlands, and as one of the most important treaty negotiators of her era.\n\nLet’s look at the players in Margaret of Austria’s life:\n\nMaximilian I, archduke of Austria and the future Holy Roman Emperor – was Margaret’s father.\n\nCharles V –future King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor, is her nephew and ward. Margaret was Charles V’s legal guardian until he was 15 years old.\n\nHenry VIII of England –Margaret’s trade partner. English sheep provided the wool for Flanders’ cloth industry. Flanders, in the Low Countries, was world renown from the 12th century on for its fine cloth textiles and its tapestries, which were sought after the world over as a display of wealth and power.\n\nCatherine of Aragon, Henry VIII’s queen – was Margaret’s former sister-in-law.\n\nAnne Boleyn, Henry VIII’s 2nd queen -maid-of-honor at Margaret’s Court of Savoy in Mechelen (Malines) in the Burgundian-Habsburg Low Countries (now Belgium).\n\nPhilip the Handsome, Duke of Burgundy –was Margaret’s brother.\n\nJuana the Mad – the daughter of Isabella and Ferdinand of Spain was Philip’s wife and Margaret’s sister-in-law.\n\nIsabella and Ferdinand of Spain – Margaret’s former in-laws.\n\nLouise of Savoy – former sister-in-law & the mother of Francis the First, King of France, Louise was the power behind the throne during her son’s reign.\n\nMargaret of Austria was born in 1480 in Brussels, the only daughter of the heads of two of Europe’s top dynastic houses: the House of Burgundy and the House of Habsburg. Her mother, Mary of Burgundy, was ruler of Burgundy, the only child of Burgundy’s last duke. She was known throughout Europe as Mary the Rich.\n\nMargaret’s father was Maximilian the First of Austria, head of the House of Habsburg and later to become Holy Roman Emperor. Mary and Maximilian’s dramatic love story is told in the 2017 Starz Mini Series Maximilian. Well worth viewing.\n\nMargaret lost her mother in a riding accident at age two. One year later her father contracted with the French king, Louis the Eleventh, known as the Spider King, to marry Margaret to Louis’ son and heir, the future Charles VIII of France. Margaret was sent to France at age 3 to be raised at the French court to prepare her to become Queen of France one day.\n\nMargaret’s statue towers over the main market square of Mechelen (pronounced “Meh ku luhn”) Belgium, 18 miles, or 29 kilometers, north of Brussels. Erected in 1849, it was made by sculptor Joseph Tuerlinckx.\n\nHer palace in Mechelen is called the Court of Savoy. It was the first Renaissance palace built in the Low Countries and is a main tourist destination. The Low Countries are now known as the Benelux countries: Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.\n\nMargaret held one of Europe’s most important Renaissance courts at her Court of Savoy for the duration of her career from 1507-1530 as ruler of the Burgundian-Habsburg Netherlands.\n\nHere is Margaret’s palace, the Court of Savoy, in Mechelen, Belgium. Despite her title, Margaret of Austria hailed from what is now called Belgium, a country that was created in 1830, 300 years after she died.\n\nIn the 16th century the northern part of Belgium was known as Flanders, a Low Countries province within the realm of Burgundy. Everything in orange on this map is Burgundy. Burgundy now no longer exists, but it was the wealthiest realm in Europe in the 14th to late 15th centuries.\n\nMargaret’s native tongue was French. She ruled the Burgundian-Habsburg Netherlands for 23 years, with the exception of two years, from 1515-1517. During those two years, her nephew and ward, Charles the Fifth, came of age, and typical of a teenage boy, he wanted to take control of his realm for himself.\n\nBut after two years of seeing how difficult it was to manage the Netherlands’ 17 different provinces all with conflicting economic interests, he handed back control to his aunt Margaret, who was a master at negotiating trade agreements and at putting together coalitions for the greater good of the Netherlands’ economic prosperity.\n\nMargaret was confident, self-possessed, well-organized, and enjoyed being in charge. She did not show her hand. An excellent bluffer at both diplomatic negotiations and the gaming table, she played cards and gambled with heads of state and diplomats to the Low Countries who were sent to her Court of Savoy in Mechelen.\n\nMargaret’s travels by the age of twenty-seven made her one of Europe’s most cosmopolitan princesses.\n\nJan. 10, 1480 – Margaret of Austria is born in Brussels.\n\nAge 3 – She’s sent to France to be raised under Anne of France or Anne de Beaujeu to become its queen one day.\n\nAge 11 –Margaret is jilted by Charles VIII of France, who marries Anne of Brittany instead.\n\nAge 13- Margaret returns to Flanders in the Low Countries and waits for her father to make another match for her.\n\nAge 17 – Margaret goes to Spain to marry Isabella and Ferdinand’s son Juan, heir to the Spanish throne. But – he dies six months after they marry.\n\nAges 19-21 – Back in Flanders in the Low Countries, Margaret awaits her father’s next marriage choice for her.\n\nAge 21 – Margaret moves to Savoy when luck arrives with her marriage to Philibert, Duke of Savoy, a childhood friend who becomes the love of her life.\n\nAge 24 – Luck departs when Philibert dies.\n\nAge 26 – Margaret’s life changes completely when her brother, Philip the Handsome, Duke of Burgundy, dies in Spain, possibly of poisoning, and Margaret takes over rulership of the Burgundian-Habsburg Netherlands. She also takes over guardianship of Philip’s children, the future Charles the Fifth and his three sisters, all Habsburg royals who live in Brussels, and are now functionally orphaned, as their father has died and their mother, Juana of Castile, has gone insane and remains in Spain.\n\nAges 27-50 – Margaret lives in Mechelen where she rules the Netherlands and conducts her government from her palace, the Court of Savoy.\n\nAge 50 – Margaret dies. Two years later her body is transported to Brou, France, where she is buried next to her beloved 2nd husband Philibert of Savoy. Savoy was a region between France, Switzerland and the duchy of Milan, which was very strategic in the 16th century because it controlled the pass through the Alps for French soldiers to march to Milan. At that time in history all the great European powers were interested in gaining a piece of Italy.\n\nMargaret lived just at the moment that the feudal age gave way to the Renaissance.\n\nStuck at the French court for two years after being jilted by the French king, an unexpected friendship formed between Margaret and Anne of Brittany, who was three years older and who took her place as Queen of France.\n\nInstead of hating each other, Margaret and Anne were both politically astute enough to recognize that they were pawns in the hands of the French. They became lifelong friends and wrote to each other until Anne of Brittany’s death. They sent scholars to serve at each other’s courts and were both instrumental in bringing Renaissance art and humanist learning to their respective courts of Burgundy and France.\n\nAfter returning to the Low Countries from France at age 13, Margaret’s father Maximilian arranges a match for her with Isabella and Ferdinand of Spain’s son and heir, Juan. Maximilian also arranges for Margaret’s older brother Philip, Duke of Burgundy, to marry Juan’s sister, Juana, known to history as Juana the Mad. At age 17 Margaret is on track to become Queen of Spain. But after only 6 months of marriage her 19-year-old husband dies. 6 months later Margaret gives birth to their child, a stillborn daughter. She never has another child.\n\nMargaret spends the year after Juan’s death at Isabella and Ferdinand’s Alhambra Palace in Granada, teaching French to their youngest daughter Catherine of Aragon, future Queen of England.\n\nQueen Isabella of Spain is a huge influence on Margaret, who spends two years observing her ruling her kingdom as well as managing her husband Ferdinand, whose kingdom of Aragon is much smaller than Isabella’s kingdom of Castile.\n\nMargaret and Catherine of Aragon remained lifelong friends.\n\nAt age 19 Margaret leaves Spain and returns to the Low Countries to await her father’s next marriage choice for her. Margaret’s 2nd husband, Philibert, Duke of Savoy, was a childhood friend from Amboise, where he also grew up at the French court with his sister Louise of Savoy. The same age as Margaret, he and she fell madly in love.\n\nBut Philibert was not interested in ruling Savoy and had left it to his illegitimate half brother to manage. Soon after Margaret arrived, she ousted his half brother and took over ruling Savoy herself. Philibert was not a natural-born leader, but an excellent athlete and hunter, very good-looking with a faithful heart. He was happy for Margaret to take the reins and he supported her leadership.\n\nBut at age 24, Philibert went out hunting on a hot day and developed a lung inflammation after drinking ice cold water from a mountain stream. He died 9 days later. Margaret remained in Savoy as Duchess and ruler for two more years, devoting herself to building a church to honor Philibert, and where she intended to be buried with him.\n\nMargaret’s church at Brou is a masterpiece of flamboyant Gothic architecture. It’s a must-see for visitors to the Geneva-Lyon area. Commissioned by her in 1506 it took 26 years to build. Margaret is buried there with her husband Philibert and his mother, Margaret of Bourbon, who was from the same Bourbon or Bourbon dynasty that rules Spain today with King Felipe of Spain at its head.\n\nThe Church and Royal Monastery at Brou is 69 miles west of Geneva and 50 miles north of Lyon. Author of the foreword to my book on Margaret of Austria, Austrian archduke Géza von Habsburg has visited and says that the restaurant "
