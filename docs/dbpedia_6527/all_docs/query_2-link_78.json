        "text": "Case Study: The Wars of Religion?\n\nIntroduction\n\nReligious conflicts inevitably merged with and exacerbated long-standing political tensions between the monarchies and nobility across Europe, dramatically escalating these conflicts as they spread from the Holy Roman Empire to France, the Netherlands, and England. Economic issues such as the power to tax and control ecclesiastical resources further heightened these clashes. All three motivations - religion, political, and economic - contributed to the brutal and destructive violence that raged through Europe.\n\nDirections: Using evidence from your textbook and research on the internet create an argument that proves that the religious violence of the 16th century was in fact a result of political discord. Describe specific details to support your argument and your opinion of the evidence.\n\n1585-89 – Wars of the Three Henrys:\n\n1585 – Henry III bans Protestantism with the Treaty of Nemoours\n\n1588 – Henry III forced to surrender to the militant Catholic Guise Family and the Catholic League. Henry signs the Edict of Union which places Henri de Guise in charge of all troops and declares it illegal for a non-Catholic to be ruler of France. In December Henry III arranges the assassination Of Henri de Guise and also of his brother, Cardinal Louis de Guise who was also the archbishop of Reims.\n\n1589 – Henry III allies with the Huguenots and, unsuccessfully, lays siege to Holy League-controlled Paris. Later that summer Henry III himself is assassinated and names Henri of Navarre his successor.\n\n1593 – Henry IV converts to Catholicism, is crowned the following year in Chartres. and enters unapposed into Paris.\n\n1595-98: War between Henry IV and the Catholic League + Spain:\n\n1595 – Henry IV declares war on the Catholic League’s allies, Spain.\n\n1598 – May: War with Spain ends through the Peace of Vervins.\n\nApril: Henry IV signs the Edict of Nantes which, to a large extent, ends the French Wars of Religion.\n\n1629 – The Peace of Alais or the Edict of Grace formally ends the French Wars of Religion. It was negotiated by Cardinal Richelieu and Huguenot leaders. It was similar to the Edict of Nantes but took away some Protestant rights while granting them amnesty and guaranteeing tolerance for their religious practices.\n\n………………………..\n\n​\n\n1685 – Revocation of the Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV (Protestant persecution, which had occurred during Louis XIV’s reign, now intensifies)."
