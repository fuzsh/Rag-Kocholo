        "text": "Mary, Queen of Scots had been married to Francis II, King of France until his death in 1560 so the French were supporters of Mary and her claim to the English throne. One reason why Elizabeth was hesitant about executing Mary was the fear of possible French retaliation.\n\nCivil war broke out in France in 1562 between CatholicThe Church in Western Europe before the Reformation. The Pope was head of the Church. A member of the Roman Catholic Church. and ProtestantChristians who broke away from the Roman Catholic Church during the Reformation. They believe in the teachings of the Bible but reject the authority of the Pope.. This war lasted until 1598. It was not in the interest of the French king to wage war against England and so the two kingdoms maintained good relations during this period. The execution of Mary in 1587 did not have a negative effect on relations between France and England."
