        "text": "” The direct political influence of the Reformation effected less than has been supposed. Most States were strong enough to control it. Some, by intense exertion, shut out the pouring flood. Others, with consummate skill, diverted it to their own uses. The Polish Government alone at that time left it to its course. Scotland was the only kingdom in which the Reformation triumphed over the resistance of the State; and Ireland was the only instance where it failed, in spite of Government support. But in almost every other case, both the princes that spread their canvas to the gale and those that faced it, employed the zeal, the alarm, the passions it aroused as instruments for the increase of power. Nations eagerly invested their rulers with every prerogative needed to preserve their faith, and all the care to keep Church and State asunder, and to prevent the confusion of their powers, which had been the work of ages, was renounced in the intensity of the crisis. Atrocious deeds were done, in which religious passion was often the instrument, but policy was the motive.\n\nFanaticism displays itself in the masses, but the masses were rarely fanaticised, and the crimes ascribed to it were commonly due to the calculations of dispassionate politicians. When the King of France undertook to kill all the Protestants, he was obliged to do it by his own agents. It was nowhere the spontaneous act of the population, and in many towns and in entire provinces the magistrates refused to obey. The motive of the Court was so far from mere fanaticism that the Queen immediately challenged Elizabeth to do the like to the English Catholics. Francis I. and Henry II. sent nearly a hundred Huguenots to the stake, but they were cordial and assiduous promoters of the Protestant religion in Germany. Sir Nicholas Bacon was one of the ministers who suppressed the mass in England. Yet when the Huguenot refugees came over he liked them so little that he reminded Parliament of the summary way in which Henry V. at Agincourt dealt with the Frenchmen who fell into his hands. John Knox thought that every Catholic in Scotland ought to be put to death, and no man ever had disciples of a sterner or more relentless temper. But his counsel was not followed.\n\nAll through the religious conflict policy kept the upper hand. When the last of the Reformers died, religion, instead of emancipating the nations, had become an excuse for the criminal art of despots. Calvin preached and Bellarmine lectured, but Machiavelli reigned.”\n\nhttp://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/acton-the-history-of-freedom-in-christianity\n\nWhile I agree with you that the world would be a better and more peaceful place for the application of marginal thinking to issues of religion, that’s certainly not the way it worked in the early modern era. To dismiss the whole Reformation project as a lame failure to engage in marginal thinking is a mistake, and one that fails to understand the importance the ideas that were being debated had in their time. The Reformation–for the people living through it and for many believers today–was not a debate between the “slightly more correct” and the “slightly less correct.” It wasn’t even about scalping tickets to heaven or about licentious priests (though certainly they were frequently mentioned as evidence of the problems with the Church of the time.) The Reformation project was a battle between truth and error that would determine whether you spent eternity in heaven or burning in hell. And given that, at the time, it was unthinkable that the sovereign would not have the power to determine the religious practices (and thus the state of the soul) of his subjects, it was vitally important that one’s sovereign choose truth over error.\n\nPeople didn’t die fighting about these matters because they were too stubborn to debate. They died because many of them thought it would be preferable to die fighting for their version of the truth than go to hell for quietly accepting falsehood. You can dislike it, and you can wish they had behaved in a more Enlightenment fashion, but that’s not going to get you closer to understanding what was happening.\n\nI also think you underrate the importance for the Reformation push to put Scripture into the language of the people and into the hands of the people. From that push, we rapidly move to great leaps in freedoms of the press and of expression, and to a more democratized education, a more literate populace, and the vibrant exchange of ideas in writing across national boarders.\n\nPerhaps just to play devil’s advocate, I’ll question the inevitablility of the Reformation (or the idea that it was ‘a long time coming’ rather than the result of huge policy failures during the early 16th century).\n\nPope Leo X, who ironically was likely irreligious, played a big role in causing the Reformation by amping up the sale of indulgences to cover the church’s abysmal finances, caused both by his and his predecessors’ grotesque financial mismanagement. Additionally, Clement and his cousin (the later Pope Clement VII) refused to address the early Reformation largely for political reasons. For example, Clement refused to annul Henry VIII’s marriage not for doctrinal reasons, but because Henry was married to the aunt of the Holy Roman Emperor, who Clement was afraid to offend.\n\nThese two Popes, it is worth noting, were Medici, and used the papacy unabashedly to further Medici interests, and beyond just the same old corruption, actually badly exacerbated corruption in the Church.\n\nIt is possible that had the prelates just taken modest efforts to eschew the aspiration for temporal power and better handle their finances (the Church had considerable incomes from many lands across Europe, it had no need for simony whatsoever) to reduce the incentives for corruption, it is possible the revolts of Luther and Calvin wouldn’t have been so lasting.\n\nIn any case, I’ll end by adding that Friedrich Nietzsche thought the principle ideological impact of the Reformation was to demolish the laxity of Renaissance humanism and induce fanaticism on both sides, which was why he thoroughly despised Martin Luther.\n\nThere had been many reformations going back centuries and the Catholic Church came out of them much the better. Erasmus ignited the one we celebrate and warned people that an open break with the church would cause massive bloodshed. He encouraged people to practice their faith at home and give lip service to the church. And they did.\n\nBut when Luther made his stand the church had gained too much political power and refused to reform as it had in the past. Very sad. The Inquisition and the religious wars were the church trying to murder all Protestants through the power of the state. But that was also a period of divine right of kings where every monarch took offense at the slightest disagreement and felt the right to kill anyone they didn’t like. In the Netherlands the King of Spain said he would rather rule over trees and rocks than have one Protestant in his kingdom and he almost succeeded.\n\nThe real lesson of the Reformation is the danger of a Church/State alliance. The Reformation was good for the Catholic church because it got rid of a lot of false teaching and corruption.\n\nThe principles of capitalism came from Catholic theologians at the University of Salamanca, Spain at the same time as the Reformation. They were probably influenced by the freedom of thought of the Reformers. But only Protestant nations embraced those principles, the Dutch Republic first and then England. The Dutch caused the inflection in the hockey stick of per capita GDP growth. Spain never followed and France followed only in the 19th century.\n\nThe Catholic Church rejected the free market wisdom of its greatest scholars at Salamanca and helped keep most of Europe in poverty for centuries. Without the Reformation it’s likely that those principles would have died in Salamanca and we would still be living in 16th century poverty and starvation.\n\nReligion the cause of division? Division and war are a human tribalist trait. Anthropologists and historians have no problem finding war and division wherever they turn their serious attention. Europe had constant wars before and after the reformation.\n\nConsider European history back to the conquests and fall of the Roman Empire. There were huge Europeans migrations and tribals wars during the first millennium. Just a small example–the Celts get mashed, bashed and pushed from their origins in the Alps to Ireland. Violence and war push global trade off the Silk Road to sea routes around Africa and to the new world.\n\nThe Reconquest of Spain was filled with terrible political violence, often on the pretext of religion. It’s not the religious divisions that endure. It’s the political divisions– Catalonia’s split to independence is all about its pre-Roman language and tribal roots. Catalonia and Basque country are hardly alone with their deep tribal split–look at the history of the English isles, Gaul, the Italian peninsula and the German heartland–filled with war and division, particularly in the 15th century.\n\nThe point? Tribal leaders love division and warfare. It’s a rare and not a secular voice that cries, “love thy neighbor as thyself.”\n\nReligion the cause of division?

It led to the creation of the global financial system.\n\nLuther’s Reformation led to John Calvin. Prior to Calvin, under Canonical law, Christians were forbidden from charging interest on a loan. Of course, this was a prohibition honored more in the breach than in the observation (i.e., the Lombards, the Medici), but the social and legal stigma still existed — particularly after Jewish financiers (which were excluded from the Canonical prohibitions, since they weren’t Christians) were expelled from various places (England in 1290, Spain in 1492, Portugal in 1496). Calvin reinterpreted the Biblical injunction against “usury” to be a prohibition on charging excess interest on loans to the poor. Since this gave religious support to what everyone already wanted to do, it was widely accepted and legal protections for money lending arose in Switzerland.\n\nAnd Zurich is still a global financial center 450 years later.\n\nAlso, the Reformation led to the Counter-Reformation. Protestant and Jewish financiers in Belgium, Portugal, France, etc. were driven out of these countries by Spanish invaders. Many fled to Protestant London and Amsterdam. They made this move at a critical point in history, when both the Dutch and the English decided to engage in the colonization game, but didn’t want to spend royal funds in doing so. This led to the Dutch East Indies Company and the English East Indies Company — two of the first “joint-stock” companies where capital, profits and risk were shared among shareholders. Pulling these enterprises off required the financing infrastructure that these refugee Jewish and Protestant financiers were able to bring to the table.\n\nAnd London and Amsterdam both remain financial centers today, more than 400 years later. (Along with Hong Kong, which was ported over by the British.)\n\nSo, yeah. Without the Reformation, the wars wouldn’t have been so nasty. But also no modern corporations, no modern finance, possibly no Industrial Revolution and no modern capitalism.\n\nSo let’s recast this using the obvious modern parallel:\n\nRadical (not all, just the part which wants to take over the rest of us) Islam vs. the rest of us.\n\nSure, they’re harsh and by comparison to most western countries not very liberal in the classical freedom-loving/civil-rights granting sense, but is imposition of extreme Islamic beliefs and Sharia law so bad that we’re willing to continue a war across much of the world in order to fight against it?\n\nHow many are willing to advocate for not fighting them and just accepting putting women’s rights back a little bit and so on, i.e. just allowing them to win out right away and save us all the future bloodshed, war and terrorism?\n\nEventually, everyone’s religious descendants may succumb to apathy, after all.\n\nI’m not willing to just turn the world over to them just because they’re willing to use violence to attempt to convert people’s and nations, but it’s a serious question for those who think the Protestants should’ve just dropped their principles and waited for Catholic apathy.\n\nPersonally, some ideals are worth fighting for and giving some people what they want instead of fighting them is more likely to result in them (and others) wanting you to give them more, rather than them going away satisfied forever. When you pay the Danegeld, it may be better in the short run, but you rarely get rid of the Dane that way."
