        "text": "Neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City\n\nBattery Park City is a mainly residential 92-acre (37 ha) planned community and neighborhood on the west side of the southern tip of the island of Manhattan in New York City.[3] It is bounded by the Hudson River on the west, the Hudson River shoreline on the north and south, and the West Side Highway on the east.[4] The neighborhood is named for the Battery, formerly known as Battery Park, located directly to the south.\n\nMore than one-third of the development is parkland.[5] The land upon which it is built was created in the 1970s by land reclamation on the Hudson River using over 3 million cubic yards (2.3 million cubic meters) of soil and rock excavated during the construction of the World Trade Center,[6] the New York City Water Tunnel, and certain other construction projects, as well as from sand dredged from New York Harbor off Staten Island.[7][8] The neighborhood includes Brookfield Place (formerly the World Financial Center), along with numerous buildings designed for housing, commercial, and retail.\n\nBattery Park City is part of Manhattan Community District 1.[1] It is patrolled by the 1st Precinct of the New York City Police Department.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nBattery Park City is bounded on the east by West Street, which separates the area from the Financial District of Lower Manhattan. To the west, north, and south, the area is surrounded by the Hudson River.[4]\n\nThe development consists of roughly five major sections. Traveling north to south, the first neighborhood has high-rise residential buildings, the Stuyvesant High School, a Regal Entertainment Group movie theater, and the Battery Park City branch of the New York Public Library.[7] It is also the site of the 463-suite Conrad New York luxury hotel, which has a ballroom and a conference center.[9][10] Other restaurants located in that hotel, as well as a DSW store and a New York Sports Club branch, were closed in 2009 after the takeover of the property by Goldman Sachs. Former undeveloped lots in the area have been developed into high-rise buildings; for example, Goldman Sachs built a new headquarters at 200 West Street.\n\nNearby is Brookfield Place, a complex of several commercial buildings formerly known as the World Financial Center.\n\nCurrent residential neighborhoods of Battery Park City are divided into northern and southern sections, separated by Brookfield Place. The northern section consists entirely of large, 20–45-story buildings, all various shades of orange brick. The southern section, extending down from the Winter Garden, which is located in Brookfield Place, contains residential apartment buildings such as Gateway Plaza and the Rector Place apartment buildings. In this section lies the majority of Battery Park City's residential areas, in three sections: Gateway Plaza, a high-rise building complex; the \"Rector Place Residential Neighborhood\"; and the\" Battery Place Residential Neighborhood\". These subsections contain most of the area's residential buildings, along with park space, supermarkets, restaurants, and movie theaters. Construction of residential buildings began north of the World Financial Center in the late 1990s, and completion of the final lots took place in early 2011. Additionally, a park restoration was completed in 2013.[11]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSite and formation\n\n[edit]\n\nThroughout the 19th century and early-20th century, the area adjoining today's Battery Park City was known as Little Syria with Lebanese, Greeks, Armenians, and other ethnic groups. In 1929, the land was the proposed site of a $50 million (equivalent to $890 million in 2023) residential development that would have served workers in the Wall Street area.[12] The Battery Tower project was left unfinished after workers digging the foundation ran into forty feet of old bulkheads, sunken docks, and ships.[13]\n\nBy the late-1950s, the once-prosperous port area of downtown Manhattan was occupied by a number of dilapidated shipping piers, casualties of the rise of container shipping which drove sea traffic to Port Elizabeth, New Jersey.[6] The initial proposal to reclaim this area through landfill was offered in the early-1960s by private firms and supported by the mayor, part of a long history of Lower Manhattan expansion.[4][6] That plan became complicated when Governor Nelson Rockefeller announced his desire to redevelop a part of the area as a separate project. The various groups reached a compromise, and in 1966 the governor unveiled the proposal for what would become Battery Park City. The creation of architect Wallace K. Harrison, the proposal called for a 'comprehensive community' consisting of housing, social infrastructure and light industry.[6]\n\nIn 1968, the New York State Legislature created the Battery Park City Authority (BPCA) to oversee development.[6][14] Rockefeller named Charles J. Urstadt as the first chairman of the authority's board that year. He then served as the chief executive officer from 1973 to 1978. Urstadt later served as the authority's vice chair from 1996 to 2010.[15] The New York State Urban Development Corporation and ten other public agencies were also involved in the development project.[16] For the next several years, the BPCA made slow progress. In April 1969, it unveiled a master plan for the area,[17] which was approved in October.[18] In early-1972, the BPCA issued $200 million in bonds to fund construction efforts,[19] with Harry B. Helmsley designated as the developer.[20] That same year, the city approved plans to alter the number of apartments designated for lower, middle and upper income renters. Urstadt said the changes were needed to make the financing for the project viable. In addition to the change in the mix of units, the city approved adding nine acres, which extended the northern boundary from Reade Street to Duane Street.[21]\n\nLandfill material from construction of the World Trade Center and other buildings in Lower Manhattan was used to add fill for the southern portion.[6][14][7] Cellular cofferdams were constructed to retain the material.[22] After removal of the piers, wooden piles and overburden of silt, the northern portion (north of, and including the marina) was filled with sand dredged from areas adjacent to Ambrose Channel in the Atlantic Ocean, as well as stone from the construction of Water Tunnel #3.[22] By 1976, the landfill was completed. Seating stands for viewing the American Bicentennial \"Operation Sail\" flotilla parade were set up on the completed landfill in July 1976.[23] Construction efforts ground to a halt in 1977, as a result of the city's fiscal crisis.[24] That year, the presidential administration of Jimmy Carter approved mortgage insurance for 1,600 of the development's proposed units.[25] In 1979, the title to the landfill was transferred from the city to the Battery Park City Authority, which financially restructured itself and created a new, more viable master plan, designed by Alex Cooper of Cooper, Robertson & Partners and Stanton Eckstut.[26] By that time, only two of the proposed development's buildings had been built, and the $200 million bond issue was supposed to have been paid off the next year.[27]\n\nThe design of BPC to some degree reflects the values of vibrant city neighborhoods championed by Jane Jacobs. The Urban Land Institute (ULI) awarded the Battery Park City Master Plan its 2010 Heritage Award, for having \"facilitated the private development of 9.3 million square feet (860 thousand square meters) of commercial space, 7.2 million square feet (670 thousand square meters) of residential space, and nearly 36 acres (15 ha) of open space in lower Manhattan, becoming a model for successful large-scale planning efforts and marking a positive shift away from the urban renewal mindset of the time.\"[28]\n\nConstruction and early development\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the late-1970s and early-1980s, the site hosted Creative Time's landmark Art on the Beach sculpture exhibitions.[29] On September 23, 1979, the landfill was the site of an anti-nuclear rally attended by 200,000 people.[30]\n\nConstruction began on the first residential building in June 1980.[4][31][14] In April 1981, the New York State Urban Development Corporation (now the Empire State Development Corporation) issued a request for proposal, ultimately selecting six real-estate companies to develop over 1,800 residential units.[32] The same year, the World Financial Center started construction; Olympia and York of Toronto was named as the developer for the World Financial Center, who then hired Cesar Pelli as the lead architect. By 1985, construction was completed and the World Financial Center (later renamed Brookfield Place New York)[14] saw its first tenants.[33] The newly completed development was lauded by The New York Times as \"a triumph of urban design\",[34] with the World Financial Center being deemed \"a symbol of change\".[33]\n\nDuring early construction, two acres of land in the southern section of the Battery Park landfill was used by artist Agnes Denes to plant wheat in an exhibition titled Wheatfield – A Confrontation.[35] The project was a visual contradiction: a golden field of wheat set among the steel skyscrapers of downtown Manhattan.[36] It was created during a six-month period in the spring, summer, and fall of 1982 when Denes, with the support of the Public Art Fund, planted the field of wheat on rubble-strewn land near Wall Street and the World Trade Center site. Denes stated that her \"decision to plant a wheatfield in Manhattan, instead of designing just another public sculpture, grew out of a long-standing concern and need to call attention to our misplaced priorities and deteriorating human values.\"[37]\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the BPCA oversaw a great deal of construction, including the entire Rector Place neighborhood and the river esplanade. It was during that period that Amanda Burden, later City Planning Department Director in the Bloomberg administration, worked on Battery Park City. During the 1980s, a total of 13 buildings were constructed. The Vietnam Veterans Plaza was established by Edward I. Koch in 1985.[38] Constructed at a cost of $150 million (equivalent to $330 million in 2023) and with a capacity for 2,700 students, Battery Park City became the new home of the Stuyvesant High School in 1992.[39] During the 1990s, an additional six buildings were added to the neighborhood. By the turn of the 21st century, Battery Park City was mostly completed, with the exception of some ongoing construction on West Street.\n\nInitially, in the 1980s, 23 buildings were built in the area. By the 1990s, 9 more buildings were built, followed by the construction of 11 buildings in the 2000s and 3 buildings in the 2010s.[40] The Battery Park City Authority, wishing to attract more middle-class residents, started providing subsidies in 1998 to households whose annual incomes were $108,000 or less.[41] By the end of the decade, nearly the entire landfill had been developed.[42]\n\nEarly 21st century\n\n[edit]\n\nThe September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 had a major impact on Battery Park City.[6] The residents of Lower Manhattan and particularly of Battery Park City were displaced for an extended period of time. Parts of the community were an official crime scene and therefore residents were unable to return to live or even collect property. Many of the displaced residents were not allowed to return to the area for months and none were given government guidance of where to live temporarily on the already-crowded island of Manhattan. With most hotel rooms booked, residents, including young children and the elderly, were forced to fend for themselves. When they were finally allowed to return to Battery Park City, some found that their homes had been looted.[43]\n\nUpon residents' return, the air in the area was still filled with toxic smoke from the World Trade Center fires that persisted until December 2001.[44] More than half of the area's residents moved away permanently from the community after the adjacent World Trade Center towers collapsed and spread toxic dust, debris, and smoke. Gateway Plaza's 600 building, Hudson View East, and Parc Place (now Rector Square) were punctured by airplane parts. The Winter Garden and other portions of the World Financial Center were severely damaged. Environmental concerns regarding dust from the Trade Center are a continuing source of concern for many residents, scientists, and elected officials. Since the attacks, the damage has been repaired. Temporarily reduced rents and government subsidies helped restore residential occupancy in the years following the attacks.\n\nAfter September 11, 2001, residents of Battery Park City and Tribeca formed the TriBattery Pops Tom Goodkind Conductor in response to the events of the attacks. The \"Pops\" have been Grammy-nominated and are the first lower Manhattan all-volunteer community band in a century.\n\nSince then, real estate development in the area has continued robustly. Commercial development includes the 2,100,000-square-foot (200,000 m2) 200 West Street, the Goldman Sachs global headquarters, which began construction in 2005 and opened for occupancy in October 2009.[45] 200 West Street received in 2010 gold-level certification under the United States Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program by incorporating various water and energy conservation features.[46][47] As of 2018, there is no new construction planned.[14]\n\nOwnership and maintenance\n\n[edit]\n\nBattery Park City is owned and managed by the Hugh L. Carey Battery Park City Authority (BPCA), a Class A New York State public-benefit corporation created by New York State in 1968 to redevelop outmoded and deteriorated piers, a project that has involved reclaiming the land, replanning the area and facilitating new construction of a mixed commercial and residential community.[3][48] It has operated under the authority of the Urban Development Corporation.[49] Its mission is \"to plan, create, coordinate and sustain a balanced community of commercial, residential, retail, and park space within its designated 92-acre site on the lower west side of Manhattan\".[50] The authority's board is composed of seven uncompensated members who are appointed by the governor and who serve six-year terms.[51] Raju Mann is the president and chief executive officer.[52] The BPCA is invested with substantial powers: it can acquire, hold and dispose of real property, enter into lease agreements, borrow money and issue debt, and manage the project.[53] Like other public benefit corporations, the BPCA is exempt from property taxes and has the ability to issue tax exempt bonds.[54] In 2021, the BPCA has operating expenses of $69.1 million as well as an outstanding debt of $875.09 million, and it employed 200 people.[55][56]\n\nUnder the 1989 agreement between the BPCA and the City of New York, $600 million was transferred by the BPCA to the city. Charles J. Urstadt, the first chairman and CEO of the BPCA, noted in an August 19, 2007, op-ed piece in the New York Post that the aggregate figure of funds transferred to the City of New York is above $1.4 billion, with the BPCA continuing to contribute $200 million a year.[57] The Independent Budget Office of the City of New York also recommended the city take over Battery Park City in a report published in February 2020. The report echoed Urstadt's proposal as a way to increase revenue to the city.[58] An article published by The Broadsheet Daily described the complex shared ownership structure of Battery Park City between the city and state that was set up by Urstadt.[59]\n\nExcess revenue from the area was to be contributed to other housing efforts, typically low-income projects in the Bronx and Harlem. Much of this funding has historically been diverted to general city expenses, under section 3.d of the 1989 agreement. However, in July 2006, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Governor George Pataki, and Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. announced the final approval for the New York City Housing Trust Fund derived from $130 million in Battery Park City revenues. The fund aimed to preserve or create 4,300 units of low- and moderate-income housing by 2009.[60] It also provided seed financing for the New York Acquisition Fund, a $230 million initiative that aims to serve as a catalyst for the construction and preservation of more than 30,000 units of affordable housing citywide by 2016. The Acquisition Fund has since established itself as a model for similar funds in cities and states across the country.[61]\n\nBy 2018, thirty residential buildings had been built in Battery Park City and no new construction was planned. The Battery Park City Authority's main focus turned to maintenance of existing infrastructure, security and conservancy of the public spaces. The authority was creating over 1,000 free activities per year.[14]\n\nCondo owners in Battery Park City pay higher monthly charges than owners of comparable apartments elsewhere in New York City because residents pay their building's common charges in addition to PILOT (payment in lieu of taxes). The PILOT payments replace real estate taxes and the land lease. As a result, residential units have higher monthly costs compared to other neighborhoods. The cumulative effect is lower property values for homeowners.[62]\n\nBecause none of the properties in Battery Park City own the land they are built on, many banks have refused to write loans when those ground leases are periodically up for renewal. This has been a regular source of anger and frustration for owners in Battery Park City who are looking to sell.[63]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nFor census purposes, the New York City government classifies Battery Park City as part of a larger neighborhood tabulation area called Battery Park City-Lower Manhattan.[64] Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Battery Park City-Lower Manhattan was 39,699, an increase of 19,611 (97.6%) from the 20,088 counted in 2000. Covering an area of 479.77 acres (194.16 ha), the neighborhood had a population density of 82.7 inhabitants per acre (52,900/sq mi; 20,400/km2).[65] The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 65.4% (25,965) White, 3.2% (1,288) African American, 0.1% (35) Native American, 20.2% (8,016) Asian, 0.0% (17) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (153) from other races, and 3.0% (1,170) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 7.7% (3,055) of the population.[66]\n\nThe entirety of Community District 1, which comprises Battery Park City and other Lower Manhattan neighborhoods, had 63,383 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 85.8 years.[67]: 2, 20 This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods.[68]: 53 (PDF p. 84) [69] Most inhabitants are young to middle-aged adults: half (50%) are between the ages of 25 and 44, while 14% are between 0 and 17, and 18% between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 11% and 7% respectively.[67]: 2\n\nAs of 2017, the median household income in Community Districts 1 and 2 (including Greenwich Village and SoHo) was $144,878,[70] though the median income in Battery Park City individually was $126,771.[2] In 2018, an estimated 9% of Battery Park City and Lower Manhattan residents lived in poverty, compared to 14% in all of Manhattan and 20% in all of New York City. One in twenty-five residents (4%) were unemployed, compared to 7% in Manhattan and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 38% in Battery Park City and Lower Manhattan, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 45% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, as of 2018 , Battery Park City and Lower Manhattan are considered high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.[67]: 7\n\nAs of 2007 , about 10,000 people live in Battery Park City, most of whom are upper middle class and upper class (54.0% of households have incomes over $100,000). When fully built out, the neighborhood is projected to have 14,000 residents.[71]\n\nCensus\n\n[edit]\n\nBased on the 2020 census, the racial makeup of Northern Battery Park City (10282) was 66% White, 2% Black, 0% Native American, 16% Asian, 0% Islander, 0% from other races, and 5% from two or more races. Hispanic of Latino of any race were 11% of the population.[72] The racial makeup of South Battery Park City (10280) was 69% White, 1% Black, 0% Native, 17% Asian, 0% Islander, 0% from other races, 3% from two or more races, and 11% Hispanic.[73]\n\nAs of 2020, the population of the area was 16,169.[3][72][73]\n\nBuildings\n\n[edit]\n\nResidential\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first residential building in Battery Park City, Gateway Plaza, was completed in 1983.[3][5] As of 2010 , the population of the area was 13,386. Some of the more prominent residential buildings include:\n\nMillennium Point, a 449-foot (137 m), 38-story skyscraper built from 1999 to 2001.[74] It occupies the street addresses 25–39 Battery Place.[75] However, due to the September 11 attacks which hit the nearby World Trade Center, opening of Millennium Point was delayed until January 2002.[75] The building won the 2001 Silver Emporis Skyscraper Award.[74] The tower section contains 113 luxury condominiums.[75] The wider, lower 12 floors are occupied by a 5-star hotel, The Wagner at the Battery (formerly the Ritz-Carlton Battery Park). The hotel has 298 rooms, including 44 suites, with the largest suite spanning 200 square metres (2,150 sq ft) in area.[75] The Skyscraper Museum occupies a small space on the first floor of the building. A restaurant is located on the 14th floor.\n\nThe Solaire, the first green residential building in the United States, as well as the first residential high-rise building in New York City to be certified by the U.S. Green Building Council.[3][76] It was designed by Pelli Clarke Pelli and completed in 2003.[77] The Solaire is located at 20 River Terrace. The developer received funding from the State of New York, which was somewhat controversial as the developer was only required to agree to set aside 10% of the units as \"affordable housing\" or \"moderate income\", rather than the usual 80:20 agreement. When the building opened, rents ranged from roughly $2,500 to $9,001 depending on the size of the unit. The building has been rated LEED Platinum.[78] The energy conserving building design is 35% more energy-efficient than code requires, resulting in a 67% lower electricity demand during peak hours, resulting in, among other benefits, lower electric bills for residents.
