        "text": "NEW YORK, Sept. 28, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Brookfield Properties today announced the opening of Manhattan West, New York City's newest dynamic mixed-use destination spanning eight-acres of premier dining, hospitality, entertainment, luxury residences, modern office space and experiential retail. Deploying world-class planning and design capabilities, Manhattan West unlocks Manhattan's West Side to create a destination that is inclusive and welcoming for all.\n\nWith Skidmore, Owings & Merrill serving as the master architect, the complex is centered around a vibrant 2.5-acre urban pedestrian plaza with lush gardens and myriad public seating. The plaza will be enlivened year-round with free, public arts and events curated by Arts Brookfield, Brookfield's award-winning cultural programming department. Creative retail experiences focused on health, wellness and emerging brands and more than 25 innovative culinary concepts will line the plaza, offering visitors an enticing open-air shopping and dining experience.\n\n\"Manhattan West is New York City's newest destination for innovative culinary and cultural experiences,\" said Ben Brown, Managing Partner, Brookfield's real estate group. \"More than three decades in the making, Manhattan West combines exceptional dining, entertainment and retail - opening today - with state-of-the art office space, luxury residences and a stunning boutique hotel, all surrounding a 2.5-acre landscaped public plaza that will be programmed year round by Arts Brookfield. Direct connections to the new Moynihan Train Hall, Madison Square Garden and, soon, The High Line, situate the complex in the very heart of Manhattan's new West Side. We are incredibly proud that Manhattan West will contribute to the energy and dynamism of New York City as the city continues to come back to life. We would like to thank our first-class partners and teams for helping us to realize this large-scale, long-planned and monumental vision.\"\n\nCULINARY DESTINATION\n\nManhattan West's crown jewel is its collection of new restaurant concepts, bringing together a selection of powerhouse names in the culinary industry. The restaurants, each overlooking the central plaza, offer a diverse array of cuisines and feature cascading, outdoor terraces for al fresco dining to complement the interior dining rooms.\n\nOpening early fall, Ci Siamo is the newest restaurant from Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group and Chef Hillary Sterling that centers around live-fire cooking and an Italian-inflected menu. Serving as an all-day neighborhood kitchen, Danny Meyer also brings his Daily Provisions concept to Manhattan West. Arriving next month, Citizens New York will bring an elevated quick service culinary market with hotspots including Umami Burger, Krispy Rice, Sam's Crispy Chicken, Sa'Moto, El Pollo Verde, Plant Nation and more to the neighborhood along with two restaurant concepts from parent company sbe, the famed west-coast staple Katsuya by Chef Katsuya Uechi and Casa Dani by three-star Michelin Chef Dani Garcia.

Midnight Theater presents a lively riff on Asian classics with its restaurant Hidden Leaf this October, rounding out the signature culinary experiences at Manhattan West.\n\nThe interplay between the spaces and open-air plaza create an energizing environment the minute you step into Manhattan West. With the introduction of these new restaurants, bars and cafes, the West Side is transforming into a culinary destination within walking distance of major attractions like Madison Square Garden, the High Line, Penn Station and Moynihan Train Hall.\n\n\"We are thrilled to partner with Brookfield Properties on a mutual goal to inspire and bring community together through a shared love of food,\" said Sam Nazarian, Founder and CEO of C3. \"Citizens New York will serve as our first flagship culinary market and is a culmination of C3's renowned talent, from the design partnership with David Rockwell and his team at The Rockwell Group, to our famed chef partners (Chef Katusya Uechi, Dani Garcia, Dario Cecchini and Masaharu Morimoto). Our goal with the opening of Citizens New York is to democratize Haute Cuisine and make our renowned dishes helmed by famed global chefs available to all at everyday prices.\"\n\n\"We've been eagerly anticipating the debut of Manhattan West - a key to unlocking and bridging the West Side's potential as a destination neighborhood,\" said Union Square Hospitality Group Founder & CEO Danny Meyer. \"The opening represents a pivotal moment of our city's revival and gives us good reason to celebrate. USHG is proud to be part of this ever-evolving, hospitality-forward project that we know will continue to take shape alongside the city.\"\n\nPENDRY MANHATTAN WEST\n\nRecently opened, Pendry Manhattan West is the latest property in the Pendry Hotels & Resorts portfolio and the brand's first hotel in New York City.

Fuerstman, Founder, Chairman and CEO, Montage International. \"Together with the dynamic, experiential restaurants, retail and cultural attractions as part of Manhattan West, Pendry is proud to be at the epicenter of the city's newest neighborhood.\"\n\nPUBLIC PLAZA & ART/CULTURE\n\nServing as the heart of the development, Manhattan West's 2.5-acre public plaza designed by James Corner Field Operation was created to be inclusive and welcoming, featuring hundreds of movable chairs, tables, benches and planters, which bring lush greenery to the space. Upon entering the plaza, visitors are welcomed by Citrovia, the standout interactive, outdoor art exhibit that debuted this summer and boasts thousands of whimsical, hand-painted lemons and groves.\n\nTo create a lively, energetic environment, Arts Brookfield has further activated Manhattan West's public spaces with year-round, free, public programming, including a host of interactive cultural events like Theatre For One's 'Here Is Future', an experience that brought together one actor and one audience member for a sensational and intimate experience, and STREB EXTREME ACTION by Elizabeth Streb, a series of stunning choreographed feats of physicality, scientifically planned chaos, strength, risk, and elegance. Upcoming art commissions include the Plaza Media Wall in October and a rotating series of public art installations in early 2022.
