        "text": "​SWIF does not provide Workers' Compensation Insurance coverage for states other than Pennsylvania. It does, however, afford coverage for Pennsylvania hired employees who are injured out-of-state pursuant to the Extraterritorial Provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act. Although it is a very fact specific area of the law, the general rule is that coverage will be afforded to an individual hired in Pennsylvania, but assigned to work out-of-state on a temporary basis. Any benefits paid will be made pursuant to Pennsylvania law and not the law of the state where the work injury occurred. This is a complex and difficult area of the law, where questions of coverage and compensability often turn on the facts surrounding the employee's hire and the insured's business presence out-of-state. Such questions often require the advice of an insurance broker or lawyer. Obviously, it is better that these questions be addressed before an injury occurs.\n\n​Ensure Your Address is Correct\n\nIt is essential that our team has the accurate mailing addresses for SWIF recipients to ensure that the new debit cards are delivered promptly and correctly.\n\nAny SWIF recipient who has moved since initially applying for benefits should contact their adjuster to provide their current mailing address as soon as possible.\n\nWatch Your Mail for the Money Network Prepaid Debit Card\n\nAll SWIF recipients receiving Money Network cards to replace existing ReliaCards are encouraged to carefully watch their mail for a plain white envelope with an Omaha, Nebraska, return address. They should remove their new Money Network cards before discarding the envelope, and follow the included directions for selecting a PIN and activating their card as soon as possible.\n\n​SWIF has joined with other state agencies to offer the Keystone ID, a single, secure way to access multiple commonwealth services. Before paying with your credit card, you will be asked to register for or sign in with a Keystone ID. You will be required to sign up or sign in with a log in and password which will then allow you to enter Payeezy's secure site to pay your bill with your credit card. You are only required to sign up once but will need to remember your log in and password for future transactions.\n\n​If you do not pay your balance due with the State Workers' Insurance Fund (SWIF) by your billing due date, your account will go into collections. A set of Collection letters will go out allowing you 30 days to make your payment to SWIF. If at that point no payment or communication is made on your account, the account will then be sent to the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General (AG).\n\nCommonwealth Attorneys Act, 71 P.S. Section 732-204(c) states: \"The Attorney General shall collect, by suit or otherwise, all debts, taxes and accounts due the Commonwealth which shall be referred to and placed with the Attorney General's for collection by any Commonwealth Agency; the Attorney General shall keep a proper docket or dockets, duly indexed, of all such claims, showing whether they are in litigation and their nature and condition.\"\n\nThis statute is what allows us to refer accounts to the AG, but it is the Management Directive 310.10 that sets forth the procedure that can be used by an agency to collect and refer accounts to the AG's office. Management Directive 310.10 states its purpose: \"to establish policy and guidelines for collection accounts due to the Commonwealth and to provide procedures for depositing collections made by the Office of Attorney General, Financial Enforcement Section, and for billing state agencies for collection expenses.\""
