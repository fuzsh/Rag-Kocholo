        "text": "ICE, its faculty and alumni have been awarded top honors by the James Beard Foundation, the IACP, USA Today, The Daily Meal and more. Find out why an ICE education puts you in amazing company. [1]\n\nOur alumni run top kitchens around the globe, winning awards and transforming the future of culinary innovation. 88% report that their ICE education has proved somewhat or extremely important to their careers. [2]\n\nWith more than 45 years of experience launching culinary careers, ICE is among the most respected culinary schools in New York and in America. In the last two years, ICE placed students in over 300 establishments, prompting praise from industry leaders. [3]\n\n“I’m honored that my alma mater has named a scholarship in my honor. I’m pleased that it is tied to the recipient having a focus on regional cooking, as I want to inspire others to that direction.”\n\n“When looking for the next generation of great chefs, ICE is one of the first places that we turn to. Not only does the school provide the foundational skills needed to excel in a Michelin-level kitchen, but it is also a home for culinary innovation — promoting new and more sustainable approaches to our craft through programs like the Plant-Based Culinary Arts Diploma.”\n\nI’ve been working with ICE students in New York for years and they are consistently among the best young chefs in my restaurants.\n\nHaving the strong culinary background that I learned from ICE really helped me with everything I have done since school. It gave me credibility in the industry, and gave me the language and the skills I needed to later stand beside some of the greatest chefs in the world.\n\nIt's amazing to see what kind of important contributions ICE alumni have made to our restaurants. When an applicant comes to us from ICE, we know they've been schooled in both the technical and hospitality skills so crucial to succeed in this business.\n\nThe Institute of Culinary Education has proven to be an excellent resource for us for many years. With its world class programs and curriculum, I know I will continue to rely on ICE to recruit skilled, ambitious young professionals.\n\nICE instills in its alumni the highest standards and discipline, which is always shown through their work. At Jean-Georges and other restaurants, we look forward to seeing ICE on an applicant's resume and are always impressed by their determination, imagination and devotion to the culinary arts.\n\nICE helped lay the foundations of my education as a chef. It was there that I learned the basics, and those lessons have stayed with me throughout my entire career, from Paris to Monte Carlo to New York City.\n\nThe talented chef-instructors at ICE clearly teach students skills that prepare them for the reality of working at the highest level in the restaurant industry. We rely on ICE as an integral partner in recruiting well-trained new staff, full of potential!\n\nThe graduates and externs we have hired over the years from the Institute of Culinary Education have always come to us informed, eager to work and well-trained.\n\nI chose ICE as a postgraduate education. I wanted to be a chef but didn't need to pursue another degree — I wanted to work! I needed a strong foundation in classic technique taught in a relatively short time, that I could take to any restaurant and build my skills on, and that's exactly what I got at ICE.\n\nAfter a successful 20 years in some amazing kitchens, I'd earned a lot of opportunities - and I chose to join the team at ICE. I have always admired ICE, and education is the perfect opportunity for me to give back, to inspire the next generation of chefs to enjoy and excel in a career in culinary or pastry arts.\n\nI was thrilled to learn that the Institute of Culinary Education is expanding and opening its second location in Los Angeles. It is a hub of culinary innovation, and having a culinary school of ICE’s caliber in this market will only enhance the city’s standing as a major culinary center in the U.S.\n\n“I have had the privilege of working with ICE students for many years at Le Bernardin. These aspiring chefs consistently show dedication, a strong work ethic and a genuine passion for the culinary arts.”\n\n\"My time at the Institute of Culinary Education was an invaluable experience that set me on a strong path forward in my career. It provided me with the foundation I needed to feel confident and ready to take on the challenges that awaited. From the coursework to the instructors, I felt that care was taken in making sure I was prepared to enter the culinary industry. I am extremely grateful for my time at ICE.\""
