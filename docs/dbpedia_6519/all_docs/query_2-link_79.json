        "text": "Reporting here from the Hot Tub Time Machine, dial set to 2010. Business analysts and those with even a passing interest in men’s wear will remember that as the year when Suit Supply became a worldwide phenomenon. It was also when, for the first time, novel technology enabled men to customize their own suits online without having to submit to pesky nuisances like tailors or the bother of going into a store.\n\nAs it happens, 2010 also coincided with certain other shifts in the evolution of fashion, and this may be the place to note a fact about men’s wear that is generally too little appreciated. As a masculine uniform, the suit has changed remarkably little in 400 years, say historians of costume. (Regarding which: Harry Styles in a dress would have been no big whoop to inhabitants of preindustrial eras, when men and women alike wore tunics and aristocratic boy children were attired in frocks until graduating to two-legged garments in a rite of passage known as “breeching.”)\n\nIn other words, while suits have always been with us, their proportions shift constantly along with tastes, and by the second decade of this century, the influence of the American designer Thom Browne had crept into every corner of an industry floundering for direction. For anyone unaware of Mr. Browne’s influence, let’s put it this way: Honey, he shrunk the suit.\n\nMr. Browne made jackets snugger and shorter, billboarding the male posterior. He designed skinny trousers so short suddenly men had ankles again.\n\nMainstream fashion may have sidestepped the more extreme manifestations of the shrunken suit, and yet it got the memo. Guys of all kinds and varied anatomical types — from “giraffes” to “short kings” — embraced tight suits, made them a business wear default and stuck with them. Then, of course, the pandemic happened, and no one needs to read another story about what that did to hard pants and blazers.\n\nNow, of course, a great many workers are back in the office. A surprising number have already been toiling in corporate ant farms for months or even, in the case of some investment banks, as much as a year.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
