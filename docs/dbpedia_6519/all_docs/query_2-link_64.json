        "text": "Welcome to Jones Day. Welcome to opportunity.\n\nAt Jones Day, your opportunities to develop your career - your legal skills, your understanding of the law, your relationships with colleagues and clients across the globe - are limitless.\n\nGlobal\n\nYou have the opportunity to work seamlessly with clients and colleagues around the world. Jones Day provides significant legal representation for almost half of the Fortune 500, Fortune Global 500, and FT Global 500. Jones Day can provide integrated legal services of the highest quality because we are a truly global law firm with 40 offices in major centers of business and finance throughout the world, covering 16 countries on five continents. Moreover, we staff our projects by selecting the lawyers best able to meet the specific client's needs, regardless of location. We are looking for individuals who are excited to contribute to a global client service team.\n\nExperience\n\nYou have the opportunity to work on projects that challenge your legal mind and expose you to the world beyond your local office. Jones Day is proud to have a 100-year history of representing corporate America, from John D. Rockefeller to Celgene. We have unparalleled experience in traditional practices like M&A, and \"bet the company\" litigation, as well as in emerging legal fields like cybersecurity/privacy. At the same time, we know that with the privilege of working at the forefront of the process of globalization comes responsibility to work toward ensuring that the costs and benefits of globalization are more equitably distributed. We have demonstrated this commitment through our pro-bono work, including with refugees from the violence in Central America. We are looking for individuals who are committed to tackling the sophisticated legal challenges posed by our global client base and to the authentic advancement of the rule of law.\n\nTeam\n\nYou have the opportunity to grow as part of a committed team, where we are all responsible for each other’s development and well-being, as well as to the continued success of Jones Day as an institution. Jones Day reflects this core value not only in how we interact with each other, but in how we are organized. Jones Day is a general partnership - a single true partnership - where the financial well being of our more than 4,500 employees rests on the advice each lawyer provides. This responsibility fosters a commitment to one another and reinforces the fact that we have collective duties—to clients, to the partnership, to all Jones Day employees and their families. We are looking for individuals who place client service ahead of individual advancement, and who want to be a resource for, and offer nothing less than their full respect to, their colleagues.\n\nMentoring\n\nYou have the opportunity to develop meaningful relationships with colleagues who are motivated to share their knowledge with you and invest in your future. Jones Day attorneys prioritize the stewardship and future of our institution, and therefore the development of each new generation of lawyers. We invest in our people through formal and informal mentoring programs. Through the New Lawyers Group, our newest legal talent can explore their interests across our practice areas which provides them with mentoring relationships with leaders in each field. We are looking for bright legal minds who see their role not only as those seeking mentoring, but also those who will soon become mentors themselves.\n\nShared Purpose\n\nYou have the opportunity to use your creative and flexible thinking, and your commitment to cooperative and responsible team work, to contribute toward our shared purpose: excellence in client service. Jones Day's clients do not come to us for the easy questions. They rely on us to find the solutions in the gray areas, on the as yet un-trodden path, and with the relentlessness of purpose and attention to detail that they deserve. Our attorneys can successfully respond to those demands only if we share the highest ethics and standards for quality of work. We are looking for individuals who are committed to our fundamental values. We are looking for individuals who internalize and live the Jones Day Way.\n\nWhether you join as a law student, a judicial clerk or a lateral, Jones Day provides opportunities for your development of a challenging and satisfying legal career with a global impact.\n\nWe fully immerse our summer associates in the Firm to provide an accurate picture of what being a Jones Day lawyer is like. For starters, you'll be provided a mentor and receive extensive practical and substantive training, including a two day nationwide orientation and training program in Washington, DC. You'll learn about the practice of law not by watching, but by working side by side with Jones Day attorneys and getting involved in real assignments. And the mix of assignments is not one size fits all—you'll have the flexibility to select assignments from as few or as many practice groups as you are interested in sampling, including pro bono. Finally, at organized social events and outings during the summer, you'll have the opportunity to get to know the Firm and our lawyers better, in addition to having a lot of fun of course.\n\nSuccessful summer associates may be invited back to join us in a full time position, and indeed, the vast majority of our new lawyers join us after spending a summer at Jones Day.\n\nAt Jones Day, we believe that great lawyering begins with each individual's careful decision about what type of lawyer he or she wants to be. That's why we give our new lawyers time—about a year—to explore and decide on a practice focus.\n\nFor more than three decades, Jones Day’s New Lawyers Group (\"NLG\") has provided our new lawyers in their first year with exposure to a variety of practices, lawyering styles, and training and development opportunities. We allow our associates—working together with the Firm—to discover their best fit and passion for a practice area, and become a better and more well-rounded lawyer in the process. This process greatly benefits our associates, the practices they join, the Firm, and our clients.\n\nAll lawyers joining our U.S. offices from law school (and many in our offices outside the U.S.) become members of the NLG for about a year (or perhaps longer outside the U.S.) before joining a practice. Judicial clerks also can elect to join the NLG.\n\nIf new lawyers arrive at Jones Day focused on a particular area of practice, they can hit the ground running doing assignments with that practice during their first year, consistent with the overall needs of our clients, However, if they seek exposure to a variety of practices, or want to explore a new area, the NLG program provides the flexibility and support to satisfy that curiosity. If a lawyer's interests change in the course of the year, the program is designed to respond to that change.\n\nOne or two partners designated as NLG coordinators in each office help solicit and coordinate assignments. The coordinators also help new lawyers network with, and earn their own assignments from, more senior lawyers who do the kind of work they want to do. The coordinators help acclimate new lawyers to the Firm, pair them with mentors, act as advocates and sounding boards, oversee an extensive year-long training program, provide informal feedback, conduct mid-year reviews, and assist with transfers into each of our practices.\n\nOne of the high points of the NLG year is the Firm's four-day New Lawyers Academy in Washington, DC. Each fall, new lawyers assemble from our more than 40 offices around the world to meet and network with each other and learn what it means to be One Firm Worldwide. Our Firm leaders, partners, and associates teach the new lawyers about Jones Day's culture, history, organization, and achievements and lead substantive and interactive training sessions. Every year, our new lawyers take away from the Academy a sense of great pride and excitement about being part of the Firm.\n\nTips\n\nJones Day understands that for lawyers and law students alike, the interview process is exhausting, exciting, and, yes, stressful. Jones Day seeks candidates who understand the Firm's principles and foundational values and want to be a productive and meaningful contributor to its future. Law students are looking for a long-term professional home that will support, challenge and reward them. To help you make the decision that's right for you, we offer the following suggestions.\n\nPreparing for Interviews\n\nDifferent law firms have different cultures, strengths, and priorities. Before you choose a firm, think about what's important to you.\n\nAre you looking for an eat-what-you-kill compensation model, or do you prefer a more collaborative work environment?\n\nHow much do you value financial and firm stability?\n\nAre you already certain which practice you want to join, or would you prefer the flexibility to work with a number of practices before joining one?\n\nResearch the Firm\n\nBefore you arrive for an interview, learn as much as you can about the firm. Resources to consult include:\n\n3Ls who have summered at firms you are considering;\n\nContacts in the legal community you seek to join;\n\nNALP summaries, which provide numerical snapshots of firm size, practices, diversity, compensation, and other objective information; and\n\nFirm web sites, which list areas of practice, provide biographies of lawyers, and, in some cases, supply additional information that gives insight into that firm's culture and priorities.\n\nThe On-Campus Interview\n\nThe on-campus interview is a short meeting with one or two people from the firm. Typically, the interviewer spends much of the interview asking you questions about your resume, interests, and goals. You'll also have a chance to ask questions about the firm.\n\nKnow your resume. Be prepared to answer questions about your academic achievements, work experience, and interests. If you list any publications on your resume, be prepared to discuss them substantively.\n\nKnow the firm and ask informed questions about it. Demonstrating that you have done your research indicates not only genuine interest in the firm, but also seriousness and professionalism.\n\nBe yourself. Firms seek well-rounded, interested, and interesting candidates of all backgrounds and personalities. Let your best professional, enthusiastic self shine through in the interview.\n\nThe Call-Back Interview\n\nLaw firms typically call back a small percentage of the candidates they see on campus. When you receive a call-back offer, you will usually be instructed to contact the recruiting department to schedule the call-back interview and make the necessary travel arrangements. At most firms, call-back interviews last a half-day and consist of interviews with four or more lawyers. In addition to the recommendations for on-campus interviews above, keep the following suggestions in mind.\n\nTreat everyone you meet with respect. Although your interviews will all be with lawyers, good firms listen to the opinions of their recruiting staff, assistants, and everyone else you encounter as a candidate.\n\nAdapt. Each interviewer has a different style. Some are conversational, others quite formal. By responding appropriately to each interviewer's style, you'll make the interview a more enjoyable and successful experience.\n\nAsk questions. The best way to demonstrate your genuine interest in a firm is by asking about aspects unique to that particular firm. You can ask the same question of more than one person during the interview process.\n\nTake it all in. Get a feel for the atmosphere of the office. Does it seem friendly? When lawyers and staff pass each other in the hall, do they say hello?\n\nAfter the Interview\n\nYou are not required to write thank-you notes, and there is no consensus as to whether they're advisable. However, if you do send them, proofread them very carefully and do not misspell your interviewers' names.\n\nIf you have additional questions, feel free to reach out to the lawyers with whom you interviewed or to the firm's recruiting department.\n\nFirm guidelines allow you to keep an offer open no more than 21 days, unless your law school has a different policy. When you receive offers, be courteous to your classmates and the firms that have made offers to you by releasing any offers that you are no longer considering.\n\nTravel Guidelines\n\nInterview Travel\n\nIf Jones Day invites you to travel for an interview in one of our offices, we will provide the contact information for our travel desk, along with an expense reimbursement form. To ensure prompt reimbursement of your out-of-pocket expenses, submit your receipts no later than 20 days after the interview. Provide on the expense form the names of other law firms you visited on dates contiguous to your Jones Day interview. We will share expenses with those firms. If you cancel your interview for any reason, you are responsible for canceling your travel reservations. If you anticipate expenditures not provided for on this list, please contact the Recruiting Department before your travel date.\n\nAir or Train Travel\n\nBill your air or train travel directly to Jones Day. The Recruiting Department will give you instructions for making reservations. If you prefer to drive to the interview location from a distant school, first coordinate your plan for expense reimbursement with the Recruiting Department.\n\nHotel Accommodations\n\nBill your hotel accommodations directly to Jones Day. One hotel night is deemed appropriate for each firm with which you interview; when traveling to an opposite coast, a two-night stay is covered. Cost of internet connection is also covered. Other charges must be approved in advance by the Recruiting Department.\n\nGround Transportation\n\nThe Firm will reimburse the cost of ground transportation to and from the airport local to your school. If you choose to drive, we will reimburse the parking fee at the airport, but we do not pay mileage. Similarly, we will reimburse for round-trip taxi rides to the airport/office/hotel/next interview location. If you are interviewing in both Silicon Valley and San Francisco from out of town, please call in advance to discuss renting a car. Otherwise, rental car costs are generally not covered.\n\nMeals\n\nYou will be reimbursed for meals associated with each night spent in the hotel, not to exceed $70 total per 24-hour period. Please submit the credit card receipt and itemized bill (unless these expenses are included in the hotel bill).\n\nNot Eligible for Reimbursement\n\nThe following are not reimbursable: alcoholic drinks, long-distance telephone calls, dry-cleaning services, limousine services, meals and/or drinks for additional people, and other extra charges on the hotel bill.\n\nLaw School FAQs\n\nQ.
