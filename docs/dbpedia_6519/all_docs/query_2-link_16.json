        "text": "High inside the alternative-asset giant, it’s an open secret that bosses are preparing Connor Teskey to take over\n\nIt was a takeover big enough to transform Brookfield Asset Management into a behemoth. Behind it was a young, ambitious executive obsessed with the details — making an impression on bosses that would put him on the path to become CEO.\n\nConnor Teskey was supposed to be tending to investments in renewables when he pitched higher-ups on the idea of taking a controlling stake in Oaktree Capital Management . He studied its business lines, read every letter that founder Howard Marks ever sent to investors, crunched the numbers and arranged the underwriting. The roughly $5 billion deal announced in 2019 helped catapult Brookfield into the world’s second-largest alternative-asset manager."
