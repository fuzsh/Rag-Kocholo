        "text": "Following a Request for Proposals (RFP) process, NYSED has contracted with two professional learning providers to operate the three PLAN Technical Assistance Centers (TACs):\n\nQuestar III BOCES won the bid to operate the PLAN TAC for Focus Area A: Career and Technical Education & Work-Based Learning.\n\nQuestar III BOCES delivers more than 275 educational and administrative services to 22 school districts in Rensselaer, Columbia, and Greene counties. Questar III also provides statewide services to more than 670 school districts and BOCES in New York. As part of Questar III BOCES, the Office of School Improvement supports the efforts of Career and Technical Education Programs, Innovative Programs, and Special Education Programs in addition to public school programs to enhance work-based initiatives, provide meaningful assessments, and support best practices in curriculum development, teacher strategies, and system-wide change.\n\nModern Learners LLC won the bids to operate the PLAN TAC for Focus Area B: Inquiry-Based Approaches with Learner Profiles and Focus Area C: Project-Based Learning and Performance-Based Assessment Tasks.\n\nModern Learners helps organizational leaders build a culture of learning through community, content, and events, and has worked with hundreds of leaders from all over the world. Modern Learners helps design joyful learning experiences by keeping a focus on learning with the belief that learning is defined by wanting to learn more.\n\nBy participating in this project, schools, districts, and BOCES will have the opportunity to:\n\nParticipate in a Multi-School Network\n\nEach Pilot School will be part of a Pilot Network where they will be supported by and learn together with their peers and other experts in performance-based learning and assessment (PBLA).\n\nEngage in High-Quality Professional Learning Experiences\n\nEducators in Pilot Schools will receive both school-based and network-wide training and professional development, as well as participate in a Community of Practice that engages in the Plan-Do-Study-Act Cycle to increase and continuously improve their capacity to develop and use high-quality, performance-based approaches to learning and assessment. The focus of this professional learning will be on helping teachers and school leaders make the shifts in practice necessary to effectively implement PBLA in their schools.\n\nLearn from Partners with Expertise in Performance-Based Assessment\n\nTeachers and leaders from Pilot Schools will be able to engage in professional learning experiences and see first-hand the instructional shifts that they will need to make in their own schools and classrooms.\n\nSupports for Pilot Schools\n\nA primary objective of the pilot program is to determine how best to support New York educators in implementing PBLA. Through the PLAN Pilot, NYSED will help pilot schools build capacity at the school, community, and network levels by providing professional learning experiences, mentorship, peer support networks, communities of practice, and a supportive policy environment, as well as working with pilot school educators to explore additional supports needed.\n\nNYSED was awarded nearly $3 million from the US Department of Education's Competitive Grants for State Assessments program to fund the PLAN Program, and the majority of that funding is earmarked to support professional learning for educators over the four-year grant period, in three key areas of capacity-building:\n\nBuild a strong, broad, and shared knowledge base on PBLA among teachers, schools, leaders, and other stakeholders;\n\nProvide expert professional learning providers experienced in PBLA to support teachers and leaders during PLAN Pilot implementation; and\n\nBuild facilitative leadership within and across the PLAN Pilot Networks that engages entire school communities in transitioning to a performance-driven school culture.\n\nEducators in Pilot Schools will receive direct training, professional development, coaching, and resources so that they can re-orient their instructional cultures and assessment practices in ways that are responsive to diverse learning communities and engaging for educators and students alike. NYSED will also support professional learning providers in assisting Pilot School leaders to develop school transition plans and budgets that will support this work in a sustainable way.\n\nProfessional learning providers will work in partnership with NYSED staff to provide technical assistance and professional learning to PLAN Pilot Schools, Mentor Schools, and Networks, through the operation of Technical Assistance Centers (TACs). Pursuant to a Request for Proposals process, NYSED awarded contracts in early 2024 for professional learning providers to operate the TACs."
