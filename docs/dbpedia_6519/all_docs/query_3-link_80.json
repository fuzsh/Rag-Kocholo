This momentum is expected to build over the balance of 2024 and beyond. We completed $800 million of share buybacks to date this year and will keep allocating capital to share repurchases when it makes sense, further enhancing the value of each remaining share.”\n\nHe added, “With capital markets improving and a constructive economic backdrop, we expect transaction activity to continue to increase over the coming quarters. This sets us up well to execute on monetizations across the business and, in turn, further bolster our earnings.”\n\nOperating Results\n\nDistributable earnings (“DE”) before realizations increased by 11% on a per share basis over the prior year quarter.\n\nUnaudited\n\nFor the periods ended June 30\n\n(US$ millions, except per share amounts)\n\nThree Months EndedLast Twelve Months Ended2024202320242023Net income attributable to Brookfield shareholders1$43$81$1,074$308Net income (loss) of consolidated business2(285)1,5123,4032,696Distributable earnings before realizations1,3,41,1131,0134,3794,078– Per Brookfield share1,3,40.710.642.772.56Distributable earnings1,32,1271,1875,8055,205– Per Brookfield share1,31.350.753.673.26\n\nSee endnotes on page 8.\n\nOur share of net income was $43 million and $1.1 billion for the quarter and the last twelve months (“LTM”), respectively. Due to certain accounting nuances, mostly related to the treatment of acquisitions in our infrastructure business, total consolidated net income was negative $285 million in the quarter but positive $3.4 billion over the LTM. Distributable earnings before realizations were $1.1 billion ($0.71/share) for the quarter and $4.4 billion ($2.77/share) for the last twelve months.\n\nAssets under management within our asset management business grew to approximately $1 trillion and fee-bearing capital increased to $514 billion, as a result of strong fundraising across our diversified fund offerings.\n\nWealth solutions delivered another strong quarter, benefiting from the close of American Equity Life (“AEL”) and the strength of our investment performance.\n\nOur operating businesses generated resilient and recurring cash flows, underpinned by the high-quality earnings across our renewable power and transition, infrastructure and private equity businesses and 3% growth in same-store net operating income (“NOI”) from our core real estate portfolio over the LTM.\n\nDuring the quarter and over the LTM, earnings from realizations were $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion, with total DE for the quarter and the LTM of $2.1 billion ($1.35/share) and $5.8 billion ($3.67/share), respectively.\n\nRegular Dividend Declaration\n\nThe Board declared a quarterly dividend for Brookfield Corporation of $0.08 per share, payable on September 27, 2024 to shareholders of record as at the close of business on September 12, 2024. The Board also declared the regular monthly and quarterly dividends on our preferred shares.\n\nOperating Highlights\n\nDistributable earnings before realizations were $1.1 billion ($0.71/share) for the quarter and $4.4 billion ($2.77/share) over the last twelve months, representing an increase of 11% on a per share basis over the prior year quarter. Total distributable earnings were $2.1 billion ($1.35/share) for the quarter and $5.8 billion ($3.67/share) for the last twelve months.\n\nAsset Management:\n\nDE was $636 million ($0.40/share) in the quarter and $2.5 billion ($1.61/share) over the LTM.\n\nAssets under management are now approximately $1 trillion and fee-bearing capital was $514 billion as of June 30, 2024, representing an increase of 17% over the LTM. Inflows during the quarter were $68 billion, backed by the scaling of our credit platform. This increase contributed to the 11% and 6% growth in annualized fee-related earnings (“FRE”) and FRE, respectively, compared to the prior year quarter.\n\nWe expect fundraising to ramp up in the back half of 2024, with closes anticipated for our latest flagship funds in the market, which should result in further earnings growth.\n\nDuring the quarter, our ownership in BAM decreased by 2% to 73% as we used approximately $1 billion of BAM shares as part of the consideration for the acquisition of AEL.\n\nWealth Solutions:\n\nDistributable operating earnings were $292 million ($0.19/share) in the quarter and $1.0 billion ($0.63/share) over the LTM.\n\nInsurance assets grew to over $110 billion, with the close of AEL and the origination of $3.5 billion of new business via our annuity channel during the quarter.\n\nThe average investment portfolio yield on our existing insurance assets was 5.8%, approximately 2% higher than our average cost of capital. Inclusive of AEL, the spread was 1.7% in the quarter. As we reposition the AEL investment portfolio, we expect the investment spread to increase back closer to 2%, and as a result, annualized earnings should grow from $1.4 billion currently to $2 billion.\n\nThrough our combined wealth solutions platforms, we are raising close to $2 billion of retail capital per month.\n\nOperating Businesses:\n\nDE was $371 million ($0.24/share) in the quarter and $1.5 billion ($0.93/share) over the LTM.\n\nOperating Funds from Operations (“Operating FFO”) in our renewable power, transition and infrastructure businesses increased by 7% over the prior year quarter, and same-store Operating FFO in our private equity business grew by 17% versus the prior year quarter. In addition, our core real estate portfolio delivered 3% growth in same-store NOI over the LTM.\n\nIn our real estate business, we signed nearly 5 million square feet of office and retail leases during the quarter, and rents on newly signed leases in our office assets grew by 23% compared to those leases expiring. We are past the bottom of the market, liquidity is coming back and quality assets are achieving their highest rents ever in most markets.\n\nEarnings from the monetization of mature assets were $1.0 billion ($0.64/share) for the quarter and $1.4 billion ($0.90/share) for the LTM.\n\nWith transaction activity picking up, we expect an increased level of monetizations going forward. During the quarter, we advanced or completed several sales at strong investment returns including on a luxury hotel in South Korea, an office asset in Washington, DC, a road fuels operation in Europe, several renewable assets, and the sale of 2% of our BAM shares to assist with increased float in the shares.\n\nTotal accumulated unrealized carried interest was $10.7 billion at quarter end, representing an increase of 13% over the LTM, net of carried interest realized into income. Year to date, we recognized $234 million of net realized carried interest into income, with $15 billion of asset sales completed globally.\n\nWe ended the quarter with approximately $150 billion of capital available to deploy into new investments.\n\nDuring the quarter, we returned $408 million to shareholders through regular dividends and share repurchases. To date this year, we repurchased over $800 million of shares, and we expect to continue to further allocate capital to share buybacks over the remainder of 2024.\n\nWe have approximately $150 billion of deployable capital, which includes $62 billion of cash, financial assets and undrawn credit lines at the Corporation, our affiliates and our wealth solutions business.\n\nOur balance sheet remains conservatively capitalized. Our corporate debt at the Corporation has a weighted-average term of 13 years and modest maturities through to the end of 2025.\n\nWe have best-in-class, strong access to most capital markets globally. This enabled us to execute on approximately $75 billion of financings across the business to date this year, supporting growth and ongoing operations. This includes the issuance of $650 million of 10-year and 30-year bonds at the Corporation. In this deal, we tightened credit spreads by 55 bps and 10 bps, respectively, relative to the most recent comparable issuances.\n\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n\nUnaudited\n\n(US$ millions)\n\nJune 30December 3120242023AssetsCash and cash equivalents$11,249$11,222Other financial assets30,61428,324Accounts receivable and other33,09431,001Inventory11,84111,412Equity accounted investments62,28559,124Investment properties127,235124,152Property, plant and equipment146,128147,617Intangible assets37,17238,994Goodwill34,27034,911Deferred income tax assets3,4263,338Total Assets$497,314$490,095Liabilities and EquityCorporate borrowings$14,823$12,160Accounts payable and other57,79359,011Non-recourse borrowings227,693221,550Subsidiary equity obligations5,0214,145Deferred income tax liabilities24,42024,987EquityNon-controlling interests in net assets122,229122,465Preferred equity4,1034,103Common equity41,23241,674Total Equity167,564168,242Total Liabilities and Equity$497,314$490,095\n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nUnaudited\n\nFor the periods ended June 30\n\n(US$ millions, except per share amounts)\n\nThree Months EndedSix Months Ended2024202320242023Revenues$23,050$23,668$45,957$46,965Direct costs1(16,717)(17,692)(33,288)(35,324)Other income and gains2441,4834841,864Equity accounted income8254011,511830Interest expense– Corporate borrowings(181)(154)(354)(290)– Non-recourse borrowingsSame-store(3,885)(3,610)(7,678)(7,087)Dispositions, net of acquisitions221—(47)—Upfinancings2(131)—(225)—Corporate costs(19)(23)(36)(37)Fair value changes(753)62(595)100Depreciation and amortization(2,435)(2,214)(4,910)(4,402)Income tax(304)(409)(585)(683)Net income (loss)(285)1,5122341,936Less: Amounts attributable to non-controlling interests328(1,431)(89)(1,735)Net income attributable to Brookfield shareholders$43$81$145$201Net income per shareDiluted$—$0.03$0.04$0.08Basic—0.030.040.08\n\n1.

Our conservatively managed balance sheet, extensive operational experience, and global sourcing networks allow us to consistently access unique opportunities. At the center of our success is the Brookfield Ecosystem, which is based on the fundamental principle that each group within Brookfield benefits from being part of the broader organization.

Hard copies of the annual and quarterly reports can be obtained free of charge upon request.\n\nFor more information, please visit our website at www.bn.brookfield.com or contact:\n\nMedia:\n\nKerrie McHugh\n\nTel: (212) 618-3469\n\nEmail: kerrie.mchugh@brookfield.com\n\nInvestor Relations:\n\nLinda Northwood\n\nTel: (416) 359-8647\n\nEmail: linda.northwood@brookfield.com\n\nNon-IFRS and Performance Measures\n\nThis news release and accompanying financial information are based on International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), unless otherwise noted.\n\nWe make reference to Distributable Earnings (“DE”). We define DE as the sum of distributable earnings from our asset management business, distributable operating earnings from our wealth solutions business, distributions received from our ownership of investments, realized carried interest and disposition gains from principal investments, net of earnings from our Corporate Activities, preferred share dividends and equity-based compensation costs. We also make reference to DE before realizations, which refers to DE before realized carried interest and realized disposition gains from principal investments. We believe these measures provide insight into earnings received by the company that are available for distribution to common shareholders or to be reinvested into the business.\n\nRealized carried interest and realized disposition gains are further described below:\n\nRealized Carried Interest represents our contractual share of investment gains generated within a private fund after considering our clients’ minimum return requirements. Realized carried interest is determined on third-party capital that is no longer subject to future investment performance.\n\nRealized Disposition Gains from principal investments are included in DE because we consider the purchase and sale of assets from our directly held investments to be a normal part of the company’s business. Realized disposition gains include gains and losses recorded in net income and equity in the current period, and are adjusted to include fair value changes and revaluation surplus balances recorded in prior periods which were not included in prior period DE.\n\nWe use DE to assess our operating results and the value of Brookfield Corporation’s business and believe that many shareholders and analysts also find these measures of value to them.\n\nWe make reference to Operating Funds from Operations (“Operating FFO”). We define Operating FFO as the company’s share of revenues less direct costs and interest expenses; excludes realized carried interest and disposition gains, fair value changes, depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes; and includes our proportionate share of FFO from operating activities recorded by equity accounted investments on a fully diluted basis.\n\nWe make reference to Net Operating Income (“NOI”), which refers to the revenues from our operations less direct expenses before the impact of depreciation and amortization within our real estate business. We present this measure as we believe it is a key indicator of our ability to impact the operating performance of our properties. As NOI excludes non-recurring items and depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, it provides a performance measure that, when compared to prior periods, reflects the impact of operations from trends in occupancy rates and rental rates.\n\nWe disclose a number of financial measures in this news release that are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with IFRS. These financial measures, which include DE, should not be considered as the sole measure of our performance and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, similar financial measures calculated in accordance with IFRS. We caution readers that these non-IFRS financial measures or other financial metrics are not standardized under IFRS and may differ from the financial measures or other financial metrics disclosed by other businesses and, as a result, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers and entities.\n\nWe provide additional information on key terms and non-IFRS measures in our filings available at www.bn.brookfield.com.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1. Excludes amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.\n\n2. Consolidated basis – includes amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.\n\n3. See Reconciliation of Net Income to Distributable Earnings on page 5 and Non-IFRS and Performance Measures section on page 8.\n\n4. Distributable earnings before realizations, including per share amounts, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 were adjusted for the special distribution of 25% of our asset management business on December 9, 2022. Prior to the adjustment, DE before realizations were $4.3 billion for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nNotice to Readers\n\nBrookfield Corporation is not making any offer or invitation of any kind by communication of this news release and under no circumstance is it to be construed as a prospectus or an advertisement.\n\nThis news release contains “forward-looking information” within the meaning of Canadian provincial securities laws and “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in any applicable Canadian securities regulations (collectively, “forward-looking statements”).

There can be no assurance that comparable results will be achieved in the future, that future investments will be similar to historic investments discussed herein, that targeted returns, growth objectives, diversification or asset allocations will be met or that an investment strategy or investment objectives will be achieved (because of economic conditions, the availability of appropriate opportunities or otherwise).\n\nTarget returns and growth objectives set forth in this news release are for illustrative and informational purposes only and have been presented based on various assumptions made by Brookfield Corporation in relation to the investment strategies being pursued, any of which may prove to be incorrect. There can be no assurance that targeted returns or growth objectives will be achieved.
