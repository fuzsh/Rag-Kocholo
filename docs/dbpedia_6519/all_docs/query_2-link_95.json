        "text": "BROOKFIELD, NEWS, Aug. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brookfield Reinsurance (NYSE, TSX: BNRE, BNRE.A), soon to be renamed ‘Brookfield Wealth Solutions,’ today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nSachin Shah, CEO, stated, “We delivered strong operating results during the second quarter. With the closing of American Equity Life our asset base has doubled, our annuity sales are growing and we are well positioned for our next stage of growth.”\n\nUnaudited\n\nAs of and for the periods ended June 30\n\n(US$ millions, except per share amounts)\n\nThree Months EndedSix Months Ended2024202320242023Total assets$130,533$47,994$130,533$47,994Adjusted equity111,3845,04711,3845,047Distributable operating earnings1298160577305Net income269360606267Net income per each class A and A-1 share$0.08$0.07$0.16$0.14\n\nSee Non-GAAP and Performance Measures on page 7 and a reconciliation from net income and reconciliation from equity on page 6.\n\nHighlights\n\nCompleted the acquisition of American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (“AEL”) on May 2, 2024, and have since redeployed more than $3 billion of assets into Brookfield strategies\n\nAcross our full portfolio, originated approximately $5 billion in proprietary investment strategies during the quarter at returns in excess of 8.5%\n\nGenerated $3 billion of retail annuity sales, including approximately $1.3 billion of sales at AEL during our two months of ownership\n\nClosed 25 pension risk transfer transactions, representing over $450 million in premiums in the quarter\n\nOperating Update\n\nWe recognized $298 million and $577 million of distributable operating earnings (“DOE”) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $160 million and $305 million in the prior year periods. The increase in earnings for the current period reflect contributions from our recent acquisitions, notably two months of ownership of AEL and a full period of Argo Group, which closed in late 2023. Additionally, our results reflect strong annuity sales and other premium growth from underwriting actions taken over the last twelve months. Lastly, we have benefitted from higher spread earnings on our existing business, driven by higher net investment income resulting from the progress made repositioning assets into higher yielding investment strategies.\n\nWe recorded net income of $269 million and $606 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to net income of $360 million and $267 million in the prior year periods. Net income in the current period is the result of strong operating performance and contributions from our DOE partially offset by transaction related costs associated with the acquisition of AEL. Additionally, the prior year period included unrealized mark to market gains on our investments and insurance reserves.\n\nToday, we are in a strong liquidity position across the portfolio, with over $25 billion of cash and short-term liquid investments across our investment portfolios, and another $22 billion of long-term liquid investments. These liquid assets will facilitate the ongoing rotation of our investment portfolio into higher yielding investment strategies, while also continuing to ensure we have sufficient liquidity coverage for our liabilities in the case of any stress events across the broader market.\n\nUpdate on Capital Structure and Name Change\n\nAt a meeting on July 22, 2024, our company’s shareholders approved bye-law amendments designed to simplify and enhance our capital structure, including a re-designation of our class A-1 exchangeable non-voting shares into class A shares of our company and related changes to the terms of the class A shares that will result in no shareholder having the power to vote more than 9.9% of the class A shares, regardless of economic ownership. The third amended and restated bye-laws will become effective on August 9, 2024, with the re-designation occurring on August 29, 2024. Holders of our company’s class A-1 shares do not need to take any action with respect to the re-designation. Once the re-designation is implemented, all previously held class A-1 shares will automatically be re-designated as class A shares and your holdings will be updated accordingly.\n\nShareholders also approved a resolution authorizing the change of our name from “Brookfield Reinsurance” to “Brookfield Wealth Solutions”. We expect that the name change will be effected on or about Friday, September 6, 2024 and that our class A will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol “BNT” at market open as of such date.\n\nRegular Distribution Declaration\n\nThe Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.08 per class A shares, class A-1 shares and class B shares, payable on September 27, 2024 to shareholders of record as at the close of business on September 12, 2024. This distribution is identical in amount per share and has the same payment date as the quarterly distribution announced today by Brookfield Corporation on the Brookfield Class A Shares. The re-designation will have no impact on the payment of the quarterly distribution, and investors who currently hold class A-1 shares do not need to take any action in order to receive the quarterly distribution.\n\nBrookfield Corporation Operating Results\n\nAn investment in Class A shares of our company is intended to be, as nearly as practicable, functionally and economically, equivalent to an investment in the Brookfield Class A Shares. A summary of Brookfield Corporation’s second quarter operating results is provided below:\n\nUnaudited\n\nAs of and for the periods ended June 30\n\n(US$ millions, except per share amounts)\n\nThree Months EndedLast Twelve Months Ended2024202320242023Net income attributable to Brookfield shareholders1$43$81$1,074$308Net income (loss) of consolidated business2(285)1,5123,4032,696Distributable earnings before realizations1,3,41,1131,0134,3794,078– Per Brookfield share1,3,40.710.642.772.56Distributable earnings1,32,1271,1875,8055,205– Per Brookfield share1,31.350.753.673.26\n\nExcludes amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.\n\nConsolidated basis – includes amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.\n\nSee Reconciliation of Net Income to Distributable Earnings on page 5 and Non-IFRS and Performance Measures section on page 8 of Brookfield Corporation’s press release dated August 8, 2024.\n\nDistributable earnings before realizations, including per share amounts, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 were adjusted for the special distribution of 25% of Brookfield’s asset management business on December 9, 2022. Prior to the adjustment, distributable earnings before realizations were $4.3 billion for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nBrookfield Corporation net income above is presented under IFRS. Given the economic equivalence, we expect that the market price of the Class A Shares of our company will be impacted significantly by the market price of the Brookfield Class A Shares and the business performance of Brookfield as a whole. In addition to carefully considering the disclosure made in this news release in its entirety, shareholders are strongly encouraged to carefully review Brookfield’s letter to shareholders, supplemental information and its other continuous disclosure filings.
