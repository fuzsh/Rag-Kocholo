        "text": "We establish the per diem rates for the continental United States (CONUS), which includes the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Federal agencies use the per diem rates to reimburse their employees for subsistence expenses incurred while on official travel.\n\nFederal per diem rates consist of a maximum lodging allowance component and a meals and incidental expenses (M&IE) component. The standard rate of $178 ($110 lodging, $68 M&IE) applies to most of CONUS. For fiscal year (FY) 2025, there are 296 non-standard areas (NSAs) that have per diem rates higher than the standard rate.\n\nSince FY 2005, we have based the maximum lodging allowances on average daily rate (ADR) data. ADR is a widely accepted lodging industry measure derived from a property’s room rental revenue divided by the number of rooms rented. This calculation provides us with the average rate in an area. For more information about how lodging per diem rates are determined, visit Factors influencing lodging rates.\n\nWe remind agencies that the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) allows for actual expense reimbursement when per diem rates are insufficient to meet necessary expenses. Please see FTR § § 301-11.300 through 11.306 for more information.\n\nFY 2025 results\n\nThe standard CONUS lodging rate increased from $107 to $110. The M&IE rate tiers were revised for FY 2025; they were last revised in FY 2022. The standard M&IE rate increased from $59 to $68, and the M&IE rate tiers for non-standard areas increased from $59-$79 to $68-$92.\n\nThe following locations that were NSAs (or part of an established NSA) in FY 2024 moved into the standard CONUS rate category:"
