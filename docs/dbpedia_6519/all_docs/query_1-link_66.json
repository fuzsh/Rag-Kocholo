Land status unknown at this time. Maps: Delorme Atlas & Gazetteer New York State 9th Edition 2011, Eastern New York all outdoors Atlas & Field Guide Publication 2008\n\nThis waterfall is more of a roadside stop than a hike but well worth the stop for sure. It is on posted land. At the fork in the road take a left and park next to the bridge not far from the intersection.\n\nThere are 3 waterfalls in total. You have to climb down a rope to get a view from the bottom of the 40 foot falls so we opted out of that. It was also really hard to find. We drove by it 3 times before we actually found it. It’s unmarked but you can tell where it is because there is a little pull off right before a small bridge. you can hear the water from the road.\n\nThere is a clear trail at the pull-off to walk down and get a view of the falls…\n\nJune 2015Notes: We accessed the waterfall on Button Falls Road just before a bridge (which we parked on the side of the road). From the bridge you could see the small crest (about 5 feet) the leads into the large fall (about 40 feet). To see the larger fall you need to go down a small path alone the bridge (facing west cross bridge go down left hand side).\n\nWhat is nice about this is the access to the small crest which you could get your feet wet. Hard to see full Falls due to leaves. Not much of a hike since it’s only about a hundred meters. Side note: Bring bug spray. ore waterfalls are downstream.\n\nDirections: From I-90 W, in Herkimer, Take exit 30 to the right onto Rt-28 towards Herkimer/Mohawk and drive for .6 miles. Turn left onto Mohawk St and drive for .1 miles. Keep right onto Hwy 5s W and drive for .5 miles. Turn left onto Warren St and drive for 1.6 miles. Turn right onto Ward Rd and drive for .7 miles. Turn left onto Warren Rd and drive for 4.3 miles. Turn left onto Elizabethtown Rd and drive for 6.3 miles. Turn right onto US 20 and drive for 2.8 miles. Turn left onto South St and drive for 1.6 miles. Turn right onto Forks Rd and drive for 3.7 miles. Turn left onto Hwy 8 and drive for 3.8 miles.
