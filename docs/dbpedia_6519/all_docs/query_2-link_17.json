Canstruction, founded by the SDA, whose purpose is to advance management and administrative professionals in the A/E/C industry through education, networking, leadership, and resources. Canstruction hosts competitions and events worldwide, creating awe-inspiring, gigantic structures made entirely out of non- perishable food.\n\nTeams of volunteers, which include design industry professionals, participate in Canstruction® events in over 100 cities each year. The can art sculptures are on exhibit to the public in each city where a competition is held. The public is invited to donate non-perishable food items during the exhibition. At the close of an exhibition, all food from the structures and public donations are donated to local food banks.\n\nCanstruction® New York has donated over 2 million pounds of food to local food banks since 1993, and over 1.2 million pounds to City Harvest since 2006. Since 1992, Canstruction® has raised nearly 82 million pounds of food for hunger relief organizations around the world with its signature, trademarked CanArt.\n\nABOUT CITY HARVEST\n\nCity Harvest is New York’s first and largest food rescue organization, collecting perfectly good food that would otherwise go to waste to help feed the millions of New Yorkers who struggle to put meals on their tables. In over 40 years serving New Yorkers experiencing food insecurity, we have rescued more than one billion pounds of fresh, nutritious food and delivered it—free of charge—to hundreds of food pantries, soup kitchens, community partners, and our own Mobile Markets® across the five boroughs. This year, we will rescue and distribute more than 77 million pounds of nutritious food to our neighbors in need. By redirecting that food to families, we will also prevent the equivalent of more than 20 million kilograms of CO2 from entering the atmosphere. Named one of America’s Top 100 Charities by Forbes, City Harvest also works alongside our community partners to build their capacity, expand nutrition education, and advocate for systems change through effective public policy. Since our founding in 1982, City Harvest has always been there to feed our city—one day, one meal, one New Yorker at a time."
