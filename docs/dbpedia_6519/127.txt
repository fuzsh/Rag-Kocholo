At our New York facility, 12 teaching kitchens and six lecture spaces extend over a single floor, focusing the energy of our cooking classes and enhancing our students' day-to-day educational experience. It's an environment that encourages exchange and innovation, integrating all of ICE's culinary offerings: four accredited career training programs, two professional certificate programs, continuing education for chefs and industry professionals, classes for home cooks and special events.

Our New York career students also enjoy a greater sense of community through expanded social and study spaces, including a student lounge with floor-to-ceiling windows and a comprehensive culinary library — all just steps from Brookfield's riverfront park with spaces for dining, meetings and relaxation.

Beyond its impressive architecture, our Brookfield Place location features a five-acre outdoor plaza and marina — one of New York City’s premier spots for Hudson River access and views. The Brookfield building itself includes a soaring four story, palm tree-filled atrium called the “Winter Garden.”

What’s more, Brookfield is situated at the center of one of New York City’s major transportation hubs, featuring connections to 11 subway lines, 33 bus routes, the PATH train system and 3 ferries. An underground passage connects the World Trade Center Transportation Hub and Fulton Street Transit Center under West Street with a dedicated entrance into Brookfield Place.
