Pleasant near Eglinton, which he says serves up \"the best croissants in the city.\"\n\nTory was less decisive when asked where he likes to get pizza in Toronto, saying, \"I can't really answer that question.\" When pressed, he shouted out North of Brooklyn and other joints as part of the new wave of pizza in the city, while noting that to him, a pizza is more or less just a pizza."
