Readers probably won’t be surprised to know there have been many behind-the-scenes tales over the years of Alberta politicians who had affairs. I won’t name any of them, but I can tell you the gossip involved people from different parties and different orders of government, including some in very powerful positions.\n\nTo my knowledge, few — and perhaps none — of these stories were ever seriously pursued by the mainstream media in this province.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nJohn Tory resigns as Toronto mayor admits affair with staffer\n\nA 'lefty' mayor elected in Toronto would lead to 'disaster:' Doug Ford\n\n10/3 podcast: The undoing of Toronto Mayor John Tory\n\nThere are a couple of ways to look at these questions.\n\nOn the one hand, Tory’s resignation signals a welcome return of shame. For a while now, we’ve seen more and more politicians refusing any repercussions for anything, and even celebrating their misbehaviour as some sort of unhinged defence of freedom.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAs such, it’s refreshing to see a political figure maintain some moral compass, actually acknowledge wrongdoing and accept consequences.\n\nAnd yet, keeping in mind there might be more to Tory’s transgression than we have heard so far, it is odd to me that an inter-office affair between consenting adults should be the place where a line is drawn in the sand.\n\nAfter all, we have seen political leaders use their offices to enrich themselves and their friends, repeatedly lie or hide information, lay false accusations against their opponents, make policy based on conspiracy theories, try to coerce independent agencies, and further enable discrimination and corruption.\n\nTo me, that kind of behaviour directly speaks to a leader’s job performance far more than what sort of romantic relationship they pursue when the parlances and policy decisions are done for the day.\n\nThat leads to the question of what standard of public interest the media should hold when deciding whether to report on their private lives.\n\nSometimes it is clearly justified, when dealing with cases of sexual misconduct.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut much of the time these are difficult decisions, and I don’t want to unfairly criticize those journalists who decided to publish their findings about Tory. With his story, I suspect what helped tip the scales toward publishing is the fact that this was a relationship between boss and subordinate.\n\nThat power imbalance is significant, because it can complicate work dynamics — including promotions, perks, dismissals, pay, etc. — and also call into question whether the romantic relationship is truly consensual. It’s also fair to say that people in power, especially men, have been getting away with such behaviour forever, while their partners wind up with most of the consequences.\n\nThat clearly isn’t fair, and yet it is still not a slam dunk to me that public outing and loss of position should be the outcome in every one of these scenarios.\n\nEither way, I have also heard from people who believe any kind of adultery from a political leader should be reported and should lead to that person losing their job. As the argument goes, it speaks to someone’s character if they betray their spouse and family, so what other ethical abuses might they be capable of?\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThis is where I think we can get ourselves in trouble.\n\nI can’t speak for all other journalists who have covered politics in Alberta, but I think one of the main reasons there has been a reluctance to pursue stories of adultery is a belief in Canada — possibly waning — that our democracy is better off when we allow politicians to have some semblance of privacy.\n\nI look at the political dysfunction in the United States, where every dinner out, every vacation and every text message can become red meat for the grinder. That has to discourage good people from running for office, and instead seems to embolden personalities who enjoy being in the mud.\n\nLikewise, I also think we need to get over the idea of depicting elected officials as role models. Yes, I know many of those officials portray themselves that way and even use their families to present a wholesome brand — many also pounce on personal failings of opponents — but we would be wise to treat that with caution.\n\nExtremely high standards should be expected for on-the-job performance, but extending that to private matters will inevitably lead to disappointment.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIt should be obvious by now that political leaders are subject to human frailty as much as anyone else. Publishing details about all of those moments hurts not just them, but also their loved ones, including children. We need to always ask if the public interest outweighs that damage.\n\nMoreover, demanding an automatic resignation for infidelity I fear puts us on a slippery slope toward an unreachable standard, where second chances become unthinkable. In this vein, I just can’t get behind the idea that a flawed home life always reflects on someone’s job abilities.\n\nIn the case of Tory, who was just re-elected last fall, I suspect a lot of Torontonians would prefer he apologize, vow to do better, and then get on with the work he was elected to do, rather than throw his civic government into turmoil.\n\nI know many of you will disagree, but I think we need to maintain some reasonableness and save the extreme reactions for when it really matters. I would be dismayed to see Canada head further down the path of lost thresholds seen in other places, because there is truth in the adage that we get the leaders we deserve.\n\nkgerein@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
