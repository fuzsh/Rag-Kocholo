        "text": "News Release\n\nJune 7, 2022\n\nMayor John Tory officially launches Toronto Seniors Housing Corporation – a seniors-focused social housing provider\n\nToday, Mayor John Tory officially launched the Toronto Seniors Housing Corporation (TSHC) and the official start of its operations as a seniors-focused social housing provider in Toronto.\n\nMayor Tory was joined by Deputy Mayor Ana Bailão (Davenport), Councillor Paula Fletcher (Toronto Danforth), TSHC Board Vice-Chair Lawrence D’Souza, TSHC CEO Tom Hunter, and TSHC tenants to celebrate the launch.\n\nOver time, the TSHC team will work with tenants and stakeholders to co-create the organization’s mission, vision and values, establish a tenant engagement system, build out the integrated service model and develop programs that enable senior tenants (ages 59 and over) to age in place with dignity and in comfort.\n\nWholly-owned by the City, TSHC was created in 2021 as an important part of the City’s Tenants First plan. Council direction was provided for the TSHC to assume operating responsibility for 83 seniors-designated buildings owned by Toronto Community Housing Corporation (TCHC).\n\nThe new TSHC has already welcomed employees who previously worked for TCHC’s Seniors Housing Unit. TSHC is now the landlord for the nearly 15,000 tenants who live in the seniors-designated buildings. TCHC will continue to own the buildings and be responsible for capital repairs.\n\nIn association with the launch, a tree will be planted and a commemorative plaque installed outside the building at 145 Strathmore Blvd. – one of four TSHC regional offices.\n\nEvents at the other three regional offices across the city will follow in the coming days:\n\nWednesday, June 8, 10 a.m., 3050 Bathurst St.\n\nThursday, June 9, 10 a.m., 100 Cavell Ave.\n\nFriday, June 10, 10 a.m., 1700 Finch Ave. E.\n\nInformation about TSHC is available on the Toronto Seniors Housing Corporation website: www.torontoseniorshousing.ca\n\nInformation about Tenants First is available on the City’s Tenants First webpage: www.toronto.ca/tenantsfirst\n\nInformation about TCHC is available on the Toronto Community Housing website: www.torontohousing.ca\n\nQuotes:\n\n“My congratulations and best wishes to the Toronto Seniors Housing team as they step into their critical role as a social housing provider to seniors in Toronto. The creation of the Toronto Seniors Housing Corporation delivers on a commitment we made to provide seniors with safe, well-maintained homes and improved living conditions, services and experiences and to lay the foundation for that by having an organization in place which could focus exclusively on seniors housing. This is an important milestone in the City’s Tenants First vision coming to life, and I would like to thank all those who made today’s important milestone possible.”\n\n– Mayor John Tory\n\n“The creation of the Toronto Seniors Housing Corporation is an important part of the City’s Tenants First vision, a plan to ensure tenants who are seniors have access to the right services and are active participants in their communities. Congratulations to the Toronto Community Housing and Toronto Seniors Housing teams for their work on this transition and launch.”\n\n– Deputy Mayor Ana Bailão (Davenport), Chair of the Housing and Planning Committee\n\n“Today’s launch is an exciting step forward in the City’s expanded efforts to deliver exceptional care for our seniors. Through an integrated service model, Toronto Seniors Housing can better meet the needs of its tenants and enable them to age where they live, in comfort and with dignity. ”\n\n– Deputy Mayor Michael Thompson (Scarborough Centre), Chair of the Economic and Community Development\n\n“The launch of the new Toronto Seniors Housing Corporation is an exciting step for the City. It will ensure that these senior tenants have better access to the housing, health, and community supports they need.”\n\n– Councillor Paula Fletcher (Toronto-Danforth)\n\n“We expect to receive services tailored to all seniors in the portfolio, such as cleaning, repairs and safety and security. It is important to maintain a secure, safe environment for seniors living here who may not have family members or relatives close by. We hope our daily lives will get better with more activities tailor-made for seniors and organized by Toronto Seniors Housing Corporation.”\n\n– Sinan Wu, Toronto Seniors Housing tenant\n\n“Today, Toronto Seniors Housing begins to put down roots in the communities we serve. This is an exciting opportunity to rethink the way social housing and supports can be tailored to the needs of seniors. A tremendous amount of work preceded today’s milestone, and the Board extends its sincere thanks to the senior staff and transition team, our partners at Toronto Community Housing and the City of Toronto, and to the Senior Tenants Advisory Committee and other tenant leaders who have generously advised and guided us. Thank you.”\n\n– Lawrence D’Souza, Vice-Chair, Toronto Seniors Housing Board of Directors\n\n“As we transition to an operating landlord and celebrate the exceptional, collaborative efforts that led to this moment, we at Toronto Seniors Housing are keenly aware of the momentous task ahead. Tenants are counting on us to provide more than just a place to live. We must and we will connect people with the supports that will help them stay in their homes, have successful tenancies and enjoy a better quality of life. We embark upon this journey with humility and openness, looking to listen and learn and to co-create our corporation with the people who work here and the people we serve. My sincere thanks go to all who have brought us to this moment. We know that we can count on your continued support and partnership as we move forward.”\n\n– Tom Hunter, CEO, Toronto Seniors Housing\n\n“On this historic day, I congratulate CEO Tom Hunter, the Toronto Seniors Housing transition team led by Michael Sherar, and all our former Seniors Housing Unit employees who have transferred to the new corporation. Staff of both corporations and the City have done an incredible amount of hard work to make the transition as smooth as possible. Toronto Community Housing looks forward to working collaboratively with Toronto Seniors Housing as aligned organizations contributing to the City’s vision of better housing for seniors.”\n\n– Jag Sharma, President and CEO, Toronto Community Housing\n\nToronto is home to more than 2.9 million people whose diversity and experiences make this great city Canada’s leading economic engine and one of the world’s most diverse and livable cities.
