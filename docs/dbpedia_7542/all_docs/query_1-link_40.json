Mr. Tory put his private interests first. He also did not follow the guidance in the Preamble to arrange his private affairs in a manner that promotes public confidence and bears close public scrutiny.”\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nToronto Mayor John Tory submits formal resignation after staffer affair\n\n10/3 podcast: The undoing of Toronto Mayor John Tory\n\nThe woman, who the commissioner does not name, worked in the mayor’s office from January 2018 to March 2021, and she and Tory began a consensual personal relationship in the summer of 2020, the report said. Tory broke it off via email after his wife discovered the relationship, but later resumed it, the report said.\n\nBatty said Tory also violated the code of conduct when he voted on matters that had affected Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, where the woman went to work after leaving city hall.\n\nTory, in a response included in the report, said he should have sought the commissioner’s advice on how to appropriately handle the matter.\n\n“I’m also sorry for the impact that mistake has had on so many people in my life and on the people of Toronto,” he wrote.\n\nThe woman told the commissioner that the month after their relationship became public and Tory resigned was one of the worst of her life.\n\n“(What) the media has said, how they’ve embellished on Mr. Tory’s statement is not how I would — that’s not how I would describe our relationship,” the commissioner quoted her as saying in an interview with his office.\n\n“And trying to explain to people that I love how much somebody meant to me when there’s speculation in the media that’s inaccurate has been a lot. I’m tired, really tired.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.
