        "text": "The sudden resignation of John Tory as mayor of Toronto comes after he publicly revealed he had been in a relationship with a former staff member that began during the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving many to wonder what comes next.\n\nTory, now 68, was born into a successful family with a major law firm, Torys, founded by his grandfather.\n\nTory worked for Rogers-owned radio stations before getting into politics. He worked in then-premier Bill Davis’s Progressive Conservative government in the early 1980s.\n\nHe’d later work as a lawyer while also serving on campaigns for then-prime minister Brian Mulroney, as well as his successor Kim Campbell in 1993.\n\nIn 1995, Tory moved over to run Rogers Media as its CEO and president. He took the helm of the company’s cable division around the turn of the millennium\n\nDuring that stretch he also served as the Canadian Football League’s commissioner.\n\nHere’s a look at Tory’s time in office.\n\nNovember 2003 election — Tory makes first run at mayor\n\nAfter years in politics, Tory ran for the first time in November 2003 election for mayor of Toronto, finishing in second place behind councillor David Miller.\n\nMiller would serve as mayor of Toronto until 2010.\n\nTory elected leader of Ontario Progressive Conservative Party\n\nTory won his seat during a 2005 by-election, becoming MPP for the riding of Dufferin-Peel Wellington-Grey. In 2007, Tory, who was then running for a seat in Toronto’s Don Valley West riding in Toronto, lost the race to Liberal and then-education minister Kathleen Wynne. Tory’s controversial campaign promise to extend public funding to religious schools led the Progressive Conservatives to a disappointing showing overall.\n\n2009 — Tory steps down as Conservative Party leader\n\nTory tried to regain a seat in the legislature after caucus member Laurie Scott gave up her Haliburton-Kawartha Lakes-Brock seat so he could run in a byelection there, but he lost that race as well and later resigned as party leader.\n\nTory returns to broadcasting\n\nTory, who started his career as a journalist for Rogers’ Toronto radio stations CFTR and CHFI, returned as the host of a daily three-hour afternoon radio show called The Live Drive on Newstalk 1010 before waded back into politics to take another run as mayor.\n\nFebruary 2014 — Tory enters Toronto mayoral race\n\nTory registered as a candidate for the 2014 Toronto mayoral election on February 24. He faced off against scandal-plagued incumbent Mayor Rob Ford, running on a platform of change, a transit vision for the city and low taxes. With weeks to go before the election, Rob Ford pulled out of the race after being diagnosed with cancer. Doug Ford, the mayor’s older brother and councillor of his old ward, stepped in to run in his stead. The final results were closer than expected, with Tory elected after receiving 40.3 per cent of the vote and Doug Ford receiving 33.7 per cent. Olivia Chow (23.2 per cent) placed third.\n\nTory popular during first term, criticized for SmartTrack system\n\nOne of his campaign promises was to restore transit services. Tory announced his Toronto relief plan, called SmartTrack, providing electric commuter rail along existing GOTrain infrastructure from Unionville to Toronto Pearson Airport. It didn’t sit well with some members of the public, noting that SmartTrack wasn’t as expansive as what Tory initially promised.\n\nOctober 2018 — Tory re-elected\n\nTory would be re-elected, defeating former chief city planner Jennifer Keesmaat with 63 per cent of the vote.\n\n2019-present — Tory leads Toronto’s COVID-19 pandemic response\n\nThe first-ever COVID-19 case detected in Canada is confirmed in Toronto on January 23, 2020.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Ford’s government declared its first state of emergency during the pandemic. Days later, Tory would follow suit, declaring a local state of emergency on March 23, 2020.\n\nTory and Toronto’s medical officer of health introduced mask requirements in all public indoor settings on July 7, 2020. On July 31, 2020, Toronto was admitted into Stage 3 of the province’s reopening plan, loosening public health restrictions.\n\nAs the province experienced a COVID-19 wave into the fall, on November 23, 2020, Tory announced that Toronto would be placed under lockdown. That remained intact until Ford and the province declared an Ontario-wide shutdown on December 26, 2020.\n\nVaccines began to roll out, with the first doses administered to healthcare workers in the University Health Network (UHN) in Toronto. Tory would cancel many city-wide events as a result of the pandemic, and schools were temporarily closed in April 2021.\n\nRELATED: John Tory steps down as Toronto’s mayor after relationship with former staffer\n\nMay 2020 — ActiveTO launched\n\nTory announces the ActiveTO program being developed by Toronto Public Health and Transportation Services to “provide more space for people walking and cycling as well as transit riders to allow for better physical distancing as part of the city’s restart and recovery.”\n\nJune 2020 — Calls grow for police reform\n\nIn the wake of George Floyd’s death at the hands of U.S. police officers and the death of Toronto woman Regis Korchinski-Paquet, city councillors Josh Matlow and Kristyn Wong-Tam submitted a motion to cut the Toronto police budget by $122 million. Tory would reject the proposal.\n\nAs part of the city’s response, Tory announced the implementation of a non-police crisis response pilot program and $5 million in funding to allow for front-line officers to be equipped with body cameras.\n\nSummer 2021 — Tory defends Toronto police dismantling homeless encampments\n\nTory consistently insisted that homeless encampments be cleared in Toronto, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. He said the city would continue to clear out encampments, many of which he claimed are empty tents and structures that pose a danger and interfere with the use of public parks by citizens.\n\nThis led to heated clashes with officers in city parks, and several arrests were made. Tory was strongly criticized for his response after his government spent nearly $2 million to clear homeless encampments at three parks in the summer of 2021.\n\nJuly 2022 — Tory investigated for ties to Rogers\n\nThe City of Toronto’s integrity commissioner launched an investigation into Tory’s ties to Rogers. The decision arrived after a complaint that the mayor was in a conflict of interest over a city council vote on ActiveTO road closures.\n\nThe commissioner found that Toronto’s mayor did not break any conflict of interest rules and exonerated him.\n\nRELATED: What’s the process for having a new mayor in Toronto?\n\nOctober 2022 — Tory re-elected as mayor for third term\n\nTory cruised to a third mayoral term less than four months ago after a campaign that saw him tout his years of experience in the city’s top office, garnering 62 per cent of the vote compared to about 18 per cent for progressive urbanist Gil Penalosa.\n\nDecember 2022 — Tory granted strong mayor powers\n\nRecent legislation from Ford’s government granted Toronto strong mayor powers in return for helping build houses quickly. Tory supported the controversial measure introduced by Premier Ford.\n\nJanuary 2023 — Tory’s response to TTC violence\n\nTory and the Toronto police force announced that more than 80 officers would be at Toronto Transit Commission locations to reduce victimization, prevent crimes of opportunity and enhance public safety. Tory has said increased police on the TTC is one part of addressing safety issues, and the city will continue investing in mental health and addiction treatment and anti-violence programs.\n\nFebruary 2023 — Tory steps down\n\nTory announced Friday he was resigning from the job due to an “inappropriate relationship” he had with a former member of his staff.\n\nRELATED: Here’s Toronto Mayor John Tory’s full resignation statement\n\nFiles from The Canadian Press were used in this report"
