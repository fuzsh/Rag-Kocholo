He has worked to make the city government more modern and effective, to deliver better services at a more competitive price, and to be more open and accountable to the public.\n\nBorn and raised in Toronto, Mayor Tory has spent his career giving back to the city he loves working with organizations like the United Way, St. Michaelâs Hospital and Civic Action. In office, he has been a constant champion for Toronto, securing billions of dollars from the provincial and federal governments for transit, housing and other vital infrastructure. He uses his experience leading organizations and businesses to promote Toronto on the world stage, attract jobs and investment, and secure the cityâs future as a global capital.\n\nMayor Tory began his career practicing law in Toronto, and he was later elected as a managing partner of one of Canadaâs biggest law firms. In the 1980s he served as Principal Secretary to Premier Bill Davis and as Associate Secretary of the Ontario Cabinet. He has served as Commissioner of the Canadian Football League and as CEO of Rogers, one of the countryâs largest cable companies. His time in politics dates back to 2004 when he was chosen to lead the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, later serving as Leader of the Official Opposition at Queenâs Park.\n\nMayor Tory is a lifelong, and long-suffering, Toronto Maple Leafs fan â and is an avid supporter of all Torontoâs teams and attractions. Mayor Tory and his wife Barbara have been married for 39 years, have four children and five grandchildren."
