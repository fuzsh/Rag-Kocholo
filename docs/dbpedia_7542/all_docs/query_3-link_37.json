        "text": "February 23, 2023\n\nMany politicians have survived sex scandals and still held onto their jobs. But news about John Tory’s affair has brought an end to his career as Toronto mayor. Here’s what’s unique about Tory’s case.\n\nDecember 14, 2022\n\nMayors are generally successful in getting their policy preferences enacted. That’s why Ontario’s Bill 39 isn’t really necessary.\n\nAugust 20, 2020\n\nAmidst calls to defund the police, political leaders are increasing police budgets, arguing — incorrectly — that increasing police surveillance capacities will help provide accountability.\n\nApril 2, 2020\n\nThe impacts of coronavirus on cities are extraordinarily difficult. Yet around the world, cities are responding rapidly and decisively to the crisis and its implications for urban life.\n\nJune 2, 2019\n\nA year ago, Doug Ford’s election was seen as a harbinger of a populist realignment in Ontario and Canadian politics. Now polls suggest Ford has abysmally low personal approval ratings.\n\nMay 7, 2019\n\nCanadians should invest in affordable housing. It’s a commitment to lifting the most vulnerable members of our society from the ground up — and lifting our entire country up in the process.\n\nOctober 24, 2018\n\nFaith Goldy’s third-place finish in the Toronto mayoralty race should not be dismissed. We must be watchful of the potential lessons that other far-right politicians may draw from her campaign.\n\nOctober 17, 2018\n\nToronto Mayor John Tory’s use of race-coded words to describe gun violence in Toronto, including “thugs, sewer rats and gangsters,” stokes racism and serves to justify policing Black communities.\n\nAugust 7, 2018\n\nCalls to outlaw handguns in Canada are hardly knee-jerk proposals in response to violent incidents. Instead, they’re in line with the historic Canadian trend to limit the presence of modern pistols."
