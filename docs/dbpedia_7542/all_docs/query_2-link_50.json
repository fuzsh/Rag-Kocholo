        "text": "World AIDS Day\n\nDecember 1, 2023\n\nWHEREAS today is an opportunity to raise awareness of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which when left untreated can advance to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). World AIDS Day also marks the beginning of Indigenous AIDS Awareness Week in Canada.\n\nThe year’s theme, “Let Communities Lead” focuses on the impact of individuals living with, and affected by HIV who should be recognized as leaders on the frontlines of the response. This year’s World AIDS Day is a call to action to fully enable and support these community leaders and exemplify a defining value of the global HIV/AIDS movement: “Nothing about us without us”. Through their leadership and unwavering dedication, trust is developed, resources reach those who benefit, and pathways are created for better health, full participation in the community, and the dignity of each person.\n\nResponding to HIV comes with challenges, such as funding limitations, policy and regulatory obstacles, as well as the persisting HIV stigma. However, we can overcome these challenges by prioritizing engagement with the communities most affected, empowering people living with HIV, focusing on the social determinants of health, and creating a regulatory environment that allows access to diagnostics, treatment, and care. It is important to share that HIV has changed, and now a person diagnosed with HIV can lead a long and healthy life. Additionally, scientific evidence shows that individuals living with HIV and on treatment cannot transmit the virus. This message is shared globally: “undetectable equals untransmittable.”\n\nHere in Toronto, efforts are being made to improve our city’s response to HIV/AIDS. On November 10, 2023, Toronto City Council adopted a motion to officially endorse the City of Toronto’s participation in the Fast-Track Cities Network, a partnership that unites cities from around the world to collectively address the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Toronto’s diverse and innovative population, coupled with its proactive involvement in combating HIV, positions the City uniquely to advance the HIV response.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim December 1, 2023 as “World AIDS Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nInternational Day of Persons with Disabilities\n\nDecember 3, 2023\n\nWHEREAS first observed by the United Nations in on this day in 1992,\n\nInternational Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPD) envisions a future where the needs of people with disabilities are considered and integrated in every aspect of civil society. It is a day to raise awareness of people who live with visible and invisible disabilities, celebrate the achievements of the disability community, promote the rights of people with disabilities and to raise awareness about the barriers that prevent them from fully participating in their communities.\n\nThe theme for the 2023 IDPD is “United in action to rescue and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals for, with and by persons with disabilities”. The United Nations General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that focuses on fundamental shifts in commitment, solidarity, financing, and action to ensure the inclusion of voices, needs and priorities of persons with disabilities in all their diversity. This approach builds on the principle of leaving no one behind in achieving sustainable development for all.\n\nTransformative solutions that involve public-private sector cooperation to develop strategies for, with and by people with disabilities, along with the active participation of diverse people with disabilities in the decision-making process are some ways in which we can work towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe City of Toronto strives to become a leader in accessibility and disability inclusion through its policies, procedures, and daily operations. The City of Toronto is committed to accessibility and the goals of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA), and is working to identify, prevent and remove barriers to equitable access in Toronto so we can collectively move beyond accessibility legislation towards inclusion and celebration for persons with disabilities.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim December 3, 2023 as “International Day of Persons with Disabilities” in the City of Toronto.\n\nNational Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women\n\nDecember 6, 2023\n\nWHEREAS in 1991, the Parliament of Canada designated every December 6th as the “National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women” to commemorate the victims of the massacre at École Polytechnique Montreal, where 14 women were murdered and 10 other women were injured because of their gender.\n\nToday, we reaffirm our commitment to fighting the hatred and misogyny that fuelled this horrible event, while we remember and mourn the 14 women whose lives were lost, and those that were injured by this act of violence. We keep in our thoughts all who have experienced and continue to be impacted by acts of gender related violence and acknowledge that more work is required to address this serious issue that still exists today.\n\nGender-based violence is experienced more frequently by equity-deserving communities including women, girls and gender diverse people. Today we acknowledge that we all play a role in educating ourselves, our families, and our communities about this issue and its impacts while firmly speaking out against it.\n\nToronto City Council has declared gender-based violence and intimate-partner violence to be an epidemic in Toronto. Toronto City Council also urges the provincial and federal governments to rightfully declare intimate partner and gender-based violence an epidemic.\n\nThe City of Toronto is committed to promoting fundamental human rights and ensuring that all women, girls, and gender diverse people can live in a city that recognizes and supports their needs and amplifies their rights. The City of Toronto’s Gender Equity Unit is working to improve outcomes for women, girls, and gender diverse people by developing a Gender Equity Strategy to address issues of gender inequity.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim December 6, 2023 as “National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women” in the City of Toronto.\n\nHuman Rights Day\n\nDecember 10, 2023\n\nWHEREAS today we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the adoption and proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) by the United Nations General Assembly. This landmark document proclaims that every human being is entitled to certain rights that are universally protected. It is also a day to inspire people to find a common shared humanity with others, and act when their basic rights are not being met.\n\nThe United Nations is marking this anniversary with the year-long campaign themed “Human Rights 75: Dignity, Freedom, and Justice For All”. It focuses on having a better understanding of the universal nature of the UDHR and the activism that is associated with working to ensure the rights of all people are recognized, especially those facing barriers. Young people are highlighted as being at the forefront of human rights activism, yet they experience challenges in exercising their rights.\n\nThis year’s campaign is also a call to action for member states to expand the current system of human rights protection to include equity-deserving groups including those with intersecting identities. It is an opportunity to use the UDHR as a global blueprint and life guide to ensure the rights of all people are respected and upheld and that no one is left behind.\n\nThe City of Toronto is committed to embracing the spirit of the Declaration as it works towards upholding the fundamental human rights of its residents and fostering a civil society committed to reconciliation and justice, the elimination of racism, and all forms of hate and discrimination. The City of Toronto is also working to eliminate systemic barriers that have resulted in inequality and discrimination for equity-deserving groups, including those with intersecting identities.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim December 10, 2023 as “Human Rights Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nTransit Worker Assault Awareness Day\n\nDecember 17, 2023\n\nWHEREAS today we recognize transit workers and their importance as frontline workers who keep our city moving, transporting thousands of people to every corner of the city and beyond. These essential workers are the backbone of our city, and should be respected for the critical services they provide to our residents.\n\nTransit workers, including operators and administrative staff are facing increasing amounts of verbal and physical abuse. To protect these key individuals, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) consulted with frontline workers to better understand the problems and concerns faced on a daily basis. In response, the TTC partnered with various City of Toronto Divisions to create a coordinated response to improve safety and restore confidence in the TTC as a safe place for riders and transit workers.\n\nAll transit workers have the right to be employed in a safe, healthy, and supportive work environment. We acknowledge there is still work to be done to ensure the safety and protection of frontline transit workers. To date, several safety measures have since been reinforced at the TTC to help protect frontline workers from physical and verbal abuse, harassment, and threats. We will continue to work together with the TTC and transit workers to ensure that the TTC system is a safe workplace for the workers who keep our city moving.\n\nThe City of Toronto condemns all acts of violence, harassment, or abuse against transit workers. The safety, protection and health of employees is a principal responsibility of the City of Toronto. Through its partnership with the TTC, the City of Toronto is further committed to improving the mental and physical health and safety of transit workers and their respective work environments.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim December 17, 2023 as “Transit Worker Assault Awareness Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nThe Salvation Army Week\n\nDecember 18 – 24, 2023\n\nWHEREAS the Salvation Army offers multiple community-based services in 400 communities across Canada, which provide help and support to many including residents in our city. Since its establishment in 1882, the Salvation Army has grown to become one of the largest non-governmental providers of social services across the country.\n\nThe Salvation Army Week takes place during the last week of the organization’s Christmas Kettle Campaign. The Christmas Kettle stations located across our city, are accepting donations to help support the Salvation Army’s essential programs.\n\nResidents are encouraged to embrace the spirit of hope and joy during the festive season, while finding ways to help everyone in our city feel appreciated and supported during the holidays.\n\nThe City of Toronto acknowledges the valued efforts of all those who volunteer their time over the holiday season in support of providing for residents in need. The City of Toronto also recognizes the important work of charities and non-profits, and their significant contributions to the well-being of our communities.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim December 18 – 24, 2023 as “The Salvation Army Week” in the City of Toronto.\n\nKwanzaa Week\n\nDecember 26, 2023 – January 1, 2024\n\nWHEREAS first recognized in 1966 by Dr. Maulana Karenga, Kwanzaa is a celebration of Afrocentric values, beliefs, ancestry, heritage, and culture, that has officially been celebrated in Canada since 1993. Kwanzaa comes from the Swahili phrase “matanda ya kwanza” signifying “first fruits” of the harvest.\n\nThe seven-day long celebration of Kwanzaa is marked by candles placed in a holder called a kinara. Each day a candle representing one of the seven principles of Kwanzaa is lit: Umoja (unity), Kujichagulia (self-determination), Ujima (collective work and responsibility), Ujamaa (cooperative economics), Nia (purpose), Kuumba (creativity) and Imani (faith) that are collectively called Nguzo Saba. There is also symbolism in the colours of the seven candles in the kinara. Three red candles represent the global struggles of African peoples and the African diaspora, a black candle in the middle symbolizes people of African descent and the earth, and three green candles represent hope and the future. Together, these candles represent the colours of the Pan-African flag, which symbolizes unity among African people.\n\nThe City of Toronto is proud to recognize Kwanzaa Week and remains committed to continue the important work of promoting respect, equity, and systemic change for people of African descent. Through the Toronto Action Plan to Confront Anti-Black Racism, the City of Toronto has implemented several initiatives to remove barriers and make systemic changes to eliminate anti-Black racism in City services, planning, policies, and spaces. The Confronting Anti-Black Racism (CABR) Unit continues to carry out these initiatives and align its goals with those of the United Nation’s International Decade for People of African Descent.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim December 26, 2023 – January 1, 2024 as “Kwanzaa Week” in the City of Toronto.\n\nDomestic Violence Awareness Month\n\nNovember 2023\n\nWHEREAS domestic abuse or domestic violence can be any pattern of behaviour in a relationship used to gain or maintain power or control over an intimate partner. It can include several forms of abuse such as physical, verbal, psychological, economic, and sexual abuse.\n\nDomestic violence can take place within a range of relationships including couples who are married, living together or dating. While anyone can be a victim of domestic abuse, it is sad to note that in 2021, eight out of 10 victims or 79 per cent of victims who reported intimate partner violence were women and girls.\n\nMany may be afraid to leave their abusive situations and might not know where to turn to for help. We can help survivors of domestic violence by striving to better understand the many different forms of domestic violence, recognizing the signs and symptoms, and helping survivors of domestic violence find the proper supports when they ask for help. We can also help by listening and letting survivors know they are not alone.\n\nEarlier this year, Toronto City Council declared gender-based violence and intimate-partner violence to be an epidemic in Toronto. City Council is urging the Provincial and Federal Governments to rightfully declare intimate partner and gender-based violence an epidemic and enact the additional 85 recommendations from the inquest into the 2015 murders of Carol Culleton, Anastasia Kuzyk and Nathalie Warmerdam.\n\nThe City of Toronto’s Domestic/Intimate Partner Violence Policy supports employees who may be experiencing domestic violence. They are encouraged to contact the City of Toronto’s Employee Assistance Program by calling 416-392-6633 so they can confidentially receive the necessary supports they may require.\n\nThe City of Toronto has also partnered with community agencies to develop and implement #HereToHelpTO, to raise awareness and connect residents to the various social service agencies, programs, and supports that are available to residents experiencing violence or abuse.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 2023 as “Domestic Violence Awareness Month” in the City of Toronto.\n\nHindu Heritage Month\n\nNovember 2023\n\nWHEREAS Canada is home to approximately 830,000 Canadians of Hindu Heritage. This month provides a wonderful opportunity to recognize and celebrate them and the many members of the Hindu community who live in Toronto.\n\nDuring Hindu Heritage Month, residents are also encouraged to learn more about the community’s rich culture, diverse heritage, deep history and traditions, as well as the many ways that Hindu Canadians have contributed to the fabric of our city and country.\n\nThis community forms an important part of Toronto’s motto: “Diversity Our Strength.” During this month, we acknowledge with gratitude the many significant socio-economic and cultural contributions that the Hindu community has made and continues to make to our city.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 2023 as “Hindu Heritage Month” in the City of Toronto.\n\nIndigenous Disability Awareness Month\n\nNovember 2023\n\nWHEREAS during Indigenous Disability Awareness Month (IDAM), we celebrate the valued contributions of Indigenous Peoples with disabilities. Indigenous Peoples often believe “disabilities” are gifts from the Creator. As we honour and celebrate Indigenous Peoples with disabilities, we also recognize that they continue to face barriers to their active participation in society.\n\nThe Indigenous population of Canada experiences a disability rate that is higher (1 in 3) than that of the general population (1 in 5). When coupled with other barriers such as systemic racism and oppressive colonialist attitudes, Indigenous Peoples with disabilities face daunting unemployment, poverty, housing, health inequities and challenges when seeking out daily supports. Many geographically remote Indigenous communities also face additional obstacles such as transportation issues, further limiting access to community amenities, and health and social services. They become isolated from their communities and must leave their homes and support systems behind when they need to access care.\n\nAs part of the City of Toronto’s Reconciliation Action Plan 2022-2032, the City is committed to working with the diverse Indigenous communities of Toronto and recognizes that their voices must be involved in decision-making processes. We acknowledge the ongoing colonialism, while also recognizing the sovereign Indigenous rights, strengths, courage and resilience of Indigenous Peoples. By engaging with Indigenous Peoples with disabilities and Indigenous leaders and health care partners, the City can work with them to create equitable access through programs and services uniquely designed to meet current needs and rectify service deficiencies.\n\nThe City of Toronto respects and honours the lived experiences of Indigenous Peoples with disabilities, and is committed to creating a safe, inclusive, accessible environment where everyone can receive the necessary supports. We are committed to being an inclusive city that considers the needs of all residents, including the unique needs of Indigenous and disabled residents, in city policies and in future planning. We are also committed to being disability aware by embedding accessibility and universal design principles to help make city buildings accessible and accommodating environments.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 2023 as “Indigenous Disability Awareness Month” in the City of Toronto.\n\nLung Cancer Awareness Month\n\nNovember 2023\n\nWHEREAS lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Canada. Approximately 1 in 30 Canadians will be diagnosed with lung and bronchus cancer in their lifetime with an estimated 98 per cent of cases occurring in people who are aged 50 or older. Smoking, second hand smoke, a family history of cancer, and environmental pollutants can all be factors that may lead to a lung cancer diagnosis. While there is no cure for lung cancer, early detection through screening can save lives.\n\nWe can give our support to those living with lung cancer by advocating for lung cancer research, screening and treatment, and encouraging people to seek medical attention if they have symptoms and feel unwell.\n\nThe City gratefully acknowledges organizations that help to raise awareness of diseases and conditions that impact our residents, while offering them supports to live with these diseases.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 2023 as “Lung Cancer Awareness Month” in the City of Toronto.\n\nTake Our Kids to Work Day\n\nNovember 1, 2023\n\nWHEREAS Take Our Kids to Work Day is a national job-shadowing experience for Grade 9 students, encouraging them to spend the day in a professional working environment with parents, guardians, relatives, friends or volunteers. It is a valuable learning opportunity that exposes students to a wide variety of career options and fields of work. Students learn important skills and gain hands-on experiences in a number of professional settings to help inspire them to think about their future career paths and choices.\n\nParticipants in the City of Toronto’s Take Our Kids to Work Day program will learn more about how city government works and the importance of being engaged in city politics and civic issues.\n\nAn educated community is key to a city’s sustainability. Take Our Kids to Work Day is a chance for youth to explore the importance of education and skills development. The City of Toronto supports students as they begin to navigate their journey into becoming working professionals.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 1, 2023 as “Take Our Kids to Work Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nDía de Muertos\n\nNovember 2, 2023\n\nWHEREAS today we mark Día de Muertos, the Day of the Dead, a culturally significant day with roots of the celebration tracing back to the Aztec people, who held rituals to honour the dead. Today, Mexican and Latin American communities celebrate the day both in Toronto and across the globe.\n\nDuring present Día de Muertos celebrations, families celebrate their deceased loved ones with special traditions, such as building altars, which are thought to help them briefly reunite with the souls of those who have died. The altars include photos and items of their loved ones and symbolic items representing the four elements of life, namely water, earth, fire, and wind. Sweets such as pan de muerto and sugar skulls feature prominently on the altars and are surrounded by marigolds which are believed to help guide the souls home. Skulls and skeletons, often portrayed as La Calavera Catrina, or Elegant Skull, continue to remind people of their own mortality as part of the natural circle of life. These rituals have evolved and still remain important symbols of the celebration.\n\nDia de Muertos is a time of joyful celebration and reflection to honour all that we have lost rather than to mourn. We acknowledge rich traditions like these that contribute to the cultural fabric of our city and form an important part of Toronto’s motto: “Diversity Our Strength”.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 2, 2023, as “Día de Muertos” in the City of Toronto.\n\nRemembrance Week\n\nNovember 5 – 11, 2023\n\nWHEREAS during Remembrance Week, we honour and pay our respects to all Canadian veterans who have served and continue to serve to uphold the peace and freedoms we enjoy today. We also pause on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, to remember those who paid the ultimate price to protect our freedoms.\n\nIn 2023, we mark the 70th anniversary of the Korean War Armistice. Nearly 30,000 Canadians served on land, sea and in the air during the conflict, which began in 1950. The Korean Armistice Agreement, signed in July 1953, brought an end to the fighting but it did not bring an end to the conflict. Sadly, 516 Canadians were killed during the Korean War and approximately 38 of them had connections to Toronto.\n\nWe also remember Canadian peacekeepers who, as members of the Canadian Forces, have taken part in many operations to keep the peace in countries around the world over the past 75 years, sometimes at the steep cost of their lives.\n\nThe City of Toronto acknowledges the bravery, courage and sacrifices of all Canadian veterans who fought for the peace and freedom we enjoy today, in times of war, in peacekeeping operations, and in times of need here at home and abroad. In the face of many global challenges, we continue to honour both those who have served, and those who continue to serve, along with their families.\n\nDuring Remembrance Week, I encourage Toronto residents to support the Royal Canadian Legion by purchasing and wearing a poppy in memory of the more than 100,000 Canadians who gave their lives.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 5 – 11, 2023 as “Remembrance Week” in the City of Toronto.\n\nTreaties Recognition Week\n\nNovember 5 – 11, 2023\n\nWHEREAS for thousands of years, Indigenous people have lived on the land now called Canada with their own cultures, traditions and ways of being and knowing. Since 1701, the British Government and later, the Canadian government, and Indigenous communities entered into several treaties that defined the respective rights of Indigenous peoples and European newcomers to use North American lands that Indigenous peoples traditionally occupied. The treaties were put in place to support peaceful economic and military relations. These treaties formed a framework for living and sharing land traditionally owned by Indigenous Peoples. Over time, these agreements became eroded because of colonialist worldviews and systemic discrimination against Indigenous Peoples.\n\nTreaties Recognition Week began in 2016 in response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Final Report that was released in 2015, which sought to increase treaty awareness and provide the public with an important opportunity to learn why treaties matter. It offers a valuable opportunity to listen to Indigenous voices and understand the impact of treaty violations on Indigenous families and communities. The Government of Canada has officially recognized 70 historic treaties that are shared with 364 First Nations communities and represent over 600,000 First Nations peoples in Canada. The Federal government has begun making reparations in fulfilling these past agreements, as it begins the journey of reconciliation and addresses the negative impacts of a long history of colonialism.\n\nThere are 133 First Nations communities in Ontario alone, that belong to a complex system of treaty obligations, federal-provincial division of powers and jurisdictions, and constitutionally protected Aboriginal and Treaty rights. Ontario is covered by at least 46 treaties and other agreements, and Toronto is covered specifically by Treaty 13, also known as the Toronto Purchase and the Williams Treaties.\n\nThe word “Treaty” does not exist in many Indigenous Languages. When Indigenous people look at treaties, they look at the agreements that have been made before treaties, as One Dish with One Spoon Wampum. The teachings of the agreement focus on the earth being one dish that provides for us all, and we collectively have only one spoon to use in sharing all of the earth’s resources. Therefore, you take only what you need and you always leave something in the dish for others, and you look after the dish carefully.\n\nThough many of these treaties were signed more than a century ago, treaty commitments are as valid today as when they were first signed, and we are all treaty people who are obligated to abide by them. The treaty relationship as well as new treaties are based on a foundation of recognition of rights, respect, co-operation, and partnership with Indigenous Peoples.\n\nDuring Treaties Recognition week, everyone is encouraged to learn more about treaties and treaty rights that govern the lands on which they live. By educating ourselves about our collective treaty rights and agreements, we can make meaningful progress towards truth, justice, and reconciliation.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 5 – 11, 2023 as “Treaties Recognition Week” in the City of Toronto.\n\nInuit Day\n\nNovember 7, 2023\n\nWHEREAS today on the birthdate of the founder of the Inuit Circumpolar Council, Eben Hopson, we celebrate the rich culture, history, and significant contributions of Inuit. Approximately 180,000 Inuit who live in the circumpolar Arctic and Sub-Arctic regions of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia are represented by the Inuit Circumpolar Council on matters of international importance. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the first circumpolar meeting of Arctic Indigenous Peoples.\n\nToday is also a day to raise awareness of the over 64,200 Inuit who live in Canada. The Inuit culture is focused on communities with close ties to land, a dedication to community and a keen sense of self-reliance, which guides their daily living. 53 communities across Northern Canada live in Inuit Nunangat, the Inuit homeland in Canada. It is made up of the land claims regions of Nunavut, Nunavik in Northern Quebec, Nunatsiavut in Northern Labrador, and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region of the Northwest Territories.\n\nOne of the significant issues faced by the Inuit is addressing climate change in the Arctic. As part of the Arctic Peoples’ Conference in 2023, Arctic Indigenous People from all over the world including the Inuit are calling on governments to “recognize Indigenous contributions including Indigenous Knowledge, and their innovations and solutions, which are being asked to be shared, communicated, and manifested to prevent, mitigate, and adapt to climate change impacts across the Arctic.”\n\nThe City of Toronto’s Reconciliation Action Plan 2022-2032 recognizes the Inuit as original peoples of what is now called Canada and as self-determining peoples, who have Treaty, constitutional, and human rights that must be recognized and respected. As part of this Plan, The City of Toronto is committed to working towards truth, justice, and reconciliation with Inuit.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 7, 2023, as “Inuit Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nIndigenous Veterans Day\n\nNovember 8, 2023\n\nWHEREAS today on Indigenous Veterans Day, we acknowledge all Indigenous Peoples who have served and continue to serve in the Canadian Armed Forces. The First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples have a long and proud tradition of military service to what we now call Canada.\n\nMore than 12,000 First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples served to defend Canada in the War of 1812, the First and Second World Wars, in Korea and Afghanistan, as well as in UN peacekeeping. Voluntary enlistment by Indigenous Peoples was higher on a per capita basis for the World Wars than any other ethno-social community in Canada. Indigenous soldiers who transmitted sensitive messages through their Indigenous languages, “code talkers”, were instrumental in ensuring sensitive information was kept safe, which was an important factor in helping end the Second World War.\n\nIndigenous Peoples in Canada have fought on the front line of every major battle Canada has been involved in and have done so with valour and distinction. It was not until 1995, fifty years after the Second World War that Indigenous Peoples were allowed to lay Remembrance Day wreaths at the National War Memorial to remember and honour their dead comrades.\n\nMany status Indigenous soldiers had to become enfranchised before they could sign up to fight in the Second World War, which meant that when they returned to their home communities, they no longer had Indian status. This still affects many First Nations families to this day.\n\nApproximately 2,700 Indigenous Peoples are currently serving in Canadian Armed Forces in operations at home and around the world. On Indigenous Veterans Day, the City of Toronto acknowledges with gratitude the legacy and valued contributions of Indigenous military service within local communities, throughout Canada and around the world. The City of Toronto acknowledges the bravery, courage and sacrifices of all veterans who fought for the peace and freedom we enjoy today. We continue to honour Indigenous veterans while committing ourselves to having a greater respect and appreciation for their service.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 8, 2023 as “Indigenous Veterans Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nImmunization Day\n\nNovember 10, 2023\n\nWHEREAS Immunization Day is a day dedicated to highlighting the efficacy of vaccines in our city and promoting their use as a safeguard against vaccine-preventable diseases. This day also highlights the pivotal role that immunization has played in preserving lives and upholding public health not just in Toronto but globally.\n\nThe City of Toronto recognizes the profound impact that immunization has on public health outcomes and in reducing long term healthcare costs. Immunization has contributed to improved overall public health and increased life expectancy by helping to prevent the spread and severity of infectious diseases to vulnerable people in our community. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, immunizations have played and continue to play a significant role in supporting our city’s recovery.\n\nTogether, we can make a collective commitment to fortify the health and resilience of every member of our community and create a healthier environment for all through immunization.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 10, 2023 as “Immunization Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nToronto Argos Day\n\nNovember 10, 2023\n\nWHEREAS our Toronto Argonauts took to the field in their 65th season and qualified for the 2023 Canadian Football League (CFL) Playoffs, clinching first place in the East division, and securing their spot in the East Division Finals for the third straight year. This incredible feat was last achieved by the team from 1982-1984.\n\nOur defending champions began their 2023 campaign with an incredible 11-1 record, the best start to a season in their franchise history, and clinched first place, with six games remaining in the season. The Double Blue continued to assert their dominance en route to a 16-2 finish, tying the CFL record for most wins in an 18-game season. Tomorrow, the Argos will take on the Montreal Alouettes at BMO Field, as they battle to represent the East in the 110th Grey Cup.\n\nOn Toronto Argos Day, I encourage everyone in our city – and Argo fans across the country and the world – to wear the double blue to give our full appreciation and support to our team.\n\nThe City of Toronto would like to thank the players, coaches, managers, staff, and fans for an incredible 2023 season, which saw our hometown team break multiple CFL and franchise records along the way. We are extremely proud of the Toronto Argos and look forward to enthusiastically cheering them on in their post-season play.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 10, 2023 as “Toronto Argos Day” in the City of Toronto. Let’s go Argoooooos!\n\nChildren’s Grief Awareness Day\n\nNovember 16, 2023\n\nWHEREAS today we turn our attention to children in our city and across the country who are experiencing grief.\n\nGoing through the grieving process can be overwhelming for an adult and even more so for a child who is processing the loss of a parental figure, family member or friend, at a young age.\n\nGrief can have devastating impacts on children by harming their physical and mental wellbeing as well as affecting their quality of life. It may also impact their relationships with others, such as classmates and friends.\n\nGrief-stricken children may also experience sadness or depression, making it hard for them to take part in the activities they once enjoyed.\n\nToday on Children’s Grief Awareness Day, we give our support to grieving children, letting them know they are not alone as they go through the difficult journey of healing from loss. It is also an opportunity to let families know that supports are available to assist them and their children with their grieving process.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 16, 2023, as “Children’s Grief Awareness Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nLouis Riel Day\n\nNovember 16, 2023\n\nWHEREAS on this day in 1885, Louis Riel was executed for leading the Northwest Resistance in defense of the Métis people. Canada’s encroachment into the west spearheaded a forced migration for the Métis people who had originally settled in Manitoba, as they were pushed towards Saskatchewan and across Turtle Island. However, Canada’s western expansion persisted as they continued to send surveyors to plot and divide land. At risk of losing their lands entirely, Louis Riel appealed to the Government of Canada and received no assistance, leading to what is now known as the Northwest Resistance. Following the end of the resistance, Métis people were forced to hide their identities for fear of reprisal and resorted to live in hiding, becoming “the forgotten people.”\n\nThe defeat of the Northwest resistance, and the capture and subsequent hanging of Louis Riel on November 16, 1885, perpetuated hostile, racist and colonialist attitudes against Métis people that would prevail over the next century. Riel’s death would give rise to a legacy of mistreatment and abuse that would inflict lasting intergenerational trauma upon Métis and Indigenous Peoples across Canada.\n\nToday, Louis Riel is remembered as a great Métis leader, a founder of confederation, a political and spiritual leader, and an advocate for the rights of equity-deserving people.\n\nHe was declared a founder of Manitoba in 1992 and is set to receive the honorary title of Manitoba’s first premier. He is memorialized as a champion for minority rights, bilingualism, and social justice – values that define us as Canadians today.\n\nIn beginning the process of reconciliation, on August 19, 2022, the City of Toronto offered an official apology to the Métis people for its role in financially contributing to the militarized action against Métis people during the Northwest Resistance. At the time, the City of Toronto had provided supplies to the militia troops, in addition to sending hundreds of volunteer militia to suppress the resistance. With this apology, it is hoped that the Métis can begin healing from the injustices of the past, while honouring the sacrifices of their ancestors, and contributing to the pride of Métis culture and identity for future generations.\n\nThe City of Toronto recognizes Louis Riel’s contribution to Métis communities and acknowledges the contributions the Métis make to Toronto. The City is committed to supporting Indigenous communities and working together with them in fulfilling Louis Riel’s vision and advancing truth, justice and reconciliation with Indigenous people.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 16, 2023 as “Louis Riel Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nGordon Lightfoot Day\n\nNovember 17, 2023\n\nWHEREAS today on his birthday, we honour Gordon Lightfoot, a renowned musician and recording artist, who contributed immensely to Canadian arts and culture throughout his decades-long career.\n\nThough he called Toronto home for much of his life, Gordon Lightfoot was born in Orillia, Ontario, in 1938, and began performing there on local radio and in regional music festivals. He wrote his first song while in high school; he later attended music college in Los Angeles, returning to Toronto in 1959 as a choral performer and folk singer with a solid grounding in music theory. While launching his career as a singer-songwriter in Toronto’s vibrant folk-music scene in the 1960s, Gordon cited Bob Dylan as his musical inspiration.\n\nGordon soon found success with a blend of folk, soft rock, and country. His 1966 debut album, Lightfoot!, featured two instant classics: “For Loving Me” and “Ribbon of Darkness”. A few years later, Gordon’s single “If You Could Read My Mind” would catapult him to worldwide fame. His extensive catalog also included such iconic songs as “Early Morning Rain,” “Sundown,” “Canadian Railroad Trilogy,” and “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald”. His music was recorded by international legends like Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, and the Grateful Dead, and by Canadian stars like Blue Rodeo, Sarah McLachlan, and the Tragically Hip.\n\nDuring an unparalleled career spanning almost six decades, Gordon Lightfoot won 17 Juno Awards, was nominated for five Grammy Awards, and was celebrated through inductions into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame, the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the US Songwriters Hall of Fame. He was promoted to a Companion of the Order of Canada in 2003. In 2021, he was awarded the Key to the City of Toronto during the grand reopening of Massey Hall, where he performed over 170 times throughout his life.\n\nGordon maintained unbreakable bonds with Toronto. His long-time residence remained here, and he was often seen at local music venues, watching touring acts and checking out emerging local artists.\n\nGordon Lightfoot is a Toronto icon and one of Canada’s greatest artists, elevating Canadian music on stages across the world. He is a remarkable musician whose musical legacy reflects our country’s history, geography, and stories.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 17, 2023, as “Gordon Lightfoot Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nPrematurity Day\n\nNovember 17, 2023\n\nWHEREAS today we raise awareness of the 30,000 Canadian babies who are born preterm each year, their families, and those who care for them, in the first delicate weeks and months of their lives. A preterm birth is defined as babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy are completed.\n\nPrematurity Day offers an opportunity to discuss concrete actions to improve the outcomes for premature babies and their families. One of these actions is supporting parents to establish a close bond with their babies during the first weeks of their lives and while the babies are in hospital neonatal units. Parent-infant connection can help reduce mortality and morbidity, infections, hospital readmissions and helps support the lactation process in breastfeeding parents. It is important to empower parents as key caregivers by engaging them through effective communication, education, and decision-making.\n\nWe can work towards better outcomes for preterm babies by advocating for the essential supports they require to thrive.\n\nThe City of Toronto thanks organizations that are committed to raising awareness of this important issue that impact our residents.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 17, 2023 as “Prematurity Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nNational Child Day\n\nNovember 20, 2023\n\nWHEREAS on National Child Day we celebrate Canada’s commitment to upholding the rights of children. This day is also an opportunity to recognize two historic events: the signing of the UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child on November 20, 1959, as well as the adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989. Today is also Universal Children’s Day, which is a global celebration recognized by many countries around the world.\n\nCanada officially endorsed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991. This year marks the 30th anniversary of National Child Day which has been celebrated across Canada since 1993. This year’s theme #EveryChildEveryRight emphasizes that the eight million children in Canada are entitled to receive all their rights under the law, including being treated with dignity and respect, having their basic needs be met, having every opportunity to reach their full potential, being provided with opportunities to speak, and be heard, and being protected from harm.\n\nChildren are important members of our community, and we must listen to them and take their needs into consideration when we plan and make decisions on their behalf and provide them with nurturing and loving environments that ensure their personal growth and success.\n\nThe City of Toronto is committed to the well-being of children and their families and recognizes children as valued residents who bring unique ideas and perspectives to our city.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 20, 2023, as “National Child Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nTrans Day of Remembrance\n\nNovember 20, 2023\n\nWHEREAS on the Trans Day of Remembrance, we honour the Trans people who lost their lives due to transphobia and anti-transgender violence.\n\nIt is very sad to know that Two-Spirit, Trans and non-binary communities continue to experience high rates of violence, harassment, and discrimination. Today, we acknowledge the deep struggles as well as the inspiring determination and courage of Trans people to be their full selves in a world that refuses to understand them. We denounce the anti-trans rallies that took place recently in our city and province and firmly reject any form of discrimination and hate against our young Trans residents and all Trans people.\n\nTwo-Spirit, Trans and non-binary people in Toronto are our family members, friends, neighbours and co-workers who make immense contributions to our city. We can all work to help make Trans people and their communities feel welcomed as valued members of our society.\n\nThe City of Toronto strives to ensure the fundamental rights of all Torontonians. We are committed to creating a safe community for all, where people can freely express their gender, and participate fully in our society without fear of repercussion. By continuing to apply an intersectional gender-based lens in its programs and services, the City of Toronto is actively working to create an equitable and inclusive Toronto for all.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 20, 2023 as “Trans Day of Remembrance” in the City of Toronto.\n\nNational Housing Day\n\nNovember 22, 2023\n\nWHEREAS each year on November 22, we observe National Housing Day in Toronto to reflect on what we have achieved and raise awareness on what still needs to be done to ensure that all residents in this city have access to an affordable and supportive home.\n\nThe City of Toronto recognizes that safe, adequate and affordable housing is essential to the dignity and well-being of a person and necessary for building sustainable, inclusive and complete communities.\n\nThe City of Toronto continues to make significant financial investments demonstrating its leadership and commitment to addressing the housing and homelessness crisis in Toronto. Over the last two years, the City of Toronto, along with partners across sectors, has made strong progress on implementing the HousingTO 2020-2030 Action Plan. This includes advancing a human rights-based approach to housing, increasing the supply of affordable and supportive homes, protecting the existing supply of homes, assisting renters and enhancing cross-sector and intergovernmental partnerships. In addition to these joint efforts, there has been tremendous work led by Indigenous organizations, non-profit and co-operative housing providers, private sector housing providers and healthcare partners. These collective efforts have been, and will continue to be, pivotal to ensuring that all Torontonians have a stable roof over their heads.\n\nThe City of Toronto recognizes that addressing Toronto’s complex housing challenges requires a whole-of-government and whole-of-community approach. Increasing access to affordable homes and related supports for Torontonians requires new and enhanced policies, programs and investments from all orders of government. It also requires support and participation from the Indigenous, non-profit, co-operative, philanthropic, academic and business sectors, as well as society.\n\nThe City’s ongoing work to improve residents’ access to homes that meet their needs aims to make Toronto a more inclusive and equitable city. Addressing the current housing crisis is critical to supporting the social, cultural and economic growth and prosperity of Toronto, the province, and the country.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 22, 2023 as “National Housing Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nInternational Day for the Elimination of\n\nViolence against Women\n\nNovember 25, 2023\n\nWHEREAS on this day in 1981, women’s rights advocates created a day to raise awareness of gender-based violence and honour three women from the Dominican Republic, the Mirabel Sisters, who were murdered on November 25, 1960, at the request of the Dominican Republic’s dictator, Rafael Trujillo.\n\nOn February 7, 2000, The United Nations’ General Assembly officially designated November 25 as the date in which the global community could collectively raise awareness of the need to end violence against women. Today also marks the beginning of the 16 Days of Activism, an annual international campaign that begins with the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and concludes with Human Rights Day on December 10.\n\nEquity-deserving groups such as women, girls, and gender diverse people tend to experience gender-based violence much more frequently than the general population. The 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence provides an essential opportunity to call out and name gender-based violence against women and girls.\n\nIn 2008, the United Nations launched the campaign UNITE by 2030 to End Violence Against Women which runs parallel to the 16 Days of Activism campaign. The goal of the global campaign is to actively seek solutions to prevent and eliminate violence against women, girls, and gender diverse people. The 2023 theme is “UNITE! Invest to prevent violence against women and girls.” The campaign asks people to share actions they are personally taking to working towards a world that is free from violence against women and girls. It also asks world governments to share how they are investing in gender-based violence prevention.\n\nEarlier this year, Toronto City Council declared gender-based violence and intimate-partner violence to be an epidemic in Toronto. City Council is urging the Provincial and Federal Governments to rightfully declare intimate partner and gender-based violence an epidemic and enact the additional 85 recommendations from the inquest into the 2015 murders of Carol Culleton, Anastasia Kuzyk and Nathalie Warmerdam.\n\nThe City of Toronto is committed to promoting fundamental human rights and ensuring that all women, girls, and gender diverse people can live in city that recognizes and supports their needs and amplifies their rights. The City of Toronto’s Gender Equity Unit is working to improve outcomes for women, girls, and gender diverse people by developing a Gender Equity Strategy to help inform equitable program planning for women, girls and gender diverse people who make up at least 52 per cent of Toronto’s population.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 25, 2023, as “International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women” in the City of Toronto.\n\nGivingTuesday\n\nNovember 28, 2023\n\nWHEREAS GivingTuesday follows immediately after Cyber Monday to officially kick off the start of charitable giving during the holiday season. A day to encourage global giving, it provides an opportunity for Canadians to think of their local communities as well as the less fortunate while doing their holiday shopping.\n\nGivingTuesday is an opportunity to raise money for local charities and non-profits, run food and clothing drives, give blood, encourage kindness, help a neighbour and celebrate generosity. On each GivingTuesday, the collective contributions of individual residents in our communities make a positive impact.\n\nResidents are encouraged to embrace the spirit of hope and joy during the festive season, while finding ways to help everyone in our city feel appreciated and supported during the holidays.\n\nThe City of Toronto gratefully acknowledges organizations and individuals who are committed to caring for the wellbeing of our residents.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim November 28, 2023 as “GivingTuesday” in the City of Toronto.\n\nCircular Economy Month\n\nOctober 2023\n\nWHEREAS a circular economy is a way of designing, producing, and consuming that reduces waste and makes the most of the resources we have. It encourages us to rethink our systems and economies so that human activity supports the health of natural systems. A circular economy challenges us to take less, to use better, and to make sure our economies and our choices support the natural environment that we rely on.\n\nThe City of Toronto has adopted the aspirational goals of a zero waste future and of making Toronto the first city in Ontario with a circular economy. The City is working to incorporate circular economy principles into the design and delivery of our programs and services in an effort to prevent additional waste from being produced and build a greener economy and community for Toronto residents and businesses. The development of a Circular Economy Road Map will recommend actions that the City and other interested parties can take to aid the transition to a circular economy.\n\nCurrently, the City manages close to 900,000 tonnes of waste. The City’s Long Term Waste Management Strategy prioritizes waste reduction and minimizing the amount of waste sent to landfill. The Waste Strategy includes waste reduction, reuse, repurposing and recycling activities that promote resource conservation and reduce environmental impacts. The Waste Strategy also emphasizes the importance of community engagement and encourages the reduction and prevention of waste, while maximizing its value before disposal and supporting the shift towards a circular economy.\n\nCommunities, businesses, organizations and individuals all play an essential role in promoting waste reduction and the move towards a circular economy. Transitioning to a circular economy will help to build a resilient, green, and prosperous future for Toronto residents and businesses.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 2023 as “Circular Economy Month” in the City of Toronto.\n\nDwarfism Awareness and Acceptance Month\n\nOctober 2023\n\nWHEREAS during October, we raise awareness of dwarfism, a genetic, medical condition that can result in physical, psychological and societal challenges.\n\nThere are 400 types of dwarfism with varying signs and symptoms for everyone with this condition. The most common form of dwarfism is achondroplasia which causes people to be of a short stature.\n\nThose who live with dwarfism can encounter many physical barriers in a world built for taller individuals. In addition to physical barriers, there are often obstacles put in place by society that also greatly hinder the lived experiences of those with dwarfism even before any potential medical complications of dwarfism are considered. People with dwarfism should be addressed by their first names, and terms such as ‘short statured individual’, or ‘little person’ should be used when mentioning their condition.\n\nWe can offer our support to those with dwarfism by understanding the daily challenges they encounter and work towards removing the barriers that prevent them from becoming active participants in society.\n\nThe City of Toronto thanks organizations that are committed to raising awareness of conditions that impact our residents, while offering supports to help improve their wellbeing.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 2023 as “Dwarfism Awareness and Acceptance Month” in the City of Toronto.\n\nDyslexia Awareness Month\n\nOctober 2023\n\nWHEREAS dyslexia is a brain-based learning difference that causes difficulty with reading, writing and spelling comprehension for approximately 10 to 20 per cent of Canadians. People of every gender, age and\n\nsocio-economic background can be diagnosed with dyslexia, which is a genetic condition.\n\nLearning can be particularly hard for students who live with dyslexia,\n\nwith an estimated two students in every classroom having the condition. An early diagnosis and the proper supports can assist students and learners of all ages with dyslexia in pursuing their educational goals and in leading full lives.\n\nThe City of Toronto thanks organizations that are committed to raising awareness of conditions that affect all Canadians.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 2023 as “Dyslexia Awareness Month” in the City of Toronto.\n\nGerman Heritage Month\n\nOctober 2023\n\nWHEREAS members of the German community began to arrive in Canada as early as the 18th century. More than 3 million people of German descent call Canada their home, many of whom have roots in Toronto.\n\nThis month provides an opportunity to learn more about Germany’s rich history, traditions and customs and the contributions Canadians of German descent have made to our country and our city. It is also the month of Oktoberfest, a festival that brings communities together and celebrates German Heritage and its vibrant culture.\n\nThis community forms an important part of Toronto’s motto: “Diversity Our Strength.” During this month, we acknowledge with gratitude the many significant socio-economic and cultural contributions that the German Canadian community has made to our city.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 2023 as “German Heritage Month” in the City of Toronto.\n\nHispanic Heritage Month\n\nOctober 2023\n\nWHEREAS this month we celebrate the many communities in Toronto, made up of many first, second and third generation Canadians from 23 countries across Latin America. They have rich heritage, customs and traditions that form a dynamic part of the cultural mosaic of our city and contribute immensely to Toronto’s motto: “Diversity Our Strength.”\n\nThis month provides a wonderful opportunity to learn more about the history of these vibrant communities.\n\nWhile the term “Hispanic” refers to those that speak Spanish or come from Spanish-speaking populations, the City acknowledges that the communities from that region are diverse and made up of many identities, such as those with Latin, Indigenous and/or African heritage. These communities all have unique histories with colonialism and many distinct experiences, traditions, cultures.\n\nWe acknowledge with gratitude, the many significant contributions that these communities have made and continue to make in Toronto.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 2023 as “Hispanic Heritage Month” in the City of Toronto.\n\nIslamic Heritage Month\n\nOctober 2023\n\nWHEREAS this month we celebrate Muslim communities and the nearly 1.8 million Canadians who belong to these communities.\n\nIt is an opportunity to recognize the long history of diverse Muslim communities, while learning more about their rich cultures and traditions and the valuable contributions they make to our city.\n\nAs we honour and celebrate our Muslim communities, we also acknowledge that crimes and discrimination against them continue to take place. The Toronto for All Anti-Islamophobia public education campaign raises awareness of Islamophobia and the need for Torontonians to respect the religious and cultural practices of Muslims in Toronto.\n\nDuring Islamic Heritage Month, we acknowledge with gratitude, Toronto’s Muslim communities that form an important part of the rich cultural mosaic of our city and contribute to Toronto’s motto: “Diversity Our Strength”.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 2023 as “Islamic Heritage Month” in the City of Toronto.\n\nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month\n\nOctober 2023\n\nWHEREAS this month, we promote the importance of accessibility, diversity and disability inclusion in the workplace and in our communities. We recognize the immense talents and contributions that people with disabilities make, while continuing to work towards a fully inclusive city. In addressing the need for accessible workplaces, it is important to note that not all disabilities are physical. The four most common disabilities experienced by Canadians are invisible ones such as pain, flexibility, mobility and mental health disabilities.\n\nWhile many businesses in our city are already engaged in disability inclusivity, there is still much work to be done. People with disabilities earn approximately 20 per cent less than those without disabilities in Ontario. An estimated 18 per cent of Canadian employees with disabilities feel their disability makes it more difficult to change jobs due to difficulty in obtaining support or accommodations.\n\nBy employing inclusive hiring practices, being disability aware, and embedding accessibility and universal design principles within work environments, our city and its businesses can hire and retain valuable, talented workers who can thrive and grow professionally in accessible and accommodating environments.\n\nThe City of Toronto strives to become a leader in accessibility and disability inclusion through its policies, procedures and daily operations. Building an inclusive and diverse workforce is a foundational step in creating a more representative Toronto, where all residents can fully participate and have equal opportunities to succeed in their workplaces.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 2023 as “National Disability Employment Awareness Month” in the City of Toronto.\n\nWomen’s History Month\n\nOctober 2023\n\nWHEREAS in 1992, the Federal Government officially designated October as Women’s History Month to honour the many women who played a key role in the development of Canada’s history. This year’s theme, Through Her Lens: Celebrating the Diversity of Women, highlights the unique experiences and challenges of Indigenous women, women from 2SLGBTQ+ communities, and newcomer, racialized and migrant women.\n\nDuring Women’s History Month, we can learn more about how challenges and barriers that have historically been in place for women, are experienced to a greater degree by Indigenous, Black, racialized, immigrant and low-income women and 2SLGBTQ+ communities. It is an opportunity to amplify these voices and hear more about their lived experiences, in an effort to understand their unique perspectives, challenge the status quo and work towards creating a more equitable world for all women, girls and gender diverse people.\n\nThe City of Toronto’s Gender Equity Unit is developing a Gender Equity Strategy to help inform equitable program planning for women, girls and gender diverse people who make up at least 52 per cent of Toronto’s population.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 2023 as “Women’s History Month” in the City of Toronto.\n\nNational Seniors Day\n\nOctober 1, 2023\n\nWHEREAS in 2010, the Parliament of Canada passed the Celebrating Canada’s Seniors Act that recognizes October 1 as National Seniors Day. Today we honour the many valuable contributions that seniors make to their communities as elders who deserve equity, respect, inclusion, and a good quality of life.\n\nIn order to fully support Toronto’s senior population, the necessary tools, supports and proper infrastructure are required to enable the population to live independently in our city. The City of Toronto is committed to providing programs and services that address the needs of seniors through the Toronto Seniors Strategy.\n\nThrough five key areas of health, housing, transportation, employment/income, and access to services, the City is working to ensure that seniors are able to age with dignity while remaining active participants in society.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 1, 2023 as “National Seniors Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nWrongful Conviction Day\n\nOctober 2, 2023\n\nWHEREAS a person’s rights and freedoms are affected when they are punished for a crime that they did not commit.\n\nToday, we aim to inform and educate people on the issues around wrongful convictions and how they impact those falsely convicted. Raising awareness about this day can help to prevent wrongful convictions in the future.\n\nThe City of Toronto gratefully acknowledges all those who work hard each and every day to overturn false convictions. They help ensure that the wrongly convicted can one day receive the true justice they rightfully deserve.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 2, 2023 as “Wrongful Conviction Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nToronto Blue Jays Day\n\nOctober 3, 2023\n\nWHEREAS the Toronto Blue Jays took to the field for their 47th season and have qualified for the 2023 Major League Baseball (MLB) postseason for the second straight year.\n\nThroughout the season, our hometown team showed great heart and resilience in securing their third postseason appearance in four years during the final week of play. The Toronto Blue Jays look to continue their momentum as they take on the Minnesota Twins in the American League Wild Card Series, beginning what we hope is a deep postseason run in their quest for a third World Series championship.\n\nToday, on Toronto Blue Jays Day, I encourage everyone in our city – and Blue Jays fans across the country and around the world – to wear blue and show our support and appreciation for our team.\n\nThe City of Toronto would like to thank the players, coaches, staff, and their fans for a wonderful season. We are extremely proud of our Toronto Blue Jays, and look forward to a very memorable post-season.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 3, 2023 as “Toronto Blue Jays Day” in the City of Toronto. Let’s go Blue Jays!\n\nSisters in Spirit Day\n\nOctober 4, 2023\n\nWHEREAS during Sisters in Spirit Day, vigils and ceremonies take place across the country, including here in Toronto, to honour the lives of missing or murdered Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse people.\n\nSisters in Spirit was a research, education and policy initiative that sought to raise awareness of missing Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit and gender-diverse people in Canada. Their findings resulted in the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. The inquiry discovered disproportionate amounts of violence and neglect in cases involving missing and murdered Indigenous women due to reasons rooted in colonialism and colonial ideologies. The tragic loss of these lives has determined to be a genocide. Today, we are able to recognize and acknowledge these difficult truths thanks to the unrelenting efforts of Indigenous families, organizations and communities that remain committed to identifying and honouring the victims. The disappearance or the loss of a loved one leaves behind a legacy of intergenerational trauma for Indigenous Peoples and communities.\n\nAlthough the Sisters in Spirit research initiative program has ended, the movement has inspired a number of vigils and ceremonies that pay tribute to the victims and ensures these lives are never forgotten. As vigils take place across the country, they remind us that we all must work together to prevent violence against Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse people. The vigils also provide a space for healing, remembrance and solidarity for Indigenous communities.\n\nThe City of Toronto remains committed to working towards advancing truth, justice, and reconciliation with Indigenous communities, and to rebuild trust in local government. Action 12 of the City of Toronto’s Reconciliation Action Plan directly addresses the calls for justice from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. We are committed to working with Indigenous groups and organizations to ensure that the victims’ stories are heard, and to identify measures to increase the safety of Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse people in our city.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 4, 2023 as “Sisters in Spirit Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nGreen Sports Day\n\nOctober 6, 2023\n\nWHEREAS Green Sports Day is a day dedicated to increasing awareness about creating a sustainable future for sports through education, collaboration and innovation.\n\nSports organizations and leagues are seeing an ever-increasing demand from participants who wish to take part in sports teams and from sports fans who pack venues to watch their favourite teams play. They have had to expand their services in order to accommodate additional fans and new players. This increased participation can contribute to extra waste along with more energy consumption which in turn leads to increased emissions. While there are many health benefits to being active in sports, there is also a need for the sports industry to work towards creating a sustainable future.\n\nThe Canadian sports industry has developed and employed innovative programs and measures that champion this cause. Major sports events and venues use corporate-wide waste management sustainability strategies to reduce their environmental footprint. On an individual level, people can turn to second-hand sports equipment stores, repair shops, gear swaps, and other community resources to help extend the life of sporting equipment and divert them from landfills. However, greater efforts are needed to ensure that sports can benefit our mental and physical health while being models of sustainability that do not harm our natural environment.\n\nThe City of Toronto aims to make Toronto one of the most environmentally sustainable cities in the world, and is committed to achieving full sustainability and making our city a greener and better place to live, work and play.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 6, 2023 as “Green Sports Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nWoman, Life, Freedom Day\n\nOctober 8, 2023\n\nWHEREAS the Woman, Life, Freedom Movement is a women-led, international human rights movement that started in Iran following the death of Mahsa Jina Amini. Today on her birthday, we acknowledge this movement that has inspired women and people from all over the world to stand up for their individual rights and freedoms.\n\nOur Iranian-Canadian residents are a valued part of the diverse society that makes our city a unique and welcoming place. The City of Toronto stands in solidarity with our Iranian-Canadian residents and with all the people of Iran, as they seek to live freely in a democratic society that respects and upholds their rights.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 8, 2023 as “Woman, Life, Freedom Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nWorld Mental Health Day\n\nOctober 10, 2023\n\nWHEREAS World Mental Health Day is a day that raises awareness and promotes actions that can encourage better mental health and wellness.\n\nIt is also a day to remind us of the importance of openly talking about mental health, which helps to eliminate some of the barriers and stigma that are sometimes associated with mental health issues.\n\nThe City of Toronto supports mental health through partnerships with non-profit and community-based health and social service organizations that provide access to a variety of services and supports. Residents who are struggling with mental health issues can call 2-1-1 to be connected to mental health services across the city.\n\nThrough the City of Toronto’s community-based network of services that are affordable and accessible for everyone, mental health concerns in our communities can be addressed.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 10, 2023 as “World Mental Health Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nI’m Library People Day\n\nOctober 11, 2023\n\nWHEREAS the Toronto Public Library Foundation (TPLF) began the city-wide awareness campaign, “I’m Library People”, in 2017 as a way to raise awareness of the value of libraries and the immense support they provide to communities. It includes merchandise that can be purchased to help support Toronto Public Library (TPL) collections, programs and services and innovative community spaces. Donations to the campaign go towards the Toronto Public Library’s highest priority needs.\n\nToday on “I’m Library People Day”, we recognize the importance of the TPL to our city and its users, while highlighting the core values of our library system; equity, diversity, intellectual freedom, innovation, inclusion, integrity, accountability and quality service for all Torontonians.\n\nDespite the challenges that libraries currently face, the Toronto Public Library continues to ensure all residents have access to a broad range of information, ideas and opportunities. Today, we celebrate the Toronto Public Library and its branches as public places and spaces that help us to learn and grow, while encouraging open, uncensored dialogue and new perspectives.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2023 as “I’m Library People Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nInternational Day of the Girl\n\nOctober 11, 2023\n\nWHEREAS the United Nations recognizes the International Day of the Girl to highlight the pressing issues faced by girls and gender diverse people around the world, and to encourage real change in addressing them. Some of these issues include access to education, gender equality, access to specialized health services, child marriage and gender based violence.\n\nGirls and gender diverse people make valuable contributions to our city and to the world despite facing countless obstacles and barriers to their success. Girls and gender diverse people are talented, resilient, creative and resourceful people who have the power to be change makers when they are given the skills and opportunities to succeed.\n\nToday, we are reminded that we all play an essential role in encouraging girls and gender diverse people to reach their full potential, including pursuing any professions and trades that may interest them. We can help create opportunities to support them in having their voices heard while making decision-making places areas where they feel welcomed and respected.\n\nInternational Day of the Girl is an opportunity to seek positive and concrete solutions as we move towards a future that supports the leadership and potential of girls and gender diverse people.\n\nThe City of Toronto is developing its first Gender Equity Strategy that will work towards equitable outcomes for girls and gender diverse people who make up 52 per cent of Toronto’s population.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2023 as “International Day of the Girl” in the City of Toronto.\n\nToronto Public Health Day\n\nOctober 11, 2023\n\nWHEREAS today we honour 140 years of public health in Toronto. In 1883, a revised Public Health Act of Ontario bestowed powers on the City of Toronto and Dr. William Canniff was appointed our first medical officer of health. The initial mandate of the new Department of Health, now known as Toronto Public Health, was to ensure a clean water and air supply, as well as adequate housing and nutrition, health education and free medical and dental services for the less fortunate.\n\nUnder the leadership and vision of one of the next medical officers of heath, Dr. Charles Hastings, the public health unit quickly grew to become the largest in Canada. He was a social activist who documented slum conditions in Toronto and focused on preventive medicine for residents. His efforts helped Toronto Public Health to become a proven leader in preventive medicine.\n\nFrom 1921 to 1981, Toronto Public Health concentrated on improvements to existing services and new medical developments such as the polio vaccine. By the 1950s, the focus turned to “lifestyle” diseases such as lung cancer, alcoholism, heart disease and social concerns such as family planning. In the 1970s, the public health unit was busy addressing public fears concerning emerging environmental hazards.\n\nIn the new millennium, Toronto Public Health has responded to numerous health emergencies including SARS and H1N1.\n\nOver the past three years, Toronto Public Health has demonstrated unwavering leadership in its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This tireless dedication has not only safeguarded the health of Toronto residents but has also had a significant impact on Canada’s overall response to this unprecedented public health crisis.\n\nAs we mark Toronto Public Health’s remarkable 140th anniversary, it is only fitting that we express our profound gratitude for their enduring commitment to the well-being of Torontonians. The diligent efforts of Toronto Public Health have played a pivotal role in fostering a sustainable health care system, nurturing a robust economy and cultivating thriving communities. These achievements have been made possible through the continuous collaboration and concerted efforts of numerous community partners and organizations.\n\nAs Toronto Public Health looks toward the future of health and health care in our city, it remains a beacon of leadership, supporting the development of a healthier Toronto. Their vital health services and programs, coupled with the development and implementation of sound public policies, continue to enhance the overall well-being of residents – contributing to a brighter and healthier tomorrow.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2023, as “Toronto Public Health Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nMount Sinai Day\n\nOctober 17, 2023\n\nWHEREAS today we celebrate the centennial anniversary of Mount Sinai Hospital. Since opening its doors a century ago, Mount Sinai has been delivering exceptional medical care and ground-breaking research. Today, we celebrate the numerous achievements and milestones of Mount Sinai Hospital that began as a small maternity ward and has since grown to be one of Toronto’s largest hospitals.\n\nMount Sinai first opened in 1923 as the Hebrew Maternity and Convalescent Hospital on Yorkville Avenue thanks to the tireless efforts of four women in the Jewish community. Since then, the hospital has developed a reputation for world-wide excellence in multiple areas including genetic research, women and infant health, surgical oncology, gastrointestinal diseases, diabetes, general psychiatry, critical care, cardiology and much more.\n\nOn this milestone centennial anniversary, we honour and celebrate the immense contributions of Mount Sinai’s doctors, nurses and incredible staff who provide world-class, specialized care to patients in over 45 languages.\n\nThis occasion is the perfect opportunity to acknowledge with gratitude Mount Sinai’s commitment to the health and wellbeing of our residents.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 17, 2023 as “Mount Sinai Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nChild Care Worker Appreciation Day\n\nOctober 17, 2023\n\nWHEREAS, today we recognize the commitment of child care workers to children, families and to the communities that they serve.\n\nTrained and knowledgeable Registered Early Childhood Educators and child care staff provide high-quality early learning and child care that is created to develop young peoples’ intellectual, emotional, social and physical development and later life outcomes.\n\nChild care promotes the well-being of children, and responding to the needs of families by providing support in caring for their young members. This essential support enables residents to fully participate in and contribute to the economic and social life of their communities.\n\nThe City of Toronto acknowledges with gratitude, Early Childhood Educators and all child care workers who play an instrumental role in helping to shape the early, foundational years of our young residents.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 17, 2023 as “Child Care Worker Appreciation Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nPersons Day\n\nOctober 18, 2023\n\nWHEREAS on this day in 1929, Canada’s highest court of appeal ruled to include women in the legal definition of “persons”. On Persons Day, we recognize this historic decision did not come easily but was the result of the hard work and organizing efforts of a group of women who fought for gender equity in Canada.\n\nThe group was made up of activists, journalists and politicians, which included: Emily Murphy, Nellie McClung, Louise McKinney, Irene Parlby and Henrietta Muir Edwards, who were later known as the Famous Five.\n\nThe group petitioned the Supreme Court to rule on whether the word “persons” in Section 24 of the British North America Act (1867) included women. The Supreme Court ruled that, in its interpretation, women were not included as “persons” in the Act.\n\nThe women appealed the decision to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, England, which was Canada’s highest court of appeal at the time. On October 18, 1929, the Privy Council reversed the decision by the Supreme Court and ruled that women were in fact included as “persons” in the Act.\n\nWhile the Privy Council’s ruling helped to further women’s participation in public and political life in Canada, the decision excluded Indigenous women and women of Asian heritage or decent. It is an important reminder that women’s rights and suffrage in Canada were not always equal for all women. We remain grateful to the Famous Five for their contributions to Canadian social and political life, as we continue to fight for the human rights and equity of all people in our city.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 18, 2023 as “Persons Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nRespiratory Therapy Week\n\nOctober 22 – 28, 2023\n\nWHEREAS Respiratory Therapy Week acknowledges the important work done by respiratory therapists in providing essential care to patients.\n\nRespiratory therapists (RTs) are highly skilled and certified professionals in their field. They work closely with doctors to identify, diagnose and manage cardiopulmonary issues and airway management in patients. They also help educate patients and their families while lending their expertise in a variety of settings including intensive care units, extended care facilities, operating rooms, and laboratories.\n\nThe City of Toronto recognizes respiratory therapists for their contributions to the health and well-being of residents. The dedication and hard work of many specialized professionals enrich the lives of Torontonians, making our city stronger, safer, vibrant and healthy.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 22 – 28, 2023 as “Respiratory Therapy Week” in the City of Toronto.\n\nWorld Polio Day\n\nOctober 24, 2023\n\nWHEREAS, every year on October 24, the United Nations observes World Polio Day on the birthday of Jonas Salk who developed the vaccine against polio, a viral infection that affects the immune and nervous systems, causing nerve damage or paralysis. Polio is most common in children under five, with those who are not fully vaccinated also being at risk of contracting the disease. Although there are ways to manage symptoms, there is currently no cure for polio.\n\nThe polio vaccine and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative have helped to drastically reduce global polio cases.\n\nWhile Canada has been polio-free for the last 20 years, there are countries that continue to experience polio outbreaks.\n\nBy raising awareness of the need to get vaccinated against polio, we can give our support to those who are dedicated to eradicating this disease.\n\nThe City gratefully acknowledges organizations that help to raise awareness of diseases and conditions that impact our residents, while offering them supports to live with these diseases.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 24, 2023 as “World Polio Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nDress Purple Day\n\nOctober 27, 2023\n\nWHEREAS on Dress Purple Day, everyone is encouraged to wear purple in support of child abuse prevention, and emphasizes every child and youth’s right to safety and well-being in all spaces.\n\nToday serves as a reminder that children have the right to feel safe physically, emotionally, spiritually and culturally. As one of the most vulnerable groups in our city, it is imperative that we ensure the safety and protection of our city’s children and youth by providing them ample support and resources to overcome any challenges they may face.\n\nThis day is also an opportunity for children’s aid societies to foster strong partnerships with their respective communities through community-based prevention and early intervention programs. In this regard, adults play an important role in being vigilant and recognizing the signs of child abuse. It is the legal duty of adults to report any concerns about the safety of a child or youth.\n\nThe City of Toronto recognizes that in order to cultivate a safe, respectful and inclusive environment, adults must work in tandem with children and maintain open communication to address issues and concerns that may arise. We continue to be committed to reinforcing our shared values of respect, dignity, diversity, independence and equity for children and youth. By working closely with community members, partners and organizations, we can create a caring and supportive city in which all children and youth can thrive, develop and grow into leaders of tomorrow.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 27, 2023 as “Dress Purple Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nOccupational Therapy Day\n\nOctober 27, 2023\n\nWHEREAS there are approximately 20,000 occupational therapists who practice their trades across Canada. They are skilled professionals who enable and empower their clients to participate more fully in their daily activities. Today we recognize their dedication and hard work in improving the quality of life for those who require their services.\n\nThe theme for this year’s Occupational Therapy Day, “Unity through Community”, emphasizes the importance of partnering with individuals and organizations to best serve the needs of the entire community.\n\nThe City of Toronto gratefully acknowledges the contributions of occupational therapists whose dedicated efforts contribute to the health and well-being of residents in our city.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 27, 2023 as “Occupational Therapy Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nRett Syndrome Awareness Day\n\nOctober 29, 2023\n\nWHEREAS Rett syndrome is a rare genetic neurological disorder that occurs almost exclusively females, and is characterized by the impediment of nearly every aspect of one’s life including speech, motor skills, and even breathing.\n\nRett syndrome is usually recognized in children between 6 to 18 months, when developmental milestones such as speech and walking are delayed or missed, or when they lose these learned abilities. Though Rett syndrome is rare – 1 of every 10,000 female births, even fewer in males – the severity of this condition can lead to debilitating conditions such as slowed physical and mental development, seizures, and osteoporosis.\n\nWhile there is no known cure for Rett syndrome, there are various treatments and medications available to help patients lead fulfilling lives into adulthood. Today, we raise awareness of this condition, and the need for therapy programs, further research, and support services so that those living with Rett syndrome can live full productive lives.\n\nThe City of Toronto extends its appreciation to organizations that raise awareness of disorders, illnesses and conditions that impact our residents, while offering support services and programs that can help improve their health and well-being.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 29, 2023 as “Rett Syndrome Awareness Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nWorld Stroke Day\n\nOctober 29, 2023\n\nWHEREAS stroke is a condition where a blood vessel in the brain is either blocked or ruptured, leading to a sudden loss of brain function. On World Stroke Day, we highlight the importance of recognizing the signs and symptoms of a stroke, and the prevention measures available.\n\nIt is important that we learn to recognize the signs of stroke, which include loss of motor function, slurred speech, and a drooping face. The earlier these signs are recognized and treated, the better the chance of full recovery. However, even with timely treatment efforts, strokes often have lasting impacts on patients’ physical and mental health.\n\nThough 1 in 4 people will suffer a stroke in their lifetime, about 90% of strokes can be prevented with simple lifestyle changes such as keeping a healthy diet, being physically active, and avoiding excessive alcohol and drug abuse, all of which can drastically lower the risk of a stroke.\n\nThe City of Toronto extends its appreciation to organizations that raise awareness of disorders, illnesses and conditions that impact our residents, while offering support services and programs that can help improve their health and well-being.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim October 29, 2023 as “World Stroke Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nArthritis Awareness Month\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nWHEREAS Arthritis Awareness Month is an opportunity to raise awareness of arthritis which is a collection of conditions affecting the tissues. It causes pain and restricts mobility, while impacting the quality of life for 1 in 5 Canadians who live with the disease. For many, arthritis can threaten their ability to enjoy freedom of movement and to live pain-free. Many forms of arthritis can lead to episodic disability, leaving people unable to work due to their disease.\n\nTreatment for arthritis is tailed to an individual’s needs and in consultation with medical professionals. For some who live with arthritis, healthy habits such as proper nutrition and exercising may help with daily pain management. While there is no cure for arthritis, it can be managed with the proper supports.\n\nThe City of Toronto thanks organizations that are committed to raising awareness of conditions that impact our residents and supporting them as they live with chronic conditions.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim September 2023 as “Arthritis Awareness Month” in the City of Toronto.\n\nPolycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Day\n\nSeptember 4, 2023\n\nWHEREAS Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder that causes fluid-filled cysts to grow on the kidneys. There is usually a family history of this disease and parents with PKD can pass on the disease to their children.\n\nPeople can live with the disease for years before they experience any symptoms such as declining kidney function and kidney failure. Managing PKD involves focusing on maintaining optimal kidney health through lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise. Controlling risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, is crucial as it commonly accompanies PKD. As PKD progresses, some individuals may eventually require a kidney transplant to address the deteriorating kidney function.\n\nThe City of Toronto thanks organizations that are committed to raising awareness of diseases that impact our residents and supporting them as they live with chronic conditions.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim September 4, 2023 as “Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nToronto International Film Festival Weeks\n\nSeptember 7 – 17, 2023\n\nWHEREAS every year in September the spotlight shines on the best and brightest in Canadian and international cinema as we celebrate the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).\n\nAs one of the world’s premier film festivals, TIFF provides engaging audience experiences while also championing the film industry. Through thought-provoking screenings, lectures, discussions, workshops, networking events, and more, the festival is at the forefront of creating lifelong and cherished cinematic memories for film lovers.\n\nThe City of Toronto is proud of the many writers, producers, directors, editors, industry workers, curators, artists, and celebrities, who have helped establish Toronto as a global centre for film and entertainment excellence. The City also recognizes how the creative film industry helps contribute to our collective artistic and cultural fabric.\n\nThe City of Toronto aims to be a supportive environment where artists and creators can innovate and thrive in their field. Toronto’s rich economic diversity drives growth, innovation and strengthens Toronto’s position as a global centre for business and the arts. As a cultural powerhouse in Canada, Toronto is a major artistic hub where creatives can innovate and share their work.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim September 7 – 17, 2023 as “Toronto International Film Festival Weeks” in the City of Toronto.\n\nUkrainian Heritage Day\n\nSeptember 7, 2023\n\nWHEREAS, the first Ukrainian immigrants arrived in Canada on this day in 1891, opening the doors for generations of Ukrainians to settle in our country and city. Canada is now home to the second largest diaspora of Ukrainians, made up of approximately 1.36 million Ukrainian Canadians.\n\nToday we celebrate Toronto’s Ukrainian community and the community’s many contributions to arts and culture, politics, education and sports. The Ukrainian Canadian community has played an instrumental role in helping to build our city and shape it into the culturally diverse place that it is known to be.\n\nThank you to the Ukrainian community for standing firmly in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. Your continued support for them as well as your strength and resilience in these trying times is truly heartwarming and inspiring to witness.\n\nOn this day, we acknowledge with gratitude the many significant cultural and socio-economic contributions that the Ukrainian Canadian community has made in Toronto.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim September 7, 2023 as “Ukrainian Heritage Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nInternational Literacy Day\n\nSeptember 8, 2023\n\nWHEREAS literacy is an essential skill and a human right that is required to be an active and contributing member of society. Literacy not only empowers individuals but also enables them to participate fully in society, fostering personal growth and active citizenship. Sadly, 763 million people around the world cannot read due to challenges beyond their control, which greatly impacts their future success.\n\nThis year’s International Literacy Day will focus on the theme, “Promoting literacy for a world in transition: Building the foundation for sustainable and peaceful societies”. It will seek to raise awareness of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal # 4 that is centered on literacy, education and lifelong learning which are at the heart of building peaceful, just and sustainable societies. By encouraging literacy for all, we encourage a society where each person plays an active and contributing role and no one is left behind.\n\nThe City of Toronto recognizes the importance of literacy in helping to form an educated society which is key to a city’s sustainability. The City provides broad access to learning opportunities that support the different ways that people learn.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim September 8, 2023 as “International Literacy Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nFetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Awareness Day\n\nSeptember 9, 2023\n\nWHEREAS Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) affects the brain and body of those who were exposed to alcohol in the womb. FASD is the leading cause of neurodevelopmental disability in Canada, affecting 4% of the population. The prevalence of FASD is greater than Autism, Down Syndrome, and Cerebral Palsy combined but it often goes undetected and it is difficult to diagnose.\n\nIndividuals with FASD can have physical, intellectual, behavioural, emotional, and learning difficulties. They typically require support at school, help finding and keeping employment, support in maintaining a residence, and help managing emotional and behavioral challenges.\n\nThis disorder affects people from all socio-economic, educational or ethnic backgrounds and individuals who can thrive when they have the proper supports in place to assist them.\n\nThe City of Toronto thanks organizations that are committed to raising awareness of conditions that impact our residents and supporting them as they live with chronic conditions.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim September 9, 2023 as “Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Awareness Day” in the City of Toronto.\n\nLiving Donation Week\n\nSeptember 10-16, 2023\n\nWHEREAS a living donation takes place when a person chooses to provide a donation of a living kidney or part of their liver to someone who is awaiting a liver or kidney transplant. In 2022, over 3000 Canadians were on wait-lists for transplants. Sadly, many on wait-lists passed while waiting to receive organ donations. Those who receive a living donation tend to spend less time on the organ donation list compared to those who receive a deceased donor’s organ.\n\nLiving donations are selfless, life changing gifts that not only reduce deaths but give kidney and liver recipients a new chance at living a healthy life.\n\nDuring this week, we highlight the importance of organ donation,\n\ncelebrate the success of living donations and encourage more people to consider becoming living donors.\n\nThe City of Toronto thanks organizations that are committed to raising awareness of conditions that impact our residents and supporting them as they work towards better health.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Olivia Chow on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim September 10-16, 2023 as “Living Donation Week” in the City of Toronto.\n\nToronto Public Service Week\n\nSeptember 11–15, 2023\n\nWHEREAS this week, we recognize and celebrate the professionalism, dedication and integrity of the nearly 40,000 members of the Toronto Public Service (TPS).
