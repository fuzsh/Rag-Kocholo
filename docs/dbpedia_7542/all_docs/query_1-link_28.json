        "text": "A recent poll found that Olivia Chow is currently the top candidate in the Toronto mayoral race, but if former mayor John Tory were running he would be in the lead.\n\nAccording to a recent survey from Forum Research, 18 per cent of people support Chow, who is a former member of Parliament and former city councillor.\n\nMeanwhile, ten per cent are in favour of Councillor Josh Matlow and six per cent of respondents said they would vote for former Toronto police chief Mark Saunders. Four per cent of people said Scarborough Member of Provincial Parliament Mitzie Hunter is their top choice, while another four per cent were in favour of former city councillor Ana Bailão.\n\nREAD MORE: John Tory resigns as Toronto mayor after admitting to cheating with former staffer\n\nHowever, when asked, 40 per cent of the 1,022 Toronto residents surveyed said they would vote for former Toronto Mayor John Tory if he were to run in the upcoming election. The survey found that support for Tory was higher among respondents aged 45 and over than those aged 18 to 44.\n\n“Tory continues to enjoy notable popularity,” Dr. Lorne Bozinoff, president of Forum Research said, adding that voters seem willing to see him return to the mayor’s office.\n\nTorontonians will head to the polls to elect the city’s next mayor on June 26. This comes after Tory stepped down in February following his confession of having an affair with a former employee in his office.\n\nThe long-time mayor was re-elected only four months ahead of his resignation, for his third straight term in office. During that campaign period, Tory had said that if elected, this would be his last term in office.\n\nThe poll is based on the responses provided by randomly selected Toronto residents, aged 18 and older. The survey was conducted by phone between April 25 and 26 The results are considered accurate plus or minus three per cent, 19 times out of 20."
