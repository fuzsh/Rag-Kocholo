        "text": "John Tory is resigning as mayor of Toronto after a Toronto Star report revealed that the third-term politician had a months-long relationship with a former member of his staff during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMultiple news outlets claim that the 68-year-old submitted his resignation letter to the city clerk on Feb. 15. Tory is set to step down at 5 p.m. on Feb. 17.\n\nWATCH: Employment lawyer Jon Pinkus spoke to CTV News about Tory’s resignation and the possible repercussions of workplace relationships.\n\nThe formal resignation comes a few days after Tory held a news conference to address the situation.\n\nOn Feb. 10, the outgoing mayor told reporters:\n\n“I did not meet the standards to which I hold myself as mayor and as a family man.”\n\n“I recognize that permitting this relationship to develop was a serious error in judgement on my part.”\n\n“While I deeply regret having to step away from a job that I love, in a city that I love even more… it is best to commit myself to the work that is required to repair these most important relationships.”\n\nTory has asked the City of Toronto’s integrity commissioner to look into the relationship.\n\nHe added that he will work with various members of the City’s administration, including the city manager, city clerk and deputy mayor, to ensure an organized transition.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\n• Toronto Star interview: Experts weigh in on office relationships\n\n• 640 Toronto: Lior Samfiru talks Tory’s resignation and dating at work\n\nIs it illegal to have a romantic relationship with my boss?\n\nNews that Tory engaged in an allegedly consensual relationship with a staffer has raised questions about whether it’s legal for a boss to have a romantic relationship with their employees.\n\nThere are no laws in Ontario (or Canada) that prevent consensual workplace romance between a boss and an employee.\n\nIt’s legal for consenting co-workers to date or engage in intimate relations with one another.\n\nWhile political settings are a workplace like any other, there could be even more emphasis placed on the importance of maintaining a balance of power among all staff.\n\nWhile there are no laws in the country prohibiting relationships between employees, it’s generally not a good idea for a superior to date a subordinate that they have power over.\n\nThe fact that there is a power imbalance between a boss and an employee means that it’s unlikely that a relationship can be completely voluntary.\n\nWATCH: Employment Lawyer Alex Lucifero spoke to CTV News about Ottawa city council’s policy on workplace relationships.\n\nCan companies ban workplace relationships?\n\nThe short answer is yes. Employers can choose to ban staff from forming romantic relationships with co-workers in an effort to protect themselves from legal liabilities.\n\nHowever, this approach is considered outdated and potentially harmful to the company for two reasons:\n\nThe business may lose talented employees who are forced to choose between their job and their workplace relationship\n\nEmployees may not report non-consensual relationships out of fear that they could lose their job\n\nInstead of banning office dating, a better solution for employers is to implement workplace dating policies that address intimate relationships between superiors and subordinates — or those that could cause conflicts of interest.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\n• Try Guys remove Ned Fulmer over workplace relationship\n\n• McDonald’s CEO and Navigating Workplace Relationships\n\n• Employment lawyer talks employee rights in GMA hosts scandal\n\nIs there a policy about relationships between the mayor and staff?\n\nToronto city council’s Code of Conduct doesn’t speak to romantic relationships between members of council — including the mayor — and their staff.\n\nThe Code claims that “members should perform their duties and arrange their private affairs in a manner that promotes public confidence and bears close public scrutiny.”\n\nIn general, a company’s dating policy can:\n\nInclude rules about workplace relationships (i.e. what constitutes “inappropriate” behaviour, such as no public displays of affections or favouritism)\n\nRequire employees to report workplace relationships to HR with written confirmation that it’s consensual\n\nExplain how the policy will be enforced if it’s breached, including disciplinary action and dismissal (which should only be reserved for very serious circumstances)\n\nDating policies don’t have to apply to employees only. They can also cover contractors, vendors, and suppliers to prevent potential conflicts of interest.\n\nWhile companies in Canada aren’t required to have a policy on office relationships, they are legally obligated to make sure that the workplace is free of discrimination and harassment.\n\nHuman rights legislation at the federal and provincial level does cover a variety of situations, including unwanted sexual advances by someone in a position of power towards a subordinate."
