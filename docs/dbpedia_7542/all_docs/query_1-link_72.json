She won't say\n\nIt would have been equally unlikely had Tory fulfilled the promise he made in his first term of office that he would only seek two terms.\n\nIn either case, an indication of Chow’s chances given a typical field of candidates in a conventional municipal election, was that in the 2014 race for mayor, Chow started out as the frontrunner but ended up a distant third behind Tory and Doug Ford.\n\nIn 2015, she attempted a comeback in federal politics but was easily defeated by the Liberals’ Adam Vaughan in Spadina-Fort York.\n\nBut that was then and this is now.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nNow Chow has Toronto’s progressive vote almost entirely to herself while the conservative vote is split among multiple candidates who have been fighting for second place since the start of the campaign, with no one emerging as the “Anybody but Chow” candidate.\n\nIf Chow wins on Monday, she becomes the leading contender to win again in the 2026 municipal election, which would see her in office until 2030.\n\nFiscal conservatives should consider this possibility with abject horror, given her tax-and-spend philosophy consistent through her entire political career as a school trustee, city and Metro councillor and NDP member of parliament\n\nIt’s not that Chow’s incompetent. It’s that she’s very competent and that for the first time she’s going to have real power, particularly with Premier Ford awarding strong mayor powers to Toronto when he thought he was giving them to Tory.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nChow said during the campaign she’s not going to use those powers to implement her agenda and instead wants to further democratize City Hall.\n\nWe’ll see, because it’s not as if politicians don’t change their minds due to what they describe as changing circumstances when they make the change.\n\nTory said he wasn’t going to endorse anyone in the race and last week endorsed former city councillor Ana Bailão.\n\nPremier Ford said he wasn’t going to endorse anyone and then endorsed former police chief Mark Saunders.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nThe fact Ford has described a Chow victory as an “unmitigated disaster” that will drive businesses out of Toronto because of high taxes, bodes ill for voters who want the city and province working together to solve problems, not create more of them\n\nIn any event, Tory supporting Bailão and Ford supporting Saunders doesn’t hurt Chow because it drives home to voters that the political forces opposed to her are divided.\n\nFinally, it’s incorrect to attribute a Chow victory on Monday — unless all the polls have been spectacularly wrong — simply to name recognition, because while that’s part of it, she also has the support of NDP operatives and voters in downtown Toronto.\n\nIn 2014, that wasn’t anywhere near enough to propel her to victory. This time it looks like it will.\n\nlgoldstein@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
