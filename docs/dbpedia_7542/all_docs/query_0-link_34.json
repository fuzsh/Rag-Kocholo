        "text": "John Howard Tory, OOnt KC, (born May 28, 1954) is a Canadian broadcaster, businessman, and former politician who served as the 65th mayor of Toronto from 2014 to 2023. John first spoke to the Whiff in March 26, 2014: Who does Toronto need in the Mayor’s office next fall?\n\nClick here to jump to the RSVP below the speaker’s bio.\n\nHe attended the University of Toronto Schools and received his BA in political science from Trinity College at the University of Toronto in 1975. He received his Bachelor of Laws in 1978 from Osgoode Hall Law School of York University and was called to the bar in Ontario in 1980.\n\nAfter a career as a lawyer, political strategist and businessman, Tory ran as a mayoral candidate in the 2003 Toronto municipal election and lost to David Miller. Tory was subsequently elected as Ontario Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leader from 2004 to 2009, and was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario representing Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey and serving as the leader of the Opposition in Ontario from 2005 to 2007. After his resignation as PC leader in 2009, Tory became a radio talk show host on CFRB. Despite widespread speculation, Tory did not run for mayor again in 2010. He was also the volunteer chair of the non-profit group CivicAction from 2010 to 2014. In 2012, Tory was made a member of the Order of Ontario in recognition for being “a consummate champion for the Greater Toronto Region as a founding member and chair of CivicAction and chairs and volunteers on countless fundraising campaigns“.\n\nOn October 27, 2014, Tory was elected mayor of Toronto, defeating incumbent mayor Rob Ford’s brother, councillor Doug Ford and former councillor and member of Parliament (MP) Olivia Chow. On October 22, 2018, he was re-elected mayor of Toronto in the 2018 mayoral election, defeating former chief city planner Jennifer Keesmaat. He was elected to a third term as mayor on October 24, 2022, after defeating urbanist Gil Penalosa. He resigned as Mayor on Feb 17, 2023.\n\nJoin fellow Whiffers on Tuesday, Sep 24th to hear John give us his opinion on the state of affairs in Toronto and the province.\n\nThe reception at the RCYC begins at 6:00 pm."
