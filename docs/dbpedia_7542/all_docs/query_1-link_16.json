The former mayor says it will not be.\n\nVictorious in three consecutive elections, Tory stepped down on Feb. 10 after admitting to having a relationship with as female staffer in his office.\n\nAnybody wanting to replace him has until Friday to get their name on the ballot.\n\nWith 73 people already running for Toronto’s top municipal job, Friday is the final day to register for the June 26 byelection.\n\nWhile two Forum Research Polls show he could win back the position he vacated, Tory has made it clear he will not add his name to the lengthy list of candidates.\n\nCould there be 100 candidates this time? A lot of people were wondering if one of those names to come in on or around the last day would be Tory’s.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFearing what a more left-leaning Olivia Chow would look like over the next 3 1/2 years in office — and, so far, polls suggest few of her rivals pose much of a threat — there are people looking for ways to defeat her.\n\nSomeone else will have to deal with that because Tory said to count him out.\n\nRECOMMENDED VIDEO\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\n“I won’t be a candidate for mayor in the upcoming byelection,” he told me in an email. “As I have said many times, I will find other ways I can continue to contribute to the city I love and I will always be available to help our city’s mayor and council.”\n\nThis will come as a great relief to the front-runners. The Forum research poll shows Tory at “40-plus” in support, according to Bozinoff, while none of the leading candidates received that much.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWithout Tory in the poll, the Forum numbers show Chow in the lead at 33%, with Councillor Josh Matlow and former Toronto police chief Mark Saunders tied for second at 14%. A Mainstreet Research poll, reported by CTV last Friday, showed Chow, a former NDP MP and city councillor, at 22% and former councillor Ana Bailao and Matlow tied for second with 11% each.\n\nAlso running are Councillors Brad Bradford and Anthony Perruzza, Liberal MPP Mitzie Hunter and city advocate and journalist Anthony Furey. There are many other names in this race, including Chloe Brown, Chris Sky, former councillor Giorgio Mammoliti and businessman and entertainer Frank D’Angelo.\n\nOther than Chow, none of the candidates have stepped up to capture the imagination of the electorate, which had some behind the scenes trying to coax Tory back into the race with a view that he could win easily. Tory has seen the polls and been getting the phone calls, but had not commented publicly — until now.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nHe said he felt it would be best if he ended any speculation and made it clear he won’t be involved.\n\n“Polls which suggested I might do well … (have) encouraged many people to reach out from across the city and I am very grateful for their expressions of kindness and support,” Tory said.\n\n“I said on the day I stepped aside that serving as mayor for more than eight years was one of the great privileges of my entire life … I tried my best to do my best, including during the pandemic, which was a very challenging time.”\n\nTory added: “I also said that day that I wanted to place a greater priority on my family and helping deal with a difficult situation I was responsible for. I have been doing just that and I will continue to do so.”\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nWARMINGTON: New poll shows John Tory could easily win back mayor's job\n\nJohn Tory resigns as mayor, still hopes to contribute to city\n\nMayor Tory sticking around for budget, some want him to finish his term\n\nHe didn’t rule out attempting to come back into elected life at another time. Perhaps he could run provincially in Scarborough—Guildwood if Hunter does indeed resign it to concentrate fully on the mayoral race, as she has indicated she will.\n\nOr perhaps Tory is retired from public life altogether. Time will tell.\n\nBut one thing he said is for sure: despite leading in polls, Tory has no plans to make a comeback in the current mayoral contest.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
