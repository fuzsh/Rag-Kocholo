        "text": "Feb 12, 2023 | 2:03 AM\n\nTorontonians will return to the polls just months after October’s municipal election saw John Tory cruise to what was supposed to be a third full term.\n\nBut just when the byelection will take place remains unclear, with a city spokesperson saying as of yet, Tory has not submitted a formal letter of resignation to the City Clerk and therefore remains mayor.\n\nAfter two relatively scandal-free terms at City Hall, Tory detonated a political bombshell late Friday when he admitted to having an “inappropriate relationship” with a former member of his staff and abruptly announced plans to resign from the city’s top job.\n\nTory has not said when he will formally step down, after which city council will need to declare the mayor’s office vacant.\n\nThat could happen as early as Wednesday, when councillors are set to debate the city’s proposed 2023 budget — which Tory had sole responsibility to prepare under the province’s new “strong mayor” powers.\n\nIn previous years, the city was able to appoint a successor to fill the mayor’s seat, but the new provincial legislation means Toronto is required to hold a byelection within 60 days of the mayor’s office being declared vacant.\n\nDeputy mayor and councillor for Scarborough-Rouge Park Jennifer McKelvie will likely take on the role of interim mayor.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 12, 2023.\n\nThe Canadian Press"
