        "text": "JOHN Tory, mayor of Toronto, Canada, has announced his resignation after admitting an affair with a former employee.\n\nTory, 68, issued a press conference on Friday to address the revelations of a relationship with a 31-year-old female aide that started during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe situation was first made public by reports from the Toronto Star.\n\nThe Toronto mayor said that the affair had \"ended mutually by consent this year.\"\n\n\"I am deeply sorry, and I apologize unreservedly to the people of Toronto and to all of those hurt by my actions,\" Tory said in his statement.\n\n\"Most of all, I apologize to my wife, Barb, and to my family who I've let down more than anyone else.\"\n\nTory and his wife have reportedly been married for 40 years, per Fox News.\n\nThe 68-year-old was elected mayor of the prominent Canadian city in 2014.\n\nHe was then re-elected in 2018, and again last year.\n\nTory was born in Toronto and grew up in a family with a successful law firm in the city.\n\nHis father, John, worked at Torys Law Firm but also served on the board of directors for Rogers Communications.\n\nAfter completing high school and getting a law degree during the 1970s, Tory worked for radio stations owned by Rogers Communications before he got into politics.\n\nFrom there, he allegedly wavered in and out of politics through the 1980s.\n\nIn the 1990s, he even served as the commissioner of the Canadian Football League before getting back into politics once again.\n\nDuring his first run in 2014 for mayor, Tory ran against and defeated Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who released a statement this morning on Twitter about the resignation.\n\n\"John will be remembered as a dedicated and hard-working mayor who served as a steady leader during the most difficult days of the pandemic,\" Ford said.\n\n\"I will miss working with him … I wish nothing but the best for my friend in the days, weeks, and months ahead.”\n\nDeputy Mayor Jennifer McKelvie will allegedly fill Tory's position for the time being, but because of a new act the city passed in September 2022, a byelection will likely be held.\n\nIt is said to take place within 60 days after “a declaration of vacancy is made.”\n\nThis means there's a possibility for a newly elected mayor this spring for Toronto citizens."
