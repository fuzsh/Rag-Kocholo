        "text": "News Release\n\nToday, City of Toronto Mayor John Tory unveiled a new temporary work of public art at the Ontario Place lagoon as part of the launch of ArtworxTO: Toronto’s Year of Public Art 2021–2022 which kicks off on September 22. The installation at Ontario Place, titled ‘Over Floe’, by John Notten, depicts five icebergs made almost entirely of Styrofoam salvaged from a Toronto demolition site, offering a sharp contrast to the natural impermanence of melting ice.\n\nMayor Tory was joined for this announcement by Deputy Mayor Michael Thompson (Scarborough Centre), Chair of the Economic and Community Development Committee; Councillor Gary Crawford (Scarborough Southwest), Co-Chair of the Mayor’s External Advisory Committee for the Year of Public Art; and project artist, John Notten.\n\nAs part of one of the largest investments in arts and culture in the City’s history, new City and Toronto Arts Council grants – funded by corporate and government partners – will provide Toronto artists with more than $4.5 million to produce more than 350 new murals, installations, exhibitions, art events, performances and productions in 2021 and 2022.\n\nThe City’s new 10-Year Public Art Strategy signals Toronto’s renewed commitment to public art, and celebrates the incredible public artwork in the city, while also working to address gaps in that collection, such as the under-representation of equity-deserving communities and their histories, as well as geographic areas of the city where there are fewer public art works.\n\nArtworxTO would like to thank all of its sponsors, donors and media partners: QuadReal Property Group, the Ontario Cultural Attractions Fund – a program of the Government of Ontario through the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport, administered by the Ontario Cultural Attractions Fund Corporation, RBC Foundation, TD Ready Commitment, Power Corporation of Canada, Collecdev, Union Station, Metropia, Castlepoint Numa, KingSett Capital, Canada Lands Company, Northcrest Developments, Oxford Properties, OUTFRONT Media, Branded Cities, Bell Media, Bill Morneau & Nancy McCain Foundation, Weston Family Foundation, The Woodbridge Company Limited, EllisDon, The McLean Foundation, Goodmans LLP, Paul and Emma Bain, The Ouellette Family Foundation, Partners in Art and Toronto Star.\n\nOver Floe will be available for public viewing at Ontario Place until October 31.\n\nRead the City’s 10-Year Public Art Strategy.\n\nMore information about ArtworxTO: Toronto’s Year of Public Art 2021–2022, including an interactive map of Toronto’s extensive collection of public art, is available at the City’s website.\n\nQuotes:\n\n“As we look to rebuild our city post-pandemic and bring about a renewed sense of hope and vibrancy, the arts and culture sector will play a big role in our success. ArtworxTO comes at a time where residents need confidence to move forward and at a time where our artists need support to continue to create remarkable pieces of art. The unveiling of Over Floe is just a taste of what’s to come and I am looking forward to the launch of Toronto’s Year of Public Art 2021-2022. I encourage residents across our city to participate over the coming year and to learn more about the public art in our city and the talented artists behind it.”\n\n– Mayor John Tory\n\n“Toronto artists have been hit hard by measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. As we expand our efforts to reopen, providing opportunities for artists to share their work and vision with the public will be crucial to Toronto’s cultural and economic recovery.”\n\n– Deputy Mayor Michael Thompson (Scarborough Centre) Chair of the Economic and Community Development Committee\n\n“In its breadth and its vision, ArtworxTO carries incredible promise for Toronto: support for artists, animation of our public spaces, and a city-wide invitation to return to commerce and community.”\n\n– Councillor Gary Crawford (Scarborough Southwest), Co-Chair of the Mayor’s External Advisory Committee for the Year of Public Art"
