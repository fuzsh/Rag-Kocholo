        "text": "The mayor of Canadian city Toronto has resigned unexpectedly after admitting to a relationship with a former staff member.\n\nJohn Tory's announcement came shortly after the Toronto Star, external newspaper reported he had an affair with the 31-year-old woman - whom he did not name.\n\nHe said the affair started during the Covid-19 pandemic and was \"ended mutually by consent this year\".\n\nThe 68-year-old called the relationship \"a serious error in judgement.\"\n\nIn a statement Mr Tory said: \"I am deeply sorry, and I apologise unreservedly to the people of Toronto, and to all of those hurt by my actions.\n\n\"Most of all, I apologise to my wife, Barb and to my family who I've let down more than anyone else,\" he added.\n\nMr Tory said he would work with city employees and deputy mayor Jennifer McKelvie to ensure an orderly transition to a new administration.\n\nHe added: \"I deeply regret having to step away from a job that I love in a city that I love even more.\n\n\"I believe, in my heart, it is best to fully commit myself to the work that is required to repair these most important (family) relationships as well.\"\n\nHe took office in December 2014 having beaten Doug Ford and Olivia Chow in the election.\n\nMr Tory was re-elected in 2018 and clinched a third term in office four years later.\n\nA by-election at a later date will be held to determine an elected successor to Mr Tory."
