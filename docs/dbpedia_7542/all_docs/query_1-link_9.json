        "text": "John Tory will remain in his role as mayor for Wednesday's budget meeting, days after announcing he would step down following a relationship with a former staffer, the city's budget chief confirms.\n\nOn Friday, Tory said he was resigning after having a relationship with a former employee in his office, something he called a \"serious error in judgment\" that risked \"tarnishing\" the city's top job.\n\nTory's budget chief, Coun. Gary Crawford, said the mayor is committed to staying on to push the 2023 budget though council, where deliberations could potentially drag on for weeks.\n\n\"This is an incredibly important budget for the City of Toronto after a challenging time, and we need his leadership,\" Crawford told reporters Monday.\n\n\"He has been a strong leader for this budget, a strong leader for this city. He needs to continue doing that. I do not want to play politics with this budget, it's too important.\"\n\nTory played a major role in crafting the proposed budget. Under the \"strong mayor\" powers created by the province last year, he only needed the support of one-third of councillors to pass it — though in reality his support base far exceeds that share.\n\nThe province has said the powers, including a veto over council changes to the budget, would not transfer to an interim or acting mayor.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Tory's office told CBC Toronto that he will be attending Wednesday's meeting to \"ensure the 2023 City of Toronto operating and capital budgets are finalized.\n\n\"The budget makes key investments in housing, transit, and community safety and the Mayor will be working to ensure it is approved,\" said Tory spokesperson Taylor Deasley.\n\nThe move appeared to be a way for Tory to preserve his \"strong mayor\" powers, a political observer said.\n\n\"It's a play to hold on to what I would characterize as uncollegial and ultimately undemocratic strong powers over the rest of council,\" said Myer Siemiatycki, professor emeritus of politics at Toronto Metropolitan University.\n\nIf Tory had resigned before the budget passed, some councillors may have looked to seize the chance to undo some of his controversial proposals, Siemiatycki said, including a $48.3-million hike to the police budget and cuts to transit service.\n\n'Further details' of resignation to come: Tory's office\n\nCouncillors could also try to undo the Tory-backed decision to scrap a recommendation to keep the city's warming centres for the homeless population open until mid-April, Siemiatycki said. But a successful challenge is significantly harder to mount with Tory in the mayor's chair, he said.\n\nIf Tory does veto a council change to the budget, it could add weeks to the budget process and his tenure. If council amends the budget, the mayor has up to 10 days to exercise his veto, according to budget scenarios published by the city. After that, council then has up to 15 days to vote to override the veto.\n\nTory's office said he met with Deputy Mayor Jennifer McKelvie and city staff Monday morning to talk about how best to ensure \"an orderly transition,\" signalling his intention to leave once budget talks are complete.\n\nDeasley noted \"further details\" on the transition will be announced after the budget meeting.\n\nAs of Monday morning, the city confirmed that Tory had not submitted a letter of resignation to the city clerk, noting that he remains in his role as mayor.\n\nWondering what Tory's resignation means for the city? CBC Toronto answered some big questions here.\n\nTory should stay on for budget, some allies say\n\nSome councillors expressed support for Tory to stay in the mayor's seat until the budget is passed, earlier in the day Monday.\n\nSpeaking to CBC Radio's Metro Morning, veteran Coun. Shelley Carroll said she expects the budget deliberations to be \"very contentious.\" There are several provisions in the budget, such as an additional $48 million for Toronto police and clawbacks to TTC service, which have drawn significant criticism from some councillors.\n\nCoun. Anthony Perruzza, who has held a seat since 2006, told CBC Toronto he would prefer if Tory put off resigning until after the budget is passed.\n\n\"After all, it is his budget,\" he said. \"I think that for us, that would be the simplest way forward.\"\n\nWATCH | Tory says he will step down in stunning announcement Friday:\n\nCoun. James Pasternak, who represents Ward 6, York Centre, also said he thinks Tory should wait to step down, and that his presence at the budget debate could prevent it from devolving into a \"chaotic mess.\"\n\nAsked whether he believes Tory retains the moral authority to preside over the meeting, Pasternak did not answer directly, but conceded it will be difficult for Tory if he chooses to wait.\n\n\"I think he's going to have a tough time on the council floor keeping that package together. You bet there is going to be a lot of discussions and cross motions and lively debate,\" he said Monday."
