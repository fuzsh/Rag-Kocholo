Now in its seventh year, the program has become an important and highly anticipated event for the Toronto land use community.\n\nDuring the event, Mayor Tory was joined on stage by John Duffy, principal of the government relations and advocacy firm, StrategyCorp. The pair discussed a wide range of topics, from the finer points of his growth and transit agenda for the city to his long and diverse career in business, law and politics.\n\nULI Toronto has made the Fireside Chat with Mayor Tory available to view in its entirety."
