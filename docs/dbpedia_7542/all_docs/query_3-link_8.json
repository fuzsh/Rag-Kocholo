        "text": "Former Toronto Mayor John Tory has people reacting online with mixed thoughts on the announcement of his new job title.\n\nBell Media announced Tory will be joining NEWSTALK 1010 and CTV News as a Municipal Affairs Expert. He’ll also be making weekly appearances on “Moore in the Morning,” “Power Play with Vassy Kapelos” and “CP24 Live at 5.”\n\nHis new role will provide insight as a political analyst across all platforms and contribute to the upcoming Mississauga mayoral by-election coverage.\n\nHowever, some people took to social media and joked about his new Municipal Affairs title, after he resigned from the mayor’s office back in February following news of his extramarital affair with a former staffer.\n\n“Since he got his new radio show everybody is making the same joke about John Tory being the expert on “municipal affairs,” and why not, perfect joke.”\n\n“He is an expert on affairs alright,” one user on X said.\n\n“Well I do know he has a strong background in having affairs – is this a show for for cheaters?” another said.\n\nMeanwhile, others are showing support for Tory with congratulations.\n\n“Glad to have him back on the air,” one user said.\n\nAnother user commented, “Love hearing him on the radio.”\n\nAdditionally, before Tory was mayor he hosted the weekday afternoon program “The Live Drive on Toronto’s NEWSTALK 1010” from 2009 to 2014."
