After a long day, which included a public briefing on the state of Toronto’s affairs, the mayor-elect made his way from a sterile conference room at City Hall to his old stomping grounds at the more tastefully appointed headquarters of Rogers Communications to take care of some paperwork.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Barbara Shecter, Joe O'Connor, Gabriel Friedman, and others.\n\nDaily content from Financial Times, the world's leading global business publication.\n\nUnlimited online access to read articles from Financial Post, National Post and 15 news sites across Canada with one account.\n\nNational Post ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Barbara Shecter, Joe O'Connor, Gabriel Friedman and others.\n\nDaily content from Financial Times, the world's leading global business publication.\n\nUnlimited online access to read articles from Financial Post, National Post and 15 news sites across Canada with one account.\n\nNational Post ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\n[np_storybar title=”John Tory paints ‘realistic picture’ of Toronto’s biggest challenges in ‘state of the city’ address” link=”http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/11/28/john-tory-lays-out-torontos-biggest-challenges-in-state-of-the-city-address/”]\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nThe mayor of Bay Street: John Tory sharpens his boardroom skills for Toronto's City Hall Back to video\n\nToronto’s new mayor says he had never been more optimistic about the future of the city. But, boy, does it have a lot of problems. In a ‘‘state of the city’’ address on Thursday, John Tory listed his new dominion’s many foibles in a bid to paint a “realistic picture” of the challenges confronting Toronto. The Post’s Natalie Alcoba lists the top 10\n\n[/np_storybar]\n\nAfter more than 20 years with the telecommunications giant as an executive and director, Mr. Tory was officially resigning from the company’s board of directors, severing deep familial corporate ties, likely for good. He had already stepped down from the boards of supermarket chain Metro Inc. and restaurant chain Cara Operations Ltd. earlier in the week, but none of them had as much personal connection to the incoming mayor as did Rogers. “My hand shook when I had to resign from those boards because I was so regretful I had to give them up,” he says. “By the time I’m done here in eight years, I’ll be 68 years old and probably too old for most boards.”\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFor a card-carrying member of the Canadian business establishment, considered the best-connected person in the city, Mr. Tory shouldn’t lose much sleep over that. Born into wealth and privilege, his godfather was cable czar Edward S. Rogers. He once ran the venerable law firm Torys LLP that bears the family name. He has the CEOs of Canada’s biggest banks on speed dial. But while Mr. Tory swims in the waters of Corporate Canada, he is a different species of fish, as his most recent switch from talk-radio host to Toronto’s mayor suggests. “I was very much a part of Bay Street,” he says, “but I was not a product of that.”\n\nYet he is the scion of a family that helped shape many of Canada’s largest and most enduring business empires and many of this country’s most significant corporate players: the billionaire Thomson family; that of the late Ted Rogers; and the founding family of the Toronto Star company. Throughout much of his working life as a broadcaster, politician and businessman, the mayor-elect tapped into jobs at many of the places with close family ties. He agrees his latest role at the helm of Canada’s largest city will be the most challenging executive position he’s ever taken on. “I didn’t come into this with my eyes closed.”\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe just don’t have enough good guys like John\n\nAfter all, when he moves into the mayor’s office along Toronto’s Bay Street Tuesday, it will mark the first time in his privileged life that Mr. Tory will be working outside the comfortable confines of the family fold. Yet, he comes to politics — after years of failed tries — as a card-carrying member of the Canadian business establishment where connections and civility matter more than fierce competition and the naked pursuit of wealth. He is arguably the bluest Blue Chip mayor that has ever taken office in this country.\n\nSome of his friends in high places offer high praise — although others caution that Mr. Tory never had to develop the sheer force of will that climbing tall ladders, and playing politics, require.\n\n“He’s a first-class guy,” offered Gord Nixon, newly retired CEO of Royal Bank of Canada. “We just don’t have enough good guys like John,” said Graham Savage, a friend and a long-time corporate director (including at Postmedia Network Inc., which owns the National Post).\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nHe may be exceedingly likeable, agreeable and brimming with good intentions, motivated by what Bank of Montreal CEO Bill Downe described as “a strong sense of purpose.” But some in Mr. Tory’s circle of friends and associates privately worry that he may be naïve to what lies ahead. “His problem will be getting people to work together. He’s got to find a way to get people to vote with him; it’s a barter system,” said a former business associate and friend who did not want his name used out of concern of hurting their relationship. “He’s too nice a guy for that. He may be too nice for this job.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAnd it’s true that Mr. Tory is not cut from the same cloth as a typical Bay Street dealmaker. “He wouldn’t know how to do a merger or a takeover,” says another family friend. “He wouldn’t know how to put together a corporate deal. He’s never done any of that as a lawyer or a businessman.”\n\nInstead, Mr. Tory has built an impressive career wafting through the formidable sphere of influence that has surrounded his family long before he arrived on the scene. His first summer job at 17 was as a radio reporter at stations owned by Ted Rogers, with whom his father — John Arnold Tory — had a close affiliation as a corporate adviser and board director.\n\nAfter graduating from Osgoode Hall law school at York University, Mr. Tory signed on with the family’s influential law firm, Tory, Tory, DesLauriers and Binnington (now Torys LLP), founded by his grandfather John Steward Donald Tory in 1949 and transformed by Mr. Tory’s father and uncle James Marshall Tory into one of Bay Street’s powerhouse corporate law firms.\n\nHis grandfather was instrumental in establishing the University of Toronto law school in 1949 — where his father and uncle would become star students — but when John Tory didn’t make the cut, he insisted that his father not pull any strings to get him in. “I just missed. I was on the waiting list and it was a disappointment to my dad, more so than me but I didn’t let my dad call anybody or do anything about it.” He laughs about the fact that Robert Prichard, the law school’s former dean and later CEO of Torstar Corp., to this day still jokingly apologizes for the rejection.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMr. Tory worked at the family firm from 1980 to 1995 — save for a four-year hiatus during which he served as principal secretary for former Ontario premier William Davis; his family having longstanding ties to the provincial Progressive Conservatives. He held several roles as partner, manager partner and member of the executive committee, although he admits he was “never in the traditional mode of a lawyer” for the 12 years he practiced law. Deeply involved in the political and social firmament of the city, Mr. Tory focused his energy on government relations.\n\nIn 1995, he raised eyebrows when, despite having almost no high-level corporate experience, he landed one of the most senior executive positions in the country. Just over 40, he was appointed CEO of Rogers Media on the heels of a blockbuster $3.1-billion deal that saw the cable giant acquire Maclean Hunter Ltd., saddling Rogers with crushing debt and a stable of newspapers and magazines the company had no experiencing in managing.\n\n“When I became an executive, I did not follow the traditional route of getting there, I am the first to admit that,” Mr. Tory said. “Ted Rogers called me up and he had enough confidence that I could run the companies… but I didn’t follow the route of going in as a middle manager and working my way up.”\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAfter four years at the helm of the media operations — and also commissioner of the Canadian Football League — the still young Mr. Tory was promoted to lead Rogers Cable in 1999, where he stayed until a run for mayor in 2003 (he lost to David Miller).\n\nJust as he did when his opponents suggested during this year’s long, at times gritty, mayoralty campaign, Mr. Tory still visibly bristles at suggestions that he’s been handed opportunities, rather than earned them. “I was an activist CEO, I had to be to work for Ted Rogers, who was as demanding as anyone you could ever work for,” he said. “I couldn’t have survived in those jobs if I weren’t tough enough.”\n\nMr. Savage, chief financial officer at Rogers at the time Mr. Tory was at the company, said any senior executive working for Ted Rogers ended up overshadowed by the potency of the maverick cable magnate himself.\n\n“Ted was so dominant, he tried to run everything and tried to call all the shots,” Mr. Savage recalled. “It’s hard to gauge John independent of that, and it’s hard to gauge any of us for that matter, although in my view he was a good executive.” Mr. Savage, who is among the group of former and outgoing Rogers executives with whom Mr. Tory remains close — others include Colin Watson, Philip Lind and Anthony Viner — said they “were united against Ted, most of the time” and that Mr. Tory was the most “irreverent” of the bunch, willing to stand up to the volatile founder. But then, none of the other executives had the last name of Tory.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nYet Mr. Tory clearly remained drawn to the world of the public. As a senior Rogers’ executive, he hosted a public affairs program on Rogers Cable’s community access channel.\n\nAfter his defeat to David Miller in the 2003 Toronto mayoralty campaign, his Bay Street friends counseled him to step back and decompress. Geoff Beattie, chief adviser to the Thomson family (a role once held by Mr. Tory’s father) and BMO’s Mr. Downe both suggested he try corporate directorships where he could lend his experience and expertise, rather than resuming the responsibilities of operating a company. He was invited to join the boards of Metro and Cara, and took his seat again on the Rogers board.\n\nHe has a remarkable ability to get things done working with people rather than against people\n\n“I loved running a company but I really enjoyed being on boards and watching how they work and having a positive influence on how they work without the responsibility of how they performed,” he explained. He heightened his work in philanthropy, leveraging his contacts on Bay Street to help find work for skilled immigrants.\n\nBut politics called again, taking him back to the Ontario provincial Progressive Conservative party in 2004, this time as leader, until his electoral defeat (largely the result of a controversy stoked by the Liberals over religious-school funding) in 2007, where he failed to win his riding from Kathleen Wynne, now Ontario’s premier. He waited for a seat to open up in a byelection; and two long years later, when it did, and he lost again, he resigned. After a career in lush corner offices and fruitlessly chasing political leadership, he settled in, somewhat curiously, hosting drive-time talk radio at Toronto’s CFRB, a station founded (but no longer owned) by the Rogers family.\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nDuring the tumultuous reign of Rob Ford, Mr. Tory was persuaded to try once more for the mayor’s seat. Eventually competing against Mr. Ford’s brother, Doug (the outgoing mayor dropped out following a cancer diagnosis), he finally prevailed last month, winning 40% of the vote, to Doug Ford’s 34%.\n\nMr. Tory will be the first Toronto mayor in a century to have never warmed a seat on city council. This has some of his personal backers feeling uneasy; getting along on boards and charities with like-minded Rosedalers, they say, is very different from trying to herd the diverse opinions of 44 elected city councilors. Any attempt to lead by consensus, they fear, may only result in paralysis. “He’s a positive person and sometimes it’s harder for him to make decisions because he likes consensus,” said one.\n\n“I don’t buy that,” scoffed Mr. Nixon. “I think that he is by nature quite conciliatory and frankly, I can’t think of an attribute that is more useful when you are trying to corral city hall. We have a weak-mayor system [holding just one vote on council], so the mayor needs to be able to work with people, to negotiate with people and to get along with people. He has a remarkable ability to get things done working with people rather than against people.”\n\nAdvertisement 10\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAnd the mayor-elect believes everything he’s done in his career has readied him well for the job as mayor, whether it was running the partnership at the Torys law firm — where he had no power to order senior partners around, except to convince them the firm was heading in the right direction — or getting his management team at Rogers to buy into his strategic plan.\n\n“Every one of the responsibilities is the same, except that here, you don’t have a lever to open the trap door to get rid of people if they don’t execute,” he smiled. On a more serious note, he added, “I couldn’t have run the companies that I ran, including working for a guy like Ted Rogers, if I wasn’t prepared to be tough myself. Yes, I think I attract more bees with honey in terms of the way you incent people to work for you and produce results, but if I couldn’t make tough decisions, I couldn’t have lasted.”\n\nIn fact, Mr. Tory said he fashioned himself after business leaders like the late Ted Rogers; former Toronto Dominion Bank CEO Ed Clark; and Richard Venn, senior executive vice-president at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce — men who demonstrated strong social consciences but were inclined to demonstrate it through business, rather than public service.\n\nAdvertisement 11\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Tory released a statement declaring the steps he would be taking to divide his personal interests from his work on the city. Given his network of ties, it was not a short list. There were his corporate directorships: now all resigned. His son, John, is the CEO of an airline affected by policies around Toronto’s City Centre Airport. His wife, Barbara Hackett, is president of a residential home developer that might be affected by city planning decisions.
