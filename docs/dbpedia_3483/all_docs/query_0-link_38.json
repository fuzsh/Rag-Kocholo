        "text": "from Marabunta\n\n7 (Migrant Intermission)\n\n(from Transhumant Ceiberos)\n\nBehind, the deaf roll of the Suchiate River:\n\nblood rows against the current of veins and stops,\n\nit bites chunks of bend, it kisses the shore with water lips,\n\nit drips thirst and drowns the sea that roams\n\nthe body inside:\n\nblack iceberg that traverses the eyes and the night.\n\nI remember bouts of insomnia along the trail:\n\nthere is no wing in my hand, only emptiness,\n\nemptiness that beats like a trill:\n\nI close my fist and smother a bird\n\nthat chirps silence among the branches of darkness.\n\nFrom Central America come memories crossing this river:\n\nI hear them split stones and the riverbed\n\nthat bears the weight through the deep breathe\n\nof its waters.\n\nOn the shore, on the riverside’s sepia beaches,\n\nthere is an angel squatted down. He’s blinded,\n\nas blinded I am by the journey\n\nand the beatings of sun and torture.\n\nThe angel flutters black light, it makes with the wind\n\ninvisible crusts. He places the fingers of his left hand\n\non the sand and reads —celestial braille—\n\nthe infinite book of chaos.\n\nHe stands erect and walks upon the oily waters\n\nof the river (I must say here: the angel slits the throat\n\nof the dense jugular of the night). The angel mists,\n\na fog that falls and dissolves wings\n\nwhile whistles fireflies and spits out a moth.\n\nHe chews and savors the left-handed and black\n\nphonemes.\n\nLater he extends the palm of his right hand\n\ninside the fog that envelopes it: he braills\n\nthe droplets of the water’s vapor and reads them,\n\njust like I read the last figure of my blood on the sand.\n\n10 (Migrant Intermission)\n\n(from Transhumant Ceiberos)\n\nThe distance, that green notebook spiraled tightly\n\nby a long umbilical cord made of asphalt,\n\na coal tongue: black verb. Posts pass by my side,\n\nbare and unbent trees, upright charcoals,\n\npencils drowned in pitch that take aim,\n\nthat write abbreviations on heaven’s face\n\nwhere dark lightnings and orange blossom clouds\n\nmake of the evening an oil painting of iodized indigo.\n\nFrom the poles hang invisible fronds\n\nstrangled with copper nooses: nomadic cords\n\non which birds dangle and winged notes take flight,\n\nhanged in this vertical sky: a wide and vaulted ceiling,\n\nGod’s voice that plays his border melody.\n\nIn this immovable bus window I travel drowned in tar,\n\nbitumen or asphalt:\n\nI write on carbon paper on which march white\n\nletters that follow dashes, also niveous:\n\nthe Pan-American highway is an endless line,\n\nan interminable and black sea that touches, at the end,\n\nthe edge of dreams, this abyss, this country,\n\nthis border.\n\n6 (Orlin Dreams Out Loud)\n\n(from God’s Cyclops)\n\nThe night lays out to die on the platforms.\n\nThe sun rolls along the sweaty rails\n\nand cuts off into shadows the stumps of the day.\n\nThe sun is a migrant that carries its amber hump\n\nuntil it sinks into the jaws of the sky:\n\nwater well, airless scream, the future’s toothless mouth.\n\n(I approach the water well. I throw a bucket of thirst\n\ninto its throat. The pully squeaks with rust.\n\nThe rope sweats splinters of light to tie up the water.\n\nI pull the cord and the music of my chest\n\ntenses my veins.\n\nI sink my tongue in the pail that the night has filled:\n\nI take it out smeared, drenched in shadows,\n\ninked like sea glass in the silence: drowned in blood).\n\nThirst returns and walks barefoot\n\non these long rails that know me by heart.\n\nThe night caresses, spells without name all it touches:\n\nI board a train that comes again and again\n\nuntil that day in which the bastards of death\n\n(migra, narcos, policemen, crooks)\n\ntouch my shoulder and mutilate my dreams:\n\nit is better to throw oneself onto the night’s guillotine\n\nand die under the wheels of La Bestia\n\nthat are a lesser burden than hate.\n\n4\n\n(from The Edges of the World)\n\nMy mother mends the edges of the world with the pointed bone of her sleepless heart. Thinking of us, she has not slept, from afar her hands are on our heads, in the green and sinuous distance that divides Soconusco from Guatemala, measurable only in kilometers of hate. Seated facing her sewing machine, tucked in by the dense forest of pins and cloths that surround her, she threads the long scar that traverses her womb in one single and unbreakable cord that passes through the solar eye of her needle: she will sew together the broken waters of the Suchiate River in one single and immense cloth to embroider in it these images and listen closely to the buzzing of our blood, she will sew together the two edges of the frontier’s border as if they were the stumps of a wounded animal, she will sew together the blood of two countries divided by ignorance, she will sew together our tongue and our eyelids with the amniotic thread of her love to avoid the possibility that some day we be reflected in the mirror of barbarity, she will mend again the borders of the world to our vertebrae with the blue thread of the migrants: mother, perhaps we will never return because we do not have a place or bed or fire to return home to, the entire country has died, perhaps we are all dead and we speak this childlike language so that you may sleep, shrouded in the waters of silence. We cross the liquid night of the Suchiate, uterus that drowns us in its amniotic and bloodied depth, but we dream of you, mother, of the caress of your hands that mending light in our eyelids, sewing salt into our back.\n\nSleep tight, mother, the rumor of the river’s waters will drag the music of our broken and tired bodies until they curl up in your hands: tomorrow you will mend the river’s waters of our sleepless and weary errant heart.\n\n4\n\n(from Las Orillas Del Mundo)\n\nMi madre zurce las orillas del mundo con el agudo hueso de su corazón insomne. No ha dormido pensando en nosotros, en lo lejos que están sus manos de nuestros cabellos, en la distancia verde y sinuosa que separa Soconusco de Guatemala, medible sólo en kilómetros de odio. Sentada frente a su máquina de coser, arropada por el tupido bosque de alfileres y telas que la rodea, enhebra la larga cicatriz que atraviesa su vientre en un solo e irrompible cáñamo que pasa por el ojo solar de su aguja: coserá las aguas rotas del río Suchiate en una sola e inmensa tela para bordar en ella estas imágenes y escuchar de cerca el zumbido de nuestra sangre, coserá las dos orillas de la frontera como si fuesen los muñones de un animal herido, coserá la sangre de dos patrias divididas por la ignorancia, coserá nuestra lengua y nuestros párpados con el hilo amniótico de su amor para evitar que algún día nos reflejemos en el espejo de la barbarie, zurcirá de nuevo las orillas del mundo a nuestras vértebras con el hilo azul de los migrantes: madre, quizá nunca tornemos porque no tenemos sitio ni cama ni hoguera donde volver, la patria entera ha muerto, tal vez todos estemos muertos y hablemos este idioma de niños para que duermas, envuelta en las aguas del silencio. Nosotros cruzamos la noche líquida del Suchiate, útero que nos ahoga en su hondura amniótica y sanguínea, pero soñamos con vos, madre, con la caricia de tus manos zurciendo luz en nuestros párpados, cosiendo sal en nuestra espalda.\n\nDuerme tranquila, madre, el rumor de las aguas del río arrastrará la música de nuestros cuerpos rotos y cansados hasta ovillarse en tus manos: mañana zurcirás las aguas del río a nuestro insomne y cansado corazón errante.\n\nBalam Rodrigo (Villa Comaltitlán, Soconusco, Chiapas, 1974) is a former footballer, biologist, and writer.
