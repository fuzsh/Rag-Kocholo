        "text": "The Importance of Titles\n\nThe title of your manuscript is usually the first introduction readers (and reviewers) have to your work. Therefore, you must select a title that grabs attention, accurately describes the contents of your manuscript, and makes people want to read further.\n\nAn effective title should:\n\nConvey the main topics of the study\n\nHighlight the importance of the research\n\nBe concise\n\nAttract readers\n\nWriting a good title for your manuscript can be challenging. First, list the topics covered by the manuscript. Try to put all of the topics together in the title using as few words as possible. A title that is too long will seem clumsy, annoy readers, and probably not meet journal requirements.\n\nExample:\n\nDoes Vaccinating Children and Adolescents with Inactivated Influenza Virus Inhibit the Spread of Influenza in Unimmunized Residents of Rural Communities?\n\nThis title has too many unnecessary words.\n\nInfluenza Vaccination of Children: A Randomized Trial\n\nThis title doesn’t give enough information about what makes the manuscript interesting.\n\nEffect of Child Influenza Vaccination on Infection Rates in Rural Communities: A Randomized Trial\n\nThis is an effective title. It is short, easy to understand, and conveys the important aspects of the research.\n\nThink about why your research will be of interest to other scientists. This should be related to the reason you decided to study the topic. If your title makes this clear, it will likely attract more readers to your manuscript.\n\nTIP: Write down a few possible titles, and then select the best to refine further. Ask your colleagues their opinion. Spending the time needed to do this will result in a better title.\n\nAbstract and Keywords\n\nThe Abstract is:\n\nA summary of the content of the journal manuscript\n\nA time-saving shortcut for busy researchers\n\nA guide to the most important parts of your manuscript’s written content\n\nMany readers will only read the Abstract of your manuscript. Therefore, it has to be able to stand alone. In most cases the abstract is the only part of your article that appears in indexing databases such as Web of Science or PubMed and so will be the most accessed part of your article; making a good impression will encourage researchers to read your full paper.\n\nA well written abstract can also help speed up the peer-review process. During peer review, referees are usually only sent the abstract when invited to review the paper. Therefore, the abstract needs to contain enough information about the paper to allow referees to make a judgement as to whether they have enough expertise to review the paper and be engaging enough for them to want to review it.\n\nYour Abstract should answer these questions about your manuscript:\n\nWhat was done?\n\nWhy did you do it?\n\nWhat did you find?\n\nWhy are these findings useful and important?\n\nAnswering these questions lets readers know the most important points about your study, and helps them decide whether they want to read the rest of the paper. Make sure you follow the proper journal manuscript formatting guidelines when preparing your abstract.\n\nTIP: Journals often set a maximum word count for Abstracts, often 250 words, and no citations. This is to ensure that the full Abstract appears in indexing services.\n\nKeywords are a tool to help indexers and search engines find relevant papers. If database search engines can find your journal manuscript, readers will be able to find it too. This will increase the number of people reading your manuscript, and likely lead to more citations.\n\nHowever, to be effective, Keywords must be chosen carefully. They should:\n\nRepresent the content of your manuscript\n\nBe specific to your field or sub-field\n\nExamples:\n\nManuscript title: Direct observation of nonlinear optics in an isolated carbon nanotube\n\nPoor keywords: molecule, optics, lasers, energy lifetime\n\nBetter keywords: single-molecule interaction, Kerr effect, carbon nanotubes, energy level structure\n\nManuscript title: Region-specific neuronal degeneration after okadaic acid administration\n\nPoor keywords: neuron, brain, OA (an abbreviation), regional-specific neuronal degeneration, signaling\n\nBetter keywords: neurodegenerative diseases; CA1 region, hippocampal; okadaic acid; neurotoxins; MAP kinase signaling system; cell death\n\nManuscript title: Increases in levels of sediment transport at former glacial-interglacial transitions\n\nPoor keywords: climate change, erosion, plant effects\n\nBetter keywords: quaternary climate change, soil erosion, bioturbation"
