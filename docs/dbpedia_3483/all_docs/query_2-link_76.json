        "text": "Summary\n\nWith a narrative apparatus as complex as it is beautiful, Eco’s work gives the reader both a clear defense of semiotics and an intricate detective story. Both facets are framed by an unfinished story, the narrative of a scholar who finds an interesting tale within a number of manuscripts. Perhaps because the space this framing story is given is so slight compared with the density of what is to follow or perhaps because of the tone of the scholar, these first few pages remain with the reader as the text goes back to the source of the manuscripts in the early 14th century.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Novels, First Lines Quiz\n\nIn 1327 a young Benedictine novice, Adso of Melk, and a learned Franciscan, William of Baskerville, visit a Benedictine monastery in northern Italy for a theological debate. The abbot, Abo of Fossanova, asks William to look into the recent death of the illuminator Adelmo of Otranto, who fell from the octagonal Aedificium, which houses the abbey’s labyrinthine library; William is barred from entering the library itself, however. That evening William debates with the monks about the theological uses of laughter; an elderly blind monk, Jorge of Burgos, condemns laughter as disruptive.\n\nThe next morning another monk, the translator Venantius of Salvamec, is found dead in a vat of pig’s blood. William learns about a secret entrance to the library, and a monk tells him that Adelmo had a sexual relationship with Berengar, the assistant librarian, and likely committed suicide out of shame. William and Adso enter the library and get thoroughly lost before finding their way back out.\n\nOn the third day, Abo tells William and Adso that Berengar has disappeared. William deciphers a clue left by Venantius about a book that was stolen from him, and they also learn from the herbalist Severinus that ink stains were found on Venantius’s fingers and tongue. The next morning Berengar’s body is found in a bath.\n\nThe expected Franciscan legation and representatives of the pope arrive for the debate, and among them is the inquisitor Bernard Gui, who arrests two monks, Salvatore and the cellarer Remigio, for heresy; both had been members of an Apostolic sect. Bernard Gui frightens Remigio into confessing not only to heresy but also, falsely, to the murders.\n\nSeverinus is then found murdered in his apartment, and a mysterious manuscript that he had told William that he found is missing. On the morning of the sixth day, the librarian Malachi collapses and dies during morning prayers; ink stains are observed on his fingers. William believes that there is a connection between the murders and the Book of Revelation. He also thinks that those who know about the mysterious manuscript are being killed. However, Abo wants William to stop his investigations."
