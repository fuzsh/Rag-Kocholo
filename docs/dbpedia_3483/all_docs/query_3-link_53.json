        "text": "A business letter is a formal letter. Unlike a résumé or cover letter, it can be more than one page, and is likely to contain six parts:\n\n1. The Heading\n\nThe heading contains the return address with the date on the last line. Sometimes it is necessary to include a line before the date with a phone number, fax number, or e-mail address. Often there is a line skipped between the address and the date. It is not necessary to type a return address if you are using stationery with the return address already imprinted, but you should always use a date. Make sure the heading is on the left margin.\n\nExample:\n\nMs. Jane Doe\n\n543 Washington St\n\nMarquette, MI 49855\n\nTel:\n\nFax:\n\nEmail:\n\nJune 28, 2011\n\n2. Recipient’s Address\n\nThis is the address you are sending your letter to. Be sure to make it as complete as possible so it gets to its destination. Always include title names (such as Dr.) if you know them. This is, like the other address, on the left margin. If a standard 8 ½” x 11” paper is folded in thirds to fit in a standard 9” business envelope, the inside address should appear through the window in the envelope (if there is one). Be sure to skip a line after the heading and before the recipient’s address, then skip another line after the inside address before the greeting. For an example, see the end of this sheet for a sample letter.\n\n3. The Salutation\n\nThe salutation (or greeting) in a business letter is always formal. It often begins with “Dear {Person’s name}.” Once again, be sure to include the person’s title if you know it (such as Ms., Mrs., Mr., or Dr). If you’re unsure about the person’s title or gender then just use their first name. For example, you would use only the person’s first name if the person you are writing to is “Jordan” and you do not know whether they identify as male, female, or non-binary.\n\nThe salutation always ends with a colon.\n\n4. The Body\n\nThe body is the meat of your letter. For block and modified block letter formats, single space and left justify each paragraph. Be sure to leave a blank line between each paragraph, however, no matter the format. Be sure to also skip a line between the salutation and the body, as well as the body and the close.\n\n5. The Complimentary Close\n\nThe complimentary close is a short and polite remark that ends your letter. The close begins at the same justification as your date and one line after the last body paragraph. Capitalize the first word of your closing (Thank you) and leave four lines for a signature between the close and the sender’s name. A comma should follow the closing.\n\n6. The Signature Line\n\nSkip at least four lines after the close for your signature, and then type out the name to be signed. If you are printing this letter out and sending it by mail, you will sign your name in pen. This line will include your first and last name, and often includes a middle initial, although it is not required. You may put your title beforehand to show how you wish to be addressed (Ms., Mrs., Dr.).\n\nThe signature should be in blue or black ink.\n\n7. Enclosures\n\nIf you have any enclosed documents, such as a resume, you can indicate this by typing “Enclosures” one line below the listing. You also may include the name of each document.\n\nFormat and Font\n\nMany organizations have their own style for writing a business letter, but here are some common examples.\n\nBlock\n\nThe most common layout for a business letter is called a block format. In this format, the entire letter is justified to the left and single spaced except for a double space between paragraphs.\n\nModified Block\n\nModified block is another popular type of business letter. The body of the letter and the sender’s and recipient’s addresses are left justified and single spaced. However, in this format, the date and closing are tabbed to the center point.\n\nSemi-Block\n\nThe least used style is called a semi-block. In it each paragraph is indented instead of left justified.\n\nFont\n\nThe standard font for business letters is Times New Roman, size 12. However, fonts that are clear to read such as Arial may be used."
