        "text": "Award: Shortlist\n\nShortlist / Direction / Film Advertising / 2020\n\nDeveloped with the LGBT+ community and based on the insight that people have used Starbucks to try out their chosen names, Every Name’s A Story tells the story of James, who is deadnamed and misgendered every day until this life-affirming moment. Using the £1m media awarded from Channel 4’s Diversity in Advertising Award, it gives airtime to this underrepresented community. With attacks on trans people up 81% this has never been more important. The film has been praised by consumers and press for its authenticity, sensitive direction, and the respectful handling of the subject matter."
