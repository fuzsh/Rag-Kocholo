        "text": "The other answers already draw some really good connections to various parts of Turing's work, be it movie-related or more general. But we don't really need to stop there.\n\nIn fact a big emphasis of the movie, beyond the WWII spy story that already offers many possibilities for \"imitation\", is the rather personal story of Alan Turing and his struggles with being homosexual in a time where that wasn't really accepted at all. So he himself is forced to play an imitation game, imitating a straight man.\n\n(As a side-note, the subtitle to the German version of the movie, \"Ein streng geheimes Leben\" (\"A top secret life\"), while maybe a little bit too much on the nose, emphasises this connection further.)\n\nThis is probably as valid an interpretation as the more technical ones presented in the other answers and the overall title is likely using that ambiguity for evoking meaning on multiple levels this way, just as the story itself juxtaposes Turing's personal problems with his historical achievements.\n\nIt's a reference to the famous \"Turing Test\" - whether an artificial intelligence can convince a human that it itself is human.\n\nTuring's first version of this test was specifically called 'the imitation game'.\n\nThe test was introduced by Turing in his 1950 paper, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", while working at the University of Manchester. It opens with the words: \"I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'\" Because \"thinking\" is difficult to define, Turing chooses to \"replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.\". Turing's new question is: \"Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?\"\n\nTuring test - Imitation Game -\n\nCommon understanding has it that the purpose of the Turing Test is not specifically to determine whether a computer is able to fool an interrogator into believing that it is a human, but rather whether a computer could imitate a human"
