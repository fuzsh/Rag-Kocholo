        "text": "About the Book\n\nTranslation of: Storia del nuovo cognome.\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nA novel in the bestselling quartet about two very different women and their complex friendship: \"Everyone should read anything with Ferrante's name on it\" (The Boston Globe).\n\nThe follow-up to My Brilliant Friend, The Story of a New Name continues the epic New York Times-bestselling literary quartet that has inspired an HBO series, and returns us to the world of Lila and Elena, who grew up together in post-WWII Naples, Italy. In The Story of a New Name, Lila has recently married and made her entr√©e into the family business; Elena, meanwhile, continues her studies and her exploration of the world beyond the neighborhood that she so often finds stifling. Marriage appears to have imprisoned Lila, and the pressure to excel is at times too much for Elena. Yet the two young women share a complex and evolving bond that is central to their emotional lives and a source of strength in the face of life's challenges. In these Neapolitan Novels, Elena Ferrante, \"one of the great novelists of our time\" (The New York Times), gives us a poignant and universal story about friendship and belonging, a meditation on love and jealousy, freedom and commitment--at once a masterfully plotted page-turner and an intense, generous-hearted family saga. \"Imagine if Jane Austen got angry and you'll have some idea of how explosive these works are.\"--The Australian \"Brilliant . . . captivating and insightful . . . the richness of her storytelling is likely to please fans of Sara Gruen and Silvia Avallone.\"--Booklist (starred review)\n\nReview Quotes\n\nPraise for Elena Ferrante and the Neapolitan Novels\n\n\"A large, captivating, amiably peopled bildungsroman.\"--James Wood, The New Yorker\n\n\"One of modern fiction's richest portraits of a friendship.\"--John Powers, NPR's Fresh Air\n\n\"Elena Ferrante is one of the great novelists of our time.\"--Roxana Robinson, The New York Times Book Review\n\n\"Compelling, visceral and immediate...The Neapolitan novels are a tour de force.\"--Jennifer Gilmore, The Los Angeles Times\n\n\"It took my breath away...so honest and right and opens up heart to so much.\"--Elizabeth Strout, writer\n\n\"The Neapolitan novel cycle is an unconditional masterpiece.\"--Jhumpa Lahiri, writer\n\n\"Everyone should read anything with Ferrante's name on it.\"--Eugenia Williamson, The Boston Globe\n\n\"Ferrante's own writing has no limits, is willing to take every thought forward to its most radical conclusion and backwards to its most radical birthing.\"---The New Yorker\n\n\"One of the more nuanced portraits of feminine friendship in recent memory.\"--Megan O'Grady, Vogue\n\n\"It's just hypnotic.
