        "text": "TO NAME THE BIGGER LIE: A Memoir in Two Stories, by Sarah Viren\n\nIt’s an experience I’m betting most of us have had over the last decade: the creeping feeling that a common truth no longer exists. Where once there were facts, now there is strife. Where once there was one America, now there are two. (At least.) Where once there were agreed-upon narratives, now there are competing stories, falsehoods and deceptions.\n\nThe writer Sarah Viren became renowned as the victim of a false narrative when, in 2020, she published an article in The New York Times Magazine titled “The Accusations Were Lies. But Could We Prove It?” In it, she told how, the previous year, her wife, Marta, was accused of sexual harassment and became the subject of a Title IX investigation at Arizona State University, where both women are professors. Eventually the accusations were proved to be the work of a malignant competitor who was attempting to shove a boulder into the middle of the couple’s career path.\n\nNow Viren has written the strange and wonderful “To Name the Bigger Lie,” a memoir that includes this awful tale. But the book is not the one that readers of the original article might expect. The subtitle promises “a memoir in two stories”; doubleness is a crucial theme. The book is preoccupied with twinned phenomena and dual perspectives. It’s a book for our times, when singular truths seem less certain with each passing day.\n\nThe project began life as a more straightforward memoir. In 2016, Viren was unsettled (perhaps too weak a word) by the ascension of Donald Trump and the accompanying surge in conspiracy theories. She was reminded of her experiences growing up in Florida in the 1990s — specifically, of a class at her high school magnet program called “Theory of Knowledge.” The class was taught by Dr. Whiles, a polarizing figure who reveled in provoking his students. Dr. Whiles (a pseudonym) became more and more unhinged during Viren’s years studying with him — or did he? Perhaps his escalating eccentricity was all in aid of discomfiting his students and forcing them to think more independently, more critically."
