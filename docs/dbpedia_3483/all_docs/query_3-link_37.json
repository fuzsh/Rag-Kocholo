        "text": "If you’ve ever read a blog post, you’ve consumed content from a thought leader that is an expert in their industry. Chances are if the blog post was written effectively, you came away with helpful knowledge and a positive opinion about the writer or brand that produced the content.\n\nAnyone can connect with their audience through blogging and enjoy the myriad benefits that blogging provides: organic traffic from search engines, promotional content for social media, and recognition from a new audience you haven’t tapped into yet.\n\nIf you’ve heard about blogging but are a beginner and don’t know where to start, the time for excuses is over. Not only can you create an SEO-friendly blog, but I’ll cover how to write and manage your business's blog as well as provide helpful templates to simplify your blogging efforts.\n\nLet's get started with an important question.\n\nBlogging may mean different things depending on your niche — so let’s begin with this definition.\n\nBlog posts allow you and your business to publish insights, thoughts, and stories on your website about any topic. They can help you boost brand awareness, credibility, conversions, and revenue. Most importantly, they can help you drive traffic to your website.\n\nBut in order to begin making posts for a blog — you have to learn how to start one, first. Let’s dive in.\n\n1. Understand your audience.\n\nBefore you start writing your blog post, make sure you have a clear understanding of your target audience. To do so, take the following steps.\n\nAsk yourself exploratory questions.\n\nTo discover your audience, ask questions like: Who are they? Are they like me, or do I know someone like them? What do they want to know about? What will resonate with them?\n\nJot down your notes in a notepad or a document. This is the time to brainstorm audience attributes from scratch, no matter how out of left field they may feel. You should also think about your audience's age, background, goals, and challenges at this stage.\n\nCarry out market research.\n\nDoing market research sounds like a big task, but in truth, it can be as simple as accessing a social media platform and browsing user and blog profiles that match with your potential audience.\n\nUse market research tools to begin uncovering more specific information about your audience — or to confirm a hunch or a piece of information you already knew. For instance, if you wanted to create a blog about work-from-home hacks, you can make the reasonable assumption that your audience will be mostly Gen Zers and Millennials. But it’s important to confirm this information through research.\n\nCreate formal buyer personas.\n\nOnce you’ve brainstormed and carried out market research, it’s time to create formal buyer personas. It’s important because what you know about your buyer personas and their interests will inform the brainstorming process for blog posts.\n\n\"Buyer personas aren’t just for direct marketing. They can be a handy way to keep a human in mind while you’re writing. If you’ve got other marketing or sales teams handy, coordinate your personas,\" says Curtis del Principe, user acquisition manager at HubSpot. \"Chances are that your existing customers are exactly the kind of people you want to attract with your writing in the first place. Your sales and service teams can also have great insight into these people’s needs and pain points.\"\n\nFor instance, if your readers are Millennials looking to start a business, you probably don't need to provide them with information about getting started on social media — most of them already have that down.\n\nYou might, however, want to give them information about how to adjust their social media approach (for example — from what may be a casual, personal approach to a more business-savvy, networking-focused approach). That kind of tweak is what helps you publish content about the topics your audience really wants and needs.\n\nDon't have buyer personas in place for your business? Here are a few resources to help you get started:\n\nCreate Buyer Personas for Your Business [Free Template]\n\nGuide: How to Create Detailed Buyer Personas for Your Business\n\n[Free Tool] Make My Persona: Buyer Persona Generator\n\n2. Check out your competition.\n\nWhat better way to draw inspiration than to look at your well-established competition?\n\nIt’s worth taking a look at popular, highly reviewed blogs because their strategy and execution is what got them to grow in credibility. The purpose of doing this isn’t to copy these elements, but to gain better insight into what readers appreciate in a quality blog.\n\nWhen you find a competitor’s blog, take the following steps:\n\nDetermine whether they’re actually a direct competitor.\n\nA blog’s audience, niche, and specific slant determine whether they're actually your competitor. But the most important of these is their audience. If they serve a completely different public than you, then they’re likely not a competitor. That is why it’s important to define your buyer personas before taking other steps in the blog creation process.\n\nLook at the blog’s branding, color palette, and theme.\n\nOnce you determine that they’re your competitor, it’s time to take note of their techniques so that you can capture a similar readership. Colors and themes play a huge role in whether you seem like part of a niche — for instance, a blog about eco-friendly products should likely use earthy tones instead of bright, unnatural colors such as neon yellow or pink.\n\nAnalyze the tone and writing style of the competition.\n\nTake note of your competition’s copywriting. Is it something you feel like you can successfully emulate? Does it ring true to the type of blog you’d like to create? What do readers most respond to? For most, creating a tech blog might be an excellent idea, but if journalistic, review-based writing doesn’t work for you, then that might not be a good fit. Be aware of what you can feasibly execute or hire freelance writers.\n\n3. Determine what topics you’ll cover.\n\nBefore you write anything, pick a topic you’d like to write about. The topic can be pretty general to start as you find your desired niche in blogging.\n\nHere are some ways to choose topics to cover.\n\nFind out which topics your competitors often cover.\n\nOne easy way to choose topics for your blog is to simply learn what other blogs are writing about. After you determine your competitors, go through their archive and category pages, and try to find out which topics they most often publish content about. From there, you can create a tentative list to explore further. You might find, for instance, that a competitor only covers surface-level information about a subject. In your blog, you can dive more deeply and offer more value to readers.\n\nChoose topics you understand well.\n\nNo matter what type of blog you start, you want to ensure you know the topic well enough to write authoritatively about it. Rather than choosing a topic you’ll need to research as you write, think about those that come most naturally to you. What has your professional experience been like so far? What are your hobbies? What did you study in college? These can all give rise to potential topics you can cover in depth.\n\nEnsure the topics are relevant to your readership.\n\nYou may find that you hold deep expertise in various topics, but how relevant are they to the audience you understood back in step one?\n\nDel Principe suggests checking in with sales and service teams as well. \"What kinds of things do they wish customers already knew? What kinds of questions do they get asked a thousand times? What kind of objections come up from potential customers, and how do they address them?\"\n\nIf you’re not serving their needs, then you’d be shouting into a void — or, worse, attracting the wrong readership. For that reason, after identifying the topics you can feasibly write about, ask yourself whether those are subjects your audience would like to explore.\n\nDo preliminary keyword research.\n\nKeyword research is the process of searching for topics using a keyword research tool, then determining whether there is demand by looking at each topic’s (or keyword’s) search volume. If you found the perfect topics that are the perfect cross between your expertise and your reader’s needs, you’ve struck gold — but the gold will have no value unless people are searching for those terms. Only then can you capture the audience that is waiting out there.\n\nPro tip: If you need help brainstorming ideas or lack inspiration, you can use HubSpot’s blog topic generator. It can generate title ideas and even outlines based on a brief description of what you want to write about or a specific keyword.\n\n4. Identify your unique angle.\n\nWhat perspective do you bring that makes you stand out from the crowd? This is key to determining the trajectory of your blog’s future, and there are many avenues to choose in the process.\n\nHere’s how you can find your unique selling proposition in crowded blogging niches:\n\nWrite a professional and personal bio.\n\nKnowing your own history and experience is essential to determine your unique slant. To get started, write a professional bio that explains, at length, who you are and which experiences most inform your blogging efforts. While I could write a lengthy exposition about my childhood, that history isn’t essential unless I’m launching a blog about raising children.\n\nWhat unique experience makes you a trusted expert or thought leader on the topic? You can use your answers to that question to find your angle. Use this information to populate your “About me” page on your blog and share more about yourself.\n\nDetermine the special problem you will solve for readers.\n\nYour readers won’t trust you or return to you unless you actively help them solve a problem. As you try to find your angle, think about ways you can help your audience surmount challenges typically associated with the topics you’ve chosen for your blog. For instance, if you’re creating a blog about sustainability, then you might help readers learn how they can compost organic materials in their home.\n\nChoose an editorial approach.\n\nWill you share your opinions on trending debates? Teach your readers how to do something? Compare or share original research? The editorial approach you choose will in part be informed by the topics you cover on your blog and the problems you’re helping your readers solve. If your blog is about marketing trends and your goal is to keep marketers up-to-date on the latest changes, then your editorial approach should be journalistic in nature. This is only one example of how to choose a technique.\n\n5. Name your blog.\n\nThis is your opportunity to get creative and make a name that gives readers an idea of what to expect from your blog. Some tips on how to choose your blog name include:\n\nKeep your blog name easy to say and spell.\n\nNo need to get complicated at all with your name, though it might be tempting, since there are so many blogs out there. While choosing a unique name is essential, it’s also important to choose one that is easy to memorize for readers. It should also be simple to remember as an URL (which will come into play in the next step).\n\nLink your blog name to your brand message.\n\nThe more related your blog’s name is to the topics you cover, the better. For instance, DIY MFA is all about writers doing their own Master of Fine Arts in writing at home. The brand’s message is all about delving deep into one’s writing practice without needing a formal degree. Try to do something similar for your own blog name: Alluding to your blog’s message, value proposition, and covered topics in one sweep.\n\nConsider what your target audience is looking for.\n\nYour blog name should tie directly into what your readers want to achieve, learn, or solve. DIY MFA is about writers who don’t have the money for graduate school, but who still want to develop their writing skills. The HubSpot Marketing blog is — you guessed it — about marketing trends and tips.\n\nIt’s okay if your blog name feels “too straightforward.” Straightforward names accurately communicate what you’re about and effectively attract the right audience.\n\nIf you still need more assistance, try using a blog name generator. One last tip: Make sure the name you come up with isn’t already taken, as it could lessen your visibility and confuse readers looking for your content.\n\n6. Create your blog domain.\n\nA domain is a part of the web address nomenclature someone would use to find your website or a page of your website online.\n\nYour blog‘s domain will look like this: www.yourblog.com. The name between the two periods is up to you, as long as this domain name doesn’t yet exist on the internet.\n\nWant to create a subdomain for your blog? If you already own a cooking business at www.yourcompany.com, you might create a blog that looks like this: blog.yourcompany.com. In other words, your blog's subdomain will live in its own section of yourcompany.com.\n\nSome CMS platforms offer subdomains as a free service, where your blog lives on the CMS, rather than your business's website. For example, it might look like this: yourblog.contentmanagementsystem.com. However, to create a subdomain that belongs to your company website, register the subdomain with a website host.\n\nMost website hosting services charge very little to host an original domain — in fact, website costs can be as inexpensive as $3 per month when you commit to a 36-month term.\n\nPro Tip: You can connect your custom domain to free hosting with HubSpot’s free CMS or in premium editions of Content Hub. This includes access to built-in security features and a content delivery network.\n\nHere are five other popular web hosting services to choose from:\n\nGoDaddy\n\nHostGator\n\nDreamHost\n\nBluehost\n\niPage\n\n7. Choose a CMS and set up your blog.\n\nA CMS (content management system) is a software application that allows users to build and maintain a website without having to code it from scratch. CMS platforms can manage domains (where you create your website) and subdomains (where you create a webpage that connects to an existing website).\n\nHubSpot customers host web content via Content Hub. Another popular option is a self-hosted WordPress website on a hosting site such as WP Engine. Whether you create a domain or a subdomain to start your blog, you'll need to choose a web hosting service after you pick a CMS.\n\nPro Tip: You can get started for free with HubSpot’s free blog maker. Our free CMS offers everything you need to get started– including hosting, a visual editor, and hundreds of free and paid themes to choose from.\n\nStart using HubSpot's Free Blog Making tool to publish blog posts.\n\n8. Customize the look of your blog.\n\nOnce you have your domain name set up, customize the appearance of your blog to reflect the theme of the content you plan on creating and your brand.\n\nFor example, if you're writing about sustainability and the environment, green might be a color to keep in mind while designing your blog.\n\nImage Source\n\nIf you already manage a website and are writing the first post for that existing website, ensure the article is consistent with the website in appearance and subject matter. Two ways to do this are including your:\n\nLogo: This can be your business‘s name and logo — it will remind blog readers of who’s publishing the content. (How heavily you want to brand your blog, however, is up to you.)\n\n“About” Page: You might already have an “About” blurb describing yourself or your business. Your blog‘s \"About\" section is an extension of this higher-level statement. Think of it as your blog’s mission statement, which serves to support your company's goals.\n\n9. Write your first blog post.\n\nOnce you have your blog set up, the only thing missing is the content. While the design and layout are fun and functionally necessary, it's the content that will draw your readers in and keep them coming back. So how do you actually go about writing one of these engaging and informational pieces?\n\nWriting Your First Blog Post\n\nYou’ve got the technical and practical tidbits down — now it’s time to write your very first blog post. And nope, this isn’t the space to introduce yourself and your new blog (i.e. “Welcome to my blog! This is the topic I’ll be covering. Here are my social media handles. Will you please follow?”).\n\nStart with “low-hanging fruit,” writing about a highly specific topic that serves a small segment of your target audience.\n\nThat seems unintuitive, right? If more people are searching for a term or a topic, that should mean more readers for you.\n\nBut that’s not true. If you choose a general and highly searched topic that’s been covered by major competitors or more established brands, it’s unlikely that your post will rank on the first page of search engine results pages (SERPs). Give your newly born blog a chance by choosing a topic that few bloggers have written about.\n\nIf you need help, you can also use AI to help you create a blog post quickly.\n\n1. Choose a topic you’re passionate and knowledgeable about.\n\nBefore you write anything, pick a topic for your blog post. The topic can be pretty general to start. For example, if you're a company that sells a CRM for small-to-enterprise businesses, your post might be about the importance of using a single software to keep your marketing, sales, and service teams aligned.\n\nPro tip: You may not want to jump into a “how-to” article for your first blog post.\n\nWhy?\n\nYour credibility hasn’t been established yet. Before teaching others how to do something, you’ll first want to show that you’re a leader in your field and an authoritative source.\n\nFor instance, if you‘re a plumber writing your first post, you won’t yet write a post titled “How to Replace the Piping System in your Bathroom.” First, you’d write about modern faucet setups, or tell a particular success story you had rescuing a faucet before it flooded a customer's house.\n\nHere are four other types of blog posts you could start with:\n\nList (“Listicle”): 5 ways to fix a leaky faucet\n\nCurated Collection: 10 faucet and sink brands to consider today\n\nSlideShare Presentation: 5 types of faucets to replace your old one (with pictures)\n\nNews Piece: New study shows X% of people don't replace their faucet frequently enough\n\nIf you're having trouble coming up with topic ideas, a good topic brainstorming session should help. In the post I’ve linked, my colleague walks you through a helpful process for turning one idea into many. Similar to the “leaky faucet” examples above, you would “iterate off old topics to come up with unique and compelling new topics.”\n\nThis can be done by:\n\nChanging the topic scope\n\nAdjusting your time frame\n\nChoosing a new audience\n\nTaking a positive/negative approach\n\nIntroducing a new format\n\nAnd if you’re still stuck, let’s take a look at some first blog post idea examples.\n\nFirst Blog Post Ideas\n\nThe Difference Between [Niche Topic] and [Niche Topic], Explained by a [Niche Expert]\n\nThe Difference Between SEM and SEO, Explained by a Marketing Expert\n\nThe Difference Between Sedans and Coupes, Explained by a Car Mechanic\n\nThe Difference Between Baking and Broiling, Explained by a Professional Baker\n\nThe 10 Best and Worst [Niche Tools] for [Niche Activity]\n\nThe 10 Best and Worst Writing Software for Fiction Writing\n\nThe 10 Best and Worst CRMs for Nurturing Prospects\n\nThe 10 Best and Worst Family Cars for Cross-Country Roadtrips\n\n8 [Niche Activity] Common Mistakes (+ Ways to Fix Them)\n\n8 Non-Fiction Writing Common Mistakes (+ Ways to Fix Them)\n\n8 Salmon Broiling Common Mistakes (+ Ways to Fix Them)\n\n8 Car Maintenance Common Mistakes (+ Ways to Fix Them)\n\n9 Proven Tips for [Niche Activity]\n\n9 Proven Tips for Checking Plumbing Problems under Your Kitchen Sink\n\n9 Proven Tips for Writing a Non-Fiction Bestseller\n\n9 Proven Tips for Doing DIY Car Maintenance\n\nWhy We/I Switched from [Niche Tool] to [Niche Tool] (Comparison)\n\nWhy We Switched from Pipedrive to HubSpot (Comparison)\n\nWhy I Switched from Microsoft Word to Scrivener (Comparison)\n\nWhy We Switched from iMacs to Surface Studio (Comparison)\n\n[Niche Tool] vs [Niche Tool]: Which [Tool] is Best for You?\n\nZendesk vs Freshcaller: Which Call Software is Best for You?\n\nAir Fryer vs Convection Oven: Which One is Best for You?\n\nMazda Miata vs Toyota Supra: Which Sports Car is Best for You?\n\nThe Ultimate Roundup of [Niche Activity] Tips and Tricks\n\nThe Ultimate Roundup of Novel Writing Tips and Tricks\n\nThe Ultimate Roundup of Macaroon Baking Tips and Tricks\n\nThe Ultimate Roundup of Solo Traveling Tips and Tricks\n\nWant some real examples of blog posts? See what your first blog post can look like based on the topic you choose and the audience you're targeting.\n\n2. Target a low-volume keyword to optimize around.\n\nFinding a keyword with low searches in Google (I recommend sticking to about 10 to 150 monthly searches). These topics offer less competition and should therefore allow your new blog post to rank more easily.\n\nTo choose a topic, you can either do a traditional brainstorming session or carry out keyword research. I suggest the latter because you can actually see how many people are looking for that topic.\n\nNow, don’t be intimidated by the term “keyword research.” It’s not just for marketers, but for new bloggers, too. And it’s really easy to do.\n\nTo jumpstart your keyword research, first begin by identifying the general topic of your blog.\n\nSay you’re a plumber. Your general, high-level topic might be “plumbing” (67K monthly searches).\n\nNext, put this term into a keyword research tool such as:\n\nAhrefs\n\nMoz\n\nUbersuggest\n\nWordtracker\n\nWhen you run this term through the tool, a list of related keywords will appear. Scan the list and choose one with a lower search volume. For this example, we’ll use “under sink plumbing” (1.4K monthly searches).\n\nRun that keyword in the keyword research tool again. Look at the related keywords. Find one with a lower search volume. Do that again.\n\nFor this example, we’ll settle on “plumbing problems under kitchen sink” (10 monthly searches). That’s the topic for our first post.\n\nTLDR; Choose a low-volume, low-competition keyword that will ensure your first post ranks.\n\nFor more help on keyword research, here are more resources you can use:\n\nHow to Do Keyword Research for SEO: A Beginner's Guide\n\nHow to Perform Keyword Research and Rank\n\nTop Tools For Finding Long-Tail Keywords\n\n3. Google the term to understand your audience’s search intent.\n\nYou’ve got your topic — now, you need to check that the user’s search intent would be fulfilled by a blog post.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nIf someone is looking for “plumbing problems under a kitchen sink,” they might be looking for a tutorial, a diagram, an article, or a product that can fix the issue. If they’re looking for the first three, you’re good — that can be covered in a blog post. A product, however, is different, and your blog post won’t rank.\n\nHow do you double-check search intent?\n\nGoogle the term and look at the results. If other articles and blog posts rank for that term, you’re good to go. If you only find product pages or listicles from major publications, then find a new topic to cover in your first post.\n\nConsider the term “under sink plumbing bathroom” (30 monthly searches). It seemed like a perfect fit because it had low monthly searches.\n\nUpon Googling the term, I found product carousels, product pages from Home Depot and Lowes, and guides written by major publications. (You’ll also want to avoid topics that have been covered by major publications, at least for now.)\n\nTLDR; Before writing your first blog post about a low-volume topic, double-check the user intent by Googling the keyword. Also, don’t forget to take a look at who’s written about that topic so far. If you see a major brand, consider writing about another topic.\n\n4. Find questions and terms related to that topic.\n\nYou’ve got a highly unique topic that’s been covered by just a few people so far. It’s time to flesh it out by covering related or adjacent topics.\n\nUse the following tools:\n\nAnswer the Public: When you place your keyword into this tool, it will give you a list of questions related to that term.\n\nGoogle: Google is your best friend. Search for the term and look under “People also ask” and “People also search for.” Be sure to touch upon those topics in the post.\n\nYou can also use these keyword research tools we mentioned above in step one.\n\n5. Come up with a working title.\n\nYou might come up with a few different working titles — in other words, iterations of approaching that topic to help you focus your writing.\n\nFor example, you may decide to narrow your topic to “Tools for Fixing Leaky Faucets” or “Common Causes of Leaky Faucets.” A working title is specific and will guide your post so you can start writing.\n\nLet's take a real post as an example: \"How to Choose a Solid Topic for Your Next Blog Post.\"\n\nAppropriate, right? The topic, in this case, was probably “blogging.” Then the working title may have been something like, “The Process for Selecting a Blog Post Topic.” And the final title ended up being “How to Choose a Solid Topic for Your Next Blog Post.”\n\nSee that evolution from topic, to working title, to final title? Even though the working title may not end up being the final title (more on that in a moment), it still provides enough information so you can focus your blog post on something more specific than a generic, overwhelming topic.\n\n6. Create an outline.\n\nSometimes, blog posts can have an overwhelming amount of information — for the reader and the writer. The trick is to organize the info in a way so readers aren‘t intimidated by length or amount of content. This organization can take multiple forms — sections, lists, tips — whatever’s most appropriate. But it must be organized!\n\nFeatured Resource: 6 Free Blog Post Templates\n\nDownload These Templates for Free\n\nLet's take a look at the post, \"How to Use Snapchat: A Detailed Look Into HubSpot’s Snapchat Strategy.\" There‘s a lot of content in the piece, so it’s broken up into a few sections using descriptive headers. The major sections are separated into subsections that go into more detail, making the content easier to read.\n\nTo complete this step, all you really need to do is outline your post. This way, before you start writing, you'll know which points you want to cover and the best order to do so. And to make things even easier, you can download and use our free blog post templates, which are pre-organized for six of the most common blogs. Just fill in the blanks!\n\n7. Write an intro (and make it captivating).\n\nWe've written more specifically about writing captivating introductions in the post \"How to Write an Introduction,\" but let's review, shall we?\n\nFirst, grab the reader‘s attention. If you lose the reader in the first few paragraphs — or even sentences — of the introduction, they’ll stop reading (even before they've given your post a fair shake). You can do this in a number of ways: tell a story or a joke, be empathetic, or grip the reader with an interesting fact or statistic.\n\nThen, describe the purpose of your post and explain how it will address a problem the reader may be experiencing. This will give the reader a reason to continue reading and show them how the post will help them improve their work or lives.\n\nHere‘s an example of an intro I think does a good job of attracting a reader’s attention right away:\n\n“Blink. Blink. Blink. It's the dreaded cursor-on-a-blank-screen experience that all writers — amateur or professional, aspiring or experienced — know and dread. And of all times for it to occur, it seems to plague us the most when trying to write an introduction.”\n\n8. Build out each section of your outline.\n\nThe next step — but not the last — is actually writing the content. We can't forget about that, of course.\n\nNow that you have your outline or template, you're ready to fill in the blanks. Use your outline as a guide and expand on all points as needed. Write about what you already know, and if necessary, conduct additional research to gather more information, examples, and data to back up your points, while providing proper attribution when incorporating external sources. When you do, always try to find accurate and compelling data to use in your post.\n\nIf you‘re having trouble stringing sentences together, you’re not alone. Finding your “flow” can be challenging for a lot of folks. Luckily, there are a ton of tools you can lean on to help you improve your writing. Here are a few to get you started:\n\nHubSpot's AI Blog Writer: Tools like HubSpot's AI Blog Writer can be a valuable asset for beginners and seasoned bloggers alike. It simplifies the process of creating SEO-friendly and engaging blog content, which is crucial for connecting with your audience and enjoying the benefits of blogging.\n\nPower Thesaurus: Stuck on a word?

Publish and promote your first post any way you can.\n\nAs a new blogger, you likely don’t have a social media following yet. Thankfully, you don’t need a huge following before you can create a promotion strategy.\n\nA promotion strategy is your master plan for how you create, post, and engage with your social media content. One quick but effective way to build up your online presence is by simply repurposing your blog posts.\n\nYou can turn a blog post into bite-sized snippets of engaging information to share on socials, or into an audio file perfect for audio streaming services. HubSpot’s content marketing tools let you do just that, as well as handle SEO and even record videos and podcasts.\n\nIt helps you take advantage of social and digital technologies to share your business, or in this case, your content. Having a solid promotional strategy offers your audience from different marketing channels more ways to find your blog posts.\n\nHere are more blog post promotion resources:\n\n12 Tried-and-True Ways to Promote Your Blog Posts\n\n10 Sites You Can Use for Free Blog Promotion\n\n9 Link Building Email Outreach Templates That Actually Work\n\nInbound Link Building 101: 34 Ways to Build Backlinks for SEO\n\n11 Creative (But 100% White Hat!) Ways to Earn Backlinks\n\n10. Track content performance to optimize future posts.\n\nKeyword research, informative content, and having a promotion strategy in place won’t get you anywhere if you don’t know whether you’re doing it right. Analytics should play a key role in your overall content strategy.\n\nFor example, you can track a page’s total views and average session duration with HubSpot’s marketing analytics software to gauge whether your target audience found the blog post engaging or informative while monitoring your traffic sources helps pinpoint the marketing channels that might be worth doubling down on.\n\nYou can also identify your top-performing posts to see which topics yield the best results in terms of views conversions, for example.\n\nWhat makes a good blog post?\n\nBefore you write a blog, make sure you know the answers to questions like, “Why would someone keep reading this entire blog post?” and “What makes our audience come back for more?”\n\nTo start, a good blog post is interesting and educational. Blogs should answer questions and help readers resolve a challenge they're experiencing — and you have to do so in an interesting way.\n\nIt‘s not enough just to answer someone’s questions — you also have to provide actionable steps while being engaging. For instance, your introduction should hook the reader and make them want to continue reading your post. Then, use examples to keep your readers interested in what you have to say.\n\nRemember, a good blog post is interesting to read and provides educational content to audience members.\n\nWant to learn how to apply blogging and other forms of content marketing to your business?\n\nCheck out HubSpot Academy's free content marketing course.\n\nNow, let's dive into some formatting guidelines to use before you publish your blog posts.\n\n1. Include H2s to arrange ideas.\n\nWhen you begin typing your blog content, it’s important that you divide paragraphs into sections that make it easier for the reader to find what they need.\n\nIf you’re just starting out, then focus on the overarching H2s you want to talk about, and you’ll be able to branch off into subheaders and more naturally as you continue.\n\n2. Center your images.\n\nThis is a simple practice that can help your content look more professional with little effort. Centering your images keeps the reader’s attention drawn to the subject — not searching for elsewhere.\n\nCentering also looks better when translating from PC to mobile devices. As formatting transitions to small screens or windows, a centered image will remain the focal point.\n\n3. Add alt text.\n\nSo those images you centered earlier, make sure you have descriptive alt text for them, too.\n\nImage alt text allows search engines, like Google, to crawl and rank your blog post better than pages lacking the element. It also leads readers to your blog post if the keywords included are what they searched for in the first place.\n\nBesides SERP features, image alt text is beneficial to readers by providing more accessibility. Image alt text allows people to better visualize images when they can’t see them, and with assistive technology, can be auditorily read aloud for people to enjoy.\n\n4. Keep your sentences short and concise.\n\nWhen you begin working on the body of your blog post, make sure readers can clearly understand what you’re trying to accomplish.\n\nYou shouldn’t feel pressure to elongate your post with unnecessary details, and chances are that if you keep it concise, readers will derive more value from your work.\n\n5. Use media with a purpose.\n\nBreak up the monotony of your blog post with some multimedia content where seen fit.\n\nYour reader will enjoy visiting a blog page with images, videos, polls, audio or slideshows as opposed to a page of black and white text.\n\nIt also makes it more interactive and improves your on-page search engine optimization (SEO).\n\nNow, do you want some real examples of blog posts? See what your first blog post can look like based on the topic you choose and the audience you're targeting.\n\n1. List-Based Blog Post\n\nList-Based Post Example: 17 Blogging Mistakes to Avoid in 2021, According to HubSpot Bloggers\n\nList-based posts are sometimes called “listicles,” a mix of the words “list” and “article.” These are articles that deliver information in the form of a list. A listicle uses sub-headers to break down the blog post into individual pieces, helping readers skim and digest your content more easily.\n\nAs you can see in the example from our blog, listicles can offer various tips and methods for solving a problem.\n\n2. Thought Leadership Post\n\nExample: How HubSpot's Customers Are Shaping the Next Normal\n\nThought leadership posts allow you to share your expertise on a particular subject matter and share firsthand knowledge with your readers.\n\nThese pieces — which can be written in the first person, like the post shown above — help you build trust with your audience so people take your blog seriously as you continue to write for it.\n\n3. Curated Collection Post\n\nExample: 8 Examples of Evolution in Action\n\nCurated collections are a special type of listicle blog post. Rather than sharing tips or methods for doing something, this type of blog post shares a list of real examples that all have something in common in order to prove a larger point.\n\nIn the example post above, Listverse shares eight real examples of evolution in action among eight different animals — starting with the peppered moth.\n\n4. Slide Presentation\n\nExample: The HubSpot Culture Code\n\nHubSpot Slides is a presentation tool that helps publishers package a lot of information into easily shareable slides. Think of it like a PowerPoint, but for the web. With this in mind, SlideShare blog posts help you promote your SlideShare so that it can generate a steady stream of visitors.\n\nUnlike blogs, slide decks don't often rank well on search engines, so they need a platform for getting their message out there to the people who are looking for it. By embedding and summarizing your SlideShare on a blog post, you can share a great deal of information and give it a chance to rank on Google at the same time.\n\nNeed some slideshow ideas? In the example above, we turned our company's “Culture Code” into a slides presentation that anyone can look through and take lessons from, and then promoted it in a blog post.\n\n5. Newsjacking Post\n\nExample: Ivy Goes Mobile With New App for Designers\n\n“Newsjacking” is a nickname for “hijacking” your blog to break important news related to your industry. Therefore, the newsjack post is a type of article whose sole purpose is to garner consumers' attention and, while offering them timeless professional advice, prove your blog is a trusted resource for learning about the big things that happen in your industry.\n\nThe newsjack example above was published by Houzz, a home decor merchant and interior design resource, about a new mobile app that was launched just for interior designers. Houzz didn‘t launch the app, but the news of its launching is no less important to Houzz’s audience.\n\n6. Infographic Post\n\nExample: The Key Benefits of Studying Online [Infographic]\n\nThe infographic post serves a similar purpose as the SlideShare post — the fourth example, explained above — in that it conveys information for which plain blog copy might not be the best format.\n\nFor example, when you're looking to share a lot of statistical information (without boring or confusing your readers), building this data into a well-designed, even engaging infographic can keep your readers engaged with your content. It also helps readers remember the information long after they leave your website.\n\n7. How-to Post\n\nExample: How to Write a Blog Post: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nFor this example, you need not look any further than the blog post you‘re reading right now! How-to guides like this one help solve a problem for your readers. They’re like a cookbook for your industry, walking your audience through a project step by step to improve their literacy on the subject.\n\nThe more posts like this you create, the more equipped your readers will be to work with you and invest in the services you offer.\n\n8. Guest Post\n\nExample: Your Bookmarkable Guide to Social Media Image Sizes in 2021 [Infographic]\n\nGuest posts are a type of blog post that you can use to include other voices on your blog. For example, if you want to get an outside expert's opinion on a topic, a guest post is perfect for that.\n\nAdditionally, these posts give your blog variety in topic and viewpoint. If your customer has a problem you can't solve, a guest post is a great solution.\n\nIf you begin accepting guest posts, set up editorial guidelines to ensure they're up to the same standards as your posts.\n\nSo we’ve gone through the different types of blog posts you can make, but how do you consistently make quality blog posts that your viewers will enjoy?\n\n1. Draw from your buyer personas and what you know about your audience.\n\nBefore you start writing your blog post, make sure you have a clear understanding of your target audience.\n\nAsk questions like: What do they want to know about? What will resonate with them?\n\nThis is where the process of creating buyer personas comes in handy. Consider what you know about your buyer personas and their interests while you're coming up with a topic for your blog post.\n\nFor instance, if your readers are millennials looking to start a business, you probably don't need to provide them with information about getting started in social media — most of them already have that down.\n\nYou might, however, want to give them information about how to adjust their social media approach (for example — from what may be a casual, personal approach to a more business-savvy, networking-focused approach). That kind of tweak is what helps you publish content about the topics your audience really wants and needs.\n\nIf you haven’t developed buyer personas yet, I’ve found that it’s easiest to get started by gathering the information you already have about your audience and looking for trends. Sending out feedback surveys and interviewing followers can also be helpful.\n\nDoes your blog attract a specific age group? Does your audience live in a certain region? How do readers typically discover your content? Finding answers to these questions can help you get a better idea of who your buyer persona is.\n\nDon't have buyer personas in place for your business? Here are a few resources to help you get started:\n\nCreate Buyer Personas for Your Business [Free Template]\n\nGuide: How to Create Detailed Buyer Personas for Your Business\n\n[Free Tool] Make My Persona: Buyer Persona Generator\n\n2. Pull from your content strategy and/or brainstormed topics.\n\nIf you already have a pre-existing portfolio to look back on, it would benefit you to pull from those brainstormed post ideas or previous content strategy.\n\nOne thing that’s been helpful for me is specifically looking at content performance data when brainstorming ideas. In doing this, I’ve discovered which topics tend to resonate with my audience (and which ones don’t) and created content around them.\n\nBy focusing on your core blog topics, or clusters, you can establish yourself as a thought leader, gain the trust of your audience, rank better on search engines, and attract new readers.\n\n3. Identify what’s missing from the existing discourse.\n\nFill in the gaps of the existing discourse in the topic of your choosing.\n\nYou want to meet a need that hasn’t already been met in your topic cluster. Otherwise, you run the risk of writing content for topics that are already over-saturated.\n\nIt’s hard to beat saturated search queries when you’re trying to rank against high authority publications — but not impossible if your content is answering the queries the competition hasn’t.\n\nTo discover what’s missing within a topic, I conduct a competitive analysis to see what my competitors offer in their content and how I can make my blog post better. Here are some things to look out for:\n\nUnanswered user queries\n\nContent depth\n\nContent freshness\n\nMedia richness\n\nUser experience\n\nIf your competitors are lacking in any of these areas, you can use that to your advantage and focus on them when writing your blog post.\n\nAnother way to differentiate your blog is by offering original data, quotes, or perspectives. Some of my best performing posts have come from getting a unique quote from an industry expert.\n\n4. Choose what type of blog post you’re writing.\n\nThere are several types of blog posts you can create, and they each have different formats to follow.\n\nSix of the most common formats include:\n\nThe List-Based Post\n\nThe “What Is” Post\n\nThe Pillar Page Post (“Ultimate Guide”)\n\nThe Newsjacking Post\n\nThe Infographic Post\n\nThe “How-To” Post\n\nSave time and download six blog post templates for free.\n\n5. Generate a few different titles and choose the best one.\n\nYour blog title should tell readers what to expect, yet it should leave them wanting to know more — confusing, right?\n\nThis is why when you’re coming up with a blog post title that you should brainstorm multiple ones instead of just one. I find it helpful to share these titles with a couple coworkers to get their feedback and see which one is most engaging to them.\n\nI’ve also enlisted the help of ChatGPT to generate sample blog post titles by inputting a prompt like, “Write a list of blog titles about [topic].” Even if it doesn’t give you exactly what you want, it can still get ideas flowing.\n\n6. Create your outline and designate keyword-rich H2s and H3s.\n\nWhen outlining, you need to center your main ideas with keyword-rich H2s and H3s. These are going to be your headers and subheaders that readers typically search for, and the information that Google crawls when indexing and ranking content.\n\nI use keyword research tools, like Ahrefs and Semrush, to find the best words for my blog post. To find the right keywords, I focus on the following elements:\n\nRelevance to topic and search intent\n\nHow authoritative my blog is on the topic\n\nThe amount of search traffic my blog could gain\n\nRemember, your outline should serve as a guide to make writing your blog post easier, so make sure you include all the important points you want to discuss and organize them in a logical flow.\n\n7. Write your blog post!\n\nI already told you how to build out your outline earlier in the post, so we'll quickly go over the main points once more.\n\nYou‘ve already outlined your main headings and subheadings, so now’s the time to add the body.\n\nWrite about what you already know, and if necessary, conduct additional research to gather more information, examples, and data to back up your points, while providing proper attribution when incorporating external sources. When you do, always try to find accurate and compelling data to use in your post.\n\nThis is also your opportunity to show personality in your writing. Blog posts don‘t have to be strictly informational, they can be filled with interesting anecdotes and even humor if it serves a purpose in expressing your ideas. It also factors into creating and maintaining your blog’s brand voice.\n\nDon‘t be discouraged if you’re having trouble stringing sentences together, you're not alone. Finding your “flow” can be challenging, but there are many tools to ease the process. Software such as HubSpot's Free AI Blog Writer can help you generate copy for your blog post. You can even use it to outline and generate title ideas.\n\n8. Proofread your post.\n\nThe editing process is an important part of blogging — don't overlook it. I tend to self-edit while I write, but it’s essential to get a second pair of eyes on your post before publishing.\n\nConsider enlisting the help of The Ultimate Editing Checklist and ask a grammar-conscious co-worker to copy edit and proofread your post. I also really enjoy free grammar checkers, like Grammarly, to help proofread while I’m writing.\n\nIf you're looking to brush up on your self-editing skills, turn to these helpful posts for some tips and tricks to get you started:\n\nHow to Become a (Better) Editor: 13 Editorial Tips\n\nHow to Become a More Efficient Editor: 12 Ways to Speed Up the Editorial Process\n\n10 Simple Edits That'll Instantly Improve Any Piece of Writing\n\n9. Add images and other media elements to support your ideas.\n\nWhen you're finished checking for grammar, shift your focus to adding other elements to the blog post than text. There’s much more to making a good blog post than copy, here’s some following elements to add in support of your ideas:\n\nFeatured Image\n\nChoose a visually appealing and relevant image for your post. As social networks treat content with images more prominently, visuals are more responsible than ever for the success of your blog content.\n\nFor help selecting an image for your post, read \"How to Select the Perfect Image for Your Next Blog Post\" and pay close attention to the section about copyright law.\n\nVisual Appearance\n\nNo one likes an unattractive blog post. And it‘s not just pictures that make a post visually appealing — it’s the formatting and organization of the post, too.\n\nIn a well-formatted and visually-appealing blog post, you'll notice that header and sub-headers are used to break up large blocks of text — and those headers are styled consistently.\n\nHere's an example of what that looks like:\n\nScreenshots should always have a similar, defined border so they don‘t appear as if they’re floating in space — that style should stay consistent from post to post.\n\nMaintaining this consistency makes your content look more professional and easier on the eyes.\n\nTopics and Tags\n\nTags are specific, public-facing keywords that describe a post. They also allow readers to browse for more content in the same category on your blog. Refrain from adding a laundry list of tags to each post. Instead, put some thought into a blog tagging strategy.\n\nThink of tags as “topics” or “categories,” and choose 10-20 tags that represent all the main topics you want to cover on your blog. Then stick to those.\n\n10. Upload your post into your CMS.\n\nYou filled out your blog post with all the optimized content you can, now is the time to publish it in your content management system.\n\nI also use this step as an opportunity to double check my post for any errors that were potentially missed during the proofreading process. It’s especially important to preview your post before publishing to make sure there aren’t any formatting issues.\n\nYou can opt to post your content immediately, save it as a draft, or schedule when you want it to be posted live in case you adhere to a posting schedule.\n\n11. Determine a conversion path (what you want your audience to do next).\n\nA conversion path is a process by which an anonymous website visitor becomes a known lead. It sounds simple enough, but creating an effective conversion path requires a clear understanding of your target audience and their needs.\n\nHaving a conversion path is important because when you share your content on the web, you should have an idea of what your audience should do next, or in other words, provide them with a path forward.\n\nThe HubSpot Flywheel model is a great example of this as it shows how our organization gains and maintains leads.\n\n12. Add calls to action to guide your audience to take action.\n\nCall to action (CTA) are a part of a webpage, advertisement, or piece of content that encourages the audience to do something. You can add them to your blog post to guide your reader with “next steps” or a conversion path.\n\nDifferent types of call to actions include asking readers to:\n\nSubscribe to your newsletter to see when you publish more content.\n\nJoin an online community in your blog domain.\n\nLearn more about a topic with downloadable content.\n\nTry something for free or discount to convert readers to customers.\n\nTo get a better idea of how to make a CTA that readers want to click, we have a whole list of effective call to action examples for you to check out.\n\n13. Link to other relevant blog posts within your content.\n\nWhen you’re completing your blog post, you should link relevant content throughout it. An effective way to do this is to link within the same content cluster.\n\nOne thing I do to make finding relevant links easier is going to my search browser and typing “site:website.com: keyword.” By doing this, you can find all the posts you have published on that topic.\n\nKeeping relevant content throughout your post can provide your readers with more helpful information, and potentially boost search engine rankings with corresponding longtail keywords.\n\nBut we’ll talk more about how to improve your ranking in the next step.\n\n14. Optimize for on-page SEO.\n\nAfter you finish writing, go back and optimize the on-page elements of your post.\n\nDon‘t obsess over how many keywords to include. If there are opportunities to incorporate keywords you’re targeting, and it won‘t impact reader experience, do it. If you can make your URL shorter and more keyword-friendly, go for it. But don’t cram keywords or shoot for some arbitrary keyword density — Google's smarter than that!\n\nHere's a little blog SEO reminder about what you should review and optimize:\n\nWrite your meta description.\n\nMeta descriptions are the descriptions below the post‘s page title on Google’s search results pages. They provide searchers with a short summary of the post before clicking into it. They are ideally between 150-160 characters and start with a verb, such as “Learn,” “Read,” or “Discover.”\n\nWhile meta descriptions no longer factor into Google‘s keyword ranking algorithm, they give searchers a snapshot of what they’ll get from reading the post and help improve your clickthrough rate from search.\n\nOptimize your page title and headers.\n\nMost blogging software uses your post title as your page title, which is the most important on-page SEO element at your disposal. But if you've followed our formula so far, you should already have a working title that will naturally include keywords or phrases your target audience is interested in.\n\nDon‘t over-complicate your title by trying to fit in keywords where they don’t naturally belong. With that said, if there are clear opportunities to add keywords you‘re targeting to your post title and headers, feel free to take them. Also, try to keep your headlines short — ideally, under 65 characters — so they don’t get truncated in the search engine results.\n\n\"The first component of a good title is that it needs to be scannable. People aren’t reading every word of your thoughtfully crafted headline. If you’re following a search-focused strategy, make sure to include the keyword at the beginning,\" Del Principe says.\n\nConsider anchor text best practices as you interlink to other pages.\n\nAnchor text is the word or words that link to another page — either on your website or on another website. Carefully select which keywords you want to link to other pages on your site because search engines take that into consideration when ranking your page for certain keywords.\n\nIt‘s also important to consider which pages you link to. Consider linking pages that you want to rank for a specific keyword. You could end up getting it to rank on Google’s first page of results instead of its second page — and that isn’t small potatoes!\n\nWrite alt text for all of your images.\n\nAlt text conveys the “why” of an image as it relates to the content of your blog post to Google. By adding alt text correlating to the topic clusters and keywords of the post, Google can better direct users’ searches to you.\n\nCheck that all images are compressed for page speed.\n\nWhen Google crawls different websites, a page’s load speed holds weight in page ranking. Make sure the images you include throughout the page aren’t unnecessarily large to shorten the duration it takes to load.\n\nUse apps like Squoosh to minimize the size of your images without losing the quality.\n\nEnsure that your blog post is mobile friendly.\n\nMore than 60% of organic visits are carried out on a mobile device. As such, having a website with a responsive design is critical. In addition to making sure your website‘s visitors (including your blog’s visitors) have the best experience possible, optimizing for mobile will score your website some SEO points.\n\n15. Publish and promote the blog post.\n\nShare your post across all the marketing channels in your repertoire. The further the reach, the more of a possibility that readers will find it.\n\nChannels to expand your blog post promotion strategy include:\n\nSocial Media Marketing: Sharing your content on the most popular social media networks like Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, etc.\n\nEmail Marketing: Sharing the newest post with your email subscribers to find.\n\nBoosted Posts or Paid Ads: Allocating budget toward advertisement on search engines inorganically.\n\nWord of Mouth Marketing: Actively influencing people to read your content organically.\n\n16. Track the performance of the blog post over time.\n\nYour post is published for the world to see, make sure you’re keeping an eye on its performance over time so you can see if your blog post strategy is working well enough for your goals.\n\nHere are some blog KPIs I like to keep track of:\n\nTotal traffic per post\n\nAverage CTR\n\nAverage SERP position\n\nTraffic source breakdown\n\nNumber of search queries per post\n\nAverage comments per post\n\nSocial shares per post\n\nNew blog leads\n\nConversion rate\n\nThere’s a plethora of website traffic analysis tools that you can take advantage of to better understand your audience’s behavior on your blog posts.\n\nQuick Blog Writing Tips\n\nIf you’re feeling stuck as a new writer, don’t give up. It gets easier with practice. Whether you’re struggling with writer's block or wanting some ways to add depth to your content, here are some quick tips I compiled to help take your blog writing to the next level:\n\nIf you don’t know where to start, start by telling a story.\n\nWhen you’re facing writer’s block, start with what you know. Not only will sharing personal anecdotes help you get ideas flowing, but it can also keep your readers engaged with what you’re saying.\n\nStories can simplify complex concepts and make your content more relatable. Plus, they add a human touch and help set the tone for the rest of your blog post.\n\nInclude interesting quotes or facts for emphasis on the subject.\n\nWhen you back up your ideas with unique, expert quotes or share facts from reliable sources, it shows that your blog post is well-researched and trustworthy.\n\nIf you don’t know where to start with finding quotes, think about the people you know and their expertise. For example, I’m lucky enough to have incredibly knowledgeable coworkers here at HubSpot that I can reach out to if I need a quote.\n\nI’ve also reached out to connections on LinkedIn to see if they can provide a quote or know someone who can. HARO can also be a great resource if you need a quote in a pinch.\n\nMake your content skimmable; break it into digestible chunks.\n\nThere’s nothing that turns readers off more than opening an article and seeing a large wall of text. Think about it: most internet users have a short attention span and tend to skim through content rather than reading every word.\n\nThat’s why I recommend breaking up your blog post into smaller chunks to make it more digestible. You can do this by utilizing subheadings (H2s, H3s, H4s, etc.), bullet points, and short paragraphs.\n\nNot only does breaking up your content make your blog post more visually appealing, it also helps readers quickly find the information they’re looking for without getting lost in a sea of text.\n\nPaint a full picture with images, graphics or video.\n\nAside from aesthetic appeal, visuals can help convey complex ideas in an easier way and help readers remember the information you share.\n\nI recommend reading through your blog post and putting yourself in your reader’s shoes. Is there anything you wrote about that would be better explained with the support of an image or graphic?\n\nFor instance, whenever I write about the pros and cons of something, I like to create a graphic that shows those pros and cons in a side-by-side comparison.\n\nI also look at search engines results when determining what images to add to my post. Does the SERP for the keyword you’re targeting have an image pack? See if you can add in images and optimize them with alt text to increase the chances of appearing in those results.\n\nEach sentence should convey a single idea.\n\nKeep it simple, stupid. There’s no reason to write overly complex sentences that confuse your readers. Instead, opt to convey your message in a simple and accessible manner. At the end of the day, readers just want to find the answers they’re looking for, and writing in a straightforward manner can effectively meet this need.\n\nI like to use the Hemingway App to make sure that my writing doesn’t get too dense.\n\nUse active voice.\n\nAlthough your writing should captivate the reader, you should avoid overwhelming them with fluff. Using active voice can help keep your writing clear, concise, and energetic while still getting your point across.\n\nFor example, instead of saying something like “the product was loved by customers,” write “customers loved the product.”\n\nReady to blog?\n\nBlogging can help you build brand awareness, become a thought-leader and expert in your industry, attract qualified leads, and boost conversions. Follow the steps and tips we covered above to begin publishing and enhancing your blog today.\n\nEditor's note: This post was originally published in October 2013 and has been updated for comprehensiveness."
