        "text": "General 4/27/2024 10:00:00 PM\n\nChicago State Women’s Tennis Advance to Horizon League Title Match Following 4-2 Victory Over Youngstown State\n\nBox Score The Chicago State women's tennis team advanced to the championship match of the 2024 Horizon League Women's Tennis Tournament with a 4-2 victory over Youngstown State Saturday afternoon at the Schwartz Tennis Center in West Lafayette, Indiana. The Cougars advance to Sunday's title match and will take on Cleveland State who beat Northern Kentucky 4-3 earlier in the day.\n\nThe Cougars and Vikings shared the Horizon League regular season title with Youngstown State. Cleveland State claimed the No. 1 seed due to tiebreakers between the three teams despite the Cougars 4-3 victory over the Vikings, Cleveland State's lone conference loss, during the regular season.\n\nThe Cougars opened the match claiming the doubles point with wins at No. 1 and 2 doubles. The duo of Manuella Eloundou and Nia Cooper, playing at the No. 1 position, won in a tiebreak after the Cougars and Vikings split the decisions in the first two matches off the court.\n\nIn singles, Chicago State increased the lead to 3-0 with wins at No. 6 (Helin Alvarez) and No. 4 (Amina Taibi) before Cleveland State earned their first win, at No. 3. At that point, the Cougars needed just one victory in the three matches still being contested and each of those three were pushed to a third and deciding set, leading 5-4 at No. 1, trailing 4-3 at No. 2 and tied 4-4 at No. 5.\n\n\"I'm not sure what to say about the fight these girls had tonight,\" head coach Jack Barton said. \"This was the grittiest performance of the year by these ladies. Although we lost to them in the regular season, we were very confident coming into this match. We kept our composure and we fought till the last ball was played. I am so happy for these ladies.\"\n\nYoungstown State secured the victory at No. 5 with a 6-4 third-set win to cut the margin to 3-2 when Manuella Eloundou moved ahead 6-5 at No. 1 and Katrina Dukic trailed 5-4 at No. 2. Eloundou secured a 7-5 victory leaving Dukic's match unfinished and with the Cougars moving into Sunday's championship match.\n\nCompete results listed below.\n\nChicago State vs Youngstown State\n\n4/27/2024 at West Lafayette, Indiana\n\n(Schwartz Tennis Center)\n\nChicago State 4, Youngstown State 2\n\nSingles competition\n\n1.
