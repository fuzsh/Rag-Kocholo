        "text": "A book isn’t a book without a title (even if it’s “Untitled”). And, a book’s title page is essential for a professional-looking work. Whether you’re publishing in ebook, print book, or both, it’s important to include a title page. But what is a title page? What purpose does it serve? And, what should be on it? Luckily, the answers to all these questions are pretty simple. So read on to find out all about a book title page.\n\nThis is a part of a series where I am analyzing all of the different parts of a book, and how to best craft them. If you'd like to learn more about the different parts of a book, be sure to check it out here.\n\nWhy Should You Trust Me?\n\nI've actually been writing and formatting books for a long time. Over 10 years so far, and counting.\n\nBut that's not the real reason, because there are plenty of authors who have lots of experience, but know next to nothing about the different parts of a book, or book formatting in general.\n\nThe real reason you should trust me is because I actually created my own formatting software that solved all my problems. I called it Atticus.\n\nBut this isn't meant to be a sales pitch. I just want to make sure it's clear that I know what I'm talking about. The amount of research that went into not only formatting my own books, but also creating a formatting software is huge.\n\nI researched everything, which led me to learn all about every. single. part. of. a. book. And there were a lot more than I realized.\n\nAnd of course, that includes the Title Page.\n\nSo if all that makes sense, hopefully you'll come along with me as show you everything I've learned.\n\nWhat is a Title Page in a Book?\n\nThe title page is one of the first pages in any book. It signals the beginning of the front matter and shares the title, subtitle, author, and publisher. Of course, not all books these days have a publisher. And many books don’t have a subtitle. In these cases, it just lists the title and the author or authors.\n\nYou may be wondering why books even have a title page. After all, doesn’t the book cover have the title on it? Why reiterate the name of the book?\n\nTitle pages are useful for referencing and cataloging. They help libraries and academic citations. And, believe it or not, many books have two title pages. One is simply called the “title page” and the other is called the “half title page.”\n\n[click_to_tweet tweet=”Although seemingly simple, the title page is often the first thing the reader sees.” quote=”Although seemingly simple, the title page is often the first thing the reader sees.” theme=””]\n\nHalf Title Page\n\nYou may be able to take a book off your bookshelf and open it up to see two different title pages. The first one, known as the half title, only has the name of the book and nothing else. The second one has the name of the book, the subtitle (if there is one), the name of the author(s), and the publishing company. Sometimes the publisher logo is located here, too.\n\nThe half title book page is from back when books had to be bound in a separate location than where they were printed. The half title book page served two purposes back then: to protect the actual title page in case something happened and the first page was ripped, and to tell the bookbinder the name of the book (presumably so they didn’t put the wrong cover on it).\n\nHaving two title pages is no longer the norm, but you can still find books with both.\n\nHaving trouble thinking of a book title? Check out this book title generator.\n\nWhat is the Page Behind the Title Page Called?\n\nThe page behind the title page is called the title verso. You may not be surprised to learn that verso is Latin for “reverse.” Sometimes this page is simply known as the “Copyright Page.” It contains important information such as the:\n\nCopyright notice\n\nISBN number\n\nDate of publication\n\nPublisher information\n\nDisclaimers\n\nCover or book design attribution\n\nFormatting attribution\n\nNot every book has an ISBN or a publisher, in which case these things are left off. The same can be said for cover design (if you designed it yourself) and formatting. However, it’s important to include the copyright information, date of publication, and any disclaimers you deem fit.\n\nIndustry Standards for Title Pages\n\nWhen developing your title page, it's important to know what is the industry standards for that title page. Otherwise you could get it wrong and you'd be left with a book that is unprofessional.\n\nWhile readers are unlikely to know these industry standards, they will understand them unconsciously, and it will make your book appear cheap and unorganized. So with that said, here are some best practices to include in your title page:\n\nThe title of your book\n\nThe subtitle of your book\n\nThe name of the author (or editors if this is an anthology)\n\nThe name of the illustrator, if applicable\n\nThe name and location of the publisher\n\nThe title's typeface should match or compliment the cover's typeface\n\nThe title page must be located on the right side (the left side is typically left blank)\n\nSo how do we actually include this title page in our book? Well there are a few ways to do this…\n\nHow Do You Format a Title Page for a Book?\n\nCreating the title page for your book depends on the software you are using. For this article, let's look at two different options:\n\nFormatting a Title Page in Microsoft Word\n\nFormatting a title page in Word is possible, but it's a slightly complicated process. Word is capable of formatting books, but it's also not what it was built for. See this post for more on formatting with Word. Here is an example of what a title page in Word might look like:\n\nWARNING: Before you use Word to format your book and title page, make sure you have the appropriate license for whatever font(s) you use in your book. Most fonts in Word are licensed for personal use only. If you want to create a product for publication (digitally or in print), you will need to buy an expensive license or find a different font. Thankfully, programs like Atticus only include fonts that you have 100% permission to use.\n\nTo create your title page in Word, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Click the “Insert” tab\n\nStep 2: Click the “Cover Page” button in the Pages group\n\nStep 3: Click on the cover page that you prefer. Make sure you have the space to include the industry standard fields above, and make provisions for the following:\n\nMake sure the style matches your book and genre\n\nEnsure you have the commercial license for any fonts used\n\nDon't pick something that is overly styled unless this is an intentional choice\n\nStep 4: Insert any needed images\n\nStep 5: Insert the appropriate text, especially the title, subtitle, author/editor, and publishing company\n\nStep 6: Ensure your trim size is properly adjusted\n\nStep 7: Make sure your margins are correct, especially the “gutter” margin which will need to be larger than the rest\n\nStep 8: Make sure the title page is displaying on the right side, and that the left page directly opposite the title page is blank\n\nStep 9: Convert to PDF to see how it looks (you can also upload to KDP without publishing to see if it passes their automated formatting inspection)\n\nYou may need to tweak this here and there, but ultimately you should be left with a passable title page. Now, if you want to save some time in this process and boil it all down to three simple steps, read on…\n\nFormatting a Title Page in Atticus\n\nBy far the easiest option is to use a program like Atticus, which provides a pre-made template and automatically generates the title page for your book. All you have to do is enter the information and you’re good to go!\n\nHere’s an example of the preview of a title page on Atticus.\n\nMade in Atticus.io\n\nAs you can see, the font size varies, separating each element from the other. This makes it look good and signals to the reader that some time and effort went into the book. It's a small thing, but it's important to get it right.\n\nSo whether the reader has a printed book in their hand, or they're reading an ebook, a good title page is important.\n\nKeep in mind that all title pages are on the right hand page when you open the book (something Atticus automatically adjusts for). This may not matter for ebooks, but it's best to make sure this is the case on your print book.\n\nAlso, remember that the title page has no page number.\n\nAre Title Pages Different for Fiction and Nonfiction Books?\n\nBoth fiction and nonfiction books generally stick with the same formatting styles. Academic or textbooks may have more information on the title page due to the number of authors involved in the work.\n\nTitle Page Examples\n\nHere are a couple of examples of title pages for various genres. Notice how each contains the title, author name, and publisher at the very least. The good ones include artwork as well.\n\nWhat Comes After the Title Page?\n\nAs mentioned above, the page right after the title page is called the verso or copyright page. However, when putting your fiction or nonfiction book together, it's important for the author to know what comes next in the front matter before the main text begins.\n\nHere's the most common formatting order for the front matter of a book:\n\nTitle Page\n\nCopyright Page\n\nTable of Contents (i.e. chapter headings)\n\nDedication Page\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nForeword\n\nPreface\n\nEpigraph\n\nNot every book has each of these elements. Again, it’s up to you as the author to decide which ones you want to include. However, the first three elements are the most important and every nonfiction and fiction book should have them.\n\nHow to Ensure an eReader Doesn't Skip Your Title Page\n\nYou may have noticed that when you open an eBook on a Kindle or other device, that it usually doesn't start at the very beginning (i.e. the cover of your book).\n\nInstead, Amazon and other retailers estimate where the book starts, and in some cases this can lead to a reader starting with chapter 1 and completely missing your title page!\n\nSo, assuming you want people to open to your title page (and you might not), you need a way for readers to start there, instead of chapter 1.\n\nThankfully, Atticus is the only formatting program that lets you do this.\n\nAll you have to do is go to the Book Details and select the section called “Start Page”.\n\nFrom there, you simply select where you would like readers to start when they open your book for the first time.\n\nThis inserts a special code into the eBook file that lets Amazon know exactly where to open the book for new readers. Simple as that!\n\nAtticus is the currently the only formatting software that lets you customize the Start Page of your book, and not only that, but it also works on virtually every platform, and it's over $100 cheaper than the competition (which does not have this Start Page feature).\n\nCheck Out Atticus Today!\n\nNow It's Time to Make Your Own Title Page"
