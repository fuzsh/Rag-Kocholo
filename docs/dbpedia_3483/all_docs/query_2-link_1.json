        "text": "Name stories are individuals’ explanations of the personal or traditional meaning, importance, or origin of their names. Writing their own stories helps kids to see the power of their own names. Listening to others’ name stories unpacks the personal history of people we will spend an entire year with.\n\nWhy Examine Names?\n\nNames matter. Central to identity, names influence who we are and how others view us. But even more important, names carry a story – a story of the past, perhaps carried across oceans or passed down through generations. They are attached to something or someone, or created and given to us. In some cases names can have the power to alter us, to give us agency, or, as history teaches – to erase us. Enslaved people were assigned the names of their masters, a process of dehumanization with the aim of obliterating people’s sense of self and identity.\n\nThe story of our name is another window into the examination of identity and the connection we can make with others.\n\nNot all names are in our personal repertoire. Names can be cultural, religious, ancestral, or invented. Many people live day to day with the looming dread of someone mispronouncing their name in an initial meeting, mistaking it on the first day of school, or misspelling it on a Starbucks cup. To hear one’s name repeatedly mispronounced or misspelled is often so frustrating that people may alter the spelling or pronunciation to make it easier for others. Anglicizing, Americanizing, or simplifying names is easier for assimilation, but at what cost to the bearer of the name?\n\nIf we want kids to have a strong sense of self, we can celebrate names and the stories behind them. We can also teach kids to ask us about and understand the importance of names to others.\n\nWhen is a Good Time to Celebrate Name Identity?\n\nWhen introducing yourself to your students\n\nWhen your class list is rich in diverse names\n\nWhen working to connect with your students as well as help them connect with others\n\nWhen working to build understanding or and empathy for a particular individual or group of people with whom students may have little background knowledge\n\nWhen reading a story with names that might be new to your students\n\nAt parent night. Having parents share the story of their child’s name before you ask kids to share those stories in class introduces the context of this work. It would be helpful to prompt parents to share the story with their child if they have not already.\n\n…\n\nThe above has been adapted from Being the Change.
