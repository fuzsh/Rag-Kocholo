        "text": "New to Microsoft Sway? This article provides an overview of how easy it is to create and share anything with Sway’s colorful and interactive canvas. Learn how to create and preview your first Sway, how to add and embed content, and how to share your finished creation with others.\n\nWhat is Sway?\n\nVideo: Use Sway to reimagine how your ideas come to life\n\nSway is a new app from Microsoft Office that makes it easy to create and share interactive reports, personal stories, presentations, and more.\n\nStart by adding your own text and pictures, search for and import relevant content from other sources, and then watch Sway do the rest. With Sway, you’re no longer limited to picking a pre-designed template that makes your presentations look like everyone else’s, and you don’t have to have any design skills to transform and showcase information in modern, interactive, and attention-getting ways.\n\nWith Sway, there’s no need to spend lots of time on formatting. Its built-in design engine takes care of making your creation look its best. If the initial design doesn’t quite match your taste or mood, you can easily apply another — or fully customize your layout to make it your own.\n\nIt’s super easy to share your finished Sways. Family, friends, classmates, and coworkers can see your creations on the Web without signing up, signing in, or downloading anything. And you can change the privacy settings for any Sway whenever you want more control over what you share.\n\nSway is free to use for anyone with a Microsoft Account (Hotmail, Live, or Outlook.com). You can create more sophisticated Sways with more content when you use Sway as part of an Microsoft 365 subscription. For more information, see Add more content to your Sways with Microsoft 365.\n\nWhat can I create with Sway?\n\nWhether it’s a report, a presentation, a newsletter, a personal story, a photo album, or a visual trip report, there’s virtually no limit on what you can express creatively with Sway.\n\nReports\n\nPresentations\n\nNewsletters\n\nStories\n\nIf you’re not sure what’s possible, you can get inspiration by viewing and interacting with Sways that other people have created. After you’ve signed in to Sway (see below), scroll down to the bottom of the My Sways page, and then browse through the featured content under the heading “Get inspired by a featured Sway.” You can also choose to start with one of the featured templates to begin using and learning Sway.\n\nSign in to start creating\n\nTo get started with Sway, visit sway.office.com in any browser and then click Sign in on the top menu bar.\n\nWhen prompted, enter the email address you want to use with Sway. You can use your free Microsoft Account (Hotmail, Outlook.com) or any organizational account given to you by your work or school. If you don’t already have an account, visit www.microsoft.com/account to sign up for free.\n\nOn the My Sways page that opens after you’ve signed in, click or tap Create New to start creating your first Sway.\n\nGet to know the Sway Storyline\n\nThe Storyline is where you type, insert, edit, and format the content that tells your story. Content is arranged in sequential order by adding cards, each of which holds the type of content you want — such as text, images, videos, and even Office documents. The order of cards can be rearranged at any time to suit your needs.\n\nGive your Sway a title\n\nClick the Title your Sway placeholder text shown in the first card on the Storyline, and then type a short but meaningful description of what your Sway is all about. When you later share your finished Sway, this title will be the first thing that others will see.\n\nAdd images and text to your Sway\n\nTo add content to your Sway, such as text, images, or videos, click or tap the + icon at the bottom of any existing card. You can also drag and drop text and images right onto your Storyline. (Don’t hesitate to experiment — you can change the order of your content at any time and customize each card the way you want.)\n\nAdd content to your Sway\n\nYou can easily search for and add additional content to your Sway, such as an image that is stored on your computer or mobile device. Sway can also search the Web for the most relevant content, such as videos, and add it to your Sway. On the menu bar, click Insert, select your preferred content source from the menu, and then enter any search keyword or phrase into the Search sources box.\n\nPreview your Sway\n\nYou can preview your work in progress at any time by clicking the Design tab. When you preview your Sway, you can see how it will appear to others when you later decide to share it. To fully experience your Sway, click the Play button on the top menu bar.\n\nTo return to your Storyline when you’re done previewing your Sway, click the Storyline tab.\n\nChange the style of your Sway\n\nSway lets you focus on what you’re trying to communicate by taking care of the formatting, design, and layout of your content. You can keep Sway’s suggested default design, select and apply your own, and even customize the layout.\n\nTo choose a style for your Sway, click Design on the menu bar, and then select Styles. To choose a random look and mood for your Sway at any time, click the Remix! button until you find a design and layout you like. You can also adjust a specific part of the currently applied style, such as color, font, and textures, by clicking the Customize button in the Styles pane.\n\nIf you want to control how others will view and navigate your Sway once you’ve shared it, select whether your content should scroll vertically, horizontally, or appear like a presentation.\n\nShare your Sway\n\nReady to share your Sway with the world — or perhaps just with selected people? Click the Share button on the top menu bar and then select how you want to share your Sway. Your choices on this menu depend on the type of account that you used to sign in to Sway.\n\nFor a more detailed look at all available sharing options, see Share your Sway.\n\nGo mobile with Sway\n\nSway works in all modern mobile browsers, regardless of platform. Whether you’re taking the sightseeing trip of a lifetime, documenting research for school, or taking part in an important business conference, Sway is always just a tap away.\n\nSway.office.com\n\nVisit sway.office.com in any mobile browser, no matter what the platform or device.\n\nSway for Windows 10\n\nFind the free Sway app for your Windows 10 device in the Microsoft Store."
