        "text": "Writing Formal Reports\n\nWhile you may write much shorter, more casual reports, it’s helpful to go into a bit of detail about formal reports. Formal reports are modular, which means that they have many pieces. Most audience members will not read every piece, so these pieces should stand on their own. That means that you will often repeat yourself. That’s okay. Your audience should be able to find exactly what they need in a particular section, even if that information has been repeated elsewhere.\n\nWhile it’s fine to copy and paste between sections, you will likely need to edit your work to ensure that the tone, level of detail and organization meet the needs of that section. For example, the Executive Summary is aimed at managers. It’s a short, persuasive overview of everything in the report. The Introduction may contain very similar information, but it focuses on giving a short, technical overview of everything in the report. Its goal is to inform, not to persuade.\n\nLet’s take a look at some of the parts of the report in greater detail.\n\nTitle Page\n\nThe title page provides the audience with the:\n\nName of the report\n\nThis should appear 2 inches from the top margin in uppercase letters.\n\nName, title, and organization of the individual receiving the report\n\nType “Prepared for” on one line, followed by two separate lines that provide the receiving organization’s name and then the city and state. Some reports may include an additional line that presents the name of a specific person.\n\nName of the author and any necessary identifying information\n\nType “prepared by” on one line, followed by the name(s) of the author(s) and their organization, all on separate lines.\n\nDate of submission\n\nThis date may differ from the date the report was written. It should appear 2 inches above the bottom margin.\n\nThe items on the title page should be equally spaced apart from each other.\n\nA note on page numbers:\n\nThe title page should not include a page number, but this page is counted as page “i.” Use software features to create two sections for your report. You can then utilize two different types of numbering schemes. When numbering the pages (i.e., i, ii, iii, etc.) for a formal report, use lowercase roman numerals for all front matter components. Utilize arabic numbers for the other pages that follow. Additionally, if you intend to bind the report on the left, move the left margin and center 0.25 inches to the right.\n\nLetter of Transmittal\n\nA letter of transmittal announces the report topic to the recipient(s).\n\nIf applicable, the first paragraph should identify who authorized the report and why the report is significant. Provide the purpose of the report in the first paragraph as well. The next paragraph should briefly identify, categorize, and describe the primary and secondary research of the report. Use the concluding paragraph to offer to discuss the report; it is also customary to conclude by thanking the reader for their time and consideration.\n\nThe letter of transmittal should be formatted as a business letter. Some report writers prefer to send a memo of transmittal instead.\n\nWhen considering your audience for the letter or memo of transmittal, make sure that you use a level of formality appropriate for your relationship with the reader. While all letters should contain professional and respectful language, a letter to someone you do not know should pay closer attention to the formality of the word choice and tone.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe table of contents page features the headings and secondary headings of the report and their page numbers, enabling audience members to quickly locate specific parts of the report. Leaders (i.e. spaced or unspaced dots) are used to guide the reader’s eye from the headings to their page numbers.\n\nThe words “TABLE OF CONTENTS” should appear at the top of the page in all uppercase and bolded letters. Type the titles of major report parts in all uppercase letters as well, double spacing between them. Secondary headings should be indented and single spaced, using a combination of upper- and lowercase letters.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nAn executive summary presents an overview of the report that can be used as a time-saving device by recipients who do not have time to read the entire report.\n\nThe executive summary should include a:\n\nSummary of purpose\n\nOverview of key findings\n\nIdentification of conclusions\n\nOverview of recommendations\n\nTo begin, type “EXECUTIVE SUMMARY” in all uppercase letters and centered. Follow this functional head with paragraphs that include the above information, but do not use first-level headings to separate each item. Each paragraph of information should be single-spaced with double spacing between paragraphs. Everything except for the title should be left-aligned.\n\nAn executive summary is usually ten percent of the length of the report. For example, a ten-page report should offer a one-page summary. A 100-page report should feature a summary that is approximately ten pages.\n\nThe executive summary is usually seen as the most important part of the report, and it should be written last. When you’re writing the executive summary, imagine that you’re sitting across from your most important audience member. If you only have a few minutes to talk to them, what do you want them to know? What would be most persuasive?"
