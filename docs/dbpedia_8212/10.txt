IT is a game where the top club entertains the bottom one, but to write Pontypool off would be foolish and head coach Gareth Lintern can at least take pleasure in that his injury-hit squad has never really been put to the sword by opponents as they learn more match by match.

What they badly need is former Llanelli fly-half Sam Mills to kick goals in the manner that Luke Richards, his opposite number, has been doing. Pooler could be back to nearer full strength in a fortnight, but meanwhile rest young lock Sam Pailor after U20 midweek duty.

Pooler give a debut to Michael Hook and a return to the club for Keith Stewart, both are replacements, while Llanelli have three new faces.

French Sevens flyer Yannick N’Gog, on a three-week loan from Agen to the Scarlets, starts at left wing; exciting young prospect Scott Williams has a debut at centre and former Llandovery skipper Arwel Davies is on the bench.

Llanelli: A Banfield; M Davies, S Williams, M Brayley, Y N’Gog; L Richards, J James; I Jones, C Hawkins (capt), S Gardner, A Powell, A Shingler, L Jones, D Godfrey, J Bater.

Pontypool: G Williams; N Preece, A Sclizney, J Leyshon, W Kershaw-Naylor; S Mills, C Morgan; A Williams, M Lewis, S Maguire, D Cox, D Critchley, R Bowen, A Brake, C Trayhern.
