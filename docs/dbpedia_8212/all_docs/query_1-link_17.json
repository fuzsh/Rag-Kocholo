        "text": "Jean-Yves M’Voto came through the ranks at Paris Saint-Germain with the likes of Mamadou Sakho, David N’Gog and Yannick Boli before moving to Roy Keane’s Sunderland.\n\nHowever, his focus is now on rebuilding his career amidst a less stellar cast at Raith Rovers.\n\nNow 27, the imposing 6’4” defender won the French under-18 championship with PSG but, after failing to play a first team game, turned down the offer of contract from Paul Le Guen in preference of a move to England in 2008.\n\nA series of injuries stunted his development at Sunderland and after loan spells with Southend United and Oldham Athletic he has been a football drifter ever since.\n\nNow, the Paris-born defender is eager to prove himself all over again in the Scottish Championship.\n\nM’Voto said: “The team and the manager have helped me to settle in well and so far everything is good.\n\n“I used to know the manager. Last year, he wanted me to come to Kilmarnock and in the end it didn’t happen, but we kept in contact and I’m here now.\n\n“I started at PSG and won the under-18s league. We all came through, players like N’Gog who played for Liverpool, Mamadou Sakho, Youssouf Mulumbu, who is now at Norwich.\n\n“Of course that was a great foundation for me as a player. It was a great experience and a great thing to happen in my career. Now, I just want to get my career back up and running.”\n\nRaith will top their Group D in the Betfred Cup and qualify for the knock-out phase this afternoon if they can defeat Alloa Athletic, who currently top the table with a 100 per cent record.\n\nHe is still getting to know his new team-mates and the Scottish game but M’Voto has high hopes.\n\nHe added: “Every season is different. Maybe we won’t need the play-offs, maybe we will win promotion without play-offs.\n\n“First, we need to concentrate on this game, because it will be a hard game and it won’t be easy. If we do our best we will be fine.”"
