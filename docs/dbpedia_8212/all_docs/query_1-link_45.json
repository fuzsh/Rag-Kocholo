        "text": "Jean-Alain Boumsong early life\n\nJean-Alain Boumsong, born in Douala, moved to France when he was 14 years old. David N'Gog, his cousin, also became a professional footballer.\n\nHe demonstrated early aptitude for the sport, particularly basketball and football. Speaking about\n\nJean-Alain Boumsong’s childhood\n\n, it should be mentioned that he chose football, and three years later he received his first license at the Ile-de-France club US Palaiseau.\n\nTraining clubs flocked to secure his services after he was identified as a promising prospect for the club: Le Havre Athletic Club Football Association, SM Caen, FC Sochaux, and AJ Auxerre. There is no information available about\n\nAlain Boumsong’s parents\n\n.\n\nJean-Alain Boumsong personal life\n\nA notable fact about Jean-Alain Boumsong is that he has a DEUG MIAS (Mathematics and Computer Science Applied to Sciences) from the University of Le Havre, which he obtained in 1999.\n\nHe is the cousin of David N'Gog (1989-), a Paris Saint-Germain striker who was a French international hopeful from 2008 to 2010. In 2006, he established the charity Adna le Rassemblement to assist those in need.\n\nHis involvement in the associative world is further strengthened by his membership on the board of directors of the Lyon association Sport Dans La Ville, which promotes the professional integration of young people from disadvantaged neighborhoods. Jean-Alain Boumsong converted to Islam at the age of 19.\n\nJean-Alain Boumsong professional career\n\nIn 1997, Jean-Alain Boumsong made his professional debut for French club Le Havre before joining AJ Auxerre in 2000. In 2004, his efforts at Auxerre won him a transfer to Rangers.\n\nIn 2008, he returned to France with Lyon. His last season was at\n\nPanathinaikos\n\nin the Greek Super League, where he ended his career in 2013. He made 27 appearances for the France national team between 2003 and 2009, scoring one goal.\n\nBoumsong rapidly adjusted to the Scottish game and shown his ability as a center-back, prompting speculation that his time in Glasgow might be cut short.\n\nNewcastle, under new manager Graeme Souness, made an £8 million offer for him halfway through the 2004–05 season, which Rangers accepted in a trade that was completed once the January 2005 transfer window opened.\n\nJean-Alain Boumsong club playing career\n\nIn Normandy, he made his D 1 debut on March 13, 1998, at the age of 18 in a match between Le Havre Athletic Club Football Association and AS Cannes (2-0).\n\nHis strong performances with the club earned him the attention of Guy Roux's AJ Auxerre, who hired him in 2000.\n\nAuxerre\n\nA notable\n\nfact about Jean-Alain Boumsong\n\nis that he had a difficult start in Burgundy, under the direction of Daniel Rolland (Guy Roux had announced his retirement as coach before returning after one season).\n\nOnly in his second season did he excel in central defense alongside Philippe Mexès. His excellent form coincides, in particular, with Guy Roux's return to the position of coach. He advanced rapidly within a young group that included Djibril Cissé, Olivier Kapo, Philippe Mexès, and Khalilou Fadiga.\n\nAJA won the Coupe de France in 2003 with a 2-1 victory over Paris SG, thanks to a goal in the 89th minute by Jean-Alain Boumsong.\n\nHe then became a possible priority signing for\n\nLiverpool FC\n\nmanager Gérard Houllier, and the press speculated that it was only a matter of time before Boumsong signed with Liverpool. Boumsong, on the other hand, was a free agent at the end of the 2003-2004 season because his contract with AJ Auxerre had just expired in June 2004.\n\nWillie McKay, his agent, then negotiated the best possible salary for his client, and he joined Rangers in the Scottish Premier League.\n\nRangers\n\nDuring the summer of 2004, he joined Alex McLeish in signing a five-year contract with the Scottish club Glasgow Rangers. He declares himself \"extremely pleased\" and quickly adopts the Scottish style of play.\n\nGlasgow is eliminated in the first round of the Champions League and will compete in the UEFA Cup. Boumsong takes home the Scottish Championship.\n\nNewcastle United\n\nand new manager Graeme Souness made an offer of £ 8,000,000 only six months after his arrival, in the January 2005 transfer window. When the transfer market opened in January 2005, Glasgow Rangers accepted the offer and the transfer was completed.\n\nNewcastle\n\nJean-Alain Boumsong has agreed to terms with the Magpies on a five-and-a-half-year contract. Nonetheless, because Boumsong had played the required number of matches for Glasgow Rangers that season, he was awarded the Scottish Championship Winners' Medal despite only spending half the season with the Scottish club.\n\nTransfer fees of £ 8,000,000 raised some eyebrows because the player was nearing the end of his contract before signing for free with Glasgow Rangers a few months earlier, and Newcastle had shown no interest in signing him at the time.\n\nHis time in Tyneside has been a mixed bag. During his first season at Newcastle, his defensive abilities were lauded, as was his understanding with teammate Titus Bramble.\n\nBecause of his popularity, his fans chanted the first syllable of his name, lengthening the sound in the same way that\n\nArsenal\n\nfans chanted the name Nwankwo Kanu. However, his second season at Newcastle was less successful.\n\nBoumsong's defensive abilities began to deteriorate, and he was frequently blamed for several goals conceded.\n\nAn important\n\nfact about Jean-Alain Boumsong\n\nis that he was chosen by Raymond Domenech for the 2006 World Cup after participating in eleven qualifying matches, but he did not play in any of the matches.\n\nJuventus\n\nOn August 22, 2006, he reached an agreement with the Italian club\n\nJuventus\n\n, which had been relegated to Serie B, for a fee of 3,300,000 pounds sterling and clauses based on Juventus' sporting results.\n\nA notable fact about Jean-Alain Boumsong is that he scored his first goal for Juventus in a match against FC Crotone in September 2006, which Juventus won 3–0; Valeri Bojinov scored the other two goals. Under Didier Deschamps' orders, Boumsong becomes an undisputed holder, and Juventus is relegated to Serie A at the end of the season.\n\nDeschamps leaves the club after disagreeing with the club's leaders on certain transfers that would have been imposed on him.\n\nClaudio Ranieri\n\n, his replacement, made it clear to Boumsong that he would not be relying on him this season. Boumsong remains with Juve because he wants to experience Serie A.\n\nHe is injured on November 4, 2007, and will be out of commission for several weeks. Claudio Ranieri has not used him much since his return from injury.\n\nBoumsong scores the equalizer against rivals Inter Milan in a Coppa Italia match in his final match with this club on January 23, 2008. Olympique Lyonnais became interested in the French international at that time.\n\nOlympic Lyonnaise\n\nHe commits to Olympique Lyonnais on January 26, 2008, by signing a three-and-a-half-year contract. The transfer is valued at 4.6 million euros. Boumsong claims he joined Lyon to improve his chances of playing for France in the Euro 2008 team coached by Raymond Domenech.\n\nHe takes over for Cleber Anderson, who has been out for six months due to an injury. The latter had already been signed with the intention of replacing Cris, who had been seriously injured at the start of the season by Johan Elmander. His trainer, Alain Perrin, believes in him.\n\nOn February 8, 2008, he played in his first match in his new colors, a 4-1 victory over FC Sochaux-Montbéliard at the Stade Gerland. Furthermore, he scored his first goal for Lyon against Le Mans FC on April 4, 2009. He was selected for Euro 2008 at the end of the season.\n\nHaving grown accustomed to playing alongside Cris, his new coach, Claude Puel, confirms his place as a starter and expresses his faith in him. Since August 22, 2009, when he opened the scoring against\n\nAJ Auxerre\n\nin his first start of the season.\n\nPanathinaikos\n\nIn August 2010, he joined Greek club Panathinaikos, where he played alongside Djibril Cissé and Sidney Govou. The transfer fee is €500,000.\n\nHe agreed to a three-year contract with the Greek club, with an annual salary of 1.9 million euros. Despite a difficult start to the season, he is gradually improving his performance and gaining the confidence of his fans. In a 2–0 win over Panserraikos FC, he scored his first goal.\n\nBoumsong's contract with the club was extended for two more years in 2012, until 2014. Boumsong was named vice-captain for the 2012–13 season over the summer. In the first leg of the third qualifying round of the 2012-2013 Champions League, he scored the first goal in a 2-0 victory over Motherwell FC.\n\nJean-Alain Boumsong international career\n\nAn important\n\nfact about Jean-Alain Boumsong\n\nis that he was logically selected at the end of the 2001-2002 season to play the Euro Espoirs after participating as an undisputed holder in almost all of Les Bleuets' qualifying matches for the 2002 European Espoirs Championship, which was held in Switzerland.\n\nFrance, who performed admirably, advances to the final, where it is defeated by the Czech Republic's Petr ech and Milan Baro. Les Bleuets are defeated in a penalty shootout in the final.\n\nThus, the solid defender knows his first selection in the France team on June 20, 2003 (victory 2 goals to 1 against Japan and a penalty in Geoffroy-Chaudron Guichard's stéphanois) during the Confederations Cup. France triumphed over Cameroon in the competition (1-0 ap).\n\nJacques Santini put his faith in him once more for a major competition, this time Euro 2004 in Portugal. He takes part in a Euro 2016 match against Switzerland (3-1). Santini has left for Tottenham, and Raymond Domenech has been appointed as the Blues' new manager.\n\nBoumsong appeared in eleven consecutive matches during the World Cup qualifiers. He is chosen for the World Cup but does not play in any of Germany's six matches.\n\nIn May 2008, he was named to Raymond Domenech's Euro 2008 squad. The Blues are out in the first round. Boumsong appeared in the most recent match, a 0-2 loss to Italy, coming on in the 26th minute in place of Samir Nasri (who had just replaced\n\nFranck Ribéry\n\nafter the expulsion of\n\nÉric Abidal\n\n).\n\nDomenech is still the coach, and he has summoned Boumsong for the three World Cup qualifying matches against Austria, Serbia, and Romania. France lost to Austria (1-3) in a disastrous match that marked the return of Mexes in blue, won against Serbia (2-1), and drew (2-2) in Romania.\n\nDomenech called him up on February 10, 2009, to face Diego Maradona's Argentina two days later in Marseille.\n\nJean-Alain Boumsong media career\n\nDuring the 2010 World Cup, Jean-Alain Boumsong began his career as a consultant for Europe 1 radio and the continuous news channel. He also appeared on BeIN Sports with Xavier Domergue to discuss the 2012 European Championship.\n\nSince leaving Panathinaikos, Jean-Alain Boumsong has been commentating on Ligue 1, Champions League, and Europa League matches on BeIN, always alongside Xavier Domergue.\n\nOn certain Fridays, before and after the Ligue 1 match, he consults with Florian Genton and Éric Roy. He has also appeared on BeIN Sports' new talk show, Sports Night, which looks back on evening matches, since February 2014.\n\nJean-Alain Boumsong coaching career\n\nOn September 5, 2018, he was named Clarence Seedorf's assistant coach for Cameroon 14. While he is still without a formal contract and has not heard from Cameroonian football leaders since the end of CAN 2019, the former French defender lamented the lack of professionalism on Canal+'s Talents d'Afrique.\n\n\"It's good to know that my contract was never signed, and I haven't had any contact with the Cameroonian football federation since leaving Cairo in July. There were negotiations for the contract, and there was an agreement, but the contract was not formalized. Except for the fact that the contract was not signed, there is evidence.\"\n\nJean-Alain Boumsong failed potentials at Newcastle\n\nSir Bobby Robson may have agreed to keep the No. 6 jersey vacant in case Jonathan Woodgate's transfer to\n\nReal Madrid\n\ndid not pan out, but Newcastle United had to start searching for a successor sooner or later.\n\nIn the summer of 2004, Jean Alain Boumsong, who played for Rangers in a pre-season friendly at St James' Park, was already on the club's radar.\n\nIn fact, a few weeks into the new season, head scout Charlie Woods was assigned to see Boumsong and Celtic rival Bobo Balde in the Old Firm game. Woods had no idea that his journey to Glasgow would be his last scouting expedition with Sir Bobby.\n\n\"I figured I'd best call Bobby on my way back,\" Woods said. \"What did you think?' he said. 'Bobby, they're not for us,' I remarked. If we sign these two, I believe we will have a problem.”\n\n\"He attempted but failed to reach the chairman [Freddy Shepherd], and on the bank holiday Monday, I was in my apartment with my wife, Pat, when Bobby called.”\n\n\"'I got a weird phone call from [team administrator] Tony Toward,' he remarked. In a manner, his voice was trembling. 'Are you able to meet me on the ground?”\n\n\"I walked down to the ground, and we both came to a halt at the same moment. After getting the call, he headed upstairs to meet Freddy. 'Charlie, I've lost my job,' he remarked as he came down.\"\n\nIn the blink of an eye, Sir Bobby and Woodgate were replaced by Graeme Souness and Boumsong, respectively.\n\nBoumsong would end up becoming the most expensive signing of the January transfer window in 2005, and the £8 million transaction remains a mystery to this day.\n\nHowever, after seeing Boumsong in action - a club delegation visited Rangers' UEFA Cup clash against AZ Alkmaar - Souness thought the defender has all of the qualities required to perform in the Premier League.\n\nIt wasn't simply Boumsong's speed, presence, or ease on the ball that drew Souness' attention; he saw the newcomer as a potential leader in a team that lacked talkers.\n\nSouness obviously thought it was a risk worth taking since feedback from his connections in Scotland had been favorable - John Hartson did not like playing against Boumsong - and he definitely believed it was a risk worth taking.\n\nSouness was heavily involved in the purchase, and the former Rangers manager already had a long-standing connection with Sir David Murray, the Gers' chairman at the time, having recruited Tugay, Barry Ferguson, and Lorenzo Amoruso from his old club when in charge of Blackburn.\n\nWhile Newcastle had a free hand with Boumsong, who had only just joined Rangers on a Bosman, Souness trusted his own judgment.\n\nRay Clarke, who had previously worked with Souness at Southampton, replaced Woods, the club's head scout, who had departed Newcastle.\n\nClarke said: \"It was a major signing. From Rangers, Graeme recognized him. Rio Ferdinand was sold to Manchester United for £30 million a few years ago. Was Boumsong really worth £8 million? I'm not sure.”\n\n\"While I was in Newcastle, I never paid attention to him. I believe the agreement had already been made. The only thing I know is that Boumsong showed up to the club.\"\n\nBoumsong may have won trophies with Rangers, Juventus, and Lyon, and represented France 27 times, but his year-and-a-half at Newcastle is the one blemish on his resume.\n\nBoumsong's former Rangers teammate Alex Rae said that the 'laidback big man' is 'probably sitting in a large castle in France worried about where it all went wrong.'\n\nHowever, Rae's memories of their short time together in Glasgow provide insight into what drew Souness' attention and why Boumsong underperformed in the Premier League.\n\nRae said: \"Big Boumsong was a really gifted youngster. He had everything, to be honest. He possessed speed, ability to play, and a calm demeanor. He possessed all the characteristics of a true athlete, and he could also control the ball like a centre-half.”\n\n\"It wasn't surprising to me that we lost him so fast since he cantered during the first four or five months of his Rangers career.”\n\n\"I believed he was taking liberties because it was so simple for him. If he gave up possession, he had such excellent recovery abilities in terms of his speed that he would always recover. He only ever lost it once in a while.”\n\n\"There were occasions when he'd flip it over the centre-head, forward's take it to the other side, and simply walk out of the defense.\"\n\nWhen Boumsong came up against quicker, faster, and wiser attackers in England like Thierry Henry, he wasn't going to get away with the same techniques.\n\nAlthough Glasgow and Newcastle are just 150 miles apart, it was a completely different game. Boumsong had little time to catch his breath in the Premier League, having come in the middle of the season.\n\nBoumsong kept in contact with his 'little brother,' Hamed Namouchi, a fellow French speaker in the Rangers locker room, and it was obviously a trying time for the new signing.\n\n\"He had to leave France, settle in Glasgow, and then relocate with his family again in order to play for two teams in one season. He attempted to deal with it, but it was tough\" Namouchi had said.\n\n\"It wasn't only him, but since it was such a large trade, all of the fans' and people's attention was focused on him because such a large investment had been made in him.”\n\n\"He made a valiant effort. When I talked with him on the phone, I recall him being really anxious about the findings. He want to do more.\"\n\nBoumsong, according to Souness, struggled because he lacked a reliable defensive partner, and it's worth noting that the centre-wife, back's Juliette, and son, Cameron, were both very unwell during his tenure at the club.\n\nBoumsong's penchant to let the ball go in behind had long perplexed Souness' replacement, the late Glenn Roeder.\n\nWhile Boumsong was fast to get out of a bad position, there were times when others had to step in, leaving holes elsewhere.\n\nBoumsong's teammates saw how the 6ft 3in defender was being outmuscled by opponents more regularly as the months passed and his confidence dwindled.\n\nBoumsong's lowest moment at Newcastle was undoubtedly against Liverpool in March 2006, when he was coached by Roeder. Boumsong handed up a penalty and was sent off after pulling Peter Crouch to the ground following a hilarious miskick.\n\nDjibril Cisse, a former Auxerre teammate, was in Liverpool's starting lineup that day, while Teemu Tainio, another former Auxerre teammate, was impressing Spurs at the time.\n\nTainio is still perplexed as to why Boumsong, who had a \"winning mindset that could be seen in training on a daily basis,\" was not a big success in England.\n\n\"I always believed the Premier League was the appropriate location for him while we were in France, knowing his skills as a player,\" Tainio said.\n\n\"I had high hopes for him and felt he would be a natural fit for English football, so I was disappointed to see him struggle at times. I'm sorry, but I'm not sure why.”\n\n\"On the other hand, he was a member of the national team at the same time, so it may simply have been a matter of different playing styles.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Boumsong was given a second chance by compatriot\n\nDidier Deschamps\n\n, who had recently taken over as coach of Juventus.\n\nAfter the Bianconeri were demoted to Serie B for the first time in their history as punishment for their role in the Calciopoli match-fixing scandal, the Frenchman moved to Turin.\n\nFormer teammates recall the importance of the center-contribution back's throughout that season. 'Finding a defender who was that powerful physically with superb technique was not simple,' according to striker Raffaele Palladino, but Boumsong's arrival was 'very vital' to Juventus moving out of Serie B.\n\nSome more facts about Jean-Alain Boumsong:\n\nDespite having only been a Newcastle player for around five months when Rangers won the championship, Boumsong got a Scottish Premiership Winners Medal since he had played the required number of games for Rangers that season. Boumsong signed a five-and-a-half-year deal with the Magpies.\n\nThe £8 million transfer cost aroused eyebrows, since the player had joined Rangers for free only months previously, and Newcastle had shown no interest in recruiting him because he was out of contract. This is one of the transfers that the Stevens investigation report voiced concern about in June 2007:\n\n\"There are contradictions in the testimony offered by Graeme Souness, the club's previous manager, and Freddy Shepherd, who seems to be working in an undefined function but not as a club official, about their separate responsibilities in transfer discussions.\"\n\nThe Stevens inquiry, on the other hand, eventually provided two explanations. \"We wish to make it clear that there were no inconsistencies in Graeme Souness' evidence to Quest concerning his role in transfers covered by the Inquiry during his time as manager of Newcastle United F.C., and neither the Premier League nor Quest have any concerns in this regard.\"\n\nIn the case of McKay, it was stated: \"In light of the key findings from the final Quest report, which the Premier League released on June 15, 2007, Quest would like to emphasize that no evidence of irregular payments was found in the transfers involving the agent Willie McKay during the investigation period. Mr. McKay's help with the investigation is also appreciated by Quest.\"\n\nIn terms of his form, he had a bit of a mixed bag throughout his time on Tyneside. He was recognized for his defensive talents and relationship with Titus Bramble during his first season at Newcastle.\n\nLike Arsenal supporters screaming Nwankwo Kanu's name, his popularity led to fans yelling the initial syllable of his name, elongating the sound.\n\nHis second season at Newcastle, on the other hand, was not as warmly welcomed. Boumsong's defensive qualities started to deteriorate, and he was often criticised for goals conceded. He attributed his poor performance on his girlfriend's sickness and other personal issues.\n\nAn important fact about Jean-Alain Boumsong is that he joined Juventus for £3.3 million on August 22, 2006, after being demoted from Serie B. Newcastle was promised potential bonuses based on Juventus' future success. Boumsong made his Juventus debut in September 2006, scoring his first goal in a 3–0 victory against Crotone.\n\nThe other two goals were scored by Valeri Bojinov. On the 23rd of January 2008, Boumsong scored a crucial equalizer in Juventus' last Coppa Italia match against Internazionale.\n\nBoumsong signed a three-and-a-half-year deal with French club Olympique Lyonnais on January 24, 2008.\n\nHe indicated that he took this decision to improve his chances of being selected for Raymond Domenech's EURO 2008 team.\n\nOn February 8, 2008, he made his debut for the club in a 4–1 victory against Sochaux at Stade de Gerland. On 4 April 2009, he scored his first Lyon goal against Le Mans in the 2008–09 season.\n\nBoumsong moved from Olympique Lyonnais to Panathinaikos F.C. in the Superleague Greece champions for a sum that might reach €750,000. He signed a three-year deal with the Greek club, with an annual salary of €1.9 million.\n\nDespite a shaky start to the season, he steadily improved his performance and earned the fans' faith. In a 2–0 victory against Panserraikos, he scored his first goal.\n\nA notable fact about Jean-Alain Boumsong is that he signed a two-year deal with Panathinaikos in 2012, extending his tenure at the club until 2014.\n\nBoumsong was named vice-captain of the club for the 2012–13 season over the summer. In the first leg of the third qualifying round of the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League, he scored the opening goal in a 2–0 victory against Motherwell.\n\nBoumsong earned his France debut against Japan on June 20, 2003, and was named to the team for Euro 2004, albeit he only appeared in one game as a substitute.\n\nIn the 2006 World Cup qualifications, he established himself as a regular starter for the national team, and he was called up to the squad for the 2006 World Cup, although he did not see any game action due to Lillian Thuram's comeback to the team. Boumsong was also chosen to France's Euro 2008 team.\n\nBoumsong only participated in one game during Euro 2008, when he replaced\n\nSamir Nasri\n\nin a group match between France and Italy.\n\nNasri had just been on the field for 16 minutes when he came in to replace the injured Franck Ribéry, but after central defender Eric Abidal was sent off, French coach Raymond Domenech chose to replace him with defender Boumsong.\n\nAn important fact about Jean-Alain Boumsong is that he had already been sent on the field as a substitute's replacement at the Euro 2004 when he replaced William Gallas during a match against Switzerland, making him the first player in European Championship history to do it twice.\n\nBoumsong began working as a consultant for the worldwide TV broadcaster beIN Sports after retiring. On September 5, 2018, it was revealed that Boumsong, along with Patrick Kluivert and Jol Epalle, had been named assistant manager to newly recruited manager\n\nClarence Seedorf\n\nfor the Cameroon national football team.\n\nJean-Alain Boumsong social media\n\nRegarding\n\nJean-Alain Boumsong social media\n\n, it should be mentioned that he has a Twitter account (\n\n@JABoumsong\n\n) with more than 12k followers.\n\nJean-Alain Boumsong body measurements\n\nSpeaking about\n\nJean-Alain Boumsong body measurements\n\n, it should be mentioned that his height is 191 centimeters and his weight is 84 kg.\n\nJean-Alain Boumsong net worth and salary\n\nJean-Alain Boumsong's net worth\n\nis estimated to be around $8 million, according to Wikipedia, Forbes, and Business Insider.\n\nRead more:\n\nFollow\n\nSportmob\n\nfor the\n\nlatest football news"
