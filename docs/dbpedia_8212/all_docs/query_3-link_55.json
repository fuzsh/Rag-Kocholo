Palace will rival Millwall, Watford and Peterborough in the signature of Jordan Rhodes but it looks like Palace are leading the race. Danny Green of Dagenham and Redbridge is a target but Peterborough have stolen Palace's march as they would have preferred to see what happens over the summer with Danns and Ambrose but may be forced to make a bid if Peterborough do have a bid accepted. Jose Semedo deal looks unlikely as Charlton look set to hold on to their man. Palace did hold talks with the Portuguese midfielder but he looks set to stay at The Valley. Kagisho Dikgacoi will hold talks over a possible transfer but the signing will depend if Dikgacoi is willing to ply his trade in the Championship and whether Martin Jol wants to hold onto him. Freedman is also looking to add two central defenders with the prime targets being Danny Shu and Gianni Zuiverloon. Matthew Kilgallon is also being closely watched. Craig Conway is still mulling over his options with Rangers, Watford and Ipswich also interested in the Scottish wide man. George Boyd is being looked at as an alternative but whether Peterborough are willing to let go of one of their prized assets leave is uncertain. Palace are willing to sign at the right price but their promotion to the Championship may force his price through the roof. Chris Burke is also holding talks with Palace.\n\nNorwich City:\n\nEliott Bennett will put pen to paper for 1.5 million and Lansbury and Pacheco will both agree to resign on loan next season. Wes Morgan is likely to sign for the canaries from Nottingham Forest. Forster, Westwood or Green will sign with Forster being the most likely. Bradley Johnson is all but signed and Neil Danns is also being looked at. Lee Bowyer is being looked at to add experience whilst Michael Brown and Nick Montgomery is also of interest. Mackail Smith will sign for around 2.5m. Another defender and midfielder will also be signed.\n\nWest Ham:\n\nBig Sam will start his clear out almost straight away with Green, Dyer, Parker, Cole, Kovac, Upson, Faubert, Ba, Ilunga, Hitzlberger, Hines, Piquionne and Jacobsen all leaving. Barrera may also be leaving. All loanees will return to their parent clubs. Westwood will most likely be signed in goal and if not Boaz Myhill will be looked at. Konchesky, Samuel and Shorey are all being looked at for the left back berth. Lee Peltier will most likely be signed for the right back position. If not a youngster will be signed. All though lots of midfielders are leaving, Allardyce see's that area the strongest will look to add two centre mids. Tamir Cohen, Lee Bowyer, Keith Andrews, Alan Smith, Michael Brown and Neil Kilkenny being looked at. Andrews and either Cohen, Bowyer or Brown will most likely be signed. Up top Jason Roberts seems likely to sign. Kenny Miller, David Goodwillie and David Nugent are also being looked at for other striker berth. Most likely Kenny Miller.\n\nOver and Out,\n\nGary J(10)(8)\n\n08 Jun 2011 16:39:45\n\nnewly promoted sides QPR, Norwich and Swansea will battle it out against Tottenham for the signature of Liverpool flops christian poulson and joe cole each to be worth around £6m each, Swansea also intrested in another Liverpool player, Paul Konchesky who would be available for around £4m for the Welsh side(3)(9)\n\n08 Jun 2011 16:39:20\n\nohara not coming to wolves anymore he not joined yet\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nwhat are u on about u qpr fan. he has signed this morning but wolves are tring to sign a nother spurs player befor friday when the confrence is on.(6)(8)\n\n08 Jun 2011 16:38:06\n\nMarlon Harewood is going to sign for Notts County on a Two year contract.

Liverpool have missed out on Phil Jones despite the club willing to pay the £16m Blackburn wanted for the 19-year old defender it was Jones himself that opted for United.Liverpool have turned their attention to Scott Dann of Birmingham who is available for around £8m which could look like a bargain with some of the figures that are floating around at the minute.Arsenal are also in for Dann but Dann is a lifelong Liverpool fan and former season ticket holder and I expect to see him back on Merseyside next season.Connor Wickham another Liverpool fan is also looking increasingly likely to join the club but again at an extortionate fee while he is a very promising player Ipswich have rejected an initial bid of £7.8m and are holding out for at least £10m.Juan Mata of Valencia is the clubs top summer target but Valencia will not talk to any clubs until after the European U-21 Championships with the hope of driving the players price up.I have been trying to get news on which left back the club will sign but with Newcastle refusing to lower their £10m valuation on defender Jose Enrique despite only having 12 months left on his contract I have no clue who we will sign. Aly Cissokho, Gael Clichy, Nacho Monreal , Marcelo and Emilio Izaguirre are all thought to be on the agenda and while I was really hoping for Leighton Baines or Fabio Coentrao the pair are heading to Manchester City and Real Madrid respectively.All of the above is true not just rumors.(15)(12)\n\n08 Jun 2011 16:23:41\n\nmidfielder Peter sweeney to sign for oxford united this week(5)(7)\n\n08 Jun 2011 16:23:19\n\nGLASGOW RANGERS TO SIGN MOST OFF THE SCOTTISH REFS AGAIN HAHAHA CELTIC(13)(6)\n\n08 Jun 2011 16:22:38\n\nath madrid are eyeing up a move for barce forward bojan after aguero moved a step closer to the exit door(7)(10)\n\n08 Jun 2011 16:21:40\n\nGLASGOW RANGERS CHAMPIONS\n\nC.ADAMS WANTS BACK TO JOIN THE REVOLOUTION AT IBROX SAYS HE DIDNT WANT TO LEAVE IN THE FIRST PLACE(10)(13)\n\n08 Jun 2011 16:19:37\n\nWatford owner Bassini has put the club back up for sale after realising that you need to BUY players and that you need MONEY to own a football club and make it successful.(3)(6)\n\n08 Jun 2011 16:20:00\n\nLuton (News) are interested in signing Dave Flett from York.
