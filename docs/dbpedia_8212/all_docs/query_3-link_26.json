It was found on the CPFC BBS (full thread here) and is, in short, on user's comparison of Bolton players to their counterparts at Crystal Palace. Basically, this is part of an ongoing internal debate amongst Palace fans that feel hard done, let down, or disappointed by Dougie Freedman's move to Bolton Wanderers.\n\nThis is the full list:\n\nBogdan, Adam Goalkeeper Speroni is better for me\n\nMears, Tyrone Defender Joel Ward, jury still out but wouldnt say Mears is better\n\nAlonso, Marcos Defender Jon Parr, International are far better\n\nMills, Matt Defender Paddy McCarthy, Mills very prone to mistakes, again for me Paddy the better defender\n\nReam, Tim Defender Damien Delaney, Delaney solid and consistent, Ream struggled to adapt to the game, so again Delaney wins for me\n\nEagles, Chris Midfielder Wilf Zaha, both players are probably the best players in their squad, but again Zaha so much better\n\nAndrews, Keith Midfielder Mile Jedinak, probably the toughest to separate, so call that a draw\n\nNgog, David Striker Probably compare him to Jermaine Easter, although N'Gog cost them Â£3 million virtually!\n\nPetrov, Martin Midfielder Andre Moritz, Given age and quality, Moritz better for me\n\nWylde, Gregg Defender Darcy Blake, again Blake the better, can play in a number of positions and solid.\n\nKnight, Zat Defender Peter Ramage, as we saw earlier in the season knight was run ragged by Zaha, so close one to call with these 2.\n\nDavies, Kevin Striker Glenn Murray, close again, but given ages, Glenn for me\n\nDavies, Mark Midfielder KG, possibly one where Mark Davies just egdes it.\n\nAfobe, Benik Striker only other striker we have is Wilbraham and completely different style of players.\n\nRicketts, Samuel Defender Dean Moxey, again for me better player\n\nSordell, Marvin Striker see Afobe\n\nSpearing, Jay Midfielder Owen Garvan, Spearing for me is awful so Owen wins\n\nPratley, Darren Midfielder Stuart O'Keefe, given the experience Pratley egdes this.\n\nHolden, Stuart Midfielder Jon Williams - no contest really, Willaims by far\n\nLonergan, Andy Goalkeeper Lewis Price, probably an even contest again\n\nVela, Joshua Midfielder David Wright,dont knoiw much about the Bolton player so hard to call\n\nLee, Chung-Yong Midfielder Yannick Bolasie, has impressed me since he joined, Lee apparently struggles with the tempo so Yannick for me.\n\nWheater, David Defender Danny Gabbidon, yet to see him play but from previous, Gabbidon far superior for me.\n\nThese are our highlights:\n\nJonathan Williams is better than Stuart Holden. Right. Maybe in the current state where one is injured but before Holden was hurt, he was one of the best central midfielders in the Premiership. Yes, Williams shows talent and a very bright future but to say that he's better than Stuart Holden is absolute madness.\n\nYannick Bolasie is better than Chung-Yong Lee. Excuse me for a second while I wipe off my monitor after spitting out my drink. Again, prior to getting hurt, Chung-Yong Lee was a world-beater and has not had much of a chance to find form since, having to sit on the sidelines under Owen Coyle. When he came on against Bristol City, he showed a lot of his old self and was instrumental in finding the game-winning goal.\n\nAndre Moritz is better than Martin Petrov. On his day (and the last two matches have been the definition of his day), Petrov is one of the better wingers in the league. He was barely given a chance under Owen Coyle and is now showing just how hungry (and good) he is with Jimmy Phillips in charge.\n\nDanny Gabbidon is \"far superior\" to David Wheater. Lolz. So many lolz. This is the Danny Gabbidon whose one contribution against Bolton in QPR's first match last year was an own goal. The same Danny Gabbidon that is eight years' Wheater's senior. I guess David's knee is still a bit crocked at the moment but at this point in time, I'd argue he'd put up a fight in his current state.\n\nDarcy Blake is better than Gregg Wylde. Who knows, this one might be true. Wylde is a completely unknown quantity in a Bolton uniform.\n\nOwen Garvan is better than Jay Spearing. \"Spearing for me is awful so Owen wins.\" Literally killing me. My goodness!\n\nThe list goes on and on. My glasses may be tinted a little bit white but at least they're not blocked out in red and blue like the poster's. My word, I had to cut myself off from getting carried away. What do you think though, are there any points that you agree with? Any that you find absolutely hilarious?"
