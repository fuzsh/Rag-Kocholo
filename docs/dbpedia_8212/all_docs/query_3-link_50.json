        "text": "Didier Drogba came off the bench to send Chelsea into the last 16 of the Champions League, his 71st-minute goal securing a 2-1 home victory over stubborn Romanians CFR Cluj in their final Group A match yesterday.\n\nBut in Rome, captain Francesco Totti was on target as Roma beat Girondins Bordeaux 2-0, sending the hosts into the last 16 as Group A winners and knocking the French club out.\n\nChelsea will have to settle for the runners-up spot.\n\nA second-half goal from Greece midfielder Giorgos Karagounis secured Panathinaikos a place in the knockout stages of the competition after a 1-0 win over Anorthosis Famagusta.\n\nVictory at the Olympic Stadium sent the Athens side through as winners of Group B on 10 points, two ahead of Inter who lost 2-1 at Werder Bremen.\n\nChelsea, last season's runners-up, went into the game needing victory to guarantee progress. They went ahead through Salomon Kalou five minutes before half-time but had a nervous spell after Yssouf Kone headed an equaliser 10 minutes after the restart.\n\nThere was relief all round though when Drogba, on as a 64th-minute substitute, produced a top-class finish after Joe Cole's clever through ball.\n\nAt the Olimpico, Roma midfielder Matteo Brighi controlled a low Simone Perrotta cross from the right and drove home to open the scoring just after the hour and Totti fired in from the edge of the box to seal victory in the 79th.\n\nThe visitors paid the price for being too timid for a side needing a win to progress.\n\nRoma have fought back from losing their opening game to CFR Cluj to top the group with 12 points, one more than Chelsea. Bordeaux finished third with seven and go through to the UEFA Cup.\n\nAnorthosis, who had needed to beat Panathinaikos to reach the knockout phase, finished bottom of the group.\n\nThe only goal of the game came in the 68th minute when Karagounis collected a cross from Dimitris Salpigidis and fired in a shot that squirmed over the body of substitute goalkeeper Zoltan Nagy.\n\nWerder Bremen bagged a place in the UEFA Cup knockout stages after Claudio Pizarro and Markus Rosenberg struck to seal victory over Inter.\n\nWerder deserved their win and finished third by leapfrogging Anorthosis. Inter, who had already qualified, must be content with ending up second after another lacklustre European performance.\n\nPizarro netted from close range on 63 minutes after a Julio Cesar parry and strike partner Rosenberg added a similar second nine minutes from time before substitute Zlatan Ibrahimovic blasted in a consolation for Inter.\n\n'Pool win group\n\nLiverpool cruised to a 3-1 win at PSV Eindhoven to finish top in Group D as Atletico Madrid were held to a goalless draw by Marseille.\n\nDanko Lazovic put PSV ahead nine minutes before the interval when he hit the net from close range after the Liverpool defence failed to clear a Balazs Dzsudzsak corner.\n\nLiverpool, without several key players, replied before the break with Ryan Babel heading home a free-kick from Lucas after David N'Gog had wasted a clear header seconds earlier.\n\nAlbert Riera handed the visitors the lead with a spectacular long drive 22 minutes before time and N'Gog sealed the victory after 77 minutes with his first goal for Liverpool.\n\nIn Spain, two goals from Olexandr Gladkiy and one from Fernandinho gave Shakhtar Donetsk a 3-2 win over a second-string Barcelona in a Group C match at the Nou Camp.\n\nBarcelona were already assured of first place in the group and rested eight first-choice players at a half-empty stadium. With Sporting also through in second, Shakhtar could not better third and will play in the UEFA Cup.\n\nForward Gladkiy put Shakhtar ahead on 31 minutes, side-footing Willian's pullback past Albert Jorquera in the home goal, and doubled the visitors' lead with 58 minutes gone.\n\nTheir two-goal advantage was short-lived as a minute later Sylvinho rifled a shot past Andriy Pyatov from the edge of the area before Fernandinho made it 3-1 and Sergio Busquets pulled one back with seven minutes left.\n\nSporting wrapped up a successful group-stage campaign with a largely meaningless 1-0 away win over hapless Swiss champions FC Basel.\n\nThe Lisbon side dominated the early exchanges and were rewarded with a well-worked goal from Yannick Djalo in the 19th minute.\n\nBasel, rooted to the bottom of Group C with one point from their previous five outings, came close to a freakish reply on the hour mark when Marco Carreira nearly diverted a hopeful Benjamin Huggel pass over his own goal-line.\n\nSubstitute Valentin Stocker then drew an impressive close-range save from reserve Sporting keeper Tiago during a frantic final flurry from the home side in an increasingly heavy snowstorm."
