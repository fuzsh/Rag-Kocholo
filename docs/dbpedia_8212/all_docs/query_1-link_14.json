Pooler could be back to nearer full strength in a fortnight, but meanwhile rest young lock Sam Pailor after U20 midweek duty.\n\nPooler give a debut to Michael Hook and a return to the club for Keith Stewart, both are replacements, while Llanelli have three new faces.\n\nFrench Sevens flyer Yannick N’Gog, on a three-week loan from Agen to the Scarlets, starts at left wing; exciting young prospect Scott Williams has a debut at centre and former Llandovery skipper Arwel Davies is on the bench.\n\nLlanelli: A Banfield; M Davies, S Williams, M Brayley, Y N’Gog; L Richards, J James; I Jones, C Hawkins (capt), S Gardner, A Powell, A Shingler, L Jones, D Godfrey, J Bater.\n\nPontypool: G Williams; N Preece, A Sclizney, J Leyshon, W Kershaw-Naylor; S Mills, C Morgan; A Williams, M Lewis, S Maguire, D Cox, D Critchley, R Bowen, A Brake, C Trayhern."
