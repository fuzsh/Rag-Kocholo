        "text": "Tries for centre Lifemi Mafi and Ireland scrum-half Tomas O'Leary (pictured) saw the Heineken Cup chamions take over from the Ospreys at the top of the table and lay down a statement of intent for their Celtic League ambitions.\n\nJames Hook kicked seven penalties for the Welsh side, but they could find no way past a determined Munster defence.\n\nPaul Warwick kicked two penalties for the Irish visitors, with O'Leary adding another.\n\nCeltic League\n\nRound-up: Blair blunder gives Cardiff Blues\n\n03/09/2009 at 12:05\n\nConnacht 14-17 Llanelli Scarlets\n\nStephen Jones overcame a stomach bug to fire the Llanelli Scarlets to a comeback win over Celtic League basement side Connacht at the Sportsground.\n\nThe illness meant Jones only trained on Thursday but with Morgan Stoddart suffering an injury the Wales fly-half came on as a half-time replacement.\n\nAnd the classy Jones managed to put his stamp on the game by converting Deacon Manu's try and adding the extra points to his own 74th minute touchdown as the Scarlets left Connacht stunned.\n\nConnacht's Ian Keatley had been winning his fly-half battle with Rhys Priestland, kicking two penalties and a drop goal and also racing through for a 46th minute try.\n\nBut the Ireland 'A' international also missed two kickable penalties and a conversion as Connacht's 14-3 lead was overhauled in the final quarter by the Jones-inspired visitors.\n\nAfter the wind-backed Scarlets established an early foothold in the hosts' half, Priestland converted a fifth-minute penalty for the lead score.\n\nBut Nigel Davies' men were lacking ideas and as the half progressed, Connacht swung possession in their favour.\n\nAfter a flat opening, Connacht sprung into life thanks to a 30-metre break from number eight Colm Rigney. That cameo and a brilliant turnover from captain John Muldoon helped set up Keatley's successful first penalty of the night.\n\nThe province's place-kicking hero against Munster, he added his second penalty on the half-hour mark before missing a much easier penalty attempt.\n\nBefore Keatley's miss, Niva Ta'auso barged through the visitors' midfield and into the 22 and the Samoan centre was then involved in setting up a late dart at the line for Fionn Carr.\n\nThe Scarlets also had a short spell of dominance before the break, gobbling up the yards before winger Darren Daniel was stopped five metres out.\n\nConnacht wasted little time in improving their 6-3 half-time lead. The second half was just six minutes' old when full-back Gavin Duffy sliced his way up to the Scarlets' 22, Mike McCarthy carried forward and then Keatley dummied and burst clear for a smartly-taken try.\n\nConnacht coach Michael Bradley called for his players to learn 'how to close out games' after losing at Leinster last week. When Keatley tagged on a drop goal for 14-3, they looked well set for the win.\n\nUnfortunately for the vocal home support, Connacht let their composure slip and with Priestland at full-back and Jones directing operations behind the pack, the Scarlets marched forward.\n\nFrank Murphy and McCarthy both made costly errors and after Jones kicked a penalty to touch, prop Manu muscled over the whitewash after a lineout catch and drive.\n\nEmptying their bench, the Scarlets introduced French recruit Yannick N'Gog and the fresh legs helped work Jones over for a crucial try. He nailed the conversion and Connacht's frustrations deepened when Keatley missed a subsequent penalty and a Duffy drop goal attempt sailed wide.\n\nEdinburgh 25-21 Ulster\n\nFly-half Phil Godman weighed in with 11 points from his boot for the Scots, while Ulster drew all of their points from penalties - with Ian Humphreys bagging four and Paddy Wallace one.\n\nGlasgow Warriors 20-25 Newport Dragons\n\nNewport belied their lowly league position as they beat Glasgow Warriors in a thrilling match which went right to the wire.\n\nThe visitors scored tries through James Arlidge, Rory Sidey, and Richard Fussell to earn a 22-11 lead with half an hour to go, but a string of penalties from Dan Parks got them to within striking distance.\n\nBut while the Warriors camped on the Dragons line in the last few minutes seeking a potentially match-winning converted try, the visitors' brave defence defied all the home side's attempts and the Welshmen finished off the victory.\n\nThe result moves the Dragons into eighth spot in the league, while Glasgow drop down to sixth.\n\nCeltic League\n\nNew signings to face Munster\n\n03/09/2009 at 11:48\n\nCeltic League\n\nVisser set for Edinburgh debut\n\n02/09/2009 at 10:20"
