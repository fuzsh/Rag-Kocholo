        "text": "Dundee United indicated they mean business as the summer transfer window opened and manager Csaba Laszlo appears to have been given funding designed to ensure they do not spend a fourth season in the Scottish Championship.\n\nThe Romania-born Hungarian has utilised his knowledge of football on the Continent to secure goalkeepers from the top flight in Switzerland and Czech Republic.\n\nHe also moved quickly to sign four players from their potential title rivals and that has been a theme of the summer, with players switching jerseys between Championship clubs.\n\nWillo Flood looked likely to be in opposition to United following his Tannadice release only to leave Dunfermline Athletic after just nine days, the Irish midfielder using a clause in his contract to take up a lucrative deal with Bali United in Indonesia instead.\n\nThe Pars' other headline-grabbing business was bringing the Longridge brothers together for the first time in their senior careers - forward Louis switching from Falkirk and his defender brother, Jackson, leaving promoted Livingston.\n\nLike the younger Longridge, midfielder Josh Mullin and centre-half Gregor Buchanan also turned down the chance to stay with the Premiership-bound West Lothian outfit, joining Ross County and Greenock Morton respectively.\n\nFalkirk manager Paul Hartley has shown his determination not to flirt with relegation again and among his signings are four players with international experience - Lithuanian striker Deimantas Petravicius, from Motherwell, Northern Ireland midfielder Paul Paton, previously of Plymouth Argyle, Cyprus midfielder Dimitris Froxylias, who left Dumbarton, and Scotland Under-21 midfielder Ruben Sammut on loan from Chelsea.\n\nPromoted part-timers Alloa Athletic have brought with them the second top scorer in League One last season - Alan Trouten from Albion Rovers - while Ayr United have kept faith with most of the squad that won the third tier."
