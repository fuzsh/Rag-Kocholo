        "text": "Dominik Szoboszlai is on the radar of Arsenal and Unai Emery this summer.\n\nfootball.london understand the Gunners have registered an interest in the 18-year-old as they hunt for a dynamic midfielder who can replace Aaron Ramsey, who officially becomes a Juventus player from July 1.\n\nDespite his relative low-key status the Hungary international has been compared to one of the finest midfielders in the world as well as another of European football's top talents.\n\n\"A lot of people say that my style of play is close to Sergej Milinkovic-Savic [of Lazio] and Toni Kroos [of Real Madrid],\" Szoboszlai told Goal . \"It is a great thing to hear that.\"\n\nBut what can Gunners fans realistically expect from the teenager should the club manage to pull of this Â£15m transfer in the coming months.\n\nTo find out the 18-year-old's strengths and weaknesses, football.londonspoke to Hungarian football expert Tom Mortimer.\n\nWhat are Szoboszlai's best qualities?\n\nWhen he is allowed space he can do anything. He has an outrageous shot with both feet - thunderbolts, curlers, chips - he can do it all.\n\nHe's also got lightning feet, a wonderful passing range, great vision, super intelligence.\n\nHe's the perfect playmaker or number eight. A little bit like a Paul Pogba-lite.\n\nWhat does Szoboszlai need to work on?\n\nThis is why he's a Pogba-lite, because he doesn't have Pogba's frame and that's his big problem - but at 18 playing in Austria for a dominant side like Red Bull Salzburg, what else would you expect?\n\nThat should come with time, so long as he's given it.\n\nHe's also not quite used to playing in super tight areas. Against Napoli in the Europa League, and Croatia and Wales in Euro qualifying, he was closed down a lot more than he was used to and therefore couldn't affect the game as much as he'd like, but that's again something that will surely come with time when he goes up the levels.\n\nBiggest weakness?\n\nHis physicality is probably his biggest weakness, and a loan move to a Championship club could swallow him.\n\nI'm very scared of him moving to England. Another one of Hungary's big talents, Krisztian Nemeth, moved to Liverpool as a much-touted youngster and never played a senior game for the club, unable to worm his way past the more physical David N'Gog.\n\nSzoboszlai isn't ready-made. He needs time to develop. I know Arsenal are a little different to the other top clubs in England but I still find it hard to trust them.\n\nKeep up to date with the latest Arsenal news, features and exclusives from football.london via our free WhatsApp service .\n\nClick here to enroll or text NEWS to 07557204612 and then add the number to your phone contacts book as arsenal dot london (case sensitive, with spaces) to receive daily updates and breaking news from Layth Yousif and the team on Arsenal."
