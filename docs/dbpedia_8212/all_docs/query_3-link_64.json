        "text": "James Milner's move from Aston Villa to Manchester City is a \"done deal\", but Martin O'Neill is holding out for at least £25m, The Independent on Sunday understands.\n\nAn impeccable source said that the Villa manager would hold out for every penny he could get for the England midfielder but that O'Neill would be interested in a player-plus-cash deal, with City's Stephen Ireland of particular interest.\n\nThe City centre-half Nedum Onuoha has also been linked with a switch to Villa Park as City's spending spree means academy products such as Ireland, Onuoha and Michael Johnson could be surplus to requirements.\n\nChelsea will start the defence of their Premier League title without Didier Drogba after he underwent groin surgery. He is expected to return to training just as the season starts, but the champions have what looks like a comfortable start to the campaign against West Bromwich, Wigan, Stoke and West Ham before their European adventure begins.\n\nOn the pitch yesterday Jermaine Beckford, brought in from Leeds, scored twice as Everton won 3-0 at the manager David Moyes's former club, Preston, with Louis Saha adding the other. Another new signing, Magaye Gueye, impressed in midfield.\n\nEverton's next pre-season outing is against the Championship side Norwich, who enjoyed a promising 2-1 home win over Newcastle United. Chris Martin claimed both their goals, with Xisco crossing for Shola Ameobi to score for the promoted Newcastle.\n\nTuncay Sanli scored a hat-trick in a 6-0 win for Stoke City as Tony Pulis sent out a strong team to build fitness in their traditional pre-season match at Newcastle Town.\n\nBirmingham City made it a hat-trick of wins on their tour of China when they won 2-0 in the final game against Liaoning. Garry O'Connor scored to give him a goal in each of the games.\n\nBrazil have named their new coach to rebuild the squad after their disappointing World Cup showing led to the sacking of Dunga. They chose the 48-year-old Corinthians coach Mano Menezes, a specialist in leading big clubs out of the doldrums who is little-known outside his own country.\n\nWhat's happening at your top-flight club?\n\nArsenal: Key signings: Marouane Chamakh (Bordeaux, free), Laurent Koscielny (Lorient, £10m).\n\nIn the pipeline: Mark Schwarzer, Loïc Rémy (Nice).\n\nWhat they need: A centre-back and a proven goalkeeper.\n\nAston Villa: Key signings: Martin O'Neill still to open the cheque book.\n\nIn the pipeline: Aiden McGeady, Robbie Keane.\n\nWhat they need: Additions to squad.\n\nBirmingham City: Key signings: Ben Foster (Man Utd, £6m), Nikola Zigic (Valencia, £6m).\n\nIn the pipeline: Moussa Dembélé (AZ Alkmaar), Charles N'Zogbia.\n\nWhat they need: An attacking midfielder to feed towering Zigic.\n\nBlackburn Rovers: Key signing:Hugo Fernandez (Union Deportivo).\n\nIn the pipeline: Guti, James Beattie.\n\nWhat they need: A centre-forward.\n\nBlackpool: Key signing: Dekel Keinan (Maccabi Haifa, free).\n\nIn the pipeline: Francis Jeffers, DJ Campbell.\n\nWhat they need: Experience.\n\nBolton Wanderers: Key signings: Martin Petrov (Man City) and Robbie Blake (Burnley, both free).\n\nIn the pipeline: Jack Wilshire (loan), David Nugent.\n\nWhat they need: A striker and a quality defender.\n\nChelsea: Key signings: Yossi Benayoun (Liverpool, £5.5m) and Matej Delac (Inter Zapresic, £2.7m).\n\nIn the pipeline: Ramires, David Luiz (both Benfica), Mesut Ozil (Werder Bremen).\n\nWhat they need: Exciting youngsters.\n\nEverton: Key signings: Jermaine Beckford (Leeds, free), Joao Silva (Desportivo Das Aves, undisclosed) and Magaye Gueye (Strasbourg, £900,000)\n\nIn the pipeline: Yannick Djalo (Sporting Lisbon), Nedum Onuoha.\n\nWhat they need: Landon Donovan.\n\nFulham: Key signings: Jonathan Greening (West Bromwich), Philippe Senderos (Arsenal, both free).\n\nIn the pipeline: Sven Goran Eriksson, Dave Jones.\n\nWhat they need: A new manager to buy a midfielder and a striker.\n\nLiverpool: Key signings: Joe Cole (below, free), Milan Jovanic (Standard Liège, free), Danny Wilson (Rangers, £5m).\n\nIn the pipeline: Wayne Bridge.\n\nWhat they need: A left-back and cover in midfield and attack.\n\nManchester City: Key signings: Yaya Touré (Barcelona, £28m), David Silva (Valencia, £25m), Jérôme Boateng (Hamburg, £11m), Aleksandar Kolarov (Lazio, £19m).\n\nIn the pipeline: James Milner, Mario Balotelli, Landon Donovan.\n\nWhat they need: A lethal finisher.\n\nManchester United: Key signings: Javier Hernandez (Chivas, £6m), Chris Smalling (Fulham, £10m).\n\nIn the pipeline: Steven Defour (Standard Liège), Mario Balotelli.\n\nWhat they need: A solid right-back.\n\nNewcastle United: Key signing: James Perch (Nottm Forest, £1.5m), Dan Gosling (Everton, free).\n\nIn the pipeline: Nicolas Otamendi (Velez Sarsfield).\n\nWhat they need: A couple of defenders and a striker.\n\nStoke City: Key signings: Florent Cuvelier (Portsmouth), Carlo Nash\n\nIn the pipeline: Mamadou Samassa (Marseille), Gary O'Neill.\n\nWhat they need: A quick forward and a tough-tackling midfielder.\n\nSunderland: Key signings: Cristian Riveros (Cruz Azul, undisclosed), Titus Bramble (Wigan, £1m), Marcos Angeleri (Estudiantes, undisclosed).\n\nIn the pipeline: Sol Campbell.\n\nWhat they need: Tough midfielder.\n\nTottenham Hotspur: Key signing: Sandro (Internacional, £6m).\n\nIn the pipeline: Klaas Jan Huntelaar, Craig Bellamy.\n\nWhat they need: A top midfielder.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion: Key signings: Steven Reid (Blackburn), Pablo Ibañez (Atletico Madrid, free), Gabriel Tamas (Auxerre, £800,000).\n\nIn the pipeline: David N'gog, James Beattie.\n\nWhat they need: About six players.\n\nWest Ham United: Key signings: Thomas Hitzlsperger (Lazio, free), Pablo Barrera (UNAM Pumas, £4m), Frédéric Piquonne (Lyon, £1m).\n\nIn the pipeline: Loïc Rémy (Nice), Chris Weale (Leicester).\n\nWhat they need: Full-backs, midfielders, back-up goalkeeper.\n\nWigan Athletic: Key signings: Mauro Boselli (Estudiantes, £6m), Antolin Alcaraz (Club Brugge, undisclosed), James McArthur (Hamilton, £500,000).\n\nIn the pipeline: Mikaël Silvestre.\n\nWhat they need: A goalscorer.\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers: Key signings: Steven Fletcher (Burnley, £6.5m), Stephen Hunt (Hull, £3m), Steven Mouyokolo (Hull, £2.5m), Jelle van Damme (Anderlecht, £2.5m).\n\nIn the pipeline: Benjani.\n\nWhat they need: A good midfielder."
