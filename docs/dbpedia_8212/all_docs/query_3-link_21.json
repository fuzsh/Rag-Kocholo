        "text": "Bolton striker David Ngog has emerged as a surprise target for Premier League Swansea City.\n\nThe former Liverpool star has scored three goals in his last four appearances for Wanderers – one of his most prolific spells since Owen Coyle paid £4million for his services.\n\nNgog is among six senior players out of contract at the end of the season. But as one of the club’s highest wage earners, Bolton would be unlikely to stand in his way now if Swansea offer a sensible deal.\n\nHowever, with top scorer Jermaine Beckford out of action until next month, manager Dougie Freedman would be short on forwards if he allowed Ngog to leave now.\n\nThe Trotters have been linked with former Swansea favourite, Danny Graham, currently on a season long loan to Hull from Sunderland.\n\nBut Graham, who cost the Black Cats £5m 12 months ago, is being tipped to join Bolton’s Championship rivals, Nottingham Forest.\n\nFreedman may have better luck with Luxembourg international, Yannick Bastos who is believed to be in England for talks.\n\nBastos, a right sided winger or midfielder, has had Europa League experience for his current club, FC Differdange.\n\n?Nicolas Anelka has called on the Football Association to drop its charge against him over his ‘quenelle’ goal celebration – but prospects of him citing a prominent French Jew in his defence were set back on Wednesday.\n\nWest Brom frontman Anelka is facing a minimum five-match ban, unless he can prove his case, after being charged by the FA with performing an alleged anti-Semitic gesture during his club’s match against West Ham on December 28.\n\nThe striker insists he is neither anti-Semitic nor racist. However Roger Cukierman, the president of CRIF (Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France), who initially appeared to have sided with the 34-year-old footballer, later said he considered Anelka’s behaviour “clearly suspect”.\n\nAnelka has until 6pm today to formally respond to the FA charge."
