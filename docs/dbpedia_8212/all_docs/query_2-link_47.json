Children are particularly vulnerable, especially as the coronavirus pandemic correlates with increased sharing of child sexual abuse images online, and we have an obligation to protect them.”\n\nCommissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, said: “Imagine as a child victim knowing the worst moment in your life is still circulating on the internet. Even worse, imagine that an opportunity to be saved from ongoing abuse was missed because tools had become illegal. Companies need to be able to report so that police can stop images circulating and even save children.”\n\nOver the last years, there has been a significant increase in child sexual abuse and exploitation cases and recently the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated the situation. Europol found that as Member States introduced lockdown and quarantine measures, the number of self-produced materials increased, while travel restrictions and other restrictive measures means that offenders increasingly exchange materials online.\n\nIn July, the Commission adopted a comprehensive EU strategy for a more effective fight against child sexual abuse. Under the Strategy, we proposed legislation to ensure that providers of online communications services can continue voluntary measures to detect child sexual abuse online.\n\nIn addition, Europol provides support to operations such as the recent action targeting child trafficking. The agency also monitors criminal trends in the Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA) and dedicated reports on the evolution of threats, including child sexual abuse, in the times of COVID-19.\n\nCHILD PROTECTION HUB\n\nThe Child Protection Hub promoted this year’s edition of the European Day on their website.\n\nCOUNCIL OF THE BALTIC SEA STATES (CBSS)\n\nCBSS prepared a video exchange between Ms Olivia Lind Haldorsson, Head of Children at Risk Unit, CBSS, and Ms Linda Jonsson, Competence Centre Coordinator, CBSS-Sweden, to mark the European Day.

They also watched a video shared by Father Cullen to illustrate the work of the Foundation.\n\nLANZAROTE COMMITTEE\n\nMs Christel De Craim, Chairperson of the Lanzarote Committee\n\nAll it takes is a second to click and send self-generated sexual images and/or videos of yourself. Take a step back and ask yourself 3 questions:\n\n→ Do you really know that person and truly trust him or her?\n\n→ Are you really ready to expose yourself in this way?\n\n→ Is this really a private conversation?\n\nThese important questions require a bit more than a second of reflection but can make a world of difference in the end.\n\nA growing number of children and teenagers express their feelings through social media and information and communication technology (ICT) devices. The Covid-19 pandemic has increased this trend.\n\nAlthough social media and ICT devices are an easy and practical way of connecting and getting in touch with others, there is also a downside to their use. We must not be blind to the risks children may face while using them.\n\nThe Explanatory Report of the Convention on the protection of children against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse (the Lanzarote Convention) states that it is not the intention of [the] Convention to criminalise sexual activities of young adolescents who are discovering their sexuality and engaging in sexual experiences with each other in the framework of sexual development.\n\nBut the Convention makes it also very clear that all necessary legislative and other measures to prevent all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children and to protect them should be taken.\n\nThis is why the Committee of the Parties to the Lanzarote Convention, the Lanzarote Committee, which I chair, is currently finalising its monitoring work on the way States implement the Convention when dealing with this issue of child self-generated sexual images and/or videos.\n\nAlthough children have the right to experiment and discover their sexuality, including through the use of social media and ICT devices, they, however, also have the right to receive guidance.\n\nWe all can be that guide for our children, not only by providing sexual education, but by giving them the opportunity and space to talk about their feelings. Being a guide means also to warn them for the of the risks they take when they are on a discovery journey and are using social media and ICT devices. If children refuse us - a parent, a teacher, a caregiver – as their guide, even then we can do something: we can show them the way to other trustworthy persons, helplines, chats….\n\nTherefore, I very welcome the 2020 edition of the European Day on “Preventing risky behaviour by children: child self-generated sexual images and/or videos”.\n\nSTEERING COMMITTEE FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD (CDENF)\n\nMs Maria-Andriani Kostopoulou, Chairperson of the CDENF\n\nToday, 18 November 2020, we are marking the sixth edition of the European Day on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, which was initiated by the Council of Europe in 2015.\n\nThis year, the European Day focuses on “Preventing risky behaviour by children: child self-generated sexual images and/or videos”.\n\nIn my capacity as Chairperson of the Steering Committee for the Rights of the Child (CDENF), I would like to emphasise our commitment to finding the right solutions to strengthen prevention of all forms of violence, which is a clear objective of CDENF’s mandate 2020-2021. Already in 2017-2018, the Council of Europe delivered the Committee of Ministers Recommendation CM/Rec(2018)7 on Guidelines to protect, respect and fulfil the rights of the child in the digital environment which includes a set of concrete measures that states should take to protect children.\n\nSince then, several tools have complemented this comprehensive legal instrument:\n\na child-friendly version of the Recommendation entitled “Learn about your rights in the digital environment”, because children also need child-friendly information on these matters;\n\na new Guide on Parenting in the digital age, because parents also need to know how to guide their children through the digital world;\n\na Handbook for policy makers, which includes useful tips and checklists for any professional working in this area and promoting the rights of the child in their professional context.\n\nThe CDENF is currently working more specifically towards appropriate responses to “harmful sexual behaviour by children” through its working group on responses to violence against children. This work takes into account the recommendations of the Lanzarote Committee in 2019 underlining that children should not be referred to judicial prosecution but to the victim support system.\n\nThe issue of self-generated images by children is a challenge that should be urgently addressed, especially as the risks of sexual exploitation and abuse have increased in the context of the lockdowns and isolation of children during the pandemic, with an increased focus on child friendly responses and through prevention, education and awareness raising. This requires also stepping up of the role of the education system and to ensure that education curricula have comprehensive sex and relationship education. This is yet another gap that could be addressed through the various mechanisms of the Council of Europe in the upcoming Council of Europe Strategy for the Rights of the Child, to be launched in 2022.\n\nPARLIAMENTARY ASSEMBLY\n\nSub-Committee on Children\n\nThe Sub-Committee on Children of the Committee on Social Affairs, Health and Sustainable Development organised a hearing of experts on 10 November 2020, as a Parliamentary Assembly contribution to the European Day on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (18 November). On this occasion, participants discussed the protection of children against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse facilitated by information and communication technologies (ICTs): Addressing the challenges raised by child self-generated sexual images and/or videos, in the presence of:\n\nMr Matthew B. Ezzell, Board Member, Culture Reframed\n\nMr Anton Toni Klančnik, EUROPOL - O3 European Cyber Crime Centre (EC3)\n\nMr Dimitri Houbron, Parliamentary Assembly Rapporteur on “For an assessment of the means and provisions to combat children's exposure to pornographic content”\n\nThe Sub-Committee on Children also published a list of helplines in Europe where children who are experiencing problems related to their self-generated sexual images and/or videos can seek advice and assistance.\n\nJoint statement\n\nBaroness Doreen E. Massey (United Kingdom, SOC), PACE Rapporteur on “Addressing sexual violence against children: stepping up action and co-operation in Europe”, and Mr Dimitri Houbron (France, ALDE), PACE Rapporteur on “For an assessment of the means and provisions to combat children's exposure to pornographic content” issued a joint statement on the occasion of the European Day.\n\nEndOCSEA@Europe PROJECT\n\nA webinar on “Educational measures to prevent risks associated with child self-generated sexual images/videos” was organised on 12 November 2020 in the context of the EndOCSEA@Europe project, with Ms Dunja Mijatović, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, and Ms Christel De Craim, Chairperson of the Lanzarote Committee, as key speakers.\n\nCHILDREN’S RIGHTS DIVISION"
