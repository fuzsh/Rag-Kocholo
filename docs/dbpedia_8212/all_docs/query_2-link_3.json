        "text": "Commune in Île-de-France, France\n\nSceaux (French pronunciation: [so] ⓘ) is a commune in the Hauts-de-Seine department in the southern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located 9.7 km (6.0 mi) from the centre of Paris. In 2019, Sceaux had a population of 20,004. Sceaux is one of the most affluent areas of France and is known for its very high housing costs.\n\nA wealthy city\n\n[edit]\n\nSceaux is famous for the Château de Sceaux, set in its large park (Parc départemental de Sceaux), designed by André Le Nôtre, measuring 2 km2 (0.77 sq mi). The original château was transformed into a School of Agriculture during the Revolution and lost much of its luster. It was demolished at the beginning of the 19th century following its sale by the then French government. Sceaux castle was originally built by Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the minister of finance to Louis XIV and purchased by Louis' illegitimate son, the Duke of Maine in 1699. His duchesse held court in a glittering salon at Sceaux in the first decades of the eighteenth century.\n\nThe present-day château, rebuilt between 1856 and 1862 in a Louis XIII style, is now the museum of Île-de-France open for visits.\n\nHousing costs in the area are very high, higher than in many districts of the Paris area, especially with streets facing the Parc de Sceaux.\n\nTransport\n\n[edit]\n\nSceaux is served by three stations on Paris RER line B: Sceaux, Robinson, and Parc de Sceaux. The latter station is located at the border between the commune of Sceaux and the commune of Antony, on the Antony side of the border. It is also close to Paris-Orly Airport.\n\nSceaux is connected to the A86 motorway that circles around Paris. The commune also offers a developed network of buses which are often used by the Scéens (the name given to the residents of Sceaux).\n\nPopulation\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population\n\nYearPop.±% p.a.1793 1,865— 1800 1,403−3.98%1806 1,569+1.88%1821 1,340−1.05%1831 1,433+0.67%1836 1,670+3.11%1841 1,844+2.00%1846 2,023+1.87%1851 2,035+0.12%1856 2,133+0.95%1861 2,267+1.23%1866 2,578+2.60%1872 2,287−1.98%1876 2,460+1.84%1881 2,783+2.50%1886 3,443+4.35%1891 3,567+0.71%1896 3,926+1.94%\n\nYearPop.±% p.a.1901 4,541+2.95%1906 4,857+1.35%1911 5,532+2.64%1921 6,207+1.16%1926 6,995+2.42%1931 7,840+2.31%1936 8,418+1.43%1946 8,448+0.04%1954 10,601+2.88%1962 19,024+7.58%1968 19,913+0.76%1975 19,709−0.15%1982 18,317−1.04%1990 18,052−0.18%1999 19,494+0.86%2007 19,679+0.12%2012 19,986+0.31%2017 19,344−0.65%\n\nSource: EHESS[3] and INSEE (1968-2017)[4]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nPrimary and secondary schools\n\n[edit]\n\nThe commune has the following primary schools:[5]\n\nPublic preschools/nurseries (maternelles): des Blagis, du Centre, Clos-Saint-Marcel, du Petit-Chambord\n\nPublic elementary schools: des Blagis, du Centre, Clos-Saint-Marcel\n\nOne private preschool and elementary school: Écoles maternelle et élémentaire Sainte-Jeanne-d'Arc\n\nSceaux hosts two cités scolaires, combined junior high schools and public high schools/sixth-form colleges, the lycée Marie Curie and the lycée Lakanal.[6] The lycée Marie Curie was named after the famous scientist who was married in, lived in, and was originally interred in Sceaux with her husband Pierre Curie.

Its main event is the Spring dance festival with an international program of the highest quality.\n\nThe commune also has a small movie theatre, the Trianon, where international movies are released in their respective language and subtitled in French. The theater is also known for showing independent films and hosting special events.\n\nVarious music events take place at Sceaux. The classical music festival established by Alfred Loewenguth in 1969, the Festival de l'Orangerie, takes place in the Orangery[8] built by Jules Hardouin-Mansart for the Marquis de Seignelay in 1686, in the Park at Sceaux.[9] The Park also houses an open air opera every summer at the end of June.\n\nThe Parc de Sceaux was the location of Madonna's Parisian first visit with her Who's That Girl World Tour 29 August 1987, front 131,000 people, the largest crowd of any concert in French history.[10][11]\n\nIn the classic French O-Level textbook series for English-speaking pupils, Le Francais d'Aujourd-hui, the Bertillon family move out to Sceaux from inner-city Paris during the course of the book's main narrative.\n\nNotable person\n\n[edit]\n\nThe mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy died in Sceaux in 1857.\n\nAlain Delon actor, singer, filmmaker, and businessman, born in Sceaux in 1935\n\nWildlife\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Parc de Sceaux is home to a population of red squirrels estimated to number between 100 and 120.[12]\n\nTwin towns\n\n[edit]\n\nRoyal Leamington Spa (United Kingdom)\n\nBrühl (Germany)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCommunes of the Hauts-de-Seine department\n\nLigne de Sceaux\n\nThe works of Maxime Real del Sarte\n\nList of tourist attractions in Paris\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
