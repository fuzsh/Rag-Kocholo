        "text": "LEAGUE leaders hammered the basement club with seven tries at Parc-y-Scarlets, putting on a fine performance and showing that they had spent their time profitably during the recent shut-down.\n\nThe home side were in front from the fifth minute when a Pooler chip ahead fell into the arms of Craig Hawkins for the skipper to go over untouched.\n\nA massive overlap of five to two produced a second touchdown, Andrew Banfield racing over.\n\nBest response came from full back Gareth Williams, whose long run out of defence created field position for Sam Mills to open the Pontypool account with a penalty.\n\nA superb inside flick from Andrew Brayley put Luke Richards in for a third Llanelli try just before the interval, giving them a 20-3 lead.\n\nYannick N’gog excited the crowd, packed into the west stand, with a tremendous burst down the touchline on the restart. Llanelli kept possession and Banfield went over for the second time.\n\nScott Williams marked his initial game for the club with a fine solo try and he was followed to the line by N’gog, another first time scorer.\n\nFollowing good work from Cae Trayhern, replacement Nicky Coughlin crossed for a consolation try for Pontypool.\n\nLlanelli: Tries – A Banfield (2), C Hawkins, L Richards, S Williams, Y N’gog, S Hopkins; cons – L Richards (4); pen – Richards\n\nPontypool: Try – N Coughlin; pen – S Mills"
