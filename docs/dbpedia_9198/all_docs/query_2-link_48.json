The project was conceived of in 1954 when local, state and Federal governments were considering building in Boston. Under Mayor Kevin H. White, the original vision was for close to thirty new buildings over 60 acres in the downtown region, at a cost of $260 million. The BRA hoped that local, state, and Federal investment in the area would go on to promote private investment. The area selected for the project had been known as Scollay Square, a squalid retail and entertainment district that was home to burlesque houses and dive bars. When the project began, fifty acres in the heart of the city were cleared completely to make way for the new structures that were meant to rejuvenate the city morally and economically.\n\nDesign brief: The master plan for Government Center was the work of I.M. Pei and Partners, while the designs for the City Hall building and plaza were the work of the architecture firm of Kallmann, McKinnell and Knowles, who won the national design competition in 1962.\n\nSignificant Alteration(s) with Date(s)\n\ntype of change: Interior conversion of gallery and reception room on the 5th floor to office space\n\ndate: (c)1983\n\ncircumstances/reasons for change: The gallery was converted to office space to make room for the City Council which had expanded\n\nfrom nine to thirteen members.\n\ntype of change: Plaza fountain covered with concrete slab platform.\n\ndate: (c) May 2006\n\ncircumstances/reasons for change: The fountain had not been functioning properly for decades so the City opted to cover the fountain to create a new venue for public gatherings and events.\n\npersons/organizations involved: MBTA\n\nCurrent Use\n\nMayor’s Office, City Council Chambers, city agencies\n\nGeneral Description\n\nThe City Hall Building is a 9-story pre-cast concrete and brick structure that is roughly rectangular in plan of an inverted pyramidal shape\n\nwith an interior light court. The lower 4 floors are of red brick and the upper five floors are pre-cast concrete. The design is said to have been inspired by/modeled after Le Corbusier’s Convent of La Tourette. The City Hall architects used the massing and materials to delineate the building’s different parts and uses. The brick base contains the offices of ordinary use (taxes, permits, etc.), while the middle floors, housing the offices of elected officials, are distinguished by their monumental scale, placement of windows, and projecting volumes. Finally, the upper floors of administrative and planning departments are designed in a more ordinary fashion with more regular, repetitive window placement. The building is set in a gently sloping nine-acre brick plaza defined by geometrically arranged tree plantings. The plaza originally contained a fountain but after chronic mechanical problems it was covered with a concrete slab in spring 2006 to create a venue for public gatherings and events.\n\nConstruction Period\n\nPre-cast concrete\n\nOriginal Physical Context\n\nNames of surrounding buildings: Government Center/City Hall Plaza including the John F. Kennedy Federal Office Building, State\n\nHealth, Education &amp. Welfare Services Center, One Center Plaza and the Government Center Garage\n\nCurrently, Mayor Thomas Menino is reconsidering his plans to raze the City Hall Building and/or sell the site to real estate developers and\n\nmove the city’s offices to a site on the South Boston waterfront.\n\nTechnical\n\nThe City Hall building in Boston has been heralded as a landmark of 1960’s Brutalism. Heavily influenced by Le Corbusier, Brutalism was\n\nall about the use of raw concrete with rough blocky forms and repeated angular geometries. The idea of Brutalism is that the form,\n\nappearance and engineering of a building should “accurately reflect the advantages and drawbacks of the material.” The bulky mass and strong angular geometries of City Hall reveal this. Another aspect of the style was the exposition of the building’s functions. As discussed in section 3.1, the different portions of the building are reflected by the various levels of projection an organization of materials on the exterior.\n\nSocial\n\nThe social importance of City Hall is found not only in the fact that the building itself was a symbol of the City, but that it was supposed to represent a new era of economic rebirth for Boston. The City Hall building was part of a federally funded urban renewal effort that took place in Boston during the sixties. The site, the former Scollay Square, was an unsavory area that planners hoped to rejuvenate with the new Government Center project. The insertion of the very modern Brutalist structure showed that the City was moving forward, as it was chosen in part because it resembled no other city hall in America. The bold design showed that the city was confident in their new project and ability to prosper, and was intended to promote private investment in the area.\n\nCultural & Aesthetic\n\nMayor Menino may wish to disagree, but there is no denying that City Hall has canonic value in the narrative of modern architecture. The year City Hall was completed it won the AIA Honor Award for Architecture. In 1971, the AIA voted City Hall the 7th best building in the history of the United States. Most discussions of mid-20th century modern architecture, and nearly all on Brutalism, site City Hall as an important example of such work.\n\nCity Hall has proved to be a bit of a conundrum in the world of architecture. While the average person may have difficulty understanding it, and it seems to be the general consensus in Boston that the structure is aestheticly unpleasing, there is a certain value behind its design. One cannot deny that City Hall shows the values inherent in Brutalism, with direct ties to Le Corbusier. Its heaviness and angularity convey a sense of solidity and permanence, even if the mayor is trying to raze it. The inverted pyramidal shape draws the eye down, while the eye is busied with the patterns of windows and structural projections of concrete. The plaza, however, has had more issues functionally that aesthetically. The paved brick plaza, with its somewhat awkward changes in grade that create problems for pedestrian flow, has long been a thorn in the city’s side. Several design changes have been proposed to rejuvenate the area, with the most recent change being the concrete slab that was placed over the old fountain.\n\nGeneral Assessment\n\nCity Hall has very strong reference value in the scope of modern and Brutalist architecture. The singe most important reference it makes is to Le Corbusier’s Convent of La Tourette, Lyon, France, 1960. Le Corbusier was the inspiration for most early works of Brutalism. The name itself comes from a French term béton brut, meaning &quot.raw concrete,\" that Corbusier used in describing his choice of building material. Both structures have an upper massing with repeated fenestration, midsections broken up by irregular projections and window arrangements, and finally bases with strong verticals."
