        "text": "Getting Around\n\nBoston is a friendly, walkable city with a great public transportation system known as the T (MBTA). All of Boston's downtown areas and neighborhoods are accessible by train, bus, trolley, or water transportation. If you're new to the city, we've assembled some information to guide you whether you're walking, taking the T, riding a bike, or driving and parking a car.\n\nWalking\n\nChances are you’ve heard Boston referred to as “the walking city.” The City of Boston works hard to live up to this title. Our Public Works and Transportation Departments are constantly marking crosswalks, performing regular maintenance of traffic signals and pedestrian pushbuttons, and using innovative pedestrian safety signs at busy locations such as downtown Boston. Schools, parks, playgrounds, elderly complexes, and public libraries are also a top priority for these new safety improvements.\n\nBicycling\n\nBoston Bikes is part of our vision for a vibrant and healthy city. The program seeks to make Boston a world-class biking city by creating safe and inviting conditions for all residents and visitors. Boston Bikes is focused on five planning areas: engineering, enforcement, education, encouragement, and evaluation.\n\nDriving\n\nBoston has developed a reputation for having savvy drivers who are able to navigate the city’s historic cobblestone streets with ease. Many of Boston’s streets were once horse-cart paths and today present a challenge for drivers in those ubiquitous SUV’s. Parking can be difficult but with services such as vanpools and car-sharing companies, it is possible to navigate the city capably.\n\nSubway / Bus / Commuter Rail\n\nThousands of residents and visitors use the extensive MBTA system of trains and buses to get in and around Boston. Over 300,000 people commute into Boston daily for work. Public transportation via bus, subway, and commuter train serves as a vital link between Downtown and surrounding neighborhoods and the greater Metro-Boston area."
