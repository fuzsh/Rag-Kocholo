        "text": "John Hancock, 1765 (John Singleton Copley)\n\nThe Selectmen were responsible for calling Town Meetings, at which all those who were eligible to vote would discuss and vote on issues relating to the governance of the town. Initially elected to six-month terms, they would later serve one-year terms.\n\nRecords of the first four years of the Selectmen’s meetings are lost. As a result, we do not know who the selectmen were, when the town meetings took place, or what business was taken up when they were held from 1630 until the earliest recorded meeting on September 11, 1634.\n\nDuring the Siege of Boston from April 19, 1775 to March 17, 1776, the Board of Selectmen was officially disbanded due to British military forces seizing control of the local government (although Boston Town Meetings were held in nearby Watertown.) While there are Town Records covering that time, there are no Selectmen’s Records.\n\nAmong the notable men to serve on the Board of Selectmen were:\n\nJohn Winthrop (1634, 1639)- four time Governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony\n\nThomas Brattle (1671-1683)- prominent local merchant, treasurer of Harvard College, and co-founder of the Brattle Street Church\n\nJohn Hancock (1765-1774)- Founding Father, two time Governor of Massachusetts\n\nJohn Rowe (1767-1769) - Merchant and real estate developer, namesake of Rowe's Wharf\n\nCharles Bulfinch (1791-1794, 1799-1817) - Important early American architect, designed many landmark buildings including the current Massachusetts State House and the U.S. Capitol\n\nLemuel Shattuck\n\nIn 1822, the Board of Aldermen consisted of 8 at-large members, and the Common Council was made up of 48 members elected by ward. Members of each group served one-year terms. Administration of the city was vested primarily with the Mayor and the Aldermen, with the Mayor serving as the Chairman of the Board of Aldermen until 1855, when the passage of An Act To Revise The Charter Of The City Of Boston created a separate chairman and vested more authority with the Board of Aldermen.\n\nThe make-up of the Board of Aldermen and Common Council was changed many times during the nearly nine decades of their existence. By 1909, the Board of Aldermen consisted of 4 at-large members and the Common Council consisted of 34 members elected by ward.\n\nAmong the notable men to serve on the Common Council are:\n\nJonathan Chapman (1836-1839)- 8th Mayor of Boston\n\nLemuel Shattuck (1838-1841)- Co-founder of the New England Historic Genealogical Society, advocate for public health improvements, namesake of Lemuel Shattuck Hospital in Jamaica Plain\n\nAlexander H. Rice (1853-1855)- 15th Mayor of Boston, Congressman, 30th Governor of Massachusetts\n\nGeorge Lewis Ruffin (1876-1877) - first African American to serve on City Council and first African American judge in U.S.\n\nJohn F. Fitzgerald (1891-1892) - Two time Mayor, Congressman, maternal grandfather of President John F. Kennedy\n\nWhen it was created in 1909, the City Council served three-year terms and consisted of 9 at-large members and retained many of the same powers as the Board of Aldermen with the added authority to create departments and committees to oversee various aspects of city governance. The make-up of the City Council was changed several times to include various numbers of at-large members and members elected by district. The City Council now serves two-year terms and consists of 4 at-large members and 9 elected by council district.\n\nAnother holdover from the Board of Aldermen was a chairperson, in this case called the Council President. The Council President calls special meetings, presides over meetings and votes, and can serve as Acting Mayor in cases where the Mayor resigns or is otherwise unable to carry out the duties of the office. The most notable instance of this happening was when Mayor Ray Flynn resigned after being appointed Ambassador to the Holy See in 1993. Council President Thomas Menino served as Acting Mayor before winning his first of five election victories.\n\nSome other notable past Council members are:\n\nJames M. Curley (1900)- four time Mayor of Boston, Congressman, 53rd Governor of Massachusetts\n\nMildred Harris (1937-1939)- first woman elected to City Council (1937)\n\nKatherine Craven (1964-1967)- first woman elected as at-large Councilor (1964)\n\nLouise Day Hicks (1970-1971, 1974-1977, 1979) - first woman Council President (1976), Congresswoman, known for crusade against desegregation of Boston Public Schools\n\nBruce Bolling (1982-1983, 1986-1993)- first African American Council President (1986-1987)\n\nMayor Curley takes zebra from circus to zoo\n\nAfter becoming a city in 1822, Boston adopted a mayor-council form of government. Mayors would initially serve terms only one year in length. The current four-year term was adopted in 1909, after a major overhaul of the city charter. Much of the authority of governance was vested either solely with the Aldermen or with the Mayor and the Aldermen. It was not until 1885 that more authority would be vested solely with the Mayor, with some actions still subject to the approval of the Aldermen.\n\nMayoral elections are non-partisan, like all municipal elections in Boston. The two highest vote-getters in the Mayoral primary, irrespective of political parties, go on to the general election. Every Mayoral election since 1930 has been won by a Democrat.\n\nA few of the notable Mayors of Boston are:\n\nJohn Phillips (1822-1823)- first Mayor, served one term\n\nAlexander H. Rice (1856-1858)- co-founder of Republican Party\n\nHugh O'Brien (1885-1889)- first Irish and first Catholic Mayor\n\nJohn F. \"Honey Fitz\" Fitzgerald (1906-1908, 1910-1914)- first Mayor to serve four-year term, State Senator, Congressman, maternal grandfather of President John F. Kennedy and Senator Ted Kennedy\n\nJames M. Curley (1914-1918, 1922-1926, 1930-1934, 1946-1950)- Congressman, one-term Governor of Massachusetts, served part of last term while in jail on mail fraud charges\n\nMaurice J. Tobin (1938-1945)- one-term Governor of Massachusetts, U.S. Secretary of Labor, namesake of Tobin Bridge\n\nJohn B. Hynes(1950-1960)- Acting Mayor during Curley's time in jail, oversaw numerous development projects, namesake of Hynes Convention Center\n\nKim Janey (March 22, 2021-November 16, 2021)- Acting Mayor, first woman and person of color to serve as Mayor\n\nMichelle Wu (November 16, 2021-present)- First woman and person of color to be elected Mayor\n\nCurrently Living Former Mayors: 1 (Raymond Flynn)\n\nMost terms served: Frederic W.

Eight elections were held for Mayor due to the lack of a clear winner before Davis finally won. He attempted to resign in October due to poor health, but his resignation was not accepted. He was 47 years old.\n\nPatrick Collins- Mayor from January 7, 1902 to September 13, 1905. Died suddenly at age 61.
