        "text": "Boston is a fantastic city with lots to offer. It has lots of history, beautiful architecture, plenty of outdoor activities and some of the greatest restaurants in the world. It’s very easy to get around the city by foot and taking public transportation. That said, if you’re able to take the T to and from work and have a supermarket within walking distance of where you live, you probably won’t need to own a car. Traffic in Boston is heavy, especially during rush hour, and parking can be very expensive and hard to come by. Boston also has a ton of beautiful parks. While it may lack some vibrancy compared to cities such as NYC and Chicago, it still offers plenty of nightlife and entertainment. Overall, Boston can be a great city for young professionals, families and even retirees. It definitely offers a slower pace compared to NYC, but you won’t be bored in Boston either. If you can afford living in Boston, I strongly recommend it!"
