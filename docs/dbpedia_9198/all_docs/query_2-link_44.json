        "text": "Boston owes more than it owns. Boston's Taxpayer Burden™ is -$7,800, and it received a \"D\" from TIA. Boston is a Sinkhole City without enough assets to cover its debt. Decisions by elected officials have created a Taxpayer Burden™, which is each taxpayer's share of city bills after its available assets have been tapped. TIA's Taxpayer Burden™ measurement incorporates all assets and liabilities, including retirement obligations. Boston only has $5.2 billion of assets available to pay bills totaling $7.2 billion. Because Boston doesn't have enough money to pay its bills, it has a -$2 billion financial hole. To erase this shortfall, each Boston taxpayer would have to send -$7,800 to the city. Boston's reported net position is understated by $67,000, largely because the city defers recognizing gains resulting from decreases in retirement liabilities."
