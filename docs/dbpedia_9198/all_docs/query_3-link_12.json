        "text": "Boston’s Top 7 Historical Sites & Landmarks\n\nBoston’s history stretches back to 1630 when Puritans settled the Shawmut Peninsula and named it after their hometown in Lincolnshire, England. Boston soon became one of the most important hubs of commerce in the New World. Dissatisfied as subjects of the King of England, the city’s patriots led the colonists’ demands for self-rule and independence. King George III was not happy. We all know the story; if you don’t, here’s your chance.\n\nThis, the Cradle of Democracy, is a city with a wealth of history and a reputation for innovation and tenacity. Read on to discover some of the most popular historical landmarks in Boston.\n\n1. The Boston Common and Boston Public Garden\n\nbatt dates back to 1634, making it the oldest public park in the US. For nearly 400 years, the Common has been witness to grazing livestock, British encampments, abolitionist gatherings, speeches, food riots, concerts, militia mustering, protests, ice skating, ball games, and public executions. Throughout the Common there are sites of interest and historical significance, identified with markers.\n\n2. Black Heritage Trail/Boston African American National Historic Site Massachusetts\n\nOff-season, self-guided tours are powered by the National Park Service’s app. Many of the points of interest along the trail are private property, however there are a few that are open to the public. One of those is the First African Baptist Church, built in 1806; located on Smith Court, It's also known as the African Meeting House. The Freedom Trail speaks to the historic, heroic, and innovative contributions of Boston’s Black community.\n\n3. The Freedom Trail\n\nThis 2.5 mile stroll with easy terrain starts at the Boston Common, winds through the historic North End, and ends at the Bunker Hill Memorial in Charlestown. Along the Trail are 16 significant historical sites, including museums, meeting houses, and a ship.\n\n4. Paul Revere House\n\nBorn and raised in the North End, Revere was a silversmith, illustrator, dentist, and industrialist. And a court-martialed field commander. Who knew? Despite several renovations over the past few centuries, much of the original 17th-century architecture remains intact.\n\n5. Faneuil Hall\n\nBuilt in 1742, this building was a gift to the city from merchant Peter Faneuil. While it’s now a galleria-type market, it was originally used for meetings, commerce, public speeches, and rabble rousing by the likes of Sam Adams.\n\n6. Charlestown Navy Yard\n\nNow a National Park, this shipyard operated for 174 years and was, for more than a century, considered one of the most important maritime hubs in the world. The USS Constitution Museum is located at the site, as well as a superb Visitor’s Center. Also known as “Old Ironsides,” the USS Constitution is the oldest commissioned warship on the water. Built in 1797, the frigate earned her nickname and sealed her reputation in the War of 1812. The USS Cassin Young, a more modern Fletcher-class destroyer, also calls the Charlestown Navy Yard home. Naval and maritime history will come alive for NUBS and old salts alike!\n\n7. The Boston Harborwalk\n\nThe decades-long, ongoing rejuvenation of the Boston Waterfront has been a partnership between businesses, nonprofits and government agencies. This community collaboration has restored Boston Harbor's waterfront to the people of the city, the state, and to the millions of visitors who come from around the world to see New England's most historic waterfront."
