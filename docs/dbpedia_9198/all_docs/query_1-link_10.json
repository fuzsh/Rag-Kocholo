        "text": "Our Process\n\nTiming\n\nInitial fittings can take 30 to 60 minutes depending on how many questions you have and how many items you're interested in.\n\nGroundwork\n\nWe’ll pour you a beverage and learn a little bit about you. What’s the office dress code? What’s missing from your wardrobe?\n\nSizing\n\nWe’ll go through an in-depth fitting to take measurements and learn your fit preferences. We want you to look great and feel comfortable.\n\nCustomizing\n\nCutaway or button-down collar? French cuffs or single button? “Not sure” works as an answer too—that’s what we’re here for.\n\nTurnaround Time\n\nGood things take time, including the hand-crafted construction of your Blank Label clothes.\n\nShirts: 3-4 weeks after placing your order\n\nSuits & Pants: 4-5 weeks after placing your order\n\nHowever, be sure to check the estimated delivery date in your cart, as turnaround times can fluctuate with demand, holidays, and seasonality. This represents the most up to date timeline information.\n\nAlterations\n\nOur job isn't over until you're satisfied. That’s why we schedule an appointment for you to try on your new clothes and determine if any alterations are needed.\n\nDon’t worry, the alteration on your first garment is complimentary.\n\nIt’s important to note that alterations will add an additional 2-3 weeks to your order timeline. But when you get your perfect fit, it’ll be worth it."
