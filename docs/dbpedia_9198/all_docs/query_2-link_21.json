        "text": "A Brief History of Boston, Massachusetts\n\nBoston, MA, is one of the oldest cities in the United States of America. It possesses a rich history and holds deep, cultural significance for many Americans.\n\nA City Rich in History & Cultural Impact\n\nBoston has a long and rich history, with its origins dating back to the XVII century when it was established. It is one of the oldest cities in America, making it an important center for culture, commerce, and education. Here we will explore how old Boston is, when was Boston founded, and how the city got its start. By delving into Boston history, we can better understand the present and make more informed decisions about the city’s future.\n\nThe Puritans Find Their Way To Boston, Massachusetts\n\nSo, how old is Boston? The answer may surprise you – it is over 390 years old! Boston, Massachusetts, was founded in 1630 by the Puritans, also known as the Pilgrims, who were traveling from England. It quickly became one of the most economically progressive cities in the New England area. Bostonians were historically a religious group, and their Christian ideals influenced every aspect of their lives. All citizens were forced to go to church, marry and bear children, as was expected of any strictly Christian community at the time. Some even took to more drastic methods and severely punished or killed those who were not of pure faith or were deemed not to be by groups of clergymen.\n\nIn the late 1600s, the colonies of England, which included Massachusetts, were all united together under the Dominion of New England. This area was governed by the appointed Sir Edmund Andros. However, many of the citizens of Boston were not happy with the Church of England at the time, and as Andros was a great supporter of the Church, a political uprising began to ensue.\n\nInteresting, how did Boston get its name? The city got its name from the Massachusetts tribe of Native Americans who lived in the area before English settlers arrived. The tribe called the area \"Shawmut,\" which means \"small, rocky place.\" When British pilgrims first arrived in 1630, they changed the name to \"Trimountaine\" for the three hills that surrounded it. Later, the colonists changed the name to \"Boston,\" after a town in England. This is why Boston is often referred to as \"the City on a Hill.\" It's also why the official seal of Boston contains three hills and an image of a shuttle.\n\nBoston Grows Out Of Its English Roots\n\nAs the city continued to grow, so, too, did the minds of its citizens as more and more people wanted to move towards a progressive society and move away from the pressure of British rule. Boston continued under the British for the next one hundred years, becoming increasingly more oppressive as the years went by.\n\nIn 1746, England served another tactful blow to the new colonies by issuing the Stamp Act. It was officially enacted on March 22, 1765, and required colonists to pay a tax on every single piece of paper that was printed. This caused enormous unrest amongst the colonists, as the tax was only imposed in order to pay for the British military, and did nothing to serve the new country they were trying to colonize. Bostonians began to riot, killing 5 people in what is now known as the Boston Massacre in 1770 and dumping British tea into the Boston Harbor, which is now famously known as the Boston Tea Party.\n\nThe American Revolution\n\nThis was the spark that would truly ignite the American Revolution and many historians claim that it began in Boston. On April 19, 1775, the Revolutionary War began and led to the United State’s freedom from England after the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Following this triumphant moment in history, Massachusetts became the 6th state in the United States on February 6, 1788.\n\nNow, Boston is a huge tourist destination for history buffs and cultural epicureans alike. It’s an enormous center for the arts and visitors flock to the city every year to take part in historical tours, see performances, see a Boston Red Sox Game, explore the city, shop at luxury stores, and enjoy the rich cultural atmosphere that the city provides. Boston is truly a walking city, with many people choosing to explore on foot, or by taking “The T”, Boston’s public transportation system.\n\nSome people may not know that Boston is home to the United State’s oldest park, the Boston Public Library, and the first chocolate factory, making those places hot tourist destination spots for the curious traveler.\n\nHave you ever traveled to Boston?
