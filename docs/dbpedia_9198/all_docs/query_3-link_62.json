        "text": "About The Fenway\n\nThe Fenway originally gained fame as home to several famous landmarks in the city, including Fenway Park and The Citgo sign. Today, it is known for much more. Through years of development, it has become the dynamic hive of interest and industry that we know today. It is alive 24-hours a day with world-class events, dining, art, shops and groundbreaking innovation.\n\nThe Present\n\nThe Fenway is thriving. No longer the new kids on the block, consider foundations laid and flags in the ground. We’re the beating heart of Boston, all because we’re proud of our neighborhood.\n\nCommunity always comes first. Our cultural offerings and seasonal events are great ways to get to know the area, meet locals and be part of a buzzing community.\n\nThe Code\n\nWe live by a certain code here in the Fenway. It keeps us nimble, hungry and ready for whatever the day throws at us.\n\nWe tell it like it is, we’re proud of our roots and our community is everything. Read it, live it."
