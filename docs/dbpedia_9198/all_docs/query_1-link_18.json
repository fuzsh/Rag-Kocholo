This came from a find at a cannery were they reused labels to cut down the cost of printing new labels. They blacked out the prior company and added their name.\n\n3.25 x 10.00 inches in size.\n\nPrinted in the 1920s.\n\nMint condition.\n\nAn original label, not a copy, not a computer-printed art print. A vintage label intended to be pasted on a can, but never used. Old stock from a warehouse find. When shopping at a store during this time period, this is the actual label you would have found on a can."
