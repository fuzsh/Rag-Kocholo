        "text": "If you’re considering moving to Boston, you might be familiar with the city for its famous baked beans, The Boston Marathon, and Fenway Park. But these are just a few aspects that make Boston so unique. So what else is Boston known for? Dig a little deeper, and you’ll find even more reasons why Boston, MA, is arguably one of the best cities in the U.S. In fact, the city consistently ranks at the top of “best of” lists.\n\nMaybe you’re renting in one of Boston’s many neighborhoods and are wanting to get to know your new city better. Or perhaps you’re curious about what it’s like to live in Boston before moving cross-country. Either way, you’ll quickly discover that this city has so much to offer. Check out this Redfin article to learn more about what makes Boston so special.\n\nWhat is Boston known for?\n\nHere are some of the top things Boston is known for, along with insights from locals, travel experts, and Boston enthusiasts.\n\n1) The endless activities to partake in\n\n“Boston is known for its history, gorgeous architecture, and countless activities to enjoy,” shares The Homebody Tourist, a travel blogger writing about road trip itineraries, dog-friendly travel ideas, and budget-friendly options for the average part-time tourist. “You can choose between a stroll along the Freedom Trail, a game at Fenway Park, a brewery tour, or even a helicopter ride over the city. There’s truly something for everyone which makes Boston the perfect destination for a weekend trip.”\n\n2) The vibrant history\n\nAs one of the first American colonies, our nation’s deepest roots began in Boston and are still preserved today. “Boston is known for being at the center of the American Revolution, and the city’s rich history is a huge part of its appeal,” says Nikki Stewart, Executive Director of Boston’s Old North Foundation. “People come to Boston from all over the World to experience the Freedom Trail and see historical icons like the Old North Church.”\n\nNo matter where you go in Boston, history is to be appreciated and enjoyed. Nikki Stewart goes on to say, “Considered a symbol of freedom and American independence, the Old North Church is famous for the events of April 18, 1775. Two allies of Paul Revere courageously broke the city’s military curfew, climbed Old North’s steeple, and held high two lanterns to signal to Patriot forces that British troops were marching to Lexington and Concord across the Charles River. The ‘one if by land, two if by sea’ signal lanterns were later immortalized in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s celebrated poem ‘Paul Revere’s Ride,’ which is still recited by schoolchildren across the country.” It goes without saying that Boston is a history lover’s dream.\n\n3) Boston’s sports culture\n\nIt’s true that there are several sports-savvy cities in the world. But, there’s no denying that Boston, MA is one of the best places for sports fans. There’s just something remarkable about cheering on The Sox (MLB), Pats (NFL), Bruins (NHL), or Celtics (NBA), and the camaraderie that forms among enthusiasts. Even if you’re not a baseball fan, you’re bound to have a ball at Fenway Park rooting for the Red Sox.\n\n4) The Boston Tea Party Museum\n\nBoston Tourism Made Easy, a sightseeing blog, explains what makes the Boston Tea Party Museum so great. “It is an interactive museum commemorating the famous tea party on December 16, 1773. The museum tells the story of the Boston patriots who dumped 342 chests of tea into the harbor to protest taxation without representation. Exhibits include:\n\nFull-scale replica ships\n\nAn amazing multimedia theater\n\nParticipation in a sometimes wet and very engaging tea party reenactment\n\nThe museum is located on the Freedom Trail and a must-see for anyone interested in American history.”\n\n5) The Boston public market\n\nIn search of artisanal bread, handmade pasta, fresh fruits, and vegetables? Head to the Boston Public Market, a year-round indoor market with various vendors. Everything you can buy at the Market is produced or originates in New England. You can even explore the market with a tour guide and take classes in The Kitchen’s demo space.\n\n6) The Boston Common city park\n\nNo matter the season, Boston Common is a must-visit. “It’s the oldest city park in the United States and full of fun things to do and see,” states Evan at Go Trivia, offering real-world immersive games to get to know the city. During the warmer months, Evan recommends checking out the Swan Boats, riding the carousel, and checking out the Frog Pond. And if the weather is colder, lace up your skates and hit the ice at the Frog Pond or check out the famous Nova Scotia Christmas Tree.\n\n7) The city’s food scene\n\nBoston offers a little bit of everything\n\nBoston is known for its irresistible food scene. Boston Foodgram, a platform highlighting the best food and drinks in the Boston area, says, “Boston’s food scene is a seamless combination of classic and traditional to modern and trendy. Head to the North End for longstanding Italian establishments or the Seaport area for flashy cocktails and restaurants. However, Boston will always be the mecca for these iconic dishes: Boston cream pie, New England clam chowder, and lobster rolls.”\n\nThe international food scene is top-notch\n\nBoston is not only known for its signature local dishes, such as cannolis, oysters, and Fenway Franks, but the city is also bursting at the seams with international cuisine. “Boston has food specific to countries across Africa, like Nigeria, Liberia, Somalia, and more,” says Marisa Williams, Content Director at My Curly Adventures, a travel blog. “It doesn’t stop there either. Experience Italy at Eataly, a world of Chinese food in Chinatown, along with Haitian cuisine and the unique take on Boston’s famous lobster, Lobster and Waffles.”\n\nDon’t miss out on some of the best seafood\n\n“One of the best things to do in Boston, especially as a new resident, is to order a round of oysters and a bowl of chowder from The Union Oyster House. It’s the city’s oldest restaurant dating back to 1826 and a nice break if you’re walking the entirety of the historic Freedom Trail,” recommends Megan Indoe, Bobo & Chichi Media. “Head to the second level and sit in the “Kennedy Booth,” which JFK frequented. Be sure to look for the sign in the upstairs dining room.”\n\nThe food scene is ever-evolving\n\n“Boston has undoubtedly moved past its simple “Beantown” beginnings and has grown into a fan favorite for Foodies,” shares Martin Elliott, General Manager of Boston Pizza Tours and Binge On Boston. “Boston’s historic North End boasts award-winning pizza and pasta, and our vibrant Chinatown is home to delicious, must-try dim sum. We have trendy eateries in the South End and Seaport neighborhoods, plus the freshest seafood in the World.”\n\nFrom ivy league to award-winning chefs\n\nAs previously mentioned, Boston is home to the oldest public high schools in the country and a huge concentration of universities. “Needless to say, we have a lot of smart cookies around here,” shares travel blog City Living Boston. “Many of those brilliant folks have helped create the Boston food scene. You don’t have to go to an ivy league to be a great chef, but high standards in classroom work translate exceptionally well in the kitchen. We have too many to highlight here, so I’ll focus on some extraordinarily talented and bright Asian Women who are creating great food and community in Boston, including a doctor turned chocolatier, a mathematician turned baker, and a lawyer turned food tour guide:”\n\nEhChocolatier: A women-owned artisan chocolate boutique in Observatory Hill, West Cambridge.\n\nMei Mei Dumplings: Rooted in tradition and filled with carefully sourced ingredients, these Chinese dumplings can be found all across Boston and Rhode Island at several farmer’s markets.\n\nFlour Bakery: Located in the South End and Fort Point Channel, offering savory bites and sweet treats.\n\nPagu: A Japanese tapas restaurant in Cambridge, creating feel-good homey food that speaks to the body and soul.\n\nLittle Pecan Bistro: A cozy eatery serving Asian fusion with a Latin American twist.\n\nBoston Chinatown Tours: An immersive, 3-hour experience with tastings, a visit to an herbalist, a tour through the grocery store, and dim sum.\n\nKoji Club: A sake bar dedicated to celebrating, learning, and drinking good sake.\n\nBao Bao Bakery: Custom cakes, pastries, and bubble tea.\n\nDouble Chin: Located in the heart of Boston’s Chinatown, specializing in Chinese dishes with modern twists.\n\nOne thing is certain: Boston has a dish that’ll leave you hungry for more.\n\n8) Boston Harborwalk\n\nThe Charles River flows through the city, meeting up with the Atlantic Ocean at its destination. The Boston Harborwalk stretches nearly 40 miles along the public waterfront that wounds through Boston’s waterfront neighborhoods. The trail boasts incredible views of the Boston skyline, parks, and more.\n\n9) Annual events\n\nBoston is known for its history and traditions, and is a city that truly prides itself on its annual events. The Boston Marathon is the oldest in the world and ranks as one of the most prestigious events. Boston’s St Patrick’s Day Parade celebration is one you don’t want to miss. There’s also Harbor fest, the fourth largest Fourth of July celebration. If events are your thing, Boston is the place to be.\n\n10) Being the mecca of American higher education\n\n“The Boston area is known for the country’s oldest university, Harvard (established in 1636), and many other top-ranked institutions,” says Dave Bergman, Ed.D, Director of Content at College Transitions LLC, a team of experts who guide students through the application process. “The city draws tech geniuses from around the globe to MIT and swarms of brilliant people to the likes of Boston University, Boston College, Tufts, and Northeastern, among others. The heavy concentration of prestigious colleges flavors the city with unmatched raw intellect and an innovative spirit. The universities’ collective contribution to the area’s arts, culture, and overall vibrancy explains why Boston is the nation’s premier academic hub.”\n\nAnd while the history of education in Boston runs deep, it’s not slowing down. Spark Admissions, a college admissions consulting firm that helps students find their best-fit college or university, shares, “Thousands of new students arrive in the city every year to study and explore, furthering Boston’s legacy as the nation’s premiere hub of learning. In recent years, Boston’s wave of innovation in biotechnology, computing, and education has increased the popularity of Boston’s universities, which received record-high numbers of applications in the 2021-2022 cycle. From major research universities like Northeastern and Harvard to quieter suburban campuses like Wellesley and Brandeis, Boston’s universities are central to the city’s identity.”\n\n11) South Street Diner, Boston’s only 24-hour restaurant\n\nBoston is a melting pot of old traditions and new technology, and so is South Street Diner. It’s a welcoming feeling of home. Experience of the flavors of local foods is in their lobster omelet and Boston cream pancakes.\n\n12) Faneuil Hall, one of Boston’s most popular tourist attractions\n\n“Built in 1742, the building was named after Peter Faneuil, a wealthy merchant who donated the land where the building now sits,” shares Kyle Kroeger, Owner of travel site ViaTravelers, filled with trip ideas and travel tips. “Today, the hall is home to a marketplace and shops, though you can also visit the historic building. The Faneuil Hall Marketplace is one of Boston’s most popular tourist destinations and offers plenty of shopping opportunities and dining options, such as the Quincy Market.”\n\nDeciding between renting or buying your next home?

Here are 12 ways to get to know Boston a little better.\n\n1) Partake in endless activities no matter the season\n\nBoston is filled with things to do and places to explore throughout the year. “There is so much to do during every season,” states Katie Chavez, creator and editor of The World on my Necklace. “Visit in the fall for vibrant autumn colors, and be sure to check out Boston Common, walk the Freedom Trail between important historical sights, and don’t miss eating as much seafood as you can – it’s so good here, especially the clam chowder.”\n\n2) Check out the High Street Place food hall\n\n“How can you tell Boston’s food scene is thriving? Look at the new High Street Place food hall that has attracted James Beard award-winning chefs,” says Chef Denise, a chef exploring the world through food. “Top Chef All-Stars, Michelin-Star chefs, and celebrity chefs continue to flock to make their mark here. You can still find the iconic foods dating back to the 1800s like Boston Cream Pie and Parker House Rolls, but the food at the city’s heart leans Italian, Irish, and, of course, as a coastal port, seafood.”\n\n3) Take tours all across the city\n\nTrademark Tours, operated by Harvard Student Agencies, recommends learning about your city by taking tours. “You can take the student-run walking tour at Harvard to see the former dorms of Mark Zuckerberg, JFK, Matt Damon, and more. Afterward, head down and see the Charles River from our favorite viewing spot, Weeks Footbridge.”\n\n4) Visit Boston’s oldest restaurant\n\n“Boston’s oldest restaurant, the Union Oyster House, may date back to 1826, but the city’s food scene is the opposite of ancient,” says Daryl and Mindi Hirsch, authors of 2foodtrippers, a website dedicated to food travel guides And tasty recipes. “This is a city where restaurants serve Ramen and Pho in addition to Clam Chowder (pronounced chowda) and Baked Beans. Plus, it’s a city where Lobster Rolls are a thing, and who doesn’t love Lobster Rolls?”\n\n5) Visit the city’s campuses\n\n“You’ll find plenty of fun and free things to do on the city’s campuses,” states Jessica Morrobel, content creator at Traveling with Jessica, a content creator centered around travel. “Wander around Harvard Square to check out street performances or head to Boston University for free stargazing at the Coit Observatory.”\n\nMorrobel also recommends visiting when admission is free. “You’ll also find admission-free days at local museums. Consider checking out modern masterpieces at the Institute of Contemporary Art on any Thursday, where admission is free from 5 PM to 9 PM.”\n\n6) Start your day exploring Boston on foot\n\nGlobal Viewpoint Travel Blog, recommends learning about Boston on foot. “Boston’s rich history and cultural charm are unlike anywhere else. One way to explore your new city is to walk through the Boston Common and Public Garden. Then, go for a bite to eat at the historic Faneuil Hall or the North End Italian district. Don’t miss the Rose Kennedy Greenway, a beautiful public park in the heart of the city. Other top things to do in Boston include shopping on Newbury Street, exploring the modern Seaport district, and taking photos of Beacon Hill.”\n\nThe city has many different walking tour options if you’d like to explore Boston with an expert. Boston By Foot is a non-profit educational organization committed to inspiring locals and visitors to discover the diverse stories of Boston by exploring the cityscape together. It’s dedicated to promoting awareness and appreciation of Boston’s rich history and architectural heritage by offering a wide range of guided tours.\n\n7) Explore Boston’s neighborhoods\n\nStop by Boston’s North End neighborhood\n\n“Boston is known for its distinctive neighborhoods, and the North End does not disappoint, says Brews & Clues, a bar crawl trivia tour for discovering Boston’s revolutionary history. “Travel back in time to another country as you walk through the tight cobblestone streets and explore the many boutique restaurants. Grab an espresso, cannoli, or gelato. Enjoy a slice at Pizzeria Regina, have the best meal of your life, and Visit Paul Revere’s house. You can easily spend an entire day in the North End.”\n\nSpend time in Beacon Hill\n\nBeacon Hill is one of the best neighborhoods to explore in Boston,” states The Abroad Blog. “It’s one of Boston’s most historic neighborhoods and is known for its quaint cobblestone streets, yummy cafes on Charles Street, and central location in the city. Beacon Hill is adjacent to the Massachusetts State House and the Boston Common – America’s oldest park. Within Beacon Hill, you must stroll down Acorn Street, one of the most instagrammable places in Boston, and features dozens of row homes dating back to the 18th century. This neighborhood is incredibly romantic during the fall foliage season and holiday months, although it’s enjoyable year-round.”\n\n“Beacon Hill is full of alleys, narrow cobbled streets, original gas lamps, and walled gardens, shares Savored Journeys, offering travel tips and itineraries. “Another often overlooked thing to do is visit the Boston Harbor Islands. Ferry tours leave from One Long Wharf, near the aquarium.”\n\nVisit South End\n\nThere’s so much history in nearly every neighborhood in Boston. Beacon Gallery, a female-owned art gallery founded in 2017, shares, “In the 1850s, Boston’s South End began to develop from marshlands and one road into Boston. In the 19th century, it became a middle-class residential and manufacturing neighborhood, with waterfront warehouses and rows of brick residences. The waterfront has since moved on, but the period warehouses and homes live on, mixing the South End’s newest high-end residences with old-world charm. This diverse neighborhood (with an art and design district called SoWA for South of Washington Street) serves as a vibrant cultural center for Boston. Rich with galleries, art studios, performance spaces, artisan shops, weekend markets, and dining, it’s a magnet for locals and tourists alike.”\n\nStroll through the Public Garden and Back Bay\n\nAlyssa Stevens of The A-Lyst, a Boston-based lifestyle blog, recommends, “Meander through the Public Garden, one of the most beautiful green spots in the city, or take a stroll down the shady Comm Ave Mall to relish the architecture of the Back Bay. Then, end your day by scoring a table at one of Boston’s best restaurants (Coppa, Kava, B+G Oysters, Mistral, Ostra), many of which are owned and run by local chefs. While you should still indulge in a Boston Cream Pie and copious amounts of New England seafood, don’t miss the quaintness and culinary expertise that the “real” Boston offers.”\n\n8) Visit world-class museums\n\n“As a new resident, you must make time for some world-class museums,” says New England with Love, a travel site dedicated to sharing the best in New England. “The Museum of Science is a must-do for both kids and adults. There’s always something fascinating to discover with its vast array of permanent and rotating exhibits, including incredible visual and musical shows at the Planetarium, such as “The Radiohead Experience.”\n\nNew England with Love also recommends visiting the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. “The museum is well worth a visit in its own right. This stunning art museum is perhaps especially intriguing as the site of one of the World’s largest ever heists.”\n\n9) Eat your way through the city\n\n“This is something all visitors and locals happily get behind,” states Ashley Smith, My Wanderlusty Life, helping others travel on a budget. “Choose one of Boston’s tastiest neighborhoods and explore the area on foot, using your gut as your guide. Start the day with dim sum in Chinatown, head to the Seaport for chowder and lobster rolls, then make your way to the North End for pasta and pastries. Each Boston community has something different to offer. Always remember to go where the line is longest.”\n\n10) Visit nearby national parks\n\nChris Christensen from AmateurTraveler.com recommends visiting the national parks near Boston. “You can learn of the events in 1775 that happened at Minute Man National Historical Park at Lexington and Concord, or about Paul Revere and the other patriots on the Freedom Trail.”\n\nChristensen continues, “An activity that may come as a surprise to many is the opportunity to take a boat out to the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area. You can also watch a blacksmith at the recreation of one of America’s first iron works in Saugus or some of the first textile mills in Lowell. It’s no surprise that Boston has more history per square mile than any city in the U.S.”\n\n11) Experience a panoramic view of Boston\n\n“The real gem in Boston is on the 50th floor of the Prudential Building, the Skywalk Observatory,” says Lisa Eldridge, founder of Girl about the Globe, a solo female travel blog. “This is the highest observation deck in New England and gives you a panoramic view of Boston and surrounding areas. It is the best way to experience the city as you can see Fenway Park and even Harvard University, which you otherwise might not be able to see in just one day.”\n\n12) Take a tour of the USS Constitution\n\n“Some first-time visitors make the mistake of skipping a tour of the USS Constitution because they don’t consider themselves history buffs, but don’t let that happen to you,” warns Antonina, founder of Embrace Someplace.\n\nAntonina shares, “Located at the end of the Boston Freedom Trail, the USS Constitution was launched in 1797 and is considered the oldest ship in the World still afloat. Not only is the ship afloat, but it sailed under its power as recently as 2012, 215 years after being launched. Guests are welcome to come aboard the ship and experience the glory for themselves. Make sure to pop into the USS Constitution Museum (housed in a restored shipyard) as well for an opportunity to learn more about the history of the Navy and the splendors of the USS Constitution.”"
