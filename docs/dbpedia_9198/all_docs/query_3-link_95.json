        "text": "History: itâ€™s all about the present.\n\nOur courses delve into the lives, cultures, debates, and controversies of the past, allowing us to understand our world today. Through our programs, we cultivate critical thinking, equip you to construct historical narratives, and hone your persuasive argumentation skills. The study of history enriches your private life, empowers you to make informed decisions in the public sphere, and prepares you for careers in law, politics, teaching, journalism, and other fields that demand strong reasoning and writing abilities.\n\nOur undergraduate program offers a wide range of courses covering various regions and eras, designed to accommodate students majoring in other disciplines while also interested in history. In our graduate program, we provide a Master's degree program with a focus on U.S. and European history, culminating in a thesis or capstone paper. Additionally, we offer specialized tracks in Public History and Archives."
