        "text": "Boston's diverse neighborhoods serve as a political and cultural organizing mechanism. The City of Boston's Office of Neighborhood Services has designated 23 Neighborhoods in the city:\n\nThe islands in Boston Harbor are administered as part of the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area.[1]\n\nThe Boston Redevelopment Authority,[2] the City Parking Clerk,[3] and the City's Department of Neighborhood Development[4] have also designated their own neighborhoods. Unofficially, Boston has many overlapping neighborhoods of various sizes. Neighborhood associations have formed around smaller communities or commercial districts (often with \"Square\" in the name) that have a well-defined center but poorly identified extremities.[citation needed]\n\nHistory of Boston's neighborhoods\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: History of Boston\n\nAs the city of Boston has grown and evolved, its neighborhoods have changed as well. The names of the West End, North End and South End refer to their positions on the Shawmut Peninsula, the original extent of Boston. Due to the annexation of surrounding communities, those neighborhoods are no longer at those geographic extremities.[5][6] The Back Bay and Bay Village neighborhoods were formerly part of an actual bay, becoming the neighborhoods they are today after landfill projects expanded the size of the city.[citation needed] Brighton (including Allston), Charlestown, Dorchester (including South Boston, Mid Dorchester, Mattapan and Hyde Park), Roxbury (including West Roxbury, Roslindale and Jamaica Plain), have all at some point been municipalities independent from downtown Boston, providing a source of well-defined boundaries for the largest areas.[citation needed]\n\nGeographic overview\n\n[edit]\n\nDowntown Boston includes Downtown Crossing, the Financial District and Government Center.\n\nSurrounding downtown are the neighborhoods of Chinatown/Leather District, South End, North End, West End, Bay Village, Beacon Hill and Back Bay. Chinatown/Leather District is the historical garment district and today has thriving Chinese and other Asian populations.[7] The South End is the center of the city's LGBT population and also populated by artists and young professionals as well as a vibrant African American community.[8] The North End retains an Italian flavor with its many Italian restaurants, though many of its Italian families have moved out, while young professionals have moved in.[9] The Back Bay is west of the Public Garden, and Beacon Hill is the site of the Massachusetts State House. The Back Bay and Beacon Hill are also home to national and local politicians, famous authors and top business leaders and professionals. Bay Village is one of the smallest neighborhoods in Boston and mostly contains Greek Revival-style row houses.[10]\n\nNorth and east of downtown are the neighborhoods of East Boston and Charlestown. East Boston has a majority of Hispanics, Brazilians, and young professionals, with a remnant of older Italians, and is the site of Logan International Airport. On the north bank of the Charles River is Charlestown; once a predominantly Irish enclave and site of the Bunker Hill Monument, it is now a home for young professionals.[11][12]\n\nWest of downtown are the neighborhoods of Fenway Kenmore, Allston, Brighton, Longwood and Mission Hill. Fenway Kenmore borders the campus of Boston University and houses many college students and young professionals and is the location of Fenway Park. Allston and Brighton are populated heavily by students from nearby universities, as well as recent graduates. Mission Hill is an ethnically diverse neighborhood, adjacent to the Longwood area, which is full of world-class medical institutions. [citation needed]\n\nSouth of downtown are the neighborhoods of Roxbury, Jamaica Plain, Dorchester, Mid Dorchester and South Boston. Dorchester, including Mid Dorchester, is Boston's largest neighborhood and predominantly a working class community considered to be Boston's most diverse. Roxbury is populated largely by African Americans, Caribbean Americans and Latinos and is historically the center of Boston's black community. Jamaica Plain is a community of white professionals and Latinos, and includes the larger side of the Arnold Arboretum. South Boston is a predominantly Irish-American neighborhood, which hosts the city's annual St. Patrick's Day parade.[13]\n\nSouth of Roxbury, Jamaica Plain and Dorchester are the neighborhoods of Mattapan, Roslindale, Hyde Park and West Roxbury. Roslindale is known for its small business district and includes the smaller side of the Arnold Arboretum. Roslindale has also recently become a majority-minority neighborhood. Mattapan remains the neighborhood with Boston's highest concentrations of African Americans. Hyde Park and West Roxbury have a distinct suburban feel, while still being a part of the city of Boston. Both neighborhoods have large areas of wooded parks and recreation land. Hyde Park is populated largely by African Americans and Caribbean Americans, whereas West Roxbury is predominantly white, but with rapidly growing African American, Middle Eastern and Latino populations.[14][15][16]\n\nList of places and squares within neighborhood areas\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 23 official neighborhoods in Boston are made up of approximately 84 sub-districts, squares and neighborhoods within each official neighborhood. The Boston Redevelopment Authority defines 16 planning districts (plus the Boston Harbor Islands) and 64 Neighborhood Statistical Areas (with four areas further subdivided). These correspond roughly with the neighborhoods and sub-neighborhoods of Boston. Unofficially, Boston is made up of approximately 105 neighborhoods.[citation needed]\n\nAllston and Brighton\n\nAllston Village\n\nBrighton Center\n\nCleveland Circle\n\nHarvard Stadium/Charlesview\n\nUnion Square\n\nOak Square\n\nFaneuil Square\n\nBrighton Mills\n\nLower Allston\n\nNorth Brighton\n\nPackard's Corner\n\nSoldier's Field\n\nBack Bay\n\nCopley Square/Boston Public Library\n\nCommonwealth Avenue Mall\n\nNewbury Street\n\nBay Village (also known as South Cove)\n\nBeacon Hill\n\nLouisburg Square\n\nMassachusetts State House\n\nCharlestown\n\nBunker Hill\n\nThe Neck\n\nThe Navy Yard[17]\n\nHayes Square\n\nCity Square\n\nThompson Square\n\nSullivan Square[18]\n\nChestnut Hill\n\nChinatown and the Leather District\n\nDorchester[19]\n\nAdams Corner/Adams Village\n\nAshmont (including Ashmont Hill, Ashmont-Adams and Peabody Square)\n\nColumbia Point/Harbor Point\n\nSouth Bay\n\nCedar Grove\n\nFields Corner\n\nFranklin Field\n\nGrove Hall\n\nLower Mills\n\nJones Hill\n\nMeeting House Hill\n\nNeponset\n\nPolish Triangle (extends into South Boston)\n\nPopes Hill\n\nPort Norfolk\n\nSavin Hill\n\nUphams Corner\n\nDowntown Boston and the Financial District\n\nBulfinch Triangle\n\nCombat Zone (defunct)\n\nDowntown Crossing/Ladder District\n\nFort Hill Square\n\nGovernment Center\n\nHaymarket Square (Boston)\n\nPost Office Square\n\nSouth Station\n\nBoston Theater District\n\nWaterfront\n\nEast Boston\n\nEagle Hill\n\nJeffries Point\n\nOrient Heights\n\nCentral Square\n\nDay Square\n\nMaverick Square\n\nBoston Logan International Airport\n\nTed Williams Tunnel\n\nCallahan Tunnel\n\nSumner Tunnel\n\nSuffolk Downs\n\nFenway/Kenmore\n\nAudubon Circle\n\nBack Bay Fens\n\nKenmore Square\n\nBoston University (extends into Allston)\n\nLongwood Medical Area (extends into Mission Hill)\n\nLansdowne Street/Fenway Park\n\nHyde Park\n\nReadville\n\nFairmount Hill\n\nSunnyside\n\nJamaica Plain\n\nHyde Square\n\nForest Hills/Woodbourne\n\nMoss Hill\n\nMattapan\n\nWellington Hill\n\nMattapan Square\n\nMid Dorchester[20]\n\nBowdoin-Geneva\n\nCodman Square\n\nFour Corners[21]\n\nMission Hill and Longwood\n\nBrigham Circle\n\nBack of the Hill\n\nParker Hill\n\nNorth End\n\nAnn Street (North Street)\n\nHanover Street\n\nRoslindale\n\nRoslindale Square\n\nRoxbury\n\nEgleston Square[22]\n\nFort Hill\n\nFranklin Park (extends into Jamaica Plain and Dorchester)\n\nNubian Square (formerly Dudley Square)\n\nRoxbury Crossing\n\nSouth Boston\n\nAndrew Square (extends into Dorchester)\n\nD Street\n\nDorchester Heights / Telegraph Hill\n\nFort Point\n\nSouth Boston Waterfront/Seaport District[23]\n\nCity Point[24]\n\nSouth End\n\nSouth of Washington (SoWa)\n\nWest End\n\nCharles Street\n\nNorth Station/TD Garden\n\nMassachusetts General Hospital\n\nWest Roxbury\n\nParkway (extends into Roslindale)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nLists of neighborhoods\n\nOffice of Neighborhood Services\n\nBoston Redevelopment Authority\n\n\"Neighborhoods as seen by the people\".
