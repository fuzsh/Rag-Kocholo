This antique can label was used by Buy-Rite Co., Boston Massachusetts. Nice image of Holstein cow, gold trim. This came from a find at a cannery were they reused labels to cut down the cost of printing new labels. They blacked out the prior company and added their name.

3.25 x 10.00 inches in size.

Printed in the 1920s.

Mint condition.

An original label, not a copy, not a computer-printed art print. A vintage label intended to be pasted on a can, but never used. Old stock from a warehouse find. When shopping at a store during this time period, this is the actual label you would have found on a can.
