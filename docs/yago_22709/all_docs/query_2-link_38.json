        "text": "RECONQUISTA, INQUISITION, AND CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS\n\nWhen royal cousins Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile married, they ushered in an era of sweeping change — not only for Spain, but also for the entire globe.\n\nThey brought an end to the bloody and centuries-old struggle between Christians and Muslims for power on the Iberian Peninsula. Moreover, in an age of intense turmoil over religion, they forced a measure of uniformity on the most ecumenically and socially diverse country in Europe.\n\nFor good measure, they sent Christopher Columbus on his momentous voyage to the New World and opened the way for European colonization.\n\nUnification of Spain\n\nIsabella\n\nIsabella, born in 1451, was the daughter of King John II of Castile and his second wife, Isabella of Portugal. She was second in line for the throne, behind her half-brother, Henry. In her early years, she was beset by unending political turmoil, royal intrigues, and power struggles. In this atmosphere of turbulence and uncertainty, she grew up to be deeply religious.\n\nUpon the death of Isabella’s father, her older half-brother took the throne as King Henry IV of Castile. Civil war soon erupted over the issue of succession. Under pressure from his nobles, Henry named Isabella as his presumptive heir to bring the war to an end.\n\nThe issue of her marriage was ongoing and complicated. When she was six years old, her father arranged a betrothal with Ferdinand, son of King John II of Aragon. Then, adrift in the shifting tides of royal politics, she was later betrothed to several additional suitors and sought after by many others.\n\nAmong those who wooed Isabella were:\n\nCharles, nephew of John II of Aragon\n\nAlfonso V of Portugal\n\nPedro Giron Acuna Pacheco, master of the military Order of Calatrava\n\nEdward IV of England\n\nRichard, Duke of Gloucester\n\nCharles, Duke of Berry\n\nRejecting them all, Isabella married her very first suitor, Ferdinand, in 1649.\n\nIsabella and Ferdinand were second cousins by descent from John I of Castile.\n\nIn 1474, upon the death of her brother, Henry IV, she proclaimed herself Queen of Castile.\n\nThe War of Succession followed when Henry’s daughter Joanna (known as Beltraneja), challenged Isabella’s right to rule. Supported by Portugal, Joanna continued the fight until 1749 when, with the assistance of Ferdinand’s Aragon, Isabella emerged victorious.\n\nFerdinand\n\nFerdinand was born in 1452 to John II of Aragon and Navarre and his second wife, Juana Enriquez. He was John’s youngest and favorite legitimate son. Upon his father’s death in 1479, Ferdinand inherited the crown of Aragon, which also made him ruler of the kingdoms of Majorca, Valencia, Sicily, and Sardinia, as well as the Principality of Catalonia.\n\nWhen he married Isabella, he became the first de facto king of Spain.\n\nMarriage between second cousins was prohibited by the church under the principle of consanguinity. Therefore, Valencian Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia (later Pope Alexander VI) helped fabricate a papal bull from Pope Pius II to authorize the cousins to marry.\n\nPius II died in 1464, five years before he “issued” the papal bull.\n\nUnity\n\nIsabella and Ferdinand were married under a prenuptial agreement that defined how they were to share power. In practice, the kingdoms of Aragon and Castile were not to be ruled as a single entity, but rather as separate political units under both monarchs in a personal union. The unification arrangement allowed Spain to rival the other great powers of Europe.\n\nThe motto of the union was “Tanto monta, monta tanto.” (It makes no difference; it’s all the same).\n\nSpanish unification was not legalized until Philip V issued the Nueva Planta decrees between 1707 and 1716.\n\nIsabella’s Reforms\n\nWhen Isabella came to the throne of Castile, the kingdom was in serious disarray because of the excessive spending and judicial neglect of her half-brother, King Henry IV. As she instituted reforms, she focused more on justice than on mercy and was stricter and less forgiving than Ferdinand. This, in part, may be attributed to her strong religious convictions.\n\nIn the second year of her reign, Isabella instituted La Santa Hermandad (the Holy Brotherhood) in Castile, Leon and Asturias. Later, she introduced it in Extremadura and Andalusia. The Hermandad was a type of military peacekeeping association that imposed law and order by regular patrols of the roads and countryside, punishing wrongdoers. Under the Crown’s direct control, it was charged with wresting the justice system away from dissident members of the nobility.\n\nIn 1481, Isabella restored law and order to Galicia, a turbulent province that had been abused by local nobles since the days of her father. The highways, towns and villages were beset by criminals. Ultimately, Isabella’s officials drove more than 1,500 robbers from Galicia.\n\nIsabella found that the major reason for Castile’s poverty lay in the way her half-brother had sold off royal estates at prices significantly below their worth in order to raise quick cash. To mend the ruinous state of the kingdom’s finances, she reacquired these estates, repurchasing them at the cut-rate prices at which her brother had sold them.\n\nThe queen stipulated that any gifts made to churches, hospitals or the poor would not be revoked.\n\nUnder Charles’ reign, there had been an overproduction of coinage as the number of Castilian mints increased from five to 150. As a result, much of the money produced in these mints was worthless. Isabella claimed a monopoly over the royal mints, reduced their number and fixing a legal standard for coinage. By assuming control over the production of money, she restored the public’s confidence that the Crown could effectively administer the kingdom’s finances.\n\nIsabella also instituted significant legal reforms. One of these was to centralize power in the Crown by restructuring the role of the Royal Council. She also commissioned noted jurist Alfonso Diaz de Montalvo to develop a comprehensive legal code, the Ordenanzas Reales, to promote equality under the law and ensure fair and impartial administration of justice.\n\n1492: A Momentous Year\n\nReconquista\n\nUnification under Ferdinand and Isabella brought historic changes. Perhaps the most significant was completion of the Reconquista (“reconquest”), the centuries-long bloody struggle by the Christian kingdoms to wrest Spain back from the Muslims following their sweeping invasion in 711.\n\nFollowing a string of Christian victories in the 13th century (notably Las Navas de Tolsa in 1212, the Siege of Cordoba in 1236, and the Siege of Seville in 1248), the war lay dormant, and only the southern Kingdom of Granada remained in Muslim hands. In 1492, the armies of Ferdinand and Isabella marched south to lay siege. After 18 months, they were victorious.\n\nThough defeated militarily, the Moors continued to exert great influence on Spanish culture.\n\nThe Reconquista looms large in the foundational mythology of Spanish nationalism and the development of a Castilian and staunchly Catholic nation. However, the struggle between kingdoms was not regarded as a strictly religious war until the time of the Crusades, beginning in the 11th century. Before then, the Christian and Muslim kingdoms generally coexisted with a certain uneasy level of tolerance and often allied with each other against mutual enemies.\n\nThe legendary Spanish hero, El Cid, won honors fighting for both Christian and Muslim kingdoms.\n\nExpulsion of the Jews\n\nThe year 1492 also saw the expulsion of Jews from Spain, culminating years of persecution under the Inquisition. These events were rooted in the belief that achieving religious uniformity would produce political unity.\n\nTo this end, Ferdinand and Isabella obtained a papal bull in 1478 authorizing the Inquisition. Initially a Castilian tribunal, the Catholic Monarchs would soon extend it throughout Spain.\n\nUnder Grand Inquisitor Tomás de Torquemada, the Inquisition was known for its harsh methods, often including torture and the burning of heretics at the stake. The tribunals forced thousands of Jews and Muslims to convert to Christianity. These new converts were known as Conversos and Moriscos, respectively.\n\nFearing that unconverted Jews would influence these new Christians, Torquemada — himself said to be a descendent of Conversos — imposed the Alhambra Decree and forced the deportation of any who had not professed Christianity. Banishment of the Jewish community caused great suffering for those affected and resulted in severe economic damage to Spain.\n\nTen years later, unconverted Muslims were expelled.\n\nExploration of the New World\n\nIn 1486, an obscure Genoese navigator approached Queen Isabella with an improbable plan to sail west across the Atlantic Ocean to reach the rich markets of the Far East. He would do this rather than pursue the traditional eastward route around the coast of Africa and into the Pacific. Already, the king of Portugal had listened to his far-fetched proposal and turned him down.\n\nThe Genoese was named Christopher Columbus.\n\nIsabella referred his plans to a committee and ultimately gave him a nominal stipend that amounted to approximately the annual salary of a single sailor. Three years later, she sent another small sum along with a letter ordering all towns and cities under Spanish dominion to provide him with lodging and food free of cost.\n\nThough Columbus was persistent, the monarch balked at providing substantial financial backing. Finally, in 1492 after waiting at Ferdinand and Isabella’s military camp for the fall of Granada, he threatened to take his plans to France.\n\nIsabella relented, promising Columbus that if he succeeded, she would appoint him Admiral of the Ocean Sea as well as Viceroy and Governor of any lands he claimed for Spain.\n\nThus supported, Columbus ventured forth into the Atlantic in search of India. But instead of the Far East, he landed in the West Indies, where he established Spain’s first New World colony. The Spaniards quickly took advantage, turning their crusading zeal toward exploration and exploitation of the newly found lands. The result was one of the largest and most lucrative global empires in history.\n\nDespite the personal and political union of the monarchs, the early colonies were exclusively Castilian. Spaniards from Aragon and other Spanish kingdoms were prohibited from trading or settling in them.\n\nEpilogue\n\nIsabella died in 1503.\n\nFerdinand, until his death in 1516, labored to build Spain’s empire in the New World and to extended Spanish influence and power in Europe.\n\nCatherine of Aragon, the youngest daughter of the Catholic Monarchs, went to England to marry Arthur, Prince of Wales in 1501. After Arthur’s death, she famously married King Henry VIII. Their daughter reigned as Queen Mary I of England from 1553–1558. Because of her zeal for Catholicism and vigorous persecution of Protestants, she was known as “Bloody Mary.”"
