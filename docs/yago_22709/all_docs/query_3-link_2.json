        "text": "John II (born March 6, 1405, Toro, Castile—died July 21, 1454, Valladolid) was the king of Castile from 1406 to 1454; his political weakness led him to rely on his favourite, Álvaro de Luna, whom he made constable. He was nevertheless considered a man of cultivated taste and a patron of poets.\n\nJohn succeeded his father, Henry III, as an infant of less than two years of age, under the joint regency of his mother, Catherine of Lancaster, and his uncle, the infante Ferdinand, who became king of Aragon (as Ferdinand I) in 1412. John took the reins in 1419 but soon placed himself in the hands of his companion Luna, who contested the influence of Ferdinand’s sons in Castile. This led to factional struggles among the nobles, during which Luna enriched himself and his supporters. In 1430 a settlement was reached, and John II led a campaign against Granada, defeating the Muslims in the Battle of Higueruela (1431). John II sequestered his son, the future Henry IV, at Segovia, giving rise to fresh rivalries. He and Luna vanquished the dissidents at the Battle of Olmedo in 1445.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nIn 1447 Luna persuaded John, now a widower, to marry Isabella of Portugal, who soon opposed him. After Luna had connived at a murder, the tide turned; and in 1453 John II was persuaded to arrest and execute his favourite. He proved unable to govern alone."
