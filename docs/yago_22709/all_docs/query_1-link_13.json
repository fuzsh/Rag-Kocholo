        "text": "By their marriage in October 1469, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella of Castile initiated a confederation of the two kingdoms that became the basis for the unification of Spain. By their support of the explorations of Christopher Columbus, they also laid the foundations for Spain’s colonies in the New World.\n\nFerdinand was born in Sos, Aragon, on March 10, 1452, the son of King John II of Aragon and Juana Enríquez. In 1461 his father named him heir apparent and governor of his kingdoms. In 1468 he was also named king of Sicily.\n\nIsabella was born in Madrigal, Castile, on April 22, 1451, the daughter of John II of Castile and Isabella of Portugal. The politically arranged marriage between Ferdinand and Isabella was intended to unite the two kingdoms. When Henry IV of Castile died in 1474, Isabella had herself proclaimed queen in Segovia with Ferdinand at her side as king consort. They won a war of succession against Afonso V of Portugal in 1479, the same year in which Ferdinand acceded to the throne of Aragon.\n\nThe two rulers immediately set out to reform the administration of Castile. They broke the power of the nobles and acquired all their lands. They banned all religions other than Roman Catholicism—a deed for which they earned the title Los Reyes Católicos (The Catholic Monarchs)—and obtained from the pope the right to appoint all high church dignitaries. In 1478 they established the Spanish Inquisition to enforce religious uniformity (see Inquisition). In 1492 the Inquisition was empowered to expel from the kingdom all Jews who refused to be baptized, a move to strengthen the Church and to gain its support for the crown. This move proved to be unwise, for it eventually deprived Spain of some of its most affluent, influential, and cultured citizens.\n\nIn 1482 Ferdinand began directing military campaigns against the kingdom of Granada, the last foothold of the Muslims in Spain. The Muslims were finally defeated on Jan. 2, 1492, and those who would not convert to Catholicism were expelled from Spain. The conquest of Granada left Ferdinand time to help plan and support the first voyage of Columbus across the Atlantic Ocean."
