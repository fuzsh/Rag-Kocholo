        "text": "Childhood\n\nFerdinand II of Aragon was born on the 10th of March 1452 in Aragon. He was the son of John II and Juana Enriquez. His father took charge of his education to make sure young Ferdinand learnt as much as possible from real life experiences. Ferdinand loved the arts and vocal and instrumental music.\n\nCareer\n\nFerdinand was crowned king on the 15th of January 1475. He married the princess Isabella of Castile in Valladolid in October 1469. The court of Aragon wanted a return to Castile, and Isabella needed help to gain succession to the throne. The marriage initiated a dark and troubled life, in which Ferdinand fought on the Castilian and Aragonese fronts in order to impose his authority over the noble oligarchies, shifting his basis of support from one kingdom to the other according to the intensity of the danger. Isabella quickly gave him children. Ferdinand had seven in total. The were Joanna of Castile, Catherine of Aragon, Isabella of Aragon, John, Prince of Asturias, Maria of Aragon, Alonso de Aragon and John, Prince of Girona. The marriage began with almost continual separation. Ferdinand, often away in the Castilian towns or on journeys to Aragon, reproached his wife for the comfort of her life. Ferdinand divorced Isabella in 1504 and then married Germaine of Foix in 1505. Ferdinand then died on January 23, 1516, Madrigalejo, Spain.\n\nImportance in Henry’s reign\n\nFerdinand was very influential in Henry’s life his pact with Henry VII which meant his daughter Catherine of Aragon would marry Henry’s older brother Arthur actually allowed Henry to marry Catherine in 1509. Ferdinand soon became a crucial ally of Henry in the future after Henry’s failed French campaigns between 1511 and 1514. Henry realised that he couldn’t match the power of the Spanish or French army so he would need to make allies with Spain in order to invade France. And throughout Henry’s reign this is what Ferdinand was a crucial ally.\n\nSam Newby"
