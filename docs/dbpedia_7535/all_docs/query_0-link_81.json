I am especially grateful to the then-­d irector, Hendrik Geyer, and excellent staff, Marie Mouton, Christoff Pauw, Gudrun Schirge, Nel-­Mari Loock, and Leonard Katsokore. My time in South Africa was further enriched by many inside and outside the academy—­Shafiq Morton, Yasseen Kippie, Ebrahim Rhoda, Jackie Loos, Salma Arend and family, the Rakiep clan, and the ever-­ generous Cathy Salter, who made her country feel so familiar in all the best ways. I also want to express my deep appreciation to the intrepid Abdud-­ Daiyaan or just Daiyaan Petersen, who saved me from some serious errors at the last minute, and who has collected a wealth of documentation that promises to rewrite a lot of history at the Cape, much as Shafiq’s connections, determination, and generosity have really helped the story of Tuan Guru come alive for many more South Africans. While the book crystallized in Stellenbosch, it had many other moments of inspiration and help—­some whose significance I only realized very late, as with a typically learned note from my old boss George Miller sent way [ vii ]\n\nAcknowledgments back in January 2013. I especially want to thank Catherine Mayeur-­Jaoen and members of the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, in particular Ines Županov, Dana Rappoport, Vanina Bouté, Rémy Madinier, Elsa Clavé, Jérôme Samuel, and Paul Wormser, for conversation and care. London has its charms, too, as well as an incredibly comfortable attic in the home of Nick Duke and Karin Duke-­Roedler, who took me in at a very difficult time with such grace and patience. And I could never have learned so much from the British Library without the help of Annabel Gallop—­truly the most generous and warm of collaborators and an amazing authority on all things Malay and Jawi. Speaking of collaborators, I thank Andrew Peacock and İsmail Hakkı Kadı for the privilege of seeing their Brill sourcebook in press, which was crucial for chapter 10 and for helping put the late Ottoman Empire onto my conceptual map. As always, Brill’s home of Leiden played a great role for me, and more particularly a Scaliger Fellowship facilitated by Kasper van Ommen and Arnoud Vrolijk. I want to register my ongoing gratitude to the staff of the library in general over the years, as well as to Jan Just Witkam for perhaps the most amazing address in town. It was also great to deepen ties with Tom van den Berge and Marieke Bloembergen, Nira Wickramasinghe, Monique and Hendrik van Sandick, all the staff of the KITLV, and the inestimable Rosemary Robson, not to mention Jaap Plugge and Karla van der Boon in Westzaan, and, more recently, Tom Hoogervorst across the ether. Perhaps the biggest long-­ term debt, though, and one I can never repay, is to the late Adnan El-­Mecky in Utrecht and his brother in Jakarta, Tawfik. Our meetings in Holland and Indonesia may have been brief over the years, but they gave me real glimpses into life beyond the pages of colonial reports and periodicals. I only hope that I have done justice to their father. A flash visit to Singapore sponsored by Tim Bunnell of the Asia Research Institute was made that much flasher by the fellowship of Oona Paredes, Laavanya Kathiravelu, and Carl Hampel. I was able to present my work in Tokyo and to renew my acquaintance with Midori Kawashima due to the generosity of Masashi Haneda, as well as his colleagues and students. In Colombo I had a warm welcome from John Rogers and the staff of the American Institute for Sri Lankan Studies, not to mention those then led at the National Archives by the heroic Nadeera Rupesinghe, most especially Yurane, Sanjivini, and Nalin. I had a homecoming of sorts at Sydney, when I was a guest of the Southeast Asia Centre, thanks to Michele Ford and her dynamic [ viii ]\n\nAcknowledgments corridor, especially Minh Le and Thushara Dibley, and I am further grateful to Glenda Sluga, Adrian Vickers, and Dirk Moses, recently of the University of Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he had the luck of having Cemil Aydin for a colleague. I especially want to thank Cemil, Caelyn Cobb, Susan Pensak, and Monique Briones of Columbia University Press for working so hard to extract this book from my hard drive, substituting chapters on the Cocos Islands for those on the Japanese period, and the anonymous reviewers for their advice and critiques. Emily Shelton has further worked wonders with my reversed references and parenthetic prose, and Paolo Sartori gets a special mention, too, for getting this to the finish and for workshopping the title. I also wish to thank him as editor of the Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient for permission to reuse most of my article of 2021, which now appears as chapter 12. In that vein, too, I acknowledge the Rupert Museum (represented by Eliz-­Marie Schoonbee) for permission to use Irma Stern’s striking painting for the cover, the British Library for the arresting visa photograph of Salih bin ʿAbdat, Shafiq Morton once again for his photographs of Tuan Guru’s manuscripts, the Parliamentary Library of South Africa for its copy of George Angas’s plates of 1848, the Royal Collection Trust for Sydney Hall’s sketch of the arrival of the Prince of Wales at Colombo in 1877, and the family of Adnan once more for his childhood photo from Java.1 At Princeton I have more friends and colleagues to mention, first and foremost Erika Milam and Michael Gordin, who played such a role in the last years, but so have others, Helmut and Monika Reimitz; Rob Karl and Beth Rabbit; Tom Hare; my bemused chairs Bill Jordan, Keith Wailoo, and now Angela Creager; and new old friends hailing from Pearl Bay like Natasha Wheatley. There are also so many students past and present have taught me a lot—­Nurfadzilah Yahaya, Megan Abbas, Saarah Jappie, Lindsey Stephenson, Claire Cooper, Genie Yoo, and Ahmed Almaazmi, among others, and the various crews of HIS 241, 342, and 537. Wangyal Shawa has also done a great job on the maps once again. Lastly, I want to give thanks to Mum, Dad, my siblings and their families, Faridah, Daniel, and Vanita for their constant encouragement, patience, and love, and Judy for all the lasting memories of so many places—­Asian, African, Australian, and European—­that have been so interconnected for so long. [ ix ]\n\nA Note on Transliterations, Spelling, and Dates\n\nDealing with different conventions across imperial and linguistic boundaries, I have opted for a simplified spelling of Indian Ocean vocabularies that unites speakers of Arabic and Malay who once shared the same script. For this reason, as well as general readability, I have dispensed with macrons and subscript dots favored by Arabists while retaining indications of the ʿayn (ʿ) and hamza (ʾ) for technical terms and the names of Arabic speakers. By the same token, for Malay or Indonesian, I have used a single inverted comma where either sound is commonly marked in the middle of a name or word and used more recent spelling for famous individuals—­thus, Hasyim Asy‘ari. I have also tended to keep Abdallah with a medial a, rather than Abdullah, and the double m in Muhammad, unless the individual commonly spelled it otherwise, as did Mohamed Hachemi. In some cases, too, I have maintained more localized voweling, though I hope that this may aid recognition and differentiation, as between Abu Bakr Effendi in South Africa, and Sultan Abu Bakar of Johor. Dealing with Capetonian and Dutch transliteration of such names has led to particular headaches, particularly for those who are now well known, though for less famous people who appear repeatedly I have simplified. Hence Achmat van Bengalen (as he commonly appears in the literature) maintains his nonstandard spelling of Ahmad, but I use Abd al-­Haris and Abd al-­Hamid rather than Abdol Garies and Abdol Gamiedt, or Abd al-­Wahab rather than Abdol Wahab of Cape Town. [ xi ]\n\nA Note on Transliterations, Spelling, and Dates Lastly, when citing books and periodicals that are printed with dates that only appear in the Muslim lunar calendar, I give that stated date and offer a Gregorian calculation as it may not appear in any catalog as such. By contrast, if a source gives both forms, I keep the Gregorian alone. All errors remain very much my own.\n\n[ xii ]\n\nUnder Empire\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Arab with the Turkish Buttons On November 9, 1920, Salih bin Salim bin ʿAbdat, a twenty-­t wo-­year-­old resident of the lush hill town of Buitenzorg, otherwise known as Bogor, in West Java, boarded a train for the hour-­and-­a-­half journey down to Batavia, the stifling capital of the Netherlands East Indies. It is hard to know whether he would have been confident or nervous. There is surely no record of what class of ticket he purchased, and thus whether he sat with other so-­ called natives or among those identified as “Foreign Orientals,” occupying a carriage closer to that of the Europeans in first class with its electric fans. The humidity would have been oppressive, in any case. Sweat beaded on the brows of many passengers soon after the towering volcano Gunung Salak disappeared into the morning haze behind them. Once at Batavia, with its canals and tramways, we do know that Salih presented himself for an interview with Josiah Crosby (1880–­1958), the acting consul general for Great Britain. Already an old hand in Southeast Asia, Crosby had spent many years in Bangkok and had just been seconded from a fresh appointment to Saigon.1 Salih hoped that Crosby would grant him a visa in order to make a much longer journey across the Indian Ocean via Colombo to Aden, at the opening of the Red Sea. From there he would sail northeast along the South Arabian coast to the port of Mukalla and then continue by camel up to the hinterland oasis corridor of Hadramawt. [1]\n\nFigure 0.1 Salih bin Salim bin ʿAbdat, © The British Library Board, R/20/1412/f184, IOR.\n\nIntroduction This would not be his first journey to the striking environs of South Arabia, where patches of agriculture and mud brick compounds offered water and a modicum of cool security between desert and towering cliffs. Salih claimed a wife and residence in one such redoubt, the village of Ba Bakar. Lying at the western end of the long wadi, it was controlled from the town of Shibam by a governor appointed by Sultan Sir Ghalib b. ʿAwad al-­Quʿayti (r. 1910–­1922).2 Sultan Sir Ghalib was seldom there, though. His whitewashed palace stood on the coast at Mukalla and looked away from Hadramawt toward India, and Hyderabad in particular, whence his family’s wealth derived. It was by virtue of the loyal military service of his forebears to a string of fabulously wealthy nizams that they had been able to recreate a small corner of the Raj in the land of their ancestors.3 Ghalib’s passport had been issued to Salih on August 6, 1918, perhaps soon after the young man’s previous arrival in the land also of his paternal ancestors. Salih had been born in Batavia and spent his childhood both there and in Bogor, speaking Malay as well as Arabic. When dressed in the same sort of sarong worn on both sides of the Indian Ocean, he would have been hard to distinguish from many of his Indonesian relatives—­Javanese and Malay, among others—­but he would still have stuck out to his Arab ones as being Muwallad Jawa: Southeast Asia–­born. Salih was surely not wearing a sarong the day he called on the British consul. Based on the photograph he supplied (see fig. 0.1), dressed in a modern white suit topped off by a cocked red fez with a black tassel, Salih was the epitome of the modern young Indies Arab. Such youths and their mentors were oriented to Egypt, at the moment another protectorate of the British empire, with its opportunities, its rhetoric of Muslim equality for Arab and non-­Arab alike, and its booming literary and journalistic scene.4 Many such trouser-­clad young men—­a nd soon a number of skirted women—­were graduates of the modernist Irshad School, founded at Batavia in September 1914 by an African teacher, Ahmad Surkati al-­Ansari (1875–­ 1943), and bankrolled by the local Dutch-­appointed “Captain of the Arabs,” ʿUmar Manqush.5 Although Salih could not have started his schooling at the Irshad School, his father’s voluble support for both men and their egalitarian movement would have seen him invest in a suite of modern languages including, at a minimum, Dutch and English, in order to negotiate business both in the Indies and en route to the hallowed homeland, or watan, of Hadramawt. [3]\n\nIntroduction The problem for Salih, however, was that his father shared something with Manqush that no money or clothing could change. As the descendant of a relatively low-­born member of the larger Ba Kathir moiety—­whose own sultan was landlocked in the central wadi town of Sayʾun—­Salih’s modern learning and his Indies wealth were seen as a threat to the elite sayyids who claimed descent from the Prophet and who, as inviolable mediators between princes, effectively controlled the valley of Hadramawt and the ways thither. To some sayyids, young Salih was barely more than a “native” (watani), and he should have known his place—­it being one of social immobility. If they met on the streets of any major town of Java, where Arab men were vastly outnumbered by thousands of women and men of several Asian communities ( Javanese, Sundanese, and Chinese, for starters), a reverent greeting and inhaling of the perfumed hand would have been due to the sayyid. Salih could never have hoped to marry one of their sequestered daughters. Such expectations had caused Surkati, a Sudanese outsider trained in Ottoman Mecca, to establish his own school in a move that was quietly welcomed by some Dutch officials appointed to monitor their Muslim subjects. However, the political relationship between the sayyids and Great Britain had only grown during the Great War, when the Netherlands was neutral, and in opposition to the continuance of Ottoman authority over Arabia. Once the Ottomans entered the war on the side of Germany, many Irshadi Arabs and like-­m inded Indonesians, as they were starting to call themselves, remained sympathetic to Turkey and its sultan, whom they respected as the modern caliph of Islam. By contrast, two particularly prominent sayyids—­ Muhammad b. ʿAqil of Singapore and ʿAli b. Shahab of Batavia (a.k.a. Habib ʿAli Menteng)—­convinced the British in both cities, and thus Aden, that fez-­ wearing youths like Salih were not merely Turcophiles, but pro-­German enemies of the Union Jack and likely Bolsheviks.6 Before his interview with Salih, Crosby perused the ever lengthening list of Arabs supplied by Habib ʿAli, since updated by his visa application: Saleh bin Salem Bin-­Abdat. Born in Batavia. Address, Buitenzorg. A reckless anti-­British preacher. In conversation in the habit of condemning Great Britain and of impressing upon the Arabs (both members and non-­members of the Al-­Irshad Society) that the principal aim of the Society is to see the Hadramaut free from the grip of Great Britain to whom the country was sold by the Sa[yy]ids. [4]\n\nIntroduction Upon being advised by certain Arabs against being to too [sic] reckless in his anti-­British preaching, he replies that he has nothing to fear as he feels sure to be able to move about freely with Al-­Gaity’s passport which he holds. His father Salim bin Awad Bin-­Abdat, resident at Buitenzorg, is one of the strongest supporters of the Al-­Irshad Society and is an intimate associate of Manggesh [sic: Manqush] while he himself is highly respected by Manggesh despite his age.7\n\nIn his interview, Salih—­whose slightly mismatched eyes subtly mirrored those of the consul—­did not present in so hostile a manner. He denied “strenuously” that he was “in any way anti-­British.” Still, there was the slightly worrying matter of his dress. As Crosby observed, “He happened at the time to be wearing in his coat buttons the device of the star and crescent stamped upon them. I asked him why he chose to exhibit the national Turkish emblem in this manner, whereupon he professed ignorance of the fact that the device in question had any connection with Turkey at all! (The same type of button is largely stocked in the local bazaar and is much in vogue with the native public here. The possibility exists that the sale of it may in itself be a form of pro-­Turkish propaganda).”8 While hardly likely that such sales were Turkish propaganda, Salih could not have been ignorant of the powerful symbolism of his buttons. If they didn’t suggest an allegiance to Turkey, saddled with a suite of occupiers after the 1918 Armistice of Mudros, they most decidedly invoked an Islamic identity in 1920, an increasingly global one that wedded all manner of local struggles against a ubiquitous colonialism: British, Dutch, French, Italian, and American. Few places were free in Africa and Asia. Empire was the rule. Crosby—­who later embarrassed himself as the pro-­Japanese consul at Bangkok in 1942—­had already expressed his doubts about the biased information that he had been receiving from Bin Shahab. He decided to issue Salih with a visa because of his youth and the hearsay of the charges against him; the young Arab could travel. But he would be watched, and ultimately with reason. In 1924, his paternal kinsmen, ʿUmar and Salih b. ʿUbayd Bin ʿAbdat, would attempt to build a state of their own centered on the tiny fortified town of al-­Ghurfa, which lay between Quʿayti Shibam and Kathiri Sayʾun, eventually allied by British agreement in 1937.9 Starved of resources by the Japanese occupation of Java in 1942, the Bin ʿAbdats held on to their patch of the wadi until 1945, when Great Britain sent troops over from Hyderabad, and as yet more Indian soldiers were being mobilized to help the Dutch regain [5]\n\nIntroduction control of Java from nationalists who had declared independence two days after Japan’s surrender. *\n\n*\n\n*\n\nFrom the extended perspective that will be explored in this book, Salih was lucky in 1920. Hadramawt was not his only option. Many hundreds of youths like him would decide that the land of their birth—­almost always the birthplace of their mothers and grandmothers—­was the true watan. What was different was that they had more of a choice than many. At the same moment that people like Salih opted to claim an Arabian home, thousands of other descendants from the same complex web of families were accepting that they were now “Cape Malays” or “Ceylon Malays.” This all depended on the British Empire that had both claimed the Malay Peninsula, having enfolded their displaced forebears, and inherited a shared history of exilic experience, community formation, and the negotiation of (ethnoreligious) sovereignty, which forms the central theme of this book. As much African and South Asian, their stories are similarly bound up in the long and complex histories of the rival Dutch and British East India Companies and the imperial formations that succeeded them, arrogating the right to hand out passports and assigning unambiguous ethnic categories in place of pan-­regional affiliations. One was Arab, but not Malay, or Malay, but not Arab—­or distinctly Javanese, Moor, Egyptian, Tamil, or Omani. The list goes on. Moreover, setting aside their differences of ethnicity, the 1920s were a time of worry about the future of all Muslims on a global stage, when many looked to Egypt and the unraveling Ottoman Empire for religious leadership and moral support. And yet they had not always looked in that direction, just as few people had previously thought to buy crescent and star buttons to demonstrate their politics. As this book will show, the modern caliphal ideal emerged out of a history of partnership with Great Britain that pre-­ dated the nationalist conflicts of the twentieth century. It was also given form at a time when minority Muslims sought to demonstrate their loyalty to the empire, which succeeded the formations that had displaced their own sovereigns or sent them to the same oceanic spaces that had absorbed countless enslaved people, laborers, and soldiers in an age of global revolution and counterrevolution. This is a book recounting many journeys—­some exilic, many forced, most permanent—­taking place at or between moments of global turmoil, and [6]\n\nIntroduction across a key space being steadily restricted or governed by Western power. It furthermore ponders the moments of outreach for patronage undertaken by the descendants of those who had made these journeys, and who often felt left behind. Like the person of Salih himself, this book joins two peoples in a historic embrace across the Indian Ocean. The first is often invoked with reference to a watan in the interior of modern Yemen that sees seasonal flooding every few years, though its most articulate representatives abroad sometimes came from a wider mix of Arabic-­speaking nations, including those of the Nile and the Mediterranean. The other people is much more numerous and yet strangely elusive, reaching back to a dizzying array of tropical islands whose unity is celebrated by the modern Indonesian state even as they are marked by numerous differences. Their situation is reminiscent of Stuart Hall’s evoking of the Caribbean with its lesson for complex identity formation on a global stage.10 They furthermore share a deep history and character with neighboring Malaysia, which today holds Chinese and Indian minorities in an anxious and not quite postcolonial assemblage.11 To be sure, former premier Mahathir Mohamed (b. 1925), who rose to prominence in the wake of race riots in the 1960s, drew heavily on the colonial playbook for his Malay Dilemma of 1970. Here, the momentarily frustrated politician asserted Malay-­as-­Muslim primacy to the land by virtue of cultivating the first states and allowing the presence of outsiders, including the Western colonizers whose categorizations inflected who was and was not a true Malay in the first place.12 Mahathir himself claims both local and Indian ancestry, and his forebears would have been labeled as mixed outsiders, or Jawi Peranakan, by those same colonizers rather than the term he embraced so fully under their tutelage. To be sure, the spread of Western power in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries saw the Dutch and the English engage with many such peoples; though observers like the former resident of Penang and lieutenant governor of British Java Thomas Stamford Raffles (1781–­1826) posited an Arab genesis for all such seemingly hybrid Muslims of the Indian Ocean.13 More modern scholars have offered narratives suffused with examples of the specific Hadrami Arab and the general Indian, sometimes pushing their importance and collective consciousness back in time.14 This book will show, by contrast, how all of this is only a part of a more complex story. It also extends the formal bounds of geography to integrate the adjacent terrain of the Western Cape on the shores of the South Atlantic; the [7]\n\nIntroduction Ottoman vice-­regency of Egypt between the Arabian and Mediterranean Seas; and the farther reaches of Island Southeast Asia, dotted and splayed between the Arafura and South China Seas. This is to be a succession of what I would call the undercurrents, or perhaps even understories, of Indian Ocean history, if I may do the violence of borrowing an arboreal metaphor for an aquatic space. This is not to say that our understories are all subaltern, or salvagings of unrecorded lives. Some are well known in the successor nations of empire, having unfurled beneath the canopy of high politics; sometimes they are even visible at the global level, as with the Egyptian revolution and British invasion that caused the exile of Ahmad ʿUrabi and his peers, though the ensuing years mattered more to a distinct subsection of the people around him in Ceylon than his fellow Egyptians or Malay watchers. Equally, some of the people I focus on had lives that intersected or overlapped in indirect ways: sharing roots in one land or grafting their experiences onto the boughs of others and ultimately becoming one with them.\n\nBinding Neglected Trajectories of Global History This book tells the story of successive imperial engagements with Muslims across the Indian Ocean from the 1770s, when Great Britain’s East India Company was poised to ransack the territories of its Dutch rival from Cape Town to the Moluccas, to the 1940s, when Japan laid waste to all the claims of Western empire in Southeast Asia, most especially of Great Britain. Laying more emphasis on the framing and possibilities of Muslim lives than internal debates about doctrine and praxis, the operative thesis for much of the first two parts of this book is that an interrelated set of peoples from Southeast Asia, either subject to Dutch authority or to the consequences of Dutch actions in the eighteenth century, were objectified as potentially dangerous and fiercely loyal, both to their faith and their new and ostensibly “milder” British masters, who labeled them as “Malays” into the nineteenth century. At the same time, I will suggest, by way of evidence from scattered petitions, newspaper articles, and court cases, that some of these same peoples were necessarily strategic in staging loyalty as a means of securing rights—­ first to religious practice, and ultimately to place. Sometimes that loyalty [8]\n\nIntroduction was staged though tamed violence, as when Prince Alfred toured the Cape in 1860 and witnessed a performance of the Califa, or ratib, in which devotees of Sufi mysticism pierce their bodies with awls to the beat of tambourines. At others it was marshaled against other peoples at the blurring edges of empire, or put to use within it. Even if it is not performative, I recognize that loyalty is in itself hard to pin down or measure, especially when it is not put to the test, as it was for Maya Jasanoff’s cast of individuals who were scattered by the American Revolution.15 To be sure, loyalty need not even be singular, but concentric—­to home, place, and family—­and multiple, as Natalie Rothman has shown for the Ottoman and Venetian worlds of the sixteenth century, and as Pieter Judson suggests for the neighboring Habsburgs thereafter, where people of many varying cultures linked themselves to the imperial family.16 As we shall see, despite the increasing dominance of the Union Jack, the Indian Ocean was another sort of transimperial space where the odd uniform and foreign decoration hardly went astray. Sometimes it seemed that there was little else that Britain’s sometime allies the Ottomans could offer to the peoples of the Indian Ocean arena, though we should not dismiss the rather successful outreach of that empire before the Great War that partnered with a sense either of religious insecurity or grievance in the face of new challenges from Dutch, Siamese, and British expansion. Hence, from part 2 onward, I try to disentangle the overlapping story of how the modern caliphal image was refracted through cosmopolitan Mecca and Anglo-­Ottoman Cairo, becoming part of the package of Islamic patriotism. It was furthermore generated in partnership with Indian, African, and, most especially, Arab fellow Muslims of the Indian Ocean who began engaging with the globalizing modern sphere of papers and journals—­produced in Arabic script and with the full knowledge of colonial states. Hereafter, and with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Muslim confraternity was reformulated in the 1920s and 1930s as a strand of both distinct nationalism and wider revolutionary Afro-­Asian solidarity. This was ultimately tested by Japanese occupation and readied for the postcolonial moment when figures like Nasser joined Sukarno at Bandung in 1955, offering Muslim demographic heft for what would become the Non-­Aligned Movement. Touching as it does on East Africa, Southern India, and Lanka, some of what follows will be familiar to historians of the Indian Ocean. At the same time, much of it will be alien, especially when stretching to encompass what [9]\n\nIntroduction is today Eastern Indonesia. And if some histories of the vast waterscape have focused on the Arabian Sea at the expense of the Bay of Bengal, with Janet Abu Lughod and Abdul Sherrif previously eliding Southeast Asian and Chinese histories, there is no escaping the almost universal expansion of Western power that found its feet in the same muddy estuaries and sandy islets on the far side of India.17 Hence the first and fifth chapters will unfold over the last decades of the eighteenth century, as the moribund Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, or VOC)—­once enriched by the export and inter-­Asian circulation of spices and bulk crops—­faded in the face of intense rivalry from the British East India Company (EIC), firmly entrenched in Bengal and abetted by a parliament and king reeling from the loss of the American colonies. The home cities of the VOC and the networks of capital they had supported were fading, too, threatened by domestic calls for reform and the weight of events in Paris. The “Batavian” uprising of 1794 and a supportive invasion orchestrated by France saw the end of the ancien régime in the Netherlands in 1795 and the venerable company founded in 1602. With Holland in French hands, Prince William V (1748–­1806) had sowed confusion in the Indian Ocean territories of the fast-­dissolving VOC, which, from exile at Kew, he ordered to submit to British authority. At Cape Town in 1795, the united forces of British crown and company would best an unenthusiastic mix of Batavian loyalists and European mercenaries, followed by similar skirmishing and occupations of remaining Dutch possessions on Malabar and Coromandel, Ceylon, and then the distant Moluccas in 1801. With the brief Peace of Amiens of 1802, the Dutch would return to the Cape before being forced out yet again in 1806 while the Napoleonic Wars swept Europe. Worse still for Dutch ambitions, the city of Batavia—­their Asian capital for nearly two centuries—­would fall to the British in 1811, along with surrounding territories. These were handed back in 1816 following the restoration of the Netherlands as an independent state under the House of Orange in 1813. This was all to the chagrin of the temporary master of Java, Raffles, who plotted the transformation of Singapore into a potent rival for a more clearly Netherlandic Indies from 1819, which the smaller island did become after his death through the generous application of Indian convict labor and the passing trade in cotton, opium, and tea. The formal exchange of Cape and Ceylon was ratified at London in 1824, locking two related Dutch-­and Malay-­speaking assemblages in place. It also [ 10 ]\n\nIntroduction brought the peninsular city of Malacca into British hands, where local merchants worried that enslaved people might claim freedom under the Union Jack. Such worries were briefly placated. In lieu of Indies slaves and exiles being sent westward by the Dutch, the British crown would oversee the export of military muscle from the Malay Peninsula, as well as indentured Indian bodies to answer the needs of a colonial system. This was particularly so in Eastern and Southern Africa, though only after overseeing the binding of supposedly freed Africans into contracts that differed little from slavery. Malaya would also see ongoing imports, but more often of the criminalized Indian, making Penang an Asian analogue for the white settler colony of New South Wales. With a new incarnation of British empire taking shape on the southern fringes of EIC domains, commissions of inquiry were established. Judicial officers were sent to Sydney in 1819, then the Cape in 1823, Mauritius in 1827, and Ceylon in 1829, to see how Britannia’s dust had settled. Who was convict or slave, and who was free? What form of labor might best be used in the future? What were the habits and laws of the various peoples over whom the crown now held sway? How did Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists swear to uphold the truth in court? Who might best translate British authority?18 At the same time, the Dutch did not have an easy return to Java and the surrounding islands they would annex for the metropolitan purse. After full-­ scale rebellion on Java led by Prince Dipanagara (1785–­1855) from 1825 to 1830, and then as a more clearly Islamic insurrection on West Sumatra abated in 1837, the Netherlands Indies accelerated its own rhizomatic growth. Dutch absorption of Muslim coasts and diverse hinterlands always paled, however, in the face of the insatiable appetite of the EIC. On the subcontinent, raja after raja and sultan after sultan was subdued, forcibly allied, or incorporated to feed the military state, providing yet more push factors to a swell of laborers headed for the crown lands of Southern Africa and Ceylon, and the company ones in lower Burma and Malaya. While much attention has focused on the final creep of the EIC across the Ganjetic Plain, culminating with the shock of 1857, the earlier annexations of Southern and Western India—­snuffing out the kingdoms of Tipu Sultan of Mysore in 1799, the “Polygars” by 1805, and the Maratha Confederacy in 1819—­had already fed into wider regional anxieties, including Muslim ones. This was despite the fact that some Muslim rulers, such as the Nawab of Arcot, had been complicit in the spread of the Union Jack. Similarly, the Nizam of [ 11 ]\n\nIntroduction Hyderabad had assisted in the defeat of the French-­allied state built by Hyder Ali (1722–­1782), whose son Tipu had tried to enlist aid from the Ottoman sultan in the 1790s.19 Unfortunately for Tipu, as Cemil Aydin also reminds us, the Ottomans had already made an alliance with Great Britain to expel the French army from Egypt, which they succeeded in doing in 1801.20 Regardless of Ottoman or Hyderabadi friendship with Great Britain, the subsequent growth of a new regime of taxation on Malabar under the Madras presidency intensified the discontent of a Muslim minority previously used to a measure of self-­government when not under direct sultanic rule. Periodic insurrection and resistance ensued. After a series of revolts into the 1840s, some inspired by his father Sayyid ʿAlawi (1752–­1845), the thirty-­t wo-­ year-­old Sayyid Fadl (1820–­1901) was forced to leave Malabar for the Hijaz in 1852.21 Fadl’s exile came at a time when the Ottoman Empire was in the process of renewing its authority over its Arabian provinces. These had been under Egyptian military occupation ever since Muhammad ʿAli Pasha (r. 1805– 1848) had been tasked with uprooting the Wahhabi-­Saudi alliance in 1811. The pasha’s men may have gone, but there was great uncertainty in the Hijaz. Given the constant pressure exerted by Great Britain to suppress the slave trade, merchants of the Western Indian Ocean—­some close to Fadl—­fomented an uprising at Mecca in 1855. This was followed by the massacre of Christian consular staff at Jeddah in 1858, believed by some to be an outgrowth of India’s Great Revolt of 1857 that had ended EIC rule and spurred the creation of a fully amalgamated Asian empire under Victoria. After a season of spectacular revenge in India, some Britons imagined an incipient Muslim conspiracy with the power to carry away their gains across the oceanic arena. Officials at the more easterly stations of Penang, Malacca, and Singapore cast anxious eyes over the largely unfettered ranks of their Indian convicts, especially when they performed costumed marches at Muharram in honor of the family of the Prophet. But despite decades of anxiety about such marches and “Wahhabi” intrigues on the part of British officials in India, north and south, there had been no wider jihad in 1857. There was yet no such term for an explicitly transnational undertaking. Nor yet was there a clear commander for the enterprise. Having worked for the EIC courts as both clerk and munshi, in 1859 the widely regarded Syed Ahmad Khan (1817–­1898) was at pains to emphasize the inherent loyalty of Victoria’s Muslim subjects in his Urdu pamphlet Asbab-­e-­Baghawat-­e-­Hind (The [ 12 ]\n\nIntroduction Causes of the Indian Revolt)—­though he also complained of the past actions of his employer, their missionary friends, and ignorance on all sides. If the British company had neglected the languages and literatures of its Indian servants, his peers were fools indeed to invest their hopes in an emasculated sultan he painted as a delusional wastrel.22 Rather than express support for his Mughal contemporary in 1857, the Ottoman sultan Abdulmecid had publicly backed Great Britain and sent aid to EIC victims in 1858 while his Arab domains would become a site of exile and supplication for some of the veterans of that same revolt.23 Such even-­handed generosity was due to the fact that, after several decades of revolution and military setbacks—­including the loss of Greece, their Egyptian viceroy’s ambitions in Syria, and the latest extension of Russian claims on their Christian subjects—­the Ottomans had strengthened their practical alliance with Great Britain. This had helped Abdulmecid to victory over Russia in the Crimea in 1856 and secured promises from other European states concerning the inviolability of his territory. Still, he would soon lose much of the Caucasus to the tsar in the 1860s, setting in train a demographic shift whereby the Russian Empire would contain more Muslims than the Ottoman at the end of the century. Effectively the last standing Sunni emperor of a multiethnic and cosmopolitan domain who counted Christians, Jews, and Druze as his subjects, Abdulmecid had nevertheless acquired a most useful partner in Victoria, who had inversely acquired Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains. In 1867, she would array his successor, Abdulaziz (r. 1861–1876), with the Order of the Garter. Aydin notes that some Ottomans and British officials even mooted the idea of a marital alliance between Crown Prince Murad and one of Victoria’s daughters.24 While an unlikely proposition for the Muslim-­ curious but piously Christian Victoria, her elder sons had already met a lot of her Muslim subjects, having been packed off on tours of her Afro-­Asian domains, witnessing the spectacle of Sufis on-­stage at Cape Town or in the throngs at durbars in India. The Ottomans may not have sent junior members of their royal household on such tours of the Indian Ocean, whether to Yemen or the domains of their ubiquitous aquatic ally, but they had already recognized the value of waving the flag and of having consular representation, starting with the placement of an honorary consul at Bombay in 1849 and Cape Town in the 1850s. As this book will show, such appointments began to answer [ 13 ]\n\nIntroduction long-­standing calls for aid from a commander of the faithful, not necessarily to deliver believers from Christian rule, but to guarantee their proper treatment, instruction, and safe passage on the roads to Mecca. In discharging their duties, these appointees were often struck by the role played in the Indian Ocean by the sayyids in whom such hopes were additionally placed. Were not the holy cities of the Hijaz and the valleys of Hadramawt Ottoman? But if imperial collaboration and saintly sanction seemed the rule by mid-­ century and in an era when steam, cable, and print knitted together the increasingly colonized spaces of the world, the management of the annual hajj and support for the resident scholarly communities of Arabia signaled the cohabitation of past and present. Following journeys powered, as Chris Low reminds us, by modern steam and traditional muscle alike, more and more people heard in the holy cities how their coreligionists were reduced to a servile state and juxtaposed Muslim sovereignty with the supposed freedom of religion and employment proclaimed under Victoria, Willem III, or the French and Russian empires.25 And many watched with more than passing interest as the Dutch fought to suppress the sultanate of Aceh, in Sumatra, from 1873; as the tsar’s coalition continued to gnaw at the Ottoman domains, detaching Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro in the war of 1877–­1778; or when France invaded Tunis in 1881. By then the Anglo-­Ottoman alliance was growing decidedly colder. Benjamin Disraeli had thrown the new sultan Abdulhamid II (r. 1876–1909) to Alexander II by remaining neutral in 1877, and in the year when Victoria formally assumed the title of empress of India. Abdulhamid’s council accordingly embraced a strategy of Islamic unity to fend off the inroads of Pan-­ Slavism, drawing significant donations from Indian Muslims and realizing the need to keep London neutral to sustain such contributions. Despite the ongoing efforts of Syed Ahmad Khan to rebut accusations of Muslim infidelity to a Christian ruler, and all while he collected money for Ottoman relief, some colonial servants were anything but neutral.26 In July 1882, the outgoing governor of Bombay Presidency Sir Richard Temple (1826–­1902) described Abdulhamid’s strategy as a new “Pan-­Islamism or Political Muhammadenism” to be watched carefully in India while Great Britain asserted Victoria’s de facto rule of the greatest number of Muslims on the planet.27 The British imposition of a protectorate over Egypt, unfolding just as Temple sent his essays to England and done in the name of Abdulhamid’s [ 14 ]\n\nIntroduction unpopular viceroy, Tawfiq (r. 1879–1892), guaranteed ready access to the Indian Ocean for the Union Jack thereafter. It also sped the transformation of an Asian empire into an Afro-­Asian one. What had been begun from Bombay by such hands as Temple’s predecessor, Henry Bartle Frere (1815–­ 1884), would eventually be completed from London.28 Of course there were still remnant sites of rival colonial power into the 1880s, from Portuguese Mozambique, Diu, Daman, and Goa, to French Pondicherry, and the sprawling Netherlands Indies with its capital Batavia—­the “Queen City of the East,” as one guidebook termed it.29 But all these entities were relative supplicants forced to watch as British-­owned ships fed the lion’s share of raw products to the smokestacks of Manchester and Liverpool. At the same time, Muslim rulers such as Sultan Barghash of Zanzibar (r. 1870–­1888), Nizam Mahbub Ali Khan of Hyderabad (r. 1869–­1911), and Abu Bakar of Johor (r. 1862–­1893) carved out spaces for themselves in respectful British orbit. Barghash, for instance, had gone from being an exile in Frere’s Bombay in the 1860s to the modernizer of his capital’s port in the 1870s, to the benefit of British shipping. Similarly tied to Great Britain, Mahbub Ali Khan’s ancestors had recruited Arab soldiers from Hadramawt in the wake of the 1819 defeat of the Marathas, and they had proven loyal to Great Britain in 1857. Some veterans and active officers alike returned to Arabia to found pro-­British polities such as Quʿayti Mukalla. It became a protectorate in 1888 at the expense of the Kathiri hinterland, whose similarly Hyderabadi sultan had forged a relationship with the Ottomans in 1867—­back when Sultan Abdulaziz had sent steamships of his own to the Indian Ocean. Not that all Indian Ocean sovereigns felt that they had to choose between Victoria and Abdulhamid. The khedives of Egypt remained Ottoman subjects whose lands hosted Christians and sometimes Anglophile Muslims drawn from the neighboring Levant. Barghash, too, had started a process of engaging with the Ottomans, making the hajj in 1877 and accepting a Mecidiye medal from Abdulhamid—­but not his claims to overlordship.30 Fifteen years on, Abu Bakar of Johor, enriched by the export of the natural rubber that coated the world’s first web of submarine cables, would pay his respects to Abdulhamid as commander of the faithful, being similarly awarded the Mecidiye. Stopping at Cairo on the way there, Abu Bakar had also made sure to meet with Muhammad ʿAbduh (1849–1905), the spokesman for a new Muslim reformism that embraced modernity and claimed to remove the needless accretions of ages past, from the Sufism of preceding generations to the [ 15 ]\n\nIntroduction pretensions of the sayyids, who demanded that their hands and hems be “kissed” by all and sundry. The almost universally colonized Muslims of the world needed reform, ʿAbduh argued, to be enacted at the level of the self and the community before being able to reclaim the reins of self-­government. The followers of thinkers like ʿAbduh and his many Indian analogues (and predecessors) would finally be forced to choose sides between imperial ideologies in the Great War once the Ottoman Shaykh al-­Islam declared jihad on behalf of the empire that had joined with Germany in November 1914. This alliance—­charted by the ironically named Committee for Union and Progress—­and the ensuing defeat had a profound impact on the aspirations of subrulers of the Arabian Peninsula such as Sharif Husayn of Mecca and Sultan Sir Ghalib at Mukalla. Most threw their lot in with London and thus joined Aden, Bombay, and Singapore. The Kathiris of hinterland Hadramawt also turned to Great Britain as they began to look anxiously at the returnees from distant Jawa. While neutral in the war, the Dutch had allowed the growth of what some sayyids saw as an egalitarian incubus. In their view, too many émigrés, once deemed little higher in station than “tribals” in Arabia, had profited under Western empire in the verdant East, and now they were back to change their home societies with the same schools and thought that had been embraced by their “Malay” or “Jawi” cousins. Salih bin ʿAbdat, with his Turkish buttons, was one such potentially threatening product. The two edges of the Indian Ocean must never have seemed so close, or threatening, bound by an empire without rival that suffocated the last gasps of the Ottoman Empire and yet claimed to be strictly neutral in matters of religion. For their part, the Dutch held on in the East and continued to foster reformist voices that seemed to harmonize with their own rhetoric of confessionalized equality. But if equality seemed fine in principle, growing local calls for independence would be crushed in the 1920s, especially once the Great Depression began to bite everywhere, exacerbating communal divides in Zanzibar, Colombo, and Rangoon, to give but three examples. As Asia edged toward total war in the 1930s, a new constellation of empire taking shape at Tokyo would lay claims to commonality that excluded the Westerner and the Eurasian. Its propagandists, furthermore, looked askance at Arabs as they tried to bend Muslims to their will. And just as Arabs were becoming ever more Asian outsiders on the Swahili coast, they found it harder to mix in in Indonesia unless they became Indonesian, too. [ 16 ]\n\nIntroduction\n\nA Much-­Churned Sea I have laid out the synoptic history above as a fragment of the larger account rendered by many before me, and not always with an eye to Islamic interactions. Over the past decades a number of scholars, including K. N. Chauduri, Sanjay Subrahmanyam, and Christopher Bayly, plotted the steady rise of the European commercial empires (Portuguese, Dutch, and British) binding the interlinked shores, dealing with contestation or accommodation by a range of actors.31 These shores have since been revisited by another generation of writers, with some, such as Elizabeth Lambourn and Sebastian Prange, drawing on the Geniza archives and remnant inscriptions to highlight connectivities in a world “before European hegemony,” to use Janet Abu Lughod’s felicitous phrase, linking Aden to Mangalore through the trade in spices, metals, and textiles.32 Whereas the former grouping of scholars have often emphasized the global economic underpinnings of Western hegemony—­perhaps none more so than Bayly, who saw the period 1780–­1830 as the “axial age” for the making of a modern, almost uniform, world—­the newer generation (and the indefatigable Subrahmanyam) have populated Afro-­Asian coasts and hinterlands with greater detail about the connected social lives, intercultural engagements, and political aspirations of their diverse peoples.33 Much was made possible at new nodal cities by print, as Nile Green reminds us, placing the defenders of what he calls “Customary Islam” alongside the more famous disseminators of reformism such as Syed Ahmad Khan, who hardly envisaged the idea of the independent Muslim state that would be promulgated by Muhammad Iqbal.34 After all, and as Aydin points out, the empires of the mid-­nineteenth century were all multiconfessional, regardless of whether they were ruled by queens or sultans.35 Similarly erasing modern assumptions of a preconceived sectarian divide into the twentieth century, Sugata Bose has set Tagore’s literary offerings alongside narratives of Indian soldiers in Mesopotamia and then those who wedded their struggles to Japanese propaganda. 36 Coming from the southwest of a maritime world expanded by the Portuguese incursions, Isabel Hofmeyr exposes the ambiguities of Gandhi’s years in South Africa as a sometime printer and protégé of Gujarati Muslim businessmen, and at a time when Afro-­Asian solidarity was an afterthought for Indian nationhood.37 [ 17 ]\n\nIntroduction On the other hand, over the past decades, and in densely documented and deft connectings of past and present, Ulrike Freitag and Engseng Ho have reoriented discussion of the Hadrami diaspora that preceded the European ones in Africa and Asia and was curiously late to engage with print and imagine a discrete homeland as more than a sacred setting for the visitation of entombed patriarchs.38 Ho points to the many ways in which Hadrami migrants, almost always male, were adept at marrying into local societies and maintaining their status and distinction across the creolizing generations, sometimes mediating for empire in the outside world and at others times bringing it “home” to resolve their own political crises.39 Similarly, when writing with an eye to East Africa, the Gulf, and pivotal Aden from the nineteenth century, Scott Reese, Matthew Hopper, and Fahad Bishara all consider how diasporic communities—­Omani, Indian, Swahili, and Somali—­have made use of, or even anticipated, empire in staking claims to place, indigeneity, and authority.40 With circulations of Islamic law now strengthened with British certification and registration, the Western Indian Ocean became a venue for the increased movement of African bodies and products whose generation depended on their labor—­such as ivory, dates, pearls, and even spices like cloves, grown on island plantations where once they had been shipped westward from gardens tended by those meeting the demands of the VOC. This circulatory world had long included the Malabar Coast and Lanka, famous for spices of their own, from cardamom and pepper on the mainland to cinnamon on the island, but less well documented in terms of their histories of labor extraction and any Muslim role in such processes. While Nira Wickramasinghe points to all manner of slaveries on Lanka, including its aftereffects within the island’s Tamil-­speaking Muslim community, Wilson Chacko Jacob is curiously uninterested in the aforementioned Sayyid Fadl’s views of the slave trade, whose interdiction by the Ottoman state was so problematic for merchants living in the Hijaz in the 1850s.41 After all, Fadl is better known as a lodestone for Southern Indian and Hadrami Muslims in Mecca, and then as an aspirant peacemaker on the borderlands of Hadramawt and Oman in the 1870s. Over the course of two difficult years, he tried to instantiate Ottoman rule at Dhofar, drawing on the finances of Hyderabad, like the Kathiris before him, and anticipating the more successful Quʿaytis afterward. [ 18 ]\n\nIntroduction As Low has pointed out, Arabia was very much on the fringe of Ottoman imperial governance at the time, and its officials worked hard under Abdulhamid to bring its various shaykhs into more conscious alignment with technological projects and a greater focus on facilitating the hajj, thereby linking up with millions of Indian and Jawi pilgrims and resident scholars.42 There were other patriotic projects to contend with, from that of still Ottoman Egypt, whose advocates such as Mustafa Kamil (1874–1908) also drew Jawi thinkers to Cairo.43 Yet the khedival city was very much ancillary in importance to the mass of pilgrims—­whose experiences of the age of steam have been surveyed by Eric Tagliacozzo.44 Similarly, the pilgrims now barely touched on Ceylon, once a key site of what Ronit Ricci has inscribed as one of banishment and belonging—­where once Jawi soldiers became Malay and subject to Anglo-­Mohammedan law drafted with Northern Indians in mind.45 Such legal requirements, made visible to the colonial eye at moments of marriage and even more so of divorce when questions of inheritance and trust arise, are the grist for Nurfadzilah Yahaya’s recent work exploring Arab engagement with colonial jurisdictions and the rare appearance of daughters and wives in courtrooms.46 It is remarkable that, in light of the long history and historiography sketched above, few scholars have taken up the questions of gender and law in the ways that Yahaya has for Southeast Asia, though the very male bias of migration and even the field into the 1990s explains this to some extent.47 As Ho found during his fieldwork, the home worlds of most Arabs are opaque to male outsiders—­though he learned a little of how women are celebrated and respected. Some wealthy women continued to subsist on rented properties on opposite sides of the ocean; others endowed schools with their passing, with an eye to preserving family as much as Islam. In this regard, I wish to register my own discomfort. Regardless of whether they are Arab or Malay, Javanese, Indian, or African, these are not my stories. My own family history as the descendant of not always willing migrants from Ireland is closely imbricated with the dispossession of others in Australia and North America. In some cases, I am aware that my interpretation is at variance with accepted narratives and cherished dreams. In making use of colonial sources, I am conscious of the agendas underpinning the collection and storage of information, and the very heavily male biases of the narratives. Where possible I try to bring out what fragments I can of the [ 19 ]\n\nIntroduction experiences of the mothers, partners, or daughters of some of those whose lives were documented—­though in the early sources I never knowingly came across a peripatetic maternal saint or many women who left more than their names in the court records or newspapers. Still, there is something to be salvaged in such mentions, whether of the manumitted Sarah van Boegis or Keijda van de Kaap in South Africa; Been and Nilofer, who coordinated petitions on behalf of their husbands on Ceylon; the patient Fatima Ba Mahmush whose eldest children were sent to Tunis; or the now forgotten Sitti Noerdjannah, who wrote articles for the propagandist press during the Japanese occupation. This was, and is, their history, too.\n\nChapter Outline This book is structured in three parts, each comprising four chapters. Part 1 focuses on the alternating transition from VOC to British rule at the Cape of Good Hope, with special attention to the life and struggles of a Moluccan exile and the Afro-­Asian people he inspired—­enslaved and free—­who were in search of princely leaders to call their own. It also historicizes the British stereotyping of Malays, as they called the Muslims of the Indies and the Cape, seemingly prone to violence and yet ideally tamable for the Union Jack, as they certainly would be on Lanka. Indeed, this book suggests that we cannot fully understand the British categorization of Malay without attention to the more westerly and once Dutch possessions in the Indian Ocean. Part 1 ends with the prospect of another empire, that of the Ottomans, that would prove particularly attractive to these Capetonian Muslims, who yet felt some affinity with the wider Jawi world whence their leaders came. Part 2 toggles between the Cape and Ceylon and its role as a historic Muslim connector between Southeast Asia and the Middle East, most especially Egypt, occupied in 1882. Having excavated the parallel Lankan history to that of the Cape, it highlights the distant pull of Istanbul as an Islamic metropole, via a heterogenous set of displacements. These are once more like those of the Cape—­including exiles, former slaves, and teachers—­yet distinct in terms of the island’s swiftly becoming the testing ground of Malay military loyalty in a starkly different context. Rather than constituting the leadership of the Muslim community, they were conspicuous by their numerical insignificance and their difference, given that their fellow [ 20 ]\n\nIntroduction Muslim “Moors” emphasized ancestral linkages to Arabia that few of them claimed, preferring to remember their officer forebears as princes of Java and Makassar. Minor as they were, these figures were the loyal base on which to claim a share of religious independence and recognition by the empire. Having probed both Western extensions of a Malay world, as some now see it, the third and final part of the book brings us back to the wider Jawi homelands in the age of high imperialism to see how the popularization of the Ottoman caliphal ideal played out into World War I, and with very different results depending on which empire held sway. In this part, switching between Dutch Java and British Malaya and tracking individuals like Salih bin ʿAbdat or the Tunisian printer Mohamed Hachemi, we also see how the category of Arabness, once hard to separate from notions of descent from the Prophet, was exploded. At the same time, notions of Jawi identity coalesced anew under Dutch rule as Indonesian-­ness—­distinct from almost-­ British Malayness—­and all just before the arrival of a new empire that posited the primacy of Asia over Islam, with little thought as to how to manage a world of different traditions.\n\n[ 21 ]\n\nPART ONE\n\nWestern Deposits\n\nONE\n\nFrom the Spice Islands to the Place of Sadness\n\nON APRIL 9, 1780, watchers stationed high on the flanks of Cape Town’s Signal Hill caught sight of the Zeepart, a vessel of 1150 tons built six years earlier in Amsterdam for the faltering United East India Company (VOC). The Zeepart had just made a ten-­week journey from the company’s capital of Batavia, over 5,180 nautical miles away, on the northwest coast of Java. Once the pride of its Asian portfolio, Batavia was by then infamous for its dank castle and fetid canals, where about a thousand company servants and their often-­mixed-­race families lived among over two hundred thousand people of other ethnicities. These others were often called “Orientals” (Oosterlingen) or “Indians” (Indianen) by their overlords, with little distinction, save as to whether they were enslaved or free, the former often being taken from hinterland communities, being shoeless, listless, and much abused—­especially if tasked with joining the convicts to dredge the canals, stuff the old walls with unsalable spices, or labor in the shipyards. Most of the free Oosterling majority, by contrast, were Muslims, and their men would gather at mosques outside the western walls on Fridays, given long-­standing laws prohibiting the intramural practice of any faith other than the Calvinism of the States General. Now in Africa and blinking hard after the long sojourn spent largely below deck, one such Oosterling and an all-­too-­brief denizen of sprawling Batavia would have looked out with great apprehension at the spectacular form of Table Mountain, which loomed over the much smaller whitewashed [ 25 ]\n\nFigure 1.1 VOC possessions, 1780.\n\nFrom the Spice Islands to the Place of Sadness and unwalled town counting over seven thousand souls. A middle-­aged man of no great height, Abdallah was no slave. He was a political prisoner who had served as both an imam and a senior counselor at the court of Tidore, located by one of the famous—­a nd equally spectacular—­clove-­bedecked volcanoes of the Spice Islands. Seen from the Cape, though, both Tidore and its neighboring rival Ternate were but tiny dots mapped onto an archipelago that was found another 1,300 nautical miles further east again of distant Batavia. To be sure, Abdallah was but an exilic speck at the southern tip of Africa, one of four new arrivals from his island home whose immediate fate was not to be placed among the squat buildings beneath Table Mountain, nor yet on one of the nearby farms whose vineyards were gaining the colony a name as something more than a provisioning station for ships entering or leaving the Indian Ocean. Rather, Abdallah would soon be placed aboard a smaller vessel and sent to languish on the flat expanses of Robben Island, some eight miles into the bay. There he would meet numerous other such castaways of the Dutch commercial empire and set to work easing the pain of separation by transcribing a Qurʾan from memory. As this chapter will show, the complicated social world of Eastern Indonesia would have its representatives and analogues on the island and at the Cape, with many an exile mixing with people sent from Java, Sulawesi, and the more easterly isles. Equally it will show how Dutch rule in Africa would be disrupted by both an attempted British invasion and the desperate acts of slave and convict alike, in the midst of which Abdallah would sadly pen the pages of a manual of prayer and learning for which he would one day be famous.\n\nOf Tombs, Blessings, and Saintly Precedent Across the Indian Ocean IN THE NAME OF ALLAH, THE BENEVOLENT, THE MERCIFUL Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds, and blessings and peace be upon the noblest of messengers, our lord and master, Muhammad, and upon all his family and friends. O God, I ask You in Your great name, which is that of the Maker of Religion, . . . ​O Lord of [the angels] Gabriel and Michael and Israfil and Azra’il and [the Prophet] Muhammad (God’s peace and blessings be upon him), O Shaper of [ 27 ]\n\nWestern Deposits heaven and earth, O Being of majesty and honor, O God, I ask you for forgiveness and preservation from the torture of the grave and its terrors. O Best of the best and Most Generous of the generous, Lord don’t leave me alone, for You are the greatest of providers. [Written down in] the Christian land, the abode of the accursed, the place of sadness. —­From the sayings of the imam Abdallah, son of the imam and qadi Abd al-­Salam\n\nThis prayer is but one of numerous texts in circulation that are attributed to the now-­sainted Abdallah, better known in Malay as Tuan Guru, the “Lord Teacher,” buried on the lower slopes of Signal Hill in 1807.1 His place of interment was already prestigious at the time, being close by the much-­visited grave of Sayyid ʿAlawi, or Tuan Said, an Arab exile who preceded him at Robben Island from 1744 to 1761. Both were enclosed by whitewashed stone walls that protected them from grazing animals, accessed of an evening by supplicants who entered a low gate and placed colored candles in niches at their heads in quest of blessings and intercession. The Malay teacher and the Arab shaykh make a remarkable pairing, with their tombs perched above the city, intertwining oral histories, and the curious visitation of outsiders in search of the picturesque. The first saint, reputedly from Mocha, in Yemen, had his own experience in Java as counselor to the sultan of Mataram, in central Java, before the eruption of the cataclysmic Chinese War in 1741–­1743, though that apparently counted less at the Cape over time than the fact of his descent from the Prophet.2 Meanwhile, Tuan Guru’s name is reported today more fully as Abdallah bin Qadi Abd al-­Salam—­ that is, Abdallah, the son of the qadi Abd al-­Salam. And he, too, is gaining a reputation by turns as having been the descendant of the Prophet via the long oasis valley of Hadramawt in modern-­day Yemen. Indeed, my first encounter with the African legacy of Tuan Guru came at the generous hands of a descendant curious to know whether Tuan Guru and, thus, she and her children were connected to the Prophet. Already convinced of that status and his princely role at Tidore, other relatives—­custodians of several of his manuscripts and treasured possessions—­have engaged with distant family in the Moluccas reconstructing a genealogy that ties their forefather to the Prophet by way of the conjoined princely and saintly lines of Java and Arabia.3 [ 28 ]\n\nFrom the Spice Islands to the Place of Sadness Sayyid or not, Abdallah’s words are now said to take their reciters out of depression, to bring strength and honor to those “forced to eat dirt and live in their own faeces,” to ease the pain of separation, and even to fill the space left by the need for money or housing. Indeed, they are said to help achieve “anything needed in human and spiritual life.” 4 Put another way, the prayer of Tuan Guru offers comfort to a people still dealing with the legacy of slavery under the VOC, the classificatory regimes of the ensuing Batavian and British Empires, the South African Union, the crippling era of apartheid, and ongoing uncertainty under the African National Congress. Tuan Guru and Sayyid ʿAlawi are not the only saints of recourse for Capetonian Muslims. The city and its surrounds are dotted with the tombs of many such exiles from the largely Muslim polities that constituted the archipelagic nation of Indonesia. The most famous of such Capetonian tombs, known by the Malay term kramat—­which derives from the Arabic plural karamat and pays tribute to the “miraculous powers” of their occupants—­is even older still. This one is of Shaykh Yusuf of Makassar (d. 1699), a seasoned traveler of the Indian Ocean who was doubly displaced by the Dutch. Originally from the Makassarese port town and capital of Gowa on the island of Sulawesi, Shaykh Yusuf had studied in Arabia and Syria for many years before his return to the archipelago in the 1670s and his capture in West Java a decade later. Yusuf was first sent to Ceylon with his family and retinue in 1684 as punishment for having led the resistance to Dutch interference in the sultanate of Banten. He and his followers were not entirely isolated there, however, given that the island remained a node of the Indian Ocean Muslim networks. Most likely consigned to Colombo or Galle, Yusuf remained in communication with followers who stopped at the island en route either for the holy places of Arabia or on their way home. From 1688, moreover, he was in close contact with an Indian descendant of the Prophet called Sharif Habibullah. Having departed from Masulipatnam on the Coromandel Coast, Sharif Habibullah had toured Southern Siam and then the sultanates of Jambi and Palembang on Sumatra before going to Cirebon, Java, where he, too, was arrested and banished for fomenting unrest against a VOC client.5 Yusuf’s Dutch captors were already concerned that he was in regular receipt of parcels on Ceylon, and that with his own epistles he might himself be causing further trouble back in Southeast Asia.6 Such was never proven, though he clearly continued to write for a Southeast Asian audience [ 29 ]\n\nWestern Deposits in exile and back home, and in Arabic. As Asyumardi Azra observes, Yusuf took the opportunity to focus on pietistic works, including al-­Nafha al-­ saylaniyya fi al-­minha al-­rahmaniyya: “The Ceylonese Scent Concerning the Merciful Gift.”7 As Yusuf made plain, this was a compilation of mystical teachings that he had transcribed to ease the new situation for himself, his peers, and their eager students.8 Its opening already paints the picture of a small, if hierarchical, community of mystical “seekers” looking for comfort far from home: I have called this modest epistle and charming compilation The Ceylonese Scent Concerning the Merciful Gift which I have written for our group of followers and our seeker friends, and most especially for the lover of the teller of truth (al-­sadiq) among the brethren of God [here], the sincere and simple one . . . ​Abi al-­Siddiq Muhammad Sadiq. . . . ​For as we were in the land of Saylan, [also] known as the Isle of Sarandib, the destination of sinners and abode of the exile (marma al-­maʿasi wa maʾwa al-­gharib) in accordance with God’s primordial decrees and eternal will. . . . ​One of the friends of the group, beloved of this poor and miserable creature who confesses his own ignorance and deficiency, gave permission for a certain one to read with me the Sufi epistles and their like of useful matters concerning religion and the world.9\n\nWhile Yusuf found comfort in contact with his student company and sincere fellow mystics, his despair was laid bare in a letter he wrote to the VOC governors in late 1688 or early 1689. Its gist survives in a Dutch translation: To the honorable lord Joannes Camphuys, Governor General, and to the noble lords of the Council of India at Batavia, may God bless them with long lives. . . . ​ Know that I am Sjeech Josuff, now weak and aged, being moreover so old that I am unable to stand up for a long period of time. [Know too that] I am descended from powerful and influential people—­who had many under their authority—­ not to mention being burdened with children and grandchildren. It thus pains me greatly, being in a strange land and in such miserable circumstances, to beg for mercy: [yet] I admit to being guilty and to having done wrong, to my great regret, and I have sworn never to repeat such. Hence, I pray most earnestly for forgiveness, and that, having atoned for my misdeeds, I might return to Batavia. I warrant that such mercy and beneficence on the part of your noble lords shall be rewarded by the Most High, for while I realize that such a boon would [ 30 ]\n\nFrom the Spice Islands to the Place of Sadness never be pleasurable to you, there is nobody else for me to take recourse to, or under the shadow of whose wings I might seek shelter.10\n\nRather than the mercy of return, Batavia determined in July 1693 that Yusuf was to be kept at a windswept farmstead twenty-­four miles from Cape Town, well outside the Islamicate network that threaded the Indian Ocean, though he retained an impressive retinue of nearly fifty followers, family, and the enslaved. As Saarah Jappie reminds us, the decision of 1693 had been made due to pressure from the Mughal governor of Surat, who had by then brought Sharif Habibullah back to India. From Malabar, Habibullah was petitioning for the release of all the learned Muslim prisoners of the Dutch on Ceylon.11 Thus, it was to Zandvliet, at the Western Cape of South Africa, that Yusuf would be consigned and later die in 1699, leaving behind close to thirty individuals (including fourteen family members) to be repatriated, as well as an unknown number of enslaved people initially ordered to be kept at the Cape for the company’s benefit and to defray the expense of the rest.12 The Dutch minister François Valentijn (1666–­1727), whose first venture in the East began the year after Yusuf’s exile began in Ceylon, would reportedly visit Yusuf’s African grave in 1705. This was en route for his second tour of the Indies, and in ignorance of the nocturnal exhumation of Yusuf ’s remains and their return to Sulawesi with most of his surviving followers the previous year.13 But this is beside the larger point. The dream of a local shepherd later fixed his spiritual presence at what would become a site of Easter visitation in the nineteenth century.14 Yusuf’s grave also emerged as a foundational node in a protective ring that eventually embraced Cape Town, including the resting places of Sayyid ʿAlawi and Tuan Guru. In 1929, the imam of the Lower Chiappini Street Mosque invoked this arc when he claimed that some 260 years beforehand his ancestor Khardi Abdusalam (i.e., Tuan Guru) had told the benighted slaves of his day to be “of good heart,” for one day their liberty would be restored, and their descendants would “live within a circle of kramats safe from pestilence, flood and famine.”15 The imam also told the journalist about the exploits of the adjacent Tuan Said, whose grave was a part of the same circle, though it is worth noting the precedence that Tuan Guru’s name invoked.16 The notion of a protective ring was evidently common currency, as well. After coming across another tomb on the ridge of Signal Hill in 1934, Kathleen Jeffreys (1883–­1968) was similarly eager to lay out the stories of the [ 31 ]\n\nWestern Deposits “tombs of the Holy Circle,” which she serialized in the Cape Naturalist.17 In doing so she drew freely on the documents to which she had access in her day-­to-­day work at the Cape Town archives. But if the famous Shaykh Yusuf was relatively well documented, the more recent points of the circle would present a greater challenge. Indeed, the identity of Tuan Guru was particularly opaque to non-­Muslims in the 1930s. Jeffreys was apparently ignorant of the Cape Times article of 1929 that had placed his arrival around 1770, or perhaps simply that he and “Khardi Abdusalam” were one and the same. Still, there were people to ask. According to an unnamed local authority she interviewed (and whose account she admitted might be questioned): It is said that he was the founder of the first mosque in Cape Town, situated in Dorp Street and still in use. He came from the Dutch East Indies, but why he came to the Cape, or when, is shrouded in mystery. . . . ​Apparently he was a man of education and high moral character. On his arrival here he was shocked to see the low state to which the Moslem faith had sunk among his compatriots, and how neglected were education, culture and religious observance among his people. He set to work to bring about a religious revival. At the time there was no copy of the Koran at the Cape; but fortunately this pious man had memorised the sacred scriptures in his own country, and he set about transcribing them from memory, so that he would be able to impart his knowledge to the rest of the community. Many years after, when copies of the Koran were obtained from Arabia, and compared with his version, it was found that the Guru had made very few errors. Descendants of his are still living at the Cape and one of them is the Imaum (priest) of the Mosque in Dorp Street and the doyen of all the Imaums in Cape Town. He has in his possession the historic copy of the Koran made by his illustrious ancestor.18\n\nActually, the then imam of Dorp Street was not a descendant, and there is some irony to be noted in the fact that Jeffreys had been transcribing documents relating to Tuan Guru for some years, being unaware of his personal name, his association with a 1781 escapee called Abd al-­Rauf, and his perceived threat to the local slave order in 1786. Doubtless Jeffreys—­who would later reflect on her own Anglo-­Indian ancestry—­would have been intrigued to hear the stories circulating about Tuan Guru that claimed he was possessed of a call to prayer so strong it could be heard in Simon’s Town, twenty-­four miles to the south.19 Others celebrated his playful ability to [ 32 ]\n\nFrom the Spice Islands to the Place of Sadness befuddle the colonizers, as when an arrogant Dutch farmer found his potatoes turned to stones for his high-­handed treatment of the aged scholar.20 These stories still circulate, due in part to the publications of the Afrikaner folklorist Izak David du Plessis (1900–­1981), who had a special interest in the “Malays” by virtue of his studies and a key role in the apartheid state.21 Tuan Guru also looms large in the remarkable marriage of oral and archival history performed by Achmat Davids (d. 2012) from the 1980s. While Davids rejected the nomenclature of “Cape Malay” in favor of “Cape Muslim,” he accepted some of Du Plessis’s contentions about Islam in Southeast Asia. Delving among death notices, wills, and court cases once curated by Jeffreys, Davids edged closer to proving just how and when Tuan Guru had transcribed a Qurʾan that was a testament to his endurance of the bleakness of Robben Island and then established a community in the new suburb around Dorp Street. The fruits of these investigations were his seminal studies on the mosques of the Bo-­Kaap and the equally famous graveyard that overlooked them, the Tana Baru, updated most recently by Shafiq Morton in his biography of Tuan Guru.22 Like Morton, Davids had had a good relationship with Tuan Guru’s descendants, most notably the tailor Nurul Erefaan Rakiep, who proudly displayed his treasured heirlooms and his most famous juridical manuscript, identified as the Maʿrifat al-­Islam wa-­l-­iman (The knowledge of Islam and belief). Nurul Erefaan also showed Davids a manual of spells, a predictive die, and even a sword and shield said to have been used in the battle of Blauwberg in January 1806.23 Indeed, Nurul Erefaan, who performed the hajj in 1971, was enchanted by his family’s origin story and often engaged in conversations at the port with visiting Indonesian sailors. In 1980 the Argus ran a feature on him—­sword and shield in hand—­that he later interleaved with the pages of his own synopsis of his ancestor’s life to welcome a delegation of Malaysian visitors in April 1993.24 Also included with these documents was a statement of Tuan Guru’s royal status, vouched for in June 1993 by none other than Sultan Mudaffar Sjah of Ternate (1935–­2015). While one can access this document at the Simon’s Town Heritage Museum, run by the redoubtable Aunt Pattie, the objects relating to Tuan Guru’s precious physical inheritance, and even a photocopy of his compilation deposited at the South African Library, are now overseen by a trust managed by Nurul Erefaan’s sons. Like the trusts established to protect the kramats at Faure and Signal Hill, this ensures that Tuan Guru’s legacy is [ 33 ]\n\nWestern Deposits made legible for respectful inquiry. In the early 2000s, both Auwais Rafudin and the late Seraj Hendricks analyzed the mystical and theological aspects of Tuan Guru’s writings.25 Yet there was then less questioning of the temporal framework laid out by Davids, who had accepted that the compendium was written on Robben Island in 1781, and little awareness of the information subsequently brought to light by the visits to Tidore made by Nurul Erefaan’s son, Muttaqin Rakiep, who studied in both Mecca and Malaysia. The few images of the manuscript in public circulation suggest that the compendium may well have been commenced on Robben Island. But even if it was completed there some years thereafter, Morton and I agree that the bulk of the writing was done in circumstances a little different to those once reported.26 This is not to deny the suffering of Tuan Guru, or the importance and legacy of his mission. Still, it is important to reconcile what information is at hand and to better understand his work and the people around him who accepted his leadership and formed a fully conscious and assertive Muslim community that the British would call “Malay.” It is one of struggle, make no mistake, but it is also one of hope and achievement, echoed time and time again. To proceed, however, we must return to the eastern reaches of archipelagic Asia in the 1770s to see where Tuan Guru came from, and why he was set to follow Shaykh Yusuf and Sayyid ʿAlawi to Africa while other close colleagues and family were kept at Batavia or Colombo.\n\nAnglo-­Dutch Rivalry and the Fate of the Moluccas My Father finished his Letter, charging me never to become an Ally with the Dutch, and to do all in my power to obtain an Alliance with the English. — ­P R I N C E N U K U O F T I D O R E T O A L E X A N D E R S H O R E , 179 6\n\nIn February 1801, Alexander Dalrymple (1736–­1808), the Scots hydrographer and servant of the English East India Company (EIC), completed a memoir concerning the powerful Moluccan prince Kaicili Nuku (ca. 1738–­1805).27 Nuku had been raised on the volcanic island of Tidore, which, with its looming twin of Ternate, lies off the coast of the much larger body of Halmahera in what is today Eastern Indonesia. At the time of Dalrymple’s writing, Nuku [ 34 ]\n\nFrom the Spice Islands to the Place of Sadness had bested the forces of the VOC, subsequently dissolved by the French-­allied Batavian Republic (1795–­1806). By 1797 he claimed mastery over most of the northern Moluccas, a major source of cloves. This victory had come after nearly two decades of conflict and was furthermore sealed by a pragmatic alliance with the British in line with the advice of his late father, the deposed Sultan Gamal al-­Din (r. 1757–­1778, d. 1783), which had been given in a letter smuggled from exile in Batavia sometime after 1778. Gamal al-­Din had found himself at Batavia together with another former ruler, Muhammad Sah al-­Din, the erstwhile sultan of Bacan. Both had been accused of dealing with slave raiders coming from the Sulu Sultanate of what is now the Southern Philippines. Even worse in Dutch eyes at the time, Gamal al-­Din had been treating with the British, who in 1773 had founded a base on the island of Balambangan, which lay in Sulu territory.28 The Dutch had good reason to be suspicious, as the Tidorese had first decided to explore an alliance after receiving a letter from Dalrymple’s friend and fellow Scot Thomas Forrest (1729–­1802), who had established the Balambangan outpost at Dalrymple’s suggestion. But while Nuku claimed that the Malay-­speaking Forrest had made an overture to the Tidorese in 1777, Dalrymple deduced that the offer must have come when Forrest was first exploring the islands off New Guinea between 1774 and 1776.29 It is noteworthy that Forrest did so in a Sulu-­built garay called the Tartar and crewed by a mixture of people whom many Britons would call “Malays.” It was furthermore piloted by the trusted Tuan Hajji Ismail, a relative of Muhammad Sah al-­Din of Bacan who had previously worked for the Dutch, and who related the Muslim history of the region from its purported conversion by a sharif of Mecca, the holy city where he had himself made the pilgrimage. Certainly he gave great deference to their steersman and “kind of Musulmen priest,” whom Forrest only knew as Tuan Imum.30 Many of the Tartar’s mixed crew of Malays, Visayans, and Lascars were Tuan Hajji Ismail’s personal “vassals and slaves,” whom he paid directly, and whose “liberties” Forrest learned to ignore.31 There was no denying that “Ishmael Tuan Hadjee,” as Forrest knew him, was a man of authority and charisma. He was extremely well connected throughout all the islands east of Sulawesi, where the interlinked sultans of the Moluccas had extensive and cascading personal networks of vassals who were required to supply tribute in the form of large, rowed vessels known as kora-­kora—­filled with warriors, forest products, and captives. [ 35 ]\n\nWestern Deposits Although Forrest had passed Tidore on the way to Bacan in late 1774, contact was first initiated with a Ternaten kora-­kora under Dutch flag at Dory, near present day Manokwari, on February 1.32 The following month, Forrest was surprised at Esbe, on the island of Misool, by the arrival of another kora-­kora from the Tidorese. After salutes and during their friendly discussions, the Tidorese officers now warned the EIC captain that the Dutch were searching for him. The grateful commander offered customary presents of cloth, flints, and probably compasses (of which he had many for just such a purpose). He also sent the Sultan Gamal al-­Din a further “handsome present”—­though Forrest later claimed that he had only ever written to formally request that Gamal al-­Din’s subjects might supply him with food and water.33 The die was cast. It was also a sign of things to come at Esbe that Forrest met with the “consort” of the banished raja of “Salwatty” (Salawati), a nearby dependent of Tidore’s rival Ternate, whom Forrest was told had been tricked and exiled to the Cape of Good Hope in 1770.34 Lacking Forrest’s original letter to Tidore, one might well wonder what he had offered Gamal al-­Din, for there must have been some expectation of reciprocity for their aid. Such confused dealings were a part of local diplomacy when individuals wore many hats as they traveled through islands bound by multiple and cascading sovereignties.35 If Forrest had represented the British company state on this occasion, this was not always so unambiguously the case. His portrait for the flyleaf of the later Voyage from Calcutta to the Mergui Archipelago (1792) shows him in an alternate role, now decorated as an orang kaya, or “notable,” of the Sumatran sultanate of Aceh, where he had ended his mission in 1776.36 Beyond this, many EIC officials like Forrest and the country traders who resembled them were in the habit of making offers to such sovereigns that they disingenuously argued were not to be interpreted as alliances. Ten years on, in 1786, Calcutta would offer Tidore a company flag as a token of friendship, though not, it was emphasized, as a symbol of any formal alliance—­or not then, anyway.37 By contrast, some 1800 miles to the west, Forrest’s associate Francis Light (1740–­1794) would represent himself to the very Malay sultan of Kedah as an emissary of the EIC, obtaining a concession to the island of Penang that same year after implying that it would lead to British protection from the exactions of the vastly more powerful Buddhist rulers of Siam and Burma.38 Whereas no such formal alliance with the EIC had been on offer to Nuku’s father in 1775, Sultan Gamal al-­Din had decided to pursue the possibility. He [ 36 ]\n\nFrom the Spice Islands to the Place of Sadness first sent a ship to look for Forrest near the island of Fao, off Gebe and halfway to New Guinea. Failing to find him there, Gamal al-­Din dispatched Hajji Usuf—­whose title showed that he had been to Mecca like Forrest’s pilot, Hajji Ismail—­on a further mission to locate the Scotsman and hand him a letter proposing an alliance with Great Britain. Unluckily, that mission was intercepted by the Dutch, who determined to obtain fresh concessions from their exposed vassals. As Nuku had it, writing from his own Papuan stronghold many years later, the Dutch, with the incriminating letter in hand, had tricked his father and the crown prince into crossing to the rival shores of Ternate: The Dutch asked him, wherefore he had written inviting the English to an alliance with him? Showing him the Letter he had delivered in charge with Hadjee Usoffe, he answered it was very true, that they were worn out by the Tyranny of the Dutch, and wished to form an alliance with the English, of whom they had heard all that was good: That when the Dutch proposed first to him, and then to Raja Mooda [the Crown Prince], to let them return on condition that either of them would accept of being Sultan of the little Island of Teedoré alone, and that all the Rajah’s of his extensive Domains should pay their Annual Tribute to their Governor at Ternaté; but both my Father and Brother rejected this with Scorn, and preferred to submit to the Sentence passed on them, of banishment and Imprisonment for Life. My Father finished his Letter, charging me never to become an Ally with the Dutch, and to do all in my power to obtain an Alliance with the English.39\n\nBeyond the demotion and loss of their numerous Papuan vassals, Gamal al-­ Din’s refusal was based on the principal that making Tidore subservient to Ternate would have upset a calibrated relationship that had existed for centuries.40 So it was that Gamal al-­Din was taken with two of his sons (the Raja Muda Kamal al-­Din and his brother Zayn al-­Abidin), his four chief advisors (including the future Tuan Guru), and the women of their various families into what Nuku had first imagined was a short period of exile at Batavia, where many would stay until early 1780.41 Nuku claimed that he had awaited his father for five years until he received the letter urging him to seek an alliance with Great Britain. Yet it was already apparent at the April 1780 installation of Gamal al-­Din’s successor, Sultan Patra Alam (r. 1780–­1783), that there would be no return from dank Batavia. [ 37 ]\n\nWestern Deposits A verbose Dutch declaration marking the occasion makes repeated reference to the former ruler of Tidore, his sons, and their advisors, accusing them of betraying the original VOC agreement of 1667 and creating a state of anarchy by working with Sulu pirates, Spaniards, and even Englishmen. Governor-­ general Reinier de Klerck (r. 1777–­1780) therefore decided that they had forfeited all rights to Dutch “friendship,” rendering their island an ally no more, but a reduced vassal.42 Worse still for Gamal al-­Din, the VOC had already decided that his two eldest sons should be sent to Ceylon along with two sons of the sultan of Bacan. According to Ary Huysers, chief scribe to De Klerck, the elder prince—­ whom the Dutch believed to be behind the entire affair—­had begged him to intercede from prison before he was dispatched to Ceylon, though without two of his daughters, who had shared his cell but soon died at Batavia.43 Similarly, on January 20, 1780, the council had determined that “the Tidorese statesmen”—­Gamal al-­Din’s nephew Qadi Abd al-­Rauf, the secretary Nur Iman, our Imam Abdallah, and his scribe Badr al-­Din—­would be banished to the Cape of Good Hope.44\n\nJava, the VOC, and the Politics of Exile As we saw with the story of Shaykh Yusuf, there was long-­standing precedent for such exilic punishment that is arguably worth exploring in more detail to understand the changes occurring in the 1770s and 1780s. Almost from its inception as a provisioning station in 1652, the African outpost of the VOC had received a stream of important figures who had crossed the Dutch or their allies in Asia—­f rom Lanka and the Coromandel Coast, to Sumatra, Sulawesi, Timor, and the Moluccas. In the wars of succession on Java in the early 1700s, and then again as the Chinese emerged as a decisive force on that island during the tumultuous 1730s and 1740s, the sultans of Java would consign or lose family members there, with parents and children often separated between island and cape. Such figures were a minority among many thousands of slaves and discarded servants of returning officials, whom the Dutch were also generally careful to separate from the exiles. Some, such as Prince Dipanagara of Mataram, exiled in 1723, were placed on farms at a distance from the town, together with their retainers and families. Others were confined to the castle [ 38 ]\n\nFrom the Spice Islands to the Place of Sadness in solitude, as with Cakraningrat IV of Madura, who had hoped to claim the throne of Mataram in the wake of the Chinese War of 1741–­1743. Exiled in 1746, he would die in Africa in 1748 while his eldest sons remained on Ceylon.45 Another more proximate example to Tuan Guru’s time who further impacted his own life was Raden Mas Kareta, sometimes called Bagus Kareta. His family story is perhaps the most extreme intergenerational example of exilic displacement in VOC history. Kareta was born at Batavia in 1733 as the son of another banished prince, Pangeran Arya Mangkunegara of Mataram, with whom he went to Ceylon in exile as an infant that year.46 After the 1739 death of his father, Kareta was among surviving family members brought to Java in 1741—­but only as far as Batavia Castle, where they were kept at VOC convenience and due to the war that had broken out with Pakubuwana II.47 By 1750, he and at least two fellow returnee brothers were potential candidates for the throne, or deemed a risk to the state. Accused of involvement in a murder, two older brothers were sent back to Ceylon while the younger and apparently more headstrong Kareta was sentenced on March 13, 1750, to be deposited further away again at the Cape, where he arrived with a small retinue in January 1751. After some initial struggles there, he was given a monthly allowance of 5 rixdollars (or 12.5 guilders). Put in the context of the times, this was slightly more than the wage of an able seaman or lance corporal, who both earned 12 guilders per month until the 1780s.48 Still, it is apparent that the teenaged Kareta avoided the heaviest of punishments, and that he had some resources. He is to be found in the Capetonian archives eight years later in 1759, when he manumitted a slave, Sarah van Boegis, and her young son Amsterdam, with surety supplied by himself and the burgher Frans Lens (d. 1775).49 There is the strong likelihood that Sarah was also his partner, known as Sara van Batavia, with whom he borrowed over 210 guilders from another burgher, Joachim Nicolaus van Dessin (d. 1761), perhaps to subsidize her freedom.50 The Dutch-­speaking Kareta was evidently well connected, or as well connected as an exile could be at the Cape. He was reputedly friendly with successive governors Rijk Tulbagh (1699–­1771) and Joachim van Plettenberg (1739–­1793). Tulbagh even supported Kareta’s petitions for financial support in 1756 and a return to Java in 1765, and we can assume that he had some freedom in the town. 51 Kerry Ward has also suggested that Kareta was the host of religious gatherings, such as the celebration of the birth of the [ 39 ]\n\nWestern Deposits Prophet witnessed at a private home in 1772 by Carl Peter Thunberg (1743–­ 1828). At that time the naturalist Thunberg marked that the “principal man of the congregation” who had accompanied odes of praise with his violin had been “a prince of Java, who had opposed the interests of the Dutch East India Company, and had been brought from his native country to the Cape, where he live[d] at the Company’s expense.”52 Compared to the elite Dipanagara and Kareta, though, if exiles to the Cape were deemed akin to dangerous convicts, or if they broke the conditions of their confinement, they were put on Robben Island in Table Bay, where the environment stood in stark contrast to the fertile mainland. Such was the unenviable—­a nd probably unexpected—­fate of Abdallah and his Tidorese peers. Having left a typically humid Batavia on January 26, the four statesmen would have been aghast at the brisk conditions of the new home that they were assigned on April 13. This was four days after the Zeepart had anchored, with them being brought ashore two days later. Abdallah later claimed in his first letter to his relatives in the Indies—­including his brother, the then–­Kapitan Laut of Tidore—­that they had then been deposited on the island “after a single day and a night,” whereupon they were each given a salary of 5 riyals per month, “without any of us being forced to work doing Company business.”53 It was also in this letter that he spelled out a now forgotten pair of relationships between the exiles, describing the “secretary” Nur Iman as the scion of the Qadi Tun Abd al-­Rauf, and the scribe Badr al-­Din as having been a preacher (khatib) and his very own son (anakku).54\n\nRobben Island, April 1780 At first glance, and given past practice, Robben Island had probably not been a part of Batavia’s plan for the Tidorese. With their open-­ended sentences, and the fact that they were each to be sustained by a monthly income—­the same amount awarded to Kareta in 1756—­these were no common criminals. Yet they were hardly well off. Given slow shifts in VOC pay, Abdallah’s salary was now roughly halfway between the monthly income of a ship’s boy and a regular sailor.55 There was little to buy, anyway, beyond what food was brought from the mainland. It is also clear that the authorities had a"
