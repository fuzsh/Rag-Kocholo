        "text": "Cinema Release Dated : August 2010\n\nDirected by : Hanung Bramantyo\n\nProducer : MVP Pictures\n\nProduction : Raam Punjabi\n\nOriginal Sound track : Tuhan Maha Cinta by Nidji\n\nThe Review of the film will be viewed from the three sides :\n\nThe Muhammadiyah movement in its Socio Cultural, Religious & Political Context.\n\nThe Influence of The Middle East Ulama & Modern Scholar on Ahmad Dahlan Islamic Thought.\n\nResponse of Aristocrats, Religious leaders and Society.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nSang Pencerah is a kind of film that can be classified into a documentary film as the commemoration of a century of Muhammadiyah movement that was held in 2010. The title of the film is “Sang Pencerah” that is closely related to the founding father of Muhammadiyah Movement Kiyai Haji Ahmad Dahlan who had new brighter view of the Islamic teaching or knowledge. Kiyai Haji Ahmad Dahlan was born in 1868 in Kauman, Yogyakarta. He was born into a well-respected religious family, and was brought up in a religious milieu. His father, Kiyai Haji Abu Bakr, son of Kiyai Haji Sulaiman, was a Khatib, or a Friday sermon giver of the Sultanate mosque. His mother, was a daughter of Kiyai Haji Ibrahim, a Penghulu Kesultanan of the Sultanate of Yogyakarta,\n\nAhmad Dahlan, like most of the Javanese children from religious families at that time did not go to a government school. He was a victim of the Dutch Colonial Government Education policy that did not allow him to receive modern education. The Dutch Colonial Government schools were not provided to natives who were not of the aristocratic class such as Ahmad Dahlan, but rather to European or Cristian so as to fulfill the need for lower level native officials, who were recruited from the aristocratic families.\n\nTherefore, Ahmad Dahlan got a traditional Islamic education. He received his elementary education from his father. Then he continued studying tafsir, hadith, fiqh, and Arabic guidance of certain ulama in Yogyakarta and its surroundings. He also studied ilmu falak (astronomy) from Kiyai Haji Dahlan of Semarang, and Shaikh Muhammad Jamil Jambek of Bukit Tinggi. After obtaining his basic religious educationand with the financial support of his older sister, Nyai Haji Saleh, he went to Mecca in 1990 at the age of 22, and stayed there for one year. Around 1903, he again visited Mecca, stayed there for two years and studied underthe guidance of Shaikh Ahmad Khatib. In Mecca, he deepened his knowledge of tafsir, tawhid, fiqh, tasawwuf, hadith and al-falak, and some other Islamic subjects. Among the works which had the most influence on him a this time was the tafsir al-Manar of Muhammad Abduh.\n\nAfter his father passed away in 1896, he was appointed a successor as a khatib of the Great Sultanate Mosque to replace his father and he was known as Khatib Amin. There were some other Khatib at the Sultanate Mosque who were obliged among their other tasks, to give sermons during Friday congregational prayer. As a Sultanate official responsible for practices, he saw some odd traditions which he felt should be eliminated. Because of this, he tried to discuss the issue of the incorrect qiblah (directions towards the Ka’bah) of the Sultanate Mosque with some other Khatibs, but no respons.They though that such a problem was under the jurisdiction of Kiyai Haji Kamaluddiningrat, the Kepala Penghulu (the Head Penghulu), their employer and that he should be approached on the matter.\n\nSome incidents that made the relations between Ahmad Dahlan and The Head Penghulu was inharmonious. The first one was about the changed of the incorrect direction of qiblah by Ahmad Dahlan that made the Head Penghulu was in anger. Secondly, was about the renovation of his own langgar to change the qiblah into its right direction, then the Head Penghulu ordered to destroy his langgar. The third one was the determination of the Id-al Fithr which was indifference with certain ulamas of Yogyakarta. But after consulting with the other ulama, then the Sultan with their agreement, accepted Ahmad Dahlan’s opinion. Ahmad Dahlan also attracted attention in this period by giving pengajian for Muslim women outside their house. At that time, public opinion indicated that women should stay at home, nevertheless Ahmad Dahlan had a different opinion. According to him women, like men, were allowed to go out to study. In this case he had brightened up in all aspects especially education. He had done what he thought was right not through writing it in philosophical, theoretical and persuasive treatises, but by simply and directly and personally doing it.\n\n2. The Enlightment of Ahmad Dahlan and Its Societal Reactions\n\na. Socio-cultural religious and political context\n\nBased on the socio-cultural background that Indonesian people’ s religion was mostly Hindu and Buddha. Therefore, a very strong influence of these beliefs cannot be denied such as asking for the blessing from the late of the great ulama and para wali by visiting their cemetery, in practices people still believes to the fortune teller, bad day and good day, tahayul, weton, fasting in their weton day in order to get a succeed etc. There are also people who still give offerings to their ancestors’ souls that can be categorized as syirik, tahlilan of a three days, seven day, a hundred, a thousand day of the dead. These practices are against the Islamic teachings principles as shown in those surahs: Al-Fatihah ayat 5, Al-Baqarah ayat 286, Al-An,am ayat 164, and An-Najm ayat 39. (2005:102).\n\nBesides, there is still a belief in our islamic society in order our praying can be accepted by Allah, so that we have to use a moderator or washilah that will connect us to Allah such as by using washillah of Abd. Kadir Jaelani, our prophets, the angels, and auliya (the representatives or para waliyullah). This teaching cannot be found in Islam, The fact is, based on the concept of Islam is we are muslim people really close to Allah, thus, it is not necessary to use the moderator. We can directly ask everything through praying to Allah as stated in Al-Baqarah ayat 186, Al-Hadid ayat 4, Al- Waqiah ayat 85. (2005 :102).\n\nRealizing these conditions, Ahmad Dahlan tried hard to purify the syncretized religious practices by returning to true source of Islam Al-Qur’an and Al-Hadith/Sunna, as stated : “Ketidak murnian amalan Islam akibat tidak dijadikannya Al Qur’an dan as-Sunnah sebagai satu-satunya rujukan oleh sebagian besar umat Islam Indonesia.”(2005:101).\n\nThese are three basic principles of Islamic societal movement :\n\n– Ask people to return to the true source of Islam, Al Qur’an and Al-Hadith purely and consistently.\n\n– Open the door of ijtihad widely to anyone who has the right to do it\n\n– Apply the Islamic teaching consistently and remove from various kinds of syirik, khurafat , bid’ah and taqlid.\n\nIn this context, on the issue of the stagnation of Islamic thought, he called for muslims to avoid taqlid buta (blind imitation). He also succeeded in promoting the revival of the spirit of ijtihad. His first efforts was to reawaken the conviction in the lives of muslims to work towards the purification of the religious teachings that were derived from the Qur’an and Hadith and it should be removed from the influence of the traditions of their forefathers. Thus, he tried to rebuild tawhid as the foundation of Muslim life.\n\nAs stated by Jainuri (1992:47) below that based on the resolution of the 38th Congress at Ujung Pandang in 1971 that :\n\n“1. The Muhammadiyah is an Islamic missionary movement which dedicates its activities to the service in every aspect of human life and society, having no organizational ties and being non-affiliated with any political party or any other organization whatsoever. 2. Every Muhammadiyah member, has, according to his fundamental laws, the right to join or not join any other organization as long as there is no deviation from the Statute, By laws and other valid regulations within the organization of the Muhammadiyah.”\n\nIt is clear that the Muhammadiyah is a non-political movement. However, this does not mean that the movement is blind to politics, but rather it leaves political matters to its member on an individual basis. The fact is, Muhammadiyah itself has recommended every member to have knowledge of politics and political life. As an example, Ahmad Dahlan himself joined Budi Utomo (1908) and Sarekat Islam (1911). His involvement in this organization, however, was not separated from his religious mission of proselytizing Islam among the middle class and, especially in the midst of the Dutch-educated Indonesians belonging to the Budi Utomo. General socio-political climate of Indonesia that was characterized by the presence of the Dutch Islamic Policy, the rise Indonesian nationalism, the activities of the Christian missionaries, and the influence of Middle Eastern ideas and movements accelerated the process of the establishment of the Muhammadiyah. Then, on November 18, 1912, the Muhammadiyah was established in Yogyakarta.\n\nb. Influence of the Middle –East ulama and modern scholars on Ahmad Dahlan’s Islamic thought.\n\nAccording to the formulation decided in its Muktamar Tajrih 1989, held in Malang , the Muhammadiyah translates tajdid as pemurnian (purification) and pembaharuan (modernization). In purification aspect, the movement was inspired by writings of Ahmad ibn Hanbal who fought against Mu’tazili rationalism by Ibn Taymiya, he was a mujadid or a reformer who was opposed to popularized Sufism, he was also the first person who announced in high spirit that he door for ijtihad was still open widely, he also got the title as mujtahid who always asked and persuaded people to leave odd practices of Islamic teachings. It was also influenced by Muhammad Ibn Wahab (1703-1787) who led the campaign against the corrupted in Islamic belief. Their movement were clearly oriented to the reformation of Islam. Wahab was influenced by the teachings of Ibn Taimiya. The main aim of the movement was to restore the faith to purify the laxity and corruption of its teachings.\n\nThe next person who influenced the movement of Muhammadiyah was Sayed Jamaludin Al-Afghany, he was named : “the wild man of genius”. He wrote the famous Tafsir Al Manar (that was firstly written by Rasyid Ridla).. Al-Afghany was the third founding father (1838-1897) of Salaf movement. The first founding father was : Rasyid Ridla (1856-1935), Second : Syekh Muhammad Abduh\n\n(1849-1905).\n\nThe influence of these Middle-East scholars broadened Ahmad Dahlan’s religious thought. Due to his curiosity to get more knowledge, then he went on pilgrimage to Mecca to get in touch with them.\n\nThen, returning to Yogjakarta, his main intention was to restore Hinduism contaminated Islamic Faith and to purify the religious practices from syncretism and other cultural influences which are against the Islamic teachings. Finally, dated on December 27, 1961, through Presidential decision no. 657 Ahmad Dahlan was declared as a national patriot that was based on the consideration that he had pioneered the awakening of Indonesian Muslim.\n\nc. Responses of aristocrats religious leader and society toward Ahmad Dahlan’s religious reform\n\nAs one characteristic of Muhammadiyah is Amr- ma’ruf nahy munkar that means enjoining the good and forbidding the wrong. In relation to this, Ahmad Dahlan tried hard to make wrong things to become right, though he got some opponents. The fact, as has been stated above there were some incidents when he tried to change the direction of qiblah at the Great Sultanate mosque, and his own langgar then his langgar was destroyed. Then, when he was indifference about the calculation of determinatation idl-al-fithr. These three incidents caused him not inharmony with Kiyai Penghulu Kamaluddiningrat. Not only that, he also gave a pengajian to Muslim women outside their houses because he was in the opinion that women has the same right as men, they are also allowed to study, for this he got a threatening letter. Because of those indifferences he was ever called kiyai kafir. But Ahmad Dahlan did not care about what they had done to him.\n\nThese actions of Ahmad Dahlan might be interpreted as the first steps towards his religious revolution, as protests against the wide extent of incorrect and heterodox practices and beliefs among the Indonesian Muslims. These were the signs of the birth of liberalism of religious thought and furthermore were proofs of the beginning of the breakdown of monocultural religious thought into a more variegated one.\n\nAt last, through the expansion of various endeavors of the movement, Ahmad Dahlan demonstrated that he had given an appropriate diagnosis as well as a solution to the problem which were faced by Indonesian Muslims at that time. He also showed an integral methodology in interpreting the of Islam in the context of the challenges in modern development. The development was also followed by significant progress in its social, educational and religious activities."
