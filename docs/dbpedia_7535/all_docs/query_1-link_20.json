        "text": "In Indonesia, women have been actively involved in dakwah, or Islamic preaching and propagation, since the early 20th century.\n\nOne of the pioneering figures of women’s dakwah in Indonesia was Nyai Ahmad Dahlan, the wife of the founder of Muhammadiyah, one of the largest Islamic organizations in the country. Nyai Ahmad Dahlan was known for her piety, knowledge, and social activism, and she played a key role in spreading Muhammadiyah’s teachings to women and children.\n\nIn the years following Indonesia’s independence in 1945, women’s dakwah continued to grow and diversify. Women’s organizations like Aisyiyah, the women’s wing of Muhammadiyah, and Fatayat NU, the women’s wing of Nahdlatul Ulama, another large Islamic organization, became prominent voices in the Islamic community. These organizations focused on a range of activities, from providing religious education and social services to advocating for women’s rights and empowerment.\n\nIn recent years, women’s dakwah in Indonesia has taken on new forms, particularly with the rise of social media. Many women have taken to platforms like Instagram and YouTube to share their knowledge of Islam and promote a more inclusive and progressive understanding of the religion. Some of these women have gained large followings, and their influence has helped to challenge traditional gender norms and empower women in the Muslim community.\n\nOverall, women’s dakwah in Indonesia has played an important role in shaping the country’s Islamic landscape and promoting a more inclusive and diverse understanding of Islam. While there are still challenges and obstacles to women’s full participation in religious life, the contributions of women in dakwah have been essential in creating a more vibrant and dynamic Islamic community in Indonesia.\n\nThe Role of Women’s Organizations\n\nIn Indonesia, there are various women’s organizations that focus on dakwah activities.\n\nOne of the prominent organizations is Aisyiyah, the women’s wing of Muhammadiyah, one of the largest Islamic organizations in the country. Aisyiyah is actively involved in various dakwah activities, such as organizing religious classes, seminars, and workshops, as well as social and charity programs.\n\nOther women’s organizations that are active in dakwah activities include Fatayat NU, the women’s wing of Nahdlatul Ulama, another major Islamic organization in Indonesia. Fatayat NU is known for its efforts to promote the role of women in Islamic society and to empower them through education and economic initiatives.\n\nApart from these large organizations, there are also many smaller women’s groups and individual activists who are involved in dakwah activities. They use various approaches to spread Islamic teachings, including social media, online classes, and community outreach programs.\n\nOverall, women’s dakwah activities in Indonesia play an essential role in promoting Islamic teachings and values, empowering women, and strengthening community ties.\n\nIn Indonesia, there is a well-known Muslim female teacher named Halimah Alaydrus who has a significant influence on Muslim women in general. Additionally, Nur Rofiah is recognized in academic circles. Rofiah’s approach to Islam emphasizes the importance of tolerance, compassion, and social justice. She is known for her work in promoting women’s rights, advocating for the rights of women, and speaking out against extremism and intolerance.\n\nPublic Figures Or Artists As Female Preachers\n\nIn recent years, there has been a trend of public figures and artists in Indonesia, including women, becoming preachers or dakwah activists. Some of them have a large following and are well-known for their religious teachings.\n\nOne example is Ustadzah Mamah Dedeh, who gained popularity as a religious preacher through her appearance in thirteen television programs. She is known for her humorous and relatable approach to teaching Islamic values and has a large following among Muslim women.\n\nAnother well-known example is Ustadzah Oki Setiana Dewi, a former actress who has become a popular religious preacher. She is known for her lectures on family and marriage, and she has written several books on the topic.\n\nSimilarly, Ustadzah Khadijah Peggy Melati Sukma and Neno Warisman, a veteran actress and singer, has also become a prominent women preacher in Indonesia. She often speaks at Islamic events and has published several books on religious topics.\n\nThere are also other public figures who have become known for their religious preaching, including Dian Pelangi, a famous Indonesian fashion designer who is also a Muslim preacher. She has been involved in various dakwah activities, including giving lectures on Islamic fashion and wearing hijab.\n\nA Personal Ode to Bahasa Indonesia\n\nThe Effect of Social Media\n\nThese women preachers from public figures or artists often attract a different audience and bring a fresh perspective to dakwah activities. They also use their public platforms to spread religious messages and promote Islamic values, inspiring many women to deepen their faith and become active in their communities.\n\nFinally, women’s roles in dakwah in Indonesia have developed and grown over time. They have gotten involved in numerous types of dakwah, including preaching, teaching, writing, and social and humanitarian activity.\n\nThe government and religious groups have also acknowledged the importance of women in dakwah and have expanded their participation options. The rise of social media has also provided a platform for women to spread their message and reach a wider audience.\n\nOverall, women’s involvement in dakwah has contributed to the growth and development of Islam in Indonesia and has helped to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment in the country."
