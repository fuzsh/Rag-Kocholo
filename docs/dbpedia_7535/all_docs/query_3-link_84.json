Nyai Ahmad Dahlan film is a biopic film that tells the story of the life journey of Siti Walidah, who is often known as Nyai Ahmad Dahlan. This research aims to find out what da’wah messages are in the Nyai Ahmad Dahlan film. The researcher uses the semiotic analysis of Charles Sanders Peirce, using three stages: the sign, the use of the sign (interpretant), and the reference sign (object). This study uses a descriptive qualitative method using a data analysis approach to answer the problems formulated. The data is obtained from several scenes that refer to the message of da’wah and similar previous studies. From the research that has been conducted, it is concluded that the Nyai Ahmad Dahlan film contains several messages of Islamic da’wah, including messages of aqidah (belief), moral messages, and sharia messages in the form of muama...\n\nNot much attention has been given to Islamic films produced in Malaysia. However, the role to spread dakwah through media is an obligation. In the effort to vary the medium of da’wah, a film is seen as an influential way that can be explored as film can be an interesting tool/medium to spread da’wah, rather than through the conventional preaching, books, magazine and others. To understand the role of film in spreading the da’wah, the researchers reviewed two different films produced which are; Bisik Pada Langit (2017) and Adiwiraku (2017). For the analysis purpose, a set of coding sheet is created to record the film plot. The storyline of each film was analysed quantitatively using content analysis method to determine the frequencies of Islamic values emerged in these films. As a result, this article introduces themes that can visualise the Islamic values as appeared in non-Islamic films. These themes can illustrate how the Islamic values have been portrayed in those films which eve...\n\nThe film is one of the mass media that has the potential to influence audiences. Moreover, the film has more power than just entertainment media. It is able to oppose, reinforce and even overturn a religious perspective, basic values and ideological assumptions. This study aimed to determine how the representation of Islamic teachings in the Korean drama Man who dies to live. This research applied a descriptive qualitative approach. The object of research was the whole drama Man who dies to live, while the subjects were the scenes in the film that interpret the teachings of Islam. The data analysis technique used Charles Sanders Pierce&#39;s semiotic analysis through the triadic method by identifying signs, objects and interpretations. The result showed that several teachings of Islam are incompatible with those depicted in the drama man who dies to live, such as the use of hijab, foods, congregational prayers and invitations to commit immorality.\n\nThe general public perceives film as the factor that encourages negativity in the behaviour of its audience. However, through the perspective of film studies, the film can serve as the means to convey a good message. However, more in-depth reviews need to be done to attest to its capability in doing so. Therefore, using Laswell Communication Model (1948), this study was carried out to examine the good messages from religious Malay films. This study used qualitative content analysis design. by using purposive sampling, the researcher chose four Malay films as the subjects in this film study. The movies were Maut (Death) (2009), Syurga Cinta (Love Heaven) (2009) and Nur Kasih (The Light of Love) The Movie (2011). The films were watched and analysed by inserting all the facts into content analysis forms - the film meaning evaluation form and theme coding form. Narrative and theme analysis were used to analyse the film text data.
