        "text": "This year, Mother’s Day will be celebrated on May 8th in the US and some other countries like Denmark, Finland, Italy, Turkey, Australia, and Belgium. It is a time of commemoration and celebration for Mom. An opportunity for us to express our love and respect to our mother. It’s time to pamper her for all she has done for us over the years.\n\nIn my country, Mother’s day (or Hari Ibu) is celebrated nationally on December 22. It is the day of the first Indonesian Women Congress from December 22 to 25, 1928 conducted in Yogyakarta, Central Java. It was attended by 30 feminist organizations from 12 cities in Java and Sumatra. Feminist organizations have existed since 1912, inspired by Indonesian heroines of the 19th century, e.g. Kartini, Martha Christina Tiahahu, Cut Nyak Dien, Maria Walanda Maramis, Dewi Sartika, Nyai Ahmad Dahlan, Rasuna Said etc.\n\nPicture from gunawank.wordpress.com\n\nThe idea to make the day official was started during the third Indonesian Women Congress in 1938. It was signed by president Soekarno under the Presidential Decree no. 316 year 1959. The day was originally aimed to celebrate the spirit of Indonesian women and to improve the condition of the nation.\n\nWhy Mother’s Signature Dish?\n\nContinue reading →\n\nHappy Anniversary!
