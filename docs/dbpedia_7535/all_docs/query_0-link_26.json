The research that authors conducted in this paper is qualitative approach which included of library research. Authors used content analysis and comparative study as analysis data, which is an analysis of content that focuses on the interpretation of a work that tries to offer epistemological assumptions. The research findings showed that (1) Imam Zarkasyi’s concept on character education was explained in Five Principles of Modern Boarding School (Panca Jiwa Pondok Modern) as follows: sincerity; simplicity; independent; Islamic Brotherhood (ukhuwah islamiyah); and free spirit (2) And the basic concept of character education according to Ahmad Dahlan is based on Islamic perspective has consists of three things, faith, knowledge and charity (3) ...\n\nThe purpose of writing this article is to look at the character formation contained in the book Bidayatul Hidayah. This study is motivated by the Bidyatul Hidayah Book which is a book by Imam Al-Ghozali (ulama&#39; in the VI H century) which is a very important book to be studied and used as a reference in character building. This research method is a literature review, namely by looking for books and articles about character education. The results showed that the values of character education in the book Bidayatul Hidayah are 1) Remembering Allah, 2) Discipline of Time, 3) Having good intentions, 4) Taking care of yourself, 5) Respect for parents, 6) Tolerance for educators and students, 7) Coconut milk to friends (friends) and ordinary people.\n\nThe issues regarding character values, particularly in practical aspects, have been a fundamental problem in education, mainly among the students. These issues can clearly be observed in some phenomena contrary to the goals of education. The effort to retrieve character values from some Muslim scholars (Ulama) who have made significant contributions to the society (Ummah) is urgently required. The aim of this study is to highlight the patterns of ideas on character education between two influential Muslim scholars: Ahmad Dahlan (Malay Muslim scholar) with his reform movement during colonial period of Indonesia and al-Zarnûjî (Middle Eastern Muslim scholars) with his educational concept popularly used among Islamic boarding institutions (pesantren) in Indonesia. To gather the theoretical framework from both, literature study was undertaken to analyse the character values proposed by both scholars. The results revealed that Ahmad Dahlan emphasized a reform from hypostatisation (jumud) to dynamic thinking. On the other hand, al-Zarnûjî proposed an earnest effort for cultivating spiritual noble character values through niyyah (intention), muwȃḍabah (perseverance) including ta’ẓím (respect) wara’ (Godliness) and tawakkal (trust in God) for perfection in adab (courtesy) as the main performance indicator for individual character development. Thus, the integration of these different emphases will create ‘tawazun’ (balance of concepts) between ‘critical dynamic thought’ and ‘individual noble character’.\n\nEducation is a conscious and planned effort to create a learning atmosphere and learning process so that students actively develop their potential to have religious spiritual strength, self-control, personality, intelligence, noble character, and skills needed by themselves, society, nation and state . Character is the universal valuesof human behavior that includes all human activities, both in the context of relating to God, with oneself, with fellow humans, as well as with the environment, which are manifested in thoughts, attitudes, feelings, words, and actions based on norms. Religious norms, laws, etiquette, culture, and customs of Madrasas play a role in producing students who are smart in science, but also in character and personality. Through the example of Islamic figures and scholars discussed in Islamic Cultural History learning, especially the patience, persistence, and fortitude of the Prophet Muhammad SAW, his companions, scholars, and great figures in Islam so that s...\n\nIn terms of being a person with noble characters, actualisation of Islamic values is considered as an important effort to build and instil Islamic ideology as the way of life, since the development of human character in Islam is mostly a process of absorbing one's passion towards such values. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the pattern of Islamic character values in the light of al-Zarnj's Talim al-Mutaallim, which has been used among the Muslim countries as the main principles of educational implementation, mainly in Islamic institutions. Several literature studies obtained were analyzed using descriptive analysis. The result of this study reveals that there are some character values in term of Islamic pattern. Finally, this study is expected to contribute to the concept of Islamic character values, being the fundamental dimension to instill the human soul with spiritual character values, and consequently become the significant assimilation based on Quran and Hadith.\n\nCharacter education in Indonesia has become a necessity that can not be negotiable. Various cases of crime and moral deviations become evident that the character of most citizens already at alarming stage. Therefore, since the beginning, national education is not only aimed at generating human intelligent and skilled, but also of noble character.

The government and the mass media also play a role in supporting the education ...\n\nIn terms of being a person with noble characters, actualisation of Islamic values is considered as an important effort to build and instil Islamic ideology as the way of life, since the development of human character in Islam is mostly a process of absorbing one’s passion towards such values.
