There are 3785 programs including religious preaching, Qoryah Thayyibah, Association of Hajj Guidance, bureau of tithe, infaq and shodaqoh, and musholla. HISTORY ince founding Muhammadiyah, KH. Ahmad Dahlan concerned so much with the leadership towards women. The first very young women who really got the character building and were prepared to be the board of Muhammadiyah women are six women in the following : 1. Siti Bariyah 2. Siti Dawimah 3. Siti Dalalah\n\n4. Siti Busyro (his own daughter) 5. Siti Wadingah 6. Siti Badilah Zuber Although they were still children, with 15 years old as the oldest, they had been invited to think about social issues. Before 'Aisyiyah was concretely founded, the form of that women’s leadership movement was just a group of children gathering and having religious guidance from KH. Ahmad Dahlan and Nyai Ahmad Dahlan. This children group was not an organization form yet, but a group getting religious preaching. Besides the young girls, old women were also concerned by KH. Ahmad Dahlan, because Islam teaches us not to ignore women. Remembering that women’s role deserves the proper place, Nyai Ahmad Dahlan with KH. Ahmad Dahlan founded a women religious preaching group which members are girls and older women. As the day went by, this women religious preaching group was called SAPA TRESNA. It was not an organization yet, but only an religious preaching movement. In order to give a concrete name to be an association, KH. Mokhtar held a meeting with KH. Ahmad Dahlan, attended also by KH. Fachruddin and Ki Bagus Hadikusumo and the other boards of Muhammadiyah, in Nyai Ahmad Dahlan’s region. The first name suggested for the association is FATIMAH, but it wasn’t accepted by the meeting. Then KH. Fachruddin suggested a name 'AISYIYAH. Apparently, it is the most suitable name for this new women organization. Why is it thought to be the suitable one ? Because this association’s struggle is hopefully expected to follow the struggle of Aisyiyah, the wife of Prophet Muhammad SAW, who always helping him to perform the da’wah. After giving a name Aisyiyah by acclamation, they held an official ceremony. The official ceremony was held on the same day as the celebration of Isra’ Mi’roj Prophet Muhammad SAW in 27 Rajab 1335 H or 19 May 1917 M, which was held by Muhammadiyah for the first time. The seat of the female students and the mothers were separated by the pink curtain. KH. Mokhtar was opening the curtain of this ceremony. The following is the board of 'Aisyiyah based on the agreement decided : Chairwoman : Siti Bariyah Secretary : Siti Badilah Treasurer : Siti Aminah Harowi Assistant : Mrs. H. Abdulah Assistant : Mrs. Fatimah Wasool Assistant : Siti Dalalah Assistant : Siti Wadingah Assistant : Siti Dawimah Assistant : Siti Busyro After that, KH. Mukhtar gave the administration and organization guidance, while KH. Ahmad Dahlan gave the religious character building guidance directly.\n\nAfter the board of 'Aisyiyah was formally established, KH. Ahmad Dahlan gave some struggling spirits as follow : 1.
