        "text": "For the first time this millennium, the Cannes Film Festival is hosting a fund-raising event. The Haiti: Carnival In Cannes benefit will be presented by Giorgio Armani in support of Sean Penn’s J/P HRO, Paul Haggis’ Artists for Peace and Justice and Petra Nemcova’s Happy Hearts Fund and their humanitarian work in Haiti. Penn has been aiding the relief effort in Haiti since the 2010 earthquake devastated the country. Haggis’ group was established in 2009 to help poor children and families via education and health programs. Supermodel Nemcova’s Happy Hearts started its work in Haiti in 2007. A gala celebration will feature a fund-raising dinner on May 18. Money raised will go to all three orgs. Cannes previously hosted a benefit screening of Sergio Leone’s Once Upon A Time In America in support of the Institut Pasteur, and a screening of Paolo and Vittorio Taviani’s Elective Affinities to support the reconstruction of Venice’s Fenice which had been destroyed in a fire. Although the amFAR benefit for Amnesty International is an annual draw for Cannes folk, it’s not actually a festival event.\n\ndeadline-logo-svg Deadline\n\nSignup for Breaking News Alerts & Newsletters\n\nYour Email\n\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.
