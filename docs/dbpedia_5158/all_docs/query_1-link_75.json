        "text": "Seven fellows participate in a cross-disciplinary program reimagined for the next wave of storytellers\n\nNEW YORK—February 11, 2020— Sundance Institute, a nonprofit organization that provides and preserves the space for independent artists in film, theatre, and media to create and thrive, and Ucross, a prestigious artist residency program and creative laboratory for the arts, and have announced seven fellows participating in the 21st annual Sundance Institute Artist Residency at Ucross in Wyoming, currently taking place February 3–21, 2020. This year, the retreat was renamed (formerly the Sundance Institute Playwrights & Composers Retreat) to reflect its cross-disciplinary structure.\n\nAfter more than two decades of success, the Residency will continue to provide the transformative benefits of uninterrupted time for creative work. This year’s participants experience a fresh energy that mirrors the changing landscape of contemporary storytelling – one that is increasingly fluid and cross-genre. Fellows enjoy blocks of solo creative time to create, augmented with organic conversations where they can reflect on process. While Sundance Institute has curated several artists who identify theatre as their primary discipline, for the first time, the group of selected fellows represents a multidisciplinary range of artistic work. As always, the Residency remains dedicated to uninhibited creativity, professional growth and peer mentorship.\n\n“The refreshed format of this year’s Residency is deeply timely,” said Sundance Institute Theatre Program’s interim Director, Christopher Hibma. “We’re grateful for the Ucross team’s collaboration in devising innovative and exciting ways to support artists in responsive and evolving ways, to best reflect how they’re pushing the boundaries of form across disciplines.”\n\n“We are excited about this year’s newly configured Sundance Institute Artist Residency at Ucross,” said Ucross President Sharon Dynak. “Connecting artists of varying disciplines has long been an invaluable part of the Ucross vision. We are honored to support this extraordinary group of artists with the gift of time and space for creative work at our inspiring location on the High Plains of Wyoming.”\n\nThe retreat is one of 25 residency Labs the Sundance Institute hosts each year for independent artists in theatre, film, new media, and episodic content. This particular long-tested retreat in Wyoming is made possible through a partnership with Ucross. More than 90 artists have benefitted from the partnership between Ucross and Sundance in the last 20 years, including Billy Porter, Hannah Gadsby, Michael R. Jackson, Charlayne Woodard, Jeanine Tesori, Doug Wright, Annie Baker, Adam Guettel, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, and Tanya Saracho.\n\nThe 2020 Sundance Institute Artist Residency at Ucross Foundation fellows are:\n\nDAVID ADJMI: David Adjmi is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, The Steinberg Prize, and the Whiting Award, among others.

They are a co-host of the podcast, The Poetry Gods and are a Cave Canem fellow.\n\nCHARLOTTE BRATHWAITE: As a director, Brathwaite is known for her unique approach to staging classical and unconventional texts, dance, visual art, multi-media, site-specific installation, video, film, performance art, plays and music events. Seen in the Americas, Africa, Europe, the Caribbean and Asia, her work ranges in subject matter from the historical past to the distant future illuminating issues of race, sex, power and the complexities of the human condition.
