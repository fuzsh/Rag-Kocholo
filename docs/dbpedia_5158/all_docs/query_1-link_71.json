        "text": "Our series OST explores the relationship between the moving image and sound. For this second ADE edition we invite Dutch, Berlin-based duo Artefakt to provide a live score for a movie of their choice. They have selected Larry Gottheim’s spellbinding and rarely screened 1973 film Horizons (Elective Affinities, Part 1). They will perform a new original score to the film in collaboration with Derck Littel on cello.\n\n20:30 doors open\n\n21:00 start live show\n\nArtefakt (Delsin Records, Field Records)\n\nArtefakt is a collaboration between Dutch producers Robin Koek and Nick Lapien that share a love for melancholic, hypnotic voodoo music. The duo treats techno as an art form rather than a musical genre. Combining high art and underground culture stemming from the uncompromising squatting scene whilst practicing ‘musique concrete’ tape improvisations in galeries and musea performances. This merging of worlds manifests in a versatile nature that is audible in their live shows.\n\ncellist Derck Littel (Netherlands, 1960)\n\nGraduated at the Conservatorium of Amsterdam and participated as cellist in many ensembles and orchestra’s as the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and Nieuw Sinfonietta Amsterdam. He forms a duo with Robin Koek, live performing improvised electro-acoustic music, sometimes in combination with dance or theatre. In that capacity he performed in Stedelijk Museum, Trouw/de Verdieping, Theater Frascati, Paleis van Mieris, het Holland Festival, de Wereld Draait Door, ACTA, het Rijksmuseum, Studio Loos, at the Gaudeamus Festival, Design Museum and V&A Museum in London and IRCAM in Paris. In 2015 he obtained a Bachelor of Art and Design at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy. In September 2016 he continued his studies at the Royal College of Art in London and graduated in July 2018 with a Master of Art in sound-design and was nominated for the Lady Hamlyn Award.\n\nHorizons (Larry Gottheim, 1973)\n\nOne of the greatest if all-too-often overlooked landscape films in American cinema, Larry Gottheim’s Horizons displays a sensitivity to the seasons that seems more in keeping with Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden” than the typical nature documentary. Horizons was not only Gottheim’s first feature-length work, it was also his first film to deploy rhythmic editing after several single-shot works. The seasonal flux thus informs both the form and content of the image, with the basic elements of trees, sky, hills and the occasional crisscrossing clothesline filmed in every imaginable light. The resulting work is at once rigorous and meditative."
