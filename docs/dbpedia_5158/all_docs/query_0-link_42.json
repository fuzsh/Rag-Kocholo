Ettore Scola 1 I don’t know what the public “needs”—nor do I want to know. When the public sees films it likes, it just grabs them, and decrees their success. Nanni Moretti 2 Film and History Film and society? A constant interaction, rather than a mere correlation. Pierre Sorlin, The Film in History 3 It is…not a question of repudiating interpretation but of situating its protocols within a broader historical inquiry…. Some frameworks are more complex, precise, and nuanced than others; some reveal anomalies and counterexamples rather than mask them off. The inferences produced by broad and nuanced frames of reference are thus more likely to capture fresh and significant aspects of the phenomenon. A theoretically rigorous historical scholarship is at present a strong candidate for reinvigorating film study. David Bordwell, Making Meaning 4 -ix-\n\nContexts Culture as a whole can be considered as a text. It is, however, extremely important to underline that this is a text constructed in a complex way, made up of a hierarchy of “texts within texts,” and forming a complex intertwining of texts. Yurii Lotman, “Tekst v tekste” 5 Long have we worked together for a wider and more humane history. Marc Bloch, Apologie pour l’histoire 6 Filmmakers, by definition, make films, but not just that. Like other common mortals, they engage in mundane activities linked, directly or otherwise, to their daily existence. They drive cars, talk to their drycleaner, buy—just possibly—groceries, and so on. One of the things they most demonstrably practice, however, is reading. (Curiously, something they often claim not to do is watch movies, their own or someone else’s.) Film directors’ reading activities might, of course, be a matter of small consequence: they may read magazines, political or scientific, the maintenance manual for their Alfa Romeo, their children’s homework, or the lottery numbers in the newspaper. Sometimes, however, what they read matters more. And it matters because what they read has a deep impact on the way they do what we consider them important for doing: making films. This is most frequently the case when film directors read literature. The reason seems simple enough: literature is a treasure trove of narrative subjects and techniques which, having grown steadily for about three thousand years as Western clocks tick, has by our time reached proportions that make it simply impossible to ignore. Literature is a relatively (though only relatively) low-tech art; filmmaking, for its part, can occur only after the development of a considerably greater technological—and social— diversification in its host society. But, cinema’s technical differences aside, the similarities between the two arts in telling their respective types of stories are otherwise overpowering. The phenomenon is, after all, not altogether unprecedented; an analogous process of fission occurred when Western theater split away from other genres in the Middle Ages to become an autonomous field in its own right, yet remained a type of storytelling nonetheless. And it drew endlessly upon its predecessors from the times before the device called stage had been invented. 7 (Many of Shakespeare’s dramas, to mention but one generally familiar name, can be described as theatrical re-creations of preexisting literary material.) Just as the rise of modern theater enormously broadened the means and the scope of storytelling, so too did cinema in its own time—to be sure, “with differences in the object and manner of its imitation of reality” to adapt to our context Lessing’s sharply chosen terms. 8 Having said this, I want to emphasize that the goal of Italian Cinema and -x-\n\nModern European Literatures is not to focus on the general theoretical question of the parallelism or interaction between film and literature. Many books, excellent and less excellent, have been doing so for a long time now, and readers seeking guidance on the subject already have a wide range of options before them. 9 The 1990s were an especially rich period in this sense for the English-reading public. 10 As for recent works that examine the literature-to-film re-creative process in a specifically Italian context, they include Sandro Bernardi’s Storie dislocate, Cristina Bragaglia’s Il piacere del racconto, Sara Cortellazzo and Dario Tomasi’s Letteratura e cinema, Millicent Marcus’s Filmmaking by the Book, and Giuliana Nuvoli and Maurizio Regosa’s Storie ricreate. My own forthcoming Masters of Two Arts, which concentrates on nine major Italian films of the postwar period, offers a further contribution to the ever-expanding field of research that deals with the ways directors might re-create certain literary texts with which they feel a particular existential affinity. 11 Since in Masters of Two Arts I sketch in greater detail my own position on re-creation as a theoretical issue, with a view to eschewing duplication here I will simply give a working definition of the term as I use it. For my purposes, re-creation is a concept which takes us beyond that of “adaptation” (the latter being tainted by the old “fidelity” prejudice). Re-creation can occur on the basis of cultural homologies between culturalhistorical moments; it is, in practice, carried out by means of cinematographic devices equivalent to their literary counterparts. May I refer readers specifically interested in more details on the matter to Masters of Two Arts. 12 In a very real sense, Italian Cinema and Modern European Literatures can be described as an inquiry into diagonal contexts. The first reason is a general theoretical one that holds within each art form; the concept was long familiar to the Russian formalists, who expressed it on a number of occasions. Viktor Shklovskii wrote as early as 1923: “By a law first ascertained—to the best of my knowledge—by myself, in the history of arts inheritance is transmitted not from father to son, but from uncle to nephew.” 13 Diagonal transmission was also emphasized by Yurii Tynianov in his landmark book Archaists and Innovators (1929). 14 Second, there is a specific diagonal quality that is unique to cinema as the most recently created of all arts. As Sergei Èizenshtein sharply puts it in his article “Pushkin and Cinema,” “Cinema has no direct ancestors; its ancestors are all oblique.” 15 A third reinforcement of the “diagonal” concept obviously occurs to the extent that in the present book we are matching not only two different art forms with one another, but also Italian film with European literatures. In the fourth and final place, Italian Cinema and Modern European Literatures is characterized by a diagonal slant in that it concerns itself systematically with other historical series outside the sphere of cinema. In other words, film-and-literature interaction is but one aspect of the issue I am about to examine. That interest cohabits here pervasively with a second and complementary one: -xi-\n\nWhy does a particular cinematic re-creation of literature occur instead of any other among the countless possible ones? On this subject I fully share the views embodied in the theoretical tradition of the Russian formalists, linguists, and semioticians, whose work was most recently continued by the Tartu school of semiotics. According to these scholars, artistic affinities operate in a dialectical relationship with historical circumstances—indeed, are comprehensible only within the broader historical contexts in which they occur. 16 It is comforting to see that this theoretical position is today shared by the most attentive and advanced segment in the field of film studies (Bordwell, Casetti, Stam). 17 To summarize: alongside cinematic re-creation, the other main concern of Italian Cinema and Modern European Literatures is to analyze and describe what it was in the specific cultural situation of each moment in Italian history that made it attractive for film directors to have recourse to certain older texts in order best to articulate, in new texts, the issues of their own time. Because of its greater emphasis on diachronic developments in Italian society, Italian Cinema and Modern European Literatures is structured differently from Masters of Two Arts: its chapters are arranged in chronological order and grouped according to a periodization of Italian history which I think is most functional to highlight similarities and differences, and in general to stress the condition historique of human artifacts. Most visibly, Italian Cinema and Modern European Literatures aims at covering a cultural territory many times broader: Masters of Two Arts covers nine films, whereas Italian Cinema and Modern European Literatures analyzes, in a more condensed manner, a much greater number of titles. Being exhaustive is, here as elsewhere, necessarily impossible, but coverage is indeed one of the avowed goals of this book—a book which amounts to a history of Italian cinema viewed from a particular angle. 18 Conversely, I am not in no way duplicating here the in-depth analysis carried out in Masters of Two Arts, to which I refer readers more specifically interested in any one of the nine films discussed there. In a nutshell, Masters of Two Arts and Italian Cinema and Modern European Literatures complement one another: the former privileges depth and individual artistic relations; the latter, breadth and historical context. A conceptual overlap occurs in their field of application: Italian post–World War II cinema in its interaction with French, German, and Russian literature. (To avoid duplication, the films of Masters of Two Arts appear here in cameo roles that can do only limited justice to the amount of attention they would otherwise have received.) 19 There are a few exceptions within the strictly chronological structure of this book, and these occur where, within a given chapter, I place films with a strong mutual link (the same director and/or subject matter) into neighboring slots. At the cost of a slight aesthetic disruption, this aims at improving the logical continuity and readability of my argument. As a further comment on this book’s style of presentation, I should add here a few marginalia—not because I presume observant readers would not notice -xii-\n\nthem on their own, but simply to give everyone an advance synopsis of what to expect. The historical introductions are followed by a brief survey of contemporaneous filmmaking and a corresponding list of the most important Italian films of the period. Each chapter then usually begins with a general presentation or transition that leads to the discussion of individual films. The latter may be introduced by more specific presentations or transitions of their own, followed by the name of the director, the film’s title (in English, then in Italian) and its date. If the title of the film and that of its prior text translate identically into English, I usually set them apart by using their respective original names. Each film analysis contains a plot summary—generally of the film itself, rather than of its generative text, though on a few occasions I have thought it more effective to proceed otherwise. No plot summaries (or, indeed, notes) are given here for the nine items examined in Masters of Two Arts. In the course of my discussion, specific footnotes comment on topics I am touching upon in the text; one final note, which acts as a transition to the next entry, generally collects the residual bibliographic references that I believe can be useful to my readers. Finally, each chapter is concluded by some generalizations on Europhile filmmaking in Italy during the period under consideration. 20 The reason why I do not focus on the relationship between Italian cinema and Italian literature is altogether straightforward: there already are a number of books on this subject, and there is little I could add to their findings at this time. Where breadth is concerned, readers ought to consult Bragaglia and Nuvoli; for depth, Marcus’s Filmmaking by the Book. On the other hand, since my personal history—or whatever entity controls that—has caused me, over time, to take a particular interest and pursue my research in the cultures of modern France, Germany, and Russia, it is fairly obvious that the comparative usefulness of my work will be greatest in the exploration of those areas. 21\n\nOf course, from Japan to Patagonia, there would be many different possible combinations of national influences (although, it seems to me, none as overwhelming as that bringing together the three traditions I am collating here). This is a field of inquiry that is wellnigh inexhaustible—certainly inexhaustible for a single researcher. I can find, however, grounds for comfort in the fact that many areas in the literatures of the world are far from unknown to the practitioners of Italian cinema; there is no reason to assume that intercultural links between Italy and other countries will not be soon explored as thoroughly. Incidentally, not the least of the bonus features offered by a diagonal focalization on European literatures is a perception of the history of Italian cinema that is both different from those which came before it and complementary to them. By virtue of its different and complementary approach, I would argue, Italian Cinema and Modern European Literatures can avoid rounding up for the hundredth time only the usual candidates for glory, and instead adds to existing lists a number of deserving new names. These can be of interest to the -xiii-\n\npublic because of some historic-cultural feature they demonstrably share, rather than a common canonic status that may well evaporate as readers’ and viewers’ positions shift in time and space. There are, needless to say, infinite types of intertextuality; here I will be working within a model based on several broad categories. At one extreme of an ideal scale, I suggest the term homological to indicate re-creations that have a strong intellectual link to a prior text, but do no more than allude to it. These films are narratively independent from their prototypes and re-create them in manners which are appropriate for their twentieth-century contexts. A type of film that is more imbued with actual diegetic material 22 from its prior text makes up the group of what I would call inscriptional or epigraphic re-creations. Here, the prior text is directly evoked, although only isolated icons from it are brought to fruition by the director. Other films lie farther along the scale of the assimilation of prior material. These I would term coextensive re-creations. Here rightfully belong film-and-literature textual pairs that move from Beginning to Middle to End—or, if one will, from exposition to complication to peripety to retardation to dénouement—by retaining a significant set of functionally equivalent devices. Such devices include, variously combined, characters, plot, social background, point of view, and stylization. These films may have an embedded, shorter subunit with a strong coextensive link to a literary text; in that case they maintain what I suggest we call a partially coextensive relationship with that text. Or they may be totally coextensive with their predecessors. Another possibility can be observed in a group of mediated re-creations. Among these I subsume films whose relation to their respective prior texts is filtered—and to a large extent controlled—by their choice to operate via an intermediate epiphany, be it from the theater, the opera, or the cinema itself. (I am, though, excluding mere filmed theater and filmed opera from consideration). Here, a triangular dialectic is visibly at work. Finally, we have what may well be the least frequently attempted and most ambitious kind of all: hypertextual re-creations, in which directors deliberately strive to incorporate into their cinematic work a plurality of narrative texts by the same author. (Such cases, however, are so complex that they often deserve close-up scrutiny. Accordingly, I devote two chapters of Masters of Two Arts to Rossellini’s Vanina Vanini and Visconti’s Morte a Venezia.) 23 In Italian Cinema and Modern European Literatures I link Italian cinema to the history of the nation that produced it—not to history as an object of representation, but as a subject of it. In the films I am considering here, Italian history—political, economic, cultural—is not (or not only) inside the frames; it is, in the first place, behind the camera. To each of the six major phases in the more than fifty years to date of the Italian Republic, there corresponds one chapter of Italian Cinema and Modern European Literatures. 24 -xiv-\n\nCHAPTERS ONE AND TWO Chapter One covers the years 1946 through 1956, the peak time of the Cold War: a time, in Italy, of open conflict between the morally engaged great neorealist directors and conservative governments that considered such a position politically subversive. Chapter Two (1956–63) examines the later time when the class conflict in the peninsula became less systematically acute, in part due to Nikita Khrushchev’s post-Stalinist revelations at the XX Congress of the CPSU, but perhaps primarily because by then the Italian economic miracle had seriously gotten under way. 25 I have chosen 1963 as a terminus ad quem because during that year an economic downturn set in—the euphemistically called congiuntura—which interrupted the years of the “boom,” and also because the relatively continuous conservative political leadership of the previous period was at that time superseded by a new center-left coalition. (In 1963 the Socialists became junior tenants in the “room with the control buttons” of political power.) CHAPTERS THREE AND FOUR Chapter Three (1963–73) charts the years of a very rapid democratization, unfortunately accompanied by a no less sharp increase in the level of political and social conflict in Italian society. I identify 1973 as the year of the caesura, in acknowledgment of the rise of the first terrorist activities around that time and—decisively—in recognition of the cultural impact of the first global oil crisis. An additional advantage in my causing the clock to tick for a decade after 1963 is, I believe, that this allows us to avoid the common rhetoric of putting the social turmoil of the year 1968 on a pedestal for either idolatry or abomination; 1968 was a product of causes and effects, of which it, in turn, produced more. It was a year of acceleration, not an absolute turning point. Chapter Four of Italian Cinema and Modern European Literatures deals with the most painful period in the history of the Italian Republic, 1973 to 1982, marked by the two opposite, yet in some bizarre way similar, phenomena of consumerist massification and political terrorism of various stripes. From both the political and the commercial end, individuals were threatened by totalitarian discourses that mirrored one another in their warnings to conform, “or else.” Again, it was a deliberate choice that led me to position the assassination of Aldo Moro (1978) at the center of a phase of Italian history: in itself, the incident began nothing and ended nothing, it merely sped up the further evolution of longer-term processes. CHAPTERS FIVE AND SIX Chapter Five, which I reckon to run from 1982 to 1989, is sliced in such a way as to have at its zenith the star of Bettino Craxi. I view the year 1982 a watershed, insofar as it marks the intersection between the rapidly falling curve of terrorist attacks and the no less presto rising fortunes of the Socialist leader. -xv-\n\nFrom then on, the Italian Socialists became guilty of the crime of hubris (and of a long list of others), assuming themselves to be eternally indispensable to Italian democracy as a buffer between the centrist Christian Democrats and the Communists. Paradoxically, they were caught wrong-footed by the collapse of their most redoubtable competitors: shortly after the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, the entire system in which the Socialists held the balance of power was swept out of Parliament—and, in dozens of cases, into court for all manners of administrative misconduct. Hence 1989 as the concluding year for this period of Italian history. The sixth and last chapter (1989–2000) of Italian Cinema and Modern European Literatures starts at a time when the cracks caused in the Italian establishment by German unification translated into powerful shock waves for the entire peninsula. The republic born of the Resistenza against the Nazi-Fascists in 1943–45 lost, one after the other, its founding parties, which renamed themselves, split, or were voted out of existence. The magistrates engaged in the appropriately nicknamed Clean Hands investigations, particularly those of the Milanese Procura, succeeded in slapping long-overdue jail terms on the protagonists of some of the worst cases of corruption and embezzlement of public money during the 1980s. Meanwhile, the rise of new political actors unencumbered by what was perceived (by themselves) as obsolete ideological ballast added to the volatility of the system: the regional political associations calling themselves Northern Leagues and Silvio Berlusconi’s privately owned party, Forza Italia, entered the fray, making it necessary for Italians to redefine the identity of their fifty-year-old republic precisely at the exciting, though awkward, time when Maastricht’s Europe was knocking at the door. The year 1996—the fiftieth anniversary of the referendum that generated the Republic of Italy on 2 June 1946—at first promised to be a turning point in the process of Italy’s political rejuvenation: with a new, first-past-the-post majoritarian system in place, fresh elections for the first time gave parliamentary majority to a left-of-center democratic coalition. Yet hopes that Italy could complete a swift transition to a functional “Second Republic” akin to older western and northern European democracies were quickly dashed. In 1998, negotiations between Romano Prodi’s government and Berlusconi’s opposition over the necessary constitutional changes were sunk by the tycoon; Prodi’s own government foundered amid old-style internal squabbling. As of 1999, Italy entered the Euro currency area, but with enormous sacrifices in terms of fiscal pressure and slow growth. While Berlusconi anointed himself as the one and only solution to Italy’s many problems, Prodi’s center-left successors, Massimo D’Alema and then Giuliano Amato, took the view that a better alternative was to play them down—or (for example, in the case of what could be called the “Northern question”) to deny that they existed at all. At the dawn of the new century, Italy’s long-standing political stalemate remained unresolved. Just as I do not presume to know exactly what pitfalls await Italy on her path to less fettered development and closer integration with her European neighbors, -xvi-\n\nso I have no way either of extrapolating from the past record what specific paths the cultural interaction between Italian filmmakers and their European interlocutors will take in the future. Only one thing is certain: during the past half century, the symbiosis between the two groups has been enormously rich and fruitful, and in a democratic, integrated political entity it will continue to offer us the fruits of mutual illumination. Over time, I hope, many more books like Italian Cinema and Modern European Literatures will pay homage to such intercultural works of art.

(Rome: Editori Riuniti, 1993 [1982]); Fernaldo Di Giammatteo, Lo sguardo inquieto: Storia del cinema italiano 1940–1990 (Florence: La Nuova Italia, 1994); Marcia Landy, Italian Film (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000); Mira Liehm, Passion and Defiance: Film in Italy from 1942 to the Present (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984); Millicent Marcus, Italian Film in the Light of Neorealism (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1986); and Pierre Sorlin, Italian National Cinema 1896–1996 (London and New York: Routledge, 1996). 12. A few words, though, regarding “fidelity.” First, literary language and cinematic language are not directly convertible into one another, so “fidelity” is, in an extreme\n\n-xviii-\n\nsense, impossible to begin with. Second, who will measure it? “Fidelity” is, except perhaps in limit cases, to a large extent in the eye of the beholder. Third, who says that “fidelity”—if and when detected, proven, and measured—is necessarily a good thing? In fact, there are excellent reasons to suspect that absolute “fidelity” of a film to a work of literature would be an absolute terrible thing, a guarantee of cinematic mediocrity. Fourth, directors are rarely slaves to the “fidelity” myth; it would clearly be absurd to test their work against a criterion that had not guided them in the first place. On the inconvertibility of literary language into cinematic language in a direct manner, see above all Jean Mitry, The Aesthetics and Psychology of the Cinema, trans. Christopher King (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1997); Esthétique et psychologie du cinéma, vol. 1 (Paris: Editions Universitaires, 1963). On the ever-active dialogism between cultures and within each culture, see my references below to Russian formalists, linguists, and semioticians. The notion of homology was brought into focus with particular sharpness by Marcello Pagnini in his Semiosi: Teoria ed ermeneutica del testo letterario (Bologna: Il Mulino, 1988), pp. 61–66. 13.

On the correlation between artistic (literary, cinematographic) and other historical (cultural-historical and social) series, see Yurii Tynianov, “On Literary Evolution” (“O literaturnoi èvoliutsii”) and Boris Èichenbaum, “Literary Environment” (“Literaturnyi byt”), both translated into English in Ladislav Matejka and Krystyna Pomorska, eds., Readings in Russian Poetics: Formalist and Structuralist Views (Ann Arbor: Michigan Slavic Publications, 1978). A ringing manifesto for the establishment of a definitive (neither impressionistic nor mechanically deterministic) approach to the issue can also be found in Yurii Tynianov and Roman Jakobson, “Problemy izucheniia literatury i iazyka” (1928), in Texte der russischen Formalisten, vol. 2. Much of this hoped-for work came to fruition with Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin—on whom film studies specialists can consult Robert Stam’s Subversive Pleasures: Bakhtin, Cultural Criticism, and Film (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989)—and, above all, the Soviet school of semioticians trained in Bakhtin’s theories and clustered around Yurii Lotman. Unfortunately, among Lotman’s works relevant to this subject very little has been translated into English: essentially only Universe of the Mind: A Semiotic Theory of Culture, trans. Ann Shukman (London and New York: I. B. Tauris, 1990). For more details on publications in other languages, including my own article “Dalla letteratura al cinema: Adattamento o ri-creazione?,” see the thematic bibliography at the end of this volume. 17. Even without counting the recent books on cinematographic “adaptation” from the 1990s already referred to, a definite closing of the chasm between research on theoretical series and that on sociocultural series can be detected, as of this writing, in such\n\n-xix-\n\nimportant works as the following: Bordwell, Making Meaning; Francesco Casetti, Theories of Cinema: 1945– 1995, trans. Francesca Chiostri et al. (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1999); Teorie del cinema 1945–1990 (Milan: Bompiani, 1994); Francesco Casetti, “Lo sguardo novecentesco,” in Bernardi, ed., Storie dislocate, pp. 17–26; and Robert Stam, Film Theory: An Introduction (Oxford: Blackwell, 2000). 18.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the earlier filmic material proved difficult or impossible to locate and view. In particular, I wish I could have done more to cover the 1940s, a period that—if nothing else, to bolster receipts at the box office—was more Europhile than we realize today. For practical reasons, I have chosen to concentrate on material that is, if not always easily, at least reasonably, available commercially or in media libraries in Italy or North America; but this was at times a painful option for me. Indeed, a book of respectable size could perhaps be written on the cross-media intertextuality of many French-, German- and Russian-inspired films made in Italy during the first few years I take into consideration. Using Roberto Chiti and Roberto Poppi, I film dal 1945 al 1959, vol. 2 of Dizionario del cinema italiano (Rome: Gremese, 1991), I ran a control test for 1945–1948 and retrieved no fewer than thirteen items. Seven such entries are for Italian cinema proper: 1946. Riccardo Freda’s Black Eagle (Aquila nera), from Pushkin’s novella Dubrovsky; and Mario Soldati’s Eugenia Grandet, from Balzac. 1947. Mario Camerini’s The Captain’s Daughter (La figlia del capitano), from Pushkin; Riccardo Freda’s Les Miserables (I miserabili), from Hugo; Giacomo Gentilomo’s The Brothers Karamazov (I fratelli Karamazoff), from Dostoevsky; and Gennaro Righelli’s The King’s Messenger (Il corriere del re), from Stendhal’s Red and Black. 1948. Giorgio Pàstina’s Wilhelm Tell, the Archer of the Black Forest (Guglielmo Tell, l’arciere della Foresta Nera), from Schiller. Three further items are co-productions (all with France and in 1947): Jacques de Baroncelli’s Rocambole, from Ponson du Terrail; Pierre Billon’s Ruy Blas, from Hugo; and Christian-Jaque’s The Charterhouse of Parma (La Certosa di Parma), from Stendhal. Finally, we have three filmed operas: 1946. Mario Costa’s Il barbiere di Siviglia, from Rossini. 1947. Max Calandri’s Lohengrin, from Wagner. 1948. Carmine Gallone’s The Legend of Faust (La leggenda di Faust), a potpourri from Charles Gounod and Arrigo Boito. The extant secondary literature on all these titles is scarce. Not untypical is the situation of Rocambole and The Charterhouse of Parma, which are briefly mentioned in Aldo Bernardini, “Le collaborazioni internazionali nel cinema europeo,” in Gian Piero Brunetta, ed., L’Europa. Miti, luoghi, divi, vol. 1, pt. 1 of his Storia del cinema mondiale (Turin: Einaudi, 1999), p. 1037. Soldati’s Eugenia Grandet gets two pages in Attolini, Storia del cinema letterario, pp. 107–09. As for the films themselves, among the few acceptably available ones at the time of this writing are Eugenia Grandet and Camerini’s The Captain’s Daughter (both were aired on afternoon TV in the 1990s and thereby acquired by at least some media libraries) and Freda’s Les Miserables (commercial video). The Charterhouse of Parma is, given sufficient time, means and luck, retrievable in France. Having mentioned co-productions, I wish to specify here that the criterion I have applied to discriminate for or against including any of them in Italian Cinema and Modern European Literatures is the nationality of the director. Thus, for example, ceteris paribus, Carmine Gallone’s Michael Strogoff is in, while Christian-Jaque’s Charterhouse is out.\n\n-xx-\n\n19.\n\nTo the extent that the key term here is “history,” I feel it is my duty to operate in the same way as conventional historians would—and, just as they would, to articulate for readers my own methodological presuppositions. Historiography, to my mind, can most accurately be metaphorized as a fishing expedition: The facts are really not at all like fish on the fishmonger’s slab. They are like fish swimming about in a vast and sometimes inaccessible ocean; and what the historian catches will depend partly on chance, but mainly on what part of the ocean he chooses to fish in and what tackle he chooses to use—these two factors being, of course, determined by the kind of fish he wants to catch. By and large, the historian will get the kind of facts he wants. History means interpretation. (Edward Hallett Carr, What Is History? [London: Macmillan, 1986], p. 18 To wit: on the one hand, what one catches depends largely on what one has equipped him/herself to catch. On the other hand, within such bounds, one will, first, catch fish that are there (i.e., that in fact materially exist); and, second, one will not be able to catch fish that are not there, making them up ex nihilo. In sum, historiography is to me a two-faced, subjective-objective, middle-way process eschewing both the ontological claims typical of nineteenth-century Geistesgeschichte and some more contemporary, solipsistic ones according to which there is nothing more to culture than a consistent Will to Power of Hegemonic Discourse.\n\n20.\n\nSome discrepancies in English translations of titles or dates of release may occur due to differences in distribution in Italy and other countries.\n\n21.\n\nMany are the important groups of films which my personal circumstances force me to leave to one side. A nonexhaustive list, chronologically and geographically arranged, of the material that could have been included by scholars with a background different from mine follows: Antiquity. Ancient Greece: Pasolini’s Oedipus Rex (Edipo re, 1967; from Sophocles) and Medea (1970; from Euripides); and Martone’s Theater of War (Teatro di guerra, 1998; from Aeschylus’s The Seven Against Thebes). Rome: Fellini’s Satyricon (1969; from Petronius Arbiter’s Satyricon). To these one could add all of Rossellini’s and Olmi’s films inspired by Judeo-Christian Scriptures. Middle Ages. Europe: Pasolini’s Canterbury Tales (I racconti di Canterbury, 1972; from Chaucer). Outside Europe: Pasolini’s Arabian Nights (Il fiore delle mille e una notte, 1974; from the collection of Arab and South Asian tales); and Cavani’s Milarepa (1974; from the Tibetan Buddhist text The Life of Milarepa). Renaissance. Zeffirelli’s The Taming of the Shrew (La bisbetica domata, 1967); and the many Romeo and Juliets from Shakespeare (Castellani, 1954; Freda, 1964; and Zeffirelli, 1968). Nineteenth and twentieth centuries (outside Europe). Anglo-American literature: Visconti’s Ossessione (1943; from James Cain’s The Postman Always Rings Twice); Fellini’s Toby Dammit (1968; from Edgar Allan Poe’s Never Bet the Devil Your Head); and Bertolucci’s The Sheltering Sky (Il té nel deserto, 1990; from Paul Bowles’s The Sheltering Sky). Hispano-American: Antonioni’s Blow-Up (1967; from Cortázar’s The Devil’s Drool/Las babas del diablo); and Bertolucci’s The Spider’s Stratagem (La strategia del ragno, 1970; from Borges’s The Theme of the Traitor and the Hero/Tema del traidor y del héroe). Japan: Brass, The Key (La chiave, 1983; from Tanizaki’s novel of the same title); and Cavani, The Berlin [sic] Affair (Interno berlinese, 1985; from Tanizaki’s The Buddhist Cross). Even for the nineteenth and twentieth centuries within Europe, a number of examples could be adduced to gauge the distance separating this book from full exhaustiveness. Among the items that come to my mind as victims of my own ignorance in the matter of—for example—British culture, the first are Comencini’s Misunderstood (Incompreso, 1967; from Florence Montgomery’s novel of the same title); Amelio’s Young Archimedes (Il piccolo Archimede, 1979); from Aldous Huxley’s homonymous short story); and Zeffirelli’s Jane Eyre (1996; from Charlotte Brontë). A deserving Dutch entry inevitably denied its due in this book is Jona Oberski’s Childhood (Kinderjaren), re-created by Faenza in Jonah Who Lived Inside the Whale (Jona che visse nella balena, 1993). (However, for Amelio’s reservations about the genesis of Young Archimedes, see his interview with Mimmo Rafele collected in Lucilla Albano, ed., Il racconto tra letteratura e cinema (Rome: Bulzoni, 1997), esp. p. 143.\n\n-xxi-\n\n22. Diegetic (from Greek diêgêsis meaning narration) relates to narration or plot; narrative. 23. For a survey of alternative possible classifications, see those listed and described in McFarlane, Novel to Film, pp. 10–11. I particularly regret the absence of any specific categorization of literature-to-cinema re-creation in Gérard Genette’s otherwise admirable Palimpsests: Literature in the Second Degree, trans. Claude Doubinsky and Channa Newman (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1997); Palimpsestes: La littérature au second degré (Paris: Seuil, 1982). (Genette uses the term hypertext to indicate any “upstream” text—a practice which has by and large been abandoned by subsequent scholarship.) 24. Again, in response to a question as to whether my history is going to be “objective” or not, I can only answer: of course it is, and of course it isn’t. I must repeat that I consider objectivity to be an impossible ideal. Italian culture is not fond of the attempts, routinely made by neopositivistic hermeneutics, at presenting “facts” purely and simply; facts are, alas, rarely simple, and in any case never pure. (That said, my quote from E. H. Carr in note 19 indicates that Anglo-Saxon scholars are perfectly able to see eye to eye with a nonidealistic historiographic methodology.) To rephrase the concept in more direct terms: my account of Italian history since 1945 develops out of the axioms of a consciously non-Berlusconian geometry. Yes, I am picking out certain sad facts in the history of Italian democracy while leaving out edifying ones (for example, the news of Berlusconi’s willingness—abroad today in his hometown of Arcore—to offer free rent for life to very old farmers still operating on the prime building land the tycoon has purchased there for development). No, I do not think that Berlusconi was the best development that could happen to the Italian body politic since the good-natured Duce was foolishly taken in by an ever-scheming Führer. For a condensed account in English of Berlusconi’s fortunes, see “Berlusconi: An Italian Story,” The Economist, 28 April 2001, 17–18, 23–28. 25. It goes without saying that the Cold War did not end on 31 December 1956, that the Italian “economic miracle” did not begin on 1 January 1957, and so on. Any such periodization is adopted here, as is customary in such cases, as a somewhat arbitrary conceptualization of certain phenomena that shape successive historical ages. In practice, features of each chronological segment overlap with those of the preceding one and the following one (or ones) for a long time before and after their own peak. -xxii-\n\n1 The Cold War (1945–56) The “subject” of a work is what a bad one finally boils down to. Paul Valéry 1 The years 1945 and 1946 saw the gradual reestablishment of normalcy in Italy after the end of World War II and the civil war against the Nazis and Mussolini’s puppet northern republic (Repubblica di Salò). Under Allied occupation, central rule emanated from a coalition government that, mirroring the makeup of the anti-Fascist insurrectional committee, the CLN (Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale), included all six anti-Fascist parties (Partito d’Azione, Comunista, Democrazia Cristiana, Liberale, Repubblicano, Socialista). The first Italian government after the fall of the regime was under the leadership of Ferruccio Parri, of the Partito d’Azione. Quite apart from constitutional issues—establishing the guidelines for multiparty elections, drafting a new constitution, choosing between a monarchic or a republican state form—occupied Italy had to cope with a host of emergency situations: the purge and replacement of Fascist civil servants, the conflict with Yugoslavia over the new northeastern border, Sicilian separatism, massive pressure by landless peasants for agrarian reform in the countryside, inflation, the black market economy, currency devaluation. Soon political conflicts between left-wing and right-wing parties arose, particularly over the attempt to remove Fascist personnel from sensitive political positions. Echoing dissatisfaction harbored by the U.S. administration about the Italian government’s political ambivalence, the Liberals and the Christian Democrats eventually withdrew their -1-\n\nsupport from the coalition of national unity, so that Parri was forced to resign in November 1945. In December 1945 a new, center-right government was sworn in under the leadership of Alcide De Gasperi, a Christian Democrat. (The next non-Christian Democrat prime minister would be Giovanni Spadolini in 1981, thirty-six years later.) De Gasperi adopted deflationary policies, reversed guidelines on dismissal of Fascists from the public administration, and proclaimed an amnesty for all political crimes committed under the former regime. The international situation, meanwhile, became ever more tense; Winston Churchill coined the expression “iron curtain.” On 2 June 1946, in a nationwide referendum Italians opted for a republican state form; they also elected representatives to a special assembly (Assemblea Costituente) in charge of drafting a new constitution. Slowly and painfully negotiated as a compromise between lay and Church desiderata, this document went into effect on 1 January 1948. Taking advantage, during the interregnum, of the disarray of the previously Fascist-run film industry, Rossellini brought out two cinematic products of a novel and as yet undefinable theoretical status: Rome, Open City (1945) and Paisan (1946). The Italian public was at first underwhelmed by their artistic merits: they presented reality, not art. Fortunately, other audiences around the world opined differently, and eventually persuaded Italians that art and realism were far from being mutually exclusive concepts. In 1947 Italy experienced a dramatic turning point: Harry Truman announced the launch of the Marshall Plan for U.S.-friendly countries of Western Europe. Against the backdrop of severe social and political unrest, Italy acceded to the plan; at the same time, the parties of the left were definitively excluded from government. Walter Lippmann described the new global situation as a “Cold War.” Carrying out what would later turn out to be the first in a long string of political massacres in the story of the Italian Republic, the band of the Sicilian rebel Salvatore Giuliano attacked a peasants’ rally at Portella della Ginestra and killed eight demonstrators. Having fulfilled its mandate, in 1948 the Constituent Assembly resigned. Elections for the new Parliament took place in the explosive atmosphere of the Cold War. (Palmiro Togliatti, the secretary of the Italian Communist Party, was shot at and seriously wounded by a right-wing extremist.) The center-right parties obtained an absolute majority. In 1949, not without further conflict in Parliament and outside it, Italy joined NATO. The Vatican excommunicated all Communists and their supporters. The year 1950 marked the beginning of the Korean War. In Italy, economic restructuring led to the onset of industrial recovery, accompanied, over the next few years, by increased unemployment, strikes, lockouts, occupations of uncultivated land by landless peasants, and bloodshed as the police repressed laborers’ demonstrations. Emigration was encouraged by international agreements; a fund for special pilot projects in the South was created (Cassa per il Mezzogiorno). -2-\n\nThe 1950s saw Italy turn from a prevalently agrarian country to one dominated by industry. In agricultural areas the population was depleted by mass migrations either to foreign countries or toward the northern regions of the triangolo industriale; in industrialized areas, the influx of millions of workers brought steady growth, but also a human toll in attendant social problems. In politics, the Cold War continued throughout the 1950s: purges racked Eastern Europe, McCarthyism swept the United States, and with the “swindle bill” (legge truffa) of 1952– 53 Italian centrist governments attempted to skew the rules of parliamentary representation by assigning bonus seats to the political majority (i.e., themselves). Giulio Andreotti castigated De Sica for persevering after Bicycle Thieves (Ladri di biciclette, 1948) and offering in Umberto D. (1952) yet another poverty-stricken, “unflattering” image of Italy to the world. State-controlled TV (RAI Radio Televisione Italiana) began broadcasting, and reached ever-growing audiences with variety shows imitating U.S. models. In 1953, Stalin died. In 1956–57, Nikita Khrushchev’s revelations at the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the repression of the Hungarian revolt which followed it, caused a deep crisis in the Italian Communist Party. Italian Socialists distanced themselves from the Communists; many Communists abandoned their party. As Italian society became more diversified, the decade-long polarity of the Cold War began to fray. In cinema, the years between 1945 and 1956 were the heyday of neorealism: at first in its morally committed variant, and later also in its “pink,” merely entertaining, one. To rephrase the concept in more sharply political terms, the peak of the Cold War largely coincided with the great season of neorealism proper—the latter eventually turning into one of the many political victims of the former. Among the most important reference films of this time are Antonioni’s Chronicle of A Love (Cronaca di un amore, 1950), The Vanquished (I vinti, 1952), The Lady Without Camellias (La signora senza camelie, 1953), and The Girlfriends (Le amiche, 1953); Comencini’s Bread, Love and Fantasy (Pane, amore e fantasia, 1953); De Santis’s Tragic Hunt (Caccia tragica, 1946), Bitter Rice (Riso amaro, 1949), and No Peace Among the Olive Trees (Non c’è pace tra gli ulivi, 1950); De Sica’s The Children Are Watching Us (I bambini ci guardano, 1943), Shoeshine (Sciuscià, 1946), Bicycle Thieves (Ladri di biciclette, 1948), Miracle in Milan (Miracolo a Milano, 1951), Umberto D. (1952), and The Gold of Naples (L’oro di Napoli, 1954); Fellini’s The White Sheik (Lo sceicco bianco, 1952), The Loafers (I vitelloni, 1953), and The Road (La strada, 1954); Germi’s In the Name of the Law (In nome della legge, 1949), The Path of Hope (Il cammino della speranza, 1950), The Brigand of Tacca del Lupo (Il brigante di Tacca del Lupo, 1952), and The Railroad Man (Il ferroviere, 1956); Lattuada’s The Bandit (Il bandito, 1946), The Mill on the River Po (Il mulino del Po, 1949), Anna (1952), The Overcoat (Il cappotto, 1952), The She-Wolf (La lupa, 1953), and The Beach (La spiaggia, 1953); Lizzani’s Beware! Bandits -3-\n\n(Achtung! Banditi, 1951) and Chronicle of Poor Lovers (Cronache di poveri amanti, 1954); Maselli’s Breaking Ranks (Gli sbandati, 1955); Monicelli’s Cops and Robbers (Guardie e ladri, 1951); Pietrangeli’s The Sun in the Eyes (Il sole negli occhi, 1953); Rossellini’s Rome, Open City (Roma, città aperta, 1945), Paisan (Paisà, 1946), Love (Amore, 1948), Germany Year Zero (Germania anno zero, 1948), Stromboli, Land of God (Stromboli, terra di Dio, 1949), Francis, Jester of God (Francesco, giullare di Dio, 1950), Europa ’51 (1951), Voyage to Italy (Viaggio in Italia, 1953), Joan of Arc Burned at the Stake (Giovanna d’Arco al rogo, 1954), and Fear (La paura, 1954–55); Visconti’s Ossessione (1943), The Earth Trembles (La terra trema, 1948), and Senso (1954). Most directors of the immediate postwar period belonged to a generation brought up under the “calligraphic” mandates of the Fascist era: no politics, no violence, no real-life ugliness. They aimed at reaching large masses of people and generally cared little for the exploration of new paths in cinematographic expression or techniques. And they often drew upon preexisting literary texts whose plots they re-created for the screen with hardly any ambition beyond an illustrative one. 2 Mario Soldati shared a few traits with this group. A gifted but not yet well-known literary author, in the 1930s Soldati, facing financial distress, had to seek employment in the film industry, at the time still largely based in his hometown of Turin. After making over two dozen films between 1938 and 1959—mostly re-creations from Italian nineteenth-century novels—he turned to TV productions with similar characteristics. His literary output, on the other hand, continued into the 1990s. Soldati’s Eugenie Grandet (Eugenia Grandet, 1946) is re-created from Balzac’s novel of the same title. 3 We are in the French provinces—the town of Saumur—shortly after the post-Napoleonic Restoration. The dreamy Eugenia lives a lonely life, kept on a tight leash by her avaricious father, the cooper-turned-speculator Grandet. Her lazy and morally worthless cousin Carlo suddenly comes to Saumur from Paris, where his father is about to commit suicide after going bankrupt. Eugenia promptly falls for the foppish young man. Believing he will come back to her healthy, wealthy, wise, and above all in love, she gives him enough money to go to the Indies and start a new life there. The latter Carlo does successfully, but without giving Eugenia, over time, any sign of life or gratitude. Then new challenges spring up for the young woman: when old Grandet dies, she takes over the ownership and the management of the multimillion-franc-estate. Carlo comes back after seven years. In a businesslike manner, he returns to Eugenia the borrowed sum, announcing to her that he intends to marry the daughter of the Marquise d’Aubrion…because, chère cousine, such is the way of the world. However, instead of being put off by Carlo’s effrontery, Eugenia once more sacrifices herself for -4-\n\nhis sake: she fully settles the debts outstanding from her uncle’s bankruptcy, thus for all intents and purposes making Carlo’s marriage financially possible. The marriage of Eugenia’s faithful nanny, Nanon, chronologically coincides with Carlo’s. Eugenia will henceforward live alone in her father’s large and now empty home. Particularly toward the end of the film, Soldati makes some deft rearrangements vis-à-vis the novel in the structure and chronology of the events he narrates. For example, he excises altogether the eventual marriage and widowhood of Balzac’s Eugénie, concurrently delaying Nanon’s definitive departure so as to maximize the traumatic impact that Carlo’s betrayal has on Eugenia. The director is also skillful in manipulating the symbolism of certain objects. Thus, the almost comically decadent nightgown which le dandy initially leaves with his cousin as a token of his supposed eternal love later migrates to the shoulders of a more appropriate support—the Virgin—wrapped around whose statue Eugenia admires it, in the film’s final images, transfixed in wistful contemplation. Surely, Soldati’s Eugenia Grandet responded to the aesthetics of a historical situation where little more than illustration was generally envisaged by directors or, indeed, expected of them. It was a production that, a decade later, could have been undertaken by RAI, the Italian TV corporation, for its programs aimed at cultural literacy among the general public. Yet this was, in itself, a far from undeserving goal—a goal that, sampling today’s airwaves, one certainly wishes the Italian TV stations of the twenty-first century had the dignity to “go back” to. 4 But melancholy provincial beauties remembering things past were only one—and by far not the main one—of the staples of the Italian cinema of the time. The next two items in our list, Freda’s Les Miserables and Camerini’s The Captain’s Daughter, will require some substantial contextualization in this sense. If there is any truth to the anonymous popular definition of cinema as a factory of illusions, rarely might Italian audiences have embraced such a view with more zeal than in the war-ravaged years following the end of the hostilities in 1945. Aside from gorging itself on American-made films, old and new, whose landing on the fatherland’s shores Fascism had long forbidden, the Italian public of the time mainly flocked to view historical films able to take it to an escapist world of heroines and heroes wearing splendid costumes and roaming exotic, faraway lands. The overwhelming majority of such cloak-and-dagger or sentimental products were made by filmmakers of Soldati’s generation, who, having come of age under the Fascist regime, felt at ease with a time-tested, politically indifferent formula. Monicelli, who would become one of the most successful directors in the second half of the century but at the time was an obscure young scriptwriter, described the immediate postwar situation in no roundabout way: The historical films of those years were aimed at a working-class public. Freda’s films, such as Black Eagle and The Mysterious Knight, enjoyed an incredible success. 5 -5-\n\nAudiences grew passionate for the heroes of these films, which we invariably presented as absolutely upright—something we did in part to stay within the tradition of the cheap serial novel, and in part to humor what we knew to be the public’s taste. In the wake of those hits, Camerini [shot] The Captain’s Daughter, from Pushkin; then Righelli made The King’s Messenger, from Stendhal’s Red and Black;…and Gentilomo dared shoot The Brothers Karamazov. 6 This style of production was very much in line with Europhile films that had routinely been made under Fascism until almost the very end of the war. One thinks, for example, of Renato Castellani’s A Pistol Shot (Un colpo di pistola, 1942), from a novella by Pushkin (The Shot, from Tales of Belkin; Vystrel, from Povesti Belkina, 1831), or of Flavio Calzavara’s Resurrection (Resurrezione, 1944), from Tolstoy (Voskresenie, 1899). Riccardo Freda’s Black Eagle (Aquila nera, 1946), a re-creation of Pushkin’s short story “Dubrovsky” (1832–33), fits seamlessly into this artistic—or, to put the matter more precisely, artistico-commercial—pattern. 7 It is certainly curious to note how nonchalantly the cultural heritage of a supposedly enemy nation such as Russia could be appropriated first by the belligerently antiBolshevik Fascist regime, and after 1945 by an industry that was, by any standard of measurement, drenched in the culture of its Western military occupants. (Freda was a particularly zealous fan of the U.S. cinematic tradition, with which he deliberately aimed at competing.) It is difficult to assess today to what extent the films mentioned bracketed out any substantive Russianness from their treatment of their subject matter or, conversely, attempted to use it in order to question the legitimacy of the Communist dictatorship. Without any reasonable access to this abundant material, one certainly is left with a gnawing sense of curiosity about what traits could have been given to improbable personae such as, for example, a “Fascist” Tolstoy. Freda’s presence in the company just described comes as little surprise to those who are both familiar with the director’s artistic inclinations and aware of how much of the old Fascist regime lived on in the Italy of 1945—not only politically but also culturally and, in particular, cinematographically. A fairly long string of quotations could be assembled by collating Freda’s scathing judgments of his favorite bogeypersons: “the filthy stench” [i fetidi miasmi] of neorealism in cinema (the credo he swears by being “imagination”); 8 a narrative focus on common people, such as we find in De Sica’s works (Freda being allout for hero worship); and cinematic intellectualism as practiced by the likes of Antonioni and Fellini (Freda’s most fervent admiration going, rather, to Hollywoodian adventure films). It is almost painful to see how, even a long time after the events discussed, Freda could still argue as follows: More than thirty years ago, everyone was delirious about Rome, Open City. People said that was the path which cinema had to take. I laughed about that, because I thought that this kind of filmmaking was accidental, absolutely uninteresting. I put forward this opin-6-\n\nion often and on different occasions, and I know that as a consequence I am not much appreciated. But I still hold, and I say so openly, that realism in general is the worst possible form of artistic expression…. Realism is but a mechanical reproduction of real life…. It is funny [buffo] that an aesthetics which [in painting] was already in a stage of advanced putrefaction should have been able to become a great new form of expression in cinema. 9 The angle from which Freda perceives Fascism is not only altogether consistent with the above views, but is in itself revealing: [D]uring the allegedly abominable twenty years of Fascism…there were, to be sure, a few problems of freedom for intellectuals; but I remember that one day, alluding to colleagues who ranted that they could not freely express their ideas, Vitaliano Brancati told me: “They should pray [to] God and be grateful to Him, because the day they will be free to express themselves, it will turn out that they had nothing to say!” 10 As late as 1994, Freda still exhibited an almost pathetic insistence that Rossellini’s fame was due to sheer good luck. 11 There is considerable consistency in this; no more need be said, I believe, on the extent to which art and politics can be two sides of the same coin. The mere listing of selected titles from Freda’s filmography between 1940 and 1980 is probably more eloquent than any metatextual commentary on them: One Hundred Love Letters (Cento lettere d’amore, as scriptwriter); Don Cesare di Bazan; The Whole City Sings (Tutta la città canta); Black Eagle (Aquila nera); Les Miserables (I miserabili); The Mysterious Knight (Il cavaliere misterioso); Guarany; Count Ugolino (Il conte Ugolino, from Dante’s Inferno); D’Artagnan’s Son (Il figlio di D’Artagnan); The Betrayal, or The Past That Kills (Il tradimento, o passato che uccide)…and more in the same vein: The Vengeance of Black Eagle; Spartacus; Theodora, Empress of Byzanthium; Beatrice Cenci (possibly from Stendhal’s novella or Shelley’s The Cenci, with Antonin Artaud’s The Cenci as a very distant third candidate); The Vampires; Ambushed in Tangier; In the Sign of Rome; Haji Murat (i.e., Agi Murad [sic], the White Devil, from Tolstoy’s novella by that title); Caltiki the Immortal Monster; The Mongols; The Giants of Thessalia; Manhunt; Maciste at the Court of the Great Khan; Maciste’s Descent to Hell; Dr. Hichcock’s [sic] Horrible Secret; The Seven Swords of the Avenger; The Specter; The Magnificent Adventurer; Romeo and Juliet (from Shakespeare); Genevieve of Brabant; Coplan FX 18 (a.k.a. Agente 777); Mission Summergame (title in English); Death Does Not Count Dollar Bills (under the pseudonym “George Lincoln”); The Fire-Tongued Iguana (under the pseudonym “Willy Pareto”); and Murder Obsession (title in English). In view of the above production, one must at least grant Freda a high degree of artistic consistency: as decade follows decade, he remains faithful to one and the same formula, reclothing it each time in the garb of the latest cinematic -7-\n\ntrend. Thus, in his production the historical costume film of the 1940s and early 1950s is superseded, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, by large-scale “peplum” (classicomythological) productions, with an occasional nod to Tolstoy’s Caucasus; then, around the mid-1960s, the ancient world yields—and in the 1970s gives way entirely—to the horror film and the pseudo-007 thriller. Death Doesn’t Count Dollar Bills seems to have strong credentials as Freda’s one and only contribution to the tradition of the spaghetti western. Clearly, all this amounts to an almost perfect map of the paths taken by Italian commercial cinematography over four decades of its history—a fact that somehow makes Freda highly representative in his own right. To be sure, while there is nothing inherently wrong with this kind of representativeness, one cannot help feeling skeptical about the director’s praise of “imagination” (and his attendant dismissal of the neorealist revolution) when one holds up to it such a long list of repetitive formula films. Freda’s Les Miserables (I miserabili, 1947) is a film of James Bond-like deeds and frenzied manhunts that duplicates the plot (or, rather, parts of the plot) of Victor Hugo’s novel of the same title. 12 The film consists of two parts: Manhunt and Storm over Paris. Manhunt. In order to mend his past ways, Jean Valjean, a former convict in a penal colony, changes his identity along with his life. He becomes mayor of a small town and is a benefactor of his community. However, he is persecuted by the malign policeman Javert, who, through a ruse, corners him into revealing his past to the village. Valjean acts in accordance with his newly found sincerity; then, eluding Javert’s surveillance, he flees to Paris with his adopted daughter, Cosetta. Storm over Paris. The 1832 Paris uprising breaks out. Valjean saves the life of the revolutionary student Mario; Mario and Cosetta fall in love. The evil Javert, ever on the good man’s heels, finds Valjean, yet cannot arrest him; in a fit of remorse, in fact, he jumps to his death in the Seine. Cosette and Mario get married, but Valjean is able to witness only the first few minutes of their happiness: he is shot and killed by a former fellow inmate. There is no attempt in the film to reelaborate the original text; this is a “faithful” transposition of its prototype in the damning sense of the word—a would-be replacement of the book. It is an ancillary product whose basic paradox consists in the fact that the more it strives to complete with its original on an equal footing, the more it proves to be merely derivative from it. Yet, as unrevealing as it might appear at first sight, Freda’s double feature (together, the two episodes last for a total of over three hours) does nonetheless draw our attention to an important sociopolitical fact: that in certain cultural circumstances—for example, the early years of the Cold War, during which the film was shot—an escapist variant of filmmaking will take certain “attractive” (i.e., potentially lucrative) subjects and turn them into films in a form purged of all critical social content. However adventurous and fantastic Hugo’s over-lengthy novel may be, there is more to it than a seemingly endless string of -8-\n\nfunambulist stunts; these are just a conduit for Hugo to convey a message of, to put the matter mildly, social awareness. (In a subtler way, there is a political dimension, too, in many of Pushkin’s only apparently “romantic” stories.) No such luck in Freda’s Les Miserables. Yet the very first scenes in the film feature the hungry young protagonist, Jean Valjean, stealing a loaf of bread from a baker’s and being jailed for it. What more did we need in order to realize that we have here a major social issue on our hands? In the historical frame of the Italy of 1947, it might have been instructive to consult for feedback the landless southern peasants occupying untilled latifondi, or the Sicilian day laborers murdered at Portella della Ginestra by Salvatore Giuliano. Yet no eyes are blinder than those that do not wish to see. In historical perspective, films such as Freda’s Les Miserables are important documents that reveal, first and foremost, a deliberate will to blindness in the act of their production. The repression carried out in the film of an important political connection must—ironically—be described as the most obvious ideological feature of the very strategy that aims at hiding ideology. 13 In sum, Freda’s works embody in accomplished form the cinematic typology of the romanzo popolare or penny dreadful. They are a historical continuation of the productions that in the first half-century after the invention of cinema in 1895 served as a substitute for literature for people who were barely, or not at all, able to read. Mario Camerini was easily, along with Alessandro Blasetti, the best director of the 1930s in Italy: soft-spoken, inward-looking, with a keen eye for psychology—and definitely as un-Fascist a filmmaker as one could afford to be in the circumstances. (Not coincidentally, he more than once worked with De Sica and Zavattini.) It should thus not be surprising if, appearances notwithstanding, Camerini’s The Captain’s Daughter (La figlia del capitano, 1947) turns out to be much more than the usual run-of-the-mill adventure story. Of course, the film’s prototype was a good place to look for psychological subtlety. 14 In Pushkin’s Kapitanskaia dochka (1836), the calendar marks the year 1773; Pugachëv’s rebellious Cossacks, Tatars, and land-hungry serfs are coming. A small, exposed fort in the steppe is held by a few Russians: peasant families, the soldiers of the garrison, captain Mironov, his wife, his angelic daughter Masha, and a few young officers stranded there either for want of better luck or in punishment for their past misbehavior. Shvabrin, the villain, has been thrown out of the Imperial Guard in the capital for killing a man in a duel; Grinëv, the hero, has to contend with a particularly strict father. Both Shvabrin and Grinëv are in love with Masha; but Masha loves Grinëv. There are a couple of good reasons for this: Shvabrin is ugly—and he speaks French with too much gusto to be a reassuring figure to the shy girl. The bearded and mustachioed Pugachëv storms the fort, takes it, and executes almost the entire garrison, captain and wife included. Masha hides. To save his skin, Shvabrin -9-\n\njoins the self-proclaimed czar. Pugachëv recognizes Grinëv as the young lord who a few months before had saved his life during a deadly blizzard by offering him one of his own fur coats. Chivalrous to a fault, the good savage, the rebel hero untainted by civilization, heeds the call of honor: he spares Grinëv and sets him free. Pugachëv then puts Shvabrin in charge of the fort and moves on in his campaign. Masha is now in the villain’s hands. Grinëv rushes to the nearest walled city, Orenburg, to whip up support there for an expedition to retake the fort. His plan, however, fails. Meanwhile, Orenburg itself is besieged. Worse, Masha writes that Shvabrin wants her to marry him, failing which he threatens to deliver her as a prostitute to the rebels’ encampment. Horrified, Grinëv leaves Orenburg and flies to Masha’s defense—and in so doing he technically defects to the enemy. Grinëv soon stands again before the upright rebel, and in less than no time puts his cards down: he tells Pugachëv that there is a young woman at the fort, his fiancée, who is being mistreated. The gamble pays off. Pugachëv does not bat an eyelash: “You should have told me sooner,” he cheerfully cries. “Justice must reign in my wide lands. As soon as circumstances permit, we’ll marry the two of you, and throw in a banquet to boot.” Until such time Pugachëv once more allows Grinëv—now in Masha’s company—to go free. The two immediately set out to reach the Russian side. Grinëv sends Masha to Orenburg, then dutifully joins the army’s campaign against the rebels. The war rages on until the summer of 1774, when Pugachëv is defeated and captured. Is this the end of our heroes’ trials? Quite the opposite: Pushkin now describes how they have to face their enemies in a context no less dangerous than the previous one. With the peace comes bad news: Grinëv, suspected of treason, is arrested and put on trial for leaving his post. At the trial, for fear of exposing Masha to the unpleasantness of cross-examination, he avoids mentioning her. Without her testimony, his version of the events is unsupported. Furthermore, Shvabrin, who appears as a witness, accuses his rival of having actively collaborated with the rebels. Grineëv is sentenced to death by the military court. Having learned this, Masha rushes to St. Petersburg and attempts to meet the Empress Catherine II at her summer residence in Tsarskoe Selo. In the park that surrounds the palace, Masha encounters a mysterious lady, who listens to her story intently. This is none other than the empress, herself. Soon Masha obtains Grinëv’s release. Pushkin’s two lovers can now marry and proliferate happily ever after on their estate near Simbirsk. There is much to praise in certain aspects of Camerini’s film, the protagonists’ characterization first and foremost (Pugachëv’s measured grandeur, Shvabrin’s crystalline shamelessness, Masha’s chaste devotion). Yet there is something which interests me even more. The question I wish to raise here is, To what extent is all this relevant to the Italy of 1947? To a remarkably large extent, in fact—less in the historical facts of the plot than in the cultural connotations of the way in which it is presented. The following is likely to have had little to -10-\n\ndo with Camerini’s conscious choices as an artist and everything to do with the context in which he lived. At the precise time of the conflict over the contested eastern border with Yugoslavia, and in the period immediately before the elections of April 1948 that were to define whether Italy would lock in with the American-led Western bloc or with the pro-Soviet Eastern one, the frenzy of political propaganda in Italy was such that the rhetoric of the “Westernizers” did not shrink from describing the “Slavophile” hordes as anthropophagous barbarians likely to eat Italian children at the first sign of the red votes approaching 51 percent. Without denying that on the Italo-Yugoslav border a large number of hate crimes did in fact occur at the end of the war—crimes triggered in the first place by the aggression unleashed by the Fascist regime against its eastern neighbor—most historians today would probably consider the charge of anthropophagy leveled at the would-be invaders as exaggerated. Stereotypes, however, thrived in the late 1940s—and what better stereotypes to apply to Pushkin’s Russians than the very ones attributable to their distant descendants in 1947? Hence, in Camerini’s retelling of Kapitanskaia dochka, a great number of elements do not merely convey a generic exoticism, but specifically suggest its gory Russianness. The following are a few narrative details in La figlia del capitano—substantially modifying Pushkin’s plot rendered above—that in retrospect strike one as functional to the foregrounding of the threatening, irrational, uncontrollable, or in any way dangerous traits of Russians: Russians as drunkards and gamblers. On the eve of his accession to the Imperial Guard, young Grinëv gets smashed and gambles away his new uniform. He is sent to the steppe as punishment. Russians as weirdly subverting the decorum of civilized society. Camerini’s Vasilisa Egorovna Mironova, the captain’s wife, receives the newcomer Grinëv while puffing on her pipe and bossing around the soldiers of the garrison, as her husband ought to do (but doesn’t). Russians as cruel and barbaric. The Bashkir freedom fighter who falls into the Russian army’s hands has already had such a distinction before (during the insurrection of 1741)—and had already been rewarded for it by having his nose, ears, and tongue cut off. The film displays the maimed outlaw’s face in full, graphic detail. And during the rebels’ festive meal that follows the occupation of the fort, the renegade Shvabrin advises Pugachëv to have Grinëv’s tongue cut out, it being appropriate “to punish only that part of his body which, in refusing to hail you as Czar Peter III, has offended you.” Russia as a despotic country, the empress as a vapid tyrant. Camerini’s empress twice refuses to believe Masha’s version of the the events. The first time, she is incognito in the park of her palace. On the second occasion, Masha elbows her way past crowds of soldiers and courtiers, and confronts a suzerain deeply engrossed in the preparation of a fashionable soirée. However, her plea fails (in part, perhaps, because it is rambling and unfocused; in the Italy of 1947, a short, sharp plea about social injustice would have endowed the story with politically subversive implications—something the film -11-\n\nwishes to avoid like the plague. For Grinëv, thus, death it will be. Only Pugachëv’s testimony will persuade the empress to pardon Grinëv at the last moment. Also deserving of mention is the film’s particular effort to reproduce simple costumes (the rebels’ fur-lined leather coats, hats, and so on) and interiors (log huts with unfinished walls and a vividly authentic steppe look). How does all of the above appear in Pushkin? In similar form, one might have thought, extrapolating from the fact that a sizable amount of the original dialogue is retained in Camerini’s film almost verbatim. In fact, the opposite is true. A brief inspection of Pushkin’s text shows how substantially a given narrative can be reaccentuated to say something altogether different in a different context, even if the modifications it undergoes are technically minor. Russians as drunkards and gamblers. There indeed is a reference in Pushkin to Grinëv indulging in an excessive intake of spirits; but that is only to oblige his (lower-class) comrades-in-arms. Anyway, this occurs after the young man’s father has dispatched him to the fort in the steppe—a decision the father takes for reasons entirely unrelated to alcohol: Petrusha is not going to Petersburg. What would he learn if he did his service there? To be a spendthrift and a rake? No, let him serve in the army and learn the routine of it, and know the smell of powder and be a soldier and not a fop in the Guards! 15 The original Grinëv—who has never served in Petersburg—thus does not end up in rebel territory as punishment for rowdy behavior. Russians as weirdly subverting the decorum of civilized society. In Pushkin, the captain’s wife does not smoke a pipe. She is presented and characterized instead in the following manner: An elderly lady, dressed in a Russian jacket and with a kerchief on her head, was sitting by the window. She was winding yarn which a one-eyed old man in an officer’s uniform held for her on his outstretched hands. “What do you need, batyushka?” she asked me, going on with her work. 16 Clearly, she is an unrefined woman from the country, but not the quasi virago she is made out to be in the film. This is Pushkin, after all, not Gogol. Russians as cruel and barbaric. Pushkin’s narrator prepares for the presentation of the maimed Bashkir insurgent through some strongly worded comments on the cruelty of torture and against the reluctance of some judges of the “old times” to apply a “beneficent law which abolished it.” (If this sounds insufficiently incendiary today, we should remember that in 1773 Beccaria’s An Essay on Crimes and Punishments [Dei delitti e delle pene 1764], had been in print for less than a decade.) Only then is the old man’s appearance described. After that is done, the narrator provides a final wrapup of his own: -12-\n\nWhen I recall that this happened in my lifetime, and that now I have lived to see the gentle reign of Emperor Alexander, I cannot but marvel at the rapid progress of enlightenment and the diffusion of humane principles. Young man! If my notes ever fall into your hands, remember that the best and most permanent changes are those due to the softening of manners and morals and not to any violent upheavals. 17 While there is every reason to suspect that the praise of Czar Alexander ought to be taken rather antiphrastically (he had exiled Pushkin to the Caucasus), it would be arbitrary to conclude that therefore the point made in the last sentence quoted is not “really” meant by the novel’s narrator. Clearly, Camerini’s cinematic re-creation does not apply with equal thoroughness to the duplication of all narrative elements in Pushkin’s novel. The film’s re-creation of its prototype is altogether selective (i.e., it follows a discernible ideological pattern). And as for Shvabrin’s suggestion at the banquet that Grinëv be hauled in, questioned, cornered, and merrily detongued, in Pushkin Shvabrin is, quite simply, not present at the dinner table. 18 Russia as a despotic country, the empress as a vapid tyrant. In the novel, shortly after Masha has met the mysterious lady in the Tsarskoe Selo park, an imperial carriage stops to pick up the girl at the inn where she is lodged, and takes her to the palace. Pushkin describes in rapid tempo what happens to her next. Trembling with emotion, Masha walked up the stairs. She was led through a number of deserted, spacious, luxuriously furnished rooms. Finally, the doors to the empress’s dressing room were flung open, revealing to Masha the lady to whom she had been talking just a few minutes before. The empress called her to her side and said, with a smile: “I am glad that I have been able to keep my promise to you, and to grant your request. Your case is settled. I am convinced that your betrothed is innocent. Here is a letter, which please take yourself to your future father-in-law.” Mar’ia Ivanovna took the letter with a trembling hand and fell, weeping, at the feet of the empress, who lifted her up, kissed her and engaged her in conversation. “I know you are not rich,” she said, “but I am in debt to Captain Mironov’s daughter. Do not worry about the future. I will provide for you.” 19 No guards here, no crowds, no elbows, no melodramatic pleas, no partying at court, no death warrant—but imperial pardon, and an unexpected dowry. It is astonishing to measure, upon examination, to what an extent Camerini’s Catherine modifies Pushkin’s. An enlightened, providential dea ex machína was clearly not an acceptable figure with which to close a film that needed to represent things Russian through the negative prism typical of a particular cultural-historical moment in Italian history. 20 All this is well and good, one might think, but aren’t we arguing after the fact about the logic of a development which anyway cannot be experimentally falsified? Where is the argument’s counterproof? In nonexperimental sciences, this is always a ponderous objection; yet it turns out that this time there is something very close to a counterproof. Just over a -13-\n\ndecade after Camerini’s, not-so-subconscious tocsin about the dangers of voting for semibarbaric tyrants with large mustaches, Lattuada reinterpreted Kapitanskaia dochka in his The Storm. He did so from a viewpoint entirely different from Camerini’s, yielding a very differently oriented kolossal (large-scale production). But it was by then 1958; under the protection of a NATO nuclear umbrella, the Italian miracolo economico had taken firm roots; and Sputnik was warming up its engines for an entirely unbarbaric takeoff from the launching pad. Stalin had been dead for a while, and the world was then perceivable with a wide angle and in bright Technicolor. Only eleven years after Camerini’s black-and-white Pushkin, the Italians who viewed Lattuada’s The Storm lived in a different world than they used to; even when the same prototext was re-created for them in a film, they watched a different world on the screens of their cinemas. 21 In the 1940s and 1950s, Roberto Rossellini, one of the most important directors in the history of Italian cinema, repeatedly drew on European literary traditions for his filmmaking. He made three such works in the period under scrutiny: A Human Voice, Joan of Arc Burned at the Stake, and Fear. Rossellini’s A Human Voice (Una voce umana, 1947) was shot with Jean Cocteau—who was both a playwright and a film director. Combined with The Miracle (Il miracolo) (written by Fellini, who also played a role in it), the film was released the following year under the collective title Love (L’amore). A Human Voice duplicates the text of Cocteau’s one-act monologue, The Human Voice (La voix humaine, 1930). 22 A young woman, jilted by her lover, in a telephone conversation clings to the most tenuous trace of attention on his part. Following, for over half an hour, the capricious convolutions of the departed lover’s mood, the female protagonist covers the entire gamut of postamorous feelings, from renewed hope to self-conscious dignity to utter dejection. Cocteau’s text is a tour de force that fully exploits the scenic potential of a technology relatively exclusive before the 1930s, the telephone, and requires superior ability from the actor impersonating—so to speak—two parts at once. Anna Magnani, whose relationship with Rossellini began around the time the film was made, gave just such a performance— a performance made all the more remarkable, one could argue, by the fact that it went against the grain of her commonly accepted filmic persona (to say nothing of her empirically verifiable personality). In 1947, what could be called the avant-garde or experimental aspect of Cocteau’s play was a thing of the past; surrealism, in vogue throughout the 1930s, had by then been replaced by a stunned meditation over the silence of a couple of continents’ worth of rubble. In the transition from book to film, the new historical situation gave Cocteau’s piece a new context, and thus inevitably a new meaning. What now stood out was no longer its experimental or technical -14-\n\naspect, but its content emphasizing solitude—a solitude brought about by a breakdown in communication. Indeed, hardly any expository structure would seem able to render the sullen atmosphere of the late 1940s more fully than a performance centered entirely on the inability of a human voice to elicit any response whatever from its presumed counterpart. In A Human Voice, the other voice has become a noumenon, a thing-in-itself that the subject’s consciousness can only postulate, but not verify. Although one should be wary of facile sociologisms in extrapolating between contiguous yet separate realms of human experience, one cannot avoid confronting the fact that, with the onset of the Cold War, an abrupt breakdown in communication appears as the single obvious feature of the years 1947–48, not only in Italy but across the globe as well. In view of this, the theme of A Human Voice seems ideal to transcribe onto the human register events and motions occurring in the political and social sphere. Aprà is entirely correct in arguing that in this film Rossellini focuses “on irrational residues, on the global condition of the human being during the postwar period, in Italy as well as in Europe. His is not necessarily a criticism. As ever, Rossellini wants to know rather than to judge.” 23 It can be no coincidence either that, in the passage from Cocteau’s play to Rossellini’s film, “La” voix humaine becomes “A” human voice. With the transition from the definite to the indefinite article, universal representativeness is cast aside and a minor, contingent status is embraced. The Western mind can no longer claim to embody, under whatever guise, the voice of humanity; the one, often stammering, voice we do apprehend now is merely one in a vast plurality. No one who, in 1947, had gone through the experience of the war could doubt that, for better or worse, human existence is a collective affair, and each person’s voice is but one among millions. The film marked the beginning of increasingly violent attacks on Rossellini, carried out especially by left-leaning critics who, after having too hastily hailed Rome, Open City and Paisan as engaged in a directly political sense, in this case accused the director of slipping into unpolitical “whateverism” (qualunquismo). It would take conservative and Catholic observers just a few more years—and, above all, Rossellini’s relationship with Ingrid Bergman—to join the Rossellini-bashing troops from the opposite end of the political spectrum. 24 In 1948 Ingrid Bergman had starred in Fleming’s Joan of Arc—but with what qualifications for martyrdom? Hardly any, it would seem, compared to those she had developed by 1954, after years of savage attacks—by critics, intellectuals, politicians, holier-than-thou conservatives, the tabloid press—on herself and her companion Rossellini, guilty of having betrayed the best and brightest from one end of the gamut (Hollywood, in Hollywood’s eyes) to the opposite one (the Lukácsian left, in the eyes of the Lukácsian left). On the path to some ultimate human truth ensconced beyond volcano tops and ancient archaeological finds, Rossellini and Bergman had, in Stromboli, -15-\n\nLand of God (Stromboli, terra di Dio, 1949) attempted to find, and deliberately avoided spelling out, what in the 1920s the poet Eugenio Montale had called by the felicitous term “the formula to open worlds for you.” But the refusal to propose or accept any readymade answers to resolve one’s mal du siècle, though good enough when it came from Montale, was evidently not good enough from Rossellini and Bergman, against whom it was viciously held. 25 It seems as though in those years McCarthy-style witch-hunts were not happening only in politics; art clearly came neck and neck in the contest. Not until Antonioni’s star surfaced, in the entirely different historical atmosphere of the early 1960s, would film critics—slowly at first—begin to intuit that the issues Rossellini had pursued more than a decade earlier possessed an intrinsic philosophical value (quite apart from their potential commercial value to the film industry). By then, however, it was too late; well before the applause started, Rossellini had, typically, changed tack once more, building upon his voyage to India in 1957 to develop an almost exclusive interest in the cultivation of didactic filmmaking. Thus it was that in Rossellini’s Joan of Arc film Ingrid Bergman landed on the stake in more ways than one. Rossellini’s Joan of Arc Burned at the Stake (Giovanna d’Arco al rogo, 1954) is derived from a well-received theatrical tour in which Bergman brought to stages throughout Europe the oratorio Joan of Arc Burned at the Stake (Jeanne d’Arc au bûcher, composed in 1935, first performed in 1938), written by Paul Claudel and set to music by Arthur Honegger. 26 The production we see in the film is that of the Teatro San Carlo in Naples. The rotating spheres of Heaven appear, and against their dark backdrop we witness shining cohorts of angels and saints. Alone at the center of the stage, Giovanna engages in lyrical dialogue with Saint Dominic, who welcomes her among the ranks of the blessed. In flashback, major episodes from Giovanna’s life are evoked and reenacted around her: merry village life, intrigue at the court, her manipulated trial—conducted not by human beings but by animals in men’s garb. We then see Giovanna sentenced, the stake prepared, and the young woman (who has all the while been proclaiming her innocence) eventually chained to it. When the flames are lit, the end of the film coincides with the end of Giovanna’s earthly life—the end of her death, and the beginning of her life eternal. As she ascends to Heaven, she cries: “Here I am! Here! Love is strongest! God is strongest!” (Eccomi! Ecco! L’amore è il più forte! Dio è il più forte!) Rossellini used black backdrops and a multilevel scene to dramatic effect, contravening at his own peril Claudel’s original preference for a virtually motionless stage. In the end, however, the director half-charmed, half arm-twisted Claudel into accepting the final product as the best conduit for what even the irritable author had to acknowledge was Bergman’s superior acting. While there could be no question, due to Claudel’s personality, of Rossellini deviating from his master text, the film nonetheless has a brilliant life of its -16-\n\nown, if only because the mimetic component it can afford as a cinematic artifact is able to bring out the brutish animality of Joan’s judges in a way that will ever remain inimitable for the written page. Claudel may well inscribe as the Court of Law’s motto “We have no judge other than the Pig” 27 and instate the Pig as Judge, the Sheep as Jury, and the Jackass as Secretary; none of that can come close to our seeing with our eyes “sheep,” “pigs,” and “jackasses” skill-fully displayed on the screen, identified in their respective dignities by appropriate signs. Bergman and Rossellini must have derived at least some comfort from meditating on the fate that, since time immemorial, tends to befall prophets in their respective fatherlands. Their regret may well have been that historical verisimilitude had prevented Claudel from appointing film critics to a prominent incarnation in the tribunal’s animal farm. 28 Shortly after Giovanna d’Arco, the history of Italian cinema records Rossellini’s Fear (La paura, 1954–55), re-created from Stefan Zweig’s novella of the same title (Die Angst, 1925). The theoretical premises on which the film was based were very much the same as those underpinning Giovanna d’Arco:we cannot forever shoot films in cities reduced to debris, he attempted to explain to those who only expected of him sequels to Rome, Open City, Paisan, and Germany Year Zero. He could have been even more precise and argued as follows: it is exactly because my detractors so vehemently espouse the tenets of realism that they ought to take into account the transformations in the decade after World War II; far from condemning our quest for new themes, they ought instead to impel us directors toward a “realism” defined not in the terms of a season now bygone, but in those of the present, alive one. Yet how many times can artists be told by all and sundry that they are in the wrong (or worse) before they lose self-assurance and, with it, the lightness of touch that alone can disprove their critics’ charges? Moreover—a far from unrelated question—how often is it possible for film directors to obtain the material means necessary to produce a work of art that fully corresponds to their artistic persuasion? Such were the problems Rossellini had to contend with in making Fear. Irene is the wife of Alberto, a pharmaceutical industrialist, and works with her husband in the factory’s laboratory. Deeply unhappy in her marriage, she has long had a lover, Enrico, without suspecting that her husband, aware of her relationship, has for just as long been observing her behavior. Both Irene’s sense of guilt and her admiration for her husband’s apparent equanimity are thus sorely misplaced. Johanna, a woman who claims to have been Enrico’s lover in the past, blackmails Irene into making ever-higher payments for her silence. When the stakes become unaffordable, Irene, in despair, calls the bluff—and discovers that Johanna has actually been in cahoots with Alberto all along. Deeply shaken by this discovery, Irene goes to the lab, where she prepares to commit suicide. Moments before she takes poison normally used in scientific experiments, Alberto arrives, confessing to having masterminded this other experiments of sorts. When -17-\n\nIrene admits to her ow"
