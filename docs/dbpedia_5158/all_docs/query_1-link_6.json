        "text": "1. FIRST PERIOD. Forms that involved continuous or near-continuous filming operations that did not use conventional film editing, and except for HARMONICA were silent. The movements in the silent films had analogies with sound, and paved the way for my later work with sound. Films were \"meditative,\" related to minimalism, imagery typically related to landscape. Partially concerned with relation of film to painting, and the analogies between camera possibilities and the activities of consciousness.\n\nBLUES (1969) 8 ½ minutes, silent, 16fps.\n\nCORN (1970) 11 minutes, silent, 24fps\n\nFOG LINE (1970) 10 ½ minutes, silent, 24 fps\n\nDOORWAY (1970) 7 ½ minutes, silent, 16 fps\n\nTHOUGHT (1970, re-titled 1980) 7 ½ minutes, silent, 16fps\n\nHARMONICA (1971) 10 ½ minutes, sound, 24 fps\n\nBARN RUSHES (1971) 34 minutes, silent, 16 fps.\n\nSee Scott MacDonald, A Critical Cinema (U. of California, 1988) and Maureen Turim, Abstraction in Avant-Garde Films (Ann Arbor, 1987.)

SECOND PERIOD. \"Elective Affinities,\" a series of four feature-length films, all but the first using sound material in a formally complex manner. Films are edited into a structure involving formal patterning, with repetition and permutation of elements. While formal structuring seems to dominate the initial experience, these films are further developments of my interest in thought and consciousness in cinema, and include elements of autobiography and a particularly cinematic way of exploring issues such as family, psychology, education, freedom, the theme of \"nature\" in art. See Maureen Turim, \"'Elective Affinities': Larry Gottheim's Cinematic Quaternion,\" Afterimage (Rochester, NY) 12, 8, March 1985.\n\nHORIZONS, Part 1, “Overture” to “Elective Affinities” (1971-73) 75 minutes.
