        "text": "From Tuesday 8th to Friday 18th July the French Academy in Rome – Villa Medici will once again open its splendid gardens to Cinéma en plein air , a film festival dedicated this year to Isabelle Huppert , who will present her films at the festival. The eighth edition of Cinéma en plein air is a heartfelt homage to her talent, offering some of her best films, which she has personally chosen with a special attention to Italy. The program includes some of the most important authors of the Italian cinema with whom the actress has worked, as well as films set in Italy. During her career, this extraordinary actress has been defined by critics as “sublime”, “exceptional”, “surprising” and “a talent with incredible temperament and class”. Chosen by the greatest directors of the past decades, Isabelle Huppert may be defined as the “last diva” of worldwide cinema. After the success of its previous editions dedicated to Michel Piccoli (2013) and Marcello and Chiara Mastroianni (2012), the eighth edition of Cinéma en plein air confirms this unique appointment of the French Academy in Rome – Villa Medici’s summer programs, which has won the acclaim of both public and critics: a recognition of the validity of this formula which combines well-known masterpieces with yet-to-be-discovered films, presented in their original version in the splendid setting of the gardens of Villa Medici.
