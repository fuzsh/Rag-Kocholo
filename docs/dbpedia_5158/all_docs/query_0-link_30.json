        "text": "Required Screening: Fifteen Must-See Films for the Art-House Connoisseur, 1924-1980 is a film analysis textbook that contains 15 essays on 15 historically significant, artistically superior films released between 1924 and 1980. Written with college and university students (and possibly also advanced high school students) in mind, these essays cover some of the central films treated—and central issues raised—in today’s cinema courses and provide students with practical models to help them improve their own writing and analytical skills.\n\nThis casebook is geographically diverse, with 10 countries represented: Germany, Russia, the United States, France, Italy, Sweden, Japan, India, Cuba, and Australia. Moreover, the essays in Required Screening are clear and readable—that is, sophisticated and meaty yet not overly technical or jargon-heavy. This makes them perfect introductions to their respective films as well as important contributions to the field of film studies in general. In addition, the book’s critical apparatus features credits, images, and bibliographies for all films discussed, filmographies for all the directors, a glossary of film terms, a guide to film analysis, and a list of topics for writing and discussion."
