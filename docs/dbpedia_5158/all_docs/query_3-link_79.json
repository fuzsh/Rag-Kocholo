Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, showtimes and ticket information: nytimes.com/theater.\n\nPreviews and Openings\n\n‘Blood and Gifts’ (in previews; opens on Nov. 21) This new play from J. T. Rogers is a spy-versus-spy drama laced with black humor, described as evoking the worlds of Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh. Directed by Bartlett Sher, the Lincoln Center Theater commission examines the Soviet-Afghan war of the 1980s through the eyes of a C.I.A. operative. Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (David Rooney)\n\n‘Bonnie & Clyde’ (in previews; opens on Dec. 1). For many of us, Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow will forever have the faces of Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty, who starred in Arthur Penn’s ageless 1967 movie. But the composer Frank Wildhorn, the lyricist Don Black and the book writer Ivan Menchell look at the outlaw lovers from fresh angles in this new musical, directed by Jeff Calhoun and starring Laura Osnes and Jeremy Jordan. Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)\n\n‘Burning’ (in previews; opens on Monday) The New Group opens its season with Thomas Bradshaw’s intersecting stories of self-invention and sexual identity, spanning two eras. Scott Elliott directs the play, about a provocative black painter whose work causes a stir in Berlin, and a teenage aspiring actor, recently orphaned, who is taken in by a gay couple in the New York theater industry. Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)\n\n‘The Cherry Orchard’ (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Dec. 4) Classic Stage Company invariably attracts top-tier actors to its idiosyncratic productions of Chekhov. The ensemble for this latest, directed by Andrei Belgrader, includes John Turturro, Dianne Wiest, Daniel Davis, Alvin Epstein, Josh Hamilton, Roberta Maxwell, Juliet Rylance, Michael Urie and the sisters Elisabeth and Katherine Waterston, whose dad is tackling Lear a few blocks away at the Public. Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Rooney)\n\n‘Elective Affinities’ (previews start on Thursday; opens on Dec. 2) How does quality time with Zoe Caldwell in an Upper East Side town house sound? This new site-specific play by David Adjmi (“Stunning”) will provide that pleasure for 30 people an evening. Ms. Caldwell plays the octogenarian wit Alice Hauptmann, who holds court about civilized society over tea and sandwiches at a location to be disclosed to ticket-holders 48 hours prior to each performance. Sarah Benson directs this collaboration by Soho Rep, Piece by Piece Productions and Rising Phoenix Repertory. The Hauptmann Residence, (212) 352-3101, hauptmannresidence.com. (Rooney)\n\n‘An Evening With Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin’ (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Nov. 21) With a major revival of “Evita” due this spring, these two performers — who appeared together on Broadway for the first time in that show as Eva Perón and Che (and took home matching Tony Awards) — reunite to reminisce and perform some of the greatest material written for the stage. Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)\n\n‘Fragments’ (in previews; opens on Sunday) A glimpse “into the filthy abyss of human existence” is how the iconoclastic director Peter Brook describes the work of Samuel Beckett. But he points to the playwright’s humor as what saves us from falling in. Working with his regular collaborator Marie-Hélène Estienne, Mr. Brook tests that theory in this staging of five Beckett shorts, presented by Theater for a New Audience for 29 performances only. Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, tfana.org. (Rooney)\n\n‘Happy Hour’ (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Dec. 5) Before he started rubbing shoulders with Woody Allen and Elaine May with “Relatively Speaking” on Broadway, the filmmaker Ethan Coen was regularly cooking up one-act comedy trilogies for the Atlantic Theater Company. His third set, again directed by Neil Pepe, appears to be ironically titled given its lineup of an embittered barfly, two lonely young people blind to their mutual compatibility and a suicidal business traveler. Signature Theater Company’s Peter Norton Space, 552 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney)\n\n‘Horsedreams’ (in previews; opens on Thursday) Dael Orlandersmith’s new play explores the breakdown of a family as the result of addiction, leaving a man to face the difficult reality of raising his son alone. Gordon Edelstein directs a cast of four that includes Ms. Orlandersmith. Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney)\n\n‘How Much Is Enough: Our Values in Question’ (in previews; opens on Sunday) This Foundry Theater production, written by Kirk Lynn and directed by Melanie Joseph, ponders questions large and small about our shifting priorities, as the company members seek answers from one another and from the audience in a show that changes from night to night. St. Ann’s Warehouse, 38 Water Street, Brooklyn, (718) 854-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Rooney)\n\n‘The Infernal Comedy: Confessions of a Serial Killer’ (opens on Thursday) You were expecting warm and fuzzy from John Malkovich? The writer and director Michael Sturminger refashions the real-life story of the Austrian serial killer Jack Unterweger, as a tell-all memoir from beyond the grave. This pitch-black stage piece for Mr. Malkovich, a chamber orchestra and two sopranos plays only for four performances as part of Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Next Wave Festival. Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Rooney)\n\n‘Lysistrata Jones’ (previews start on Saturday; opens on Dec. 14) Douglas Carter Beane and Lewis Flinn’s (literally) bouncy Aristophanes update transports the sexually withholding women of ancient Greece onto the basketball court of modern-day Athens University. “It’s Your Duty: No More Booty” becomes the girls’ strategy to spur their guys to a win. Directed and choreographed by Dan Knechtges, this Transport Group production graduates from its site-specific Off Broadway run to the big time in a season that so far is light on new musicals. Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (David Rooney)\n\n‘On a Clear Day You Can See Forever’ (previews start on Saturday; opens on Dec. 11) Daisy Gamble has become David in Michael Mayer’s reconceived production of the much-loved but seldom-seen Burton Lane and Alan Jay Lerner musical about a widowed psychiatrist who becomes romantically bewitched by the previous-life incarnation of one of his patients. Peter Parnell wrote the new book for the show, which stars Harry Connick Jr., David Turner and Jessie Mueller. St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)\n\n‘Once’ (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Dec. 6) The micro-budget 2007 Irish independent film about the romance between a Dublin musician and a Czech immigrant became a surprise hit and made international music stars (and Oscar-winning songwriters) of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. Brought to the stage by the playwright Enda Walsh and the director and the choreographer of “Black Watch,” John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett, this musical is being eyed by theater pundits as a potential Broadway entry. It stars Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, nytw.org. (Rooney)\n\n‘Private Lives’ (in previews; opens on Thursday) Kim Cattrall and the Canadian actor Paul Gross play the divorced couple whose romance is inconveniently rekindled in Noël Coward’s diamantine 1930 comedy of manners. Richard Eyre’s revival was first staged last year in the West End of London, where Ms. Cattrall has been a frequent presence since the end of her “Sex and the City” television commitments. This production brings her back to Broadway for the first time in almost 25 years. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)\n\n‘Seminar’ (in previews; opens on Nov. 20) The in-demand director Sam Gold makes his Broadway debut with this new comedy from Theresa Rebeck. Lily Rabe, Hamish Linklater, Jerry O’Connell and Hettienne Park play aspiring novelists who sign up for classes with a formidable international literary lion, endowed with the acid tongue and droll delivery of Alan Rickman. John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)\n\n‘Standing on Ceremony: the Gay Marriage Plays’ (in previews; opens on Sunday) An impressive roster of playwrights contributed to this lineup of short plays celebrating courage in relationships, among them Mo Gaffney, Jordan Harrison, Moises Kaufman, Neil LaBute, Paul Rudnick and Doug Wright. In a production designed to run with a rotating cast, the premiere ensemble includes Craig Bierko, Mark Consuelos, Polly Draper, Harriet Harris, Beth Leavel and Richard Thomas. Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, East Village, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Rooney)\n\n‘Wild Animals You Should Know’ (in previews; opens on Nov. 20) A wilderness scout camp provides the setting for an erotically charged game of cat and mouse between two unlikely male friends in this new play by Thomas Higgins. Directed by Trip Cullman, the MCC Theater production has a six-member cast that includes Patrick Breen, Gideon Glick and Alice Ripley. Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, mcctheater.org. (Rooney)\n\nBroadway\n\n★ ‘The Book of Mormon’ This delightful collaboration between the creators of “South Park” (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) and the composer of “Avenue Q” (Robert Lopez) is blasphemous, scurrilous and as pure-hearted as a Rodgers and Hammerstein show. No musical has so successfully had it both ways since “The Producers.” Casey Nicholaw is the witty co-director (with Mr. Parker) and choreographer (2:15). Eugene O’Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)\n\n‘Chinglish’ David Henry Hwang’s sporadically funny comedy about a bewildered American businessman seeking his fortune in capitalist China is laid out with the frame-by-frame exactness of a comic strip. That means this bilingual production is easy to follow but hard to embrace with enthusiasm. Leigh Silverman directs (2:00). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)\n\n★ ‘Follies’ The Kennedy Center’s revival of James Goldman and Stephen Sondheim’s musical about a reunion of Ziegfeld-style performers looks back as much in anger as in fondness, and that’s what makes it so vibrant. Eric Schaeffer directs an electric cast led by Bernadette Peters, Jan Maxwell, Danny Burstein and Ron Raines (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)\n\n‘Godspell’ Oh, dear Lord: the beloved 1971 musical that turned biblical parables into teachable moments has been stuffed fruitcake-full of jokey contemporary allusions. Performed by a peppy young cast, this show is like being stuck in a rec room with kids who have been too reckless with the Red Bull (2:30). Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)\n\n‘How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying’ Not a natural song-and-dance man, Daniel Radcliffe tries really, really hard as the amoral hero of this 1961 Frank Loesser musical about corporate ladder-climbing. Rob Ashford directed this largely charm-free revival (2:40). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)\n\n‘Man and Boy’ When Frank Langella plays good, he’s fine; but when he’s bad, he’s a wonder. Here the actor who starred as Dracula and Nixon is charismatically amoral as a 1930s financier who wreaks havoc with other people’s money. He is also the one compelling reason to see this revival of Terence Rattigan’s 1963 drama, directed by Maria Aitken (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)\n\n‘The Mountaintop’ Katori Hall’s surprisingly thin new drama, which won the 2010 Olivier Award, depicts the last night in the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (Samuel L. Jackson) and his encounter with a feisty motel maid (Angela Bassett). Perhaps best regarded as a comfort play, a nursery-room fable for grownups (1:40). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)\n\n★ ‘Other Desert Cities’ Jon Robin Baitz’s family drama is so good that you may not even realize how good it is while you’re watching it. Joe Mantello directs a sublime five-member cast who expertly elicit the pain and the comfort of blood ties: Stockard Channing, Rachel Griffiths, Stacy Keach, Judith Light and Thomas Sadoski (2:15). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)\n\n‘Priscilla Queen of the Desert’ The 1994 movie about Australian drag queens in the outback becomes a hyperactively splashy karaoke musical so desperate to show the audience a gaudy good time that the results are mostly enervating. Tony Sheldon brings some warmth as the transsexual Bernadette, but the show is mostly a riot of spangles, sequins and silly costumes (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)\n\n‘Relatively Speaking’ This slight but mostly enjoyable trio of short plays by Ethan Coen, Elaine May and Woody Allen won’t do much to burnish their established reputations, but the show is chock full of nifty shtick. Marlo Thomas delights as a pampered princess with a dead husband in Ms. May’s contribution (2:15). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)\n\n‘Sister Act’ When the good sisters of the Church of Philly Soul are rocking to raise the gothic rafters, led by the radiant Patina Miller, all is right with this stage adaptation of the hit movie about a club singer hiding out as a nun. Otherwise, this story of a bad girl teaching some good ones how to get down is innocuous but generic musical theater (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)\n\n‘Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark’ This retooled mega-expensive musical is no longer an ungodly, indecipherable mess. It’s just a bore. Recommended for less-than-precocious children with a hundred dollars to burn (2:45). Foxwoods Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (800) 745-3000, spidermanonbroadway.marvel.com. (Brantley)\n\n★ ‘Venus in Fur’ The incandescent Nina Arianda recreates her dazzling turn as an actress auditioning for the role of a 19th-century dominatrix in David Ives’s seriously funny sex comedy about power games at an audition. Hugh Dancy holds his own as the writer-director who may be discovering more than he wants to know about the destabilizing nature of desire (1:45). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)\n\n‘War Horse’ This imported British weepie, adapted from Michael Morpurgo’s children’s book about a cavalry horse in World War I, has the most charismatic matinee idol seen in ages: that’s Joey, the title character, a puppet brought to life-size life with ineffably theatrical magic (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, (800) 432-7250, lincolncenter.org. (Brantley)\n\nOff Broadway\n\n★ ‘The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs’ The accomplished monologuist Mike Daisey weaves the story of the Apple co-founder’s life and vision into a darker exploration of the troubling economic disparities that underlie our technology-obsessed age. Smart, engaging and funny, but be warned that you might have second thoughts about purchasing that next shiny gadget (1:50). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Isherwood)\n\n‘All-American’ Julia Brownell’s appealing if perhaps too tidy play depicts the struggles of a high school quarterback who happens to be female, and who has begun to question her commitment to the sport (1:40). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010, dukeon42.org. (Isherwood)\n\n‘Asuncion’ Jesse Eisenberg plays a confirmed slacker in a bromance with his former African studies professor (Justin Bartha) in this genial wisp of a comedy written by Mr. Eisenberg (1:40). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, rattlestick.org. (Isherwood)\n\n‘The Atmosphere of Memory’ It’s hard to decide which is more ludicrous: David Bar Katz’s backstage drama about a theatrical family (mom’s Ellen Burstyn, dad’s John Glover) or the play within the play, a weird mashup of Greek tragedy, Strindberg and Gilbert and Sullivan (2:20). Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 513-1080, labtheater.org. (Isherwood)\n\n‘The Berenstain Bears Live! in Family Matters, the Musical’ The most famous bears since the three in the Goldilocks story are now onstage in this adaptation of three of the titles in the long-running children’s book series by Stan and Jan Berenstain. The show, by Michael Borton and Michael Slade, offers a pleasant hour for small theatergoers, with a pop-flavored score and actors who inhabit their fuzzy roles enthusiastically. But like the books, it’s rather tame and tidy; after this many years of a formula, even the Berenstain cubs are starting to show their age. Saturday and Sunday only (:55). Manhattan Movement & Arts Center, 248 West 60th Street, (866) 811-4111, berenstainbearslive.com. (Laurel Graeber)\n\n‘The Blue Flower’ Jim Bauer’s alluring music isn’t enough to give this high-minded muddle of a musical sufficient cogency as it races across Europe in the early decades of the 20th century, telling a convoluted story of artists and scientists in love and war (2:15). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood)\n\n‘Children’ The Actor Company Theater’s crisp revival of this rarely produced play from 1974 by A.R. Gurney (“The Dining Room,” “The Cocktail Hour”) shows how long he has charted the decline of the wealthy white Anglo-Saxon Protestant culture. In the summer of 1970 an old-line family gathers at the summer house the mother (a regal Darrie Lawrence) will be passing on to her three grown children, the prospect of which shakes loose hopes, dreams and secrets. If, in the end, this small, charming play feels a bit slight, Mr. Gurney’s genteel command of story and structure are obvious (1:30). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, tactnyc.org. (Daniel M. Gold)\n\n★ ‘Cymbeline’ The Fiasco Theater’s charming production brings lucidity, credibility and gentle magic to Shakespeare’s bulky, convoluted tale of star-crossed lovers and schemers in old Britannia, with a multifarious cast of six on a naked stage. Directed by Noah Brody and Ben Steinfeld (2:40). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)\n\n‘Dancing at Lughnasa’ Charlotte Moore’s production falls a little short on atmosphere but works where it counts most, in the spirited performances of the five women playing the poor, unmarriageable Mundy sisters in the fictional Donegal town of Ballybeg in late summer 1936. Two decades after it was first seen, this transporting Tony-winning memory play by the Irish dramatist Brian Friel has lost none of its humanity or delicacy (2:05). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Rooney)\n\n‘The Devil’s Music: The Life and Blues of Bessie Smith’ Miche Braden plays the bawdy-talking, hooch-swilling Bessie Smith in this show that mixes Smith’s songs with talk about her life, loves and career. That format seems a bit tired, but Ms. Braden gives it her all (1:20). St. Luke’s Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)\n\n★ ‘The Judy Show: My Life as a Sitcom’ The writer and stand-up comic Judy Gold may not have realized her dream of starring in a sitcom about being a 6-foot-3 Jewish lesbian mother of two on the Upper West Side, but she has squeezed several seasons’ worth of wry observations about life, career and family into this consistently funny 80-minute monologue, complete with her own droll spins on some classic television theme tunes. For anyone who misses Mary Richards, Maude, Laverne and Shirley, the Bradys, the Partridges and other familiar faces that populated small screens in decades past (primarily the 1970s, but the late ’60s, the ’80s and the early ’90s also get a look), this will be better than an uninterrupted evening of YouTube indulgence (1:20). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)\n\n‘King Lear’ James Macdonald’s production of Shakespeare’s tragedy is full of talented, miscast people, including Michael McKean, John Douglas Thompson, Frank Wood and — most notably — Sam Waterston as a frail and querulous Lear. As the Fool, the great cerebral clown Bill Irwin stands out amid the prevailing gray slush like a daffodil in February (3:20). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)\n\n★ ‘The Lyons’ The actress Linda Lavin and the playwright Nicky Silver slyly reinvent that creaky archetype, the smothering, belittling Jewish mother. This play, Mr. Silver’s best in some years, also reinvents Mr. Silver’s eternal theme of the American family as a sick joke. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes an excellent Michael Esper and Dick Latessa (2:00). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (Brantley)\n\n‘Milk Like Sugar’ Kirsten Greenidge’s provocative play pivots on a pact among three black high school girls to get pregnant at the same time. A terrific cast led by a fierce Tonya Pinkins keeps you hooked even when the play moves into predictable moralizing mode (1:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)\n\n‘Pangs of the Messiah’ To whom does the West Bank belong? That is the question posed by Motti Lerner’s 1986 play, which follows a family of Zionist settlers being evicted from their homes. When peaceful protests fail, the family increasingly becomes radicalized. The awkwardly translated script can be polemical at times, but the production benefits from brisk direction, strong acting and an unusual focus on the internal destruction caused by radicalization, rather than empathy with the enemy (2:20). Theater at the 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, untitledtheater.com. (Rampell)\n\n‘Queen of the Mist’ Michael John LaChiusa’s obsessive musical portrait of an obsessive woman — Anna Edson Taylor, who went over Niagara Falls in a barrel in 1901 — features beautiful music but suffers from the monotony of monomania. The formidable Mary Testa plays Taylor (2:25). The Gym at Judson Memorial Church, 243 Thompson Street, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, transportgroup.org. (Brantley)\n\n‘Rent’ Maybe they should call it “Sublet.” The young cast members who inhabit this premature revival of Jonathan Larson’s watershed rock opera from 1996, directed by Michael Greif, never seem to feel truly at home. It is as if they’re reluctant to make this show their own (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)\n\n‘Silence! The Musical’ An “unauthorized parody” of the grisly movie with the Hannibal Lecter character crooning noxious songs and Jenn Harris giving a hilarious sendup of Jodie Foster’s intense Clarice Starling. Not as funny as it needs to be (1:30). 9th Space Theater at Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, silencethemusical.com. (Isherwood)\n\n‘Sistas: the Musical’ The script is obvious, covering virtually every issue that might touch the lives of black women, but Dorothy Marcic’s good-natured, low-budget musical is all about the songs. From “Ain’t Nobody’s Business if I Do” to “Single Ladies,” you could do a lot worse (1:30). St. Luke’s Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)\n\n‘Sleep No More’ Punchdrunk, a British site-specific theater company, has taken over three abandoned warehouses to enact the sorry sights of the murderous Macbeths’ career as a movable orgy. The result suggests what might have happened if Stanley Kubrick (of “The Shining”) had designed the Haunted Mansion at Disney World (2:00). The McKittrick Hotel, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, sleepnomorenyc.com. (Brantley)\n\n★ ‘Sons of the Prophet’ Stephen Karam’s wonderful new play is a comedy about how we endure the unendurable. Santino Fontana leads a flawless cast in a kaleidoscopic portrait of the woes that befall a family of Lebanese extraction and the people in their orbit. As smart and funny as it is deeply compassionate (1:45). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)\n\n‘Suicide, Incorporated’ Andrew Hinderaker’s black comedy evolves a bit uneasily into sincere drama in telling the story of the workers at a company that ghostwrites suicide notes (1:25). Black Box Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundaboutunderground.org. (Isherwood)\n\n‘Traces’ An energizing evening of acrobatics from the Montreal troupe Seven Fingers. Think of it as cirque du cabaret, in which a group of distinctive talents get to show off the physical equivalents of individual song stylings (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)\n\n‘Voca People’ This show features space aliens, but it’s really all about a cappella music. The visitors have crash-landed on Earth in a ship powered by music, and lots of singing must be done to refuel their ship. The eight singers sound pretty good, despite some overamplification. But most of the show consists of fragments of songs, which becomes annoying; only when the cast is allowed to cut loose and deliver an entire song — the Doors’ ”People Are Strange” is a highlight — do things reach their full potential (1:30). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Neil Genzlinger)\n\nOff Off Broadway\n\n‘The Greenwich Village Follies’ Doug Silver and Andrew Frank’s musical revue about the history of the Village is enthusiastically played and has a few nice numbers, but it feels slapdash and not nearly polished enough to pay proper tribute to its dynamic neighborhood. Sunday only (1:20). The Duplex, 61 Christopher Street, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, thegreenwichvillagefollies.com. (Anita Gates)\n\n‘Mama, I Want to Sing’ A largely new cast (seeded from the Gospel for Teens program in Harlem) gives full-throated life to this long-running gospel musical. Quibbles about the thin plot and questionable acting go out the window with each and every tune — and there are plenty of them. Saturday only (2:00). The Dempsey Theater, 127 West 127th Street, Harlem, (212) 868-4444, mamafoundation.org. (Eric Grode)\n\nExtravaganzas\n\n‘Big Apple Circus: Dream Big’ This one-ring circus may not offer big cats, but it does have large rodents — a capybara and an African crested porcupine, no less — in its new show. Fortunately, the circus has lost none of its intimacy this season, whose highlights include terrific trapeze and acrobatics, bravura magic and the farewell antics of Barry Lubin, doing his final turn as the clown known as Grandma (2:15). Damrosch Park, 62nd Street between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues, Lincoln Center; (888) 541-3750, bigapplecircus.org. (Graeber)\n\nLong-Running Shows\n\n‘The Addams Family’ Kiddie Goth (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com.\n\n‘Anything Goes’ Champagne decanted by Cole Porter (2:30). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com.\n\n‘Avenue Q’ R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com.\n\n‘Million Dollar Quartet’ This jukebox musical relates the day when Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and Elvis Presley all got together for an impromptu jam (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com.\n\n‘Miss Abigail’s Guide to Dating, Mating, & Marriage’ Abigail dispenses advice about romance drawn from vintage health manuals and etiquette guides (1:30). Downstairs Cabaret Theater at Sofia’s, 221 West 46th Street, missabigailsguide.com.\n\n‘Naked Boys Singing’ That’s who they are. That’s what they do (1:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com.\n\n‘Perfect Crime’ The murder mystery that has been investigated since 1987 (1:30). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com.\n\n‘The Phantom of the Opera’ Who was that masked man anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com.\n\n‘Rock of Ages’ Big hair, thrashing guitars and inspired humor fuel this jukebox musical (2:25). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com.\n\n‘Stomp’ And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, 126 Second Avenue, at Eighth Street, East Village, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com.\n\n‘Wicked’ Oz revisited (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com.\n\nLast Chance\n\n‘Intringulis’ (closes on Sunday) Carlo Albán’s engaging one-man show is a modern immigration story told by someone who lived it. (He came to the United States with his family in 1986, when he was 7.) Mr. Albán punctuates the show with Nueva Canción songs that he performs with affection and force. They’re worth the price of admission (1:30). Intar Theater, 500 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, intartheatre.org. (Saltz)\n\n‘Now the Cats With Jewelled Claws’ (closes on Sunday) An all-star cast of downtown stars (Everett Quinton, Erin Markey) turns this obscure, minor one-act by Tennessee Williams into goofy camp fun (1:00). The Club at La MaMa, 74A East Fourth Street, second floor, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org. (Jason Zinoman)"
