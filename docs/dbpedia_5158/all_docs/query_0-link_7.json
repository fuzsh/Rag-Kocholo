        "text": "TORONTO -- Just in case the title doesn't say it all, An Italian Romance is indeed a big, glossy romance set in fascist Italy.\n\nAnd that's the problem.\n\nEverything about the Italian-French co-production has a warmed-over, been-there-done-that quality. Carlo Mazzacurati's film is certainly easy on the eyes, but the banal storytelling and uninteresting characters add up to a production that's as generic as its English-language title.\n\nMeet Giovanni (Stefano Accorsi), a bank clerk who travels by train each day to his job in Livorno, a town that brings back old memories of a steamy interlude he once had with a blonde on the beach.\n\nMeet Maria (Maya Sansa), the blonde in question who's now a brunette. Giovanni doesn't recognize her right away, but pretty soon he's making up for lost time, and the fact that he's got a wife and kid at home doesn't seem to be slowing either of them down.\n\nWhile the performances are fine, the characters just aren't that interesting. Since Giovanni's being married and having a family doesn't seem to faze him in the least, his character is devoid of a conscience, robbing the story of some much needed conflict. Even the onset of World War II seems to be more about giving Giovanni an excuse to look good in a uniform rather than creating any real tension.\n\nDirector Mazzacurati may be saying that when two people are crazy in love, nothing else around them really matters. That's fine for them, but the onlookers need something more substantial than lush lighting and scenic vistas.\n\nScreened\n\nToronto International Film Festival\n\nTORONTO -- In \"Good Morning, Night\" (Buongiorno, Notte), Marco Bellocchio dramatizes one of the most traumatic events in recent Italian history -- the kidnapping and murder of its former prime minister, Aldo Moro, by a Red Brigade faction in 1978. The writer-director's inquiry into this tragedy makes for a moving and intelligent film, but the dark story never feels fully realized. Bellocchio experiments with a number of fictional methods to penetrate the minds of his characters, but not all work -- and some add confusion rather than clarity.\n\nNevertheless, this film will be a must-see in its native land, while festival exposure here and in Venice should lead to theatrical releases in many international territories. The film is certainly one of the better attempts by a European filmmaker to grapple with the terrorist activity that plagued Western Europe in the '70s.\n\nThe film's early moments depict two of the kidnappers, Ernesto Pier Giorgio Bellocchio, the director's son) and Chiara (Maya Sansa), posing as a married couple to rent a large Roman apartment with an underground garage. Here they plan to sequester their victim. Under the leadership of Mariano Luigi Lo Cascio), Primo (Giovanni Calcagno) and the other two design and construct a hiding place behind a bookshelf wall.\n\nThe bloody shootout and kidnapping in broad daylight occur off camera. Chiara learns about it from a TV news bulletin, which alerts her to her colleagues' success and to the imminent arrival of a houseguest.\n\nMoro (Roberto Herlitzka) languishes in the flat for 55 days. During this time, his kidnappers conduct fruitless negotiations with authorities. Moro even writes to the pope to gain concessions that would win his release.\n\nWhile all of this is happening, Bellocchio imagines conversations between Moro and his communist kidnappers, chiefly their ideologue leader Mariano, a dialogue in which the two parties talk past each other. The story is told from the point of view of Chiara, the cell's only woman. Her doubts about the group's action grow with each passing day. She experiences flashbacks (in black-and-white) to the struggle against fascism during World War II, which lead her to wonder whether her colleagues' radical ideology is uncomfortably akin to the fascists'.\n\nAt her job in a library, she develops a relationship with a young man (Paolo Briguglia) who just happens to have written a screenplay about a similar terrorist kidnapping. What Bellocchio wants to achieve here is never clear, nor is the police arrest of her colleague ever explained.\n\nHaving trouble sleeping at night, Chiara experiences dreams when she does fall asleep in which Moro roams freely about the apartment, checking out books in the bookshelf, and later, a fantasy in which she frees him before her pals can kill him.\n\nAs the film moves back and forth between these hallucinations and the tense boredom of the waiting period, during which the cell's members start to suspect one another, the movie loses some of its grip on the audience. Bellocchio's impressionistic approach never quite jells with the more realistic account of the terrorists' methodology. One also wishes that at least one terrorist would offer a cogent rationale for their actions. Indeed, only Chiara seems able to question their motives and goals.\n\nA movie about the Moro incident should be unsettling, and this one is. The failure of ideology to justify such a crime is clearly dramatized by Bellocchio. The actors convey the blindness of much of the European radical left of that era to the consequences of such acts. In the way Bellocchio lights and shoots the claustrophobic flat, he makes clear that everyone is a prisoner there, not just Moro.\n\nGOOD MORNING, NIGHT\n\nA Filmalbatos/RAI Cinema production in association with Sky\n\nCredits:\n\nScreenwriter-director: Marco Bellocchio\n\nProducer: Marco Bellochio, Sergio Pelone\n\nDirector of photography: Pasquale Mari\n\nProduction designer: Marco Dentici\n\nMusic: Riccardo Giagni\n\nCostume designer: Sergio Ballo\n\nEditor: Francesca Calvelli\n\nCast:\n\nChiara: Maya Sansa\n\nMariano: Luigi Lo Cascio\n\nAldo Moro: Roberto Herlitzka\n\nEnzo: Paolo Briguglia\n\nErnesto: Pier Giorgio Bellocchio\n\nPrimo: Giovanni Calcagno\n\nRunning time -- 108 minutes\n\nNo MPAA rating...\n\nToronto International Film Festival\n\nSpanning four decades in late 20th century Italy, Marco Tullio Giordana's \"The Best of Youth\" (La Meglio Gioventu) focuses on the intimate lives of two brothers who take divergent paths, as well as those of friends, lovers and children whose ideals are challenged by events and tragedies in their lives.\n\nSandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli approach their screenplay in a novelistic manner, using a six-hour-plus running time to layer in the details of these lives. This recent Miramax acquisition was originally filmed for Italian television, which explains the length of a movie presented theatrically in two parts. The film proved a major theatrical hit in Italy, but its length limits North American boxoffice to dedicated cineastes and festivalgoers. They will be amply rewarded.\n\nThe film begins in 1966, the year of the flood in Florence that brought out legions of young people determined to save that city's heritage of art and literature. It ends in the present day, which contains the film's only hint of magic realism. These years encompass the political upheaval of 1968 in Western Europe, where young people felt they could change the world\n\nthe tragedy of terrorism in the 1970s\n\nthe ups and downs of the economy\n\nthe Falcone assassination in 1992\n\nand diversion of many characters' energies into family life and coming to terms with feelings of alienation and regret.\n\nOf the brothers we meet in 1966, Matteo (Alessio Boni) is the more withdrawn and sullen, a man sensitive to the wrongs of society but one prone to fits of temper and frustration when things don't go his way. Nicola Luigi Lo Cascio) is more open and loving, at ease with women but reserved, engaged with the world and a seeker of love.\n\nAt a job in a mental hospital, Matteo meets Giorgia (Jasmine Trinca), a severely disturbed young woman who is being given electroshock therapy, the barbarity of which outrages him. When he, his brother and two pals take off on a summer trip to Norway, Matteo kidnaps Giorgia with the vague idea of rescuing her and returning her to her family. Only the family doesn't want her, and police pick her up at a train station.\n\nDiscouraged, Matteo abandons Nicola to return to Rome and impulsively joins the army rather than continuing with his studies. Nicola makes his way to Norway, where, out of money, he takes work in a lumber mill. He returns home to help in the flood in Florence, where he meets Giulia (Sonia Bergamasco), a free-spirited woman who becomes his lover and mother of his child, Sara.\n\nPerhaps inspired by his encounter with Giorgia, Nicola pursues a career in psychiatry in Turin. Meanwhile, Matteo's career in the army and police -- jobs he seeks because they have \"rules\" -- is often jeopardized by a rebellious streak and violent behavior.\n\nWhile on duty in Sicily in the late '70s, Matteo meets Mirella (Maya Sansa), a young photographer he will later encounter in Rome. They have a brief affair before tragedy overtakes Matteo. Meanwhile, Giulia becomes increasingly radicalized and deserts Nicola and Sara to enter the shadowy world of terrorism. Eventually, Nicola is faced with the decision of whether to aid police in capturing his ex-lover before she kills someone.\n\nPerhaps the strongest influence here is Francois Truffaut in his early \"Jules et Jim\" period. For Giordana is less interested in social and political history than in how people fall in and out of love, how families operate and the role friendships play in the characters' lives. Giordana moves beyond psychology, viewing characters' behavior without trying to fully understand or explain them.\n\nLo Cascio and Boni inhabit their roles with keen intellectual and emotional vigor. Bergamasco and Sansa deliver sensitive portraits of conflicted women who struggle to bridge the gap between personal desires and responsibilities to others.\n\nProduction designer Franco Ceraolo and cinematographer Roberto Forza, shooting in Super 16mm, ably convey the changing landscape of Italy. The film's soundtrack consists in large measure of terrific pop songs from different eras.\n\nTHE BEST OF YOUTH\n\nMiramax Films\n\nRai Radiotelevisione Italiana presents a Rai Fiction production\n\nCredits:\n\nDirector: Marco Tullio Giordana\n\nScreenwriters: Sandro Petraglia, Stefano Rulli\n\nProducer: Angelo Barbagallo\n\nDirector of photography: Roberto Forza\n\nProduction designer: Franco Ceraolo\n\nCostume designer: Elisabetta Montaldo\n\nEditor: Roberto Missiroli\n\nCast:\n\nNicola: Luigi Lo Cascio\n\nMatteo: Alessio Boni\n\nGiulia: Sonia Bergamasco\n\nCarlo: Fabrizio\n\nMirella: Maya Sansa\n\nFrancesca: Valentina Carnelutti\n\nGiorgia: Jasmine Trinca\n\nAngelo: Andrea Tidona\n\nRunning time -- 373 minutes\n\nNo MPAA rating...\n\nScreened\n\nToronto International Film Festival\n\nTORONTO -- In \"Good Morning, Night\" (Buongiorno, Notte), Marco Bellocchio dramatizes one of the most traumatic events in recent Italian history -- the kidnapping and murder of its former prime minister, Aldo Moro, by a Red Brigade faction in 1978.

In the way Bellocchio lights and shoots the claustrophobic flat, he makes clear that everyone is a prisoner there, not just Moro.\n\nGOOD MORNING, NIGHT\n\nA Filmalbatos/RAI Cinema production in association with Sky\n\nCredits:\n\nScreenwriter-director: Marco Bellocchio\n\nProducer: Marco Bellochio, Sergio Pelone\n\nDirector of photography: Pasquale Mari\n\nProduction designer: Marco Dentici\n\nMusic: Riccardo Giagni\n\nCostume designer: Sergio Ballo\n\nEditor: Francesca Calvelli\n\nCast:\n\nChiara: Maya Sansa\n\nMariano: Luigi Lo Cascio\n\nAldo Moro: Roberto Herlitzka\n\nEnzo: Paolo Briguglia\n\nErnesto: Pier Giorgio Bellocchio\n\nPrimo: Giovanni Calcagno\n\nRunning time -- 108 minutes\n\nNo MPAA rating...\n\nToronto International Film Festival\n\nSpanning four decades in late 20th century Italy, Marco Tullio Giordana's \"The Best of Youth\" (La Meglio Gioventu) focuses on the intimate lives of two brothers who take divergent paths, as well as those of friends, lovers and children whose ideals are challenged by events and tragedies in their lives.\n\nSandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli approach their screenplay in a novelistic manner, using a six-hour-plus running time to layer in the details of these lives. This recent Miramax acquisition was originally filmed for Italian television, which explains the length of a movie presented theatrically in two parts. The film proved a major theatrical hit in Italy, but its length limits North American boxoffice to dedicated cineastes and festivalgoers. They will be amply rewarded.\n\nThe film begins in 1966, the year of the flood in Florence that brought out legions of young people determined to save that city's heritage of art and literature. It ends in the present day, which contains the film's only hint of magic realism. These years encompass the political upheaval of 1968 in Western Europe, where young people felt they could change the world\n\nthe tragedy of terrorism in the 1970s\n\nthe ups and downs of the economy\n\nthe Falcone assassination in 1992\n\nand diversion of many characters' energies into family life and coming to terms with feelings of alienation and regret.\n\nOf the brothers we meet in 1966, Matteo (Alessio Boni) is the more withdrawn and sullen, a man sensitive to the wrongs of society but one prone to fits of temper and frustration when things don't go his way. Nicola Luigi Lo Cascio) is more open and loving, at ease with women but reserved, engaged with the world and a seeker of love.\n\nAt a job in a mental hospital, Matteo meets Giorgia (Jasmine Trinca), a severely disturbed young woman who is being given electroshock therapy, the barbarity of which outrages him. When he, his brother and two pals take off on a summer trip to Norway, Matteo kidnaps Giorgia with the vague idea of rescuing her and returning her to her family. Only the family doesn't want her, and police pick her up at a train station.\n\nDiscouraged, Matteo abandons Nicola to return to Rome and impulsively joins the army rather than continuing with his studies. Nicola makes his way to Norway, where, out of money, he takes work in a lumber mill. He returns home to help in the flood in Florence, where he meets Giulia (Sonia Bergamasco), a free-spirited woman who becomes his lover and mother of his child, Sara.\n\nPerhaps inspired by his encounter with Giorgia, Nicola pursues a career in psychiatry in Turin. Meanwhile, Matteo's career in the army and police -- jobs he seeks because they have \"rules\" -- is often jeopardized by a rebellious streak and violent behavior.\n\nWhile on duty in Sicily in the late '70s, Matteo meets Mirella (Maya Sansa), a young photographer he will later encounter in Rome. They have a brief affair before tragedy overtakes Matteo. Meanwhile, Giulia becomes increasingly radicalized and deserts Nicola and Sara to enter the shadowy world of terrorism. Eventually, Nicola is faced with the decision of whether to aid police in capturing his ex-lover before she kills someone.\n\nPerhaps the strongest influence here is Francois Truffaut in his early \"Jules et Jim\" period. For Giordana is less interested in social and political history than in how people fall in and out of love, how families operate and the role friendships play in the characters' lives. Giordana moves beyond psychology, viewing characters' behavior without trying to fully understand or explain them.\n\nLo Cascio and Boni inhabit their roles with keen intellectual and emotional vigor. Bergamasco and Sansa deliver sensitive portraits of conflicted women who struggle to bridge the gap between personal desires and responsibilities to others.\n\nProduction designer Franco Ceraolo and cinematographer Roberto Forza, shooting in Super 16mm, ably convey the changing landscape of Italy. The film's soundtrack consists in large measure of terrific pop songs from different eras.\n\nTHE BEST OF YOUTH\n\nMiramax Films\n\nRai Radiotelevisione Italiana presents a Rai Fiction production\n\nCredits:\n\nDirector: Marco Tullio Giordana\n\nScreenwriters: Sandro Petraglia, Stefano Rulli\n\nProducer: Angelo Barbagallo\n\nDirector of photography: Roberto Forza\n\nProduction designer: Franco Ceraolo\n\nCostume designer: Elisabetta Montaldo\n\nEditor: Roberto Missiroli\n\nCast:\n\nNicola: Luigi Lo Cascio\n\nMatteo: Alessio Boni\n\nGiulia: Sonia Bergamasco\n\nCarlo: Fabrizio\n\nMirella: Maya Sansa\n\nFrancesca: Valentina Carnelutti\n\nGiorgia: Jasmine Trinca\n\nAngelo: Andrea Tidona\n\nRunning time -- 373 minutes\n\nNo MPAA rating..."
