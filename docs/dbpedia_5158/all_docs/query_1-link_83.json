        "text": "The first-ever retrospective in the UK of the work of Paolo and Vittorio Taviani will launch at BFI Southbank in February.\n\nEntitled ‘Magical Realism – The Film Fables of the Taviani Brothers’, the season will cover over 50 years of film-making, with surviving brother, 92-year-old Paolo Taviani, joining season curator Adrian Wootton for an In Conversation.\n\nVittorio Taviani died in 2018.\n\nThe season, which has been curated by Adrian Wootton and is presented at BFI Southbank in partnership with Cinecittà, runs from 1 February to 12 March, and includes PADRE PADRONE (Cannes Palme D’Or, 1977), which launched the brothers’ international careers, and their multi-award-winning masterpiece THE NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING STARS. Selected films in the season will also be available to watch UK-wide on BFI Player.\n\nNicola Maccanico, Cinecittà CEO, said: “Paolo and Vittorio Taviani are among the most outstanding Italian film directors, having earned plenty of awards and accolades in Cannes, Berlin, and worldwide. The retrospective organized by an institution as prestigious as the BFI, in collaboration with Cinecittà, is not only an acknowledgment of the Taviani brothers’ work but also a gift for the spectators, who are given the chance to enjoy movies that cover the span of film history, from Neorealism to socially engaged cinema, from realism to fairy tale.”\n\nSays Wootton: “I am honoured and delighted to curate this first ever UK retrospective for the BFI and Cinecittà of The Tavianis. Their work demonstrated remarkable ambition in the subject matter they tackled and the cinematic invention they deployed (including masterful interweaving of multiple narratives). They give us ultra-contemporary satire, powerful allegorical period drama, haunting war stories and playful, wickedly humorous, literary adaptations of (amongst others) Pirandello, Tolstoy and Shakespeare.”\n\nJustin Johnson, BFI Southbank Lead Programmer added: “The BFI are delighted to be working once again with our long-term partners Cinecittà to recognise and offer a platform for the work of the Taviani Brothers, who despite winning numerous prizes at prestigious Film Festivals worldwide, remain unsung heroes outside of Italy – their incredible body of work is waiting to be discovered by our audiences at BFI Southbank and on BFI Player.”\n\nWootton will also host an introductory talk, giving an overview of the Tavianis’ career and amplifying the four themes of the retrospective, illustrated with clips and slides, including excerpts from material rarely seen and not included elsewhere in the programme. Wootton is a long-time programmer of Italian cinema for the BFI, including curating a Marco Bellocchio season at BFI Southbank in 2018, has been an advisor on Italian cinema to the BFI London Film Festival, and works with Cinecittà curating their annual Cinema Made in Italy festival.\n\nOn-sale dates: Tickets for screenings in February are on sale to BFI Patrons and Champions on 2 January, BFI Members on 3 January and to the general public on 5 January. Tickets for screenings in March are on sale to BFI Patrons and Champions on 5 February, BFI Members on 6 February and to the general public on 8 February.\n\nwww.bfi.org.uk/whatson\n\nThe full Taviani Brothers retrospective programme is listed below:\n\nFEBRUARY\n\nThe Politics of Rebellion\n\nA Man for Burning aka This Man is For Burning\n\nUn uomo da bruciare\n\n1962\n\nAlso available on BFI Player\n\nSt. Michael Had a Rooster\n\nSan Michele aveva un gallo\n\n1972\n\nAllonsanfan\n\n1974\n\nAlso available on BFI Player\n\nPadre Padrone\n\n1977\n\nClassic Literature\n\nKaos\n\n1984\n\nElective Affinities\n\nLe affinità elettive\n\n1996\n\nYou Laugh\n\nTu ridi\n\n1998\n\nWondrous Boccaccio\n\nMaraviglioso Boccaccio\n\n2015\n\nCaesar Must Die\n\nCesare deve morire\n\n2012\n\nMARCH\n\nThe Inspiration of Cinema\n\nThe Subversives\n\nI sovversivi\n\n1967\n\nAlso available on BFI Player\n\nThe Meadow\n\nIl prato\n\n1979\n\nGood Morning Babylon\n\nGood morning Babilonia\n\n1987\n\nLeonora Addio\n\n2022\n\nThe Realities of War and Conflict\n\nThe Night of the Shooting Stars\n\nLa notte di San Lorenzo\n\n1982\n\nThe Lark Farm\n\nLa masseria delle allodole\n\n2007\n\nRainbow: A Private Affair\n\nUna questione privata\n\n2017\n\nScreening on BFI Player only"
