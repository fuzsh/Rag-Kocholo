        "text": "AVANT-GARDE NIGHTMARE\n\nSelected Filmworks of Kenji Onishi\n\nWe invite you to the new appointment at Borgo Santa Brigida 5/a in the discovery of the unearthed films of Kenji Onishi, a filmmaker who with his over 200 works has marked and lived the last thirty years of the Japanese underground scene. For the second Italian monographic retrospective dedicated to the director, 9 exclusive works have been selected, most of which have never been screened in public before.\n\nJoin us with a night of shorts by Los Angeles based filmmaker and writer Chris Shields as the last installment of our What's In Pandora's Talk Box? summer series - Dispatches From a Weird World: The Short Videos of Chris Shields!\n\nChris will be in attendance, film lineup TBA!\n\n~60 min runtime\n\nThe Wide Open Experimental Film Festival call for submissions is open for the 2025 season!\n\nWe’re looking for anything that fits the broad, diverse definitions of experimental or avant-garde cinema, from lyrical to collage to structural to expanded cinema. Your film might include visual experimentation, it might be process-oriented, it might provoke visceral reactions. If it’s thought-provoking, mind-boggling, and eye-opening, we’d love to see it.\n\nOPEN CALL - submit your short SILENT films about Water to be screened as part of an exhibition in Cornwall, UK, in October 2024.\n\nMoving Waters (artists moving image on the theme of Water): Exhibition dates: 10/11/12 + 17/18/19 October\n\nDominic Angerame's works search for unfamiliar views of seemingly familiar things: cities, landscapes, faces, and bodies. The filmmaker's desire to make everyday images \"strange\" at the editing table, to learn to see them fresh and to estrange them from our senses, makes his films seem-in all the different social realities they contain-always distanced as well, as if they led to another world beyond the concrete, beyond time and defined space."
