        "text": "Last Updated on January 31, 2019\n\nSince 2008, the Kanopy streaming service has served as the “Netflix of the education sector,” providing DVDs and online videos to over 3,000 universities and colleges around the world. Now even if you aren’t a student you can access their vast online movie library – which is home to hundreds of period dramas – for free.\n\nOlivia Humphrey was working in media rights management, for BBC Worldwide and others, and had an idea for a new movie platform with a catalog of films that would fill in gaps in the curricula at higher education institutions. Kanopy made sense: students could expand their horizons and learn through film, and the teachers would have a new way to communicate in the classroom.\n\nNow CEO Humphrey, who has long been passionate about independent film, has parlayed Kanopy’s success in universities to something to benefit the wider community: public libraries all over the US can offer Kanopy to their members, for free.\n\nIt’s the best streaming service you’ve never heard about, filled with “quality, literate” content. Each month, hundreds of new titles are added to the over 30,000 feature films already available to stream – including those from Paramount, Universal Studios, Music Box Films, and the Criterion Collection. With a focus on “thoughtful entertainment,” you’ll find a collection of arthouse, independent and classical films you can watch on demand on smartphones, tablets, PCs and smart TVs.\n\nThere’s even a Willow and Thatch Top Picks playlist on Kanopy!\n\nKanopy offers some hard-to-find period films and “one of the most unique and compelling collections of film on the planet.” Their films range from documentaries, indie and foreign films, must-see classics and blockbuster movies, and their “sophisticated discovery engine encourages our users to challenge themselves to watch films outside of their comfort area.” With hundreds of content providers, you can discover new on-demand programming from PBS, KINO Lorber, Film Movement and Music Box Films, among others.\n\nIt’s a great model – public libraries only pay for films that are actually watched, and the content owners get paid 50% of the sales, while users get to watch for free. Everyone – from the film distributors, to Kanopy, to the librarians – can track which films are getting the most plays, and that informs the decisions about which films to bring to the platform.\n\nThat means fans of period dramas should have careful read through the list below of period dramas already included on Kanopy, so you don’t miss out on anything… and to make sure that everyone gets the message of how much we appreciate having quality historical, costume, and period drama movies available to us for free.\n\nBelow, Willow and Thatch talks with Kanopy CEO Olivia Humphrey about the streaming service, and what it means for lovers of period dramas with a library card.\n\nThen, keep reading for a list of some of the historical, costume and period dramas that are free to stream on Kanopy.\n\nAt the bottom of the article are some suggested documentaries like Last Days of Anne Boleyn (BBC) and In Search of the Brontes (BBC), so be sure to read all the way through.\n\nSome things to note before you keep reading:\n\nLibrary card holders aged 13 and over can create an account, but by no means are all the offerings appropriate for children.\n\nThe majority of these period dramas are not rated, so unless there is a notation under the film you can assume that no rating has been given.\n\nLook for Willow and Thatch recommended and favorite film notes below, as well as links to trailers where available. Feel free to leave comments here as to which movies you enjoyed.\n\nThere are a lot of foreign films here… if you are unaccustomed to subtitles, you could try the waters with the period romances The Well-Digger’s Daughter and Bride Flight.\n\nMost films have captions, indicated by a “CC” button on the film. The captions can be launched for a video by clicking the captions button that appears on the video player console (at the bottom of the film) once it has started playing. A small subset of films may not yet have the captions published on them yet in which case you can simply place a “captions request” like this.\n\nPlay credits are used to play films on Kanopy and the number of play credits available per month varies by library. Users are provided with a set number of play credits in their account each month and this is refreshed on the first day of each calendar month. For example, anyone with a NYPL card can stream up to ten films each month, and anyone with a Brooklyn Public Library card can stream six videos a month. If you belong to both libraries, you’d get sixteen credits, combined.\n\nTo “spend” one of your play credits, the user must press play on a film and have the film fully load and start playing. Once a play credit is logged, the user then has a full 3 days (72 hours) to watch the film as many times as they like without using another play credit.\n\nYou can watch Kanopy on desktop browsers (Safari, Firefox, Chrome on Mac OS x and Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome on Windows), smartphones, tablets, PCs and smart TVs. Once your profile is set up you can use Kanopy on device apps such as Roku, Apple TV, IOS, Android, via HDMI Cable, and Chromecast, etc. Learn more.\n\nYou can create watchlists of your favorite films, so bookmark this Willow and Thatch page so you can know what to add to it. When you create a profile, Kanopy can tailor the website to be more geared to the films you are interested in based on what you have watched previously.\n\nIf you are delighted to know about all the period dramas on Kanopy, please share this article with your friends so more people can benefit from the new streaming service.\n\nVisit here to see if your local public or college library has Kanopy. If your library isn’t currently participating, you’ll be able to request that they join.\n\nWillow and Thatch in Conversation with Olivia Humphrey\n\nWillow and Thatch: Kanopy offers such a diverse array of quality programming, exactly the type of movies and television series that Willow and Thatch readers are drawn to, like literary adaptations, historical and period costume dramas, and British and Australian series, as well as historical documentaries and biopics. You also offer so many award-winning and International period films which are difficult to find in the US. Can you tell our readers a little about how Kanopy selects the programming?\n\nOlivia Humphrey: We carefully curate our collection so it aligns with our motto of “thoughtful entertainment”. We aim to offer a diverse range of films and series from arthouse films, foreign TV series to indie docs. Many of these films are not readily available to our audience so it’s a great destination for those seeking films that will make you think and aren’t necessarily mainstream. Willow and Thatch viewers will no doubt migrate to our Historical Drama collection which offers a diverse range of period dramas like Georgian, Victorian, and 20th Century.\n\n(Willow and Thatch has curated a period drama playlist for Kanopy that you can see here which is part of the Historical Drama Collection, but keep reading for a fuller list of period dramas on Kanopy.)\n\nWe select films that we think our audience will enjoy. We aim to really encourage our users to be adventurous, to extend their range and try watching films outside of their comfort zone and they are often surprised by discovering a whole new genre of film to enjoy.\n\nWAT: Making the Kanopy database available to members of public libraries not only gives them access to thoughtfully curated content, but addresses one of our readers’ main concerns, which is how their viewing habits fit into their budgets. Can you talk a little about how you decided to make Kanopy open to public libraries, and how many public libraries are currently participating? Are all of them located in the US?\n\nOH: The public libraries have budgets that they use to purchase resources for their members. Traditionally this was physical resources like books, DVDs, magazines but as consumer behavior has migrated online, libraries are responding by making these resources available digitally. Kanopy is an obvious choice for libraries as we focus on thoughtful entertainment – films that make users think, educate or at a minimum, make our viewers feel enriched so they leave Kanopy feeling like it was time well spent.\n\nKanopy has been streaming to higher ed students and professors for over 5 years, and it was always difficult when students graduated and called in to Kanopy, asking how they could access. We had to say “you can’t”. So migrating our millennial audience to watch via their local public library is a natural growth opportunity for us.\n\nWe are very careful about balancing the needs of the library, and the return on investment they expect to receive with the needs of our filmmakers who are trying to generate a sustainable income for their films. The public library market offers a very democratic way to access a special collection like Kanopy while supporting a thriving film industry.\n\nWe are working (or trialing) with nearly all the major public library networks in the US. We work with many Canadian and Australian library networks too.\n\nWAT: The number of films available to stream per user in a month varies a bit, based on one’s public library branch. Is that because larger libraries participate differently in Kanopy? Are you considering a pay-per-view option for individuals who have used up their monthly viewing credits?\n\nOH: Each Public Library sets their play credits cap. Some public libraries have approached cautiously as they understand the demand and response from their members and are gradually increasing the cap as they see their members enjoy the platform. We are exploring a variety of ways users can increase their caps so we’ll have more news on this in the coming months.\n\nWAT: Do all Kanopy public library users have access to the same content? For example, could someone accessing the database via their Brooklyn Public Library membership stream the same exact movies as a NYPL member?\n\nOH: Theoretically yes, unless a library has specifically requested to remove certain genres of film. The difference will be the interface. eg Brooklyn Public Library members will see local films about Brooklyn or by Brooklyn filmmakers and vice versa for other libraries. We try and ensure our platform is relevant to local interests.\n\nWAT: Most streaming services license titles for a period of time, so movies periodically get removed, and new ones are added. Does Kanopy follow the same model?\n\nOH: We very rarely remove any titles as our filmmakers and suppliers tend to be happy with Kanopy and elect to just auto-renew so our collection continues to grow in volume which is one of the advantages of our model. We believe if we look after our filmmakers, they will stay with us forever!\n\nWAT: Kanopy has a wide selection of factual series and programs from PBS that are likely of interest to lovers of the historical period drama genre. The platform is rich with programming like Lincoln@Gettysburg, Liberty! The American Revolution, Shakespeare Uncovered, Secrets of the Dead, The First Silent Night, The Orphan Trains, American Experience – Walt Disney, The Story of the Jews, Ken Burns: The Dust Bowl, A Midwife’s Tale, The Roosevelts, The Polar Explorer and The Manners of Downton Abbey, among others, but doesn’t appear to carry series shown on PBS Masterpiece. Are there any plans to include any of the new, or older, Masterpiece Theatre titles?\n\nOH: Yes, many PBS Masterpiece series are coming soon for the public library market.\n\nWAT: That’s exciting news – Willow and Thatch readers will be sure to be updated! Can you talk about your selection of titles in the BBC drama collection* that are widely available through universities that subscribe to Kanopy? They include mini-series of classic literary adaptations like Bleak House and Jane Eyre, and you even offer The Go-Between which isn’t available elsewhere in the US.\n\nDo you have plans to make the BBC drama collection available to public library users? I’d imagine the appeal would be widespread both because of their quality and because readers are generally interested in watching films of books adapted to the screen, especially when they are produced by the BBC.\n\nOH: We do hope to expand our BBC mini-series collection to public libraries. Streaming to public libraries is a new market for BBC so they are working through this with us. We hope to grow and extend our BBC collection to public libraries in the near future.\n\nWAT: Your website says that additional titles can be requested. Are you taking suggestions only from institutions and libraries, or are you also considering individual requests?\n\nOH: Yes, we love requests which can be sent to support@kanopy.com. We can’t promise success but it’s great to hear feedback and wishlists from our audience.\n\nWAT: In addition to budgetary concerns and frustrations with lack of access to high quality International content, many Willow and Thatch readers have let me know how important closed captioning is to them, so in addition to expressing my personal gratitude for Kanopy, I’d like to thank you on their behalf for creating this amazing resource. What is on the horizon for Kanopy?\n\nOH: Thank you. We are launching on a variety of new devices to ensure Kanopy is available everywhere. More and more libraries are going live in the US and beyond and our content team have some exciting new releases to announce soon!\n\nWAT: In the US. Kanopy is currently working with more than 200 public library systems. What can readers do if their local public library isn’t yet participating in Kanopy?\n\nOH: We encourage your readers to let their local public library know of their interest in Kanopy. We know libraries love hearing from their members and if they know there is a demand for Kanopy, they are more likely to consider us! Alternatively if your members are studying at a college or university, they can access Kanopy through their school library.\n\nVisit here to see if your local public or college library has Kanopy.\n\nTo help keep this site running: Willow and Thatch may receive a commission when you click on any of the links on our site and make a purchase after doing so.\n\nSome of the Period Dramas Streaming on Kanopy\n\nThe Actress – Die Schauspielerin (1988): Maria, a rising theater star in Nazi Germany, is in love with Mark, a Jewish actor.

Soon Laevsky confronts Von Koren, accusing him of meddling in his affairs, but Von Koren maneuvers a criticism Laevsky makes of their mutual friend, Dr. Samoylenko, into a challenge to a duel.

During spring, deep in the heart of Wragby forest, she encounters Parkin, the estate’s gamekeeper. The film is their story.

Through extra footage never seen in the US, director Pascale Ferran’s “rapturous visual tone poem” (New York Times) becomes both a highly erotic immersion into Lady Chatterley and Parkin’s passion and an equally frank and unsentimentally provocative portrayal of a marriage hobbled by war and ultimately torn apart by hypocrisy.\n\nStarring Marina Hands, Jean-Louis Coulloc’h, Hippolyte Girardot.

Among those who did, nobody was as loud and as uncompromising as Segerstedt (Danish star Jesper Christensen), one of the most prominent Swedish journalists of the 20th century. In the eyes of many of his countrymen, his pen was far more dangerous than the Nazi sword. Amidst the political turmoil of the era, Segerstedt’s own personal life took a dramatic and scandalous turn as he entered into a very public affair with Maja Forssman, the Jewish wife of his close friend, the newspaper’s publisher. Maja Forssman is played by Pernilla August, winner of the Cannes Best Actress Award for Bille August’s Best Intentions.\n\nJan Troell is best known to US audiences for his critically acclaimed film Everlasting Moments (also starring Jesper Christensen), as well as The New Land and The Emigrants (1972), starring Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman.

Recommended.\n\nThe Lover / L’Amant (1992): Nominated for Best Cinematography at the Academy Awards and Best Foreign Film at the Cesar Awards THE LOVER is an acclaimed period romantic drama. In 1929 French Indochina, a French teenage girl embarks on a reckless and forbidden romance with a wealthy, older Chinese man, each knowing that knowledge of their affair will bring drastic consequences to each other.\n\n“Tough, clear-eyed & utterly unsentimental. Produced lavishly but with such discipline that the exotic locale never gets in the way of the minutely detailed drama at the center. It is so beautifully controlled that even the love scenes, though steamily photographed, have a kind of innocence about them. Like the girl, the film has a way of standing just a little outside everything it sees, considering, recording the details, reserving judgment.” – Vincent Canby, The New York Times\n\nStarring Frédérique Meininger, Jane March, Tony Ka Fai Leung. Rated R. Note: You’ll either love this or you won’t like it. For mature audiences only, the period drama is based on the memoir of Marguerite Duras. The film shifts the girl’s age from 15 1/2 to 18.

Hortense (Valerie Karsenti), is the manipulative and, in turn, manipulated mistress of the Paradise who runs her business with iron hand; Vera (Anne Charrier), the star of the bordello, is a beautiful courtesan in her thirties whose career is nearing its end; and, Rose (Jemima West), the heroine, is a country ingenue raised by nuns who goes to the Paradise searching for her mother, only to be blackmailed into becoming a prostitute. Unfolding like a serialized 19th century French naturalist novel, this uncompromising series is a mix of style and substance, a richly compelling period drama with unmistakably modern sensibilities.\n\nSet in Paris in 1871, right after the suppression of la Commune, a workers’ revolutionary movement that briefly took power. 2 seasons.\n\nStarring Anne Charrier, Jemima West, Valérie Karsenti.
