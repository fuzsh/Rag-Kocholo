        "text": "A Picture of Me\n\nThis first feature by local filmmaker Jeffrey Goodvin, about a working-class Chicagoan’s troubled marriage to a young woman from Poland, is fitfully engaging, but it’s weighed down by flat dialogue and soap-opera situations, and some of its mismatched sequences look like they were shot over a span of months. Guy Van Swearingen is likable as […]\n\nTroika\n\nIsolated on a boat, a journalist and her interpreter interview a politician in scenes based on a Playboy interview with Russian nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Isolated in an apartment, two women argue about their sexual relationship, one of them attempting to draw a third woman into the fray. These two scenarios, which have actors and even […]\n\nCharly\n\nCliff Robertson won an Oscar in 1968 for re-creating his 1961 TV role as a retarded man turned into a genius through a scientific experiment; Claire Bloom plays a caseworker who gets on his case. Adapted by Sterling Silliphant from Daniel Keyes’s novel Flowers for Algernon, and directed by Ralph Nelson; Ravi Shankar supplies the […]\n\nThe Man by the Shore\n\nRaoul Peck’s semiautobiographical tale of unrest in early 60s Haiti stars Jennifer Zubar, Toto Bissainthe, and Jean-Michel Martial.\n\nThe White Angel\n\nKay Francis plays Florence Nightingale in this 1936 Warners biopic. William Dieterle directed; with Ian Hunter, Donald Woods, Nigel Bruce, and Donald Crisp. 92 min.\n\nThe Pioneers: Alice Guy and Others\n\nA program of Gaumont shorts made between 1905 and 1909, when French films dominated the market even in the U.S. Many are attributed to producer-director-supervisor Alice Guy, probably the first woman to attain a position of power and authority in film production, as well as to Romeo Bosetti and Etienne Arnaud. Movies of this period […]\n\nCircuit Carole\n\nLaurence Cote (Up Down Fragile, Les voleurs) plays the daughter of Bulle Ogier (L’amour fou, Irma Vep); both live in a northern suburb of Paris in this 1995 first feature by Emmanuelle Cuau. I sampled this a couple of years ago and liked what I saw; given the distinction of the two actresses involved, it […]\n\nLong Time Comin’\n\nA Canadian documentary by Dionne Brand about painter Grace Channer and musician Faith Nolans, both African Canadian lesbians and political activists. On the same program, Michelle Mohabeer’s Canadian documentary short, Coconut/Cane and Cutlass.\n\nJazz on a Summer’s Day\n\n1 hour 25 min\n\nAfter Dark, My Sweet\n\nAlthough there are times when one feels that the filmmakers have bitten off a little more than they can chew, this is a bold, watchable adaptation (by director James Foley and coproducer Robert Redlin) of a noirish thriller by Jim Thompson that comes surprisingly close to capturing the grisly, hard-boiled, and unstable world of that […]\n\nSomeone Else’s America\n\nAn immigrant pair in Brooklyn—one from Spain, the other from Montenegro—and their misadventures are the focus of this tragicomic 1995 feature, directed by Goran Paskaljevic from a script by Gordan Mihic. With Tom Conti, Miki Manojlovic, and, most notably, French actress Maria Casares, who plays the hero’s blind mother.\n\nLike Water for Chocolate\n\n1 hour 53 min • 1992\n\nThe Christ of Nanjing\n\nA 1995 Hong Kong feature directed by Tony Au about a teenage farm girl sold to a brothel in Nanjing in 1900 to pay off her family’s debts. With Tony Leung Ka-fai and Yasuko Tomita.\n\nE-[d]entity: More About Games\n\nShort videos about female identity in cyberspace, showing as part of “Version>02,” the Museum of Contemporary Art’s festival of digital culture.\n\nAvenging Force\n\nMichael Dudikoff stars in this violent actioner about an ex-government agent on the trail of some right-wing assassins in New Orleans. With Steve James, William Wallace, and John P. Ryan; the director, an old hand in the martial-arts department, is Sam Firstenberg (American Ninja).\n\nAmerican Dreamer\n\nJoBeth Williams as a housewife who wins a trip to Paris and gets caught up in a spy plot. An exercise in American dreariness that tried to cash in on Romancing the Stone‘s quasi-feminist themes and succeeded only marginally, if at all; it’s another case of life imitating fantasy, or fantasy imitating life—I forget which, […]\n\nTwo Girls and a Guy\n\nWriter-director James Toback must believe his audience is hopelessly prudish if he thinks this pedantic story, which takes place over several hours in a Manhattan loft, is provocative. Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner—whose role is to be less attractive than Graham—each discover that the other thinks she’s the one-and-only love of Robert Downey Jr., […]\n\nImages in Motion\n\nA video presentation of “dance and film creations,” sponsored by the Art Institute and Columbia College. Included on the program: John Sanborn and Mary Perillo’s Untitled (1989), choreographed by Bill T. Jones; Douglas Rosenberg’s Wind (1996), choreographed by Eiko and Koma; Pascal Baes’s Topic II (1990); and Johan Grimonprez’s La force fait l’union fait la […]\n\nZero to Sixty\n\nDarren McGavin stars in a 1978 car-chase comedy about a 16-year-old girl who repossesses cars, directed by the onetime interesting, always neglected Don Weis; with Sylvia Miles, Joan Collins, Denise Nickerson, Lorraine Gary, and the Hudson Brothers.\n\nMifune\n\nA just-married man fucks his wife, who comes dramatically. His father dies. He’s told his wife he has no family, so he leaves Copenhagen without her for his father’s crumbling farmhouse, where his brother, who may not be able to take care of himself, is now all alone. Meanwhile a prostitute who’s being stalked is […]\n\nThe Mass Is Over\n\nWriter-director-actor Nanni Moretti is one of the brightest stars in contemporary Italian comedy, and, in the opinion of many European critics, the most interesting Italian director to have come along in years. This 1985 feature is less formally and thematically audacious than his subsequent Palombella rossa, about the political and ideological soul-searching of an Italian […]\n\nChild’s Play 3\n\nThe inevitable second sequel (1991), with Justin Whalin, Perrey Reeves, and Jeremy Sylvers, directed by Jack Bender from a script by Don Mancini. 90 min.\n\nMessage to Love: The Isle of Wight Festival\n\n2 hours • 1995\n\nScanning the Horizon: Recent Videotapes On the Environment\n\nThis program includes the Chicago premiere of Deepa Dhanraj’s Sud\n\nThe Godfather, Part III\n\nR • 2 hours 42 min • 1990"
