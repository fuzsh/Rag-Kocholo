        "text": "After Mrs. Alice Hauptmann (Zoe Caldwell) held my right hand in her small, scarlet-nailed fingers and looked at me spiritlessly while smiling a perfunctory little smile for what felt like a long time, then said something about how long it had been since I’d visited her at her home—a grand town house on Fifth Avenue, filled with servants, silver picture frames, silk settees, and polished oak bookcases—I realized that I’d felt this kind of fear and repulsion at a theatrical event only three times before. The first time, I was almost a teen-ager, and it happened in a gloomy, run-down Episcopal church in Brooklyn. The congregation had gathered to watch an anti-drug movie, and just as we were about to avert our eyes from yet another sad image of the film’s selfish, destructive junkie shooting up, the actress who had so convincingly portrayed her stepped through a slit in the screen and, smiling, bowed. In that moment, grim, riveting artifice met reality. Years later, I took a white friend to see Christopher McElroen’s unforgettable 2003 production of Jean Genet’s “The Blacks: A Clown Show” (1959), at the Classical Theatre of Harlem. Some of the actors from the entirely black cast dragged white audience members onstage and made them experience firsthand Genet’s metaphor-laden hell about colonialism, racism, and power, by humiliating them. Why did their white skin smell funny? What was up with the texture of their hair? I tried to reassure my companion that McElroen was just making participatory guerrilla theatre, but understanding the aim didn’t decrease my panic. I was afraid that my friend and I would be vilified for being together, or, worse, that I would be called upon to defend him and, by implication, his whiteness. That same year, I saw the Wooster Group’s “Brace Up!,” a reimagining of Chekhov’s “Three Sisters.” Toward the end of the piece, the director, Elizabeth LeCompte, had the actress Anna Köhler (who played the awkward, greedy sister-in-law, Natasha) pull large plastic bags off sculptural elements that represented the gentry’s land and property. Köhler did her work efficiently and brutally: she literally stripped gentility of its protective coating and threw it underfoot. Similarly, Mrs. Hauptmann threw me to the floor with her politesse. Or, rather, tripped me up.\n\nLike the thirty or so other people who attended a recent performance of David Adjmi’s “Elective Affinities” (a site-specific work presented by the SoHo Rep, piece by piece productions, and Rising Phoenix Repertory, and directed by Sarah Benson), I had received an e-mail a few days before the show, reminding me, in elegant cursive script, of my appointment: I was to have tea with Mrs. Hauptmann on such-and-such a date, at such-and-such a time. She was looking forward to it. It was unrealistic, of course, to think that I would be Mrs. Hauptmann’s only guest, but I have to say that I was a bit disappointed when I arrived at the house to find a woman already at the coat check in the marble-floored foyer. Such is the nature of fairy tales: they make us want to live in our imaginations—and how marvellous it had been to dream that a nice old lady wanted to make tea for me and whisper her secrets.\n\nOn the second floor of the town house, people milled about in a high-ceilinged room. The furnishings: gilt chairs and thick carpets. In an adjoining room, overlooking the Park, a man dressed in black was playing a piano. A large sculpture, black and phallic, stood at a slant in the middle of the room. When I asked a woman who appeared to be guarding the piece what it was, she said with a nod, “Art.” Few people approached the sculpture. There was something forbidding about it—and about the room in general, with its disconsolate music. I felt off center: this was and wasn’t a play. I had no seat. I couldn’t disappear into darkness and be “entertained.” I felt on display, somehow, like the sculpture.\n\nThen there was a shout from above, and an admonishment, followed by Mrs. Hauptmann’s butler running down a flight of stairs toward us. The lady of the house would see us now, he announced. We went up slowly. Mrs. Hauptmann was on the landing, in a black top and trousers and a multi-strand pearl necklace. As she greeted us, she looked each person in the eye and commented slyly on a piece of clothing or on someone’s height, making us so self-conscious with her “just kidding” jabs that before we could respond we were already in her sitting room, watching her pour tea. She popped a bonbon into her mouth and stared us down with the aggressiveness of a comedian who makes personal remarks about members of the audience in a tiny basement club. Mrs. Hauptmann’s comments were delivered in dulcet tones, but, still, she was reversing the audience-actor equation. We were there for her amusement or annoyance, and the fear that I felt in her presence wasn’t just a fantasy: she reserved the right to treat me as brutally as she had treated her butler. I was a guest in her home, and if she attacked me for my race, for instance—I was the only black man in the room—I couldn’t, in good conscience, retaliate by striking her. Whom would the cops side with, if it came to that? I was constrained both personally and politically: a black, silent artifact. Mrs. Hauptmann had us all by the throat.\n\nZoe Caldwell was able to control the audience in this way, while building a performance unlike any other, because she is, after all, Zoe Caldwell. In a career that has spanned more than fifty years and included four Tony Awards, the Australian-born actress’s primary distinction has been her grandness: what theatre has ever been big enough to contain her? The enormity of Mrs. Hauptmann’s mansion suited her. But Caldwell didn’t use the space so much as dominate it. (For most of the performance she remained seated.) She didn’t need to illustrate Adjmi’s poetic monologue with much movement; his language was the dance. And she wanted to tell us a story about the “art” downstairs and how it had been acquired:\n\nAnd so [the artist] asked us, “Are you going with something big or something small?” And John said, well maybe small is best. . . . And I said, no—no, it’s got to be big, because the world is big, and I want to see that bigness in the confines of this one room in this one house; I want it confined to one room, the vastness of all the world, every latitude and longitude imaginable, I want it squeezed into one shape, and I want to look at it whenever I want. . . . And the artist, he sort of gulped, he was a little daunted I could tell, but I think it turned out all right. I mean, we’re pleased with it. I mean, it’s this very big, black, hulking . . . mass. It’s a little terrifying. We’re sort of . . . afraid. Of it. And John is very cross with me. “Elective Affinities” belongs to the rarely explored genre of metaphysical theatre: Adjmi has created a character who experiences the world through her relationship to things. As she touches a teacup, or puts a chocolate in her mouth, or talks about a sculpture, the item being handled or described resonates in the spectator’s vision as overwhelmingly as Mrs. Hauptmann does, forcing us to ask ourselves not only where we are but what we are doing here, with this woman who finds difference repulsive even as she invites it into her home—as she did with her German husband.\n\nHe’s very cross with me, as I said—he doesn’t like that thing—that’s what he calls it, “that thing.” Or sometimes “das Ding”—he’s German, so sometimes he says it in German. . . . He’s afraid of it, John is. A few nights ago he said to me, “Alice, it’s growing. I think it’s growing.” I told him he was being silly. He said, “Either it’s growing or I’m shrinking.” . . . Germans are such fraidy cats, they really are. The Germans themselves have a word for this. (Beat) I don’t know what it is, but I’m sure there is one.\n\nThe form of “Elective Affinities” may evoke Wallace Shawn’s work, particularly his 1990 monologue, “The Fever,” but Adjmi’s world view is very different: it’s queer, and he uses his remarkably vibrant female characters to speak out on subjects that gay men generally learn to stay silent about—their own vulnerability, anger, and alienation. (The thirty-eight-year-old playwright’s next show will be his full-length play “Marie Antoinette,” and I can’t wait.) Adjmi’s work draws more on Tennessee Williams, particularly his underrated 1969 piece, “In the Bar of a Tokyo Hotel,” and on Caryl Churchill’s “Top Girls”: it’s theatre about theatre, in which the politics are implicit.\n\nUltimately, Mrs. Hauptmann is a prisoner of her own unvanquished taste. She knows that the sculpture is frightening, but she also knows that it’s art. We come to understand that Mrs. Hauptmann can call it art because it has been commodified, bought—by her. We also see, by the end of the hour-long performance, that all the subjects that come under Mrs. Hauptmann’s purview—art, the torture of innocents—are merely reflections of her own colonizing self. By then, we are reflections, too, and she likes the way we look on her auction block: polite, well dressed, fearful, and eminently exploitable. ♦"
