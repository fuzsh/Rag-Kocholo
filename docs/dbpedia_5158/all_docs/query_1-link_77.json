In fact, my personal theme is also the unification of spirituality and the reality of our being. (Every human being should get to wear comfy shoes, and I pray the same for this film festival!)\n\nAllow me now to cite one of my favorites from Master Basho:\n\nSamurai gathering—their chat has the pungent taste of horseradish\n\nWho Will Guard the Guardman?

While singers rehearse at Prague’s National Theater, maverick filmmaker Vachek invites other “actors”—contemporary Czech figures representative of minority opinions—to speak to the camera, “imprisoned” within the confines of the theater space. Playing with the motifs of theater, subversive battles against establishment, and tragedy, Vachek poses a biting critique of post-1989 Czech society."
