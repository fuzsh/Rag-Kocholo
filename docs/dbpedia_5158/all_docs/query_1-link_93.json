        "text": "Elective Affinities\n\nIt's La belle époque of the future. On the orbit of Earth, hundreds of spaceships hang motionless among the stars. There is nowhere to go, nothing to do - blissful aimlessness. Edward and Charlotte marriage is thrown into chaos when two visitors - Edward's friend Dan and Charlotte's passionate young ward, Ottilie, provoke unexpected attraction and forbidden love. The turbulent emotional ride between the characters is an exploration of passion, morality and the inescapable forces of fate.\n\nHalf Asleep in Frog Pajamas\n\n“Love isn't a path through the woods. Love is the woods. It's the deepest, wildest part of the forest; the grove where the fairies still dance and obscene old vipers snooze in the boughs\".\n\nIt takes a psychic, a born again monkey and a secret straight from Timbuktu for GWEN(29), a female wolf-of-wallstreet, to set on the transformative journey, and discover love.\n\nThe adaptation of the wildly poetic book written by Tom Robbins. His novel, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, was made into a movie in 1993 by Gus Van Sant. In 2000, Robbins was named one of the 100 Best Writers of the 20th Century by Writer's Digest magazine, while the legendary Italian critic Fernanda Pivano called Robbins \"the most dangerous writer in the world\".\n\nMice on Strike\n\nSet in the world of mice that live under Gdańsk Shipyard in the 80ties, this is an adaptation of real life events - the strikes that kickstarted the fall of communism in the soviet block. Maya(12) grows up in dystopian society where the Moon is said to be the Big Cheese in the sky. Mice work day and night to build the machine that will provide long awaited prosperity. Maya and her friends have to find courage to ask questions, uncover the truth and make the mice strike agains the absurd they’ve been trapped in.\n\nMice on Strike is 85min animated feature film, currently in development, supported by EU Program Media and Polish Film Institute"
