        "text": "This essay recovers the role of theories or philosophies of history in International Relations (IR) theory. In the last two decades, IR has made more and better use of history. In so doing, IR scholars have turned – or, more accurately, returned – to theories of history. This theoretical work has been intellectually productive, but to date has gone under-documented and unsystematized. This essay aims to remedy this, casting systematic light on the theoretical turn within the historical turn. Insofar as IR theorists explicitly or implicitly mobilize systematic accounts of history to justify their claims, we argue that philosophy of history is both necessary and desirable for the development of IR theory. In doing so, they necessarily make assumptions about how history works on a large scale. Such assumptions aim to address the ‘problem of history’: the theoretical question of how to make the past systematically intelligible. We find such thought already at work in much, indeed most IR theory. In explicating it, we aim to excavate the range of historical–theoretic possibilities available to the discipline.Footnote 2 We call for an attitude of pluralism toward such approaches.\n\nThe current revival of interest in history is important in part because it reengages the field with a long and deep tradition of historical–theoretic thought. Canonical views of world politics, including realism, liberalism, Marxism, and others, once explicitly addressed the problem of history, articulating or relying upon arguments about history’s underlying intelligibility and often placing those arguments at the centers of their respective claims about politics. Indeed, some canonical IR theorists (Aron Reference Aron1976; Carr Reference Carr2001b) once viewed history itself as an object needing theoretical inquiry. Exceptionally, constructivist and critical approaches have recently revived interest in philosophy of history. But for the last several decades, mainstream North American IR scholars have not always made their assumptions about history explicit, despite relying tacitly on history for their theories. This has led to misrepresentations, poorly framed disagreements, and neglect of a central component of the field’s foundations. These shortcomings can best be addressed by making clear the stakes and range of possibilities for historical theory in IR.\n\nWe aim more specifically to redirect attention toward theory or philosophy of history. Philosophers of history concern themselves not only with technical matters of historiographical method, but also more generally with foundational questions about the long-run form of human history as such, and historians’ basis for claims to knowledge of it. Such basic questions orient more specific methodological questions about the writing of particular histories. Thus, they also underlie IR’s usage of specific written histories and historical events in its theorizing. Like structures, philosophies of history ‘shape and shove’ (Waltz Reference Waltz1997, 915) the theory building process, permitting and constraining views of how history itself works.\n\nWe argue that theories of history are necessary: the past cannot be systematically understood without the observer taking a theoretical stand in general terms on the form of history and our relationship to it. Theories of history are unavoidable. IR theorists necessary hold them, and should therefore make them explicit. We call for greater attention to theories of history, and specifically to their role in shaping IR theory itself. To do so, we develop a typology, emphasizing the plurality of historical–theoretic approaches at work in IR. We find approaches in six ideal-typical categories, which are located on two axes. We show that history can be theorized as linear, nonlinear, or multilinear, and as familiar or unfamiliar. That is, it may have a long-run trajectory, no trajectory, or a multiplicity of them. That trajectory may or may not be familiar, in the sense of knowable, to us as observers.\n\nThese categories make IR theory’s sometimes-opaque historical gambits clearer, laying bare tacit disagreements and commonalities among major IR theories – some of them unexpected. We show, for example, that longstanding and well-known differences between neorealism and neoliberalism are rooted in the first instance not in disagreements about long- vs. short-run priorities, or absolute vs. relative gains, but instead in their respective historical–theoretic commitments. These views of history are not theoretical consequences of realism or liberalism, but instead preconditions for the coherence of those views. Elsewhere, we show some schools of IR-theoretic thought are internally divided: constructivisms and critical theories of various stripes deploy a striking range of historical–theoretic assumptions. Even realism, which may appear the most internally coherent of IR-theoretic traditions, has prominent outliers. Elsewhere, recent efforts to recast the discipline as not just ‘international’ but ‘global’ in disposition (Acharya Reference Acharya2014) have been mirrored by scholars implying global politics entails a plurality of histories. We find these efforts promising, but nonetheless aim to incite greater self-reflection, on behalf of these scholars and others, concerning the field’s many and varied historical–theoretic wagers.\n\nOur paper proceeds in five sections. In the first, we outline the problem of history and why it matters for IR scholarship. In the second, we briefly review core parallel debates in the philosophy of history, showing how they inform understandings of history’s knowability. In a third section, we explain our typology, mapping mainstream IR theories onto it, and illustrating the permitting and constricting effect of historical theory on IR theory itself. Two additional sections explore the six types in detail. A conclusion explores theoretical implications."
