        "text": "American academia and public life lent a support to European scholars, but the intellectual roots of the rediscovered traditions of political philosophy have always been and remained European. This was already the case at the time of the American founding when the American founders resorted to, and implemented the achievements of, early European political thinkers, esp. those of John Locke. But the difference between the European Roman Law tradition and the Anglo-American Common Law tradition has survived until the present day. America preserved its traditional political philosophical character at least up until WWII. But afterwards, through the influence of émigré leftist philosophers and writers, Rousseau and his disciple Marx also landed in the New World. From then on a truly leftist tradition emerged there, always looking over its shoulder towards Germany and France, in search of the latest leftist authors. Foucault’s malign influence is probably the deepest, but there are many others. In addition, during the 20th century America made use of the ideas of the European émigrés for creating a new world order after WWII dominated by the political needs of the growing American empire. America did not urge the rejuvenation of political philosophy, but she could make a good use of it. American sciences integrated European ideas and bent them to fit American constitutionalism, modern democracy, later the end of history and justice as fairness. Political philosophy has been flourishing by dint of idealizing the American way of life, Pax Americana, and limitless scientific and social progress under the unquestionable idea of equality, more often than not at the expense of freedom.\n\nPolitical philosophy has enjoyed approval because its pragmatic use, with a special leftist bias, grew stronger and stronger over the next half of the 20th century, thereby marginalizing traditional political philosophy represented mainly by Leo Strauss and Eric Voegelin. By “traditional” it is meant that political philosophy has never been an aid to any direct political intention or goal. Political philosophy is the most practical branch of philosophy but it is philosophy, and not “philosophizing about politics”. Philosophy is for the ever deepening understanding of political issues, i.e. the highest political concepts and aims of man irrespective of time and place, because philosophy is seeking truth in order to praise and maintain wisdom. On American soil philosophy has developed into an inquiry that should pursue practical goals, and become subordinated to the idea of politics. The dominant American intellectual conviction is that democracy should be preferred to philosophy. Political philosophy must not become an ideology unless it wants to lose its character, which has shaped European culture - a culture which is despised and opposed today by mainstream Western intellectual life, often labeled as “Western liberalism” as if it has any meaning at all.\n\nThe rejuvenation of the European political philosophical tradition, however, was necessitated by the crisis of modernity. By the “crisis of modernity” is meant a few dominant features, e.g. 1. Individuals can make of themselves whatever they wish to be; 2. Truth is the daughter of time, thus whatever is more modern is truer; 3. Everyone can say anything because communication is more important than seeking truth; 4. What is progressive is superior to anything traditional; 5. Democracy is prior to philosophy, i.e. truth (R. Rorty); 6. Faith is personal, whereas what is rational is absolute; 7. If you are confronted with the ills of technological development, more technology is necessary.\n\nThere were two great thinkers of political philosophy of the 20th century, Leo Strauss and Eric Voegelin, who did the most to resuscitate classical political philosophy. In different ways both of them addressed the basic challenges of political thought in the first half of the 20th century. The rise of 20th century political philosophy was prompted by the need for a profound understanding of modern man, modern political developments, regimes, scientific and economic developments. And it was strongly fuelled by the two world wars.\n\nThis need was born out of pessimism rather than progressive optimism, which is more characteristic of the American view. It is telling to compare two works on thinking, one is written by John Dewey and titled “How we think”, and the other written by Martin Heidegger, “What is Called Thinking?” The American philosopher’s book is focused on the pragmatic view of thinking, the other is on the metaphysical aspects and roots of man’s thinking. Another example is how the American intellectual understanding of man distorted the traditional European approach to man. In the old days we, Europeans tended to educate our children by applying moral concepts and forming human character by resorting to moral philosophy. These days, following the American usage, even small children are taken to a psychologist to fix their alleged deviances or mental troubles, because all problems are ultimately the outcomes of wrong personal self-identification. The two diverse approaches clearly indicate why political philosophy should come home to Europe.\n\nThe rebirth of Europe after the collapse of communist regimes cries out for raising the most fundamental issues of ‘how we should live’ in Europe. And this question cannot be answered by ideologies, including the ideology of Americanization. Political philosophy must be restored as philosophy and not as a surrogate of ideological arguments. The renaissance of political philosophy has been up to rediscover political philosophy in opposition to modern theories of the sciences, and in opposition to political and intellectual norms, which are mainly set by American expectations. Without philosophy there is no Europe, without political philosophy there is neither existential safety, nor the hope of the good life in Europe. Europe is reclaiming political philosophy. We must distinguish political philosophy from ideologies, and restore the status of political philosophy in European academia and culture."
