        "text": "Teachers of the Best Books love political texts. Yet, they are generally averse to politics, broadly conceived to include just about any event, politician, or policy recent enough for the students to remember in their lifetimes. Some measure of caution is in order, since a partisan political matter can be a source of division, even in the most amicable classroom. So much depends on how mature the students are. Even with older students, though, a seminar leader should never advocate for a candidate or party. Still, the study of politics is not synonymous with the contentiousness of campaigns and legislative battles; it is a genuine liberal discipline. As such, it offers a set of guiding standards well beyond the avoidance of partisan sparring.\n\nAt the level of philosophy or theory, the language of politics was developed by Plato and Aristotle. From its inception, the central questions proper to political order have been: Who should a polity count as citizenry? Who should rule? What laws (constitutions) are best? What should the economy be? How ought a polity relate to other polities? What roles should be served by society’s major cultural pillars: religion and education, especially? Note the operative terms, should and ought—normative terms, indicative of inherent moral bearings.\n\nOn one level, these are all questions of the practical experiences and limited possibilities that shape any society’s attempt to order itself. At a higher level, these questions direct us to the matter of justice, which is more than a practical matter, since even practical matters and the judgments people make concerning them are ultimately shaped by what transcends them. After all, if humans have a common nature, the purposes that govern a society are not reducible to subjective choice. They necessarily involve cohering our political choices to what is true and lasting about our shared humanity. As Plato’s Athenian says in the Laws, if man is the measure of politics, God is “the measure of all things,” including and especially man (4.716c).\n\nIn that light, politics is not reducible to the struggle for power; nor is political discourse reducible to the justifications of power proffered by the powerful. Politics ultimately finds its true purpose in what transcends it, not in the machinations of partisan struggle. If, as philosophy teaches, each of us has a natural affinity for knowledge and understanding, then one measure of a polity’s order will be how it provides for genuine education, a free press, libraries, and the myriad of sources that cultivate the human intellect. For another example, if, as revelation teaches, each of us is made in the image of God and called to life in him, another measure will be how the body politic provides for the protection of conscience, faith, and charitable services from the impersonal reach of the state.\n\nWe know that, in reality, politics often takes turns that oppose what philosophy and revelation teach. The justification for power secured by thinking that reduces law, morality, and personhood to less than what they are is neither philosophical nor revelatory: It is ideological—at once an exercise in false thought and false religion. Ideology peddles false thought by way of its willful reduction of reality to less than what it is. Ideology foments false religion by replacing God with human will.\n\nA politician, political party, or movement need not bend toward ideology, even though it can claim neither philosophy nor revelation for its platform. Politicians and candidates may not be philosophers or saints, but they need not be sophistic or Promethean either. The Founding Fathers and Abraham Lincoln gave America enduring language by which Americans have found their right direction and a renewed sense of purpose. The Christian Democrats in Germany provided a renewed foundation for political order after World War II, a better one than any political party had up to that point in the twentieth century. The Solidarity movement in Poland and the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia helped restore order to their respective societies, each with an authentic vision of the citizens’ shared dignity, culture, and history.\n\nThese examples remind us that politics, while a science proper to the philosophical mind, is reliant on history as the field of political events. Thucydides wrote in a time of Athenian decline, Plato in its wake. Aristotle surveyed 156 historical constitutions in order to work up his political science. Augustine articulated his political thought in response to Rome’s collapse. Hobbes and Locke wrote under the weight of English revolutions, Madison, Hamilton, and Jay between the American Revolution and the Founding. The political philosopher, we see, always works under history. Political history, we see, repeatedly reveals the crises that challenge humans—philosophers, statesmen, and citizens alike—to see order from disorder and choose according to that clarity of mind.\n\nA rigorous study of classic political texts will train students to understand a society’s fluctuations between political order and disorder. The liberal discipline of politics can, in other words, make sense of human achievement, failing, and renewal, each one worked out within the constraints of the human condition. The contours of a rightly ordered polity are well laid out in Plato’s Republic, for example, but so is tyranny, which he depicts as both a ruling type and a form of spiritual corruption. In Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, the strategic, deliberative, and recollective mind of the good ruler, his friendships, happiness, and habitually good actions are all made discernible to the young student of politics as a standard for the lives of the ruler’s fellow citizens. In Aquinas’ Treatise on Law the same student finds foundational training in jurisprudence, specifically the rightly construed relationship between human, natural, and divine law. It is just that kind of jurisprudence that helps us distinguish between a just law and an unjust one.\n\nThe best study of politics takes a path forged by philosophy and history: the study of the way things are plus the study of what happened. The best works in political philosophy reveal for our students the profound relationship between political society marked by change, as we see in history, and what transcends that society as enduring and true, as we contemplate in philosophy. Once students grasp a writer’s argument, they will need to evaluate it. And how do they do that? As the political philosopher works under history, students of political philosophy test a theory against history. In other words, does the philosophical argument illuminate politics as known to us in history?\n\nToward that convergence of liberal disciplines, it is best to consider events that have distance from current politics. For one thing, partisan matters are then less likely to intrude. For another, it is easier for the students to consider history as the past, to see the past in its pastness, and to distinguish how it is different from the present. That distance makes for better case studies. It best serves the students’ consideration of how what changes in political history is made clear by what does not, as political philosophy attempts to reveal.\n\nLead your students to see that relationship, and the study of politics that might normally be a concern will give way to a noble study of the life we have been given, a life that is both tenuous for its fluctuations and revelatory for its grounding in permanent things.\n\nAndrew J.
