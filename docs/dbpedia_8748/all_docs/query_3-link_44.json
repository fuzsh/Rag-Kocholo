        "text": "\"McAllister has performed a real service in delineating so clearly the civic dimensions of Strauss’s and Voegelin’s thought.\"—Washington Times\n\n\"This is a thoughtful book that not only usefully maps out some of the more obscure and neglected territory in twentieth-century intellectual history, but itself constitutes, to some extent, an inquiry into the problems and pathologies of modernity, and of contemporary American conservatism.\"—Reviews in American History\n\n\"McAllister provides an insightful critique of the ambiguities and tensions that divide the modern American conservative movement into mutually antagonistic camps of cultural traditionalists, economic libertarians, and populists.\"—Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science\n\n\"McAllister traces an American counter-tradition in the work of thinkers for whom modernity was as much tragedy as triumph. An important contribution to our self-understanding as well as to the history of ideas.\"—Jean Bethke Elshtain, author of Democracy on Trial\n\n\"A lively, nuanced, and insightful account of the two contemporary giants of political philosophy. Warmly recommended.\"—Ellis Sandoz, Director, Eric Voegelin Institute for American Renaissance Studies and editor of Eric Voegelin’s Significance for the Modern Mind\n\n\"A beautifully written book that lucidly examines the major works of Strauss and Voegelin for an understanding of the origins and nature of our modern predicament. It is ‘must’ reading for an appreciation of the theoretical foundations of modern American conservative thought which, as McAllister makes clear, owes so much to these two giants.\"—George W. Carey, editor of The Political Science Reviewer\n\n\"This book is fair and thoughtful. There is no ideological distortion in McAllister’s readings; he illuminates rather than obscures.\"—Stanley Rosen, author of The Ancients and the Moderns: Rethinking Modernity"
