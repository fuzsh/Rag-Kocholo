        "text": "The article briefly presents Eric Voegelin, the Austrian-American political philosopher who is not well known in Poland. Voegelin radically questioned the methods and practices used in modern social sciences. The great development of exact sciences in the time of the scientific revolution led to a belief that their methods could be successfully employed social sciences. In due time, this view eliminated other methods and acknowledges experience, inductive reasoning and mathematical logics as the only acceptable methods in scholarly research. Positivism made the methods the only criteria of scholarship. For Voegelin science requires methods that are adequate to the nature of scientific examination. Individual wants to know and acquires knowledge not as an external observer but as a participant, through internal consciousness and meditation. History is a process of “attunement” of human cognition to the existing order of existence. The consciousness of the transcendent source of existence has always been in man and woman. At first cosmological civilization reflects this order. A leap in being towards the source of being takes place in Ancient Israel and finishes in Christianity. This leap makes individuals abandon their myth and begin life in history. Science is to help in the attunement to the order of existence and its transcendent source.\n\nThis article aims to show the anthropological and political relevance of logos or rationality as understood by Eric Voegelin. The paper is divided into two parts, the first elaborates what Voegelin considers to be the discovery of logos by Plato and Aristotle, which represents a historical and at the same time epistemological phenomenon of self-illumination of the human psyche. Through the concept of logos, the human soul is discovered and, with it the political reality can be ordered and organized. The second part of the article focuses on this political dimension of logos or rationality as an element that allows the foundation of political science as it is exposed in Voegelin's The New Science of Politics (1952), and the concept of political representation as a central element of Voegelin's political philosophy is explored.\n\nEvery religion and many philosophies offer a soteriology – its own version of the human predicament and its solution. Instead, Voegelin offers a meta-soteriology allowing various worldviews to be assessed by their openness to truth. At the same time, Voegelin rejects generic (Kantian and Husserlian) philosophies of consciousness on the grounds that all experience is personal. This paper argues that, similarly, soteriology cannot be merely generic, as if there were one human predicament and a single solution for everyone. Each of us has her or her own predicament and calling. Tolstoy’s War and Peace and George Eliot’s Daniel Deronda are illuminating in this regard, as is the author’s own encounter with God and subsequent prayerful reading of the scriptures of the world’s religions. Finally, Socrates behavior in the Euthydemus provides a telling example of existential soteriology.\n\nWhat specific sense does the concept of experience have for historians? What is constructed and what is given in historical experience? Is the very idea of an experience of the historical past meaningless? Whether it bears on the present or the past, all experience seems to be an experience of something (its ‘object’) by someone (its ‘subject). Who is the subject of an historical experience? Is it something strictly individual, or can it also be collective? And correlatively, what could the object of such a historical experience possibly be? Events? Processes? Epochs? Inversely, what is beyond all experience? Structures? Periods? These questions will be dealt within the frame of the theory of history. After having outlined the polysemy of the concept of experience, we will proceed from the most singular forms of experience to examine the different generalizations to which it gave rise: the experience of events by agents and witnesses (from lived history to remembered history), the experience of society by a group formulated in narratives (related history), the experience of historical time, of an epoch, the experience as learning from history (the practical past) and as a special knowledge of the past.\n\nMy title is \"Eric Voegelin at the End of an Era.\" The world we find ourselves in today is a very different one from that in which Voegelin wrote the books and essays by which we remember him. It seems appropriate, therefore, for those of us who wish to carry his enterprise forward to pause now, as this bloodiest of centuries draws toward its close, and reflect on some of the new challenges that face his thought and our own as we make the transition from a former world ideologically polarized by two major power blocs to a new fragmented, decentered, disoriented one, and from a troubled modernity to whatever may be preparing to succeed it. This was a dangerous era, since there must always be danger in the confrontation of two powerful adversaries. But it was also one that enjoyed a certain stability, since it always seemed clear who the opponents were, and since they each imposed a certain measure of order within their own spheres of influence. The era that now seems to be taking shape"
