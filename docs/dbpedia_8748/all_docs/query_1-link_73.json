        "text": "October 9, 2011\n\nVery insightful, without being particularly helpful if one does not hold a belief in a transcendent order of being anchored in God(s)—that is, pretty much the entirety of those who populate the masses that Voegelin would wish to have turn away from their erroneous and destructive path. Difficult because worthy of multiple pauses in order to consider what is being stated, with a considerable amount of the latter delivered through succinct but piercingly discerning and lucid prose.\n\nThis slim book comprises two essays penned by Voegelin in 1959—Science, Politics and Gnosticism and Ersatz Religion: The Gnostic Mass Movements Of Our Time. In a nutshell, the former analyzes a situation in which the author determines that most of our modern mass movements and ideologies—progressivism, (neo-)positivism, communism, fascism, national socialism, psychoanalysis—are gnostic in orientation, derived from select intellectual's speculation that truth cannot be located by the opening of our souls to transcendent being, but rather immanent within ourselves. In other words, God is Dead and Man arisen in His place; in gnostic fashion, the reality of the world is to be rejected and a new reality to be imposed through the gnostic will-to-power of this rookie deity. Voegelin sees a change in the ends of modern gnosticism from that of old—away from the Chiliastic and towards the Parousiastic—the Presence of Being that, though empty, is omnipermeating—away from philosophia, the love of knowledge, to gnosis, absolute knowledge, from the finite to the infinite, from accepting the hand of fate to endeavoring to control its wending; from faith to certainty. In such thought do we once again see minds at war with a world that horrifies them, disgusts them, frustrates them, and their desire to do away with this reality in order to impose a new one which pleases and expurgates and assures. In this will-to-power Voegelin determines a magical, an occult element traceable back to the Jewish lore of the Golem, the attempt of man to kill God by immanentizing his creational purview within the human will, as well as the enduring paradox of these thinker's propensity for the construction of systems based upon rational conclusions drawn about reality that posit a reality reliant upon those very systems newly determined. This modern permutation of doxai-as-episteme is especially perilous because certain prophets of this gnosticism—Voegelin's formidable brows furrow deepest at Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Comte, and Heidegger—forbid us to question their ideological dogma—for to do so would reveal the fact that that which would challenge them has been discarded and/or ignored—which might delude us into thinking we cannot make an individual choice to reject this gnostic falsity and its consequent effect of leading one to live a life in spiritual disorder—i.e. perhaps as an unthinking member of the masses blindly performing morally questionable actions; yes, I'm talking to you Nazi SS rank-and-filer.\n\nThe second essay is a truly thoughtful and enlightening analysis of the rise of these modern gnostic movements, why they have proven such a commonplace throughout history, and how they were seeded and grown from shared common threads within Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and ancient Hellenic philosophy. Voegelin posits that the truth of our reality—that of a transcendent order of being that, besides its being anchored in a Godhead, cannot be ascertained but only intuited and positioned by and within metaphysical, mythological and symbolic structures—has always placed a terrible strain upon our souls and minds; the precariousness and mysteriousness of our existence, the terrible finality of unknown and unknowable death, the thin reed of faith upon which we are required to hang the short and swift years of our drawing of breath place an onerous burden upon each individual, and the allure of a gnosticism that promises deliverance from an uncertain truth by means of a certain untruth has a seemingly enduring appeal. He further contends that the more established and delineated that a religion becomes, the more stress it places upon the faith of its believers—under the piercing light of such a vast amount of detailed thought and reflection the cracks in the edifice become glaringly apparent. Using brief examinations of Thomas Moore's Utopia, Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan and Hegel's Philosophy of History, Voegelin determines that there are six characteristics that reveal the nature of the gnostic attitude as well as three primary symbols that can inevitably be found, though usually in intermingled amounts, within the same. Of the latter, the first is of particular interest, comprising a teleological drive towards ultimate perfection, an axiological goal of achieving a state of highest value, and an admixture of these two. These three constituent elements are to be found in Progressivism, Utopian Idealism, and the mass movements deriving from Comte and Marx respectively. Voegelin poignantly accounts for the seductiveness of such ideologies in the comforting assurances of ending human misery, solidifying the future, and placing a disturbingly ineffable fate squarely within the controlling and shaping hands of familiar mankind that they offer; but, having severed themselves from the ontic reality of transcendent being by their expurgation of that of the latter which casts doubt upon their system's verity, their framework is unstable and prone to violent movement and so will be whatever the society that is contained within their structure.\n\nI can't say that I'm in full agreement with Voegelin about his analysis—and his solutions to such salvational doctrines don't offer much in the way of viable options outside of resist; however, as explanatory systems for how we have arrived at where we are, I believe his insights are valuable and contain a healthy chunk of wisdom. If nothing else, I am now determined to finally crack The Drama of Atheist Humanism and dig deeper and further in Plato's Complete Works , as the Attic genius is the figure from whom Voegelin has drawn the majority of his own personal philosophy.\n\nNovember 17, 2016\n\nDifficult to read, but still accessible. Voegelin tends to define his terms AFTER using them in analysis rather than before, which is confusing at first but actually appears to be a very sound method; sometimes terms are so complex they can only be elucidated through a chapter rather than a definition.\n\nThis little book is more or less about gnosticism in its many forms and the murder of God that arises from such thought. He attacks Marx, Hegel and Nietzsche quite a bit, calling them \"anti-philosophical swindlers\", as their gnosticism necessarily prohibits certain questions in order to maintain an illusory teleology. I wish he talked more about why Christianity is a better alternative and how it succeeds where gnosticism fails, but I guess this is more an evaluation of a heresy than an apologetic.\n\nMostly this is just giving me a bunch of ammo for my upcoming review of Atlas Shrugged. Ayn Rand was a cheap Gnostic \"swindler\" if there ever was one.\n\nFebruary 14, 2020\n\nExcellent little book. Here's a quick summary:\n\nThe basic thesis is that engagement with the transcendent is extremely hard, psychologically, and so people look for what promises certainty (ideology) rather than what asks for faith (religion and scholastic/ancient philosophy). This leads to a decent from \"uncertain truth into certain untruth\", (page 83). Voegelin identifies most modern ideologies as contemporary expressions of basic Gnostic doctrines, noting that they both arise in reaction against Christianity while nonetheless preserving corrupted elements of Christianity. These Gnostic ideologies are fundamentally a rebellion against \"Being\" and the God of Being: they see being as oppressive and they believe self-salvation by man for man is possible through discovering \"special knowledge\" and systematizing it into a plan for reformation. This process is motivated by the libido dominandi (will to power) and requires a psychological reenactment of Nietzsche's \"death of God\", by which one kills God and becomes a \"superman\" capable of restructuring reality as one wants, not as God created it. However, any \"restructuring\" of reality according to the gnostic/ideological system involves ignoring or omitting elements of reality which don't fit into the system.\n\nMarch 8, 2020\n\nThe great thing about reading is that it allows you to really delve into mental models that are completely alien to your own thought.\n\nVoegelin's writing is such a case. He's politically very different from me, he's anti-liberal, very Christian (but that starch conservative Christianity, not that Jesus-hippy kind), big racist (not after 1945 though), very anti-Marx, very anti-modernism.\n\nIt's not easy reading at all - Voegelin's English doesn't come directly to you, it takes a few stops and possibly a holiday to come to you via his native German - but two things make this even harder: He's not a fan of defining terms he throws at you until he's used them about 20 times, and Voegelin has strongly held convictions about this world that he rarely makes explicit to you, you have to guess why he holds a specific position, only rarely does he tell you why he holds these positions (or pretends like these positions are God-given). Let's look at one of these rare cases:\n\n(the context is a discussion of More's Utopia)\n\nThis raises the question of the peculiar psychopathological condition in which a man like More must have found himself when he drew up a model of the perfect society in history, in full consciousness that it could never be realized because of original sin.\n\nSo here Voegelin clearly states that you cannot have an utopia because of mankind's original sin. A few pages later:\n\nIn the three cases of More, Hobbes, and Hegel, we can establish that the thinker suppresses an essential element of reality in order to be able to construct an image of man, or society, or history to suit his desires.\n\nSo to Voegelin original sin isn't something theological, it's a essential element of reality, one which utopias oppress. From there it follows that utopias are impossible, not because of any science, no, because the bible says so. What's in the bible is, to Voegelin, an essential part of reality. There are many arguments throughout this text that make no sense at all to someone who's not particularly religious, but it takes you a while to realise that these arguments make no sense in your own world-view because Voegelin doesn't play with open cards. To Voegelin (and it took me a while to realise!), man finds the world the way it is organised by God, man has no power to change this. From that point on it's easy to dismiss people who want large-scale change, they're all gnostic weakminds who don't see the glory of God's creation, they're gnostics, they (to Voegelin, wrongly) believe change is within reach of mankind's grasp.\n\nWhat's interesting is that Voegelin moves a bit into the direction of Dietrich Bonhoeffer - religion not as a thing that is something nice for the believer a la modern megachurches (think Hillsong etc.), but something that puts a burden onto the believer, who has to be strong enough to carry that burden for God. It's just that Voegelin goes into a completely different direction from Bonhoeffer, who was much more of a humanist!\n\nCoincidentally with its greatness, its weakness became apparent: great masses of Christianized men who were not strong enough for the heroic adventure of faith became susceptible to ideas that could give them a greater degree of certainty about the meaning of their existence than faith. The reality of being as it is known in its truth by Christianity is difficult to bear, and the flight from clearly seen reality to gnostic constructs will probably always be a phenomenon of wide extent in civilizations that Christianity has permeated.\n\nIn other words, you're all weak.\n\nAnd as I said in the beginning, that's something completely alien to the way I see reality, and that's what makes this book so interesting (even though I agree with exactly 0 of it)\n\nDecember 1, 2022\n\nI grund och botten en varningstext mot politisk psykos, genom ett studium av dess vanligaste filosofiska grund: messianistisk gnosticism (vilken Vögelin menar är totaliteten av gnosticism).\n\nArgumentet som Vögelin framställer det vilar på idén om att världen är illa konstruerad, men att den kan åtgärdas genom mänskligt intellekt; samman med insikten om att intellekt är ojämnt fördelat, leder detta till kulten av den stora ledaren. Kännetecknande för att man har med en vögelinisk-gnostisk rörelse att göra, är att vissa frågor inte får ställas, och inte kan ställas inom rörelsens ram. Med en rationellare diskurs finns bevis eller tecken på att det antagna stämmer; inom gnostisk diskurs är ifrågasättandet ett tecken på att du är en svag och dålig människa, och därmed ovärdig svaret.\n\nJag känner igen det Vögelin beskriver, men har inte kunnat artikulera det på egen hand. Det blir särskilt spännande i kritiken av t.ex. Hobbes som en föregångare till (de moderna) Gnostikerna, i och med förnekandet av ett mål med Polis. Vögelin kopplar detta mot förnekandet av allmänmänsklig rationalitet, och här tycker jag att han går för långt. Överlevnad är ett rationellt mål, och det är vad Hobbes tar upp. Vad det däremot inte är, är ett moraliskt mål, men kritiken av moraliska mål, i termer av rationalistiska, reduktionistiska, ideologiska mål, är en del av det som Vögelin kritiserar. I och för sig kopplar Hobbes på en kritik av tankefrihet vilket kunde vara vad Vögelins kritik riktar sig mot.\n\nNu lämnar jag Vögelin för nu, men det är definitivt en intressant tänkare.\n\nRead\n\nMarch 11, 2017\n\nLet's just say that I hope I never have to read anything by Voegelin again.\n\nSeptember 23, 2020\n\nAside from persistently bloated sentences, the first half of Voegelin’s text, posing as critical analysis, is mere apologetics with nothing about science, and vanishingly little about its method or use of that method in his argument. The basis from which he makes his judgement against other views comes with no support or justification. For example, “Man’s fulfillment is brought about by grace in death,” “the world… is created by God,” and Germany’s “higher criticism” of the Gospels “concluded a preoccupation with the history of heresy.”\n\nOh… OK.\n\nAnd the moon, which is really the eye of Horus, goes through phases because Horus does battle in the underworld each time he sets beneath the horizon, swelling his eye shut, then healing open once a month. Claiming makes it so.\n\nBooks like this are “sung to the choir” who don’t need convincing, and garners an enthusiastic one star. But Voegelin rescued some level of interest with the second half of his book. He makes honest admission that faith hangs by a thread as “Man is given nothing tangible.” With the success of Christianity, its weaknesses became apparent as people “became susceptible to ideas that could give them a greater degree of certainty than faith.” And he does a decent job of exposing weaknesses in his target systems of thought offered by Marx, Hobbes, and Hegel. Much of this today we would call aspects of tribalism, academic dishonesty, or postmodernist spin (also called lying), not gnosticism as Voegelin does. Though he can be cut some slack for generalizing the term “gnosticism” to include any social movement or philosophy because the wider set of gnostic texts we have today were only discovered in jars near Nag Hammadi Egypt in 1945 not long before this book was written. Some of them are kooky, some are brilliant. But one take-away is not, per Voegelin, that they denied the world as it is and lied about it to make their vision happen as Marx did, but that the Gnostics urged a change in perspective, not an impossible change in the world. Voegelin had 2nd century bishops Ireneus and Tertullian’s attacks on the Gnostics as heretics instead. That came after the church canon was selected from available writings and the losing texts had to be expunged for political needs, justifying the selections made as the Gospel.\n\nMarch 27, 2019\n\nEric Voegelin’s Science, Politics and Gnosticism was a bit like encountering a memory stick; I haven’t read the theorists he analyzes for many years. Fortunately, he quotes generously to make his points, so I wasn’t reliant on my memory alone. Voegelin would have been a great help to me in my youth. Reading him I had flashes of how ill prepared I was for the many, usually unbidden, encounters I had with ideological system junkies in the 1960’s and ’70’s. Mind benders were everywhere in my undergraduate days at UC Berkeley and I recognized in Voegelin’s descriptions the ardent arguments I used to encounter. So many voices were clamoring as to how one should see the world, life, the very nature of being. The loudest voices had a vision for what needed to be torn down and replaced. The professor of one of my philosophy classes was converting students to socialism. In the off campus lairs recruiters of various stripes were determined to undermine and stop one’s naive questioning. Voegelin highlights this aspect of modern political gnostics, the prohibition of questions which might undermine a philosophy’s credibility. Eric Voegelin’s breadth of knowledge challenges the limits of my education, yet, even from my perch, I found his analysis very helpful. Rational discussions in our heavily ideologized society are certainly not getting any easier.\n\nVoegelin argues that “isms” in general are the children of early heresies of gnosticism and then turns his analysis to the modern movements. He identifies shared assumptions, methodologies and motives in Marxism, Freudianism, existentialism, progressivism, utopianism, revolutionary activism, fascism, communism and national socialism.\n\nPhilosophy is a search for truth and springs from the love of being, but Gnosis, Voegelin argues, lusts for power and the desire for dominion over being, which requires falsifications of reality. The world is perceived as an alien place that must be fixed by man as he plots his own salvation. There is an obsession with destroying the old world, destroying the order of being, to forge passage to progress. Voegelin notes how often obsession with changing the world has had disastrous consequences for mankind.\n\nI know that Eric Voegelin has a reputation for being difficult to read, but I found him very much worth the trouble and I am looking for more. (less)\n\nNovember 19, 2021\n\nAt first it seemed like an interesting read when it first catched my eyes, but after reading it, I am severely dissapointed, as I was expecting something more...\n\nAlthough some of the core characteristics of Gnosticism that Voegelin identified might have been more or less to the point (I admit, he got the general gist or \"ethos\" of it right, but in a very limited sense), I didn't really appreciate his bashing of it. Like how another commenter wrote here, it seemed like the book was written for a choir who didn't need any more convincing of the cons of Gnosticism.\n\nAdditionally, he slapped the term quite indiscriminatorily to the modern schools of thought - it's like calling Christianity Communism, because it preaches the idea of universal community, which, even if we were to agree, could fit only at the most vaguest and generalest of sense, and by brushing off all the nuances, details and relevant interlinkings between other concepts or aspects of these two systems.\n\nSo, at least to my estimation, calling Marx, Hegel, Nietzsche and Heidegger \"Gnostics\" is a gross misinterpretation of both Gnosticism and the aforementioned thinkers' work(s), which I don't think should be viewed as \"immanentizing of the eschaton\". It (and the accusation of his variant of \"Gnosticism\") might apply to some extent to some of the thinkers, but if so, only partly, and only if we forced them to fit these categories.\n\nAnd, at the very least, Voegelin didn't even give any decent argument for the opposite case, namely for why we *shouldn't* either murder God or \"destroy\" reality. Surprisingly, not even once was the Holocaust or similar atrocities as a justification for why we should oppose the \"Gnostic\" world-bettering salvationism present in these \"political religions\" invoked. Not once.\n\nIt might've deserved a 3/5, because there are some interesting takes on Hegel, Marx and Nietzsche, but because the book came off more as an opinion piece, rather than as a rigorously argued to-be-taken-seriously kind of thesis, I gave it a 2.\n\nFebruary 11, 2018\n\nThis is a nice little book. A polemic against what Voegelin calls Gnosticism. Meaning Socialism and Positivism for example. Basically, Gnosticism is the view that man has the power to change the world, to make it a better place. This is the positive view. Of course, that is not how Voegelin presents it. For him Christianity and accepting the world as it is and hoping for a better life after death is positive. Now, this, of course, is also polemical.\n\nVoegelin says: \"Reality must be destroyed - this is the great concern of Gnosticism\" (p. 24)\n\nHe makes quite a nice case, especially in analyzing Hegel and Marx. (He calls Marx an intellectual swindler.) The socialists (and Gnostics) in general \"know that their opinions cannot stand up under critical analysis\" and who \"make the prohibition of the examination of their premises part of their dogma\". This sounds quite right for socialism but I doubt that the Christian view is immune from this. It seems rather odd that pure science is possible only for a Christian.\n\nPolitical science was founded by Plato and Aristotle. The classical foundation of political science is still valid today. It is nothing esoteric: What is happiness, How should a man live in order to be happy? What is virtue? What especially, is the virtue of justice? How large a territory and a population are best for a society? What kind of education is best. etc. -- \"And the philosopher is a man like any other: as far as the order of society is concerned, he has no other questions to ask that those of his fellow citizens. (p. 11)\n\nWhat I did not know. That Comte coined the word \"altruism\" the secular-immanent substitute for 'love'. This, says Voegelin ist associated with Christianity whereas \"altruism is the basis of the conception of a brotherhood of man without a father.\" (p. 58)\n\n\"Order and Progress\" is the motto of Comte.\n\nOctober 11, 2020\n\nThe essence of what I'm picking up is that any political ideology or plan that is not Christian and \"practical\" (ie, accepts large swaths of the status quo) is \"gnostic\", presumably because it does not embrace the world \"as is\" & seeks to reform it in a way that is guided by an invisible (not-yet-present) order. In reading this, I think it made me proud to be a gnostic! The deepest irony is that Voegelin ignores the close ties between Christianity and gnodticism, and hisnbemoaining that positivists, communists etc overturn the transcendent order is -absolutely- a gnostic ontological basis for a transcendent metaphysics. So lol Voegelin, nice try, not compelling at all.\n\nFebruary 10, 2017\n\nRecently re-read and it is still magnificent. Lovely to feel how his work is almost like a surgical operation, and going through it once more you remember how your brain was stretched and re-trained by the first reading.\n\nWhat I took from it this time: our Utopia-builders always leave something out. Thomas More: original sin (though at least he was engaged in entertainment and not serious about enacting it). Thomas Hobbes: summum bonum. Karl Marx: well, a basic acceptance of reality.\n\nVogelein is a champion of reality.\n\nJuly 24, 2012\n\nAs political philosophers go, Voegelin is not an easy read, but worth the effort. In this, he equates ancient Gnosticism with what he regarded as unsound political theories, such as Communism and Fascism. Critics sometimes point out that his Gnostic sources are mostly secondary, since the Nag Hammadi texts were not widely available at the time this was written.\n\nMay 29, 2009\n\nReally insightful, though classic hopeless conservatism. Great analysis without offering solutions. But the analysis was mostly spot on. A little off with his Milleniarialism, but only because he lived before any significant preterism.\n\nRead\n\nJuly 6, 2023\n\nOverall I really think he's on to something. Besides the more obvious traits of gnosticism he lists, there is the general defection from reality that must take this specific shape after Christ. He explains it is because the standard of what can be hoped for is raised in Christian revelation, but also the standard of what we must do for this, and how uncertain we are about achieving it, causes too much tension for most people, who are therefore too weak for this reality. Now his Catholic conception of assurance could be playing a role here. Perhaps we can allow that his own misunderstanding is widespread enough beyond Roman Catholics to be historically explanatory. But in any case since Christ is already revealed in such fullness now, if He is denied, that denial will take a certain unique shape, which it did not take in more simple polytheistic pagan cultures BC.\n\nHe shows the continuity of ancient and Modern gnosticism, not just through the Christian heretics. I think this analysis is particularly striking when he talks about the prohibition of questioning. The part about the golems and the murder of God, this other element of gnosticism, usurpation and taking on of God's role is also striking.\n\nAlthough in the introduction by Ellis Sandoz, Voegelin is quoted in conversation saying there are distinct but neighboring traditions besides gnosticism (as more widely construed here), such as hermeticism, NeoPlatonism, the (Jewish) apocalytpic tradition (where Heidegger comes closest in his later thought), and magic. He may see gnosticism by the time he's quoted here in 1976, as the dominant strand. But he seems to suggest that they can't all be reduced to gnosticism. I would agree gnosticism is the dominant form antiChristianity takes in politics / action. It is a little more helpful to describe it that way, as it's own form of religion, as opposed to taking Modernity for how it describes itself or merely calling it anti-Christian.\n\nSome of my gripes are that he doesn't clearly explain Hegel and his interpretation. He does quote Hegel, but it's unclear how he's making his inferences. And it was fairly clear to me he was misunderstanding Heidegger. He in fact quotes Heidegger where the latter mentions the possibility of Being opening, and then on the same page criticizes Heidegger for thinking of Being as a closed process. But Heidegger wasn't a systematic \"closed\" thinker, at least in his later years. I definitely sympathize with categorizing and explaining Heidegger as some kind of anti-Christian mystic. But he and Voegelin actually have a lot of agreement on a critique of Modernity, together with Ellul. One could see Heidegger as so incredibly anti-Hellenist and quasi-Protestant that he leaves Christianity because he wants to work merely with what would be revealed anew, by the right form of thinking / being of dasein (~of human being). He seems to reject the thesis that we can return to a still preserved true tradition, because the historical age in which (and only in which) they were meaningful has passed irrevocably (the Christian age has passed, to him). This desire to artistically bring about a new age, to escape the current decline and obscuring, as well as seeing a kind of end-of-the-world situation in Modern technological society, is a kind of apocalyptic mysticism in my opinion. Only now from my Orthodox view, do I see the awaiting upon revelation (anew) from Being, as very inclined toward the demonic, not to mention the dismissal of Christianity as a passed epoch (for the West - Idk whether he knew of Eastern Christianity). It's really an attempt to go forward into a postmodern quasi-pagan innocence, by going beyond Modern enframing, and it assumes atheism because he assumes God wouldn't preserve a true and clear tradition regardless of the world age. Instead, our paradigms, like fashions are changed by Being in a mysterious or fickle way.\n\nAlso I don't think everything anti-Christian is, in its own theory, gnostic. I think all non-Christian views share in common their denial of Christ, and so will practically be used like an overall unified network (not logically unified) by Satan in the progression toward AntiChrist, and to some extent they will be theoretically bent and warped to that purpose. I also think it could be an interesting part of apologetics to show how someone's Buddhism or any random non-Christian view in fact accelerates or at least allows (where one should know better) the advent of AntiChrist, and to use terms for that ill consequence that they can understand, not 'AntiChrist.'\n\nAugust 25, 2023\n\nI don't understand how some people have a high regard of Voegelin's work, particularly when you scrutinize the main thesis of this book: that many modern movements, often unrelated and at opposite poles of one another, are gnostic in nature. Clearly he is using the word \"gnostic\" improperly and arbitrarily and its weird application to modern ideologies hasn't amazed only me, but also other scholars and historians of religions who studied gnosticism in depth.\n\nIn the introduction of his book he tries to associate gnosticism with alienation and the transition from the old to the new (the latter is not a trait of gnosticism by the way) and in the second half of the book he claims that it's not important to try to define gnosticism while making the association between it and marxism, fascism, psychoanalysis and so on. Why? Because once you will define it and pay attention to all the details and ideas that were present in gnosticism you will see how little there is in common between it and what Voegelin claims to be gnostic. To his mind Marx was a gnostic, but also Nietzsche. These are obvious absurd claims and a misuse of the word and concept.\n\nSo I really don't recommend this book. It unfortunately doesn't have any real insights into anything, not even when Voegelin moves away from his main thesis and tries to characterize Marxism as this ideology which tries to reduce to silence any opposition.\n\nJanuary 15, 2023\n\nI read the audiobook narrated by Robin Lawson. As I write, this title is no longer available at Audible Audio.\n\nI feel I may not even be qualified to read this rather advanced philosophical work. I say advanced in that it assumes a lot of technical knowledge on behalf of the reader. The blend of analytical views of Christianity, Marx, Positivism, Hegelianism, and the \"God is Dead\" movement as variants of the Gnostic tradition of antiquity may be a \"masterwork of scholarship by Eric Voegelin\" best appreciated by readers with prerequisite expertise.\n\nJanuary 18, 2020\n\nThis book is very short, yet very deep and thought provoking - explaining the process, developments, and faults of gnostic thought in relation to political ideologies and faith. However, this is quite the read and is really only suited for those studying the subject matter already, it is not for casual readers.\n\nJuly 8, 2021\n\nFound this lying around.\n\nApparently he influenced Flannery O’Connor (Wiki). He also taught at an SEC school: LSU.\n\nThis doesn’t pretend to be anything more than an outline connecting “gnosticism” with schools of thought. I would probably need to read more of his writing to appreciate these connections.\n\nJanuary 21, 2022\n\nI'm certainly too under-read and not smart to comprehend most of what Voegelin discusses in this collection of essays, but what I do gather from his examples of Marx, Nietzsche and Hegel makes me agree with them all the more (though I realize that was not at all his intention).\n\nJuly 29, 2018\n\nExcellent, but not for the faint of heart.\n\nJanuary 26, 2020\n\nHighly provocative, one of the most important treatises written by modern political thinkers.\n\nJuly 26, 2016\n\nTen years ago I picked up this teeny book as part of my background reading for my doctoral thesis. It was a stretch to read then, but I sensed Voegelin was on to something. Now, ten years later, in the midst of a hot presidential campaign season, with loads of climactic social changes erupting in the country, and racial tensions flaring, I picked it up again and read it with a better appreciation for what the author was communicating. This 102 page paperback is a densely argued, heady work that revolves around two major essays penned by the author in 1959.\n\n\"Science, Politics, and Gnosticism\" is a work that delves into modern political theory with the author standing in a specific position: one that is open to the divine other while scanning the horizon of modern mass ideological movements. Voegelin is convinced, and seeks to convince the reader, that these modern mass movements are, at the end of the day, Gnostic. The major premise is that these movements are following the trajectory of the lust for power. Since there is a prevailing feeling of alienation from creation because it is a hostile place, and because being is given, therefore these movements seek to take control of being by destroying the givenness of being; “the aim is destruction of the old world and passage to the new” (10). And it is believed that by crafting our brave, new world, the alienation will be, at long last, assuaged.\n\nTo reach for this salvation, reality (givenness of being, etc) must be destroyed: “But reality must be destroyed – this is the great concern of gnosis” (26).This destroying of reality is for the purpose of making space to fabricate a second reality so as to gain control of being, to make “being” whatever humankind wants to define it as and construct it into. For this undertaking, Voegelin has a jarring description: “And taking control of being requires that the transcendent origin of being be obliterated: it requires the decapitation of being – the murder of God” (40). The murdering of God then opens existence up to the gnostic re-creation of the order of being (41). The disposing of the transcendent now makes the order of being only immanent – that which is here-and-now is all there is. It is to shift from the uncertain truth of transcendent being to the constructed certain untruth of immanent being; “The nature of the order of being as it is given, together with man’s place in it, is obliterated: the being of world and ego is restricted to the knowledge of the immediate and existent…” (51).\n\nThe end result of this gnostic trick of destroying the old world to progress into the new-made eon will only result in greater alienation and frustration, for the “attempt at world destruction will not destroy the world, but will only increase the disorder in society” (10). And the murder of God can only bring about the termination of humankind; “The nature of a thing cannot be changed; whoever tries to “alter” its nature destroys the thing. Man cannot transform himself into superman: the attempt to create a superman is an attempt to murder man. Historically, the murder of God is not followed by the superman, but by the murder of man: the deicide of the gnostic theoreticians is followed by the homicide of the revolutionary practitioners” (47-8).\n\nAnd there is the rub, “The nature of a thing cannot be changed; whoever tries to “alter” its nature destroys the thing.” As Divine Wisdom declares, “all who hate me love death” (Proverbs 8.36). In this era of renewed and heightened societal re-scripting of the nature of decency, marriage, the common good, Christianity, justice, and whatever else in the name of progress, is – according to Voegelin – a rejection of the givenness of being, a denial of the nature of our embodied existence, etc. The goal of this rejection and denial is to grasp for the reins and redesign reality for the purpose of concocting our own salvation, a social salvation. But in the end it will only intensify the alienation, and bring death.\n\n\"Science, Politics, and Gnosticism\" is truly a thick read, thick in the sense that there is rich substance between the covers of this short book. It requires a slow reading to fathom what Voegelin is presenting, and the pay-off is that it provides a new way of hearing and discerning the mass movements on the right and the left. I warmly endorse this work!\n\n{Feel free to republish or re-post this review, and please give credit where credit is due. Mike}\n\nJune 4, 2020\n\nThis book is primarily useful as a primer for Voegelin's more dense work. Herein, Voegelin describes in detail how he understands modern gnosticism, and the effects it has on politics. Voegelin's peculiar understanding of certain words like \"pneumopathology\" are clarified here, which makes his other works more accessible. Despite the assiduous attention to detail and argument that Voegelin displays here, his trademark pedantry remains prominent thought the essay.\n\nMarch 25, 2023\n\n\"Science, Politics and Gnosticism\" is a book by the German-American philosopher Eric Voegelin, first published in 1968. In this work, Voegelin offers a critique of modernity and its underlying philosophical assumptions, which he sees as rooted in Gnosticism.\n\nVoegelin defines Gnosticism as a type of religious and philosophical thought that seeks to transcend the material world through secret knowledge or gnosis. He argues that this same tendency is evident in modern political and scientific thought, which seeks to achieve a utopian vision of human progress through the acquisition of specialized knowledge.\n\nVoegelin contends that this Gnostic impulse has led to a reductionist and fragmentary understanding of reality, as well as to the creation of totalitarian political regimes. He argues that a proper understanding of human nature and the limits of knowledge is necessary to prevent these negative outcomes.\n\nIn \"Science, Politics and Gnosticism,\" Voegelin draws on a range of philosophical and historical sources, including the thought of Plato, Aristotle, and Thomas Aquinas, as well as the writings of modern philosophers like Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger. He offers a complex and nuanced analysis of the historical roots of modern thought, and a critique of the underlying assumptions that have led to the problems of modernity.\n\nWhile \"Science, Politics and Gnosticism\" is a challenging and complex work, it remains a significant contribution to modern political and philosophical thought, and has been influential in shaping contemporary debates about the nature of modernity and the role of knowledge in human affairs.\n\nGPT\n\nFebruary 11, 2024\n\nLet me see if I understand Voegelin:\n\n1. Man can never \"know\" the truth as we are all flawed by to Original Sin.\n\n2. The ancient doctrine of Gnosticism is false as it would permit Man to believe that he can understand the truth, or \"Immamentize the Eschaton\" by making heaven here on earth.\n\n3. All mass political movements and \"isms\" are just Gnostic fallacies. This seems rather sweeping!\n\n4. All attempts to make the world a better place are doomed by of the false doctrine of Gnosticism, so we should just accept the world as it is and obey our betters.\n\nProve me wrong."
