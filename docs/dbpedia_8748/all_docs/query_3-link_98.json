A Meditation on Truth«. Voegelin is important for modern philosophy of politics in unique way of redefinition of Aristotelian tradition of thinking about politics. Although the »Meditation about Truth« is speaking about new metaphysical formulation of politic, it is significant position of history as space of developing of relation of human awareness toward transcendence which in end is reflecting in forming a politics as possibility of being. Author begins with term of truth in theories of three philosophers with different approaches to this question: Croatian Julije Makanec, Russian personalist Nikolaj Berdjajev and Neothomist Jacques Maritain. Different from them, Voegelin stars from brunt of state of experience as unique norm which reconciles objectivity of historical fact and integrity of truthiness. Starting from that hypothesis, we can find places of Voegelin’s meetings with history as phenomenon and terminus tehnicus in new science of politics. In third passage author in starting points of Meditations finds the segments of philosophical-historical thinking, first in Voegelin’s critical analysis of historicism. Prevailing the concept of historicism, Voegelin emphasis the role of history in experience of divine reality as attempting of objective description of tension between mythological and Gnostic awareness and her influence on forming of existence of politics.\n\nKeywords\n\nhistory; politics; thruth; experience of divine; reality; Eric Voegelin\n\nHrčak ID:\n\n111394\n\nURI\n\nhttps://hrcak.srce.hr/111394\n\nPublication date:\n\n29.11.2013.\n\nArticle data in other languages: croatian"
