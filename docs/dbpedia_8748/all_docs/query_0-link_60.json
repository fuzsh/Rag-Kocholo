[German language work]\n\nSmall collection of newspaper articles written by and about Eric Voegelin, a pamphlet with a rare essay by Voegelin on “Die Dritte Phase der Industriegesellschaft,” and an interesting article on Voegelin’s attempt to establish a “political science from a Christian point of view” (the essay being “Die Mystifizierung des Politischen Denkens”).\n\nPlease see the pictures of the foregoing items for additional information, and feel free to request additional information and pictures regarding the Eric Voegelin Collection.\n\nCollection of rare books, articles, correspondence, and ephemera, including signed and inscribed works, by and about Eric Voegelin (1901–1985). This collection assembles most of Voegelin’s published books, many in first edition, and many originally published articles. The capstone of the collection is an originally signed manuscript letter that Voegelin composed and sent shortly after his arrival in the United States after fleeing the Gestapo following the Anschluss in 1938. Among the highlights of the collection is a first edition of his first published book, Ueber die form des amerikanischen geistes (1928), later published in English as On the Form of the American Mind, and all five volumes of Voegelin’s Order and History series, as originally published by the Louisiana State University Press from 1956–1987: Israel and Revelation (1956), The World of the Polis (1957), Plato and Aristotle (1957), The Ecumenic Age (1974), and In Search of Order (1987). The collection also includes the complete run of Voegelin’s publications in The Southern Review, including his famous work of literary criticism in “The Turn of the Screw” (Volume VII, Number 1 (January, 1971)), and other rare articles and publications in their original first issues. Most of Voegelin’s early German book publications are collected here, including books published between 1928 and 1938 and his departure for the US to escape Nazi persecution. Voegelin’s groundbreaking The New Science of Politics: An Introductory Essay (1952) is represented in a bright first edition that is increasingly scarce in this condition. Voegelin’s Autobiographical Reflections, published posthumously in 1989, is here represented in fine condition with an inscription by the work’s editor and influential Voegelin scholar Ellis Sandoz. Included in the collection are several works signed by Voegelin, including Die rassenidee in der geistesgeschichte (1933) (Voegelin inscription to front wrapper) and Was ist politische Realität? Sonderdruck aus Politische Vierteljahresschrift (1966) (Voegelin inscription to front wrapper), and an unpublished original manuscript letter addressed and signed by Voegelin in 1938. While notoriously difficult to define, Voegelin’s wide-ranging and influential body of work represented a philosophy of politics, history, and religion that endeavored to grasp and clarify the movement of human consciousness in history and the violence that so often sprang from it, particularly in the ideological movements that characterized much of nineteenth and twentieth-century Europe. Born in Cologne, Germany in 1901, Voegelin spent his early childhood years in Germany before moving with his family to Vienna when he was nine years old. While in Vienna he showed early intellectual promise under the tutelage of legendary Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises and the famous “Mises Circle” of scholars. After graduating with a degree in Political Science from the University of Vienna in 1922, Voegelin would study at Oxford and in the United States, including with pragmatist John Dewey, economist John Commons, and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead. Voegelin returned to Germany following his studies in America and attempted to confront the terrors National Socialism through four publications: Rasse und staat (1933), Die rassenidee in der geistesgeschichte (1933), Der autoritäre staat (1936), and Die politischen religionen (1939). The Nazis confiscated the last of these confrontational works and attempted to arrest Voegelin, but he narrowly escaped to the US after a stay in Switzerland—details that Voegelin recounts in the manuscript letter included in the collection. Although Voegelin would teach at many US universities in the years that followed, Louisiana State University would become his flagship home in America from 1942 through 1958, whereupon Voegelin left Baton Rouge to return to Germany to fill Max Weber’s chair in political science at the University of Munich. In the years that followed, Voegelin published scores of articles and books in the areas of political science, philosophy, history, and religion, but among his pathbreaking works was his The New Science of Politics: An Introductory Essay, published in 1952 as a summation of the six Charles R. Walgreen Foundation lectures he delivered at the University of Chicago in 1951, and which presents a new conception of man, society, and history and their cosmological and anthropological expressions. The New Science of Politics is often viewed as a prolegomenon to the Order and History series that followed. This five-volume series was originally born out of Voegelin’s agreement to write a history of ideas concerning order in the world. However, as his own insights into the order of history developed, Voegelin encountered serious philosophical difficulties in completing the series. Indeed, although the first three books in the series were published in rapid succession in 1956 and 1957, the fourth in the series (The Ecumenic Age) was not published until 1974 and marked a methodological course correction for Voegelin. The series concluded in 1987 with the posthumous publication of the fifth and final work In Search of Order. Throughout these and his other works Voegelin emphasized the importance of transcendence to social and political order and the need for human beings to translate, through symbols, their relation to the ground of Being. When humanity’s connection to the transcendent is denied or deformed the result is the proliferation of gnostic and ideological movements—movements that claim cognitive mastery over reality. Voegelin sought to explore and expose the movement of human consciousness within our shared social and political history so that we may better diagnose the gnosticism that afflicts our modern world. Voegelin’s lifelong project is still being grappled with today; indeed, the scope and depth of his work, and the new direction in which he proposes to turn the penetrating mind, represent a remarkable achievement. This collection of Voegelin works and ephemera is truly unique and includes works that are increasingly scarce."
