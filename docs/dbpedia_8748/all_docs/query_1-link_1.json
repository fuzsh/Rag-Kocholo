        "text": "Eric Voegelin (born Jan. 3, 1901, Cologne—died Jan. 19, 1985, Stanford, Calif., U.S.) was a German-American political scientist and interdisciplinary scholar known for his studies of modern political thought and for his efforts to create a comprehensive philosophy of man, society, and history.\n\nVoegelin earned a Ph.D. from the University of Vienna in 1922, where he taught law from 1929 to 1938. He escaped to Switzerland when the Nazis annexed Austria, and he subsequently went to the United States, where he was naturalized in 1944. He taught at Harvard University, Bennington College in Vermont, the University of Alabama, and Louisiana State University. From 1958 to 1969 he taught political science at the University of Munich, returning to the United States thereafter as a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace in Stanford, Calif.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPhilosophy 101\n\nVoegelin is best known for his work on the philosophy of history. He examined not only political institutions but also language symbols and the nature of civilization in current and ancient texts. His work centred on the interpretation of the governing symbols and myths of political society, the understanding of which he viewed as basic to the success of political theory.\n\nAmong the principal works of Voegelin are Der Autoritäre Staat (1936), The New Science of Politics (1952), Order and History, 4 vol. (1956–74), Science, Politics and Gnosticism (1959), and From Enlightenment to Revolution (1975)."
