Eric Voegelin was a German-born American political philosopher born in 1901 in Cologne, Germany. He received his education in political science and taught in Austria before fleeing the Nazi regime in 1938 and immigrating to the United States. Voegelin spent much of his career examining the roots of political disorder and violence in the 20th century. His magnum opus, Order and History, was a multi-volume work that explored symbols of order across civilizations from ancient Mesopotamia to modern Europe. Voegelin was critical of ideological movements like nationalism and communism that he believed immanentized transcendence by trying to create political systems to bring about divine-like perfection on earth.",
