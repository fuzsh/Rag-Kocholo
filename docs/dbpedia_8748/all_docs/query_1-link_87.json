        "text": "The twentieth century was an era of unprecedented horror.\n\nFrom the Russian Revolution through the two world wars to\n\nthe Chinese “Cultural Revolution” and the Cambodian “killing\n\nfields,” millions upon millions have been oppressed, enslaved, or\n\nslaughtered by revolution, war, and the policy of their own\n\ngovernments. Although one may hope that the worse excesses of\n\nthat age have run their course, the Soviet Union has disintegrated\n\nand Eastern Europe is rising, our time remains characterized by\n\na pervasive apprehension that something is “out of joint.” Freedom,\n\njustice, peace, prosperity, civilization itself seem far from\n\nsecure, even in the Western liberal democracies. The widespread\n\nunease and the unparalleled disorder of our era cry out for\n\nexplanation.\n\nThe philosophy of Eric Voegelin offers insight into the causes\n\nof the twentieth-century nightmare, causes, he suggests, bound\n\nup with the very nature of “modernity” itself. According to\n\nVoegelin, the great modern ideological movements—communism,\n\nfascism, national socialism—are neither random and inexplicable\n\noutbursts nor solely the products of particular material\n\nand historical conditions. They should be understood instead as\n\nthe extreme manifestations of a form of spiritual disorder or\n\npsychic disorientation that springs from certain tensions inherent\n\nin human existence. For Voegelin, the crisis of modernity is in\n\nessence a spiritual crisis rooted in a deformation of the truth of\n\nreality.\n\nThe Balance of Consciousness\n\nAccording to Voegelin, human existence is always and everywhere\n\n“existence-in-tension,” existence in the “in-between” reality that\n\nPlato termed the metaxy and that is constituted by a simultaneous\n\ntension toward both mundane existence and its transcendent\n\ndivine ground. Human consciousness in all times and all places\n\nfinds itself embedded within a mysterious, participatory reality\n\n“halfway between God and man,”1 a reality constituted by a\n\ntension toward the existential poles of immanence and transcendence,\n\nthe poles of mortality and immortality, ignorance and\n\nknowledge, time and timelessness, imperfection and perfection,\n\nmatter and spirit, existence and non-existence, life and death,\n\ntruth and its deformation. Reality is a comprehensive whole that\n\nconsists of both mundane and transcendent dimensions, of mutual\n\nparticipation of the human and the divine.\n\nA “healthy,” “balanced,” or “well-ordered” consciousness is\n\nfor Voegelin one that accepts the “tensional structure of existence”\n\n2 and mediates successfully between its contrary poles.\n\n“Diseased” or “unbalanced” or “disordered” consciousness, on\n\nthe other hand, may be defined as a mode of experience wherein\n\none or the other of the existential poles whose tension constitutes\n\nthe “in-between” reality of human existence has been collapsed; it\n\nis existence within a truncated or deformed reality characterized\n\nby the eclipse of one or the other of its inseparable dimensions.\n\nDisordered consciousness may, then, take one of two main forms,\n\ndepending upon which existential dimension, the immanent or the\n\ntranscendent, recedes from experience. In the case wherein\n\nintense consciousness of transcendent reality serves to eclipse\n\nmundane reality, a condition that Voegelin terms “metastatic\n\nfaith,” the belief in the imminent arrival of divine presence on\n\nearth in such a manner that worldly existence is transfigured\n\nprevails. The second possible response to the tension inherent in\n\nhuman existence and the one more problematic in the modern era\n\nis the eclipse of the transcendent realm by the illegitimate\n\nexpansion of immanent to total reality; such, Voegelin maintains,\n\nis the existential response that underlies both the various ideological\n\nconstructions and other peculiarly “modern” political and\n\nsocial movements.\n\nAccording to Voegelin, the phenomenon of imbalanced consciousness\n\nis intimately bound up with mankind’s spiritual advance\n\nfrom what he terms the “compact” spiritual experience of\n\nthe ancient cosmological empires to the “differentiated” experiences\n\nmanifested in classical philosophy and Christianity. The\n\ninhabitants of the cosmological empires (e.g., Egypt, Persia,\n\nSyria) experienced the Divine Source as an intra-cosmic entity;\n\nthey dwelled within a divinized “world full of gods.” Their world\n\nwas experienced as a microcosm that reflected the divine order of\n\nthe cosmos, an order mediated through the political ruler to the\n\npeople and the realm. For cosmological man then, the divine and\n\nthe immanent were inseparable; he had not yet discovered either\n\nthe soul or the transcendent ground of being, experiences that\n\ncould dissociate the cosmos and the ground of being into radically\n\nimmanent and radically transcendent realms. Although there\n\nundoubtedly existed tension between the “truth of the soul”3 and\n\nthe “truth of society”4 even in the compact societies, such tension\n\ncould not become socially disruptive so long as the cosmological\n\norder was experienced as all-embracing and so long as the\n\nexistential reality of the psyche and the transcendent Divine\n\nSource remained undifferentiated.\n\nThus the problem of unbalanced consciousness, “the problem\n\nof maintaining a balance between openness to transcendent\n\nexperience and sober attentiveness to the necessities of mundane\n\nexistence,”5 is bound up with the “theophanic events” wherein the\n\ntranscendent God revealed himself to man; it first appears on the\n\nhistorical scene with the revelation of the “I Am” to the Hebrews.\n\nIndeed, the prophet Isaiah is for Voegelin the prototypical bearer\n\nof “metastatic faith,” the “faith that the very structure of pragmatic\n\nexistence in society and history is soon to undergo a decisive\n\ntransformation.”6 Isaiah, of course, counseled the king to lay\n\ndown his arms and trust that God would defeat his enemies.\n\nIsaiah’s experience of the transcendent God was so intense as to\n\neclipse the reality of political existence in time; he became\n\nconvinced that divine intervention would transform the very\n\nstructure of mundane reality in such a way as to insure the victory\n\nof the Chosen People over their worldly enemies. The point is that\n\nIsaiah’s experience of participation in divine transcendent reality\n\nwas so strong that he “tried the impossible: to make the ‘leap in\n\nbeing’ a leap out of existence into a divinely transfigured world\n\nbeyond the laws of mundane existence.”7 According to Voegelin,\n\nthis “prophetic conception of a change in the constitution of\n\nbeing,”8 bound up as it with the existential discovery of the “truth\n\nof transfigured reality,”9 lies at the root of the ideological consciousness\n\nwhich he identifies as one of the main sources of\n\ndisorder in the modern era.\n\nThe classical philosophers also struggled with the problem of\n\nexistential balance deriving from the discovery of spiritual order.\n\nThe discoveries they made, of the transcendent nature of the\n\nDivine Source (the Platonic epekeina or beyond) and of the\n\npsyche, the “human spiritual soul” that is the “sensorium of\n\ntranscendence,” were epochal events in mankind’s advancement\n\nfrom spiritual dimness to spiritual clarity. For Plato discovered\n\nthat the openness of the psyche toward divine reality may permit\n\ncertain transcendent experiences that shape the order of soul and\n\nsociety; he discovered the transcendent ground of being which is\n\nthe source of personal, social, and historical order. Plato, however,\n\nunlike Isaiah, managed to maintain the balance of consciousness\n\nin the face of the theophanic event; he did not permit\n\nhis transcendent experiences to disturb his awareness of the\n\nautonomous structure of mundane reality, of the enduring reality\n\nof existence in the cosmos of begetting and perishing. Although he\n\nglimpsed a realm of enduring perfection, he remained lucidly\n\naware of the “improbability”10 of its establishment in time as well\n\nas of the inevitable decline of such a perfect order if it were\n\nsomehow to come into being. Platonic philosophy represents for\n\nVoegelin a model of “noetic control,” of healthy, balanced existence\n\nwithin the enduring tensions of the metaxy.\n\nAlthough the Platonic discovery was an advance from compactness\n\nto differentiation, it was, according to Voegelin, but a\n\nstep on the spiritual path that found its end in the epiphany of\n\nChrist. Christianity, for Voegelin, represents the “maximal differentiation”\n\nof the relation between God and man; the “leap in\n\nbeing” that accompanied the epiphany of Christ fully differentiated\n\nthe radically transcendent nature of the Divine Source and\n\nthe truth of transfigured reality. The effect was not only to\n\nheighten the tension of existence in the metaxy but potentially to\n\n“destabilize” the balance of consciousness. It is perhaps difficult\n\nfor modern man to re-experience the “shock” felt by those who\n\nfirst experienced the revelation of the transcendent God and the\n\nconcomitant “withdrawal of Divinity from the world.” The newly\n\nde-divinized cosmos must have “seemed to be left an empty shell,\n\nvoid of meaning, [indeed,] void of reality.”11 Moreover, and most\n\nimportantly, Christianity permanently “reordered human existence\n\nin society . . . through the experience of man’s destination,\n\nby the grace of the world-transcendent god, towards eternal life\n\nin beatific vision.”12 Such an experience threatened to diminish\n\nthe value of mundane existence (what is the meaning and significance\n\nof that existence in light of man’s ultimate transfiguration\n\nin God out of time?). For various reasons then, the Christian\n\nrevelation would challenge the existential balance of consciousness.\n\nThus it is not surprising that the modern ideological movements,\n\nwhich Voegelin regards as manifestations of existential\n\nimbalance and disorientation, should prove to be intimately\n\nbound up with the Christian experience.\n\nGnosticism and Modernity\n\nFrom the seventh century B.C. onward the ancient Near East was\n\nwracked by a series of military conquests that profoundly disoriented\n\nthe inhabitants of the various cosmological empires. A\n\nwidespread sense of meaningless and psychic disorientation was\n\nengendered by the slaughter, the enslavements, the forced intermingling\n\nof peoples and cultures, phenomena which inevitably\n\nundermined faith in the traditional cosmological order. Various\n\nresponses arose in the attempt to comprehend the meaning of\n\nexistence within such a troubled world, among the more important\n\nof which were stoicism, Christianity, and gnosticism.\n\nTo gnostic man, the world appeared neither as the “wellordered,”\n\nthe cosmos of the Greeks, nor as the Judeo-Christian\n\nworld that God created and “found good.” On the gnostic view, by\n\ncontrast, the world appeared as a “prison from which [man must]\n\nescape, . . . as an alien place into which man has strayed and from\n\nwhich he must find his way back home to the other world of his\n\norigins.”13 The fundamental experience of the ancient gnostics\n\nwas of an alien, disorganized, chaotic, and meaningless world.\n\nThey experienced God as an absolutely transcendent entity utterly\n\ndivorced from mundane existence, the existing world as\n\nfalse, as devoid of reality, as “existent nothingness.” Not surprisingly,\n\nthe central theme of the diverse gnostic thinkers was the\n\n“destruction of [such an abhorrent] old world and the passage to\n\n[a] new.”14 A new world that offers salvation from an old world felt\n\nto be wrong in its very constitution could, they taught, be gained\n\nthrough personal effort and a privileged gnosis of the means of\n\nescape.\n\nAccording to Voegelin, the ancient gnostic speculations engendered\n\nin response to the disorder of the “ecumenic age” are of\n\nsignificance because the experiences and beliefs they symbolize\n\nhave re-emerged in modern times with such force as to have\n\ndecisively shaped the character of that era. The history of\n\n“modernity” is for him the history of a struggle between different\n\nrepresentations of the truth of existence, represented on the one\n\nhand by the truth of the soul and of man’s relationship to God\n\nmanifested in classical philosophy and Christianity, and on the\n\nother by the “new truth” propounded by modern “gnostic”15\n\nthinkers, the truth of the radical immanence of existence and the\n\npromise of a revolutionary transfiguration of man and society in\n\ntime. Philosophy, we have seen, discovered the truth of transcendent\n\ndivinity, a truth decisively differentiated by the epiphany of\n\nChrist. These events an “uncompromising [and] radical dedivinization\n\nof the world”16 and a concomitant dissociation of\n\npreviously unified spiritual and temporal power. Henceforth\n\nman’s transcendent spiritual destiny was to be existentially represented\n\nby the Church, the de-divinized temporal sphere of\n\npolitical power by the Empire, a “double representation of man\n\nin society”17 that endured through the Middle Ages.\n\nVoegelin maintains that this truth of man in society was\n\nchallenged during the late Middle Ages by the rise of various\n\n“gnostic” spiritual movements which would prove to be the\n\nseedbeds of modern ideological consciousness and which ultimately\n\neffected the “re-divinization” of political society in the\n\nname of a new truth of existence. Such movements were an\n\noutgrowth of a “fissure”18 within the early Christian community\n\nthat stemmed from varying interpretations of the Revelation of\n\nSt. John. The Revelation had aroused chialiastic expectations in\n\ncertain early Christians, and they impatiently awaited Christ’s\n\nimminent second coming. Augustine sought to dash such expectations\n\nby re-interpreting John: Christ’s thousand-year reign on\n\nearth, he declared, had already begun with the Incarnation; thus\n\n“there would be no divinization of society beyond the pneumatic\n\npresence of Christ and his Church.”19 According to the Augustinian\n\nphilosophy of history, the period following the epiphany of\n\nChrist was the last of six historical phases, the saeculum senescens,\n\na time of waiting for the end of history to be brought about\n\nthrough eschatological events. Augustine, moreover, had drawn\n\na further distinction between profane and sacred history, which\n\nwas, in turn, embedded in a transcendental history of the civitas\n\ndei. Only transcendental history, including the sacred history of\n\nthe epiphany of Christ and the establishment of the Church, had\n\ndirection toward eschatological fulfillment. Profane history had\n\nno such direction, or indeed, meaning of any sort; it was merely\n\na waiting for the end in a radically “de-divinized” world.\n\nThe End of History\n\nThe twelfth century was a time of civilizational expansion and\n\ngrowth; population was increasing, trade and settlement expanding,\n\nurban culture and intellectual life flourishing. Augustine’s\n\nnotion of a “senile” age was incongruous in the midst of such\n\nexpansive vitality. At this critical juncture, a new construction of\n\nhistory emerged to challenge the Augustinian construction. The\n\nCalabrian monk Joachim of Flora created a speculative history\n\nthat satisfied the desire to endow mundane human existence with\n\na meaning which Christianity, and especially the Augustinian\n\nconception of history, had denied it; and he did so by relocating\n\nthe end of transcendental history, the Christian eschaton, the\n\nultimate transfiguration in God out of time within historical\n\nexistence. Joachim’s project, according to Voegelin, was the “first\n\nWestern attempt at an immanentization of the meaning of history.”\n\n20 What begins with Joachim is a conception of “Western\n\nsociety as a civilizational course that comes into view as a whole\n\nbecause it is moving intelligibly toward an end.”21 Thus begins the\n\nmodern attempt to find a Final End of mundane history that\n\nwould substitute for the end of history in the transcendent\n\nChristian sense.\n\nJoachim modeled his new conception of history on the\n\nTrinity; he divided history into three ages, the Age of the Father,\n\nthe Son, and the Holy Spirit. The Age of the Father spanned the\n\nbeginning of creation to the time of Christ; the Age of the Son\n\nbegan with Christ and ended in Joachim’s time; the Age of the\n\nHoly Spirit was about to dawn (Joachim predicted it would begin\n\nin 1260) and would last indefinitely. According to Voegelin,\n\nJoachim’s construction is of significance because the three-age\n\nsymbolism he created rules not only the modern ideological\n\nconstructions of history, but the “self-interpretation of modern\n\n[Western] society” and thus the structure of its politics to this day.\n\nIn Joachitic history, which let immanent history end with the\n\nend of sacred history, transfiguration in God was “fallacious, but\n\nnot un-Christian.”22 In the several centuries following Joachim’s\n\nconstruction, the new historical expectations he created remained\n\nmore or less within the Christian orbit; it was thought that\n\nan increase of fulfillment in history would come about through a\n\nnew eruption of transcendent spirit. Over time, however, the\n\nprocess of “fallacious immanentization” begun by Joachim became\n\nmore and more radical and the relation to transcendence\n\never more tenuous. By the eighteenth century, the increase of\n\nmeaning in history would be conceived as a radically intramundane\n\nphenomenon; the transcendent pole that sustains the balance of\n\nexistential consciousness collapsed. The result, according to\n\nVoegelin, is the spiritual and temporal disorder and disorientation\n\nof the “modern age.”23\n\nWhat unites the various manifestations of this spiritual disorder—\n\npositivism, progressivism, Marxism, psychoanalysis, liberalism,\n\nfascism, National Socialism—is the radical “will to\n\nimmanentization,” the closure toward the transcendent dimension\n\nof human experience, that underlies their construction.\n\nIndeed, the most extreme modern ideologies go a step further;\n\ntheir proponents not only reject the transcendent ground but seek\n\nto “abolish the constitution of being, with its origin in divine,\n\ntranscendent being, and to replace it with a world-immanent\n\norder of being.” They aim to bring about the transfiguration of\n\nhuman nature through human action in history and to build a\n\nterrestrial paradise endowed with the meaning and salvational\n\nqualities of the Christian eschaton. In short, the ideological\n\nconstructions embody, in Voegelin’s famous terminology, a radical\n\nand “fallacious immanentization of the Christian eschaton.”24\n\nThe Christian conception of man’s ultimate transfiguration in\n\nGod was brought “down to earth,” transformed into the notion of\n\nhuman transfiguration in time, to be accomplished through\n\nstrictly human and immanent action; the transcendent Christian\n\nend of history was transformed into a mundane “End of History”\n\nto be realized in the immanent future. The ideologists carried the\n\nprocess begun by Joachim to its limit; the transcendent dimension\n\nof reality was fully absorbed into mundane existence.\n\nGnostic Experience and Symbolism\n\nAs we have said, Voegelin contends that the modern ideological\n\nconstructions are the productions of “speculative gnostics” who\n\nshare the basic existential motivations and aims of their ancient\n\nforebears. These include:\n\n1. Dissatisfaction with present existence.\n\n2. The belief that this dissatisfaction results from the intrinsically\n\npoor organization of the world. If something is not right, the\n\nreason is to be found in the evil of the world.\n\n3. The belief that salvation from the wickedness of the world is\n\npossible.\n\n4. The belief that the order of being will be changed in an\n\nhistorical solution, that a good world will evolve historically.\n\n5. The belief that a change in the order of being can be realized\n\nthrough human action, that “self-salvation” is possible through\n\nman’s own effort.\n\n6. The construction of a “formula” for self- and world-salvation\n\nbased upon knowledge of how to alter being. The gnostic\n\nthinker typically presents himself as a prophet proclaiming\n\nknowledge about the salvation of mankind.\n\nThe ancient and modern gnostics differ in that the moderns\n\nassume an aggressive, activist stance toward the “evil” of existent\n\nreality, while the ancients were relatively quietistic. Nevertheless,\n\naccording to Voegelin, their experiential motivations as well as\n\ntheir aims are of a piece. All gnostics experience the world “as a\n\nplace of total chaos which would be transformed into a world of\n\nperfected, durable order by divine or human intervention.”25 All\n\ngnostics aim to alter the constitution of being through human\n\neffort in order to escape a world experienced as alien and evil, and\n\nthey aim to do so through applying their special gnosis to that task.\n\nAll of them have falsely extrapolated their experience of the\n\n“beyond” to the “beginning,” claiming knowledge of the nature\n\nand meaning of human existence and of history as a whole that\n\nthey do not and can not actually possess.\n\nThe modern ideological “gnostics” also differ from their\n\nancient counterparts in that the modern “revolt against reality” is\n\ndirected against a world shaped by the Christian differentiation of\n\nspiritual truth; their constructions must be understood in light of\n\nthe Christian background against which they rose in rebellion.\n\nIndeed, the modern ideologies may be said to “derive” from\n\nChristianity in that they represent radically immanentized transformations\n\nof Christian experience and symbolism, a derivation\n\nevinced in their structural congruence with Christian doctrine.\n\nFirst, all the modern ideologists adopted and transformed the\n\nChristian idea of perfection. For the Christian, life on earth is\n\nshaped by the expectation and aim of realizing a “supernatural\n\n[fulfillment] through grace in death.”26 The Christian idea of\n\nsupernatural perfection thus consists of two components: a\n\nteleological movement toward a final axiological goal, the state of\n\nultimate perfection or “highest value.” As we have said, all the\n\nideological movements immanentize the Christian eschaton by\n\naiming to produce a final state of perfection within historical\n\nexistence, a perfect society that is to be created through implementation\n\nof the ideologists’ program or system. The ideological\n\nconstructions differ, however, according to whether they emphasize\n\neither the teleological or axiological element of the Christian\n\nconception from which they derive. Accordingly, the various\n\nimmanentist constructions may be classified into several types:\n\n1. Teleological immanentization. When the teleological component\n\nof the idea of perfection is immanentized, the main\n\nemphasis of the system lies on the forward movement toward the\n\ngoal of perfection in this world. According to Voegelin, the\n\neighteenth century ideal of “progress” is of this type as is liberal\n\nprogressivism in general. The emphasis is on movement; typically\n\nthere is little clarity about the final state to be realized.\n\n2. Axiological immanentization. Here the emphasis is placed on\n\nthe state of perfection in the world. Generally the thinker paints\n\na detailed picture of the proposed perfect society while giving\n\nshort shrift to the means by which it is to be realized. All\n\nformulations of “ideal societies” fall into this category; Thomas\n\nMore’s Utopia is a classic example.\n\n3. Activist mysticism. In this form of immanentization, the\n\nteleological and axiological types are combined. Here the thinker\n\ntypically provides a more or less clear picture of the final state to\n\nbe achieved as well as “knowledge” of the means by which it is\n\nto be brought into existence. Auguste Comte’s final state of\n\nindustrial society under rule of the managers and positivists is\n\none example; Karl Marx’s communist society to be ushered in by\n\nthe proletarian revolution is another.\n\nThe second set of Christian symbols transformed by the\n\nmodern ideological speculators derive from the Joachitic conception\n\nof history we have previously discussed. Joachim created and\n\nbequeathed to modern man a complex of four symbols.27 The first\n\nis that of the “Third Realm,” the third “world-historical phase that\n\nis at the same time the last, the age of fulfillment.” Such symbolism\n\nreappears at a later date as the now familiar distinction between\n\nancient, medieval, and modern historical periods; in the Comtean\n\nperiodization of history into the theological, metaphysical, and\n\npositivist ages of man; in Marx’s division of history into primitive\n\ncommunism, bourgeois class society, and the final realm of the\n\nclassless Communist paradise; in the “Third Reich” symbolism\n\nadopted by the Nazis; and so forth.\n\nThe second symbol derived from the Joachitic trinitarian\n\neschatology was the symbol of the leader, the dux, who “appears\n\nat the beginning of each new era and establishes it through his\n\nappearance.” This symbol reemerges in various guises throughout\n\nthe ensuing centuries: in the belief that St. Francis of Assisi would\n\nusher in the new Age of the Holy Spirit; in the paracletes imbued\n\nwith the spirit of God who led the various sectarian movements of\n\nthe Renaissance and Reformation; in Machiavelli’s Prince; in the\n\ncharismatic leaders of the national-socialist and fascist movements.\n\nThe third symbol created by Joachim and adopted by the\n\nideological thinkers was that of the prophet, the precursor of each\n\nof the three ages. This symbol was transformed over time from the\n\nstill-Christian conception of Joachim’s era into the secular intellectual\n\nwho knows the program for salvation from the evils of the\n\nworld, who can predict the future course of world history, and\n\nwho knows the meaning of that history (Hegel, Marx, Comte).\n\nThe final symbol bequeathed by Joachim to the modern world\n\nwas that of the “community of spiritually autonomous persons.”\n\nJoachim believed that the Age of the Holy Spirit would be one\n\nwherein highly spiritualized individuals would exist in community\n\nwithout the mediation and support of institutions and organizations.\n\nJoachim had the monks in mind. This notion reappears in\n\nlater times as, for instance, the Marxian and anarchist notion of\n\nthe withering away of the state and as the radical-democratic\n\nconception of a society of autonomous men.\n\n“The substance of history,” Voegelin insists, “is to be found on\n\nthe level of experiences, not on the level of ideas.”28 In order to\n\nunderstand the logic of modern political developments and the\n\nrise of the ideological mass movements, then, we must examine\n\nthem in light of the existential consciousness that engendered\n\nthem, trace them to their source in the experiences and motivations\n\nof their founders and followers. More particularly, we must\n\nunderstand them as impelled by an intense “will to\n\nimmanentization” which is in turn related to a desire to assuage\n\nthe tensions of existence in the metaxy by eliminating one of its\n\nsources, man’s experience of the transcendent.\n\nWe recall that for Voegelin human existence is existence-intension\n\nwithin the participatory reality constituted by simultaneous\n\ntension toward both mundane existence and its transcendent\n\ndivine ground. By definition, a healthy or well-ordered\n\nconsciousness is one that successfully mediates between the\n\nexistential poles of immanence and transcendence; a disordered\n\nconsciousness does not so succeed. Because all ideological consciousness\n\nentails a rejection of the transcendent dimension of\n\nreality, a closure toward the divine ground, it may be regarded as\n\na form of imbalanced or disordered consciousness in the\n\nVoegelinian sense. What accounts for this disturbed relation to\n\nreality? Although there is no one “cause,” the following elements\n\nenter into Voegelin’s analysis of the existential roots of\n\n“pneumopathological,” or spiritually disordered, consciousness.\n\nIn all cases of ideological consciousness, the will to power of\n\nthe thinker “has triumphed over the humility of subordination to\n\nthe constitution of being.” We recall that the principal aim of the\n\nideological thinkers is to “destroy the order of being, which is\n\nexperienced as defective and unjust and through man’s creative\n\npower to replace it with a perfect and just order.” In order to\n\ndestroy such a “defective” order, it must be conceived as susceptible\n\nof human intervention; it can not be the created order of the\n\nChristian God which is, of course, impervious to human manipulation.\n\nBecause the order of being must be conceived as under\n\nman’s control, then, its “givenness . . . must be obliterated.”29 This\n\nrequires the “retroactive” destruction of the God whose existence\n\nwould prevent man from fashioning the order of being to his\n\nliking.\n\nConsequently, the first and most important task of the\n\nideological thinker is, as Nietzsche succinctly put it, to “murder\n\nGod.” What underlies the “will to immanentization” and the\n\npassion to abolish transcendent reality is an unbounded desire for\n\npower over being, the pneumapathological wish and need to be\n\nGod. According to the “logic” of the disordered soul, such a wish\n\ncan be realized by destroying God, for, magically, he “who\n\nmurders god will himself become god.” Thus, the “murder of God\n\nis of the very essence of the gnostic recreation of the order of\n\nbeing.”30 What, one may ask, engenders such a seemingly insane\n\naspiration? “Beyond the psychology of the will to power we are\n\nconfronted with the inscrutable fact that grace is granted or\n\ndenied.”31 On Voegelin’s view, our search for an ultimate explanation\n\nfor the emergence of so many would-be modern gods\n\nfounders on the ultimate mystery of man’s relation to God.\n\nExistential Resistance\n\nVoegelin wishes to emphasize that the ideological thinkers do not\n\ndeny the truth of reality (they may in fact be spiritually sensitive\n\npersons with an acute sense of transcendence), they resist it. The\n\ngnostic resisters who created the ideological systems, like the\n\nphilosophers and prophets who created the philosophical and\n\nChristian symbolism, experience a reality that has eschatological\n\ndirection, that is moving beyond its present structure. Moreover,\n\nthey know reality moves not only into an historical future but\n\ntoward a transcendent Beyond; notions such as “transcendence\n\ninto the future” clearly point to the distinction they intend to\n\nobscure (an existence that “comes to an end in time without coming\n\nto [a] final End out-of-time”32). Why do the resisters resist a truth\n\nwhich with they do not disagree? And what are the experiential\n\nsources that have made such resistance a recurring force in history?\n\nThe existential resisters are dissatisfied with the lack of order\n\nthey experience in personal and social existence. Such dissatisfaction\n\nis itself understandable, for human existence is afflicted with\n\nmany miseries—hunger, hard work, disease, early death, injustice—\n\nand painfully disoriented by rapid change (such as that\n\nengendered by the modern scientific and industrial revolutions).\n\nIdeological resisters, like many others, suffer from present disorder,\n\nbut, more importantly, they suffer from the discrepancy\n\nbetween that disorder and the higher, truer order which they also\n\napprehend yet which seems to lie beyond the possibility of\n\nrealization. They are “disappointed with the slowness of the\n\n[transfiguring] movement in reality toward the order they experience\n\nas the true order demanded by the Beyond”; they are morally\n\noutraged by the misery entailed by this “slowness.” Such experiences\n\ncan lead to the conviction that something is “fundamentally\n\nwrong with reality itself.” At such a point, the resister to disorder\n\nbecomes a revolutionary who seeks to overturn the very structure\n\nof reality itself. The tension of existence in the metaxy dissolves;\n\nthe “Beyond is no longer experienced as an effective ordering\n\nforce.”33 The ideologist constructs a system that will replace the\n\ndefective force.\n\nThere is, however, an even deeper stratum of resistance, one\n\noriginating from the structure of consciousness itself and especially from its imaginative capacity. Imagination for Voegelin is\n\nthe capacity that permits man to symbolize, to articulate and\n\nexpress, his participatory experience within the “metaxy of divinehuman\n\nmovements and countermovements,” the capacity that\n\nmakes him a “creative partner in the movement of reality toward\n\nits truth.”34 This creative imaginative force can go awry, however,\n\nif the creative partner forgets he is a partner and begins to regard\n\nhimself as “the sole creator of truth.” It is such an “imaginative\n\nexpansion of participatory into sole power”35 that underlies the\n\nideologist’s illusory belief that he can create a new reality through\n\ncreating a new image. Because of his imaginative capacity, man\n\ncan confuse his image of reality with reality itself.36\n\nIdeology and the Drive for Certainty\n\nWe have seen that the ideological thinker aims to abolish existential\n\nreality and the constitution of being in order to deliver man\n\nfrom various perceived evils. But the control of being does not of\n\ncourse actually lie within his grasp; reality is not susceptible of\n\nhuman manipulation. Accordingly, “nonrecognition of reality is\n\nthe first principle”37 of the ideological constructions. In order to\n\nmake his pathological constructions seem plausible, the thinker\n\nmust imaginatively construct what Voegelin, following Robert\n\nMusil, calls a “Second Reality,” a transfigured “dream world” that\n\nreplaces the First Reality he finds so unsatisfactory. The various\n\nSecond Realities38 resemble the First Reality in many respects\n\n(otherwise they would be too patently absurd), yet the ideological\n\nconstructor necessarily eliminates certain inconvenient features\n\nof reality from his model. The ideologists vary in regard to which\n\nelement of reality they omit; it may be the primary experience of\n\nthe cosmos (the begetting and perishing of all existent forms), as\n\nin all constructions which anticipate the “End of History”; the\n\nneed for institutional constraints and incentives as in Marx; the\n\nsummum bonum as in Hobbes; the human penchant for possession,\n\nas in More’s Utopia, and so on. The point is that every\n\nideological thinker constructs an imaginary reality that eliminates\n\nessential elements of reality as we know it.\n\nAs we said, the construction of ideological systems or programs\n\ndoes not of course permit actual control over being or\n\nreality. According to Voegelin, what the ideological constructors\n\ngain is the “fantasy satisfaction” of certain psychic needs, more\n\nparticularly, of the need for “a stronger certainty about the\n\nmeaning of human existence.”39 Ideologues and their followers\n\nare comforted by the sense of increased certainty that accompanies\n\ntheir new-found knowledge, and the pretense of knowing the\n\nfuture course of events provides a firmer, if illusory, basis for\n\naction. For Voegelin, then, it is the inherent uncertainty of human\n\nexistence, the tension of existing in a world whose only assurance\n\nof meaning and purpose is to be found through faith-engendered\n\nexperiences, that impels the ideological thinkers into their Second\n\nRealities and to the construction of philosophies of history that\n\nenvision an everlasting realm of bliss in time.\n\nAs we suggested earlier, Voegelin maintains that the heightened\n\nspiritual tension engendered by the Christian differentiation\n\nis bound up with the rise of the modern ideological movements.\n\nChristianity, in further differentiating the truth of the soul and\n\nclarifying man’s relation to a radically transcendent God, exacerbated\n\nthe existential uncertainty the ideological constructions\n\nserve to assuage.\n\nThe Christian faith, as Voegelin understands it, requires great\n\nspiritual strength; it provides no assurance of the meaning or\n\nvalue of personal existence other than that gained by faith itself.\n\nIt does not generate certain knowledge of the nature of being, of\n\nGod, or of the meaning of mundane events; it reveals, on the\n\ncontrary, the hard truth that the “order of reality is essentially\n\nmysterious.”40 A faith whose very “essence is uncertainty,”41\n\nVoegelin suggests, may generate an intolerable anxiety among\n\nthose who long for greater assurance. The fact that the Christian\n\ndifferentiation of the truth of the soul is “more accurate” may\n\nprovide scant consolation to those who crave a more certain\n\nguarantee of meaning and purpose.\n\nVoegelin contends that Christianity’s widespread social success\n\nbrought many people into the Christian orbit who did not\n\nhave the spiritual stamina to endure the strains of existence\n\ndemanded by Christian faith at the same time further differentiation\n\nrevealed the uncertainty that is its essence. The result was\n\nthat “great masses of Christianized men who were not strong\n\nenough for the heroic adventure of faith became susceptible to\n\nideas that could give them a greater degree of certainty about the\n\nmeaning of their existence than Christian faith.” Because the\n\nreality of being as it is known by Christianity is difficult to bear,\n\nhe maintains, many persons took flight into alternative spiritual\n\nconstructs that permitted a seemingly “firmer grip on God”42 than\n\nthat afforded by Christian faith alone.\n\nThis was not, Voegelin tells us, an entirely novel historical\n\nphenomenon, but one that appeared wherever the truth of the\n\ntranscendent God had been differentiated; the “temptation to fall\n\nfrom spiritual height that brings uncertainty into final clarity\n\ndown to a more solid certainty of world-immanent, sensible,\n\nfulfillment seems to be a general human problem.”43 The Israelitic\n\ndifferentiation of the transcendent God had engendered a similar\n\nresponse; those who could not endure the demands placed upon\n\nthe Chosen People fell back upon the still culturally viable\n\npolytheism of the surrounding society. In the late Middle Ages,\n\nthe socially available spiritual alternative to a difficult Christianity\n\nwas the “living culture” of the various underground gnostic\n\nmovements, which provided “experiential alternatives sufficiently\n\nclose to the experience of faith but far enough from it to remedy\n\nthe uncertainty of strict faith.”44\n\nMore particularly, the “experiential alternatives” offered by\n\nthe gnostic spiritual movements (the cradle of the modern ideological\n\nmovements) consisted of various attempts to “expand the\n\nsoul to the point where god is drawn into the existence of man,”45\n\nof attempts to “divinize [the person who undergoes the experience]\n\nby substituting more massive modes of participation in\n\ndivinity for faith in the Christian sense.”46 Such experiences are of\n\nthree kinds: intellectual, emotional, and volitional. The intellectual\n\nvariant typically takes the form of a “speculative penetration”\n\nof the mystery of creation and existence; the Hegelian system is\n\na good example. The emotional variant assumes the form of an\n\n“indwelling of divine substance in the human soul,” as in the\n\nexperiences of the paracletic sectarian leaders. The third type, the\n\nvolitional, manifests itself as an “activist redemption of man and\n\nsociety,” best illustrated by Comte and Marx. According to\n\nVoegelin, it is this existential self-divinization that constitutes the\n\n“active core” of the immanentist eschatology that has impelled the\n\nmodern re-divinization of society “from medieval immanentism\n\nthrough humanism, enlightenment, progressivism, liberalism,\n\npositivism, and Marxism.”47\n\nMarx provides a clear example of the existential dynamics\n\ninvolved in the process of self-divinization/secularization. Marx,\n\nfollowing Feuerbach, insisted that God was a “projection” of\n\nman’s highest and best qualities into some illusory beyond. Thus\n\nman’s task is to draw his projection of God back into himself; in\n\nso doing, man becomes conscious that he himself is god; he is\n\ntransfigured into “superman.” According to Voegelin, however,\n\nthis Marxian transfiguration represents the extreme form of a\n\n“less radical medieval experience, which drew the spirit of God\n\ninto man, while leaving God himself in his transcendence”; the\n\nmodern “superman” of Comte, Marx, and Nietzsche is the end of\n\nthe road to radical secularization marked by such figures as the\n\nparacletic sectarian leader, the “godded man” of the English\n\nReformation mystics,”48 and so on. “Modern secularism should\n\nbe understood as the radicalization of . . . earlier forms of\n\n[medieval and] paracletic immanentism, because the experiential\n\ndivinization of man is more radical in the secularist case.”49 All of\n\nthis highlights the historical continuity between earlier and later\n\ngnostic movements and the experiential dynamics involved in the\n\ngrowth of the gnostic consciousness that has gradually transformed\n\nman’s self-understanding over the course of centuries.\n\nWe have seen that the ideologists’ aim is to abolish the\n\ntensions of historical existence by freezing history into an everlasting\n\nfinal realm on earth. To eliminate such tensions, they must\n\nabolish one of its sources, the truth of the open soul in tension\n\ntoward the divine, as well as its symbolic manifestations, philosophy and Christianity. Thus the marked hostility to both philosophy\n\nand Christianity that characterizes the peculiarly “modern”\n\nstrains of Western civilization. On Voegelin’s view, however,\n\nChristianity is not blameless in this regard, for over time it came\n\nto embrace an excessive doctrinization and dogmatism which\n\nserved to eclipse the experiential foundation of Christian truth.\n\nThe ossification of that truth in formalistic and literalistic theological\n\nand metaphysical doctrine caused the Christian symbols\n\nto become opaque; the existential truth they were meant to\n\nexpress became increasingly obscure. It was this erosion of the\n\nexistential meaning behind the Christian symbols which “permitted\n\ngnostic symbols of reality to take over the representational\n\nfunction among the nation states of the Western world.”50\n\nIndeed, the rise of gnostic consciousness led to a gradual\n\ntransformation of the meaning of the main symbols by which\n\nWestern civilization had ordered itself for a millennium. “Man”\n\nbecame merely a world-immanent being who governs the universe\n\nthrough intellect and will, through science and pragmatic action.\n\nThe highest-order goods in the Western tradition, the life of\n\ncontemplative reason expressed in philosophy and the life of the\n\nspirit symbolized by the Church, were attacked as “false and\n\nanachronistic.” Under the influence of the scientistic and positivistic\n\n“science” that stems from gnostic consciousness, the “real”\n\nwas contracted to only that which is immanent and “objective”;\n\nman’s spiritual needs were no longer regarded as grounded in the\n\ntruth of being. The resulting experiential impoverishment partially\n\naccounts for the mass appeal of the modern “political religions.”\n\nMen can allow the world to so expand that the world and the God\n\nbehind it disappear. But they cannot thereby solve the problem\n\nof their existence, for it endures in every soul. Thus when the\n\nGod behind the world is unseen, the contents of the world\n\nemerge as new gods.51\n\nThe most devastating result of the gnostic victory, however,\n\nwas the “radical expurgation of a whole range of experiences\n\npreviously open to man,” the symbolic experiences of transcendence\n\nthrough which man gains his sense of order, meaning, and\n\nimmortality. Indeed, the loss of such experiences was both cause\n\nand effect of the rise of revolutionary gnostic consciousness. As\n\nwe have said, the ossification of existential truth into dogma\n\nserved to eclipse the living truth such dogma was meant to\n\nprotect; it created an existential void to be filled by the gnostic\n\npromise. The radical immanentization that ensued served further\n\nto suppress those intimations of order and meaning rooted in\n\nparticipation in the divine ground; indeed, it created a closed\n\nworld deprived of any relation to transcendent being. The resulting\n\nsense of confinement fanned the flames of revolt against the\n\nlimits of such an existence; it fueled the various revolutionary\n\nattempts to realize the “impossible goal of intramundane perfection.”\n\n52 The nightmare of our century was created by disoriented\n\nsouls railing against the confines of a closed reality.\n\nAs we observed at the outset, the twentieth century has been\n\nan era of “unprecedented destructiveness” and remains pervaded\n\nby a diffuse sense of unease, dissatisfaction, and even alienation.\n\nAt the same time, however, it has witnessed significant achievement:\n\nthe growth in population accompanied by advances in\n\nmaterial well-being, longevity, and literacy, much of which is\n\nmade possible by the remarkable development of science and\n\ntechnology. Our time represents the curious phenomenon of a\n\ncivilization that is “declining” and “advancing” at the same time.\n\nVoegelin’s analysis of modernity suggests that the simultaneous\n\nmaterial growth and spiritual decline of Western civilization\n\nis related to the process of radical immanentization or\n\n“secularization” we have discussed. “Gnostic speculation overcame\n\nthe uncertainty of faith by receding from transcendence\n\nand endowing man and his intramundane range of action with the\n\nmeaning of eschatological fulfillment; . . . as this immanentization\n\nprogressed experientially, civilizational activity became a mystical\n\nwork of self-salvation.”53 This ‘recession from transcendence’\n\npermitted the release of tremendous spiritual energy for the\n\npursuit of worldly achievement; in building civilization, man was\n\nearning salvation itself. Insofar as civilizational pursuits became a\n\ndiversion from or substitute for genuine spirituality, however, the\n\ntrue life of the spirit was vitiated. Insofar as intramundane activity\n\n“absorbed into itself the eternal destiny of man,” the transcendent\n\nexperiences which are the source of both personal and social order\n\ntended to disappear or become unintelligible. “The price of\n\nprogress,” Voegelin observes, “is the death of the spirit.”54\n\nThe absurd and even demonic consequences of the modern\n\ndrive to immanentization are dramatically illustrated by the\n\nexample of Auguste Comte, the founder of the “religion of\n\nhumanity.” Comte was moved to proclaim himself the new\n\nChrist, the “world-immanent last judge of mankind, deciding on\n\nimmortality or annihilation for every human being.”55 The memory\n\nof those who had made significant intramundane contributions\n\nwould, he declared, be preserved forever in the annals of mankind;\n\nindeed, the especially illustrious would earn a spot on the\n\npositivist “calendar of saints.” Those who failed to make an\n\nenduring contribution to immanentist human welfare were, on\n\nthe other hand, to be consigned to social oblivion; their memories\n\nwould simply be erased from the records of human existence.\n\nComte’s ideas were taken seriously by many eminent persons,\n\nJohn Stuart Mill among them. How could this be? Voegelin’s\n\nanswer is that Comtean messianism is not all that far removed\n\nfrom the ethos of secular liberal progressivism and its ideal of\n\never-advancing immanentist progress. Progressivism, like its\n\nideological brethren, is a manifestation of existential imbalance;\n\nit too relegates the transcendent to oblivion. Thus, from the\n\nVoegelinian perspective, liberal progressivism appears as far less\n\nbenign than its proponents believe. Not only does it impoverish\n\nhuman existence by identifying “progress” with material advance,\n\nbut, in relegating the spiritual life to the private sphere, it created\n\na spiritual vacuum in the “public square” into which the messianic\n\nideologues with their promise of ultimate fulfillment on earth\n\neagerly rushed. The end of a radically immanentist “progressivism”\n\nis not, Voegelin warns, the emergence of positivist supermen\n\nor a realm of earthly paradise, but the gulag and the concentration\n\ncamp. As he starkly put it, the “progressivist symbolism of contributions,\n\ncommemorations, and oblivion [characteristic not only of\n\nComte but of liberal-progressivism in general] draws the contours\n\nof those ‘holes of oblivion’ into which the divine redeemers of the\n\ngnostic empires drop their victims with a bullet in the neck.”56\n\nDespite all of this, however, there is ground for hope, for\n\nhuman nature does not change. “The closure of the soul in modern\n\ngnosticism can repress the truth of the soul,\n\nbut it can not remove the soul and its transcendence from the\n\nstructure of reality.” The flight from reality can not last forever.\n\nMoreover, the eschatological interpretation of history results in\n\na false picture of reality (the order of concrete human societies is\n\nnot in fact an eschaton); and errors with regard to the structure\n\nof reality have practical consequences. Surely the recent collapse\n\nof the former Soviet Union should give pause to even the most\n\nzealous ideologues.\n\nVoegelin’s work constitutes a major contribution to the investigation\n\nof personal and social disorder from an ontological\n\nperspective; his insights into the respective orders of being and\n\npolitics remind us that the nature of being cannot be ignored in an\n\nexamination of political (or indeed any other) phenomena. Although\n\nthese are thorny and difficult, if not “impenetrable,”\n\nmatters, the participatory exploration of the nature of reality as\n\npracticed by Voegelin is surely the sine qua non for the advance of\n\nknowledge in this area; surely he is correct to suggest that the path\n\ntoward personal and social order must begin with the existential\n\nrecovery of its transcendent source. Voegelin lovingly probed the\n\nbeyond in search of truth. The tragedy of our time should impel\n\neach of us to undertake a similar exploration. For we have learned\n\nthat existence divorced from the comprehensive reality which\n\nsustains and nourishes it is a wasteland indeed.\n\nLinda C.
