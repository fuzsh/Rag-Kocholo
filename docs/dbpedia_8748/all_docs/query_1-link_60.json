        "text": "View as PDF\n\n36th International Meeting of THE ERIC VOEGELIN SOCIETY, 2020\n\nAmerican Political Science Association Meeting,\n\nSeptember 10-13,\n\nScheduled for San Francisco, Moved Online\n\nDavid Walsh, Meeting Director\n\nwalshd@cua.edu\n\nDear Friends,\n\nThis is our modified EVS meeting that is significantly adjusted from what was distributed earlier in the summer. Please take note that the times here are listed as MT (Mountain Time). You will have to calculate the time for your own time zone. Eastern Time is obtained by adding two hours to the times listed below. This was a convention selected by APSA to accommodate a meeting that takes place nowhere, just like St. Thomas More’s Utopia. So while you too will not be travelling, you will be visiting that strange island. Registration is required by our host and they will oversee the login authentications. Much will depend on the good offices of our panel chairs who should familiarize themselves with videoconferencing basics. Please consult the guidelines distributed by APSA.\n\nAs always it is very important that the panelists receive your paper or remarks in advance of the meeting. Discussants should be given the opportunity to prepare responses and fellow panelists may wish to make comments as well. For many years the Eric Voegelin Institute has posted papers and maintained an archive. I strongly encourage you to forward your papers to Jim Stoner (poston@lsu.edu) who will preserve this record of our proceedings.\n\nAnother item of note is that APSA wishes to include the Related Groups among their listed divisions. This means that we need to have all who are APSA members indicate the Eric Voegelin Society among the divisions to which they belong. Simply login as a member, click on your name at the top, look over the Related Groups boxes, and click EVS. Nothing more is required at this time, although this may purport other changes in the relationship which is now 36 years old! The only requirement is that Related Groups have at least 35 members, which is definitely not a problem for us. For now this may merely be a housekeeping exercise, but one that I strongly urge you to take care of as soon as you can.\n\nFinally, I remind you of the continued importance of your contributions. Unlike the residents of Utopia we have not been entirely able to dispense with the need for money. In particular we have continuing needs in the area of digital support. VoegelinView may be virtual but it is not free. Even with the volunteer labor on which it exists there are recurrent expenses of a professional nature. We depend on the generosity of contributors and donors who should send their remittances by clicking the Donate button.\n\nPublications\n\nAs everyone knows, the Eric Voegelin Society seeks to occupy the frontiers of science, even as those boundaries lie further back in time. The launch of a new series at the University of Notre Dame Press, under the editorship of James Stoner and David Walsh, is emblematic of our aspiration to think about politics in the most comprehensive horizon. With a Voegelinian nod it is titled THE BEGINNING AND THE BEYOND OF POLITICS. We are pleased to be associated with the fine work of the Press under its Director, Steve Wrinn, and to be listed alongside Solzhenitsyn, Manent, and other luminaries. The first two volumes of the series have just appeared, Barry Cooper, Paleolithic Politics: The Human Community in Early Art, and David Walsh, The Priority of the Person: Political, Philosophical, and Historical Discoveries. Other members who have recently published books include Trevor Shelley, Globalization and Liberalism: Montesquieu, Tocqueville, and Manent (also Notre Dame), James Greenaway (ed.), Human Dignity, Education, and Political Society: A Philosophical Defense of the Liberal Arts (Lexington), and our indefatigable Lee Trepanier (ed.), Eric Voegelin’s Asian Political Thought (Lexington). Finally, please note our author-meets-critics panel devoted to Greg Collins’s, Commerce and Manners: Edmund Burke’s Political Economy.\n\nNotes on the Virtual Format\n\nThe Eric Voegelin Society has at this point weathered many a storm and I’m sure we will overcome this pandemic migration to an online format. Like most things in life we learn what we need mainly by doing it. Riding a bicycle cannot be mastered by reading the manual. So for those who have not had the exposure to virtual communication many of us have endured in recent months, please take courage. Our panels will not be like Zoom meetings to which you respond from an invitation. They will be simpler than that. Just go to the program, sign in with your name and password when you registered, find your panel or the panel you want to observe, click on it and you’re in. You can even go there right now, although no one else is likely to be present. Don’t worry, we will all arrive at the appointed day and time. Your room is already open. The times listed on the APSA website correspond to your time zone. Make sure you have the correct time for your panel. Technical support is available throughout. Please note that the Business Meeting and Reception on Saturday will be a Zoom meeting, which you can find under the APSA Panels and Receptions or by searching for it.\n\nWednesday, September 9, 2:00-3:30\n\nPanel 1: Roundtable on Human Dignity, Liberal Education, and Political Society\n\nChair: Jeffrey Polet, polet@hope.edu; Hope College\n\nJames Greenaway, jgreenaway@stmarytx.edu; St. Mary’s University\n\nSteven McGuire, sfmcguire@gmail.com; Villanova University Carol B Cooper, carol.b.cooper@gmail.com; University of Houston\n\nAndrew Bove, andrew.j.bove@villanova.edu; Villanova University\n\nThursday, September 10, 8:00-9:30\n\nPanel 2: Music and Poetry as Constitutive of Political Community\n\nChair: Thomas Heilke, thomas.heilke@ubc.ca; University of British Columbia\n\nLaw, Music, and Friendship in Aristotle’s Best Regime\n\nJohn Boersma, jboers1@lsu.edu; Louisiana State University\n\n“The Body Itself Balks Account”: Whitman’s Carnal Burkeanism and Democracy\n\nDavid M.
