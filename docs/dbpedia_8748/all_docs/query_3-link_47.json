        "text": "Myth has a convoluted etymological history in terms of its origins, meanings, and functions. Throughout this essay I explore the signification, structure, and essence of myth in terms of its source, force, form, object, and teleology derived from archaic ontology. Here I offer a theoretic typology of myth by engaging the work of contemporary scholar, Robert A. Segal, who places fine distinctions on criteria of explanation versus interpretation when theorizing about myth historically derived from methodologies employed in analytic philosophy and the philosophy of science. Through my analysis of an explanandum and an explanans, I argue that both interpretation and explanation are acts of explication that signify the ontological significance, truth, and psychic reality of myth in both individuals and social collectives. I conclude that, in essence, myth is a form of inner sense.\n\nThe present paper is an introduction to the debate on the contemporary methodology of research on myths. I attempt herein to elucidate the essence of myth, with the attempt being carried out in two parts. In the first part, I overview a history of the philosophical debate on the subject as well as I specify the reasons why myth ought to be reunited with truth anew, as was the case with Greek philosophers. In the latter part, I deal with the analysis of myth in relation with a human being – both in the individualist senseand in the social one, with the latter sense performing a significant role in understanding the world as well as humanity at large. Furthermore, I suggest what the essence of myth might be and what validity it can have for the contemporary man. The reflection included in the present text is inspired by some pertinent philosophical conceptions that allow me to show that it is possible to say something new about myth and the research thereupon.\n\nStarting with a personal definition of \"myth\" , this paper seeks to substantiate the claim that every myth is essentially etiological, in the sense that myths somehow express a cosmogony or an eschatology, whether particular or universal. In order to do that, this study reassesses Classical and Judeo-Christian mythologies to revisit and contrast the narratives of origin—of the cosmos, of the gods and of men—found in ancient polytheism and in Judeo-Christian monotheism. Taking into consideration how these general and particular cosmogonies convey a specific understanding of the passage of time, this article does not merely recount the cosmogonies, theogonies, and anthropogonies found in the Bible and in the works of authors from Classical Antiquity, but it also incorporates a critical commentary on pieces of art and literature that have reinterpreted such mythical tales in more recent times. The result of the research is the disclosure of a sort of universal etiology that may be found in mythology which, as argued, explains the origins of the world, of the gods, and of men so as to satisfy humankind's ambition to unveil the mysteries of the cosmos. Myth thus functions in these cases as a vehicle that makes it possible for man to return the fullness of a primordial age, abandoning the fleeting time that entraps him and entering a time still absolute."
