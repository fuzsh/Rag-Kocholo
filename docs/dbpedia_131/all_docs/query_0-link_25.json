        "text": "History\n\nThe name \"Dilsukhnagar\" is derived from Dilsukh Ramprasad, an agricultural land owner who lived around Malakpet. It is said that he subdivided his land into plots and built a colony which he named Dilsukhnagar.\n\nDilsukhnagar was once a purely residential suburb; however, in the last decade strong economic growth has transformed it into a major commercial hub.\n\nIncidents\n\nThe locality has been subject to terrorist attacks twice in its history. Both cases involved attacks using a time bomb. The first incident happened in 2002, allegedly planted by SIMI, investigation of which is underway.[4] The second incident involving twin blasts occurred in 2013, killing 13 people while injuring 83 others.[5] Death toll enhanced to 17 in the ensuing days.[6] Members of Indian Mujahideen, a terrorist group, were eventually convicted for their role in the blasts.[7]"
