        "text": "Set up in 1964, Joshi Masala Stores is a Hyderabadi store that has customers from all over the country. Their store inside Vegetable Market in Badichowdi is modest, but the aroma of spices makes it irresistible. They have over 20 flavours that not only include classic mango pickle, ginger, and tomato but also Andhra style gongura, green-chilly lemon, tamarind, and amla pickles (INR 240 per Kg).\n\nSo, whether you've just moved to Hyderabad or are moving abroad, you can depend on this store to give you the best of home-made relishes. They specialise in packing these mouth-watering pickles for overseas, ensuring you never miss out on flavoursome food. Apart from pickles, they sell powders, spices, snacks, and sweets as well. If you're fond of Maharashtrian food like metkut, kurodi (A crunchy delicacy like papad), or Marwadi Mirchis and Besan Ladoos, you can get that here as well. Their Baagara Baingan Masala is apparently a best-seller, so try it out!\n\nThe store delivers to all parts of the city, and they have branches in West Marredpally and Nallakunta."
