        "text": "Best Schools in Badi Chowdi, Hyderabad\n\nTelangana’s capital, Hyderabad, is one of the largest cities in India. A town that is situated on a hilly terrain and is surrounded by artificial lakes. It has around 7 million people in residence within the city limit, making it one of the most populous metropolitans in India. As a capital city, Hyderabad hosts many prominent educational institutions like the University of Hyderabad and Osmania University.\n\nThe growing city always needs better education, especially at the school level. It motivated many to start private schools, which later became the backbone of Hyderabad’s primary education system. These excellent schools are affiliated with many national and international boards and provide an education that helps students professionally and personally. Selecting a school here will help your child to be a good performer in every area of life.\n\nAge criteria of schools\n\nThe age criteria for sending children to schools will differ, but the criteria below are primarily found in Hyderabad and other parts of Telangana.\n\n1. Nursery- Accepts children between 2.5 to 3.5 years\n\n2. LKG- Admits children in between 3.5 to 4.5 years\n\n3. UKG- Accepts children between 4.5 to 5.5 years\n\nWhat fee you can expect in Badi Chowdi, Hyderabad\n\nLots of schools are taking part in the mission of educating the young generation for a better tomorrow. The fee you may expect in each school will be different depending on various factors. It may include many things, but it is mainly found considering the criteria, including quality, facilities, infrastructure, and curriculum. It is difficult to say how much a school collects, but you can get them on a particular school's website. If you are looking for an average fee, it comes to around Rs 30,000 to 7 lakhs. What is mentioned here is the average annual fee found in most of the schools in the city. If you want to check all the school fees in one place, please visit our website, Edustoke. When you enter our platform, you get all the necessary details to make a good decision.\n\nHow do you select a school for your child?\n\nAre you looking for the best schools in Badi Chowdi, Hyderabad? Before selecting one, you must consider many factors and check whether the particular institution fits your child’s future. Looking at the criteria mentioned below will help you make an informed decision.\n\nCurriculum\n\nMostly, you find Indian and foreign curricula in Hyderabad, like other cities. It is nothing that a curriculum is better than others, but it has uniqueness compared to others. For example, you take IB, which can quickly transfer around the globe, but others need this option. So, understand your child’s capacity and future requirements before you opt for a syllabus. Making the right choice at present will ensure your child has a happy life later on.\n\nResults and quality\n\nThe history of a man tells who he is. It’s a famous quote in English to analyse a man’s character. This idea applies to schools, too. Examine the history of results of at least two to three years, not only in academics but also in every area. It gives you an idea about the quality of the schools and helps you make a good decision based on that. Analyse the quality with various criteria such as academics, years of experience, extracurricular activities, and more.\n\nFaculties\n\nThe quality of teachers always reflects on the quality of students. A school with enthusiastic, well-qualified, and experienced teachers will always succeed in all areas. They are the ones who make a school stand tall and help children lead a better life with their way of life and experience. There must be many things to observe while looking at faculties, like qualifications, experience, teaching methods, and how they deal with children and parents. Also, see whether they are offering individual attention to all.\n\nLocation\n\nA location has many advantages, especially for working parents. If the school is too far from your residence, it causes you and your kid lots of trouble. Select a school that can be accessed easily from your place, which will help you in any emergency. Since it is a city, opt for a school where you experience less traffic because your child does not want to spend more time travelling alone.\n\nFacilities\n\nYou might see many advantages mentioned on the school website, but ensure all these are possible within their facilities. Sometimes, you see more extracurricular activities but need more space to implement them. Learn about the basic things such as class, furniture, smart classes, libraries, labs, and more. The other facilities include grounds, tracks, an auditorium, an art room, and more. Explore the list of the best schools in Badi Chowdi, Hyderabad, on our site, where you can experience the top facilities in the world.\n\nExtracurricular activities\n\nHolistic education is prevalent in today’s world. As a parent, you believe that your child must excel both in class and outside. Getting extracurricular activities is easy, but ensures your child’s favourite item is included in the list. Expert coaching is also a great factor parents must consider while looking at the other activities of an institution.\n\nDifferent options for curricula\n\n• IB (The International Baccalaureate) consists of a Programme (PYP) for 3 to 12 students, the Middle Years Programme (MYP) for 11 to 16 students, and the Diploma Programme (DP) for the 16 to 19 age group.\n\n• IGCSE (The International General Certificate of Secondary Education) is widely accepted for students aged 14-16.\n\n• BSET (The Board of Secondary Education, Telangana) or Telangana Board of Secondary Education.\n\n• CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education)\n\n• CISCE (Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations) has two wings: the ICSE (Indian Certificate of Secondary Education) for class 10 and the ISC (Indian School Certificate) for class 12.\n\nHow can Edustoke guide you for admission?\n\nEdustoke is India's number one online school search platform with experience in counselling millions of parents.
