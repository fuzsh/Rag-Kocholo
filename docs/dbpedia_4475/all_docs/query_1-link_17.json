        "text": "The United States officially entered World War I on April 6, 1917 and the fighting ceased on November 11, 1918. During that time 35,448 men from North Dakota served in the Armed Forces and over 1300 of them did not make it back home. While men volunteered or were drafted to serve a wide variety of roles during the war, women served primarily as nurses through the Red Cross or the Army Nurse Corps. Twenty percent of the registered nurses in North Dakota signed up with the Red Cross and forty percent of those worked near the front at military hospitals. Many more women were inspired to train to become nurses during the war as well.\n\nSusan Wefald of Bismarck conducted the research to locate World War I memorials in North Dakota and graciously shared her findings with the State Historical Society of North Dakota. Only memorials constructed specifically to commemorate WWI are included. This page was created with her research and the cooperation of State Historical Society employees around the state in order to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of World War I. Forty-two memorials were found in Amidon, Belfield, Bismarck, Bottineau, Cando, Devils Lake, Dickinson, Enderlin, Flaxton, Grand Forks, Grand Rapids, Hankinson, Jamestown, Kenmare, Leeds, Linton, Lisbon, Mandan, Minnewaukan, Minot, Mohall, Mott, New England, Noonan, Pembina, Rolette, Rugby, Spiritwood Lake, Stanley, Steele, Towner, Wahpeton, Williston and Wilton. It was also found that several memorials no longer exist: Fred Smith State Park was returned to private ownership in 1975 and could not be located in 2016, the Grand Forks County Courthouse Veterans Memorial Club Rooms flooded in 1997 and the rooms were not restored, the plaque from Oberon's monument was not in place during a 2016 site visit, and the Streeter Memorial State Park has been underwater since the mid-1990s. Two plaques honoring Lloyd Spetz, the first soldier from Bismarck to die in the war, and Quentin Roosevelt that were on trees that no longer exist are now part of the State Museum's collection.\n\n*A monument naming the first three servicemen who died during the war was dedicated November 3, 1917 in Van Buren, Arkansas. The monument in Rose Hill Cemetery appears to be the first one that is for a group rather than for specifically named individuals."
