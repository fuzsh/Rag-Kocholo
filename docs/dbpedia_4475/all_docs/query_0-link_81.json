        "text": "Built in 2012 as a joint project of the Kansas Singletrack Society and the City of Wichita, Air Capital Memorial Park Singletrack Trail provides a suburban venue for off-road bicycle riders and runners. This wooded trail system consists of three connected loops that total a distance of about 2 miles.\n\nBut do not let the short distance distract you from this trail's fun factor. It feels longer than it is. There is a beginners North Loop, Intermediate West Loop and the more challenging East Loop. Each loop has twists, turns, and technical features that will challenge and please all riders. Helmets required. Please note that Pawnee Prairie Park, the land south of the park, is closed to bikes and riding there is punishable by law.\n\nThe trailhead is located on the west side of Wichita, just southeast of Kellogg/ US 54 and Maize Road at the Kellogg Frontage Road and Seville Street"
