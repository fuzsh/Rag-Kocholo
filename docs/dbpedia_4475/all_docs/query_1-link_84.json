        "text": "My Washington office is available to assist you in obtaining tour tickets for some of these attractions. My staff can also provide maps and brochures.\n\nWe are located in room 731 of the Hart Senate Office Building, located at the corner of 2nd and C Streets, NE, across from Union Station. Please drop by and say hello when you are in town.\n\nHere are several resources to assist you in planning your trip to Washington. I hope they are helpful.\n\nHELPFUL HINTS:\n\nBefore you arrive in Washington, be sure to make your lodging reservations. Because of the high demand for hotel accommodations in the Washington area, it is usually unwise to arrive without a reservation. The downtown area can be expensive, so you may want to consider hotels in the nearby Virginia or Maryland suburbs. Be sure to consider access to the Metro, since taxi trips that cross state lines can be expensive.\n\nWashington has an extensive public transit system that is affordable and often faster than driving around town. The Metro, DC's subway system, can take you all over the city and into some suburbs. Fares range from $1.75 to $5.90 each way. Farecards can be purchased at every Metro station. Bus fare is $1.75 each way.\n\nParking can be scarce around major tourist areas, so it is usually best to take the Metro or a taxi to those areas.\n\nPlease note that neither I nor the U.S. Senate can take responsibility for any of the locations listed below. Listing on this page does not constitute my endorsement. Links to these sites will take you out of the U.S. Senate's web server, and I cannot be responsible for the information you find there.
