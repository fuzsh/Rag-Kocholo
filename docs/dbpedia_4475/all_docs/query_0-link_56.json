        "text": "DAYTON DUNCAN\n\nIntroduction to the Bison Books Edition\n\nA few years ago I was helping my friend Stephen Ambrose lead a group of people along some of the most scenic stretches of the Lewis and Clark Trail. On a warm summer evening, after a pleasant day of paddling canoes on the Missouri River, we camped amid the eerie and majestic White Cliffs of north-central Montana, close to the exact spot where, or 31 May 1805, Meriwether Lewis wrote one of his most lyrical journal passages about the wondrous landscape he and his men were encountering with such fresh eyes. \"As we passed on,\" Lewis concluded, \"it seemed as if those seens of visionary inchantment would never have an end.\"\n\nNearly two centuries later we found the enchantment equally palpable as we sat around the campfire and gazed at the silent cliffs reflected in the river, tinged pink by the setting sun. There were about thirty of us in the group, roughly the same number as in the original Corps of Discovery. Beyond that one feature of our trip–and our geographical location–most of the similarities between the two expeditions ended. On average our group's members were about thirty years older than the young men under the command of Lewis and Clark (along with one teenaged Indian woman and her infant son). We had paddled downstream to our camp (which was tiring enough for people our age), but nothing we did could be compared to dragging bulky dugouts day in and day out against the Missouri's relentless current. Unlike the Corps of Discovery, we felt no concerns about grizzly bears (they disappeared from the river a century ago), getting lost (we had precise maps and an experienced outfitter), or finding horses when the canoe portion of our journey ended (a chartered bus was hired to take us back to our parked cars). Having studied the history of the expedition in some detail, we also had made sure of another important difference: unlike the Corps of Discovery, we were absolutely not going to run out of whiskey.\n\nThat evening, after Steve and I took turns reading aloud from the journals, he spoke for a few minutes about teamwork. It's a point he had eloquently made three years earlier in the documentary film Ken Burns and I produced for public television: how after so many days together in their struggle to cross the continent, members of the Corps of Discovery eventually became so close to one another that they could hear a cough in the night and know who it was; they could recognize the sound of each other's footsteps; they knew who was best at hunting, at starting a fire, or at any other task; they even knew who liked salt on his meat and who didn't. Such detailed knowledge about everyone else's personal habits and strengths—a simultaneous acknowledgment of individuality within a group that itself has begun to act as a single, organic unit—is the natural byproduct of the intimate bond of teamwork so crucial to the success of any expedition.\n\nEveryone around the campfire nodded in agreement, then headed for their sleeping bags. The next morning I told Steve he could add another item of familiarity to his list. After only one night of camping together, I said, we already knew who snored and who didn't—and we would be pitching our tents accordingly for the remainder of the trip.\n\nDid any members of the Lewis and Clark expedition snore? If so, which ones? Was it a gentle sawing sound that encouraged the others to sleep, like the croaking of frogs on a riverbank? Or was it a series of erratically erupting snorts and rasps, perhaps even a grand anvil chorus of a dozen or more men that reverberated out of the tents, echoed over the hills, and alarmed the wild beasts of the Plains? Did their non-snoring campmates ponder (as that other great American adventurer Huckleberry Finn would have) the age-old conundrum, the \"curiosest thing in the world\": why is the snorer, the person closest to the sound, the only one left undisturbed by his snoring? Did they kick or shove or toss sticks at the offender? Or did they simply lie there, wide awake and murderously sleep deprived, silently calculating how hard it would be to slip a few doses of Rush's Thunderbolts (that super-powered laxative) into someone's breakfast?\n\nWe don't know the answers to these questions because the primary source of information, the expedition's journals, doesn't provide them. But it's a safe bet that every single member of the Corps of Discovery could have answered them, and probably in elaborate detail.\n\nThe men considered some specific disruptions of their slumber important enough to mention in their journals. The night before the expedition entered the White Cliffs, for instance, a buffalo bull stampeded into the sleeping camp, rampaged around the four fires, bent a rifle and one of the blunderbusses with its pounding hooves, and, according to Sgt. John Ordway, came \"within a flew Inches of Several mens heads\" before Lewis's dog, Seaman, chased it away. \"It was Supposed,\" Ordway added, that \"if he had trod on a man it would have killed him dead.\"' This puts the issue of being awakened by snoring in a different perspective. Or consider the night of 26 July 1806, on the Corps's return trip, when a vicious wolf sank its fangs into the hand of Sgt. Nathaniel Pryor the kind of disturbance that might rouse anyone from even the deepest of dreams.\n\nBoth captains reported times when the worries of leadership prevented them from sleeping: William Clark, when the entire crew was required to spend the night on their keelboat, surrounded by hundreds of Teton warriors; Lewis, when he camped near Lemhi Pass with a band of Shoshones, whom he feared were about to abandon him before he could purchase any of their desperately needed horses. Seaman the dog had his own share of what Lewis called \"wristless nights\"–constantly patrolling the campsites after dark in bear country to warn the men of approaching grizzlies, as if the responsibility to allow others some wellearned rest was his alone.\n\nMost other recorded bouts with insomnia, though far less dramatic, are nonetheless helpful in providing a fuller picture of the expedition's experience. At a site west of the Yellowstone River the beaver were so numerous that the slapping of their tails on the water kept some men from nodding off; near the mouth of the Columbia the huge and noisy flocks of geese and brants had done the same thing. Along the Missouri mosquitoes caused at least two sleepless nights (and probably innumerable others unrecorded); fleas were the problem at Fort Clatsop. Among the Nez Percés in Idaho, after the nearly starved men had unadvisedly gorged themselves on salmon and camas root, Clark dutifully noted in his journal that the feast \"filled us so full of wind, that we were scercely able to Breathe all night\" (and then, thankfully, he left additional details of the evening to the imagination).\n\nBut nowhere in the journals–among the hundreds of thousands of words that chronicle every day of the historic two-and-a-half-year expedition that brim with a remarkable accumulation of information—do we learn who among the Corps of Discovery snored his way across the continent and back.\n\nObviously the issues of sleep and snoring are not the most critical points of consideration in the epic journey of Lewis and Clark and their fellow explorers. But they do lead to larger, more important ones.\n\nFirst, despite the incredible wealth of detail in the expedition's journals, much went unrecorded for posterity. (This is not so much a complaint as an observation.) Embarked as they were on an arduous trek into unmapped territory, where every bend in the river and every new horizon might spell discouragement, disaster, or defeat, the insistent priorities of mere survival could easily have overwhelmed the more prosaic task of taking pen to paper every evening. That they wrote at all—let alone created such an enduring classic among the annals of exploration—stands as a stunning achievement in itself, a testament both to President Jefferson's farsighted instructions that \"your observations are to be taken with great pains & accuracy, to be entered distinctly & intelligibly for others as well as yourself,\" and to their diligence in carrying out those orders, even in the most difficult situations.\n\nJournals from six men have survived: those of Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, Sergeants John Ordway, Patrick Gass, and Charles Floyd, and Private Joseph Whitehouse. Taken together their commentaries leave no day of the expedition unrecorded, and for most days provide multiple perspectives from which to triangulate events. In addition, Sergeant Pryor and Private Robert Frazer are presumed to have kept journals as well, as yet unrecovered. What has been lost from not hearing their voices? How much more would we learn from the personal accounts of others on the expedition, such as York, Clark's black slave; or Sacagawea, the young Shoshone woman, and Charbonneau, her French Canadian husband; or the other enlisted men? It's impossible to tell.\n\nThis leads to a second issue: the nature of the journals themselves. These are not the diaries of teenage girls, full of emotion and juicy gossip, meant as an outlet for personal feelings and destined to be kept under lock and key for fear of embarrassment. Nor are they the journals of mature adults as we might expect them to be written today, recording a day's activities as a springboard for someone's innermost thoughts and contemplations. These are the journals of busy military men writing under orders from the president of the United States, recording information meant to be useful to him and the rest of the \"civilized world,\" and fully anticipating that what they set down would be published in some form or another. In other words, the more personal the informationfrom the trivial (naming names about snoring habits) to the profound (private desires and misgivings, or frank assessments of another expedition member's strengths and weaknesses)—the less likely the Corps of Discovery's chroniclers are to reveal it.\n\nOn a few occasions Lewis displays a histrionic yearning for glory or alternately provides brief glimpses into the darker recesses of his soul. Clark sometimes whines about his health or exhibits a fatherly concern for the welfare of his men. Ordway's descriptions of the most dangerous moments come the closest to expressing outright fear, just as his entries about Christmas and his longing to return home seem the most heartfelt. In general, though, the information the journals provide exists within a fairly narrow range: miles traveled, the day's weather, locations of campsites, new species and new landscapes encountered, Indian tribes met and the prospects for trade, brief accountings of the day's highlights, and soon. All the things, in other words, that Mr. Jefferson so anxiously awaited. He wasn't interested in reading a novel of western adventure, he wanted facts. The Corps of Discovery obeyed by returning with a prodigious number of them.\n\nIf Jefferson had added in his instructions to \"Take equal pains to tell us more about yourselves and your traveling companions, your own habits, beliefs, and customs, &c.,\" the journalists might possibly have taken a soldierly stab at it–though it is as difficult to imagine them doing so with much enthusiasm as it is to imagine the shy and secretive president wanting that kind of information in the first place. His priorities were clear: he wanted facts, not story.\n\nNevertheless, from the unelaborated facts alone a dramatic narrative emerges, one that is chock full of more heart-pounding near misses than most novels of the day would have dared attempt: a crumbling riverbank nearly overwhelms the keelboat; Lewis nearly falls to his death from a cliff; a confrontation with the Teton Sioux nearly turns deadly for both sides; men nearly freeze to death on the northern Plains; buffaloes nearly trample them and grizzly bears nearly catch them; a pirogue containing the most valuable cargo nearly capsizes; the expedition nearly takes a disastrous turn up the wrong river; a violent hailstorm nearly kills some of the men, while a flash flood nearly sweeps Clark to his death; Sacagawea nearly dies from sickness; her people, the Shoshones (with their all-important horses), nearly abandon Lewis; while crossing the Bitterroot Range, nearly lost, everyone nearly starves; the Nez Percés nearly decide to kill rather than befriend the weak and starving strangers; Columbia River cascades and then ocean swells nearly swamp the small flotilla of dugout canoes; Blackfeet warriors nearly leave Lewis and a few companions horseless and gunless in hostile territory;, Lewis is shot and nearly killed in a hunting accident. (And, unbeknownst to the expedition, Spanish war parties dispatched for their destruction nearly intercept them.)\n\nJust as facts overshadow feelings and personalities in the journals, the repetitive drumbeat of dramatic moments eventually drowns out the details of the more mundane day-to-day routines and the quiet heroics of getting up each morning for yet another exhausting day of moving only a few miles more across a seemingly endless continent. What is captured in the bargain is undoubtedly the most important information, as well as the most stirring moments. But what is lost is a fuller sense of the participants in this historic event, and perhaps some greater insights the participants in this historic event, and perhaps some greater insights into how they succeeded so spectacularly. It's like reading an intricately plotted, action-packed, and highly informative novel that is sadly populated by rather featureless characters, or embarking on an epic adventure without really getting to know everyone else along on the trip.\n\nExacerbating the problem with all this lost potential is the way in which the captains overshadow everyone else. From the very start the historic enterprise tended to be viewed from the top down. President Jefferson, for instance, always considered it the \"Lewis Expedition,\" reflecting his notion that Lewis was the only one to whom he had delegated authority and who therefore was solely responsible for the journey's outcome. Lewis knew better. He was the first to add Clark to the expedition's name, and always insisted that his trusted friend shared in the fame (just as he had shared in the decision making throughout the hard journey). So successful were these two remarkable leaders at melding their talents that they now seem historically joined at the hip, two quite different men who cast an even larger shadow because they stand together. They are unquestionably the \"stars\" of the story and the ones we most easily recognize, not only because they were the leaders but also because they are the story's principal narrators. Despite the existence of other journals, we turn to the captains' version of events first.\n\nFrom time to time in the story a few other members of the expedition threaten to emerge as personalities in their own right, however fleetingly. The lavish attentions and honor which Indians paid to York because of his black skin prompt the journalists to take note of it, too, although for most of the expedition his presence–and its social ramifications–goes unremarked. Did some of the men (many from slave-holding states) resent those attentions? Did any consider him their friend and equal? What were York's thoughts? As they all paddled furiously down the Missouri toward home in 1806, did he expect that whatever newly found freedoms he had gained from the journey (if indeed any were gained) would be extended to him once they reached St. Louis?\n\nSimilar questions could be asked–and left unanswered–about Sacagawea, the only woman, mother, and full-blood Indian on the expedition. She figures prominently in some of the more dramatic moments (such as the near capsizing of the white pirogue and, of course, the Shoshone negotiations with a chief who miraculously turns out to be her brother), and we get a few hints at her character (such as when she insists on being taken to see the beached whale on the Oregon coast, or when she presents Clark with a Christmas present of two dozen white weasel tails). But she is absent from the recorded story as often as she is in it, and her point of view is available only through speculation.\n\nWhat Sacagawea and York have in common–and, to a lesser extent, what Charbonneau, George Drouillard (a mixed-blood of French and Shawnee descent), the baby Jean Baptiste, and even what the dog, Seaman, also share–is what sets them apart from those we call simply \"the men.\" That's merely another way of saying \"everyone else.\" While these few stand out as individual characters in the saga, most often \"the men\" come across as an undifferentiated whole, a single unit comprised of interchangeable parts rather than a collection of individuals, each one with his own distinct personality, his own foibles and strengths, his own role to play, his own unique perspective on the larger experience. History has tended to lump them all together as \"the men\" and left it at that.\n\nClearly they didn't see it that way. As military men they recognized the authority and leadership of their captains and no doubt accepted the enterprise as the \"Lewis and Clark Expedition.\" But as human beings (and, equally pertinent, as Americans in the first generation of independence), each man surely considered it his expedition–in experience if not in name. \"The men\" were individuals with individual names, individual attributes, and individual stories to tell.\n\nCharles Clarke's Men of the Lewis & Clark Expedition, first published in 1970, was one of the first to remind the world of that selfevident but too-often-overlooked fact. As he wrote in his introduction, Clarke's purpose was to \"bring these men into being again and to rescue them from oblivion so far as is possible at this late date.\" So far as is possible at this late date. Unfortunately, for the many reasons mentioned–the missing voices, the circumscribed nature of the journals' focus, the dominance of the captains (and a few others) as individual characters–what is \"possible at this late date\" carries special weight and places severe constraints on a noble (and eloquently stated) goal. If \"the men\" have not exactly been fully brought back into being again in these pages, the reason is a simple lack of documentary raw material.\n\nBut they can be rescued from complete oblivion. By providing biographical sketches of fifty-one expedition members and then arranging a synopsis of each day's events with an emphasis on those things directly relating to each of the members, Charles Clarke performed a valuable service. One by one \"the men\" struggle to emerge as the individuals they surely must have been. Yet the facts–or, more precisely, the lack of enough facts–constantly limit their complete resuscitation. Enough exists to reassemble a skeleton and perhaps a bit of flesh, but, so far as is possible at this late date, breathing real life and blood into them is now probably best left to historical novelists. As for the rest of us, we can string together the available facts about an individual expedition member to hint at a fuller portrait and, with a little imagination, at least point ourselves toward a fuller understanding of what it must have been like to be a member of the greatest expedition in American history.\n\nConsider, for instance, one of my personal favorites, Alexander Hamilton Willard, one of the many men about whom there is more that we don't know than what we do know. Born along the Connecticut River in Charlestown, New Hampshire (just a few miles from my home), Willard was twenty-five years old, apparently a skilled blacksmith, and a private in the army when he joined the Corps of Discovery at its camp in Illinois during the winter of 1803–1804. What prompted Willard to volunteer for the expedition? How did he fit in with the other young men who tended toward rabble-rousing that first winter? What did he expect for the journey? (Fevered excitement? foreboding? feigned ambivalence?) These are all unknown. Aside from a few passing references–a jumbled list of recruits, a notation of who got drunk on New Year's Eve, the mention of bringing in a pair of hinges–Willard's name rarely appears in the early months of the journals.\n\nAs the expedition began its ascent up the Missouri, it appears Willard spent at least some days on shore riding horseback with George Drouillard, the expedition's chief scout and best hunter, which suggests that the captains recognized in him some level of competence with a gun and horses. Someone raised along the Connecticut would have been familiar with rivers, but the mighty Missouri's size, power, and soon-to- be-legendary treachery must have amazed Willard. Perhaps he was thankful to be assigned to hunting duty rather than fighting the Big Muddy with the others. Did he and Drouillard exchange stories from their very different backgrounds? Was there an implicit competition between them over who supplied the most fresh meat to the hungry men? Did the primeval hardwood forests of Missouri, with their majestic stands of hickory and oak, hearken him back to the gentle hills of New Hampshire, blanketed with trees as they might have been when Willard's ancestors first arrived in New England? We can speculate but we cannot know. The journals only report for certain that he and Drouillard were responsible for the horses in late May, that on at least one occasion he and other hunters killed three fat elk bulls, and that, in the organization of the party, he was assigned to the squad of Sergeant Ordway, a fellow New Hampshire native. It takes a careful reading of the early journals to be even aware of Willard's presence.\n\nBut on 12 July 1804, at Camp New Island, just north of what is now the Kansas-Nebraska line, Willard burst onto center stage in the expedition's narrative. He did it, ironically enough, by sleeping. During the first months of the expedition the captains had worked to instill military discipline on a group of young men who seem to have been particularly reluctant to accept it. There were cases of drunkenness (Willard's had been but one of many such infractions), open disobedience, men going AWOL, and night guards helping themselves to supplies (that is, the whiskey). In each case Lewis and Clark had convened a court-martial of enlisted men to hear the charges, judge the facts, and mete out punishments, usually consisting of fifty lashes.\n\nOn 12 July, however, the captains themselves composed the courtmartial because of the seriousness of the offense: falling asleep while on night guard duty, the kind of lapse that might endanger the entire expedition's survival in the wrong circumstance and obviously something Lewis and Clark wanted to make sure never happened again. The few facts we know of the incident are confined to the four terse paragraphs Lewis and Clark entered in the expedition's orderly book: Willard had been assigned as night sentinel the previous evening; his sergeant, Ordway, accused him of \"lying down and Sleeping on his post\"; the offense was considered \"Capatol Crimes, and under the rules and articles of War punishable by Death.\" Acting in his own defense, the report says, Willard made what I would consider to be the first attempt at a plea bargain west of the Mississippi River: \"Guilty of Lying Down, and not Guilty of Going to Sleep.\"\n\nWhether he had actually been asleep a few hours earlier (as charged) or not (as he claimed), Willard must surely have been fully alert during these proceedings. His life potentially hung in the balance as the captains weighed their decision and then announced it: guilty of both charges. An extra jolt of adrenaline must have rushed through his system in the brief moment between verdict and sentencing: not execution (obvious relief) but one hundred lashes on the bare back (a quick, reflexive tensing of shoulder muscles) to be administered in equal amounts over four nights.\n\nIt would be interesting–and informative–to know the other men's reaction to the trial, the verdict, and the next four evenings at each successive campsite, when Willard would have stepped forward to strip down his shirt and turn his face away to receive his nightly dose of twenty-five lashes. Perhaps some of the men, by now friends since spending seven months together, turned their faces away too. Maybe others relished the sight, harboring either some personal grudge against Willard or a belief that he truly had endangered their survival and deserved a stricter punishment. Once again the journals are of no help in creating a complete sense of the event. Gass, Whitehouse, and Floyd make no mention whatsoever of the court martial, let alone the nightly lashings. Ordway devotes only a single sentence to the incident (\"one Sentinel a Sleep on his post last night, and tried by court martial this day\"), omitting not only that Willard was the accused but that Ordway himself was the accuser. Is the near silence about the matter in the enlisted men's diaries significant? It's impossible to say.\n\nEqually lost to history is Willard's point of view. If wrongly accused he could have been justifiably resentful toward his sergeant and commanding officers; if caught \"fair and square\" he might have considered himself properly chastised, perhaps even lucky to have escaped with whatever skin was left on his back at the end of the fourth evening. Did Lewis (the chief dispenser of medicine) treat Willard's wounds each night? Did the floggings leave lasting scars? Was Willard comforted or shunned by his mates during the next few days? Was he brought back into the company of men with, perhaps, a few jokes, a friendly word, a helping hand during a task made difficult by a sore back? Answers to those questions would explain much about the dynamics of the Corps of Discovery–between the commanders and their men, between noncommissioned officers and their squads, within the group as a whole, or between individual members–but we could answer them only if we had more details. Instead we are left to wonder, extrapolate, speculate, yearn for fuller information, and, in the end, be thankful for the few facts we do have from which to populate this epic expedition with more than simply names on a list.\n\nWe know with certainty that July 1804 was not a good month for Private Willard, because he surfaces next in the joumals on 29 July when he was dispatched back to the previous night's campsite to retrieve a tomahawk he had forgotten, and then, while crossing a creek on a log, had lost his balance and dropped his rifle into the deep water. We know also that Reuben Field was sent out to rescue the gun from the creek's muddy bottom. Willard probably never forgot that humiliating day: the look in the captains' eyes or the sounds of their voices after he admitted to misplacing his tomahawk; the long walk to retrieve it; the moment on the log when he thought he would fall in, and the next moment, right after dropping his rifle, when he probably wished he had; the sight of Reuben Field disappearing underwater and his reappearance moments later with the prize; the talk and the looks of the other men when he and his sodden companion returned to camp and retold the story; the sinking feeling that perhaps he shouldn't have volunteered for the expedition in the first place. Regardless of how memorable that day was for Willard, the journals' mention of his part in it slides by in a few short sentences. We are told more about the weather (dark with occasional rain, cold wind from the WNW, the state of the river (more bends and slower current north of the Platte, the banks lined mostly with cottonwoods now, many of them ravaged and broken by a storm of sometime in the recent past), and the day's provisions (some huge catfish and jerked meat from Drouillard's fresh kills) than we are told about any particular person.\n\nAnd so it goes for the remainder of the \"Willard Expedition.\" For the rest of the journey he sporadically appears in tantalizing shards of information—the DNA of a fuller story, suggesting (but only suggesting) the unique quality of one man's unforgettable experience—and through him a better knowledge of the larger organism known as the Corps of Discovery. He appears, then just as quickly disappears, leaving us to fill in the blanks or connect the dots.\n\nAnd what dots there are to connect!\n\n∙14 SEPTEMBER 1804. Willard accompanies Clark in a vain attempt to locate a volcano (a volcano!) rumored to exist somewhere nearby (they are in South Dakota); along the way Clark kills their first antelope, an animal unknown to science at the time, and Willard hauls it back.\n\n∙WINTER, 1804–1805. Willard and John Shields become indispensable to the expedition's survival by trading their blacksmithing work for corn and meat from the Mandans.\n\n∙18 JUNE 1805. Dispatched to bring in a load of freshly killed buffalo meat during the portage of the Great Falls. Willard is attacked and nearly caught by a grizzty bear, which chases him to within forty yards of the camp.\n\n∙15 AUGUST 1805. Clark names a creek in southwestern Montana \"Willard's Creek.\" (A special moment of pride, perhaps'? Or even less than a matter-of-fact occurrence, since during the preceding four months so many other creeks had been named for other expedition members?)\n\n∙18 SEPTEMBER 1805. During the terrible ordeal in the Bitterroot Mountains, Willard's \"negligence\" (Lewis's words) causes a delay in the morning's start: his unattended horse is missing. Lewis sends Willard back to find the horse and marches off with everyone else. Late in the afternoon Willard finalty catches up with the expedition, without the horse.\n\n∙10 FEBRUARY 1806. Willard returns to Fort Clatsop from the salt works on the seashore with a serious injury. While butchering some elk he had killed, he \"had cut his knee very badly with his tommahawk,\" according to Lewis.\n\n∙20 FEBRUARY 1806. Like a number of the other men, Willard is reported sick: \"a high fever and complains of the pain in his head and want of appetite,\" writes Lewis, who treats him with \"Scott's pills\" the next day. On 27 February he is still reported as \"very unwell;\" on 8 March he is \"yet complaining and is low Spirited;\" on 20 March, \"remain[s] weak;\" and on 21 March still does \"not seem to recover\" and now taken by a \"violent pain in his leg and thye.\" Not until 29 March, nearly a week after the expedition has departed for home from Fort Clatsop, is Willard considered \"quit well\" by his captains.\n\n∙19 APRIL 1806. Halfway up the Columbia River, near the Dalles of Oregon, Willard once more allows his horse to wander off. \"I repremanded him more severely for this peice of negligence than had been usual with me,\" a piqued Lewis writes. (Can words sting as much as a physical tashing?) But by 9 May, back with the Nez Percés, Willard has apparently regained his captain's confidence and is sent with Chief Twisted Hair to retrieve the expedition's large horse herd (which the Indians had kept over the winter). By the end of May it appears that Willard is one of the few privates entrusted with the all-important trade for food going on with the Nez Percés.\n\n∙4 AUGUST 1806. In eastern Montana, where Willard has once more become one of the regular hunters, he and Ordway kill two deer and a large grizzly (revenge from the near-death experience of a year earlier?) and set out in their canoe to catch up with the others. Darkness falls but they decide to continue down the Missouri by moonlight, only to be pushed by the current into a thick tangle of driftwood, which knocks Willard into the rushing water. As Ordway frantically maneuvers the dugout to safety, Willard clings to a limb. Somehow he grabs two small logs, ties them together, places his clothes on them, and then floats with them about a mile downstream and finally to shore. \"It was fortunate for Willard,\" Lewis writes of the accident, that, unlike many of the other men on the expedition, \"he could swim tolerably well.\"\n\n∙28 AUGUST 1806. In South Dakota Willard is among a small group dispatched by Clark to kill an antelope so its skeleton and skin can be preserved for President Jefferson (others are sent out for prairie dogs and magpies). On the 29 August he returns empty-handed, but tells Clark he did manage to measure the White River a few miles upstream from its mouth: two feet deep, two hundred yards wide. His method of measurement: wading.\n\n∙30 AUGUST 1806. Just before midnight a violent thunderstorm erupts, whipping up such ferocious winds and waves that the men are ordered to hold onto the canoes to prevent them from being blown off the sandbar where the expedition is encamped. Two canoes that had been lashed together nonetheless break loose–with Willard and Private Peter Weiser in them, powerless to do anything but hang on for dear life–and are blown across the river. Ordway and six men set out in the small pirogue to effect a rescue. By 2:00 A.M., during a lull in the storm, they all finally make it back to camp, where it rains until daylight, leaving everyone, in Clark's words, \"wet and disagreeable.\"\n\nWith that notation Willard exits from the journals forever. What a pity because, as this brief outline suggests, The Adventures of Private Alexander Hamilton Willard would have been an epic in itself, if only he could be brought back to life to tell it in detail from his own point of view. Part Pilgrim's Progress, complete with valuable lessons learned on the road, and part Perils of Pauline, full of close calls and comic mishaps, it would also add immeasurable depth to the larger story of the Corps of Discovery. If fully fleshed out, Willard's tale–of a lowly and sometimes hapless private who suffered lashings, injuries, illnesses, and accidents, yet persevered to earn his commanders' trust and his nation's thanks–would humanize the expedition in a way that the existing accounts never will.\n\nLacking that, the mere outline of Willard's journey (and of everyone else's brought forth in this book) at the very least demands that we resist the temptation to think of \"the men\" of the Lewis and Clark expedition only in passing or predominantly as a single entity. So far as is possible at this late date, they should be remembered in the way their captains thought of them and in the way they knew each other: as distinct and fallible human beings. In realizing their individuality, the key to their success–their unity–appears even more remarkable. By admitting their fallibility their heroic achievement becomes that much more inspiring.\n\nAlexander Willard lived to the ripe old age of eighty-seven—long enough to serve his country several times more (as a government blacksmith for the Sauk, Fox, Delaware, and Shawnee Indians, and in the War of 1812); long enough to marry and raise twelve children (one given the name Lewis, another Clark); long enough to be alive during the invention of photography and have his picture taken, his back proud and erect, his eyes confidently fixed straight ahead; long enough to play his part in yet another national transcontinental endeavor, the covered wagon migrations to the gold fields of California, where he died in 1865. [2]\n\nThere is a faint suspicion that he did, in fact, keep a journal during his expedition with Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery. Certainly he must have told and retold his adventures to his children and grandchildren in the many years that followed. How I wish that journal could be found in someone's attic or that one of Willard's descendants had transcribed his reminiscences. [3]\n\nBut even if such accounts were miraculously discovered, I doubt they would settle a question which, in the absence of conclusive facts to the contrary, I've decided to believe about Alexander Willard. I believe he was asleep during night guard duty back on Camp New Island in 1804 And I think I know how Sergeant Ordway discovered him and then knew immediately that Willard was both lying down and sleeping. He was snoring.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Lewis and Clark Expedition to the Pacific and return by way of the Missouri River in 1804-1806 was probably the best written and officially documented of all such governmental undertakings. Certainly its captains and several of its members made copious mention in their journals of the daily travels and notable sights encountered along the way. We have complete records of the material and supplies carried, details of the boats and medicines taken, and full reports on the Indians and strange animals and plants discovered. But a complete roster of all the men who set out with the expedition was never made. [1]\n\nUnfortunately, they omitted to mention much about themselves in their journals, for they were innocently unaware that they were creating history. True, the captains do mention a member now and then, but that is about all. They were certainly convinced that no biographical data was necessary, for this was a military command.\n\nAfter the expedition successfully returned in 1806, there was a long delay before the publication of their journals in 1814. [2] The War of 1812 occupied the nation's attention, and for a long lapse of years the members of the expedition were forgotten.\n\nThe purpose of this study is an attempt to bring these men into being again and to rescue them from oblivion so far as is possible at this late date. Therefore, it is not the purpose here to discuss the reasons that brought the Lewis and Clark Expedition into being. However, I think it pertinent to recall that an investigation of what lay beyond the Mississippi had for many years been in Thomas Jefferson's mind.\n\nAt least two of his previous plans to cross the continent — that of John Ledyard and Andrew Michaux — had come to naught. Jefferson knew of the recently published account of Alexander Mackenzie's journal which contained a detailed plan of how Great Britain might set up posts at the mouth of the Columbia River, and at other suitable ports. These were to control the ever increasing numbers of American ships that were then dominating the sea-otter trade to the Orient. These plans also included control of the fur trade and fisheries of that part of Western America.\n\nThese international schemes were plain to Jefferson, and they had to be averted before they became permanently established. The United States had a claim to the Oregon country because Captain Robert Gray was the first to discover and enter the mouth of the Columbia River in 1792. This claim could be strengthened by an overland expedition to, and exploration of, the lands bordering the upper waters of the Columbia — and by descending that river to the sea.\n\nIn the winter of 1802, Jefferson instructed his private secretary, Meriwether Lewis, who was skilled at frontier living and who had recently served in several campaigns with the army, to study botany, zoology, medicine, and celestial navigation in preparation for leading an expedition to the Pacific.\n\nIn a secret appeal to Congress on January 18, 1803, the sum of \"Twenty-five Hundred Dollars\" was appropriated for \"An intelligent officer with ten or twelve chosen men, fit for the enterprise and willing to undertake it, taken from our military posts, where they may be spared without inconvenience, might explore the whole line, even to the Western Ocean.\" To further cinch the argument, Jefferson mentioned that \"The soldiers pay would be going on, whether here or there\" and that \"the appropriation of Twenty-five Hundred Dollars for the purpose of extending the external commerce of the United States — would cover the undertaking.\" [3] In the light of recent study, it appears that Congress was privy to an understanding, not openly admitted, of the \"official\" request for appropriations. In early 1803, the jealousies of England, France, and Spain were not to be aroused by a large military party snooping around in disputed domains. Furthermore, the influential fur trading companies did not look with favor on this constant probing into their lands. The inevitable settlement which followed was contrary to the source of their income.\n\nBut before the year 1803 was finished, it became evident that such a small party as ten or twelve men could never overcome the Indians who zealously contested the passage to the upper Missouri River. The British traders already in that country did not desire competition from traders coming up the Missouri from the south, and they did all in their power to prevent it.\n\nIn the fall of 1803, Captain Lewis was firmly convinced by Auguste Chouteau, Manuel Lisa and other experienced traders, who had for many years been familiar with the lower Missouri — that a stronger, and hence, larger party, would be necessary to command respect, and safe traverse of the Missouri waters.\n\nCaptain Lewis kept Jefferson advised of these developments, and the latter adroitly managed the additional funds required. Historians may never learn how this was done, but the fact remains that it was. To help matters, he had as we say today, \"something special going for him\" in 1803. Louisiana, which in those days was about all the lands west of the Mississippi to the western mountains (wherever they were), changed hands from Spain to France to the United States in that year. That transaction removed some of the sticky diplomatic difficulties, although Spain remained convinced that the Lewis and Clark party really intended to take over the Spanish establishments. Spain actually sent out from Santa Fe in 1804 an overland expedition to cut Lewis and Clark off. [4] Fortunately it could not find them.\n\nDuring the summer and fall of 1803, Lewis and his coleader, William Clark, were recruiting and testing men as possible prospects for the rigorous adventures that lay ahead. While the men were selected with great care, Captain Lewis was authorized to offer the following inducements to those enlisting: [5]\n\nFIRST: The bounty (if not a soldier) but in both cases, six months pay in advance. Pay of $10.00 per month, plus clothing and subsistence\n\nSECOND: To discharge them from service if they wish it, immediately on their return from the expedition, giving them their arrears of pay, clothing, etc.\n\nTHIRD : To secure to them a portion of land equal to that given by the United States to the officers and soldiers who served in the Revolutionary War.\n\nCaptain Lewis was authorized to select by voluntary engagement, men from the companies of Captains Russell and Daniel Bissell, and of Captain Amos Stoddard now occupying the posts of Fort Massac and Fort Kaskaskia. Captain Lewis was also authorized to engage any other men, not soldiers, whom he thought useful in promoting the objects or success of the expedition. They were to recruit \"some good hunters; stout, healthy, unmarried men, accustomed to the woods, and capable of bearing bodily fatigues to a considerable degree. The hunters were to be engaged with the understanding that they were to bear the common labor of the party and not to engage in hunting exclusively.\"\n\nWith William Clark's agreement to join Captain Lewis in the expedition, Clark was furnished with these instructions, and Lewis advised him to be on the lookout for suitable men. Several young gentlemen's sons applied to Clark, but as he felt they were not accustomed to labor, he had to diplomatically offer them no encouragement. He did temporarily engage some men who later became known as \"The nine young men from Kentucky.\"\n\nMajor William MacRae, Commandant at South West Point, Kentucky, was instructed to send six or eight soldiers as likely candidates from Tennessee to Fort Massac to await Captain Lewis's arrival.\n\nWith this help and inducements, Captain Lewis wrote Clark on September 28, 1803, that he felt \"we shall be able to form our party without much difficulty; four or five French water-men I conceive will be essential, this we can do I presume very readily at St. Louis.\" In the same letter Lewis wrote, \"I have two young men with me whom I have taken on trial and not yet engaged them, but conditionally only, though I think they will answer tolerably well.\" [6]\n\nThus when Captain Lewis came down the Ohio River and was joined by Clark at Louisville, some twelve temporary recruits also came along. At Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; in Kentucky, and at the frontier military posts of Fort Massac, Vincennes and Kaskaskia, other volunteers were recruited and transferred to Lewis and Clark's command.\n\nThey formed a camp at Wood River (Camp du Bois) in Illinois, which in 1803 was about opposite the mouth of the Missouri River. [7] This location was not too far from St. Louis, but sufficiently removed from its wine shops and women, and, most importantly, was not in Spanish territory. Here during the winter and spring, Captain Clark and Sergeant Ordway observed and drilled the men who had been chosen thus far. All of them had been selected for their special talents and experiences as backwoods men. All were of a resourceful nature, and a few, such as one Mr. Leakins, who were overly resourceful, were rejected as being too undisciplined to serve under a military command.\n\nDuring the cold winter the men built huts, hunted deer, rabbits, racoons and turkeys for their sustenance. They had to build a sled in order to haul in enough firewood. Compatibility was established, and a pattern of camp life was begun which would prevail over the next two years.\n\nWhiskey peddlers soon found the camp, which caused some trouble. Discipline had to be enforced. Court-martial rules were set up for dealing with the red-blooded, rugged recruits who were frequently drunk. It is worthy of note that some of the men who later turned out to be the most valuable men of the party, were among those who had to be punished while at Camp Woods, as the following orders will show:\n\nDETACHMENT ORDERS\n\nThe Commanding officer feels himself mortified and disappointed at the disorderly conduct of Reubin Fields in refusing to mount guard when in the due roteen of duty he was regularly warned; nor is he less surprised at the want of discretion in those who urged his opposition to the faithful discharge of his duty, particularly (John) Shields, whose sense of propryety he had every reason to believe would have induced him rather to have promoted good order, than to have excited disorder and faction among the party, particularly in the absence of Capt. Clark and himself.\n\nThe Commanding officer is also sorry to find any man, who has been engaged by himself and Capt. Clark for the expedition on which they have entered, so destitute of understanding, as not to be able to draw the distinction between being placed under the command of another officer, whose will in such case would be their law, and that of obeying the orders of Capt. Clark and himself communicated to them through Sergt. Ordway, who, as one of the party, has during their necessary absence been charged with the execution of their orders; acting from those orders expressly, and not from his own caprice, and who, is in all respects accountable to us for the faithful observance of the same.\n\nA moments reflection must convince every man of our party, that were we to neglect the more important and necessary arrangements in relation to the voyage we are now entering on, for the purpose merely of remaining at camp in order to communicate our orders in person to the individuals of the party on mere points of policy, they would have too much reason to complain; nay, even to fear the ultimate success of the enterprise in which we are all embarked. The abuse of some of the party in respect with privilege heretofore granted them of going into the country, is not less displeasing; to such therefore as have made hunting or other business a pretext to cover their design of visiting a neighboring Whiskey shop, he cannot for the present extend this privilege; and does therefore most positively direct that Colter, Bolye, Wiser and Robinson do not receive permission to leave camp under any pretext whatever for ten days, after this order is read on the parade, unless otherwise directed hereafter by Capt. Clark or himself. The Commanding officers highly approve of the conduct of Sergt. Ordway. The Carpenters, Blacksmiths, and in short the whole party (except Floyd, who has been specially directed to perform other duties) are to obey implicity the orders of Sergt. Ordway, who has received our instructions and is held accountable to us for their due execution.\n\nMERIWETHER LEWIS,\n\nCapt. 1st U.S. Regt. Infty.\n\nComdg. Detatchment. [8]\n\nThis order obviously produced the desired effect, for we find all the men mentioned to be members of the party when it started out, and John Shields, Reuben Fields, John Colter and Peter Weiser became members of the permanent party that went on to the Pacific.\n\nCaptain Clark, as he was always recognized by the party, though when his commission arrived was only as a second lieutenant in the Artillery, spent most of the time at Camp Woods. He pondered the provisions needed for the expedition, the loading of the three boats, and gave considerable attention to those men who would be selected as permanent members who were to cross the continent, and to those which would comprise the extra force needed to get the equipment and provisions beyond the Indians who dominated the lower Missouri. Try as he would, the total number always came out to be around fifty men. In one of his notes he lists \"Our party: 2 Captains; 4 Sergeants; 3 interpreters; 22 Americans; 9 or 10 Frenchmen, and York, his slave. Plus 1 Corporal and 6 soldiers in a canoe with provisions for the party as far as these provisions last.\" [9] This totals 48 men if there were nine Frenchmen, or 49 if there were ten.\n\nThis is a point to remember when later the journalists all state the total number of the party consisted of only fortyfive men.\n\nGeorge Drouillard had been engaged to act as interpreter for the party. He was dispatched to Tennessee to recruit men, and he returned on December 16, 1803, with eight men. One was a blacksmith and another was a \"Housejoiner.\" Captain Clark wrote to Captain Lewis in St. Louis \"that he did not know how they will answer our experiment, but I am a little disappointed in finding them not possessed of more of the requisite qualifications. There is not a hunter among them. Drouillard nor myself have made no particular bargain with them. I have offered Drouillard $25.00 per month for as long as he may choose to continue with us.\"\n\nCaptain Lewis spent most of the time in St. Louis, procuring maps and every bit of information he could gather regarding the land and natives resident up river. Additional medicines and provisions for the voyage were obtained. He was advised that the best men for propelling the boats were those French-Canadian water-men who lived at Kaskaskia and Cahokia. These were villages on the Illinois side of the Mississippi near St. Louis where these boatmen resided when not off on some trading adventure up the Missouri or Mississippi rivers. With Mr. Chouteau's help, the most capable and reliable men were engaged to man the boats as far as the Mandan Nation. Lewis wrote Clark that \"Mr. Chouteau has procured seven engages to go as far as the Mandans but they will not agree to go further, and I found it impossible to reduce them to any other engagement than that usually made with these people.\" [10] Probably meaning that they would not enlist in a military organization.\n\nSome of these engages may have been former employees of the North West Company of Canada. John McDonnell, about the year 1795, wrote an account found in Masson's Les Bourgeois de la Compagnie du Nord-Ouest (vol. I, p. 272) : \"Many of the Company's servants (have been) deserting from the Mandan country with an intention of going to the Illinois and other places on the Mississippi. . .\" It is possible that \"La Liberte\" (Jo Barter), Joseph Collin and Jean Baptiste DeChamps were former members of the North West Company. Likewise, Francois Rivet, Paul Primeau, Peter Roi and others could have originated from that source, for the same, or variants of the name, appear in the rosters of the North West Company for the years just prior to the formation of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. See for example, above citation, pages 396–411.\n\nJohn Francis McDermott [11] reprints an apt description of the engage:\n\nThese men carried out the necessary work of the trade; cordelling, poling or rowing up the Missouri to operational headquarters, seeking out and trading with the Indian villages; trapping the beaver and other fur-bearers; hunting meat animals; maintaining the equipment, conveying the messages through the unknown country; cooking; keeping camp; tending horses; and performing a score of other regular and extra duties. Some of them were sons and grandsons of the men who had come up the Mississippi River from New Orleans with Laclede and Auguste Chouteau, and of this group some were native St. Lousians and many more came from the settlements such as Fort Chartres, Kaskaskia, Cahokia and St. Genevieve.\n\nThe number of men now deemed necessary was a considerable advance over that understood by Congress. In view of this situation, there could possibly have been an understanding with President Jefferson that the \"official\" figure would be acceptable if the total number did not exceed forty-five, including the two captains. This could be one of the reasons that no complete roster was compiled by the captains at the outset of the expedition.\n\nAt any rate, all those who kept journals — Lewis, Clark, Gass, Ordway, Floyd, and Whitehouse — dutifully record that the total number was about forty-five men. They do not all agree on the number, but none exceeds forty-five.\n\nSo for over a hundred and fifty years this number has been accepted. As the names of the entire roster had never been published, no one seemed to question it. Of course, the names of the thirty men who had gone on to the Pacific were known and recorded in the journals, but what of those twenty or so who had helped the party up to the Mandan villages, had wintered there, and had returned to St. Louis in the early summer of 1805? They brought back the maps and reports that had been made thus far, as well as many crates of new animal, mineral and botanical specimens. They saw to it that all this material was dispatched to Jefferson in Washington, and several of them conducted those Indians who had been prevailed upon to visit the Great White Father, and had acted as interpreters between them and President Jefferson. All this was part and plan of the expedition from its original conception.\n\nTo many students of the expedition, these men were important to the success of the enterprise. It has since been felt that more should be known of the entire party— just who they were — and as much biographical information should be collected as is possible.\n\nAs the journals were studied, it also became evident that more men returned from the expedition than the forty-five that were stated to have gone at its start.\n\nIn the December 1944, issue of the Oregon Historical Quarterly, [12] I submitted a roster and made the suggestion that the number should be forty-seven including the captains. I presented a list of forty-five, plus additional names that merited consideration. At that time I felt it presumptuous for a mere student to fly into the face of the scholars and historians who had edited the journals. Since 1944, much new material has been published which substantiates, and even elaborates on that thinking.\n\nIn 1964, The Field Notes of William Clark , 1803–1804, edited by Ernest S. Osgood, were published by the Yale University Press. The Letters of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, with Related Documents 1783–1854, edited by Donald Jackson, were published in 1962 by the University of Illinois Press. Each adds bits of additional information regarding the personnel. It now appears that Captain Clark was right when he noted a party of about fifty men.\n\nBut even if we accept this new figure, we are still far from an easy solution as to the names of the men, for the captains, especially Clark, had a charming disregard for the accuracy of spelling. When it came to proper names, almost any combination of letters seemed to suffice. Take the name of Corporal Richard Warfington for example. We find it rendered Warfington, Worthington, Worbington, Worthyton and even more exotic variations. George Drouillard was nearly always Drewyer . But those are the easy ones. In another case we have Carrn, Carr, Cane or Cann, all apparently meant to represent one person. I need not here show what happened to the spelling of the French names. That will be found in the roster.\n\nAs though this were not problem enough, we also have those who, following the success of the expedition, attempted to climb on the band-wagon and publicly claim that they had been members of the party. There are many examples, of which it is sufficient to cite only one:\n\nBenjamin Jones was a noted hunter, trapper and surveyor of early times in Missouri. His father was an Englishman who settled in Virginia at an early date. He had two sons, Lewis and Benjamin. The latter ran away from home when he was sixteen years of age, and came to St. Louis, where he joined the Indians and engaged in trapping, until Lewis and Clark started on their expedition, when he joined their party in the capacity of a scout. Before the expedition reached the Pacific Ocean, he and one or two others were sent back to St. Louis with dispatches. They fell into an Indian ambuscade, lost their horses, and had to perform the journey on foot, which occupied six months but they arrived safely and delivered the dispatches. [13]\n\nNow the first part of this notice could be true, for this Benjamin Jones was on the Missouri in 1809–1810, and was a hunter with the government service on the Santa Fe trail in 1825. But we find no other documented mention of where Jones was ever a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.\n\nThe student can only sift these momentarily exciting bits of data, and present those which seem to contain honest paydirt. My roster which follows, has been compiled from the researchers who were on the scene some sixty-five years ago, such as Reuben G. Thwaites, Elliott Coues, Eva Emery Dye, [14] Olin D. Wheeler, [15] James K. Hosmer [16] and others. They all gave an account of the men, as far as they knew at the time. In addition we have the works of Bradbury, [17] Brackenridge, [18] Henry, [19] and others who lived in, and wrote of the days when some of these men were still living. Army records and considerable genealogical research have also added details for a more complete picture. I have used them all as sources in compiling my roster.\n\nProbably not all historians and researchers will ever agree on exactly which men actually started out with Lewis and Clark. A few of the French engages seem to have disappeared from the records, so further data on them is completely lacking. Just when a solution seems to be reached, a new name will crop up. For example, we find a new one in The Field Notes of William Clark previously mentioned. On page 244 of that work we find in a tentative list of engages, a very legible \"E. Cann\" written in someone's hand. It is interesting to note in the same reproduction of the original document that two of the engages' names are joined together in one: William Labiece Mallat. These are surely William Labiche and Etienne Malboeuf. On page 278 Cann is written out in what appears to my perhaps prejudiced eye as \"Carn,\" though on page 118 Dr. Osgood deciphers the word as \"Cane.\" In all my many years of study and research \"Cann\" and \"Cane\" are new names to me. To my knowledge none of the journals, nor the vast literature of the fur trade which followed the expedition, even suggests this name.\n\nOn the other hand, one of the spellings in the original journals under date of August 13, 1804, is Carrn. In the Field Notes, page 48, there is the word Carseux written over an entry. This is not singular, for on the entry for July 5, 1804, we find the name of Howard — one of the members — written over it. In The Territorial Papers of the United States, [20] under date of December 28, 1805, we find that Alexander Carson, along with Manuel Lisa, Joseph Robidoux, Pierre Chouteau, John Carson, John Robertson and hundreds of others, were signers of a memorial attesting to the good conduct of Governor Wilkinson. John Bradbury [21] states that Alexander Carson was near the head of the Missouri in 1807–1808. In 1809 Alexander Carson was engaged by William Clark — as were also a few other former members of the expedition, to try to return the Mandan chief, Shahaka, back to his home on the upper Missouri. In a letter in the collection of the Oregon Historical Society we learn: [22]\n\n[James W. Nesmith, Indian Commissioner]\n\nDear Sir:\n\n. . .You desire to know the particulars of the murder of Alexander Carson, a Virginian (I think) who was murdered in April, or May, 1836, at a place called Ellick's [Alec's] Butte, about six miles north of Lafayette, Yam Hill County, by an Indian, who was called Boney, of the Nefalitin Tribe.\n\nThis Boney had been in Carson's employ for several years, trapping, and had always been treated with the utmost kindness and regard, by Carson, he had great confidence in the Indian.\n\nWhatever led to the crime, is more than anyone knows. Carson had been stopping at my house two or three weeks, this Boney, his wife, and son with him. Carson was sick. When he thought he was able to travel, left my house accompanied by Boney, Boney's wife and son. The first night after leaving my house (he) camped at Ellick's Butte, the whole tribe camped there. Boney arose in the night, stole out of Carson's tent his (Carson's) rifle, which he held in reserve and holding up the curtain of the tent so that the light of the fire might shine on Carson, compelled his son (a lad of twelve or fourteen years) to shoot him in the head with a shot-gun, blowing his brains all over the tent.\n\nThe body was thrown in a small stream, and the plunder distributed out amongst the tribe. I may mention here an Indian by the name of Click-kowin who was said to be a half Killamook, and was with the Killamooks a portion of his time, was accessory to the murder, and shared in the plunder.\n\nBoney, and his son, died soon after the murder was committed, and Click-kowin was shot after the murder, by Waaninkapah, the Chief of the Nefalitin tribe.\n\nThose Indians have never atoned for the crime, they were compelled to give up a portion of the plunder which was delivered over to William Cannin, a cousin of Carsons. Boney's son confessed the crime and went with us and showed where all the plunder had been cached, as far as he knew of.\n\nCarson came out to the Mountains with Lewis & Clark and after returning to the States, engaged with Hunt in 1811 and returned to this country, and remained here.\n\nYours in haste,\n\nT. J. HUBBARD.\n\nI quote this letter in full, except for some irrelevant matter at the opening, because Alexander Carson, along with Joseph Collins, Charles Hebert, Charles Caugee and \"Rokey,\" have no official record of any wages paid for service. Heretofore, historians have questioned that they were members of the expedition.\n\nAs I have shown above, Lewis was authorized to hire, rather than enlist, extra men, which he apparently did and paid some of them off at Fort Mandan in the spring of 1805. Note the entry under date of August 22, 1806, where we read:\n\nAt this nation we found Rokey who was one of our engagés as high as the Mandans. This man had spent all his wages and requested to return with us. We agreed to give him passage down [to St. Louis]. [23]\n\nThis would seem to be proof that a few of the men were not enlisted, but were hired for the trip up the Missouri only, and were paid wages out of funds in hand. The others were paid by Captain Amos Stoddard, Capt. Lewis's agent in St. Louis. For this reason they do not appear on the muster rolls and were not entitled to extra pay and land warrants as the enlisted men later were. This may also be a reason why the journalists list only forty-five men, for they might not have considered the hired, extra men as technically a part of the expedition.\n\nIn the revised Private Joseph Whitehouse Journal, as yet unpublished, there is found a partial list of the members who set out and adds \"8 Canadians who were only to proceed with us to the Mandans.\"\n\nAlexander Carson could have been one of these extra men, for with the evidence I have shown, and the entry in the journals for August 18, 1804, [24] where it is stated: \"Detached Sgt. Oderway, Peter Crusatt, George Shannon, Werner and Carrn to the Mahar Village with a flag. . .\" [italics mine], we know that such a man was with the expedition. Thwaites appears to have had some evidence, for on page 109 he notes after the word Carrn \"(Carson– editor).\"\n\nThe above evidence, while not conclusive, is the best we have at present. However, I believe it is strong enough that Alexander Carson should be considered as one of the party until such time as we have positive contrary evidence.\n\nIn connection with these \"alleged members,\" it may be of interest to report a sidelight that is of record. As shown, the previously mentioned Alexander Carson, in his last years, was living in the Willamette Valley in Oregon. A companion of his trapping days, William Canning, was living on a farm nearby. William Canning was a bona fide mountain man, and had been with Wilson P. Hunt's Astorian party of 1810. [25] When Charles Wilkes, U.S.N., wrote of his Oregon explorations of 1841 [26] he stated:\n\nAt Champoeg, Willamette Valley, was an old man by the name of Cannon [there goes that spelling again — author] who had been one of the party with Lewis and Clark, and from his own account, the only remaining one in the country. . .\n\nNow Canning should have been aware that Francois Rivet, who was a member of the party as far as the Mandans, was living on a farm nearby. We can forgive him that he may not have known that Patrick Gass was living in West Virginia at the time. But he may just be bragging about himself. Mountain men had a bad habit of doing that.\n\nWilkes of course did not mention the fact that Alexander Carson had, in 1829, made a will in favor of Canning, and that after Carson had been murdered in 1836, Canning had claimed from the Hudson's Bay Company, the balance of accounts that were due Carson. [27] It appears that in his relation to Wilkes, Canning was also trying to claim Carson's role as a Lewis and Clark member.\n\nThere is ample documentary evidence to show that Carson and Canning were two different men. It is tempting to speculate that Captain Clark could have been referring to Canning when he rendered the name as Cann and Cane. But it is difficult to imagine that the clearly legible E. of E. Cann could be taken to mean an initial for William. \"G\" for the French spelling of William perhaps, but hardly an \"E\". We have already seen that Ellick is one of the spellings, along with Alec., as a nickname for Alexander.\n\nIn any event, neither Canning, Cannin, nor Cannon is ever mentioned in conection with Lewis and Clark until Wilkes quotes him in 1845.\n\nI have given all this Carson material as a typical example of the research done to arrive at the most complete and correct roster possible. In an attempt to gather further information, I appended additional data to my 1944 roster, and it was published in the DAR Magazine for November, 1965. [28] The idea for submitting the story to that magazine was to solicit the aid of the members of the DAR who may be descended from some of these men, and who would furnish genealogical information. I am happy to acknowledge that quite a bit of new information has been acquired, and is collected here for the first time. In no case have I used \"family tradition,\" but only include data that is fully documented. I am particularly pleased that some of the members who heretofore have had the notation after their names — \"Nothing more known of him\" — have been rescued from oblivion.\n\nBy the time the winter of 1803 had passed into the spring of 1804, Captain Clark had decided on which of the men would be taken along on the expedition. Many of them had been transferred from their former military units as of January 1, 1804, onto the muster rolls of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Later, some of the French water-men had been enlisted, but others were hired as extra hands. The provisions and Indian trade goods were divided so that some of each were placed in separate boxes in order that all would not be lost in case of accident. The air gun was mounted on the keel-boat and the arms checked and put in order. The powder was contained in cannisters of lead which could later be melted and molded into bullets when the cannisters were empty. A hundred other details had to be thought out and arranged, for once the expedition set out, no other supplies could be obtained in the frontier country into which they were going.\n\nAt long last, spring arrived, and the Missouri was showing signs of becoming navigable. Captain Lewis was in St. Louis winding up the many last minute details, including a conference with a delegation of Osage Indians. George Drouillard was with him most of the time.\n\nCaptain Clark, at Camp Woods (Camp du Bois) :\n\n. . determined to go as far as St. Charles, a french Village 7 Leags. up the Missourie, and wait at that place untill Capt. Lewis could finish the business in which he was obliged to attend to at St. Louis and join me by Land from that place 24 miles; by this movement I calculated that if any alterations in the loading of the Vestles or other Changes necessary, that they might be made at St. Charles. [29]\n\nSo at 4 o'clock on the afternoon of May 14, 1804, the shake-down cruise began. They easily could have made St. Charles in one day, but Captain Clark took all of two, for there was no hurry, and much had to be learned about the men, the boats, and the loading. They soon found out that the keel-boat was too heavily loaded in the stern. On the nights of the 14th and 15th, they camped along the river, for this presented an opportunity to test the arrangement of the men into messes, or groups, where each prepared its own meals. This pre-arrangement was continued until May 26th of the voyage when a few changes were made. On the 16th of May, the party arrived at St. Charles, where, during the following four days, the cargoes were reloaded. On the 19th, Drouillard came over from St. Louis with $99.00 which was apparently used to purchase supplies which Clark thought necessary. [30]\n\nCaptain Clark had warned the members :\n\nThat they should act with true respect for their own dignity, and not make it necessary for him to leave the comforts of the town for a more retired situation [31]\n\nNevertheless, William Werner, Hugh Hall and John Collins went absent-without-leave, and furthermore, Collins behaved in an unbecoming manner at the ball, and after his return to the keel-boat, had uttered disrespectful statements in regard to the orders of Captain Clark. Clark had been over to Portage des Sioux to talk and trade with the Indians at that place, and the three men had taken advantage of his absence. This sort of behavior had to be stopped, so Captain Clark appointed a court-martial, headed by Sgt. John Ordway, with Reuben Fields, Richard Windsor, Joseph Whitehouse and John Potts as members. The court sentenced each of the culprits to receive twenty-five lashes on their bare-backs, but because of the former good conduct of Werner and Hall, they recommended mercy from Captain Clark. The punishment was remitted for them, but John Collins received his punishment at sunset that evening.\n\nOn Sunday, May 20th, the men were given leave to enjoy themselves and to hear a sermon at the Catholic Church on Main Street. That afternoon at six-thirty, Captain Lewis arrived from St. Louis with a group of friends to help send the expedition off. He was accompanied by Capt. Amos Stoddard (who was to act as his agent while he was away), Lt. Clarence Mulford, Lt. Stephen Worrall and the Messrs. Auguste Chouteau, Charles Gratiot, David Delaunay, Sylvestre Labadie, James Rankin and Doctor Antoine Francois Saugrain. Captain Lewis made some additional purchases such as sugar, and castor-oil was obtained from Doctors Jeremiah and Seth Millington. These were two American doctors who had arrived in St. Charles in January 1799 and were now raising medicinal plants on their farms located above the town. [32]\n\nThe gentlemen of the village gave a banquet and a ball for the party. It was the last taste of civilization before their departure. The next day, May 21, 1804, the orders were given for departure, and despite the rain, a farewell parade was given. The band played all the way down the mile long main street fronting the Missouri River, and there was singing and fiddle playing.33 [33] By four o'clock all the men were aboard who were to sail at the time, and the expedition left St. Charles under a salute and three cheers from the dignitaries and citizens. In honor of their warm hospitality, three cheers were returned and three guns were fired from the boats as a salute. Under the joint command of Captains Lewis and Clark, the expedition officially started up the Missouri.\n\nSince that fateful day some one hundred and sixty years ago when the expedition faded off into the dim distance, the following facts have been gathered about the men who comprised it, and who set off on this historic voyage of exploration."
