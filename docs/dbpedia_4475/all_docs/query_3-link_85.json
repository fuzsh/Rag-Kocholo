        "text": "Remember the Walloon Settlers? The contribution to New York’s history made by Eugene G. Putnam? Conrad Poppenhusen ring a bell?\n\nWas that no, no and no?\n\nAnd yet, each of them is memorialized somewhere in this city, their mark on history etched in bronze and granite.\n\nThere are about 800 monuments on city parkland in the five boroughs, scattered along rambling paths, grassy triangles and slender medians. They loom over passing pedestrians and cast a weary eye on gridlocked traffic — often somber, sometimes whimsical, frequently ignored, as the household names of past decades and centuries slip into obscurity.\n\nWhat exactly constitutes a monument is not cut in stone, so to speak.\n\n“A monument can be an artwork, but it doesn’t have to be,” explained Jonathan Kuhn, the parks department’s director of art and antiquities. “It has to perpetuate memory and have a commemorative function. It’s everything from a marker in the ground to the triumphal arch in Washington Square Park.”\n\nSo many monuments were erected on city parkland over the years that a half-dozen parks, starting in the 1970s, have had unofficial moratoriums on commemorative sculptures. Battery Park alone is home to 20 such tributes, among them the Walloon Settlers Monument (they were a group of Belgian Huguenot families who sailed for New Amsterdam in 1624), the Norwegian Veterans Monument, the John Wolfe Ambrose statue and the Wireless Operators Memorial.\n\nFrederick Law Olmsted, who designed Central Park in the 1850s with Calvert Vaux, detested memorials. He derided the monuments that were already pouring into the park as “incidents” and presciently bemoaned the inevitable anonymity that would come to cloak many of the people they honored.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
