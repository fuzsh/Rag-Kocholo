        "text": "Memorial Day weekend is a fitting time to wrap up our fourth special section on the 375th anniversary of Springfield, a community that has a long history of honoring those who served and died for their country.\n\nThe actual memorials, and there are many of them, are such a part of the everyday landscape most people don't even notice them. The biggest, at 1551-feet long and 82.5-feet wide, is the beautiful Memorial Bridge spanning the Connecticut River. Conceived during World War I, construction began in 1920 and it was opened to traffic in August of 1922.\n\nThe four large towers that are topped by a lighted globe each have a large bronze plaque at their base to memorialize those who fought and died since the inception of the settlement in 1636, up to World War I. When the bridge was reconstructed in 1996, a fifth plaque was added to honor members of the military from World War II, Korea, Vietnam, \"and other conflicts around the world.\"\n\nThe pillar on the west end of the north side of the bridge commemorates the sacrifices of the early settlers, those who died in the 1675 King Philip's War, and the various French and Indian Wars that lasted until 1763. The other tower on that side recognizes those who fought in the Revolution and Shay's Rebellion.\n\nOn the south side of the bridge is a tablet entitled \"War to preserve the Union.\" It honors the Civil War Regiments of the 10th, 27th, 31st, 34th, 37th, 46th, 52nd, and 57th. It makes special note of the fact the those who fought against each other in the Civil War fought side-by-side in Cuba in 1898.\n\nThe tablet closest to Springfield on the south side of the bridge memorializes both the Spanish American War and World War I. This final plaque, in the sequence of four, ends with the sentence... \"From the pioneers down though to the World War love of freedom linked the generations.\"\n\nOther monuments are scattered throughout the city, in cemeteries, some in neighborhoods others in parks and triangles, and some along the streets. One is on the site of a former golf course, now Memorial Industrial Park off Roosevelt Avenue.\n\nView Springfield War Memorials in a larger map\n\n\\"
