        "text": "The annual program commemorating the Battle of Fort Stevens is this Saturday (7/13) from 10 am to 4 pm. Its a fun event and worth stopping by even if its only for a few hours (Check out their Facebook event page for details). Of particular interest, this year includes Cannon Firing events (Fort Stevens Field) scheduled for 12 pm and 2 pm.\n\nThis year’s theme focuses on the summer 1864 campaigns: Jubal Early’s Raid on Washington, the Federal pursuit of Early culminating in the Battle of Cool Springs, and the 1864 Valley Campaign.\n\nBelow is the draft program, which give a good idea of the types of events and scheduled times.\n\nThe photo above was taken on July 22, 1934, at the statue of James Cardinal Gibbons located at 16th Street and Park Road (in front of Sacred Heart Church). The event commemorated the 100th anniversary of James Cardinal Gibbons’ birth. Reportedly, two thousand person packed the small triangular park where the statue is located, the church steps and lawns and the verandas of nearby houses to hear Maj. General Paul B. Malone’s address at the occasion and view laying of wreaths. At the conclusion of the ceremony, which lasted less than an hour, the base of the memorial was a mass of flowers.\n\nThe James Cardinal Gibbons Memorial Statue was authorized by Congress and President Calvin Coolidge on April 23, 1928. The piece was commissioned by the Knights of Columbus and cost, at no expense to the United States, $35,998. The piece was unveiled on August 14, 1932.\n\nThere were a number of events held yesterday in connection with the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day holiday, a day when we reflect on both the history of civil rights and the work still left to be accomplished — as well as a day of service.\n\nOne of the events held yesterday was a wreath laying ceremony at the African American Civil War Memorial located at Vermont Avenue and U Street here in Ward 1. The ceremony began shortly after 11 a.m. and included a prayer, followed by a few words by Frank Smith, Founding Executive Director of the African American Civil War Memorial (and former Ward 1 councilmember). The ceremony closed with those in attendance holding hands and singing We Shall Overcome.\n\nSmith’s address referenced his own role in the civil rights movement and work with Martin Luther King, Jr., and how it was a continuation of the work left undone despite the passage of the 15th amendment in 1870 — which granted African American men the right to vote. By the late 1870s, especially in the south, state and local laws created barriers that prevented African Americans from voting. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 aimed to remedy this.\n\n(Frank Smith with the Color Guard in prayer before Smith’s remarks.)\n\nWith this in mind, the wreath laying at the African American Civil War Memorial was humble in comparison to the debt owed to those who did their part so many years ago to help make the world a better place.\n\nBelow is a video of the ceremony."
