        "text": "Korean War Veterans Memorial, Washington D.C. (must see)\n\nThe Korean War Veterans Memorial stands in West Potomac Park within Washington, D.C. Its purpose is to pay tribute to all those who served during the Korean conflict. The United States provided assistance to South Korea when it was invaded by North Korea at the behest of the United Nations. The U.S. had divided opinions about the conflict, often referring to it as a \"conflict\" rather than a full-fledged war. The Korean War was a grueling battle that took place in extremely harsh conditions, with temperatures dropping to as low as -40Â°F during the Chosin Reservoir battle.\n\nThe memorial is designed in the shape of a triangle and is constructed using juniper and strips of concrete to mimic the rugged terrain of the battlefield. This triangular shape symbolizes the Field of Service. Within this landscape, you'll find 19 statues of soldiers dressed in military attire, their clothing appearing to be windblown, evoking memories of the brutal weather conditions endured. These soldier statues are crafted from stainless steel. On the south side of the memorial, there's a black granite wall that reflects the statues in such a way that it creates the illusion of a total of 38 soldiers, paying homage to the 38th parallel, which separates North Korea from South Korea.\n\nAt the end of the Field of Service, there's a triangular reflecting pool. Along the northern side, there's a low granite wall bearing the names of the 22 United Nations member countries that participated in the Korean War. The memorial is open for visitors around the clock, and park rangers are on hand from 8 a.m. to 12 a.m. daily, except for major holidays.\n\nWhy You Should Visit:\n\nThe company of soldiers depicted as moving through hostile terrain is a bit eerie and very lifelike, making this one of the most remarkable war memorials you'll ever see.\n\nTip:\n\nTruly better to visit after dark; the lighting is so very dramatic, you can almost hear the soldiers' boots sloshing through the mud.\n\nAdditionally, use your phone flashlight to look carefully at the black wall that has images of soldiers laser-etched onto the black surface."
