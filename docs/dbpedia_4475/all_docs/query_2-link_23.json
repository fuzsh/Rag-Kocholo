        "text": "Congress has bestowed on National Mall Liberty Fund DC the honor of establishing a memorial in Washington’s Monumental Core to tens of thousands of African American solders, sailors, marines, patriots and liberty seekers of the Revolutionary War.\n\nWe have shared the names of thousands of patriots with communities where they lived, from Connecticut and Massachusetts to North Carolina and New Orleans. This is part of a continuing effort to explore and explain the nation’s shared heritage and enduring principles.\n\nWe have examined over 40 sites and narrowed the search to three, with one showing the most promise because of its unobstructed sightlines to the Washington Monument. You are invited to follow the progress through a half dozen Federal approving agencies."
