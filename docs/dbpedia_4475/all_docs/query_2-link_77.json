        "text": "This is a list of Confederate monuments and memorials that were established as public displays and symbols of the Confederate States of America (CSA), Confederate leaders, or Confederate soldiers of the American Civil War. Part of the commemoration of the American Civil War, these symbols include monuments and statues, flags, holidays and other observances, and the names of schools, roads, parks, bridges, counties, cities, lakes, dams, military bases, and other public works.[1] Monuments and memorials are listed below alphabetically by state, and by city within each state. States not listed have no known qualifying items for the list. Cemeteries and museums are not included in this list.[2]\n\nFor monuments and memorials which have been removed, consult Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials. Some but by no means all are included below.\n\nThis list does not include the removal of figures connected with the origins of the Civil War but not with the Confederacy, including Supreme Court Justice Roger B. Taney in Annapolis, Baltimore, and Frederick, Maryland, and numerous memorials to Southern politician John C. Calhoun (commemorated on the Confederacy's 1¢ stamp). It also does not include post-Civil War white supremacists, such as North Carolina Governor Charles Aycock, some of whose monuments are also being removed.\n\nPage Template:Nonumtoc/styles.css has no content.Page Template:TOC limit/styles.css has no content.Page Template:Horizontal TOC/styles.css has no content.\n\nHistory[]\n\nMonument building and dedications[]\n\nA small number of memorializations were made during the war, mainly as ship and place names. After the war, Robert E. Lee said on several occasions that he was opposed to any monuments, as they would, in his opinion, \"keep open the sores of war\".[6] Nevertheless, monuments and memorials continued to be dedicated shortly after the American Civil War.[7][better source needed] Many more monuments were dedicated in the years after 1890, when Congress established the first National Military Park at Chickamauga and Chattanooga, and by the turn of the twentieth century, five battlefields from the Civil War had been preserved: Chickamauga-Chattanooga, Antietam, Gettysburg, Shiloh, and Vicksburg. At Vicksburg National Military Park, more than 95 percent of the park's monuments were erected in the first eighteen years after the park was established in 1899.[8] Memorials have been erected on public spaces (including on courthouse grounds) either at public expense or funded by private organizations and donors. Numerous private memorials have also been erected. Confederate monument-building has often been part of widespread campaigns to promote and justify Jim Crow laws in the South, and assert white supremacy.[4][5][9] According to the American Historical Association (AHA), the erection of Confederate monuments during the early twentieth century was \"part and parcel of the initiation of legally mandated segregation and widespread disenfranchisement across the South.\" According to the AHA, memorials to the Confederacy erected during this period \"were intended, in part, to obscure the terrorism required to overthrow Reconstruction, and to intimidate African Americans politically and isolate them from the mainstream of public life.\" A later wave of monument building coincided with the civil rights movement, and according to the AHA \"these symbols of white supremacy are still being invoked for similar purposes.\"[10]\n\nAccording to historian Jane Dailey from the University of Chicago, in many cases, the purpose of the monuments was not to celebrate the past but rather to promote a \"white supremacist future\".[3] Another historian, Karen Cox, from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, has written that the monuments are \"a legacy of the brutally racist Jim Crow era\", and that \"the whole point of Confederate monuments is to celebrate white supremacy\".[4] Another historian from UNC, James Leloudis, stated that \"The funders and backers of these monuments are very explicit that they are requiring a political education and a legitimacy for the Jim Crow era and the right of white men to rule.\"[11] They were erected without the consent or even input of Southern African-Americans, who remembered the Civil War far differently, and who had no interest in honoring those who fought to keep them enslaved.[12] According to Civil War historian Judith Giesberg, professor of history at Villanova University, \"White supremacy is really what these statues represent.\"[13] Some monuments were also meant to beautify cities as part of the City Beautiful movement, although this was secondary.[14]\n\nMany Confederate monuments were dedicated in the former Confederate states and border states in the decades following the Civil War, in many instances by Ladies Memorial Associations, United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC), United Confederate Veterans (UCV), Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV), the Heritage Preservation Association, and other memorial organizations.[15][16][17] Other Confederate monuments are located on Civil War battlefields. Many Confederate monuments are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, either separately or as contributing objects within listings of courthouses or historic districts. Art historians Cynthia Mills and Pamela Simpson argued, in Monuments to the Lost Cause, that the majority of Confederate monuments, of the type they define, were \"commissioned by white women, in hope of preserving a positive vision of antebellum life.\"[18][19]\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, technological innovations in the granite and bronze industries helped reduce costs and made monuments more affordable for small towns. Companies looking to capitalize on this opportunity often sold nearly identical copies of monuments to both the North and South.[20] Another wave of monument construction coincided with the Civil Rights Movement and the American Civil War Centennial.[21] At least thirty-two Confederate monuments were dedicated between 2000 and 2017, including at least 7 re-dedications.[22][23][24][25][26]\n\nScholarly studies of the monuments began in the 1980s. In 1983 John J. Winberry published a study which was based on data from the work of R.W. Widener.[27][28] He estimated that the main building period for monuments was from 1889 to 1929 and that of the monuments erected in courthouse squares over half were built between 1902 and 1912. He determined four main locations for monuments; battlefields, cemeteries, county courthouse grounds, and state capitol grounds. Over a third of the courthouse monuments were dedicated to the dead. The majority of the cemetery monuments in his study were built in the pre-1900 period, while most of the courthouse monuments were erected after 1900. Of the 666 monuments in his study 55% were of Confederate soldiers, while 28% were obelisks. Soldiers dominated courthouse grounds, while obelisks account for nearly half of cemetery monuments. The idea that the soldier statues always faced north was found to be untrue and that the soldiers usually faced the same direction as the courthouse. He noted that the monuments were \"remarkably diverse\" with \"only a few instances of repetition of inscriptions\".[28]\n\nHe categorized the monuments into four types. Type 1 was a Confederate soldier on a column with his weapon at parade rest, or weaponless and gazing into the distance. These accounted for approximately half the monuments studied. They are however the most popular among the courthouse monuments. Type 2 was a Confederate soldier on a column with rifle ready, or carrying a flag or bugle. Type 3 was an obelisk, often covered with drapery and bearing cannon balls or an urn. This type was 28% of the monuments studied, but 48% of the monuments in cemeteries and 18% of courthouse monuments. Type 4 was a miscellaneous group, including arches, standing stones, plaques, fountains, etc. These account for 17% of the monuments studied.[28]\n\nOver a third of the courthouse monuments were specifically dedicated to the Confederate dead. The first courthouse monument was erected in Bolivar, Tennessee, in 1867. By 1880 nine courthouse monuments had been erected. Winberry noted two centers of courthouse monuments; the Potomac counties of Virginia, from which the tradition spread to North Carolina, and a larger area covering Georgia, South Carolina and northern Florida. The diffusion of courthouse monuments was aided by organizations such as the United Confederate Veterans and their publications, though other factors may also have been effective.[28]\n\nWinberry listed four reasons for the shift from cemeteries to courthouses. First was the need to preserve the memory of the Confederate dead and also recognize the veterans who returned. Second was to celebrate the rebuilding of the south after the war. Third was the romanticizing of the Lost Cause, and the fourth was to unify the white population in a common heritage against the interests of African American southerners. He concluded \"No one of these four possible explanations for the Confederate monument is adequate or complete in itself. The monument is a symbol, but whether it was a memory of the past, a celebration of the present, or a portent of the future remains a difficult question to answer; monuments and symbols can be complicated and sometimes indecipherable.\"[28]\n\nRemoval[]\n\nAs of April 2017, at least 60 symbols of the Confederacy had been removed or renamed since 2015, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).[29] At the same time, laws in various states place restrictions on the removal of statutes and memorials and in some cases[which?] prohibit renaming of parks, roads, and schools.[30][31][32][33][34][35]\n\nA 2017 Reuters poll found that 54% of adults stated that the monuments should remain in all public spaces, and 27% said they should be removed, while 19% said they were unsure. The results were split along racial and political lines, with Republicans and whites preferring to keep the monuments in place, while Democrats and minorities preferring their removal.[36][37] A similar 2017 poll by HuffPost/YouGov found that one-third of respondents favored removal, while 49% were opposed.[38][39]\n\nDistribution[]\n\nGeographic dispersal[]\n\nConfederate monuments are widely distributed across the Southern United States.[28] The distribution pattern follows the general political boundaries of the Confederacy.[28] Of the more than 1503 public monuments and memorials to the Confederacy, more than 718 are monuments and statues. Nearly 300 monuments and statues are in Georgia, Virginia, or North Carolina. According to one researcher, \"the absence of monuments in eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina indicates those regions' Union sentiment, and the few monuments in Maryland, West Virginia, and Kentucky reflect those states' ambivalent war-time politics.\" The Northern States that remained part of the Union, as well as the Western States that were largely settled after the Civil War, have few or no memorials to the Confederacy.\n\nNational[]\n\nSee also: Civil War commemoration stamps and CSA-affinity license plates\n\nUnited States Capitol[]\n\nIn the National Statuary Hall Collection, in the United States Capitol, each state has provided statues of two citizens that the state wants to honor. The following Confederate figures are among them, many in Confederate Army uniforms.[40] Dates reflect when the statue was given to the collection:[41][42]\n\nRobert E. Lee (Virginia, 1909)[43]\n\nZebulon Baird Vance (North Carolina, 1916)[44]\n\nUriah M. Rose (Arkansas, 1917)[45]\n\nEdmund Kirby Smith (Florida, 1922). On March 19, 2018, the Governor of Florida signed legislation replacing Smith with African-American educator and Civil Rights advocate Mary McLeod Bethune.[46]\n\nJoseph Wheeler (Alabama, 1925)[47]\n\nAlexander Hamilton Stephens (Georgia, 1927)[48]\n\nWade Hampton III (South Carolina, 1929)[49]\n\nJefferson Davis (Mississippi, 1931)[50]\n\nJames Zachariah George (Mississippi, 1931)[51]\n\nJabez Lamar Monroe Curry (Alabama, 1908) was replaced by a statue of Helen Keller in 2009[52]\n\nPeace Monument, also known as the Naval Monument or Civil War Sailors Monument, stands on the grounds of the United States Capitol in Peace Circle at First Street, N.W., and Pennsylvania Avenue. Erected from 1877-1878 to commemorate the naval deaths at sea during the Civil War.\n\nCoins and stamps[]\n\nRobert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson were portrayed by the US Mint on the 1925 Commemorative silver US half dollar, along with the words \"Stone Mountain\". The coin was a fundraiser for the Stone Mountain monument, which honors the Confederate Generals. The authorized issue was 5 million coins, to be sold at $1 each, but that proved overly optimistic and only 1.3 million coins were released, many of which ended up in circulation after being spent for face value.[53] The caption on the reverse reads \"Memorial to the valor of the soldier of the South\".\n\nRobert E. Lee has been commemorated on at least five US postage stamps. One 1936–37 stamp featured Generals Lee and Stonewall Jackson with Lee's home Stratford Hall.[54][55]\n\nUS military[]\n\nBases[]\n\nThere are 10 major U.S. military bases named in honor of Confederate military leaders, all in former Confederate States.[5] In 2015 the Pentagon declared it would not be renaming these facilities,[56] and declined to make further comment in 2017.[57]\n\nFort Lee, Virginia (1917) named for CSA Gen.

Coski, the adoption of Alabama's flag coincided with the rise of Jim Crow laws and segregation,[74] as other former Confederate slave states, such as Mississippi and Florida, also adopted new state flags based off Confederate designs around the same time when those states instituted Jim Crow segregation laws themselves:[74]\n\nThe Governor's version of the State Flag includes St Andrew's Cross plus the State Coat of Arms with the Confederate Battle Flag inclusion and the military crest on the bottom.\n\nBuildings[]\n\nMontgomery: First White House of the Confederacy\n\nMonuments[]\n\nCourthouse monuments[]\n\nAshville: Confederate Soldiers of Ashville Monument, St. Clair County Courthouse (1923) by United Daughters of the Confederacy, (UDC) Ashville Chapter[76]\n\nAthens: Limestone County Confederate Soldiers Memorial, Limestone County Courthouse (1922) by United Confederate Veterans (UCV) and UDC[77]\n\nButler: Confederate Monument, Choctaw County Courthouse (1936) by UDC, Choctaw Ruffin Dragoon Chapter[78]\n\nCarrollton: Confederate War Memorial, Pickens County Courthouse (1927)[79]\n\nCentre: Confederate Memorial, Cherokee County Courthouse (1988) by SCV, Emma Sansom Camp No. 27[80]\n\nCentreville: Confederate Monument, Bibb County Courthouse (1910) by UDC, Leonard Calloway Pratt Chapter No. 1056.[81] \"These were men who by the simple manhood of their lives, by their strict adherence to the principles of right, by their sublime courage and unspeakable sacrifices, even to the heroism of death, have preserved for us through the gloom of defeat a priceless heritage of honor.\"[82]\n\nClayton: Confederate Monument (1909); UDC monument at Barbour County Courthouse Square[83]\n\nDecatur: Confederate Monument, near Morgan County Courthouse (1922) by UDC, Joe Wheeler Chapter No. 291[84]\n\nFayette: Confederate Monument, Fayette County Courthouse (1929) by UDC, Fayette Chapter[85]\n\nFlorence: Confederate Monument, Lauderdale County Courthouse (1903) Ladies Memorial Association[86]\n\nGreensboro: Confederate Monument, Hale County Courthouse (1904) Ladies Memorial Association of Greensboro.\n\nHuntsville: Confederate Veterans Memorial, Madison County Courthouse (1905) by UDC[87]\n\nJasper: Confederate Monument, Walker County Courthouse (1907) Jasper County Chapter 925 by UDC[88]\n\nLivingston: Confederate Monument, Sumter County Courthouse (1908) by UDC, Sumter Chapter[89]\n\nMoulton: Confederate Monument, Lawrence County Courthouse (2006) by SCV, Lt.

In 1966, there was an unsuccessful attempt to tear the monument down; it was defaced with \"Black Power\". It was vandalized with paint in 2015 and again in October, 2017; after the latest incident the United Daughters of the Confederacy, its owner, decided not to clean it, \"out of fear it would only be repeated\".[93]\n\nOther public monuments[]\n\nAnniston: Major John Pelham Monument, Quintard Avenue (1905) through the efforts of Clarence J.
