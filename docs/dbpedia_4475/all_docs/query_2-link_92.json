        "text": "By Ted Como\n\nIn Ogdensburg’s bicentennial year of 1976, City Historian Elizabeth Baxter wrote a series of stories identifying the origin of the city’s street names and parks, which published From April 29 through July 14. I have consolidated them, as follows.\n\nOgdensburg has, or in the past century and a half has had, 101 streets, 18 avenues, at least 11 lanes, and two places, a total of 132 public ways, all named by its legislators. In addition, at least 17 parks and one square have been given names. For such titles, names of early presidents, generals and congressmen were the most popular. Nathan Ford, founder of Ogdensburg, had the distinction of having both a street and an avenue named for him.\n\nThe streets are or were: Allen, Anthony, Arnold, Barker, Barre, Bigelow, Broad, Brown, Canton, Caroline, Carroll, Catharine, Cedar, Champlain, Channing, Chatham, Cherry, Clark, Commerce, Congress, Courtland, Covington, The Crescent, Curtis, David, Dearborn, de Viller, Denny, Division, East Cedar, East David, East River, East South, Elizabeth, Ellen, Fine, Ford, Franklin, Gates, Gibbs, Gilbert, Grant, Greene. Also, Grove, Hamilton, Hasbrouck, Hayward, Iryin, Isabella, Jackson, James, Jay, John, Judson, Kenrick, Kiah, King, Knox, Lafayette, Lake, Linden, Lisbon, Main, Marine, Market, Mechanic, Mill, Montgomery, Morris, North Railroad, North Rosseel, North Water, Oak, Ogden, Park, Patterson, Pearl, Philip (or Phillip), Pickering, Pine, Railroad, River, Rose, Rosseel, Scott, Seymour, South Railroad, South Rosseel, South, Spinner, Spring, Spruce, State, Tate, Wadham, Wall, Warren, Washington, Water, William, and Willow.\n\nAs of 2022, streets on the above list that have since been eliminated are: Allen, Barker, Broad, Carroll, Channing, Chatham, Courtland, Division, East Cedar, Ellen, James, Marine, North Railroad, North Water, Rose, Scott, South Railroad, South Rosseel, Spruce, Warren, Water, and Willow.\n\nStreets that have been added since Baxter’s report (mostly in the area of the former psychiatric center) are: Acco Way, Center Cir, Center E Dr, Center W Dr, Chapel Dr, Chapel Spur Dr, Chimney Point Dr, Commerce Point Dr, Correction Way, Cottage Dr, Curtis Hill Dr, E Hayward St, East River St, Entrance Av, Flower Dr, Flower Spur Dr, Horwood Pl, Kendrick St, Letechworth Ln, Lower Covington St, N Meadow Dr, N Water St, Nevin St, Picquet Dr, Pritchard Av, Quinn Dr, Remington Cir, S Water St, St Denny St, Ribbitts Dr, Trinity Ln, W River St, and W South St.\n\nThe avenues are or were: Adams, Albany, Ford, Harrison, Jefferson, Jersey, Lincoln, Madison, Mansion, Monroe, Morris, New York, Pleasant, Plover Hill, Proctor, Rensselaer, Riverside, and Woodford. The lanes (undoubtedly there are others) are or were: Burton, Howard, Keefe, Linden, McCarrier, Mccarty, Pero, Pottery, Proctor’s, and Denny.\n\nThe places are Academy and Crescent. The single square is Prospect. The parks are or were Crescent, D.D., Groulx, Grove, Haley, Hamilton, Library, Lions Recreation, Lyon, Madison, Mansion, Morissete, Proctor, Railroad, Riverside, Triangle, and West End.\n\nEliminatated since Baxter’s report have been Morris Avenue and McCarty and Denny Lanes.\n\nA plot plan of the very early Village of Ogdensburgh shows now streets and lots on the west side of the Oswegatchie River. The original streets were Ford, Washington, Greene, Knox, Isabella, Catherine, Euphemia, Gertrude, Caroline, Elizabeth, Water, Morris, Jay, Hamilton and Paterson. The village plan apparently was made between April 5, 1817, when the village was incorporated, and 1824, when Euphemia became State Street and Gertrude became Franklin Street. Water Street included what is now the Crescent.\n\nAn invaluable early map of the Village of Ogdensburgh was made in 1835 from surveys by Robert Tate & Sons, civil engineers of Ogdensburgh. The village then had a population of 2,500, while the population of St. Lawrence County totaled 42,000, according to information listed on the map. The map showed Water, Washington, Ford, Greene, Knox, Jay, Montgomery, Fayette, David, South, Catharine, Isabella, State, Caroline, Franklin, Elizabeth, Morris, Hamilton, Paterson, Pickering and Mechanic Streets and Jersey Avenue, all east of the Oswegatchie River. West of the Oswegatchie were Garrison, Middle, Main, River and Lake Streets and Rensselaer, Mansion, St. Lawrence and New York Avenues.\n\nHere are the origins of city streets as listed by Baxter in 1976:\n\nACADEMY PLACE was named for its proximity to the Ogdensburg Free Academy.\n\nADAMS AVENUE was named for John Adams, 1735-1826, second president and a drafter of the Declaration of Independence.

He started his law practice in Ogdensburg in 1815.\n\nFRANKLIN STREET was, no doubt, named for Benjamin Franklin, 1706- 90, American statesman who helped draft the Declaration of Independence, was largely instrumental in gaining French recognition of the cause of the American Revolution, and negotiated the Treaty of Paris.\n\nFORD AVENUE and FORD STREET were both named for Nathan Ford, founder of Ogdensburg.

At a charter election Dec. 8, 1868, in the then infant City of Ogdensburgh, taxpayers voted, 234 to 70, to raise $500 for Cemetery Park.\n\nThe old burial ground actually had been a public park since Oct. l, 1863 On June 29 of that year, the village officials gave notice that after Oct. 1, Block 24, known as the old burying ground, would be thrown open and converted into a public park, for which purpose the ground will be leveled and monuments removed.\n\nCRESCENT PARK got its name from its shape, curving along the Oswegatchie River. It was acquired by the City of Ogdensburgh on June 15, 1868, from George Parish and Elijah B. Allen for $1 out of regard for the happiness and welfare of the inhabitants of said city. It was known originally as River Bank Park., and the Crescent (street) as called River Street or Water Street.\n\nThe names were changed in 1886 to Crescent Park and the Crescent. Crescent Park was made possible by the women of Ogdensburg in the second half of the 19th century under the leadership of Mary Parker. The city during the spring of 1868 received, as a donation from George Parish and Elijah B. Allen, a grant of all the land between the center of Water Street (now the Crescent) and the center of the Oswegatchie River, from a point 20 feet south of the Parish cribbing to a point 300 feet north of Montgomery Street.\n\nA condition was that the city spend an average of $500 a year for five years to improve it as a public ground. The city had already paid Parish $5,400 for water power for the then new water works and title to the rest of the river bank to the State Arsenal, about 400 feet above the dam. The east bank of the Oswegatchie from the dam to the bridge rose in a 35 to 40-foot bluff at the foot of Mongomery Street and fell gradually to about 25 feet at the bridge.\n\nAt the mid-point of the 19th century, the bank was a popular resort for the villagers. Young men of the village obtained and planted attractive shade trees the entire distance. But between 1850 and 1868, time, vandals, and the waters of the Oswegatchie destroyed much of the beauty of this natural amphitheater, and the site became, according, to the Daily Journal, more a receptacle and depository of filth and rubbish than a place of resort of pleasure seekers.\n\nVoters, in a heavy majority, had rejected a proposition to improve the ground and make it a public park. Then Miss Parker conceived the idea of appealing to Geroge Parish, then living at his ancestral home in Austria, and, with other women of Ogdensburgh, addressed him. Their request was granted. The ladies, however, did not see all of their plan realized. They wanted Water Street (the Crescent) closed to carriage travel from Greene to Montgomery, the ends of Jay, Knox and Pickering Streets closed, a wall constructed at the water’s edge from Montgomery to Greene, the crest of the bank graded, Water Street included in the park, walks constructed, and shrubbery planted.\n\nGROULX PARK was dedicated Nov. 11,1933, to Corporal Charles A, Groulx, who at 25 was the first Ogdensburg soldier to die in battle in World War I, near Chateau Thierry on the Marne front, July 5,1918. The Groulx memorial is a cairn; the stones are from the Ogdensburg shore of the St. Lawrence River.\n\nGROVE PARK was named for its trees.\n\nHALEY PARK is a memorial to the late Mrs. Charles Haley. At Ford and Bigelow Streets, its contains a flower urn, once a water font for annimals on Commerce Street.

At the park is the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, work of Sally James Farnham, 1869-1943, Ogdensburg native. The monument was dedicated Aug. 23, 1905, to the soldiers and sailors of the Town of Oswegatchie who served in the Civil War.\n\nTHE LIONS CLUB PARK is a popular center for sports\n\nLYON PARK, former home of the Ogdensburg Volunteer Rescue Squad on Greene Street, was given to the city by the late Arthur S.

The property was acquired by the family following the death of Charles F. Allen, son of Elijah B. Allen, who bought it about 1827.\n\nThe late Charles P. Lyon was the last Lyon who lived there. He was a descendant of John Lyon, born in 1753 at Morristown who came to the city in 1796 with Nathan Ford’s party. John Lyon, a veteran ot the Revolutionary War, died Feb. 3, 1834. Mr. O’Neil acquired the Lyon property from the estate Helena G. Lyon, widow of Charles P. Lyon.\n\nA house there was demolished in the fall of 1961 and the site was cleared, except for a few lilacs.Elijah Ball Allen, 1791-1869, native of Massachusetts, in 1821 went to Sault St. Marie, where he was an Indian agent and a fur trader, after having been a fur trader at Fort Dearborn, later Chicago, 111. He established a forwarding business, commission office, and hardware store in the Ogdensburg and owned and directed a fleet of vessels and barges operating between Ogdensburgh and Montreal. There are those who may remember Allen’s famous willow trees, long gone now.\n\nOne old willow had a history of many decades, In 1835, Allen’s daughter Louisa accompanied one of his employees, Charles Shepard, to Waddington, riding in a wagon pulled by a horse hired for the occasion. The story goes that on the return trip, while passing through woods near the Old Hack Tavern, Shepard thought he needed a whip to speed up the horse. Accordingly, he stopped to cut a switch from a bush near the road, and in his attempt broke his knife. He than pulled up a willow twig by the roots.\n\nLouisa Allen forbade him to whip the horse, and said she would plant the root in the Allen garden. It was said that the other willows in the family garden were limbs of this willow, which became a mighty tree.\n\nMANSION PARK was named for Nathan Ford’s mansion, completed in 1805.\n\nFATHER MARTIN PARK, owned by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ogdensburg, took its name from the late Msgr.

He served two terms as mayor.\n\nPROCTOR PARKS were the names given the small plots at the intersection of Ford and Bigelow Streets and east of Champlian Street, where Greene Street and Proctor Avenue merged, in 1905, on petition of the late Edward P. Lynch. In 1906, the Board of Public Works turned them over to the Park Commissioners. These two small plots of ground near the easterly end of Ford Street com memorated the late William L. Proctor.\n\nPROSPECT SQUARE consists of 45-foot strips of land on both sides of William Street between Curtis and Hayward Streets.
