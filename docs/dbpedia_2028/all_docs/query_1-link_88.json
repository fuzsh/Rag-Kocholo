        "text": "NEW YORK — The Los Angeles Times captured five Pulitzer Prizes on Monday for coverage ranging from devastating wildfires in its backyard to a civil war on the other side of the globe — the second-most awards ever won by a newspaper.\n\nCoverage of the war in Iraq led to two prizes: Anthony Shadid of The Washington Post for international reporting, and David Leeson and Cheryl Diaz Meyer of The Dallas Morning News for breaking news photography.\n\nThe New York Times won the public service award for a story by David Barstow and Lowell Bergman about worker safety at a company where lax enforcement allegedly contributed to thousands of injuries and some deaths. The Wall Street Journal claimed a pair of Pulitzers: one for explanatory reporting and a second for beat reporting.\n\nAs news of the Pulitzers reached the Los Angeles Times' newsroom, staff members erupted in cheers and applause.\n\n\"My feeling is this reflects the depth of talent at this paper and the depth of dedication across all departments,\" Times editor John S. Carroll told the staff.\n\nThe newspaper's five prizes were exceeded only by The New York Times' seven awards in 2002 — most of those related to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Prior to that, no publication had ever won more than three Pulitzers in a single year.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times won Pulitzers in criticism, editorial writing, feature photography, breaking news and national reporting.\n\nThe Times staff was recognized for breaking news coverage of the wildfires that tore through Southern California last fall, killing 24 people, destroying thousands of homes and charring more than 750,000 acres.\n\nDan Neil, who came to the newspaper only in September, won the criticism award for what the Pulitzer board described as \"one-of-a-kind reviews of automobiles.\" William Stall won for his editorials analyzing the state's troubled government and offering remedies.\n\nBeyond state borders, photographer Carolyn Cole won in the feature photography for her coverage of innocent citizens caught in the crossfire of the Liberian civil war, and the Times staff was cited again for national reporting — a three-part series about the rise of Wal-Mart and its effect on economies around the world.\n\nThe Blade, based in Toledo, Ohio, claimed its first ever Pulitzer, winning for an investigative report by Michael D. Sallah, Mitch Weiss and Joe Mahr about an elite U.S. Army platoon accused of killing unarmed Vietnamese civilians in 1967.\n\nWhen the awards were announced, Sallah and Weiss hugged each other and the paper's top editors.\n\n\"This paper has won virtually every award that could have been offered in journalism except a Pulitzer,\" said John Robinson Block, publisher and editor in chief, as staffers sipped champagne out of plastic cups. \"And now we have that.\"\n\nThe New York Times won for an unusual collaboration across media with the PBS program \"Frontline\" and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. The piece examined workplace hazards at the foundries of cast-iron pipe manufacturer McWane Inc.\n\n\"This represents an extraordinary pioneering example of a hybrid form of journalism,\" Times Executive Editor Bill Keller said. \"It's another demonstration that whatever may be said about the Times being stodgily traditional, the fact is, we can do whatever we put our minds to.\"\n\nThe explanatory reporting award went to Kevin Helliker and Thomas M. Burton of The Wall Street Journal for their groundbreaking examination of aneurysms, an often-overlooked medical condition that kills thousands of Americans each year.\n\nThe Journal won a second award for Daniel Golden in the beat reporting category, for his \"meticulously\" documented stories on admission preferences given to the children of alumni and donors at U.S. universities.\n\nInternational reporting winner Shadid of The Washington Post was recognized for his \"extraordinary ability to capture, at personal peril,\" the voices and emotions of Iraqis during and after the war.\n\nTwo hundred reporters gathered in the Post newsroom to celebrate the awards to Shadid and Anne Applebaum, who won the general nonfiction prize in the arts categories for her account of Soviet concentration camps in \"Gulag: A History.\"\n\nShadid spoke on speaker phone from Iraq, praising the work of Post reporters in the country.\n\n\"What went on here was really a collaborative effort,\" Shadid told AP radio later in the day. \"I had incredible colleagues — first-rate people throughout — that enjoyed each other and learned from each other and worked together well.\"\n\nThe commentary award went to Leonard Pitts Jr. of The Miami Herald for his \"fresh, vibrant columns that spoke, with both passion and compassion, to ordinary people on often divisive issues.\"\n\n\"I'm going to Disney World,\" Pitts joked after thunderous applause in the newsroom.\n\nThe editorial cartooning prize went to Matt Davies of The Journal News, White Plains, N.Y., for his \"piercing cartoons on an array of topics, drawn with a fresh, original style.\"\n\n\"It's a big surprise,\" said Davies. \"When I see all the other work that's out there — to get a prize like this — I'm just thrilled. Absolutely blown away.\"\n\nThe photo award in breaking news went to Leeson and Meyer of The Dallas Morning News for their \"eloquent\" photographs depicting both the violence and poignancy of the war in Iraq.\n\nThe Pulitzer for fiction went to Edward P. Jones for \"The Known World,\" his long-anticipated historical novel about a black slave owner. The drama prize was captured by Doug Wright for \"I Am My Own Wife,\" the tale of a real-life German transvestite who survived both the Nazis and the Communists.\n\nThe board made no award in the feature writing category — the first time since the category was added in 1979 that an award was not given. The last time there was no award in a category was in 1993 for editorial writing.\n\nOverall, the board has declined to award a journalism prize 24 times in 88 years.\n\nEach prize is worth $10,000, except for public service, which is recognized with a gold medal.\n\nThe awards are given by Columbia University on the recommendation of the 18-member Pulitzer board, which considers nominations from jurors in each category."
