        "text": "The Los Angeles Times won five Pulitzer Prizes yesterday, dominating this year's competition with writing that included editorials, automobile reviews and breaking news coverage of the wildfires that devastated Southern California last fall.\n\nThe five prizes were the second-highest number of awards won by a newspaper since the awards were first given in 1917. The New York Times won seven in 2002, mostly on the strength of its reporting of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Aside from that unusual year, the most Pulitzer Prizes any paper has won in a single year is three.\n\nThe New York Times won the public service award yesterday for articles by David Barstow and Lowell Bergman, detailing deaths and injuries among American workers and showing how employers broke basic safety rules with impunity. The submission was moved from the investigative reporting category, where it was a finalist, by the board that administers the awards on behalf of Columbia University.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal won two prizes: for explanatory reporting, for a series examining aneurysms, by Kevin Helliker and Thomas M. Burton; and for beat reporting, for Daniel Golden's look into admission preferences given by American colleges to the children of alumni and donors."
