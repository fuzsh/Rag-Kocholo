        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: As Philips Respironics settles costly legal battles over its defective breathing machines, the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched an investigation into whether the company withheld critical information about the dangers of the devices before pulling them from the shelves, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette has learned. The SEC is seeking information about the inner workings of the company — including scientific tests of the flawed devices — and the steps it took to inform investors who stood to lose billions of dollars in one of the largest recalls of its kind, according to multiple sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Though the company agreed last month to pay more than $1 billion to settle lawsuits from patients who say they were sickened by the machines, the SEC inquiry is expected to focus on the impact on investors whose stock plummeted as the crisis in the company turned into a global health emergency. The agency's investigation brings another wave of scrutiny to a company that has already faced hundreds of injury claims in federal court and allegations that Philips knew its popular sleep apnea devices posed serious risks, but continued to churn them out from two large factories outside Pittsburgh. David Chase, a Florida lawyer who once led investigations for the SEC, said his former agency will examine the responses of the company’s leadership after it had discovered \"a lurking, potential disaster.\" \"It comes down to what they knew and when did they know it. It's about disclosure,\" he said. https://lnkd.in/eJvRcjeY\n\nSTEALTH INVADERS: This stellar report by GFI and others reveals compelling cases of oligarchs, foreign leaders and global criminals who moved billions of illicit dollars into the United States and purchased skyscrapers, steel factories and other commercial property -- with the help of anonymous companies and US banks. Ukraine billionaire Igor Kolomoisky, now under detention in his home country, is accused of transferring hundreds of millions of dollars in stolen money into the US, where he amassed a real estate empire. At one time, he purchased enough properties in Cleveland to become the city's largest commercial landlord -- his name never appearing on a single land record. \"The fact that 14 of these cases involve investments by politically exposed persons or Russian oligarchs speaks to the lack of due diligence and reporting requirements for professionals involved in commercial real estate deals,\" said Tom Cardamone, president and CEO of Global Financial Integrity. Kudos to GFI, FACT Coalition and the Anti-Corruption Data Collective.\n\nBILLION DOLLARS TO THE INJURED: After years of heated legal battles over its defective breathing machines, Philips Respironics agreed to a $1 billion settlement with patients who say they were injured using the devices that were pulled from the shelves three years ago in one of the most catastrophic recalls of its kind. The settlement will end sweeping lawsuits that were filed after tests showed the company's popular sleep apnea and ventilators were fitted with an industrial foam that was capable of breaking down and spewing dangerous particles and fumes into the lungs of patients. The agreements also include $25 million to pay for medical monitoring as part of a class-action lawsuit pushed by lawyers and medical experts who say the patients will need to be evaluated for years to come to determine whether the toxic chemicals emitted from the foam may have caused severe illnesses, including cancer. The Food and Drug Administration has received more than 500 reports of deaths linked to the machines so far, and thousands have blamed the devices for unexplained respiratory conditions, liver and kidney damage and cancer. “I still don’t have my husband,” said Shawne Thomas of Louisiana, whose 51-year-old husband died from a rare form of nose and throat cancer after using a Philips continuous positive airway (CPAP) machine for about 20 months. “But it sounds like a good amount of money coming out of their pocket, so it makes me feel a little bit happier.” Last year, an investigation by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and ProPublica revealed that Philips Respironics — with two sprawling factories In Murrysville and New Kensington — held back thousands of complaints over the course of 11 years about a foam fitted inside the devices that was found to break down and send potentially dangerous material into the masks of patients. Federal law requires device makers to turn over such reports to the FDA within 30 days. The investigation also showed that the FDA was alerted to the problem in the years before the recall, but did not dig deeper or warn the public about the breakdown.\n\nLOVE, PASSION AND REVOLUTION. Olga Morgan Goodwin was a remarkable woman who could burrow her way into the hearts of everyone she met. A fiery revolutionary who was born in poverty in the mountains of Cuba, she risked her life for the freedom of her country and encountered enough hardship to break any human being. She was arrested by Castro's police and her American husband, William Morgan, was killed by firing squad in 1961 for defying the regime. Then, she spent the next 10 years in Castro's prisons, where she led hunger strikes and was beaten and forced to spend time in solitary confinement (where rats crawled over her body at night). She escaped on a rickety boat to America during the Mariel boatlift in 1980 -- barely making it to Florida because the Cuban navy shot holes in the hull of her craft. When I found her on a cold, winter day living in a cramped Toledo townhome in 2002, she broke her silence after two decades and agreed to grant a series of interviews about her life in Cuba, her efforts to overthrow Castro, her husband's death and her dangerous escape to the U.S. After her arrival in America, she led a relentless campaign to bring his remains back to the U.S. for reburial. “To me, William was an American — and belongs here,” she later said. “I can’t give up.” Her efforts prompted a congressional trip to her native country by U.S. House members Marcy Kaptur and Charlie Rangel, who met with Castro in 2002 in an all-night session to persuade the leader to release the remains. The Cuban president agreed to return the American's body to the U.S., but to this day, it's still interred in cemetery in Havana. Despite all the tragedies that she faced, she never lost her passion for life, her love for people, and her undying belief that someday her country would be free. Just days ago, she died quietly after suffering a stroke in the small farmhouse that she shared with her daughter, Loretta, just miles from Lake Okeechobee in Florida. \"She was at peace,\" said Loretta, who was born to her and Morgan. \"I miss her so much.\" And now, years after meeting Olga at the doorway of her home on a snowy, wind-swept morning, I miss her, too. Peace, Olga.\n\nPULLING BACK THE CURTAIN: HARVARD'S SHORENSTEIN CENTER breaks down our investigative project on dangerous breathing machines sold by Philips Respironics. \"It took the reporters many months to get the Philips scientists to talk. The scientists were hesitant because talking to the press could risk their jobs and reputations and potentially made them vulnerable to libel or defamation lawsuits. \"But the reporting team kept calling until one day one scientist agreed to talk, explaining the complexity of the science behind the defective machines and how dangerous the chemicals were to humans. '“I’ve been doing this for 30 years and I still believe that people at the end of the day want to do the right thing,\" says ProPublica reporter Debbie Cenziper. '“And at the end of the day, our sources believed this company kept a very dangerous secret and that someone needed to provide answers. Someone needed to have to provide transparency.'\" https://lnkd.in/eJP7ew5G\n\nHONORED: Reporters for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and ProPublica captured one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious journalism awards for their 2023 investigative series, With Every Breath, which detailed the massive recall of Philips Respironics breathing machines as well as critical breakdowns that took place in government regulation during the global health crisis, it was announced on Monday. Michael Sallah of the Post-Gazette and Debbie Cenziper of ProPublica, who co-led the project, along with Post-Gazette reporters Michael Korsh and Evan Robinson-Johnson, received the 2023 George Polk Award in the category of medical reporting for stories that showed how Philips, which operates two factories near Pittsburgh, took in thousands of complaints about its defective sleep apnea machines and ventilators but kept them secret while the company's stock prices soared. The investigative team, which included students from Northwestern University's Medill Investigative Lab, revealed that Philips received more than 3,700 reports dating back more than a decade about an industrial foam in the popular devices that was capable of degrading and sending dangerous particles and fumes into the masks of sleeping patients. Despite federal law, the device maker failed to turn over the complaints to the government until after the 2021 recall. In the aftermath of the stories, Philips agreed in January to stop making the devices in the United States for years to come under a consent decree with the Justice Department, all but ending the company’s reign as one of the top makers of breathing machines in the country. https://lnkd.in/eAVH3eVw\n\nMASSIVE IMPACT: Reeling from one of the most catastrophic recalls in decades, Philips Respironics said it will stop selling its troubled sleep apnea machines and other respiratory devices in the United States under a settlement with the federal government that will all but end the company’s reign as one of the top makers of breathing machines in the nation. The action comes more than two years after the company pulled millions of its popular breathing devices off the shelves after admitting that a foam fitted in the machines to reduce noise could break apart and release cancer-causing particles and fumes into the masks worn by patients. A Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and ProPublica investigation found the company held back thousands of complaints about the crumbling foam for more than a decade before warning customers about the dangers. Those using the machines included some of the most fragile people in the country, including infants, the elderly, veterans and patients with chronic conditions. https://lnkd.in/eZ88f_KK"
