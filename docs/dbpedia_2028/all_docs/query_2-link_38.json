        "text": "We’re thrilled to announce the winners of the 2024 Society for Features Journalism’s Excellence-in-Features contest!\n\nTo be clear, winning this contest is no easy feat. Our judges fielded nearly 1,000 entries this year, so a huge congratulations goes to the three winners in each category. In some cases, limiting the winners to three simply could not be done, so there are a few ties and honorable mentions.\n\nRead on to be inspired and amazed by your hardworking features colleagues.\n\nThe SFJ Board of Directors would like to extend its thanks to the many judges who volunteered their time to help SFJ celebrate the craft of storytelling in words, videos and podcasts.\n\nThese are the winners in Division 2, along with judges’ comments about what made this year’s entries so stellar. First-place winners (except in Sweepstakes Awards) will receive a $300 prize.\n\nClick here for the Division 1 winners or Division 3 winners.\n\nOnce again, congratulations to all, and thank you to everyone who entered this year’s contest!\n\nDIVISION 2: Circulation 90,001 to 199,999\n\nFINEST IN FEATURES SWEEPSTAKES AWARDS: This honor recognizes the organizations in each division that have won the most awards. No entry is necessary. Instead, points are assigned for each of the winning entries: 20 points for first place, 15 points for second place, 10 points for third place and 5 points for honorable mention. The organizations with the highest number of points receive the sweepstakes awards.\n\nFirst place: Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. First-place awards in general feature (2,499+ words), general commentary portfolio, first-person narrative/essay, features beat writing portfolio and sports feature. Second-place awards in features series or project, and utility feature portfolio and feature writing portfolio. Third-place awards in general feature (999 words or fewer), narrative storytelling, arts & culture criticism portfolio, special section, and inclusion and representation. Honorable mention awards in general feature (999 words or fewer), narrative storytelling, general commentary portfolio, special product, first-person narrative essay, and inclusion and representation.\n\nSecond place: Houston Chronicle. First-place awards in general feature (1,000-2,499 words), arts & culture criticism portfolio and feature writing portfolio. Second-place awards in general feature (2,500+ words). Third-place awards in general commentary, sports and visual storytelling. Honorable mention award in food feature.\n\nThird place: St. Louis Post-Dispatch. First-place awards in general feature (999 words or fewer) and food feature. Second-place awards in food writing portfolio, food criticism and general commentary. Third-place award in special product. Honorable mention awards in arts & culture criticism portfolio and arts and entertainment feature.\n\nGENERAL FEATURE (2,500+ words): Longform storytelling at its finest\n\nFirst place: Michael D. Sallah, Debbie Cenziper and Michael Korsh; Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; With Every Breath: Millions of breathing machines, one dangerous defect.\n\nJudge’s comment: “With Every Breath,” a joint investigation by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and ProPublica in collaboration with Mediahuis NRC in the Netherlands, is an example of public service journalism and longform storytelling at its finest. More than a year of investigative reporting revealed that Philips Respironics spent 11 years hiding complaints about dangerous contaminants in its breathing machines as the company’s profits skyrocketed. The personal stories shared in this investigation are heartbreaking, and the breadth of reporting done for this project is staggering. Bravo to the whole team who made this important coverage happen!\n\nSecond place: Sarah Smith, Houston Chronicle, The ballad of the armadillo.\n\nJudge’s comment: In “The ballad of the armadillo: How one leathery critter became as iconic — and controversial — as Texas itself,” Sarah Smith has crafted a quintessentially perfect feature story. Every nuanced nugget of information she serves up about the nine-banded armadillo is side-splittingly funny, or funny/disturbing, or funny/shocking, and the quiz accompanying the story is a HOOT. Sarah Smith, your writing voice is so wonderful. Please write a book!\n\nThird place: Christy Gutowski, Chicago Tribune, Chicago’s “Walking Man.”\n\nJudge’s comment: Much like Chicago’s legendary “Walking Man” himself, Christy Gutowski’s story about his long life and tragic death is at turns surprising, sweet, somber and respectful. It’s easy to see why a story like this would resonate powerfully and emotionally with Chicago readers who felt as if they knew Joseph Kromelis, a snazzy dresser who spent decades walking the streets of Chicago selling watches and jewelry until 2022, when someone set fire to him as he was sleeping outside. Gutowski did a masterful job uncovering Kromelis’ life story and conveying it with dignity and compassion.\n\nHonorable mention: Julia Lurie, Mother Jones, Inside the psychiatric hospitals where foster kids are a ‘gold mine.’\n\nGENERAL FEATURE (1,000-2,499 words): Feature storytelling at its finest\n\nFirst place: Andrew Dansby, Houston Chronicle, Willie Nelson's birthday a reminder of what the country legend's 90 years have meant to Texas.\n\nJudge’s comment: In an illuminating and thoughtful essay marking Willie Nelson's 90th year, Andrew Dansby paints a vivid portrait, cleverly anchoring the piece around the concept of time. Dansby notes how Nelson uses time signatures and tempos in his music and how Nelson invested \"many of his roughly 47,335,600 minutes on Earth\" in artful songwriting. Dansby's writing is just as assured, with an inviting writer's voice. An example: \"Nelson is part family Bible and part 'Anarchist’s Cookbook.' His music is earthy yet sprinkled with stardust.”\n\nSecond place: Alex Mann, The Baltimore Sun, Survivors, families ‘moving with the pain.’\n\nJudge’s comment: Alex Mann revisits the massacre at the Capital Gazette to show, as he writes, \"scars visible and invisible remain.\" It's a beautiful piece of writing, tender and respectful, but never maudlin or cliche. And with simple scenes — a photographer driving a car, taking a photograph — we see survivors moving on, or trying to move on, with their lives.\n\nThird place: Théoden Janes, The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer, A good way to appreciate Deborah Triplett’s life? Consider what was behind her house.\n\nJudge’s comment: This isn't so much an obituary but an essay on a life well lived. In his gentle but also confident writer's voice Théoden Janes takes us into the world of a woman who, in her own way, made the larger world a better place.\n\nHonorable mention: Josh Neufeld, The Journalist’s Resource and Chicago Sun-Times, Empathy 101: How med schools are using improv, virtual reality and, yes, comics to help doctors and patients communicate.\n\nGENERAL FEATURE (999 words or fewer): Excellence in short feature writing\n\nFirst place: Aisha Sultan, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Dad and daughter head west from Valley Park in epic road trip born of grief.\n\nJudge’s comment: This is a perfect story. Aisha discovered a pair of subjects that make for a perfect feature — a father and daughter struggling to find their way forward after losing the family matriarch. She weaves their story expertly (love the \"out of the blue\" in the opening graph and how it ties into the blue butterfly) and lays it out so that it feels emotional, heartfelt and hopeful. An A+ job.\n\nSecond place: Samantha Swindler, The Oregonian, Welcome to Portland’s Robot Alley, where droids and Stormtroopers greet passersby.\n\nJudge’s comment: This is exactly what local journalism should be and what you look for in a tightly written feature story that is written in such a lively, engaging way. I felt like I could see and hear the installation and after reading it, I felt like I could picture this place and this man who constructed it. And to do that in under 1,000 words is GREAT. Bravo! Nice work.\n\nThird place: Anya Sostek, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, ‘2 lives were on the line’: Western Pa. school nurse saves pregnant teacher’s life.\n\nJudge’s comment: I had a hard time giving this third place as it could easily be No. 1. This story has it all — drama, stakes, tension and the most beautiful resolution. It's so well done and such a great feature story. One of those perfect human interest stories that don't come around very often and Anya just totally nailed it. Great work.\n\nHonorable mention: Megan Guza and Jordan Anderson, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Officer remembers ‘the violence, the smells, the sights’ inside the Pittsburgh synagogue.\n\nARTS & ENTERTAINMENT FEATURE: Feature treatment of an arts and entertainment topic\n\nFirst place: Kate Nelson, Cowboys & Indians, The quest for coexistence: Mo brings plenty on the cover.\n\nJudge’s comment: This writing isn’t just visual. You can hear and smell and taste the space and the twilight from the author’s words. It’s a vivid sense of place out of the gate, and it’s followed immediately by a strong sense of our central figure and his story — the individual, the history, the stakes; the impacts personally, tribally, and outside, to a vast industry and its viewers. This feature gives a robust sense of a purpose-driven life in the arts. With a judicious use of quotes, exceptionally well mapped-out, this piece lets the central figure tell his own story in a way that really builds beautifully; the written equivalent of excellent documentary filmmaking. Not only is the subject inspiring, the piece itself is, too: inspiring better writing by showing what a great feature can do.\n\nSecond place: Mary Carole McCauley, The Baltimore Sun, Henry Wong is on a mission to make a jazz and classical music mecca.\n\nJudge’s comment: I’m not an obvious choice to be wooed by a classical music story, but this piece grabbed me from the start and kept my attention rapt. This is really an exceptional piece of writing. The subject is an interesting one, but the writer’s attention to it and grasp of the story is what makes it really shine. It immediately gives the \"why.\" It has a clear through line. As a reader, it reminds me of people and places I know, while also making me wistful for elements I'm missing here and now. This is also a showpiece of editing down to the meat, making connections effortlessly with past and present. Throughout, it feels deep and focused but still imminently readable (and re-readable). Wonderful topic and delivery all around.\n\nThird place: Kristi Turnquist, The Oregonian, Ted Smith, ‘The Baby Boomer’ host on KMHD, is upbeat about Portland: ‘People here are good.’\n\nJudge’s comment: This is a relatively short piece that’s an efficient and skillful blending of light, funny, deep and serious, swirling the old and the new, present and past, and why it all matters together. Compelling, human and relevant.\n\nHonorable mention: Jane Henderson, St. Louis Post Dispatch, The perks and pleasures of volunteering for St. Louis arts groups.\n\nFOOD FEATURE: A single story on food, not including reviews or commentary.\n\nFirst place: Ian Froeb, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, New shops look to transform St. Louis’ bagel reputation. Can we move past bread-sliced?\n\nJudge’s comment: Great take on a local trend. The writer had fun with this story, but not too much fun. It comes across as great writing, not hokey. Love this sentence: “This schmear campaign against St. Louis bagels, though, might soon end.”\n\nSecond place: Mark Gauert, City & Shore | South Florida Sun Sentinel, Easy as Clafoutis.\n\nJudge’s comment: Sweet, sentimental, funny and very relatable.\n\nThird place: Paul Stephen, San Antonio Express-News, Cookie decorating maestro Anna Oliinyk paints a new life in America with royal icing.\n\nJudge’s comment: Great descriptive writing with a nice twist on how the family ended up in San Antonio.\n\nHonorable mention: Bao Ong, Houston Chronicle, Four decades on, Thursday nights at Tex-Mex favorite Armandos is the party that won’t go out of style.\n\nFOOD CRITICISM: A single story, such as a restaurant review, that offers opinions about a topic or restaurant in the food industry.\n\nFirst place: Mike Sutter, San Antonio Express-News, After 50 years, a not-so-Magic Time Machine\n\nJudge’s comment: A marvelously entertaining, nostalgia-and-melancholy-laced takedown of a 50-year, family-friendly San Antonio institution, which Sutter describes as “a make-believe world of costumes and claw machines and food that counts on nobody paying attention.” Sutter’s paragraph about “the Roman Orgy” platter (“Caligula called. He wants you to stop calling it that ... the ugliest plate of food I’ve ever seen outside a frat party”) was laugh-out-loud funny.\n\nSecond place: Ian Froeb, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Mainlander goes back to the future to find a great new St. Louis restaurant\n\nJudge’s comment: A nice, beefy rave about a modern St. Louis supper club dishing out fine dining in inventive, multicultural and prepaid ways while keeping its Midwestern heart intact.\n\nThird place: Mike Sutter, San Antonio Express-News, All that glitters isn’t gold at Ace of Steaks\n\nJudge’s comment: Another delicious Sutter roasting, this one of an overpriced “clubstaurant” steakhouse. This critic can write, with sentences dipped in acid: “If you’ve got a thousand bucks, they’ve got a gold-plated tomahawk rib-eye and a gold-tone bottle of Champagne waiting for you. If not, a 16-ounce rib-eye for $62 will have to do, listed as prime on the menu but not really interested in living up to it, instead lying there as stiff as the day after, with an off-note whiff like it slept in its clothes.”\n\nHonorable mention: Brad A. Johnson, OLTRE, Review: One Day in Bangkok, Two Worlds Apart\n\nFEATURE SERIES OR PROJECT: Feature treatment of any lifestyle, A&E or news topic that has multiple parts\n\nFirst place: Roxana Popescu, The San Diego Union-Tribune, The Price of Alzheimer’s\n\nJudge’s comment: You'll often find work that looks at the physical toll Alzheimer's can take on a person, but rarely do you see the financial implications of the disease. Taking this approach for this series was not only brilliant but brought new insight to a topic we often read about. The writer does a beautiful job at weaving together the personal anecdotes from each family's story with the larger issues at play. Excellent writing and reporting overall.\n\nSecond place: Abby Mackey, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Black, gold and blue\n\nJudge’s comment: This series had me at bocce. Who knew hill climbing and bocce were the secret to living longer? Series took what could be a boring topic and made it fun and relatable.\n\nThird place: Brad A. Johnson, Devin Duckworth and Staff, OLTRE, Guide to Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula\n\nJudge’s comment: Beautiful photography and stunning prose. Made me want to pack my bags and travel to Yucatán.\n\nHonorable mention Chuck Blount, Paul Stephen and Mike Sutter, San Antonio Express-News, Eat the street\n\nNARRATIVE STORYTELLING: A single story told in a narrative style, using techniques such as character development, use of dialog, sense of place, scene building, narrative arc and adherence to a theme\n\nFirst place: Tom Hallman Jr., The Oregonian, A principal’s ‘gift of grace’ changed a student’s life; 60 years later, a belated thank you in Pendleton changed more lives.\n\nJudge’s comment: You made me cry. As a former student who lived and went to school abroad in my youth, now a journalist and retired professor, I am keenly aware of how good teachers (and other people) who give second chances change lives. The full circle where Ting goes to thank his former principal is touching. And to think only eight words total changed two people's lives. Thank you for writing this piece. Congratulations on a well-deserved first-place win.\n\nSecond place: Matthew Korfhage and David Robinson, (Rochester, N.Y.) Democrat & Chronicle, How Buffalo’s catastrophic storm response failed a woman in life, then in death.\n\nJudge’s comment: Your story really spells out the mayhem Mother Nature caused in Buffalo. The tragic details are outlined well and I have to tell you, I teared up when I read about the woman who took the body to the hospital. That's what features do: show the human part of the story. We need more folks like those in the story who helped and more folks like you who will tell their stories. Thank you.\n\nThird place: Matt Vensel, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, I joined Kris Letang's legendary workout and learned what it takes to be the NHL's most relentless player.\n\nJudge’s comment: Your story shows how much work goes into being an athlete. Most folks don't understand, but your story nailed it. Terrific job.\n\nHonorable mention: Kris B. Mamula, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, When the small town hospital closed.\n\nFEATURES BEAT SPECIALTY WRITING PORTFOLIO: Three stories by the same writer on one features specialty topic, such as arts and entertainment, fashion, food, health, religion, technology or travel\n\nFirst place: Jeremy Reynolds, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\nJudge’s comment: Jeremy Reynolds' masterful coverage of ballet and classical music really got me thinking about both arts genres differently. With ballet, we know and hear plenty about how dancers are like professional athletes, but Jeremy's two ballet stories really peel back the curtain and provide vivid, compelling detail that drive the case home. He’s the first dance writer I’ve seen who treats covering professional ballet like it’s a professional sport and who describes what the dancers go through as if they’re pro athletes. He had the scientific research (some studies about ballet dancers, injury, which body parts are more prone to injury, etc) to back it up, and he really enunciated how much stress dancers come under when they audition for a job with a big company. With the symphony funding story, he once again broke all of it down and explained to the average person how and why symphonies struggle to stay afloat and how they’re funded. Unique story angles, deep, deep nuanced reporting and lively, detail-packed writing really won me over. Great beat reporting on subjects that don't always get their time in the spotlight!\n\nSecond place: Jamie Hale, The Oregonian\n\nJudge’s comment: I loved Jamie Hale’s clever, vibrant ledes in all three clips. Each story opened strong, grabbing me and sucking me in. Richly reported feature on Amanda's Trail examined so many angles of the issue faced by many PNW towns — how to reconcile and heal with an Indigenous past and right some of the wrongs. Loved the phoenix throughline in the Breitenbush story — smart, appropriate, creative. And the details in the travel story made Yachats seem like a place I want to visit! Well done. Great travel and outdoors writing!\n\nThird place: Mary Carole McCauley, The Baltimore Sun\n\nJudge Comment: Being a GA entertainment writer is not easy, and this reporter does it well. She finds ways to connect different artistic mediums with readers, and shows you why they are uniquely Baltimorean. Which is exactly what a local paper’s arts writer should do. The AI story was thought provoking and helped me better understand the pros and cons of music composed by AI vs. humans. The profile about the young poet was very well done, showing how he is uniquely Baltimorean and written in a way that gives respect to but doesn't overplay the “poor kid makes good” narrative that is often overwrought. And lastly, I loved the porky puns in the Jim Henson exhibit story. A great example of how one can be creative and interesting with an event preview!\n\nHonorable mention: Katie Anthony, Chicago Sun-Times, features on tattoos\n\nFOOD WRITING PORTFOLIO: Three stories, columns or reviews by the same writer on the same topic: food\n\nFirst place: Michael Russell, The Oregonian\n\nJudge’s comment: With stories about what’s missing in Korean BBQ, the Northern Mexico origins of the flour tortilla and why the Panucho Yucatan dish became a signature dish in Portland, this writer takes us on an informative journey of cultural cuisines. Written in a way that is smart and accessible with great presentation (including video) of what could have been standard list / first-glance-style stories.\n\nSecond place: Daniel Neman, St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\nJudge’s comment: Clever topics, reporting and execution. Hit just the right tone of funny and informative when writing about an epic cooking fail and how candy corn divides us as a nation. Took a story about the Australian sushi controversy as an opportunity to talk about the larger context and origins of dishes that showed a willingness to push the conversation.\n\nThird place: Samantha Swindler, The Oregonian\n\nJudge’s comment: From a world-famous destination steak and chicken restaurant to the life of a cranberry farmer to why peeled hotdogs are what makes a modest local haunt world famous, writer gives readers a great sense of place. Stories are knowledgeable, well-researched while breaking information down in a presentable fashion.\n\nHonorable mention: Mike Sutter, San Antonio Express-News\n\nGENERAL COMMENTARY PORTFOLIO: A collection of three columns or essays by the same writer on any human interest or specialty topic, excluding editorials\n\nFirst place: Adriana E. Ramírez, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\nJudge’s comment: The entry is beautifully written. It explores the human experience with remarkable insight, capturing the complexities and nuances of our emotions and relationships. Additionally, it puts current events into perspective in a way that centers on people and their personal experiences, making the narrative both relatable and impactful.\n\nSecond place: Aisha Sultan, St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\nJudge’s comment: I am impressed by how the writer tackles hard-pressing social issues with both insight and depth. The pieces demonstrate a penetrating understanding of these complex topics, offering thoughtful analysis and nuanced perspectives. The writer’s ability to engage with challenging subjects in a way that is both informative and thought-provoking is truly commendable.\n\nThird place: Joy Sewing, Houston Chronicle\n\nJudge’s comment: The entry is exceptionally well-crafted. It delves into the intricacies of the human experience from parenthood to homelessness and gender identity, the columns handle each of these issues with emotional care and profound sensitivity.\n\nHonorable mention: David Mills, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\nARTS & CULTURE CRITICISM PORTFOLIO: A collection of three columns, essays or reviews by the same writer on any arts, entertainment or culture topic, including dining reviews but excluding editorials\n\nFirst place: Andrew Dansby, Houston Chronicle\n\nJudge’s comment: Poignant and original, Dansby is a must read who draws you in even if you are not drawn to the subject matter. He draws you in and keeps you engaged.\n\nSecond place: Brad A. Johnson, OLTRE, food and travel\n\nJudge’s comment: By the time I finished reading the story on Thailand and its food, I needed a glass of water — so expertly does Johnson transport you to the worlds he inhabits.\n\nThird place: Adriana E. Ramírez, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\nJudge’s comment: Ramírez does a wonderful job of not just reviewing a book but explaining why it's important in the context of today's culture.\n\nHonorable mention: Kevin C. Johnson, St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\nSPORTS FEATURE: Feature treatment on any sports topic\n\nFirst place: Christopher Carter, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, ‘Angels’ in Oakland: How Pitt basketball assistant Milan Brown survived cardiac arrest and returned to coaching.\n\nJudge’s comment: Christopher finely tells the story of Milan Brown’s cardiac arrest and recovery through the various lenses of the people close to him. Christopher's standalone written words were strong. It’s a compelling read where Christopher covers all bases that makes this worthy of first place.\n\nSecond place: Jana Pruden, The Globe and Mail, Hitting Zero.\n\nJudge’s comment: The presentation and page layout were stellar. Coupled with text from Jana, the story captures how competitive cheer can be joyful and intense at the same time.\n\nThird place: Jonathan M. Alexander, Houston Chronicle, The making of C.J. Stroud: A family's strength, a father’s mistake and the power of forgiveness.\n\nJudge’s comment: Jonathan sets this story up well. He gets inside the makings of C.J. Stroud’s human side, inviting the reader into the Houston Texans quarterback’s family background with grace. In this story, we understand the mentality of Stroud, who eventually won rookie of the year.\n\nVISUAL STORYTELLING: Coverage of any A&E, lifestyle or specialty topic using a single video of not more than 8 minutes in length\n\nFirst place: Samantha Swindler, The Oregonian, Learn how cranberries are harvested in the small Oregon coast town.\n\nJudge’s comment: The piece opened strongly with impressive shots and makes great use of drone shoots and creative close-ups. The story provided substantial information, effectively illustrating the meticulous effort and time invested to create a comprehensive timeline of a cranberry’s journey.\n\nSecond place: Brian Ernst and Stephanie Zimmermann, Chicago Sun-Times, Catalytic converter thefts in Chicago lead to shockingly low arrests.\n\nJudge’s comment: This video incorporates user-generated content and graphics, enhancing the production.\n\nThird place: Jon Shapley, Houston Chronicle, Le Jardinier chefs combine the best of food and art with a touch of fine dining at MFAH.\n\nJudge’s comment: The inventive editing techniques created a fun viewing experience.\n\nHonorable mention: Samantha Swindler, The Oregonian, Tour the 118-year-old Pendleton saddle maker Hamley & Co.\n\nSPECIAL SECTION: The best your publication has to offer in printed A&E, features and lifestyle coverage\n\nFirst place: Staff, Chicago Sun-Times, Creative Chicago special section\n\nJudge’s comment: What a pleasure to read. It's clear a huge effort was made to seek out underrepresented creatives and locations where art can be found. The presentation was beautiful, both in print and online, giving attention to a wide range of media and artists.\n\nSecond place: Jody Schmal and Melissa Aguilar, Houston Chronicle, Top 100 Restaurants\n\nJudge’s comment: The online presentation with an opening video was a great, immersive touch. Including a Google map of the restaurant locations is useful information. Beautiful photos made it hard to read through the entry without getting hungry! It would be nice for next year's guide to include an option to filter the restaurants by cuisine (Mexican, Mediterranean, Thai ...)\n\nThird place: Staff, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Top Workplaces 2023\n\nJudge’s comment: A nice, wide range of articles on the workplace and how to navigate a post-COVID working world. The online presentation is well organized, although a little bit crowded. It was a little hard to know where the eye should go first. One note: The link to the methodology for how the lists were compiled is broken. That should be fixed if the guide is intended to be evergreen.\n\nHonorable mention: Jim Kiest and Jan Waddy, San Antonio Express-News, S.A. Life.\n\nSPECIAL PRODUCT: The best examples of a special product – such as a magazine or special section – published at least two times a year\n\nFirst place: John Flynn, Joram Mushinske and Liz Johnson, North Jersey Media Group, (201) Magazine\n\nJudge’s comment: The (201) Magazine is a standout among newspaper special magazines with captivating art direction and layouts. The Art issue is superb with striking photos and a well-curated round-up of local artists and exhibits. These magazines are more than pretty with superb editorial features throughout. Highlights include Jim Beckerman's profile of Englewood's longtime resident and superstar Tony Bennett, who didn't love Englewood back quite as much, and Cindy Schweich Handler's \"6 Things to Know About\" feature on an ESL teacher giving back to her community. The magazines feature page after page of gorgeous photos and profile portraits. Of-the-moment features on beauty products, trendy gyms, and houses to drool over round out the editorial.\n\nSecond place: Mark Gauert, Cassie Armstrong and Anderson Greene, South Florida Sun Sentinel, Explore Florida & The Caribbean\n\nJudge’s comment: At first glance, the magazine could be mistaken for one of those glossy, frothy city guides you find in your hotel room with nothing you actually want to do — not this one. The magazines balance restaurant reviews with well-reported features such as stories on Disney wilderness camping, little-known cruise perks and a story on how Sanibel Island is making a comeback five months after Hurricane Ian. The magazines are graced by Editor-in-Chief Mark Gauert's delightful writing as evinced in \"Greetings from the River Maya Mexico\" — nice lede! Well worth the read and stashing for future travels. The October issue is just as delightful; both clocking in at 100 well-planned pages.\n\nThird place: Amy Bertrand and Gabe Hartwig, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, STL Life\n\nJudge’s comment: These Sunday sections pack a lot of material into a few pages. Book reviews, local travel features, home maintenance tips, and well reported cover stories, all well curated. Excellent writing and fresh stories throughout both sections that were submitted for review. Highlights include a clever roundup of bear sightings and stories from the St. Louis area by Valerie Schremp Hahn and a profile of a concert, stage manager whose claim-to-fame is getting artist Lauryn Hill on and off stage on time by music critic Kevin C. Johnson. Columnist Aisha Sultan surfaces urgent matters in her work such as the plight of Missouri women working countless hours at minimum-wage jobs and slipping behind. The editors of STL Life manage to excel within the confines of a 10-page broadsheet with large color photos and fresh layouts.\n\nHonorable mention: Staff, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\nUTILITY FEATURE PORTFOLIO: Three stories focused on educating readers about topics that affect their everyday lives (e.g., health, retail prices, product availability) in an easy-to-digest, consumer-oriented “news you can use” way\n\nFirst place: Lois K. Solomon, South Florida Sun Sentinel\n\nJudge’s comment: Now this is reader service: The Sun Sentinel’s ASK LOIS columnist Lois K. Solomon solves readers’ everyday questions with grace and clarity, from figuring out which South Florida restaurants offer accessible restrooms to whether human composting is a viable option. We’ve all had questions that are simply too exhausting to run down the answers to — this work is time-saving, relevant and valuable for readers!\n\nSecond place: Gretchen McKay, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\nJudge’s comment: Gretchen McKay’s Aging Guide breaks down the core questions about caring for an elderly parent that most of us aren’t prepared for: When is it no longer safe for a senior to be home alone? What services do geriatric house call teams provide? Gretchen’s writing oozes with empathy and her straightforward, practical approach to the topic comes from having navigated these issues before. The end result: inspiring readers with a dose of confidence (and peace of mind) that they’ll get through it, too.\n\nThird place: Gosia Wozniacka, The Oregonian\n\nJudge’s comment: Gosia Wozniacka’s three-part series for The Oregonian breaks down the complexities of heat pumps into easy-to-digest, scannable installments that walk homeowners through the issue step-by-step. Kudos for a service piece that not only includes the all-important details of what this all costs, but a digital presentation loaded with resource links, such as state/federal grant incentive applications.\n\nFIRST-PERSON NARRATIVE/ESSAY: A single story written as an essay or in the first-person point of view that demonstrates a sense of proportion and perspective\n\nFirst place: Jonathan D. Salant, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Son's play 'Rite of Passage' is a heart-rending love note to his father.\n\nJudge’s comment: Complex and reflective, the author weaves a compelling narrative between the play and real life, sharing nuance and vulnerability that surely captivated his readers\n\nSecond place: Dale Bowman, Chicago Sun-Times, One last fish.\n\nJudge’s comment: Beautiful depiction of caregiving, told with ease; the author's loving relationship with his dad shines through\n\nThird place: Melina I. De Rose, South Florida Sun Sentinel, A letter to Lionel Messi, from one Rosarino to another: South Florida may just surprise you.\n\nJudge’s comment: Lovely and unique approach to a widely covered story; the author provides insight into both locations that readers can appreciate no matter where they live.\n\nHonorable mention: Gene Collier, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Herb Douglas home again with so many blessings.\n\nFEATURE WRITING PORTFOLIO: Three stories by the same writer that can be a combination of any beats\n\nFirst place: Sarah Smith, Houston Chronicle\n\nJudge’s comment: Smith demonstrates a strong, clear voice and a range of creative formats in these three stories, which show the breadth of her writing. The compelling details, delivered in 10 present tense moments, of a transgender teen’s transition while attending an all-girls Catholic high school make Beau’s story all the more powerful. And Smith’s use of second-person narrative to describe an ER nurse’s ordeal with long COVID was particularly effective.\n\nSecond place: Hanna Webster, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\nJudge’s comment: Webster’s incredibly well-researched and thoroughly reported deep dives into important health topics, such as the fentanyl overdose crisis and the impact of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, were as educational as they were engaging to read. Her account of a Pittsburgh teen’s advocacy while recovering from brain cancer was also a standout piece.\n\nThird place: Mike Klingaman, The Baltimore Sun\n\nJudge’s comment: Klingaman’s thoughtfully written, richly detailed pieces were a joy to read. I especially loved the colorful storytelling in his portrait of 90-year-old artist John Sauers and the poignant anecdotes in his profile of Luke Durant, the first Black Santa at a West Baltimore mall.\n\nHonorable mention: Stefano Esposito, Chicago Sun-Times\n\nINCLUSION AND REPRESENTATION IN FEATURES: The coverage of any lifestyle or culture topic that centers on historically marginalized or undercovered communities through revelatory storytelling\n\nFirst place: Andy Grimm, Chicago Sun-Times, Voices from Chicago’s most violent neighborhood\n\nJudge’s comment: This was an incredibly engaging multi-profile feature that puts a face to the gun violence statistics that make headlines. It looks at the realities of life in this Chicago neighborhood from multiple angles.\n\nSecond place: Gail Cornwall, The Hechinger Report, ‘Revolutionary’ housing: How colleges aim to support formerly incarcerated students\n\nJudge’s comment: Really strong piece shedding light on a subject not often explored. I particularly enjoyed the humanistic approach to this topic.\n\nThird place: Megan Tomasic, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Western Pennsylvania library posted a children’s drag queen book on Facebook. Then librarians faced a barrage of angry calls and threats.\n\nJudge’s comment: Excellent reporting that went beyond the “outrage” news hook to uncover the multi-layered issues at the root of the backlash and the library’s plight. No angle was left uninvestigated."
