        "text": "Life\n\nHe graduated from St. John's Jesuit High School, a college preparatory school in Ohio, and the University of Toledo, where he obtained his undergraduate degree in journalism.\n\nWhile working for The Toledo Blade, he received numerous state and national awards for his investigative stories into organized crime, clerical sexual abuse and white-collar fraud. He was named Best Reporter in Ohio in 2002 by the Society of Professional Journalists.\n\nTwo years later, Sallah and fellow reporters Mitch Weiss and Joe Mahr were awarded the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting for a series on the atrocities by Tiger Force, a U.S. Army platoon during the Vietnam War.\n\nHe became an investigative reporter and editor at the Miami Herald, where he directed numerous projects including a series on public housing corruption that won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting. He was a Pulitzer finalist for meritorious Public Service in 2012 for a series exposing wretched and deadly conditions in Florida's assisted living facilities. He worked two years at The Washington Post, and returned in 2014 to The Miami Herald, where he was a Pulitzer finalist for Local Reporting in 2016 for stories that exposed a corrupt police sting operation that laundered $71.5 million for drug cartels—kept millions in profits—but did not make a single arrest. He has received other national awards for his work in accountability journalism, including The IRE Medal, Gerald Loeb Award, and Robert F. Kennedy Award. He is currently on the national investigations team for Gannett/USA Today Network.\n\nWorks\n\nWith Mitch Weiss.Tiger Force: A True Story of Men and War. Little, Brown and Company. 2006. ISBN 0316066354."
