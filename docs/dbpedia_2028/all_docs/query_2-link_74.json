(Debbie Cenziper, Michael D. Sallah, and Michael Korsh, ProPublica)\n\nSome 6,600 current and former employees impacted in a January GAO data breach: Last month, CGI Federal, a contractor involved in GAO’s financial management systems, notified GAO of a data breach impacting approximately 6,600 people, primarily current and former GAO employees from 2007 to 2017, as well as some companies doing business with GAO.

Circuit of Trump’s claim that he is immune from prosecution for actions he took while in office. (Ann E. Marimow, Washington Post)\n\nRussia-Ukraine War\n\nSenate passes aid to Ukraine, but fate is uncertain in a hostile House: The measure would provide an additional $60.1 billion for Kyiv — which would bring the total U.S. investment in the war effort to more than $170 billion — as well as $14.1 billion for Israel’s war against Hamas and almost $10 billion for humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Palestinians in Gaza. (Karoun Demirjian, New York Times)\n\nUkraine claims Russian forces using Starlink network in occupied areas: Elon Musk’s SpaceX company, which owns Starlink, claims it doesn’t do business of any kind with the Russian government or its military.

(Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, CNN)\n\nAnalysis: Why are Republicans more likely to suffer hearing loss? Hearing loss appears to be yet another manifestation of the urban-rural divide.
