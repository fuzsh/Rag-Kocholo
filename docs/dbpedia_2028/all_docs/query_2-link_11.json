        "text": "In less than 5 years, together with an incredible team of talented folks, we've built Spotlight PA into an unmatched statewide hub for high-quality investigative and public-service journalism. We now have 120+ newsrooms across the state signed to license agreements to republish our work at no cost, and we saw the power of that network during the recent primary. We produced 42 articles on the primary election, which received more than 350,000 pageviews via more than 200,000 unique users on spotlightpa.org. Together with our partner network, we estimate upwards of 700,000 pageviews and 400,000 unique users on our election content in total, not including the many other forms in which they are published, such as print editions and radio broadcasts. Some of our voter guides had an average engagement time of up to four and a half minutes! In a crowded state attorney general race, we launched an interactive ‚ÄúYour Next AG‚Äù quiz to help voters identify the candidate for attorney general who most aligned with their values and priorities. More than 15,000 people completed the quiz, with an engaged time of more than 3 minutes, and yielding more than 2,000 new newsletter sign-ups. More than 300 people attended our virtual civic engagement events on the election: a live interview with Pa.‚Äôs Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt; a guide to the row races; and an interview with Nick Troiano, author of The Primary Solution, a new book on how partisan primaries are fueling the nation‚Äôs divide and what can be done about it. We also co-hosted a live, in-person ‚ÄúJob Interview‚Äù event for the candidates for state attorney general in Philadelphia in partnership with The Philadelphia Citizen, WURD Radio and 6abc WPVI-TV Philadelphia. We debuted a first-of-its-kind in the nation, AI-powered election chat tool we‚Äôve been developing with support from American Journalism Project to more quickly and directly answer election-related questions and connect readers with our reporting. We opened the tool to a beta test group of 250 Spotlight PA subscribers in the days before the primary and received overwhelming praise and encouragement to continue its development. We plan to make a version of the tool fully public ahead of the November general election. We‚Äôve also been invited to present about it at conferences across the country this summer. Finally, thanks to support from the International Women‚Äôs Media Foundation‚Äôs Newsroom Safety Across America initiative, Spotlight PA brought election reporting safety workshops to 36 reporters and editors in the Harrisburg and Pittsburgh region in partnership with WITF, Inc., LNP | LancasterOnline, and Pittsburgh Media Partnership. I couldn't be more proud of how this team continues to punch above its weight and serve the entire news ecosystem in PA ‚Äî and how the public continues to respond with its support and encouragement. Onwards!\n\nToday is #SolutionsJournalismDay, an occasion to reflect on the importance of creating journalism that tells the whole story through evidenced-based, equitable reporting. Last month, at our 2023 Trust Summit, David Bornstein, co-founder and CEO at Solutions Journalism Network, participated in a panel discussion with other media experts. They talked about the importance of humanizing the government and how federal agencies, media, and other sectors can contribute to rebuilding the public‚Äôs trust by countering harmful narratives about our government and public servants. \"One of the things we found is that humility is a really important part of building trust. There are so many things that people are dealing with now. There's actually a really big opportunity to rebuild trust in journalism and in government by speaking directly to the pain that is out there in the land.\" üìΩÔ∏è Watch the full panel: https://hubs.la/Q026SCt_0"
