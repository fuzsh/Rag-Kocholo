Today we tell about the Pulitzer Prizes. These important yearly awards honor the best in American newspaper reporting, books and the arts.\n\n(MUSIC)\n\nVOICE ONE:\n\nColumbia University in New York City has awarded the Pulitzer Prizes since nineteen-seventeen. The newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer established the prize. Mister Pulitzer was born in Hungary in eighteen-forty-seven. He moved to the United States and settled in Saint Louis, Missouri. He became a newspaper reporter.\n\nIn eighteen-eighty-three, Joseph Pulitzer bought the New York World. Soon it sold more copies than any other newspaper in the country.\n\nVOICE TWO:\n\nMister Pulitzer died in nineteen-eleven. He left two-million dollars to Columbia University. Part of this money was to establish a graduate school of journalism to train reporters. He wanted the rest of the money to be used as prizes for the best writing in the United States.\n\nEach year, judges from around the country choose the best American journalism. They also recognize the best books, drama, poetry and music. This year's winners were announced two weeks ago. They were honored for work done during two-thousand-three.\n\n(MUSIC)\n\nVOICE ONE:\n\nAnthony Shadid of the Washington Post newspaper was in Baghdad, Iraq when he heard that he had won a Pulitzer Prize. Mister Shadid won the international reporting award for his work in Iraq before, during and after the war. The Pulitzer Prize judges praised his ability to describe the conditions and feelings of Iraqis. They noted that he did so while he himself was in danger.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times newspaper, in California, won five Pulitzer Prizes. That was the second largest number ever won by a newspaper.
