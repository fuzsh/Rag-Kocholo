        "text": "This is the best journalism, along with the NY SUN, in that business today. There is no spin, propaganda, or lies. Real game-changing research is the facts. Look where it has led: to a historic injunction against censoring First Amendment free speech by this current administration, never before envisioned but warned of by our founders. Free speech was first on the Bill of Rights; it is more powerful than any man-made weapon.\n\nVocab word of the day: pink slime journalism ü§¢ What is it? Pink slime journalism is named after the pink goo often used as filler in the fast food industry, and it's as unappetizing as it sounds. Pink slime journalism is used by \"networks of local newspapers that deploy algorithmic stories and display a lack of funding transparency as well as a casual attitude to reporting conventions such as bylines or mastheads,\" according to a CJR report. This means journalism that is all about clicks over facts and buzz over real substance. This kind of reporting contributes to our growing political polarization. How? Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/gbdiWrNk #journalist #journalism #media #newspaper #politics #politicstoday\n\nOne interesting aspect of our findings was that people were often clear about distinguishing between the healthcare system, which they tended to describe with disdain, and their individual doctor, who they tended to describe affectionately. One interviewee mentioned that finding an appointment with their physician was a challenge ‚Äúand that it just became very frustrating.‚Äù But in the next breath that person said, ‚ÄúBut I like my primary care doctor.‚Äù There was no equivalent distinction made in journalism. People who described their irritation with the news did not go on to distinguish between the news industry as a whole and the individual journalist with whom they had an established relationship. The exception to this was people‚Äôs affection for television news anchors, especially when those anchors let down their guard a bit by, for example, apologizing on air for reporting errors. ‚ÄúAn apology from a sincere anchor goes a long way,‚Äù one interviewee explained, ‚ÄúIf you identify or feel close somehow to the anchor and they make a sincere apology, you want to accept it because you realize that‚Äôs a hard thing to do.‚Äù In light of our findings, we conclude that two factors are key to building public trust: personal engagement and specialized expertise.\n\nHere's something I wrote that was published recently in the Global Media Journal. I hope it can be of help and is of interest to anyone (especially #journalists and #humanrights researchers)dealing with potentially #disturbingdigitalcontent (e.g., gruesome images, videos) and support in protecting their #mentalwellbeing. It is furthermore intended to shed a light on the topic generally, point out existing research in the field (and respective research gaps) and raise awareness. After all, a lot is at stake - namely the #mentalhealth of individuals working on the 'digital frontline'! Other topical keywords #journalism #gruesomeimagery #disturbingdigitalcontent #eyewitnessmedia #UGC #trauma #PTSD Access to the paper is free!\n\nAll the Free Press Money Can Buy Our free press has dwindled to a pale shadow of greatness. Gone are the times of brave editorials and investigative journalism. Corporate ownership and ad dollars control and dictate content. The 4th branch of government is relegated to an office at the end of the hall between the broom closet and the toilet. News is entertainment and entertainment is the only place to glean a little news. Facts are sought on social media and commentary on obscure blogs. We can rebuild our free press. But first, we must own it. \"We are hindered from saying the things that might correct a democracy that has gone off course. Without a Free Press, we cannot say the things that would keep the nation from falling into the abyss, after the nation reaches its zenith and becomes wealthy and powerful and influential yet corrupt...\"\n\nJournalists report what happens in the world. That‚Äôs what we call the ‚Äònews‚Äô. While news outlets make their own editorial decisions on what to cover and how, big stories like wars and disasters are reported by almost everyone. Over the past few years, the content we had to put out there has drastically gone violent. What we now describe ‚Äòdistressing visuals‚Äô, would have made anyone in any newsroom speechless even six months ago. The normalisation of exposure to onscreen violence has reached such levels that even journalists, who are trained to deal with consuming graphic images, struggle. So much so that secondary trauma cases among journalists have become very common. This is not an, ‚Äòoh, woe is me‚Äô sort of a post. I have recently come across a quote by the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung which goes; ‚ÄòA political situation is the manifestation of a parallel psychological problem in millions of individuals. This problem is largely unconscious (which makes it a particularly dangerous one!)‚Äô *Carl Gustav Jung, Letters, Vol 1: 1906-1950 Which made me think‚Ä¶ If the biggest stories we cover on news get less and less human, and more and more difficult to digest, does that mean we have an even bigger story to report: the collective death of empathy and compassion?"
