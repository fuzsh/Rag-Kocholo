        "text": "Rafael Nadal could hardly have asked for an easier entry into the French Open – two qualifiers to lift his spirits while Novak Djokovic has a far tougher time of it at the other end of the draw. But the real conundrum of the draw ceremony on Thursday night was the surprise appearance of Katie Boulter, only 17 days after announcing her withdrawal.\n\nThere were more than a few gasps when Boulter’s name popped up on the screen against that of Donna Vekic, when it was assumed she was still resting after aggravating a back injury during Great Britain’s Federation Cup win over Kazakhstan in London last month. There was no immediate explanation for her reappearance although it seems she might have left her name in the draw accidentally.\n\nIf so – presuming she has not made a remarkable recovery and does actually play – she will have some explaining to do. As it stands, she will receive about £20,000, half of the first-round prize money, and that will not go down well with the rest of the field.\n\nDefinitely starting is Johanna Konta, who has lost four times on the spin here but has been gifted a qualifier in the first round. However, in the third round she could play Kiki Bertens, whom she beat in the semi-finals in Rome before losing in the final. It would be a fascinating rematch.\n\nThe small British contingent are gathered in the same section of the men’s draw and Cam Norrie has by far the most intriguing opening match, against Nick Kyrgios. The Australian’s latest contributions to tennis have been more verbal than physical and he arrives in Paris having given up an almost certain seeding with his chair-throwing tantrum in Rome. Norrie, who has adapted to clay quickly over the past couple of years, will fancy his chances of an upset against an opponent who admits he often does not try as hard as he should.\n\nThe British No 1, Kyle Edmund, who has lost five matches in a row, plays the Frenchman Jérémy Chardy, never an easy assignment, especially on his home clay. Dan Evans, who has had a storming 12 months to rise 1,000 places in the rankings and is in the main draw by right, does not love the dirt but he should at least give Fernando Verdasco a good argument in the opening round.\n\nChatter about the €350m rebuilding of Court Philippe Chatrier (incomplete but impressive, with the roof to arrive next year, after 90 years as a monument to a French first world war hero) and the new court in the lovely adjoining garden – in memory of the former champion Simonne Mathieu – interrupted the clinking of champagne glasses on a warm summer’s night.\n\nThe minor expansion of the most cramped of the four majors has eased the long-held feeling of suffocation at Roland Garros and will also interest students of art and architecture.\n\nOf more interest to the wider audience, however, is how the championships may play out. There is the return of Roger Federer – who plays the Italian Lorenzo Sonego in the first round – the minor concern over Nadal, who looks in better shape than he did a few weeks ago to win his 12th title, as well as Djokovic, the world No 1 who has the toughest draw of the three.\n\nDjokovic starts against the 22-year-old Pole Hubert Hurkacz – who this year hit a career-high ranking of 36 – and then he is headed for a difficult match against either the resurgent Italian Fabio Fognini or the mercurial Alexander Zverev in the quarters.\n\nNadal, who emerged from his mini-slump to beat Djokovic in the Rome final at the weekend, looks in the mood to do more damage here, the slam that loves him. “I was very pleased with that victory, giving me confidence coming here,” the Spaniard said.\n\nThe three-times winner Serena Williams, who starts against Vitalia Diatchenko, could meet Bianca Andreescu in the third round although the outstanding Canadian teenager has not played for two months because of a shoulder injury.\n\nSimona Halep, the defending champion, who plays Ajla Tomljanovic, said: “I played three finals here, and 2013 was really tough to lose it. It was great to lift this beautiful trophy finally, last year.”The world No 1, Naomi Osaka, whose form has swooped and dipped a few times lately but nevertheless she has won the past two majors, faces Anna-Karolina Schmiedlova.If she is fit and in the mood she will be more concerned about a possible showdown with either Jelena Ostapenko, who won the title here two years ago, or the two-times slam champion Victoria Azarenka, who meet in one of the standout starts to this tournament in recent years."
