        "text": "I need help with MRS Constance Creasey please, post her presumed marriage in 1918.\n\nConstance was born in 1891 in Ely, Cambs, where her father Edmund Serjeant Boulter taught at the choir school. I have her bp & school attendance records & have also traced her in Ely census in 1901 & again in 1911, when she was recorded as a school teacher. So, please don't waste any of your precious time on Constance's early life.\n\nI haven't got the cert (she is only a distant twig) but there is a GRO marriage for Constance Boulter & Frederic G Creasey Q1 1918, Ely reg Dist. I'm pretty sure this will be my Constance because of the location.\n\nI can't find any references for either of them after the marriage. :\n\nConstance's younger sister (teacher at the choir school) Winifred sailed to the US in April 1922 & married there 10 days later. I've found her & her husband in 1930 census, but not in 1940 - They may have returned to England by then??\n\nTwo of the girls' brothers were in Arizona in 1916, so I'm wondering if the Creaseys eventually went there too?\n\nThanks for reading and any help gratefully received.\n\nJay\n\nHi girls - sorry, had a friend call so only just got back to the forum.\n\nThere's also a death reg for Constance Creasy, died 1974 Colchester, Essex - born c 1900.\n\nI am concerned about the differences between apparent years of birth, because this family were literate & numerate and all other family members are never more than a year out in all the records I've found. It's as if they know their exact year of birth and can calculate their age correctly.\n\nI'm not getting anywhere with Frederic G Creasey either.\n\nHowever, I don't see another Creasey/Boulter marriage, so it looks like Dennis probably did belong to the Constance Boulter & Frederick Creasey marriage. But, what happened to Frederic G? Where did he come from, where did he go?\n\nJay\n\nVal, you're a star for mentioning wills & the father dying in Essex.;D\n\nThat jogged me into going back through old notes about the father and family to find out if any of his other children had an Essex connection. The son who didn't emigrate (Henry) never married, lived in Essex and was a market gardener. Henry died in Clacton on sea in Jan 1952 and probate was granted to Constance Creasey widow The father died at the same address in Clacton, in 1954 and probate of his estate was granted to Isabelle Boulter, spinster. She was his grand-daughter, only child of one of the sons who went to Canada and then moved to California. As an aside, I've found out today from an American newspaper (accessible through the FMP weekend) that this son committed suicide by jumping off a liner on which he his wife and child were cruising.\n\nSo, I think that proves that the Constance Boulter/Frederick Creasy marriage is the right one and that Frederic had died by 1952.\n\nIf Constance had no children, perhaps Isabelle registered her death and didn't know how old her aunt was ?"
