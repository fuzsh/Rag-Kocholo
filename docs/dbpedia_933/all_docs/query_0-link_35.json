        "text": "Sir John Cutler, 1st Baronet (1603–1693) was an English grocer, financier and Member of Parliament.\n\nHe was the 2nd son of Edward Cutler, Salter, of London. He became a successful grocer who also participated in land speculation, acquiring the combined Gawthorpe and Harewood Castle estates in Yorkshire in 1656. He was knighted in 1660 and created a baronet (of London) later the same year. He was Master of the Worshipful Company of Grocers of the City of London four times and became a councilman and alderman of the city of London. He paid for much of the rebuilding of Grocers' Hall after the Great Fire of London of 1666.\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1664.\n\nHe served as High Sheriff of Kent in 1676. He was Member of Parliament for Taunton 1679–80 and for Bodmin 1689–93. He was Treasurer for the building of St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nLate in life he bought Wimpole Hall estate in Cambridgeshire from Thomas Chicheley."
