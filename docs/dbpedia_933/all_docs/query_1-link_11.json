        "text": "Boulter History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe origins of the Boulter surname lie with the Anglo-Saxon tribes of Britain. The name Boulter began when someone in that family worked as a sifter of meal. Other evidence suggests that the surname Boulter was established as an area called Boulder. From there people acquired the surname. The name is also derived from the Old English word bulder which means boulder or cobblestone. Alternatively the name could have been derived from the word bolter which was a miller. Boulter's Lock and Boutler's Island are both located on the River Thames on the eastern side of Maidenhead, Berkshire.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Boulter family\n\nThe surname Boulter was first found in Yorkshire, where they held a family seat from ancient times, long before the Norman Conquest in 1066.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Boulter family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Boulter research. Another 33 words (2 lines of text) covering the years 1272, 1635, 1671, 1672, 1694, 1698, 1701, 1709, 1719, 1724 and 1742 are included under the topic Early Boulter History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nBoulter Spelling Variations\n\nOne relatively recent invention that did much to standardize English spelling was the printing press. However, before its invention even the most literate people recorded their names according to sound rather than spelling. The spelling variations under which the name Boulter has appeared include Boulter, Bolter, Boulder, Bolteir and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Boulter family\n\nDistinguished members of the family include\n\nEdmund Boulter (c.1635-1709), a London merchant and politician, Sheriff of London (1694)\n\nEdmund Boulter (c. 1635-1709), a London merchant and politician, Sheriff of London in July 1694, Member of Parliament for Boston (1698-1701)\n\nMigration of the Boulter family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Boulter family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt. More information about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nBoulter migration to the United States +\n\nAt this time, the shores of the New World beckoned many English families that felt that the social climate in England was oppressive and lacked opportunity for change. Thousands left England at great expense in ships that were overcrowded and full of disease. A great portion of these settlers never survived the journey and even a greater number arrived sick, starving, and without a penny. The survivors, however, were often greeted with greater opportunity than they could have experienced back home. These English settlers made significant contributions to those colonies that would eventually become the United States and Canada. An examination of early immigration records and passenger ship lists revealed that people bearing the name Boulter arrived in North America very early:\n\nBoulter Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nNathanial Boulter who settled in Hampton New Hampshire in 1630\n\nIsaac Boulter, who arrived in Maryland in 1679 1\n\nNathaniel Boulter, who arrived in Hampton, NH in 1685 1\n\nBoulter Settlers in United States in the 18th Century\n\nWilliam Boulter, who settled in New England in 1748\n\nBoulter Settlers in United States in the 19th Century\n\nJames Boulter, who landed in Texas in 1835 1\n\nBoulter migration to Australia +\n\nEmigration to Australia followed the First Fleets of convicts, tradespeople and early settlers.

By 1838, the British New Zealand Company had begun buying land from the Maori tribes, and selling it to settlers, and, after the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, many British families set out on the arduous six month journey from Britain to Aotearoa to start a new life.
