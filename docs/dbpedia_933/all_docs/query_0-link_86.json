        "text": "Edmund is looking to reach the third round of Wimbledon for the first time but his run to the semi-final of the Australian Open earlier this year has helped propel him up to a career-high No 17 in the rankings.\n\nWith Andy Murray out injured, the 23-year-old carries the hopes of the nation on his back but Djokovic appears confident that he can cope with pressure of expectation thanks to his coach Rosengren.\n\n“Ever since he started working with a new coach that I've known for years, because he worked with Mario Ancic and [fellow Swede, Robin] Soderling, he's known as a very good coach, has that professionalism, discipline,” Djokovic said of the man Edmund hired permanently in October last year.\n\n“I think Kyle and him are a great fit. Kyle is very devoted.\n\n“He has very good ethics, a hard worker, puts in the hours necessary on the court and in the gym to get himself to best possible shape.\n\n“You can see the results are showing that their work is very beneficial for Kyle.\n\n“He's top-20 player of the world. He's going towards the top 10.\n\n“He won against me this year in Madrid. He won against Dimitrov. Reached semis of Australian Open. He certainly has the capacity and the quality to compete at the highest level.\n\n“If I get to play him, probably is going to be one of the two big courts.\n\n“He's a hometown favourite now that Murray is not here. There's a lot of expectations and pressure on his back.\n\n“But he's handling it pretty well so far.”\n\nKyle Edmund beats Gregor Dimitrov in Australian Open QFs\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
