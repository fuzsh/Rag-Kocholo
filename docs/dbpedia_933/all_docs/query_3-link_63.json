        "text": "Johanna Konta has crashed out of Wimbledon today, when she was the last British woman left in the competition, leaving Kyle Edmund as the country's only hope.\n\nThe 27-year-old was in action on Centre Court against Slovakian Dominika Cibulkova hoping to keep smiles on the fans' faces after fellow Brit Katie Boulder was eliminated earlier today.\n\nThe 21-year-old rising star fought bravely against number 18 seed Naomi Osaka but was defeated in straight sets, despite strong support from her faithful fans. British number one Kyle Edmund is on Centre Court this evening, taking on American Bradley Klahn.\n\nPlenty of famous faces are at the grounds today including Pippa and James Middleton, Evening Standard editor George Osborne and wife Frances and former England Cricket Captain Alastair Cook with wife Alice.\n\nAfter a downpour last night, which caused several matches to be abandoned late on, more showers are predicted today.\n\nIt could mean the return of the £100million Centre Court roof, which was not used yesterday to the anger of many fans who wanted to see play continue.\n\nThunderstorms could even strike this evening and disrupt the schedule further.\n\nThe inclement weather is no surprise for the Wimbledon faithful but comes after a long heatwave, with sunny skies and warm temperatures set to return tomorrow.\n\nMeanwhile Boulter said she was hoping to emulate her beloved Leicester City before the match against Osaka and thanked her hometown fans for their support.\n\nBoulter said: 'When Leicester won the Premier League I feel like everyone had a massive lift in the city, and I feel like I was one of those people.\n\n'It was a little bit of magic and hopefully I can do something out there tomorrow. I have had some lovely messages from a lot of people from Leicester. I'm always proud to support the Foxes.'\n\nBoulter has been playing tennis since age four and credits beating her brother for the first time as what sparked her passion.\n\nShe also comes from an inventive family, with grandfather Brian Gartshore credited with creating the anti-theft tag that stops shoplifters stealing clothes.\n\nFellow Brit Katie Swan, 19, who was knocked out of the second round yesterday and plays doubles with Boulter, praised her partner and said the future of women's tennis in Britain was bright.\n\nSwan said: 'She's been doing so well and I think a lot of the British girls have, so it's great to see. And we are all pushing each other and everyone wants to keep getting better. I think we're all going to start seeing each other at these bigger tournaments. That's pretty exciting.'\n\nKyle Edmund and Johanna Konta have loftier expectations these days and both will hope to reach round three, Edmund for the first time.\n\nHe takes on American qualifier Bradley Klahn while Konta faces a potentially tricky clash with former Australian Open finalist Dominika Cibulkova, with both matches on Centre Court.\n\nKonta has also been leading the environmental charge at Wimbledon, after telling Sky she refuses to use plastic bottles amid criticism of the amount of litter at the tournament.\n\nShe said: 'In terms of water bottles and things like that, I personally don't have water bottles at home.\n\n'I have a filtration system. I have glass containers which I then put in the fridge. I try not to use plastic bags or anything like that.'\n\nKonta, 27, added: 'I think it's a battle that everyone is facing. I'm a big fan of looking after our planet because we've only got one.'\n\nIt came after tennis coach Sascha Bajin tweeted a picture of plastic bottles littered across a practice court, meaning they could only have been left by players or coaches.\n\nHe wrote: 'Dear players/coaches @Wimbledon it’s not to hard to take your empty water bottles and throw them away after practise.\n\n'The grounds people are supposed to take care of the court and not clean trash. Maybe the club could provide a trash can for every 2nd court tho as well. #justsayin'\n\nMeanwhile Venus Williams said she was 'overjoyed' that Wimbledon organisers gave women the spotlight on the tournament's main showcourts on Wednesday, following a sexism row after organisers said they would not consider switching the men's and women's finals to have female players close the tournament.\n\nFive of the seven matches on Centre Court and Court One on day three were women's singles, although one of them was a late change after the Centre Court programme ended early.\n\nIt did not escape the attention of five-time champion Williams, who beat Romanian qualifier Alexandra Dulgheru on Court One to move into the third round.\n\n'I was really overjoyed when I saw the schedule for today. We have a lot of equal play on the main courts in the other three grand slams,' the American veteran said.\n\n'It was just fantastic to see Wimbledon also follow suit. It's wonderful to hopefully have that continue, to have equal for the men and the women.'\n\nWimbledon has come under fire in the past for sending top women's seeds, including Venus and sister Serena, out to the smaller courts.\n\nWhile the club said there has not been a change in policy women's matches have outnumbered men's on the biggest courts so far at this year's tournament.\n\nHer sister and seven-times champion Serena beat Bulgarian qualifier Viktoriya Tomova on Centre Court on Wednesday, having opened on Monday against Arantxa Rus on Court One.\n\nShe echoed her sister's sentiments.\n\n'I think it's wonderful,' she said. 'For so many years it was just two men's, one women's.\n\n'Now it's several women out there playing. I think it's a great opportunity. Just really proud to be here and play at a tournament that can recognise that.'"
