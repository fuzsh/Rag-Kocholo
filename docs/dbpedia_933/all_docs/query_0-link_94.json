I was amazed to find your post. I could have written one exactly like it! I am descended from Thomas's daughter Phoebe, who married Neil MacKinnon in New Brunswick. I just borrowed microfilm from the Canadian Natl Archives with the 74th Regt info on it, and I'm waiting for some land petition/grant documents which I ordered from the Archives in New Brunswick. After seeing the military record, I'm now certain that our Thomas is the Thomas born to George & Frances in Thrussington. Would enjoy exchanging info. This is my first time on this forum. Does it give you my email address? -Gayle\n\nHi gayle1947\n\nI think that I'm correct that your email addresses are not available to other ordinary members of the forum to protect you from spam and other more malicious forms of hacking. I suggest that you use the PM facility of the forum to contact intaglio privately. Good luck with your searches\n\ncheers\n\nBob,\n\nHaven't been able to establish any siblings for Thomas yet, and I think there were a number of Boulters in the Leicester/Thrussington area, but maybe at some point a connection between William and Thomas might show up. Thank you for passing along the information.\n\nA.\n\nAll records from Holy Trinity church, Thrussington, Leicestershire\n\nGeorge M Baptism Date 03 Oct 1782 - Son of George and Frances Boulter\n\n* M Baptism Date 18 Feb 1784 - Son of George and Frances Boulter\n\nJohn M Burial Date 25 Feb 1784 - Son of George and Frances Boulter\n\nJohn M Baptism Date 25 Jan 1785 - Son of George and Frances Boulter\n\nElizabeth F Baptism Date 04 Feb 1787 - Daughter of George and Frances Boulter\n\nWilliam M Baptism Date 18 Jan 1789 - Son of George and Frances Boulter\n\nThomas M Baptism Date 11 Mar 1792 - Son of George and Frances Boulter\n\nThos Infant.

There is the whole family of their children listed, which is SO helpful. I see that Thomas did indeed have a brother named William, although not the William that Bob mentioned.\n\nThank you again for your valuable assistance. It will help to flesh out this line of our family more thoroughly!\n\nBest,\n\nAnn"
