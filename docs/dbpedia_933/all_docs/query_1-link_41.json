        "text": "Kyle Edmund and Alex Ward were two of 12 Brits to start in the main draw at Wimbledon, with seven men and five women - and they were playing each other.\n\nIt is just the second time since 2007 Wimbledon that as many as 12 British players have featured in the main draw at a Grand Slam.\n\nElsewhere, Katie Boulter, James Ward and Bryden Klein are all in action too.\n\nKYLE EDMUND v ALEX WARD (4-6 6-3 6-2 6-1)\n\nKyle Edmund overcame an early wobble to book his place in the second round of Wimbledon for the first time ever with a win over Alex Ward.\n\nEdmund started the week as British No2 and ranked 50th in the world and could hardly have asked for a better draw at Wimbledon.\n\nWard, who has battled wrist tendon injuries, has sunk to 869 in the world and never won a Tour-level match.\n\nThat didn't stop him taking the opening set but that was as good as it got as Edmund stormed back to win.\n\nEdmund will play Gael Monfils or Daniel Brands in round two.\n\nJAMES WARD v Marcos Baghdatis\n\nJames Ward failed to cause an upset in the first round against Marcos Baghdatis at Wimbledon 2017.\n\nWard made it to the third round back in 2015 but has dropped out of the top 1000 in the world this year.\n\nAnd Baghdatis, a one-time Australian Open finallist made short work of the Brit, dispatching him 6-4, 6-4, 6-3.\n\nBRYDAN KLEIN v Yiuchi Sugita\n\nBrydan Klein had to call the trainer multiple times during his defeat to Yuichi Sugita and succumbed to a convincing defeat in the first round of Wimbledon 2017.\n\nKlein appeared to have problems with his feet and looked in some discomfort as he changed his socks and redressed what appeared to be his stricken toes.\n\nThe first set against Sugita had been tight but the Japanese player triumphed 7-5 in the tie-break.\n\nVictory was more covincing in the second set and by the third Klein appeared unable to compete, failing to win a game to go down 7-6, 6-3, 6-0.\n\nKATIE BOULTER v Christina McHale\n\nKatie Boulter's Wimbledon ended sadly after a brave battle against Christina McHale.\n\nThe Leicester City fan British girl, ranked 238 in the world, crashed out 6-3, 5-7, 3-6.\n\nBoulter, 20, surprised the American in a hard-hitting first set as she broke to go 2-0 up. McHale fought back in the second set and roared into a 4-1 lead, but Boulter rediscovered her fire to draw level at 5-5. Then though she wobbled again to allow McHale to take the set.\n\nOnce again Boulter started the third set well, racing into a 2-0 lead, but once again allowed her opponent back into the match and found herself 2-4 down. This time there was no coming back as the experienced McHale held her nerve to clinch the match."
