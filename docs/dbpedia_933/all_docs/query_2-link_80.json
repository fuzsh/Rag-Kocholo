        "text": "Edmund doesn't hide his allegiance to all things Three Lions but insists his only focus will be on three-time champion Novak Djokovic in Wimbledon's third round this weekend.\n\nThe British number one had never won a match here before last year but has confidently beaten both his opponents so far, American qualifier Bradley Klahn, 6-4, 7-6, 7-2 routinely despatched in double quick time.\n\nOn his least favoured surface it would be foolish and premature to suggest anything was â€˜coming home' for the world number 17 but he is at least starting to feel at home on these manicured lawns.\n\nOnly twice in the last 28 years has a British singles player failed to reach the third round at their home Slam - and Edmund walked on court as the last man standing, after Jo Konta and Katie Boulter's defeats earlier in the day.\n\nBut, in the absence of Andy Murray, he's rapidly grown used to his new status as the sole standard bearer, underlined by his run to the semi-finals of the Australian Open earlier this year.\n\nAnd he duly booked his place in the third round at the All England Club for the first time with a straightforward and straight sets win over a clearly overawed Klahn.\n\n\"It's only the second time I've played on Centre Court and it's the first time I've won and that's very special and something I'll always remember,\" said Edmund.\n\n\"I broke him in the first game and that helped ease the nerves. I was just too tentative in the second set but I played a great tie-breaker and then I relaxed into it and I really controlled my service games, which is pleasing.\n\n\"It doesn't get any easier. Novak is one of the best players of all-time and he's obviously very dangerous and playing really well.\n\n\"I beat him in our last match and that gives you belief and it's mentally a good thing. As you play more and more matches on the big stage you feel more comfortable and learn something about yourself each time.\n\n\"It's still all new, you go from being a kid dreaming about matches like this and it can seem a bit surreal. But I believe in myself and there's a reason I'm there.\n\n\"It will just be a great experience but I know winning means excitement and anticipation and I accept that.\n\n\"Hopefully it will be a successful weekend for England and myself, I hope I get to watch the match but I'm a tennis player and this is my focus.\"\n\nDjokovic - who seems to be recovering his form in recent weeks having dropped outside the world's top 20 - looked to be nursing a knee injury during his 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 win over Horacio Zeballos, achieved in just 91 minutes.\n\nBut he still banged down 15 aces, dropped just 12 points on serve and swatted aside all three break points he faced - ominous stats for Edmund.\n\nAnd he knows the 23-year old Brit - who is coached by his close friend Freddie Rosengren - will be a much tougher test.\n\nThe pair have met four times, with Djokovic winning three but losing their last encounter on clay at the Madrid Masters earlier this year.\n\n\"The knee is nothing major, or I'd be pulling out of the tournament,\" said Djokovic.\n\n\"I've known Freddie for years and he's a very good coach, he will install that professionalism and discipline and it's a great fit for Kyle.\n\n\"He's pushing towards the top ten in the world, he obviously has the capacity and quality to compete at the very highest level.\n\n\"With Andy not here, he's the hometown favourite. There's lots of expectation and pressure but it seems to be handling it.\""
