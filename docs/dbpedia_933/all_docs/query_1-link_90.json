        "text": "Wimbledon is one of the best British sporting events each year, and there are plenty of top homegrown competitors involved this summer.\n\nBritish No.1 Jack Draper recently beat Carlos Alcaraz at Queen's, and he'll be hoping for a big tournament.\n\nFormer US Open champion Emma Raducanu is also back from a year of injury hell and will be hoping to star as a wildcard at SW19.\n\nBritish No.1 Katie Boulter will also be looking to go far in south London.\n\nTwo-time champion Andy Murray will be in action as well in what would be his Wimbledon farewell.\n\nThe draw has now been made and there's some mouth-watering matchups.\n\nJack Draper\n\nOf all the Brits at Wimbledon this year, Draper represents Britain's best chance of success.\n\nHe's recently overtaken Cameron Norrie as Britain's number one and is seeded for the competition.\n\nThe 22-year-old missed out last year due to injury, but since then, he's climbed into the top 30 for the first time.\n\nHe also won his first ATP event in Stuttgart earlier this year, so now he has experience of winning things.\n\nIt is his first time being seeded and he faces Sweden's Elias Ymer.\n\nAndy Murray\n\nMurray might not be the force he once was, but he's still one of the best Brits at Wimbledon and is arguably Britain's greatest tennis player.\n\nHe has experienced extreme highs and lows at Wimbledon in the past, and he'll be hoping for one more memorable tournament.\n\nInjuries have hit Murray hard as his career has progressed, and with retirement now looming, this could very well be his last run out a SW19.\n\nBut if it is, we can all look back at those magical moments he has provided with great fondness.\n\nOf course, he did retire hurt during Queen's, so we need to see if he's going to be fit enough.\n\nHe is still in the draw, however, and is due to face Tomas Machac in the first round on Tuesday.\n\nMurray is also planning to play the doubles with brother Jamie.\n\nCameron Norrie\n\nNorrie was Britain's Men's No.1 for a long time, but he's been usurped by Draper.\n\nOf course, he made the semi-finals of 2022's Wimbledon, where he was beaten by Novak Djokovic.\n\nThe Serbian lost the first set but then came back and showed his class to overcome Norrie.\n\nSince then, the Brit hasn't enjoyed too much success, but he's still a quality player and will be hoping to find those 2022 levels.\n\nHe will face Facundo Diaz Acosta in the first round and then could face fellow Brit Draper in the second round.\n\nKatie Boulter\n\nBoulter is also heading into Wimbledon as a seeded player.\n\nThe 27-year-old is ranked number 32 in the world and retained her WTA title in Nottingham earlier this year.\n\nUnfortunately, she hasn't performed too well at Wimbledon in the past, but she is currently in the form of her life.\n\nCertainly, Boulter will be hoping to go far. She is facing Germany’s Tatjana Maria.\n\nEmma Raducanu\n\nRaducanu is going to be at Wimbledon this year as a wildcard entry.\n\nThe former US Open Women's champion has endured some horrible injuries since winning her one grand slam.\n\nBut she's now back and raring to go and will no doubt be a popular competitor.\n\nRaducanu's career has somewhat stagnated since she burst onto the scene with that stunning US Open win, but a good run at Wimbledon could be exactly what she needs.\n\nShe faces Russian 22nd seed Ekaterina Alexandrova in a tough first round draw.\n\n\"If I get through my first round, I'd be over the moon,\" said Raducanu.\n\n\"I think it's a tough match. She's seeded really well. It's obviously going to be hard. I think that she's got great weapons. On this surface, it only amplifies big weapons.\n\n\"I'm expecting a really difficult match. I think it's a match where I'm actually the complete underdog because she's a lot older, a lot more experienced, ranked a lot higher.\n\n\"I feel like it's just a great opportunity to try to get a good scalp, try to enjoy playing how I have been in the last few weeks, and just get back into it.\""
