        "text": "Bulter History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe name Bulter is Anglo-Saxon in origin. It was a name given to a sifter of meal. Other evidence suggests that the surname Bulter was established as an area called Boulder. From there people acquired the surname. The name is also derived from the Old English word bulder which means boulder or cobblestone. Alternatively the name could have been derived from the word bolter which was a miller. Boulter's Lock and Boutler's Island are both located on the River Thames on the eastern side of Maidenhead, Berkshire.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Bulter family\n\nThe surname Bulter was first found in Yorkshire, where they held a family seat from ancient times, long before the Norman Conquest in 1066.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Bulter family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Bulter research.

Although the search for opportunity and freedom from persecution abroad took the lives of many because of the cramped conditions and unsanitary nature of the vessels, the opportunity perceived in the growing colonies of North America beckoned. Many of the settlers who survived the journey went on to make important contributions to the transplanted cultures of their adopted countries. The Bulter were among these contributors, for they have been located in early North American records:\n\nBulter Settlers in United States in the 19th Century\n\nJoh Heinr Bulter, aged 33, who landed in America in 1813-1820 2\n\nJoh Jos Bulter, aged 30, who landed in America in 1813-1820 2\n\nEdward Bulter, aged 27, who arrived in Missouri in 1840 2\n\nBernh Bulter, who arrived in America in 1841 2\n\nChristoph Bulter, who landed in Cincinnati, Oh in 1842 2\n\nBulter migration to New Zealand +\n\nEmigration to New Zealand followed in the footsteps of the European explorers, such as Captain Cook (1769-70): first came sealers, whalers, missionaries, and traders.
