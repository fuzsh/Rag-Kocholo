        "text": "For the past week, some of tennis’s best-known gladiators have been crossing swords at Perth’s Hopman Cup. The exhibition event – which has mixed doubles at its heart – featured four Wimbledon champions in Roger Federer, Serena Williams, Angelique Kerber and Garbine Muguruza, plus a number of emerging talents. One of them was Katie Boulter, the British No 3.\n\nWe will come to the results later, but simply to be playing in Perth is a huge achievement for Boulter. Here is a woman who, only four years ago, could barely drag herself out of bed to use the bathroom. She is a survivor of chronic fatigue syndrome: a little-understood condition that has ended many athletic careers. In the view of her mother Sue, the exhaustion was triggered by an ill-fated trip to India in December 2014, where she contracted a virus. By the early weeks of 2015, she was in a terrible state. “I got to the point where I was pretty much doing nothing during the day,” Boulter told The Daily Telegraph. “I was in bed. I would go for walks and that was my daily activity.\n\n“It wasn’t necessarily from India that I was ill. It was a period of time over the years and it accumulated. Honestly, I think those years I got sick a lot. I just wasn’t in tune with my body. It’s very easy to be generic and do what everyone else does and what’s expected of you. But I didn’t know what my boundaries were.\n\n“It took so long because I got misdiagnosed initially. That’s why it took a full year [to get back on the court] instead of maybe six months. I think at this point I am much smarter, and I choose my battles – when I push it and when I don’t. And back then I would probably have gone through all barriers and kept going until I was a little bit too run down.”\n\nDuring this frightening period, Boulter relied on the Lawn Tennis Association’s guidance. She had always been the outstanding player of her age group, a precocious talent who won the first tournament she entered – the Leicestershire under-10s – at the age of five. Since her early teens, she had trained at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton, south-west London, under the seasoned direction of Nigel Sears.\n\n“You can look at it as a handicap,” said Boulter of her truncated training schedule, “or you can look at it in different ways. I put absolutely everything into the period of time that I have. It’s quality rather than quantity. There are many top players who have only hit once a day through their whole career and have made use of it and have been world No 1 or whatever. It just depends on the person. But I am looking forward to this year, where I am going to be putting a lot more effort into two [practice sessions] a day and the physicality. That’s where the game is going nowadays.\n\n“I just reflect what my body reflects,” said Boulter, who uses a fitness tracker called Whoop to assess her physical state. “I do what I can, I take it day by day, I try not to think too much about the future, and where I might be six months down the line.”\n\nIf Boulter’s body looks a little frail to the naked eye, it may be the result of her narrow waist and unusually long legs, which could have put her on the catwalk in another life. As it is, she made her debut on the front page of the Daily Mail two summers ago – while still ranked only 238 in the world – and has since starred in a modelling campaign for Nike and a Vogue interview.\n\nBoulter’s commercial potential is reflected in her recent signing by KIN Partners – a boutique management agency based in central London. David Beckham’s long-time spokesman, Simon Oliveira, who also looked after Andy Murray in the early stages of his career, is one of the partners, and the clients include Beckham and Brazilian superstar Neymar.\n\nTennis has always been central to the Boulter family. Sue was a junior British international who twice captained Leicestershire to the County Cup. She supplied her daughter’s technique, but not her height, which allows Katie to look down on both her parents. That rangy 5ft 11in frame enables an aggressive, first-strike game, based around a big serve and a booming forehand, even if it can also limit Boulter’s mobility. She credits the work of LTA strength and conditioning coach Conor McGoldrick, who joined her on tour in March, for putting extra strength into her legs and allowing her competitive drive to come through.\n\n“When Katie was tiny, she would be waiting at the side of the court while I was coaching, desperate to have a go,” said Sue Boulter, who brought her two children up within lobbing distance of Leicestershire Lawn Tennis Club.\n\n“That’s how she came to enter the Under-10s event: it wasn’t planned. I’ve still got a photo of the presentation: the other girl is giving her a glare, thinking, ‘How did I lose to this small person?’ But Katie is just grinning into the camera, as happy as you could be.”\n\nBoulter’s elder brother James also played to a high level. He now works in public relations and advised Serena Williams when she visited the UK for last year’s royal wedding. But it is Boulter’s grandfather – an inventor who helped to develop the alarm-triggering retail tags used in clothing stores – that she particularly enjoys talking about.\n\n“He is literally my idol, someone I look up to,” she says of Brian Gartshore. “He put down the airfield lights at Gatwick and Heathrow, he is a pretty damn smart guy. And we have some really great conversations about absolutely nothing to do with tennis. It’s just a nice little getaway.”\n\nBoulter’s parents are divorced, but Sue travels almost everywhere with her, as part of a support network that this year includes a dedicated coach – former British No 1 Jeremy Bates – for the first time. Bates has sacrificed his role as the LTA’s head of women’s tennis to guide her.\n\nIn Perth, Boulter lost all three singles matches against higher-ranked opponents – Maria Sakkari of Greece, Belinda Bencic of Switzerland (an old friend and rival from junior days), and finally Serena Williams. But she performed creditably and also won two of three mixed-doubles rubbers alongside her partner Cameron Norrie. Her Instagram page is full of backstage moments: Boulter catching the ferry to Fremantle, posing in the ball gown she wore to the player party, and performing a group interview alongside Federer.\n\n“Sharing the court with Roger was a surreal feeling,” Boulter told The Daily Telegraph last week, “and receiving his serve isn’t something I ever thought would happen in my career. I actually hit him with a volley, which was a bit awkward, but he took it in good spirits!\n\n“It was a privilege just to be there, and the same with Serena: she has been an idol of mine growing up. I was pleased with my performance [in a 6-1, 7-6 defeat] but a little disappointed I didn’t take the second set after getting a break of serve. I should have taken it to a decider.”\n\nNow the Boulter entourage will move on to Melbourne, where a world ranking of 97 has earned her direct entry to a grand slam for the first time."
