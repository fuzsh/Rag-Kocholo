        "text": "There were flying ants and female seeds – including world No.2 Caroline Wozniacki – dropping like flies on Day 3 at Wimbledon. There was even the first rain.\n\nBoth British No.1s and Rafa Nadal top the bill on Centre Court on Thursday - and Katie Boulter is also in action.\n\nThe last three British players left in the singles are back in action:\n\nJo Konta v world No.33 Dominika Cibulkova\n\nThe Slovak was ranked No.32 last month when the Wimbledon seedings were announced but missed out on a protected route through the first two rounds when Serena Willams was seeded No.25.\n\nThe American supestar is ranked world No.181 after her maternity leave. But her record of winning seven titles here has seen her seeded No.25 - with then world No.32 Dominika Cibulkova bumped out. Konta faces the Slovakian, twice a Wimbledon quarter-finalist, in the second round today.\n\nSpeaking at the French Open, Konta said it would be unfair to penalise players who had earned a top 32 rankings – and said Kim Clijsters had returned to the game without additional help. “I think seeding is on a player’s current form,” she said.\n\nCibulkova said: “I am not making my mind busy with this. I am playing Konta, so I will try my best.”\n\nKyle Edmund v world No. 168 Bradley Klahn\n\nThe British No.1 won just his second Wimbledon singles match in the first round and should make it a hat-trick today to set up a Saturday clash with Novak Djokovic.\n\nHe faces American qualifier Klahn who shocked Japan's Yuichi Sugita in the first round.\n\nEdmund's Swedish coach Fredrik Rosengren said: “I was very surprised. I think something was wrong with Sugita because he is actually a great grass-court player. I was afraid of that one, he is a tough player.\n\n\"Klahn won easily but I think he is pretty much the same guy as yesterday. Serving the same, playing the same, with small differences. He’s a lefty, he serves the same. I said to him he’s a copy. This is good because we have preparing two days for Bolt so we don’t need to change too much for the second round.\n\n\"The practice today was fantastic. He made an unbelievably good practice. He kept the energy, he kept the intensity, because it was not too long yesterday. So you can use a lot energy today to do good practice, to keep up the speed.”\n\nKatie Boulter v world No.18 Naomi Osaka\n\nThe US-based Japanese star won her first WTA title at Indian Wells in March and thrashed the British No.3 in 46 minutes in Birmingham last month. This is the first match on Court 2 at 11.30am.\n\nHer doubles partner Katie Swan gave her some valuable advice after losing her second round match yesterday.\n\n“It would help if you don't lose the first set 6-love - that would be a good start,” said the teenager who went down 6-0 6-3 to the Romanian No.29 seed Mihaela Buzarnescu yesterday.\n\n“Katie is playing a great player tomorrow and she's got no pressure. I'd say just go out and enjoy it and swing freely. At the same time go in with the belief that you can win, because I don't think we're too far off these girls. You never know.”\n\nOthers:\n\nNovak Djokovic, who is slowly returning to form after elbow surgery, can set up a clash with Edmund by beating Horacio Zeballos.\n\nWorld No.1 Rafa Nadal plays the opening match on Centre Court against Mikhail Kukushkin.\n\nEugenie Bouchard is back in action – this time against Aussie No.17 seed Ashleigh Barty\n\nAnd three-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka faces a battle to come from two sets down against Italian Thomas Fabbiano."
