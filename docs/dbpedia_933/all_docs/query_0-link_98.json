        "text": "The US announcement followed calls from multiple governments, including close allies of Mr Maduro, for Venezuela’s National Electoral Council to release detailed vote counts, as it has done during previous elections.\n\nThe electoral body declared Mr Maduro the winner on Monday, but the main opposition coalition revealed hours later that it had evidence to the contrary in the form of more than two-thirds of the tally sheets that each electronic voting machine printed after polls closed.\n\n“Given the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo González Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela’s July 28 presidential election,” US secretary of state Antony Blinken said in a statement.\n\nMr Maduro responded with a quick admonishment: “The United States needs to keep its nose out of Venezuela!”\n\nThe US government announcement came amid diplomatic efforts to persuade Mr Maduro to release vote tallies from the election and increasing calls for an independent review of the results, according to officials from Brazil and Mexico.\n\nGovernment officials from Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico have been in constant communication with Mr Maduro’s administration to convince him that he must show the vote tally sheets from Sunday’s election and allow impartial verification, a Brazilian government official told The Associated Press on Thursday.\n\nThe officials have told Venezuela’s government that showing the data is the only way to dispel any doubt about the results, said the Brazilian official, who was not authorised to speak publicly about the diplomatic efforts and requested anonymity.\n\nA Mexican official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity for the same reason, confirmed the three governments have been discussing the issue with Venezuela but did not provide details.\n\nEarlier, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he planned to speak with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil and President Gustavo Petro of Colombia, and that his government believes it is important that the electoral tallies be made public.\n\nLater on Thursday, the governments of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico issued a joint statement calling on Venezuela’s electoral authorities “to move forward expeditiously and publicly release” detailed voting data, but they did not confirm any backroom diplomatic efforts to persuade Mr Maduro’s government to publish the vote tallies.\n\n“The fundamental principle of popular sovereignty must be respected through impartial verification of the results,” they said in the statement.\n\nOn Monday, after the National Electoral Council declared Mr Maduro the winner of the election, thousands of opposition supporters took to the streets.\n\nThe government said it arrested hundreds of protesters and Venezuela-based human rights organisation Foro Penal said 11 people were killed.\n\nDozens more were arrested the following day, including a former opposition candidate, Freddy Superlano.\n\nOpposition leader Maria Corina Machado — who was barred from running for president — and Mr Gonzalez addressed a huge rally of their supporters in the capital, Caracas, on Tuesday, but they have not been seen in public since.\n\nLater that day, the president of the National Assembly, Jorge Rodriguez, called for their arrest, calling them criminals and fascists.\n\nIn an op-ed published on Thursday in the Wall Street Journal, Ms Machado said she is “hiding, fearing for my life, my freedom, and that of my fellow countrymen”.\n\nShe reasserted that the opposition has physical evidence that Mr Maduro lost the election and urged the international community to intervene.\n\n“We have voted Mr Maduro out,” she wrote. “Now it is up to the international community to decide whether to tolerate a demonstrably illegitimate government.”\n\nGovernment repression over the years has pushed opposition leaders into exile. After the op-ed was published, Mr Machado’s team told the AP that she was “sheltering”.\n\nMr Machado later posted a video on social media calling on supporters to gather on Saturday across the country.\n\nThe Gonzalez campaign had no comment on the op-ed.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Maduro asked Venezuela’s highest court to conduct an audit of the election, but that request drew almost immediate criticism from foreign observers who said the court is too close to the government to produce an independent review.\n\nVenezuela’s Supreme Tribunal of Justice is closely aligned with Mr Maduro’s government.\n\nThe court’s justices are nominated by federal officials and ratified by the National Assembly, which Mr Maduro’s sympathisers dominate.\n\nOn Thursday, the court accepted Mr Maduro’s request for an audit and ordered him, Mr Gonzalez and the eight other candidates who participated in the presidential election to appear before the justices on Friday.\n\nMr Gonzalez and Ms Machado say they obtained more than two-thirds of the tally sheets printed from electronic voting machines after the polls closed. They said the release of the data on those tallies would prove Mr Maduro lost.\n\nAsked why electoral authorities have not released detailed vote counts, Maduro said the National Electoral Council has come under attack, including cyber-attacks, without elaborating.\n\nThe presidents of Colombia and Brazil — both close allies of the Venezuelan government — have urged Mr Maduro to release detailed vote counts.\n\nThe Brazilian official said the diplomatic efforts are only intended to promote dialogue among Venezuelan stakeholders to negotiate a solution to the disputed election.\n\nThe official said this would include the release of voting data and allowing independent verification.\n\nMr Lopez Obrador said Mexico hopes the will of Venezuela’s people will be respected and that there is no violence. He added that Mexico expects “that the evidence, the electoral results records, be presented”.\n\nPressure has been building on the president since the election.\n\nThe National Electoral Council, loyal to Mr Maduro’s United Socialist Party of Venezuela, has yet to release any results broken down by voting machine, as it did in past elections.\n\nIt did, however, report that Mr Maduro received 5.1 million votes, versus more than 4.4 million for Mr Gonzalez.\n\nBut Ms Machado, the opposition leader, said vote tallies show Mr Gonzalez received roughly 6.2 million votes compared with 2.7 million for Mr Maduro."
