        "text": "British tennis without Andy Murray is like a runaway pram, full of nascent promise but likely to crash into a lamp post at any time. It wasn’t quite that bad after one disjointed round of the Australian Open, but there were some prominent bruises – and one brilliant exception.\n\nLike a moonbeam, Harriet Dart – ignominiously double-bagelled by Maria Sharapova here a year ago – lit up Melbourne Park and fought her way into the second round against Simona Halep with a courageous three-set win over the world No 82, Misaki Doi, in two hours and 49 minutes.\n\nAs lights were going out all around her on courts that had been packed with held-over matches from rainy Monday, 24-year-old Dart, the world No 173, outfought her Japanese opponent to win 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (10-6), converting her fifth match point. Now for Halep, who started slowly then walloped the American Jennifer Brady 7-6 (5), 6-1.\n\nDart almost disturbingly relaxed (or tired?) later, said she would regard her challenge against a two-slam former world No 1 as, “just another tennis match”, and realised Halep’s reputation and record would almost certainly launch them on to one of the big courts, although she did not want to dwell on it until Wednesday, when she would work on some strategy. “I’ll try to digest that win tonight, and prepare tomorrow. She’s a great champion and it’s an opportunity to see where my level’s at. I like to keep my tactics close to my chest, so hopefully you’ll see it on the court.\n\n“That was my first major one outside Wimbledon – definitely up there. I’m proud of the way I was able to stay composed and get over the line. Definitely one of the craziest finishes I’ve been involved in,” she said, adding she knew it was a 10-point finish, but double-checked with the chair umpire anyway.\n\nHalep, who played a near-perfect match to destroy Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final, is not counting on her status to daunt Dart. “As a top player, it’s both an advantage and then not that much an advantage, because everyone wants to get you. But, if you think about that, you don’t have time to think about yourself. I will focus on my game to play what I want against her – and then we will see.”\n\nThe day had not started well for the British contingent. Johanna Konta and Kyle Edmund tumbled early, followed by Katie Boulter, who succumbed to the fifth seed, Elina Svitolina, in two tight sets, and, near the end, Cameron Norrie, who put up a stout losing fight over five sets and three hours and 42 minutes against the French doubles artist, Pierre-Hugues Herbert.\n\nHeather Watson’s opening match, against Kyrstina Pliskova, was moved to Wednesday, and Dan Evans will be there also.\n\nAlthough Birmingham’s most popular tennis player still regards the absent Murray as the true British No 1, that badge is Evans’s to carry into the second round against Yoshihito Nishioka. Evans, finally blossoming into maturity after too long in the wilderness, knows the pay-off will be a third-round match against Novak Djokovic, unless the Japanese wildcard, Tatsuma Ito, pulls off the shock of the tournament – year, decade, maybe.\n\nKonta, playing on one good leg and the other improving, could do little about the exquisite variation of the erratic Tunisian Ons Jabeur and lost in little over an hour, 6-4, 6-2. While there was much to admire about Edmund’s fighting spirit, there was little to celebrate in how he blew a 5-2 overnight lead to let the unpredictable Serb, Dusan Lajovic, recover to win 7-6 (7), 6-3, 7-6 (4) when they resumed.\n\nBoth Britons were beaten on merit; both would have expected to win.\n\nKonta’s departure was a surprise more than a shock, given she had played just once (and lost) since the US Open more than four months ago, so she leaves Melbourne disappointed but characteristically optimistic that her game would improve in the coming months.\n\nShe dismissed suggestions that her knee – which has troubled her since last January – might need surgery and a long break from the game. She will not reconsider her decision to miss the Fed Cup, a week after this tournament, but will return on the American hardcourt swing in Indian Wells and Miami, and might play one or more of Dubai, Doha, Monterrey or St Petersburg.\n\n“How I physically felt out there is obviously a massive tick for me compared to where I was in September,” she said.\n\nEdmund was downbeat but philosophical, a union of the mind made easier in defeat. Asked how he felt about the state of British tennis given another near wipeout in a slam after just one round, he said: “I don’t know. We as in British? I don’t really know that question. I am sure everyone is trying their best.”\n\nDid he think Britain’s supposedly improving tennis battalion should be doing better, though?\n\n“Maybe, yes. You could expect better, yes. But I don’t really know. It is hard to answer that because you ask that as if it is a team [event] – but it is an individual sport, isn’t it? I don’t have any control over Dan or Jo or Katie or Heather or Cam, so it is hard to answer that isn’t it?\n\n“I am sure we are all trying our best, but I can just do my best. I can’t dictate results of other people. People can obviously have hopes and expectations – that is just natural of everything in life.”"
