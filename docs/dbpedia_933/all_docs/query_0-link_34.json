        "text": "It’s been a busy day in British tennis.\n\nDan Evans was involved in two Masters 1000 semi-finals in Monte Carlo, Great Britain faced Mexico in the Billie Jean King Cup and the long-absent Kyle Edmund provided an update on his knee injury struggles.\n\nHere’s a full recap of all the day’s top-level action, with reaction from those involved.\n\nDan Evans beaten in Monte Carlo singles but reaches doubles final\n\nA remarkable week for Dan Evans in Monte Carlo came to a grinding halt as he was thumped 6-2 6-1 by Greek fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas.\n\nEvans had only won four tour-level matches on clay prior to this week but booked his spot in a Masters 1000 semi-final in style, recording a famous win over world No. 1 Novak Djokovic en route.\n\nTsitsipas, who will go on to face Rafael Nadal’s conquerer Andrey Rublev in Sunday’s final, proved a bridge too far, however.\n\n‘Yeah, it’s been a good week. It’s been pretty long,’ said Evans after the match.\n\n‘Yeah, it’s been mentally pretty draining. Obviously you can’t say it’s bad to beat the world No. 1, but it was a lot – it was pretty draining, like, the day after, the end of that day.\n\n‘I could know what to expect of it more with bigger wins. Yeah, it was difficult. Today, the nature of this game at this level, especially Masters, at any time of the tournament you have to back up win after win after win if you want to go all the way.\n\n‘Yeah, today was difficult. Obviously doesn’t help the way he plays. He’s very aggressive. So, yeah, there’s still work to be done. I can’t be negative about today. Just have to park that and go again really. It’s been a great week.\n\n‘I won’t ever forget beating Novak, world No. 1. Yesterday to back it up in a great match was good, as well.’\n\nDespite defeat in the singles, Evans bounced back quickly to book his spot in the doubles final with Neal Skupski.\n\nA 7-6 (7-0) 2-6 10-4 win over Colombian top seeds Juan Sebastian Cabal and Robert Farah secured the pair’s passage to a second consecutive Masters 1000 final after finishing as runners-up in Miami earlier this month.\n\nHeather Watson loses but Katie Boulter seals BJK Cup win\n\nKatie Boulter produced another scintillating performance to wrap up a 3-1 win for Great Britain at the near-empty National Tennis Centre in the Billie Jean King Cup.\n\nBoulter, the British No. 9, was the standout player of the tie and it was fitting she sealed victory with an impressive 6-4 6-1 win over Giuliana Olmos.\n\nAs was the case in her singles win on Friday, Boulter was particularly impressive in the second set and she will no doubt hope to carry that form into the regular tour.\n\n‘I strongly believe I’ve put a lot of work in and I feel like my game is in a really, really good place. It’s there and it’s ready to come out, it’s just about doing that consistently.\n\n‘I know my game is going to get there, it’s just a matter of time. It’s just a bit of patience.’\n\nTeam captain Anne Keothavong agreed with that sentiment.\n\n‘For Katie, I know it’s just a matter of time. She just needs to be out there competing to get back into the top-100,’ said Keothavong.\n\n‘She’s looking fit, she’s looking strong, she’s enjoying her tennis. Lots of positives, lots of things going in the right direction for Katie.\n\nHeather Watson had earlier been beaten in disappointing fashion by Marcela Zacarias.\n\nThere were frailties in the Watson serve early on and a string of double faults saw her broken in both of her opening service games.\n\nThe British No. 2 was getting plenty of looks at her opponent’s serve and broke a couple of times but her level, in truth, was very poor and she deservedly fell a set behind.\n\nA break to love in the fifth game looked set to galvanise the Brit but she faltered when serving for the set at 5-4 and went down in a tiebreak.\n\n‘I definitely didn’t find my game today, I just never got going. I was positive throughout and thinking I’ll start to find my game but I didn’t. It was a bad day at the office.\n\n‘I gave the best with what I had today but it was far from good enough.’\n\nBritain will now be involved in a play-off in February, with a spot in the Billie Jean King Cup Finals on the line.\n\nSurgery for Kyle Edmund\n\nKyle Edmund has had a ‘small procedure’ on his left knee in an attempt to rectify a long-term issue.\n\nEdmund, who has peaked at No. 14 in the ATP rankings, underwent the operation three weeks ago in Switzerland and the timeline for his return remains unclear.\n\n‘I had a small procedure on my knee,’ said Edmund.\n\n‘I’m currently rehabbing, the recovery is going well and I hope to be back on court as soon as possible’.\n\nHe is yet to play in 2021, having ended last season with a run of four straight losses. He’s currently ranked 69 in the world, having peaked at No. 14.\n\nFollow Metro Sport across our social channels, on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."
