BENJAMIN HIGGINS BOULTER & RACHEL FOY\n\nDATE: April 10, 1999\n\nCOMPILER:\n\nRobert Boulter,\n\n37 Hows Cres,\n\nMoncton, NB,\n\nCanada, E1E 1S9\n\nPhone: 506-388-5922\n\nMESSAGE FROM THE COMPILER:\n\nHello fellow Boulters. This is a TEMPORARY LISTING and my contain errors. My main role is to serve as a compiler and only to do a little research for some dead end lines.\n\nThe first Boulter's who arrived on Prince Edward Island in 1810 were two brothers Benjamin Higgins Boulter and Henry Oliver Boulter and possibly a third brother whose name is unknown. According to family lore, the brothers had built themselves a ship and sailed it across the Alantic from their home in the Plymouth area of England. The Benjamin Boulter homestead is in Albany, PEI known as Brookdale Farms which is currently owned by the MacKay's (1999). Henry Oliver Boulter settled in western Prince Edward Island around the Milburn area.\n\nTheir are separate genealogy listings for the two brothers.\n\nThe first Boulter's in New Brunswick are descendants of Thomas Boulter and Sarah Terry Davis of Stanley, New Brunswick who were from Leicester, England\n\nCORRECTIONS & ADDITIONS:\n\nPlease mail your corrections and additions to the compiler. I will update the listings every 2-3 years if necessary, at least, until 2005. Please include as many details as possible including; parents, source of the information (Certificate, family records, personal knowledge, etc), occupation, residence, etc. Thank-You.
