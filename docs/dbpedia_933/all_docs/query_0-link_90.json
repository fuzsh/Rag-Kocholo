        "text": "Coco Gauff followed up Olympic disappointment with an early Canadian Open exit after being stunned by Diana Shnaider in Toronto.\n\nWorld number two Gauff suffered early eliminations at the Paris Olympics last week after falling in the singles, doubles and mixed doubles.\n\nThe number one seed was then downed 6-4 6-1 by her fellow 20-year-old, who secured the first top-10 win of her career to seal a maiden appearance in the quarter-finals of an ATP 1000 event.\n\n\"Sometimes I question like whether I should have played or not,\" Gauff said, \"But at the end of the day I wanted to test myself and see if I would be able to, how I would do being mentally tired a little bit and physically fatigued.\n\n\"I said going into the tournament I didn't have high expectations, but I wish I could have competed better today, even if it resulted in a loss. I don't think I competed well.\"\n\nShnaider is a remarkable 39-14 across all professional matches for the year, winning three titles in Hua Hin, Thailand (hard) in February, Bad Homburg (grass) in June and Budapest (clay) in July.\n\n\"I know Coco is very physically prepared for everyone on tour, and she's running very well, she's covering all of the balls and all the angles on the court,\" Shnaider said.\n\n\"So when there were long rallies and I was winning them I was like, 'Wow, I just beat Coco in long rallies. I am good'. I mean, I tried to play it cool, but inside I was like, 'Yes! I made it!'\"\n\nMeanwhile, third seed Aryna Sabalenka eased past British number one Katie Boulter for a routine 6-3 6-3 triumph in Canada.\n\nSabalenka will next face Amanda Anisimova, one of five Americans in the last eight alongside defending champion Jessica Pegula, Peyton Stearns, Emma Navarro and Taylor Townsend.\n\nSince the beginning of 2020, Sabalenka has reached 17 WTA 1000 quarter-finals, a feat only matched by world number one Iga Swiatek for the most at WTA 1000 events in that time.\n\nDefending Cincinnati Open champion Novak Djokovic will not take part in this year's tournament following his success at the Paris Olympics.\n\nDjokovic, who claimed his first gold medal at Roland-Garros against Carlos Alcaraz last week, has withdrawn from the US Open tune-up event in the United States.\n\nThe Serbian became only the second player after Andre Agassi in the Open Era have won all four Grand Slams, the gold medal at the Olympics and the ATP Tour Final with his win over the Spaniard in the French capital.\n\nDjokovic also became the oldest player (37y 74d) to secure the gold medal in either the men’s or women’s singles at the Olympics, since the sport’s reinstatement as an Olympic event in 1988.\n\nHowever, he has chosen to focus on the upcoming US Open, a competition he won 12 months ago against Daniil Medvedev to claim the latest of his 24 grand slam titles.\n\n\"We certainly understand that it is a quick turnaround from his Olympic triumph to come to Cincinnati,\" Tournament Director Bob Moran said in a news release.\n\n\"His title run here last year was so memorable. We are eager to see him on court again soon.\"\n\nLast year in Cincinnati, Djokovic claimed the title in three sets against Alcaraz, claiming his second win over the Spaniard in their fourth meeting.\n\nThe Serbian's victory over Alcaraz at the Games took his record to 5-4 over the world number three having lost in the Wimbledon final the previous month.\n\nDjokovic's withdrawal moves Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard into the draw.\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas has slammed his father's coaching style after suffering a shock straight-sets defeat at the Canadian Open on Thursday.\n\nThe 25-year-old was beaten 6-4 6-4 by Kei Nishikori, the world number 576, as he secured the scalp of the tournament so far in Montreal.\n\nIt follows a disappointing Olympic Games for Tsitsipas, who was knocked out by eventual winner Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals.\n\nHe also struggled at Wimbledon last month, suffering defeat to Emil Ruusuvuori in the second round.\n\nNow, he has hit out at his coach and father, Apostolos Tsitsipas, who he asked to leave midway through Thursday's match, for seemingly not reaching the standards he is looking for.\n\n\"I need, and I deserve, a coach that listens to me and hears my feedback as a player,\" Tsitsipas said.\n\n\"My father hasn't been very smart or very good at handling those situations. It's not the first time he has done that. I'm really disappointed at him.\n\n\"I really don't know right now if I'd consider any changes, but I'm really disappointed.\n\n\"The most important thing for a player is to have direct and good feedback from a coach. The coach is not the one holding a racket. The player is the one trying to execute a game plan.\n\n\"It's a collaborative work that you put in together. It has to be reciprocal in order for me to try to develop my tennis. It's something I don't want to get stuck at that.\""
