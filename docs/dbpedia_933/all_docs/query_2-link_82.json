        "text": "Positron emission tomography (PET) of labeled metabolites, drugs, proteins and nanomaterials[1-3] is rapidly emerging as a powerful imaging tool to detect and stage disease, to study human biology, to investigate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of new drugs, or to measure treatment efficacy in clinical trials.[4-8] 18F is one of the most commonly used isotopes for clinical imaging given its half-life, ease of production, wide availability, and compatibility with microfluidics syntheses.[9] Despite extensive use and well established procedures of labeling some small molecules, facile 18F platform-type universally adaptable labeling strategies are still largely missing. This is especially true for rapid labeling of small molecules that emerge from high throughput screens or for optimizing hybrid and modular imaging agents. Bioorthogonal chemistries represent one avenue to develop such generic labeling platforms.\n\nTo date, several bioorthogonal reactions have been described[10-15] but only few have been adapted for isotope labeling. The most popular ones is the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, “click” reaction, between azides and alkynes.[9, 16] These reactions were found to be particularly useful for in vitro 18F-fluorination of biomolecules and are now commonly used.[1, 17-20] Our search for alternative more rapid, selective, and chemically accessible coupling reactions without need for a catalyst led us to investigate the [4+2] inverse electron demand Diels-Alder cycloaddition using trans-cyclooctenes (TCO) and tetrazines (Tz).[21, 22, 22] Advantages of the TCO/Tz labeling strategy include a) fast reaction times in excess of 6,000 M -1s-1, b) high selectivity, c) no need for elevated temperatures or catalysts, d) biocompatible reaction conditions and e) activatable tetrazines.[22]\n\nHere we extend our previous work on TCO and Tz chemistry[21-24] and show that the Diels-Alder cycloaddition can be used for rapid 18F labeling of drugs. This strategy allows one to piggy-back onto the development of the vast number of small molecule affinity ligands, peptides, and antibodies targeting different enzymes such as kinases[25-27], receptors and other proteins. Using PARP1 as a model target[28-31] and AZD2281 as a well developed nM affinity ligand, we show that the TCO/Tz strategy can be used to efficiently label the drug scaffold in very short times and at exceptionally high yields.\n\nThis contrasts to conventional synthesis of directly 18F-fluorinated AZD2281 derivatives where yields are much lower. We show the successful fully automated synthesis of a 18F-labeled TCO, its conjugation with a tetrazine-modified AZD2281, and compare affinities of the parent drugs and intermediates. The described platform-based methodology is modular and could easily be adapted to other molecularly targeted drug scaffolds of interest.\n\nThere are three generic 18F labeling strategies for AZD2281: a) de novo synthesis of the native compound substituting 18F for the aryl fluorine atom, b) conventional tosylation and subsequent fluorination of hydroxy-AZD2281 derivatives and c) prosthetic group labeling followed by conjugation to the parent compound. The first choice would result in a chemically identical drug but synthetic steps would be lengthy, require purification of intermediates, may not be feasible given the short half-life of 18F and would be impractical for repeat for on-demand synthesis in a clinical setting. We therefore focused on the prosthetic group approach using the TCO/Tz chemistry. Advantages over the copper catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition include: a) no need for elevated temperatures, b) no need for removal of catalysts (important for human use) and c) faster kinetics, important when working with short-lived isotopes. While 18F labeling of either TCO or Tz is conceivable, preliminary experiments demonstrated the substituted 1,2,4,5-tetrazine moiety was not stable to commonly used mild nucleophilic fluorination conditions (tetrabutyl ammonium bicarbonate/potassium fluoride (pH 8.5, 40 °C). Therefore, focus was turned to the design and synthesis of an 18F-labeled TCO in which labeling would take place away from the cyclooctenyl ring due to susceptibility of that system to isomerization to bicyclo[3.3.0]octenes.[32] (Z)-2-(Cyclooct-4-enyloxy)acetic acid, 2, was prepared in 63% yield over two steps from commercially available 9-oxabicyclo[6.1.0]non-4-ene ( ). Carboxylic acid 2 was converted to (E)-2-(cyclooct-4-enyloxy)ethanol, 4, first by LiAlH4 reduction to give (Z)-2-(cyclooct-4-enyloxy)ethanol, 3, in 78% yield, followed by photochemical cis/trans isomerization and isolation of the (E)-isomers by the previously described cycle/trap method.[15] The major (E)-cyclooctyl stereoisomer was isolated by column chromatography and converted to the corresponding tosylate 5 in 84% yield. (E)-5-(2-Fluoroethoxy)cyclooct-1-ene, 619F, was prepared in 91% yield by the treatment of 5 with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in THF. All previously unknown compounds were fully characterized by 1H, 13C and 19F NMR.\n\nAs a precursor for the chemoselective reactive PARP1 inhibitor AZD2281-Tz 9, 4-[[4-fluoro-3-(4-(5-oxopentanamide) piperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl]methyl]-2H-phthalazin-1-one, 7, was generated according to known literature procedures ( ).[24] This precursor was reacted with 8 [21] in the presence of polymer-supported dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC)-beads to yield 9 as a pink solid. Cycloadduct 1019F was prepared by the addition of DMSO solutions of 9 and 619F at rt and subsequent HPLC purification.\n\nRadiofluorination of 5 was performed following a modified procedure previously described for the 18F-labeling of 1-azido-2-(2-(2-18F-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethane.[33] In brief, 18F-fluoride n.c.a. (18F-) in 18O-enriched H2O obtained from PETNET and tetrabutylammonium bicarbonate (nBu4NHCO3) were dried by azeotropic distillation of the acetonitrile/water mixture under reduced pressure and a stream of argon. Tosylate 5 in DMSO was added to the dried 18F-(n.c.a.)/(nBu4NHCO3) and heated to 90 °C for 10 minutes. Filtration of the reaction mixture through alumina-N removed unreacted 18F- prior to HPLC purification. Having a low UV absorbance, verification of the identity of desired 618F product was confirmed in a separate experiment by HPLC injection of 619F, fraction collection at the same elution as observed for radioactive 618F, and NMR analysis of the non-radioactive concentrate. HPLC purified 618F was isolated from the collected HPLC solvents by C18 solid phase extraction (SPE) and eluted with dichloromethane (DCM) to give 7.7 ± 3.4 mCi (n = 16) 618F in 44.7 ± 7.8% decay-corrected radiochemical yield (dcRCY) in an average time of 41 min from the start of drying of [18F]-F- (n.c.a.). Analytical HPLC demonstrated >93% radiochemical purity of 618F. Tetrazine 9 in DMSO was added to the 618F/DCM solution, stirred for 3 min and subjected to HPLC purification ( ). C18 SPE provided 1018F in 59.6 ± 5.0% isolated dcRCY (n = 3) with >96% radiochemical purity.\n\nCompound 9 and AZD2281-Tz/trans-cyclooctene inverse electron demand Diels-Alder products 1019F, 1016O and 1018O were analyzed using HPLC-ESI/MS spectroscopy ( ). Under the reaction conditions for this cycloaddition, it was found that the initial dihydropyridazine products underwent aromatization to the corresponding pyridazines. LC/MS data confirmed the aromatization of the formed heterocycle, giving m/z-values of 792.6, 790.5 and 792.6, respectively (calc. 792.4, 790.4 and 792.4). To verify their elemental composition, compounds 9, 1019F, 1016O and 1018O were also subjected to high resolution mass spectrometry. All measured values reflected the calculated masses. Furthermore, high resolution mass spectrometry allowed distinction between 1019F and 1018O, whose masses differ by 0.0085 g/mol, confirming the radioactive decay of 1018F to 1018O ( ).\n\nIn addition to the above described cycloadducts, we also prepared fluorinated AZD2281 analogs ( ) using nucleophilic substitution. Two candidates were designed and synthesized based on known literature procedures.[34] 4-[[4-Fluoro-3-(piperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl]methyl]-2H-phthalazin-1-one was acylated with 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid or hydroxyacetic acid to give 12 and 15. These hydroxy-AZD2281 derivatives were converted to the corresponding tosylates, 13 and 16. Attempts to fluorinate 13 resulted in decomposition of starting material while the reaction of tosylate 16 with sodium fluoride provided 1719F in 16% yield. Standard 18F-radiolabeling K222/K2CO3 conditions, even at low temperatures (40°C), resulted in decomposition of the starting sulfonate ester 16. Experiments were conducted to test the use of microwave heating at short time intervals with no positive results. Attempts to use the less alkaline tetrabutyl ammonium bicarbonate (nBu4NHCO3) as a phase transfer catalyst also resulted in decomposition of the starting materials and <1% radiochemical yields (RCY) of 1718F."
