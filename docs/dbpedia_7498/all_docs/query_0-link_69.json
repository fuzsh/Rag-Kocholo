        "text": "Released: Apr 7, 1965\n\nRuntime: 88 mins\n\nDirector: Mario Bava\n\nWriter: Mario Bava, Marcello Fondato, Giuseppe Barilla\n\nActors: Cameron Mitchell, Eva Bartok, Thomas Reiner\n\nPLOT\n\nA masked, shadowy killer brutally murders the models of a scandalous fashion house in Rome.\n\nMY THOUGHTS\n\nThere’s about six deaths, all women except for Massimo in the end. The kills are not overly graphic, but there is blood for some of the deaths (not including the strangulation and the drowning of course). There is also a scene where a woman’s face is burned, and we’re supposed to think that killed her. For a sixties movie, I thought the effects were decent.\n\nAs far as acting goes, I thought it was pretty decent. Just to be up front, I do like watching foreign films, but I will only watch with subtitles. I’m not a fan of dubbing for the most part. So I’m judging by the subtitle version. I will say, I was surprised when Peggy died. I was convinced she would be the final girl, but alas no.\n\nAt a famous fashion house, one of the models is murdered. As an inspector is trying to figure out who killed her, the fashion show must go on. During the show, the victim’s diary is found. The diary is filled with everyone’s dark secrets that they don’t want found out. As the movie unfolds, each person who gets the diary ends up dying. And just when you think you figure it out, an impossible situation comes up and you start doubting yourself. It ends with a good conclusion that no questions are left unanswered.\n\nWith most Giallo’s you have a mysterious killer ( a lot of times you see just gloves or a mask), beautiful women, a hidden secret or scandal that eventually comes to light, and a mystery that slowly unfolds. Giallo’s are a great mix of mystery and slasher. I think Mario Bava did a great job with this movie, and I really like his use of the color read throughout the movie. Whether it be with the red scarves or the red mannequins you find throughout the movie. Don’t get me started with the freaky mannequins!\n\nAnother reason (besides they are slashers) I like Giallo’s, like Blood and Black Lace, is that I usually can’t guess who the killer is until the end. You get some clever red herring’s and then when the killer is revealed, you’re like “ahh…that make’s sense”.\n\n============================================================\n\nI wanted to take a quick break to let you know I found these great deals on Amazon for Blood and Black Lace merchandise. I’ve applied to Amazon’s affiliate program and if I can get three purchases I will be accepted into the program. This will be of tremendous help with starting my small business."
