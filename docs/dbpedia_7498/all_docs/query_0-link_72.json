        "text": "Tue Feb 17 22:38:50 GMT 2015\n\n“The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh” and the giallo: an International Film Conference Hosted by the Austrian Historical Institute and Sheffield Hallam University’s Department of Humanities in cooperation with Cineteca Nazionale\n\nThe giallo is a cinema of leather gloves and razors, of inappropriate pathos, which dignifies murder as an artistic act. It is a guilty pleasure whose concise mannerism represents a unique phenomenon within the history of European film. Mario Bava who conceived the formula with “The Evil Eye” (1963) provided its first masterpiece with “Blood and Black Lace” (1964) to inspire very heterogeneous successors. Dario Argento, Massimo Dallamano, Luciano Ercoli, Lucio Fulci, Umberto Lenzi and, especially, Sergio Martino are the most influential but only a few of all the directors producing perhaps more than 200 gialli in the 1970s. Through the DVD boom, a new generation of cinephiles has gained access to the popular film cycle, which has been enthusiastically embraced. The conference, whose aim is to explore the genre beyond Bava's and Argento's well-studied contributions, takes Sergio Martino’s “The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh” (1971) as a focal point, but proposals on\n\nother films are just as welcome. Likely topics include: • Cinematic characteristics of the film cycle • Configurations of the set piece\n\n• The significance of film music (of, e. g., Bruno Nicolai, Stelvio Cipriani or Ennio Morricone)\n\n• The giallo as a transnational phenomenon • Production/distribution/exhibition/reception contexts • The construction of authorship\n\n• Generic hybridity/the giallo’s relation to coeval popular film cycles\n\n• Cross-media appropriations • Studies of specific films or remakes • Archival sources stemming from giallo productions\n\nOf course, the topics above are to be understood merely as suggestions and not as constraints. We are delighted to announce Professor Richard Dyer (King's College London) as our distinguished keynote speaker. On the evening of June 7, \"The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh\" will be screened at the Cinema Trevi and followed by a panel discussion with director Sergio Martino, screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi and leading actor George Hilton.\n\nVenue: Österreichisches Historisches Institut, Viale Bruno Buozzi 111–113, I-00197 Roma Date: June 7–9, 2015 Deadline for submission: For presentations (max. 20 minutes) in English, please submit a short abstract (title, topic, resources) and a current CV by February 20, 2015. Notification by the end of February.
