We hope you enjoy this post and have a fun and safe Halloween!\n\nWhat exactly is Giallo? The Italian word for yellow, originally a term to used to describe cheap mystery books with yellow covers that enjoyed an immense amount of popularity in Italy, but in the late 1960s, a genre of film emerged that would take the same name.\n\nA traditional Giallo film includes many themes that would ensure its skyrocketing popularity in the early-to-mid 1970s: mystery elements, thrills, psychological horror, sometimes with black-gloved slashers or wide-eyed mediums. While all of these aspects are not always guaranteed to be featured, and many critics argue about how to define a genre so unique and with so many archetypes, one thing you’re certain to find in every film is great style and European aestheticism. If you’re a big fan of the 70s’ and 60s’, horror films, and intriguing thrills, be sure to give these a go!\n\nBelow I’ve listed a selection of the most interesting names from a few famous Giallo films.
