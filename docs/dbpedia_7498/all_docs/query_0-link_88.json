        "text": "A young woman enters her chic quarters. She begins to disrobe, preparing for bed. A hand wearing a black leather driving gloves reaches out and cuts the cord for the lights. The woman turns towards a creaking door where a silhouetted figure wearing a trench coat and wide-brimmed hat stands in silence. She screams and searches for an escape while the figure silently approaches …\n\nA variation of this scene appears in nearly every gialloin Anthology Film Archives’ upcoming series, Giallo Fever! (September 20-30), which features a wide variety of samples from the genre. At this point the woman will most likely be beaten or stabbed to death. The villains in these films are murderous MacGuyvers, turning almost any household object into the deadliest of weapons, and so the weapon of choice can be hard to predict. Like other Italian films from the 1960s and ’70s, there is almost no sync sound and the soundtrack is entirely created in postproduction, causing the audio to float alongside of, rather than emanate from, the onscreen sources. Italian viewership was extremely large at this time, and the demand for new material from the directors necessitated a quick shooting schedule and a shoestring budget. As a sort of compensation for this, the body count in a typical giallo is high, and one of the thrills for the audience was seeing how each film upped the ante on the amount and type of bloodshed.\n\nThe genre takes its name from Il Gialli Mondadori, a long-running series of mystery novels, cheaply published, with yellow (giallo in Italian) covers. These often included translations of foreign authors such as Edgar Wallace and Agatha Christie. A Christie-like narrative structure is evident in a majority of the films. A murder occurs. A detective of sorts (usually an amateur and often a witness to the original crime) begins to track down the killer. Throughout the film a list of possible suspects accrues, each with his or her motives for committing the crime. Finally in a climactic scene the perpetrator is revealed and, usually, killed. While this may sound similar to other Christie adaptations (such as the BBC’s portrayal of sly amateur detectives Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple), giallo’s difference is in the devilish details.\n\nThe stakes in these films rarely feel very high, despite the fact that they are literally life or death. In a standard mystery, the original crime upsets the natural order of things, which subsequently is reestablished through the criminal’s apprehension. Most giallido not portray this sense of order or security to return to. A general sense of amorality circulates throughout and, in the end, what is one more murder? Coupled with a dizzying sense of aesthetic freedom, this largely cynical worldview, an index of the overwhelming political conflict and violence of Italy’s “years of lead,” can make for an exhilarating viewing experience. Safe and dependable conventions, narrative or otherwise, which we all rely on, are consistently thrown out the window, and in their wake anything is possible. Objects suddenly take on violent, unforeseen potential. Bodies are malleable in uncomfortable ways, transforming, falling apart, and bursting open like bloody piñatas. The camera movement is unbridled, swinging like a monkey from a vine, dramatically zooming in on items of interest, popping in and out of POV shots, and often glancing askew. The screams of the victims, and the sounds of the weapons are peculiarly disconnected from their images. The wildly inventive soundtracks, composed by the likes of Ennio Morricone and the Italian prog group Goblin, interweave with the sounds of carnage to jarring effect. The “anything” of “anything is possible” is usually expressed in the many unspeakable acts of passion (either sexual or sadistic, and often both) that occur.\n\nExciting as these moments may be, they can be hard to watch. Both a moral and physical nausea can ensue. I count myself among the squeamish, and there is much in these films to make me wriggle. Aside from the gore, the pervasive misogyny and homophobia that saturates, gialli can at times be all but suffocating. One could rightly ask, “What is to be gained from watching scene after scene of people (usually women) being brutally killed?”, and I may not be able to supply an adequate answer. But if I were to try, I might rather evasively begin by pointing to the aesthetic formalisms of the genre’s founding fathers, Mario Bava and Dario Argento. Anyone who attended the Andrzej Źu ławski retrospective this winter at BAM can attest to the strange and mesmerizing beauty that is possible in profane material. Through their use of camera movement and artistic direction, these filmmakers have an uncanny ability to turn the mechanics of murder into absorbing spectacles. While the material may have very little redeeming social value, the execution is enthralling, and often beautiful enough to be worth the ethical discomfort."
