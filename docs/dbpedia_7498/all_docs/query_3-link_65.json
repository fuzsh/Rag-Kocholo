        "text": "Film Screenings / Programs / Series\n\nGIALLO FEVER!\n\nSeptember 20 – September 30\n\nThe term Giallo, literally “yellow” in Italian, originally referred to a series of crime novels with trademark yellow covers. Giallo, as a film genre of Italian thrillers that grew out of these pulp fictions starting in the mid 60s, became wildly popular in the 70s, then faded away in the early 80s. Giallo left a legacy of films often overlooked but widely influential on filmmakers such as Brian De Palma, Quentin Tarantino, and Darren Aronofsky. Apart from the signature blend of style and kitsch aesthetics, the genre features some of the most innovative scores ever created, by the likes of Ennio Morricone, Riz Ortolani, and Goblin. While these films have enjoyed a revival of interest due to DVD releases of several titles, they have yet to receive the 35mm treatment they absolutely deserve in a city like New York.\n\nProgrammed by Alessio Giorgetti, Alessio Grana, and Yunsun Chae (Malastrana Film Series). Special thanks to Dario Argento, Tony Musante, Scott Foundas, Simonetta Magnani (Cultural Attaché, Italian Cultural Institute New York), Marchesi de Frescobaldi Wines, Adriana Chiesa Enterprises, Laura Argento (Cineteca Nazionale), Robert Blair (VCI Entertainment), Chris Chouinard (Park Circus), Piero Frescobaldi (Unit9), Alba Gandolfo (Cineteca D.W. Griffith), Ernesto Gastaldi, Harry Guerro, Rick Knight (First Line Films), Alfredo Leone (International Media Films), William Lustig (Blue Underground), Sergio Martino, Gary Palmucci (Kino Lorber), Antonio Pirozzi (Ps Comunicazione), and Shameless Screen Entertainment.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Though our printed calendar indicated that there would be a screening of BLOOD AND BLACK LACE on Thurs, Sept 20 at 9:30, we will instead be screening Mario Bava's THE GIRL WHO KNEW TOO MUCH at that time. BLOOD AND BLACK LACE will be screening as planned on Tues, Sept 25 at 7:00 and Sun, Sept 30 at 8:45."
