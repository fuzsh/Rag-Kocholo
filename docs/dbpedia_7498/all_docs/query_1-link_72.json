        "text": "About the Book\n\n\"Since 1929, with the release of a popular book series with bright yellow covers, the Italian word \"giallo\" (yellow) has come to define the whole spectrum of mystery and detective fiction and films. Although most English speakers associate the term \"giallo\" with the violent and erotic thrillers popular in the 1960s and 1970s from directors like Mario Bava, Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci and others, the term encompasses a wide range of Italian mysteries, thrillers and detective stories, from comedies to political pamphlets. As films like Blood and Black Lace (1964) and Deep Red (1975) have received international acclaim, giallo is a fluid and dynamic genre that has evolved and hybridized throughout the decades. This book examines the growth of the giallo genre in terms of themes, influences, narrative and style. It explores Italian films, made-for-TV films and miniseries from the dawn of sound cinema to the present, all contextualized within the film industry and through their impact on society, culture and mores.\"--\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nSince the release in 1929 of a popular book series with bright yellow covers, the Italian word giallo (yellow) has come to define a whole spectrum of mystery and detective fiction and films. Although most English speakers associate the term giallo with the violent and erotic thrillers popular in the 1960s and 1970s from directors like Mario Bava, Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci and others, the term encompasses a wide range of Italian media such as mysteries, thrillers and detective stories--even comedies and political pamphlets. As films like Blood and Black Lace (1964) and Deep Red (1975) have received international acclaim, giallo is a fluid and dynamic genre that has evolved throughout the decades.\n\nThis book examines the many facets of the giallo genre --narrative, style, themes, and influences. It explores Italian films, made-for-TV films and miniseries from the dawn of sound cinema to the present, discussing their impact on society, culture and mores.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRoberto Curti is an Italian film historian and the author of numerous published books and articles. He lives in Cortona, Italy."
