        "text": "With its implicit promise of death, bloodshed, and a touch of sleaze, the world of giallo films can be intimidating to outsiders. Even the titles—Lizard in a Woman's Skin or Black Belly of the Tarantula—are both enticing and alarming. In recent months, films like Edgar Wright's Last Night in Soho, a London-set psychological thriller, and James Wan's Malignant, a Seattle-based supernatural freak-out, arrived with press tours where each movie-obsessed director referenced their love of giallo, name-checking filmmakers like Dario Argento and Mario Bava. So, where do you start if you've never really sought out the genre before? And what does \"giallo\" even mean?\n\nDepending on who you're talking to, giallo can be a very wide term, one that encompasses a number of stylish slahsers, or it can refer to movies made in a specific place (Italy) at a specific time (roughly the 1960s through the 1980s). As critic Noel Murray points out his excellent recent Polygon piece on the genre, the word \"giallo,\" which means \"yellow\" in Italian, was used to evoke the yellow covers of pulpy, violence-filled crime novels published in Italy, but it \"was never an organized movement.\" Though certain style elements reoccur—like black gloves, sharp knives, ambitious tracking shots, eye-popping close-ups, and moments of stomach-churning violence—there aren't necessarily fixed features that each movie must check off in order to count as a giallo.\n\nAs with most genres, the best approach to understanding giallo is to simply dive in like you're recklessly investigating the tragic death of a friend or lover. (If it's giallo, there's going to be a murder.) You may have already seen giallo-adjacent films like Nicolas Roeg's chilling classic Don't Look Now or Brian de Palma's unnerving Hitchcock homage Dressed to Kill, two works that can be understood within the genre's parameters. Maybe you saw 2018's Suspiria remake with the spooky Radiohead score and the creepy Tilda Swinton performance. If so, you may know more about giallo than you think.\n\nFor the purposes of this guide, which is by no means meant to be comprehensive or exhaustive, I'd like to keep things simple by focusing on one film from different directors and keeping the suggestions limited to Italian productions from the '60s and '70s. Though many modern directors might be riffing on giallo tropes, nothing beats going back to the scene of the crime."
