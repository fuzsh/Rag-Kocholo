        "text": "As fantasies go, mine aren’t that salacious. They tend to revolve around physical media releases, like, for example, desiring a Blu-ray box set of the four cinematic collaborations between Italian director Umberto Lenzi and American actress Carroll Baker. Produced between 1969 and 1972, the films include the giallo thrillers Orgasmo, So Sweet … So Perverse, A Quiet Place to Kill, and Knife of Ice.\n\nWell, you can consider this fantasy fulfilled thanks to Severin Films, a boutique media label that specializes in rescuing and restoring obscure movies. Their new Lenzi/Baker collection is everything I’d hoped for. Right down to the handsome packaging.\n\nA quick backstory on the collaboration between the filmmaker and movie star: In the 1970s and early ’80s, Umberto Lenzi garnered attention from English-speaking movie audiences as director of the notorious and controversial jungle-cannibal films The Man from Deep River, Eaten Alive, and Cannibal Ferox, but knowledgeable Eurocult fans recognize that his filmography goes much deeper and begins much earlier. Back to the dawn of giallo cinema.\n\nCarroll Baker, a veteran American actress who had experienced her share of ups and downs in Hollywood, was nearing 40 when she left the United States in the late 1960s to work in Italy. She looked no older than 30, however, which enabled her to convey the youthfully glamorous yet world-weary air Lenzi sought for the protagonist of the film project he was about to undertake.\n\nIn 1969, the two joined forces, and Severin’s box set represents their shared output.\n\nThe Complete Lenzi-Baker Giallo Collection consists of six discs: the four movies as well as two CDs of music from the films. Technical specs can be found here.\n\nOrgasmo (1969) stars Baker as Kathryn West, a recently widowed American socialite who flees the U.S. to seek solitude at her late husband’s Italian villa. Quickly bored, she falls in with two attractive strangers (Lou Castel and Colette Descombes) who seduce her into a lifestyle of partying, booze, and sex. In time it becomes clear that they want more from her than a good time, but by then she’s in too deep. Can Kathryn escape their clutches before the pair’s nefarious plans come to fruition?\n\nWith Orgasmo, Lenzi demonstrates a more sophisticated grasp of filmmaking than he’s often given credit for, as the film’s tone shifts almost imperceptibly darker from scene to scene. Baker’s Kathryn is not an especially likable protagonist in the early going, but viewers soon come to fear for her as she is sucked into a vortex from which she can seemingly never escape.\n\nThe image quality is very good—certainly better than the film has ever looked on home video in the U.S.—and more than satisfactory for a relatively low-budget production from 1969.\n\nSo Sweet … So Perverse (1969). Jean-Louis Trintignant is bored by his loveless marriage to Erika Blanc (how that would be possible is beyond the scope of this review). So, when beautiful, mysterious, and troubled Carroll Baker moves into the upstairs apartment, he is naturally drawn to her. As you might guess, this dicey situation sets them on a course toward jealously, mayhem, and murder.\n\nThe cast and crew list features a strong giallo pedigree: the aforementioned Erika Blanc, Helga Liné, Sergio Martino (producer), Ernesto Gastaldi (screenplay), and Riz Ortolani (score). Despite that, So Sweet … So Perverse is my least favorite film in the set. It’s an enjoyable movie but lacks the tension and storytelling patience of Orgasmo, and Baker, while top billed, seems more of a supporting character this time around. Not that I’m complaining about Erika Blanc taking center stage.\n\nAs with Orgasmo, the transfer of So Sweet … So Perverse is sufficiently impressive.\n\nA Quiet Place to Kill (1970). Baker stars as a financially strapped race car driver (!) who cannot resist the charms of ex-husband Jean Sorel, despite his current marriage to another woman. Never mind that their marriage ended because Baker had once attempted to murder him. Now they’re one big unhappy family, including the new wife’s attractive adult daughter from a previous relationship. Someone’s ending up dead here, kids.\n\nThis film is my favorite in the set. It’s got all the lurid, over-the-top elements that draw modern film buffs to the giallo scene, and Baker cuts loose as a wild and unpredictable protagonist torn by inner conflict.\n\nThe transfer sparkles. If you’re old enough to have grown up on VHS or once collected crappy bootleg videotapes of otherwise-unattainable genre films, you’ll be stunned by the image quality.\n\nKnife of Ice (1972). Baker, in a far more chaste role this time, plays a mute woman named Martha who may be the target of a sex maniac, a devil worshiper, or a serial killer … it doesn’t matter which. What matters is that people are dropping dead all around her, and she won’t be able to scream or cry for help when danger arrives.\n\nBetween the releases of A Quiet Place to Kill and Knife of Ice, the giallo scene had changed, and the impetus for that change was Dario Argento’s blockbuster The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. Forget the worldly glamour and jet-set lifestyles depicted in the previous Lenzi/Baker collaborations. Thanks to Argento’s impact on Italian cinema, this final pairing is all about knife-wielding, black-clad killers. It’s a well-made, classic-style giallo that nevertheless lacks some of the uniqueness that defines the other three films. From a stylistic standpoint, this box set can be viewed as a trilogy with Knife of Ice included as a bonus film.\n\nAside from some graininess in the night scenes—there are a lot more such scenes in Knife of Ice as compared to the others—the transfer is razor sharp and offers pleasing color saturation.\n\nContent warning: Knife of Ice includes graphic stock footage of a Spanish arena bullfight.\n\nUnderstanding Umberto Lenzi\n\nWhen the subject of giallo films arises, people tend to mention Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci, and Mario Bava. Lenzi’s name might be invoked later in the conversation … despite the fact that he directed as many gialli as Fulci and Bava combined.\n\nAs I wrote of giallo master Sergio Martino, Lenzi suffers in reputation for what should be viewed as a strength—versatility. Whereas a genre fan can identify a Fulci or Argento film immediately based on those filmmakers’ distinctive visual styles, Lenzi is a chameleon.\n\nOne can even question whether the first three films in Severin’s set are true gialli, since they don’t always exhibit the established conventions of the genre. To me, they owe more to Alfred Hitchcock than to Mario Bava.\n\nSo Sweet … So Perverse and A Quiet Place to Kill in particular remind me of early Hitchcock thrillers such as Notorious and Suspicion. Deceptions, veiled threats, and uncertain identities are more significant elements than straight razors and killers in black gloves. Stir in James Bond-style glamour, exoticism, and sensuality, and you’ve got an Umberto Lenzi thriller from 1969-70.\n\nBut forget that argument and whether you agree with me about what defines a giallo. Consider that Lenzi made other gialli like Eyeball, a satirical slasher film, and Spasmo, a reality-bending fever dream, and it becomes apparent that he was less about obsessive artistic vision and more about following his stylistic whims. Since film fanatics, myself included, tend to latch onto obsessive visionaries, we fail to give the Umberto Lenzis of the movie biz their proper credit. Perhaps Severin’s box set will help change that.\n\nSo crack it open, pull up a chair, and find yourself a quiet place to watch.\n\nIn the cinematic niche known as the Italian giallo film, Mario Bava is father and Dario Argento is king. And Lucio Fulci is the gifted but misanthropic prince who ruins family dinners with his nihilistic rants.\n\nSo where does that leave Sergio Martino? For if there’s a fourth member of the royal family, it has to be Sergio.\n\nHis five gialli—THE STRANGE VICE OF MRS. WARDH, THE CASE OF THE SCORPION’S TAIL, ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK, the incredibly titled YOUR VICE IS A LOCKED ROOM AND ONLY I HAVE THE KEY, and the grindhouse classic TORSO—count among the best the genre offers. Made in uninterrupted succession from 1971 to 1973, these five films reveal their director’s remarkable breadth of visual style and storytelling ability.\n\nYet Martino’s gialli receive scarcely a small fraction of the ink dedicated to maestros Bava, Argento, and Fulci. Why is he so overlooked? I think it’s because his body of work in the genre, as a whole, is difficult to deconstruct and discuss.\n\nMartino biographer Kat Ellinger said as much in her audio commentary for Arrow Video’s 2018 blu-ray release of TORSO by pointing out that there are no overt stylistic or thematic threads running through Martino’s work. His films are simply (yet complicatedly) excellent gialli that do not appear, in the absence of prior knowledge, to have been directed by the same person.\n\nIn comparison, Argento, Bava, and Fulci are easier to write about. Argento’s films tend to favor style and feature epic, set-piece kills that are staged with the auteur’s unique flair for gruesome beauty. The camera work and editing are pre-digital bravura, and the imagery tends toward the stark and vivid. Bava, meanwhile, is the master of painterly shot compositions and can tie a story together, thematically and visually, through color. Fulci’s gialli are dreamlike, full of dread and drifting toward inevitable doom. The director presents a grim view of humanity, and his films part ways with the viewer on the bleakest of notes.\n\nMartino’s giallo output offers no such easy summary. Therefore, we have to assess the films one at a time. In the interest of brevity, I will discuss only his final three gialli in depth. Of his first two, THE STRANGE VICE OF MRS. WARDH is a kinky thriller with a smart, twist-filled script that best approximates what 1940s and 1950s readers would have experienced when absorbed in the lurid “giallo” detective novels of the time. The second, THE CASE OF THE SCORPION’S TAIL, is closer to a conventional crime thriller that nevertheless offers clever deceptions and the outrageous, implausible story turns that make the genre so much fun. Now onto the rest:\n\nALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK (1972)\n\nFor his follow-up to THE CASE OF THE SCORPION’S TAIL, Martino moved in a starkly different stylistic direction that recalls Bava’s use of garish colors and surreal lighting, but he does so with his own flair.\n\nThe plot concerns Jane (Edwige Fenech), a mentally fragile woman who believes she is being followed by a dagger-wielding assassin (Ivan Rassimov). Her boyfriend (George Hilton), sister (Nieves Navarro), and neighbor (Marina Malfatti) each insists on “helping” Jane in opposition to the others, until she no longer knows who to trust.\n\nALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK is filmed in soft-focus and employs a mix of deep colors and overexposed white light to create a dreamy, disorienting effect that symbolizes the protagonist’s deepening confusion and paranoia. The depth-of-field is shallow, blurring backgrounds and foregrounds as the action plays out in the middle. Leaves, branches, reeds, and even hanging beads are placed between the camera and the actors to emphasize that the truth is obscured and, like the characters, resides somewhere between the extremes.\n\nPart of what renders Martino’s gialli elusive, from a standpoint of analysis and discussion, is that they do not fully embrace the genre. ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK owes more to ROSEMARY’S BABY than to Argento’s THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE, the film that inspired the hundreds of gialli produced in Italy and elsewhere throughout the 1970s. It’s equal parts devil-cult movie and “neurotic-female” horror, both popular sub-genres at the time. Ultimately, ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK is a giallo by virtue of the murder-mystery aspect and the body count, though one wonders if Martino (and screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi) incorporated those elements out of commercial necessity. Most of the kills occur off camera and feel perfunctory (just a splash of blood here and there), as if Martino was more enthused about the other components of the story.\n\nYOUR VICE IS A LOCKED ROOM AND ONLY I HAVE THE KEY (1972)\n\nThe evasiveness of Martino’s fourth giallo merely begins at the title; the film as well provides a difficult access point for viewers. There’s no introductory murder scene featuring a black-gloved killer, or glamorous travelogue shots of Venice or Rome. Rather, we are greeted by a long sequence of cringe-inducing humiliations endured by multiple characters at a debauched party inside a crumbling villa.\n\nWhat’s more, we soon realize YOUR VICE lacks a protagonist (of the type viewers latch onto). Every character is a villain, from Luigi Pistilli’s drunken, abusive novelist to Edwige Fenech’s manipulative, conniving vixen to Anita Strindberg’s cat-mutilating, hysterical housewife. The maid, Brenda (Angela La Vorgna), is the only sympathetic character, but she hardly qualifies as a protagonist because, well, spoiler alert. It’s a giallo.\n\nAnd that’s what makes it tricky to analyze, because it’s also not a giallo. Yes, there are kills and a mystery of sorts, but even more so than in ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK, those elements feel shoehorned.\n\nYOUR VICE is at heart a non-supernatural gothic horror film about an alcoholic writer, his humiliated wife, their miserable marriage, and his dead mother who casts a pall over their entire existence. There’s also a (metaphorically) haunted dress and a sinister black cat who does not get along with Strindberg’s character very well.\n\nI’m convinced that Martino is subtly mocking his audience. Not only are the giallo-style kills scenes shoehorned (though well shot and much gorier than those in ALL THE COLORS), the reveal of the killer—SEMI-SPOILER WARNING—comes just over an hour into the movie and is only peripherally connected to the main story. Only upon second viewing are you even likely to recognize the killer’s face, so minor is the character. It’s as if the director had said, “You want a body count and a flimsy plot about superficial characters? Here you go. Now let’s get back the Gothic horror story I was telling.”\n\nStylistically, YOUR VICE couldn’t be more different from ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK. Here the focus is crisp and the colors naturalistic, and in contrast to the earlier film’s abundance of hazy white light and lens flare, the action in YOUR VICE takes place in the dark, with the exception of one outdoor set-piece. Like each character’s motivations, the film’s text lies in the shadows … and emerges as your eyes adjust to repeated viewings.\n\nTORSO (1973)\n\nA series of brutal slayings rocks a university in Perugia, Italy, prompting a group of students to seek refuge in a remote countryside villa … only to discover the killer is not going to give up the chase so easily.\n\nWhereas Martino’s earlier giallo plots are built around troubled relationships and bourgeois foibles, TORSO is pure slasher-movie material: beautiful young college girls, about whom we learn little, are stalked and murdered by a masked psycho. The kill sequences are quite violent, and the actresses’ clothing falls off with regularity. Yes, his prior films featured copious nudity, but those scenes were generally story relevant, and those characters had other duties besides stripping.\n\nIt’s as if the director had capitulated to audience demands for lurid content and then delivered it with mean-spirited panache. Given that this film takes place not in the sophisticated cosmopolitan centers of Rome, Venice, or Milan but rather out where the audiences who craved such exploitation fare actually lived, it’s plausible that Martino is once again satirizing his primary consumers. They are on display as peripheral characters in TORSO and are represented, one-and-all, as leering rubes.\n\nOnce more, Martino reinvents his approach to giallo filmmaking. The pace and energy are ramped up through quick cutting and hand-held camerawork, and the kill sequences take center stage. The emphasis is on pulsing suspense, and the climactic “final girl” stalk-and-chase sequence between the killer and star Suzy Kendall is ripped from a horror film.\n\nIn contrast with YOUR VICE, most of which takes place in a single setting, TORSO is in constant motion, tracking its story from set to set and location to location.\n\nThere are a few threads that tie Martino’s gialli together. The first is the repeated casting of George Hilton, Edwige Fenech, Anita Strindberg, and Ivan Rassimov (until TORSO). The second is the recurring “neurotic female” trope. The third is shots of eyes in extreme close-up, though that flourish is hardly unique to Martino in Italian genre cinema.\n\nThat’s not much fuel if the finish line is understanding Martino’s gialli as a single body of work. Watch any two classic films by Bava, Argento, or Fulci, and the third becomes immediately recognizable as that director’s work. Martino’s versatility meanwhile, instead of being celebrated, earns him the label of “journeyman.”\n\nAlso, he tended to mash up genres. His first effort, THE STRANGE VICE OF MRS. WARDH, is pure giallo, but onward he stirred many outside elements into his plotlines in equal or sometimes greater measure than the giallo components. Two years after TORSO he directed SUSPICIOUS DEATH OF A MINOR, a film that mashes three genres: poliziottesco (cops and criminals), giallo, and slapstick comedy. No wonder this guy is hard to pin down.\n\nThough TORSO is one of his less substantive gialli in terms of character depth, it is a crowd pleaser, especially for those of us whose gateway to giallo cinema was slasher movies. If Martino’s other four entries had featured the same levels of graphic violence, scantily clad college girls, and horror-style suspense, he would probably be more widely recognized as one of the genre’s greats. Even if, at the same time, we’d be losing out on films that are more diverse and, ultimately, rewarding.\n\n***\n\nMy informal, very personal, highly-subject-to-change ranking of Martino’s gialli, from favorite to least favorite (though I like them all):\n\nYOUR VICE IS A LOCKED ROOM AND ONLY I HAVE THE KEY\n\nTORSO\n\nTHE STRANGE VICE OF MRS. WARDH\n\nALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK\n\nTHE CASE OF THE SCORPION’S TAIL\n\nWhat it is: A Blu-ray, DVD, and CD set from Severin Films\n\nWhat’s included:\n\n1) The 1972 feature film ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK, directed by Sergio Martino, on Blu-ray (region A)\n\n2) The CD soundtrack of the film’s score by composer Bruno Nicolai\n\n3) A new, original, feature-length documentary ALL THE COLORS OF GIALLO on Blu-ray (all-region)\n\n4) 80+ trailers of classic giallo films, included on the documentary Blu-ray.\n\n5) A DVD compilation of Krimi trailers (Krimi are noirish German murder mysteries similar to, but predating, Italian giallo films).\n\n6) A CD compilation of theme songs and music-score excerpts from popular giallo films.\n\nBonus features include interviews with filmmakers and film historians as well as audio commentaries by giallo historian Kat Ellinger. Below I review the individual components.\n\nThe movie: ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK is the third giallo in the career of versatile Italian director Sergio Martino (TORSO, THE VIOLENT PROFESSIONALS). Set in London, the story centers on Jane (Edwige Fenech), a woman beset by bizarre, violent nightmares ever since a car accident claimed the life of her unborn child.\n\nLive-in boyfriend Richard (George Hilton) helpfully insists that taking vitamins will stop the nightmares. Jane’s doctor advises therapy. Jane instead chooses option three, suggested by her mysterious new neighbor, Mary (Marina Malfatti): a black mass. Surprisingly, this black mass does not stop the nightmares, and Jane now finds herself pursued by murderous devil worshippers. As the bodies start to pile up, Jane is forced to ask, “What terrible decision can I make next?”\n\nNo one watches giallo films for plot logic. Gialli are about stylish visuals, violent set-pieces, and good-looking people screwing each other in bed and in life. ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK delivers on all counts and is probably Martino’s most visually captivating movie. It’s dreamy, hypnotic, and sometimes jarring, with the camera swooping, tracking, rising, rack focusing, and going into kaleidoscope mode.\n\nMy only real critique—which will probably get me into trouble with fans—is the lead character. I adore Edwige Fenech as much as any human does, and her performance is fine. The problem arises in Jane being an unlikable protagonist. From the opening sequence, she’s close to hysteria and stays that way throughout the film. She is, in a word, baroque. At some point you just want her to take a valium and chill the fuck out.\n\nThe Blu-ray: Severin did a nice job on the scan. Yeah, it’s grainy in spots, but unless JJ Abrams is enough of a fan to restore every frame of a movie, low-budget flicks from the 1970s are going to show grain when presented in HD. The important thing is color saturation. It’s called ALL THE COLORS IN THE DARK for a reason, and those colors tend toward vibrant greens and rich purples.\n\nThe documentary: ALL THE COLORS OF GIALLO, mostly in Italian with English subtitles, gets more interesting as it goes along. The first half covers now-familiar territory for fans, from the yellow-covered detective novels that gave the genre its name, to Mario Bava’s establishing entries, to Argento’s global impact. If you’re willing to drop $30 on a Blu-ray documentary about giallo films, you already know this stuff inside and out. Fortunately, the second half gets much more interesting as they dig into the works of other filmmakers and bring out directors Martino, Luciano Ercoli, and Umberto Lenzi, screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi, and giallo stars Barbara Bouchet, George Hilton, and Susan Scott for on-camera interviews (using archival footage of those who are no longer with us). There’s also an audio recording of Lucio Fulci shit-talking Dario Argento, which is worth the price alone.\n\n4 hours of giallo trailers: “4 hours of trailers” kinda sells itself, doesn’t it? I’m a trailer-comp junkie, so Severin didn’t even need the other content to get my $$.\n\nThe CDs: Picture a place where romantic orchestral music, progressive rock, and jazz co-exist in weird, fantastical harmony. Seriously, Severin, just release some best-of giallo composer CDs. They will sell.\n\nThe DVD: Didn’t watch it.\n\nStar rating: Do I seem like someone who would do star ratings? Get outta here with that.\n\nNote: I purchased all of the above in a limited-edition set inside a slipcase (see lead image), but the movie and its soundtrack can be purchased separately from the documentary, trailer compilations, and various-composers CD on Severin’s website, Amazon, and Diabolik DVD. Please be advised that some or all of the bonus content described above may be limited-run offerings. Visit Severin’s site for details.\n\nFor curious movie buffs and budding cinephiles, discovering the wonders of global cinema can be an awakening. Other people are content to catch the latest superhero blockbuster or sci-fi/action franchise film at the local multiplex, and there’s nothing wrong with that (if one desires a banal, meaningless existence). But some of us are driven by a craving for the strange and exotic.\n\nIf you’re in the early stages of your world-cinema adventure, perhaps the term giallo has piqued your interest. Giallo refers to a genre of film—largely produced in Italy but sometimes elsewhere in Europe—that is superficially similar to but predates North American slasher movies.\n\nThere are two basic rules:\n\nGialli are murder mysteries. If there are no murders and no mystery to be solved, it’s not a giallo.\n\nGialli are not supernatural tales. If the film features a ghost, demon, witch, or a zombie, it’s not a giallo. in a giallo, the killer is human.\n\nGialli and slasher films are similar in that they involve characters being picked off one by one, and both genres are intended to thrill and frighten by employing cinema’s traditional lurid elements: nudity and graphic violence.\n\nHowever, gialli are typically richer in commentary on culture and society. They often satirize the decadence and corruption of the wealthy, the church, government, and other institutions, or they mock bourgeois hang-ups and indulgences and the seedier aspects of modern life.\n\nMost importantly, Gialli are stylish, lurid, and sensual. That’s why we watch them.\n\nCharacteristics of giallo cinema:\n\nThey are as much crime dramas as horror movies\n\nThey tend to be suffused with eroticism\n\nThey often juxtapose modern lifestyle, music, and fashion with old-world European architecture (sometimes using the latter to symbolize hidden madness or decaying sanity)\n\nGenre directors frequently use color and other visual cues to tie characters, scenes, objects, and events together\n\nMany feature jazz, jazz fusion, or instrumental progressive-rock scores\n\nTake an Agatha Christie mystery, imbue it with painterly visuals and a cosmopolitan air, and ladle on generous helpings of sex and violence. That’s a giallo.\n\nA not-too-boring history: The word “giallo” means “yellow” in Italian and refers to the color used for the covers of violent and sexy detective novels had been popular in that country since the 1930s.\n\nInfluential Italian director Mario Bava piggybacked on the popularity of these books, inventing the film version of genre either with 1963’s black-and-white thriller The Girl Who Knew Too Much or his 1964 release, Blood and Black Lace, depending on whom you ask (I lean toward the latter because a giallo in black and white is film noir in my view, and Girl seems too naive and comedic to fit the genre proper).\n\nBlood and Black Lace is a vivid, color-saturated body-count thriller set in a fashion house where beautiful models are being killed by a masked slasher. Not long after, director Umberto Lenzi (of Cannibal Ferox notoriety) delivered a string of gialli including Orgasmo and So Sweet … so Perverse. But it was auteur filmmaker Dario Argento’s global smash The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (1970) that unleashed a title wave. As many as 200 gialli followed over the next decade and a half.\n\nEvery giallo fan has their favorites, but here are 15 I recommend:\n\nBlood and Black Lace (1964): It’s the seminal film in the genre and a must see.\n\nThe Bird with Crystal Plumage (1970): Argento’s blockbuster debut is stylish and cosmopolitan, and it cemented the genre’s signature qualities.\n\nThe Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh (1970): The first of Sergio Martino’s five gialli is sexy and stylish, and it takes more turns than a Grand Prix driver. Featuring giallo cinema’s favorite star, Edwige Fenech.\n\nBay of Blood (1971): Mario Bava’s grisly thriller is not only one of the bloodiest of all gialli, it’s also the launch pad for the slasher genre.\n\nBlack Belly of the Tarantula (1971): Director Paolo Cavara’s fan favorite features all the classic giallo elements and could serve as a starting point for those who want to discover what the scene is all about (see lead image above).\n\nA Lizard in a Woman’s Skin (1971): Horror fans familiar with Lucio Fulci’s blood-drenched zombie classics may be surprised by this sexy and psychedelic murder mystery.\n\nAll the Colors of the Dark (1972): Martino’s third giallo, also starring Fenech, isn’t the most coherent story ever filmed, but visually it’s superb.\n\nDon’t Torture a Duckling (1972): Fulci delivers another strong giallo, this time with the darker, gloomier mood we’re used to seeing in his splatter films.\n\nThe Red Queen Kills Seven Times (1972): One of the prettier movies in the genre in terms of locations, deployment of color, and cast (led by the stunning Barbara Bouchet).\n\nWhat Have You Done to Solange? (1972): Massimo Dallamano’s well-made thriller might be thought of as a “classy” giallo with its Hollywood-grade production values. If crotch stabbings can be considered classy.\n\nWho Saw Her Die? (1972): A eerie and well-shot chiller directed by the underrated Aldo Lado, with an unnerving score by Ennio Morricone.\n\nBlue Eyes of the Broken Doll (1973): This lurid and entertaining Spanish giallo demonstrates the difference between the cosmopolitan Italian approach and the Spanish horror industry’s ingrained gothic tradition.\n\nTorso (1973): Director Martino’s best-known giallo eschews the visual elegance of his previous efforts and delivers straight horror. The third act is a blueprint for slasher films, including the “final girl” scenario.\n\nDeep Red (1975): Dario Argento’s magnum opus is perhaps cinema’s best-known giallo. If you’re only going to watch one …\n\nTenebrae (1982): Once more, Dario Argento proves the master of the genre by delivering a late-cycle classic dripping with blood and packed with twists that play out with razzle-dazzle camerawork.\n\nAfter the barrage of bloody horror that splashed across theater screens in 1981, the volume of releases normalized to a more sustainable level the following year. It turned out there were only so many audience dollars to go around.\n\nThough the quantity of titles was lower, 1982 offered good variety. Instead of slasher after slasher, we got aliens, mutants, new gialli, a demonic possession/haunted house flick, and the return of anthology horror, which had fallen out of favor midway through the 1970s after Amicus faded into oblivion. There was also a comic book superhero monster in Swamp Thing, a sexy, stylish Hollywood remake in Cat People, and a rare R-rated stop-motion monster movie in Q, the Winged Serpent. None of which appear on the list below.\n\nMy Top 10 Horror Films of 1982\n\nThe Thing\n\nThis is the easiest decision of this entire blog series. The Thing, the pinnacle of John Carpenter’s career, is as close to a perfect horror film as you’ll see. It seamlessly builds from eerie to unnerving to outright scary. It’s perfectly cast. The music score gets under your skin (like a shape-shifting alien), and Rob Bottin’s make-up FX work is both innovative and surreal. In short, this film deserves the near-universal adulation it gets from fans.\n\nTenebrae\n\nIn the early 1970s, the giallo film was all the rage, with a new one hitting theater screens every other weekend. But by the beginning of 1982, the genre had seemingly seen its last razor-wielding, black-gloved killer.\n\nUntil Dario Argento said, “Not so fast,” and delivered this killer classic that plays like a “giallo’s greatest hits” film. I didn’t know what giallo was when I first saw Tenebrae way back when, but I couldn’t have asked for a better introduction.\n\nCreepshow\n\nIn 1982, George A Romero returned to the horror genre for the first time in four years to deliver this homage to classic horror comics, using a script written by Stephen King. The individual stories lack the clever twists associated with those old comics, but the visuals are a feast: garish colors, striking transitions from artwork to live action, and now-classic make-up FX by Tom Savini, who was, by this point, almost as legendary to genre fans as his two collaborators mentioned above.\n\nForbidden World\n\nIn my previous post, I praised New World Pictures’ Galaxy of Terror for being exceptionally creative and ambitious when the producers could have just as easily have crapped out some exploitation fare featuring a rubber monster chasing after topless models. Well, New World took the latter route with this follow up, and we ended up getting a delightfully entertaining piece of trash about an alien that reduces humans to blobs of bloody protein for easier consumption. Forbidden World is a real grindhouse treasure.\n\nPieces\n\nIf the previous film on this list is a grindhouse treasure, Pieces is a grindhouse legend. The slasher/giallo hybrid features genre favs Christopher George, Jack Taylor, and Paul Smith, absurd dialog, a hilarious array of red herrings, gallons of splatter, a nonsensical ending, and the single worst moment of acting in the history of movies.\n\nThis flick is the kind of delirious cinematic mess that compels me to shout derisive comments at the screen, yet I can’t imagine life without it.\n\nBasket Case\n\nYou know how you can often recognize when a film was made, give or take a year, by the “look” of it? Early 80s horror looks different from late 80s horror, for example, and micro-budget American splatter flicks from the early 80s have an aesthetic you can spot instantly: hard lighting, a slight graininess, compressed audio, and fake blood of a deep crimson that filmmakers can’t seem to capture on camera anymore. And the subject matter tends to be in bad taste.\n\nCult director Frank Henenlotter‘s Basket Case is the quintessential flick in that idiom, the cinematic equivalent of a really good punk rock album on an indie record label. To “normals” raised on big-budget Hollywood spectacle and over-produced pop music, it’s the sort of artistic creation that would be labeled “garbage” in two seconds and is likely to offend on multiple levels. But if you’re the kind of person who gets it, you love it.\n\nThe Beast Within\n\nThe Beast Within combines elements of 1950s sci-fi films about mutated humans and oversized bugs and repackages them as a gory, slimy horror film. The plot: a woman is raped by a giant beetle and gives birth to a son who, 17 years later … turns into a giant beetle. Lots of townsfolk meet bloody ends.\n\nPerhaps inspired by the spectacular werewolf transformations depicted in American Werewolf in London and The Howling a year earlier, the producers hired then up-and-coming make-up FX artist Tom Burman to concoct a man-into-bug metamorphosis sequence that turned into perhaps the most over-the-top transformation scene ever filmed. No shot was too absurd to be included in the final cut, which may have been ridiculous at the time but garnered the film some long-term notoriety.\n\nPoltergeist\n\nSome readers will scoff at Poltergeist sitting all the way down here at number 8. Of course, it’s a horror classic with many iconic moments. For my taste, though, it’s a little too Hollywood, a little too glitzy, and little too reliant on the light show. Few do spectacle better than Steven Spielberg, but I would like to have seen Tobe Hooper unleashed and free to go for an R rating.\n\nThe New York Ripper\n\nShifting from Poltergeist to The New York Ripper could blow a listicle’s transmission, but for you I’ll take the risk.\n\nLike his countryman Dario Argento, Italian splatter maestro Lucio Fulci returned to the giallo film in 1982 and delivered what is surely that genre’s most gruesome and violent production. Fulci was never about elegantly orchestrated camera moves and clever staging. He was about the visceral aspects of life and death, and there’s one kill in this film so disturbingly visceral it has led some genre fans to declare that Fulci went too far. To me, if a film’s participants are consulting adults of sound mind, and no one is actually in danger, there is no “too far.” That doesn’t mean I think the scene is ho-hum. It’s kinda fucked up, actually.\n\nAmityville II: The Possession\n\nBy mainstream cinephile standards, this sequel does not compare to the original on any level. By my standards, it’s actually better. As stated in earlier posts in this series, I believe less money generally leads to better horror, because the real scary stuff doesn’t require A-list actors and Hollywood razzle dazzle.\n\nAmityville II: The Possession is creepier, gorier, more violent, and easily more disturbing than its predecessor. It’s a horror film, for fuck’s sake. Those are good qualities. And Burt Young goes to some dark places with his character.\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nFriday the 13th Part III\n\nI believe there are two groups of Friday the 13th fans: The ones who favor the darker, grimmer early films and those who find the later, campier ones more entertaining. I belong to the former group. Horror is supposed to be scary, IMO.\n\nThat said, Part III is the weakest of the four “classic” films. It offers some good kills as well as my favorite pre-zombie Jason make-up. However, the blurry 3D footage is annoying in 2D, and there are too few likable characters. I like it, but better films bumped it from my top 10.\n\nHalloween III: Season of the Witch\n\nThat time John Carpenter said, “Let’s make a Halloween movie without Michael Myers.” A divisive decision to be sure. On the one hand, the concept, plot, and execution are absurd, and I can see why so many fans dismiss this entry. On the other hand, the concept, plot, and execution are absurd enough to be audacious and ironically cool. It probably doesn’t add up to the sum of its parts, but Halloween III: Season of the Witch did manage to produce some iconic genre moments.\n\nThe Slayer\n\nPerhaps this obscurity shouldn’t warrant “honorable mention” over Cat People, Swamp Thing, Slumber Party Massacre, Parasite, House Where Evil Dwells, and a number of other titles released that year, but I’ve long had a soft spot for it. The Slayer is a bit rough around the edges, but it’s legitimately creepy and desolate, and it digs more deeply into the human psyche than most low-budget horror flicks do."
