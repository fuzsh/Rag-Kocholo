Lleyton Hewitt turned pro in 1998 and won his first tournament the same year. His long blonde hair and brash style reminded many of the young Andre Agassi, and Hewitt became a favorite heartthrob of teen tennis fans. He first played for Australia's Davis Cup team in 1999, and competed at Sydney in the 2000 Summer Olympics. Hewitt beat Pete Sampras in the finals of the 2001 U.S. Open to claim his first Grand Slam singles championship. The next year he won the Wimbledon men's singles title with a straight-sets win over David Nalbandian. In 2005 Hewitt reached the finals of the Australian Open, and the semifinals at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, but he has not returned to the finals of a Grand Slam tournament since. Hewitt won the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship in Houston in April of 2009, bagging his first tour win since 2007.
