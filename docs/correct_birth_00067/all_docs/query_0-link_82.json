        "text": "Lleyton Hewitt cannot be certain that he was born in Adelaide on February 24, 1981. He has no clear recollection of the fact and must take his mother's word for it. What he does know, with an increasingly uncomfortable conviction, is that he was born at the wrong time. He is less than six months older than Roger Federer for one thing, provided Federer's mum is telling the truth, and the Swiss champion has dominated their era since the Australian's two grand slam titles, at the US in 2001 and here a year later.\n\nHe is 27 but it is a high-mileage 27 and a second-hand car dealer would be tempted to turn back the clock if he had him on his forecourt, what with his hip condition and talk of retirement, possibly next year. Since March he has played a Davis Cup tie and only two tournaments.\n\nHewitt has always been a baseline scrapper whose main weapons have been speed, a strong return of serve and well honed survival instincts. These days every match is a war. Yesterday it took him five sets to beat Robin Haase, 21 and making his Wimbledon debut. Hewitt, the only champion in the draw apart from Federer, is making his 10th straight appearance here. He is ranked 27 in the world but seeded 20.\n\nThe Dutchman is ranked 62nd and looked gauche, though dangerously talented, and yesterday he took Hewitt to the wire. Fernando Gonzalez will present bigger problems in the third round and Federer may be his opponent in the fourth.\n\nThere is a sense that the Australian is a player at odds with his era. Even his back-to-front baseball cap and his clenched-fist \"C'mon\" seem strangely dated. In his new book, A Champion's Mind, Pete Sampras makes an interesting assessment of the Australian: \"Lleyton liked having a target but in his era guys stopped coming to the net. Hewitt was a victim of his time.\n\n\"As Lleyton became more and more vulnerable he was having to work harder and harder to win matches. When you play with a grinder's mentality, like Lleyton did, you rely a lot on mental intensity. But no matter how tough you are, it's hard to keep up that hard-working, patient style. Eventually it catches up with you and you get a little burned out.\" Note how Sampras refers to Hewitt in the past tense.\n\nBut Hewitt's struggle is symbolic of a wider malaise in the Australian game. In 1971, when John Newcombe was the men's champion and Evonne Goolagong the women's, there were 46 Australians in the two singles competitions; this year there are five, two men and three women.\n\n\"It used to be run of the mill for an Australian to win Wimbledon,\" says Newcombe, recalling such champions as Lew Hoad, Rod Laver, Roy Emerson and Pat Cash as well as himself, and runners-up such as Ken Rosewall and Pat Rafter.\n\nPoor administration - though the coaching system has now been totally revamped - and competition from other sports have hit the Australian game and Newcombe says: \"It's going to be a long road back but the next year or two is going to be very important. Young players will have to see the same work ethic as we see in eastern Europe and South America.\"\n\nThere is still nothing wrong with Hewitt's work ethic. It took him three hours and 36 minutes to get past Haase and he dug so deep that he almost tunnelled home. \"Competing is one of my biggest assets,\" he said.\n\nHis dodgy hip made him grimace and he was also warned by the umpire after falling foul of a foot-faulting linesman. He lost the first set on a tie-break but won the next 6-3 and when he took the third by the same score he appeared to be in control. But Haase fought back to win the fourth on a tie-break (7-1) before Hewitt showed his experience by closing out the match 6-2 in the fifth.\n\n\"I'd hardly seen him play before but I talked to a number of people and they all told me he was dangerous and they were right,\" said Hewitt afterwards. The hip was hurting again. We will not see much more of him here and after him there is great uncertainty. The legend of Australian tennis is strong, the legacy less assured."
