        "text": "Son-of-a-champion Cruz Hewitt’s Australian Open boys’ singles debut ended in a straight-sets defeat on Sunday, but not before displaying some uncanny resemblances to his former world No.1 dad.\n\nThe 15-year-old wildcard – one of the country’s most promising young players – lost 6-2, 6-3 to sixth-seeded American Alexander Razeghi in a contest lasting just short of an hour-and-a-half on a packed court three full of fans keen to see Lleyton Hewitt’s son in action.\n\nLleyton was front and centre in Cruz’s player box, along with wife Bec, the teenager’s coach Peter Luczak, Jaymon Crabb and Jordan Thompson, while John Millman arrived mid-match and instantly became a source of support.\n\nLleyton’s parents, Glynn and Cherilyn, were also in the stands, while former Western Bulldogs player-turned-Essendon assistant coach Daniel Giansiracusa was another interested onlooker.\n\nSpeaking to Channel Nine on Sunday morning before Cruz’s match, Lleyton – now Australia’s Davis Cup captain after a stellar playing career – said he was “unbelievably proud” of his son.\n\n“He has a coach, Peter Luczak, who works with him, but they asked me late last night if I’d go out and warm him up on show court three,” Hewitt said.\n\n“[It was] just a really special moment. My first-ever main draw match at the Australian Open was actually out on show court three as well, so just some great memories coming back of me playing here.\n\n“He’s been around the traps, but he’s worked extremely hard to get his opportunity. He’s playing well, but he’s still very young. This is all a learning experience, and that’s what the junior event is all about.\n\n“You want to get the opportunity to play here in seniors one day, and he’s been fortunate enough to get a wildcard, and, hopefully, he goes out there and has a lot of fun today.”\n\nThe similarities between Cruz and his dual grand slam-winning father were instantly recognisable: the backwards Nike cap, necklace, fiddling with his racquet strings, the double-handed backhand and even the wind-up on both his forehand and backhand.\n\nOne distinct difference was Hewitt jnr’s service action, which he hit five aces off, including a pair of 184km/h bullets late in the match.\n\nAustralia’s former Billie Jean King Cup captain and one-time world No.8 Alicia Molik described Cruz on Thursday as “one of our best juniors”, noting his game also shared similarities with Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios.\n\n“He plays similarly to Lleyton, [but] I know he’s a big fan of Nick Kyrgios. If you watch his forehand; he has a really similar technique to Nick,” Molik said.\n\n“Lleyton beat [Andre] Agassi in the final of Adelaide when he was 15, [but] Cruz is doing exceptionally well. I haven’t seen him play a match before, but I hear great things – he is pretty resilient, is competitive. He’s obviously spent a lot of time around professional tennis, too, which I think really helps him.”\n\nCruz mixed up his shots well, using off-pace balls and slice while demonstrating an ability to create his own power, particularly off his forehand, and actively looked to move forward and get to the net, but the error count (38 to Razeghi’s 13) hurt him.\n\nThere was also plenty to like in the way Cruz hustled around the court, showing stout defence at times, including earning a nod of approval from his dad after one such point despite losing an extended rally in the fifth game.\n\nMillman’s arrival with Cruz a set and 0-3 down seemed to spark the teenager, and he began repeatedly turning to the former Davis Cup player for approval. He flashed a smile at Millman after holding for 3-5, after which the latter told him “you’re doing great”.\n\nLoading\n\nSpeaking to this masthead afterwards, Millman said it was his turn to “return the favour” for Cruz supporting him in matches.\n\n“I’ve known Cruz for a long time, and whenever I’m playing, and he’s been at the tournaments, he’s always been a vocal supporter,” Millman said. “He’s definitely got game and ability. Today was a good learning experience for him, and I’m confident he’ll be back next year bigger and better.”\n\nLeft-handed Razeghi turns 18 in May, so is far older and more experienced than his Australian opponent, who, at No.201, is the country’s top-ranked boy in the ITF rankings among those born in 2008."
