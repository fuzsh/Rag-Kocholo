        "text": "Lleyton Hewitt (Australia) has played 43 five-set matches at Grand Slam tennis tournaments, with a win-loss record of 26-17. Hewitt took part in two five-setters at Slams in 2014 - a first-round defeat to Andreas Seppi at the Australian Open to equal Andre Agassi's 41 five-set Grand Slam matches, and a second-round loss to Jerzy Janowicz at Wimbledon which gave him the record outright. In 2015, Hewitt crashed out of the Australian Open with a five-set, second-round defeat to Benjamin Becker - the 43rd time Hewitt had been the distance at a Grand Slam. Only Pete Sampras (USA) has won more five-set matches than Hewitt at Grand Slams - 29 (out of 38 in total). Hewitt's two five-set matches in 2014: Australian Open, Round 1, lost to Andreas Seppi (Italy), 6-7, 3-6, 7-5, 7-5, 5-7; Wimbledon, Round 2, lost to Jerzy Janowicz (Poland), 5-7, 4-6, 7-6, 6-4, 3-6. Hewitt didn't take part in five-set matches at either the 2014 French Open or the 2014 US Open. On 22 January 2015, he lost 6-2, 6-1, 3-6, 4-6, 2-6 to Benjamin Becker to end his Australian Open campaign.\n\nKnown for his never-say-die attitude and wearing his cap back-to-front, Lleyton Hewitt was born in Adelaide on 24 February 1981. He turned professional in 1998 and has won two Grand Slam titles, the US Open in 2001 and Wimbledon in 2002. Other career highlights include three consecutive titles (2000-02) at London's Queen's Club (the pre-Wimbledon tournament currently known as the Aegon Championships) and four titles (2000-01, 2004-05) on home soil in Sydney (the tournament that takes place each January, immediately before the Australian Open). At the start of the 2015 Australian Open, Hewitt's singles ranking was 86.\n\nAndre Agassi's 41 five-set matches were achieved in a professional career that ran from 1986 until 2006. Pete Sampras' 29 wins in five-set matches came during a professional career that lasted from 1988 until 2003."
