        "text": "Born in Australia, Hewitt, 35, began playing tennis in his early teens; aged 20, he became the youngest male player to be ranked world No 1. He won the US Open in 2001, Wimbledon in 2002 and helped Australia to Davis Cup victories in 1999 and 2003. He retired earlier this year, and is commentating on Wimbledon for the BBC. He is married to the actor Bec Hewitt, has three children and lives in Melbourne.\n\nWhen were you happiest?\n\nWhen my kids were born.\n\nWhat is your greatest fear?\n\nDeath.\n\nWhat is your earliest memory?\n\nGoing to my dad’s football matches – he played Australian rules professionally - around the corner from where we lived in Adelaide.\n\nWhich living person do you most admire, and why?\n\nGreg Norman, for the way he handles winning and losing.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in yourself?\n\nAs a tennis player you have to be selfish; it all stops with you.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in others?\n\nBeing too arrogant.\n\nWhat was your most embarrassing moment?\n\nDuring the Wimbledon final in 2002 when a streaker came on to the court. I didn’t know what the hell was going on.\n\nAside from a property, what’s the most expensive thing you’ve bought?\n\nA black Ferrari 360 Spider in 2004. Too much!\n\nWhat would your super power be?\n\nBeing able to knock down walls.\n\nWhat or who is the greatest love of your life?\n\nMy wife. We met at a charity tennis day, then didn’t speak for five years as we were both in other relationships.\n\nWhat do you most dislike about your appearance?\n\nI am just over 5ft 11in. Anything over 6ft would be handy.\n\nIf you could bring something extinct back to life, what would you choose?\n\nDinosaurs.\n\nWhat is your most unappealing habit?\n\nMy kids have a go at me for chewing with my mouth open.\n\nWhich words do you most overuse?\n\n“Come on!”\n\nWhat is top of your bucket list?\n\nI would love to play in an Australian rules grand final.\n\nWhat is your guiltiest pleasure?\n\nStarbucks Frappuccino.\n\nWho would you invite to your dream dinner party?\n\nMuhammad Ali.\n\nWhat is the worst job you’ve done?\n\nI was fortunate to be a tennis player from such a young age, so just cleaning my room as a teenager, or doing the dishes.\n\nIf you could go back in time, where would you go?\n\nCentre court, Wimbledon, 2002, picking up the trophy. It’s like an out-of-body experience and you don’t have enough time to take it in.\n\nWhen did you last cry, and why?\n\nMy kids wrote a song for me, recorded it on to a CD and it was played before my last Australian Open. I had no idea until I heard it live on TV.\n\nWhat single thing would improve the quality of your life?\n\nTo move like I did in my early 20s. I’ve had knee and hip surgery, and my toe joint fused since.\n\nWhat keeps you awake at night?\n\nMy wife cleaning.\n\nHow would you like to be remembered?\n\nAs someone who got the absolute most out of themselves."
