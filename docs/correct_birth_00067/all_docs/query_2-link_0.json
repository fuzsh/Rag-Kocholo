        "text": "Australian tennis coach and former tennis player (born 1981)\n\nLleyton Glynn Hewitt (born 24 February 1981) is an Australian former world No. 1 tennis player. He is the most recent Australian man to win a major singles title, at the 2001 US Open and 2002 Wimbledon Championships. In November 2001, Hewitt became, at the time, the youngest man to reach No. 1 in the ATP singles rankings, at the age of 20 years, 8 months and 26 days. In total, he won 30 singles titles and 3 doubles titles, including the 2000 US Open men's doubles title, back-to-back Tour Finals titles in 2001 and 2002, and the Davis Cup with Australia in 1999 and 2003. Between 1997 and 2016, Hewitt contested a record twenty consecutive Australian Open men's singles tournaments, his best result being runner-up in 2005. He was also the runner-up at the 2004 US Open.\n\nHewitt was born in Adelaide, South Australia. His father, Glynn, is a former Australian rules football player, and his mother, Cherilyn, was a physical education teacher. His younger sister is Jaslyn Hewitt, a former tennis coach and bodybuilder, and his brother-in-law (Jaslyn's husband) is Rob Shehadie. Hewitt also played Australian Football until the age of 13, when he decided to pursue a tennis career.[2] His junior tennis club was Seaside Tennis Club in Henley Beach.[3] He was also coached by Peter Smith at Denman Tennis Club in Mitcham.[4]\n\nHewitt commenced his professional career in 1998.[5] He became one of the youngest winners of an Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) tournament when he won the 1998 Next Generation Adelaide International, defeating Jason Stoltenberg in the final, having defeated Andre Agassi in the semi-finals.[5] Both Aaron Krickstein winning Tel Aviv in 1983 and Michael Chang winning San Francisco in 1988 were younger than Hewitt when they claimed their first ATP title. Hewitt then left Immanuel College to concentrate on his tennis career.[6] He was an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder.[7] He finished his professional tennis career on 24 January 2016 after 20 straight Australian Open appearances. His last professional singles match was against David Ferrer in the second round of the 2016 Australian Open at the Rod Laver Arena on 21 January 2016. In 2022, Lleyton Hewitt was inducted into the ‘International Tennis Hall of Fame.’[8]\n\nAs a junior Hewitt posted a 44–19 record in singles and reached as high as No. 17 in the world in 1997 (and No. 13 in doubles).\n\nLegend (singles) Grand Slam (0) Grade A (0) Grade B (0) Grade 1–5 (1)\n\nNo. Date Tournament Surface Opponent Score 1. 8 April 1997 Manila, Philippines Hard Wesley Whitehouse 6–4, 6–3\n\nIn 2000, Hewitt reached his first Grand Slam final at the Wimbledon mixed doubles partnering Belgian Kim Clijsters, his then girlfriend. They lost the match, to Americans Kimberly Po and Donald Johnson.[9] Hewitt later won his first Grand Slam title at the US Open when he along with Max Mirnyi claimed the men's doubles championship, thus becoming the youngest male (at 19 years, 6 months) to win a Grand Slam doubles crown in the open era.[10] At the end of the year, Hewitt became the first teenager in ATP history to qualify for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup (ATP World Tour Finals).[11]\n\nHewitt started off the 2001 season well by winning the title in Sydney.[12] He went on to win back-to-back tournaments in Queen's and 's-Hertogenbosch.[13] He captured his first Grand Slam singles title at the US Open, comprehensively defeating former world No. 1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the semi-finals, and four-time champion Pete Sampras the next day in straight sets (7-6, 6-1, 6-1).[14][15] This win made Hewitt the most recent male player to win a Grand Slam singles and doubles title during his career. The Australian went on to win the Tokyo Open,[16] and he again qualified for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup, held in Sydney. During the tournament, Hewitt won all matches in his group;[17] with his round-robin victory against Pat Rafter, Hewitt secured the year-end world No. 1 ranking for the first time.[18] Hewitt went on to defeat Sébastien Grosjean in the final to take the title and cement his position as the world number one.[19]\n\n2002 started with disappointment for Hewitt, as he lost in the first round of the Australian Open, his home Grand Slam. This was the first time the number 1 seed had lost in the opening round of the Australia Open, although Hewitt was still recovering from chickenpox.[20] The next few months proved more successful for Hewitt and he cemented his position as the best player in the world by winning three titles: San Jose, Indian Wells and Queen's.[21] His victory against Andre Agassi in the final of San Jose was heralded as one of the greatest matches of the season.[22][23] He followed his 2001 US Open win by capturing the Wimbledon singles title. He defeated Jonas Björkman, Grégory Carraz, Julian Knowle, Mikhail Youzhny, Sjeng Schalken and dispatched home favourite Tim Henman - a rematch of their recent Queen's final - before dominating first-time finalist David Nalbandian in straight sets in the championship match;[24][25][26] Hewitt lost only two sets (both to Schalken) throughout the championship.[27] His victory reinforced the idea that, although the tournament had tended to be dominated by serve-and-volleyers, a baseliner could still triumph on grass (Hewitt was the first 'baseliner' to win the tournament since Agassi in 1992). Hewitt was the last man outside the so-called \"Big Four\" to win Wimbledon until Carlos Alcaraz in 2023.[28]\n\nFor his third straight year, he qualified for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup, held in Shanghai, and successfully defended his title by defeating Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final.[29] Hewitt's win helped him finish the year ranked No. 1 for a second straight year, becoming the seventh man to achieve this feat.[30]\n\nIn 2003, Hewitt defeated former No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten for the championship at Indian Wells.[31] But at Wimbledon, as the defending champion, Hewitt lost in the first round to qualifier Ivo Karlović. Hewitt became the first defending Wimbledon men's champion in the open era to lose in the first round. Only once before in the tournament's 126-year history had a defending men's champion lost in the opening round: in 1967, when Manuel Santana was beaten by Charlie Pasarell.[32] Hewitt was only the third defending Grand Slam champion in the open era to lose in the first round, after Boris Becker at the 1997 Australian Open and Patrick Rafter at the 1999 US Open. After Wimbledon in 2003, Hewitt lost in the final of the tournament in Los Angeles, the second round of the ATP Masters Series tournament in Montreal, and the first round of the ATP Masters Series tournament in Cincinnati.[33] At the US Open, Hewitt lost in the quarterfinals to Juan Carlos Ferrero.[34] Hewitt played only Davis Cup matches for the remainder of the year, recording five-set wins over Roger Federer[35] and Juan Carlos Ferrero in the semi-finals and final respectively, as Australia went on to win the Davis Cup.[36] Hewitt used much of his spare time in late 2003 to bulk up, gaining 7 kg.\n\nIn 2004, Hewitt became the first man in history to lose in each Grand Slam singles tournament to the eventual champion.[37] At the Australian Open, he was defeated in the fourth round by Roger Federer. At the French Open, he was defeated in a quarterfinal by Gastón Gaudio. At Wimbledon, he was defeated in a quarterfinal again by Federer. And, at the US Open, he was defeated in the final by Federer, losing two out of the three sets at love (6-0). At the year ending 2004 Tennis Masters Cup, Hewitt defeated Andy Roddick to advance to the final, but was yet again defeated by defending champion Federer.[38]\n\nIn 2005, Hewitt won his only title at the Sydney Medibank International defeating little-known Czech player Ivo Minář.[39] Hewitt spent much time in the late stages of 2004 working with his former coach and good friend, Roger Rasheed, on bulking up his physique. His hard work paid off during the Australian summer, when he defeated an in-form No. 2 Andy Roddick to reach his first Australian Open final in 2005. He was the first Australian player to reach the final since Pat Cash in 1988. In the final, he faced fourth seed, Marat Safin, who had defeated No. 1 and defending champion Roger Federer in the semi-finals. After easily taking the first set, he was defeated by the Russian despite being up a break in the third set.[40]\n\nAt Wimbledon, Hewitt reached the semi-finals, but lost to eventual champion Federer. Two months later, Hewitt again lost to Federer in the US Open semi-final, although this time he was able to take one set from the Swiss. Hewitt had at this point lost to the eventual champion at seven consecutive Grand Slam tournaments he played, (he missed the 2005 French Open because of injury).[41] Hewitt pulled out of the Tennis Masters Cup tournament in Shanghai in November 2005 so that he could be with his wife Bec, who was due to give birth.[42]\n\nHewitt was defeated in the second round of the 2006 Australian Open by Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina.[43] He then reached the finals of the San Jose and Las Vegas tournaments, losing to British youngster Andy Murray and American James Blake, respectively. But he lost to Tim Henman in the second round of the Miami Masters, a player he had defeated eight times previously in as many matches.[44] At the 2006 French Open, Hewitt reached the fourth round, where he lost to defending champion and eventual winner Rafael Nadal in four sets.[45]\n\nHewitt won his first tournament of 2006 (after a 17-month hiatus from winning a tournament), when he beat Blake in the final of the Queen's Club Championships. This was his fourth title there, equalling the records of John McEnroe and Boris Becker.[46] During the 2006 Wimbledon Championships, Hewitt survived a five-set match against South Korea's Hyung-Taik Lee that was played over two days. He then defeated Olivier Rochus and David Ferrer, before losing to Marcos Baghdatis in the quarterfinals.[47] At the 2006 Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., Hewitt was defeated by Arnaud Clément in the quarterfinals, after defeating Vincent Spadea in the second round and Denis Gremelmayr in the third round.[48]\n\nHewitt participated at the 2006 US Open, despite having an injured knee. Hewitt won his first three matches in straight sets against, respectively, Albert Montañés, Jan Hernych, and Novak Djokovic. He defeated Richard Gasquet in five sets to advance to the quarterfinals for the seventh consecutive year. He then lost to Roddick.[49]\n\nAt the 2007 Australian Open, Hewitt lost in the third round to tenth-seeded Chilean and eventual runner-up Fernando González. With his win in Las Vegas in March, Hewitt had won at least one ATP title annually for ten consecutive years. This was a record among active players at the time.[50] Hewitt reached the 2007 Hamburg Masters semi-finals, where he pushed eventual finalist Rafael Nadal to three sets.

Hewitt partnered with Sam Groth lost a tough Davis Cup semi-finals doubles tie against the British Murray brothers in 5 sets. Todd Woodbridge hailed it as the \"Best [doubles] I've watched for years.\"[99]\n\nHaving previously announced his intentions to retire after the 2016 Australian Open, Hewitt confirmed that his final season would consist of that, the Hopman Cup and the exhibition World Tennis Challenge.[100]\n\nIn his 20th appearance at the Australian Open, he won his first round match against fellow Australian James Duckworth in straight sets. He then lost in the second round in 3 straight competitive sets to 8th seed David Ferrer, 2–6, 4–6, 4–6. Post-match he was remembered by players including Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray and Nick Kyrgios as a man who was at the top of the game for years, and continually displayed the fighting spirit that he became synonymous with.\n\nHe was made a Member of the Order of Australia in the awards announced on Australia Day.[101][102]\n\nIn March Hewitt came out of retirement to replace the injured Nick Kyrgios in the first round Davis Cup against the US at the Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club. He played doubles with John Peers against the Bryan brothers. The Australian duo came back from two sets to love but lost the fifth set.\n\nHewitt was the subject of a book titled \"Facing Hewitt\" which features fifty interviews with professional tennis players who competed against him.\n\nIn June it was announced that Hewitt would be taking a wildcard into the Wimbledon doubles competition, playing alongside young compatriot Jordan Thompson.[103] In the first round, the pair saved eight match points to defeat Nicolás Almagro and David Marrero 19–17 in the deciding set.[104] However, they lost to the eighth seeds in the second round.\n\nIn December 2017, it was announced that Hewitt would come out of retirement and accept a doubles wildcard with compatriot Sam Groth at the 2018 Australian Open.\n\nHewitt and Jordan Thompson accepted a wildcard to play Doubles at the 2018 Brisbane International. They lost in the first round to Grigor Dimitrov and Ryan Harrison 3–6, 6–1, [5–10].\n\nHewitt then played in the fast4 exhibition in Sydney where he lost to Grigor Dimitrov. Hewitt and Kyrgios then went on to win the doubles beating Alexander Zverev and Grigor Dimitrov. After that, he played the Tie Break Tens in Melbourne where he won his opening match against Novak Djokovic, before losing to world No. 1 Rafael Nadal.\n\nIn the Australian Open doubles, Hewitt and Groth made a run to the quarterfinals, including a win over third seeds Jean-Julien Rojer and Horia Tecău.[105] This was his best doubles result at the Australian Open in his career.\n\nHewitt's doubles comeback continued with Lleyton playing doubles at the 2018 Estoril Open with Alex de Minaur where they defeated second seeds Michael Venus and Raven Klaasen before losing in the quarterfinals. He then reached the semi-finals of the 2018 Fuzion 100 Surbiton Trophy – Men's doubles with Alex Bolt before Venus and Klaasen gained revenge on Hewitt (this time with Alex Bolt) at the 2018 Rosmalen Grass Court Championships – Men's doubles.\n\nHewitt then teamed up with another Aussie, Nick Kyrgios at the 2018 Queen's Club Championships – Doubles tournament where they defeated number 3 seeds Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert before losing in the quarterfinals. At the 2018 Wimbledon Championships – Men's doubles, Hewitt was again wildcard with Alex Bolt however the pair again lost in the first round to Venus and Klaasen. After this loss, Hewitt teamed up with Jordan Thompson and lost in the first round of the 2018 Hall of Fame Tennis Championships in Newport.\n\nHewitt's last professional match of 2018 was in the 2018 Davis Cup World Group play-offs against Austria where Hewitt paired up with experienced doubles specialist John Peers to defeat the Austrian team of doubles specialist Oliver Marach and experienced clay-courier Juergen Melzer.\n\nIn 2019, Hewitt played doubles at a number of tournaments. In a pairing with Jordan Thompson, they lost in the first round of the Sydney International. A week later he teamed up with John-Patrick Smith at the Australian Open, yet again losing in the first round. Hewitt and countryman Jordan Thompson received a wildcard to play at the Wimbledon Championships. They reached the second round before losing to R. Klaasen and M. Venus in straight sets.\n\nAlso that year, he played doubles in New York, Houston, Surbiton, and 's-Hertogenbosch, playing with the likes of Alexei Popyrin and Thompson yet again.[106]\n\nHewitt once again featured in the Australian summer of tennis, this time choosing to participate in the new Adelaide International, the first time he had played tour-tennis in his home town for over a decade. He partnered Jordan Thompson but lost in the first round to Cristian Garín and Juan Ignacio Londero.[107] The two chose to compete at the Australian Open a week later, but lost in the first round in straight sets, to Korean duo Min-Kyu Song and Nam Ji-sung.[108]\n\nHewitt continues to commentate matches at the Australian Open.\n\nHewitt made his Davis Cup debut for Australia in the 1999 Davis Cup quarterfinals at age 18 against the United States in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. In the first rubber of the tie Hewitt faced No. 8 and Wimbledon quarter finalist Todd Martin. Hewitt caused a major upset over Martin and would go on to win his second singles rubber against Alex O'Brien as well. The great start to his Davis Cup career would continue in the 1999 semi-finals against Russia where he would record another two wins against Marat Safin and Yevgeny Kafelnikov. He would taste his first defeat in Davis Cup in the 1999 final against France but would become a Davis Cup champion anyway. In 2000 Hewitt and Australia would again make the Davis Cup final but fell to Spain in Barcelona.\n\nIn 2001 Hewitt would again be a part of the Australian team that would make the Davis Cup final but the Australians would lose the fifth rubber and hand France a 3–2 win. Determined to make amends for his last few finals, Hewitt led the Australian team to the 2003 Davis Cup final against Spain where he defeated Juan Carlos Ferrero in five sets. The team came away victorious 3–1 overall and Hewitt claimed his second Davis Cup title. By the age of 22, he had recorded more wins in Davis Cup singles than any other Australian player. Following the retirement of Pat Rafter and the semi-retirement of Mark Philippoussis, Hewitt would be forced to lead the Australian Davis Cup team with little success from his peers. In the 2006 quarterfinals in Melbourne, Hewitt defeated Belarusian Vladimir Voltchkov in just 91 minutes. Voltchkov said before the match that \"Hewitt has no weapons to hurt me.\" Hewitt responded, \"Voltchkov doesn't have a ranking [of 457] to hurt me.\" In the semi-finals in Buenos Aires on clay, Hewitt lost to Argentine José Acasuso in five sets.\n\nDespite a world group semi-final appearance in 2006, Hewitt and Australia would be relegated to the Asia/Oceania region in 2008. Hewitt continued showed his commitment to the team by competing in the regional ties but the team fell in the playoff stages every year between 2008 and 2011. In the 2011 playoffs, he played against Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka on a grass court in Sydney, losing both matches. In doubles, together with Chris Guccione, he was able to defeat Federer and Wawrinka, but this was not enough to take Australia to the World Group.[109]\n\nIn 2012, Hewitt won his single and doubles match against China in February, which allowed Australia to return to the playoffs where they lost to Germany. After defeating Chinese Taipei and Uzbekistan, Australia earned the right to get to the playoffs again in 2013. They ended up routing Poland 4–1 on their soil including a convincing 6–1 6–3 6–2 win for Hewitt over recent Wimbledon quarterfinalist Łukasz Kubot.[110] In 2014, Australia crashed out 5–0 in the World Group first round on the French clay of La Roche-sur-Yon. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga beat Hewitt both in singles and doubles.[111] Perth's grass courts would then be hosting yet another playoff tie for Australia in September 2014. Hewitt won both his singles match (against Farrukh Dustov) and the subsequent doubles rubber (partnering Chris Guccione v. Dustov and Istomin) in straight sets while up and coming Nick Kyrgios won his encounter with Denis Istomin to give Australia an unassailable 3–0 lead over Uzbekistan, thus enabling their country to return to the World Group in 2015. Sam Groth and Nick Kyrgios wrapped up a 5–0 victory a day later.[112] Australia will open their 2015 campaign in Czech Republic for a 6–8 March tie that is one of two worst-case scenarios for Australia.[113]\n\nHewitt played the Davis Cup match against Great Britain in the semi-finals of the 2015 Davis Cup. He played doubles with Sam Groth losing in five sets to brothers Andy and Jamie Murray.[114]\n\nHe came out of retirement to play the first round match against the United States at the 2016 Davis Cup as a player-captain, where he and partner John Peers lost to the Bryan brothers in a five-setter.[115]\n\nHe competed in the 2018 Davis Cup World Group play-offs, again as a player-captain in doubles with Peers. They won the rubber against the Austrian duo Oliver Marach and Jürgen Melzer in four sets.\n\nHewitt is the sole holder of several Australian Davis Cup records, which include most wins, most singles wins, most ties played and most years played.[116] His Davis Cup career has included wins over players who were top ten at the time, which include Todd Martin, Marat Safin, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Roger Federer, Gustavo Kuerten, Sébastien Grosjean and Juan Carlos Ferrero.\n\nHewitt made his World Team Cup debut for Australia in 2000 at the age of 19. He recorded two singles victories over Albert Costa and Marcelo Ríos but fell to Yevgeny Kafelnikov in his last group stage match. Hewitt returned to the World Team Cup in 2001 and led Australia to the title by recording singles wins over Àlex Corretja, Magnus Norman, Tommy Haas in the group stages. In the final Hewitt defeated No. 2 Marat Safin.\n\nHewitt made his third appearance at the tournament in 2003 where he entered as the No. 1 singles player and went undefeated in his singles matches by recording wins over Jiří Novák, James Blake and Carlos Moyá but it was not enough to send Australia through to the final.[117]\n\nFresh from their 2003 Davis Cup victory, Hewitt and Mark Philippoussis entered the 2004 World Team Cup with high hopes. In the group stages Hewitt recorded victories over Robby Ginepri and Martin Verkerk but fell to Gastón Gaudio in his last group singles match. Despite the loss, Australia still advanced to the final where Hewitt would lose to Fernando González and Australia would lose the final 2–1.[118]\n\nAfter a six-year hiatus Hewitt returned to compete in the 2010 World Team Cup and won his first match against John Isner but fell to Nicolás Almagro in his last match.\n\nA 19-year-old Hewitt entered his first Olympics in 2000 and was given the fourth seeding in the draw. Hewitt was considered a strong favourite for a medal given his victory at the Sydney International earlier in the year but despite competing in his home nation Hewitt went out in the first round to Max Mirnyi 6–3 6–3.[119] Hewitt elected not to compete in the 2004 Athens Olympic Games,[120] deciding instead to focus on the 2004 US Open which would result in a runner-up showing.[121] He would return for his second Olympic Games in Beijing for both the singles and doubles competitions. A first round 7–5 7–6 victory over Jonas Björkman would set up a second round clash with the number 2 seed Rafael Nadal. Nadal eliminated Hewitt in the second round 6–1 6–2 and would go on to win the singles gold medal.[122] Pairing up with Chris Guccione in the doubles, the team would record victories over Agustín Calleri/Juan Mónaco[123] and Rafael Nadal/Tommy Robredo before falling to the Bryan brothers in the quarterfinals.[124]\n\nHewitt competed in his third Olympics in London 2012 where he entered the men's singles event and defeated Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky in the first round. He was the only Australian in any tennis event to progress past the first round. In the second round Hewitt took out 13th seeded Croatian Marin Čilić. In the third round Hewitt stunned the tennis world when he won the first set against the number 2 ranked Novak Djokovic, he would end up falling in three sets.[76] He also sent an application to the International Olympic Committee to enter the men's doubles competition with Chris Guccione but the application was rejected.[125] Following his men's doubles rejection, Hewitt decided to apply for a spot in the mixed doubles competition with Sam Stosur. The pair were granted entry and defeated Polish pair Marcin Matkowski and Agnieszka Radwańska in the first round. In the quarterfinals, Hewitt/Stosur faced British pair Andy Murray and Laura Robson, they would lose the encounter.[126]\n\nHewitt's coaches in his time on the ATP Tour:\n\nPeter Smith (January 1997 – December 1998)\n\nDarren Cahill (December 1998 – December 2001)\n\nJason Stoltenberg (December 2001 – June 2003)\n\nRoger Rasheed (June 2003 – January 2007)\n\nScott Draper (January 2007)\n\nTony Roche (July 2007 – August 2009)\n\nNathan Healey (August 2009 – August 2010)\n\nBrett Smith (August 2010 – November 2010)\n\nTony Roche (November 2010 – January 2016)[127]\n\nPeter Luczak (January 2013 – January 2016)\n\nHewitt and Roger Federer played each other on 27 occasions. Early in their careers, Hewitt dominated Federer, winning seven of their first nine meetings, including a victory from two sets down in the 2003 Davis Cup semi-final, which allowed Australia to defeat Switzerland. However, from 2004 onward, Federer dominated the rivalry, winning 16 of the last 18 meetings to finish with an 18–9 overall head-to-head record.[128] This is Hewitt's longest rivalry as these two first played each other as juniors in 1996. They met in one Grand Slam final, the 2004 US Open final, where Federer won his first US Open title in a lopsided encounter in which Federer won the first and third sets 6–0 and the second set on a tiebreak. Federer met Hewitt at six of the Grand Slam tournaments in which he lifted the trophy, including all five of his triumphs between 2004 and 2005. Their last meeting was at the 2014 Brisbane International, where Hewitt triumphed over Federer in three sets, for his first title since 2010, when he also beat Federer to the Halle title.\n\nHewitt and Federer teamed up in the men's doubles at Wimbledon in 1999. They got to the third round before losing to Jonas Björkman and Pat Rafter.[129]\n\nHewitt's second longest rivalry was against American Andy Roddick, in which the two played on 14 occasions. Early on, Hewitt dominated the rivalry, with six wins from their first seven meetings. One of those wins included a five-set victory at the 2001 US Open, the tournament in which Hewitt captured his first Singles Grand Slam title. In later years, Roddick began to dominate Hewitt, with the rivalry finishing at 7 wins each.\n\nA rivalry and feud[130] between Hewitt and Argentinian tennis players began at the 2002 Wimbledon final where Hewitt defeated Argentina's David Nalbandian in straight sets.[131][132] The rivalry would hit boiling point in 2005 over a series of matches spread between the 2005 Australian Open and the 2005 Davis Cup Quarterfinals between Australia and Argentina.[132] In the third round of 2005 Australian Open Hewitt faced Argentinian Juan Ignacio Chela in which Hewitt fired up Chela with his over-zealous celebrations for Chela's unforced errors, causing the Argentinian to spit at Hewitt during a change of ends. Hewitt would then face David Nalbandian in the quarterfinals on Australia Day with Hewitt coming out victorious 10–8 in the fifth set. Later in 2005 Hewitt would face Guillermo Coria in the Davis Cup quarterfinals, where their rivalry would flare up. It did, however, die down the following year in the 2006 Davis Cup semi-finals, where Argentina came out victorious 5–0 over Hewitt and the Australians.\n\nHewitt is a defensive counterpuncher. He typically likes to stay back towards the baseline during a rally and will usually approach the net only to catch a short reply or drop shot from his opponent. Hewitt's lack of penetration in his groundstrokes, most notably in his forehand, a typically dominant shot for most male players, forces him to rely on placement rather than simply \"dominating\" the point.[134] At the 2004 Cincinnati Masters Final, commentator MaliVai Washington said that Hewitt was even more difficult to \"ace\" than Agassi because he gets more returns in play. Hewitt's tactics typically involve putting difficult service returns in play, consistently chasing down attempted winning shots from his opponent, and keeping the ball deep until he feels he can hit a winner.\n\nAlthough he is known primarily as a baseliner, Hewitt is a skilled volleyer and is known for having one of the best overhead smashes in the game. His signature shot, however, is the offensive topspin lob, a shot that he executes efficiently off both wings when his opponent approaches the net. US Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe, Jim Courier and Tim Henman have all described Hewitt's lob as being the best in the world (although Henman has since declared Andy Murray to have succeeded him).[135] In Andre Agassi's book \"Open\", Hewitt is described as one of the best shot selectors in the history of Men's Tennis.[136]\n\n2001 – ATP Player of the Year\n\n2001 – Most Popular South Australian\n\n2002 – ATP Player of the Year\n\n2002 – Australia's Male Athlete\n\n2002 – ESPY Best Male Tennis Player\n\n2003 – Young Australian of the Year\n\n2003 – Vogue Australia Sportsman of the Year\n\n2003 – Most Popular South Australian\n\n2011 – Newcombe Medal.

Hewitt has used Yonex racquets as early as 2000, having used the Yonex Super RD Tour 95.[140] Yonex provides Hewitt's racquets, shoes and accessories.[141] Hewitt's Yonex shoes (SHT-306) are inscribed with his nickname \"Rusty\" along with an image of an Australian flag. As of 7 August 2007, his first appearance with a new racquet at the Montreal Masters, Hewitt used to use the Yonex RQiS 1 Tour. He used to use the Yonex RDS tour 90 Model, but switched to the Yonex RDiS 100 mid in 2009. In 2011, he switched to Yonex VCORE 95 D, using a grip size of 4 3/8 (L3). Since mid-2011, he began alternating between Yonex, Nike, Adidas, Asics and Fila shoes.\n\nHewitt is a keen supporter of Australian rules football, having played the game earlier in his career, and is currently the joint No. 1 ticket holder for the Adelaide Crows, alongside MP Kate Ellis.[142] He had once had a close friendship with Crows star Andrew McLeod, but this broke down amid much public controversy in 2005.[143] Hewitt had produced a DVD titled Lleyton Hewitt: The Other Side which precipitated the falling out between him and McLeod over filming of certain Aboriginal sites.\n\nHewitt and Belgian tennis player Kim Clijsters started a relationship in January 2000, during the Australian Open. The two announced their engagement just before Christmas 2003, but separated in October 2004, cancelling a planned February 2005 wedding.[144]\n\nOn 30 January 2005, shortly after losing the 2005 Australian Open final to Marat Safin, Hewitt proposed to Australian actress Bec Cartwright after they had been dating for six weeks. They married on 21 July 2005 at the Sydney Opera House and they have three children together.[145][146][147]\n\nIn late 2008, to extend his tennis career and reduce the amount of tax he would otherwise have had to pay, Hewitt relocated his family for the European and North American season to their home in the Old Fort Bay estate, in Nassau, Bahamas.[148]\n\nHewitt has a nickname, \"Rusty\", which was given to him by Darren Cahill who at the time thought Hewitt resembled the character Rusty, from the National Lampoon film series.[149] Hewitt has also been given the nickname 'Rocky' by fans, which originated from his shouts of \"C'mon Balboa\", in reference to the character Rocky Balboa from the Sylvester Stallone film Rocky. Hewitt has also been compared to the character.[150]\n\nIn April 2021, his twelve-year-old son, Cruz Hewitt, won the Australian junior tennis clay-court title in Canberra.[151] In January 2024, Hewitt Jr. made his Major debut in the junior tournament of the 2024 Australian Open.[152]\n\nIn December 2021, Hewitt sold their family home in Toorak (Victoria), and purchased a new house in Burleigh Heads (Queensland) where he and his family now live.[153]\n\nHewitt has been involved in several public controversies. He was involved in a racism dispute while playing James Blake at the 2001 US Open. After being foot-faulted twice by a black linesman on crucial points in the third set, Hewitt was accused of dragging race into the situation by suggesting the similarity in skin colour of Blake and the official was playing a part in the decision to penalise him.[154]\n\nAt the 2001 French Open Hewitt twice called the Chair Umpire and net judge \"spastics\" and was subsequently forced to apologise following a public backlash.[155][156]\n\nHewitt's constant \"c'mons\" when he won a point or his opponents made an error have been remarked upon as poor sportsmanship by opponents and media commentators.[157][158][159][160] Notably this behaviour particularly riled his 2005 Australian Open second-round opponent James Blake.[156]\n\nMain article: Lleyton Hewitt career statistics\n\nKey W F SF QF #R RR Q# DNQ A NH\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\n\nTournament 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 SR W–L Win% Grand Slam tournaments Australian Open 1R 1R 2R 4R 3R 1R 4R 4R F 2R 3R 4R 1R 4R 1R 4R 1R 1R 2R 2R 0 / 20 32–20 62% French Open A Q1 1R 4R QF 4R 3R QF A 4R 4R 3R 3R 3R A 1R 1R 1R A A 0 / 14 28–14 67% Wimbledon A Q1 3R 1R 4R W 1R QF SF QF 4R 4R QF 4R 2R 1R 2R 2R 1R A 1 / 17 41–16 72% US Open A Q2 3R SF W SF QF F SF QF 2R A 3R 1R A 3R 4R 1R 2R A 1 / 15 47–14 77% Win–loss 0–1 0–1 5–4 11–4 16–3 15–3 9–4 17–4 16–3 12–4 9–4 8–3 8–4 8–4 1–2 5–4 4–4 1–4 2–3 1–1 2 / 66 148–64 70% Year-end championship ATP Finals Did not qualify RR W W DNQ F A Did not qualify 2 / 4 13–5 72%\n\nResult Year Championship Surface Opponent Score Win 2001 US Open Hard Pete Sampras 7–6(7–4), 6–1, 6–1 Win 2002 Wimbledon Grass David Nalbandian 6–1, 6–3, 6–2 Loss 2004 US Open Hard Roger Federer 0–6, 6–7(3–7), 0–6 Loss 2005 Australian Open Hard Marat Safin 6–1, 3–6, 4–6, 4–6\n\nResult Year Championship Surface Partner Opponents Score Win 2000 US Open Hard Max Mirnyi Ellis Ferreira\n\nRick Leach 6–4, 5–7, 7–6(7–5)\n\nResult Year Championship Surface Partner Opponents Score Loss 2000 Wimbledon Grass Kim Clijsters Kimberly Po\n\nDonald Johnson 4–6, 6–7(3–7)\n\nResult Year Championship Surface Opponent Score Win 2001 Sydney Hard (i) Sébastien Grosjean 6–3, 6–3, 6–4 Win 2002 Shanghai Hard (i) Juan Carlos Ferrero 7–5, 7–5, 2–6, 2–6, 6–4 Loss 2004 Houston Hard Roger Federer 3–6, 2–6\n\nResult Year Tournament Surface Opponent Score Loss 2000 Stuttgart, Germany Hard (i) Wayne Ferreira 6–7(6–8), 6–3, 7–6(7–5), 6–7(2–7), 2–6 Win 2002 Indian Wells, US Hard Tim Henman 6–1, 6–2 Loss 2002 Cincinnati, US Hard Carlos Moyá 5–7, 6–7(5–7) Loss 2002 Paris, France Carpet (i) Marat Safin 6–7(4–7), 0–6, 4–6 Win 2003 Indian Wells, US (2) Hard Gustavo Kuerten 6–1, 6–1 Loss 2004 Cincinnati, US Hard Andre Agassi 3–6, 6–3, 2–6 Loss 2005 Indian Wells, US Hard Roger Federer 2–6, 4–6, 4–6\n\nEvent Since Record accomplished Player matched Grand Slam 1877 Youngest qualifier at the Australian Open (15 years, 11 months old), in 1997.[161] Stands alone 1877 Most consecutive appearances at the Australian Open (20; 1997-2016) Stands alone 1877 Youngest male doubles champion (19 years, 6 months old), at the 2000 US Open.[161] Stands alone ATP Tour 1970 Lowest-ranked title winner (550), at the 1998 Adelaide International.[161] Stands alone\n\nAustralia portal\n\nSouth Australia portal\n\nNew South Wales portal\n\nCaribbean portal\n\nTennis portal\n\nLleyton Hewitt career statistics\n\nWimbledon gentleman's singles champions\n\nUS Open men's singles champions\n\nList of Grand Slam men's singles champions"
