The family relocated to his mother's hometown of Alicante when he was five.\n\nIt was there he met career-long coach Adolfo Gutierrez, to whom he attributes the evolution of his attacking game, when de Minaur was just eight.\n\n\"He took me in as a young kid to the point where my family would obviously struggle to pay him at times. He took me in. He would do countless hours with me,\" he said.\n\nDe Minaur returned to Sydney when he was 13, repeatedly stating he always felt a strong connection to Australia and was committed to \"[bleed] green and gold\".\n\nDe Minaur has credited both his coach Adolfo Gutierrez (left) and mentor Lleyton Hewitt (right) for the development of his game.

Source: Getty / Victoria Jones\n\nAlex de Minaur has been dating fellow tennis player Katie Boulter, ranked no. 54, since 2020 and have been spotted supporting each other courtside since.\n\nThe tennis power couple met while staying at the same South Yarra hotel during the Australian Open before de Minaur plucked up the courage to ask the 27-year-old for a coffee date.\n\nBoulter, Britain's women's number one, was defeated in the second round of this year's Open by China's Zheng Qinwen.\n\nWhat's the story behind Alex de Minaur's tattoo?\n\nDe Minaur sports a \"109\" tattoo on his chest, just above his heart, to honour his Davis Cup team debut as the 109th player to represent Australia.\n\nHe has previously revealed his pride to be on team Australia, captained by Hewitt, and said he will not be returning to the tattoo parlour for more ink.\n\nAlthough, if he becomes the first man to win the Australian Open since Mark Edmonson in 1976, perhaps de Minaur might make an exception.\n\nWhen is Alex de Minaur playing next?\n\nDe Minaur will face off against Russian player Andrey Rublev on Sunday 21 January. The match will begin at 7pm AEDT at Rod Laver Arena.\n\n- with additional reporting from AAP."
