        "text": "Intensity… focus… passion… all are words that have become synonymous with the name of Lleyton Hewitt. Having captured his first ATP tournament victory at the age of 16 in his hometown of Adelaide in 1998, his rise has been meteoric…\n\nat just 20 years old, he became the youngest player ever to ascend the ATP rankings and become the world’s No. 1 player. This he accomplished in dramatic fashion at the 2001 Masters Cup tournament featuring the top eight players, which he won, conceding just one set.\n\nHis patriotism is renowned… already possessing one of the finest win-loss records in Davis Cup history, even when he is not competing in his beloved Davis Cup there is always a sense in watching him that he feels as if he is playing for Australia as much as for himself. His never-say-die enthusiasm and the ability to convert on-court pressure into adrenaline have created epic centre court encounters on all surfaces, all over the world. This attitude combined with huge tennis ability and youth have led many people to anticipate a period of immense success in men’s tennis for many years to come.\n\nThe bold design captures the raw excitement of the new king of world tennis and his phenomenal rise to the top. In the signature photograph taken during the season-ending Masters Cup tournament in Sydney, Lleyton Hewitt is a study in concentration as he smashes a forehand winner. This is the tournament where he became World Number One. It also features superb action photography from the Masters and US Open victories. Also included is a written tribute.\n\nEach Lleyton Hewitt “World Number One” Print features;\n\nPersonally signed by Lleyton Hewitt\n\nLimited edition AP of 500\n\nAccompanied by a Certificate of Authenticity\n\nApproximate frame dimensions of 800 x 600mm\n\nPlease Note.
