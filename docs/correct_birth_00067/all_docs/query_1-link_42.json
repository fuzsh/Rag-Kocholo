        "text": "Australian Lleyton Hewitt is a former professional tennis player renowned for his tenacity, speed, and exceptional competitiveness on the court. Hewitt's early interest in sports saw him initially pursuing Australian rules football, but he eventually shifted his focus to tennis, turning professional in 1998. His breakthrough came in 2001 when he won the US Open, defeating Pete Sampras in the final. This victory catapulted him to the top of the tennis world, and at just 20 years old, he became the youngest male player ever to be ranked No. 1 in the world.\n\nHewitt's career is highlighted by his remarkable achievements in Grand Slam tournaments and his sustained presence among the world's elite players. In 2002, he secured his second Grand Slam title by winning Wimbledon, defeating David Nalbandian in the final. That same year, he also won the Tennis Masters Cup, solidifying his status as the world's top player. Known for his relentless baseline play and incredible counter-punching ability, Hewitt's game was characterized by his strategic acumen, remarkable agility, and an indomitable fighting spirit. His on-court demeanor, including his famous \"C'mon!\" celebrations, made him a fan favorite and a formidable opponent.\n\nOver his career, he accumulated 30 ATP singles titles and was known for his ability to perform well on various surfaces, showcasing his versatility and adaptability. Despite facing numerous injuries that hampered his career in later years, Hewitt's determination and love for the game kept him competing at a high level until his retirement in 2016. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame class of 2021.\n\nHewitt's career also includes significant contributions to Australia's Davis Cup efforts. He played a crucial role in leading his country to victory in 1999 and 2003. Following retirement, Hewitt took on the position of Australia's Davis Cup captain, guiding and inspiring the next generation of Australian tennis players."
