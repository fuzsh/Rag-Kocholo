        "text": "Tennis Player\n\nPlace Of Birth:\n\nAdelaide, Australia\n\nBest Known As:\n\n2001 U.S. Open champ\n\nLleyton Hewitt turned pro in 1998 and won his first tournament the same year. His long blonde hair and brash style reminded many of the young Andre Agassi, and Hewitt became a favorite heartthrob of teen tennis fans. He first played for Australia's Davis Cup team in 1999, and competed at Sydney in the 2000 Summer Olympics. Hewitt beat Pete Sampras in the finals of the 2001 U.S. Open to claim his first Grand Slam singles championship. The next year he won the Wimbledon men's singles title with a straight-sets win over David Nalbandian. In 2005 Hewitt reached the finals of the Australian Open, and the semifinals at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, but he has not returned to the finals of a Grand Slam tournament since. Hewitt won the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship in Houston in April of 2009, bagging his first tour win since 2007.\n\nExtra Credit\n\nHewitt began dating fellow tennis pro Kim Clijsters after they met at the 2000 Australian Open; the couple became engaged in December 2003 but split in 2004. Hewitt married Australian soap opera star Bec Cartwright in July 2005. Their daughter, Mia Rebecca Hewitt, was born on 29 November 2005. A son, Cruz Lleyton Hewitt, was born on 11 December 2008."
