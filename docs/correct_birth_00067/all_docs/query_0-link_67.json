        "text": "Cruz Hewitt’s summer of tennis has reached a new high, with the 15-year-old set to make his debut in the Australian Open boys’ singles tournament.\n\nThe son of Lleyton has already enjoyed a special month shadowing his father at the United Cup and being invited to train alongside US Open champion Dominic Thiem and Australia’s top-10 star Alex de Minaur.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Cruz Hewitt trains with Alex de Minaur at the Australian Open.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nAnd he will soon get the chance to make a name for himself in top singles competition at Melbourne Park for the first time.\n\nTennis Australia on Monday announced Cruz had been awarded a wildcard into the junior championship beginning on January 20.\n\nIt will be Cruz’s first appearance in the main draw of a grand slam boys’ tournament and comes 28 years after Lleyton, then a month shy of turning 15, reached the second round of the same event.\n\nCruz is ranked 199th in juniors and 14th among boys born in 2008.\n\nRemarkably, he is far from the youngest Australian to receive a wildcard into the junior slam.\n\nKoharu Nishikawa and Renee Alame, both 14, have been entered into the girls’ singles alongside Kimiko Cooper, Giselle Guillen and Tahlia Kokkinis (all 15).\n\nCruz will be joined in the boys’ draw by Hugh Winter (17), Ty Host, Jerome Estephan and Rohan Hazratwala (all 16) and the 15-year-old Daniel Jovanovski.\n\nCruz spent the final months of 2023 moving between the junior and men’s ITF circuits, winning three titles on the former.\n\nHe returned to the junior tour in country Victoria this week and played 17-year-old Kaylan Bigun, ninth in the junior world rankings, in the first round.\n\nCruz lost the first set without winning a game but bounced back to take the second in a tiebreak, and progressed when his American opponent retired with the young Aussie leading 4-3 in the final set.\n\nCruz fell in the second round to another 17-year-old opponent, Kazakhstan’s 61st-ranked Danial Rakhmatullayev, in straight sets.\n\nThe Australian is yet to qualify for a main draw of an ITF men’s tournament, having fallen at the final hurdle twice.\n\nHis hopes of making a leap received a boost last week when he spent time on the practice court with Thiem one day and de Minaur the next.\n\nLleyton, Australia’s Davis Cup captain, was on hand to help both through the session.\n\nA much younger Cruz had a session with Jannik Sinner before the 2020 Australian Open when the Italian star was an 18-year-old ranked just inside the world’s top 100.\n\nLleyton’s debut in the 1996 junior championship kicked off two decades of appearances in Melbourne.\n\nThe then 15-year-old famously received a wildcard into men’s qualifying in 1997 and upstaged former world No.80 Mark Petchey to reach the main draw.\n\nThe Australian was beaten by two-time French Open champion Sergi Bruguera in the first round."
