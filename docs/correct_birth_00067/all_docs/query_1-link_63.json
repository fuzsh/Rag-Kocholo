        "text": "Bec Hewitt was born in Sydney in 1983, with a very healthy amount of self-confidence. After taking up singing and dancing at the age of three it was suggested that she join a talent agency.\n\nWith her mum by her side, Bec attended her first audition and was immediately signed on. Over the next few years she appeared in more than 50 television commercials, modelled in advertising catalogues and worked as an extra on shows such as Police Rescue, Water Rats and Heartbreak High. During this time she also attended the Australian College of Entertainment to further develop her skills in the performing arts.\n\nAt the age of fifteen, Bec landed the role of Hayley Smith on Home and Away, which was a dream come true. Just one year later she was nominated for Best New Talent at the TV Week Logie Awards, and became one of Australia’s most-loved personalities. In 2002 she was signed by Warner Music and released three singles, following up the next year with a self-titled album, Bec Cartwright.\n\nIn 2004 Bec won the first Australian series of Dancing with the Stars. It was at around this time that she began dating long-time friend and Australian Tennis Star, Lleyton Hewitt – a short time later they were engaged.\n\nIn May 2005 Bec won the TV Week Silver Logie for Most Popular Actress and that year, she and Lleyton celebrated their wedding at Sydney’s famous Opera House. Soon after, Bec ended her seven-year career on Home and Away and gave birth to her first daughter, Mia Rebecca, in November.\n\nNow playing the role of wife and mum at their Palm Beach mansion, Bec still finds the time for special media engagements and regularly travels to watch Lleyton playing tennis."
