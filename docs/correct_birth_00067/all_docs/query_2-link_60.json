My wife was born in 1981, too, and I think she’s good.\n\nBut the three most famous people in Australia I can think of who were born in 1981 are three of my least favourite people in the world –\n\nBritney Spears and Paris Hilton – the trashy, raunchy twins epitomising everything that’s wrong with celebrity culture, with being famous for being famous.\n\nLleyton Hewitt – a tennis brat whose temper tantrums and arrogance are embarrassing.\n\nNatalie Portman, nearly as famous, is a better ambassador for 1981 – slightly.\n\nWho are the most famous people born in your year?"
