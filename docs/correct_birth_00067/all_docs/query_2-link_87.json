        "text": "A short and skinny kid with straggly hair spilling out of a backward-facing baseball cap, Hewitt looked more like an unkempt ball-boy than a promising junior wading into a tour event.\n\nSome two hours later, a shell-shocked Agassi exited after a stinging 7-6 7-6 defeat in the Adelaide International semi-final, the world number one run ragged by a schoolboy with fire in his eyes and legs that simply refused to quit.\n\n\"I didn't give him enough respect. I think I was convinced he was going to go away,\" Agassi remarked at the time, running a rueful hand over his shaven head.\n\nAustralian Open\n\nAustralian Open to feature shot clocks\n\n21/11/2017 at 19:09\n\nLleyton Hewitt of Australia reacts during his match against Robin Soderling of Sweden at the Wimbledon\n\nImage credit: Reuters\n\nOn Thursday, 18 years on from that watershed moment, the twice grand slam champion took a final bow in his record 20th and final appearance at his home grand slam, signing off with a 6-2 6-4 6-4 defeat to eighth-seeded Spaniard David Ferrer.\n\nThe loss under the Rod Laver Arena lights was emphatic but also showcased some classic Hewitt, as he scrambled for every ball, cursed a line judge and launched an angry tirade at the chair umpire before finally admitting defeat.\n\n\"\"I feel fortunate to finish here,\" he said courtside, surveying Rod Laver Arena for the last time.\n\nHe will not stray far from the court. He will now captain Australia's Davis Cup team, having carried it on his shoulders for many of the 17 years since his 1999 debut.\n\nBorn into a family of professional Australian Rules football players, Hewitt also fancied a career in the rugged indigenous sport which prizes courage and toughness above all qualities.\n\nA young Hewitt cared little for reputations, flooring a procession of the tour's hallowed names to soar up the rankings.\n\nHe routed Pete Sampras in straight sets to win the 2001 U.S. Open final and secure his maiden grand slam title.\n\nLleyton Hewitt of Australia holds the trophy after winning the men's final at the U.S. Open Tennis Championship in New York September 9, 2001.

Hewitt won 6-1 6-3 6-2.\n\nImage credit: Eurosport\n\nHis trademark scream of 'C'mon!' annoyed Argentine player Juan Ignacio Chela so much that he earned a fine for spitting near Hewitt during their match at the 2005 Australian Open.\n\nThe Australian's runner-up finish in his home tournament was his last trip to a grand slam final, with injuries taking their toll in subsequent years and a new generation of power hitters, not to mention the dominant Roger Federer, rising to the fore.\n\nHis famed court-speed ebbed away but the competitive fires raged on, and he ploughed on through another 10 seasons, determined to draw every last ounce from a body pock-marked from pain-killing injections.\n\nFor a street-fighter extraordinaire, there was no other way."
