        "text": "It was a bit like a five setter, but tennis star Lleyton Hewitt has finally sold his long-vacated $3 million West Lakes house in Adelaide.\n\nThe home in Adelaide’s west had been listed through Harcourts Aqua agent Steve von der Borch.\n\nHis hometown Adelaide property was first listed in November 2008 with a $2.95 million to $3.24 million price range.\n\nIt has been sold for about $2.5 million, Fairfax Media reported. The 29 Martin Court property with its 801 square metre block was bought in 2003 for $3.2 million.\n\nIt has been vacant for most of the time with Hewitt and his wife Bec having no plans to return to the luxury home. The poolside mural featured on Property Observer' s recent roundup of homes with murals currently on the market.\n\nRP Data puts the West Lakes median house price at about $610,000.\n\nThe home was delisted last October when Hewitt’s parents Glynn and Cherilyn Hewitt gave permission to upload interior photos of the 29 Martin Court property as part of the marketing.\n\n“We’re not selling a secret anymore and we can make a bit of noise about it, so we’ve put it up online and will put it up on an international website and very likely it will form part of what we’ll take to China for a property exhibition in Shanghai in December,” Mr von der Borch told the local paper.\n\nThe family live in Nassau, in the Bahamas, with their three children — Ava, Cruz and Mia. They retain homes at Kenthurst and Palm Beach in Sydney. Their St Kilda Road, Melbourne apartment on the 19th floor of Yve is quietly for sale.\n\nThe home with 700 square metres of living space has five bedrooms, four bathrooms, an indoor lap pool, spa, and sauna area with mural, rock wall water feature."
