        "text": "Australia’s pro tennis crew is usually a pretty collegial crowd, filled with players, coaches and trainers sharing friendly hits, weight-room sessions and steaks and beers on the long and seemingly endless road that is their season.\n\nBut just days before this year’s Australian Open, their grand annual celebration known as the “Happy Slam”, a very public row broke out when the country’s top-ranked female player, Arina Rodionova, lashed out at the Tennis Australia hierarchy for not giving her a wild-card entry into the tournament. They preferred to give the experience (and the roughly $80,000 payday) to rising players or those coming back from injuries rather than a 34-year-old ranked 104th in the world, the apex of her career, so far.\n\nSetting aside the debate over whether Rodionova deserved a slot, the row drew attention to some uncomfortable questions for the tennis leadership of what historically has been one of the great tennis nations.\n\nHow is there not an Australian woman ranked higher than 104? And what about the men? How is it that an Australian man has not won his country’s home slam since 1976, before many of the best men started showing up regularly?\n\nAs the second week of this year’s Australian Open begins Sunday, just one Aussie remains. Alex de Minaur, the lightning-quick 24-year-old who recently cracked the top 10 for the first time, is carrying the tennis weight of his nation once more. De Minaur plays Andrey Rublev of Russia, the fifth seed, in the fourth round tomorrow (Sunday).\n\nDe Minaur — the scrappiest of players who has produced a new level of aggression and urgency under the guidance of his mentor and Davis Cup captain, the former world No 1 Lleyton Hewitt — has embraced the lonely role that, at times, has crippled the minds of past Aussie standard-bearers.\n\n“Ever since the first time I stepped out here on court, it’s always been a privilege because I get to play in front of my home crowd, right?” de Minaur said ahead of the tournament. “For me, there’s no better feeling. I’m lucky enough that I know as soon as I step out there on court, everyone in the crowd has got my back, and I’m going to give 150 per cent.”\n\nDe Minaur doesn’t have much contemporary company to discuss the situation with. He is one of just three Aussie men to make the Australian Open fourth round since 2013. Only Nick Kyrgios has won and made the quarters. In six of those years, all the Aussie men were gone by the end of the first week.\n\nOn the women’s side, Ashleigh Barty was a mainstay of the second week here from 2019-22, and won it in 2022, but then she retired six weeks later as the world No 1 at just 25 years old. Like De Minaur, Barty had limited company. Casey Dellacqua and Daria Saville, who began representing her tennis-playing husband Luke’s country rather than her native Russia in 2015, are the only other Aussie women to make the second week of the tournament since 2013.\n\nIn fairness, the Aussies have suffered some bad breaks in the past two years. Barty retired. Saville and Ajla Tomljanovic — born in Croatia, raised largely in Florida; Australian by choice beginning in 2014, in part to gain some support from Tennis Australia — are climbing their way back from injuries. Kyrgios, widely recognized among his peers as the planet’s purest talent, has been injured since making the Wimbledon final in 2022 and has an ambivalent relationship with the sport anyway.\n\nStill, the absence of more top Aussies is a shame, because while all hometown fans pull for their fellow citizens, there is nothing quite like the Aussie crowd when an Aussie is on the court. It’s part of what makes the Australian Open unique.\n\nAll those “Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!” chants. Lots of beer. The kind of head-splitting noise — especially in the concrete box known as John Cain Arena, in the hot sun of late afternoon — that can rattle the nerves of opponents and raise the level of a middling Aussie like few other environments.\n\nSometimes it can backfire. Taylah Preston, an 18-year-old from Perth who got into the main draw with a wild card, wasn’t quite ready for the wall of sound that met her on the 1573 Arena.\n\n“That was lots,” said Preston, who lost 6-2, 6-2 to Elina Svitolina. “I couldn’t believe there were so many people there that early.”\n\nAmong the countries lucky enough to host Grand Slams — and enjoy the promotion and hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenues to seed tennis development — the Aussies are not alone in their frustration. The United States, which along with Australia ruled professional tennis for much of the 20th century, has struggled to produce male champions for 20 years.\n\nAmerican women have had plenty of success, but in 2022, Frances Tiafoe became the first American man to make the U.S. Open singles semi-finals since 2006. The French haven’t won a French Open singles title since 2000 (Mary Pierce) and are four decades removed from Yannick Noah’s epic men’s title. Britain got two Wimbledon titles from Andy Murray, and Emma Raducanu’s storied 2021 run at the U.S. Open. Otherwise, it’s been pretty rough since the end of the Second World War.\n\nThere is one big macro explanation for these struggles: a lot more countries play tennis seriously now than 50 years ago. Tennis was barely a thing in central and eastern Europe and nearly all of Asia until recently. Following the fall of the Iron Curtain, the sport exploded there, and particularly in the former communist countries in Eastern Europe, where tennis had long been scorned as a pursuit of the bourgeoisie. Russia, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine have all become tennis hotbeds, especially for women.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nNick Kyrgios exclusive interview: 'I feel more respected in the U.S. than Australia'\n\nAlso, the U.S, Britain and France have more explaining to do than Australia, whose population is less than one-tenth of the population of the U.S. and less than half of Britain and France. Complicating matters, it’s geographically the sixth largest country in the world. Perth, with 2.24million people, is the most isolated big city in the world.\n\n“You need to get all the best players together, competing with and pushing with each other and that can be hard here,” said Rennae Stubbs, the television commentator and six-time Grand Slam doubles champion, who grew up in Sydney. “It’s not Europe, where you can drive two hours and be in another country and be playing against great talent all the time.”\n\nAlso, since Australia is so far from where professional tennis happens after January, being an Aussie pro means living out of a suitcase many thousands of miles from home for months at a time. There’s no flying home for a long weekend. Supporting yourself once you are off the Tennis Australia dole at 24 can be seriously expensive. De Minaur, who grew up in Sydney, lucked out. His mother is Spanish and he estimates he has spent roughly half his life training in Spain, arguably the world’s top tennis country.\n\nOne other problem: Australia is a sports-mad nation whose citizens have gotten hooked on a lot more sports than they once were.\n\n“It’s not like 30 years ago where you played Aussie rules football in the winter and then swam, played cricket or tennis in the summer,” said Todd Woodbridge, who ran player development for Tennis Australia when Kyrgios and Barty were rising juniors.” Now, according to Woodbridge, girls and boys are spending their time playing basketball, soccer, volleyball, netball and, most distressingly, Fortnite.\n\nThe two men charged with overcoming these obstacles are Paul Kilderry, the director of professional tennis for Tennis Australia, and Tim Jolley, the organization’s chief of strategy and development.\n\nThey, along with Craig Tiley, the chief executive of Tennis Australia, have pursued a hybrid development program that tries to spot promising prospects as young as 10 years old but doesn’t force children to move to the national academy in Brisbane.\n\nIf they want to stay home and work with a private coach, they can do that and Tennis Australia will provide funding and training support, plus bring them into training camps for the best kids in each birth year in each state and on tours of Europe through their teens.\n\nOnce they turn professional, they can use a national coach or hire their own, but the national federation makes a support staff — including strength-and-conditioning coaches, physiotherapists and even analytics experts — available to the Aussies during those long stretches on the road. Kilderry said that approach was in the tradition of the camaraderie that has existed among Aussie players going back to the golden era of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n“It was always like a traveling group of Aussies heading overseas,” he said. “And I think we pride ourselves as a nation on supporting each other as a playing group.”\n\nThat goes for players such as De Minaur, a mainstay of the top 20 the past two years and now a top 10 player at 24, or Chris O’Connell, who didn’t crack the top 100 until he was 28. “Philosophically, we have a really strong belief in trying to be the best version of yourself every day, and that’s just part of the Australian ethos,” Jolley said last week when there were still plenty of Aussies left in the draw.\n\nAustralia had its unicorns in Barty and Kyrgios. As it turned out, both had little appetite for the 11-month grind of pro tennis. Kyrgios said in December he plans to come back when his surgically repaired wrist heals later this year, but he is getting good reviews for his new career as a commentator for ESPN.\n\n“What you want is numbers and then hopefully one emerges,” Woodbridge said, touting the 15 Aussie men in the draw (including five wild cards), the most since 1988. “We’ve got a guy who just cracked the top 10. If we can get Kyrgios back, we’ll be in good shape.”\n\n“We’d like to have more on the women’s side,” he added. “But that’s why it’s great that we have this event: so that we can draw players.”\n\n(Top photo: Alex de Minaur; Cameron Spencer/Getty Images)"
