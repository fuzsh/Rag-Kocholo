        "text": "The beginning of the Soviet rule over western Ukraine in September 1939 marked the start of repressions against the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and its clergy. The Soviet regime viewed it as an “anti-Soviet organization” linked with the nationalist underground and governed by a foreign anti-Communist center, the Vatican. The Greek-Catholic Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytskyi as a man of vision was deeply concerned about his church’s survival under the Soviet regime and expected a crackdown on religion and arrests of priests and bishops. In a confidential letter sent to Pope Pius XII in October 1939, he asked for extraordinary faculties that would enable his priests to preach and celebrate sacraments while under Communist rule and for a swift appointment of a deputy bishop with the right of succession. The candidate he proposed was Josyf Slipyi, one of his closest friends and the rector of the Lviv Seminary and Theological Academy from 1928 to 1944 who was secretly consecrated in December 1939. Slipyi was a steadfast and upright man who, everyone believed, was best suited to lead the church through the forthcoming persecutions. The retreat of the Red Army from western Ukraine left behind thousands of dead bodies of those hastily executed in Soviet prisons, including several dozens of priests. In August 1941, after the German occupation gave the church a short respite from the Soviet atheist pressure, Metropolitan Sheptytskyi observed that the Soviets had demonstrated “the desire to suffocate and destroy Christianity, to erase the smallest traces of it.”\n\nIn mid-1944, the western Ukraine was re-occupied by the Red Army, and a new round of repressions began. On March 15, 1945, Stalin approved a secret instruction about “the measures to separate the Greek-Catholic (Uniate) Church in the USSR from the Vatican and to ensure its unification with the Russian Orthodox Church.” In April, the arrests of all of the Greek-Catholic bishops in Galicia followed. Among the arrested was Sheptytskyi’s successor Josyf Slipyi, as well as two more bishops, who were deported from Poland and arrested in 1946, and bishop Romzha from Mukachevo who was assassinated by the MGB in 1947. On March 8–10, l946, a sham synod (editor’s note: a synod is an assembly of the clergy) was organized in Lviv by the Soviet authorities and the secret police in cooperation with the “Initiative Group for the Reunion with the Russian Orthodox Church” which annulled the union with Rome and declared a “reunification” with Orthodoxy. This act was accompanied by mass arrests of the Greek-Catholic clergy and laymen. In 1949 and 1950, respectively, the same forced “reunification” befell the Greek-Catholics of the Mukachevo and Priashiv eparchies. In a letter to a friend in Rome, Metropolitan Sheptytskyi’s brother Klymentiy Sheptytskyi wrote: “So much destruction and death! It’s as if a hurricane had struck our poor Greek-Catholic Church ... In 1945, the Soviet authorities adopted against our Church the same policy that had been implemented under the Russian tsars – under Catherine II, Nicholas I, Alexander II. The goal of this policy was to dissolve the union with Rome and to subordinate the Greek-Catholics to the Moscow Patriarch…”\n\nNumerous Greek-Catholic bishops, priests, monks and nuns were tried and sentenced under the infamous article 54 of the Criminal Code of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The paragraphs invoked most often included article 54–1-a, on high treason, article 54–10, on “anti-Soviet propaganda and agitation”, and article 54–11, on participation in a counterrevolutionary organization. The sentences ranged from 8 to 25 years of prison camps. The priests’ wives or even their whole families, as well as many other “politically suspect” laymen, were deported to “special settlements” in distant regions of the Soviet Union. The geography of the GULAG was immense. The Greek-Catholic clergy and the faithful served their terms in the Mordovian ASSR (Dubrovlag), Komi ASSR (Vorkutlag, Rechlag, Intlag, Minlag), Kazakh SSR (Karlag, Steplag), Siberia (Norillag, Ozerlag), and Russia’s Far East (Berlag, Kolymlag). “Special settlements” were usually located in the Krasnoyarsk krai, Transbaikal, Khabarovsk krai, and others. However, the church was far from destroyed. Like early Christians, the Greek-Catholics lived on in the catacombs.\n\nAlthough the Soviet authorities considered the Greek-Catholic Church as liquidated, previously depriving it of all its property, the clergy continued to take care of its faithful in their “home churches.” Amid cruel persecutions, when former church and monastery buildings were used as warehouses, mental hospitals, sport and education facilities, or even restaurants, clandestine liturgies and other services were held in private buildings, pilgrimage sites, cemeteries, or forests. Sometimes closed churches were opened by the faithful without government permission, at risk of severe penalties. Liturgical vestments and utensils were often crafted by priests or the faithful themselves. A vast amount of religious literature was disseminated illegally, from hand to hand, even though it was considered a criminal offence. One of the most important goals of the “catacomb” church leaders was to educate and ordain a new generation of priests. To this end, several underground seminaries were created. Long-established monastic orders and communities continued their ministry in the underground, and several new ones emerged.\n\nJosyf Slipyj: the voice of the silenced church\n\nUGCC had to worry about the hierarchy being physically destroyed. In a military tribunal in Kyiv, three judges and two secretaries heard the case of the Greek Catholic bishops who had been detained on April 11, 1945. The trial took place in secret at night from May 29 to June 3, 1946. According to articles 54-1 and 54-11 of the Criminal Code of the Ukrainian SSR, Metropolitan Josyf Slipyi was charged with \"treason against the Motherland\" and sentenced to 8 years in a labor camp, the confiscation of his property, and a 3-year suspension of his rights. Many members of the clergy perished in prison before hearing the court's decision, and many bishops were doomed to die in the concentration camps.\n\nThe release of Metropolitan Josyf Slipyj in 1963, and his twenty years of fervent work in the Ukrainian diaspora, became the prelude to the collapse of the Soviet Communist regime and the emergence of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church from the catacombs. Josyf Slipyj became the voice of the silenced church in the free world. His activities in the West sought to establish a Ukrainian Patriarchate that would unite all the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic structures both in Ukraine and in the diaspora. To govern the Church more effectively, he began to convoke Episcopal Synods. In 1963, the Holy See granted him the title of major archbishop, and in 1965, he was named cardinal. Starting in 1975, he began to present himself Patriarch. Throughout his entire life, he remained the UGCC’s spokesperson, calling for attention towards the persecution of the UGCC clergy by the Soviet government. After being freed, Slipyi spent over 21 years in Rome, where he initiated the construction of St. Sophia Cathedral, founded the Ukrainian Catholic University and a Studite monastery near Castel Gandolfo, and launched an extensive book publishing program. The figure of the Metropolitan as confessor of the faith and GULAG prisoner became a unifying factor for the Ukrainian Greek-Catholics scattered all across the Western world. He made numerous pastoral visits to the Ukrainian communities in western Europe, the Americas, and even Australia. For the West, Patriarch Slipyj became a symbol of the Church of the Martyrs whose faithful suffered for their fidelity to the Holy See. The UGCC was led by Josyf Slipyi for 40 years. He passed away just 4 years before it received official recognition.\n\nIn Ukraine, the movement for the legalization of the Greek-Catholic Church, which reached its height in the 1980s, was an integral part of the permanent civil opposition against the totalitarian system. In 1982, the Initiative Group for the Defense of the Rights of Believers and the Church emerged under the leadership of Yosyf Terelia. In 1987, it was transformed into the Committee for the Defense of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, headed by Ivan Hel, a human rights activist and a long-time political prisoner. On Aug. 4, 1987, Bishops Pavlo Vasylyk and Ivan Semediy, along with 20 priests and 174 of the faithful, signed a letter to Pope John Paul II and Mikhail Gorbachev, declaring that the Ukrainian Сatholic Church was coming out of the underground. They stated that from now on they were going to celebrate divine services openly, and demanded the rehabilitation of their Church and the restitution of its property. In 1988-89, the clergy in cooperation with the Committee organized a number of mass public manifestations to celebrate important national and religious events, including the 1000th anniversary of the Christening of Ukraine-Rus. Open-air liturgies held near locked churches, in cemeteries, in parks or forests, vividly demonstrated that the Greek-Catholic Church, though declared illegal, was still alive.\n\nThe hunger strikes of Ukrainian Greek-Catholics on the Arbat in Moscow in May to November 1989, and the Greek-Catholic march, many thousands-strong, held in Lviv on September 17, 1989, became decisive turning points in the struggle for legalization. On Nov. 20, 1989, on the eve of President Gorbachev’s meeting with Pope John Paul II, the Council for Religious Affairs of the Ukrainian SSR issued a declaration that allowed the Greek-Catholics to establish and register their religious communities and granted them “all the rights guaranteed to the religious associations by the laws of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.” In 1990 and 1991, the Greek-Catholics managed to regain many churches that were either closed or controlled by the Orthodox Church, including the St. George Cathedral in Lviv. Seminaries were established in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Drohobych, and Ternopil. On March 30, 1991, the head of the Church, Patriarch Myroslav Ivan Lubachivsky, was finally granted the legal right to oversee the UGCC in Lviv. In 2005, the new head of the church, Lubomyr Husar, moved his residence from Lviv to Kyiv, where the Cathedral of Christ’s Resurrection was built in 2011. Thus, the Greek-Catholic Church made its return to the Central Ukrainian heartland from which it was ousted back in the 19th century due to the Russian tsarist repressions."
