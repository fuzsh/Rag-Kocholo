        "text": "Posted By: DTBrown Lecture by Fr Taft on \"Uniatism\" - 05:35 AM\n\n\"Uniatism\" is often cited as being the main reason for the current impasse in Catholic-Orthodox dialogue. A Catholic perspective was recently given in a lecture by Fr Robert Taft. The first few paragraphs are given as a sample of the lecture which can be found in its entirety at:\n\nhttp://www.utoronto.ca/stmikes/theology/taft-kelly2000.htm\n\nLecture by Fr Robert F Taft, SJ (Vice-Rector of the Pontifical Oriental Institute, Rome)\n\nAnamnesis, not Amnesia: The \"Healing of Memories\" and the Problem of \"Uniatism\"\n\ngiven 1 December 2000 at the University of St Michael's College in Toronto, Canada\n\nNo one who keeps abreast of the religious news can be unaware that ecumenical relations between the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches are in a period of crisis, worse, perhaps, than at any time since the official international ecumenical dialogue between these two communions began in the aftermath of the Second Vatican Council. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Joint Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church on July 9-19 at Mount St. Mary's College and Seminary in Emmittsburg, Maryland, is known to have ended in a stalemate or worse - some have privately branded it a complete fiasco. [1]\n\n\"Uniatism\"\n\nWhat has led to this impasse is the phenomenon known as \"Uniatism,\"[2] a pejorative neologism coined to denote a method of Church union the Orthodox see as politically rather than religiously motivated, and contrary to the \"communion ecclesiology\" of the Church of the first millennium.[3] In \"Uniatism,\" one Church is perceived as an aggressor against a \"sister Church\" with which it happens at the moment to be in schism, absorbing groups of its faithful deceptively by allowing them to retain their own liturgical and canonical traditions and a certain autonomy. This type of union, considered the result of political pressure reinforced by violence, created not unity but new divisions in an already fragmented Christendom.\n\nTo understand \"Uniatism\" and this negative view of it, one must understand the nature of the reunions of the 16th and later centuries, and of the Eastern Catholic Churches that resulted. Regardless of the intentions behind them, these reunions were not, except in the most formal theological sense, a restoration of the communion that had existed before the schism between East and West. They represented something new in the history of the Church, a departure from the past, which is why the Slavic neologism \"unija\" was invented to describe it.\n\nHad the Union of Florence in 1439 been successful, the phenomenon of \"Uniatism\" would never have emerged. For at Florence the Latin West and the Byzantine East tried to face and deal with each other directly as equals. But the Orthodox repudiation of the Union of Florence in 1484 provoked a clear though perhaps unconscious shift in tactics by the Latin Church. Disillusioned by the failure to achieve a general union, the Roman Church began to sign separate union agreements with individual groups of Orthodox, thus nibbling away at the fringes of Orthodoxy in areas under the political control of Catholic powers. For the Orthodox, this was perfidious, like signing a separate peace behind the backs of one's allies instead of working for a general peace. Rome could respond that they were simply entering into union with a local Church (which indeed the Roman Church, like any other Church, had every right to do). [4]\n\nBut phenomenologically, the Churches had in fact evolved beyond the pre-Nicene system in which one could still legtimately view the universal Church as a federation of local Churches with no intervening higher structures - as if Canada, for example, were just a collection of towns not united into separate provinces. So the Orthodox groups that entered into union with Rome were not simply restoring the former, broken unity between a local Church and the Church of Rome, even if this is what they had intended. Rather, they were separating themselves from one entity, their Orthodox Mother Church, and being absorbed into another, the Latin Catholic Church of the West. In short, they were leaving the Eastern Church and being assimilated into the Western Church. Far from restoring the broken communion between East and West, this led to new divisions.\n\nFor the Orthodox, such partial reunions remove the whole ecumenical problem from its proper context. This is a view that most ecumenists now share. In this perspective, the separation between our Churches resulted between the hierarchies of East and West over ecclesial questions like the extent and powers of the Roman See, and it is up to those two hierarchies together, and not individuals or splinter groups of bishops, to solve these problems in common. Partial reunion only divides the Orthodox Churches and is seen as deceiving the simple faithful, who follow their bishops in good faith with no understanding of the issues involved. For the Orthodox, such partial reunions are not Union but \"Unia,\" breaking ranks and entering premature and treacherous submissions to one side in a dispute without the consent of one's partners.\n\nFull text at:\n\nhttp://www.utoronto.ca/stmikes/theology/taft-kelly2000.htm\n\nPosted By: Orthodox Catholic Re: Lecture by Fr Taft on \"Uniatism\" - 02:21 PM\n\nDear Friend,\n\nGlory to Jesus Christ!\n\nThank you very much for this posting. I was going to go to the lecture, but my wife's fortieth birthday celebration \"got in the way.\"\n\nThank you, once again.\n\nAlex\n\nPosted By: Anonymous Re: Lecture by Fr Taft on \"Uniatism\" - 05:16 PM\n\nDTBrown,\n\nA sobering reminder how Catholics do not have a monopoly on sin and how sometimes those \"of the cloth\" in the highest of ranks in the Church are the slowest to admit it. I am amazed how many debacles can begin to be solved if one party would admit their sinfulness. Those alcoholics and sex-offenders in those \"Anonymous\" support groups do a better job in showing how taking responsibility for one's sins or shortcomings can begin the road to recovery by taking that First Step. They are Living Icons of how that beautiful system of forgiveness and healing works. This lecture points to how that system is only ignored due to pride and the refusal to admit cooperation with the Enemy. With all the yak about the Church either being \"local\"-oriented or \"Universal\"-oriented, it still seems to be the age-old game of \"Who gets the most churches, wins!\"\n\nBut as long as Triumphalism and Phariseeism blinds folks in their ways, then we still have a long way to go. Will we witness the Orthodox begin their Lenten Journey this year by asking forgiveness for their deeds of the past as Pope John Paul II did? Only if Jesus Christ was here to write something more in the sand .......\n\nBTW, where can I find an English copy of Peter Skarga's book \"On the Unity of the Church of God under One Pastor?\"\n\nJoe\n\nPS: We should pray for the martyrs in both camps.\n\n[This message has been edited by Joe Thur (edited 01-31-2001).]\n\nPosted By: Orthodox Catholic Re: Lecture by Fr Taft on \"Uniatism\" - 05:25 PM\n\nDear Friend,\n\nGlory to Jesus Christ!\n\nReading Fr. Taft's lecture brought to mind some sad reminders of the events of 1946.\n\nMy grandfather, John, was a Ukrainian Greek Catholic priest living near L'viv.\n\nHe was arrested in 1946 and spent some time in jail. He was tortured. In the end, he \"signed Orthodoxy\" and became a member of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nHe came to Canada in 1966 and returned to the Eastern Catholic Church, although he never seemed to get rid of the guilt he felt about \"giving in\" to the Soviets.\n\nEach year, he would get me to take him to a Priest in another parish so that he could confess this.\n\nWhen I once told him, \"Grandfather, but you already confessed that, you were forgiven and so you should forget about it.\"\n\nHe replied by saying, \"What do you know? Just take me, please!\"\n\nHe also had a beautiful pectoral Cross that a Russian bishop had given him after a Church he was building in a village where he was stationed was completed.\n\nHe never wore that Cross, it reminded him of the past and he kept it hidden away. When he served the Liturgy at home, when he was too weak to walk, he would never let me place the Cross on him when I helped him vest.\n\nJust before he died, he gave me his blessing. At his funeral, my uncles gave me a brown paper bag. \"Grandfather wanted you to have this,\" they said.\n\nIt was the Cross which I keep proudly in memory of my grandfather. It represents the suffering he and many Eastern Catholics like him endured for Christ.\n\nGod bless,\n\nAlex\n\nPosted By: Dragani Re: Lecture by Fr Taft on \"Uniatism\" - 05:30 PM\n\nWOW!\n\nWhat an amazing lecture.

Makes me want to put on my sackcloth and ashes and stand at the temple with my sisters and brothers of all the Churches praying, \"Be merciful to us sinners.\" Then go to help my brother or sister who is different from me and mine.\n\nSuch a succinct documenting of the evil that Chruch people do to eachother and to those outside the Churches! This should be distributed in all of the Churches on the same Sunday. Maybe then all of our ecclesiastical hearts would begin to respond to the call of the Spirit to conversion of life and to the practice of love for each other.\n\nPlease do not let the written expression impede the meaning.\n\nJoy!\n\nPosted By: Three Cents Re: Lecture by Fr Taft on \"Uniatism\" - 01:58 AM\n\nI feel that this piece from Toronto deserves an Orthodox reponse, in that it is very one sided and omits the overt work in the establishing the Unia.\n\nThis piece makes no mention of the Melkite Schism at all. I don't find it surprising (considering the paper's position), since no one now considers the election and enthrownment of the 16 year old Cyril Tannous (I Was A Teenage Patriarch)to be canonical. To set humor aside for a second in Christian love, even Father King (who was the Chancellor of the Melkite Greek Catholic Eparchy of Newton) said in a public forum that the true line of Antioch had to be Sylvester of Cyprus (the Orthodox candidate), because of the two, he was the only one acceptable by both Catholic and Orthodox canonical standards. I know, because I was there when Fr. King said what he did. God bless him for his honesty without guile. The damage done by the Jesuits in this situation was beyond measure. That was the end of any intercommunion as we know it.\n\nRegarding the Slavic situation, the Russicum was a means of Jesuit propaganda. I know, because Fr. Alexis Floridi SJ (Memory Eternal)was my Pastor at Our Lady of Kazan in Boston (before I became Orthodox). When I did leave for Orthodoxy, a dear friend of mine who was one of the leading Greek Catholic Theologians in the world said to me that if he were younger, he would have done the same thing. This man longed for Orthodoxy. I believe that he has long since gone to his Holy Maker, and shall remain nameless in this posting. I'll never forget his words \"Orthodox Theology does not need any defense\". Visnaja Pamyat! May the memories of both these wonderful men (who meant so much to my Byzantine development) be eternal. And regarding Father King, I had found what Our Lord and Savior had described in St. Nathaniel, A Man Without Guile.\n\nIn Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ's Service,\n\nThree Cents\n\nPosted By: DTBrown Re: Lecture by Fr Taft on \"Uniatism\" - 03:41 AM\n\nI think that the reason Fr Taft concentrates on Eastern Europe in his lecture was because that is where the impasse is right now.\n\nI was hoping that \"an Orthodox response\" would address some of the issues that Fr Taft raised instead of dealing with who was really the canonical Patriarch of Antioch in the eighteenth century. Perhaps Fr King is right on this...I'm not going to get into that here. Are there Orthodox voices that would imitate the candor that Fr King apparently had? I've read Bishop KALLISTOS voicing some concern about what happened in Ukraine and Slovakia and Romania in the 40's...but such voices sadly seem very few.\n\nI hesitate to post this because I know it will begin the \"But, you guys did ...\" and get similar retorts from others. Hey, there is enough sin to go around on all sides. I think what Fr Taft is getting at is: sure \"Uniatism\" was flawed and is not an acceptable model of reunion today between our Churches. And there were many great blunders made in the name of \"Uniatism.\" Stonewalling on what happened at the \"reunion synods\" of the 40's is not helpful in resolving the question of \"Uniatism,\" however.\n\nDave Ignatius DTBrown@aol.com\n\nPosted By: Three Cents Re: Lecture by Fr Taft on \"Uniatism\" - 11:09 AM\n\nFirst of all, to the Orthodox, the Melkite Schism is absolutely relevent to Eastern Europe. This is what the Antiochian Greek Orthodox Patriachate told the Melkites in response to the offer of dual communion both with Rome and the Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch. From the Orthodox perspective, addressing Antioch without Greece, Romania and the Slavs is totally unacceptable. We are one Church. Indeed, to the Orthodox, addressing different \"sui juris\" jurisdictions is a key to Uniatism itself. Every Orthodox Christian on Mt. Athos is a member of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. This is true regardless of whether or not they are Greeks at Esphigmenou, Russians at Sviati Panteleimon, Bulgarians at Zographou or Serbians at Chilandari. To Orthodox Catholicism, there is no breaking off of one part of the Church in isolation of the rest.\n\nRegarding the Unions in Europe, Berestia-Litovsk occurred over a period of time. The Catholics and Jesuits needed enough Bishops from the Orthodox Kievan Metropolia to proclaim a Union. This quite obviously could not be overnight. As bishops died, the Polish-Lithuanian govt (and the Jesuits) made sure that the new ones were more Catholic friendly. This was absolutely necessary to effect a Union that anyone would regard as credible. In fact, much of St. Peter Mohyla's writings on Orthodoxy (which are accepted by the Orthodox Church, despite their obvioulsy Latin terminology) show obvious Jesuit influence.\n\nRegarding the Union in Translyvania (under the Hungarians), this was combatted on the Orthodox side by Serbian Monks. When they learned that the Hierarchy had taken the Orthodox faithful in Union, they left their monastic situations to preach to the faithful. As a result, a large number of Translyvanians returned to Orthodoxy, and the movement was so widespread that the Hungarian govt couldn't stop it. Don't forget, the classic liturgical language of the Romanians is Slavonic. They were part of the Church of Greater Bulgaria (as was Transcarpathia after the Cyril and Methodian Mission).\n\nIn fact, in the Rusyn areas of the Hungarian Kingdom (as opposed to Serbian and Romanian of the same), Orthodoxy could be a capital offense. My paternal grandparents were born in Ladimorova and Hoca.\n\nI'm aware of Bishop Kallistos' writing in the Orthodox Church regarding Ukraine, Slovakia and Translyvania under Stalin and feel that what was done was despicable. Having said that, there are Transylvanian Romanians in my parish whose families were at least in part Greek Catholic. They choose to remain Orthodox, and are very happy in doing so. In Western Ukraine, many of the members of the two Orthodox Churches now negotiating with the Ecumenical Patriarch were from Greek Catholic families. I believe that Fr. Romaniuk himself was in that situation.\n\nMy point is that historical revisionism does not help us in any way deal with the pastoral issues that we now face. We don't need the rhetorical same old, same old! A paper that states that the Unions in Europe were merely the results of the Orthodox in the effected areas desiring to become Catholics without major outside political and economic influences is ludicrous, and should be seriously academically scrutinized. I know that the Russian Jesuits were trained into Russia to \"make propaganda\" (or sheep stealing) because this was my Pastor's (Memory Eternal) terminology.\n\nI am very sensitive to the pastoral issues that we now face because of the sins of BOTH SIDES in the past. We have mixed marriage families not able to communicate in each other's Church's. The elderly do not these theological differences (as the Romanian Patriarch said to the Pope \"we have Theologians\"). In North America especially, the mixed families problem is accute and will not go away (indeed, it will continue to grow). I know, I'm from a mixed family. My own Mother is Catholic.\n\nIn the Service of Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,\n\nThree Cents\n\nPosted By: Anonymous Re: Lecture by Fr Taft on \"Uniatism\" - 11:22 AM\n\nHave mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us. At a loss for any defense, we sinners offer this prayer to You, the Master: have mercy on us.\n\nBehold, O Christ God, I now stand before You in the presence of your holy angels as if I were standing before your fearful and just judgement-seat, awaiting your sentence and rendering an account of all my evil deeds. Behold, I bow my head, and lay before You my sins and my wickedness, and I confess them and reveal them : O Lord, look down upon my humble condition and forgive me all my transgressions. Behold, O Lord, my offenses exceed in number the hairs of my head. What evil have I not done? What sin have I not committed? What wickedness have I not imagined within my soul? Have I not sinned through pride, vainglory, slander, idle speech, unkind laughter, intemperance, hatred, envy, selfishness, ambition, and falsehood? Have I not stainded all my senses and defiled all my members? Have I not been a slave to Satan? O Lord, I know well that my iniquities are so deep that they have reached over my head, but I also know that the greatness of your compassion is immeasurable , and that the mercy of your great goodness is beyond words. Therefore, O most wonderful King, O most loving Lord, show forth your mercies in me a sinner. Manifest in me the might of your goodness and the power of your loving kindness and receive me who turn to You: receive me as You received the Prodigal Son, the Thief and the sinful Woman. But O Lord, in your displeasure rebuke me not: have mercy on me, for though I am weak, I am still your creature. You have established your fear in me, and yet I have done evil in your sight: against you alone I have sinned, but I beseech You,enter not into judgement against your servant. O Lord my God, I put my trust in You: if there is any hope of salvation for me, be my Savior, and according to your great goodness and mercy, absolve, remit, and forgive all my sins, for my soul is full of trouble, and if I am left to myself, there is for me no hope of salvation. O You who are the God of penitents and the Savior of sinners, save me for your mercy's sake! Where sin has abounded, let your grace abound much more, so that I may send up glory to You, and to your eternal Father, and to your all-holy good and life-giving Spirit, now and always and for ever and ever.

When I try to access the link, it never works (and I' must have tried almost 20 times over the past two days). I'm genuinely interested in what Prof. Taft has to say, from an Orthodox perspective.\n\nBrendan\n\nPosted By: Anonymous Re: Lecture by Fr Taft on \"Uniatism\" - 12:44 PM\n\nNever explain, never apologize? Good summary of the current state of affairs.\n\nIt is too bad that those in the highest positions of the church seem to reflect on an immunity from their own preachings. If we study deeper we probably can find more skeletons in the closet from both sides. How sad. Yet as a Byzantine Catholic, I have constantly heard one side for too long and never the acceptance of the fact that it was Orthodox Christians (bishops at Brest and priests at Uzhorod) who desired union and were not forced into it. Is there anything wrong with a union or communion with Rome?\n\nThe \"Uniates\" are not really the problem but, instead, the denial that there are people who desire it and who wish to follow our Lord's prayer that we be one. There are people who will interpret history to their benefit. Pseudo-church councils to liquidate a church while all the proper heirarchs are in prison is the ultimate game of the Evil One and there is absolutely NO excuse or reason which justified it. I would assume the Evil One laughed on that dark day. If the former KGB now admits the lies but the Orthodox Church doesn't, then what are we to think of this? What are we to think about the issue on Church properties and ownership? In my book, this is an example of stealing of the highest degree - since it was ecclesiastical properties which were stolen. If I stole a chalice or icon from my parish, what consequences would I face before my church community if caught? Even if I wasn't caught, what would my eternal consequences be? I am sure we would be hearing a different tune from the Orthodox if these scandalous events were publicized as much as the Inquisition in the West. As long as the people are not educated to these hideous events, then there is no reason to explain and/or appologize. We only have to hear more yak about the Uniate Problem.

Taft's lecture.\n\nHe made the argument one hardly ever hears these days concerning the sin and crime committed by the Russian Orthodox Church against the Ukrainian Catholic Church.\n\nThe \"hysteria and lies\" of Orthodox writing on this subject that Father Professor mentions is all too true. That is not a reflection on the historic Orthodox Catholic Church of Christ, but of the Moscow Patriarchate.\n\nHe makes a brilliant point in showing how the argument, promoted by the Russian Orthodox, the World Council of Churches and by Vatican complicity, that somehow the Eastern Catholic Churches' existence is in question because they were \"forced\" into union is sheer nonsense.\n\nIf this were true, then the Anglican and Lutheran Churches shouldn't exist either. And the point is that the Kyivan Metropolitan of the time signed the Union of Brest. They were having as many problems with Constantinople and Moscow as they were with Poland.\n\nLater, Eastern Catholicism became a harbinger of renewed national consciousness and the movement for liberation from colonialism under both Poland and Russia. This has always been acknowledged by Orthodox historians who are not of a Russophile orientation.\n\nI daresay the movement back to the Eastern Catholic Church in western Ukraine in 1991 was a great expression of both national as well as religious sentiments.\n\nThis is something Fr. Taft does not discuss in any detail. On the other hand, that was not the point of his lecture, so we can't fault him for that.\n\nFather Taft is a principled Christian who is committed to true Christian and democratic values.\n\nI am sorry, but arguments about the \"complexity\" of the situation in Russia to the contrary, I cannot find anything principled about the Vatican approach to ecumenism with the Russian Church.\n\nFr. Taft is right to call the \"synod\" of 1946 a form of \"ecclesiacide.\" Until Moscow admits its complicity and role in this evil affair, Rome should stay as far away from it as possible. Worldwide Orthodoxy should even consider imposing an excommunication on the Moscow Patriarchate for its refusal to even admit to its sin in this respect.\n\nI say this as someone who loves the Orthodox Church and who wishes, I'll say it, that the Union of Brest never took place as it had a most negative impact on the Ukrainian Church and people.\n\nBut the Ukrainian Catholic Church exists today and it has a right to exist as it did in Ukraine in 1946.\n\nThe Moscow Patriarchate must admit to its sin. Other Orthodox must also recognize the sin of 1946. To do otherwise would be a betrayal of the Gospel of Christ.\n\nIn pain of heart,\n\nAlex\n\nPosted By: Kurt Re: Lecture by Fr Taft on \"Uniatism\" - 04:18 PM\n\nQuote\n\nDon't forget, the classic liturgical language of the Romanians is Slavonic.

This is what we are told by the man who fought the good fight, completed the course, and stayed with the faith (2Tim.4:7).\n\nJust as a royal crown is not made up of one stone, so dispassion is incomplete if we neglect even one of the most ordinary virtues.\n\nThink of dispassion as a kind of celestial palace, a palace of the King of heaven. Think of the numerous mansions (John 14:2) as so many dwelling places within this city. Think of the forgiveness of sins as being the fortifying wall of this Jerusalem. O my brothers, we should run to enter the bridal chamber of this palace, and if some burden of past habits or the passage of time should impede us, what a disaster for us! Let us at least take up residence in one of the mansions near the bridal chamber. But if we begin to falter or weaken, we ought to ensure that at least we are inside the walls, since the man who does not get there before the end, who does not climb that wall, must camp out in the desert. ....\"Is it not your sins that separate you and Me?\"(Isa.59:2).\n\nFriends, let us break through this wall of separation (Eph.2:14), this wall that we in our disobedience built to our own harm. Let us look there for the forgiveness of our sins, since there is no one in hell who can pardon us. Brothers, let us commit ourselves to this, for our names are on the lists of the devout. There must be no talk of \"a lapse,\" \"there is no time,\" or \"a burden.\" To everyone who has received the Lord in baptism, \"He has given the power to become children of God\"(John 1:12). \"'Be still and know that I am God'(Ps.45:11) and am Dispassion,\" He says. To Him be glory forever and ever. Amen.\n\nBlessed dispassion raises the poor mind from earth to heaven, raises the beggar from the dunghill of passion. And love, all praise to it, makes him sit with princes, that is with holy angels, and with the princes of God's people (Ps. 112:7-8).\n\nSt.John Climacus Monastery (Old Calendarist Greek Orthodox)\n\nhttp://clix.to/monastery\n\n[This message has been edited by Vasili (edited 02-02-2001).]\n\nPosted By: Anonymous Re: Lecture by Fr Taft on \"Uniatism\" - 09:35 PM\n\nVasili,\n\nThank you for your kind words and your encouragement.

Taft's lecture brought to mind some sad reminders of the events of 1946.\n\nMy grandfather, John, was a Ukrainian Greek Catholic priest living near L'viv.\n\nHe was arrested in 1946 and spent some time in jail. He was tortured. In the end, he \"signed Orthodoxy\" and became a member of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nHe came to Canada in 1966 and returned to the Eastern Catholic Church, although he never seemed to get rid of the guilt he felt about \"giving in\" to the Soviets.\n\nEach year, he would get me to take him to a Priest in another parish so that he could confess this.\n\nWhen I once told him, \"Grandfather, but you already confessed that, you were forgiven and so you should forget about it.\"\n\nHe replied by saying, \"What do you know? Just take me, please!\"\n\nHe also had a beautiful pectoral Cross that a Russian bishop had given him after a Church he was building in a village where he was stationed was completed.\n\nHe never wore that Cross, it reminded him of the past and he kept it hidden away. When he served the Liturgy at home, when he was too weak to walk, he would never let me place the Cross on him when I helped him vest.\n\nJust before he died, he gave me his blessing. At his funeral, my uncles gave me a brown paper bag. \"Grandfather wanted you to have this,\" they said.\n\nIt was the Cross which I keep proudly in memory of my grandfather. It represents the suffering he and many Eastern Catholics like him endured for Christ.\n\nGod bless,\n\nAlex\n\nThank you very much for sharing this personal story. I have just finished reading Fr. Taft's excellent lecture and it was moving to read of personal experiences connected to this. God grant your grandfather rest.\n\nPax Christi,\n\nJohn\n\nPosted By: Anonymous Re: Lecture by Fr Taft on \"Uniatism\" - 04:37 AM\n\nQuote\n\nOriginally posted by inawe:\n\nSuch a powerful call to penance and to hope!\n\nThank you DTBrown for posting it. Makes me want to put on my sackcloth and ashes and stand at the temple with my sisters and brothers of all the Churches praying, \"Be merciful to us sinners.\" Then go to help my brother or sister who is different from me and mine.\n\nSuch a succinct documenting of the evil that Chruch people do to eachother and to those outside the Churches! This should be distributed in all of the Churches on the same Sunday. Maybe then all of our ecclesiastical hearts would begin to respond to the call of the Spirit to conversion of life and to the practice of love for each other.\n\nPlease do not let the written expression impede the meaning.\n\nJoy!\n\nI understand your sentiments. There are times when I read the history of Christianity that I dismay over the despicable cruelty we have inflicted upon one another and others. Yet at such times I am reminded of Peter and the Apostles, how they were far from perfect as we see quite clearly in the Gospels. The Gospels give one hope that perhaps nothing is impossible despite our human weakness. With Christ all things are possible, even if we are negligent in following Him or wallow in our sins.\n\nPax Christi,\n\nJohn\n\nPosted By: Anonymous Re: Lecture by Fr Taft on \"Uniatism\" - 08:14 PM\n\nDear John,\n\nThank you for your wise words. Even though less than friends some of the time, the Apostles Peter and Paul were guided to the same end. I appreciate your kindness. I am still so upset at what we have and continue to do to our brothers and sisters and to those outside of the Churches.\n\nAgain, thanks,\n\nPlease do not let the written expression impede the meaning.\n\nJoy!\n\nPosted By: Anonymous Re: Lecture by Fr Taft on \"Uniatism\" - 09:26 PM\n\nQuote\n\nOriginally posted by inawe:\n\nThank you for your wise words.

I confess that there are times when I'd like to gather all the obstinate prelates together, East and West, and smack them upside their mitres with a very large and heavy crozier... Yet, this perhaps isn't the most charitable daydream (amusing and perhaps cathartic at times though )... This internecine warfare of the past millenium is so against what Christ taught that it really frustrates me at times. Yet, that is the central problem: we disagree on some major things. *sigh* I wish the Spirit would knock some heads around...\n\nPax Christi,\n\nJohn\n\nPosted By: Anonymous Re: Lecture by Fr Taft on \"Uniatism\" - 02:49 PM\n\nDear John,\n\nI can relate to what you are saying so well. The unredeemed part of me, at times that seems to be a big chunk, wishes that I could be the club. Theosis is certainly a work in process here.\n\nI marvel though at the progress that is being made in getting th e Churches talking to eachother. Its made clear in this forum. There is reason for hope and the need for prayer and work\n\nI enjoy talking with you.\n\nPlease do not let the written expression impede the meaning.\n\nJoy!"
