I want to share the graph in wikipedia, however, I get an automatic message that the image is not licensed. I wonder what is the licence policy about it? Data analyzed on SPSS appears in scientific papers/journals just as if it was analyzed using any other program (e.g., excel or SAS). — Preceding unsigned comment added by Lobastova (talk • contribs)\n\nThe last file that you uploaded actually lacks any license. Ruslik (talk)\n\nA copyright license wouldn't actually be applicable to it, since it isn't a creative work eligible for copyright protection, but it still needs a machine-readable tag with information about its copyright status. I added {{PD-ineligible}}. —LX (talk, contribs)\n\n(via edit conflict) @Lobastova: Which is to say, you need to provide a license. If in doubt, I recommend {{Cc-by-sa-4.0}} which reserves as many rights as you are allowed to. Just add {{self|Cc-by-sa-4.0|author=Lobastova}} to the page, just above the categories. If you wish to be attributed differently than your user name, you can stipulate that instead of your username, but since you have put that in the \"author\" field of the information template, I'm guessing that is what you want. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nLX is probably right, it's so simple it's probably not copyrightable. But in the future, if you have something above the threshold, my advice pertains. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nOn this page https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Media_needing_categories_as_of_4_December_2016&filefrom=49510+%C3%87atakl%C4%B1-Bulan%C4%B1k-Mu%C5%9F%2C+Turkey+-+panoramio.jpg%0A49510+%C3%87atakl%C4%B1-Bulan%C4%B1k-Mu%C5%9F%2C+Turkey+-+panoramio.jpg , beginning at \"A\" I find a number of DOCUMERICA images.

I do not know if ALL the December 4, 2016, uploads are duplicates of DOCUMERICA photos already on Commons, so I hope you can check on the backend and eliminate those that are so categorizers like me do not waste our time. Downtowngal (talk)\n\nIn uploading a series of 8 files there was one file that gave an error. I deleted that file. Uploading that one file with the upload wizard gave the error \"Er staat al een bestand met dezelfde inhoud in de wiki\" (There is already a file with the same content in the wiki). Changing the filename and uploading again gave the same error. What to do? Wouter (talk)\n\nI'm not sure what's going on here, but it might be useful if you give the name of the file that you say you deleted, so that someone can check exactly what state it is in. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nThe filename is \"A0359_Tenerife,_Playa_San_Juan_aerial_view.jpg\". Wouter (talk)\n\nThere is currently File:A0359 Tenerife, Playa San Juan aerial view.jpg, is the file you tried to upload? Christian Ferrer (talk)\n\nYes indeed, that is the file.

But here's what you probably should do.\n\nGo to the relevant article on Wikipedia.\n\nClick the \"History\" tab. That will show who worked on the article. You can use the information there, or work from there to do diffs, to determine what person or people were the primary authors of the article.\n\nYou can click through from there to their respective user pages or user talk page. I then recommend checking the \"User Contributions\" tab to check whether they show any recent activity. If not, they may have left the project and are less likely to respond to you.\n\nYou then have two choices to proceed: (1) you can leave remarks on their talk page and let them respond there. (2) You can open an account of your own. Make sure you associate an email address with your account. Assuming that the user in question has also provided an email address (most do), you can then use the \"email this user\" link on their user page or user talk page to send them an email.\n\nI hope that helps. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nA bit late to answer, but if you need any additional advice or help, most language-specific Wikipedia projects have their own separate help desk. For example, the analogous forum for the English-language Wikipedia is at en:Wikipedia:help desk.

Bubba73 (talk)\n\nIs there some category they are already in or are they all from one uploader (in which case VFC should do nicely, using \"append\")? Otherwise, I'm not sure of any tool that would let you easily select the files to which to add the category. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nThey are all in Category:Richmond Hill, Georgia - the B&W ones for Richmond Hill Plantation. They are most, but not all of the ones in the Richmond Hill category. They must have been uploaded by one person. I don't know how to proceed. Bubba73 (talk)\n\nVisualFileChange does have advanced select files tool which would allow you to select all files in a category uploaded by a specific user. MKFI (talk)\n\nHelp:VisualFileChange.js. It can be a little clunky, but it works. Install it, go to Category:Richmond Hill, Georgia and select \"Perform batch task\" in the left nav. Then you can visually select the images you want, and (given what you want to do) probably use the action \"append any text\". If you are adding a category, remember to put a newline before it. - Jmabel ! talk\n\n@Bubba73: Done That was a quick fix. --Hedwig in Washington (mail?)\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Hedwig in Washington (mail?)\n\nI made a new version of File:Double six.svg where one set of six lines is colored differently to help differentiate it from the other set.

Which images are used in which articles on English Wikipedia is a matter for discussion over at that project. File:Hockey.

The use of the current image was introduced in en:Special:Diff/668578054, so en:User talk:Connormah would be a good place to start the discussion. Before that edit, File:Bill Durnan.png was used in the article and before that File:Bill Durnan.jpg.\n\nAs for the file you uploaded, File:Source 246 3494.jpg, we only hosts content that is either in the public domain (i.e. not protected by copyright, for example because the copyright expired) or that the copyright holder has agreed to publish under a license that allows anyone to use it for any purpose. Before uploading anything here, you must make sure that's the case and provide enough information for others to verify it.

The image in question is tagged with an OGL (Open Government License), which is issued by the United Kingdom. Is that an acceptable license for an image to be placed on Commons? The OGL license is included on the Wikipedia Free Licenses page, which makes me think OGL would be acceptable at Commons. There is a complicating factor that needs to be clarified. The image in question also has a conflicting license tag on its file page: a British Crown Copyright tag, which explicitly says it is a \"non-free license for the purpose of Wikipedia.\" I don't know yet which license tag is correct for the image, OGL or Crown Copyright. Assuming Crown Copyright is not needed, and the OGL license is correct, can the image be uploaded to Commons? Thanks for any info. DonFB (talk)\n\nOGL is accepted, there's a template {{OGL}}. Crown Copyright just means that the copyright holder is the crown, it's not a license and it doesn't conflict. --ghouston (talk)\n\nThank you very much! DonFB (talk)\n\nMili administratorzy.

This is not a case of Wikipedia being difficult, but of copyright law being difficult.\n\nIn the U.S., while buildings are technically copyrighted, there is no problem photographing them: copyright of the photo simply belongs to the photographer. In France, on the other hand, they are much stricter, and you need the architect's (or the architect's heir's) permission. You don't say what country you are in, so it's hard to give you more concrete advice. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nWhen I try to upload an image, I keep receiving this error message:\n\nCould not store upload in the stash (UploadStashFileException): \"Error storing file in '/tmp/AseJ60': Could not connect to storage backend \"local-swift-eqiad\".\".\n\nIs there a technical problem that could be solved soon? --Mlang.Finn (talk)\n\nI had the same problem few minutes ago when I tried to download some photos.

The uploads were blocked by an automatic filter that prevents low-resolution uploads using the particular upload process used by Steeve, on the basis that they overwhelmingly turn out to be copyright violations. Without having seen the photos, if they do depict the uploader, it's unlikely that they are the uploader's own work, so it looks like the filter worked as intended.

Someone else may be able to fill that in. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nOk, thanks Jmabel ! talk I appreciate the assistance. User:TimeForLunch\n\nHello, I would like to make the following request:\n\nI've recently noticed that there are a number of websites hosting free images licenced with CC0. I've just found a list a of such sites. The biggest such site is probably Pixabay. So I think those images should be uploaded automatically and periodically (for example, upload the new images, once in a month) on Wikimedia Commons. If and when those websites will go down (and some of them will, for sure, because they belong to a single photographer), the images will not be lost. — Ark25 (talk)\n\nNot everything will be useful within our scope, and like everything else, such content needs to be license reviewed. To be useful, it needs to be properly described and categorized. I don't think more rushed bulk uploads with sloppy file descriptions and without evaluation of usefulness are what we need right now. —LX (talk, contribs)\n\nStill, it looks like there is a lot of nice stuff on some of those sites. For at least some sites, it might be worth someone assaying what's there, seeing if it's likely that a very high percentage of it is legitimate, and uploading periodically into a category specific to the site, from which people can review. But, to a large extent I agree with LX: the main value of Commons is that most of our content is (1) pretty well vetted and (2) pretty well described and categorized. The bulk of the work involved in making Commons what it is comes from those two things, not just obtaining photos. I often spend up to 10 minutes categorizing someone else's poorly described image because it looks like it might be an image of something important. That time may be free in that I'm a volunteer, but it's not free in that I could be doing something else, thank you. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nI don't have time to check them all, but at least for Pixabay, many of the images are simply breathtaking - they can easily enter in the \"Picture of the year\" contest. The average quality of images at Pixabay is greatly higher than the average on Wikimedia Commons images. They are all CC0 and the majority of them are useful for educational purposes without any doubt, and also well categorized with tags. A robot can upload them, add them in a special, temporary \"Pixabay\" category, and also auto-fill categories using tags - and the author name. And then, let the community check the category \"Pixabay\" and review each image (reviewing means checking/adjusting the categories and maybe add descriptions sometimes). When a user finishes reviewing an image, they should mark it as such, and remove it from the \"Pixabay\" category. The new articles on Wikipedia (many of them poorly categorized) can be kept until the community reviews them and decides to keep or delete. Many times, I've also spent 5-10 minutes for categorizing new Wikipedia articles made by others - that's how this system works. The images can have the same treatment. I notice that images on Pixabay have no description - so we can ask them nicely if they would agree to add a description field. In any case, Wikimedia Commons has plenty of images without description or with useless descriptions so that shouldn't be a big deal anyway.\n\nIt really looks like a huge percent of the images are worth uploading, and then it might be a good idea to ask someone to evaluate them - even to pay someone - I think the WMF can easily afford that. — Ark25 (talk)\n\nOh, I just noticed that the next thread talks about a \"Panoramio bot\" which seems to be doing just that: automatically adding images, without description. Panoramio upload bot — Panoramio Review Bot — Category:Panoramio images reviewed by trusted users — Category:Media lacking a description (299,841 files) - the kind of things that I was talking about. The same thing can be done for Pixabay - automatic or semi-automatic. — Ark25 (talk)\n\nI'm not sure how common it is, but some of the images on Pixabay are digitally enhanced versions of images that can be found elsewhere, including Commons. E.g., [3] is derived from File:Greens-Beach-rocks-20070419-026.jpg. --ghouston (talk)\n\nMaybe there are some programs capable to detect such duplicates or enhanced versions? — Ark25 (talk)\n\nCan someone help me with this file? It doesn't seem to look the same as this. Vs6507\n\nIt's chemically incorrect. Either it is covalent to lithium, with there are Li–O bonds and no atomic charges or it is ionic with charges but no actual bonds to lithium. And if there are charges, there \"+\" on Li are balanced by \"–\" on adjacent O (a en:carbonate ion). Check the relevant articles to decide which approach is correct. DMacks (talk)\n\nOK, thanks for the note. I've removed the covalent bonds and added negative charges. Is it okay now? [4] Vs6507\n\nChemically valid now, yes. The +/– signs should all be equally superscripted, and better to use an en-dash (or is there a special numerical minus sign?) than hyphen? The geometry is off (the three C–O bonds should be 120° from each other). It's not really true that there are two O single-bonded anions and one O double-bonded neutral, but it's a pretty common way to represent it. DMacks (talk)\n\nHow about File:Lithium carbonate.svg, which I made by hand-tweaking the analogous File:Sodium carbonate.svg? DMacks (talk)\n\n@VS6507: any further thoughts here? If not, I'll replace yours (nonstandard geometry and typography) with mine and send yours to COM:DR. DMacks (talk)\n\nNo need to, you should've updated the original final instead of making a duplicate one. Vs6507\n\nI intentionally did not since I thought this discussion would continue, and benefit from seeing both for comparison. Is the new version you uploaded at File:Li2CO3.svg actually mine from File:Sodium carbonate.svg, or did you recreate one that just looks about the same? DMacks (talk)\n\nI wanted to create the exact same picture or maybe the upside down version two weeks ago, but I wasn't notified about your further comments. If I was, I would've definitely done this earlier. I just downloaded your image and edited in Photoshop so I could upload it here. No special changes were made since this was the version I wanted to make. Vs6507\n\nFile:- panoramio (6803).jpg - Panoramio upload bot instantly overwrote this image with a completely different one.

Can overwritten images be retrieved? Thanks, Kalbbes (talk)\n\nYou can contact the bot operator, User:Shizhao, to report the problem. If there are only two cases, they could be fixed individually, I suppose. One method could be: 1. Revert to the first image (the link in the description refers to the first image). 2. Copy the second image and upload it under a different name. 3. Find the second image on panoramio (its panoramio number is in the Commons upload log) and copy its source link (and eventually other information) in the new description page. Another method is to do the opposite: adjust the description page to describe the second photo, and copy and upload the first photo under a different name. But before doing anything, I think it would better to get advice from the bot operator. -- Asclepias (talk)\n\nRequest a split, either with {{Split}} or, if you want to write a bit more like pointing to the very similar file (for a later addition as other version), see COM:SPLIT and sections below. — Speravir –\n\nthx, this a unknown bug, I try fix it--shizhao (talk)\n\nshizhao, Happened to notice another.

There are cases where extreme crops may be unaffected by the copyright of the work they are taken from, but it would depend on the cropped part on its own being ineligible for copyright (e.g. a single dot from a dithered pop art poster). That's clearly not the case here. The cropped portion is above the threshold of originality for copyright protection on its own. Comparing with literary copyright, while you can copy a word or two from a copyrighted text, you can't copy longer passages, but it's the originality of the copied passage that matters, not its length as a percentage of the whole text. —LX (talk, contribs)\n\nWe have some rules here, its Copyrightable, Chinese renminbi, as whole banknote could not be here, as zoomed into the pattern it goes under De minimis.

If they qualify for copyright, see COM:OTRS for what we need. Note that Commons can accept these only if the copyright-holder releases the logo under a free license, which companies rarely are willing to do with copyrighted logos (although of course they can retain trademark, and if the logos are trademarked you can add {{Trademarked}} to clarify that).\n\nAlso: I notice that en:Athenasphere is a tiny stub that you started yourself, and that it has been nominated for deletion for non-notability. If this is paid work you are doing for companies that do not yet have Wikipedia articles, it is very likely that these logos will be outside of Commons' scope.

But if you wanted to link to a page named, for example, Adolf Chlumský, you could link like this: [[:cs:Adolf Chlumský|Adolf Chlumský]]. -- Asclepias (talk)\n\nOr {{w|Adolf Chlumský|Adolf Chlumský|cs}}. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nFile:Vlag ontbreekt.svg seems to be an error message rather than a flag. Does anyone know what's wrong with the file? WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\n@WhatamIdoing: Looks fine to me. It's a placeholder for missing flags: a question mark on a two-tone gray background (two columns in different grays). Are you seeing something different from that? - Jmabel ! talk\n\nNo, that's what I'm seeing. In the context that I saw it, including an non-existent image doesn't seem appropriate, so I assumed that there was a problem with the file itself. Thanks for explaining it to me.

Ed [talk] [majestic titan]\n\nHello, I just uploaded this image from the Library of Congress: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Soldiers_at_the_Siegfried_Line,_February_1945.jpg\n\nI inserted it in the article on the Siegfried Line: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegfried_Line\n\nShould I crop extraneous material from the photo before I upload it to Wikimedia Commons? AugusteBlanqui (talk)\n\nI think you should crop it for the use in articles, but upload it as a separate file. Ruslik (talk)\n\nIt should also be free-rotated, approx 1.5% or such. If you don't feel up for that task I can do so for you, AugusteBlanqui. Since the photographer Antoinette Frissell died in 1988, it is still copyrighted and I presume it will be taken down from commons in due time anyway, or is there a different rational that it could stay? --Rava77 (talk)\n\nThe two possible public domain rationales are stated on the description page. The uploader believed that it is PD-USGov. That is possible, perhaps, if on that day Frissell took that particular photo in the course of duties for the WAC. However, the negatives remained with Frissell and her statement of release to the public domain suggests that she owned the copyright until the release. The LoC considers that it is in the public domain by the release by Frissell, not as PD-Gov. For that reason, I added the template PD-Frissell, which seems safer. It's one or the other, PD-USGov or PD-Frissell, but either way it's in the public domain. -- Asclepias (talk)\n\nWhen the extraneous material contains some information that might be useful to preserve, it is better to crop after. When it contains nothing useful, it may be better to crop before. -- Asclepias (talk)\n\nThe area around would only be important if someone wants to change hue, gamma or such. For cropping and rotating the surrounding data is not necessary, and for the photo itself it also contains no data useful to preserve, still I say the original photo should be preserved as well, and the cropped & rotated version should be saved as a new file, since I am no expert when it comes to gamma, hue or even raw processing (though, we have no raw data scan anyway I presume?) So, who will do the crop&rotating. Should I do it? If AugusteBlanqui not answers in the next 6 hours I will do the job. --Rava77 (talk)\n\nI've uploaded the highest resolution version at File:Soldiers at the Siegfried Line, February 1945.tiff, and crops and rotates should be done from that.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\n4,921 × 6,000 pixels, file size: 84.51 MB, indeed that's some high quality. Thanks. I wonder, should the rotate/crop first be saved as a tiff, and then converted as a png? Or only saved as an png since tiff is usually not used on the web for displaying images? --Rava77 (talk)\n\nIt's a personal decision. There's an argument to go straight to JPG, as that's the most web-friendly image format, and forcing anyone who wants to do further edits to go back to the TIFF is probably not a problem. A PNG or TIFF can be used if you think that people will probably want to reedit starting from the crop; note that Wikimedia serves JPG versions of TIFF files for normal display, but PNG versions of PNG files.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nI uploaded an image to which we have full rights, but the image was deleted with the notation that it was a possibly copyright violation. How do we get the image to display? Thanks. — Preceding unsigned comment added by IndianaHistory (talk • contribs)\n\nI presume this is about File:Curtis Hill.jpg.

While having a brain cramp I made the image that is currently at https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/5/5d/20170115201928%21RibosomeProfilejpg.jpg\n\nAbout a minute after uploading, I realized my mistake, made a new version and uploaded it at https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RibosomeProfilejpg.jpg\n\nI see the {{speedydelete|Reason}} tag, but I don't know how to use it. Please advise. Thanks, DennisPietras (talk)\n\nIf I understand this correctly, the only place the first image is available is as part of the history of the file. We don't delete those unless there are legal issues, etc. \"Deletion\" is always \"soft\", so it doesn't save any disk space, and no one sees these images unless they are specifically looking at the file history. - Jmabel ! talk\n\n@Jmabel: My brain cramp is going to exist forever!!! What a depressing thought! DennisPietras (talk)\n\nFWIW, there are tens of thousands of these on Commons, maybe hundreds of thousands, and I bet you never noticed any. Almost no one ever does, which is why it isn't worth the cleanup effort, any more than the fact that there might have been misspellings somewhere in the history of a page. - Jmabel ! talk\n\n@Jmabel: Please don't bother to take the time to reply to this, it is just a statement of my opinion. On my computer I can easily delete a brain cramp and allow the disk space to be overwritten by another file. I don't understand why it is such an effort for the commons to do that, and thus force memory to be used forever by brain cramps. Please, don't reply. DennisPietras (talk)\n\nPanoramio upload bot apparently uploaded thousands of images on January 16 from [[5]] and placed them in multiple categories of Pakistan, all of them having the \"needs checking\" template on them. The photos have multiple tages on them and apparently somehow they are being put in many of those categories at once. I noticed when I tried putting some new uploads in Category:Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and saw about 1500 new images in that category, all needing checking. First I moved about 150 into separate categories, (Category:Dallan (73), Category:Daber road‎ (61), Category:Dallan Madrassa‎ (3), Category:Dallan road‎ (7), even though the categories made no sense to me for the photos, but then I realized the job was too big for me. Many of them are also in other Pakistan categories simultaneously. For example, 143 are in Category:North Waziristan Agency, Category:Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Category:Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at the same time. There are probably other Pakistan categories flooded as well.\n\nIf the Panoramio upload bot is uploading all photos from this photographer at Panoramio, them there are thousand more. How to deal with this? Kalbbes (talk)\n\nVFC is probably your \"best friend\" in matters like this. Assuming the same pattern of text is in the categories area of numerous photos, you can use VFC to replace that with something more appropriate (e.g. strip the repeating block and replace it with a single Category:Pakistan files from Panoramio to be checked). Unless you are very experienced with VFC, I strongly recommend that you experiment with a handful of files first. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nJmabel, I tried experimenting with VFC and got nowhere since I'm not a technical person, don't understand what VFC is asking for and I don't know regular expressions. And it's not just those Pakistan photos that bot screws up. For example, look at File:Tall Ships Race Dublin 2012 - panoramio (33).jpg and File:Sukhoi Su-24 reconnaissance aircraft. - panoramio.jpg and File:Sights on tour from Bagiou to the north - panoramio.jpg and File:A place I can't forget - panoramio.jpg. Some files it just enters \"Asia\". Should the bot be entering categories at all, never mind so many? Kalbbes (talk)\n\nI give up. I've spent the better part of two hours and can't get to first base with VFC. I'll just uncategorise those files and place them in Category:Pakistan files from Panoramio to be checked by hand. Kalbbes (talk)\n\nJmabel, never mind. I've made 98,254 edits here in a year. I'd burn myself out taking care of over 1500 files in Category:Khyber Pakhtunkhwa alone by hand, not counting the other Pakistan categories flooded by this Panoramio upload bot. I'll no longer watch over Pakistan. Thanks for your suggestions, but this is over my head, ruined my enjoyment here, so it's best I stay away from things I can't handle. Thanks again, Kalbbes (talk)\n\nI want to delete a photo I put in by mistake — Preceding unsigned comment added by Drenowe (talk • contribs)\n\n@Drenowe: It would sure help if you would indicate what photo! If it's a recent upload, this can easily be accommodated; if it's older, presuming you licensed it correctly, you'll have to go through the same deletion process as for anyone else's photo, because once you've granted an irrevocable license you can't take it back.\n\nIn general, to do this, just tag the file page with {{speedydelete|Accidental upload}}. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nI took a picture of a building owned by the Baltimore City Department of Recreation and Parks that was constructed in 1974 and I'm trying to figure out if I hold the copyright as the photographer or if the copyright holder is the building's architect. I came across a similar discussion in the archives and one of the replies seems to imply that I have the copyright: In the U.S., while buildings are technically copyrighted, there is no problem photographing them: copyright of the photo simply belongs to the photographer.\" Is the answer that simple or is there more to it? I'm not sure if this matters, but FWIW there is some scenery in the background, but the only reason I'd want to upload it would be to use it in a few articles that talk about that building. Thoughts?

I have tried to upload it twice now, and apparently am not classifying it correctly for the copyright. How would I go about uploading this picture for it to remain? — Preceding unsigned comment added by Delfry88 (talk • contribs)\n\nPhysical possession of a photograph does not mean owning the copyright to it, which would typically belong to the photographer or the photographer's heirs. Similarly, being the subject of the photo gives you personality rights, but not the copyright. So unless you know who that photographer would be, and can get their permission, there is no way to meet the requirements here on Commons. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nIt is imaginable that, for the English-language Wikipedia only, you can meet their lower bar for non-free use. - Jmabel ! talk\n\n公開範囲について。〔大日本沿海輿地全図 〕. 第９０図 武蔵・下総・相模(武蔵・利根川口・東京・小仏・下総・相模・鶴間村) 公開範囲インターネット公開（保護期間満了）国立国会図書館デジタルコレクション --Koshiyou (talk)\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nNot only I'm a newbie here on Wiki, but I find it EXTREMELY difficult to find my way around.Someone please help me!

The image cannot possibly be 1922, the technology is much too recent. It is actually from the magazine vol. 46, no. 3, May/June 1967. I have corrected the dates in the template, and somebody else had already taken care of the category. So should the title also be changed? There seems to be a large number of images from Bell Telephone Magazine, all titled as \"1922\" and with the same similar problems on the page. Way more than I want to deal with. SpinningSpark\n\nThey all may be copyvios. Ruslik (talk)\n\n@Spinningspark: we have quite a few periodicals sourced from archive.org, who file all the issues under the date of the first one in their collection—which then shows up in our filenames or metadata. Fæ does a lot of automated uploading and also runs bots through a lot of the files afterwards to fix such problems; at any rate he’d probably be the best person to ask about the feasibility of handling them ‘in bulk’. (@Ruslik0: I guess they‘re {{PD-US-no notice}}.)—Odysseus1479 (talk)\n\nThe IA is only as good as the contributor, in this case the source is the Prelinger Library. The digitization was for a 'book' of Bell telephone magazines dating from 1922 through to 1967. Unfortunately both on Flickr (where IA has put clips from the \"book\") and at the IA source, the only date against pages or extracted images is the first year of publication. There is then the presumption of 'no copyright known'. If we have a DR which assesses that images from the magazine are copyright if after, say, 1946, then we can use the IA 'page' number to check which images were published after that year. This would be the only way of doing this without a human identifying where one issue of the magazine ends and another starts.\n\nFeel free to start a DR if you are concerned. Past key DR discussions for this batch upload project can be found at User:Fæ/Project_list/Internet_Archive#Useful_reference_deletion_discussions. In particular, consider Commons:Deletion requests/File:The Ladies' home journal (1889) (14580245160).jpg, as many of the later images may not be PD by age, but may still be public domain if there was no copyright renewal. --Fæ (talk)\n\nThe binding is not actually all years 1922-1967 and it should be possible to discover a more accurate date by automatic process. Following the link to \"Catalog Entry\" takes you to the Internet Archive page where the \"Volume\" field tells me the binding is actually vols. 45-46. That can be converted to a year with vol+1921. This binding therefore covers 1966-1967. Pinning it down to an exact magazine issue is more problematic, but \"1966-1967\" is at least not misleading whereas \"1922\" is so wildly innacurate that if I were to use that information on Wikipedia, I would be accused of creating hoaxes. This picture would imply, for instance, that not only transistors were in existence in 1922, but that integrated circuits using them were already a mature technology. As someone who worked in the industry for a long time, the \"wrongness\" of the date just leapt out at me. Other users may not have the benefit of that experience.

According to the newspaper article in which the photographs were contained (see here -- in Greek) the file contains material from the 1930s till Velouchiotis's death in 1945, but, taking into account Velouchiotis's appearance and attire, these photographs were surely taken before 1942.

I thought I should add FWIW that, upon more careful inspection, one of the three photographs (all of which seem to be parts of the same mug shot series) displays a sign with a date \"31-7-1930\", which -I infer- should be the date the photographs were taken. Ασμοδαίος (talk)\n\nIt would help to know more about the publication history. Even assuming their original copyrights to have expired, if the photos were previously unpublished then Realnews will have publication rights for 25 years (until the end of 2041). I don’t know what the pre-1997 Greek law said about work for hire, but if the police service owned the rights and a 70-y post-creation term applied, the photos would not have been free until 2001, so under URAA would receive extended US copyright for 120 y after creation (until the end of 2050).

I fill in the form using \"not known\" for the license, and explain the circumstances as well as I can, but a few weeks later my version gets deleted; as you can see on my talk page. Other editors have recommend various versions of the Special:Upload page 1 2 3, but trying all three is a palaver, and sometimes none of them lists the license I need.\n\nBut last month, another editor recommended a trick to use: do the upload using any license that's listed in the dropdown list, and once it's done, edit the image's page so as to show the correct license instead of the one I uploaded it with. Is that trick acceptable? If it is it's very useful, and I wonder why it isn't documented. Maproom (talk)\n\nExceptional situations might exist where a trick might be acceptable, but this does not sound like an exceptional situation. In the case you explain, it's not the best solution, because if, as you say, you actually know the correct license tag that you would add later, then you can as easily add that correct license tag directly when uploading. You say other users suggested Special:Upload, which I suppose should work fine if you insert the license tag in the permission field there. Was there a problem when you tried it? Another option is my favorite upload form, the basic form, where you can format everything before uploading exactly as it should be. -- Asclepias (talk)\n\nThank you, Asclepias, I'll try that next time. The dropdown list has more options than any of the Special:Upload pages, so I hope it'll cover what I need. What do I put in the \"Source\", \"Date\", and \"Author\" fields? the data for the existing file that I've modified, or for my modified version? Maproom (talk)\n\nI think you're giving too much importance to dropdown lists. Dropdown lists are just optional tools that list some frequent options and, if they happen to list what you want, you may use them, or not. In your case, you said you know what tag you would use if you edited the description page after the upload. So, if a dropdown list doesn't have what you want, don't use a dropdown list. Instead, before the upload, simply use exactly the tag you want directly in the freely editable box of the basic upload form. (Or in the permission field of the Special:Upload form). You can edit what you want there, before upload, just like you would do it in a description page after the upload.\n\nIn the source, date, and author fields, well, write what you normally write in those fields. It's hard to be specific without knowing the actual files. It depends in part on the requirements of the license of each original work. The idea is that the description page should include what is necessary to allow the readers to know clearly all the information relating to the original work and to your modified version. -- Asclepias (talk)\n\nWhen using UploadWizard (your third link), you just need to select \"This file is not my own work.\" and \"Another reason not mentioned above\" when choosing the license, and copy-paste the license wikitext from the original file into the text field. Matma Rex (talk)\n\nMy experience (as evidenced on my talk page) is that when I don't select the \"right\" license from the dropdown list, it doesn't matter how much I explain all the details in the other fields, the image gets deleted. That is why I consider the dropdown list important. Maproom (talk)\n\nI see annotations on the photograph of Princess Maud's wedding here.

I'm a newbie intent on adding images and video content to biology pages. I've deceived myself into feeling confident enough about images that I switched to my first video. There is a wonderful video at https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e21600/media2 that compares the protein actin, found in us, and the protein crenactin, found in bacteria. I figure out how to save it from the elife site to my computer, then tried to upload it to the commons. The wizard stopped me because it doesn't accept mp4 files. So, I went to https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Converting_video for help, which led me to the online converter at http://convert-video-online.com/ It seemed that I could upload the file OK, and was able to select the commons prefered webm output format, but when I tried to convert, it gave me an error message \"conversion error occurred\". So, I turned to another approach suggested on the help page: VLC on my computer. The VLC approach worked to convert it to a .ogg file, but as you can see if you compare the 2 videos, the ogg is poor in comparison to the mp4. Now, IMHO, the ogg file is still a great video, but not as great as the mp4. I have 2 concerns: 1) I'm concerned about the licensing, because the ogg video is not the same as the mp4 video, yet the wizard didn't give me an opportunity to declare that I converted the video, which would take elife \"off the hook\" for preparing a lesser quality video. 2) Do you have any experience with this sort of conversion and suggestions for how I can make a higher quality conversion? I'm using a Dell PC. Thanks, DennisPietras (talk)\n\nHmm, the title of this section didn't work the way I expected it to.

Thanks, DennisPietras (talk)\n\nHello, I have been creating svgs of older logos for a while now, and would like to add them to their respective pages. How would I got about this? I know you \"should have permission from the original author\" in order to upload logos, but the majority of the logos I have created a well out of date, and the majority of the companies they belong to have either died off or were merged.\n\nThank you\n\n19adam99 (talk)\n\nWhether the company is still around could be a trademark issue, but not a copyright issue, and all that's needed here for a trademarked image as such is the {{Trademark}} template.\n\nCopyright, however, is not extinguished by the company dying. If you are talking about logos from, say, the 19th century, they should be public domain, as should be anything from the U.S. pre-1923 (since a logo was inevitably published). U.S. logos up to 1963 would be OK if the owner ever published them in a work that was not copyrighted or for which copyright was not renewed, and clear up to 1978 in a work that was not copyrighted. For other countries this will be different; you don't say what countries you are concerned with.\n\nAs for \"permission from the original author\", though, that does not change just because the original author is difficult or impossible to locate. Orphaned copyrights are very inconvenient and annoying, but that's simply the way it is. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nThe country of origin hasn’t been mentioned, but in the US the threshold of originality is quite high. Marks comprising only simple logotypes, geometric shapes, and conventional iconic symbols have been held not to be copyrightable by American courts, so can be treated as public-domain and uploaded here on that basis. But most other countries have lower TOO, at least presumably—legal precedents are often lacking. See en:File:Australian Aboriginal Flag.svg for an example of how simple a design can be protected in Australia.\n\nWhen you say “their respective pages“, @19adam99, do you mean on the English Wikipedia? If so, you can probably upload them there, as non-free content. You will have to supply a fair use rationale, and make the nominal size of each graphic no larger than 10,000 square pixels (pointless though this is in practice for vector art). Only one logo per article is usually allowed, unless the text discusses the branding in enough detail to warrant fuller illustration, and unused files will get deleted.—Odysseus1479 (talk)\n\n{{Mul}} I wanted to use this template in the same manner that I would use {{En}} in the Description field of {{Information}} for File:(R)-3-phenyl-cyclohanone.gif but {{Mul}} does not provide a multi-lingual description field but a drop-down menu for several different language descriptions. Is there an appropriate template that I can use for descriptions that are trans-lingual? —Justin (koavf)❤T☮C☺M☯\n\nSometimes User's are uploading Movies Copy in Commons so there should me an act in Commons to come over this problem if The publisher of movie claim agains wikimedia foundation that will be collision. like this file:\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/­File:Raees2017.webm Abir 07:37, 30 January 2017 (UTC)\n\n@Mohammed Galib Hasan: That file doesn't exist. —Justin (koavf)❤T☮C☺M☯\n\nIf you find a copyright violation, you can nominate it for deletion.

To file \"Google Play Services Logo.png\" are notified of the need to specify the license information.\n\nPurpose of use the image of this file in article: to serve as the primary means of visual identification at the top of the article dedicated to the entity in question. Can you helm me to correctly identify the information to indicate the type of license?\n\nI found the article \"Google Play\" (https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play), in which there is an image / file \"Google Play.svg\" (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Google_Play.svg).\n\nIn the section \"Licensing\" the author points out tags:\n\n{{PD-textlogo}}\n\n{{PD-shape}}\n\n{{Trademarked}}\n\nQuestion 1: This approach is correct?\n\nQuestion 2: Can I specify similar tags?\n\n--WikiStierlitz (talk)\n\nI believe the approach in File:Google_Play.svg is correct, though it would not apply to File:Google Play Services Logo.png.\n\nFile:Google_Play.svg involves text, File:Google Play Services Logo.png does not, so {{PD-textlogo}} would be irrelevant for the latter.\n\nFile:Google_Play.svg is very close to the maximum complexity for {{PD-shape}}. That is, in fact, the one place I'd have some doubts about File:Google_Play.svg, but not to the level where I personally would challenge it. File:Google Play Services Logo.png is distinctly farther from being \"simple geometric shapes\", to the point where I believe it would not be eligible for Commons.\n\nIn the unlikely event that others determine that File:Google Play Services Logo.png qualifies for {{PD-shape}} then, yes, {{Trademarked}} would be in order.\n\nI don't know what rules ru-wiki may have for non-free use. It may be possible to upload this image to ru-wiki on a non-free use basis and use it in that particular wiki. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nDear Jmabel, thank you for the answers.\n\nI had a number of questions to the information that you provided.\n\nYou said: \"I believe the approach in File:Google_Play.svg is correct, though it would not apply to File:Google Play Services Logo.png.\"\n\nMy Question 3: Which template (or several templates) is the most appropriate for inclusion in the section \"Licensing\" for the file \"File:Google Play Services Logo.png\"?\n\nYou said: \"I don't know what rules ru-wiki may have for non-free use.\"\n\nMy Question 4: Why do you remember about the \"ru-wiki\"?\n\nMy Question 5: What do you mean by the phrase \"for non-free use\"?\n\nYou said: \"It may be possible to upload this image to ru-wiki on a non-free use basis and use it in that particular wiki.\"\n\nMy Question 6: Do you have access to view the history of changes \"File:Google Play.svg\" (https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Google_Play.svg&action=history) ? — Preceding unsigned comment added by WikiStierlitz (talk • contribs)\n\nYou ask (Question 3) \"Which template (or several templates) is the most appropriate... for the file \"File:Google Play Services Logo.png\"?\" but my point was that in my opinion File:Google Play Services Logo.png is not suitable for Commons.\n\nQuestion 4 makes little sense. Why do I remember? Because you provided a link to ru-wiki in your question.\n\nQuestion 5: discussion of the use non-free content in en-wiki. I do not see an analogous linked page for ru-wiki, but ru:Википедия:Критерии добросовестного использования would seem to lay out the policy there. I don't read enough Russian to plunge into that, but presumably you do.\n\nQuestion 6: yes, I can access that. You should have no problem accessing it either, it's a public page. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nMy Question 7: How did you find my request in Commons:Help desk?\n\nMy Question 8: Why did you decide to write a comment (respond) to my request in Commons:Help desk?\n\nPre-question to Question 9:\n\nWhen you open the page \"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Google_Play_Services_Logo.png\" you can see the information that the \"File:Google Play Services Logo.png\" was deleted by user Jcb.\n\nMy Question 9: Do you know user Jcb?\n\nMy Question 10: Do you know, why user Jcb decided to delete \"File:Google_Play_Services_Logo.png\"?\n\nPre-question to Question 11:\n\nYou said:\n\n\"It may be possible to upload this image to ru-wiki on a non-free use basis and use it in that particular wiki.\"\n\nand\n\nYou andswed on my Question 6:\n\n\"yes, I can access that. You should have no problem accessing it either, it's a public page.\"\n\nIf you have access to view the history of changes \"File:Google Play.svg\" (https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Google_Play.svg&action=history), you can find a record of the creation of the page \"File:Google Play.svg\".\n\nThus, in the history of the changes you can see that page for the file \"File:Google Play.svg\" was created by user Carlitoscarlos (https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Google_Play.svg&oldid=193808798).\n\nAnd on the page (https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Google_Play.svg&oldid=193808798) you can see section \"Summary\", where we see the details:\n\nDescription - Español: Logo de Google Play\n\nDate - 8 April 2016\n\nSource - Own work\n\nAuthor - Carlitoscarlos\n\nMy Question 11: Do you have any suspicions about connections user Carlitoscarlos and \"ru-wiki\"? — Preceding unsigned comment added by WikiStierlitz (talk • contribs) 21:59, 31 January 2017 (UTC) My Question 10: — Preceding unsigned comment added by WikiStierlitz (talk • contribs)\n\nRe question 7, I'm one of the main people who answers questions here on the help desk.\n\nRe question 8: Yes, I think he was correct to do that. As I said above, I don't think that image is eligible to be on Commons.\n\nRe question 9: I \"know\" him only in the sense that he is another very active admin here, so occasionally we cross paths on the wiki.\n\nRe question 10: I don't know why he did it, you'd have to ask him. @Jcb: any comment here? But I'd presume he did so for the reason I gave above: it looks to me to be too complicated to be in the public domain, so it's presumably a copyright violation. His deletion summary \" external source, no license, no permission\" didn't use the actual phrase \"copyright violation\", but it's tantamount to that.\n\nRe question 11: I know nothing about User:Carlitoscarlos. As far as I can tell, it's the first time I've heard of him. & I have no idea how a user would have \"suspicious\" connections to a wiki. What's your point?\n\nThis started out as being about you wanting to use an image in ru-wiki. I've told you that the image is not appropriate for Commons and aimed you at the Russian-language page in ru-wiki that discusses whether you can upload it there. I don't read much Russian, so at this point I think you are better equipped than I to read the relevant policy and act accordingly. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nYes, I deleted it as a copyright violation. The image is above the threshold of originality, so that {{PD-shape}} or {{PD-textlogo}} cannot be applied. The summary \"external source, no license, no permission\" is automatically being generated by one of our robots that is in place to tag the most obvious copyright violations for deletion directly after upload.
