        "text": "The article presents the results of the 􀂿 rst study of iconographic, compositional, and stylistic features of zoomorphic images in embroideries made in the 19th and the early 20th cent. by Russian women – members of the old residents’ community of Western Siberia. The analysis reveals several types of decorative compositions. Hypotheses concerning the origins and functions of the embroideries in Siberian Russian folk culture are proposed. The specimens, collected during 􀂿 eld studies in the 1980s and 1990s, were preserved either by old women who had made them in their youth or by relatively young women as a memory of their grandmothers, mothers, and mothers-in-law. Certain towels were memorial, i.e. they were received after the death of a woman who had made them. Ethnographic data indicate that animal images such as horses, lions, dogs, hares, elephants, etc., differ in origin. To understand their function and meaning, both their prototypes and their late transformations must be considered along with intercultural contacts and the impact of urban culture.\n\nThis paper will focus on analyzing how cultural revitalization movements function. By adopting three distinct theoretical vantage points, namely those of cultural analysis, anthropological semiotics and systems theory the semantically overburdened term 'culture' will be deconstructed. Culture is presented as a network of meanings from which people, based on the structural opportunities available to them in the context of their lives appropriate symbolic devices in order to construct \"strategies of action\". The capacity of these strategies to shape appropriate behavior in relation to the threats of a constantly shifting environment determines social stability. During unsettled periods individuals experience increased levels of psychosomatic stress which leads to the discontinuation of patterned behavior and can lead to complete societal implosion. It is during such periods that people are more willing to transfer the responsibility for their actions to agents who offer them the chance to participate in uniform processes of symbolic communication and strictly patterned behavior as long as it reinforces their perceived personal or collective identity. Recent years saw a cultural boom in Romania centered around the rediscovery of traditional textile crafts. Urban women across the nation mobilized in a unified movement to express their creativity but also their common identity by learning to create the Ia, the historic Romanian rural clothing, according to what they believe are the authentic historic rules. Promoting the appreciation for handmade crafts and a do-it-yourself lifestyle that the traditional Ia represents, they seek to solve the problems post-socialist Romanian society is facing and thus successfully engage in the process of cultural revitalization.\n\nThe paper focuses on online consumer activism targeting Belarusian vyshyvanka, i.e. commodities with geometric ornament. Its reinvention was spurred by a global trend of nation branding and by post-socialist nation building. The consumption of ornamented products incites ‘rebranding of the nation’ which gets resemanticized and reinvented via online user-led content creation, as prosumers, often younger cosmopolitan urbanites, like, share, discuss, remix and perform other kinds of digital manipulations with recognizable geometric imagery. In their online incarnations, ornamented products become a semiotic space where ideas about nationhood are explored. At the same time, as online communities reinvent the meaning and socially reinforce the use of ornamented commodities, they re-create their group solidarity and social cohesion. The mechanics of this integration relies on the ability of some digital units to serve as memes and pointers, with the help of which, users can become aware of each other."
