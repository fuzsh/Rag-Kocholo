        "text": "This article shows how the Cossacks developed the concept of a united Cossack Ukraine on both banks of the Dnipro as their \" fatherland \" and began viewing this \" fatherland \" as an object of common identity, loyalty, and reverence. It demonstrates that in a period of two decades the Cossack elite underwent a major shift in group identity from considering as its fatherland the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in favour of a Cossack Ukrainian/Little Russian polity. It further indicates that all major political actors in Cossack Ukraine accepted and adopted this concept and that by the late 1680s the idea of a Ukrainian/Little Russian fatherland had become entrenched in early modern Ukrainian political culture. Finally, it points to the long-term consequences of this identity shift on relations with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Muscovy/Russia, and the emergence of a modern Ukrainian identity. RÉSUMÉ : Cet article montre comment les Cosaques ont développé le concept d'une Ukraine cosaque unie, située sur les deux rives du Dniepr, représentant leur « patrie » et ont commencé à voir cette « patrie » comme un objet d'identité commune, de loyauté et de vénération. Il démontre qu'en deux décennies, un retournement majeur de l'identité de groupe s'est opéré au sein de l'élite cosaque qui en est venue à considérer comme sa patrie non plus la République des Deux-Nations, mais un régime politique cosaque ukrainien/petit-russien. L'article montre en outre que tous les acteurs politiques importants de l'Ukraine cosaque ont accepté et ont adopté ce concept et qu'à la fin des années 1680, l'idée d'une patrie ukrainienne/petite-russienne s'était enracinée dans la culture politique de l'Ukraine alors à l'aube de sa modernité. Finalement, ce texte met en lumière les conséquences à long terme de ce changement identitaire sur les relations de l'Ukraine avec d'un côté la République des Deux Nations et de l'autre la Moscovie/Russie, ainsi que sur l'émergence d'une identité ukrainienne moderne. In the last several decades there has been a growing interest in early modern discourses on identity and patriotism and whether such discourses represent a direct link between early modern and modern expressions of identity and national consciousness. 1 Most national histories assume such a link. However,\n\nTranslation from Ukrainian. Stolen Name, Why Rusyns Turned into Ukrainians is one of his publications where history studies are combined with linguistic research, which made it possible to provide a complete picture of the Ukrainian history through the life of the name of our nation, starting from the earliest years to the present-day. The books reveals precise facts from the history of Ukraine and Russia which make it clear, how easily imperial historians falsely interpreted the facts and even rewrote them deliberately for political purposes of the ruling regime.Y. Nakonechnyi's Stolen Name is a book of great power of persuasion, all statements supported by references to authentic materials and scientific research. Being a profound study, it is nonetheless read as an adventure story, full of exciting events and discoveries. Written in 2001, it seems to contain answers to a great number of questions of today, not only for Ukraine and Russia but also for the whole world.\n\nThis book examines and analyses the Union between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Sweden signed in 1655 at Kėdainiai and the political crisis that followed. The union was a result of strong separatist dreams among the Lithuanian-Ruthenian Protestant elite led by the Radziwiłł family, and if implemented it would radically change the balance of power in the Baltic Sea region. The main legal point of the Union was the breach of Lithuanian federation with Poland and the establishment of a federation with Sweden. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania aspired to return to international relations as a self-governing subject. The Union meant a new Scandinavian alternative to Polish and Russian domination. The author places the events in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the general crisis that occurred in Europe in the middle of the 17th century characterized by a great number of wars, rebellions and civil wars from Portugal to Ukraine, and which builds the background to the crisis for Lithuania and Sweden. The research proved the importance of lesser powers in changing the geopolitical balance between the Great Powers. The conflict over Lithuania and Belarus was the main reason for the Swedish-Russian, Polish-Russian and Ukrainian-Russian wars. The failure of the Union with Sweden was caused by both internal and external factors. Internally, various ethnic, confessional and political groups within the nobility of Lithuania were split in favour of different foreign powers – from Muscovy to Transylvania. The external cause for the failure of the Union project was the failure of Swedish strategy. Sweden concentrated its activity to Poland, not to Lithuania. After the Union, Swedish authorities treated the Grand Duchy as an invaded country, not an equal. The Swedish administration introduced heavy taxation and was unable to control the brutality of the army. As a result Sweden was defeated in both Lithuania and Poland. Among the different economic, political and religious explanations of the general crisis, the case of Lithuania shows the importance of the political conflicts. For the separatists of Lithuania the main motive to turn against Poland and to promote alliance with Sweden, Russia or the Cossacks was the inability of Poland to shield the Grand Duchy from a Russian invasion.The Lithuanian case was a provincial rebellion led by the native nobility against their monarch, based on tradition of the previous independence and statehood period. It was not nationalism in its modern meaning, but instead a crisis of identity in the form of a conflict between Patria and Central Power. However, the cost of being a part of Sweden or Muscovy was greater than the benefit of political protection. Therefore, the pro-Polish orientation prevailed when Poland after 1658 recovered its military ability the local nobility regrouped around Warsaw. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania managed to remain on the political map of Europe, but at the price of general religious Catholization and cultural Polonization. After the crisis, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania gradually changed into a deep province of the Polish state.\n\nThe paper deals with the vagaries of linguistic russification among the Ukraini-ans from the mid-seventeenth century to 1914. The authors explore the major stages in the implementation of the policies of russification in Russian Ukraine, starting with first bans on books printed in Church Slavonic of the Ukrainian recension via the decrees and edicts issued by Peter I together with the Holy Synod to the punitive measures taken by the tsarist regime against new literary Ukrainian in the second half of the nineteenth century. The authors distinguish three languages (Church Slavonic of the Ukrainian recension, Ruthenian, and new literary Ukrainian) which were consecutively exposed to various forms of hostile language management by the tsarist administration. Based on these three languages and the classification into different models of imperial policy, a new periodization of linguistic rus-sification and denationalization is substantiated. The material analyzed with the help of this new periodization proves that Russia's rulers had special reasons for treating Ukraine more severely than other non-Russian areas, resulting in a constant, consistent, and long-lasting policy of linguistic russification in Russian Ukraine. Аннотация Статья посвящена особенностям языковой руссификации среди украин-цев с середины семнадцатого столетия до 1914 г. Авторы рассматривают основные этапы реализации политики руссификации в подроссийской Украине со времен пер-вых запретов книг, составленных на церковнославянском языке украинского извода, указами Петра I и Священного Синода до притеснений современного украинского литературного языка царским режимом во второй половине девятнадцатого века. По мнению авторов, объектом враждебной политики со стороны царской администрации были три языка украинцев, а именно: украинский церковнославянский язык, простая мова и новый украинский литературный язык. Основываясь на указанных трех языках и классификации имперских моделей, авторы предлагают новый тип периодизации, B A. Danylenko A. Danylenko, H. Naienko применение которого доказывает, что у правителей России были всегда веские осно-вания для того, чтобы относиться к Украине жестче, чем к иным не-русским землям. Все это позволяет утверждать, что языковая руссификация в подроссийской Украине была постоянной, последовательной и долговременной."
