        "text": "Volhynia, in particular, experienced a significant cultural and religious revival in the late 1570s. The principal benefactor of the Volhynian revival was the Rus’-Ukrainian nobleman, Kostiantyn Vasyl Ostrozky, reputed to be the wealthiest person in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, second only to the Polish king. Ostrozky established schools in several Volhynian towns; the best known, the Ostroh Academy (founded in 1576), became a bastion of Orthodoxy, with Greek as the language of instruction, with emphasis also on Latin and local Rus' culture. The college was renowned for its rich curriculum (including theology, philosophy, medicine, natural science, mathematics, astronomy, grammar, rhetoric, and logic) and choral singing. Ostrozky also founded a printing press in Ostroh, which operated from 1578 to 1612 and sponsored the publication of the Ostroh Bible (1581) — the first complete text of the Old and New Testaments and the first three books of the Maccabees in Church Slavonic, translated from the Greek by a group of Ostroh academy scholars. Following the establishment of a rival Jesuit college in Ostroh in 1624, the Ostroh Academy went into decline and was closed by 1636.\n\nOstrozky maintained close contact with other strong defenders of the Orthodox faith, such as the Lviv Dormition Brotherhood and the Orthodox Bishop of Lviv Hedeon Balaban. The brotherhoods (a centuries-old phenomenon of fraternities affiliated with individual churches) assumed a historical role by counteracting Polonization, Catholic (particularly Jesuit) expansion into Ukrainian lands, and later, conversions to the Uniate Church. The brotherhoods, whose members were predominantly burghers, acquired a secular character and often opposed the authoritarian and, at times, corrupt practices of the clergy. Ostrozky also had strong connections with Ukrainian Cossacks, for which he was condemned by the Polish nobility.\n\nThe synagogue was also known as the Turei Zahav synagogue in honour of Rabbi David ha-Levi Segal (1586-1667), whose most famous work, a commentary on Jewish law, was titled Turei Zahav (Pillars of Gold). By traditional convention, great rabbis are often referred to by the titles of their books rather than their given names.\n\nIn 1941, the German occupiers plundered the religious objects in the synagogue and in 1943 destroyed the building, leaving only remnants of the north wall. The remains of the synagogue, neglected for decades, were integrated into a Jewish memorial complex, the Space of Synagogues, in 2016.\n\nVarious developments had converged to bring about the Union of Brest, including the Turkish conquest of the seat of the patriarch of Constantinople in 1453, the creation of the Moscow patriarchate in 1589, and Protestant influences. Ruthenian supporters of the plan had also hoped to gain ecclesiastical benefits from the Union and an end to the Polonization of the Ruthenian upper classes. However, some Orthodox viewed it as a Polish ploy to impose Catholicism on the Eastern Christian Ukrainian populace. The influential Ukrainian nobleman, Kostiantyn Vasyl Ostrozky, who had played a central role in negotiating the agreement, later led the resistance to it.\n\nThe Union of Brest split the Ruthenian church and the faithful in two and led to a long and bitter domestic struggle. It also became a key issue in the political and social conflict between the Cossacks and the Poles and in the Pereiaslav Treaty of 1654 with Muscovy.\n\nAccording to recent scholarship, the early chronicles significantly overstated the number of Jewish victims and the extent of the devastation of communities. Some claim that Hannover adopted tropes and stories drawn from earlier literature on Jewish martyrology. Others have observed that his primary purpose was not only to chronicle the tragic events but also to inspire prayers for the martyrs and to gather aid for the refugees and the restoration of communities. Ultimately, the impact of the violence (and the chronicles) on Jewish memory has been deep and enduring. The events inspired liturgical compositions, an annual day of fasting (20th of the month of Sivan), and songs to commemorate the martyrs, including a Yiddish ballad composed in 1649, entitled \"The Misfortunes of the Holy Communities in the Land of Ukraine.\" Khmelnytsky is perceived very differently in Ukrainian historical memory.\n\nOther developments, however, undermined the status of the Orthodox Church in Ukraine. In 1686, the Orthodox Metropolitanate of Kyiv was made jurisdictionally subordinate to the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow instead of the ecumenical patriarch in Constantinople. By 1770, the title of the Metropolitan of Kyiv became largely honorific, following tsarist reforms that transformed the Orthodox Church into an instrument of the state. The process of subjecting the Orthodox Church to state interference had begun in 1721 when Tsar Peter I abolished the office of patriarch and replaced it with a collegium known as the Holy Synod, headed by a secular official (the Chief Procurator), who reported directly to the tsar.\n\nWritings by his disciples that describe his teachings make salient that his innovation lay in revitalizing traditional religious practice by infusing it with spirituality, the expression of joy in worship and daily living, the validation of common folk, and devotion to a charismatic spiritual leader (tzadik, or rebbe). As noted by the scholar Ada Rapoport-Albert: \"Hasidism… fused together two diametrically opposed poles of human experience: intensely personal, reclusive mystical flight from the world, and robust involvement in mundane human affairs.\"\n\nUkraine has been called the \"cradle of Hasidism\" because the movement originated in and flourished on Ukrainian lands. Its founders initially encountered fierce opposition from established rabbinic authorities (referred to as misnagdim or \"opponents\"), in particular from the venerated Gaon of Vilna. The strong negative reaction may be attributed in part to the Jewish world's traumatic experience with messianic pretenders and what was perceived as vulgarization of the Kabbalah, unseemly over-enthusiastic modes of worship, and the discounting of textual knowledge. However, the emergence of several charismatic Hasidic leaders with compelling yet reassuring messages paved the way for the eventual wide acceptance and spread of Hasidism across the Pale of Settlement and beyond. These leaders include Menahem Nahum of Chornobyl (1730–1797), Shneur Zalman of Liady (1745–1813), the founder of Chabad Hasidism, Levi Yitzhak of Berdychiv (1740–1810), and Nahman of Bratslav (1772–1810).\n\nAs a result of the disputations, the Frankists came to be treated as candidates for conversion to Catholicism. Frank and approximately 600 of his followers converted in Lviv with considerable fanfare immediately after the second disputation; over a thousand others converted the following year. However, it soon became apparent that Frank's conversion was part of a more grandiose messianic plan. Frank was arrested and convicted of heresy by a church tribunal in Warsaw and imprisoned in the monastery of Częstochowa, even as many of his followers entered the ranks of the Polish Catholic nobility."
