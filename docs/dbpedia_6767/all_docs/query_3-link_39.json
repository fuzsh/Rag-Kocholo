        "text": "It's safe to say there is zero potential of an Aly & AJ breakup.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with E! News, airing on March 22, Aly and AJ Michalka show just how in sync they are when it comes to their music career of almost two decades. When sharing the best part about working together as sisters, the pair says in unison, \"It's very unique.\"\n\n\"We finish each other's sentences,\" notes Aly, 33. \"It's unlike any other friendship [or] relationship you have in your life. A sibling is very sacred.\"\n\nShe continues, \"The fact that we were able share this space together for so many years and to have each other to lean on, to support each other, makes the ride so much better. We always talk about how we wouldn't be interested in doing this if we were solo artists.\"\n\nIn fact, the two, who have each carved their own paths as actors, are game to team up on screen as well. As AJ, 31, explains, \"If the right thing came or we developed something together that really felt like us and our bond was being portrayed correctly on screen—which I think is tricky actually to get right—I would definitely do it.\"\n\nAnd while their 2007 smash \"Potential Breakup Song\" remains a bop to this day, AJ tells E! News that she doesn't consider it \"the best\" pop anthem about a messy split. That title, she says, goes to \"Since U Been Gone\" by Kelly Clarkson.\n\nHow does Aly feel about that? As she told her younger sis, \"You literally just took it out of my mouth.\"\n\nFor more from Aly & AJ's interview, tune into E! News on March 22 at 11 p.m. on E!."
