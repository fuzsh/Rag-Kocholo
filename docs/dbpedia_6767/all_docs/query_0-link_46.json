        "text": "Aly Michalka is looking back on the day she found out she was pregnant.\n\nIF you didn’t know, the 35-year-old Aly & AJ singer and her husband Stephen Ringer revealed earlier this month that they had quietly welcomed their first child together, a son named Jack, in April.\n\nIn a new interview, Aly shared why she didn’t tell sister AJ Michalka that she was pregnant until a few days after she initially found out.\n\nKeep reading to find out more…Aly explained to Dr. Elliot Berlin on the Informed Pregnancy Podcast that she found that she was pregnant on the same day that she and AJ, 33, were going to perform one of their biggest shows of their career at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles.\n\n“I chose not to tell AJ because I really wanted her to be in the moment that evening,” Aly explained. “It was hard for me to be in the moment in a way because I was thinking of that while I was on stage.”\n\n“I also was waiting on our show and what was going on that evening, so I didn’t say anything to anybody,” she added.\n\nA few nights later, Aly and Stephen took AJ out to dinner to tell her the news and AJ was very excited to learn that she was going to be an aunt.\n\n“It was cool to find out in retrospect because that was such a big deal for us as a band to play that show and to be from L.A. and to have seen so many shows at the Greek,” Aly said, adding that it felt “cool” to realize that there was a baby with them on stage during one of the biggest nights of their lives."
