Along with her older sister, Aly, AJ began performing as a child, appearing in stage productions while honing her musical skills and working as a model in various ads. By her tween years, Michalka had made the transition to screen work, with recurring roles on the crime series \"The Guardian\" (CBS, 2001-04) and the sitcom \"Oliver Beene\" (Fox, 2003-04). In 2006, AJ and Aly made their Disney Channel debut in the TV movie \"Cow Belles\" and the following year, AJ took the lead in the MTV feature \"Super Sweet 16: The Movie,\" which also featured Aly. After some time away from features, Michalka returned with a small part in the Peter Jackson drama \"The Lovely Bones\" (2009) and starred in the short-lived cheerleading series \"Hellcats\" (The CW, 2010-11). In 2013, she portrayed the lead in the faith-leaning indie drama \"Grace Unplugged,\" a production that showcased both her acting and musical appeal.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n91% Support the Girls 81% Super 8 80% Weepah Way for Now\n\n64% Secretariat\n\n50% Grace Unplugged\n\n22% Angels in Stardust\n\nPhotos\n\nAJ Michalka at arrivals for Disney ABC Television Hosts: TCA Winter Press Tour 2019, The Langham Huntington, Pasadena, Pasadena, CA February 5, 2019.
