        "text": "Grace Trey, the daughter of one-hit-wonder, Johnny Trey, has a gift for singing. Having partnered with her dad for years in the church worship band, at 18, Grace longs to take her singing career a step further, maybe even someday living her dream of being like secular singing artist Renee Taylor.\n\nSo when Mossy, her father‚Äôs manager from the past approaches Johnny about recording a new album after all these years, Grace eavesdrops and can‚Äôt believe it when her dad rejects the idea. How can her father turn his back on an opportunity for him to return to the spotlight?\n\nBut Johnny Trey sees things differently. He‚Äôs not the same man he was during those days he sang his song ‚ÄúMisunderstood.‚Äù He‚Äôs no longer the man that could be found drunk and passed out and living for himself. No, Johnny has since found a greater purpose in his life. To follow Jesus and devote his life to Christ.\n\nGrace decides to contact Mossy about the singing opportunity, after all, what does she have to lose? This might finally be her chance to live out her dream. However, in the midst of her decision, she breaks her parents‚Äô hearts and turns her back on all she knows in her small Alabama town. Will the fame and fortune that is sure to follow be worth it? Will Grace also turn her back on the Lord? Will the temptation Grace finds herself in at every corner change her life forever?\n\nI was thrilled when Grace Unplugged came to my local theater. This is a story of love, sacrifice, loyalty, and second chances. It is a story of redemption, forgiveness, and the realization of what matters most in this life. There were lessons to be learned and tissues to be used.\n\nYes, I admit. I was the sniffling mom in the fifth to the last row. üôÇ\n\nMany discussion points abound in this movie, such as, devotion to the Lord, the change in our lives through Jesus‚Äô mercy and grace, teenage rebellion, resisting temptation, parenting concerns, and the darker side of stardom.\n\nIf you only see one movie this year, make it Grace Unplugged. While there are some issues for discussion, there is none of the typical ‚Äúfare‚Äù seen so often in Hollywood movies, such as language and violence.\n\nI highly recommend it for ages 12 and over.\n\nI am passionate about finding movies suitable for families.
