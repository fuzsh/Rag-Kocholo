        "text": "On August 17, Aly and AJ Michalka released \"Take Me\" Friday, their first single in ten years. Back then, the sister pop duo Alyson and Amanda Joy were a teen band signed with Disney's Hollywood Records. Their songs appeared in Disney movies, their album Insomniac peaked at 15 on the Billboard Top 200, the 2007 bop \"Potential Breakup Song\" was Time's 9th best song of the year. To put it bluntly, they'd made it. (Aly even was on the Disney Channel at one point, playing Keely Teslow on Phil of the Future from 2004 to 2006.)\n\nIn 2010, they left Disney's label and switched their band name to 78violet with plans to release music independently. That process was exhausting, to say the least. \"It was a combination [of] the music business tiring us out and being young, and our love for acting,\" Aly, now 28-years-old, tells ELLE.com. \"We wanted to do projects that didn't involve the two of us. Over time we realized making records without any sort of label support [or label funding] is really difficult. It ended up taking more time than we originally thought, but we also didn't think it was going to be as hard as it was. That sort of crushed us, and we had to go back to square one.\"\n\nSo they switched to acting solelyâ€”Aly currently plays Peyton Charles on iZombie; AJ (who's now 26) plays Lainey Lewis on The Goldbergs. But then, in January 2016 in a break between between shows, a shared love for music called them back. \"My husband [Stephen Ringer] encouraged us to come back to music,\" Aly says. \"He saw us singing and writing round the house so he encouraged us to get back out there and write music and perform...[Finally] we just said, 'Okay, let's give this one last go.'\" They tapped their good friend, producer and songwriter Mike Elizondo, who they had written music with in the past, and got the ball rolling.\n\n\"Take Me\" (and the four-song EP to come before a full album release in 2018) is a far cry from the old Aly & AJ, the girls say. \"The music we were writing then was based on fictional relationships,\" Aly explains. \"We were thirteen and fifteen, we were writing with zero experience. Now that I'm married, and we've each had many relationships and heartbreaks, we're coming at songwriting at a much different way.\"\n\nHere, the two talk to ELLE.com about the inspiration behind their new sound, dealing with Disney fame when they were younger, the possibility of a Phil of the Future reunion, and what's next.\n\nYour lyrics aren't the only thing that's changed. What inspired the new sound?\n\nAJ: What was inspiring us musically, but also what came naturally. Going to the studio, we promised ourselves we would go with what came out. And that's really hard to do. Most of the time you're writing for radio, you're writing for a label, you're writing to stick a hit, and you end up coming out with something that isn't necessarily genuine.\n\nWe were comforted that we were coming out with something that was original and felt like us. It wasn't formulated for anyone else or pop radio. It was exactly how we wrote.\n\nWhat inspired your first single, \"Take Me\"?\n\nAJ: \"Take Me\" [is] not based on anyone or anything in particular. It's more something that Aly and I were feeling at the time. I was a little frustrated going through the dating scene. I started experimenting on a dating app that a friend told me to go on, and I realized quickly that any match I came across, it was like, \"Cool, we'll continue to message on here but nothing will get set in stone.\"\n\n\"In the age of social media and dating apps, so many people are able to hide behind their Instagram page or their Raya page or Facebook.\" â€”AJ\n\nIn the age of social media and dating apps, so many people are able to hide behind their Instagram page or their Raya page or Facebook. And it's like, \"Let's set something up! I want to meet face-to-face.\" And \"Take Me\" was about, \"Are you going to take me out? Do I have to be the first person to make the move?\" And in this era, women can be the first person to make the move, but it's not usually how Aly and I roll romantically. I was writing a song that was more of a demand. \"You're going to do this, if it works, it works, but I'm not going to be the first one to step out.\"\n\nHow many songs have you worked on so far?\n\nAJ: We've written and demoed [about] 18 songs. We have a lot of material, but we're not done. Aly and I plan on continuing to write and bring in other co-writers. And from there, narrow down [from] 30. What are the top ten we want to put on this record [that]'ll come out next year?\n\nWhat kind of message do you hope fans take from your new music?\n\nAJ: I hope they're inspired or moved in some way. Music is entertainment, but I would like to be able to inspire the audience in a way [that makes them] leave, saying, \"Wow, I just left with something I didn't have before going into this concert.\" I hope that people can leave either a live show or listening to our record with a sense of peace, where [the music] was a moment of escape.\n\nAre there plans for a tour?\n\nAly: Our goal is to release a full record and support it by touring in the States ad internationally once I'm finished with my commitment to iZombie in the early spring. But that's the ultimate [goal]: Creating in the studio setting and then performing in an incredibly public setting.\n\nWhat was it like transitioning out of Disney, childhood fame into adult roles and music?\n\nAJ: It's about choosing wisely and that's not an easy thing to do. We had to transition as musicians and actors from kids to adults. Surrounding yourself with a great team that is really discerning and not pushing or rushing into a certain direction that doesn't seem like a progressive flow is really important.\n\n\"I don't think we've been given the opportunity to prove ourselves in a role that completely breaks out from the past.\" â€”AJ\n\nAly and I have chosen some projects really wisely, but I don't think we've been given the opportunity to prove ourselves in a role that completely breaks out from the past. I think that's around the corner, and I have a feeling it's going to happen when the music comes out. We love the shows we're on, and we're definitely passionate about acting, but at the end of the day, our work on stage together is what's really important.\n\nWhat was it like dealing with stardom at such a young age?\n\nAJ: I don't think we were [in the] mega stardom field, but I do know that our music had done well enough that Aly and I were recognized on a day-to-day basis, especially if we were together. You deal with constant scrutiny, and people who know your business too intimately who shouldn't. As a kid, it can be overwhelming and frightening.\n\n\"Had we been bigger at that age, it can be really freaky and possibly damaging.\" â€”AJ\n\nNow that we're older, I feel safer. I know how to handle it better. Had we been bigger at that age, it can be really freaky and possibly damaging. I'm glad we didn't experience Taylor Swift-level fame because I don't know how that would work. Thankfully we had each other; I can't imagine it as a solo artist. [Even] growing up with super-normal parents and a solid team around us, being under the microscope is definitely a weird way to grow up.\n\nAly: AJ and I had each other, which was really helpful. Most people don't have a sibling in the business. We were lucky to handle it together.\n\nAly and AJ at the\n\nWhat's your favorite song either upcoming or in the past?\n\nAly: We're really proud of \"Take Me.\" It's the best interpretation of our new sound and direction. And in the past I'm really proud of \"Flattery,\" off Insomniac.\n\nAJ: I feel bonded to \"Take Me.\" I'm proud of it. It's empowering and at the end of the day, it's a pretty solid pop hit.\n\nI still feel really close to old music like \"Division\" and \"Closure.\" There was something about playing those songs live that was really fulfilling.\n\nAly, do you still talk your Phil Of the Future cast-mates?\n\nAly: I'm really good friends with one of the producers who directed and wrote a lot of the episodes; I've been close to him since I was fourteen. Raviv [Ullman, who played Phil] and I keep in touch; we're Instagram buddies. Whenever I'm in New York or he's in LA, we try to see each other and get lunch.\n\nWould you ever be open to a reunion?\n\nAly: I mean, sure! I guess reunions are a big thing now. I wouldn't be opposed to it. It's a funny idea. I have no idea what they'd do necessarily with the storyline, but yeah, sure."
