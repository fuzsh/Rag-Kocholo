        "text": "(upbeat music)\n\n[Woman] And you look on that top one Wait a second...\n\nOkay\n\n(camera shutters)\n\nThe talent I would most like to have would be\n\nperfect memory.\n\nReally? Literally\n\nbeing able to remember every single...\n\nIs that a talent or a super\n\nhero power?\n\nMy greatest fear is...\n\nDeath by fire.\n\nGeez.\n\nYeah.\n\nGetting dark.\n\nI know, sorry.\n\nThe words and phrases I most overuse are\n\nlegit.\n\nOh you do.\n\n[AJ] Too much.\n\nI am sitting here with Aly and AJ Michalka\n\nwho are here to talk about a lot of things.\n\nTheir new band, their new album, coming up,\n\ntheir acting career, their life,\n\nand their mother who was an NFL cheerleader\n\nwho in another life (Aly and AJ laugh)\n\nthat's what I wanna be.\n\nDid you guys cheer at all in high school\n\nor did you do any of that?\n\nWe were homeschooled from sixth grade on\n\nso AJ was in fourth, I was in sixth.\n\nAnd I mean, our afterschool activities kinda consisted of\n\npiano lessons, music class, acting class.\n\nWhat's it like being homeschooled?\n\nI think that it's right for certain kids.\n\nThere is that cliche of the homeschool kid who's\n\nhiding under a rock.\n\nThat's like a weirdo-- But I think if you have that\n\npersonality and you're really shy,\n\nit's not the best.\n\nYeah.\n\nWay for you to get an education (mumbles)\n\nWhat was the decision to do it,\n\nwere you working at the time?\n\nFor us it's just hours of homework that was\n\nso unnecessary that my mom kept asking,\n\nwhat are you guys do in school?\n\nI'm so confused.\n\nYou go to school for six-seven hours and then\n\nyou come back with four hours of homework.\n\nThis is ridiculous.\n\nShe just wanted so bad to have those kids that\n\ncould just come home and do a little bit of homework\n\nand then cook a home cooked meal and the kids\n\ncould take a bath, and the family could watch a movie\n\nafter, and we didn't get that.\n\nUntil we were homeschooled.\n\nYou aren't necessarily my demographic.\n\nI didn't know about when you're doing the soundtrack\n\nfor High School Musical, and your albums\n\nhave gone platinum, but doing my homework on you two,\n\nit is staggering.\n\nI mean, you wrote your own music at such a young age.\n\nYou guys were Aly and AJ, that was your show.\n\nAnd you kinda came up through Hollywood Records\n\nwhich was owned by Disney.\n\nHow was that navigating through the Disney system?\n\nThrough the synergy of the channel and through\n\nRadio Disney, and through just that cross-promotion,\n\nthey were able to really get a huge fan base\n\nfollowing us.\n\nAs we got older and we grew up, it became a little bit more\n\ndifficult because we started becoming older women.\n\nAnd we had a different sense of taste than we did\n\nat the beginning.\n\nAnd I think that that is when it became a little of\n\na struggle.\n\nJust felt like we had outgrown where we were.\n\nAnd I think that they really truly understood that\n\nat the end of the day, and that's why\n\nwe ended up parting ways.\n\nI really like that we got out when we did,\n\nbecause I think if we had been there any longer,\n\nI think that we would've been putting up music\n\nthat we never really truly have our heart in.\n\nAlice and Amanda, that's who we are as people.\n\nAly and AJ Michalka, sure that's who we are as actors.\n\nBut when it comes to being a band,\n\n78Violet kinda represents our music\n\nand us as individuals.\n\n[Krista] How'd you come up with it?\n\n78 actually stands for platinum,\n\nand it really represents our relationship as sisters,\n\nwhich is cool, it's non corrodable, it's\n\na material that can't be tarnished.\n\nAnd violet has always been this, really royal\n\nspiritual color for us, that's kind of\n\nfollowed us in every home and on walls\n\nand so together we just figured that that was a really\n\nkind of personal power--\n\nWe just linked them together and then we thought\n\nokay, maybe that's it.\n\nNot only do we work together everyday, but we are\n\nable to enjoy each other\n\nwhen we come home in the same house.\n\nSo it's nice, we have our own little rooms,\n\nand our own areas and we try not to\n\nshare every single life moment together\n\n'cause I think it's more special when you can\n\nhave that separation\n\nand then come together at the end of the day\n\nbut I do, I love working with Aly,\n\nshe's such a smart, creative person,\n\nand we've gone through a lot together\n\nwhich has been really cool.\n\n(film reel spinning)\n\n[Both Aly and AJ] Idea of perfect happiness.\n\nFamily.\n\nYeah.\n\nA solid family--\n\nI would say having family, having kids,\n\nhaving a husband.\n\nI consider my greatest achievement to be\n\nsisterhood.\n\nYeah! Yay!\n\nWoohoo!\n\nAnd performing at the White House.\n\nYeah, that's pretty cool.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat's legit.\n\n(film reel spinning)\n\n(lounge music)"
