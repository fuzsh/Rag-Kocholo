Prevention and Control

Prevention

As Z. mauritiana is only likely to be introduced intentionally, there are no recorded prevention methods, other than those in place in Australia and the Pacific, where high risk results were obtained from weed risk assessments (PIER, 2007).

Public awareness

A number of publications have been prepared in Queensland, Northern Territories and Western Australia to inform land owners of their legal requirements regarding the detection and control of Z. mauritiana on private land.

Eradication

The only record of eradication of Z. mauritiana is from Israel, soon after the initial introduction of six plants from Malaysia in 1939 (Morton, 1987). However, the reason for eradication was because of high rates of fruit fly infection and not due to Z. mauritiana being an invasive species.

Containment/zoning

Land owners in Queensland, Australia are requested to consider containment of Z. mauritiana if eradication is not possible (Land Protection, 2006).

Control

Cultural control and sanitary measures

Z. mauritiana plants are able to survive after fire because of vigorous vegetative regeneration from root suckers (Weber, 2003). According to Grice (1997), only 10% of Z. mauritiana plants were killed by a single dry season fire in Australia, and within 4 months there was no significant difference in the occurrence of individuals between burned and unburned areas. As cattle are the main seed vector for Z. mauritiana in northern Australia, the prevention of cattle movement between infested and uninfested pasture has been an important cultural approach to controlling the spread of this plant (Grice, 1998).

Physical/mechanical control

Grice et al. (1999) suggest that removal of entire plants is the most effective means of control. Cutting, combined with digging out all roots, is suitable for isolated plants, but larger groups require a combination of felling and herbicide application to prevent regrowth (Weber, 2003). Grice (1998) comments on the expense of mechanical techniques, as simple top killing methods are inadequate. In Queensland, Australia, mechanical control combined with basal herbicide treatment of the cut stumps is suggested for adult trees (Land Protection, 2006).

Movement control

Recent publications that promote Z. mauritiana as a potential crop for dry areas, such as Azam-Ali et al. (2006), make no mention of its potential as an invasive species, and thus international movements are not restricted, with the exception of those in the Pacific, where new introductions are not recommended following a high risk score in a weed risk assessment (PIER, 2007). Movement of Z. mauritiana is restricted by law in Australia due to its declared noxious weed status.

Biological control

No information is available on any biological control methods attempted on this species.

Chemical Control

Due to the variable regulations around (de-)registration of pesticides, we are for the moment not including any specific chemical control recommendations. For further information, we recommend you visit the following resources:
