Please help me identifying this edible Ziziphus tree. The fruits are devoured by birds and its eaten by humans too, owing to fleshy-crunchy mesocarp. Could this be Z.jujube?

Fruit: 5 cm long

Habitat: roadside

Alt.: 310 m asl

Date: 21.01.2018

Place: Jammu (outskirts, rural), J & K

Is there a possibility of this being a variety of Z.mauritiana? because the larger leaves and oblong fruits make me think that this is not the common Z.mauritiana.

Quite possible.

Looks matching as suggested.

Now accepted name is Ziziphus jujuba Mill.

Correct name of our plant is Zizyphus mauritiana Lam., Encycl. 3: 319 319 . (Syn. Ziziphus jujuba Lam. (non Mill, 1768));

Ziziphus ziziphus can‚Äôt be a correct name as it is a tautonym. The Indian Ber is more commonly named as Z. mauritiana Lamk. (syn: Z. jujuba (L.) Lamk.) distinct from Z. jujuba Mill.

Thank you Sir for throwing lights on the correct scientific name of the Indian Ber tree. I am wondering if we have the Z. jujuba Mill. here. How do i differentiate one from the other?

Z. jujuba Mill. is Chinese jujube or Chinese date, mainly a temperate species, with leaves glabrous beneath, longer stipular spine up to 3 cm long, petiole shorter than 5 mm and glabrous, fruit ovoid or oblong 2-3.5 cm long

Z. mauritiana is Indian jujube or Indian plum is mainly a species of warmer climates, leaves tomentose beneath, longer stipular spine 5-7 mm long, petiole 5-15 mm long and tomentose. It has two varieties the cultivated var.mauritiana a tree with 6-9 cm long leaves and ovoid 2.5-3.5 cm long fruit and var. spontanea (Edgew.) R.R. Stewart ex Qaiser & Nazim, a wild shrub with 2-3 cm long leaves and globose 1-1.5 cm long fruits.

Tussar Silk Moths on an Indian Jujube tree:

Thought this might be interesting‚Ä¶..

Was at my property at Shahapur [north of Bombay] last Sunday. These photographs were taken on a Ziziphus mauritiana [Bor] tree.

Tussar Silk Moths belong to the group of Emperor Moths which feature some of the larger moths including the largest ‚Äì the Atlas Moth, my photographs of which are available at this link

Here a female Tussar Silk Moth [the largest of the 3 seen in the photographs] has recently emerged from her cocoon loaded with unfertilised eggs. To attract males to fertilise her eggs, she secretes pheromones which the males detect with their sensitive feathery antennae from even a few kilometers away. Two males have arrived to mate with her.

Also seen is the nest of a Scaly-breasted Munia.

Query :: specific epithet (based on geographical name) :: mauritian : 18 posts by 6 authors.

While compiling names of Ipomoea mauritiana Jacq. and Ziziphus mauritiana Lam.

‚Äì want to make sure that mauritiana is of or from: Mauritania (country in w Africa) AND not to be confused with Mauritius (island in Indian Ocean)

Ipomoea mauritiana has:

1) one name ‚Äì Mauritanian convolvulus ‚Ä¶ NPGS / GRIN

2) its origins ‚Ä¶ uncertain, but it has been recorded in West Africa, including in Gambia and the riparian forests of Benin ‚Ä¶ Wikipedia

Both Gambia and Benin are neighbouring countries of Mauritania.

BUT when looking up for Ziziphus mauritiana, do not find it pertaining in any way to Mauritania (nor Mauritius).

Can someone help me ?

By the way, this query arose on finding some of the sites and reference books relating mauritiana to Mauritius.

Mauritius was under French rule during the period when this fruit was described by Lamarck who was also French. Hence Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. should be based on Mauritius.

Ipomoea mauritiana was described by Jacquin who again was a French and worked in South Africa too. I assume both name comes from Mauritius.

Logically Mauritania should have been changed to latin as Mauritaniana!!

‚Ä¶ many thanks your thoughts; it helped me know mauritiana is based on Mauritius.

‚ÄúLogically Mauritania should have been changed to latin as Mauritaniana‚Äù ‚Ä¶ is the logic true in case of Mauritius? üôÇ

What I found:

This species was first described by the French biologist J. B. Lamarck, from a specimen in a botanical garden in Paris, but he did not state why he decided to name it after Mauritius Island. ‚Ä¶ Wildflowers of Israel.

Ipomoea mauritiana has following names:

1) Mauritanian convolvulus ‚Ä¶ NPGS / GRIN

2) Mauritiana Morning Glory ‚Ä¶ Plantilus ‚Ä¶ though Mauritiana here is just the epithet, not name of any place in world.

and,

mauritiana => refers to ancient Mauritania ‚Ä¶ V I R B O G A

however,

Type Specimens

T: ; ; Cultivated in Vienna from material collected in Mauritius ‚Ä¶ Tropicos

Thanks once again ‚Ä¶ taking it as based on Mauritius.

Sir Lamarck didnt colelct all plants from wild. People colelcted from different parts of the world and were transfered to Paris during French rule. Same as Linnaeus who never came to India but described plants from India. And same as Jacquin.

Dont mind my collect please. I am trying to find the second protologue !!! cant find anywhere‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

indeed some authors described plants far from where the plants were found.

The gist of my query is knowing the place(s) on which the epithet mauritiana is based.

While I was attempting to find it on the internet, I got mixed results and got confused.

Now your thoughts helped me somewhat convinced that the epithet is based on Mauritius.

It actually doesnt state anything from where it went to Lamarck. Interestingly the first sentence says, Isle of France‚Ä¶. I imagine which Island it point towards!!!

Many many thanks dear ‚Ä¶

At least mention of ‚Äúisle‚Äù of France.

While Mauritius is, Mauritania is not.

I hope we have similar clarification for Ipomoea mauritiana.

You may dig only during leisure.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius

Please check this. It mentions that ‚ÄúIn 1598 a Dutch squadron under AdmiralWybrand Van Warwyck landed at Grand Port and named the island Mauritius, in honour of Prince Maurice van Nassau, stadhouder of the

Dutch Republic. Later the island became a French colony and was renamed Isle de France.‚Äù

WOW ‚Ä¶. Excellent search. Thank you very very much. Thus epithet of Ziziphus mauritiana is very well confirmed to be based on Mauritius.

A check on epithet of Ipomoea mauritiana to have some relation to Mauritius would be fantastic. Please help at your leisure.

It is interesting to read the discussions. Some unknown facts emerge‚Ä¶.

Have attached a relevant paper by the French botanist Louis Bouton (1799 ‚Äì 1878) who worked extensively in Mauritius. It was published in William Jackson Hooker‚Äôs Journal of Botany, vol. I, in 1834. In his concluding remarks on the last page, he inferred that the name mauritiana is incorrect because no plant of the genus Ziziphus is indigenous to Mauritius.

Thanks for sharing the article.

Just because a plant is not originally from a place on which the name is described, as in this case, Z. mauritiana not being originally from Mauritius, doesnt make the species epithet incorrect according to

ICBN, now called as ICN. Yes the only thing incorrect is the interpretation that it is indigenous to Mauritius. Same thing goes to all species named as indica or chinensis doesnt mean that it is indigenous to India or China. The species epithet just means that the plant was described from Mauritius or India or China.

Supporting to ‚Ä¶ on the issue of specific epithet. Some times, it make no sense, as in the case of Thunbergia frangrans (it doesnt has fragrant flowers). Mauritiana also one of such mistakes!!

Thanks ‚Ä¶ for adding more clarifications to this query.

Hoping we get to know how the epithet fits in case of Ipomoea mauritiana whose origin / nativity is obscure (ref: Flora of China) ‚Ä¶ note in Wikipedia says: Its origins are uncertain, but it has been recorded in West Africa, including in Gambia and the riparian forests of Benin.

Plant1 doesn‚Äôt bear any flower, while few flowers can be seen in Plant2.

The leaves of ‚Äúplant1‚Äù is completely glabrous on both side / the leaves of ‚Äúplant2‚Äù is silky pubescent underside

flowers of ‚Äúplant2‚Äù are not peduncled

both the plants have two types of spines

I think both the plants are same, the younger one having glabrous leaves on both side, and the older one having pubescence on underside.

Key, based on petiole length and spine length, in efi thread and in http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=135333#KEY-1-6 suggests this is Z. jujulba Mill. But these flowers have 10-lobed disk (pic ‚Äì plant2__P1060498).

Native to: south Asia (mainly India)

-This is called ‚Äútopa Kul‚Äù in Bengali found mainly growing in the spring months in Bengal.

-If you notice properly in the first pic of ‚Ä¶, you can see that in one flower all anthers are pointed upwards where as in othertwo the anthers are pointed downwards and backwards.There are phenomena in plants called HERKOGAMY [Herkogamy is a commonstrategy employed by hermaphroditic angiosperms to reduce sexual

interference between male (anthers) and female (stigma) function. ] and DICHOGAMY [Dichogamy, also known as sequential hermaphrodism, is the separation in time of gender expression in a hermaphroditic organism. In the context of the plant sexuality of flowering plants (angiosperms), there are two forms of dichogamy: protogyny‚Äîfemale function precedes male function‚Äîand protandry‚Äî male function precedes female function.] .

Zizyphus had protoandrous flowers, i.e., androecium develops to maturity first and after sometime gynoecium attains maturity, in simple words, there is a distinct delineation of male and female phase in the same flower as both anther and stigma dont mature at one time hence inhibiting self pollination.

In the flower above, the anthers mature first (during erect position as in the picture, which has white pollens on the anthers] but stigma remains immature, hence the insect will come collect pollens from the erect anthers but pollens wont be able to get deposited on the stigma of the same plant because the stigma will not be mature enough to let the pollen stick to it. Hence if and when the insect will visit another flower which has mature stigma, pollen gets deposited. In other words, pollen from one flower is avoided from getting deposited on the stigma of the same flower.

There are some other terms here which are useful: Geitonogamy: In this pollination of a flower with the pollen from another flower on the same flowering plant.

Xenogamy: In this pollination of a flower takes place by pollens from a different plant .

could you please help me to identify this tree for seasonwatch?

Its very twiggy at base and leaves cover only the top. But it seems to be a

to me it look like Z. mauritiana

It is Ziziphus mauritiana (= Z. jujuba) of Rhamnaceae family. Called as ‚Äòilandhai‚Äô ‡Æá‡Æ≤‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Øà in Tamil.

The fruits are edible (but beware of large, stone-like seed :).

Ziziphus jujuba Mill is not synonym of Ziziphus mauritiana as per theplantlist.org

pls see http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-2470699

To me this tree is BER

Ziziphus jujuba

During our Pre Commissioned Training in OTA Kamptee (Nagpur) its fruits were the only thing available to us to eat during short breaks. More than 10 varities of BER were there. These were the main food of Monkeys and Langoors residing there.

Perheps attached key from eflora.org may help

But I meant Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. for which *Z. jujuba* (L.) Gaertn. is a synonym, as per GRIN.

Please check http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?42285

Here are some contrdictions in theplantlist and GRIN

Does the plant has thorns? If the tree is unarmed (no thorns) then it is Z. glabrata and if the tree is armed then it is Z. mauritiana (Syn. jujuba). ( We have to clarify the contradiction on the synonym). I couldnt see thorns

in the branch close up picture hence I reached a conclusion that it could be Z. glabrata (Z. trinervia). Please see the attachment.

According to the plant list there are 2 genus; Zyzyphus and Ziziphus (http://www.theplantlist.org/browse/A/Rhamnaceae/) in Rhamnacae family jujuba kept under Ziziphus whereas, mauritiana kept under Zizyphus. Both are accepted as well. Any one has any clarification on this?

Let us not banish ‚ÄòThe Plant List‚Äô like that. It is for the first time we have complete list of all plant species with accepted names and synonyms. Agreed, there are still a large list of unresolved names and few controversial conclusions, but I think trained taxonomists can sort these out, and moreover, the list is being continuous improved and we may have improved version soon.

I agree ‚Ä¶ that we shouldn‚Äôt completely depend on the plant list. But, as ‚Ä¶ pointed out that is a great effort and we cannot totally ignore the same. I had gone through what ever literature available in our library and got to know that Z. mauritiana has stipular thorns whereas, Z. glabrata doesn‚Äôt have hence I reached my conclusion.

To clarify, the contradiction on synonym I referred the same flora books from our library and most of the flora says Z. jujuba is a synonym of Z.mauritiana (Flowering Plants; Biodiversity Documentation for Kerala,

Sasidharan KFRI, 2004 & Flowering Plants of Kerala, India, Nayar, T S et al (TBGRI), 2006 ).

I had mentioned the link for The plant list because that is the* *best source available online now ( I proudly make a statement that when we compile our data ours would be certainly become the best source of flora reference online). The plant list is compiling by a group of taxonomists who are working from leading botanical gardens in different parts of the world, including Kew Botanical Garden where herbaria from world around is kept and well maintained for a long time, I believe. Further, I beleive that they are updating the database with several new publications.

If we feel that there are contradictions or corrections let us write them.

Ziziphus jujuba is a classical example of later homonymy often cited in the text books.

The common Indian Ber plant, Chinese-date or Indian jujube was first described by Linnaeus under the name Rhamnus jujuba a species with leaves glabrous above and velvety beneath. Linnaeus also described Rhamnus ziziphus a species with leaves having glabrous under surface, As it turned out to be Millers (1768) gave the name Ziziphus jujuba for this species, so that when Gaertn. (1788) or Lamarck (1789) made the combination Ziziphus jujuba based on Rhamnus jujuba of Linnaeus, it turned out to be a later homonym of a different species Z. jujuba Mill. The name Z. jujuba (L.) Gaertn. or (L.) Lam. for Indian Jujube had to be rejected and next available name Z. mauritiana Lam., continued to be used for this species.

Agreed The Plant List does not list Z. mauritiana but lists both Rhamnus ziziphus L. as well as Rhamnus jujuba L. as synonyms of Ziziphus jujuba Mill., implying that latest (2010) taxonomic judgement treats the two species as synonyms. We may like it or not the whole World is going to follow this List, and I think we have no choice.

Thank you sir for the detailed clarification.

But the plant list have listed Z. mauritiana in the list, but as I have mentioned earlier the spelling is different for the genus ( http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/tro-50137113) here it is Zizyphus and then they mention that Zizyphus mauritiana doesn‚Äôt have any synonym. Further, there is yet another genus with a spelling Ziziphus in which they have included jujuba as Ziziphus jujuba with R. jujuba and R. zizyphus as synonym (http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-2470699).

Zizyphus is perhaps biggest goof up by The Plant List. Ziziphus and Zizyphus are same genus with correct spellings as Ziziphus now. Perhaps we will have to write to them about these mistakes.

The bark of this tree has irregular cracks on almost black trunk. After seeing this mail I read the account of Zizyphus/Ziziphus jujuba. it says jujuba has irregular cracks on almos black trunk.

I never said that ignore The Plant List, no doubt they are doing the best they can do for the biodiversity of the plants of the world. I like the statement by .. written few days back that get the correct knowledge

from wherever you get.

I just wanted all of us to refer the literature and herbariums too, instead just depending on The Plant List.

I also feel that there should be some Indian Taxonomists Group on The Plant List group to deal with Indian Plants.

Thanks Dear ‚Ä¶ for sharing yr views. What i understand is that there are two things, one is the plant list and second one is the regional flora.

I would like to share one of my observation w.r.t. Ehretia sp..

While we were discussing Ehretia sp. posted by ‚Ä¶, ‚Ä¶. has mentioned that ‚ÄúKew Plant List treats E. aspera as synonym of E. laevis‚Äú.

Where as ‚ÄúFlora of Bombay‚Äì T.Cooke‚Äù treats these 2 differently, Ehretia laevis as E.laevis Roxb. and Ehretia aspera as E.aspera Roxb. Flora has also provided the keys for both.

So my understanding is, along with plant list, regional floras should also be reffered and it becomes all the more necessay when we are reffereing to some endemic sp.

Early flowering and fruiting of Ziziphus mauritiana was noticed during Oct. and November, from NBNP Garden, Anaikatti, Coimbatore.

Usual season will be during summer (March to June). Any thought about the unusual flowering?

Is this Zizyphus mauritiana:

Is this Zizyphus mauritiana or different variety? Pl confirm

Fruits will be like this.

Affirmative. This is Bor / Ber [Z. mauritiana] often seen with Tussar Silk moth cocoons.

Sunday Special : Common Pierrot Butterfly on Ziziphus sp.:

I was musing over an idea of starting a new series ‚Äì ‚ÄúSunday Special‚Äù. This can be anything and everything. We can share our views, ideas, experience‚Ä¶. whatever you and i would like to share. Here i go‚Ä¶

Yesterday i was on my way to school, as usual, left home at 8.30, boarded the train at 8.45, got down at the next station in order to catch another train that would take me 25 km more. As i was about to move to another platform, using a overbridge, i found a number of wild climbers beside the platform. And there was some other herbs, seedlings of shrubs, even trees too. This is monsoon, a few drops here and there, as you know rain is eluding us this year. But those few drops are enough to create excitements in seeds and saplings. What the Rhinos said in the ‚ÄúIce Age‚Äù? ‚ÄúTender shoot‚Äù?

Well, here i go to catch another train, the train will be coming in within a minute‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ B U T‚Ä¶. W H A T‚Ä¶ I S‚Ä¶ T H A T ? A Common Pierrot !!!‚Ä¶ and on Ziziphus sp. !!! Laying !!! Egg !!! Resting !!!

Well, friends, i missed the train, waited for another 15 minutes to catch the next train.

Any idea ? : 6 posts by 3 authors. Attachments (2) ‚Äì 2 mb each.

Gwalior Fort, january 2020, wild ? Calophyllum, Garcinia ?

Ziziphus only ‚Ä¶, Check with Z.mauritania,

Thank you ! I had seen the Ziziphus sp. but i did not have a precise enough image.

Z.mauritania seems to fit.

Was it a tree ?

Rather shrub.

I think a big one, from the image.

Can you advise the ID?

Thanks very much, ‚Ä¶, for the Nepali names of this plant.

Nepali names ok for Z. mauritania, but the ID of this sp. need to be confirmed according to ‚Ä¶

For me the id is Ok as per images at

There may be variations as it is being cultivated and improved for market sales.
