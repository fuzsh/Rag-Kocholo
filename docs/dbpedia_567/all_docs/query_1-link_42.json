Three species of which are new records for the Java region, among others; Ziziphus celtidifolia DC., Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. and Ziziphus spina-christi (L.) Desf. Phenetic analysis based on morphological characteristics showed that Ziziphus in Java had 52% - 81% similarity.\n\nKeywords: Java, morphological, variations, Ziziphus\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/359598430_Morphological_Variations_Species_of_Ziziphus_Rhamnaceae_in_Java"
