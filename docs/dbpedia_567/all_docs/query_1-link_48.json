The aqueous and ethanolic Ziziphus mauritiana formulations were shown to have analgesic, antipyretic, potent analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-emetic properties.\n\nAims & Objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate the sedative and anticonvulsant activities of Ziziphus mauritiana extract by governing 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight orally.\n\nMaterials and Methods: The leaves are extracted with ethanol and lukewarm water with a soxhlet apparatus for 72 hours. After that acute extract toxicity study was performed and then locomotor activity, pentobarbital induced sleeping time and anticonvulsant activity were performed with the extract.\n\nResults: Oral administration of extract at dosages of 200 & 400 mg/kg was employed after an immediate toxicity test. At a dosage of 400 mg/kg, the number of locomotions was reduced significantly lengthened the period of time spent sleeping and there was showed a dosage-dependent reduction in all phases of an epileptic episode."
