        "text": "The ber (Ziziphus mauritiana Lamarck) is an important fruit crop grown in arid and semi arid regions of India and elsewhere. Nutritionally, the fruits are rich in protein, phosphorus, calcium, carotene and vitamin C. In India, productivity tends to be low because of various biotic stresses such as pests and diseases. Of the various insect pests infesting ber, the stone weevil Aubeus himalayanus Voss (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a new threat to ber cultivation in India. This was recorded as a new pest of ber in India for the first time in the state of Andhra Pradesh in 1994. Serious attacks were later reported in Rahuri, Maharashtra and Jobner, in 1996, and in Karnataka during 1998. Recently, infestations of this pest were reported in Bikaner and Rajasthan in 2010 and in Bangladesh in 2009. The females lay their eggs on the stylar end of fruits, or rarely on the distal end. The newly emerged white coloured grubs enter the seeds by making a puncture in the endocarp of the immature fruits, and starts feeding on the soft seed coat. Later it enters the endosperm, feeds on it, and pupates within the seed. The weevil completes its life within a single fruit. The infestation results in severe fruit drop at the initial stage of fruit set. The damage intensity of the stone weevil varies with cultivars; stoned varieties are preferred more than the pulp rich varieties. Periodical monitoring of orchards for weevil incidence is essential for timely implementation of control strategies. Delayed detection makes management difficult as they enter the seed.\n\nBer fruit fly, Carpomyia vesuviana Costa (Tephritidae: Diptera) is one of the notorious monophagous pests of ber in India, Pakistan and Middle East countries. The fly infest most of the Ziziphus species grown in the world and cause the damage internally and in serious case it causes severe yield loss up to 80% or even upto 100% damage. The external temperature, relative humidity and rainfall and soil moisture, soil temperature and soil depth are found to be critical factors for the activity and the adult fly emergence from soil. The favourable temperature for pupal development and adult emergence is 30°C, pupation at 3 to 6 cm depth of soil was ideal for adult emergence. Alternating rainfall ranging from 20 to 40 mm and 62 to 85% relative humidity also promotes fly activity. Prophylactic measures are the essential components for the successful management of C. vesuviana. Field sanitation, destruction of wild bushes, collection of infested fruits and summer ploughing to expose the overwintering pupa to hot summer breaks the reproduction cycle of fly. Growing of resistant cultivars like Tikidi, Umran, Mundia, Banarasi, Sanaur-1, Safeda selection, Illaiciihi, Mirchia, Zg-3 and Chhuhara would give better yield and also reduces the protection cost. However, synthetic chemicals are presently employed as major tools against fruit fly, organophosphate and synthetic pyrethroid insecticides are in extensive use. Availability of potential biocontrol agents and botanic pesticides are very limited. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate the all available tactics in integrated manner and incorporation of neem based formulations and biological pesticide, spinosad, bait application, male annihilation technique are essential to manage the C. vesuviana in a successful manner in the scenario of organic cultivation.\n\nPlants are persistently confronted to both abiotic and biotic stresses that drastically reduce their productivity. Plant responses to these stresses are multifaceted and involve copious Biochemical, physiological, molecular, molecular and cellular adaptations. Recent evidence shows that simultaneous occurrence of abiotic and biotic stress can have a positive effect on plant performance by reducing the susceptibility to biotic stress which is a positive sign for arid horticulture crops. Some of these adaptations specifically biochemical adaptations become the source of plant defense mechanisms against biotic stresses like insect’s pest and diseases. These biochemical adaptations/mechanisms includes production of secondary metabolites of plant defense against the biotic stresses especially against insects are wide spread and highly dynamic, and are mediated the response directly or indirectly in arid horticultural crops. Production of secondary metabolites viz. terpenes, phenolics, fl...\n\nThe present study was carried out to screen various varieties/germplasms of ber, Ziziphus mauritiana (Lamk) against ber fruit fly, Carpomyia vesuviana (Costa) during 2016-17 at ber orchard of Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University, Regional Research Station, Bawal. The study on varietal/germplasm screening revealed that there were marked differences in per cent fruit fly infestation on different varieties/germplasms. Kaithali exhibited maximum fruit fly infestation (51.06%) and BS-1 showed minimum fruit fly infestation (1.51%). Out of total 39 varieties/germplasms, maximum no. of varieties/germplasms i.e. 14 fell in the category of susceptible (31.00-40.99% infestation). Two varieties BS-1 and Illaichi fell in the category of resistant (1.00-10.99% infestation). The data on fruit fly infestation showed that there is huge scope of utilizing host plant resistance as a pest management strategy and thus the ill effects of pesticides can be minimized.\n\nPollinators and pollinizers play pivotal role in pollination of arid and semi-arid horticultural crop species for sustaining the crop diversity and production systems. Many horticultural crops such as ber, aonla, pomegranate, phalsa, fig, jamun, citrus, bael, khejri, cucurbits, field beans etc. require insect pollinators for efficient pollination) to gain the higher yield. The pollinators and pollinizers increase quantitative and qualitative traits of horticultural crop produce. The present paper provides comprehensive information on the role of native as well as managed pollinators in the arid and semi-arid horticultural crop production. It is necessary to understand the importance of pollinators and pollinizers species richness or diversity in their natural habitat and role in crop improvement. The pollination with honeybees, knowledge about pollinizers, pollinator’s management and artificial pollination are major horticultural inventions to enhance the yield and quality in hortic...\n\nThe experiment was carried out at SKRAU, Bikaner (Raj.) in the year 2015-16. In the present study a significant difference was found between number of healthy fruits, number of infested fruits, level of infestation in fruits on number and weight basis and marketable yield of protected and unprotected plots. The average fruit yield per tree of protected plots was 36.41 kg per tree while the average fruit yield of unprotected plots was only 15.68 kg per tree. The loss in yield caused by ber fruit fly, Carpomyia vesuviana was 56.93 per cent in unprotected trees as compared to protected trees.\n\nThe jujube crop (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) is one of the oldest crops in China and in the world. Written indications about its technology (grafting, pruning, pest control etc) are older than 1500 years, when the jujube was one of the top five most important fruits in China, together with peach, apricot, plum and chestnut. Their nutraceutical qualities were highly appreciated, but also the beauty of the tree and the flower perfume, which legends says, made people fall in love. Nowadays, the crop is expanding, both in China and on the other continents, due to the high content of bioactive compounds that can help in lowering the blood pressure, in liver diseases, anaemia and also inhibit the growth of tumor cells etc. In Romania, the species grows sub spontaneous since the antique times and until the present moment no important pests had been reported. Still, giving the climatic changes in the last years, many pests became invasive and enlarge their host plant spectrum. On the USAMV Bucha..."
