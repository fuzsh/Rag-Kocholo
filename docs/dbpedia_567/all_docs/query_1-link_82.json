Our story begins where most good stories start: our ancestors A plant used for generations by families Ziziphus (ziz-if-us) is the scientific name of a tree/bush locals know better as qasil, sidr, ber, bidarah, and jujube. It would traditionally be collected, grinded and then applied to compromised skin – bugs […]",

        "text": "Until the skin is completely weaned off steroids, which could take a month or more, we don’t recommend using.\n\nHere’s a more detailed explanation we sent to previous customers:\n\n‘We’ve noticed a pattern that returns were almost exclusively from customers who use steroids.\n\nThe sad reality is that when you stop using steroids, you will get flare-ups. The skin forms an unhealthy relationship with steroids that it becomes addicted to it.\n\nEven if you were to replace the steroids with the ‘world’s best cream,’ you would face flare-ups as soon as you stopped using steroids. I’m sorry but from our research, our cream will not help you as long as you are on steroids or until you’ve completely weaned off it.\n\nWe are not recommending that you stop using steroids by the way. Weaning off it can be quite painful and difficult. This is a personal choice. You can google ‘Topical Steroid Withdrawal’ or TSW for more information.\n\nThis may not be the answer many are looking for, but we would rather make nothing than to cause further pain and suffering to our customers.’"
