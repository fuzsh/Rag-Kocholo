Borneo lowland and montane rain forests; alt. 0 – 1400 m.\n\nconservation status. Least Concern (LC). Although this taxon is endemic and likely declining given the widespread destruction of rainforests in Borneo (Gaveau et al. 2014), it was collected in, or very close to, several protected areas, and its EOO is greater than 450,000 km2. With Ziziphus angustifolia, it is the most collected taxon of Ziziphus in Borneo and is known to have been collected in the following protected areas: Labi Hills (Bukit Teraja) Forest Reserve (IUCN Category Ia), Labi Hills (Luagan Lalak) Forest Reserve (IUCN Category V), Ulu Temburong National Park (IUCN Category II) in Brunei; Bukit Baka - Bukit Raya National Park (IUCN Category II) and Gunung Palung National Park (IUCN Category II) in Kalimantan; Kabili Sepilok Virgin Jungle Reserve (IUCN Category not reported), Mount Pock Protection Forest Reserve (IUCN Category Ia), Siaungau Virgin Jungle Reserve (IUCN Category Ia) in Sabah; Lambir Hills National Park (IUCN Category II) and Niah National Park (IUCN Category II) in Sarawak.\n\nphenology. Collected in flower in June and Aug. – Oct.; collected in fruit Aug. – May.\n\nvernacular names. Kangam Sopuan/Sapuan (Akar fide Maidi 1534 & Elleh SAN 34357).\n\nuses. Fruits edible, sweet (fide Church et al. 544).\n\nnotes. Ziziphus borneensis, including all four varieties, is recognised in its cymes being few-flowered, subsessile and fascicle-like (Fig. 1A) and its fruits being hairy and ellipsoid, c. 2.2 × 1.5 cm. Ziziphus borneensis var. borneensis is most like Z. borneensis var. velutina in the branchlets, leaves and flowers most often having a dense reddish indumentum (Fig. 1E) and with the abaxial leaf surface being soft to the touch on account of the dense, soft hairs (Fig. 1D) but differs in the distinct intramarginal vein running along the leaf margin (vs indistinct) (Fig. 1B), the outline of the margin, which is entire (vs serrate near the apex) (Fig. 1C), and the hairs on the young parts and distal portions of branchlets usually c. 0.5 mm long and appressed to spreading (vs c. 1 mm long and mostly ± spreading) (Fig. 1E). When compared with other species, this variety is most like Z. kunstleri and Z. puberula in having hairy, ellipsoid fruits > 2 cm long but differs from both in the subsessile fascicle-like cymes and fruits. Vegetatively, it differs from Z. kunstleri in the transverse veins that join the main veins usually unbranched and closely spaced, by c. 1 mm from each other and the higher order reticulations between the transverse scalariform veins that join the main veins are barely visible (vs transverse veins usually branched, spaced by c. 5 mm and with conspicuous, raised longitudinal venules between them) (Fig. 1D). It differs from Z. puberula in the conspicuous indumentum of dense hairs > 0.5 mm long on branchlets, leaves and flowers (vs minute, scarcely visible to the naked eye in Z. puberula). It differs from both Z. kunstleri and Z. puberula in the c. 8 strong marginal veins on either side rarely forming clear loops with each other but all reaching a usually well-defined intramarginal vein running along the leaf margin (vs > 10 strong marginal veins on either side in Z. puberula and > 20 in Z. kunstleri, consistently forming clear loops with each other and not joining a well-defined intramarginal vein (Fig. 1A & B). The strong marginal veins in Z. borneensis var. borneensis are reminiscent of Z. horsfieldii but the axillary flowers, reddish indumentum and large ellipsoid fruit clearly distinguish the species. Ziziphus cumingiana var. cumingiana also has axillary, fascicle-like cymes but differs in the leaves being thin-chartaceous, with crenate margins, higher order reticulations and well-developed areoles, clearly visible with a hand lens, drying dark red and contrasting strongly with the lamina colour, and the fruits being smaller, c. 7 × 6 mm, obovoid and glabrous.\n\nElmer 20149, indicated as the type in the protologue (Merrill 1929), is widely distributed with duplicates available in at least 12 herbaria. The specimen from UC, where Merrill worked from 1924 – 1929, and which is in flower, is selected here as the lectotype.\n\n2b. Ziziphus borneensis var. kinabalui Suess. (Suessenguth 1950). Type: Malaysia, Sabah, Ranau, Tenompok, 5000 ft [1500 m], 14 March 1932, Clemens & Clemens 30376 (lectotype, selected here: M [M-0211795]; isolectotypes: K [sheet 2, K000723017], L [L 0013798], M [M-0211796]).\n\nBranchlets densely hairy on young parts and distal portions, hairs c. 1 mm long and mostly ± spreading. Leaves narrow ovate (– elliptic), (4.2 –) 5.5 (– 7.5) × (1.8 –) 2.4 (– 3.1) cm; callosities protruding off a margin that is finely serrate in outline, serrations clearly visible all along leaf margin; strong marginal veins coming off the outside of the two outer main veins c. 8 on either side, intramarginal vein running along the leaf margin indistinct; venation not clearly reticulate, transverse veins that join the main veins much stronger than the longitudinal venules between them; lamina subglabrous abaxially except along larger veins, marginal veins and transverse veins between the main veins.

Borneo montane rain forests; alt. c. 1500 m.\n\nconservation status. Data Deficient (DD). The variety is only known from a single locality. It thus meets the IUCN B1a criterion for Critically Endangered, but a decline or fluctuation of the population cannot be estimated or inferred. The specimens may have been collected within the Tenompok Protection Forest Reserve (IUCN Category Ia) or Kinabalu National Park and ASEAN Heritage Park (IUCN Category II) where forests appear well preserved in satellite images. The variety is considered here to be Data Deficient because the data are so uncertain that both LC and CR are plausible categories.\n\nphenology. Collected in flower in March.\n\nnotes. Ziziphus borneensis var. kinabalui is most ike Z. borneensis var. velutina in the dense reddish indumentum on branchlets, the c. 8 strong marginal veins on either side and the indistinct intramarginal vein running along the leaf margin but differs in the lamina being subglabrous except along main and transverse veins (vs all lamina surface densely hairy) (Fig. 1J) and in the serrations clearly visible all along leaf margin (Fig. 1G & H).\n\nA sheet of Clemens & Clemens 30376 from M is marked as the holotype, and while this collection is cited in the protologue (Suessenguth 1950), additional material is available at M and other herbaria. The sheet marked as the holotype is therefore designated here as the lectotype because no specific sheet was indicated in the protologue.\n\nTwo sheets of Clemens & Clemens 30376 are also available at K, but this is a mixed collection: only Sheet 2 (marked “Sheet II”) is of this variety of Ziziphus borneensis. Sheet 1 [K000723017] is a specimen of Z. havilandii.\n\n2c. Ziziphus borneensis var. ranggam Cahen & Utteridge var. nov. Type: Indonesia, Borneo, West Kalimantan, Sintang, Bukit Baka National Park.

Leaves narrow ovate (– elliptic-oblong), (7.2 –) 10.6 (– 15.0) × (3.0 –) 4.3 (– 5.3) cm; callosities protruding off a margin that is finely serrate in outline, serrations visible all along leaf margin but especially clearly near apex; strong marginal veins coming off the outside of the two outer main veins > 15 on either side, intramarginal vein running along the leaf margin very distinct; venation reticulate abaxially, with the longitudinal venules between the transverse veins that join the main veins conspicuous and raised; lamina densely hairy abaxially on its entire surface. Fig. 1Q – T.\n\nrecognition. This variety is recognised in the longer leaves, to 15 cm, with the margins distinctly finely serrate, the numerous strong marginal veins, > 15, coming off the outside of the two outer main veins, and the longitudinal venules clearly visible between the transverse veins that join the main veins.\n\ndistribution.

The varietal epithet is the local name indicated on the label of the type specimens (West Kalimantan, language unknown).\n\nvernacular names. Ranggam (West Kalimantan, language not specified, fide Church et al. 96).\n\nnotes. The leaf venation in this variety is strikingly different from other Ziziphus borneensis varieties, with > 15 strong marginal veins on either side (Fig. 1R) and the reticulations of finer venules clearly visible (Fig. 1S). It is like Z. puberula in the marginal veins > 15 (although sometimes < 15 in Z. puberula) and the big, > 2 cm, ellipsoid fruit, but differs in the dense indumentum of longer hairs on the branchlets and leaves (Fig. 1S & T), reticulation of leaf veinlets clearly visible, the presence of a distinct intramarginal vein running along the leaf margin (Fig. 1Q), subsessile fascicle-like cymes and subsessile fruit.\n\nThe variety is only known from three localities each at least 200 km apart from one another. Specimens of the Sarawak collections have a more reddish indumentum, but all share the same characteristic venation pattern.\n\n2d. Ziziphus borneensis var. velutina Cahen & Utteridge var. nov. Type: Malaysia, Sabah, Ranau, Kundasang above Sosopodon, 11 April 1962, [the date on the label is 31 April 1962, which does not exist; 11 April was inferred from other collections above Sosopodon by Tikau in 1962] Tikau SAN 28913 (holotype: K [K001420127]; isotype: L [L.2336619]).\n\nhttp://www.ipni.org/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:77218842-1\n\nBranchlets densely hairy on young parts and distal portions, hairs c. 1 mm long and mostly ± spreading.

Borneo montane rain forests; alt. c. 1300 m.\n\nconservation status. Data Deficient (DD). The variety is only known from the Kundasang-Sosopodon area near Mount Kinabalu. It thus meets the IUCN B1a criterion for Critically Endangered, but a decline or fluctuation of the population cannot be estimated or inferred. The specimens may have been collected within the Sosopodon Forest Reserve (IUCN Category Ia) where despite some fragmentation, forests seem well preserved overall in satellite images. The variety is considered here to be Data Deficient because the data is so uncertain that both LC and CR are plausible categories.\n\nphenology. Collected in fruit in April and July.\n\netymology. The varietal epithet derives from the Italian velluto, velvet, itself derived from the Latin villus, hair, and refers to the dense indumentum of hairs on the abaxial surface of leaves making them soft to touch.\n\nvernacular names.

This variety differs from the other Ziziphus borneensis varieties in the combination of branchlets having dense, long, reddish, mostly spreading hairs, c. 1 mm long (Fig. 1P), strong marginal veins coming off outer main veins c. 8 on either side (Fig. 1L) and the abaxial lamina surface being completely covered in hairs (Fig. 1N).\n\n3.

Ziziphus calophylla is widely distributed in much of western Malesia and does not appear to be threatened. In Borneo, it is likely that the taxon is declining and severely fragmented given the widespread destruction of rainforests. However, the species was collected in protected areas: Sepilok Virgin Jungle Reserve (IUCN Category not reported) in Sabah and Lambir Hills National Park (IUCN Category II) in Sarawak.\n\nphenology.

Fibres used to frame top part of baskets (fide Christensen 1446); medicinally used “against Rabus (white in the mouth) probably fungal attack” (fide Christensen 1446); sap drinkable (fide Christensen 1446).\n\nnotes. Ziziphus calophylla is recognised by the leaves being long, usually > 10 cm, leathery, usually elliptic, ± symmetric, with only the three main veins conspicuous and a faint but distinct intramarginal vein running along the leaf margin. The species is morphologically similar to Z. suluensis, as noted by Merrill (1929), but differs in the abaxial leaf surface having no to few glands (vs many) and leaf shape usually elliptic and ± symmetric (vs elliptic-oblong and asymmetric). Other differences include leaves that are more coriaceous, on average longer (c. 11 cm vs 8 cm) with the leaf base wide-cuneate to rounded (vs frequently subcordate), inflorescences more branching and with more flowers (flowers c. 16 per cyme vs 8) and fruit often more ellipsoid-obovoid (vs globose-obovoid). Ziziphus calophylla and Z. havilandii could represent two ends of a spectrum in leaf size and leaf gland abundance with Z. suluensis covering some of the middle range.\n\nIn the protologue for Ziziphus calophylla, Wallich (in Roxburgh 1824) cites material “discovered on the hill of Pulo Pinang [Penang Island] by Mr. George Porter\". Four sheets collected by Porter in Penang were located, and a K-W sheet is selected as lectotype here because it is in the East India Company Herbarium (EICH) and can be considered the ‘top set’ upon which Wallich worked, and the sheet selected [K001038440] has fruits, whereas the the second EICH specimen [K001038440] is sterile.\n\nZiziphus ornata Miq. is placed as a synonym here. As noted by King (1896), no apparent morphological character seems to separate it from Z. calophylla. In the protologue for Z. suluensis, Merrill (1926) noted the similarity between Z. suluensis and Z. ornata (=Z. calophylla), noting that “except in leaf size the characters of Ziziphus ornata Miq., ex descr., apply closely to the present species”. In the protologue for Z. ornata Miquel (1856) cites material collected by Horsfield in Banka [Bangka]. A specimen identified as Z. ornata, possibly from Miquel’s private herbarium, is available at U [U.1541152], but the collector is not specified and the collection locality (illegible) is not Bangka. However, a sheet labelled as collected in Bangka Island by Horsfield is available at K and designated as the lectotype here.\n\n4. Ziziphus crebrivenosa C.B.Rob. (Robinson 1908: 201).

It is likely that the taxon is declining and severely fragmented given the widespread destruction of rainforests in Borneo (Gaveau et al. 2014), Mindanao (Viloria et al. 2005) and Sulawesi (Cannon et al. 2007). However, the taxon is distributed with an EOO greater than 200,000 km2. Also, the species occurs in montane forests possibly less exposed to heavy exploitation.

Fruits edible (fide Madani SAN 76313 and Othman et al. S.57735).\n\nnotes. Ziziphus crebrivenosa is recognised in being the only species with numerous blister-like raised lenticels on its long, to 3 cm, often ellipsoid fruits. It is most like Z. kunstleri in having leaves at least 10 cm long with clearly raised transverse veins that join the main veins on the abaxial surface and in having mature fruits to at least 2 cm in length. However, finer vein reticulations are not clearly raised in Z. crebrivenosa and transverse veins tend to join the main veins without branching (vs reticulations raised and transverse veins tending to branch in Z. kunstleri). In addition, branchlets of Z. crebrivenosa have raised lenticels whereas those of Z. kunstleri are superficial and tend to be concealed on the younger parts by the dense reddish indumentum.\n\nWilliams 2335 is designated as the type in the protologue for Ziziphus crebrivenosa (Robinson 1908) and a sheet of this material from NY where Robinson worked from 1903 to 1908 is selected here as the lectotype.\n\nMerrill (1922) highlighted the “ellipsoid, not globose, entirely glabrous, conspicuously lenticellate fruits” in his protologue of Ziziphus lenticellata but compared vegetative characters of this species to those of Z. horsfieldii. He did not consider Z. crebrivenosa in this publication despite listing it in his An Enumeration of Philippine Plants the following year (Merrill 1923). No morphological character seems to separate Z. lenticellata from Z. crebrivenosa and it is placed as a synonym here. Merrill (1922) mentions Castillo 644 and Agama 1018 in the protologue for Z. lenticellata and the sheet of Agama 1018 from A is selected as the lectotype because it is in flower unlike those of Castillo 644 and may have been examined by Merrill.\n\n5.

Borneo lowland rain forests; alt. 0 – 300 m.\n\nconservation status. Least Concern (LC). The species has a wide distribution with collections in lowland forests across Borneo and in many islands of the Philippines (Alabat, Leyte, Luzon, Mindanao, Mindoro, Palawan, Visayas). In Borneo, it is likely that the taxon is declining and severely fragmented given the widespread destruction of rainforests. However, the species was collected in protected areas, e.g. Gomantong Protection Forest Reserve (IUCN Category Ia) in Sabah.\n\nphenology.

Ziziphus cumingiana var. cumingiana is recognised by the small glabrous fruits (< 0.9 cm in diam.) inserted in subsessile fascicle-like cymes. The only other species on Borneo known to have glabrous fruits are Z. cuspidata and Z. domatiata. The fruits of Z. cuspidata are bigger, on average 2.0 × 1.5 cm, and arranged in pedunculate cymes; those of Z. domatiata slightly bigger, c. 1.0 × 0.8 cm, also arranged in pedunculate cymes. The dark red venation when dry, including the smallest venules, is unique among Ziziphus species in Borneo, as is the sparse indumentum on the pedicels and flowers and the weakly and distantly crenate margin with a tooth and hairs inserted by the sinus of each crenation.\n\nZiziphus cumingiana var. cumingiana shares many morphological characters with Z. oenopolia (L.) Mill. which, despite being widely distributed from India to Australia (GBIF 2019), has apparently not yet been recorded in Borneo. Both species have leaves obliquely ovate, < 10 cm in length, with strong marginal veins, subsessile fascicle-like cymes and fruits small, c. 1 cm in diam., glabrous, globose to obovoid. Ziziphus oenopolia differs from Z. cumingiana var. cumingiana in the transverse veins between the main veins strong and ascending, and the leaves densely hairy abaxially. The widespread, cultivated and sometimes naturalised Z. mauritiana and Z. jujuba also have subsessile fascicle-like cymes and globose fruits but the leaf apex is usually rounded or notched as opposed to attenuate. Lectotypes for both Z. mauritiana and Z. oenopolia were recently selected in a review of the nomenclature of the species of Ziziphus occurring in Australia (Kellermann 2020).\n\nZiziphus cumingiana var. pilosa Merr. (Merrill 1923: 522) differs from Z. cumingiana var. cumingiana in the more densely hairy leaf surface abaxially. The difference is marked and while specimens of this variety collected in the Philippines are available in herbaria, it is not known to have been found in Borneo. Vernacular names of Z. cumingiana in the Philippines are listed by Merrill (loc. cit.).\n\nMerrill (1906) did not designate a type specimen in the protologue for Ziziphus cumingiana but lists Cuming 453 as illustrative and a sheet of this material, which is in flower, is selected here as the lectotype.\n\nZiziphus bulusanensis is listed as a synonym of Z. cumingiana by Merrill (1923) but because there is no retrievable diagnosis or description associated with it, the name seems to have not been validly published.\n\n6.

Ziziphus havilandii is recognised by leaves having abundant dark glands (appearing as black spots) on the abaxial lamina. Only the three main veins are clearly visible and a faint but distinct intramarginal vein running along the leaf margin is present. It is also recognised by the presence of wide ovate, fugaceous stipules c. 3 × 2 mm and the spines of distal branchlets spaced by c. 1 cm, closer to each other than in most other species. It most resembles Z. suluensis in the black spot, venation and stipule characters. Ziziphus havilandii differs from Z. suluensis in the leaves being smaller, usually 2.5 – 5.5 × 1.2 – 2.5 cm, (vs usually 8 × 3.5 cm), chartaceous (vs chartaceous-subcoriaceous), usually more asymmetric and widest near base (vs widest near middle), often denser indumentum on distal branchlets and usually smaller fruits, on average 0.9 × 0.8 cm (vs 1.2 – 1.5 × 0.9 – 1.5 cm). The difference between the two species is slight, they could represent a single species on the same morphological variability continuum. Ziziphus suluensis was originally described based on material collected in Tawi-tawi, close to Borneo and the species is not known to occur on more northern islands of the Philippines, also suggesting that Z. havilandii and Z. suluensis could be a single lineage restricted to Borneo’s near vicinity (Sulawesi and southern Philippines). Schirarend (1995) used the character of the intramarginal vein to distinguish the two species (present in Z. havilandii, absent in Z. suluensis), but this could not be observed on all available specimens previously identified as Z. suluensis, including the type material.\n\nRidley (1931) cited Beccari 2493 and Haviland 2134 in his protologue for Ziziphus havilandii, and he indicated that the latter specimen is the “type”. A sheet of the Haviland 2134 collection is selected here as the lectotype.\n\n9. Ziziphus horsfieldii Miq. (Miquel 1856: 643). Type: Indonesia, Java, 1802 – 1818, Horsfield s.n.

Borneo lowland rain forests; alt. 30 – 520 m.\n\nconservation status. Least Concern (LC). Ziziphus horsfieldii is widely distributed in western Malesia and extends to the Philippines. It does not appear to be threatened. In Borneo, it could be declining and severely fragmented given recent widespread destruction of rainforests but was collected in the following protected areas in Sabah: Bidu-Bidu Protection Forest Reserve (IUCN Category Ia), Klias Protection Forest Reserve (IUCN Category not reported) and SG.

In Borneo, Ziziphus horsfieldii is most like Z. cuspidata and Z. domatiata in having pedunculate cymes, fruits < 1.5 × longer than wide, leaves usually < 7 × 3 cm with usually < 8 strong marginal veins coming off the outer main veins on either side. It differs from both species in the densely hairy fruits (vs glabrous). It also differs from Z. cuspidata in the smaller fruits, c. 1.1 × 1.1 cm (vs c. 2 × 1.5 cm), the leaf lamina being subglabrous abaxially except along larger veins (vs usually hairy), the longer petioles, c. 10 mm (vs 3 – 7 mm) and the often clear presence of tufts of hairs at the junction between the outer main veins and the marginal veins. It further differs from Z. domatiata in the obovoid fruits (vs subglobose) and leaves with c. 6 strong marginal veins on either side (vs. c. 4).\n\nThe type material from Java is unusual in having almost subsessile fruits but does not appear to differ in any other morphological character from material recognised here as Ziziphus horsfieldii. A lectotype is selected here among the Horsfield material collected in Java. Two additional sheets of Z. horsfieldii from Java marked as belonging to Horsfield’s herbarium are available at K (K000723024, K000723026) but whether these are isolectotypes, i.e. from the same collection event as the lectotype, is unsure.\n\nZiziphus palawanensis Elmer is placed as a synonym here because no apparent morphological character from the type material or protologue description seems to separate it from Z. horsfieldii. Elmer (1913) described the climber as forming “dense hanging masses over the open creek bed”. Elmer 12891, indicated as the type in the protologue for Z. palawanensis (Elmer op. cit.), is widely distributed with duplicates available in at least seven herbaria. and the sheet at A, where much of Elmer’s herbarium collections are kept, is selected here as the lectotype.\n\n10.

Ziziphus kunstleri is recognised in the dense reddish indumentum on the branchlets and inflorescence, large ovate leaves, to 17.7 × 9.8 cm, densely hairy abaxially, pedunculate cymes and big fruits, c. 3 × 1.8 cm, ellipsoid, brownish. Ziziphus kunstleri is most easily confused vegetatively with Z. crebrivenosa because of the similar leaf size and marginal veins coming off the outside of the two outer main veins forming several loops near the margin. However, leaves of Z. kunstleri have raised veins, including in smaller reticulations, and the transverse veins between the main veins tend to branch (vs finer reticulations not clearly raised and transverse veins tend to join the main veins without branching in Z. crebrivenosa). In addition, branchlets of Z. kunstleri have superficial lenticels concealed on younger parts by the dense reddish indumentum (vs lenticels conspicuous and raised in Z. crebrivenosa). Both species occur in Borneo, but their distribution is not known to overlap elsewhere.\n\nKing (1896) specified naming the species \"in memory of its first collector, H. H. Kunstler, who sent it from Province Wellesley in 1881\" and lists King’s Collector [Kunstler] 1607 as illustrative material in his protologue for Ziziphus kunstleri. A sheet of this material is available at K, which holds King’s main sets, and is selected here as the lectotype.\n\nZiziphus cupularis type material does not appear to differ from Z. kunstleri. In the protologue notes for Z. cupularis, Suessenguth & Overkott (1941) indicated that both species are similar but that Z. kunstleri differs in having axillary inflorescences and a hypanthium that is not cup-shaped. In Z. kunstleri, inflorescences are indeed subtended by leaves at an early stage, but these leaves, which are distinctly smaller than more proximal leaves, soon fall and inflorescences then are paniculate as in the type material for Z. cupularis. The hypanthium appears cup-shaped on most Z. kunstleri material as it does in the type material for Z. cupularis, but this is no longer obvious in specimens with fully open flowers, such as King’s Collector 1607. Suessenguth & Overkott cited Native Collector 113 in the protologue for Z. cupularis. Suessenguth worked in M and a sheet with a drawing of the flower of this collection, but no plant material, and referring to material in B, is available at M [M0211790]. Suessenguth & Overkott (op. cit.) also specified that the material they studied was provided by B. The type therefore used to be there and it is most likely that it was destroyed in the 1943 fire (Merrill 1943). The sheet at K, which includes open flowers, is selected here as the lectotype.\n\nSurprisingly, Ziziphus kunstleri was not included in the list of Ziziphus species occurring in Sabah and Sarawak by Schirarend (1995), despite being cited by Beaman & Anderson (2004), Masamune (1942) and Ridley (1931).\n\n11.

Fruit a drupe, ripening yellow, c. 3 × 1.7 cm, ellipsoid, with flattened base and acuminate apex, surface wrinkly when dry, covered in minute reddish hairs, < 0.1 mm long; fruiting pedicels curved, c. 5 × 2 mm, hypanthium remains caving in at base of fruit. Fig. 4.\n\nrecognition. The species resembles Ziziphus kunstleri and Z. borneensis in the ellipsoid fruits, c. 3 cm long, but differs in having pedunculate cymes, subtended by leaves that are morphologically indistinct from other leaves (in Z. borneensis cymes are few-flowered, subsessile and fascicle-like, and in Z. kunstleri cymes are ultimately arranged in panicles, earlier subtended by fugaceous leaves that are distinctly smaller and narrower than other leaves); it also differs in the indumentum of minute hairs, < 0.1 mm long, scarcely visible to the naked eye on branchlets, leaf veins and inflorescences (vs conspicuous in Z. borneensis and Z. kunstleri). Unlike Z. kunstleri, there are no prominent raised longitudinal venules between the transverse veins that join the main veins.\n\ndistribution.

Borneo lowland and montane rain forests; alt. 25 – 1800 m.\n\nconservation status. Near Threatened (NT). It is likely that the taxon is declining and severely fragmented given the widespread destruction of rainforests in Borneo. However, the taxon is distributed with an EOO greater than 200,000 km2. Also, the species occurs in montane forests possibly less exposed to heavy exploitation. Some specimens were collected in or near the following protected areas: Ulu Temburong National Park (IUCN Category II) in Brunei; Bukit Soeharto Grand Forest Park (IUCN Category VI) in Kalimantan; Kinabalu National Park and ASEAN Heritage Park (IUCN Category II) in Sabah; Mulu National Park and ASEAN Heritage Park (IUCN Category II) in Sarawak.\n\nphenology. Collected in flower in Feb., March, May, June and Sept. – Nov.; collected in fruit in Feb., March, June, Aug. and Sept.\n\netymology. Named puberula for its minute hairs, scarcely visible to the naked eye, especially along the main veins on the abaxial side of leaves and on fruits.\n\nvernacular names. Kukulan (Iban, fide Dransfield & Boyce 6667).\n\nuses. No recorded uses found.\n\nnotes. Ziziphus puberula is not known to occur outside Borneo, where it had hitherto been identified as Z. borneensis and Z. horsfieldii in herbaria. The fruits are similar in size and shape to those of Z. borneensis, but in addition to the pedunculate cymes (vs few-flowered, subsessile and fascicle-like cymes) (Fig. 4F), the discreet puberulent indumentum on the branchlets and leaves of Z. puberula (Fig. 4E) contrasts strongly with the conspicuous dense ferruginous indumentum of Z. borneensis (Fig. 1D & E). Ziziphus horsfieldii also has pedunculate cymes, but Z. puberula differs in the leaves having > 10 strong marginal veins coming off the outside of the two outer main veins on either side, forming loops near the margin (vs c. 6, ascending and gradually diminishing, not forming conspicuous loops near margin) (Fig. 4B) and the ellipsoid and bigger fruits, c. 3 × 1.7 cm (vs obovoid fruits c. 1.1 × 1.1 cm) (Fig. 4J).\n\n12.

Borneo rain forest; alt. c. 600 m.\n\nconservation status. Endangered (EN). Ziziphus ridleyana is only known from 2 collections in the Mount Pueh, Lundu area (the most recent from 1929) and Borneo rainforests have been declining in extent and quality. The species thus meets the B1ab(iii) criteria for EN status. Mount Pueh forests seem relatively well preserved on satellite imagery and Haviland’s collection may have been within Gunong Gading, an IUCN Category II (National Park) area.\n\nphenology. Collected in flower in Oct.\n\nnotes. Ziziphus ridleyana is most like Z. angustifolia in being a tree without spines but differs in the dense reddish-brown indumentum, covering the branchlets and abaxial surface of leaves (vs glabrous to sparsely hairy leaves, hairy on the main veins only) and bigger flowers, the sepals being c. 4 mm long (vs c. 2 mm long).\n\nThis species was originally published by Ridley as Ziziphus macrophylla (1931), but the name is an illegitimate later homonym of the fossil name Z. macrophylla (Ettingsh.) Schimp. (Schimper 1874: 224), following Art. 53.1 of the ICN (Shenzen Code) (Turland et al. 2018). The matter was addressed by Rasingam & Karthigeyan (2020) who published the new name Z. ridleyana to replace the illegitimate combination. Two sheets of the same collection by Garai are available at K (K000723013 and K000723014) but only one of them, the holotype, is mentioned in the Z. ridleyana protologue (K0007230134). The date of collection of the holotype is indicated to be August 1892 in the protologue, but its label does not specify a date. The label of the isotype (K000723013) reads ‘Recd. aug 1892’, which is the date the specimen was received rather than collected. Ridley (op. cit.) surprisingly compares it to the much different Z. borneensis, which is a spiny climber rather than Z. inermis (= Z. angustifolia). Ziziphus macrophylla (= Z. ridleyana) is not cited in the Tree Flora of Sabah and Sarawak (Schirarend 1995).\n\n13. Ziziphus suluensis Merr. (Merrill 1926: 408).
