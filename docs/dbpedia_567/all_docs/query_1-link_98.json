        "text": "I have featured this self-sown medium sized, deciduous tree that grows outside our lounge window before. It is a boon for our garden, for it is frost resistant, drought resistant and grows in the sun! Fortunately too, it has non aggressive roots, although I suspect a bird dropped a seed a little too close to the wall. Time will tell.\n\nThe main stem is green and hairy when young, while the older branches often zigzag.\n\nThe stout thorns – a significant aspect of this tree – occur in pairs, one straight, the other hooked. This makes it easy to become entangled in the branches. One has to extricate oneself with great care as the tips of the thorns might break off just under one’s skin and are not that easy to remove. All in all, it is preferable to give these trees a wide berth if you can while out walking in the veld – or, in my case – be very careful when pruning it!\n\nAnother noticeable aspect is that the glossy green leaves vary enormously in size from tree to tree. They also turn a beautiful, golden yellow in autumn.\n\nIt is easy enough to miss the flowers even though they are borne in dense clusters. The tiny green to yellow flowers are fairly inconspicuous.\n\nThe berries are smooth and shiny with a leathery appearance. They start off green and gradually become reddish-brown or deep red when ripe. I haven’t actually tasted them, but they are reputed to be slightly sweet. The berries become a dark brown later in the season and are enjoyed by several birds, including Speckled Mousebirds.\n\nHistorically, it has been noted that the berries were ground and used as a coffee substitute during the Anglo-Boer War. I read that they can also be used to make porridge and fermented to make a type of beer."
