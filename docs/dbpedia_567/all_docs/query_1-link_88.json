        "text": "QUESTION\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nRATING\n\nCONFIDENCE\n\nSocial 1. Restrict human access?Obstructs access (Csurhes & Edwards, 1998). Can be planted for use as an impenetrable hedge until the crown lifts from the ground at about 10 years (WAC, 2006); forms dense thickets on brackish flats near waterways (Van Wyk, 1972). Major impediment to access waterways.\n\nH\n\nMH\n\n2. Reduce tourism?This deciduous or semi-deciduous (Ward, 1980) shrub or small tree (Fors, 2002) would be very obvious to most visitors and would have a major impact on recreation, such as swimming in waterways.\n\nH\n\nMH\n\n3. Injurious to people?Has strong sharp thorns (Fors, 2002) to 2cm long (WAC, 2006). “The tree often ‘casts’ off small green twigs complete with thorns…causing…painful experience to barefoot strollers” (Van Wyk, 1972).\n\nH\n\nMH\n\n4. Damage to cultural sites?“The root system is not aggressive” (WAC, 2006). The ability to form dense thickets (Van Wyk, 1972) could cause moderate visual effect at cultural sites.\n\nML\n\nMH\n\nAbiotic 5. Impact flow?Grows in alluvial soils along rivers (Palgrave, 1977) but “the root system is not aggressive” (WAC, 2006), so unlikely to impact on flow.\n\nL\n\nMH\n\n6. Impact water quality?Grows in alluvial soils along rivers (Palgrave, 1977) but unlikely to impact on water quality.\n\nL\n\nMH\n\n7. Increase soil erosion?Has been suggested for rehabilitation of sand dunes in South Africa (Griffiths & Lawes, 2006), suggesting that it has the capacity to reduce erosion.\n\nL\n\nMH\n\n8. Reduce biomass?This tree species can displace grasses (Csurhes & Edwards, 1998), which would increase biomass.\n\nL\n\nMH\n\n9. Change fire regime?Unknown\n\nM\n\nL\n\nCommunity Habitat 10. Impact on composition\n\n(a) high value EVCPotential distribution of Ziziphus mucronata excludes Victoria. No impact on EVCs in Victoria.\n\nL\n\nH\n\n(b) medium value EVCPotential distribution of Ziziphus mucronata excludes Victoria. No impact on EVCs in Victoria.\n\nL\n\nH\n\n(c) low value EVCPotential distribution of Ziziphus mucronata excludes Victoria. No impact on EVCs in Victoria.\n\nL\n\nH\n\n11. Impact on structure?Competes with riparian vegetation and displaces grasses (Csurhes & Edwards, 1998). Grows to 9m tall (WAC, 2006). Abundant and dominant on the flood-plain in its native range (Zietsman et al, 1989). Major effect on ground layer vegetation.\n\nMH\n\nMH\n\n12. Effect on threatened flora?The potential for Ziziphus mucronata to establish and naturalise in Victoria is highly unlikely due to ecoclimatic limitations. No impact on threatened flora in Victoria.\n\nL\n\nH\n\nFauna 13. Effect on threatened fauna?The potential for Ziziphus mucronata to establish and naturalise in Victoria is highly unlikely due to ecoclimatic limitations. No impact on threatened fauna in Victoria.\n\nL\n\nH\n\n14. Effect on non-threatened fauna?This species forms dense thickets (Van Wyk, 1972), and can displace grasses (Wells et al, 1986), which may reduce food availability for grazing animals.\n\nML\n\nMH\n\n15. Benefits fauna?Browse species in Zimbabwe (Dube & Ndlovu, 1996). May provide fodder for browsing animals, especially during drought (Palgrave, 1977).\n\nMH\n\nMH\n\n16. Injurious to fauna?Has strong sharp thorns (Fors, 2002) to 2cm long, and is palatable to animals (WAC, 2006). Potential for thorns to cause injury to browsing animals.\n\nH\n\nMH\n\nPest Animal 17. Food source to pests?Seeds eaten by rodents (Fors, 2002). Fruit eaten by wild animals (Fors, 20020), including birds (Griffiths & Laws, 2006).” Leaves and fallen fruits are browsed on by stock and game and can provide useful fodder in times of drought;” fruits often remain of the tree over winter (Palgrave, 1977). May provide some food to rodents and pest birds.\n\nML\n\nMH\n\n18. Provides harbour?Of the many studies that describe the uses of this tree by animals (Maier et al, 2006; Fors, 2002), use as habitat is never described. The deciduous nature of this tree (Wells et al, 1986) may reduce its harbour value.\n\nL\n\nMH\n\nAgriculture 19. Impact yield?Pastoral weed of South Africa (Csurhes & Edwards, 1998); out competes pastoral grasses (Wells et al, 1986); browse species in Zimbabwe (Dube & Ndlovu, 1996), with high nutritional value (Van Wyk, 1972). The deciduous nature of this tree (Wells et al, 1986) may reduce its fodder value, as it can out compete pasture, but would provide a source of fodder only when in leaf.\n\nML\n\nMH\n\n20. Impact quality?Recorded as a seed contaminant (Wells et al, 1986), however, as a tree, it is unlikely to have much impact on harvested seed.\n\nL\n\nL\n\n21. Affect land value?No evidence that this weed affects land value.\n\nL\n\nL\n\n22. Change land use?No evidence that this weed causes changes in land use.\n\nL\n\nL\n\n23. Increase harvest costs?No evidence that this weed increases harvest costs.\n\nL\n\nL"
