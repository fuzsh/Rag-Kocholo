        "text": "Botanical Overview\n\nA member of the Buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae), the genus Ziziphus has about 40 species composed of spiny shrubs and trees. Ziziphus jujuba is cultivated and naturalized in temperate and tropical zones world-wide, most extensively in Asia, and has over 800 cultivar names.\n\nDescription\n\nForm: A tree which varies from tall and narrow to wide and rounded.\n\nLifespan: Jujube trees may be productive for more than 100 years.\n\nLeaf retention: Deciduous.\n\nGrowth rate: Moderate to rapid.\n\nMature Size: 30-50' (9-15m) high and 15-30' (4.5-9m) wide, depending on cultivar.\n\nFlowers: Very small, clustered, greenish-yellow, five relatively large sepals, five tiny petals, fragrant. Jujubes are divided into morning-opening or afternoon-opening, however this does not seem to affect fruit set in temperate climates such as the United States.\n\nBloom: Spring into summer. The flowers bloom in the same year their buds form.\n\nSelf-fruitful: Most cultivars produce fruit by self-pollination, although the yield can be low without a second tree. Some cultivars require a second tree nearby, often another cultivar, especially to produce viable seeds. Ants and wind, rather than bees, seem to do most of the pollination. Hand pollination may be needed when pollinating insects are absent or lack interest.\n\nIn China, cultivars are classified by fruit set temperature requirements: high – daily average temperature 77°F (25°C) or higher), intermediate – 73.4°F (23°C), and low – 70°F (21°C or higher). Low daily average temperatures at the time of flowering can reduce fruit set and productivity in some cultivars.\n\nYears before fruiting: Most cultivars flower and fruit in their first year of planting. All will be flowering in their second year. They become most productive at three to five years.\n\nFruit: Thin skin, white flesh, edible, cherry sized (small) to plum sized (very large). If pollinated, the fruit has a single stone containing two seeds. The skin is green when the fruit is immature. When edible, the skin turns yellow-green, then acquires red or red-brown spots, then becomes entirely red-brown at which point the fruit is at the peak of its flavor. Wrinkles develop after the fruit become fully red-brown, and on some cultivars, just before the fully red-brown stage.\n\nThe flavor depends on cultivar, microclimate, and irrigation. For fresh eating cultivars, the taste is crisp and sweet-tart, like an apple, between the yellow-green and red-brown stages; however large fruit should not be harvested until at least half red-brown. For drying and multipurpose cultivars, when almost fully red-brown, the fruit can change in flavor to a cross between an apple and a date, and to date-like when fully dried.\n\nMonths for fruit to ripen: 2-3. The fruit ripen on the tree a few at a time, over many months. The fruit of fresh eating cultivars are edible when the skin color changes from green to yellow green or light green. The best flavor for fresh eating and multipurpose cultivars is when they are half to full red-brown. Do not allow the fruit to dry on the tree past the full red-brown phase. They lose flavor and vitamin C quickly after that. The best time to harvest is early morning when the fruit have moisture and a better flavor. In the afternoon, they are dryer and lose crispness.\n\nLate ripening cultivars need to grow in regions with long, hot summers and their fruit may not ripen in short-season colder climates.\n\nStorage after harvest: The fruit do not ripen further if picked when the skin is green, but will continue to ripen if picked after a change in color to light green or red-brown. Depending on maturity, fresh jujube can be refrigerated 2 weeks to 2 months. Drying jujubes should be oven dried when harvested fully red-brown. They can then be refrigerated as long as one year.\n\nLeaves: Long and narrowly lance-shaped to oval, finely serrated margins, three longitudinal veins, green, turning yellow in the fall. Some cultivars have naturally curly or cupped leaves.\n\nStems: Branches have a slight zigzag shape with two spines at the base of each leaf. The spines may be straight or hooked. Jujube has four types of shoots – primary shoots which grow longer every year; secondary side branches that wither and die after 2-3 years; mother-bearing fruiting spurs only one millimeter long on the secondary branches; and fruit-bearing branchlets 4-8\" (10-20cm) long growing from the spurs. The primary shoot of young trees has smooth, reddish-brown bark.\n\nThese trees usually become less thorny with age.\n\nRoots: Jujube is often grafted onto rootstock which can produce suckers from its lateral roots over a wide area, even into the yards of neighbors. Trees should be planted 30' (9m) from the foundation of any structure and 50' (15m) from water pipes and sewer/septic systems. The roots of a jujube tree can extend 12-25' (4-8m) deep.\n\nCultivars of Note:\n\nFRESH EATING cultivars\n\n'Autumn Beauty'\n\nLarge fruit, very good spicy-apple flavor, low-medium yield, early season ripening.

Tree height 10' (3m) after 3 years, width about 75% of height, thorny.\n\nWildlife: The flowers attract ants which are the main pollinators, and the occasional bee or wasp. The fruit attract birds and small mammals such as raccoons. The bark is generally not eaten by rabbits. Small fruited cultivars may be stripped by birds unless covered by bird netting.\n\nToxic / Danger: Sharp thorns on many cultivars.\n\nOrigin: South Asia. Jujube has been cultivated for more than 7000 years in China.\n\nCultivation and Uses\n\nUSDA hardiness zones: 6-11. Jujubes are more productive in zones 8a and up, but a few short to mid-season ripening cultivars can grow and fruit well in zone 6a.\n\nChill hours: 150-400 hours, depending on cultivar.\n\nHeat tolerant: Yes.\n\nDrought tolerant: Yes.\n\nSun: Full sun.\n\nPlanting: These trees do not do well in containers because they need to develop an extensive root system. No soil amendment is necessary when planting. Deep soils are best, although the tree seems to flourish in most situations. Space each tree 15-30' (4.6-9m) apart depending on expected mature width.\n\nSoil: This tree is tolerant of soil types except that the soil must be well draining. They can tolerate pH 5.1-7.8 (strongly acidic to slightly alkaline). Minor nutritional deficiencies occur between pH 7.8 to 8.5 (alkaline). It is moderately saline tolerant.\n\nFertilize: Fertilize once a year, before flowering, for best fruiting performance, but the tree can get by without this step.\n\nWater after becoming established: During fruiting, deep water or basin irrigate once a week in sandy loam or every two weeks in clay, accounting for rain. Fruit may suffer small skin splits with inconsistent water or rain or if irrigated after a brief drought.\n\nInsufficient water results in poor-tasting fruit and fruit drop. If the tree is not watered during an extended warm season drought, its leaves will turn brown and it will go dormant; once a rainy season begins, new leaves will sprout.\n\nA need for water is signaled by drooping leaves. Excessively moist soils can lead to root rot.\n\nWater monthly when not fruiting.\n\nMulch: Apply organic mulch inside the drip line, 8\" (20cm) away from the trunk, to reduce moisture loss.\n\nFirst Year Care: Do not fertilize the tree in the first year.\n\nPrune: Flowers and fruit develop on new growth. If fruit are growing too abundantly, it may be necessary to thin the fruit so those remaining will grow to proper size.\n\nRemove root suckers immediately that are growing below the graft or away from the trunk, because they are from the wrong tree, often very thorny, and often produce poor-tasting fruit.\n\nWhen the tree is dormant in winter, remove dead and damaged branches, and remove crossing and crowded branches from the center of tree.\n\nPruning every winter improves fruiting. The rule is \"one cut stops, two cuts sprout\". After cutting a one-year shoot, cut off a secondary shoot below the cut to force new growth and flowering. Without the second cut, new growth stops. This technique can be used to control height.\n\nDuring the first three years, prune to develop a strong branch scaffold.\n\nMany jujube cultivars can be espaliered to improve fruit accessibility.\n\nLitter: Fruit drop when not harvested, leaves in fall.\n\nPropagation: Cuttings are often grafted onto seedling rootstock. Cuttings of new primary shoots taken late spring to root often develop sufficient roots in two months. Cuttings of woody stems taken late winter may have a higher rooting percentage but take about three months to produce sufficient roots. Root suckers may also be used.\n\nSeed is not true to its parents and seed without cross-pollination is often not viable. Some cultivars of Z. jujuba are vigorous, with fewer thorns and suckers, and should provide rootstock with fewer problems.\n\nProblems and Pests: The most common disease of jujubes in China is Witch's Broom caused by an infectious microorganism.\n\nFruit splitting is caused by heavy rain or over-irrigation near harvest time. Birds and small mammals may raid fruit.\n\nUses: Ornamental, edible fruit eaten fresh, dried, candied, made into the equivalent of apple butter, made into syrup for sweetening teas and dishes, and pitted and preserved in liquor for use in cooking. When fully red-brown and slightly to fully wrinkled, jujube fruit from some cultivars can substitute for dates in recipes.\n\nComments\n\nAnother common name is Chinese Date. Jujubes are high in vitamin C, especially when picked as soon as they are fully red-brown and not sun-dried. If you have not tasted a fresh, fully-ripe jujube, you are missing out on a flavor better than the common apple.\n\nIndian Jujube or Thai Jujube, formerly known as Ziziphus mauritiana, and presently treated as a subspecies of Z. jujuba, is grown for fresh eating. It does not develop a date-like flavor.\n\nInformation on Ziziphus jujuba cultivars was derived in part from studies performed by Shengrui Yao and associates at New Mexico State University.\n\nDo you have additional information or a different experience for these plants that you would like to share?
