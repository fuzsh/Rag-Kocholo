        "text": "This is a post to read out loud just for the sound of the word Ziziphus. It seems to have Greek and Persian roots and the many Ziziphuses Ziziphi Ziziphus species are distributed around not only Asia and Africa but also the Mediterranean.\n\nThe trees all tend to be rather scrubby and thorny with smallish fruits. So far we have found Ziziphus oenoplia and Ziziphus jujuba growing wild; the other native Ziziphuses, Ziziphus nummularia and rugosa, are still on the to find list. Ziziphus xylopyrus too, although some say that it is in fact the same species as Ziziphus jujuba.\n\nWe have spotted Ziziphus oenoplia around Mysore and Mangalore. Its small fruits are almost all seed and no flesh. And often it’s hard to beat the birds to the really ripe, sweet ones.\n\nZiziphus jujuba has bigger, more available fruits. It was in fruit all over coastal Goa on our recent trip there. We kept spotting the ripe fruit lying on roads and paths. Neither tourist nor local seemed remotely interested in them so there were plenty for us to collect. The problem was though that this being Goa you either had to pick the fallen fruit out from among the broken beer bottles, dismembered nappies and biscuit packets, or climb and pluck them from high thorny branches. The fruit is much smaller than its market cultivar but tastes similar: the less ripe greeny ones are crunchy and refreshing, but most prefer to wait for them to become wrinkled and brown and sweet.\n\nHaving just got back from a month in Goa and Bangalore it is a relief to be able to collect our favourite wild edibles from what is an almost pristine landscape here at The Wildside. Long may it last."
