        "text": "Jasmine is one of the important ornamental flower crop widely cultivated and venerate for its attractive fragrant flowers, belonging to the family Oleaceae. Jasmine plant and flower are affected by various insects, mites, diseases and nematodes which pose serious threat to jasmine cultivation. A study was taken up on seasonal pattern and occurrence of insect pests of jasmine in farmer's field at Tiruchirappalli district Tamil Nadu during 2019-2020. During the study around 30 insect species was recorded form the jasmine ecosystem both pest as well as natural enemies. Among them, Budworm, Hendicasis duplifascialis (Hampson), Blossom midge, Contarinia maculipennis (felt), Leaf webworm, Nausinoe geometralis (Guenee) and Red spider mite, Tetranychus urticae (Koch) were found to cause major damage to the jasmine buds and leaves. Out of these insects midge was recorded with maximum incidence during second fortnight of August (34.05 % Infested buds) followed by November second and November first fortnights. Occurrence of Midge are positively correlated with maximum temperature (r = 0.159), minimum temperature (r = 0.505), morning RH (r = 0.006), evening RH (r = 0.142), evaporation (r = 0.143) and rainfall (r = 0.203). Whereas, the population was negatively correlated with wind velocity (r =-0.074) and sunshine hours (r =-0.017). The multiple linear regression equation fitted with weather parameter was Y=-411+4.02MT+3.58mt+1.73RH 1 + 1.05RH 2-5.28 WV-0.81 SS hrs+ 7.77Evapo-0.97 RF. Maximum incidence of budworm was recorded during first fortnight of November (16.26 % Infested buds) followed by October first and August first fortnights. Maximum incidence of leaf webworm was recorded during second fortnight of December (2.2 webs / plant) followed by January first and December first fortnights. The mite population was seen during October first (5.33 mites/leaf) and August second fortnights.\n\nThe vegetables are excellent source as human food and nutrition since immemorial time. Okra, brinjal and tomato are important and indigenous vegetable crops of Pakistan. Varieties of foliage insects invade these vegetable fields and play role positively or negatively. Hence, the present research work was conducted to record the distribution pattern of foliage insects among the summer vegetables viz. okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L.), brinjal (Solanum melongena L.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) under the ecological conditions of district Faisalabad (Punjab), Pakistan along the whole season. Among tomato fields, total 108 species were recorded belonging to 09 orders, 56 families and 100 genera; while among brinjal fields, total 107 species were recorded belonging to 11 orders, 52 families and 100 genera; whereas among okra fields, total 96 species were recorded belonging to 10 orders, 48 families and 88 genera. Among these three vegetable fields, total 7773 specimens were collected during entire sampling and maximum population was recorded from okra fields 44.77% (N = 3480); followed by brinjal fields 31.20% (N = 2425) and least population was recorded from tomato fields 24.03% (N = 1868). Wherein in case of okra fields, maximum population was recorded during 2 nd sampling (704±292.74), followed by 609±225.57 (5 th sampling), 416±89.10 (1 st sampling), 367±54.45 (10 th sampling) and so on. Whereas, species abundance was recorded utmost in 2 nd sampling (38) species at temperature 41 ºC and 27% relative humidity. In case of brinjal fields, maximum population was recorded during 11 th sampling (871±473.00), followed by 270±48.02 (10 th sampling), 207±3.48 (8 th sampling), 188±9.96 (9 th sampling) and so on. Whereas, species abundance was recorded maximum in 10 th sampling (33) species at temperature 28ºC and 92% humidity. In case of tomato fields, maximum population was recorded during 9 th sampling (325±120.03), followed by 187±22.45 (6 th sampling), 178±16.09 (12 th sampling), 160±3.36 (7 th sampling) and so on; wherein species abundance was recorded utmost in 9 th sampling (35) species at temperature 34ºC and 62% humidity. ANOVA among three vegetables (brinjal, okra and tomato) showed non-significant results (F = 0.17; P = 0.8460).\n\nOwing to the importance of the Egyptian leek, Allium ampeloprasum L. Dill, Anethum graveolens L. and parsely, Petroselinum crispum (Mill.) as an important part of medicinal properties and fresh eating. Therefore, the present work was carried out to study the survey, population fluctuation of injured pests and some related climatic factors (temperature and relative humidity) and control the dominant species of pests by Beauveria bassiana. The obtained results cleared that, the three tested plants infested with Aphis gossypii, Myzus persica, Liriomyza trifolii, Tetranychus telarius and Thrips tabaci. The population of T. tabaci recorded high individuals on the three tested plants during two successive seasons. The two climatic factors proved to have no significant effect on the population density of T. tabaci nymph on the three tested plants during two successive seasons. The effect of Beauveria bassiana, illustrated that percent reduction were increasing gradually by time from 3rd to 10th day, whereas biofly liquid solution was more effect formulation than Biover W. P. against T. tabaci nymph on two tested plants A. ampeloprasum and A. graveolens during the two successive seasons.\n\nDuring the course ofstudy appearance of insect-pests started in the month of March coinciding with pink bud stage of apple. Insects belonging to orders Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Thysanoptera, Aracnida and Cucurlionoidae were identified. The relative abundance of insects belonging to order Hemiptera was maximum (32.44 and 32.88) followed by Acarina (23.66 and 22.42%) during 2018 and 2019, respectively. Major insect-pests recoded were Panonychus ulmi, Eriosoma lanigerum and Thrips flavus appeared as major pests in this crop. Maximum population of P. ulmi (5.30/leaf was reported on apple leaves during the month of September. However, the highest percent mean density i.e. 471 and the relative density i.e. 23.05% was reported in P. ulmi followed by T. flavus (385) under high density apple plantation. The Simpson’s Diversity Index were calculated as 0.85 and 0.84, respectively, during 2018 and 2019, which signifies the number of species present, as well as the relative abundance of each species under high density apple plantation\n\nA field experiment was carried out in the experimental area of Entomology Section, Agriculture Research Institute Tandojam during Rabi season of 2008-2009.Seeds of six Brassica varieties i.e. E-R-22, Gaj, P-78, P-53-59,tShiralla and Agati Sarsoon, were sown in a Randomize Complete Block Design during the 4 h week of January. A net plot area of 14 x 46ft was kept for each variety. During observation period four species of sucking insect pests whitefly, aphid, thrip, and painted bug and four species of predators i.e. beetles, chrysoperla carnea, wasp, and spider were observed associated with all six varieties of Brassica. Whitefly appeared in the initial stage of crop on all varieties while the aphid and thrips reached their peak in the end of February. The population of aphid, thrip and painted bug remained in low number. The population of predators was low and remained similar, during the months of December and January. Overall data suggested that the population of insect pests...\n\nIndian jujube known as ber (Ziziphus mauritiana Lam.) is an extremely drought hardy and native fruit of India. However, the quality of fruits and productivity is not obtainable up to the standard. One of the reasons for it is infestation of insect pests on the vegetative as well as developing fruits, which ultimately leads to significant yield loss and quality attributes of the fruits. Though as many as 130 species of insect pests have been recorded in India, only few species have attained the pest status and cause substantial economic damage to ber. A total of 12 insect-pests infesting on ber have been recorded from hot arid region of Rajasthan. Out of these, three insects viz., Ber fruit fly (Carpomyia vesuviana Costa), fruit borer (Meridarchis scyrodes) and stone weevil (Aubeus himalayanus Voss) were recorded as major pests with high infestation rate, whereas two insects (Ber butter fly, Tarucus theophrastus (Fabricius) and thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis (Hood)) were recorded as moderate pests. As many as seven insect pests viz.\n\nThe observations were recorded at Sardarkrushinagar Gujarat during 2021 at fortnightly interval in field from 1st standard meteorological week to 52nd SMW. The damage due of Betousa stylophora Swinhoe ranged between 0.80 and 48.8 per cent with its peak (48.8% twig damage) in 35th SMW, while the leaflet damage due to leaf rolling caterpillar ranged between 0.11 and 12.48 per cent and exhibited its peak (12.48%) during 31st SMW. In case of bark eating caterpillar, the infestation ranged between 2.00 and 10.00 per cent branch damage and reached its peak level (10.00%) during 26th SMW. Commencement of aphid was recorded from 15th SMW with 0.02 aphid index, which reached its first peak (2.78 index) during 24th SMW and second peak (1.12 index) during 31st SMW. Physical factors viz.,minimum temperature (MinT), morning relative humidity (RH1), evening relative humidity (RH2), rainfall (RF) and bright sunshine (BSS) established significant correlation with ‘r’ value of 0.521**, 0.578**, 0.887**, 0.605** and -0.665**, respectively with gall forming black caterpillar. The infestation of leaf rolling caterpillar established significant correlation with MinT (r= 0.592**), RH1 (r= 0.636**), RH2 (r= 0.883**), wind speed (WS) (r= 0.395**), RF (r= 0.521**) and BSS (r= -0.770**). The activity of bark eating caterpillar established significant positive correlation with physical factors viz., MinT (r= 0.436*), RH2 (r= 0.404*) and WS (r= 0.663**) whereas, aphid showed positive association with MinT (r= 0.588*), RH1 (r= 0.424*), RH2 (r= 0.385*) and WS (r= 0.824**).\n\nSeasonal incidence of major insect pests of apple in mid hills of Meghalaya was evaluated during 2018 at the Experimental farm of CPGSAS, Umiam, Meghalaya. A total of 43 insect species were observed. The major ones include-green apple aphid Aphis pomi De Geer, pale tussock moth Calliteara pudibunda L., tussock moth Euproctis guttata Collenette, giant looper Ascotis selenaria Denis and Schiffermuller and cocoa tussock moth Orgyia postica Walker. Also, 21 species were observed as minor pests, ten species as natural enemies, two species as pollinators and five species as occasional visitors. Results revealed that the aphid incidence is at its peak (34.75 aphids/ 10cm apical length of twig/shoot/plant) on the 25 th SMW (standard meteorological week) (3rd week of June 2018). Such a peak of pale tussock moth larval incidence (3.82 larva/ plant) was during 28 th SMW (2 nd week of July). Likewise, the tussock moth larval incidence (4.15 larvae/ plant) was its peak on the 35 th SMW (last week of August). The giant looper was at its peak (3.46 larvae/ plant) in the 28 th SMW (2nd week of July). The cocoa tussock moth incidence was at the maximum of 4.75 larvae/ plant on the 26 th SMW (27 th June). Correlation coefficients (r) indicated significant correlation between the incidence of green apple aphid with maximum temperature; and larval incidence of tussock moth and cocoa tussock moth exhibiting a significant correlation with minimum temperature. Regression analysis done herein will provide the impact of independent variables on the dependent variables.\n\nOkra is attacked by many insect pests in Peshawar, Pakistan. For efficient control of insect pests of okra, population dynamics of insect pests and its associated natural enemies is utmost important. The present research project was carried out at the New Developmental Farm (NDF) of the University of Agriculture, Peshawar (UAP) during 2009. Whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), aphids Aphis gossypii (Glover), leafhopper Amrasca biguttula biguttula (Ishida), leaf beetle Cerotoma trifurcate (Forster), red cotton bug Dysdercus koenigii (Fabricius) were the major insect pests while Ladybird beetle Coccinella septempunctata (Linnaeus), spider Dictyna sp. (Linnaeus) and ant Solenopsis invicta (Buren) were the natural enemies recorded on okra. Densities of insect pests as well as their natural enemies peaked in June-July. Highest density of the pests recorded were 0.81 B. tabaci per leaf on 30th June, 3.56 A. gossypii per leaf on 23 rd June, 47.03 A. biguttula biguttula per leaf on 7 th Jul..."
