Hughes Cara J. Brousseau Katherine G. Breitenbach Kelli J. Flansburg Maureen L. Clements Kristen M. Quaresimo Kayleigh A. Gekakis Wendy L. Harbour Wendy L. Whiteman\n\nWILLIAM J. HOOKS STATE REPORTER\n\nCOPYRIGHT Â© 2017 New York State Unified Court System First Edition Published in 1956.\n\nPREFACE TO THE 2017 EDITION\n\nFor more than 60 years, the New York Law Reports Style Manual has been issued by the Law Reporting Bureau with the approval of the Court of Appeals as a guide for New York judges and their staffs in the preparation of opinions for publication in the Official Reports. It also prescribes the style applied by the Law Reporting Bureau in editing the opinions for publication in the Reports. Although not binding on them, many lawyers find the Manual useful in preparing papers for submission to New York courts. The Style Manual provides a guide for opinion writers and editors in five primary areas: citation, abbreviation, capitalization, quotation, and word style and usage. In addition, it specifies for editors the format and typographical standards for the Reports. Moreover, the Style Manual provides guidance to assist the courts with applying the Unified Court System's policy to protect the personal privacy and safety interests that are implicated in Internet publication of judicial opinions. This Edition continues to add and adapt style rules and policies that promote modern practices emphasizing clarity, brevity and use of plain English in judicial decisions; it also facilitates broad access to the law by encouraging citation of reliable, official sources that are publicly available online at no cost.\n\nGeneral References\n\nThis Manual supplements general citation and style authorities, providing more detail on New York materials and a more specific focus on judicial opinions. General authorities should be consulted on matters not covered by this Manual. These authorities include:\n\nThe Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation (20th ed 2015)\n\nColeen Barger, ALWD Guide to Legal Citation (6th ed 2017)\n\nBryan A. Garner, The Redbook: A Manual on Legal Style (3d ed 2013)\n\nThe Chicago Manual of Style (17th ed 2017)\n\nWebster's Third New International Dictionary (2002), and Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged Online (http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/)\n\nBlack's Law Dictionary (10th ed 2014)\n\nGerald Lebovits, Advanced Judicial Opinion Writing (7.4 ed 2004)\n\nRichard C. Wydick, Plain English for Lawyers (5th ed 2005)\n\nNotes for Use and Important Changes\n\nThe 2017 Edition updates citation formats and examples, adds new examples, clarifies some existing rules, and provides new rules where necessary. It incorporates all electronic updates since 2013. The revisions are premised on the input of the staff of the Law Reporting Bureau and various state courts and other users, and review of various writing and style authorities. In updating and revising the 2017 Edition, the Law Reporting Bureau remained committed to conforming to modern style practices, reducing unnecessary variations from standard style authorities, and compiling an extensive array of citation format examples for New York source material. The most noteworthy of the changes found in this Manual are:\n\n1. Citation Style:\n\nIn accordance with standard authorities and to minimize interruption of text, revised rules clarify the information that should be omitted from subsequent references to cases previously cited in full (1.3 [a]), provide guidance on the proper use of supra and short-form references to previously cited authority (1.3 [b] [2]) and articulate the standard for use of sub nom. in case history (2.2 [a] [5]). In addition, use of short-form citations and id. are encouraged where appropriate and numerous examples of short-form references are included for cases (1.3 [b] [2]), statutes (3.1 [b] [1] [c]) and secondary authorities (1.3 [b] [2]).\n\nThe 2017 Edition embraces the continuing migration of legal research from print to electronic sources by providing guidance on the elements of electronic citation generally (1.5), and updating source specific rules and sample citations for electronic services (2.4 [a]), Internet material (2.4 [a] [3]; 7.1 [d]), CD-ROM material (7.3 [c]), New York Law Journal and other online decisions (2.2 [a] [8]; 2.2 [b] [2], [3]), and e-books (7.9). It adds citation formats for Internet sources that have been cached to avoid link rot (7.1 [d] [3]), sources found in commercial electronic databases (7.1 [d] [8]), and documents appearing in the New York State Courts Electronic Filing System (NYSCEF) (7.7). A new provision differentiates direct and parallel citation of Internet sources (7.1 [d] [7]).\n\nBecause treatises and similar authority published in both print and online often lack consistent page numbering and are not always updated simultaneously, the legend \"[Note: online version]\" is used in this Edition to distinguish examples of citation formats for the same material that is available in both print and online sources. The legend is added to facilitate the author's choice of format for citation to the precise source referenced.\n\nAdditional or revised forms of citation have been provided for commission and agency documents and materials (2.4 [b] [1]); statutes (3.1-3.3; Appendix 4); regulations, court rules and jury instructions (4.1-4.2); and legal periodicals, treatises and other works (7.2-7.6).\n\nThe list of official public domain citations adopted by various jurisdictions was updated (Appendix 2 [D]).\n\nThe rule for citation of out-of-state case law has been revised to direct primary citation to the official, online decisions that are freely available on the Internet (2.3 [c] [1]).\n\nCitation formats have been added for the following sources, among others: the Guide to New York Evidence (New York's first publication of its rules of evidence compiled by Chief Judge DiFiore's Judicial Advisory Committee on Evidence) (4.1 [e]); Model Colloquies for trial judges (drafted and published by the Unified Court System's Criminal Jury Instructions and Model Colloquy Committee) (4.1 [d]); the new Rules for Attorney Disciplinary Matters (4.1 [b] [6]); and documents available online through NYSCEF (7.7).\n\n2. Abbreviation:\n\nThe list of abbreviations for words appearing in parenthetical citations of appellate history, statutes and legislative materials, rules and regulations, treatises and legal documents has been reorganized and rules have been added for capitalization and italicization of those words (Appendix 3).\n\n3. Quotations:\n\nThe Style Manual's section on omitting or altering language in quoted material has been expanded to add examples of proper ellipsis use and revised to clarify the rules governing omissions from or alterations of the source text.\n\nNew rules illustrate the use of an ellipsis to indicate omission of a paragraph(s) from a multi-paragraph quotation (11.1 [c] [1]), and the use of an ellipsis with a period to indicate omission of a full sentence(s) between quoted sentences (11.1 [c] [2]).\n\nThe style for indicating omission of brackets or ellipses from quoted text has been added to rule 11.1 (c) (1).\n\nThe rules governing alterations that appear in the source of a quotation (11.1 [d]) and omission of internal quotation marks from quotations within quotations (11.2 [c]) have been clarified.\n\n4. Word Style and Usage:\n\nThe rule on redaction of personal identifying information has been revised to provide guidance for consistent redaction of personal identifying and other private information throughout particular writings and in related appellate decisions (12.4).\n\nExamples have been added to the list showing the style of particular words, with a continuing modern style emphasis on reducing excessive use of hyphens and capitalization (Appendix 5).\n\nOther Notes:\n\nThe rules on capitalization are essentially unchanged. The general rule that use of \"down style\" (lowercase) is preferred has been explicitly articulated to avoid overuse of capitalization (10.1 [a]).\n\nThe rules on formulation of case summaries (appeal statements) have been updated and examples have been added (Appendix 8). Guidance is now included for use of paragraph and section headings in decisions (13.2). The model citational footnote opinion has been retained (Appendix 7).\n\nExceptions and Changes\n\nDeviations from the rules stated in this Manual are permitted where application of a rule would adversely affect the clarity or readability of an opinion. The Law Reporting Bureau welcomes suggestions for improvement of the Style Manual. Send them to: [email protected].\n\nInternet Version of this Manual\n\nChanges to this Manual will be posted to the Bureau's Internet site at http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/styman_menu.shtml. Use of the Internet version is strongly recommended not only for updates, but also to gain the advantages of word searching, hypertext linking and coordinating use of the Manual with the New York Official Reports Citator.\n\nRULES REQUIRING CITATION TO OFFICIAL REPORTS \"New York decisions shall be cited from the official reports, if any.\" (CPLR 5529 [e].) \"Where New York authorities are cited in any submissions, New York Official Law Report citations shall be included, if available.\" (Rules of Ct of Appeals [22 NYCRR] Â§ 500.1 [g].) \"Where New York authorities are cited in any paper, New York Official Law Report citations must be included.\" (Rules of Ct of Appeals [22 NYCRR] Â§ 510.1 [a].) \"New York decisions shall be cited from the official reports, if any.\" (Rules of

citation itself, pertinent jurisdictional information and year of decision for all full case references, including references to appellate history.\n\n1.1 (b) Statutory Citation Elements\n\n1.1 (c) Citation to Range of Pages, Sections or Similar Elements\n\nSeparate numerals with a hyphen and no spaces. Do not truncate the second numeral in the range.\n\nExample:\n\nPenal Law Â§Â§ 125.21-125.25, not Â§Â§ 125.21-25\n\nJiannaras v Alfant, 27 NY3d 349, 351-352, not 27 NY3d 349, 351-52\n\n1.2 PLACEMENT OF CITATIONS\n\n1.2 (a) Where to Place\n\nCitations in the traditional format of the Official Reports are embedded in the text of the opinion using citations in running text (Â§ 1.2 [b]) or within parentheses (Â§ 1.2 [c]). In this format, citations in footnotes, if any, are styled as provided in section 1.2 (d).\n\nAs an alternative to the traditional format, citations may be placed exclusively in footnotes using the citational footnote style (Â§ 1.2 [e]).\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, the examples in this Manual are shown as citations within parentheses.\n\n1.2 (b) Citations in Running Text\n\nThe term \"citation in running text\" indicates an authority referred to in the text of a sentence, as in the examples below:\n\nThe situation in Rogers v Rogers (63 NY2d 582 [1984], revg 98 AD2d 999 [2d Dept 1983]) mirrors the situation in this decision.\n\nThe clear and convincing evidence standard discussed in Solomon v State of New York (146 AD2d 439, 440 [1st Dept 1989], quoting Addington v Texas, 441 US 418, 427 [1979]) was not met here.\n\nPlaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law Â§ 5102 (d).\n\n1.2 (c) Citations within Parentheses\n\nThe term \"citation within parentheses\" refers to any citation that appears entirely within parentheses.\n\n(1) How to Reference\n\nCitations within parentheses may be referenced as in the examples below:\n\nThe clear and convincing evidence standard was not met here (see Solomon v State of New York, 146 AD2d 439, 440 [1st Dept 1989], quoting Addington v Texas, 441 US 418, 427 [1979]).\n\nThe facts in this decision are not unusual (see George C. Miller Brick Co., Inc. v Stark Ceramics, Inc., 9 Misc 3d 151 [Sup Ct, Monroe County 2005, Fisher, J.]).\n\nPlaintiff did not sustain a serious injury (Insurance Law Â§ 5102 [d]).\n\n(2) Punctuation\n\nPlace the final period in a sentence ending with a parenthetical as follows:\n\nSuch is the law (People v Moran, 2 AD3d 216 [1st Dept 2003]).\n\nor\n\nSuch is the law. (People v Moran, 2 AD3d 216 [1st Dept 2003].)\n\nnot\n\nSuch is the law (People v Moran, 2 AD3d 216 [1st Dept 2003].)\n\nPlace the parenthetical within the sentence (as in first example above) if it relates to the sentence alone. Place it outside the sentence (as in second example above) if it relates to more than one preceding sentence.\n\n1.2 (d) Citations in Footnotes\n\nIn a footnote containing text, citations in running text or within parentheses may be used. Some examples are:\n\n* The holding in Solomon v State of New York (146 AD2d 439, 440 [1st Dept 1989]) remains good law. [Note: running text]\n\n* The issue was last visited in 1989. (Solomon v State of New York, 146 AD2d 439, 440 [1st Dept 1989].) [Note: parenthetical]\n\nIn a footnote containing only a citation, use the parenthetical citation style, but omit the opening and closing parentheses and change the internal brackets to parentheses. Some examples are:\n\n* Solomon v State of New York, 146 AD2d 439, 440 (1st Dept 1989).\n\n* See e.g. Penal Law Â§ 125.25 (1) (a).\n\n1.2 (e) Citational Footnote Style\n\nThe citational footnote style is an alternative to the traditional placement of citations, using footnotes only for the citational content that would otherwise appear in the body of an opinion if either the running text citation style (Â§ 1.2 [b]) or the citations within parentheses style (Â§ 1.2 [c]) were used. If used, the citational footnote style should be used for all citations in the opinion. See Appendix 7 for a model opinion formatted in the citational footnote style. Apply the following rules based upon the location where citational content would be placed in the traditional format.\n\n(1) Running Text Style\n\nPlace the case name in running text and the volumeâreportâpage or other bibliographic information in the footnote and eliminate the parentheses enclosing the citation. The footnote number should be placed at the point in the text where the citation would appear if the citation were placed in the text.\n\nExample:\n\nThe situation in Rogers v Rogers1 mirrors the situation in this decision.\n\n1. 63 NY2d 582 (1984), revg 98 AD2d 999 (2d Dept 1983).\n\n(2) Citations within Parentheses Style\n\nPlace the footnote number at the point where the parenthetical citation would appear if the parenthetical citation were placed in the body of the opinion. Place the citation in the footnote and eliminate the parentheses enclosing the citation.\n\nExample:\n\nThe facts in this decision are not unusual.1\n\n1. See George C. Miller Brick Co., Inc. v Stark Ceramics, Inc., 9 Misc 3d 151 (Sup Ct, Monroe County 2005, Fisher, J.).\n\n(3) Textual Footnotes\n\nWhen using the citational footnote style, citations that appear within textual footnotes should not be placed within parentheses.\n\nExample:\n\n2. The effect of the deregulation on the structure and organization of the natural gas industry is detailed in General Motors Corp. v Tracy, 519 US 278, 283-297 (1997).\n\n1.2 (f) Footnote Numbers in Relation to Punctuation\n\nPlace footnote numbers wherever appropriate to indicate the subject of the reference and after any punctuation marks appearing at that location.\n\nExample:\n\nCounty Court denied defendant's motion;16 the Appellate Division reversed, vacated the judgment, restored the indictment to the preplea stage and reinstated the prosecution's notice of intent to seek the death penalty.17\n\n1.3 REFERENCE TO PREVIOUSLY CITED AUTHORITY\n\n1.3 (a) Options for Referencing Previously Cited Authority\n\nTo reference previously cited authority use a short-form reference or \"id.\" where appropriate. A full citation may be repeated if a short form or id. is unsuitable. The subsequent citation should omit any reference to jurisdiction, date and optional information (Â§ 2.2 [a] [7]), and history. A short-form reference should provide sufficient information to avoid confusion with distinct previous citations.\n\n1.3 (b) Short-Form References\n\n(1) Shortened Case Names and Popular Names\n\nSubsequent references to a case in running text or within parentheses may use a shortened case name. The shortened form of the case name is usually the name of the first nongovernmental party (for example, \"Krom\" for \"People v Krom\" and \"Albouyeh\" for \"Albouyeh v County of Suffolk\"). Popular names for cases (for example, \"the Central Park Jogger case\") may be used when desired.\n\n(2) Shortened Citations\n\nDo not use \"supra\" to shorten a subsequent citation. Do not add \"supra\" to a full citation of a source that has been previously cited in full. See section 12.6 for use of \"supra\" and \"infra\" as internal cross-references. Subsequent references to cases and statutes may be shortened as follows:\n\n(Matter of Murphy, 6 NY3d at 43)\n\n(Murphy, 6 NY3d 36) [Note: shortened case name with citation to initial page of decision]\n\n(Murphy, 6 NY3d at 43)\n\n(Murphy at 43)\n\n(6 NY3d at 43)\n\n(Matter of Murphy) or (Murphy) or (see Murphy) [Note: general reference to a previously cited case using only the full or shortened case name (use of a signal is optional)]\n\n(Â§ 205.05)\n\nSubsequent references to periodicals, treatises and similar works may be shortened by omitting the author's name or the title, in whole or in part, as follows:\n\n(Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird 49-50 [1982]) [Initial]\n\n(Harper Lee [or Lee] at 53) [Subsequent]\n\n(David H. Kaye et al., The New Wigmore: Expert Evidence Â§ 4.5 at 148 [2004]) [Initial]\n\n(Expert Evidence Â§ 4.7) [Subsequent]\n\n1.3 (c) Subsequent Reference to Immediately Preceding Authority\n\nWhen a subsequent reference is made to an immediately preceding authority, \"id.\" may be used:\n\n(id.) [Note: identical reference to an immediately preceding authority]\n\n(id. at 495) [Note: reference to an immediately preceding authority at a different page]\n\n(id. Â§ 468-a) [Note: reference to an immediately preceding authority at a different section]\n\n(id. Â§ 130-1.2) [Note: reference to an immediately preceding NYCRR citation at a different section. Use section symbol with id.]\n\nCapitalize \"Id.\" when it is the first term in a separate citational sentence (Â§ 1.2 [c] [2]).\n\n1.3 (d) Subsequent Reference to Parallel Citations\n\nWhere parallel citations are provided in the first reference, subsequent references that include a pinpoint page should supply the pinpoint page for each parallel citation. Thus, (Newbold v Arvidson, 105 Idaho 663, 672 P2d 231 [1983]) becomes (Newbold, 105 Idaho at 667, 672 P2d at 235).\n\n1.4 INTRODUCTORY SIGNALS\n\n1.4 (a) Citations Introduced by Signals\n\nCitations may be introduced by signals that indicate the purpose for which the citations are made and their degree of support or contradiction concerning a proposition. Do not place a comma between the signal and citation. Consult standard citation authorities for information regarding the use of signals, their order when using two or more and the order of authorities after each signal.\n\nThe following examples illustrate the use of introductory signals:\n\n(e.g. Dalton v Pataki, 5 NY3d 243 [2005])\n\n(see Dalton v Pataki, 5 NY3d 243 [2005])\n\n(but see Dalton v Pataki, 5 NY3d 243 [2005])\n\n(cf. Matter of Oglesby v McKinney, 28 AD3d 153 [4th Dept 2006])\n\n(but cf. Matter of Oglesby v McKinney, 28 AD3d 153 [4th Dept 2006])\n\n(accord Matter of Oglesby v McKinney, 28 AD3d 153 [4th Dept 2006])\n\n(see also Penal Law Â§ 20.00)\n\n(compare Penal Law Â§ 210.40, with CPL 320.10)\n\n(see e.g. CPL 40.50)\n\n(but see e.g. People v McConnell, 11 Misc 3d 57 [App Term, 2d Dept, 9th & 10th Jud Dists 2006])\n\n(see generally People v McConnell, 11 Misc 3d 57 [App Term, 2d Dept, 9th & 10th Jud Dists 2006])\n\n(compare Klein v Eubank, 87 NY2d 459 [1996], with Shapiro v McNeill, 92 NY2d 91 [1998])\n\n(compare Klein v Eubank, 87 NY2d 459 [1996], and D'Amico v Crosson, 93 NY2d 29 [1999], with Shapiro v McNeill, 92 NY2d 91 [1998])\n\n(contra Koehler v Koehler, 182 Misc 2d 436 [Sup Ct, Suffolk County 1999])\n\n1.4 (b) Signal Word Serving as a Verb\n\nDo not italicize a signal word that serves as a verb of a sentence:\n\nFor a discussion of Executive Law Â§ 63 (2), see Matter of Johnson v Pataki (91 NY2d 214 [1997]).\n\n1.5 ELECTRONIC SOURCES IN GENERAL\n\nCite an electronic source if it is the sole source of material referenced or if the print version is not readily available. A citation to an electronic source requires information identifying the particular material referenced, and is likely also to require information about the location where the source of that material may be accessed (e.g. a website or an online service). Where the location or content of an electronic source is subject to change, a \"last updated\" or \"last accessed\" date should be included. If the format of an electronic source prevents precise citation to particular material referenced, add the necessary navigation instructions to the citation. Pinpoint citation is not possible if the electronic source is in a format (e.g. HTML) that does not contain fixed reference points, but may be included if the source is in a format (e.g. PDF) that contains fixed pagination, paragraph numbering or location numbers. Electronic government sources designated \"official\" or authenticated by some method involving encryption should be cited when available. The rules for citing specific types of electronic sources appear in the sections listed below. In addition, the legend \"[Note: online version]\" is used in this Manual to distinguish examples of citation formats for the same material that is available in both print and online sources.\n\n1.5 (a) Electronic Services\n\nElectronic services (e.g. Westlaw, Lexis) are cited as indicated in section 2.4 (a) (1) and (2).\n\n1.5 (b) Internet Material\n\nInternet material is cited as indicated in section 2.4 (a) (3) and section 7.1 (d).\n\n1.5 (c) CD-ROM Material\n\nCD-ROM material is cited as indicated in section 7.3 (c).\n\n1.5 (d) New York Slip Opinions\n\nSlip opinions scheduled for publication in the print Official Reports are cited as indicated in section 2.2 (a) (8).\n\n1.5 (e) Unreported and Unofficially Reported New York Opinions Published Online\n\nTrial court and Appellate Term opinions published online only with or without abstracts published in the print Official Reports are cited as indicated in section 2.2 (b) (2).
