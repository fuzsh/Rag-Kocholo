        "text": "WAYLAND -- When he stands in back of his white two-story Main Street farmhouse, John Blomgren, a white-haired man with a wide, weathered face, can still see the neighborhood of his childhood.\n\nSquinting through watery blue eyes, he envisions the places he used to pick blueberries with friends, the rows of corn he grew and the chickens raised in a hen house no longer there. When he married and started his own family here, his five children used to take a boat out on the small springtime pond in the field beside his house. In the winter, the neighborhood children skated there.\n\nBlomgren has lived in Wayland his entire 77 years and lived in this home since he moved here with his parents when he was 15.\n\n\"At one time, I knew everyone in this town,\" he said.\n\nBut Blomgren is part of a diminishing minority that can still call Wayland a hometown. For a growing number of newer residents, Wayland is the quiet bedroom community with the stellar school system just the right distance from the city, the perfect place to build a dream home.\n\nNearly one-third of Wayland homeowners moved here between 1995 and March 2000, according to the most recent available census data.\n\nThose changing demographics have transformed many areas of Wayland. But change came particularly hard to Blomgren's neighborhood when a new subdivision sprouted behind his home five years ago. And with the new homes came new neighbors with a very different vision of what a Wayland neighborhood should be.\n\nThe changing face of Wayland is driven by a simple maxim. As Mark Twain once said, \"Buy land, they're not making it anymore.\"\n\nSince the 1990s, larger and larger homes are being built in Wayland to capitalize on soaring land values, said Joseph Laydon, the town planner.\n\nIn the face of this increasing housing development, many in Wayland have clung hard to the idea of the small town feel and semi-rural character espoused in the town's master plan. Opponents to the Town Center bylaw decried the creation of a \"mall\" in town, and override opponents claimed the tax hike would come at the expense of longtime residents while barely affecting inhabitants of the so-called \"McMansions.\"\n\nLaydon, who has worked for Wayland six years, has also seen these tensions simmer in the contrasting expectations of old neighbors and new ones.\n\n\"When a new development comes in, with a new mentality, there's often a difference of opinion between new and existing residents as far as neighborhood character,\" he said.\n\nThat character is visible in the trend toward bigger houses, as Laydon has seen new and larger homes dwarfing smaller ones.\n\nNew mansions\n\nThe average home among new subdivisions built in Wayland in the past five years is assessed at $1.6 million -- nearly two and a half times the average residential property in town, based on records at Town Hall.\n\nThe Spencer Circle subdivision is one of these new subdivisions. Completed in 2002, the cul-de-sac of five colonial homes stands on the former field and pond along Blomgren's property that, 30 years ago, no one dreamed of building on.\n\nBut Laydon said because open space is so rare, and land prices so high, it's now worth the investment to use expensive new technologies to transform once marginal land into buildable lots.\n\n\"Land that never would have been developed is being developed wherever they can take advantage of new septic technology and stormwater management,\" he said.\n\nIn the case of the $1.2 million home of Gordon and Evlyn Schultz, a lawyer and his wife who moved to Spencer Circle for Wayland's top-rated school system, the builder had to raise the grade of the land up to 6 feet to install the septic system, and build a 6-foot concrete retaining wall to hold the raised land in place. Town officials signed off on the necessary permits, according to records in Town Hall.\n\nAs a result, where there was once open space, Blomgren now had a neighbor whose property was raised over his with a clear view down into his yard.\n\nThen the complaints began.\n\nIn January 2003, five months after the Schultzes moved in, they filed a complaint with the Building Department about Blomgren's home-based electrical contracting business, citing excessive noise and fumes from the trucks that came and went from the property.\n\nIn 1969, Blomgren had obtained a special permit for his business, which he started after serving in the military.\n\nHe said he didn't know he was supposed to renew the permit annually, and that the neighbors had never complained before.\n\n\"The business has been here for over 50 years. It should be grandfathered, really,\" said Blomgren, a man who said he has conducted $100,000 deals for electrical jobs on a handshake.\n\nIn a letter opposing Blomgren's application for a special permit, the Schultzes presented a different point of view: \"The new subdivision at Spencer Circle has magnified the character of the surrounding neighborhood as a residential area....For the price that each resident of Spencer Circle paid for their home...they are entitled to enjoy their property free from the interference of a commercial business enterprise.\"\n\nElsewhere in the letter, they stated: \"This is what the by-laws require the applicant to do: to find a business away from the residence. Any claim of a 'financial hardship' in doing so is of no relevance to the strictures of the by-law.\"\n\nFour longtime neighbors testified at the Zoning Board of Appeals hearing in April 2003 that they had not been bothered by excessive traffic, fumes or noise. But Blomgren lost on appeal, and in July moved his trucks to a $600-per-month garage in Framingham.\n\nBattles over bylaws\n\nOne month later, the Schultzes turned their sights on neighbors to the other side of their property. Those neighbors, Maralyn MacGillivray and Montajean Neil, had set up a 5-foot metal portable clothesline with a cement base on a restricted easement along the Schultzes' property.\n\nOnce MacGillivray and Neil had the clothesline removed to their own property upon the Schultzes' request, the Schultzes claimed it did not meet the 15-foot setback requirements for a permanent structure.\n\nIn a letter to the Building Department, MacGillivray and Neil wrote, \"Mrs. MacGillivray actually suffered an angina attack after the first letter (from the Schultzes) because of harassing and the rather threatening tone to the letter.\"\n\nWhen the Wayland Zoning Board of Appeals did not find the clothesline to be a permanent structure, the Schultzes appealed the ruling in Land Court.\n\nWhen asked in an interview what she found offending about the clothesline, Evlyn Schultz responded, \"Oh, nothing. It's not bothersome at all.\"\n\nShe said the question is one of law.\n\nMeanwhile, the Schultzes brought a complaint with the Building Department against John Brady, a former Wayland Police officer and mechanic who lived at 39 Peck Ave., for maintaining a junkyard at his property. Brady cleaned the debris from his yard, which is visible from the Schultz home through the trees across the street.\n\nIn December, the Schultzes filed another complaint with the Building Department against Blomgren for the pickup truck, two boats and a backhoe he keeps on his property. The Schultzes contend Blomgren's property met the definition of a junkyard.\n\n\"Their presence continues to demean the character of the neighborhood,\" the Schultzes wrote.\n\nEvlyn Schultz said she has not considered a fence, but does not see what good it would do.\n\nRather, she says the town has failed to adequately support their subdivision by allowing the builder to remove trees on her property. She also thinks that Spencer Circle should have become a public road by now, complete with street lights. And, the town has failed, she said, to ensure their neighbors abide by state and local laws.\n\nThis could have been avoided.\n\nShe blames the town for allowing the Spencer Circle subdivision to be built in the first place and she regrets moving to Wayland.\n\n\"Please don't vote a new area in if you don't need it, don't want it and are not going to support it,\" she said.\n\nBut she warned the town won't get the hefty tax revenues, either.\n\n\"Don't let the new areas come in, then see what happens to your town,\" she said.\n\nIn an appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals of the building inspector's decision regarding the boats and vehicles on Blomgren's property, the Schultzes included both a justification and a prediction.\n\n\"Finally, it is appropriate to observe that the Town approved the Spencer Circle Subdivision and, since 2002, has received very substantial tax dollars from all of the residents therein, including Schultz. As such, it is the Town's obligation to provide support (to) the subdivision so as to maintain its nature and character as parts of the older portion of the Town are replaced with new developments,\" they wrote.\n\nAs time passes, older residents are also being replaced. John Brady died last June at the age of 85. The Land Court case against MacGillivray and Neil was dropped when the two women, who lived in their home nearly 20 years, moved out of Wayland.\n\nOutside the strictures of law, Evlyn Schultz was asked if she feels for what the neighbors have gone through.\n\n\"No, I don't have empathy,\" she said. \"The world has changed. This is life today. If you're going to live in Wayland, you have to abide by the bylaws.\"\n\nBlomgren won the April 24 decision before the Zoning Board of Appeals, which ruled that his property -- which is landscaped with a vegetable garden, flowerbeds, and an ivy-covered trellis -- is not a junkyard, under the definition in town bylaws. But it's a battle won in a war that he believes is lost.\n\nJust over a week ago, the Schultzes filed an appeal to the ZBA's decision and are taking Blomgren to Land Court. He says he can't handle the stress, financially and emotionally.\n\n\"It's destroyed my life,\" he said. \"My wife's a nervous wreck, and she's a super girl.\"\n\nHe said he has also lost his privacy, since the abutting property is higher than his yard. The 3-foot fir trees he planted along the border with the Schultzes' yard as a screen will not grow quickly enough to be for his benefit.\n\n\"It'll be another 20 years\" before they're tall enough, he said. \"I'll be dead.\"\n\nBlomgren estimates that attorney fees have cost him over $6,000. He wants to contest the town's approval of the concrete retaining wall that allowed the Schultzes' home to be built in the first place, which he believes is a permanent structure that violates setback requirements. But to prove that point in court could take another $10,000 in fees, he said.\n\n\"They only listen to lawyers. And I can't afford it,\" he said.\n\nStanding in his side yard, he looks out over the nearly unrecognizable land, past the yellow forsythia, and beyond the street where his parents are buried in Lakeview Cemetery.\n\n\"I thought I would die here,\" he said. \"I've had a good life, I'm very lucky. But I don't want this.\"\n\nBlomgren and his wife have survived many of the changes that have touched Wayland. Blomgren's electrical business saved him from the fate of his fellow farmers who were forced out of town by higher land values. When his aging mother lived in the family house and could not keep up with rising taxes, Blomgren paid them for her.\n\nBut the Blomgrens will not outlast this latest change. He and his wife have decided to move to Maine to be near two of their children.\n\nHe is adamant that many of the young families living in Spencer Circle are very nice. But for the people who will inherit Wayland, Blomgren feels sorry.\n\n\"I see a generation growing up that doesn't trust people. They're afraid to open up to people, afraid to be friendly. They don't want to establish roots and are here temporarily,\" he said. \"What's more important now is keeping up with the Joneses rather than taking care of a family. It's why they're running so much, and working so hard.\"\n\nThe future of the town is in their hands now.\n\n\"I've learned one thing in life,\" Blomgren said. \"Never look back.\""
