        "text": "Grand Ledge (aka Oak Park)\n\n46 Miles Away | 179 Routes\n\nSunny sandstone top roping and bouldering crag in the lower peninsula of Michigan right on the Grand River. The cliff is 40 feet tall and offers very bouldery, challenging climbs and problems.The cliff faces south and receives sun most of the day with the majority of wind blocked as well. While the rock quality is pretty good on established classics, other areas can be quite chossy, so be careful.When the weather is nice, evenings and weekends will be busy, and many ropes will be hung. Typically, ropes and areas are shared spaces, but it is still essential to check the anchor build up top before climbing. This is a great way to start climbing at the park, joining several locals who have many routes already set and can point a new climber in the right direction. There is no guiding within the park, but all the skills required are fairly basic and can be learned quickly with some application and someone that knows what they are doing. Mountain Project has divided Oak Park into Bouldering and Top Roping sections for ease of use. Within these style specific styles, you can find much more information including top rope hangs, projects, smaller area guides in the menu lower on the page and it is still being added to. The intended goal of this site is to document as much history as possible and give the user the best guide possible to climb at Oak Park. Suggestions are always welcome.Typically, top ropes are anchored around one of the large trees at the cliff side. Webbing should always go to the base of the tree minimizing harm to the tree and creating a safer anchor for climbing. Carabiners should be hung over the lip and somewhere they are dangling to avoid rope drag on the rock. Lastly, carpeting or some material should be under the webbing on the edge of cliff to prevent damage from potential movement of the webbing used to build the anchors. Redundant system throughout the anchor and opposing and locking biners for the rope to go through are standard within Oak Park.Unique Rules to Grand Ledge:(1) No lead climbing.(2) Guiding at Oak Park is done by permit only through the City of Grand Ledge.(3) Must place carpet below your anchors to protect cliff from erosion. You will see how soft the rock is and all the marking from webbing and rope.(4) No Rappelling.(5) No alcohol. (6) No top roping over the Ballerina Bulge or west of the signs near the overlook.Classic climbs/problems include:Chips: 5.7Black Buttress: 5.9Doug's Roof: 5.10Rocket Man: 5:10V3 DespondencyV3 The TrickV5 BallerinaV7 Enigma Find Grand Ledge, Michigan (use Map Quest or Google). Then head through downtown along Bridge St. Once you cross the bridge, hang a left on the first street which is Front Street. You will drive though a subdivision until you dead end at dirt parking lot for Oak Park. The approach to the cliff is obvious; simply hike down towards the river via trails that take you down to where the cliff breaks down on both sides.Toads is located at 223 North Bridge Street, literally just a few blocks down from Oak Park. They carry equipment and have a great menu as well.\n\nTop Rope\n\n46 Miles Away | 81 Routes\n\nThis a listing of all rope routes at Grand Ledge. Add boulder problems to that sub-area. Sunny sandstone crag in the lower peninsula of Michigan right on the Grand River. The cliff is 40ish feet tall and offers bouldery, challenging routes. The cliff faces south and receives sun most of the day with the majority of wind blocked as well. It exists in Oak Park, which is managed by the city of Grand Ledge. Fitzgerald Park, across the river, does not allow climbing at any time for any reason and was part of the concession the climbing community accepted for continued access at Oak Park. While the rock quality is pretty good on established classics, other areas can be quite chossy, so be careful. There is NO top roping on the west end past the signs posted west of the overlook. There is NO top roping above the Ballerina Bulge as this is a choke point in the trail below and the rock is brittle creating bombs for those below. Please be respectful of this when setting top rope placements.Classic rope routes include:Chips: 5.7Black Buttress: 5.9Doug's Roof: 5.10Rocket Man: 5:10Intimidator: 5.11Cowabunga: 5.11Ragged Edge: 5.12HANGSThis is a crucial aspect to the safety of all and protection of the rock we climb. LOCAL RULES dictates that padding needs to be under your webbing. Your webbing should run over the lip of the rock and not above. This prevents your rope acting as a saw on the soft sandstone and wrecking your rope. Two anchors should be used for every hang while equalizing the system. If you have any questions ask one of the locals out there, everyone is pretty good about sharing and assisting.1. Brachiator/ Potato Chips - Hang off the chains a couple feet to the right of the large slot. Hanging it to the right, west, will give you a clean hang protecting both your rope and the rock.2. Blowout /Cowabunga - The same hang is used for both climbs and is located between the chains of Doug’s Roof and the trees for Rocket Man. For Cowabunga there is an eroded slot the webbing can hang from and for Blowout hang to the right of this slot so the rope does not interfere with the key hold. The rope will rub for both climbs regardless of where you put it.3. Desperado - Climb from Rocket Man rope, as the fall is clean even high on the route. This prevents bad rope drag on sharp edges on falls, doesn’t block the key hold of the route and gives you a fun swing.4. Despondency - Hang from left side of the tree above the bowl in the rock. The rope will hang directly on the route.5. Doug’s Roof - Hang from the chains protecting the rock with carpet from your carabineers.6. Let Me Go Wild - Hang from the extremely curved tree above the large roof. Put the webbing high or far enough out on the tree so the rope hangs clean.7. Ragged Edge - Climb from Rocket Man rope, as the fall is clean even high on the route. The climber needs to pull the rope around the corner as they climb.8. Rocket Man - Hang from large trees into slot of the roots of a tree directly above the corner of the route. Use carpet on the tree. This is the accepted local way to hang the route to protect the rock and the tree is strong. The hang has been like this for years now. Climbing started at Oak Park back in the 1940s with a couple of students from Michigan State University, Victoria and Don Borthwick. At the time, aid was the norm, using pins and other hardware to scale the rock. A couple of pins can still be seen in the Let Me Go Wild roof near the center of the rock band. They were gone by 1950 and little is known about the climbing within the park until the late 1960s. In the early 1970s, top roping took over as the ethic within the park because the brittle sandstone could not hold gear. With the ample number of trees on the top of the wall, top rope was born. With the elimination of ground falls, climbing became safer overall, and the number of problems expanded dramatically throughout the park. Popular routes such as 5.7 Potato Chips, 5.9+ Doug's Roof and 5.10 Rocket Man were established in the early years of Oak Park. In the late 1960s, a climber named Bruce Bright found Grand Ledge and has been there ever since. Known as The Godfather of Oak Park, he simply has too many first accents to list them all, but they include 5.11 Despondency (prior to be chipped), 5.12 Inappropriate Behavior and 5.11 X-Rated. Bill Putnam became a fixture in the park, climbing with Bruce and establishing a large number of climbs including 5.6 Extension, 5.7 Three Mules, 5.10 Finesse, 5.10 Ludwig's Dude and 5.12 Intergalactic Quaalude Trip as the golden era of climbing within the park was underway.Later in 1970s, more climbers started coming with the intention of pushing up the level within Oak Park. This became the time of the \"Grand Ledge Rats\" and heightened development of routes throughout the park. Climbers such as Frank Abissi, Kevin Cieszkowski, Dave Poxson, Jeff Purdy, Jeff Shroup, David Hull, Eric James, the Nienhaus brothers and Jeff McWhorter started frequenting the park and established several new lines that are still considered Oak Park Classics today. These include 5.12 Ragged Edge, 5.13a Enigma, 5.13b Franks Climb, 5.13b Reflections, 5.12 Clean and Jerk. This period was also known for \"soloing,\" with climbers going to the top without a rope. Climbing up and down became the norm on popular routes such as 5.7 Potato Chips and 5.9+ Doug's Roof, as well as 5.11 Despondency, 5.10 Rocket Man, the Reflections Wall, parts of the Mermaid Wall, and many others. In the late 1990s, bouldering started grabbing hold of Oak Park. Instead of just climbing the beginning of the top rope routes like Despondency or the Trick, true boulder problems were established with low starts and top outs, pushing the overall level of difficulty within the park. Climbers such as Jamie Emerson developed numerous lines that were intended for bouldering in its own right. The test piece that resulted was V9 Resistance, established in 2000, the hardest problem in the park for 12 years. Other climbers, including Adam Page, Mike Slaven, Aaron Hager and Dan Blake, contributed problems such as V5 Suicide Machine, V5 Ride or Die, V6 Climb or Die and V7 Another Mother. The early 2000s saw continued development in bouldering by exploring the possibilities of eliminates. In 2008, V6 Max Scene Arete and V5 Thailand were established by Michael Rathke. This marked the end of the majority of development within Oak Park, with 95% of the lines we climb today established, recorded and repeated. Development slowed to a halt until 2012 when Dylan Barks establised V9 Fifty Words for Mank and V10 D-Bag. Brendan Baars established V9 Mass Hysteria in 2017, completing a long-time local project and hardest line up the Ballerina Bulge. During the winter of 2020-21 a few old lines were \"rediscovered,\" as they had just fallen off all guidebooks. These include V4 Wall Street, V5 Pick Your Battles, and V6 Mermaid Direct. Over the season, ten more lines were added, including V8 Peace, V7 Anastasis, V6 Homeostasis and V5 The Treat, some with brutal starts. Of the 100+ climbs listed, only seven go at V8 or harder with Dylan Barks's V10 D-Bag remaining the hardest line since his FA in 2012. There is still plenty of rock that lacks lines, just needs the right climber to see the problem. For over 50 years Bruce Bright has been a presence within Oak Park offering any type of assistance to anyone asking. From answering history questions on the park or rock to loaning climbers his equipment he has always been there.
