Which is very appropraite because the area is known for having a large deer population which is in constant conflict with the area residents. As a result the town has introduced a bait and shoot program where police go out into the remaining wooded areas and shoot the deer. The program was recently put on hold after a stray bullet ended up in someones house.\n\nFollow the $$\n\nCyburbian\n\nMessages\n\n126\n\nPoints\n\n6\n\nApr 17, 2005\n\n#7\n\nJeff_Rosenberg said:\n\nSounds like the saying:\n\n\"Suburbs are where you cut down all the trees and name the streets after them\"\n\nOr Joel Garreau's observation that subdivisions are often named after whatever was there before they bulldozed it.\n\nMaybe there is a former celestial village on the site.\n\nModerator note:\n\nImage deleted for image leeching. 24 hour suspension in effect on 4/19/05\n\nhttp://www.dreams-nonsense.net/waking/celestial.jpg\n\nLast edited by a moderator: Apr 19, 2005\n\nTrinity Moses\n\nMember\n\nMessages\n\n229\n\nPoints\n\n9\n\nApr 17, 2005\n\n#8\n\nFollow the $$ said:\n\nDo developers in my neck of the woods just have very poor taste in subdivision names or is this a common problem throughout the country?\n\nIn Louisville there is a sudivision called \"The Garden of Eden\", and it had two streets.

It is becoming an issue now in Dublin, as street names, which used to be bilingual (Gaelic and English) are now English only. This leads to a very Anglicised translation of what the Gaelic words sound like in English, (example Fuar Cnoc, in Gealic means \"Cold Hill\", but it has been translated for marketing purposes into \"Four knocks\" because it is easier on the tounge). I think that using something like \"Paddy's Row for a development is quite important, in that it gives a definite historical context as to who lived in an area over time. Over time, as people live in an area, such place names become innofensive and a part of the areas character. I live in an area of the city which isnt far from a road historically called \"Misery Hill\". Very expensive apartments were built there recently and the developer and new inhabitants saw the marketing opportunity it presented straight away. That said \"field of dreams\" is a bridge too far. Who is going to swallow that one?\n\nSuburb Repairman\n\nmoderator in moderation\n\nMessages\n\n8,053\n\nPoints\n\n55\n\nApr 18, 2005\n\n#14\n\nFIELD OF DREAMS!?!?!\n\nThat is horrible!

Hmmm, do we allude to the history or do we try to mask it altogether? Any suggestions? Asylum Acres, The Happy Forest, Freudian Fields, Jungian Estates?

By the way is a subdivision what we over here would call an estate? I'm assuming as much as they certainly sound the same.\n\nWe too have some classic new street names. Most developers take a theme when naming the new streets; eg Rivers, Trees, Birds or quite commonly, Racecourses. One of my favourite ones is an estate from the 1970s in a place called Tamworth, which is a new town near Birmingham. This estate is all named after famous astronauts; so you can choose to live at 72 Armstrong, or 16 Gagarin. :-D\n\nDan\n\nADHDP / Dear Leader\n\nMessages\n\n20,660\n\nPoints\n\n72\n\nOct 21, 2022\n\n#37\n\nOld post, I know, but for some reason visitors have been looking at it.\n\nUpstate New York is still stuck in the 1960s when it comes to subdivision names. (Municipalities in UNY also don't put much effort, if any, into place branding.) Most new subdivision names either have either a generic sylvan theme, or evoke Ye Olde Coloniale times. Nothing hip. Nothing that evokes \"lifestyle\" or \"wellness\". Absolutely no \"Something at Somethingelse\". It's still old school crap like Forest Glen, Deerhaven, and Mayflower Woods.\n\nLet's compare.
