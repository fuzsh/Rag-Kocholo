        "text": "For many people around the world, New York City means Manhattan. But, to truly know NYC, one should know at least a bit about all five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island.\n\nThis post is a brief guide to the 5 boroughs and some suggestions of what to see in each of them.\n\nWhen writing this post, I talked to my fellow local walking tour guides about their impressions of the 5 boroughs and in particular, the borough where they live and have lived in over the years.\n\nI was born in Brooklyn and live there now, though I have lived in Manhattan in the past. Other guides live all over New York City.\n\nBetween all of us, we have a solid sense of what makes each borough special. Below we tell you what you should see in each of the 5 boroughs!\n\nWhat is a Borough?\n\nManhattan\n\nBrooklyn\n\nStaten Island\n\nBronx\n\nQueens\n\nWhat is a Borough?\n\nA borough (pronounced burrow) is a formal subdivision of a city. Boroughs are not unique to NYC. London and Montreal also have boroughs.\n\nNYC has five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten Island.\n\nYou may find people who think New York City has 7 boroughs because they include nearby Jersey City and Hoboken, cities in the state of New Jersey.\n\nThese cities have a very close connection to NYC as tens of thousands of people who live in those two cities commute daily into NYC.\n\nIn terms of government, each NYC borough has its own local government but ultimately their power is superseded by NYC laws.\n\nEach borough has a borough president, but New York City has one mayor who governs over all 5 boroughs.\n\nIn this post, we describe the five boroughs and go over the top attractions and neighborhoods within them.\n\nBorough vs. Neighborhood\n\nAs noted above, boroughs are parts of a city with formal boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, neighborhoods are defined areas within each borough who also have local governments (community boards) though they have little sway.\n\nJust a few well-known formal neighborhoods are SoHo, Midtown Manhattan, Chinatown, Upper East Side, Greenwich Village, and West Village.\n\nBut here is the tricky part. There are sub-neighborhoods that are simply small areas within formal neighborhoods,\n\nFor example, the Meatpacking District is a sub-neighborhood in the northwest corner of the neighborhood of the West Village!\n\nOur post, New York City Neighborhoods Explained, may help make this clearer!\n\nOne final note, Long Island is not part of the 5 boroughs. Long Island is not even part of New York City. It is literally a long island!\n\nTwo of NYC's boroughs are geographically on the island, but at some point on the east end of those boroughs there is a border where New York City ends and Long Island's two counties, Suffolk and Norfolk, begin.\n\nThe Borough of Manhattan\n\nManhattan feels like the center of New York City and rightfully so. It is where New York City was settled back in 1624 (then as Dutch New Amsterdam).\n\nMany of its iconic attractions, like Times Square, the Empire State Building, and Central Park, are known around the world.\n\nThough geographically small, compared to the other four boroughs, there are over 60 neighborhoods, many of which deserve a visit.\n\nIt’s also where most tourists stay since there are hundreds of hotels, with 70 hotels in Times Square alone.\n\nWhat to See in Manhattan\n\nTimes Square\n\nKnown around the world for its New Year's Eve gathering and the ball drop, Times Square is a must-see neighborhood.\n\nThere’s nothing quite like its energizing atmosphere.\n\nIn addition to seeing Broadway shows, there are lots of things to do in Times Square. Find out here.\n\nCentral Park\n\nCentral Park is a whopping 6% of Manhattan's land area! It’s so big that it would take you all day and some of the night to see it all!\n\nFrom its spacious grand lawns to its wooded areas and bodies of water, Central Park is not to be missed.\n\nBe sure to read our Things to Do in Central Park when you plan your outing!\n\nMidtown Manhattan\n\nMidtown is the center of NYC. Hundreds of thousands of people work here or pass through this part of Manhattan via Grand Central Terminal on their way to work in other parts of Manhattan.\n\nMidtown is where you will find the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, the Museum of Modern Art and much more.\n\nIt’s also where the largest concentration of hotels are. See our post on where to stay in NYC with specific listings in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nLower Manhattan\n\nThis part of Manhattan has some great attractions and historic sights.\n\nIt’s where you’ll find Wall Street, the 9/11 Memorial, and One World Observatory with its breathtaking views of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and beyond.\n\nIt’s also where you catch the ferry to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.\n\nThe Top Neighborhoods in Manhattan to Visit\n\nOf the nearly 60 neighborhoods in Manhattan, these are the ones you should definitely consider checking out.\n\nChances are you have them on your list of places to see already!\n\nHarlem\n\nGreenwich Village\n\nLower East Side\n\nLittle Italy\n\nSoHo\n\nChinatown\n\nChelsea and the High Line\n\nRead more about New York City’s neighborhoods and what there is to do in each of them.\n\nThe Borough of Brooklyn\n\nWith an estimated population of 2.6 million, Brooklyn is home to the most number of New Yorkers.\n\nIf it were its own city, it would be the fourth largest city in the United States.\n\nThere are over 70 neighborhoods, and Brooklyn has an enormous diversity of ethnic backgrounds, architectural styles, and great food!\n\nFrom hipsters and street art to historic neighborhoods and amazing skyline views of Manhattan, Brooklyn has something for everyone.\n\nThings to See and Do in Brooklyn\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge\n\nCrossing the Brooklyn Bridge is something that tourists and locals love to do.\n\nCompleted in 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was a feat of engineering at the time.\n\nThough its innovative architecture has been long outdone, the bridge remains one of the most beautiful bridges in the world.\n\nThe views from the bridge are expansive and include parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn.\n\nWay off in the distance, you can see the Statue of Liberty!\n\nBrooklyn Heights\n\nThis stunning neighborhood located next to the Brooklyn Bridge is one of the oldest neighborhoods in NYC and the site of significant moments in American History.\n\nIts charming residential streets are lined with houses of different architectural styles. The oldest house dates back to 1824.\n\nDUMBO\n\nAlso located right next to the Brooklyn Bridge, DUMBO is both artsy and historic.\n\nSome great wall murals are here as well as spacious parks along the waterfront.\n\nIf you are looking for great skyline views, DUMBO is for you!\n\nBy the way, if you are wondering what DUMBO stands for, read our post What does DUMBO stand for!\n\nConey Island\n\nOnce called America’s Playground, Coney Island is a fun place to visit.\n\nBesides the famous boardwalk and beach, there’s Luna Park, an amusement park with thrilling rides, the New York Aquarium, and the Annual Mermaid Parade every June.\n\nBushwick Collective\n\nThe Bushwick Collective is one of the biggest open-air galleries of street art and murals in the world.\n\nSome of the most famous muralists have been showcased here. Local artists are also featured.\n\nHere are more places to see street art in NYC.\n\nThe Borough of Staten Island\n\nWith only half a million people, Staten Island is not a big tourist destination.\n\nIn fact, many New Yorkers from other boroughs never go there, simply because it is overwhelmingly residential.\n\nIt does have some historical sites and lots of green space. There are even some local beaches.\n\nThe highlight for visitors is taking the free Staten Island Ferry. Or, you can take the East River Ferry from Midtown Manhattan.\n\nThe Staten Island Ferry\n\nFor spectacular views of Lower Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty, hop on the Staten Island Ferry for a free ride into New York Harbor.\n\nYou can come right back to Manhattan or explore Staten Island a bit.\n\nSnug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden\n\nOpened in 1883 as a home for retired sailors, this botanical garden covers 83 acres and has 20 different gardens.\n\nHistoric Richmond Town\n\nRichmond Town is a living history museum that takes visitors back in time to the 1600s when the Dutch settled the island.\n\nThere are 15 restored buildings over 100 acres. Guides are dressed in the part and various aspects of colonial life such as craft demonstrations and country fairs are held.\n\nThe Borough of the Bronx\n\nThough much of it is residential, the Bronx has some great reasons to visit.\n\nIt’s home to the New York Yankees, the Bronx Zoo, and Arthur Avenue, the Bronx’s answer to Little Italy.\n\nThere is lots of green space and the city's third-largest park as well as the Bronx Botanical Gardens.\n\nWhat to See and Do in the Bronx\n\nBronx Zoo\n\nThe Bronx Zoo is the largest city zoo in the country with more than 7,000 resident animals.\n\nWhat makes this zoo exceptional is that the animals live in habitats that recreate, as best as possible, their natural habitats.\n\nYankee Stadium\n\nYankee Stadium is home to the New York Yankees baseball team. The ‘Bronx Bombers’, as they are affectionately known, have won the World Series 27 times.\n\nIt’s a quick subway ride from Manhattan, so if you want to see a baseball game, head to the ‘da Bronx!\n\nBaseball lovers can take a Yankee Stadium Tour!\n\nArthur Avenue\n\nLocated in the Belmont section of the Bronx, Arthur Avenue is what locals say is the “real” Little Italy.\n\nCertainly, that’s true of the population. There are more people with Italian heritage living in Belmont than in Manhattan’s Little Italy.\n\nFood-wise, Arthur Avenue is quite a treat. Shops sell homemade mozzarella and sausages. The bakeries are fantastic. Dine out for some of the best spaghetti and meatballs in NYC.\n\nThe Borough of Queens\n\nMany visitors to New York City visit Queens without realizing it! Both John F. Kennedy and Laguardia Airports are in Queens.\n\nBut there is much more to Queens than runways!\n\nFlushing is home to one of NYC’s largest parks, Flushing Meadows, and the city’s second-largest Chinatown.\n\nQueens (pop. 2.2 million) is one of the most ethnically diverse urban areas in the world.\n\nWith at least 138 languages spoken throughout the borough, one could travel the world just by exploring Queens.\n\nMuch of the borough is residential, but that doesn't mean sleepy, quiet streets.\n\nNeighborhoods like Long Island City, Greenpoint, and Astoria, have vibrant art and music scenes.\n\nThings to See and Do in Queens\n\nRockaway Beach\n\nA popular destination for locals in the summer, this Queens beach is easily reached by subway or the East River Ferry.\n\nBesides swimming, sunbathing, and surfing, there are festivals and family-friendly events.\n\nCiti Field\n\nHome to The Mets, Citi Field is a great alternative to seeing the Yankees in the Bronx.\n\nIt’s easy to reach by subway and the stadium is relatively new, having replaced Shea Stadium in 2009.\n\nThroughout the year festivals and major concerts are held here, such as Christmas Lights festivals.\n\nJackson Heights\n\nThis immigrant-dominated neighborhood is a perfect place to take yourself on a self-guided food tour.\n\nYou’ll find foods from South and Latin America, China, Thailand, Mexico, India and even Tibet!\n\nRelated Posts\n\nThings to Do in New York City\n\nPay-what-you-like Walking Tours of Manhattan\n\nPay-what-you-like Walking Tours of Brooklyn"
