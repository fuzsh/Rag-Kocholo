        "text": "Over a Century of Subdivision Attorney Guidance, Serving Landowners in Southern Adirondacks, Saratoga, Capitol, and North Country\n\nIt’s not uncommon to believe that you can subdivide, develop, and sell privately owned land as you see fit. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work that way in most cases. You’ll need a subdivision attorney to walk you through the permitting process. We provide full legal council to ensure your intended land use is done lawfully and in accordance with state and federal law.\n\nSubdivisions\n\nYou can’t simply fill out an application when subdividing land. It can be an extremely complex process depending on the size of the land, environmental regulations, title and zoning concerns, tax issues, and governmental regulations at the state, county, and local levels. If you plan on modifying the land in any way, you’ll need a permit. Examples of modifying the land may include:\n\nconstructing a building (e.g. dwelling unit, shop)\n\ncultivating the land for agricultural use\n\nusing the land for commercial use\n\ndesigning a large-scale community project or commune\n\nselling all or a portion (subdividing) the land\n\ninstalling solar technology\n\nRegardless of the purpose, a subdivision attorney can assist you in every phase of the permitting process, including planning, environmental assessments, permit filing, and handling litigations.\n\nSolar Permitting\n\nSolar technology installation is among the primary reasons for acquiring a permit. Many of our clients plan to invest in solar renewable energy as part of a bigger project development. We assist you in the legal precedence that comes with the solar permitting process. In this specific field, we help our clients:\n\nnegotiate power purchase agreements (PPA)\n\nnegotiate construction agreements\n\ndevelop their bank project financing portfolio\n\ndevelop a plan to drive down costs per watt with regards to utility-scale photovoltaic systems and other solar technology\n\ndevelop a mitigation strategy with respects to indigenous species, wetlands, and other environmental concerns\n\nDon’t Proceed without Assistance from a Subdivision Attorney in Southern Adirondacks\n\nNew York has strict rules in place with respects to land development and subdivisions.
