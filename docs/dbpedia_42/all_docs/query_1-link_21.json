        "text": "The Wayland is the best bar in New York City. \"Yeah okay Johnny you talk in hyperbole all the time...\" A fair criticism indeed. Normally I'd agree, but I feel as strongly about this as I do that Blood Sugar Sex Magik is RHCP's best album. Or that Norman F***ing Rockwell is Lana Del Rey's magnum opus. Anyways, I came to the Wayland for my first drink post moving to nyc as it is relatively close by. I got to talking to Dale (he manages the place) as he was working behind the bar this night. He told me his favorite drink is the Smoked & Roasted (S&R), so I had to pull the trigger. The S&R is still my favorite drink I have had in the city. It is a Mezcal and Pineapple infused drink that Alphabet City locals refer to as \"The Nectar of the Gods.\" Since that night I've probably been here 30+ times and whatever you want, the Wayland has. An open air seat on a hot summer day? CHECK! An intimate, but not over the top date spot? EASY CALL! A night out to get active? NEXT QUESTION! A live music venue? YURRPP! Never forget when the Wayland literally caught on fire and was open 3 days later. A Phoenix rising from the ashes. I love the Wayland so much that I wrote an original poem, taking nothing from any other poem. \"Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner, sometimes I feel like my only friend, Is the bar that I frequent,The Wayland on Ave C, 2 Smoked & Roasted's, Together we cry...\" Could be a good song intro I think too. The staff here is second to none, need to highlight Dale and Josh as they have become friends as opposed to just the local bartender doubling as a therapist. I have loved in the Wayland. I have lost in the Wayland. I have knelt in the Wayland. I have felt in the Wayland. But most importantly, I have formed in the Wayland. IG @jnov_ Tiktok @jnov__\n\nI really liked this bar. It was pretty lively and packed on a Saturday night at 11pm. It was a young crowd, what you would expect in this part of town. As my older sister and I entered the bar, we wondered how we would even push our way to the bar to get served. As we did, two seats opened up right in front of us when two girls left. No one else was waiting for them, so we snagged the two stools. It was like something out of a movie – you know, when a driver in Manhattan pulls up in front of an apartment building and magically there is an open space right there. Anyway, I felt less self-conscious about my age sitting at the bar as opposed to out on the floor with scores of others. I ordered the Moxie from the cocktail menu. It tasted great, like a spicy Old Fashioned. I had that same cocktail again for my second drink of the night. The bartenders were all very busy but professional, without attitude. I loved the fact that they served glasses of water to all those sitting at the bar, even without being asked. What I loved the most, however, was the music: great rock songs from the 1970s including The Who, Queen and others. The crowd was singing along, loudly, to the Queen songs, and not just Bohemian Rhapsody. It created a festive atmosphere, and the bartenders added to it by ringing a bell rhythmically. Glad I checked this place out, and I was happy with my choice of the Wayland rather than Sanatorium several blocks further south on Avenue C."
