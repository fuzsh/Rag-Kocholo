        "text": "Alta Vista, Oak Ridge, Highland Park, Valley View. These may sound like the generic names of neighborhoods and housing communities all across the country, but have you ever thought about what goes into naming these areas, or what their monikers might suggest about the people living there? Whether it makes sense or not, the names and identifiers of our American communities and housing developments often say more about the people living there than we might realize. In some cases, the way a particular neighborhood is branded can be a direct response to how a community has changed over time, or it can help people feel a sense of connectedness or identity with the area in which they live. But what else might our neighborhood names say about us? Quite a bit, actually. We looked at the neighborhoods with the highest incomes and home values in each state to break down how much living in a place with a certain name might end up costing you. Read on to see what we discovered.\n\nMoneymakers\n\nIn 2016, census data determined the average household income in America was just over $59,000, only slightly above where it was in 2000. Of course, where you live in the U.S. and how old you are might also play a part in how much money you’re likely to earn each year. As it turns out, your neighborhood might also say something about how much money you (and the people living around you) make. In some parts of the country, the average household income of places with words like “Village,” “Valley,” and “Heights” in their names was in excess of $100,000. In Texas, for example, the 22 neighborhoods and communities with the name “Village” in the title earned an average household income of over $174,000. The same was true of the eight locales in Colorado with the name “Village” (more than $175,000) and six in Michigan (more than $102,000). Using the map above, you’ll be able to explore each state and the highest average income based on community and development names. In many cases, those averages were much higher than the national average ($59,000). Certain names and neighborhoods in each state may be a sign that residents earn more money on average, but there may also be a hefty price tag to live there. In 2017, the median home price across the U.S. was just $200,000. While that may not be true in every city or state, itcertainly wasn’t true in many of these potentially upscale areas.\n\nWhat’s in a name?\n\nEver get the impression that some housing communities just seem nicer than others? That trend may have something to do with the names of the neighborhoods or areas. Across the country, we found areas with “Hills,” “Island,” and “Village” in the names reported the highest average household incomes, ranging from just over $77,000 to nearly $90,000 a year. Words associated with ocean destinations and seaside escapes, like “Island,” “Beach,” and “Harbor,” had the highest home property values anywhere in America. Ranging from $416,000 to more than $440,000, living in communities named with these dream getaways could cost the average American more than double the median home rate, especially if they’re in some of the most expensive cities in the country. Looking for communities where homes might be the least expensive overall? We found the lowest home values in areas with words like “Fort,” “Junction,” and “Rock” in their names, where homes were valued at nearly half the median price of $200,000.\n\nStretching your dollars\n\nHigher income rates in certain neighborhoods don’t always translate into higher property values. When it comes to getting the most bang for your buck while buying a home, location really is one of the most important factors you can consider. Certain cities and states tend to offer unparalleled values, especially when combined with more robust job markets or higher average incomes. Neighborhoods or areas with “Acres,” “Oak,” “Lakes,” or “Green” in their name might be good places to start looking. According to our analysis, homes in these locations are typically valued under the average price and tend to have above-average household incomes, too. In some places, the opposite effect occurred. Without the right job opportunity in place, we found areas with “San,” “Vista,” “Pine,” or “Santa” in the names had above-average home values but below-average family incomes.\n\nPopular phrases\n\nSometimes a community moniker can say a lot about the kinds of people living in an area or how that area may have changed in recent years. The boroughs of New York City are a prime example. Even Manhattan is named after the original Native American word for the area. Brooklyn was named after a Dutch village in the Netherlands that was important to the early Americans who settled those lands. Of course, sometimes a name just happens to become popular in any given state. It’s not hard to imagine why “Beach” shows up in the neighborhood titles of 66 different Florida areas. On the West Coast, you’ll find “Valley” as the most popular identifier in states like California, Nevada, and Arizona. In Louisiana, Southern charm comes alive in the eight different areas of the state with “Bayou” in the name. And for many states, the name “City” gets right to the point in helping define a vast majority of the communities across the country. Across the U.S., “Lake” (605), “City” (599), and “Park” (345) showed up more often in every state than any other type of name or title.\n\nWhat defines your state?\n\nAlaska\n\nWord in Community Name

A CDP is a concentration of population used for statistical purposes only and is not legally incorporated. We then used QGIS to extract the data from the census and analyzed the data by ZIP code. To extract and analyze the neighborhood names and phrases, we used Python for text mining and the phrasemachine developed by the University of Massachusetts. When looking at the entire country, we limited analysis to only words that showed up at least 25 times. When looking at specific states, we limited analysis to only words that showed up a minimum of four times. When analyzing household income and home values, the data were pulled directly from the census as median values for individual CDPs. Median values were then averaged together to get the average value for each word. The overall averages were weighted based on the number of occurrences in each state.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://www.afar.com/magazine/oddball-neighborhood-names-across-the-u-dot-s-explained\n\nhttps://www.thebalance.com/what-is-average-income-in-usa-family-household-history-3306189\n\nhttps://www.fool.com/retirement/2017/06/29/buying-a-home-in-these-7-states-gives-you-the-most.aspx\n\nhttp://www.nyhistory.org/community/borough-names\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Kickapoo\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/most-and-least-expensive-places-in-america-regional-price-parity-map-2017-7\n\nFair Use\n\nThink your readers want to know more about what their neighborhoods’ names might be saying about them?
