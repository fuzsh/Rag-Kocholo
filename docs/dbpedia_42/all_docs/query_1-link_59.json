        "text": "How It Works\n\nPatients can access the On-Demand Health Stations in a secure, private space in select Five Star Bank locations during bank hours.\n\nUpon first use, patients can create a free account directly at the On-Demand Health Station. This account will be used for all future visits and allow patients to track their measurements overtime and explore and join programs.\n\nBy using the Health Stations to establish a baseline on things like blood pressure, weight and key health conditions, patients can understand and take the next steps (with guidance) on how to get healthier.\n\nPatients can also use the On-Demand Health Stations to connect directly to a UR Medicine provider to receive telemedicine care for common, non-emergent conditions.\n\nConditions We Treat\n\nVirtual Urgent Care visits are a good choice for common medical conditions and minor illnesses, like colds, coughs, headaches, infections, rashes and more. Check our symptom guide to see if your symptoms can be treated in a virtual urgent care visit.\n\nSerious and acute conditions like chest pain, fainting, difficulty breathing, severe allergic reactions and new musculoskeletal injuries should be seen by urgent care or in your nearest emergency room.\n\nCall your primary care doctor's office for preventive care (e.g. immunization), chronic condition management, prescription refills and non-emergency care. Consider urgent care for acute illnesses/injury or call 911 for medical emergencies."
