        "text": "The area of New York was part of the original territory of the United States. When originally chartered in 1664, it included a much larger area. A portion was sold to create New Jersey in 1664, and title claims were ceded in 1682 to Delaware and Pennsylvania. In 1780, New York ceded area to the United States that became part of the Northwest Territory in 1787. New York ratified the U.S. Constitution on July 26, 1788; it was the 11th of the original 13 states to join the Union. In 1791, New York consented to the statehood separation of Vermont; in 1792, it sold area along Lake Erie (the Erie Triangle) to Pennsylvania, to assume generally the same boundary as the present state.\n\nCensus data for New York are available beginning with the 1790 census. The 1790 census data do not include population included in present-day Pennsylvania or Vermont. These areas were enumerated as parts of those states, although the Erie Triangle and all of the state of Vermont legally were part of New York at the time of the census.\n\nAMERICAN INDIAN AREAS\n\nNew York has eight federally recognized American Indian reservations. There is one tribal designated statistical area (TDSA). There are also two state recognized reservations.\n\nMETROPOLITAN AND MICROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS AND RELATED STATISTICAL AREAS\n\nNew York has 12 metropolitan statistical areas, 15 micropolitan statistical areas, 2 metropolitan divisions, and 6 combined statistical areas.\n\nCOUNTIES\n\nThere are 62 counties in New York. The five counties that comprise New York city (Bronx, Kings, New York, Queens, and Richmond) are governmentally consolidated with the city. The remaining 57 counties are functioning governmental units, each governed by a board of supervisors, county legislature, board of representatives, a legislative board, or a board of legislators.\n\nCOUNTY SUBDIVISIONS\n\nThere are 1,023 county subdivisions in New York known as minor civil divisions (MCDs). There are 932 towns with functioning, but not necessarily active governmental units. East Rochester, Mount Kisco, and Scarsdale towns are coextensive with a single incorporated place and have joint MCD/place governments. Green Island and Harrison towns are coextensive with a single incorporated place and have separate active township governments. Each town is governed by a town supervisor or town manager and a town council or town board.\n\nThe five boroughs that comprise New York city (one borough in each of the five counties) are not considered to be functioning governmental units. There are 61 cities in New York that are independent of MCDs and serve as 62 county subdivisions. There are 14 county subdivisions comprised of American Indian reservations. American Indian areas have a special legal status regarding their relationship to state and county government and are treated by the Census Bureau as county subdivision equivalents for the portion of the reservation within each county.\n\nMinor civil divisions are legally incorporated municipal corporations within the state. They provide a range of services to their residents and are empowered to tax property within their boundaries to raise revenue. Villages in New York are places dependent within towns and are not treated as minor civil divisions, with the exception of the five town-village governments.\n\nIn addition, there are 10 undefined MCDs that consist entirely of water.\n\nPLACES\n\nNew York has 1,189 places; 617 incorporated places and 572 census designated places. The incorporated places consist of 62 cities and 555 villages. Cities are independent of any town or American Indian reservation. Villages are dependent within county subdivision. New York city is coextensive with the five boroughs (MCDs). Green Island, East Rochester, Harrison, Mount Kisco, and Scarsdale villages are coextensive with a single town of the same name and have consolidated place/MCD governments. Pelham and Pelham Manor villages together are coextensive with a single town, Pelham, in Westchester County. City, town, and village governments have similar powers and perform similar functions.\n\nIn New York there is no set progression from village to city status. Cities independent of other county subdivisions are chartered by the state and there is no minimum population size to become a city.\n\nCENSUS TRACTS/BLOCK GROUPS/BLOCKS\n\nNew York has 4,919 census tracts, 15,464 block groups, and 350,169 census blocks.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS\n\nFor the 111th Congress (January 2009-January 2011), New York had 29 congressional districts. For the 113th Congress (January 2013-January 2015), New York has 27 congressional districts as a result of reapportionment based on the 2010 Census.\n\nSCHOOL DISTRICTS\n\nNew York has 14 elementary school districts, 3 secondary school districts, and 669 unified school districts.\n\nSTATE LEGISLATIVE DISTRICTS\n\nThere are 62 state senate districts and 150 assembly districts in New York.\n\nURBAN AREAS\n\nNew York has 127 urban areas; 17 urbanized areas and 110 urban clusters.\n\nZIP CODE TABULATION AREAS\n\nThere are 1,794 ZIP Code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) in New York.\n\nOTHER INFORMATION OF GENERAL GEOGRAPHIC INTEREST\n\nNew York is the only state to have been among the top five most populous states since the first census in 1790.\n\nNew York city has been the nationâ€™s most populous city each decade since 1790.\n\nBrooklyn was once a separate city; it merged with New York in 1898."
