Other libraries with this book.\n\nSurveys[edit | edit source]\n\nSurveys sometimes contain descriptions, proprietor's records, names of buyers, names of neighbors, and maps. These surveys and accompanying maps sometimes show settlers or occupants of property; most of the surveys were made prior to subdivision of patents or other tracts.\n\nNew York. Secretary of State.

Many are deeds in which one of the parties resided in another county, state, or country. Many are transfers between wealthy people. The deeds are not recorded chronologically. Deeds deposited with the Secretary of State are now at the State Archives.\n\nDeeds[edit | edit source]\n\nDeeds usually show buyer, seller, residence, and dates. Sometimes they show previous residence and give relationships.\n\nNew York. Secretary of State. Grantor Card Index to Deeds, abt 1640–1973.

These are account books recording mortgage payments on land purchased from the state.\n\nManorial Records[edit | edit source]\n\nA manor was a tract of land granted by the governor. In some cases, manors had their own courts and exercised civil and criminal jurisdiction over the tenants who leased land. Manorial records are used to establish a place of residence.\n\nThe largest manors were Rensselaerswyck (granted in 1630 and 1685), Livingston (granted in 1686), Philipsburgh (granted in 1693), Cortlandt (granted in 1697), Fordham (granted in 1671), Pelham (granted in 1687), and Morrisania (granted in 1697).\n\nThe FamilySearch Library has few records about the Hudson Valley manors. However, it does have the Livingston Family Papers, 1630–1929, from the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park; FS Library films 1421078–90, FS Library Collection. The library also has a helpful index, Van Rensselaer Manor Papers, published about 1990; FS Library book 974.7 R2r; film 1697716, FS Library Collection. This manor was located in what is now Albany and Rensselaer Counties. The original records are at the New York State Library.\n\nA source for more historical information about the manors is Landlord and Tenant in Colonial New York: Manorial Society, 1664–1775[5] The appendix, \"A Note on Sources,\" describes the manorial records that exist and where they are located.

Digital version at Internet Archive - free; New York Family History ($); FS Library Book 974.7 B2n v. 39.\n\nMilitary Bounty Land[edit | edit source]\n\nNew York granted military bounty land patents for service in the French and Indian War, and in the Revolutionary War, but did not grant lands to veterans of the War of 1812. Most French and Indian War grants were in the region of the upper Hudson River. In 1782, Revolutionary War veterans were issued land by lottery in the Finger Lakes region of central New York (28 townships in the present counties of Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, Cortland, Oswego, Wayne, Schuyler, and Tompkins). Many men sold their grants and never settled the land. Before this, lands were made available in the Old Military Tract—located in present-day Clinton, Essex, and Franklin counties—but few soldiers settled there.\n\nThe military bounty land patents are at the State Archives:\n\nNew York. Secretary of State. Military Patents and Abstracts, 1764–1846. Ten Volumes. The patents give the name of the patentee, reason for the grant, location by township, lot number, and acreage. Each volume is indexed by the name of the patentee. The first eight volumes (to 1797) are available through the FamilySearch Library,films 945291–95, as part of the Patents of the State of New York, 1649-1912.\n\nThe names of Military Tract and Old Military Tract patentees are indexed by the Grantee Card Index to Patents, 1775–1912. There is also a card index for the Military Tract. It is arranged by the township and lot number as part of the Patents of the State of New York, 1649-1912 under Military Card Index for Patents FS Library films 946418–20.\n\nSoldiers that drew land are listed in The Balloting Book, and Other Documents Relating to Military Bounty Lands in the State of New York[6] The book is arranged by township, lot number, and grantee name. There are volume and page cross references to the military patent books. FS Library film 812864 item 4. Online PDF pages available at: Tompkins County Public Library\n\nAn index to this source is M. Frances Ferris, Index, the Balloting Book and Other Documents Relating to Military Bounty Lands in the State of New York.[7]FS Library film 896803 item. Available online at: Hathitrust\n\nThe State Archives has Revolutionary War Accounts and Claims. These records were abstracted in James A. Roberts, New York in the Revolution as Colony and State.[8] See Revolutionary War at New York Military Records. About two-thirds of the original documents plus the entire name index were destroyed in the Capitol fire of 1911. The surviving records have been microfilmed and the films are available on interlibrary loan from the New York State Archives. Online at: Vol. I - Internet Archive, Vol. II - Internet Archive; Vols. I & II - Ancestry ($). The first volume lists some 45,000 names from regimental rosters. The second volume has lists of bounty land recipients, refugees, naval lists, prisoner of war lists, lists of suspected Loyalists, claimants for damages, and information about confiscated estates.\n\nFor a history, see:\n\nPierce, Grace M. \"The Military Tract of New York State,\" The New York Genealogical and Biographical Record, Vol. 40, No. 1 (Jan. 1909):15-22. Digital versions at Internet Archive - free; New York Family History ($); FS Library Book 974.7 B2n v. 40.\n\nLand Companies[edit | edit source]\n\nBetween 1786 and 1791, the New York Land Commission sold 5.5 million acres of western New York to speculators. Many settlers first obtained land from companies such as the Holland Land Company. The Hartford Treaty of 1786 gave Massachusetts the title to land in western New York but reserved political governance to New York.\n\nMassachusetts sold this land, which ultimately resulted in three large tracts: the Holland Land Purchase, the Morris Reserve, and the Phelps and Gorham Purchase.\n\nIn 1791, New York sold a large area of northern New York to Alexander Macomb.\n\nThe Holland Land Purchase[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Holland Land purchase included present Niagara, Erie, Chautauqua, and Cattaraugus counties and the western parts of Allegany, Wyoming, Genesee, and Orleans counties. The Holland Land Company surveyed the land and then sold it to individuals from 1800 to 1835.\n\nHolland Land Company Records\n\nThe collection is at the Municipal Archives of Amsterdam and on microfilm at the New York State Library, the Daniel E. Reed Library at the State University of New York at Fredonia, and the Library of Congress.

It was purchased by Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham. The papers of Oliver Phelps survive and were originally housed at the Canandaigua homestead. When the last surviving family member moved from Canandaigua, the papers were divided into three collections. The majority of the Phelps and Gorham Papers were deposited with the New York State Library, Albany. A smaller portion were donated to the Ontario County Historical Society, Canandaigua and a third collection was eventually deposted in the Burton Historical Collection of the Detroit Public Library, Detroit, Michigan. The latter collection contains the most genealogical material on the Phelps family.\n\nA history is Orsamus Turner, History of Pioneer Settlement of Phelps and Gorham Purchase and Morris' Reserve (1851; reprint with supplements and indexes by LaVerne C. Cooley and George E. Lookup, Interlaken, New York: Heart of the Lakes Publishing, 1976; FS Library book 974.7 H2t index; film 871566 item 3, FS Library Collection.\n\nThe Morris Reserve[edit | edit source]\n\nThe reserve included eastern Orleans, Genesee, Wyoming, and Allegany counties plus the western portions of present Monroe and Livingston counties. Robert Morris bought the land in May 1791 from Massachusetts. Morris sold most of the lands in 1792 and 1793 to the Holland Land Company.\n\nThe Macomb Purchase[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Macomb Purchase was made in 1791[9]. This four-million-acre tract included all of modern Lewis County; most of modern St. Lawrence, Franklin, and Jefferson counties; and parts of Oswego and Herkimer counties.\n\nCounty Land Records[edit | edit source]\n\nDeeds and Mortgages. After land was transferred from the proprietors to individual owners, county clerks were to record subsequent transactions. Sadly, in many cases the deeds were never recorded. Some colonial deeds were, however, recorded in town records.\n\nRecorded deeds and mortgages are found at the office of the county clerk. These begin with the date when the county was set off from the parent county. Recording of deeds in county clerks' offices became mandatory statewide in 1830. If a deed was not recorded at the time of the sale, a subsequent recorded deed for the same property was valid. In New York City, land records are maintained at the city register's office. The mortgages often include a schedule of payments, the names of assignees, and the name of the mortgagor.\n\nThe FamilySearch Library has hundreds of reels of New York county land records. Grantee (buyer) and grantor (seller) and mortgagee and mortgagor indexes are available on microfilm for most counties, as are the deeds, to about 1900. The indexes for Albany and New York counties have been published.\n\nDeeds and other land records for much of New York are on film and can be found in the FamilySearch Catalog by using a Place Search under:\n\nNew York - LAND AND PROPERTY\n\nNew York, [COUNTY]- LAND AND PROPERTY\n\nNew York, [COUNTY], [TOWN]- LAND AND PROPERTY"
