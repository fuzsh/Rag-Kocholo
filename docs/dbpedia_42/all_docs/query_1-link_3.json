        "text": "Village in New York, United States\n\nWayland is a village in Steuben County, New York, United States. The population was 1,865 at the 2010 census.\n\nThe Village of Wayland is in the northern part of the Town of Wayland, near the northern border of Steuben County.\n\nThe village was incorporated in 1877. The village grew after it was selected as a station on the Erie Railroad.\n\nWayland is located at (42.568131, -77.591854).[4]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 1.0 square mile (2.7 km2), all land.\n\nWayland is in the northwestern part of the county, near the border of Livingston County and just north of Interstate 390 at the junction of NY-15, NY-21 and NY-63. County Road 93 also leads into the village from the north.\n\nWayland is the northern terminal of the B&H Rail Corporation's Painted Post-to-Wayland railroad line: the surviving portion of the Delaware. Lackawanna & Western Railroad Main Line between Binghamton and Buffalo.\n\nWayland was formerly located on the New York City (Hoboken)-to-Buffalo Main Line of the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad and on the New York City (Jersey City)-to-Rochester Main Line of the Erie Railroad. Both of these routes were abandoned and partially or fully-dismantled through Wayland by order of the United States Interstate Commerce Commission, upon application of the owning railroads. Upon the 1960 merger of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad and the Erie Railroad, the new Erie Lackawanna Railroad obtained the ability to abandon the Groveland-Wayland portion of its former DL&W Buffalo-Hoboken, NJ mainline, thus eliminating a steep southbound (railroad east) grade that had operationally tormented the DL&W for 81 years (since 1882). The EL rerouted its combined Buffalo-Hoboken operation to the Erie Buffalo-Hoboken mainline, via Hornell, when the former DL&W track was lifted in 1963.\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1880605—189067912.2%19001,30792.5%19101,3926.5%19201,79028.6%19301,8141.3%19401,795−1.0%19501,8342.2%19602,0039.2%19702,0220.9%19801,846−8.7%19901,9767.0%20001,893−4.2%20101,865−1.5%20201,680−9.9%\n\nAs of the census[2] of 2000, there were 1,893 people, 743 households, and 502 families residing in the village.
