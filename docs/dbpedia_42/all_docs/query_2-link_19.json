        "text": "The Wayland Union School District is buying the building that formerly housed the University of Michigan Health West Clinic across the street on East Superior,\n\nThe Board of Education Monday night voted 5-1 to enter into purchase agreement with Broadstone Property Management to buy the site at 893 East Superior for one million dollars.\n\nLeslie Wagner, director of finances and operations, stressed that the school district will use money from Public Act 177, so the neither the bond funds nor the fund balance will be impacted by the transaction.\n\nPublic Act 177 is a provision enacted by the State Legislature “to provide for the creation of a fund or funds in political subdivisions for acquiring, constructing…” Supt. Tim Reeves called it a district savings account set aside for public improvement projects.\n\nReeves said one of the first uses recommended for the now vacant building will be space in the basement for the Leisure Life program for senior citizens. Other community groups will be invited to use that space as well.\n\n“Our administrative team is currently dispersed across the district, with departments such as maintenance, special Education, safety and security, community education, and communication located in separate buildings. This fragmentation hampers our efficiency and collaboration.”\n\nMeanwhile, the main floor will be set aside for other administrative personnel, which Reeves described as “split around the district” and not in one location.”Our central office is a bit underwhelming for a school district our size.”\n\nThe superintendent also said the building could be used during schools hours and afterward without interrupting instruction and it could house special programs such as technology.\n\nIt was pointed out that discussions about this purchase were made late last month in a closed session.\n\nTrustee Becky Honke cast the lone dissenting vote, explaining, “I don’t believe I have sufficient information to make a decision, but I think it’s a great idea.”\n\nTrustee Dan Cassini remarked, “It would be stupid of us not to do this.”\n\nBoard President Theresa Dobry said, “It’s a big decision, but I think we’re on the right track.”\n\nUniversity of Michigan Health West recently vacated the building across the street from high school and moved to a new located between Burger King and United Bank on West Superior.\n\nReeves said the seller wanted to move quickly on the purchase.\n\nIn other business at the meeting Monday night, the school board:\n\nProjected a final budget of $40.863 million for fiscal year 2024-25. The schools, with a couple of months left on the 2023-24 budget, reported $41.172 million in expenses with a couple of state aide payments due. Wagner stressed that the 8.4-mill bond levy remains nonetheless.\n\nLearned from Wagner that the district is anticipating that the free lunch and breakfast programs will continue in the next fiscal year. The program has seen huge participation increases in the past couple of years.\n\nAgreed to spend between $100,000 and $140,000 to have the middle school roof repaired correctly."
