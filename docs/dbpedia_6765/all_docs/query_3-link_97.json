Click to download the free sample version Download sample\n\nTable of Contents\n\nJoseph Rudyard Kipling was an English journalist, writer, poet, and novelist of short stories. He was raised in India, a place that inspired much of his work. Kipling’s fictional works include The Jungle Book, Kim, and several short stories, including “The Man Who Would Be King.”\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on the Rudyard Kipling or alternatively, you can download our 20-page Rudyard Kipling worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nRudyard Kipling was born in Bombay (now Mumbai), India, on December 30, 1865.\n\nHis parents, John Lockwood Kipling and Alice Macdonald Kipling, were new arrivals as part of the British Empire in India at the time of his birth.\n\nThe family lived well and Rudyard was especially close to his mother.\n\nAlice, an artist, was in charge of the Department of Architectural Sculpture at the Bombay Jeejeebhoy School of Art.\n\nAt the age of six, Kipling was taken to England by his parents and lived at a foster home in Southsea for five years. The horrors of his experience there were portrayed in the story “Baa Baa, Black Sheep” (1888).\n\nKipling was on the verge of a nervous breakdown by age 11. A visitor to his home saw his condition and immediately told his mother who flew back to England to save her son from the Holloways.\n\nHis mother took him on an extended holiday to help calm his mind, and then put him in a new school in Devon. There, Kipling thrived and discovered his writing ability, eventually becoming school newspaper editor.\n\nYOUNG WRITER\n\nIn 1882, Kipling returned to India. This was a great time in the young writer’s life. The sights and sounds, even the language he felt he had forgotten, rushed back to him upon his arrival.\n\nNighttime in particular proved valuable to the young writer. Kipling was a man of two cultures, someone who was welcomed by his British colleagues as well as the native community.\n\nHe unfortunately suffered from insomnia and roamed the streets of the city at night, gaining access to the brothels and opium dens that rarely opened their doors to common Englishmen.\n\nDuring this time Kipling’s experiences formed the basis for a series of stories that he started writing and publishing.\n\nThey were finally compiled into a series of 40 short stories called Plain Tales From the Hills, which gained widespread popularity in England.\n\nIn 1889, seven years after he left England, Kipling returned to his shores in hopes that his book of short stories might gain him a modest amount of fame.\n\nHe met Wolcott Balestier in London, an American agent and publisher who was soon to become one of his great friends and supporters.\n\nThe two men grew up together and even traveled together to the United States, where Balestier welcomed his fellow writer to his childhood home of Brattleboro, Vermont.\n\nTHE BALESTIERS\n\nKipling wrote, in addition to “Plain Tales From the Hills,” a second book of short stories, Wee Willie Winkie (1888), and American Notes (1891), chronicling his early impressions of America. He also wrote the poetry piece Barrack-Room Ballads in 1892.\n\nThe relationship Kipling had with Wolcott Balestier changed the life of the young writer. He was soon introduced to the family of Balestier, particularly his sister, Carrie.\n\nThe two appeared to be friends only but Kipling, who had traveled back to India to see his father, got an urgent cable from Carrie during the Christmas holiday of 1891. Wolcott had unexpectedly died of typhoid fever, and Carrie wanted to be with Kipling.\n\nKipling flew back to England, and the two married at a small ceremony attended by American writer Henry James within eight days of his return.\n\nJUNGLE BOOK AND NAULAHKA\n\nDuring this time, his works included The Jungle Book (1894), The Naulahka: A Tale of the West and the East (1892), and The Second Jungle Book (1895).\n\nThe Jungle Book (1894) is a series of stories where most of the characters are animals like the tiger Shere Khan and the bear Baloo, while the main character is the Mowgli boy or “man-cub,” who is raised by wolves in the forest. In India, the stories are set in a forest; one of the places repeatedly described is “Seonee” (Seoni), in central Madhya Pradesh state.\n\nKipling named Naulakha after the book. He and his good friend Wolcott Balestier wrote about a precious Indian diamond that is filled with a trove of their possessions.\n\nThrough the Disney film adaptation of The Jungle Book, a musical filmed through 1967 loosely based on the original story, Kipling’s work entered the world of mainstream cultural entertainment.\n\nA live-action / Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) version of the film, directed by Jon Favreau and the vocal talents of Idris Elba, Ben Kingsley, Lupita Nyong’o and Scarlett Johansson, was later released in 2016.\n\nRudyard Kipling Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about the Rudyard Kipling across 20 in-depth pages.
