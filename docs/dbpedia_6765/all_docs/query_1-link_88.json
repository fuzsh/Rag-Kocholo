        "text": "by Janis / 2 comments - Orginally published:23rd November 2021\n\nIn the midst of the Weald, East Sussex\n\nStrolling around the captivating gardens at Bateman’s, you’ll immediately appreciate why Rudyard Kipling loved this beautiful Jacobean retreat so much.\n\nBateman’s is located in an idyllic part of the Sussex Weald countryside. Other than the local cows mooing and butterflies fluttering amongst the fragrant wildflower meadows, it feels like you’ve stepped into an enchanting novel.\n\nThe adoration of the Kipling family home extends from within the historic sandstone walls to its delicately planted patchwork of walled gardens. With every secret corner, you turn another joyful gasp of breath hastily follows.\n\nWhy not Pin it for later?\n\nWhere is Bateman's?\n\nHow to get to Bateman's\n\n- By Train\n\nThe nearest mainline railway station is at Etchingham (3 miles). You will then need to catch a bus service or pre-book a taxi to Bateman’s.\n\n- By Car\n\nBateman’s can be accessed from the A21, then west off the A265. There’s a free car park for National Trust members, or parking charges apply to non-members.\n\nA brief story of Rudyard Kipling\n\nFrom Mumbai to East Sussex\n\nRudyard Kipling was born in Mumbai, India, on 30th December 1865. Rudyard enjoyed the years he spent in India, and it was a considerable influence upon his writing.\n\nHis early childhood was spent in India; however, his education was mainly in the UK. Rudyard returned to India when he was sixteen, and his father had secured him a job at a local newspaper.\n\nIn 1886 whilst at the newspaper, Kipling published his first collection of verses and had a hunger to write more and continued at an unstoppable pace.\n\nA bust of Rudyard Kipling\n\nKipling decided to leave India in 1889 and arrived in the UK after travelling via the USA. Rudyard married Carrie Balestier in London in 1892, where they lived briefly. After a spell living in the US, the Kipling’s decided to return to the UK in 1896. It wasn’t until 1902 that Rudyard and his wife discovered Batemen’s in Burwash and decided to purchase it and turn it into their beloved family home.\n\nAlthough Rudyard Kipling died in Fitzrovia, London, in 1936, Bateman’s continued to be his family home. Rudyard’s widow Caroline bequeathed the house to the National Trust on her death in 1939.\n\nRudyard Kipling’s ashes are interred at Poets’ Corner in Westminster Abbey.\n\nRudyard and his wife had three children his first daughter died of pneumonia in 1899, aged 6, his son John was killed in action, aged 18, during the First World War in Loos, France. Their third child Elsie lived in Cambridgeshire until her death, aged 80, in 1976.\n\nThe study at Bateman’s\n\nRudyard wrote many fictional stories, novels, and poems, many of which were influenced by his life in India. Some of his most famous works include The Jungle Book, Kim and The Man Who Would Be King. Kipling’s well-known poems are “Gunga Din”, “Mandalay”, and one of my favourite pieces of poetry “If- “it is so touching.\n\nIn 1907 Rudyard Kipling was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, although he declined a knighthood on several occasions.\n\nRudyard Kipling\n\nStay informed\n\nWhy not subscribe to our monthly newsletter for some travel inspiration, some tips and find out what we've been up to?\n\nOr alternatively, why not follow us on your favourite social media channel?\n\nThe Kipling family home\n\nTranquillity within the High Weald\n\nBateman’s was constructed in 1634 of beautiful golden sandstone. The Jacobean Wealden manor house was originally built for a Sussex ironmaster. However, after the demise of the iron industry, Bateman’s was used as a farmhouse and gradually deteriorated until Rudyard Kipling, and his wife fell in love with it in 1902.\n\nBateman’s\n\nThe Kipling’s purchased Bateman’s for £9,300 when Rudyard was only 36. They gradually transformed it back into a magnificent family home. Although Bateman’s appears large from the outside, the interior layout and design make it feel very welcoming.\n\nWhen Bateman’s was initially purchased, the house came with 33 acres of land. As time passed and more farmlands became available, Bateman’s Estate grew to over 300 acres.\n\nBateman’s was granted Grade I Listed Building status in 1961.\n\nThe secret gardens at Bateman’s\n\nWhere to stay near Bateman's\n\n- Rose and Crown - Just 1 mile from Bateman’s is the charming village of Burwash. Here you’ll find the Rose and Crown, a historic inn with an in-house restaurant serving a delicious breakfast.\n\n- The Abbey Hotel - Located within the picturesque town of Abbey, this delightful Grade II listed building has recently been refurbished. You have history literally on your doorstep.\n\nExploring Bateman’s\n\nIt’s all in the detail\n\nThe National Trust has done a fantastic job maintaining the house. The serene, fragrant gardens are such a pleasure to stroll around.\n\nAs you enter Bateman’s, you’ll spot a bell-pull on the righthand side. Rudyard added this as a memory from visiting his auntie’s home in Fulham and that of her husband, the artist Sir Edward Burne-Jones.\n\nEntrance to Bateman’s\n\nAs you stroll into the entrance hall, you’re surrounded by grand furnishings, dark wood panelling and oak beams on the ceiling, looking very traditional. The well-used stone fireplace had certainly kept people warm over the years.\n\nEntrance Hall at Bateman’s\n\nAdjacent to the hall is the dining room decorated with 18th -Century English leather wall hangings covered with silver leaf depicting ornate birds and foliage.\n\nMrs Kipling was a stickler for timing, and dinner would be served at eight o’clock sharp.\n\nThe dining room\n\nTwo more rooms are accessible on the ground floor, a charming parlour where the family would have relaxed and entertained, lined throughout with oak panelling.\n\nAcross the hall is a delightful music room, which was originally a schoolroom. You could imagine the Kipling’s would have gathered around by the piano.\n\nThe music room in Bateman’s\n\nOur video of Bateman's\n\nWe have created a little YouTube video of our visit to Bateman's. Why not take a look?\n\nAlso, why not subscribe to our YouTube channel and get the latest clips as we post them?\n\nDiscover Rudyard Kipling’s study\n\nThe man behind Jungle Book\n\nWe headed upstairs to my favourite room in the house, which was Kipling’s study. The National Trust has recreated the room to look as if Rudyard had just stepped out for a brief moment. Towering bookcases filled with fascinating novels to be thumbed through and a well-used typewriter with so many tales to tell.\n\nAlthough I’m always mesmerised by a globe tempting me to explore far-flung places around the world.\n\nYou can just imagine the author staring out across the rolling High Weald countryside with whimsical characters skipping through his mind, ready to leap out onto paper at any given moment.\n\nRudyard Kipling’s study\n\nNext to Kipling’s study is the exhibition room; here is a collection of memories and personal items Rudyard once owned. His daughter, Elsie Kipling, chose the extremely precious objects to be displayed and wrote her own captions for each piece.\n\n“If- “ By Rudyard Kipling\n\nThe final room we visited upstairs was the bedroom of John Kipling, Rudyard’s only son. As mentioned, John died in France during the First World War on 27th September 1915, aged 18. John's final correspondence to his parents is on display within the bedroom and is quite moving.\n\nJohn Kipling’s bedroom\n\nHiking the East Sussex Countryside\n\nBateman’s is located in East Sussex, nearby the historic town of Battle and the seaside town of Hastings. This region of Sussex is ideal for hikes as it is in the High Weald (AONB), an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. To explore the trails in this region of East Sussex, the Ordnance Survey map that will help you along the route is no. 124, ‘Hastings & Bexhill’.\n\nAlternatively, why not purchase and download the OS Maps App, which covers all of Great Britain.\n\nThe enchanting gardens at Bateman’s\n\nRelax and soak up the scenery\n\nThe 12-acre gardens at Bateman’s are magnificent, full of vibrant colours, beautiful scents and awash with different species of plants.\n\nFrom the moment you enter Bateman’s, you’re greeted with the overflowing walled vegetable garden and lush fruit trees in the delicious orchard; it’s stunning.\n\nThe Mulberry Garden\n\nThe garden that I fell in love with was the quintessentially English Mulberry Garden; it was like stepping into a children’s fantasy garden. Creaky wrought iron gates lure you into a garden surrounded by a weather-beaten terracotta wall and a swathe of colour throughout, encompassing you like a warm blanket.\n\nThe vibrant borders in the Mulberry Garden\n\nThe immaculate formal lawns and fragrance fuelled Rose Gardens lead you alongside the lily ponds, down to the Wild Garden.\n\nStrolling through the wild garden, which was once home to Kipling’s tennis court, you are met with the charming watermill at Park Mill.\n\nGarden at Bateman’s\n\nIt is believed that there has been a mill on this site since the late 1200s. The renovated black and white weatherboarded mill you see today is beautiful. The working mill has been lovingly restored, and when you step inside, you get to see all the intricate workings and the tools that the millers would have once used.\n\nPark Mill\n\nIf, like us, you enjoy visiting the National Trust gardens around the United Kingdom, then grab yourself a copy of the latest ‘Gardens of the National Trust’.\n\nIt’s a beautifully illustrated book, and it won’t be long before you’re planning your next trip.\n\nVisit Bodiam Castle\n\nTo ensure we made the most of our National Trust membership, we also visited the enchanting Bodiam Castle, which is only 9 miles (14.5km) from Bateman’s. Grab yourself a picnic or have a delightful lunch at one of National Trust’s charming cafés, and you’ll manage them both in one day.\n\nTime for tea at Bateman’s\n\nPick up your very own Kipling novel\n\nIt’s such a pleasure strolling around Bateman’s, and it’s exceptionally maintained by the National Trust. The eye-catching oast house is now a charming shop selling plants, garden ornaments and some lovely gifts for your friends and family.\n\nBateman’s oast house\n\nIf a little rest is required and you didn’t bring your picnic to enjoy in one of the peaceful gardens, then pop into the Mulberry tea-room. Here you can pick up delicious delights made from the produce of their vegetable garden or a scrummy cream tea.\n\nWhat I also like about National Trust sites are their second-hand bookshops. For bookworms amongst us, Bateman’s Scullery bookshop can be found as a pop-up in the old kitchen in the manor house..\n\nScullery Bookshop\n\nIf you're intrigued by Sussex's fascinating past and weird and wonderful history around the county, then take a peek at \"The A-Z of Curious Sussex\".\n\nYou won't be able to put it down, you can pick it up for your Kindle or in good old paperback.\n\n* This post may contain links to affiliated sites where we earn a small commission at no additional charge to you."
