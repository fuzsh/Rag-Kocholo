        "text": "Rudyard Kipling (1865 - 1936)\n\nRudyard Kipling (1865-1936) was born in Bombay, but educated in England at the United Services College, Westward Ho, Bideford. In 1882 he returned to India, where he worked for Anglo-Indian newspapers.\n\nHis literary career began with Departmental Ditties (1886), but subsequently he became chiefly known as a writer of short stories. A prolific writer, he achieved fame quickly. Kipling was the poet of the British Empire and its yeoman, the common soldier, whom he glorified in many of his works, in particular Plain Tales from the Hills (1888) and Soldiers Three (1888), collections of short stories with roughly and affectionately drawn soldier portraits. His Barrack Room Ballads (1892) were written for, as much as about, the common soldier.\n\nIn 1894 appeared his Jungle Book, which became a children's classic all over the world. Kim (1901), the story of Kimball O'Hara and his adventures in the Himalayas, is perhaps his most felicitous work. Other works include The Second Jungle Book (1895), The Seven Seas (1896), Captains Courageous (1897), The Day's Work (1898), Stalky and Co. (1899), Just So Stories (1902), Trafficks and Discoveries (1904), Puck of Pook's Hill (1906), Actions and Reactions (1909), Debits and Credits (1926), Thy Servant a Dog (1930), and Limits and Renewals (1932). During the First World War Kipling wrote some propaganda books. His collected poems appeared in 1933.\n\nKipling was the recipient of many honorary degrees and other awards, including, in 1907, the Nobel Prize for Literature. His autobiography, Something of Myself, was published after his death in 1936.\n\nFamous quotations by Rudyard Kipling:\n\nTake everything you like seriously, except yourselves.\n\nEvery woman knows all about everything.\n\nThere's no jealousy in the grave.\n\nFunny how the new things are the old things.\n\nWords are, of course, the most powerful drug used by mankind.\n\nWe have forty million reasons for failure, but not a single excuse.\n\nSuggested sites for Rudyard Kipling:\n\nEncyclopedia article about Rudyard Kipling"
