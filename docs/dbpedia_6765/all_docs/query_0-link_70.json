He wrote tales and poems of British soldiers in India and stories for children. He was born in Bombay, in the Bombay Presidency of British India, and was taken by his family to England when he was five years old.Kipling's works of fiction include The Jungle Book (a collection of stories which includes \"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\"), the Just So Stories (1902), Kim (1901), and many short stories, including \"The Man Who Would Be King\" (1888). His poems include \"Mandalay\" (1890), \"Gunga Din\" (1890), \"The Gods of the Copybook Headings\" (1919), \"The White Man's Burden\" (1899), and \"If-\" (1910). He is regarded as a major innovator in the art of the short story; his children's books are enduring classics of children's literature; and one critic described his work as exhibiting \"a versatile and luminous narrative gift\".Kipling was one of the most popular writers in England, in both prose and verse, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Henry James said: \"Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius (as distinct from fine intelligence) that I have ever known.\" In 1907, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, making him the first English-language writer to receive the prize, and its youngest recipient to date. Among other honours, he was sounded out for the British Poet Laureateship and on several occasions for a knighthood, all of which he declined.Kipling's subsequent reputation has changed according to the political and social climate of the age and the resulting contrasting views about him continued for much of the 20th century. George Orwell called him a \"prophet of British imperialism\". Literary critic Douglas Kerr wrote: \"He [Kipling] is still an author who can inspire passionate disagreement and his place in literary and cultural history is far from settled. But as the age of the European empires recedes, he is recognised as an incomparable, if controversial, interpreter of how empire was experienced. That, and an increasing recognition of his extraordinary narrative gifts, make him a force to be reckoned with.… (more)\n\n▾Tags\n\n▾Lists\n\nNone\n\n▾Will you like it?\n\nLoading...\n\nSign up for LibraryThing to find out whether you'll like this book.\n\n▾Conversations (About links)\n\nNo current Talk conversations about this book.\n\n▾Member reviews\n\nNo reviews\n\n▾Other authors\n\n» Add other authors\n\n▾Awards and Honors\n\n▾Common Knowledge\n\nYou must log in to edit Common Knowledge data.\n\nFor more help see the Common Knowledge help page.\n\nCanonical title Original title Alternative titles Original publication date People/Characters Important places Important events Related movies Epigraph Dedication First words Quotations Last words Disambiguation notice Publisher's editors Blurbers Original language Canonical DDC/MDS Canonical LCC\n\n▾References\n\nReferences to this work on external resources.\n\nWikipedia in English\n\nNone\n\n▾Book descriptions\n\nThe Return of Imray is a short story by Rudyard Kipling.Joseph Rudyard Kipling (30 December 1865 - 18 January 1936 was an English short-story writer, poet, and novelist.
