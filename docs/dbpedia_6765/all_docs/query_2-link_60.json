        "text": "16 Oct, 2014 820 English and Old English literatures\n\nMelvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the life and work of Rudyard Kipling. Born in Bombay in 1865, Kipling has been described as the poet of Empire, celebrated for fictional works including Kim and The Jungle Book. Today his poem ‘If–’ remains one of the best known in the English language. Kipling was amongst the first writers in English to develop the short story as a literary form in its own right, and was the first British recipient of a Nobel Prize for Literature. A literary celebrity of the Edwardian era, Kipling’s work for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission played a major role in Britain’s cultural response to the First World War.\n\n→ Listen on BBC Sounds website\n\nGuests\n\nHoward Booth No other episodes\n\nSenior Lecturer in English Literature at the University of Manchester\n\nDaniel Karlin 3 episodes\n\nWinterstoke Professor of English Literature at the University of Bristol\n\nJan Montefiore No other episodes\n\nProfessor of Twentieth Century English Literature at the University of Kent\n\nReading list\n\nKipling Sahib: India and the Making of Rudyard Kipling 1865-1900\n\nCharles Allen (Abacus, 2008) Google Books →\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Rudyard Kipling\n\nHoward J.
