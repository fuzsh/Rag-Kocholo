        "text": "In many of Kipling’s poems he glorified the life of the common soldier, and he came to be seen as the People’s Laureate and the poet of the British Empire. In 1907 he was the first English language writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nAmerican composers who have set Kipling’s poems include Henry Burleigh, Walter Damrosch, Percy Grainger, Charles Ives, Ned Rorem, and John Philip Sousa.\n\nHave you read something interesting about Song in America—in a book or magazine, or online?\n\nOr perhaps have an upcoming event that you’d like us to feature?"
