Rudyard Kipling (1865â€“1936) was an English writer, born in Bombay, in the Bombay Presidency of British India, remembered for his tales and poems of British soldiers, and his tales for children, like "The Jungle Book". In 1907 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, and to date, he remains its youngest recipient. Kipling's reputation has changed according to the social climate of the age. For Henry James, "Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius that I have ever known", while, George Orwell called him a "prophet of British imperialism". On the other hand, Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, always described the novel Kim as his favourite book.
