She was the daughter of the impoverished Francis, Duke of Teck, and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge with the full name and title at birth was Her Serene Highness Princess Victoria Mary Augusta Louise Olga Pauline Claudine Agnes of Teck, popularly known as Princess May. She was engaged to Prince Albert Victor, the elder son of the Prince of Wales, who was later King Edward VII, in 1891. She accepted his proposal only because it was expected of her. After the Prince Albert's sudden death, she became engaged to his younger brother, Prince George, Duke of Clarence, with whom she had much more in common. They were married on July 6, 1893, at St. James Palace. Theirs was an exceptionally successful marriage, producing one daughter and five sons. Upon Edward VII's accession in 1901, the couple became Prince and Princess of Wales. Edward died in 1910, and they were crowned King and Queen on June 22, 1911. Widowed in 1936, Queen Mary lived to see her eldest son, Edward VIII, abdicate the throne, her son George VI reign successfully, and her eldest granddaughter, Elizabeth, come to the throne in 1952. Regarded as the matriarch of the royal family, her funeral and lying-in-state created unprecedented scenes of public mourning.\n\nQueen Consort of King George V.
