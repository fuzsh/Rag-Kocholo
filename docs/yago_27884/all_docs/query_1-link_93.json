        "text": "\"The white robe made for the nuptials of the Royal bride was not ready till last week, as the Spitalfields looms could not produce so elaborate a brocade at any rapid rate. The design of the dress is given below. The long train was perfectly plain, and the front of the dress was of white satin, with three tiny flounces edged with silver at the bottom. The fine old Honital point lace in which her mother, H.R.H. Princess Mary, Duchess of Teck, was married, was arranged in three flounces just above, and long trails on either side of the flounced space. Two more trails were brought across from the sides at a short distance below the hips, lightly tied together in the centre, where there was a little droop, and then fell to the edge of the dress. The long-pointed bodice was made of the white and silver brocade, and some more of the Duchess of Teck's Honiton trimmed the top of the bodice and the upper part of the sleeve. A small wreath of orange-blossom was carried all the way round the bust with a little bouquet on each shoulder, and a larger one in the centre, with which a little white heather was mingled. Princess May also wore her mother's Honiton lace veil, floating backwards, and leaving her face full in view. It was secured with diamond pins, the largest of which was Her Majestery's present, and a small wreath of orange blossom was placed on the hair. The dress was made by Mesdames Linton and Curtis, of 16, Albemarle Street, S.W.\"\n\nThe Graphic Royal Wedding Number, 10 July 1893, p 10\n\nThe Bridesmaids' Dresses\n\nOf the ten Royal bridesmaids who attended H.S.H. Princess May of Teck to the altar on the 6th, the Princesses Victoria and Maud of Wales, the Princesses Victoria and Alexandra of Edinburg [sic], and Princess Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein wore very pretty white-satin dresses, the skirts of which were cut long enough to trail about a yard on the ground. Round the bottom of each was a deep chiffon flounce, over which was laid a row of silver and crystal passementarie, and finished round the neck with pleatings of chiffon, with two elegant sweeping loops joining in the centre, and the passementarie was laid on this and carried as a strap over the shoulder. The sleeves consisted of single drooping puffs of chiffon coming down just over the elbow, and each Princess wore a breast-bouquet of pale pink roses. The remaining five bridesmaids, Princess Beatrice of Edinburgh, Princesses Norah and Patricia of Connaught, Princess Eugenie of Battenberg, and Princess Alice - the little daughter of Prince and Princess Louis of Battenberg - wore short frocks of the same white satin, with proportionate chiffon flounces headed with silver passementerie, white satin sashes tied behind, full bodies with chiffon puffings at the top and silver passementerie and short puff sleeves. They had pink roses on their shoulders. All the satin was of English manufacture, and the silver passementerie was made by cottage workers at Amersham, Penn Street, winchmore Hill, and the adjacent villages and hamlets of South Bucks. The order for it was given to Messrs. Muddiman of Tabernacle Street, Finsbury, who have for several years been doing a great deal to cultivate trimming-making as a cottage industry, and also to resuscitate pillow-lace making, with silk and gold and silver threads."
