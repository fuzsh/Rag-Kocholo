The Danish princess was Alexandra - she and Edward VII were George V's parents. Mary was a princess born and raised in the UK, but with the title \"Mary of Teck\", since her father was a German Prince of Teck, in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg - so she may well have acquired something of a Teutonic accent at home as a child - before she married George V in 1893. If you follow this link: www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO9VEfOeOxo there is a rather faint recording of first George V, and then his consort Queen Mary reading 'Empire Day Messages to the Boys and Girls of the British Empire' (1923) - see vat you think! There were many marriages between British and German royalty, from the 17th century onwards, and German was often spoken in British royal households (apparently Queen Victoria and her German Prince Albert - the grandparents of George V - often conversed together at home in German). However, with anti-German feelings running very high in the UK during and after WWI, George V and the Royal Family increasingly tried to distance themselves from their German connections - including taking on the very British name of the \"House of Windsor\" (rather than \"Saxe-Coburg & Gotha\") in 1917. So, Queen Mary may in fact have tried very hard to emphasise her 'Britishness' and to NOT speak with any noticeably German accent.\n\nW Boddy, Cambridge, UK\n\nAlso, Queen Mary's mother, Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, was a 'member of the British Royal family', but with very German parents and ancestors - so no doubt there would have been lots of exposure to German accents for Mary of Teck while she was growing up.\n\nW Boddy, Cambridge, UK\n\nAdd your answer"
