        "text": "He was the second son of King George V who was never supposed to be crowned King, so when Prince Albert, Duke of York (the future King George VI), wed the Hon Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon on 26 April 1923 (after asking her three times to be his wife), the ceremony was more low key than those of previous future monarchs. Even ‘Bertie’s’ younger sister, Princess Mary, had received publicly funded street decorations for her nuptials the year prior.\n\nA visual history of Monaco's most glamorous royal weddings\n\nRead More\n\nIt still took place at Westminster Abbey on a typical spring day of intermittent sunshine and April showers. Among the 1,800 guests were royals from across Europe, many of whom were related to the Windsors, including King Alfonso XIII and Queen Ena of Spain, King Haakon VII and Queen Maud of Norway and Queen Marie of Romania.\n\nCrowds lined the streets to see the bride and groom arriving, with Bertie accompanied by his elder brother, the Prince of Wales (and future King Edward VIII), who served as best man. The bride arrived with her father and eight bridesmaids, who were a mix of relatives from both sides of the family as well as aristocratic ladies: Lady Mary Cambridge, Lady May Cambridge, Lady Mary Thynn, Lady Katharine Hamilton, the Hon. Diamond Hardinge, the Hon. Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, the Hon. Mary Elizabeth Elphinstone and Miss Betty Cator.\n\nThe Royal Rebels who opted for non-traditional wedding dresses\n\nRead More\n\nThe wedding dress was made by Madame Handley-Seymour, dressmaker to her future mother-in-law, Queen Mary’s, and was reportedly inspired by one by Jeanne Lanvin. Inspired by a medieval Italian gown, the fashionable design featured a drop waist silhouette and very discreet chain, and was embroidered with pearls and silver thread, and included a lace insert that was a family heirloom. She eschewed royal tradition and chose not to wear a tiara, while her veil was borrowed from Queen Mary.\n\nTwo royal wedding traditions have their origins at these nuptials. Firstly, that wedding rings are made from Clogau Gold, and secondly, that royal brides leave their bouquets at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The latter was an off-the-cuff gesture by the new Duchess of York, who left hers in honour of her brother Fergus, who had died in World War I, prior to the ceremony.\n\nWedding Belles: Celebrating over 100 years of society brides on the cover of Tatler\n\nRead More\n\nDespite the newly formed British Broadcasting Company being keen to broadcast the proceedings on the radio, the idea was vetoed. Both popular individuals, the marriage was seen as modernising for the Royal Family, as it was unusual for princes not to marry princesses at the time.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of York welcomed two daughters, Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and Princess Margaret, in 1926 and 1930, respectively. In 1936, King George V died and Edward briefly reigned as King Edward VIII before he abdicated in favour of his brother order to marry his divorced American lover, Wallis Simpson.\n\nKing George VI remained married to his wife, Elizabeth, until his death in 1952. He was succeeded by his daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, and his wife became known as Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother. Their grandson, King Charles III, will be crowned at Westminster Abbey next week."
