        "text": "We don't know what Mary would have been like had she been born a few decades later, to be alive in the 21st century. Because who she was and her opinions were shaped by the time she was born in.\n\nYou cant say for sure she would have approved of Meghan. Or that she would have approved of any divorce among her great-grandchildren. She may have lived through their divorces, but that wouldn't mean she would approve at all. Or accept them into her life. She loved Edward dearly, but she never accepted Wallis. I am not sure she would have accepted Camilla, no matter how much she may love Charles.\n\nFor Mary it wasn't about all the other reasons she was unsuitable. Mary was religious, and divorce was wrong for her. She grew up in a time when a husband had affairs, and women looked the other way, and you stayed together. She would likely have expected Charles and Diana to remain married, and chastised Diana for not turning a blind eye.\n\nCharles and Camilla grew up in a different time then Mary. They would also have been total hypocrites not to accept Meghan, considering their own divorce status. I don't get bringing them into a comparison.\n\nPeter Quennell's book on James Pope Hennessy\n\nI am wanting to read the book \"In Quest of Queen Mary\" by Hugo Vickers, which I understand is an edited version of James Pope Hennessy's notes he took when writing his book on Queen Mary. Someone mentioned in one of the Amazon reviews that a book by Peter Quennell in 1980 on James Pope Hennessy was really good. The statement from the review is \"The best of JP-H's stuff was published by Peter Quennell in 1980.\" Does anyone know which book this is? The only book I have come up with is \"Lonely Business: A Self-Portrait of James Pope Hennessy\" , but it is from 1981 and not 1980. Also it is about JPH and not about his \"stuff\" which I would assume to be his work or notes.\n\nI am wanting to read the book \"In Quest of Queen Mary\" by Hugo Vickers, which I understand is an edited version of James Pope Hennessy's notes he took when writing his book on Queen Mary.

You get a sense for the writer and the “off duty”side of many of the royals. It’s very good!"
