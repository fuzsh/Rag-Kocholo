        "text": "On this day a century ago, it was a period of great excitement for the Royal Family as King George V and his wife, Queen Mary of Teck, announced the engagement of their son, Prince Albert, the Duke of York, who later became King George VI.\n\n‘It is with the greatest pleasure that the King and Queen announce the betrothal of their beloved son, the Duke of York, to the Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, daughter of the Earl and Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne,’ the statement released by Buckingham Palace read.\n\nKing Constantine II of Greece’s funeral: European royals gather to bid a final farewell to their friend and relative\n\nRead More\n\nThe news was accompanied by touching photographs of the young couple, who would wed later that year and shortly thereafter welcome two daughters: Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and Princess Margaret.\n\nAlthough he is now remembered as King George VI, the dashing royal was born Prince Albert, so named after his great-grandfather, Prince Albert, the husband of Queen Victoria. The second of George V’s six children, Albert – affectionately known as ‘Bertie’ to his family and close friends – was never expected to become king and spent much of his childhood in the shadow of his elder brother, Prince Edward, the heir apparent.\n\nThe Queen’s très chic tours: a look back at Her Majesty’s chicest style moments in France\n\nRead More\n\nAlbert attended naval college as a teenager and served in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force during the First World War. His position as ‘the spare’, afforded him a certain level of freedom not granted to his brother. This extended to his choice of wife: at a time when royalty was expected to marry royalty, Albert – who had previously had an infatuation with a married Australian socialite, Lady Loughborough – was granted permission to marry a ‘commoner’, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. The match was considered modernising for the Royal Family.\n\n‘The Duke of York is to most people, whether they know him or not, just a young Englishman,’ The Times noted in its contemporaneous report on the engagement, highlighting his down-to-earth nature. ‘Brought up like others of his kind, devoted like them to the manly sports and pursuits which help to make them what they are — what they showed themselves to be in the war — and, in the more serious purpose and business of life, strenuously desirous to do his duty in that state of life to which it has pleased God to call him. His betrothed is a friend of his sister’s, and much loved by all who know her. In the midst of great anxieties and troubles, the whole nation will join in offering to them its congratulations, and in wishing them the blessing of continued happiness in the life of public service which they will live together.’\n\nWith his Queen Consort, Elizabeth, by his side, King George VI became a symbol of strength and determination during the Second World War. He was also on the throne during the decline of the British Empire, becoming the last Emperor of India and the first Head of the Commonwealth.\n\nRead More\n\nZara and Mike Tindall live it up Down Under with another glamorous day at the races\n\nZara was simply blue-tiful in an aqua creation\n\nGeorge VI saw his eldest daughter, Elizabeth, then heir to the throne, marry her husband, Prince Philip, at Westminster Abbey in 1947 and welcome her two eldest children: Prince Charles (now King Charles III) and Princess Anne.\n\nHe died of a coronary thrombosis in 1952. Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, who had dutifully stood by her husband and daughter serving the nation and the Royal Family, lived a full and long life before dying in March 2002, aged 101."
