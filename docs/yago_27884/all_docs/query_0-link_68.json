        "text": "The ocean liner RMS Queen Mary was named in her honour. Her 28-word speech christening the liner was the only public broadcast she ever made, as she was intensely shy and preferred devoting herself to her children.\n\nDaughter of Franz Paul Karl Louis von Teck (1st Duke/Prince of Teck) and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge (a grand-daughter of King George III, known as \"Fat Mary\"). As a great-grand-daughter of George III, she was the 3rd cousin once removed of her husband George V.\n\nShe was engaged to Prince Albert Victor, the oldest son and heir of King Edward VII. However, Albert Victor died of influenza shortly before the planned wedding. She and his brother Prince George began corresponding during their shared grief, and they soon fell in love and married. They had known each other since childhood, and she used to attend his birthday parties.\n\nDied from the same cause (lung cancer) as her son King George VI, although at the time it was announced that she had died from \"gastric problems.\".\n\nAlthough she was in poor health in the months before the planned 1953 coronation of her granddaughter Queen Elizabeth II, she had let it be known the coronation should not be postponed in the event of her death. Mary ultimately died ten weeks before it.\n\nWhen she attended the coronation of her son, King George VI, she became the first queen dowager (widow of a king) to attend the coronation of a successor. By convention, crowned kings and queens did not attend the coronations of others.\n\nShe had three younger brothers: Adolphus II (Cambridge) of Teck (Duke of Teck and 1st Marquess of Cambridge) (1868-1927); Francis Joseph Leopold Frederick of Teck (Prince Francis) (1870-1910), and Alexander George (Cambridge) of Teck (Prince Alexander, 1st Earl of Athlone) (1874-1957). Alexander served as Governor General of South Africa (1923-1931) and Canada (during WWII).\n\nQueen consort of the United Kingdom and the British dominions (1910-1936) as the wife of George V, and queen mother of both Edward VIII and George VI (1936-1953). She was born Princess Mary (\"May\") of Teck as a daughter of the Duke of Teck, and later became Duchess of York (1893-1901) and Princess of Wales (1901-1910) through marriage.\n\nShe was the first British or English consort to also be a British subject by birth since Catherine Parr (the sixth and final wife of Henry VIII) was queen from 1543 to 1547."
