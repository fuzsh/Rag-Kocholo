        "text": "Queen Mary was born Victoria Mary Augusta Louise Olga Pauline Claudine Agnes Mary in Kensington Palace on May 26, 1867 to Duke Francis and Duchess Mary of Teck. Young Mary was the great-granddaughter of George III and a second cousin to Queen Victoria.\n\nShe and her family lived a quiet life in England, forced to exist on the money that Duchess Mary's mother the Duchess of Cambridge was able to give them. Unfortunately the money was not enough to keep the creditors away and in 1883 the family moved around Europe, settling in Italy for awhile.\n\nThey went around Europe for two years before settling again in London. After this Mary, as she was called, became her mother's unofficial secretary. Mary spent much of her time corresponding with her family including her Aunt who lived in Germany. She also corresponded with her cousin (and future sister-in-law) Maude (the daughter of future King Edward VII).\n\nIn 1891, at the behest of Queen Victoria, Mary was engaged to Queen Victoria's grandson Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence. Unfortunately Albert died shortly afterwards. Queen Victoria, however, suggested that Mary marry Albert's brother George.\n\nAlthough it was an arranged marriage George and Mary fell deeply in love and on July 6, 1893 they were married.\n\nOver the course of their marriage the Yorks (they were Duke and Duchess of York until his father became King) had six children: Prince Edward in 1894, Prince Albert in 1895, Mary in 1897, George, Duke of Kent in 1902, and Prince John in 1905.\n\nIn January 1901 Queen Victoria died and Mary's father-in-law became King Edward VII. This led Mary and George to be Prince and Princess of Wales about a year later.\n\nIn 1910 her father-in-law died and Mary became Queen Mary. As Queen she helped her husband with his new role as King. She was the Queen Consort for about 25 years before her husband died in January of 1936.\n\nHer oldest son Edward became Edward VIII after the death of George V. Shortly afterwards she was shocked and saddened to hear that her son would renounce his throne to marry Wallis Warfield Simpson.\n\nHer second son, Albert, then became King choosing to name himself King George VI. She supported her son and his wife in their new role being the first dowager Queen to go to a successor's coronation. While the new King and Queen traveled around the British Commonwealth, Queen Mary helped look after their two young daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret.\n\nDuring World War Two, the King was worried about his mother's safety and he suggested that she move somewhere in the country where it would be safer. She did what he asked and went to live with her niece, only leaving the house shortly after the war in Europe was over.\n\nShe spent the remaining years of her life devoting herself to charities. She also liked obtaining jewels including the jewels of Empress Marie of Russia (Nicholas II's mother). During this time she also spent time with her great-grandchildren, Charles and Anne, helping look after them when their parents (Elizabeth and Prince Phillip) were away helping the ailing king.\n\nIn 1952 her son King George VI died of lung cancer. She was sick at the time with lung cancer as well, and shortly before the coronation of her granddaughter Elizabeth, she died."
