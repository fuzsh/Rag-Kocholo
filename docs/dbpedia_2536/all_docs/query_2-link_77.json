Geologic map of a s t r i p of the Lewis allochthon i from Head Mountain to Peril Peak, Glacier j National Park, Montana (in p o c k e lt). Ip l a t e I I . A geologic cross section of the Lewis | allochthon from Head Mountain to Peril Peak (in pocket). xv i i r \" ~ ABSTRACT Geologic mapping of an E-W s trip of the Lewis thrust Isystem from Bison Mountain to Peril Peak in southern G la c ie r National Park, Montana, has shown that its a rch ite ctu re is extremely complex. It consists of i symmetric and asymmetric concentric fo ld s , high-angle and low-angle c o ntra c tiona l and extensional f a u l t s , zones of complex s tru c tu re s , and imbricate thrust systems. 1 M ultiply deformed structures of the fro n ta l zone lalong the eastern edge of the study area are truncated i ifrom below by the Lewis thrust f a u l t , suggesting a complex | deformational h is to ry of the Lewis allochthon before the : i jformation of the present Lewis thrust f a u l t . Two major lim'bricate thrust systems, the Elk Mountain and the Mount Henry, and two major low-angle extensional f a u l t s , the jBrave Dog and the Rockwell, were developed during iemplacement of the Lewis allochthon along the present Lewis th ru s t. The two systems developed in a forward progression from west (Elk Mountain) to east (Mount Henry). However, temporally interspersed low-angle extensional f a u l t s (Brave Dog and Rockwell f a u l t s ) I i developed hindward, with the younger of the two (Rockwell) j developed at a higher l e v e l. The compressional imbricate systems and the two low-angle extensional faults , xviii alternated in the times of t h e i r development: (1) Elk Mountain imbricate system; (2) Brave Dog f a u l t ; (3) Mount Henry imbricate system; and (4) Rockwell f a u l t . This i . a lt e r n a t io n of extensional and compressional f a u l t i n g w ith in the Lewis allochthon can be best explained by temporal in te ra c tio n s between the evolving geometry of ith ru s t wedges and internal stress d is tr ib u tio n s as proposed by Dahlen (1984), P la tt (1986), and am plified in th is study. | A simple e la s t ic wedge model was developed in this i Istudy to in v e s tig a te possible mechanical controls on the i I geometry and location of imbricate fa u lts within the Lewis i 'allochthon. The model shows that the maximum length of a i J !wedge-shaped thrust sheet is not only controlled by the j istrength of the thrust sheet and the c o e ffic ie n t of basal i ( f r i c t i o n , but also by the basal dip angle and surface i jslope of the thrust wedge. The geometries of l i s t r i c th ru s t faults and imbricate systems can be also explained i iby the e la s tic wedge model. CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION General Statement This study investigates the s tructural geology of a portion of the Lewis thrust system in southern Glacier National Park, Montana (Fig. 1 -1 ). The study area is an E-W s trip across the Lewis allochthon from Peril Peak to Bison Mountain (Fig. 1-2). It covers an area of approximately 200 square kilometers. The purposes of th is research are th r e e -f o ld : (1) to examine the geometric framework of the Lewis thrust system in the study area, (2) to reconstruct the deformational history of the system, and (3) to explore possible mechanical controls on i t s development. Structural analyses of the Lewis thrust system presented in th is study w ill be in the follow ing order: (1) geometric, (2) kinematic, and (3) mechanical. In order to in v e s tig a t e the geometry and the kinematics of the system, a s tra tig r a p h ic framework is necessary. Chapter 2, which describes the s tra tig ra p h y in the study area and presents geometrical lines and planes of reference, serves th is purpose. Chapter 3 defines the major s tru c tu ra l elements in the study area. Chapter 4 investigates the kinematics of the Lewis thrus t system based on sm all-scale structures formed during its 1 development, cross-cutting re la tio n s h ip s between major s tru c tu ra l components, and geometric reconstructions . Chapter 5 discusses possible mechanical controls for the evolution of the Lewis thrust system. A simple mechanical model is developed in this chapter in order to explore possible dynamic processes associated with the development of the thrust system. Chapter 6 summarizes the di s se r t a t i o n . Previous Work The Lewis thrust f a u lt is a classical thrus t f a u l t in the C o rd ille ra n foreland fold and thrust b e lt . The f a u l t was f i r s t recognized and named by Bailey W i l l i s (1902) of the U.S. Geological Survey along the east side of Glacier National Park. Since then, the f a u l t has been mapped from Steamboat Mountain of west-central Montana to Kidd Mountain in southern Alberta ( e . g . , Campbell, 1914; B i l l i n g s , 1938; Douglas, 1952; Price, 1958, 1959, 1965; Ross 1959; Dahlstrom and others, 1962; C hilde rs , 1963; Mudge and Ea rha rt, 1980). The t o t a l length of the thrus t f a u l t is about 450 km (Fig. 1 -1 ). The trace of the Lewis thrus t can be divided into three segments (Fig. 1-1; Mudge and Earhart, 1980). The northern segment extends from Kidd Mountain to North Kootenay Pass.

Within most of the s a l i e n t , the Lewis thrust f a u lt juxtaposes the middle Proterozoic B e lt-P u r c e ll Supergroup atop upper Cretaceous molasse (nonmarine, synorogenic c l a s t i c ) deposits (Price, 196 5; Mudge and Earhart, 1980). The study area to be discussed in this paper lie s near the south edge of the s a lie n t in southern G lac ier National Park. The southern segment of the Lewis thrust is from Marias Pass to Steamboat Mountain. The in te rn a l geometry of the Lewis thrust sheet has been mapped and studied by numerous geologists. In his pioneering work, W i lli s (1902) noted that minor thrust fa u lt s dipping about 30 degrees in Yellow Mountain and Chief Mountain along the northeastern edge of Glacier National Park, are bounded at the top by a major bedding- p a r a lle l f a u l t and at the bottom by the Lewis th ru s t f a u l t ( W i l l i s , 1902, Figs. 5 and 6). Immediately north of the in te rn a tio n a l boundary in the Waterton area of Canada, 16 km northwest of Chief Mountain, the Lewis thrust sheet was mapped by Douglas (1952). Douglas recognized that a suite of more steeply dipping minor thrust fa u lts are bounded above by the Mount Crandell th ru s t and below by the Lewis th ru s t, a s tru c tu ra l association s im ila r to th a t observed by W i l l i s (1902) at Yellow Mountain and Chief Mountain in 5 G lac ier Park, This s tru ctu ral association, described by W i l l i s and Douglas, was l a t e r cited as examples of duplex f a u l t zones (Dahlstrom, 1 970) or duplex systems (Boyer and E l l i o t t , 1982), The formation of duplex structures is widely in terp re te d as an important mechanism for shortening w ithin a thrust system ( c f . , Boyer and E l l i o t t , 1 982 ) , The Lewis thrust f a u l t and its associated structures at the north edge of the Lewis s a lie n t near North Kootenay Pass ( F i g , 1-1) were mapped by Price (1959, 1962, 1965), and Fermor and Price (1976, 1987), Their mapping shows th a t the Lewis th ru s t sheet is highly deformed w ithin a zone approximately 500-1500 feet (156-468 m) thick immediately above the Lewis t h r u s t. This zone of complex structures consists of imbricate th r u s ts , low-angle thrus t f a u l t s , duplex s tru c tu re s , and low-angle f a u lt s along which younger s tr a t a o v e r lie older s tra ta with the omission of the intervening s tr a tig r a p h ic un its . Above th is zone of complex structures is the main mass of the Lewis thrust sheet, several kilometers t h i c k , is characterized by broad open folds in r e l a t i v e l y l i t t l e de fo rmed rocks. The southern segment of the Lewis thrust f a u l t and the structures in its upper and lower plates have been mapped by Mudge and Earhart from Marias Pass to Sun River area (Mudge and Earhart, 1980, 1983), Their mapping shows that the Lewis th ru s t sheet is broadly folded and l i t t l e f a u lte d . In c ontra s t, structures in the lower plate of the Lewis thrus t f a u l t are very complicated, consisting of closely-spaced imbricate thrust f a u lt s and folds ( l o c a l l y ove rt u rned ) . The Lewis th ru s t sheet is o ffs e t by the FI athead- B lacktail normal f a u l t zone in North Kootenay Pass (P ric e , 1965) and Marias Pass areas (C h ild e rs , 1963; K e lty , 1986), Surface mapping (Constenius, 1982) and seismic r e fle c tio n studies (Bally et a ! . , 196 6) suggest that the Flathead- B la c kta il normal f a u l t zone consists of a family of l i s t r i c normal fa u lt s that probably merge at depth with the Lewis th r u s t. Displacement along the Lewis thrust f a u l t varies along its length from zero at both ends (Dahlstrom et a l . , 1962; Mudge and Earhart, 1980) to at least 65 km near the In tern a tio n a l Boundary (P ric e , 196 5). The minimum displacement of the Lewis thrust f a u l t along the southern edge of G lacier Park is 15 miles (24 km; Campbell, 1914). The age of the Lewis thrus t f a u lt is generally believed to be Late Cretaceous to ea rly T e r t ia r y (Mudge and Earhart, 1980). Bentonites within Cretaceous rocks d i r e c t l y beneath the Lewis thrust f a u l t y ie ld K-Ar ages between 56 to 70 m.y. B.P. These ages are in te rp re te d by 7 Hoffman and others (1976) to be ra diom e tric a 1ly reset by heating due to overriding of the Lewis p la te . They in d ic a te that thrusting occurred during the Late Cretaceous to e a rly Eocene. The upper age l i m i t of th ru s tin g is obtained by the deposition of the Kishenehn Formation (la te Paleocene) in the Kishenehn basin (Constenius, 1982). The Kishenehn basin formed on the down-dropped side of the FI athead-B1acktai 1 normal f a u l t system along the west side of Glacier Park. As the F Ia th e a d - B la c k t a i1 normal f a u l t system offsets structures in the Lewis thrust sheet, the B la c kta il f a u l t postdates the Lewis th ru s t f a u l t . Thus, the age of the Kishenehn basin presumably provides an upper l i m i t for the movement along the Lewis th ru s t. Despite zones of complex structures observed near the Lewis thrust f a u l t surface, structures within the Lewis th ru s t plate were t r a d i t i o n a l l y considered to be simple. The plate within Glacier Park is characterized by a broad syncline (Ross, 1959; Mudge, 1977; Gordy et a l . , 1 9 7 7 , 1982). In 197 9, the U.S. Geological Survey began a comprehensive study to update the geology of Glacier National Park. As an important part of this p r o je c t, the Lewis allochthon was system atically mapped in the eastern and southern portions of the park by G.A. Davis and his students at the U niversity of Southern C a l if o r n i a (Davis, 8 unpublished mapping Davis and Jardine, 1984; Jardine, 1985; Kelty, 1986; Hudec, 1986; Winn, unpublished mapping; and this study). Preliminary results of th i s geologic mapping show that structures within the e n t i r e Lewis allochthon are complex and that m u ltip le episodes of deformation occurred during the development of the thrust system (Yin et al . , 1 986), Geography Glacier Park lie s within the Lewis Range and the Livingston Range immediately south of the U.S-Canada in te r n a tio n a l boundary in northwestern Montana. The study area is a E-W s t r i p across a southern portion of the park from Peril Peak to Bison Mountain (Fig. 1-2, Plate 1), covering an area of about 200 square kilometers. Cirques, U-shaped v a lle y s , sharp ridges, and horns of glacial o rigin are dominant geomorphological features in the area. The floors and lower slopes of most valleys and cirques are covered by morainal deposits and ta lu s . The r e l i e f in the study area is about 1,600 m (2,560 f e e t ) . Snow patches are lo c a l ly preserved above 1,062 m (7000 fe e t) throughout most of the year except July and August. G lacier Park is accessible by commercial a irpla n es , t r a i n s , and highways. The eastern end of the study area can be reached by the Two Medicine Lakes road within the Figure 1-2, Location of the study area in G lac ier Park KS, K a l is p e ll; WG, West Glacier; EG, East G lac ier; LM , Lake McDonald; SM, Saint Mary LS, Lake Sherburne; LSK, Lake Saint Mary.

Many t r a i l s are maintained in the park during summer season by professional t r a i l crews. F ield Wo rk Field work was carried out during 12 weeks in the summers of 1984 and 1985. Geologic mapping was conducted d i r e c t l y on 7.5' U.S.G.S. Squaw Mountain, Mount Rockwell, and Mount St. Nicholas topographic maps ( 1 : 2 4 , 0 0 0 ) . Mapping was f a c i l i t a t e d by inspection of v e r tic a l aerial photographs and oblique color photographs provided by h e lic o p te r a e ria l surveys. The eastern part of the study area was mapped mainly by one-day hikes. The western part of the study area was mapped during three- to six-day overnight t r i p s with h e lic o p te r and horse packing support. 12 CHAPTER 2: STRATIGRAPHY General Statement The s tra tig r a p h y in the study area can be divided into units that are allochthonous and autochthonous units with respect to the Lewis th ru s t f a u l t , although a ll pre­ middle T e r t ia r y units in the map area are allochthonous with respect to the North Arne rican craton. The allochthonous units are part of the Precambrian Belt Supergroup. The autochthonous units are Cretaceous sedimentary rocks (Fig. 2 - 1 ). Because exposures of the Cretaceous rocks are very lim ited in the study area, no attempt was made to d i f f e r e n t i a t e them into d i f f e r e n t s tra t i g r a p h ic u n its . Allochthonous Units: the Belt Supergroup The Belt Supergroup in the United States and it s Canadian e q u iv a le n t, the Purcell Supergroup, are thick successions of Middle Proterozo ic sedimentary rocks that are exposed over wide areas of western Montana, eastern Idaho, southwestern A lberta, and southeastern B ritis h Columbia (P r ic e , 196 4; Harrison, 197 2). The thickness and d e ta ile d lith o lo g y of the Belt rocks vary from place to place in the northwestern United States (H arrison , 197 2; Whipple et a l . , 1984; Winston, 198 6). Such v ariations ____________________________________________________________________________ 13 have been a t t r i b u t e d to (1) change of depositional loci with respect to the edge of the Belt basin (H arrison, 1972), (2) tectonism during deposition of the Belt rocks (Winston, 198 6), and (3) la te Mesozoic to e a rly Cenozoic th ru s tin g (Whipple and others, 1984). The estimated maximum thickness of the Belt Supergroup in the United States is about 23 km (75,000 f e e t ; Harrison, 1972). The to ta l thickness of the Belt Supergroup in G lacier National Park is , however, much less, ranging from 4,700 m (14,000 fe e t; C h ilders, 1963) to 5,700 m (17,000 fe e t; Whipple et a l . , 1984). This study provides f i e l d evidence on the role of la te Cretaceous to early T e r tia r y deformation in complicating our understanding of the s tra tig ra p h y of the Belt Supergroup. This section is divided into two parts: (1) regional c o rre la tio n s of the Belt Supergroup, (2) descriptions of the Belt s tra tig ra p h y in the study area. Regional C o rrelations Belt s t r a t a were f i r s t s y ste m a tic ally studied by Walcott (1899) in the L i t t l e Belt and Big Belt Mountains of central Montana. Since then, numerous workers have studied the stra tigrap hy of the Belt Supergroup in the northwestern United States and it s northern e q u iv a le n t, the Purcell Supergroup, in Canada. Nomenclature of the 14 B e lt Supergroup v a rie s a g re a t deal from p la ce to place. I Harrison (1972) presented a general s t r a t i graphic : c o r r e la tio n chart for the Belt Supergroup in the western ; lUnited States (Table l a ) . The names of Belt s tra t a in G la c ie r Park were proposed by W i l l i s (1902), Ross (1959), !and Childers (1963). Mudge (1977) t r i e d to apply the !names of Belt s t r a t i g r a p h ic units defined by Walcott (1899), e.g. Greyson, Spokane, Empire, and Helena, to the formations named by W i l l i s (1902) in the park, although th is e f f o r t has met with l i t t l e success. R ecently, the Belt s tra ta in G lacier Park were studied by Whipple et a l . , I i i ( 1984).

C l a s s i f i c a t i o n of thickness of s t r a t i f i e d units follows the d e f i n i t i o n of Ingram ( Table 2; Ingram, 1954). Altyn Formation i The Altyn Formation was o r i g i n a l l y described by i ■W illis (1902). The type l o c a l i t y of the formation is on i j c l i f f s at the base of Appekunny Mountain near Many G lacier i | in the northeastern corner of G la c ie r Park. S tra tig ra p h y |of the Altyn Formation in Glacier Park was re ce ntly [studied by White (1984), Whipple et a l . (1984), Jardine (1985), Kelty (1986), and Hudec (1987). The Altyn Formation is exposed only along the eastern [side of the study area immediately above the Lewis t h r u s t . I ; I t consists of as much as 100 m of dolomite, dolomitic I Mimestone, sandy dolomite, and quartz a r e n ite . The Altyn j I Formation is overlain discomformably by the Appekunny | i i jFormation (Hudec, 1987). Since the Lewis t h r u s t f a u l t | i cuts out lower portions of the Altyn Formation, the I I s tra t ig r a p h y of the Altyn Formation is not complete in the study area. The s tra tig ra p h y of the Altyn Formation has j also been studied by Kelty (1986) in the area immediately : I south of the study area, and by Hudec (1987) immediately north of the study area. In both areas, the lower part of , 1 i I 23 I the Altyn Formation is cut out by the Lewis th r u s t . A complete Altyn Formation is present in the Yellow Mountain area, 50 km north of the study area, where the Altyn Formation lie s comformably above the Waterton Formation ( J a rd i ne, 1 985). Complete understanding of the s tra tig ra p h y of the Altyn Formation has been complicated by la te Cretaceous to e arly T e r tia r y deformation. For example, a major in tra fo rm a tio n a l low-angle f a u l t , the Scenic Point f a u l t , was mapped in the study area. This f a u l t places r e l a t i v e l y undeformed Altyn rocks in its upper p late over highly fa u lte d Altyn rocks in its lower p l a t e . The s t r a t i graphic throw along th is f a u l t is unknown. A part of the Altyn Formation may be e it h e r omitted or repeated along i t . The Scenic Point f a u l t lie s p a r a l l e l to bedding in its upper p la te but is generally discordant to bedding in its lower p la t e . More d e ta ile d descriptio n of t h is f a u l t is presented in Chapter 3. The general s tra tig ra p h y of the Altyn Formation in the study area is summarized in Fig. 2-2. The Altyn Formation is divided into two p a rts , one above, and the other below, the Scenic Point f a u l t . The Altyn Formation above the Scenic Point f a u l t is l i t t l e deformed on the north c l i f f of Scenic P o in t, 1.5 km south of the middle Two Medicine Lake (P la te 1; Fig. 3 - 3 ) . I t is composed of bu ff-w eatherin g dolomite, yellowish 24 Generalized s tra tig r a p h y of the Altyn Formation in the study area.

The s t r a t i f i c a t i o n of the dolomite ranges from medium- (10-50 cm) to thin-bedded (5-10 cm), commonly with cross lam inations. A coarse-grained and t h i n l y bedded quartz a ren ite unit 5-8 m t h i c k , li e s immediately above the Scenic Point f a u l t on the north c l i f f of Scenic Point. The thicknesses of the Altyn Formation above the Scenic Point f a u l t range from 15-20 m at Scenic Point to about 25 m on the east side of Head Mountain. The part of the Altyn Formation above the Scenic Point f a u l t in the study area is l i t h o l o g i c a l l y s im il a r to member 3 of Jardine (1985) at Yellow Mountain. The s t r a t i g r a p h i c section of the Altyn Formation below the Scenic Point f a u l t has been extremely complicated by extensional and c ontractional f a u l t s , p a r t i c u l a r l y at the north c l i f f of Scenic Point (see Chapter 3 ). The s tru c tu ra l thickness (not s t r a t i graphic) of the Altyn Formation below the Scenic Point f a u l t varies from zero near the southeast corner of Head Mountain, where the Lewis thrust f a u l t and the Scenic Point f a u lt j o i n , to about 40 m at the north c l i f f of Scenic Point. The lower Altyn Formation in the study area is composed of fin e - g r a in e d , thick-bedded (>50 cm) grayish dolom ite, grayish dolom itic limestone, l o c a l l y interbedded with _________ 27 medium-, to thin-bedded dolomite and medium-bedded areneceous dolomite. The arenaceous dolomite is a minor component in the lower A ltyn, probably less than 20% based on observations on the north c l i f f of Scenic Point. Blackish-gray chert beds, 3-10 cm t h i c k , are occasionally present in th is s t r a t i graphic i n t e r v a l , and are helpful as markers of bedding in the massive dolomite in the f i e l d . The Altyn Formation below the Scenic Point f a u l t in the study area is 1i t h o 1o g ic a lly s im ila r to what has been described as member 2 of the Altyn Formation by Jardine (1985) at Yellow Mountain. To the north from the study area, a major in tra fo r m a tio n a l f a u l t , the Spot Mountain f a u l t , was mapped by (Hudec, 1987). The Thicknesses and li t h o l o g y of the Altyn Formation above and below the Spot Mountain f a u l t are s im il a r to those above and below the Scenic Point f a u l t in the study a re a. D etailed d e s c rip tio n of the Scenic Point f a u l t and possible c o r r e l a ti o n between the Spot Mountain f a u lt and Scenic Point f a u l t w i l l be presented in Chapter 3. Ap pek un ny Fo rma t i on The Appekunny Formation was f i r s t described by W i l l i s (1 9 02 ). The type l o c a l i t y of the formation is at Appekunny Mountain in northeastern Glacier Park. The 28 Appekunny Formation consists predominantly of grayish- green to gra y is h -b lu e a r g i l l i t e , b1 a c k is h - grey s i l t i t e , and white a r e n it e . The e n tir e formation is exposed on the eastern side of the park in the study area, where the Appekunny Formation o v e rlie s the Altyn Formation discomformab1y and underlies the Grinnell Formation comf ormably. In the eastern study area, f iv e quartz a r e n ite units are present w ith in the formation. These quartz a r e n ite unites are l a t e r a l l y p e r s is te n t and were mapped as marker beds in the study area. They are assigned as marker beds A through E. Four of the f iv e marker beds (A, C, D, and E) can be traced or c o rre la te d to the north in the area mapped by Hudec (1987), and to the south in the area mapped by Kelty (1986). Using the tops of marker bed C, D, and E as boundaries, the Appekunny Formation is divided into four informal members on the east side of the study area (Fig. 2 - 3 ) . This d iv is io n of the Appekunny Formation is consistent with that of Hudec (1987), and is e s s e n t i a lly the same as that of Kelty (1986) except that Kelty used the bases of marker bed C, D, and E as the boundaries of the informal members. Whipple et a l . (1984) divided the Appekunny Formation into f i v e informal members. Their member 1 and 2 approximate member 1 in t h i s study, and member 3, 4, and 5 approximate member 2, 29 3, and 4 of th is study. In the Yellow Mountain area, Jardine (1985) mapped two quartz a r e n ite units as marker beds in the Appekunny Formation. The lower marker bed is whitish quartz a r e n ite and is about 11 m t h i c k . This bed is about 50 m above the A1tyn- Appekunny contact. The upper marker bed varies in thickness from 12 to 30 m, and is dominantly a l i g h t ora n g ish -w h ite, dolom itic s i l t i t e that is about 160-170 m above the Altyn-Appekunny contact. The two marker units mapped by Jardine (1985) can be c o rrelate d with marker bed B and C r e s p e c t iv e ly in th is study area based on t h e i r s i m i l a r lith o l o g y and s t r a t i graphic positions (see discussions below on marker bed B and C), and on t h e i r e s s e n tia l c o n t in u ity between the two areas (G. A. Davis, unpublished mapping). Generalized s tr a tig r a p h y of the Appekunny Formation in the eastern side of the study area is summarized in Fig. 2 -3 . On the western side of the park in the study area, only member 4 and the upper part of the member 3 are exposed. The lower parts of the Appekunny Formation are covered by morainal and a l l u v i a l deposits. A major in t ra f o r m a tio n a l low-angle f a u l t , the Brave Dog f a u l t , l i e s w ith in the Appekunny Formation throughout the e n t i r e study area.

The li th o lo g y of the Appekunny Formation is described as fo llo w in g . Member 1: Member 1, the basal member of the formation between the Appekunny-Altyn contact and the top of marker bed C ( M B C) , is 2 0 0-250 m thick and consists of orange f i n e ­ grained sandstone, green to b 1 ackish-gray a r g i l l i t e , and brownish- to whitish~gray quartz a r e n it e . The contact between the Appekunny Formation and the Altyn Formation was observed d i r e c t l y at the northwest side of Scenic Point where i t is a sharp planar surface p a r a lle l to bedding in both underlying and o v e rly in g s t r a t a . On the southern flank of Spot Mountain, the contact between the Appekunny Formation and Altyn Formation was examined by Hudec (1987). He reported that the contact is an erosional surface. It was th e r e fo r e in te r p r e t e d as a discornformity by Hudec (1987). Marker bed A (MBA) is the s t r a t i g r a p h i c a l l y lowest quartz a r e n ite unit in the Appekunny Formation. It is exposed on the eastern side of the study area and extends north and southwest into areas mapped by Hudec (1987) and Kelty (1986) r e s p e c t i v e l y . Marker bed A is a 3-5 m th ic k , t h i n - to medium-bedded white coarse-grained (grain size: 0.5 to 1.0 mm) quartz a r e n ite . Quartz grains are well 33 sorted and well rounded.

Immediately above the marker bed is a sequence, 30-40 m th i c k , of predominantly carbonate- i jcemented, brownish-orange fin e - g r a in e d (0.10 to 0.25 mm) j i E I 1 sandstone beds, which are interbedded with minor b la c k is h - gray and brownish-gray a r g i l l i t e .

Marker bed B is a 3-5 m th ic k , w h itis h -g ra y medium- to coarse-grained (0.25 to 1.0 mm) quartz a r e n it e . Its mineral composition is l i s t e d in Table 3. Marker bed B is only present on the eastern side I jo f Head Mountain and Bison Mountain in the northeastern ! part of the study area.

The high content of coarse c la s tic components (sandstone beds) distinguishes member 3 from member 2.

This f a u l t is parallel to the bedding in its upper plate, but l o c a l l y truncates bedding in its lower plate in the study area (see description of the Brave Dog fa u lt in Chapter 3). The Brave Dog f a u l t cuts downsection to the east across its footwall at a very shallow angle (3-5 degrees) to the east in the d ire c tio n of its tectonic transport, omitting part of member 2 and member 3 in the southern edge of the Lewis allochthon mapped by Kelty (1986) and the study area. Marker bed E is the uppermost part of member 3. It is a approximately 6 m thick white quartz arenite (Table 3). Beds in maker bed E are 30-60 cm th ic k . This marker 38 unit is l a t e r a l l y persis te nt, and can be traced into areas mapped by Kelty (1 986) and Hudec ( 1 98 7 ) re s pe ct i ve 1 y . Member 4: Member 4 is the uppermost member of the Appekunny Formation, It extends from the top of MBE ,to the base of the Grinnell Formation, The thickness of member 4 ranges from 200 to 250 m. This member can be divided into two parts. The lower part, approximately 150-200 m thick, consists primarily of th i n ly laminated, brownish- to tanish-gray a r g i l l i t e s . This unit can be traced across the study area from east to west. On the eastern side of the study area, the uppermost 20 to 35 m of this member is a sequence of cl i f f - f o r m i n g , massive bluish-green a r g i l l i t e s . To the west, this sequence changes from dominant red a r g i l l i t e s to a sequence, 30-50 m thick, interbedded red and green a r g i l l i t e s . Each red or green a r g i l l i t e bed is about 5 to 8 m th i c k . The basal Grinnell Formation immediately above this sequence consists e n t i r e l y of red a r g i l l i t e s . Gr i n ne11 F o rma t i on The Grinnell Formation was f i r s t described by W i l l i s (1902) in Glacier Park. The type area of the formation is located at Mount Grinnell in Many Glacier area, 39 northeastern Glacier National Park. This formation lies comformably between the Appekunny and Empire Formations. Continuity of the Grinnell stratigraphy in the study area, as for the underlying units, has been complicated by la t e Cretaceous to early T e r tia r y deformation. Several low-angle f a u lts of regional extent were mapped within the Grinnell Formation (Plate 1). Since the s t ra tig r a p hic throws along these intraformational faults are unknown, i t has not been possible to construct a complete s tra tigrap hic section of the Grinnell Formation in the study area. The Grinnell Formation in the park has been recently studied in detail by Whipple et a l . (1984). The following description of the formation is based mainly on th e ir results. The Grinnell Formation is, in general, a quartzose redbed sequence. The thickness of this formation varies from 7 90 m (2,600 feet; Whipple et a l . , 1984) near the Lake Mcdonald on the west-central part of the park, to 300-550 m (1 ,0 00-1,800 fe e t; W i l l i s , 1902) in the northeast corner of the park. In the study area, the minimum thickness of the Grinnell Formation ranges about 800 m (2,600 fe e t) thick in the west to about 500 m (1,700 feet) thick in the east. The Grinnell Formation in the eastern portion of the park is composed of quartz a renite and interbedded red 40 a r g i l l i t e . The content of quartz arenite ranges from 4 0% to 60%. Beds of quartz a renite are t y p i c a l l y white, medium- (0 .2 5 -0.5 mm) to coarse-grained ( > 0 . 5-1.0 mm). Primary sedimentary structures such as cross-bedding, mud cracks, rip-up clasts of a r g i l l i t e s , and ripple marks, are common. In general, beds of quartz arenite become more common upward in the formation. Interbedded with these arenites are prominent red or purplish-red laminated s i l t i t e , s i l t y a r g i l l i t e , and a r g i l l i t e . Laminae range from even p a r a l l e l to wavy nonparallel, and lo ca lly include cross-laminae. Disrupted bedding due to mud cracking and flu id escaping processes is ubiquitous in these red beds. Beds of greenish-gray s i l t i t e and a r g i l l i t e are rarely present on the east side of the park. Whipple et a l . (1984) report that a marked l i t h o l o g i c change occurs in the Grinnell Formation from east to west across Glacier Park. The intimate in t e r la y e r in g of quartz arenite and red a r g i l l i t e in eastern exposures changes northwestward to a li th o f a c ie s that contains l i t t l e quartz arenite (and most of that is in the upper half of the formation). In contrast, grayish-green and grayish-purple s i l t i t e and a r g i l l i t e are abundant. This change in li t h o f a c i e s between is also observed in the study area. At Peril and Cloudcroft Peaks in the western study area, the Grinnell Formation consists dominantly of grayish- 41 green and red s i l t i t e and a r g i l l i t e . The a r g i l l i t e is j evenly laminated and contains a few thin beds of r i p p l e - | i Jmarked, whitish-red quartz a ren ite . The thicknesses of > \\ the grayish-green a r g i l l i t e beds and s i l t i t e beds are from 30 to 50 m. In the lower portion of the formation, 30% of ' beds are grayish-green s i l t i t e and a r g i l l i t e , but the percentage of the grayish-green s i l t i t e and a r g i l l i t e appears to decrease upwards. Emp i re Fo rma t ion The Empire Formation comformably overlies the [Grinnell Formation and underlies the Helena Formation. It | i is a sequence of interbedded a r g i l l i t e , q u a r tz it e and carbonate that was separated from the lower part of the . Siveh Formation in Glacier Park by Mudge (1977). The i | remaining upper limestone sequence of the Siveh Formation [was named the Helena Formation (Mudge, 1977). The I I formation, 150-180 m t h ic k , is well exposed at Finch Peak, Rising Wolf Mountain, and Mount P h i l l i p s in the northern ! part of the study area. Its s tra tigraphy was examined in some detail at Finch Peak in the northeastern part of the i i study area. The lower 20 m of the formation is dominated j by beds of white to orange quartz arenites that range in ! I thickness from 20 to 30 cm. These arenites are j interbedded with minor, thin-bedded gray a r g i l l i t e j beds. The middle part of the formation, about 80 to 100 m thick, consists predo minantly of gray a r g i l l i t e . The number and thickness of the a ren ite beds decrease with a cor responding increase in gray a r g i l l i t e beds and carbonate beds. The upper part of the formation is about 50 to 80 m t h ic k . This s t r a t i graphic interval is dominated by carbonate beds. Gray a r g i l l i t e and quartz arenite are minor components in this s t r a t i graphic i n t e r v a l . Arenite beds are absent in the upper 20 m of the formation. Helena Formation The Helena Formation comformably overlies the Empire Formation, and comformably underlies the Snowslip Formation. Only the lower part of this formation is present in the study area. The following descriptions of the Helena Formation combine the observations at Finch Peak of the northeastern study area with those of Whipple et a l . (1984) in other parts of the park. The Helena Formation is about 850 m thick in Glacier Park, and consists primarily of dolomite, limestone, and quartz a ren ite. This formation was recently divided by Whipple et a l . (1984) into three parts. Only the lower and the lower middle part of the Helena Formation of Whipple et al. (1984) are present in the study area. The 43 lower member is about 200 m thick and consists predominantly of thin-bedded dolomite, lo c a l ly interbedded with minor quartz arenite beds. The middle part of the formation is about 600 meters thick and consists prim arily of dolomitic molar-tooth beds, some as much as 30 m thick. A few thin beds of quartz arenite and stromato1i t i c limestone are present. The upper part of the formation is said to consist predominantly of interbedded s t r o m a t o l i t i c limestone, o o l i t i c limestone, and quartz arenite. An a re a lly extensive d i o r i t e s i l l about 45 m thick intrudes the lower part of the Helena Formation in the study area. This s i l l climbs section from near the base of the Helena Formation in the southeastern park, to the lower part of the Snowslip Formation in northernmost park area (Whipple et a l . , 1984). The d i o r i t e s i l l is well exposed at Finch Peak and Mount P h i l l i p s . Autochthonous Rocks W i l l i s (1902) f i r s t recognized the presence of recessive, s1 ope-forming Cretaceous rocks below the Lewis thrust f a u l t . The Cretaceous rocks in and around Glacier National Park have been mapped by Mudge and Earhart (1980, 1983). According to t h e i r mapping, the Cretaceous rocks at the eastern edge of the study area belong to the Marias River Shale of upper Cretaceous age. 44 The Marias River Shale, which consists mainly of dark-gray, marine mudstone in the study area, is only exposed along streams. The exposures, isolated by Quaternary a l l u v i a l , morainal, and landslide deposits, range from several square meters to several tens of square meters. Due to the limited exposures, no attempt was made to d i f f e r e n t i a t e the Cretaceous rocks in the lower plate of the Lewis t h r u s t . 4 5 CHAPTER 3: GEOMETRY OF THE LEWIS THRUST SYSTEM General Statement This chapter describes the geometry of the Lewis thrust and the structures in its upper plate. The purpose of this description is to establish the geometrical framework of the Lewis thrust system. D efinitions of contractional and extensional fa u lts used in this study follows that of Norris (1958) and Dennis et a l . (1981): a contractional f a u l t is a f a u l t which shortens bedding; an extensional f a u l t is a f a u l t which extends bedding. It is important to point out that use of the term \"extensional fa u lt \" does not necessarily imply extensional t e c to n ic s . F i r s t , the a t t i t u d e of bedding may not be horizontal when an extensional f a u l t formed. Therefore the extension of bedding may or may not represent a true crustal extension in the horizontal d ire c tio n . Second, a low-angle curviplanar f a u l t may change its dip dire c tio n along its d i f f e r e n t segments, and i t can cut upsection and downsection in the dire ction of its tectonic transport along its d i f f e r e n t segments. This f a u l t is an extensional f a u l t along the segments where the f a u l t cuts down section in the transport d ire c tio n and the length of bedding is extended; i t is a contractional f a u l t along the segments where the f a u l t cuts upsection in its transport 46 dire c tio n and the length of bedding is contracted. Structural elements in the Lewis allochthon in southern Glacier Park include imbricate thrust systems, low- and high-angle extensional and contractional f a u l t s , and broad and t i g h t folds. Major structural components in the Lewis plate are the Scenic Point structural complex, frontal zone, eastern structural b e lt, Elk Mountain imbricate system (Kelty, 1986), Brave Dog f a u l t ( Ke1t y ,1986), Mount Henry imbricate system, Rockwell f a u l t , Two Medicine Pass f a u l t , Akamina syncline or Continental Divide syncline, and Lone Walker f a u lt (Fig. 3-1, Plate 1, Plate 2). These structural components, together with the Lewis thrust f a u l t i t s e l f , define the Lewis thrust system. Fig. 3 -la is a sim pli fied geologic map of the study area, and Fig. 3-lb is a s im p li f ie d geologic cross section through the study area. Detailed structural relationships within the Lewis allochthon are shown in Plates 1 and 2. Note that the cross-section line in Fig. 3-la does not exactly coincide with the cross- section line in Plate 1. Lewis Thrust Fault The Lewis thrust fa u lt is the dominant structure in the study area (Fig. 3 -2). It juxtaposes the mid- Proterozoic Belt rocks in its upper plate with the late ___________________________________________________ 47 Figure 3 -1. a.

The trace of the f a u l t (LT) follows the break of slope and separates upper-plate Proterozoic Belt rocks ( l e f t ) from lower-plate Cretaceous rocks ( r i g h t ) .

Appekunny rocks ov erlie the Altyn and exhibit considerable complexity in the v i c i n i t y of the prominent valley bordered by green vegetated pattern (cf. F i g . 3 -6). 52 Cretaceous Marias River Shale (Mudge and Earhart, 1983) in its lower plate. In the study area, the Lewis thrust f a u l t gradually cuts up-section l a t e r a l l y to the south, thinning the Altyn Formation from about 300 feet (92 m) at the north c l i f f of Scenic Point immediately south of the middle Two Medicine Lake, to about 50 feet (14 m) at Squaw Mountain 5 miles (8 km) fa th e r south. The a t t i t u d e of the Lev;is thrust fa u lt from a direct measurement at the western end of Forty One Mile Creek is N20oW 6oSW. The Lewis thrust f a u l t is located at an elevation of about 6000 feet along the eastern edge of the map area (Plate 1), but li es beneath the Belt strata exposed at elevations less than 4500 feet in western areas. Outcrop information and a geologic cross section of the Lewis plate across the study area (Plate 2) indicate that the Lewis thrust f a u l t dips towards the west at a shallow angle across southern Glacier Park. The Lewis thrust f a u lt is sharply delineated between the c l i f f - f o r m i n g Altyn Formation and slope-forming Cretaceous sedimentary rocks in the study area. Although the fa u lt surface can be generally located within several meters, it is rarely exposed, as i t is usually covered by talus or landslide blocks. The exposure of the fault surface in the study area was only found in the headwater of Forty One Mile Creek at the southeastern corner of 53 Bison Mountain. The Lewis thrust f a u l t at this l o c a l i t y is a sharp planar surface separating the Altyn Formation from the la te Cretaceous Marias River Shale. Intensely sheared shales l i e d i r e c t l y beneath the f a u l t . An apparently s im ila r b r i t t l e shear zone beneath the Lewis thrust f a u l t was described and studied by Wilson (197 0) along the Dry Fork of Two Medicine Creek, 7 km north of the study area, and along Rose Creek near St. Mary Lake. Scenic Point Structural Complex The Scenic Point s tru ctu ra l complex (SPSC) li es e n t i r e l y within the Altyn Formation. This complex, bounded above by the low-angle Scenic Point f a u l t (SPF) and below by the Lewis thrust, is best exposed on the north c l i f f of Scenic Point, 2 km south of the lower Two Medicine Lake (Figs. 3-1 and 3-3, Plate 1). The Scenic Point f a u l t is pa ra lle l to bedding in its upper plate, but is discordant with respect to highly deformed bedding below i t . On the north c l i f f of Scenic Point the trace of the fa u lt li es 30-40 meters below the A lty n - Appekunny contact and follows the base of a 3 meter-thick white qu artzit e bed. On the southeastern side of Head Mountain, the f a u l t joins the west-dipping Lewis thrust f a u l t . Whether or not the Scenic Point f a u l t also joins with the 54 Figure 3-3. Scenic Point Structural Complex as viewed to the south from the north base of Scenic Point. Scenic Point f a u l t (SPF) lies beneath a whitish gray quartz aren ite bed and separates l i t t l e deformed strata in its upper plate from highly deformed rock packages in its lower plate . MBC is marker bed C of a quartz arenite bed. Ya, the Altyn Formation; Yap, the Appekunny Formation. The Lewis thrust is covered by talus deposits at the base of the c l i f f . Figure 3-4 shows detailed structures on the north c l i f f of Scenic Point. 55 56 Lewis thrust westward is not known because the Scenic Point stru ctural complex becomes covered by talus west of Scenic Point (Plate 1). The Scenic Point f a u l t and shallowly dipping s trata in its upper plate have been folded into broad a n tic lin e s and synclines (Figs. 3-3 and 3-4) . Rocks in the lower plate of the Scenic Point fault are complexly faulted and comprise a structural assemblage cut by both contractional and extensional f a u l t s . Offsets along most of these fa u lts are uncertain because good marker beds are rare in the Altyn Formation. The contractional faults generally dip to the west except a few minor backthrusts which dip to the east (Fig. 3 -4 ). The extensional f a u l t s , however, only dip eastward (Figs. 3-3 and 3 -4 ). The o r ie nta tio ns of contractional and extensional f a u lt s in the Scenic Point structural complex are sub-perpendicular to the inferred d i re c tio n of tectonic transport along the Scenic Point f a u l t (see discussion in Chapter 4 ). On the southwestern side of Fig. 3-4, west-dipping contractional faults appear to cut east-dipping extensional f a u l t s ; on the northeast side of Fig. 3-4, however, an east-dipping extensional f a u l t beneath the crest of the eastern a n t i c l i n e appears to cut and offset a west-dipping contractional f a u l t . In general, contractional fa u lts appear to have developed 57 Figure 3-4* Sketch of Scenic Point structural complex on the north side of Scenic Point. View from northeast. 58 L evis Thrust f a u lt p o ih t SCe m c f a u l t 1 Ian 59 immediately beneath the a n t i c l i n e s , whereas the extensional f a u l t s to have developed beneath the synclines (Fig. 3-4). This structural re la tio n s h ip suggests that the development of some f a u l t s in the Scenic Point structural complex and folding of the Scenic Point fa u lt immediately above them may have been g e n e t ic a ll y r e la ted . Possible kinematic processes responsible for the development of the Scenic Point stru c tu ra l complex and broad folds immediately above i t will be discussed in the next chapter. A truncational re la tio ns h ip exists between the Scenic Point fa u lt and some minor contractional f a u l t s in its lower plate. Figs. 3-3 and 3-4 show that the beds of Altyn Formation in the lower plate were also cut by the Scenic Point f a u l t . This truncational rela tio nship suggests that at least some structures in the Scenic Point stru ctural complex predate the Scenic Point f a u l t . Structures in the upper plate of the Scenic Point f a u l t are r e l a t i v e l y simple on the north c l i f f of Scenic Point. Three high-angle (ca. 60-7 0°) normal f a u l t s , all located at the northeastern corner of Scenic Point (P la te 1), are present in the upper plate of the Scenic Point f a u l t (Figs. 3-3 and 3 - 4 ) . Two of them dip to the east, and one to the west. The strikes of these fa u lts are p a r a lle l to the trend of the fold hinges above the Scenic Point 60 structural complex (Plate 1). Offsets along these faults are small, approximately 3-8 meters. The two east- dipping normal fault s are terminated downward at the Scenic Point f a u l t . Whether the two normal f a u lts in the upper plate of the Scenic Point f a u l t are truncated downward by or merge downward with the Scenic Point f a u l t is not c le a r, as offsets along these normal f a u lt s are small (Fig. 3 -4 ). The west-dipping normal f a u l t is , however, o ffs e t by a west-dipping low-angle contractional f a u l t for about 15 meters (Figs. 3-3 and 3-4) which appears to branch off from the Scenic Point f a u l t (Fig. 3 - 3). This re la tio n s h ip suggests that the Scenic Point f a u l t predates the west-dipping normal f a u l t . Minor contractional fa u lts with displacement of 1-2 meters which appear to sole into the Scenic Point f a u l t are also observed on the north c l i f f of Scenic Point west of the structures shown in Figs. 3-3 and 3-4. Those minor contractional fault s dip predominantly to the west except one back thrust which dips to the east. The development of these predominant west-dipping, e a st-dir ected minor contractional fa u lts immediately above the Scenic Point f a u l t suggests that the transport dire c tion along the Scenic Point f a u l t is generally to the east. Hudec (1987) mapped a low-angle f a u l t , the Spot Mountain thrust f a u l t , in the Altyn Formation in an area 2 km north of the 61 study area. This f a u l t li es sub-parallel to bedding in its upper plate 1-20 m below the top of the Altyn Formation, Structures in the lower plate of the Spot Mountain f a u l t consist of complexly faulted and folded structural packages. Like the Scenic Point f a u l t , the Spot Mountain f a u l t is also broadly folded and truncates beds and some of the fa u lts in its lower plate. Steeply- dipping reverse fa u lts in the frontal zone of Hudec's area o ffs e t the Spot Mountain f a u l t and cut structures in its upper and lower plates (Hudec, 198 7). This relationship is, however, not clear in the study area because the relationships between the frontal zone and Scenic Point fa u lt are not d i r e c t l y observed. The Spot Mountain f a u l t may be c o r r e l a t i v e with the Scenic Point f a u l t because (1) both fa ult s l i e at s im ila r s t r a t i graphic levels , (2) deformational styles in t h e i r upper and lower plates of the two f a u lt s are s i m i l a r . Fig. 3-5 shows a tt it u d e s of a few f a u lt s in the Scenic Point f a u l t complex and s t r i a t io n s along the corresponding f a u l t s . The average s tri k e of the f a u lts o determined from this limited data set is N3 0 W.

S t r u c t u r a l l y , the zone occupies the eastern edge of the Lewis allochthon as presently exposed. To the west, structures in the frontal zone are s im il a r to those in the eastern structural b e l t , both contain east- and west-dipping contractional fa ults and concentric fo ld s . However, structures in the frontal zone are more in tensely deformed ( t i g h t e r folds which are commonly asymmetric and verge to the east, greater displacements along f a u l t s , and more closely spaced fa u lt s ) than those in the eastern structural belt (Fig. 3-1, Plates 1 and 2). In the frontal zone, east-dipping contractional f a u l t s dip more steeply (nearly vertica l and were lo c a l ly rotated to west-dipping apparent normal f a u l t s ) than in the eastern b e l t . Despite changes in structural styles along s t r i k e , this zone of complex structures and the eastern s tru ctu ra l b e lt can be traced to the north through areas mapped by Hudec (198 7) and G.A. Davis (unpublished map). Structures in the frontal zone are extremely complex. They consist of east-vergent open to t i g h t folds, west- dipping (synthetic) and east-dipping ( a n t i t h e t i c ) contractional and extensional f a u l t s , and pop-up structures (contractional fault-bounded horsts; Butler, 198 2). Cross-cutting rela tionships between these structures indic ate that m u ltip le episodes of deformation 65 Figure 3-6. a.

Cretaceous sediments °%**<> marker bed C, MBC : marker bed B, MBB 7 marker bed A, MBA t-- Altyn Formation 68 are responsible for its development. On the northeastern side of Head Mountain, a west-dipping reverse f a u l t with minimum displacement of 100 m juxtaposes Altyn rocks over member 2 of the Appekunny Formation (Plate 1). This f a u l t is cut by an east-dipping a n t i t h e t i c reverse f a u l t . This east-dipping f a u l t is in turn truncated from below by the Lewis th r u s t. The east-dipping reverse f a u l t can be traced southward from Head Mountain to the eastern side of Bison Mountain, which is f a u l t G in Fig. 3-6b. It can be seen in Fig. 3-6b that the dip d i re c t io n of f a u l t G on the eastern side of Bison Mountain is changed to the west. Such a change in dip dire c tio n of reverse f a u l t s along t h e i r s t r i k e were also recorded by Hudec (198 7) in the Spot Mountain area. For example, f a u l t C (Hudec, 1987, Plate 3) dips to the east in Hudec's northern area, but i t dips to the west in his southern area (see cross sections AA1 and DD1 in Plate 3, Hudec, 198 7). Such a change in dip dire c tion of f a u l t G in the study area and f a u l t C in Hudec's area along t h e ir s tr i k e indicates that these faults are not planar and may have been twisted a f t e r t h e i r formation. Structures of the frontal zone on the eastern side of the Bison Mountain are more complicated than those at Head Mountain. A complexly deformed structural package is bounded by a east-dipping reverse f a u l t zone ( f a u lts B, C, 69 and D in Fig, 3-6b) to the west, and by a west-dipping f a u l t ( f a u l t G in Fig, 3-6) with an extensional geometry to the east. Two high-angle f a u lt s within this structural package, fa u lt s E and F (Fig. 3- 6 b ) , e xhib it extensional geometries. A possible \"drag\" fold in the footwall of f a u l t E (Fig. 3-7) is an uncommon structure in the map area. A possible sequence of deformation responsible for the development of the frontal zone structures at the Bison Mountain area will be discussed in Chapter 4. Displacements along fro n t a l- z o n e fault s vary from several meters to more than 100 meters. Many are truncated sharply below by the Lewis thrust on the eastern side of Bison and Head Mountains. Cross sections through the frontal zone cannot be balanced because some a l 1ochthonous rocks and older structures that a f f e c t them have been cut off from below by the younger Lewis thrus t. The a t tit u d e s of l i m i t e d extensional and contractional fa u lt s in the frontal zone measured on the east side of Bison and Head Mountains are plotted in Fig. 3-8. The west-dipping fa u lts dip considerably shallower (less than 45 degrees) than the east-dipping faults (greater than 65 degrees). The s trik e of these f a u l t s varies from N25°E to N75°W, but the dominant s trike d i re c tio n is about N25oW. 7 0 Figure 3-7.

It contains broad synclines and a n t i c l i n e s (wavelength from 30 to 100 m) , southwest-dipping (synthetic) and no rtheast-dipping ( a n t i t h e t i c ) contractional f a u l t s , and minor extensional f a u lt s dipping both to the northeast and southwest. The boundary between the structures in the eastern stru c tu ra l belt and those in the frontal zone is t r a n s i t i o n a l . Structures in this 3 km-wide s tru c tu ra l belt are truncated upward by the overlying Brave Dog f a u l t and downward by the Lewis thrust f a u l t . To the west, contractional f a u l t s in the eastern belt dipping both eastward and westward are o ffs e t by the Mount Henry imbricate system (Pla te 1). Spacing between faults in the eastern belt ranges from 30 m to more than 150 m (Fig. 3-1, Plate 1). Faults in this belt are generally planar, although l i s t r i c thrusts have been observed. The s trik es of f a u lt s in the eastern belt are plotted in Fig. 3-9. The a t t it u d e s of the same set of fa ult s are plotted in Fig. 3-10. The dominant s t r i k e d i r e c tio n of these f a u lt s is N 2 0° W - N 3 0° W . Dip angles of contractional f a u l t s in this belt range from 10 to 70 degrees, but most f a u lt s have dips of 30 to 40 7 5 Figure 3-9.

Displacements along all these faults are small, generally less than 30 m. Symmetrical folds with wavelengths of 30 m to 100 m are well developed in this b e l t . Dip angles of fold limbs are shallow, usually from 5 to 20 degrees ( P la te 1). The o o average trend of the folds is N20W to N30W, an o r i e n t a t i o n p a r a lle l to the average strike of the major steep fa ult s in this b e l t . Many small-scale folds (wavelength from 0.5 to 2.0 m, amplitude from 0.5 to 1.0 m) are present on the limbs of open folds in the east b e l t . Their vergence ( i . e . , d i r e c t io n of te ctonic transport) is towards the hinges of the a n t i c l i n e s , suggesting the folding mechanism is f le x u r a l s l i p . The average trend of these small-scale folds (Fig. 3-11) is p a r a lle l to that of the open folds and the average s t r i k e of the f a u l t s in this structural b e l t . East- and west-dipping reverse fa ult s in the eastern structu ra l belt are truncated upward by the low-angle Brave Dog f a u l t . This r e l a t i o n s h i p is best exposed at Squaw Mountain and on the western c l i f f of Scenic Point. Fig. 3-12 shows that an east-d ipping reverse f a u l t is truncated above by the Brave Dog f a u l t which li es pa r a lle l to the bedding within its upper pla te .

An east-dipping contractional f a u l t in the eastern structural belt is truncated by the Brave Dog f a u l t (BDF). The p ictu re is viewed from northwest to southeast on the northwest side of Scenic Point. The Brave Dog f a u l t is p a r a l l e l to bedding of its upper plate and truncates a northeast-dipping minor f a u l t . The drag fold in the hanging wall of the minor f a u l t indicates that this f a u l t is a reverse f a u l t . 83 84 belt and the underlying Lewis thrust f a u l t is not clear because offsets along fa ults in the eastern belt are small, and the trace of the Lewis thrus t and lower portion of the eastern belt are covered by Quaternary morainal deposits and ta lu s . However, a l i n e of evidence suggests that structures in the eastern belt are truncated from below by the Lewis thrust. In the area mapped by Hudec (198 7), structures equivalent to these of the eastern belt and frontal zone in the w r i t e r ' s area are reported as being truncated from below by the Lewis thrust (Hudec, 1987). The i n t e n s i t y of deformation in the eastern structural belt decreases westward from the frontal zone. The westernmost structures in the belt are o ffs e t by fa u lts of the Mount Henry imbricate system at the southwestern corner of Scenic Point and northern side of Appistoki Peak (Plates 1 and 2 ). Elk Mountain Imbricate System The Elk Mountain imbricate thrust system (EMIS) was f i r s t mapped by Kelty (1986) at south-central Glacier Park. This imbricate system was o r i g i n a l l y named the Brave Dog Mountain imbricate system (K elty, 1986, p. 130). Yin et a l . (1986) referred to the system as the Elk Mountain imbricate system in order to avoid the confusion 85 with the Brave Dog f a u l t , a major low-angle f a u lt within the Appekunny Formation in southern Glacier Park. The Elk Mountain imbricate system consists of approximately 7 major west-dipping thrust f a u l t s that l i e above the Lewis thrust f a u l t and below the Brave Dog fault (Plate 3B, Kelty, 198 6). Thrusts in the system dip about 10 to 15 degrees at lower elevations and appear to f l a t t e n into the Lewis t h r u s t . At higher elevations these f a u l t s dip more s teep ly , from 40 to 60 degrees. At the highest levels of the imbricate system, the f a u l t s dip less steeply, from 30 to 40 degrees. The angles between thrust f a u lt s and bedding in the Appekunny Formation are about 25 to 30 degrees in the upper portion of the imbricate system. But f a u l t s and bedding are nearly p a r a l l e l to each other in the lower portion of the imbricate system; both dip at shallow angles (ca.20 degrees). This geometrical r e la t io n s h ip requires that the geometry of the thrust f a u lts in the Elk Mountain imbricate system is l i s t r i c . Kelty (1986) reported that some s t r u c t u r a l l y higher imbricate thrusts o f f s e t s t r u c t u r a l l y lower f a u l t s . He used th is stru ctu ra l re la tio ns h ip as evidence for hindward development of f a u l t s in the Elk Mountain imbricate system. Thrust fault s in the Elk Mountain imbricate system and the beds of the Appekunny Formation, are truncated from above by a 86 planar f a u l t , the Brave Dog f a u l t . This r e la t io n s h ip is best exposed at the south side of Brave Dog Mountain mapped by Kelty (see F i g . 39, Kelty, 1986). The Elk Mountain imbricate system can be extended from the area mapped by Kelty (1986) in southeastern Glacier Park to the western side of the study area mapped by the w r i t e r . On the northwestern c l i f f of Cloudcroft Peaks, the upper members (members 3 and 4 ?) of the Appekunny Formation is repeated by several thrust f a u l t s . These thrust fa ult s were mapped from a distance because of t h e i r i n a c c e s s i b i l i t y . Reverse o ffs e ts along the f a u l t s appear to be from 2 0 meters to 100 meters. At the top, these fa u lt s are terminated by a f a u l t that li es s u b - p a r a lle l to the bedding within its upper p l a t e , 100 to 150 m below the Appekunny-Grinnell contact. The minor thrust f a u l t s and the bedding-controlled f a u l t above them are in t e r p r e t e d to be c o r r e l a t i v e with thrust f a u l t s of the Elk Mountain imbricate system and the Brave Dog f a u l t r e s p e c t iv e ly . Brave Dog Fault The Brave Dog f a u l t was f i r s t mapped by Kelty (1986) at Brave Dog Mountain in the southern edge of Glacier National Park. This shallowly dipping f a u l t can be traced throughout at least 900 km2 the southern portion of Glacier National Park as shown in Fig. 3-1 and Plate 1 87 (K elty, 1987; this study). It dips about 2 to 3 degrees to the east along the southern edge of Glacier Park (K e l t y , 1986), and lies within the upper part of the Appekunny Formation. The f a u l t surface is p a r a l l e l to bedding in i t s upper pl ate, but cuts downsect ion eastward through its lower plate in the d i r e c t i o n of tr a n s p o r t. At Brave Dog Mountain, the f a u l t lies 2-3 m below Appekunny marker bed E, and about 150 m above marker bed D. Further to the east, this f a u l t gradually cuts downward through lowe r-pla te member 3 of the Appekunny Formation and cut out marker bed D in it s lower plate (K e lty , 1986). Since the Brave Dog f a u l t cuts downsection s t r a t i g r a p h i c a l ly , this f a u l t is extensional in the sense that the length of beds were extended by displacement along i t . In the study area (Plate 1), the Brave Dog f a u l t li es immediately under Appekunny marker bed E at Squaw Mountain, but f a r t h e r below, about 15 to 20 m, marker bed E at Scenic Point. Marker bed D is only l o c a l l y present on the eastern side of Appistoki Peak and is absent at Scenic Point to "
