        "text": "On February 3, Golden West Broadcasting Ltd. was licenced to operate a new FM station at Swift Current. It would broadcast on frequency 97.1 MHz with effective radiated power of 100,000 watts. Antenna height would be 140.4 metres. The format would be Contemporary Rock with an emphasis on material by local Prairie artists. It would play 40% Canadian music. Golden West owned CKSW-AM and CIMG-FM in Swift Current.\n\nCKFI-FM “Magic 97.1” signed on the air later in the year. Studios and offices were co-located with CKSW and CIMG at 134 Central Avenue.\n\nOn March 20, the CRTC administratively renewed the licence for CKFI-FM to August 31, 2012. On August 28, the licence was renewed to December 31, 2012.\n\nOn December 19, the CRTC renewed the licence of CKFI-FM to August 31, 2017. This short-term renewal would allow for an earlier review of the licensee’s compliance with its conditions of licence and with the Radio Regulations, 1986."
