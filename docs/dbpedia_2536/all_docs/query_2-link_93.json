        "text": "Massively Multiplayer Online (MMOs) Games are games played collaboratively in online simulated worlds that allow individuals to interact not only with in-game scripted content and challenges but also with other players. Popular MMO titles over the last decade include Ultima Online, Everquest, Lineage, Eve Online, Runescape, and World of Warcraft, the largest MMO on the market since 2004. In contrast to typical computer, console and mobile games, MMOs are characterized by large populations of players interacting in the same digital space simultaneously, allowing collaborative and competitive forms of in-game play. Such graphical worlds for joint play evolved out of earlier text-based MultiUser Dungeons (MUDs) and commonly feature extensive 3D terrain for exploration, quests, and play. In MMOs, individuals play digital characters or \" avatars \" that progressively improve or \" level up \" through successful completion on game content. Persistent social groups called \" guilds \" or \" clans \" commonly develop that allow players to game together over weeks, months and even years. Game content is designed to require players to work in teams that include diverse roles and abilities. Thus, in order to succeed at MMOs, players must develop their avatars, practice in-game skills, and work with other players. Given these social and technical features, players of a given MMO often develop a shared set of knowledge, skills, practices, values, and beliefs or \" culture \" of the game. This shared culture can be found at within guilds, across serve communities, and within a game's online fan base. MMOs are not just designed software; they are emergent cultures as well. While the rules of a given game title provide challenges, problems, and constraints that shape gameplay, it is the community that provides players a sense of what knowledge and performances are valued. This shared culture of a game community transforms a game's software into a player's inhabited worlds. As cultures, MMOs function as informal online learning environments in which players engage in individual and social forms of learning as they progress through the game. Much of the scholarly work on MMOs has thus taken a sociocultural approach, attending to the ways in which players enculturate and apprentice one another in the knowledge, skills and beliefs that characterize a given MMO world. \" Enculturation \" is the process by which an individual acquires the values and beliefs of their surrounding culture. \" Apprenticeship \" is the handing down of understanding and skill through joint engagement in a communally valued performance or competence. In MMOs, players enculturate and apprentice one another in multiple ways. Fellow gamers apprentice one another through joint activity in the game. No two players are equally matched on all aspects required for in-game success. As players with varying levels of expertise partner to overcome challenges and solve problems in the game world, the more able player (for that given task) tacitly teaches the less able player how to improve. In such activities, better players sequence and structure the shared task such that lesser able players can contribute to the activity at their own current level of competence while also modeling through their own actions what competent performance looks like. Through these interactions, more experienced players tacitly display the cultural values and beliefs of their community, thus enculturating newer players into what it means to \" play well. \" Another form of learning in MMOs is through the common practice of \" theorycrafting \" or the individual or collaborative analysis of game strategies and mechanics in order to maximize player success. Because MMOs are typically large worlds with multiple systems of game mechanics within them that interact (for example, the avatar customization system, the game mechanics behind a particularly challenging area or monster in the game), success with the game content often requires attention to the more complex aspects of the game system and how the components parts within those systems interact. Puzzling through such systems is complicated and often requires inquiry practices similar to those found in science"
