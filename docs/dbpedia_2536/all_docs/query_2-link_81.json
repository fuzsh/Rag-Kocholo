Near gospel really, and not just among young people and founders. Across generational lines, sentiments like those from Steve Jobs’ 2005 commencement at Stanford have been engraved into our collective consciousness: \", \"\\\"The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.\\\" \", \"In other words, follow your passion. There’s just one problem: \\\"‘Follow your passion’ is dangerous advice.\\\" \", \"That’s a troubling claim, but it comes straight from Cal Newport’s investigation into \\\"the details of how passionate people like Steve Jobs really got started\\\" as well as what scientists say predicts happiness and fuels great accomplishment. \", \"Newport’s not alone. In recent years, a host of leaders, academics, and entrepreneurs have all come to the same startling conclusion: nearly everything you’ve been told about following your passion is wrong. \", \"Here are seven habits you need instead. \", \"Ryan Holiday, author of Ego Is the Enemy:\", \"\\\"Your passion may be the very thing holding you back from power or influence or accomplishment. Because just as often, we fail with — no, because of — passion. ... [P]urpose deemphasizes the I. Purpose is about pursuing something outside yourself as opposed to pleasuring yourself.\\\" \", \"Until about a century ago, passion was a dirty word. Classical philosopher like Socrates and Marcus Aurelius saw passion as a liability not an asset: an insatiable and destructive force. Why? \", \"Chiefly because passion is dangerously self-centered. In fact, our own modern descriptions of passion betray this inward bend: \\\"I want to [blank]. I need to [blank]. I have to [blank].\\\" In most cases, whatever word finishes those sentences — regardless of how well meaning it might be — is overshadowed by the first. \", \"Purpose, on the other hand, is about them, not me. It reorients our focus onto the people and causes we’re trying to reach, serve, help, and love. In The Happiness Hypothesis, psychologist Jonathan Haidt describes this pursuit as a \\\"striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself. If you get these relationships right, a sense of purpose and meaning will emerge.\\\" \", \"Passion makes us bigger. Purpose connects us to something bigger and in doing so makes us right sized. \", \"Shaa Wasmund, author of Stop Talking, Start Doing:\", \"\\\"‘No’ is a far more powerful word than ‘Yes.’ Every ‘Yes’ said out of obligation or fear takes time away from the things and people we love. When an opportunity appears connected with your passion, it’s even trickier. Instead of snatching up everything that might get your closer to the life you want, give yourself the space to pick carefully.\\\" \", \"Good is the enemy of great. That’s how Jim Collins put it anyway. Learning to say \\\"No\\\" is easily one of the most vital skills we can cultivate. And yet, even if you’ve mastered \\\"No\\\" to the obvious stuff, passion rears its head. \", \"The blinding effect of passion leads us unthinkingly into projects and meetings that, in truth, are dead ends. Worse, they sap time and energy that would otherwise move us forward. When Tim Ferriss asked journalist Kara Swisher what message she’d put on a billboard for millions to see, her answer was a single word, \\\"Stop.\\\" \", \"And that’s what picking is all about: slow down, pause, evaluate, weigh, and only then make a clear-headed choice. Picking involves, first, putting a time buffer on our decisions, particularly decisions that appear \\\"connected with your passion.\\\" Second, running our choices by an objective third party: a friend or colleague who can call out our blind spots. \", \"Sleep on it. Reach out. The sun will rise tomorrow. And be ruthless with your \\\"No’s.\\\" \", \"Angela Duckworth, author of Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance:\", \"\\\"After you’ve discovered and developed interest in a particular area, you must devote yourself to the sort of focused, full-hearted, challenge-exceeding-skill practice that leads to mastery. You must zero in on your weaknesses, and you must do so over and over again, for hours a day, week after month after year.\\\" \", \"We all love shortcuts. The allure of getting more by doing less is seductive. But are there times when doing more equals more? Absolutely. \", \"The classic illustration comes from David Bayles and Ted Orland’s Art and Fear where a ceramics teacher divided his class into two groups. The first was told they’d be graded on quality. The other, quantity. To get an A, the quantity group was required to produce fifty pounds of clay pots. Not exactly an artistically inspired assignment. And yet, when grading time came, \\\"a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.\\\" \", \"What accounted for this reversal of expectations? \", \"Easy: while the quality group held back — laboring under perfectionism — the quantity group got busy. They practiced. And that’s good news. If greatness came down to passion — or worse, talent — then it’d be reserved for only a select few. Practice means greatness is doable ... one tiny step after another. \", \"Liran Kotzer, CEO of Woo.io:\", \"\\\"Passion is indeed very important, but what most people don't know is what’s needed to achieve their true potential. Whether it’s to acquire new skills, get a promotion, or achieve what they want, it all starts with having a plan based on real data and real-world options.\\\" \", \"The only word less sexy than practice is planning. And yet planning is a golden thread woven through the lives of artists, leaders, and entrepreneurs alike. The trick here is that plans need not be grandiose. Rather, they shouldn’t be. \", \"Optimism is wonderful when it comes to our dreams. However, when it comes to what’s next — the nitty-gritty actions that’ll get us there — optimism kills. Infected with passion, our plans lose touch with reality. We overestimate strengths and underestimate challenges. Beyond the \\\"real data and real-world options,\\\" we build castles in the sky. That’s one of the reasons platform like Woo, which lets you get feedback from companies and headhunters anonymously, are so valuable. \", \"Where passion disconnects us from reality, planning — especially planning of the SMART goal and number-crunching variety — drives home the true state of affairs. \", \"That true state rescues us from false expectations, show stoppers, and resentment. As a good friend of mine likes to say, \\\"The question when you’re trying to bring a dream into reality shouldn’t be, ‘What going to go right?’ It should be, ‘What’s going to go wrong?’\\\" \", \"Jason Stone, founder of Millionaire Mentor Inc.:\", \"\\\"Passion can only take you so far. After that, if you don't have the skills, the tools, the resources, the knowledge, and the track-record to move forward, take risks, and expand. Otherwise, you won’t be able to position yourself as an authority. Positioning is key to make sure you are ready when opportunity strikes!\\\" \", \"Humans are associative creatures. We think and act not in isolation but by comparing and contrasting. \", \"\\\"The basic approach of positioning,\\\" wrote Al Ries and Jack Trout in Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind, \\\"is not to create something new and different, but to manipulate what’s already up there in the mind, to retie the connections that already exist.\\\" This is especially true when it comes to how other people see us. \", \"Passionate people often come off as self-inflated. They’re legends in their own minds. Positioning means leveraging who you are and what you’ve done as a springboard to what’s next. It embraces the associate nature of other people and — while it still leaves room for confidence — acknowledges that how others perceive us is more real, at least to them, than how we see ourselves. \", \"Troy Osinoff, author of My Bad Parent: Do As I Say, Not as I Did:\", \"\\\"People that think they completely understand their world are the most susceptible to overlook new opportunities. Peripheral is about establishing an unwavering curiosity to use your existing knowledge in uncovering new patterns and trends both for the sake of your personal development as well as the success of your business or career.\\\" \", \"Passion makes us myopic. We become so focused on the desire inside us, we lose sight of what’s around us. Objectivity — the ability to see the world as it truly is — atrophies in the blinding light of passion. \", \"Adopting a peripheral perspective forces us to examine the margins. It widens our view. Rather than rush headlong into disaster, we’re able to spot not just the pitfalls but the opportunities we would have otherwise missed. \", \"How? By cultivating curiosity. Questions like, \\\"What am I missing? What am I ignoring? Who could give me a fresh take?\\\" are vital in every area of life. Likewise, so is putting ourselves in new situations, reading books outside our passions, and intentionally pursuing people who have nothing to do with what it is we think we want. \", \"Brian D. Evans, founder of Influencive and Inc. 500 Entrepreneur:\", \"\\\"The person who calls themselves a student is more a master than those who try to wear the title. Get up when you get knocked down. Come back stronger, faster, and (above all) smarter. The constant desire to learn and overcome has helped me achieve everything. You must persevere.\\\" \", \"Although it might sound odd, perseverance is as much about putting in effort as it is battling ego. Drunk on passion, masters are doomed to repeat failures in the name of \\\"pushing through.\\\" In contrast, students do more than hone their craft; they learn from their mistakes. \", \"Asked if the Patriot’s historic comeback in Super Bowl LI was his \\\"greatest game ever,\\\" Tom Brady replied: \\\"[W]hen I think of an interception return for a touchdown, some other missed opportunities in the first 37, 38 minutes of the game, I don’t really consider playing a good quarter-and-a-half, plus overtime as one of the ‘best games ever’ but it was certainly one of the most thrilling.\\\" \", \"Certainly Brandy persevered, and it’d be nice if that guaranteed success. But sometimes you won’t come back to win it. At least, not in the moment. Jobs will be lost. Pitches turned down. Relationships ended. And reviews harsh. \", \"Failure, however, isn’t just an inevitable stepping stone toward success. Rejection is part of success itself. As Louis CK put it to a budding comedian, \\\"The only road to good shows is bad ones. Just go start having a bad time and, if you don’t give up, you will get better.\\\" \", \"Understood rightly, no. But as the be-all-and-end-all?

And yes, it's got more antioxidants, too—including resveratrol, that famous compound billed as the miracle in chocolate and vino.\", \"But recent research has given resveratrol the side eye as the reason for wine's healthy glow. The aptly-named inCHIANTI study, a 16-year-long look at the blood, urine and dietary questionnaires of hundreds of people living in the Italian wine-making region of Chianti, recently found that resveratrol wasn't associated with disease or lifespan, to the shock and dismay of wine lovers everywhere. But that doesn't mean red wine does nothing for you—just that resveratrol might not be compound that deserves all the credit. \\\"Many studies have shown that moderate alcohol consumption, especially wine, is associated with lower cardiovascular disease and mortality compared with both no alcohol consumption or consumption above moderate,\\\" says Luigi Ferrucci , founder of the inCHIANTI study and now scientific director of the National Institute on Aging. \\\"The mechanism of this association is not clear, and does not appear to be related to resveratrol.\\\"\", \"And even if it does have a positive effect, some experts say there's likely not enough in a glass to make a difference. \\\"Despite the common belief, resveratrol content in wine is very low, highly variable and thus unpredictable ,\\\" says Juan Carlos Espín , a research professor in the department of food science and technology at the Spanish National Research Council who studies the compound.

That's higher than expected and poses a clear and massive hurdle for Republicans as they attempt to convince dozens of skeptical members.\", \"But there's another number that paints a particularly dire picture for the GOP's alternative — especially in light of President Trump's populist rhetoric.\", \"According to the CBO, 64-year olds making $26,500 per year would see their premiums increase by an estimated 750 percent by 2026. While they are on track to pay $1,700 under the current law, the CBO projects the American Health Care Act would force them to pay $14,600. Even if you grant that inflation will allow them to make slightly more money by 2026, that's still about half of their income going to health care.\", \"Here's how that looks as a percentage of income (h/t Philip Bump):\", \"As skeptics of the law noted, that suggests the reason premiums as a whole will eventually decline is because older, poorer people simply won't be able to afford it. The legislation reduces premiums substantially for younger people but increases them substantially for older people — and especially poorer, older people — according to the CBO.\", \"The CBO's estimate of the premium increases for older, poorer Americans is actually worse than a previous one from AARP. Here's what AARP, which has announced its opposition to the bill, said last week:\", \"... Our estimates find that, taken together, premiums for older adults could increase by as much as $3,600 for a 55-year old earning $25,000 a year, $7,000 for a 64-year old earning $25,000 a year and up to $8,400 for a 64-year old earning $15,000 a year.\", \"If you're a Republican looking at these numbers, you have to be concerned — just from a self-preservation standpoint.\", \"Republican leaders have made great pains to argue that the CBO's estimate of the millions who will lose insurance is faulty, or even that it's a necessary side effect of returning to a more free-market approach to health care. But the GOP's counter-argument is predicated on the idea that its alternative would at least allow people access to coverage. Paying such a substantial portion of one's income on health insurance doesn't meet that goal — if, in fact, the CBO's estimate is anywhere close to accurate.\", \"It also affects a group of voters who are integral to the Trump Coalition. Less-formally educated and lower-income white Americans were the backbone of the electoral shift that allowed President Trump to be elected, and he has promised them the world: Coverage that is even more affordable than the Affordable Care Act and \\\"insurance for everybody.\\\"\", \"On top of all that, older people are much more likely to vote than younger people, especially in a midterm election like 2018. So basically, Trump's win was built on older, poorer people, for whom this law appears to drive up premiums and drive down the insurance rate, while benefiting the younger and wealthier.\", \"That's not something that will assure skeptical Republicans at all — even if they can get past that 24 million number.\" ]\n\nThis may be the most brutal number in the CBO report\n\nA 750 percent premium increase for the Trump Coalition's signature voter?\n\nahca, health care, aaron blake, the fix, obamacare replacement\n\nnull\n\nnull\n\n{ \"source\": \"anonymized\", \"humanSpoiler\": null, \"spoilerPublisher\": null }\n\n[ \"750 percent\" ]\n\n[ [ [ 2, 109 ], [ 2, 120 ] ] ]\n\n[ \"phrase\" ]\n\n917e1106-413c-4be5-818b-ad500314feaa\n\n430433533899710464\n\n[ \"#TeenMom2 star @PBandJenelley_1 reveals the sex of her second child through social media\" ]\n\nTwitter\n\n[ \"\\\"Teen Mom 2\\\" star Jenelle Evans took to Twitter and Instagram Monday (Feb. 3) to announce that she and boyfriend Nathan Griffin are expecting a baby boy.\", \"Evans has faced criticism for the pregnancy, largely because she does not currently have custody of her first child, 4-year-old Jace.

We asked the experts for their best advice on where and how to cash in.\", \"By Lynn Andriani\", \"Start With Your Wardrobe\", \"David Weinrot, chief marketing officer at the coupon code site Tada!, says apparel is the top category for sitewide coupon codes (flowers and home goods are big, too), since there's so much inventory and retailers constantly need to make room for new items. Clothing is also where you'll find the biggest discounts, says Daniel Washburn, general manager of another coupon-code site, Coupon Mountain. While some sites broadcast a \\\"25% off today only!\\\" coupon code at the top of their home page, more use coupon sites (which get a commission of about 5 percent when you click on a code) to get the word out. There are a couple of tricks to finding these money-saving treasures, aside from searching for a store name with a term like \\\"coupon\\\" or \\\"coupon code,\\\" says Sarah Jones, coupon editor at DealNews.com. For clothing, she searches the brand name and style name (e.g., \\\"Michael Kors Chain Lace-Up Shirtdress\\\") plus the word \\\"coupon.\\\" Then she searches for coupons for stores that sell the item, to see what they are currently offering. The idea is to do a mix of general and specific searches to see what comes up.\", \"Upgrade Your Electronics Piece by Piece\", \"Tech retailers, such as TigerDirect and Newegg, release the most coupon codes, says Jones -- but you won't find 30 percent off everything sitewide with those retailers. Since the category has such small margins, stores can't afford to discount widely; instead, they offer codes that give heavy discounts for particular items. For the quickest results, Jones likes to search by model number (this works especially well for electronics and computers).\", \"Shop At The Beginning Of The Month -- Or On A Monday\", \"Most retailers release their codes onto sales channels at the beginning of the month, and the majority expire on the 15th or 30th. In particular, Weinrot says retailers that sell items that need replenishing -- such as vitamins, diapers and contact-lens solutions -- tend to release coupon codes early in the month, since they know that's when people tend to restock. You can look for codes throughout the month on Mondays, since many stores rotate new offers on a weekly basis, says Jones.\", \"Do The Math\", \"Prices vary widely: You might find that one store's price without a coupon might be better than another store's price with one. Also consider shipping costs. For instance, a store that has everyday free shipping may have a price that comes out lower with a 10-percent-off coupon than another store's 20-percent coupon with shipping charges added, says Jones. A general rule of thumb: For smaller purchases, take a free shipping code over a code for 10 percent off; for larger purchases, 10 percent (or more) off will probably save you more money than free shipping would.\", \"Know Who Discounts\", \"Some stores rarely or never offer coupon codes (Jones cites Walmart and Zappos as examples).
