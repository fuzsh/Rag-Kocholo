        "text": "Bell Media has found a buyer for three of the AM stations it announced it wanted to divest itself of during a June reorganization that saw the company shutter six other AMs. CINA Radio Group founder and CEO Neeti P. Ray is making a play to buy CHAM and CKOC Hamilton and CKWW Windsor, pending CRTC approval. The proposed sale, which would see Ray acquire the assets of the stations for $445,000, is one of three matters set to come before the commission at a Feb. 8 hearing in Gatineau. CHAM-AM Hamilton is currently branded as Funny 820, CKOC-AM Hamilton as BNN Bloomberg Radio 1150, and CKWW-AM Windsor as oldies station, Motor City Favourites. Ray’s application says he plans operate the stations on the same terms and conditions to ensure continuity.

New, unwrapped toy donations for newborns and children up to 18 years (with preference given to toys with an outer package or cover) are being accepted at the official Wish drop-off locations, including: The Wish Warehouse (1366 Blundell Road, Mississauga) and the Main Lobby of Bell Media Studios (299 Queen Street West, Toronto).\n\nSiriusXM Canada has been named the Toronto Raptors official audio music streaming partner under a new multi-year partnership that encompasses halftime shows, a DJ duel, and a new branded arcade game fans will be able to play through the Raptors official mobile app, as well as a state-of-the-art projection game.

Hollywood Exiles is the story of how Chaplin’s grandfather, Charlie Chaplin, became a key figure in a decades-long FBI campaign aimed at rooting out communism from Hollywood. The podcast unravels the real-life events that led to the notorious House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) hearings and the era of the infamous “Hollywood blacklist.” The 10-part series will be available on BBC Sounds, CBC Listen, and most global podcast platforms. It will also be broadcast on BBC World Service radio. Earlier this year, BBC and CBC released the award-winning Love, Janessa and have another show planned for later in 2024.\n\nChris Connor, an alum of Fredericton radio stations, CFNB, CIBX and CKHJ, and a former play-by-play announcer for the American Hockey League’s Fredericton Canadiens, is the subject of a new GoFundME campaign.

The fundraiser has set a goal of $40,000.\n\nCanada Black Music Archives (CBMA) is officially launching a digital repository dedicated to preserving and celebrating the musical heritage of Black Canadians.

Kirk, who has grown Durham Radio from a single station in Ajax, ON in 1994 to seven stations today, used his acceptance speech to take aim at the CRTC – which was notably absent from this year’s gathering, as well as big broadcasters practicing widespread consolidation. Broadcast Dialogue – The Podcast caught up with Kirk following this year’s awards presentation to talk about everything from the current regulatory environment to industry viability and strategic decision-making."
