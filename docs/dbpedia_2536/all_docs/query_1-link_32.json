All times listed are Eastern Standard Time (EST).\n\n540 NL Grand Falls-Windsor CBT Having left the air after completing the required three month AM-FM simulcast that started when CBT-FM officially signed on to replace CBT-AM, CBK from Saskatchewan and XEWA from Mexico are now being heard by DXers in Newfoundland.\n\n990 YT Watson Lake CBDB Noted by an Alberta DXer, all alone January 24th from 1400-1440 just after CBW faded out, after being almost as strong as CBW before that. CBDB is 400 watts during the day and this reported reception was from a distance of 1100 miles.\n\n1140 AB High River CHRB Very strong into Ontario at midnight January 23rd -24th in unusual DX conditions.\n\n1210 SK Kindersley CFYM Noted January 25th with local breaks mentioning only CFYM and its app, confirming previous speculation that, despite simulcasting CHAB-800, CFYM inserts local ads, announcements and IDs. Presumably, the same is true for Saskatchewan’s CKSW-570, CJSN-1150, CFSL-1190 and CJYM-1330. And, of course, for CHAB itself.\n\n1540 ON Toronto CHIN Heard in Chicago on January 19th at 0820 with a discussion in Mandarin. Over KXEL Waterloo IA.\n\n1610 ON Toronto CHHA Noted in Edmonton late in the evening on January 24th with its strongest signal ever heard, reaching one-quarter to one-third on the signal strength display of a CCRadio-2E on two brief fade-ins. Although the station is now licensed for 10KW at night, it is only the equivalent of a 7KW two tower directional array. CHHA uses a single tower with a powered Guy Wire that creates a null towards CHRN-1610 Montreal QC. A retired Chief Engineer from the U.S. recently stated that the FCC does not allow powered Guy Wires. Canada does, recognizing that it is only 70% efficient.\n\nCanadian Radio News (CRN) posts on https://radiowest.ca by Dan Sys provide much of the information for this column, with additional tips from Allen Willie, VE6WZ, Saul Chernos and Greg Harris.\n\nIRCA DX Monitor Feb 3, published Jan 29 via WOR iog (2024-01-30)\n\nRe.: https://mediumwave.info/2024/01/25/germany-27/\n\nInformation missing from the Radio Magazine article:\n\n“The trading pawn in the hands of the U. S. had been the megawatt long wave transmitter located in Munich. The record shows that when the Soviets stopped jamming the VOA Russian programs in June of 1963, the VOA megawatt transmitter in Munich shut down very soon thereafter. In August 1968, when the Soviets resumed jamming of the VOA. […] the megawatt in Munich returned to the air. Again, in September of 1973 Soviet jamming against the VOA stopped and a month later the megawatt transmitter on 173 kHz went off the air. This off again-on again relation was rooted in the 1948 European Broadcasting Conference at Copenhagen where medium wave and long wave frequencies were assigned to the participating countries within Europe. Under the plan, 173 kHz was assigned to the USSR. […] The presence of the VOA megawatt transmitter in Munich appearing on the same frequency caused an acerbic reaction – the Soviets took the position that their 500 kW signal on 173 kHz from Moscow was being jammed”. (W.Edwards. Longwave Duel)\n\n“The Senate Foreign Relations Committee had a good laugh about what the State Department thought it was doing with the Munich transmitter in the hearings on the future of RFE and RL in May 1971. It broadcast on the same frequency as Radio Moscow but Martin Hillenbrand, assistant secretary for the European bureau of the State Department denied that the VOA was jamming in a technical sense. “They were merely broadcasting a perfectly intelligible programme on the same wavelength.” he said. The frequency, 173, had been allocated to Radio Moscow by the 1948 Copenhagen agreement but the State Department argued that because Germany was not a party to the Convention it was in order for the VOA to use it.” (War of the Black Heavens, Broadcasting in the Cold War, Michael Nelson)\n\nMike Barraclough (2024-01-26)\n\nIndia is celebrating its 75th Republic Day on January 26, 2024.\n\nOn this occasion the following special program will be broadcasted by Akashvani/Doordarshan :\n\n26 January 2024 (Friday)\n\nAkashvani/Doordarshan will broadcast running commentary of the Republic Day parade and Cultural Pageant being held at New Delhi, all stations of Akashvani will broadcast the same.\n\nCommentators – Muinsh Jolly, Bhuvan Apoorva Jha, Anup Kaur, Vaibhav Jyotsna Srivastva\n\nThe commentary will be available on all SW, MW and FM channels।of Akashvani as follows from 0420 UTC (9.40 am IST) :\n\nHindi 9950, 11560 via New Delhi 100 kW\n\nEnglish 15280 via Bengaluru 500 kW\n\nThis will replace the External Services normally scheduled at this time on the above frequencies.\n\nThe only regional SW to check is Leh 4760/6000\n\nMW Frequencies : http://www.qsl.net/vu2jos/mw/freq.htm\n\nFM Frequencies : http://www.qsl.net/vu2jos/fm/airfreq.htm\n\nAlso on DTH Channels/ airlivenews 24×7\n\nAIR Live streaming :\n\nhttps://prasarbharati.gov.in/get-apps/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfTD19QYceI\n\nThis will be available on Doordarshan TV as follows:\n\nhttps://prasarbharati.gov.in/live-tv/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/doordarshannational\n\nThe above programs can be viewed on Live streaming of various Doordarshan TV Channels available in the following link:\n\nhttps://prasarbharati.gov.in/live-tv/\n\nThe live streaming of AIR stations is available through News on AIR app available in:\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parsarbharti.airnews&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5wYXJzYXJiaGFydGkuYWlybmV3cyJd\n\nHappy Republic Day to all DX India members.\n\nYours sincerely, Jose Jacob & Alokesh Gupta to dxindia iog (2024-01-26)\n\nGoogle translated from French:\n\nOn January 25, 1954, 70 years ago, the Voice of America broadcast for the first time on longwave to Eastern countries. The transmitter was located about twenty kilometers from Munich in the territory of the municipality of Erching (48°18’12.0″N 11°43’08.9″E).\n\nThe station was built in 1953. Its transmitter was a Continental Electronics 105C, it broadcast on 173 kHz with a power of 1000 kW. At the time, it was the most powerful long-wave transmitter in Western countries. The antenna consisted of a 256 meter mast, insulated to the ground and equipped with twelve guy wires extending from the top.\n\nDuring the day, the transmitter broadcast programs in German, provided by RIAS (Berlin’s American Sector Radio). During the Voice of America programs were broadcast in the languages of the Warsaw Pact countries.\n\nFrom 1964 only VOA broadcasts used the transmitter, RIAS no longer used it.\n\nThe frequency of 173 kHz was not allocated to Germany. It must be remembered that during the Copenhagen Conference, the German states were not among the signatory countries. It was therefore a frequency used without any legal basis.\n\nFaced with the importance that the station was gaining on the other side of the wall, in 1972, the Soviet Union began to install, on the same frequency, several powerful transmitters, along the western border (Minsk, Kaliningrad, Lvov) .\n\nIn 1973, the VOA transmitter was turned off, because listening in Eastern countries had become impossible. The installation was donated to the German Federal Post. It was a poisoned chalice!\n\nThe Bundespost wanted to use the installation to broadcast the DLF program on 209 kHz. The new frequency coordination of the Geneva plan granted 209 kHz with 500 kW in the Munich area.\n\nBy resuming operation of the station, the Bundespost quickly became disenchanted: The transmitter operated with American current at 60 Hz. This made it impossible to connect the transmitter to the 50 Hz electrical network: it was obligatory to produce the current by means of groups that consumed 4,500 liters of diesel per day.\n\nIn the absence of another solution, the post office nevertheless resumed distribution from July 4, 1979.\n\nA new problem was that the transmitter could only be used during the day from 5:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Nighttime operation was not possible, as the Kiev transmitter would have been disrupted on the same frequency. To be able to use it at night, the station has to build a new directional antenna.\n\nThe Bundespost also notes that the transmitter was running out of steam and that modernization was impossible.\n\nAt this time, the project for the new Munich Franz-Josef-Strauss airport was released, which was to be located 4 kilometers away. It became impossible to build a new antenna.\n\nThis will be the definitive end of the Erching site. In 1987, a long-wave transmitter center was built in Aholming Deggendorf in Lower Bavaria to permanently replace the VOA transmitter center in Erching.\n\nThe transmitter in Erching was finally switched off on December 31, 1988 and ownership was handed over to the Federal Intelligence Service (BND). The system may have been used for a time as a “numbers station” to communicate with agents overseas. It was then abandoned and left to vandals.\n\nRadio Magazine FB group (2024-01-25)"
