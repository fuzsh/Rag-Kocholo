BROADCASTING, October 3, 1960 CLOSED CIRCUIT* Still another ■ There may be fifth \"great debate\" between Nixon and Ken- nedy after all. Originally Democrats wanted five and Republicans three, with four settled upon as compromise. Now it's learned Nixon forces might go for fifth on or about Oct. 31. Networks are all but committed since they guaranteed maximum of eight hours, double the number now spoken for. Censorship? ■ FCC is counting spots again and finds itself again divided on extent of its authority on program is- sues. In sending \"promise vs. perform- ance\" inquiry (McFarland) letters to two stations (WAVZ New Haven, Conn.; KORD Pasco, Wash.) advising them that renewals indicate necessity of hearing, FCC split 4-3. (See story page 78.) Commissioner Craven asked that minutes show he regarded letters as attempt at censorship in violation of Section 326 of Communications Act and that it was \"persecution\" of small stations. Commissioners Hyde and King joined in dissent, but not necessarily in his observations. Left out ■ Some network feathers were ruffled by NAB presidential selection committee in last week's activity which brought Florida's Gov. LeRoy Collins' name to negotiating stage (see story page 27). Networks, it seems, were not consulted or even formally notified, and consistent with practice, won't be until special board meeting is held, now tentatively set for next Monday, Oct. 10. Then network representatives on radio and tv boards will get word, assuming, of course, that in interim proposed contract is evolved. ABC has been disturbed since last March when announcement of eight-man selection committee disclosed no ABC affiliate on group. This, NAB officials assert, was happenstance. Selection committee members con- fide that Gov. Collins, at luncheon conference Sept. 22, exhibited remark- able understanding of broadcasters' problems and that he was \"persuasive, articulate, bright and intelligent.\" And, like any good salesman, \"he wasn't afraid to ask for the order.\" Meaty agenda ■ When NAB board meets in special session, there will be more on agenda than ratification of selection of Gov. Collins of Florida as NAB's next president. Among other topics: pay-tv hearing called by FCC to consider Hartford test; community an- tennas and effect on tv stations in small areas; Federal Aviation Agency's juris- dictional claims over towers. Tv earnings ■ National Airlines has re- vealed some figures clearly showing why it's putting up fight to keep its WPST- TV Miami on ch. 10. In registration statement filed with Securities & Ex- change Commission, airline reports WPST-TV during year ended June 30, 1960, had net income of $177,152 (after payment of $60,580 in manage- ment fees to parent company) and earned surplus of $11,854. In same pe- riod parent National Airlines showed net loss of almost $4 million. WPST- TV was shown in SEC statement to be capitalized at $2,500. National states it can't predict out- come of present litigation over ch. 10, which FCC withdrew from National and granted to L.B. Wilson Inc. But in SEC statement National advises stockholders that if it were forced to liquidate Pub- lic Service Television (subsidiary own- ing WPST-TV), no material loss would be incurred. Debate 'commercial' ■ Bid for plug on Oct. 7 Nixon-Kennedy debate has quietly been made by American Heri- tage Foundation, non-partisan group promoting registration and get-out vote campaigns in cooperation with Adver- tising Council. It's understood founda- tion would supply film clip featuring chairman of Democratic and Repub- lican national committees. As if tv networks didn't have enough trouble reaching agreement on their joint newspaper ad promoting first Nixon-Kennedy all-network broadcast (Closed Circuit, Sept. 19), more trouble developed after it ran. As it finally appeared, ad was signed by ABC, CBS and NBC \"television and radio networks,\" which drew blistering reaction from Mutual on grounds that its radio-only network had been slighted. Mutual authorities claimed they were told in advance that ad, co- ordinated by Television Information Office, was for tv networks only. They decided against formal protest after ad appeared with plug for radio rivals, but word is that informal complaints were heated. Fm boxoffice ■ Medium of fm is being studied by moviemen for special ticket- selling assignment. In talking stage now is fm campaign next month for War- ner Bros.' \"Sunrise at Campobello.\" WB agency for this picture, currently in re- lease in five major markets, is Blaine- Thompson Co., N.Y. Roosevelt story is slated for bookings around the country around Thanksgiving holiday. One less week ■ For first time in dec- ade there'll be no National Television Week, normally observed in November. NAB has no explanation, but it's under- stood Tv Board did not take up matter at June meeting through it was on agenda. Recent Tv Weeks have been marked by colossal indifference by pub- lic and by some of participating associa- tions. In contrast, National Radio Month has been building up momentum since it graduated from one- to four-week observance, held in May. NAB and re- lated groups have developed intensive promotional campaigns in all parts of country and claim results are reward- ing. British debates ■ Charles Fletcher- Cooke, British M.P. and member of Queen's Council, was so impressed with Nixon-Kennedy appearance last Mon- day that he proposed to recommend same kind of exposure in British elec- tions. Format problem is involved, however, because candidates do not run for prime minister, but for Parliament, with victorious party then choosing its leader. Mr. Fletcher-Cooke, who par- ticipates on weekly tv panel over Gra- nada network, is in U.S. making study for Associated Television on part tv and radio play in elections. Mr. Fletcher-Cooke also foresees commercial radio in Britain to com- pete with BBC's non-commercial opera- tion, but feels this will come in \"pack- age deaf,\" perhaps in 1964 when re- cently named Royal Commission will report findings on proposal that second commercial tv operation be established to compete with present Independent Television Authority operations as well as sustaining BBC-TV. Related prob- lems deal with standardization of defini- tion to European system of 625 lines (British use 515) as well as spectrum allocations. Space study ■ Importance of space communications is underscored in ap- pointment by State Dept. of FCC Com- missioner T.A.M. Craven to chairman- ship of new government study group to consider policy on international com- munications by means of space satellite relays, functioning under Telecom- munications Coordinating Committee (TCC) . Such matters as allocations, in- terference controls, costs, number of satellites that can be shot into space without creating control problems and methods of policing are all on agenda. Represented on new Craven committee will be NASA (space agency); FCC, Army, Navy and Air Corps, OCDM, Coast Guard and USIA.

Favoring move, which also involves changes in adjacent channel mileage separation and use of directional an- tennas, was host of uhf grantees and prospective applicants for tv. Opposing were most established vhf stations. Gen- eral attitude was similar to stations and groups filing earlier (see page 76). CBS proposed vhf drop-ins at 12 cities and asked FCC to consider public investment in tv sets, implement rule- making on over-all instead of case-by- case basis and to define \"important markets\" as those with more than 70,000 tv homes. CBS also suggested some existing outlets in such markets could be \"moved in\" closer on sub- standard basis. NBC said it would not object to com- mission's proposal to drop in vhf chan- nels but urged that FCC itself set up list of cities needing such aid rather than permitting helter skelter moves. It suggested that no interim vhf assign- ments be made to any tv market with less than 400,000 population. Network also opposed any changes in tv rules or standards at this time. Since vhf short- mileage drop ins require exceptions to present rules, there is no need to change rules in same proceeding, NBC said. RCA submitted report of Dr. George H. Brown, RCA engineering vp, on feasibility of directional antennas for tv. Conclusion: Use of DAs is feasible and might help in current problem. RCA made no comment on reduction of mileage factors or other considera- tions in rulemaking proposal. CBS Radio affiliates hear Wash, appraisal For broadcasters, Washington is ev- erybody's business. Maintaining high standards won't guarantee immunity from governmental attack, but letting down those standards will guarantee \"ultimate defeat\" for broadcasting. This theme was stressed by Richard Salant, CBS vp, in address at closed session of CBS Radio Affiliates Convention pre- ceding day (see story page 62). Broadcasters' best defense against governmental encroachment, especially in programming, \"is careful and tem- perate presentation of our viewpoint [along with] good programming sched- ule,\" Mr. Salant said. Mr. Salant expected Justice Dept. would \"sooner or later\" challenge tv option time's legality in court, but hoped issue would remain limited to television. He said network regulation, which he expected to be big issue in next congressional session, need not be \"disastrous\" but could be, depending on what tack it takes. In another closed-session speech to CBS Radio affiliates, CBS Inc. President Frank Stanton said Nixon-Kennedy joint appearance on all networks \"marked the broadcasting industry's greatest single step forward since March 13, 1938, when CBS Radio's World News Roundup, in its first broad- cast, presented on-the-scene reports of Hitler's entry into Vienna.\" He esti- mated 8 million heard first Nixon-Ken- nedy discussion on radio, in addition to 75 million on tv. In follow-up obser- vation Friday, Dr. Stanton said \"one of the most significant aspects\" of Ken- nedy-Nixon encounters \"is the expos- ure of both sides to both sides.\" ABC Radio adds nine ABC Radio has added nine affiliates bringing network total to 325, Robert R. Pauley, ABC vice president in charge of radio network, announced last week. Political panelists Newsmen panelists to appear on networks' pooled telecast Oct. 7 of second Kennedy-Nixon tv dis- cussion in Washington were an- nounced Friday (Sept. 30). Net- works selected two — Edward P. Morgan of ABC and Paul Niven of CBS — while Harold Levy, Washington correspondent for Long Island Newsday, and Alvin Spivak, United Press International Washington staff, were chosen by lot from correspondents traveling with presidential candidates. Pierre Salinger, news secretary to Sen. Kennedy, and Herbert G. Klein, news secretary to Vice President Nixon drew names. Frank McGee of NBC News will be moderator (see earlier story, page 88). New stations are KAGT Anacortes, Wash.; WMEK Chase City, Va.; KOOS Coos Bay, Ore.; WWHG Hornell, N.Y.; KAAB Hot Springs, Ark.; KWBA Houston; WPGW Portland, Ind.; KFMJ Tulsa, and WNSM Val- paraiso, Fla. Stations will clear for all network programming, Mr. Pauley said, and bring ABC Radio coverage figure to 47,472,000 radio homes, or 96% of radio homes in country. Hollywood stars face FCC study Top-flight tv film performers and production chiefs will testify Oct. 10 before FCC in Los Angeles when hear- ing on tv programming convenes Oct. 10 in U.S. Court of Appeals there.

Schulke, Paramount Tele- vision; George Shupert, MGM; Frank Cooper, Cooper Assoc.; Taft Schreiber, Revue Productions. Hearing is continuance of network study by FCC which so far has led to reduction in option time and displace- ment of networks from spot repre- sentation.

WEEK'S HEADLINERS P George S. Dietrich, di- Jr rector of NBC Radio Spot Sales since 1955, promoted to station man- ager of WNBC-AM-FM New York. Position has been unfilled for eight months. Frederick T. Lyons Jr., eastern sales manager of NBC Radio Spot Sales, succeeds Mr. Dietrich as director. Both appoint- ments are effective today (Oct. 3). Mr. Dietrich joined NBC Spot Sales as account executive in 1950, moved up to eastern sales manager in 1953, national sales manager in 1954 and then director.

Brown Bolte, SSC&B's president, named vice chairman, and Alfred J. Seaman, who was vice chairman and chairman of executive committee, elected president in realignment announced by S. Heagan Bayles, chairman of board and chief executive officer. Mr. Bayles said changes were made to provide greater concentration on client service, resulting from agency's growth which he described in terms of current $65 million billing, or 63% over total of two years ago. Mr. Seaman left Compton Adv. in April 1959 where he was executive vp and cre- ative director to take top level post with SSC&B. Mr. Bolte had been executive vp of Benton & Bowles, leaving that position in 1958 to become SSC&B's president. Mr. Sullivan is one of agency founders, had been president be- fore becoming board chairman in 1958 and founder chair- man in June of this year (Broadcasting, June 6, 1960). C. M. Rohrabaugh, board chairman and chief executive officer of Kudner Adv., New York, has relinquished his title of chief executive officer but will continue as chairman. Mr. Rohrabaugh had planned to retire at end of this year Mr. Reeves Mr. Seymour but at request of agency's board he has agreed to continue as chairman. Charles R.

Mr. Seymour is vp and director of radio-tv and member of board, assuming former on joining agency in 1955 and becoming elected to the latter in 1958. Prominent figure in radio (and later tv) for years, Mr. Seymour started in radio in 1935 with Yankee Network in Boston, was with CBS in New York, leaving in 1940 to freelance, was associated for 13 years with We the People, joining Young & Rubicam where he served for six years, becoming member of plans board and vp in charge of radio-tv. Also announced in new shifts — which agency emphasized were first major ones since last June when its President Norman Strouse also became chief executive officer and, it indicated, were tied to his emphasis on creative phases of advertising services — were elections of Wallace Elton, vp and director, to executive committee, and William D. Laurie Jr., manager of Detroit office since 1959, to board of directors. Henry White, national sales manager of Screen Gems Inc., New York, resigns to join WNTA-TV New York as vp and gen- eral manager, effective today (Oct. 3), filling vacancy created when Malcolm Klein joined KHJ-TV Los Angeles as vp and general manager several months ago. Mr. White served Screen Gems for six years, and earlier had been manager of the Biow Co., New York, and associated di- rector of network programs CBS-TV. Carl Lindemann Jr., vp of program sales, NBC-TV, since last April, elected program vp for California National Productions, NBC's film syndication subsidiary.

Here's the prescription for sales success: advertise on WPAT. A balm to Greater New York, we're a positive tonic to the men who make and market America's leading drug products, cosmetics and toiletries. Listened to throughout 31 counties in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut where more than 17,000,000 people live, work and buy in more than 5,000,000 radio homes, WPAT is heard and pre- ferred, among other places, in more of the Metropolitan area's 6,000 independent retail pharma- cies than any other station. That's what we call point-of-purchase penetration in depth. And there's no doubt that it moves merchan- dise. Which probably explains why our drug product, cosmetic and toiletry advertising has in- creased 327% in the past three years, thanks to advertisers like these : Bell Mack Laboratories, A . Brioschi, Bristol-Myers, Colgate- Palmolive Company, Coty, Lever Brothers, Miles Laboratories, Pomatex, Prince Matchabelli, Schick, Shampion, Shulton, Squibb Pharmaceutical, Sterling Drug, Warner-Lambert Pharma- ceutical.

SCBA's view of KYA plan editor: Have just read the editorial in your Sept. 19 issue referring to KYA and its recently adopted policy to ad- here to certain commercial standards. I don't feel that it reflects the very strong opinions voiced by me and other broad- casters about your original KYA story Sept. 5. I think after perusal of the 16 points outlined by Mr. [Mort] Wagner [gen- eral manager of KYA] you will agree that they are certainly not revolution- ary and should not be referred to as a great crusade for purity. — Robert M. Light, President, Southern California Broadcasters Assn. Agencies 'hear' radio editor: Cheers, kudos, congratulations and hooray for the fellows at WBZ Radio in Boston, who have given us media people an extraordinary profile of their station programming in their entertaining 33 rpm record entitled \"Landay-Nelson Report.\" How we wish other radio stations around the country would follow suit and give us such an excellent telescoped version of the day's programming, so we could determine station personality through listening as well as through the paper offerings, program schedules, personality poop sheets and rating re- ports. Until the day when we have unlimit- ed expense accounts and the time to chase around the country listening to radio for ourselves, this compact, 10- minute air check of a station's round- the-clock programming is a revolution- ary help. — Liz Vosberg, Radio-Tv Dept., Werinen & Schorr Inc., Philadelphia. P.S.: That promotion pitch on the Pulse report was not lost or ignored, either. [WBZ's special air-check promotion record which tied-in with new Pulse report was mailed Aug. 30 to 750 agency timebuyers in New York-Philadelphia. Cost involved? Using its own talent and production facili- ties at no extra expense, WBZ spent $300 for pressing, $150 on postage. Another $2,450 was spent on supporting promotion- al materials to go with the discs, backed by $9,000 in trade advertising. — The Editors.] Movies & news at KHJ-TV editor: The \"great news\" of KHJ- TV Los Angeles' new format as de- scribed in your Sept. 19 issue (page 66) is enough to make one shudder, and pray that the FCC takes immediate note of the programming policy of this station in relation to its \"promises\" in its application for license.

Mrs. Perkins was no doubt not suffi- ciently informed. This rabbit was trained here at Animal Behavior En- terprises' Hot Springs training farm and was sent to the West Coast where Mr. Shaw, who was at that time our West Coast representative, handled the rab- bit under our instructions for the film company who shot the film.

Cleveland A station of the Metropolitan Broadcasting Corporation WHK MONDAY MEMO from GILBERT H. TODD, assistant cashier, Elliott State Bank, Jacksonville, III. Radio: mainstay for Main St.'s banker Radio — that strong, vibrant media that surrounds us every hour of the day and night with its fresh vitality — sounds of news, music and service. But radio is more than a public service. It is an increasingly important factor in bank advertising. Surveys continue to show that banks spend more for radio each year and that radio is second only to newspapers in popularity as a bank advertising me- dium. And people — our customers — are listening to radio more than ever. Banks in some respects have traveled a rocky road in recent years. To enu- merate a few of the problems: savings and loan competition has grown, bank operating costs have skyrocketed, in- terest rates have been difficult to main- tain at competitive levels, and public indifference to thrift and public igno- rance of many bank services have con- tinued. Widespread resentment of the \"impersonal banker\" image still exists. One answer to these problems has been to step up our selling efforts. This means more vigorous and effective ad- vertising. Advertising volume is not enough. To be effective, we need the right kind of advertising. The Reach of Radio ■ Radio reaches almost 100% of the prospective savers and borrowers. It reaches people no matter what they earn, no matter where they live. Radio can pinpoint the male audience we want. Our primary target is men, the principal family wage earner and decision maker in finances. Radio persuades the highly influential female, too, and it can influence the children, our customers of tomorrow. Radio gets to the important suburban family. Suburbanites are in the market for new cars, appliances and furniture, so they're top prospects. Radio forces attention. No other ad nearly competes with our message, so our ad — \"head- lined\" and standing alone — must catch the listener's ear. It's how well we tell our story that counts. Radio furnishes repetition and im- pact to build good saving habits. Thrifti- ness is a habit, not a whim, and few decisions to borrow money are made impulsively. The widespread consumer ignorance of even the most basic finan- cial services mean our advertising must register forcefully and often over a long period of time. With radio we can main- tain the repetitive pressure we need, or we can create pointed advertising im- pact with spot announcements. Friendship and Humor ■ Radio builds its audience on friendship. This friend- ship is loyal because it presents to the local audience the type of programming that fits into the local picture and serves the local interest. The ideal situation is for the program to be presented by an individual who is generally accepted by the bank and listener as a friend of both. In our more than 10 years of success in radio we have learned the great im- portance of humor. If we can make people laugh, smile or feel pleasantly toward us, we have come a long way toward creating a satisfied customer. This is one main objective of our two- year-old, five-minute daily program we sponsor on WLDS Jacksonville called Over the Fields and Furrows. Our farm manager, Ed Garlich, presents the en- tire program, which is directed not only to the farm community but to the urban housewife as well, giving her household hints, etc. He always ends the program with a bit of humor \"From the Corn Crib.\" His picture and the radio column are reprinted in a daily paper here. Recently when an elderly couple opened a $40,000 checking account with us they said, \"We felt we knew Mr. Garlich even before we met him, be- Gilbert H. Todd. b. Jan. 14, 1927, be- gan his banking career with the Elliott State Bank in 1949. He was named as- sistant cashier five years ago. This post also includes responsibility for adver- tising and promotion. He's member of executive committee of Illinois Bank- ers Assn.'s public relations division. cause of the warmth of his voice and his understanding message.\" We believe radio helps to mold an impression of the character and person- ality we want the Elliott State Bank to possess. People would be reluctant to come in our bank if they were afraid or if they felt that they would be un- comfortable or ill at ease. Warmth and Feeling ■ To help re- move the idea of steel bars and cold marble, at the beginning and ending of our seven-minute local news program (thrice weekly, 4:30 p.m., on WLDS), the announcer simply says, \"This pro- gram is brought to you by the people of Elliott State Bank.\" On this program we also have a 60-second spot at or near the beginning of the news and a 30- second spot near the close. Here we do our selling. We have been successful in promoting such new services as thrift checking and revolving credit, initiated at our bank during the past couple of years. Also, we plug auto loans, three per cent savings interest rate (the top limit for commercial banks) and safe deposit boxes. At times when we increase our over- all advertising budget, a proportionate share is spent on a series of spot an- nouncements beamed at both town and country audiences. For example, during peak borrowing periods spots on home improvement loans may be used. This is an excellent method of promoting new services provided by the bank. Spot announcements work well for special activities such as openings, contests, etc. We feel spot commercials should be scheduled at the peak listening pe- riods in early morning, noon and early evening. Coordination ■ Our radio copy is co- ordinated with our newspaper campaign and both are written by our agency, Drohlich & Assoc., St. Louis. We believe radio performs a good job for our advertising dollar. Produc- tion costs for newspapers and television have risen spectacularly in recent years while those for radio remain relatively slight. It's ordinarily much easier and faster to get our advertising on the air in radio than in other media. Radio copy can be scheduled to suit any con- dition and changed if necessary within minutes of air time.

Collins all but set for association presidency NAB has found its president — Gov. LeRoy Collins of Florida — subject to contract formalities and ratification by the NAB board. The search for a nationally prom- inent figure to lead the association was ended last week, barring unexpected de- velopments, when Gov. Collins was picked from a list of two. The other person approached for the top job was Ambassador George V. Allen, director of the U.S. Information Agency. Gov. Collins has the qualifications often laid down within the industry — a strong personality, a distinguished rec- ord and outstanding qualities of leader- ship. These factors led to his choice by the NAB presidential selection com- mittee. A special meeting of the NAB board is to be called for Oct. 10. The meeting will be held in Washington just prior to the Oct. 13 opening of the annual NAB fall conferences in Atlanta. Availability the Key ■ Selection of Gov. Collins by the committee was as- sured when it was learned he would be available after his term as governor of Florida expires next Jan. 3. On the other hand, Ambassador Allen had not stated he would be available. The selection committee, headed by C. Howard Lane, KOIN-TV Portland, Ore., faced another problem in dis- cussing Ambassador Allen — reluctance to make a firm offer to a prominent government official occupying a critical post in a period of international tension. Events moved swiftly in the last fort- night as the selection committee and NAB's policy committee, interim asso- ciation guidance group, concentrated on the two candidates. These events led to a decision: ■ Gov. Collins was interviewed at a Sept. 22 luncheon held at the Statler Hilton in Washington. He made what some committee members called \"a tremendous impression.\" ■ Ambassador Allen was interviewed Sept. 26 at a luncheon held at the Waldorf-Astoria, New York. He, too, was highly regarded by the members. The committee decided, after reviewing both candidates, to make their first formal offer to Gov. Collins. ■ A two-man negotiating committee met Gov. Collins Sept. 28 at the Robert Meyer Hotel, Jacksonville, Fla. The three conferred 2Vi hours, with Gov. Collins agreeing to study documentary material over the weekend and to give the members of the selection committee a definite reply today (Oct. 3). A Long Search ■ Final approval of Gov. Collins for the presidency will provide a successor to the late Harold E. Fellows. First steps to fill the va- cancy left by his death March 8 were Collins in action ■ The man who will probably be the next president of the NAB became a national television personal- ity last July when he served as permanent chairman of the Democratic national convention. Here he responds to a floor demonstration that took place when he took over the gavel July 12 at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. BROADCASTING, October 3, I960 27 taken March 14 when an eight-man se- lection committee was named to pick a successor, subject to NAB board ratifi- cation. Mr. Lane was named chairman of this committee which has kept in close touch with the NAB policy committee headed by Clair R. McCollough, Stein- man stations. The policy group has served as interim directing body of the association. Messrs. Lane and McCol- lough handled the Sept. 28 contact with Gov. Collins. From the start of the Lane com- mittee's search it was obvious that pres- sures from congressional and govern- ment agencies as well as extensive pub- incident to maintenance of a separate Washington residence in addition to his New England home. A third public figure considered by the selection committee was former UN Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge. His name was automatically removed from the list, however, when he was nomi- nated as Republican vice presidential candidate. Out of Politics ■ Gov. Collins had indicated earlier in the summer he was interested in entering private life when his second term as Florida governor ends in January. The selection commit- tee's decision to make him an offer was strongly influenced by his availability Strong prospect ■ George V. Allen, director of the U.S. Information Agen- cy and career diplomat (with full rank as an ambassador), was one of two men considered by the NAB selection committee for the presidency. There was a question about his availability licity dealing with payola and quiz in- vestigations suggested the advisability of selecting someone from public life to cope with attacks on the industry and the overall broadcast image. Gov. Collins, 51, was one of the first names considered when the selection group started meeting last spring. His record in public life had been con- sidered outstanding and his reputation was enhanced by nationwide recogni- tion of his role as permanent chairman of the Democratic convention in Los Angeles. While details of salary, tenure and official association duties haven't been worked out, it appeared at the weekend that salary discussions had approached the $75,000 mark, with the possibility of an escalator provision. Mr. Fellows had reached the $75,000 point in his salary plus about $12,500 for expenses because of his critical position in the government during the present period of intensified cold war. Mr. Allen has been ambassador to Iran, India, Nepal. Yugoslavia and Greece. In the diplo- matic corps since 1930, he has a wide circle of friends in Washington. as well as prominence in public life and administrative ability. The committee was anxious to make a formal announcement of an NAB presidential selection before the Nov. 8 elections. It was felt this would meet any suggestion that the selection had been made on partisan grounds. Gov. Collins was described by one committee member as \"persuasive, articulate, bright and intelligent.\" He was represented as advocating a firm industry stand in the face of current pressures against broadcasting. The job essentially requires, in his mind, pres- ervation and improvement of broadcast- ing's image and stature and the ac- quisition of greater freedom from op- pressive regulation. Allen's Qualifications ■ Consideration of Ambassador Allen by the selection committee had noted his attainment of the highest rank in the diplomatic serv- ice, held by only eight diplomats. Orig- inally from Durham, N.C., he had delivered newspapers in the city, worked in a cigarette factory and served as a bookkeeper while attending Trinity College, now Duke U. After four years of school teaching near Asheville, N.C., he entered the foreign service in 1930. At the age of 42 Mr. Allen was the nation's youngest ambassador while serving in Iran. He has served since as Ambassador to India and Nepal, Yugo- slavia and Greece. His record of par- tication in international conferences is impressive and he served as assistant secretary of State for public affairs. Ambassador Allen served with the Voice of America, which later became the independent U.S. Information Agen- cy. Last year he was coordinator of the American National Exhibition in Moscow. Terse Report ■ NAB remained of- ficially silent about the presidential ne- gotiations until Sept. 29 when it an- nounced the selection committee \"had completed tentative arrangements\" for a successor to Mr. Fellows. The an- nouncement continued, \"The commit- tee said it would not disclose the iden- tity of the person selected until after a contract is negotiated and until after the association's board of directors is called into a special meeting to pass on the nomination and the contract. The committee said it would have no further statement or announcement un- til these two steps have been taken.\" News services carried speculative stories last week about the selection of Gov. Collins for what was inaccurately termed \"the $100,000 a year post.\" Others who have held the NAB presi- dency since its 1938 reorganization when it was changed from an honorary to a paid position, besides Mr. Fellows, have been Neville t Miller, communica- tions attorney and former mayor of Louisville, and Judge Justin Miller. Members of NAB's selection com- mittee, besides Chairman Lane, are Thomas W. Bostic, KIMA-AM-TV Yakima, Wash.; John E. Fetzer, Fetzer stations; John S. Hayes, Washington Post stations; Dwight W. Martin, WAFB-TV Baton Rouse. La.; William D. Pabst, KTVU (TV) Oakland. Calif., W.D. Rogers, KDUB-TV Lubbock, Tex., and Payson Hall, Meredith sta- tions. The policy committee includes Chair- man McCollough, G. Richard Shafto, WIS-AM-TV Columbia, S.C., and Mer- rill Lindsay, WSOY Decatur, 111. Man of Experience ■ The new NAB president-select is a man of worldwide as well as national fame. Gov. LeRoy Collins, of Florida, knows the problems of Florida, the United States, Russia and broadcasting 28 (LEAD STORY) BROADCASTING, October 3, 1960 too — all from first-hand observation. The first Florida governor ever elected for consecutive terms, he has achieved recognition for aggressive at- tacks on basic state problems, including the touchy racial issue. But to many Americans, he became a national figure in his role as permanent chairman of the Democratic national convention in Los Angeles last July. There he became the first governor of either party since 1892 to serve as permanent chairman of a national political convention. In the difficult role at Los Angeles he patiently let the demonstrators howl and shriek, finally starting persistent gavel pounding that brought order to the proceedings. A friendly, family man (see photo, at right), he often lets a cajoling twinkle or a friendly pat on the shoulder serve as controlling devices. He's an inveterate friend-maker and has a knack of making people feel at ease. The natural congeniality that led him to political heights will be trans- ferred to the colonial town house at 1771 N St. in Northwest Washington, where NAB is headquartered, and it will soon be a familiar feature at in- dustry meetings. \"Painfully honest,\" as a friend once described him, Gov. Collins has de- manded and obtained above-average contributions from his subordinates. \"They trust him; his friends trust him; so do many of his political antagonists,\" another acquaintance said. He was described as a sincere church-going man (Episcopalian) and abstainer. His social reforms in Florida have been di- rected toward improvements in penal systems, schooling (and this includes summer school programs to keep youngsters busy), divorce laws and civil service laws. Traveling Salesman ■ As a promoter, he has made several tours around the country to build his state's prestige and bring recognition to its tripartite econ- omy based on industry, agriculture and tourism. These tours have brought in many numerous industries and have given him a reputation as a \"super- salesman.\" The son of a Methodist circuit-rid- ing preacher, LeRoy Collins grew up around Tallahassee, the state capital. He worked at odd jobs to get his edu- cation and financed a law course at Cumberland U. in Tennessee by work- ing in a bank. He passed the Florida state bar with one of the highest grades ever scored and hung up a shingle in Tallahassee. Law earnings were slim for a while, but when he ran for office as county prosecutor, he decided the pay was enough to finance a home so he married his longtime sweetheart, Mary Call. He won a wife but lost the election. They New first family ■ These are the members of the family of Gov. LeRoy Collins of Florida who is expected to become NAB president next January. Seated (on floor, 1-r) : Jane, 22, Darby, 10, and Mary Call, 18; (on chairs) Gov. and Mrs. Collins; standing: Mr. managed to keep the home going until he won a legislative seat in his second campaign. This put him into politics for 2V2 decades. His first election as governor came in 1954 when he served two years of the unexpired term of Gov. Dan Mc- Carty, a friend who died in office. He has an ideal temperament for a poli- tician— and for a trade association executive Usually, he walks to work in the mornings from the executive mansion, waving and shaking hands all along the way.

Those who know him figure he'll be on a first-name basis with hundreds of broadcasters by the time the 1961 NAB convention is over; thousands after a year at NAB and after the 1961 fall conference circuit. And they're certain the new presi- dent will be on familiar terms with all the regulatory and legislative issues that move over the presidential desk. BROADCASTING, October 3, 1960 29 BROADCAST ADVERTISING COLD BRANDS INCREASE SPENDING Seasonal buying nears completion as competition becomes keen Representing a $30 million product category in tv advertising alone, cold remedy advertisers this week are lined up with one eye on the weather and the other on competitors for the cold- sufferer's relief-money. As the seasonal network and spot buying nears comple- tion, two things are clear: radio-tv budgets are up and competition is keener than ever. Agency walls are impenetrable around the ad plans of many cold remedy products. But it doesn't appear likely there will be any shift in the spending order of last year's top five cold relief products. Together they ac- counted for 75% of the tv advertising in this category, according to Television Bureau of Advertising. Based on TvB gross figures, Dristan, Anahist products, Vick remedies, Grove's 4-Way Cold remedies and Coldene products spent a combined total of $22,067,868 in net- work and spot tv. For all products in this category, 1959 expenditures in network tv totaled $12,415,168. In spot tv the total figure was $16,655,000, making a combined network-spot total of $29,070,168. Radio figures are not available. TvB figures also show that spending in the first six months of 1960 is about even with the first half of 1959. It appears Star support ■ In rehearsal of new tv spot commercials for Grove's 4-Way preparations is singer-actress Gisele MacKenzie, flanked by Francis X.

Aid and Comfort ■ Relief from cold discomfort may take the form of cough drops, syrups, sprays, tablets, or what- ever.

TOP 10 FEVER IN TV SUBSIDING That's opinion of agency-advertiser panel; radio ratings hit Six experienced broadcast customers sat down several weeks back to talk about \"rating services and use of rat- ings.\" By the time they stood up they'd voiced a number of opinions on the whole area of media selection, among them: ■ The \"Top 10\" fever is dying out in television, as the choice between most buys becomes a tossup. ■ Radio is being shortchanged by the rating services and the radio rating services are going through dark days. h There ought to be a single, all- industry-supported system of ratings, especially for radio, but the difficulties of getting one are formidable. These opinions came from the par- ticipants in NBC Spot Sales' second \"media managers conference\" (The first, on public service programming, was reported in Broadcasting, June 13). The recorded session, whose 93- page transcript is being made public today (Oct. 3), included some of the top names in agency-advertiser circles (see picture). Marvin Richfield, media director, Erwin, Wasey, Ruthrauff & Ryan, seemed to express the consensus when he stated \"Your top 10 in tv is not as important as it was. It is no longer pos- sible to achieve a rating that is far better than someone else's ratings. Things have leveled out. Your average network show gets about a 22.

Looking on are Paul Reid, GAB award chairman, and Elmo Ellis, WSB-Radio program director. Following a tradition of 38 years of broadcasting in the public interest, WSB-Radio joined other broadcasters during the July 4 holidays to wage an unprecedented safety campaign to save lives on the highways. The station utilized a three-pronged approach, featuring 1100 announcements, during a three-day period, with teports from the station helicopter, the mobile news units, and prominent state and city officials. This promotion was judged best by the Georgia Association of Broadcasters among stations serving a market of more than 75,000 population. It is this type of programming in the public interest that has served to make WSB-Radio synonymous with public service in the minds of listeners, and has won for the station a tremendous audience loyalty.

Then you might as well increase your reach by being on two totally different vehicles. It is no longer important enough to gamble a lot of money on a blockbuster hour.\" Desensitized ■ William E. (Pete) Mat- thews, vice president and director of media relations, Young & Rubicam, contributed another reason for the de- cline in importance of the top 10, which actually amounts to looking at the same reason from the other side. That is, with the decline in exclusive sponsor- ships the advertiser is no longer as sensitive about his show being on a top 10 chart. This situation, while making it harder to go wrong, also makes it harder to go right, one participant in- ferred. Richard S. Paige, media manager for the Household Products Div., Colgate- Palmolive Co., noted, \"In the old days, if I had a choice between a program with 10 million homes and a program with 5 million, I had a very simple choice to make. Nowadays, when the averages are all closer to 8 million, I must look for other differences.\" Roger Bumstead, media director of the eastern division of MacManus, lohn & Adams, cited one tv advantage: \"The nature of television programming alone provides all sorts of criteria to aid the decision-making process. Its very nature makes it far more definitive than radio is at present. I think there's more of a need — in radio's best interest — for it to develop new types of meas- urements.\" Cumulative Ratings ■ One of the radio measurements Mr. Bumstead ad- vocated is that of providing cumulative ratings, which he finds on the increase. The reason, he says, is that a cume deals more in a specific — that is, the household net coverage of an actual schedule rather than set counts which represent only the potential audience, or ratings which are mainly a yard- stick of cost efficiency. It's a way of getting closer to marketing objectives, and when combined with sound busi- ness judgments, a means of making a sound media buy. I think it's to a sta- tion's advantage, and the broadcast industry's, to provide more of this sort of information.

AM 1100 FM 96 3 Represented by Gill-Perna based on this research.\" Humboldt J. Greig, vice president and manager of station relations, C. J. LaRoche & Co., made one observation about radio ratings with which few broadcasters would disagree: \"Current surveys may sell the radio industry very, very short. I would like to have rating services available that would help us justify appropriations at the plans board level. Instead of this, we're get- ting rating services strictly as a com- petitive tool — one station against the other. \"If you examine radio listening pat- terns, you find that the average station has 40% unduplicated reach weekly. Then you look at other media such as television and are forced to conclude that it is necessary to use two or three radio stations in a market to get the reach one tv station can develop. Ac- tually, the 40% reach could grow to 60 or 70% if all the places where radio is listened to were measured. Adver- tisers do not want to know they will miss 60% of the homes in a market if they use only one radio station. They must know how many stations are re- quired to reach 90% of a market. Then it is possible to make a comparison of costs, which could result in a budget for radio.\" New System Wanted ■ All the agen- cy-advertiser participants agreed that an all-industry effort was desirable to construct a new radio rating system that would replace the individual services now used, but there was no agreement that such a service would evolve. One of the problems was stated by Mr. Paige, who said, \"The real problem is a workable, agreed-upon definition of audience. Any research service could go right out and construct and measure that audience. It's not that there are different rating services, and not that there are differences between them, but that there is no working definition of the term 'audience'.\" Another problem is who would sup- port such a service, although a least one of the participants thought the bur- den was on the agency or the advertiser. According to Mr. Bumstead, \"In order for us to take charge of directing how the rating services run, we — that is, the advertisers and the agencies — have got to pay the lion's share of the cost of these services rather than as at pres- ent where media, usually, pays the largest proportion of the expense — and sometimes influences the result. It is our responsibility to our"
