        "text": "Physical Development: Arguing the Case It is widely accepted that regular participation in physical activity is related to short and long-term physical, emotional, cognitive and social health benefits for both children and adolescents (Sallis et al, 2000; Yang et al, 2006). A range of enjoyable, rich and progressive physical activities designed to facilitate the development of fine and gross motor skills should therefore be provided throughout the early years phase of education. Indeed, positive, physical experiences in children’s formative years can help ease their passage to the more specialised secondary physical education context and encourage lifelong participation in physical activity, since there is some evidence to suggest that active children are more likely to become active adults (Boreham and Riddoch, 2001). The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS, 2008) confirms the link between physical development and health, suggesting that: “Good health in the early years helps to safeguard health and well-being throughout life. It is important that children develop healthy habits when they first learn about food and activity” (2008: 4.4). It could thus be argued that the early years are an optimal time to embed movement and physical activity across the school day, particularly for the contribution they can make to the health and wellbeing of society’s youngest members. Accordingly, cross-curricular, thematic approaches that explicitly foster relationships between the six EYFS areas of Learning and Development could simultaneously address children’s needs for “60 active minutes” per day (NHS, 2010). The Western Australian programme ‘Fundamental Movement Skills’ (Hands et al., 2004a and 2004b) supports such holistic principles, guiding teachers to underpin existing curriculum content with highly focused physical activities that nurture proficiency in the foundations of movement.\n\nABSTRACT As a way to address the serious obesity epidemic in the United States, many physical education classes have become fitness centers designed to raise heart rates and burn calories. An unintended consequence of this emphasis on fitness, however, is the lack of attention to motor skill development. Motor skills do not develop miraculously from one day to the next or through maturation; they must be nurtured, promoted, and practiced. Physical education must promote both physical activity and motor skill development. If we want students to become physically active for life, we need to help them acquire the motor skills that will allow them to participate in a wide range of physical activities.\n\nIntroduction and objective: This study investigated the contribution of physical education (PE) classes in elementary school I for the development of basic motor skills of children from two public schools in the same neighborhood of São Paulo city, and if the practice of extreme sports besides the PE classes could differently contribute to the development of those skills. Methods: Nineteen children (9.5 ± 0.3 years) who had two weekly PE classes composed the control group (CG) and 22 children (9.6 ± 0.5 years) who had two weekly PE classes and three extreme sports classes composed the experimental group (EG). All children were videotaped while performing locomotor and object control motor skill subtests from the Test of Gross Motor Development (TGMD-2). The videos were analyzed and raw scores were obtained according to the quality of the observed movement, and equivalent motor age was also estimated for both subtests. Results: The results indicated that the EG presented higher raw s..."
