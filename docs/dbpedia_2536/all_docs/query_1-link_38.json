        "text": "Today is a reflective day for us at SBH Scotland as our CEO of 34 years, Andy Wynd MBE MIoD retires. Anyone who knows Andy will know that he has dedicated his life to the charity. He has led the organisation through periods of transition and significant expansion which has culminated in a range of innovative developments and person centred projects from telehealth to Healthy Living, Inclusive Fitness and Play Projects; all of which contribute to ensuring that families affected by spina bifida or hydrocephalus have a wide range of choices and support networks to enable them to live lives to the full. In 2014 his dedication to healthcare did not go unnoticed and he was awarded an MBE. We wish Andy a relaxing time in retirement although Andy is not one for 'standing still' so we'll no doubt be hearing about new challenges he's taken on soon. At last months AGM, our chairperson, Dr Margo Whiteford asked Andy to say a few words. Here's a snippet of his response. Andy said, \"I have been incredibly fortunate to be part of an organisation who were prepared to tolerate my insatiable appetite for never standing still, always looking at ways to improve, and fine tuning the services we offer to support families and individuals whose lives have been transformed from birth. It is true that we have had many laughs together around the shared joy which our families experienced of major achievements and children being children. We have often cried together, as we felt the pain of loss and bereavement and the tragedy over other events which blight our community, with apparent increasing frequency it seems, in the world in which we now live. However, the organisation and its people are a resilient bunch, and I have every confidence that the traumas of the past will stand you all in good stead for the future, whatever it may bring. I wish Lawrence, and your new team, my very best wishes for the future and to all of you, embrace change, look forward positively, and never lose sight of the reason for our being in this place. Remember the legacies of the past and use them to drive the vision for the future of this great organisation.\" To hear more from Andy's speech at the AGM head over to our latest blog at https://lnkd.in/egxPgSnR\n\nOur Planning and Scheduling Optimization #PSO solution continues to revolutionize mobile, remote and back office workforce management in a way never seen before! We have roughly 8 billion people in the world, about 3.3 billion employed, about 65% of global GDP is in services, another 16% in manufacturing, 6% in telco. You do the math, but it is easy to see the potential both now and over the next 20 years. ‚ÄùSmart companies recognize their employees as their greatest advantage‚Äù. That applies not only to our customers and prospects looking to realize the value of PSO or buy it for the first time. But it also refers to our people! üíú This week, we have had a collaborative and transformative week of knowledge sharing, thought leadership, training, and product roadmap shaping for our PSO solution with our global experts. I had the privilege of joining the team for the start of the week, and we are all inspired to continue accelerating how we offset labor scarcity in developed countries, help developing countries grow faster, and drive customer experience and business results for all. üèÜ"
