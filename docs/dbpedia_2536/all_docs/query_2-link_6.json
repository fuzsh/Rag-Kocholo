The selected historical consolidated financial information as of December 31, 2012 and 2013 and for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 have been derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the consolidated financial statements of ClickSoftware Technologies Ltd. and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The selected financial data as of December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and for each of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010 have been derived from the audited financial statements of ClickSoftware Technologies Ltd. not included in this annual report.\n\nThe information presented below is qualified by the more detailed historical consolidated financial statements set forth in this annual report, and should be read in conjunction with those consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and the discussion under Item 5 – \"Operating and Financial Review and Prospects\" - included elsewhere in this annual report.\n\nConsolidated Statement of Operations Data – Year Ended December 31\n\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data)\n\n2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $103,181 $100,046 $87,087 $71,019 $61,123 Cost of revenues 44,307 38,871 31,696 26,913 20,831 Gross profit 58,874 61,175 55,391 44,106 40,292 Research and Development, net 15,970 13,146 9,019 7,920 6,499 Selling and Marketing 39,706 31,977 23,382 19,213 16,240 General and Administrative 9,121 8,779 7,386 6,747 6,423 Impairment of goodwill - - 939 - - Total operating expenses 64,797 53,902 40,726 33,880 29,162 Operating (loss) income (5,923) 7,273 14,665 10,226 11,130 Other income - 110 - - - Financial income, net 839 274 7 189 380 Net (loss) income before taxes (5,084) 7,657 14,672 10,415 11,510 Taxes on income (Tax benefit) (924) 169 2,462 1,370 (1,004) Net (loss) income $(4,160) $7,488 $12,210 $9,045 $12,514 Basic net (loss) earnings per share $(0.13) $0.24 $0.39 $0.30 $0.43 Diluted net (loss) earnings per share $(0.13) $0.23 $0.38 $0.28 $0.40 Dividend declared per share $0.21 $0.24 $0.32 - - Shares used in computing basic net (loss) earnings per share 32,048,030 31,545,435 31,014,373 30,415,679 29,400,973 Shares used in computing diluted net (loss) earnings per share 32,048,030 32,837,789 32,226,883 32,037,399 31,137,238\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheet Data – Year Ended December 31\n\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share data)\n\n2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 Working capital $54,444 $58,565 $54,726 $48,710 $37,666 Total assets 97,568 94,469 90,632 79,827 66,449 Long-term liabilities 9,522 5,968 5,855 5,208 5,461 Shareholders' equity $56,919 $62,918 $59,104 $54,088 $42,658 Number of shares outstanding 32,494,575 31,654,942 31,368,888 30,634,227 30,244,330\n\n3.B.Capitalization and indebtedness\n\nNot applicable.\n\n3.C.Reasons for the offer and use of proceeds\n\nNot applicable.\n\n3.D.Risk factors\n\nIn conducting our business, we face many risks that may interfere with our business objectives. Some of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic, political, industry, business and financial conditions. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.\n\nYou should carefully consider the following factors and other information in this annual report before you decide to invest in our Ordinary Shares. If any of the negative events referred to below occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. In any such case, the trading price of our Ordinary Shares could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\nWe face competition, which could make it difficult for us to achieve our targets.\n\nCompetition, particularly direct competition, continues to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings and new companies attempt to enter the market. In addition, smaller competitors have been acquired by large organizations with broader product offerings, or been awarded venture funding, promoting competition on price and away from value. The industries where we are active have witnessed a substantial amount of merger and acquisition activity over the past few years and this trend of industry consolidation will likely continue, particularly as larger, better capitalized companies seek to acquire smaller, weaker rivals that have been adversely affected by the economic downturn.\n\nCompetitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer. Some of our current and potential competitors are among the largest and most well capitalized software companies in the world and have significant competitive advantages over us, including greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, public relations, sales, distribution and other resources than us. Because the market for workforce management and optimization software is evolving, we expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies if this market continues to develop and expand. For example, we could face competition from our strategic partners or from other companies that may in future decide to enter and compete in our market. In particular, since our contracts with large resellers generally do not include non-competition provisions, it may be easier for these partners to compete with us in the future. SAP A.G. acquired Syclo in 2012, one of our competitors in the mobility space. SAP has its own offering which competes with our ClickSchedule product. Another of our partners, IBM, recently acquired Worklight Ltd., a potential mobility competitor. We may also face competition from Accenture LLP.\n\nWe offer mobility and shift-planning solutions for which competition may be more intense than our traditional offerings. Mobility is oriented more towards the mass market which is more commodity oriented than our traditional markets. Competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margin and loss of market share, any of which could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer. We may not be able to compete successfully with existing or future competitors. If we fail to compete successfully against current and future competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\n\nAt the lower end of our potential customer base for field service management, there are a large number of vendors offering basic services such as dispatching tasks and gathering task execution data via mobile forms. Some customers may find such solutions appealing. Therefore, if we are unable to educate the market about the higher value of our solutions, or if we cannot deliver simple-to-implement solutions that address such basic needs, we may be at a disadvantage when selling to these customers.\n\nOur market may experience rapid changes in customer preferences or technology that could impact our revenues or require us to redesign our products, which would result in increased research and development expenses.\n\nThe market for our products is competitive and rapidly changing. We have detected a pattern in the IT market towards smaller initial transactions relative to the approach we saw in prior years. This has led to a smaller initial transaction size with new customers, and will require us to scale up the number of our transactions in order to maintain our growth.\n\nThe pattern of smaller initial deal size coincides with the expected shift from traditional on-premises deployment of our products to the cloud-based software-as-a-service, or SaaS, model. This shift has occurred faster than we expected. Although this shift has long-term benefits in the form of a more stable future revenue stream for us, the tendency of customers to shift to the SaaS model in order to lower up-front investment does impact the Company’s short term growth rate. SaaS, combined with general macro-economic concerns, has moderated buyers’ tolerance for risk versus price, thereby encouraging a smaller initial deployment size than we have seen in the past.\n\nFurther, as customers become more acquainted with cloud-based SaaS, there is a greater expectation for low initial financial investment. In order to remain competitive and satisfy low initial customer outlay, it may require us to propose a low-cost implementation which could impact our consulting revenues.\n\nOur market is also characterized by rapid technological change, dynamic customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and product enhancements. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to technology developments and customer requirements, or if our product development or introduction is delayed, our business will suffer. Client product requirements can change rapidly as a result of computer hardware and software innovations or changes in and the emergence, evolution and adoption of new industry standards. The actual or anticipated introduction of new products has resulted, and will continue to result, in some reformulation of our product offerings. Technology and industry standards can make existing products obsolete or unmarketable or result in delays in the purchase of such products. In the mobility sector, technological changes with regard to platforms and operating systems with which we integrate are typically rapid. As a result, the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate. We must respond to developments rapidly and continue to make substantial product development investments. We have previously experienced delays in introducing new products and features, and we may experience delays in the future that could impair our revenue and operating results. Our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected if we fail to respond to our rapidly changing market by enhancing our product functionality to meet our customers' needs.\n\nThe market may not accept our products and services.\n\nHistorically, all of our operating revenue has come from sales of, and services related to, our end-to-end optimization suite of products, or our Service Optimization Suite, which includes ClickSchedule, ClickAnalyze, ClickPlan, ClickMobile, ClickRoster, ClickForecast, ClickLocate and ClickContact. Our packaging includes three distinct entry points for a customer organization that has medium-to-large size or requirement complexity: a Field Service Suite, a Mobility Suite and a Roster Suite. We also offer our Service Optimization Suite and Mobility Suite under a cloud-based model. For customers with smaller sizes and requirement complexity, we offer our ClickExpress solution under a cloud-based model. We continually aim to improve and enhance our products and services to meet market requirements. Our growth depends on the market acceptance of these products and services, and in particular the pace at which the market adopts our cloud-based offerings. If our products and services do not achieve continued customer acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\n\nFailure to fully develop or maintain key alliance relationships could limit our ability to sell additional licenses, thereby decreasing our revenues and increasing our sales and marketing expenses.\n\nOur success in penetrating our target markets depends, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain relationships with key value-added resellers, agents, systems integrators and distribution partners. We have entered into agreements with third parties relating to the integration of our products with their product offerings, and distribution, reselling and consulting services. We derive revenues from these agreements, but may not be able to continue to do so in the future. Also, our marketing strategy includes selling through distributors, value-added resellers and agents, as well as direct selling by our own sales force. We may not be successful in extending the terms of our various agreements or establishing similar relationships with these partners if our current agreements expire or are terminated. If we fail to fully develop or maintain key alliance relationships, we could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nOur quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuations.\n\nOur quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and are difficult to predict. Historically, a significant percentage of our quarterly revenues has been derived from orders placed towards the end of a given quarter. If sales forecasted from a specific customer or partner for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter, we may not be able to generate revenues from alternate sources in time to compensate for the shortfall. Also, frequently our quarterly revenue performance depends upon a sale of significant size to a single customer. Due to the relatively large size of some orders, a lost or delayed sale could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly revenue.\n\nThe factors that may cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n·the volume, timing and recognition of customer orders;\n\n·internal budget constraints and approval processes of our customers;\n\n·the length and unpredictability of our sales cycle;\n\n·the recognition of a portion of our revenues on a contract accounting basis;\n\n·the recent pattern of smaller initial deal size coinciding with a shift from traditional on-premises deployment of our products to the cloud-based SaaS model;\n\n·the indirect nature of some of our sales efforts through our channel and strategic partners;\n\n·the mix of revenue generated by product licenses and professional services;\n\n·new product introductions or enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\n·price and product competition;\n\n·changes to our pricing strategies and those of our competitors;\n\n·inclusion of revenues following existing and future acquisitions of third parties;\n\n·timing and amount of sales and marketing expenses;\n\n·changes in the composition and success of our business and partner relationships;\n\n·technical difficulties affecting the operation of our software;\n\n·foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\n·general economic conditions, including a prolonged economic recession; and\n\n·difficulties in collecting accounts receivable.\n\nBecause of the numerous factors that may cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\n\nWe may not be able to achieve and maintain the same level of profitability as we achieved in the past.\n\nWe recorded a profit for each of the fiscal years 2006 through 2012, and incurred a net loss in 2013. We may not generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability in the future. To achieve profitability, we must increase our revenues while controlling our expenses. Although we implemented cost reduction measures for 2014, some of our expenses, such as administrative and management payroll and rent and utilities, are fixed in the short term, must be incurred in advance of when revenue is generated and cannot be quickly reduced if we experience revenue declines. Therefore, if our projected revenue does not meet our expectations, we are likely to experience an even larger adverse impact on our results. As a result, we must generate and maintain growing revenues to achieve and maintain profitability, which we may not accomplish.\n\nOur sales cycle is variable, often long, dependent on factors outside our control and involves investment of significant resources on our part, but may never result in actual sales.\n\nThe length of our sales cycle – the period between initial contact with a potential customer and the signing of a license and related agreements - has historically been lengthy and variable, typically lasting from three to nine months. We generally must educate our potential customers about the use and benefit of our products and services, which can require the investment of significant time and resources, causing us to incur most of our selling and marketing expenses in advance of a potential sale. In addition, a number of companies decide which products to buy through a request for proposal process. In those situations, we run the risk of investing significant resources in a proposal that results in a competitor obtaining the desired contract from the customer or in a decision by a customer not to proceed. Sales of licenses are subject to a number of risks outside our control, including budgeting, approval and competitive evaluation processes that typically accompany significant capital expenditures. Potential customers consider many factors in evaluating our products, and the length of time a customer devotes to evaluation, contract negotiation and budgeting processes varies significantly from company to company. In certain circumstances, we may invest significant resources in a sales process that does not result in actual sales.\n\nOur implementation cycle depends on factors outside our control.\n\nDepending on the nature and specific needs of a customer, the implementation of our products typically takes six to twelve months. During the implementation cycle, there are a number of factors beyond our control that may affect the implementation timeline, including a customer's budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews, the success and continued internal support of a customer's own development efforts, the nature, size and specific needs of a customer, the possibility that a customer cancels an order and the level and quality of service provided by third-party implementation and professional services partners. Long implementation cycles may delay the recognition of revenue as some of our customers engage us to perform system implementation services, which can defer revenue recognition for the related software license revenue. In addition, when we experience long implementation cycles, we may incur costs at a higher level than anticipated, which may reduce the anticipated profitability of a given implementation. We continue in our efforts to simplify the implementation process. However, because our implementation cycle depends on factors outside of our control, we may experience delays or other complications with our implementation timeline that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAny future mergers with or acquisitions of companies, products or technologies and the resultant integration process may distract our management and disrupt our business.\n\nOne of our business strategies is to consider strategic partnerships, alliances, mergers and/or acquisitions of complementary businesses, products and technologies. Mergers with or acquisitions of companies, products or technologies, such as our recent acquisition of Xora, Inc. (Xora) as described elsewhere in this annual report, involve a number of risks, including:\n\n·the diversion of management time and resources;\n\n·the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the merged or acquired companies;\n\n·the possibility the business cultures will not be compatible;\n\n·the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and services;\n\n·unanticipated expenses related to integration of the acquired companies;\n\n·difficulties in implementing and maintaining uniform standards, controls and policies;\n\n·the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new personnel;\n\n·potential inability to retain, integrate and motivate key management, marketing, technical sales and customer support personnel;\n\n·potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses;\n\n·expending significant cash;\n\n·incurring substantial debt;\n\n·dilution of current shareholders' percentage ownership (if equity securities are issued as consideration);\n\n·assumption of contingent liabilities; and\n\n·impairment of goodwill and other assets acquired.\n\nPursuant to our business strategy, we will continue to consider additional merger or acquisition transactions.\n\nAny future merger and acquisition activity could distract our management and disrupt our business, thereby materially and adversely affecting our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nIf we fail to expand our relationships with third parties that provide implementation and professional services to our customers, we may be unable to increase our revenues.\n\nIn order for us to focus more effectively on our core business of developing and licensing software solutions, we must continue to establish relationships with third parties that provide implementation and professional services to our customers. Third-party implementation and professional services firms can be influential in the choice of optimization applications by new customers. These third parties are under no obligation to recommend or support our products; they could recommend or give higher priority to the products of other companies or to their own products. If we are unable to establish and maintain effective, long-term relationships with implementation and professional services providers, or if these providers do not meet the needs or expectations of our customers, we may be unable to increase our revenues, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nEven if we establish relationships with these third party implementation and professional services firms, we may be unable to attract sufficient focus and resources from them to meet all of our customers' needs as a result of the limited resources and capacities of many third-party providers. If sufficient resources are unavailable, we could be required to provide these services internally, which could limit our ability to meet other demands. We cannot control the level and quality of service provided by these partners.\n\nOur revenues still depend on a small number of products, and in particular ClickSchedule, and our results may be vulnerable to unexpected shifts in demand.\n\nWhile other offerings gained momentum (both in absolute terms and relative to overall revenue) ClickSchedule still accounted for the majority of our license revenues in each of years ended December 31 2013, 2012 and 2011 and we expect that this will be the case in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, any decline in the demand for ClickSchedule will have a material adverse effect on our license revenues. A decline in the demand for ClickSchedule may also reduce revenues derived from our other products.\n\nFailure to fully develop or maintain key supplier relationships could limit our ability to sell additional licenses, thereby decreasing our revenues and increasing our sales and marketing expenses.\n\nOur success in penetrating our target markets depends, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain key relationships with software vendors. For example, we depend on certain suppliers for the development, supply and support of third-party software components that are integrated into our products. We do not have long-term contracts with some of these suppliers, and they are not obligated to provide us with products or services for any specified period of time. If we fail to maintain these relationships, our ability to sell additional licenses could be limited. Furthermore, if any of our software vendors cease production, cease operations or fail to timely deliver orders, we could be required to provide these services internally, which could limit our ability to meet other demands and we may not be able to meet our delivery obligations to our customers, in which case we could lose revenues and harm our customer relationships. If we fail to fully develop or maintain key supplier relationships, we could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nOur risk from exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is increasing, and we may not be able to fully mitigate the risk.\n\nWe are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates since we realize our revenues and expenses in several currencies and we translate foreign currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Our primary exposures have related to operating expenses and sales, principally in Europe and Israel, which were not U.S. dollar-denominated. In 2013, the rate of growth of our costs increased in part due to exchange rate fluctuations and weakness in the U.S. dollar compared to NIS that significantly increased the cost of our Israel-based operations. We continue to expand our global operations, and revenue recognized in currencies other than U.S. dollars may increase. In 2013, 65% of our expenses and 49% of our revenues were incurred in non-U.S. dollar currencies. We incur a portion of our expenses, principally with respect to salaries and related personnel expenses in Israel, in NIS. In 2013, 46% of our expenses were incurred in NIS. Currency fluctuations in the major currencies in which we operate could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we have balance sheet exposure related to foreign net assets. Although we engage in non-speculative hedging transactions from time to time to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings, we may not be able to fully mitigate these risks.\n\nOur cash may be subject to a risk of loss and we may be exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates.\n\nOur assets include a significant component of cash, as well as marketable securities. We adhere to an investment policy which requires investment in high-quality investment-grade securities provided, however, that up to $10 million of our total cash and investments may be invested in equity of companies that have a policy to regularly distribute dividends or in Exchange Traded Funds, or ETFs, of a similar nature. We believe that our cash is held in institutions whose credit risk is minimal and that the value and liquidity of our marketable securities are accurately reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2013. However, nearly all of our cash and marketable securities are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the FDIC, or similar governmental deposit insurance outside the United States. Therefore, our cash and any marketable securities that we now hold or may acquire in the future may be subject to risks, including the risk of loss or of reduced value or liquidity, particularly in light of the recent volatility and worldwide pressures in the financial and banking sectors. In the future, should we determine that there is a decline in value of any of our portfolio securities which is not temporary in nature, this would result in a loss being recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nWe depend on key personnel, and the loss of any key personnel could affect our ability to compete and impair our ability to attract additional key personnel.\n\nOur future success depends on the continued service of our executive officers, including Moshe BenBassat, Shmuel Arvatz, Zvi Piritz and Stephen Timms, and other key sales and marketing, product development and professional services personnel. Competition for these employees can be intense, including in a number of our key markets and locations, such as Israel, India, the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. More generally, we may be unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of highly qualified professional services personnel to meet our business needs.\n\nCustomers that license our software typically engage our professional services organization to assist with the installation and operation of our software applications. Our professional services organization also typically assists with the installation and implementation of our customers' software systems. Future growth in licenses of our software will depend, in part, on our ability to continue providing customers with these services. To the extent that we receive several large orders simultaneously or in close proximity to one another, we could place added strain on our existing personnel. The market for the qualified personnel we require is very competitive because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical and sales skills and understanding of our products and technology. If we are unable to maintain and expand our professional services organization, our ability to support our service business would be limited.\n\nThe services of our key personnel would be difficult to replace and the loss of any of these employees could harm our business significantly. Although we have employment or consulting agreements with our executive officers that generally require 60 to 90 days notification prior to departure, our relationships with these officers and key employees are at will and can be terminated by either party without cause. The loss of any of our key personnel could harm our ability to execute our business strategy and remain competitive.\n\nGlobal economic conditions may adversely affect our business.\n\nOur operations and performance depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending, which have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. This may adversely affect the budgeting and purchasing behavior of our customers and our partners' customers, which could adversely affect our product sales.\n\nContinuing uncertainties in the macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers, suppliers and channel partners (e.g., distributors and resellers) to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and to perform their contractual obligations with us. While in 2013 there was a slow recovery in the global economy, in 2011 and 2012 we encountered a slowdown in the EMEA region. As a result, we could encounter, among other adverse effects, a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services, and an increase in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable being required.\n\nIf our relationships with our key customers are terminated, our revenues will decline and our business will be adversely affected.\n\nDuring 2013, our five largest customers together accounted for approximately 26% of our revenues. If for any reason, our relationship with a key customer is terminated, or if any of our key customers reduces purchases of our products, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The impact of the termination or reduction in demand of a key customer would be intensified if we were unable to increase sales to other customers to offset this termination or reduction in demand. We expect that a significant portion of our future revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers.\n\nOur products could be susceptible to errors or defects or contain inaccurate data from third-party vendors.\n\nComplex software products, such as ours, often contain errors or defects, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. In the past, some of our products have contained errors and defects that have delayed implementation or required us to expend additional resources to correct the problems. Testing of our products is particularly challenging because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of customer environments into which our products are deployed. Despite internal testing, testing by current and potential customers and the history of use by our installed base of customers, our current and future products may contain defects or errors. We also commit to service level agreements in connection with our cloud-based offerings, and any excessive downtime may harm the perception of our offerings by our customers. With regard to our entire suite of products and services, defects or errors could result in adverse customer reaction and publicity, damage to our reputation, diversion of resources, increased service and maintenance costs, loss of market demand, loss of market share, loss of potential new customers, lost revenues, liability or a delay in market acceptance of these products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe host our cloud-based offerings on Amazon Web Services, or AWS, and are dependent on the continued reliability of AWS. The performance of our products also depends, in part, upon the accuracy and continued availability of third-party data. We rely on third parties that provide information such as street and address locations and mapping functions that we incorporate into our products. If these parties do not provide accurate information, or if we are unable to maintain our relationships with them, our reputation and competitive position could suffer and we could be unable to develop or enhance our products as required.\n\nSecurity breaches could disrupt our information technology systems or expose us to liability and our reputation and business could suffer.\n\nA breach of our information technology systems and/or infrastructure by persons with or without authorized access could disrupt our operations. We could also experience business interruption, information theft and/or reputational damage from cyber-attacks, which may compromise our systems and lead to data breaches either internally or at our third party infrastructure providers. Although we have invested in measures to reduce these risks, these measures may not be successful in preventing compromise and/or disruption of our information technology systems and related data.\n\nWe retain sensitive data, including intellectual property, books of record and personally identifiable information, on our networks. Customers require us to adhere to various data protection regulations throughout the world. It is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure and other infrastructure we use to host our solutions remain secure and are perceived by customers and partners to be secure. Despite our security measures, our infrastructure and third party infrastructure we use to host our solutions may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or other disruptive problems. Our cloud-based offering may create additional vulnerabilities due to the inherent risks of doing business on the internet. Any such security breach may compromise information stored on our networks. Such an occurrence could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted provider of solutions and hosting such solutions by adversely affecting the market's perception of the security or reliability of our products or services.\n\nOur intellectual property could be used by third parties without our consent because protection of our intellectual property is limited.\n\nOur success and ability to compete substantially depend upon our internally developed technology, which we protect through a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, patents and intellectual property law, together with non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements. These legal protections are limited. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. Policing unauthorized use of our products and technology is difficult and costly, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. The steps we have taken may not prevent infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.\n\nOur end-user licenses are designed to prohibit unauthorized use, copying or disclosure of our software and technology in the United States, Israel and other countries. However, these provisions may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions. Unauthorized third parties may be able to copy portions of our products, reverse engineer or obtain and use information and technology that we regard as proprietary. In addition, some of our licensed users may allow additional unauthorized users to use our software, and if we do not detect such use, we could lose potential license fees. In addition, as we deepen our ties with our channel and strategic partners, the number of people who are exposed to and interact with our software and other intellectual property increases. Despite our best efforts to protect our intellectual property, our channel or strategic partners, or their employees or customers, may copy portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use information and technology that we regard as proprietary. Our channel or strategic partners might also improperly incorporate portions of our technology into their own products or otherwise exceed the authorized scope of their licenses to our technology. If we are unable to successfully detect infringement and/or to enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitiveness may be adversely affected.\n\nOur technology and other intellectual property may be subject to infringement claims.\n\nSubstantial litigation regarding technology rights and other intellectual property rights exists in the software industry both in terms of infringement and ownership issues. We expect that software products may be increasingly subject to third-party infringement or ownership claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. A successful claim of patent, copyright or trademark infringement or conflicting ownership rights against us could require us to make changes in our business.\n\nThird parties may make a claim of infringement or conflicting ownership rights against us with respect to our products and technology. Any claims, with or without merit, could:\n\n·be expensive and time-consuming to defend;\n\n·divert management's attention and resources;\n\n·cause product shipment and installation delays; or\n\n·require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to obtain the right to use a necessary product or component, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\n\nWe also generally indemnify our customers against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We have only conducted a partial search for existing patents and other intellectual property registrations, and our products may infringe issued patents. In addition, because most patent applications are not publicly disclosed until sometime after the application is filed, applications may have been filed that relate to our products. If a successful claim was made against us and we failed to commercially develop or license a substitute technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nOur business is susceptible to numerous risks associated with international operations.\n\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from international sales and we maintain significant portions of our operations outside the United States. We expect international revenues to continue to account for a significant percentage of total revenues and we believe we must continue to expand our international sales and professional services activities to be successful. Our facilities are located in North America, Israel, the European continent, the United Kingdom, Australia, India and South Africa, and our executive officers and other key employees are dispersed throughout the world. This geographic dispersion requires significant management resources that may place us at a disadvantage compared to our locally-based competitors. In addition, our international operations are generally subject to a number of risks, including but not limited to:\n\n·foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\n·longer sales cycles;\n\n·multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations;\n\n·difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\n·licenses, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\n·loss of proprietary information due to piracy, misappropriation or weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection;\n\n·difficulties in communication and monitoring compliance with our internal corporate controls and policy;\n\n·difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws and legal standards;\n\n·potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\n·differing labor standards;\n\n·expenses associated with customizing products for foreign countries;\n\n·protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competition;\n\n·difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; and\n\n·political and economic instability.\n\nAlso, as we continue to expand into new geographic territories such as Latin America and Russia/Commonwealth of Independent States, adequate controls must be applied to our operations in these new territories in order to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nOne or more of these risks could harm our future international sales. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to manage the risk of doing business internationally.\n\nThe large amount of intangible assets and goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may continue to lead to significant impairment charges in the future.\n\nWe regularly review our long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, for impairment. Goodwill and acquired indefinite life intangible assets are subject to impairment review on an annual basis and whenever potential impairment indicators are present. Other long-lived assets are reviewed when there is an indication that impairment may have occurred. The amount of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet is expected to increase significantly following the purchase of Xora as described in section 4.B below to about $15 million and may increase further following future acquisitions. For example, in 2013, we recorded identifiable intangible assets impairment charges of $0.2 million. Changes in market conditions or other changes in the future outlook of value may lead to further impairment charges in the future. In addition, we may from time to time sell assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy or execution. Future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments and/or related charges. Certain non-cash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals, business direction or other factors relating to the overall business environment. Any significant impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nInvestment Risks\n\nIf our tax structure is challenged or determined to be inappropriate, our tax liabilities could increase.\n\nWe have created an intercompany tax structure based on accepted tax standards and in consultation with our tax advisors. We have potential tax exposures resulting from the varying application of statutes, regulations and interpretations, including exposures with respect to marketing, sales and distribution functions. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions may disagree with and challenge the amount of profits taxed in such jurisdictions, which may increase our tax liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.\n\nOur Chief Executive Officer owns a significant percentage of our Ordinary Shares and therefore could significantly influence the outcome of actions.\n\nAs of March 25, 2014, our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Moshe BenBassat, beneficially owned approximately 6.9% of our outstanding Ordinary Shares in the form of Ordinary Shares and options for the purchase our Ordinary Shares. Dr. BenBassat's wife, Idit BenBassat, owns approximately 5.4% of our outstanding Ordinary Shares (of which Dr. BenBassat disclaims beneficial ownership and voting control). Due to the wide dispersion of our share capital, Dr. BenBassat may be able to influence certain matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors, or a change of control of our Company. The influence of our Chief Executive Officer could adversely affect our stock price.\n\nIf we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company, our U.S. shareholders will be subject to adverse tax consequences.\n\nIf, for any taxable year, either, (1) 75% or more of our gross income is passive income or (2) 50% or more of our assets, averaged over the year and generally determined based upon value, including cash (even if held as working capital), produce or are held to produce passive income, we may be characterized as a \"passive foreign investment company\", or PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes. As a result of our cash position and the value of our assets, we may be deemed to be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nIf we are characterized as a PFIC, our shareholders who are residents of the United States will be subject to adverse U.S. tax consequences. Our treatment as a PFIC could result in a reduction in the after-tax return to shareholders resident in the United States and may cause a reduction in the value of our shares. If we were to be treated as a PFIC, our shareholders will be required, absent certain elections, to pay an interest charge together with tax calculated at the then prevailing highest tax rates on ordinary income on certain \"excess distributions\" including any gain on the sale of Ordinary Shares. The consequences of holding shares in a PFIC are described below under \"Additional Information – United States Federal Income Tax Consequences – Passive Foreign Investment Companies.\" Prospective investors should consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences applicable to them of investing in our Ordinary Shares.\n\nWe may raise additional equity from time to time, which could cause dilution for our existing shareholders or a decline in our share price.\n\nWe may raise equity capital through the issuance of additional Ordinary Shares, subject to market and other conditions. The future issuances of Ordinary Shares could cause the market price of our Ordinary Shares to decline and could cause our existing shareholders to experience significant dilution.\n\nRisks Relating to Our Location in Israel\n\nWe are incorporated in Israel and have important facilities and resources located in Israel, which could be negatively affected due to military or political tensions.\n\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel and our research and development facilities, as well as significant executive offices, are located in Israel. Although substantially all of our sales are to customers located outside of Israel, we are directly influenced by the political, economic and military conditions in Israel. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors and a state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Historically, Arab states have boycotted any direct trade with Israel and, to varying degrees, have imposed a secondary boycott on any company carrying on trade with, or doing business in, Israel. Although Israel has entered into agreements with Egypt, Jordan and Palestinian representatives, there have been continued and increasing difficulties in the relationship with the Palestinians and no prediction can be made as to whether a resolution of past problems will be achieved or as to the nature of any such resolution. Recent political uprisings and civil resistance demonstrations in various countries in the Middle East, including Egypt and Syria, are affecting the political stability of those countries. It is not clear how this instability, or the ‘Arab Spring’ in general, will develop and how it will affect the political and security situation in the Middle East. This instability may lead to deterioration of the political relationships that exist between Israel and these countries, and have raised concerns regarding security in the region and the potential for armed conflict. In addition, it is widely believed that Iran, which has previously threatened to attack Israel, has been stepping up its efforts to achieve nuclear capability. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The tension between Israel and Iran and/or these groups may escalate in the future and turn violent, which could affect the Israeli economy generally and us in particular. Any armed conflicts, terrorist activities or political instability in the region could adversely affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations.\n\nFor example, any major escalation in hostilities in the region could result in a portion of our employees being called up to perform military duty for an extended period of time. Certain of our employees in our office in Israel are currently obligated to perform up to 36-45 days of annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces and are subject to being called for active military duty at any time. The loss or extended absence of any of our key personnel due to these requirements could harm our business.\n\nTo date, these matters have not had a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, but they may do so in the future.\n\nWe have taken measures to put in place a business continuity plan addressing foreseen scenarios. However these scenarios do not include the whole range of possibilities and combinations of circumstances.\n\nThe tax benefits available to us require us to meet several conditions, and may be terminated or reduced in the future, which would increase our taxes.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, we incurred a pre-tax loss and recorded a tax benefit due to increase in deferred tax benefits. We have benefited or currently benefit from a variety of government programs and tax benefits that generally carry conditions that we must meet in order to be eligible to obtain any benefit.Going forward we expect our effective tax rates to increase compared to effective tax rates in 2012 due to the utilization of tax losses carry forwards mostly in Israel as well as our move to a less favorable tax bracket in Israel.\n\nIf we fail to meet the conditions upon which certain favorable tax treatment is based, we would not be able to claim future tax benefits and could be required to refund tax benefits already received. Additionally, some of these programs and the related tax benefits are available to us for a limited number of years, and these benefits expire from time to time.\n\nAny of the following could have a material effect on our overall effective tax rate:\n\n·some programs may be discontinued;\n\n·we may be unable to meet the requirements for continuing to qualify for some programs;\n\n·these programs and tax benefits may be unavailable at their current levels;\n\n·upon expiration of a particular benefit, we may not be eligible to participate in a new program or qualify for a new tax benefit that would offset the loss of the expiring tax benefit; or\n\n·we may be required to refund previously recognized tax benefits if we are found to be in violation of the stipulated conditions.\n\nAdditional details are provided in \"Item 5 – Operating and Financial Review and Prospects\" under the caption \"Taxes on income\", in \"Item 10 – Additional Information\" under the caption \"Israeli taxation, foreign exchange regulation and investment programs\" and in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nYour rights and responsibilities as a shareholder will be governed by Israeli Law and differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders under U.S. law.\n\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel. The rights and responsibilities of holders of our Ordinary Shares are governed by our memorandum of association, articles of association and by Israeli law. These rights and responsibilities may differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders in U.S. corporations. In particular, a shareholder of an Israeli company has a duty to act in good faith in exercising his or her rights and fulfilling his or her obligations toward the company and other shareholders and to refrain from abusing his or her power in the company, including, among other things, in voting at the general meeting of shareholders on certain matters. Israeli law provides that these duties are applicable in shareholder votes at the general meeting with respect to, among other things, amendments to a company's articles of association, increases in a company's authorized share capital, mergers and acquisitions and transactions involving interests of officers, directors or other interested parties which require the shareholders' general meeting's approval. In addition, a controlling shareholder of an Israeli company or a shareholder who knows that he or she possesses the power to determine the outcome of a vote at a meeting of our shareholders, or who has, by virtue of the company's articles of association, the power to appoint or prevent the appointment of an office holder in the company, or any other power with respect to the company, has a duty of fairness toward the company. The Israeli Companies Law, or the Companies Law, does not establish criteria for determining whether or not a shareholder has acted in good faith. Moreover, the Companies Law is relatively new and there is little case law available on the duty of a non-controlling shareholder to act in good faith.\n\nIt may be difficult to effect service of process and enforce judgments against directors, officers and experts in Israel.\n\nWe are incorporated and maintain significant operations in Israel. Some of our executive officers and directors and the Israeli accountants named in this annual report reside outside the United States and a significant portion of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. Therefore, it may be difficult for an investor, or any other person or entity, to affect service of process on us or any of those persons or to enforce a U.S. court judgment based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, against us or any of those persons, in an Israeli court. Additionally, it may be difficult for an investor or any other person or entity to enforce civil liabilities under U.S. federal securities laws in original actions instituted in Israel.\n\nWe are subject to anti-takeover provisions that could delay or prevent our acquisition by another entity.\n\nProvisions of Israeli corporate and tax law and of our articles of association may have the effect of delaying, preventing or making more difficult any merger or acquisition of us. In addition, any merger or acquisition of us will require the prior consent of the office of the chief scientist, or the Chief Scientist, if intellectual property is removed from Israel, as well as the Investment Center of the Israeli Ministry of Industry, Trade and Employment, or the Investment Center. Israeli law regulates mergers, votes required to approve a merger, acquisition of shares through tender offers and transactions involving significant shareholders. In addition, our articles of association provide for a staggered board of directors. Any of these provisions may make it more difficult to acquire us. Accordingly, our acquisition by another entity could be delayed or prevented even if it would be beneficial to our shareholders.\n\nThe government programs in which we have participated and the tax benefits we receive require us to satisfy prescribed conditions and may be delayed, terminated or reduced in the future.\n\nUntil 2010, we accepted grants from the Chief Scientist that helped us finance a portion of our research and development expenditures in Israel. In 2010 2% of our research and development expenses were financed with royalty-exempt grants from the Chief Scientist. Since 2010 we have not requested any further grants from the Chief Scientist. Although we do not rely on financing provided by the Chief Scientist and we have fully repaid our royalty commitments to the Chief Scientist, we must continue to satisfy the conditions of the grants. For example, if we fail to comply with the representations and covenants we made to the Chief Scientist concerning our research and development activities in Israel, we could be required to refund the amount of the benefits we have received, adjusted for interest, inflation and penalties.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to other restrictions with respect to products developed with grants from the Chief Scientist. Any know-how from the research developed with the grants from the Chief Scientist may not be transferred to third parties without prior approval of the Chief Scientist, and approval is contingent on the recipient agreeing to abide by the provisions of the Encouragement of Industrial Research and Development, 1984, or the Research Law, and related regulations. Also, our ability to manufacture products and transfer know how outside Israel without the approval of the Chief Scientist is restricted under Israeli law and we are required to pay increased royalties to the Chief Scientist of up to 300% of the original grant amount with respect to any products manufactured outside Israel. Since we conduct all of our manufacturing activities in Israel and intend to continue doing so, we do not expect any increase in the amount of royalties we are required to pay to the Chief Scientist.\n\nItem 4.Information on the company\n\n4.A.History and development\n\nOur corporate name is ClickSoftware Technologies Ltd. for both legal and commercial purposes. We were incorporated as a company under the laws of the State of Israel in 1979 and are subject to the Companies Law. From inception until 1996, we operated as a consulting company in the area of optimization and intelligent decision support systems. Thereafter, we transformed our business model to provide workforce management and optimization products and solutions. We have been listed for trading on the Nasdaq stock market since 2000. Our principal executive offices are located at Azorim Park, Oren Building, 94 Em Hamoshavot Road, Petach Tikva 4970602, Israel, and the telephone number at that location is +972-3-765-9400. Our website is located at http://www.clicksoftware.com, which is not a part of this annual report. Our wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, ClickSoftware, Inc., has been appointed our agent in the United States and is located at 35 Corporate Drive, Suite 400, Burlington, Massachusetts.\n\nOur capital expenditures for 2013, 2012, and 2011 amounted to $3.5 million, $2.5 million, and $2.0 million, respectively. These expenditures were primarily for hardware and software and leasehold improvements. Our current capital expenditures are primarily for leasehold improvements and hardware and software, and we expect to finance these expenditures primarily from cash on hand.\n\n4.B.Business overview\n\nWho We Are\n\nWe are a leading provider of software products and solutions for workforce management and optimization both for mobile and in-house resources. We derive revenues from the licensing of our software products installed on-premises or via subscriptions to our software when delivered as cloud-based SaaS; and the provision of consulting and support services. Our products for resource optimization are aimed at the service sector, where the primary resources are people (e.g., service technicians), unlike the manufacturing sector, where the primary resources are machines and raw materials. Another key differentiator from manufacturing is that a customer receiving service is typically part of the service process, having to stay home for the service, while in manufacturing the customer is not required to be present during the actual production process. Thus time utilization is critical for both the service resource and the customer, with the service provider seeking to avoid the well-known scenario of a customer waiting at home for the service resource to arrive, while also maximizing the utilization of its workforce.\n\nOur Focus\n\nWe continue our focus on three major growth engines: cloud services, mobility and territorial expansion.\n\n(1) Cloud Services\n\nWe continue to upgrade our infrastructure to support our cloud-based offerings. We have a separate division fully dedicated to selling cloud-based solutions of all our products, including our cloud-based ClickExpress product for the SMB market and its built-in mobility component. With this offering, we now have one of the best solutions for the field service mid-market where cloud-based solutions are gaining popularity. In 2013, we had significant achievements in this area, including the addition of several notable customers for our cloud-based solutions. We intend to capitalize on this momentum in 2014 and beyond.\n\n(2) Mobility\n\nWe believe that market penetration via mobility is a key to our growth. Customers now tend to first address workforce management improvement through mobility solutions, as opposed to optimization solutions. This is expected to significantly expand our addressable market. We will leverage our leadership position in deploying large scale enterprise mobility solutions at some of the most demanding organizations in the world as well as our ClickAppStore for business mobility solutions. We are already working to broaden awareness of our patent-pending ClickButler technology, a context-aware intelligent inference engine that increases productivity of mobile workers. Once a customer uses ClickSoftware’s mobility products, it dramatically increases the potential that we can upsell our schedule optimization and decision-making products. In addition, mobility solutions will assist us in selling our cloud-based offerings by enabling us to generate new business via small “apps” that are hosted in the cloud.\n\n(3) Territorial Expansion\n\nWe have now established operations in Brazil and Russia. Our local presence supports acceleration of sales in these territories and increases brand awareness. This initiative capitalizes on early successes in these emerging markets and our global leadership position in the utilities, telecommunication, and oil & gas industries, all of which are experiencing rapid growth in these markets. We continue to focus on expansion in markets in Latin America, Asia, and other emerging markets.\n\nOur Mission\n\nIn today’s highly competitive environment, our mission is to enable service organizations to execute on their service commitments at the right time and place effectively and efficiently. We achieve that goal by leveraging optimization and mobility technologies, as well as best practices, for real time on-going management of customers' commitments and the organization’s resources. By so doing we improve the experience of our customers’ customers, maximize productivity and service revenues and minimize the cost of service delivery. The end result is higher customer acquisition and retention as well as improved financial performance.\n\nOur products and solutions incorporate best business practices, key business functions of service operations, and sophisticated decision-making algorithms that enable our customers to manage their service operations more efficiently in a scalable, integrated manner. Our products for daily management are mission critical applications that manage incoming jobs from the moment a job is opened until it is successfully closed, including generating the appointment time for a customer, assigning the job to the appropriate technician, designing the optimal route for the technician to minimize travel, and monitoring progress. Mobility solutions on smartphones, tablets and laptops are also part of our offering aimed at on-going real time optimization of customer response and at increasing the productivity of technicians, supervisors, managers and executives. Our solutions have become the backbone of service operations management in many large scale leading organizations worldwide by addressing the fundamental question of job fulfillment: Who does What, for Whom, With what, Where and When (W-6).\n\nOur enterprise mobility initiative continues to serve as a major growth engine for our company and generates value for our customers in several ways. First, at the group level of matching jobs and resources, it addresses the dynamic decision-making required during the day of service. Second, once a given resource receives its sequence of jobs for the day, our mobile software enhances his/her productivity. With the proliferation of new tablets and smartphones for consumer usage, businesses are looking for ways to leverage these new devices and technologies in their businesses. We view the mobile device as the field office of the technician, and accordingly offer functionality to facilitate his/her daily activities and to promote paperless operations. The market for enterprise mobility is expanding with the explosive growth in consumer-related mobile applications, or apps. With years of experience in developing and deploying business mobility solutions, we believe that we have the right platform at the right time to take full advantage of these opportunities. In 2012, our Mobility solutions and ClickAppStore won four categories in the eleventh annual Mobile Star Awards™ program, including Dr. Moshe BenBassat, our CEO, winning the enterprise mobile software visionary category. In 2013, we received, together with our customer Portugal Telecom, the Global Telecoms Business Innovation Award for innovating through automated scheduling and mobility. In 2014, we received Frost & Sullivan’s Innovation Award for developing a context-aware, artificial intelligence-based software assistant for mobile field workers.\n\nThe enterprise mobility initiative is based on our ClickAppStore which includes numerous ready-to-use mobile business apps, as well as a unique integrated development environment (IDE) in which IT professionals can assemble business apps into end-user solutions using primarily no-coding ‘drag and drop’ visual wizards. As more companies move to build their own application stores for smartphones and tablets, we believe that we have one of the best platforms for enabling IT professionals to develop their own application store with minimal time to market per app, and with considerably lower technical skills requirements.\n\nIn 2013, we achieved recognition for our enterprise mobility from analysts and partners. For example, Gartner, a leading information technology research and advisory company, included us in its Magic Quadrant for Mobile Application Development Platforms (MADP). Gartner assessed 22 vendors based on their ability to execute and completeness of vision (source: Gartner Magic Quadrant for Mobile Application Development Platforms, by Ian Finley, Van L. Baker, Ken Parmelee, David Mitchell Smith, Ray Valdes, Gordon Van Huizen, published 7 August 2013).1\n\n1 The Gartner Reports described herein, (the \"Gartner Reports\"), represent data, research opinion or viewpoints published, as part of a syndicated subscription service, by Gartner, Inc.

Recognizing that many large service companies today outsource or utilize external contractors, we offer capabilities in our products to support such operations under a variety of arrangements between our client and its contractors.\n\nWhile other service management applications, such as Customer Relationship Management, Enterprise Asset Management, or Outage Management Systems, produce work orders to be executed, our products for Workforce Management and Service Optimization focus on the fulfillment/delivery of these work orders in a cost-effective manner. In a way our software is the flip side of those other service management applications. All of these combined may also be categorized as an Asset Performance Optimization offering.\n\nInternal and External Interoperability\n\nOur products operate on the same software architecture with extensive interoperability within our own products, as well as with external products. In 2009, we released Version 8 of our products which is based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), an architecture which, we believe, is the standard in the software industry. This architecture enables interoperability via web services and greatly facilitates integration with the outside world. The ease with which our products can be integrated with leading CRM, Enterprise Resource Planning, or ERP, and EAM solutions, often with standard interface adaptors, enables our customers to efficiently deploy our solutions. We continue to develop our products and currently offer Version 8.10 to our customers.\n\nIn our ClickPlatform we have also adopted an extensive approach towards interoperability. Our Mobility Platform is infrastructure-agnostic and can integrate with various state-of-the-art vendors such as Microsoft (RDA), SAP (Sybase/SUP), IBM (Worklight) and pure HTML5\\WebService. We further provide an innovative set of visual configuration tools and a flexible object model for building mobile business applications and storing them in our shared ClickAppStore. Our ClickStudio, using drag-&-drop functions, allows the creation of modules and workflows components based on ClickApps, with the ability to connect them together into one or more business applications.\n\nMethodically Expanding the Industry Verticals We Address\n\nOver the years we have been methodically expanding, and continue to expand, the industry verticals we address. Historically our focus was on mobile workforce for field service operations, including utility (electricity, gas and water) companies, telecommunication, computer and office equipment, medical equipment, and the like. A typical scenario would be optimal resource and time slot allocation for a stream of incoming service calls to install, repair or service customer or infra-structure/network equipment. Over the years, this group expanded to include insurance agents, home health care and oil and gas companies. With the introduction of enhanced shift scheduling (rostering) products, we expanded to cover industry verticals that operate a shift-based workforce - 24x7 or more than one shift. These verticals include both field service operations such as public transportation, airport security and in-house service operations such as prison contact centers, retail stores, and more. A typical scenario involves the assignment of people to shifts in such a way that estimated customer demand for service is optimally covered, employee desires are respected, and cost is minimized.\n\nValue to Our Customers\n\nWe sell end-to-end solutions to support decision-making and execution needs across the service enterprise covering long, mid, and short term needs, including intense real time processes to address the dynamic aspects during the day of service. We sell to service operations that need to (1) optimize the delivery of their service commitments, and (2) grow the cost of service at slower pace than their revenue growth. We create value by considerably increasing compliance with service commitments, resource productivity and overall visibility and control.\n\nWe offer value to customers at several levels which can be generally categorized into two main categories. The first category is group productivity (W-6). The second category is personal productivity – maximizing the resource’s individual productivity and job quality.\n\nBefore optimization and mobility solutions are introduced to a service organization, W-6 decisions are made manually by schedulers/dispatchers, and communication with the field during the day is non-existent or limited to voice communication. Our products are designed to markedly improve the customer experience in today's intense and demanding service world. Our goal is to eliminate the so called \"service guy syndrome\" – a situation we are all too familiar with of waiting at home endlessly for the service technician to arrive. In addition to improving customer service, which by itself has substantial impact on business success and market share, our products enable our clients to improve productivity by reducing travel time, reducing overtime, increasing on-site efficiency and minimizing overall time waste. The value delivered by our products is quantifiable and can be measured by business metrics that directly impact the financial results of our clients. These metrics include, for instance, impact on revenues derived from improvements in productivity as measured by an increase in the number of jobs delivered, or impact on operating profit. With our products, our clients can scale up their revenues and profits faster than the scale up needed in their cost of operation in order to achieve their business growth.\n\nMarkets and Product Offerings\n\nTask-based versus Shift-based Service Operations\n\nService operations can also be classified into field service operations - operations where the service is delivered at the customer location - and in-house operations - where the customer comes to the service provider to receive service, or receives the service by phone, e.g. hospitals, retail, or airports. In field service operations, the basic time units in daily management are job duration at customer sites and travel time from customer to customer, or task-based scheduling. On the other hand, in many in-house service operations the basic time units for daily management are shifts, e.g. 7AM to 3PM, 3PM to 11PM, etc., and the challenge for these operations is shift-based scheduling. Many service operations requires both shift scheduling as well as intra-shift task-based scheduling, such as position switching of airport security agents within a shift, or agents in contact centers within a given shift, or accompanying prisoners to the court house. One of our unique differentiators is the ability to address within one set of integrated products a wide range of field service and in-house service scenarios - from operations with relatively low changes during the day to companies with high rates of dynamic changes requiring real time workforce optimization. We believe that this unique differentiator increases our win rate for new clients in certain industries. By adding shift optimization solutions to our offerings we increased considerably the size of our addressable market by expanding into in-house service operations, or other shift-based operations such as public safety forces and transportation.\n\nService Chain Optimization: From Daily Management to Tactical and Strategic Decision Making\n\nThe optimization and decision-making support which our products offer do not start on the day of service. By the time we reach the day of service, the workforce's size and skill mix have already been determined down to the names of the individuals and the shift each one of them will be staffing on that day. This capacity is the result of a sequence of decisions, some of which may have been made as long as a year or more in advance. In the period just before the day of service individuals are assigned to shifts for the coming weeks in a way that their quantity and skill mix can cover the estimated demand for each hour of the day/week. In the months prior to staffing the shifts for a given week, we need to first ensure that an adequate group of people mix by skill and sites will be available for selection from the personnel available for the shifts, e.g., approving vacation requests, training assignments and delegation to sub-contractors. Hiring options at this stage are fairly limited. This stage is for \"master\" planning, also known as tactical resource planning.\n\nSeveral months prior to the day of service, capacity planning takes place. This phase involves determining the size and the skill mix in each territory as a function of the company's strategic plan and forecasted demand for customer service. For example, a company may plan to introduce a new product line or expand in a given territory. At this stage, sufficient time is available for hiring and training new employees or relocating or re-training existing employees. For each of these decision-making stages, a key input is demand forecasting by job type and territories with the time accuracy required for that stage.\n\nThis concept of continuous optimization over the decision making time horizon is known as \"service chain optimization,\" a process pioneered by us in the 1990's and for which we have been issued a U.S. patent (see \"Intellectual Property\" below).\n\nOur products cover the needs of companies across the entire service decision making chain. This holistic approach – which is a key differentiator of our offering - streamlines operations across all levels and functions in the organization from executives to forecasters and planners all the way to regional service mangers, dispatchers and individual resources, e.g. technicians. We leverage recent technology developments in devices (e.g., tablets, smartphones) as well as delivery models (e.g., on-premise, hosted). By incorporating these into our offerings, we provide the latest and most advanced work force management solutions to our clients, and the best possible customer experience to their customers. We continue to grow a knowledge base and approach to service optimization and time-related needs. Our scalability, algorithmic intelligence and power, broadly applicable service platform (ClickPlatform), and integration of all aspects of the service model allow us to address nearly every service problem, in any environment, for any size and type of organization.\n\nMobility Technology Enabling the Real Time Service Enterprise\n\nA service operation is ultimately measured by its performance at the day of service. A typical day in a field service operation starts with the morning schedule that contains the assignments for all the known work orders of the day. As the day develops, emergencies may arise, cancellations may occur, jobs may take longer or shorter than expected, and traffic problems may cause unexpected delays. These contingencies present significant challenges and an effective workforce management solution must minimize the disruptions to the existing work orders while accommodating the new emergency orders that must be delivered on the same day. By integrating real-time updates from the technician's mobile devices and/or GPS-based location reporting devices with our decision-making algorithms, our solutions offer comprehensive coverage to address these challenges and help ensure that the work-plan is continually optimized.\n\nThe wide acceptance of mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets offer unique opportunities to continually optimize service delivery execution. We believe that handheld data communication devices and GPS location reports can be used far beyond their traditional role of data transmission to and from the field. These tools can be used for real-time decision-making in order to increase productivity and customer responsiveness. For instance, our products and solutions enable a concept known as \"drip feed\" management by which, initially, every technician receives only the first two tasks of the day. Upon completing the first task, the technician confirms task completion and a new task is assigned. This technique contributes to improved priority management, travel minimization and customer responsiveness. Similarly, with a GPS reporting system, the dispatcher need not ask technicians where they are located since he or she knows at all times where every technician is located, generating additional efficiencies by improved customer-technician assignments. We also provide applications via mobile devices that support specific business process flows that enables the technician to manage business process including connectivity to back office systems like ERP and CRM.\n\nOur solutions constantly monitor the incoming list of new tasks at all levels of frequency in full synchronization with the delivery status of the existing tasks and the availability of technicians and spare parts in order to maximize productivity and output while complying with promised delivery dates and other business rules.\n\nMobility Technology Enabling Higher Personal Productivity\n\nThe early mobile devices were quite limited in terms of screen size, graphics, typing, and overall user-interface, and not much could be done with them beyond job-dispatch and job-delivery exchange. With the introduction of smartphones and tablets, greater opportunities exist to support the individual user. Once several jobs have been assigned to a resource, our mobility apps further improve the resource’s productivity by offering timely help in navigation, asset information, timesheets, job reporting, upselling and more. The mobile device transforms into the mobile office of the resource, virtually eliminating paperwork, minimizing errors, and increasing productivity even further. All these benefits are compounded on top of the business gain derived from the group productivity.\n\nClickAppStore and Enterprise Mobility\n\nWith the proliferation of smartphones and tablets for consumer use, business people are naturally looking for ways to use them for business needs. According to VDC Research estimates, there were approximately 300 million smartphone users and 25 million tablet users in the enterprise market in 2012, – and by 2014, the research firm projects the mobile workforce will grow to 1.2 billion workers.\n\nThe current enterprise mobility market is one of “apps in the cloud”. The trend is away from buying enterprise software as large monolithic do-everything solutions. Instead, enterprises are buying business apps, with each app serving specific goals and enabling the organization to achieve rapid selection, deployment and ROI. Our mobility strategy and solutions, as described below, are built to support this trend via a rich selection of apps in the ClickAppStore. One potential weakness of the replacement of enterprise software with separate apps is that typical apps are standalone, forcing users to repeatedly jump between apps and re-enter data. However, with ClickApps, once an organization chooses apps from the ClickAppStore, these apps automatically combine to create an environment with shared data and workflows.\n\nTypes of mobile users and advantages: Two main types of mobile business users can be distinguished: an office worker who is occasionally in the field, and a mobile worker who spends most of his/her working time in the field. Examples of the mobile worker are: utility and telecommunication engineers - for both consumer work as well as infrastructure work, oil and gas employees, technicians for office, high tech or medical equipment, insurance claim adjustors, home healthcare providers, field door to door sales agents, pharmaceutical agents, and the like. While the advantages of mobile devices for the occasional user are moderate, they offer tremendous benefits for the field mobile worker in terms of productivity gains and customer satisfaction. The mobile field user's attention, e.g., cable technician, or insurance agent, is focused on the mobile device for only short time slots as most of their time should be devoted to interacting with people, servicing equipment, driving, or other tasks involved in getting the job done. Thus it is critical to have streamlined user interfaces that require minimal typing and easily handle all back-office communication. Without these prerequisites, users will resort back to paper-work and voice communication despite all their limitations, e.g., time consumption and errors.\n\nUniqueness of business mobile apps: The main difference between consumer mobile apps and business mobile apps is in the type of need they answer for the user of the mobile device. Consumer mobile apps are designed for the single user, typically are not interoperable and do not easily connect to enterprise back-end organizational systems. They are not geared for the tight security requirements of business systems. Additionally, business people often need to use multiple apps to carry out their business role, where the output of one app serves as the input for another app, and apps are assumed to be aware of common data (as opposed to having the user copy and paste data from one app to another). The need for streamlined workflow is critical for the business mobile apps. The benefits of these apps, specifically those designed for the enterprise, are that they work together and provide an end-to-end connection between the mobile device and the back-office enterprise IT systems. In addition to simplifying everyday processes and improving productivity, business apps provide the potential to significantly increase customer satisfaction by introducing processes that automate response or notifications to the customer.\n\nThe ClickAppStore is a virtual store implemented through an application website that contains a wide variety of business-oriented “ClickApps”. The ClickApps address a range of common business scenarios/processes for different industries, including upselling, employee collaboration, timesheet management, employee safety and travel navigation.\n\nUsing an integrated development environment called “ClickStudio,” discrete apps can be combined to form composite apps for complete end to end work flows and solutions. A significant portion of this process is accomplished via “drag & drop” operations with minimal coding and without having to upgrade the existing underlying infrastructure. Our ClickAppStore uses our ClickPlatform to keep track and maintain context across multiple mobile apps, in order to make these workflows seamless and friendly.\n\nWe intend to embed the ClickButler technology serving as the user’s ultimate personal assistant in just about every ClickApp where it may be useful. Contemporary mobile solutions require too much swiping and typing which consume precious time and reduce user-acceptance and usage. ClickButler technology leads to significant efficiencies and improvement in compliance with company policies derived from prompts and reminders, minimal typing, health and safety aids, and more. The ClickButler concept is designed to improve the built-in “intelligence” of our mobile and non-mobile apps by anticipating what the user needs and acting on it proactively, and within the right context. Our notion of a “Context Board” and its related actions expands the definition of “state,” “context” and “action” to just about any parameter in the ‘Business Universe’ under consideration - such as customer contract, technician skill, spare-part availability or job urgency. Unlike the consumer world where location-awareness, time-awareness, and weather-awareness cover the vast majority of the behaviors seen today, ClickButlers’ generalized engine for context- aware computing, systematizes the creation of butler behavior, including tools to configure them at a group and individual level. (Certain butler behaviors are derived from company practices and policies and thus are common to all users, e.g. service technicians).\n\nSuites, Products and Services\n\nOur solutions are designed to deliver improvements in:\n\n·workforce productivity;\n\n·responsiveness to customers;\n\n·customer service experience;\n\n·profitability of the service operation; and\n\n·reduction in missed customer commitments.\n\nOnce we sell our products we are frequently contracted for services to help with their deployment. To ensure success and minimize cost to our customers, each of our services engagements follows a structured implementation methodology which has proven successful in hundreds of customer implementations. This methodology includes the following phases: planning, requirements gathering, design, delivery, training, testing, go-live and transition to worldwide support organization. Each phase requires the cooperation of and contributions from the customer in order to ensure a successful delivery. Unlike more traditional methodologies, when we start working with a new client, we do not start with a blank slate, ask the users what they want, write down the answers, and return months later with an implemented version, only to learn that certain points were missing or misunderstood. To deliver what the users really need, we have developed a set of \"starter kits\" and automatic adaptation processes that together deliver ready-to-go \"close-enough\" solutions. We work with the users on real-life scenarios on a working solution, and the users only need to point out what they like and what they want to change, leading to a much faster and more reliable process of delivering a usable solution. We call this methodology \"WISIK\", or \"When I See (it) I’ll Know (it)\". Users are much better at adapting on a working system than they are at designing a system from scratch.\n\nSuites\n\nOur solutions are offered individually or packaged into fo"
