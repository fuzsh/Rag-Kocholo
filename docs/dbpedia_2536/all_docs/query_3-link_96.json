We have a wholly-owned subsidiary\n\nincorporated in California, ClickSoftware, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary\n\nincorporated in the United Kingdom, ClickSoftware Europe, Limited and a\n\nwholly-owned subsidiary in Belgium, ClickSoftware Belgium, N.V. On January 21,\n\n2002 our U.S. subsidiary incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in Australia,\n\nClickSoftware Australia Pty Limited. Our product development efforts are\n\nconducted primarily in Israel. Our sales and marketing and implementation\n\nefforts in North America are conducted by our California subsidiary. Our sales\n\nand marketing and implementation efforts in Europe are conducted by our United\n\nKingdom subsidiary.\n\nPRODUCTS\n\nWe provide solutions for end-to-end service chain optimization that maximize\n\nrevenue and customer responsiveness while minimizing costs. Our Service\n\nOptimization suite includes strategic and tactical workforce planning, optimized\n\nservice scheduling, intelligent problem resolution, wireless workforce\n\nmanagement, and business analytics, connecting all organizational levels and all\n\nfunctions from executive strategy to operational execution.\n\nOur service optimization solutions are utilized by leading service organizations\n\nin several service industry segments including: telecommunications, computer and\n\noffice equipment, industrial equipment, medical equipment, building automation,\n\nutilities, financial services, aerospace & defense, and home services.\n\nClickSoftware's solutions deliver rapid improvements in:\n\n* field workforce productivity\n\n* responsiveness to customers\n\n4\n\n* quality of service delivered\n\n* profitability of the service operation\n\n* reduction in missed customer commitments\n\nWe have achieved our leadership in service chain optimization through years of\n\nexperience in a variety of service operations. The result is a highly advanced\n\ntechnology with the flexibility to model and accommodate varying business types\n\nand processes. The ease with which it can be integrated with leading customer\n\nrelationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions,\n\noften with standard interface adaptors, enables ClickSoftware customers to\n\naccelerate the deployment of the solution.\n\nSERVICE OPTIMIZATION SUITE OF PRODUCTS\n\nOur solution provides an end-to-end solution for improving the efficiency and\n\neffectiveness of service operations. All of our products utilize an advanced\n\noptimization engine to drive decisions within service organizations based on\n\ncommon business goals and policies from the CEO to the field technician. Our\n\nService Optimization suite includes:\n\nCLICKPLAN provides interactive and automated workforce planning for optimal\n\nstaffing and deployment of the field workforce based on forecasted workload.\n\nClickPlan enables service organizations to resolve workforce shortages and\n\nsurpluses weeks and months in advance. Comparing available resources to\n\nforecasted workloads, ClickPlan determines the best strategy to ensure the right\n\npeople are in the right place, at the right time.\n\nCLICKSCHEDULE provides optimized service scheduling and routing for maximizing\n\nworkforce productivity and customer loyalty by balancing customer, resource, and\n\norganizational preferences including contractual commitments, priority, drive\n\ntime, skills, and resource availability. Easy configuration, very high\n\nscalability and use of standard eXtensible Markup Language (XML) interfaces\n\nenable seamless integration with enterprise systems and rapid deployment\n\naccording to organizational business policies and processes.\n\nCLICKFIX provides intelligent diagnostics and problem resolution for minimizing\n\nservice costs while increasing customer loyalty. ClickFix enables faster\n\nresolution of customer issues at every level of service contact, from the call\n\ncenter to the field. Based on an intelligent engine that utilizes specific\n\nknowledge about customers' equipment, ClickFix quickly and accurately diagnoses\n\nand resolves problems independent of the user's skills, experience, and\n\nknowledge. Accessibility via the Web empowers customers to resolve problems\n\nthemselves at any time of day, and often without a resource, requiring fewer\n\nonsite visits.\n\nCLICKMOBILE provides wireless workforce management for monitoring field\n\nworkforce activities and reducing the labor of dispatching. ClickMobile enables\n\ninstant, automatic job detail notification from the field and allows for field\n\nupdates even when resources are out of wireless coverage. Assignments created in\n\nClickSchedule are dispatched to field devices based on configurable workflows\n\nwhile enabling real-time visibility into workforce activity including job\n\nstatus, start, and end time.\n\nCLICKANALYZE provides service business analytics for workforce performance\n\nmeasurement and strategic decision support. ClickAnalyze enables drill-down\n\nanalysis of key performance indicators including resource productivity,\n\noperational costs, and responsiveness to customers. Integrated within the\n\nService Optimization suite, ClickAnalyze provides executive level summaries as\n\nwell as detailed analysis by territory, job type, time frame and other criteria.\n\nSERVICEMARKETPLACE provides inter-enterprise service optimization for\n\nstreamlining communication with service contractors and subsidiaries.\n\nServiceMarketPlace overcomes organizational boundaries, enabling immediate and\n\nreliable customer commitments via automated and Internet-based communication.\n\nContractors can be scheduled based on capacity, skills, coverage and other\n\nconfigurable criteria. Control over service delivery for contracted work is\n\nfurther improved with online monitoring and performance measurement.\n\n5\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nThe Service Optimization suite utilizes a foundation of core technologies that\n\nwe developed over a period of more than 10 years in the service industry.\n\nOriginally brought to market as W-6 Service Scheduler and TechMate, these\n\ntechnologies include sophisticated algorithms and business process\n\nrepresentation tools. Our research and development personnel have been working\n\non service optimization technology solutions since 1985, including algorithmic\n\nsoftware solutions, system integration and implementations. The Service\n\nOptimization suite, with its unique depth and breadth, reflects our experience\n\nand investment into the complex optimization and decision support\n\ntroubleshooting needs of service organizations.\n\nAnalogous to, but more complex than the supply chain, the service chain involves\n\nfar more variables and challenges including the scheduling of personnel with\n\nvarying skills in different locations to simple and complex tasks. All of these\n\nvariables must be considered in constantly changing conditions to meet the fast\n\npace typical of service-level and profit driven organizations.\n\nOur applications are standards-based, facilitating rapid integration with\n\nrelated Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Enterprise Resource Planning\n\n(ERP) or supply chain functions. Service Optimization client applications run on\n\nstandard web browsers and Windows-based computers. The application server\n\nsupports leading database management systems, including Oracle (Windows and\n\nnon-Windows) and Microsoft SQL Server. The stateless server architecture of\n\nService Optimization enables web-based applications to work effectively through\n\nlocal and wide area networks, over standard Internet communication protocols.\n\nScalable enough to meet the demands of the world's largest service\n\norganizations, Service Optimization delivers inherent scalability based on a\n\ndynamic load balancing architecture that uses thin clients, a stateless server\n\nmodel, multi-threaded application servers and relational databases.\n\nour proprietary optimization algorithms provide efficient solutions for complex\n\nproblems arising from, among others, the following:\n\n* the vast number of possible solutions for evaluation when optimizing\n\nthe scheduling of personnel;\n\n* the number of service organization-specific resources and variables\n\nincluding skills, availability, location, customer preference,\n\nworkload balancing, contractual commitments, employee preferences,\n\ncustomer priority, and others;\n\n* the need to instantly respond to concurrent users' service requests in\n\na highly dynamic decision-making environment;\n\n* the vast number of potential routes within a specific geographic area,\n\neach having an impact on the cost of service; and\n\n* various time zone considerations in large service organizations.\n\nService Optimization also includes sophisticated service business scenario\n\nmodeling power. We have developed models based on a vast number of variables and\n\nresource characteristics common to service organizations. By employing these\n\nmodels, Service Optimization addresses the market needs of different segments of\n\nthe service industry and broadens the customer base for our products.\n\nService Optimization incorporates several critical technologies to provide\n\nintelligent decision support in a scalable and open architecture:\n\n* Application software and web servers capable of performing high-speed\n\noptimization, problem resolution, and Internet access to the\n\napplication host system; and\n\n* Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) based on eXtensible Markup\n\nLanguage (XML), enable other application to integrate and access\n\nService Optimization data and services without additional training or\n\napplications for users to adopt.\n\nour optimization merges mathematical disciplines and experience with real-life\n\nservice operations. The result is a powerful algorithm that combines the best\n\ntraits of several optimization disciplines including adaptive learning, genetic\n\nalgorithms, taboo search, and geographic clustering. Our optimization overcomes\n\nthe challenge of a vast number of possible schedules by first rapidly\n\nidentifying all feasible schedules, and then selecting the best schedules. The\n\n6\n\nbest schedule is selected by evaluating each feasible schedule by weighted cost\n\nof service, job revenue, and customer satisfaction to create a business value\n\nfor the schedule. The business value is then used to compare the quality of all\n\nschedules, constantly maintaining an optimized schedule. ClickFix's diagnostic\n\nand problem resolution engine includes algorithms for fast problem resolution\n\nbased on equipment design and field knowledge, a knowledge base with\n\nself-learning capabilities, and an intelligent component that creates new\n\ntrouble shooting solutions based on modeling both equipment structure and\n\nhistoric data.\n\nOur development methodology is based on techniques that facilitate development\n\nof components that can be incorporated in future products. This methodology\n\nenables us to reduce the time required to introduce functional enhancements and\n\nnew products. The development methodology involves direct analysis of customers'\n\nbusiness requirements, software module design to meet these requirements,\n\nsoftware development and coding, testing, and quality assurance. Our research\n\nand development group and their processes are ISO 9001 certified.\n\nPROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT\n\nOur professional services organization is staffed by professionals with\n\nsignificant experience in the resource optimization field. We provide our\n\nclients with consulting and deployment services, upgrades, and comprehensive\n\ntraining and support to help achieve business goals with a quick return on\n\ninvestment. Our consulting services include:\n\n* Business Analysis. Our consultants assess current or planned\n\nscheduling needs, develop and document the project plan, and deliver\n\nthe design specification. We provide a configuration and\n\nimplementation roadmap to help meet business goals, including an\n\nanalysis of return on investment.\n\n* Project Implementations. Our professional services consultants\n\nindividually, or as members of our clients' teams, implement and\n\nassist in the configuration of our solutions to accelerate the project\n\ndeployment schedule and ensure a successful implementation process.\n\n* CLICKSCHEDULE FAST TRACK. In order to increase the number of our\n\nimplementations and facilitate market acceptance of our CLICKSCHEDULE\n\nsolution, we introduced CLICKSCHEDULE FAST TRACK to provide\n\naccelerated ClickSchedule implementation. We believe this methodology\n\nenables clients to achieve benefits quickly from rapid implementation.\n\nOnce the CLICKSCHEDULE FAST TRACK implementation is completed, we\n\noffer enhancements and customizations that provide additional\n\nfunctionality to our CLICKSCHEDULE product.\n\nCustomer support is available by telephone and over the Internet. Customer\n\nsupport is billed as a percentage of license fees depending upon the level of\n\nsupport coverage requested by the customer. Support is provided by the technical\n\nsupport team in our product development group, ensuring detailed product\n\nknowledge and access to experts and testing facilities when required. The\n\ncustomer support team works closely with the professional services organization\n\nin providing technical support during client project implementations and\n\ntransferring completed projects from professional services organization to the\n\nclient support team.\n\n7\n\nSALES AND MARKETING\n\nWe market and sell our products primarily through our direct sales force, which\n\nis located in North America, Europe, the Asia Pacific region and Africa. Our\n\nmultidisciplinary sales teams consist of field sales executives, sales support\n\nengineers and internal sales staff. The internal sales staff is responsible for\n\ngenerating leads and qualifying prospective clients. Sales support engineers\n\nassist the sales executives in the technical aspects of the sales process,\n\nincluding preparing demonstrations and technical proposals. Our sales executives\n\nare responsible for completing the sales process and managing the post-sale\n\nclient relationship, which consists of ongoing relationship management and the\n\nsale of additional licenses, as clients require additional resources. Our\n\nmanagement also takes an active role in our sales efforts. The knowledge gained\n\nby our sales and marketing force is also communicated to our product marketing\n\ngroup which guides our development team. This enables our organization to align\n\nthe functionality of our products with customer needs.\n\nWe typically direct our sales efforts to the client's chief executive officer,\n\nthe chief information officer, the vice presidents of customer service and other\n\nsenior executives responsible for improving customer service at our clients'\n\norganizations. We focus our marketing efforts on identifying potential new\n\nclients, generating new sales opportunities, and creating awareness in our\n\ntarget markets about the value of our products and their applications. Our\n\nprograms target prospective clients across a wide variety of industries,\n\nbusiness relationships and geographies. In order to effectively promote product\n\nawareness, we engage in marketing activities in a wide variety of areas\n\nincluding public relations and analyst relations, email campaigns, web seminars\n\nwith our customers and industry analysts, a newsletter and advertising creation\n\nand placement, direct mailings and trade shows. As of December 31, 2001, we\n\nemployed over 51 individuals in our sales and marketing department.\n\nOur business development organization supports joint marketing activities with\n\nour business partners. Our business relationships enable us to use our partners'\n\nmarket presence and sales channels to create additional revenue opportunities.\n\nWe have entered into co-marketing arrangements with leading ERP companies and\n\nCRM vendors. We participate in joint sales efforts. A partial list of these\n\nvendors includes Amdocs Limited/Clarify, JD Edwards & Company, PeopleSoft\n\nInc./Vantive, SAP AG, and Siebel Systems, Inc.\n\nWe have also established relationships with large System Integrator (SI)\n\norganizations such as Accenture, Anderson Consulting, PriceWaterhouseCoopers,\n\nDeloitte Consulting, Logica SA/NV, KPMG Consulting, Inc. and Computer Sciences\n\nCorporation. These partners have committed various levels of resources to\n\nintegrate, customize and implement our solutions. Depending on the strength of\n\nthe relationship, we have co-invested in training and certifying their\n\nprofessional services teams, developed co-marketing programs, and incorporated\n\nour products into their marketing/referral strategies.\n\nWe also have a focused reseller program. Our formal reseller agreements\n\ngenerally provide the parties with the right to use each other's name in\n\nmarketing and advertising materials, and to conduct joint marketing programs.\n\nThese agreements are generally for a one-year period and are automatically\n\nrenewable. We provide sales materials and training to resellers on the\n\nmarketing, selling and implementation of our software solutions. A sampling of\n\nthese partners includes: i2 Technologies, Inc., Metrix, Inc., AST, Planwell Pty.\n\nLimited and Axiom Corporation. We believe these relationships will extend our\n\npresence and brand name in new and existing markets.\n\nCUSTOMERS\n\nWe sell our products to a broad base of clients representing a variety of\n\nindustries with unique needs, including telecommunications, utilities,\n\nhigh-technology service providers and home equipment retailers. The following is\n\na representative list of our clients or end-users using our products. This list\n\nof clients is representative of the geographically dispersed client base, the\n\nvarious industries utilizing our products and the various stages of deployment\n\nof our product lines. Each of these clients accounted for at least $500,000 of\n\nproduct and/or service revenues for 2001 and, as a group, these clients\n\naccounted for approximately 41% of our total revenues for 2001:\n\n8\n\nExpanets Inc.\n\nLondon Electricity plc\n\nNRC Benelux B.V. (Nashuatec)\n\nPhilips Medical Systems Nederland B.V.\n\nSiemens Building Technologies AG\n\nTelekom Austria AG\n\nTelstra Corporation\n\nOne customer accounted for greater than 10% of revenues during the year ended\n\nDecember 31, 2001.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nWe believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our\n\nstrategy of enhancing our core technology, developing additional products and\n\nmaintaining the competitiveness of our product and service offerings. We have\n\ninvested significant time and resources in creating a structured process for\n\nundertaking all product development projects. These include documenting product\n\nrequirements, specifying product features and workflow, developing the software,\n\nperforming quality assurance, and creating documentation and packaging. Our\n\nresearch and development center in Israel is ISO 9000 compliant and continuously\n\nupdates its software development procedures to maintain an ongoing improvement\n\nprocess and high quality products.\n\nOur future research and development strategies will concentrate on strengthening\n\nour product offerings in decision support, forecasting, capacity planning and\n\nmonitoring, schedule optimization and installations scheduling, and continuing\n\nto enhance the scalability of our products, and in continuing the development of\n\nofferings for specific vertical industries.\n\nOur research and development expenses, prior to participation grants from the\n\nOffice of the Chief Scientist of the Government of Israel, totaled $4.4 million\n\nfor the year ended December 31, 2001, $5.4 million for the year ended December\n\n31, 2000, and $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. As of December\n\n31, 2001, we employed 41 individuals in our research and development group.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe market for our products is competitive and rapidly changing. We expect\n\ncompetition to increase in the future as current competitors expand their\n\nproduct offerings and new companies enter the market.\n\nOur current and potential competitors include:\n\n* independent systems integrators and in-house information technology\n\ndepartments;\n\n* traditional ERP and CRM software application vendors;\n\n* software vendors in the utility, telecommunications, Internet access,\n\nfield services, home delivery and other markets;\n\n* providers of service scheduling software and components and logistics\n\nsolutions providers; and\n\n* providers of supply-chain optimization solutions for manufacturing\n\norganizations.\n\nSome of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition,\n\nlonger operating histories, larger customer bases and significantly greater\n\nfinancial, technical, marketing, public relations, sales, distribution and other\n\nresources than we do.\n\nCompetition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced\n\ngross margin and loss of market share, any of which could cause our business to\n\nsuffer. We may not be able to compete successfully, and competitive pressures\n\nmay harm our business. In addition, our market is characterized by rapid\n\ntechnological change, dynamic client needs and frequent introductions of new\n\nproducts and product enhancements, which can make existing products, including\n\nours, obsolete or unmarketable.\n\n9\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nOur future success depends in part on legal protection of our intellectual\n\nproperty. To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of the\n\nfollowing among others:\n\n* preventing access to source code and technical documentation;\n\n* copyright laws;\n\n* patent laws;\n\n* trademark laws; and\n\n* trade secret laws.\n\nWe have two patent applications pending with the Israeli Patent Office. We\n\nintend to file similar applications with United States and other international\n\npatent authorities. As we continue to develop new applications of our products,\n\nwe will consider additional patent applications. We can offer no assurance that\n\npatents will issue from any of these pending applications or, if patents do\n\nissue, that the claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our\n\ntechnology. In addition, we can offer no assurance that any patents issued to us\n\nwill not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the rights granted\n\nthereunder will adequately protect us.\n\nWe own a U.S. trademark registration for the mark AITEST, and have filed\n\napplications for registration of the marks CLICKANALYZE, CLICKPLAN,\n\nCLICKFORECAST, CLICKSCHEDULE, and CLICKFIX. In the European Union, we have\n\nrecently obtained registrations for CLICKFIX and CLICKSCHEDULE, and have pending\n\napplications for registration of CLICKANALYZE, CLICKFORECAST, and CLICKPLAN.\n\nAlthough we rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark law to protect our\n\ntechnology, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative\n\nskills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements\n\nand reliable product maintenance are more essential to establishing and\n\nmaintaining a technology leadership position. We can give no assurance that\n\nothers will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our\n\ntechnology. See \"Risks Related to Our Business\" and \"Competition\".\n\nWe generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our customers, employees\n\nand consultants and generally control access to and distribution of our\n\nsoftware, documentation and other proprietary information.\n\nOur end-user licenses are designed to prohibit unauthorized use, copying and\n\ndisclosure of our software and technology in the United States, Israel and other\n\nforeign countries. However, these provisions may be unenforceable under the laws\n\nof some jurisdictions and foreign countries. Unauthorized third parties may be\n\nable to copy some portions of our products or reverse engineer or obtain and use\n\ninformation and technology that we regard as proprietary. Third parties could\n\nalso independently develop competing technology or design around our technology.\n\nIf we are unable to successfully detect infringement and/or to enforce our\n\nrights to our technology, we may lose competitive position in the market. We\n\ncannot assure you that our means of protecting our intellectual property rights\n\nin the United States, Israel or elsewhere will be adequate or that competing\n\ncompanies will not independently develop similar technology. In addition, some\n\nof our licensed users may allow additional unauthorized users to use our\n\nsoftware, and if we do not detect such use, we could lose potential license\n\nfees.\n\nFrom time to time, we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations\n\nconcerning intellectual property. We also indemnify some of our customers\n\nagainst claims that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of\n\nothers. We believe that our products do not infringe upon the intellectual\n\nproperty rights of third parties. However, we cannot assure you that we will\n\nprevail in all future intellectual property disputes. We have not conducted an\n\nexhaustive search for existing patents and other intellectual property\n\nregistrations, and we cannot assure you that our products do not infringe any\n\nissued patents. In addition, because patent applications in the United States\n\nand Israel are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued, applications\n\nmay have been filed which would relate to our products.\n\n10\n\nSubstantial litigation regarding technology rights exists in the software\n\nindustry, and we expect that software products may be increasingly subject to\n\nthird-party infringement and ownership claims as the number of competitors in\n\nour industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different\n\nindustry segments overlap. In addition, our competitors may file or have filed\n\npatent applications, which are covering aspects of their technology that they\n\nmay claim our technology infringes. Third parties may assert infringement or\n\ncompeting ownership claims with respect to our products and technology. Any such\n\nclaims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in\n\ncostly litigation, and divert management's attention and resources or cause\n\nproduct shipment delays. In the event of an adverse ruling in any such\n\nlitigation, we might be required to pay substantial damages, discontinue the use\n\nand sale of infringing products, expand significant resources to develop\n\nnon-infringing technology or obtain licenses to or pay royalties to use a third\n\nparty's technology. Such royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on\n\nterms acceptable to us, if at all. A successful claim of patent or copyright\n\ninfringement against us could significantly harm our business.\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nAs of December 31, 2001, we had 157 full-time employees, 41 engaged in research\n\nand development, 51 in sales, marketing and business development, 37 in\n\nprofessional services and technical support and 28 in finance, administration\n\nand operations. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We\n\nconsider our relations with our employees to be good.\n\n80 of our employees are located in Israel. Israeli law and certain provisions of\n\nthe nationwide collective bargaining agreements between the Histadrut (General\n\nFederation of Labor in Israel) and the Coordinating Bureau of Economic\n\nOrganizations (the Israeli federation of employers' organizations) apply to our\n\nIsraeli employees. These provisions principally concern the maximum length of\n\nthe work day and the work week, minimum wages, paid annual vacation,\n\ncontributions to a pension fund, insurance for work-related accidents,\n\nprocedures for dismissing employees, determination of severance pay and other\n\nconditions of employment. We provide our employees with benefits and working\n\nconditions above the required minimums. Furthermore, pursuant to such\n\nprovisions, the wages of most of our employees are subject to cost of living\n\nadjustments, based on changes in the Israeli CPI. The amounts and frequency of\n\nsuch adjustments are modified from time to time. Israeli law generally requires\n\nthe payment of severance pay upon the retirement or death of an employee or upon\n\ntermination of employment by the employer or, in certain circumstances, by the\n\nemployee. We currently fund our ongoing severance obligations for our Israeli\n\nemployees by making monthly payments for insurance policies and severance funds.\n\nSeverance pay expenses amounted to $202,000 in 1999, $562,000 in 2000, and\n\n$266,000 in the year 2001.\n\nIsraeli law provides that employment arrangements with employees not in senior\n\nmanagerial positions, or whose working conditions and circumstances do not\n\nfacilitate employer supervision of their hours of work, must provide for\n\ncompensation which differentiates between compensation paid to employees for a\n\n43 hour work week or for maximum daily work hours and compensation for overtime\n\nwork. The maximum number of hours of overtime is limited by law. Certain of our\n\nemployment compensation arrangements are fixed and do not differentiate between\n\ncompensation for regular hours and overtime work. Therefore, we may face\n\npotential claims from these employees asserting that the fixed salaries do not\n\ncompensate for overtime work; however, we do not believe that these claims would\n\nhave a material adverse effect on us.\n\n11\n\nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS\n\nOur executive officers and directors and certain information about them as of\n\nMarch 15, 2002 are as follows:\n\nName Age Position\n\n- ----- --- ----------\n\nDr. Moshe BenBassat 54 Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board\n\nShimon M.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\n\nOF OPERATIONS\n\nExcept for historical information, the discussion in this report contains\n\nforward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These\n\nforward-looking statements include, among others, those statements including the\n\nwords, \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"believes\" and similar language. Our\n\nactual results could differ materially from those discussed herein. Factors that\n\ncould cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to\n\nthe risks discussed in the section titled \"Risk Factors\" in this document.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nPrior to 1996, our operations were primarily related to consulting and custom\n\nsoftware solutions. In late 1996, we engaged in a comprehensive reexamination of\n\nour strategy and changed our strategic focus to concentrate on providing service\n\noptimization software products based on our W-6 Service Scheduler and TechMate\n\ntechnologies. This change in focus was intended to allow us to license software\n\nproducts useable by multiple clients, rather than developing customized software\n\nfor each client. In connection with this change of strategy, we de-emphasized\n\nour consulting business. At that time we also spun off our textile software\n\noperations to our then existing shareholders and discontinued our defense\n\napplication business. Since early 1997, we have invested significant resources\n\nin developing products based on our W-6 Service Scheduler and TechMate\n\ntechnologies, including increasing the number of our employees involved in\n\nresearch and development, sales and marketing, and professional services.\n\nWe believe that in today's economy successful businesses must constantly\n\nincrease the performance of existing service resources. Our products emphasize\n\nthe use of optimization tools for performance enhancement in the service\n\nenvironment and also offer the ability to capture the benefits and efficiencies\n\nof the internet. Accordingly, in September 1999, we began marketing our product\n\nlines under new names, CLICKSCHEDULE and CLICKFIX and in May 2000, we changed\n\nour company name to ClickSoftware Technologies Ltd.\n\nWe derive revenues from software licensing and service and maintenance fees. Our\n\noperating history shows that a significant percentage of our quarterly revenues\n\ncome from orders placed toward the end of a quarter. Software license revenues\n\nare comprised of perpetual or annual software license fees primarily derived\n\nfrom contracts with our direct sales clients and our indirect distribution\n\nchannels. We recognize revenues in accordance with the American Institute of\n\nCertified Public Accountants Statement of Position 97-2, \"Software Revenue\n\nRecognition,\" or SOP 97-2, as amended by Statement of Position 98-4. Under SOP\n\n97-2, we recognize software license revenues when a software license agreement\n\nhas been executed or a definitive purchase order has been received and the\n\nproduct has been delivered to our clients, no significant obligations with\n\nregard to implementation remain, the fee is fixed and determinable, and\n\ncollectability is probable.\n\nService and maintenance revenues are comprised of revenues from implementation,\n\nconsulting, training, release updates and customer service support fees.\n\nConsulting services are billed at an agreed-upon rate plus incurred expenses.\n\nClients licensing our products generally purchase consulting agreements from us.\n\nConsulting revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the\n\nagreement. Customer support is charged as a percentage of license fees depending\n\nupon the level of support coverage requested by the customer. A fee of 18% of\n\nlicense fees is typically charged for five day a week, eight hour coverage and\n\n24% of license fees is typically charged for seven day a week, twenty-four hour\n\ncoverage. Our products are marketed worldwide through a combination of a direct\n\nsales force, consultants and various business relationships we have with\n\nimplementation and technology companies and resellers.\n\nCost of revenues consists of cost of software license revenues and cost of\n\nservice and maintenance revenues. Cost of software license revenues consists of\n\nexpenses related to media duplication and packaging of our products and costs of\n\nsoftware purchased or licensed for resale. Cost of service and maintenance\n\nrevenues consists of expenses related to salaries and expenses of our\n\nprofessional services organizations, costs related to third-party consultants,\n\nand equipment costs.\n\n17\n\nOperating expenses are categorized into research and development expenses, sales\n\nand marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, and share based\n\ncompensation.\n\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to\n\nsupport product development, net of grants received from the Chief Scientist. In\n\nreturn for some of these grants, we are obligated to pay the Israeli Government\n\nroyalties as described below which are included in sales and marketing expenses.\n\nSoftware research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of\n\ntechnology feasibility are included in research and development expenses as\n\nincurred.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related\n\ncosts for corporate functions, including information services, finance,\n\naccounting, human resources, facilities, legal and costs related to activity as\n\npublic company.\n\nShare based compensation represents the aggregate difference, at the date of\n\ngrant, between the respective exercise price of stock options and the deemed\n\nfair market value of the underlying stock. Share based compensation is amortized\n\nover the vesting period of the underlying options, generally four years.\n\nInterest and other income (expenses) include interest income earned on our cash,\n\ncash equivalents and short-term investments, offset by interest expense, and\n\nalso includes the effects of foreign currency translations.\n\nThe functional currency of our operations is the U.S. dollar, which is the\n\nprimary currency in the economic environment in which we conduct our business. A\n\nsignificant portion of our research and development expenses is incurred in New\n\nIsraeli Shekels (\"NIS\") and a portion of our revenues and expenses are incurred\n\nin British Pounds and the European Community Euro. The results of our operations\n\nare subject to fluctuations in these exchange rates which are influenced by\n\nvarious global economic factors.\n\nThe effects of foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations for\n\nthe years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 were immaterial.\n\nOur tax rate will mainly reflect a mix of the U.S. statutory tax rate on our\n\nU.S. income, the U.K statutory tax rate on our U.K income, the Belgium statutory\n\ntax rate on our Belgium income and the Israeli tax rate discussed below. Israeli\n\ncompanies are generally subject to income tax at the rate of 36% of taxable\n\nincome. The majority of our income, however, is derived from our company's\n\ncapital investment program with \"Approved Enterprise\" status under the Law for\n\nthe Encouragement of Capital Investments, and is eligible therefore for tax\n\nbenefits. As a result of these benefits, we will have a tax exemption on income\n\nderived during the first two years in which this investment program produces\n\ntaxable income, and a reduced tax rate of 15-25% for the next 5 to 8 years. In\n\nthe event of a distribution of a cash dividend out of retained earnings that\n\nwere exempt from tax due to its Approved Enterprise status, we would be required\n\nto pay 25% corporate income tax on income from which the dividend was\n\ndistributed. All of these tax benefits are subject to various conditions and\n\nrestrictions. There can be no assurance that we will obtain approval for\n\nadditional Approved Enterprise Programs, or that the provisions of the law will\n\nnot change.\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe Company's critical accounting policies, including the assumptions and\n\njudgments underlying them, are disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated\n\nFinancial Statements. These policies have been consistently applied in all\n\nmaterial respects and address such matters as revenue recognition, including\n\nassessing clients' credit worthiness. While the estimates and judgments\n\nassociated with the application of these policies may be affected by different\n\nassumptions or conditions, the Company believes the estimates and judgments\n\nassociated with the reported amounts are appropriate in the circumstances.\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nFISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, 2000, AND 1999\n\nREVENUES. Revenues increased $2.5 million or 16% to $18.2 million in 2001, from\n\n$15.7 million in 2000. In 2000, revenues increased $5.4 million or 52% to $15.7\n\nmillion from $10.3 million in 1999. In 2001, 44% of our revenues were generated\n\nin North America, 37% in Europe, 2% in Israel and 17% in all other geographic\n\n18\n\nlocations (\"Asia Pacific and Africa\"). In 2000, 62% of our revenues were\n\ngenerated in North America, 32% in Europe, 3% in Israel and 3% in Asia Pacific\n\nand Africa. In 1999, 67% of our revenues were generated in North America, 21% in\n\nEurope, 9% in Israel and 3% in Asia Pacific and Africa. The increase in\n\npercentage of revenues from Europe and the Asia Pacific region is largely\n\nattributable to an increase in sales by our European subsidiary to customers in\n\nEurope as well as expansion of our sales effort in Europe and the Asian Pacific\n\nregion.\n\nSOFTWARE LICENSE. Software license revenues were $11.7 million or 64% of\n\nrevenues in 2001, $10.5 million or 67% of revenues in 2000, and $5.4 million or\n\n52% of revenues in 1999. The increase in software license revenues was due to\n\nincreased average sales per client, growth of our client base, and recurring\n\nsales to our installed base of clients. The variability in software license\n\nrevenues as a percentage of total revenues was due to the fact that while many\n\nof our implementations require higher initial service and maintenance, our\n\naverage deal size also increased, and these factors changed independently of\n\neach other.\n\nSERVICE AND MAINTENANCE. Service and maintenance revenues were $6.5 million or\n\n36% of revenues in 2001, $5.2 million or 33% of revenues in 2000, and $4.9\n\nmillion or 48% of revenues in 1999. The increase in service and maintenance\n\nrevenues from 2000 to 2001 is primarily due to the increase in the sale of\n\nsoftware licenses. The relatively small increase in service and maintenance\n\nrevenues from 1999 to 2000 was primarily due to an increase in license\n\ndistribution through third parties also providing implementation, and the\n\nrelease of CLICKSCHEDULE FAST TRACK which offers a more rapid implementation of\n\nCLICKSCHEDULE reducing the cost of implementation.\n\nCOST OF REVENUES. Cost of revenues were $5.8 million or 32% of revenues in 2001,\n\n$5.4 million or 35% of revenues in 2000, and $4.4 million or 42% of revenues in\n\n1999. This increase in the cost of revenues on an absolute basis was due to an\n\nincreased number of clients which resulted in an increased demand for our\n\nprofessional services. Gross profit was 68% in 2001 as compared to 66% in 2000\n\nand 58% in 1999. The change in gross profit percentages are primarily due to\n\nboth an increase in high margin software license revenues, as well as the\n\nimproved productivity of our professional services personnel.\n\nCOST OF SOFTWARE LICENSES. Cost of software license revenues were $352,000 in\n\n2001, $272,000 in 2000 and $71,000 in 1999. Cost of software license revenues\n\nwere less than 2% of revenues in 2001 and 2000 and less than 1% of revenues in\n\n1999.\n\nCOST OF SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE. Cost of service and maintenance revenues were\n\n$5.4 million or 30% of revenues in 2001, $5.2 million or 33% of revenues in\n\n2000, and $4.3 million or 42% of revenues in 1999. Cost of service and\n\nmaintenance increased by 5% from 2000 to 2001 while service and maintenance\n\nrevenues increased by 25% during the same period. This is directly attributed to\n\nthe increased service and maintenance productivity and the release of\n\nCLICKSCHEDULE FAST TRACK which offers a more rapid implementation of\n\nCLICKSCHEDULE reducing the cost of implementation. The increase in the cost of\n\nservice and maintenance revenues from 1999 to 2000 was due primarily to an\n\nincrease in the sale of licenses, which resulted in an increase of $0.1 million\n\nin personnel related costs, an increase of $0.6 million in third party related\n\ncosts and an increase of $0.2 million in other expenses. The total number of\n\nprofessional services employees employed by us was 37 on December 31, 2001, 44\n\non December 31, 2000, and 35 on December 31, 1999.\n\nOPERATING EXPENSES. Total operating expenses were $22.2 million or 122% of\n\nrevenues in 2001, $24.0 million or 153% of revenues in 2000, and $13.7 million\n\nor 132% of revenues in 1999.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, NET. Research and development expenses, net\n\nof related grants, were $3.2 million or 18% of revenues in 2001, $4.3 million or\n\n27% of revenues in 2000, and $2.9 million or 28% of revenues in 1999. We\n\nreceived or accrued grants from the Chief Scientist in the amount of $1.2\n\nmillion in 2001, $1.1 million in 2000, and $1.0 million in 1999. The decrease in\n\nresearch and development expenses from 2000 to 2001 is directly attributed to\n\nthe high costs associated with the introduction of the full optimization suite\n\nin 2000. The increase in research and development expenses on an absolute basis\n\nfrom 1999 to 2000 was primarily due to an increase of personnel related costs\n\nrelated to improvements of our CLICKSCHEDULE and CLICKFIX product lines and\n\n19\n\ndevelopment of CLICKPLAN and CLICKANALYZE as part of our introduction of a\n\ncomplete suite of service optimization management products.\n\nSALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES. Sales and marketing expenses were $ 13.4 million\n\nor 74% of revenues in 2001, $14.1 million or 90% of revenues in 2000, and $8.3\n\nmillion or 80% of revenues in 1999. The decrease in 2001 is attributed primarily\n\nto cost reductions in our North American operations and overall cost controls.\n\nPersonnel related costs decreased $0.5 million, and other expenses decreased\n\n$0.2 million from 2000 to 2001. The increase in 2000 was primarily due to\n\nadditional sales and marketing efforts related to the new marketing focus for\n\nour ClickSoftware product line and the expansion of our sales and marketing\n\nefforts worldwide during 2000. Personnel related costs increased $3.3 million\n\nfrom 1999 to 2000 and other expenses increased $2.6 million. We expect that\n\nsales and marketing expenses will increase on an absolute basis in future\n\nperiods, as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel, continue to\n\npromote our brand and establish sales in additional geographic areas. The total\n\nnumber of sales and marketing employees employed by us was 51 on December 31,\n\n2001, 71 on December 31, 2000, and 44 on December 31, 1999.\n\nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. General and administrative expenses were\n\n$4.9 million or 27% of revenues in 2001, $4.4 million or 28% of revenues in\n\n2000, and $1.8 million or 17% of revenues in 1999. General and administrative\n\nexpenses included $2.0 million in bad debt charges in 2001, $1.1 million in\n\n2000, and $0.1 million in 1999. We expect that the absolute dollar amount of\n\ngeneral and administrative expenses exclusive of bad debt charges will continue\n\nto increase as we expand our operations.\n\nSHARE BASED COMPENSATION. Share based compensation for the year ended December\n\n31, 2001 amounted to $0.4 million. Deferred compensation as of December 31, 2001\n\namounted to $0.4 million which will be amortized over the period during which\n\nthe options vest, generally four years. Share based compensation for the year\n\nended December 31, 2000 amounted to $1.2 million. Deferred compensation at\n\nDecember 31, 2000 amounted to $1.1 million. Share based compensation for the\n\nyear ended December 31, 1999 amounted to $0.7 million. Deferred compensation as\n\nof December 31, 1999 amounted to $2.7 million.\n\nREORGANIZATION COSTS. Reorganization costs were $0.3 million or 2% of revenues\n\nin 2001. These expenses were primarily costs associated with severance payments\n\nto terminated employees. There were no reorganization costs in 2000 and 1999.\n\nINTEREST AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSES), NET. Interest income net of interest\n\nexpenses, were $0.6 million or 4% of revenues in 2001, $0.7 million or 4% of\n\nrevenues in 2000, and ($0.3) million or 2% of revenues in 1999.\n\nINCOME TAXES. As of December 31, 2001, we had approximately $12.9 million of\n\nIsraeli net operating loss carryforwards, approximately $23.9 million of U.S.\n\nfederal net operating loss carryforwards and approximately $5.7 million of\n\nBritish net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable\n\nincome. The Israeli and British net operating loss carryforwards have no\n\nexpiration date. The U.S. net operating loss carryforwards will expire in\n\nvarious amounts in the years 2008 through 2014.\n\nPREFERRED SHARE DIVIDEND. During the quarter ended December 31, 1999, we\n\nrecorded a preferred share dividend of approximately $5.0 million representing\n\nthe value of the beneficial conversion feature on the issuance of convertible\n\npreferred shares in December 1999. The beneficial conversion feature was\n\ncalculated at the commitment date based on the difference between the conversion\n\nprice of $6.277 per share and the estimated fair value of the ordinary shares at\n\nthat date.\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nAs of December 31, 2001 we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.1 million and\n\nshort- term investments of $1.9 million.\n\nFrom inception through our IPO on June 22, 2000, we financed our operations\n\nprimarily through the private placement of equity securities which through\n\nDecember 31, 1999 totaled approximately $32.0 million, net of issuance costs.\n\nOur initial public stock offering of ordinary shares realized $28.3 million, net\n\nof underwriter discount and other issuance costs.\n\n20\n\nNet cash used in operating activities for each of these years primarily\n\nconsisted of net losses in addition to increases in trade receivables and\n\nprepaid expenses, partially offset by increases in accounts payable, accrued\n\nliabilities, amortization of deferred compensation, non-cash compensation\n\nexpenses, depreciation and amortization, as applicable. For the year ended\n\nDecember 31, 2001, cash used in operations was $10.5 million, comprised of our\n\nnet loss of $9.1 million, an increase in trade receivables of $2.2 million,\n\nincrease in other receivables of $0.2 million, decrease in accounts payable of\n\n$0.5 million, decrease in deferred revenue of $0.1 million, partially offset by\n\nnon-cash charges of $1.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2000, cash\n\nused in operations was $13.0 million, comprised of our net loss of $13.0\n\nmillion, an increase in trade receivables of $0.4 million, increase in other\n\nreceivables of $1.0 million, increase in accounts payable of $0.5 million,\n\ndecrease in deferred revenue of $1 million, partially offset by non-cash charges\n\nof $1.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 1999, cash used in operations\n\nwas $6.5 million, comprised of our net loss of $8.0 million, an increase in\n\ntrade receivables of $1.9 million, increase in accounts payable of $1.1 million,\n\nincrease in deferred revenue of $1 million, partially offset by non-cash charges\n\nof $1.3 million\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $14.0 million in 2001, of which\n\n$14.6 million was provided by investment in short-term investments and $0.6\n\nmillion invested primarily in leasehold improvements and purchases of equipment\n\nand systems, including computer equipment and fixtures and furniture. Net cash\n\nused in investing activities was $19.5 million in 2000, of which $16.6 million\n\nwas used to invest in short term investments and $2.9 million invested primarily\n\nin leasehold improvements and purchases of equipment and systems, including\n\ncomputer equipment and fixtures and furniture. Net cash used in investing\n\nactivities for 1999 was $0.7 million, which was primarily invested in leasehold\n\nimprovements and purchases of equipment and systems, including computer\n\nequipment and fixtures and furniture.\n\nThere were no material financing activities in 2001. Net cash provided by\n\nfinancing activities was $29.1 million in 2000 and $11.3 million in 1999. In\n\nJune 2000, we completed an initial public offering of 4,000,000 ordinary shares\n\nat a price of $7.00 per share. In July 2000, the Underwriters exercised their\n\noverallotment option and purchased 600,000 additional ordinary shares at a price\n\nof $7.00 per share. The proceeds to us from the offering were approximately\n\n$28.3 million (net of underwriters discount and issuance expenses). Net cash\n\nfrom financing activities during 1999 included proceeds from the issuance of\n\npreferred shares of $11.4 million.\n\nAs of December 31, 2001 we had outstanding trade receivables of approximately\n\n$6.6 million which represented approximately 36% of 2001 total revenues. As of\n\nDecember 31, 2000 we had outstanding trade receivables of approximately $4.4\n\nmillion which represented approximately 28% of 2000 total revenues. As of\n\nDecember 31, 1999, we had outstanding trade receivables of approximately $4.0\n\nmillion which represented approximately 38% of 1999 total revenues. Our trade\n\nreceivables typically have 30 to 60 day terms; although we also negotiate longer\n\npayment plans with some of our clients.\n\nSince inception, we have received aggregate payments from the Government of the\n\nState of Israel in the amount of $5.4 million related to research and\n\ndevelopment. As of December 31, 2001, we have paid or accrued royalties related\n\nto these funds in the amount of $1.9 million. See Note 12 to our Consolidated\n\nFinancial Statements.\n\nWe have a $1.0 million unsecured line of credit with an Israeli bank. No amounts\n\nwere outstanding under this line of credit as of December 31, 2001.\n\nWe also have an aggregate of $161,000 in term loans relating to borrowings for\n\nworking capital. We have a loan in US Dollars bearing an interest rate of LIBOR\n\nplus 1% and a loan in New Israeli Shekels linked to the Israeli CPI, currently\n\nbearing an interest rate of 5.4%. Additional loans bearing an average interest\n\nrate of 5.5% are in British Pounds or in US Dollars.\n\nOur bank in Israel has issued two standby letters of credit on our behalf. One\n\nis for $125,000 for tenant improvements related to our facilities in Israel. The\n\nother is for $921,000 and secures our performance pursuant to projects with the\n\nGovernment of Israel. Additionally, Silicon Valley Bank has issued a letter of\n\ncredit on our behalf in the amount of $205,560 to assure performance under the\n\nterms of our Campbell, CA lease.\n\n21\n\nOur capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance\n\nof our products, the resources we devote to developing, marketing, selling and\n\nsupporting our products, the timing and extent of establishing additional\n\ninternational operations and other factors. We intend to continue investing\n\nsignificant resources in our sales and marketing and research and development\n\noperations in the future. We believe that our current cash balances will be\n\nsufficient to fund our expenses until we reach profitability. However, we cannot\n\nassure you that we will attain sufficient revenues to achieve or maintain\n\nprofitability, particularly given current economic conditions and potential\n\nreductions in information technology spending by our current and prospective\n\ncustomers. We may need to raise additional capital to finance our operations or\n\nfor strategic purposes, and we may do so by selling additional equity or debt\n\nsecurities or by increasing the size of our credit facility. If additional funds\n\nare raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities, these securities\n\ncould have rights; preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of\n\nordinary shares, and the terms of these securities could impose restrictions on\n\nour operations. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities\n\ncould result in additional dilution to our shareholders. In addition, we cannot\n\nbe certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms\n\nacceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain this additional\n\nfinancing, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product\n\ndevelopment and marketing efforts, which could harm our business, financial\n\ncondition or operating results.\n\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nIn July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of\n\nFinancial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, \"Business Combinations\", and SFAS\n\nNo. 142, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\". The new rules require business\n\ncombinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the\n\npurchase method of accounting and goodwill acquired after this date will no\n\nlonger be amortized, but will be subject to annual impairment tests. All other\n\nintangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful\n\nlives. Companies are required to adopt SFAS No. 142 for fiscal years beginning\n\nafter December 15, 2001. We did not complete any business combinations through\n\nthe year ended December 31, 2001, and as a result these standards are not\n\nexpected to have a material impact on our financial position or operating\n\nresults.\n\nIn August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued\n\nStatement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the\n\nImpairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (\"SFAS 144\"). Although SFAS 144\n\nsupersedes FASB Statement No. 121, it retains the requirements of SFAS 121\n\nregarding recognition of impairment loss for long-lived assets to be held and\n\nused (based on undiscounted cash flows) and resolves certain implementation\n\nissues. Also, the accounting model used in SFAS 121 for long-lived assets to be\n\ndisposed of by sale (lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell)\n\nis broadened by SFAS 144 to include discontinued operations and supersedes APB\n\nOpinion No. 30. Therefore, discontinued operations will no longer be measured on\n\na net realizable value basis and future operating losses will no longer be\n\nrecognized before they occur. SFAS 144 also broadens the presentation of\n\ndiscontinued operations to include a component of an entity (rather than a\n\nsegment of a business). The provisions of SFAS 144 are effective for financial\n\nstatements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and\n\ninterim periods within those years. We believe that the adoption of SFAS 144\n\nwill not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nFACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS\n\nYou should carefully consider the following factors and other information in\n\nthis statement before you decide to invest in our ordinary shares. If any of the\n\nnegative events referred to below occur, our business, financial condition and\n\nresults of operations could suffer. In any such case, the trading price of our\n\nordinary shares could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\n\n22\n\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\n\nTHE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR CURRENT PRODUCTS\n\nAND THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Current predictions for the general\n\neconomy indicate uncertain economic conditions. Weak economic conditions may\n\ncause a reduction in information technology spending generally. Consequently,\n\nthere may be an adverse impact on the demand for our products, which would\n\nadversely affect our results of operations. In addition, predictions regarding\n\neconomic conditions have a low degree of certainty, and further predicting the\n\neffects of the changing economy is even more difficult. We may not accurately\n\ngauge the effect of the general economy on our business. As a result, we may not\n\nreact to such changing conditions in a timely manner that may result in an\n\nadverse impact on our results of operations. Any such adverse impacts to our\n\nresults of operations from a changing economy may cause the price of our\n\nordinary shares to decline.\n\nWE HAVE NOT ACHIEVED PROFITABILITY. We expect to continue to incur significant\n\nsales and marketing and research and development expenses. Some of our expenses,\n\nsuch as administrative and management payroll and rent and utilities, are fixed\n\nin the short term and cannot be quickly reduced to respond to decreases in\n\nrevenues. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve\n\nand maintain profitability, which we may not be able to do.\n\nOUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS AND IF WE FAIL TO\n\nMEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF SECURITIES ANALYSTS OR INVESTORS, OUR SHARE PRICE MAY\n\nDECREASE. Our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and are not a\n\ngood measure for comparison. Our operating history shows that a significant\n\npercentage of our quarterly revenues come from orders placed toward the end of a\n\nquarter. From time to time, we anticipate a sale of significant size to a single\n\ncustomer. A delay in the completion of any sale past the end of a particular\n\nquarter could negatively impact results for that quarter, and such negative\n\nimpact could be significant for the delay of a sale of significant size. Even\n\nwithout the delay of a significant sale, our future quarterly operating results\n\nmay fluctuate significantly and may not meet the expectations of securities\n\nanalysts or investors. If this occurs, the price of our ordinary shares may\n\ndecrease. The factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating\n\nresults include the following:\n\n* the volume and timing of customer orders;\n\n* internal budget constraints and approval processes of our current and\n\nprospective clients;\n\n* the length and unpredictability of our sales cycle;\n\n* the mix of revenue generated by product licenses and professional\n\nservices;\n\n* the mix of revenue between domestic and foreign sources;\n\n* announcements or introductions of new products or product enhancements\n\nby us or our competitors;\n\n* changes in prices of and the adoption of different pricing strategies\n\nfor our products and those of our competitors;\n\n* timing and amount of sales and marketing expenses;\n\n* changes in our business and partner relationships;\n\n* technical difficulties or \"bugs\" affecting the operation of our\n\nsoftware;\n\n* foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\n* general economic conditions.\n\nFAILURE OF THE MARKET TO ACCEPT OUR PRODUCTS WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR\n\nPROFITABILITY. Historically, all of our operating revenue has come from sales\n\nof, and services related to, our ClickSchedule product and our ClickFix product,\n\nto clients seeking application software that enables efficient provisioning of\n\nservices in enterprise environments. During the year ended December 31, 2000, we\n\nintroduced three products that, together with our existing products, constitute\n\na suite of products that offers a more comprehensive solution to our customers.\n\nOn November 28, 2001 we released version 7.0 of our Service Optimization Suite\n\nthat utilizes dynamic load balancing architecture, which dynamically redirects\n\nrequests among a group of ClickSoftware servers running our product\n\napplications. This increases the scalability of our products by enabling our\n\n23\n\ncustomers to optimize additional resources by adding hardware to this group of\n\nClickSoftware servers. The growth of our company depends in part on the\n\ndevelopment of market acceptance of these products. We have no guarantee that\n\nthe sales of these products will develop as quickly as we anticipate, or at all.\n\nLack of long-term demand for our new products would have a material adverse\n\neffect on our business and operating results.\n\nOUR SALES AND IMPLEMENTATION CYCLES DEPEND ON FACTORS OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL, WHICH\n\nMAY CAUSE QUARTERLY LICENSE AND SERVICE FEES REVENUES TO VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM\n\nPERIOD TO PERIOD. To date, our customers have taken typically from three months\n\nto nine months to evaluate our offering before making their purchase decisions.\n\nIn addition, depending on the nature and specific needs of a client, the\n\nimplementation of our products typically takes two to six months. Sales of\n\nlicenses and implementation schedules are subject to a number of risks over\n\nwhich we have little or no control, including clients' budgetary constraints,\n\nclients' internal acceptance reviews, the success and continued internal support\n\nof clients' own development efforts, the efforts of businesses with which we\n\nhave relationships, the nature, size and specific needs of a client and the\n\npossibility of cancellation of projects by clients. The uncertain outcome of our\n\nsales efforts and the length of our sales cycles could result in substantial\n\nfluctuations in license revenues. Historically, a significant portion of our\n\nsales in any given quarter occur in the last two weeks of the quarter; if sales\n\nforecasted from a specific client for a particular quarter are not realized in\n\nthat quarter, we are unlikely to be able to generate revenues from alternate\n\nsources in time to compensate for the shortfall. As a result, and due to the\n\nrelatively large size of some orders, a lost or delayed sale could have a\n\nmaterial adverse effect on our quarterly revenue and operating results.\n\nMoreover, to the extent that significant sales occur earlier than expected,\n\nrevenue and operating results for subsequent quarters could be adversely\n\naffected.\n\nFAILURE TO EXPAND OUR SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATIONS COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY\n\nTO SELL ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH WOULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO GROW\n\nOUR BUSINESS AND INCREASE REVENUES. We are expanding our direct and indirect\n\nsales operations to increase market awareness of our products and generate\n\nincreased revenues. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in these\n\nefforts. In addition to normal turnover of personnel, we are attempting to\n\nexpand our direct sales force in Asia Pacific and Africa. As of December 31,\n\n2001, we employed 51 individuals in our sales and marketing organizations.\n\nBecause 16 of these sales and marketing personnel joined us within the last\n\ntwelve months, we will be required to devote significant resources to the\n\ntraining of these new sales personnel. In addition, we might not be able to hire\n\nor retain the kind and number of sales and marketing personnel we are targeting\n\nbecause competition for qualified sales and marketing personnel in our market is\n\nintense.\n\nWE DEPEND ON KEY PERSONNEL, AND THE LOSS OF ANY KEY PERSONNEL COULD AFFECT OUR\n\nABILITY TO COMPETE AND OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT ADDITIONAL KEY PERSONNEL MAY BE\n\nIMPAIRED. We believe our future success will depend on the continued service of\n\nour executive officers and other key sales and marketing, product development\n\nand professional services personnel. Dr. Moshe BenBassat, our Chief Executive\n\nOfficer, has individually participated in and has been responsible for\n\noverseeing much of the research and development of our core technologies. At the\n\nbeginning of 2001, Mr. Shimon Rojany, our CFO, announced his plan to retire, but\n\nhas recently decided to indefinitely withdraw his retirement plans. Mr. Rojany\n\nis committed to continuing his employment with the Company. The services of Dr.\n\nBenBassat and other members of our senior management team and key personnel\n\nwould be very difficult to replace and the loss of any of these employees could\n\nharm our business significantly. We have employment agreements with, among\n\nothers, Dr. BenBassat, Mr. Rojany, and Mr. Corey Leibow, our Chief Operating\n\nOfficer. Although these agreements request sixty days notification prior to\n\ndeparture, relationships with these officers and key employees are at will. The\n\nloss of any of our key personnel could harm our ability to execute our business\n\nstrategy and compete.\n\nIF WE FAIL TO EXPAND OUR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES ORGANIZATION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE\n\nTO SERVICE ADDITIONAL CLIENTS AND INSTALL ADDITIONAL LICENSES. We cannot be\n\ncertain that we can attract or retain a sufficient number of highly qualified\n\nprofessional services personnel to meet our business needs. Clients that license\n\nour software typically engage our professional services organization to assist\n\nwith the installation and operation of our software applications. Our\n\nprofessional services organization also provides assistance to our clients\n\n24\n\nrelated to the maintenance, management and expansion of their software systems.\n\nGrowth in licenses of our software will depend in part on our ability to provide\n\nour clients with these services. In addition, we will be required to expand our\n\nprofessional services organization to enable us to continue to support our\n\nexisting installed base of customers. As a result, we plan to increase the\n\nnumber of our service personnel in order to meet these needs. Competition for\n\nqualified services personnel with the relevant knowledge and experience is\n\nintense, and we may not be able to attract and retain necessary personnel. If we\n\nwere not able to grow our professional services organization, our ability to\n\nexpand our service business would be limited. In addition, we could experience\n\ndelays in recognizing revenue if our professional services group fails to\n\ncomplete implementations in a timely manner.\n\nIF WE FAIL TO EXPAND OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIES THAT CAN PROVIDE\n\nIMPLEMENTATION AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES TO OUR CLIENTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO\n\nINCREASE OUR REVENUES AND OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED. In order for us to focus\n\nmore effectively on our core business of developing and licensing software\n\nsolutions, we need to continue to establish relationships with third parties\n\nthat can provide implementation and professional services to our clients.\n\nThird-party implementation and consulting firms can also be influential in the\n\nchoice of resource optimization applications by new clients. If we are unable to\n\nestablish and maintain effective, long-term relationships with implementation\n\nand professional services providers, or if these providers do not meet the needs\n\nor expectations of our clients, we may be unable to grow our revenues and our\n\nbusiness could suffer. As a result of the limited resources and capacities of\n\nmany third-party implementation providers, we may be unable to attain sufficient\n\nfocus and resources from the third-party providers to meet all of our clients'\n\nneeds, even if we establish relationships with these third parties. If\n\nsufficient resources are unavailable, we will be required to provide these\n\nservices internally, which could limit our ability to meet other demands. Even\n\nif we are successful in developing relationships with third-party implementation\n\nand professional services providers, we will be subject to significant risk, as\n\nwe cannot control the level and quality of service provided by third-party\n\nimplementation and professional services partners.\n\nOUR MARKET IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND ANY REDUCTION IN DEMAND FOR, OR PRICES OF,\n\nOUR PRODUCTS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES, REDUCE OUR GROSS MARGINS AND\n\nCAUSE OUR SHARE PRICE TO DECLINE. The market for our products is competitive and\n\nrapidly changing. We expect competition to increase in the future as current\n\ncompetitors expand their product offerings and new companies enter the market.\n\nBecause the market for service and delivery optimization software is evolving,\n\nit is difficult to determine what portion of the market each competitor\n\ncurrently controls. However, competition could result in price reductions, fewer\n\ncustomer orders, reduced gross margin and loss of market share, any of which\n\ncould cause our business to suffer. We may not be able to compete successfully,\n\nand competitive pressures may harm our business. Some of our current and\n\npotential competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories,\n\nlarger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing,\n\npublic relations, sales, distribution and other resources than us. In addition,\n\nsome of our potential competitors are among the largest and most well\n\ncapitalized software companies in the world.\n\nFAILURE TO FULLY DEVELOP OR MAINTAIN KEY BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS COULD LIMIT OUR\n\nABILITY TO SELL ADDITIONAL LICENSES THAT COULD DECREASE OUR REVENUES AND\n\nINCREASE OUR SALES AND MARKETING COSTS. We believe that our success in\n\npenetrating our target markets depends in part on our ability to develop and\n\nmaintain business relationships with software vendors, resellers, systems\n\nintegrators, distribution partners and customers. If we fail to continue\n\ndeveloping these relationships, our growth could be limited. We have entered\n\ninto agreements with third parties relating to the integration of our products\n\nwith their product offerings, distribution, reselling and consulting. We are\n\ncurrently deriving revenues from these agreements but we may not be able to\n\nderive significant revenues in the future from these agreements. In addition,\n\nour growth may be limited if prospective clients do not accept the solutions\n\noffered by our strategic partners.\n\n25\n\nOUR MARKET MAY EXPERIENCE RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES THAT COULD CAUSE OUR\n\nPRODUCTS TO FAIL OR REQUIRE US TO REDESIGN OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN\n\nINCREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. Our market is characterized by\n\nrapid technological change; dynamic client needs and frequent introductions of\n\nnew products and product enhancements. If we fail to anticipate or respond\n\nadequately to technology developments and client requirements, or if our product\n\ndevelopment or introduction is delayed, we may have lower revenues. Client\n\nproduct requirements can change rapidly as a result of computer hardware and\n\nsoftware innovations or changes in and the emergence, evolution and adoption of\n\nnew industry standards. For example, we offer Windows NT versions of our\n\nproducts due to the market acceptance of Windows NT over the last several years.\n\nWhile we interface smoothly with UNIX systems, we currently do not provide UNIX\n\nversions of our software. The actual or anticipated introduction of new products\n\nhas resulted and will continue to result in some reformulation of our product\n\nofferings. Technology and industry standards can make existing products obsolete\n\nor unmarketable or result in delays in the purchase of such products. As a\n\nresult, the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate. We must\n\nrespond to developments rapidly and continue to make substantial product\n\ndevelopment investments. As is customary in the software industry, we have\n\npreviously experienced delays in introducing new products and features, and we\n\nmay experience such delays in the future that could impair our revenue and\n\noperating results.\n\nOUR PRODUCTS COULD BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ERRORS OR DEFECTS THAT COULD RESULT IN LOST\n\nREVENUES, LIABILITY OR DELAYED OR LIMITED MARKET ACCEPTANCE. Complex software\n\nproducts such as ours often contain errors or defects, particularly when first\n\nintroduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. In the past, some\n\nof our products have contained errors and defects that have delayed\n\nimplementation or required us to expend additional resources to correct the\n\nproblems. Despite internal testing and testing by current and potential clients,\n\nand despite the history of use by our installed base of customers, our current\n\nand future products may contain as yet undetected serious defects or errors. Any\n\nsuch defects or errors could result in lost revenues, liability or a delay in\n\nmarket acceptance of these products, any of which would have a material adverse\n\neffect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nThe performance of our products also depends in part upon the accuracy and\n\ncontinued availability of third-party data. We rely on third parties that\n\nprovide information such as street and address locations and mapping functions\n\nthat we incorporate into our products. If these parties do not provide accurate\n\ninformation, or if we are unable to maintain our relationships with them, our\n\nreputation and competitive position in our industry could suffer and we could be\n\nunable to develop or enhance our products as required.\n\nOUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD BE USED BY THIRD PARTIES WITHOUT OUR CONSENT\n\nBECAUSE PROTECTION OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS LIMITED. Our success and\n\nability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed\n\ntechnology, which we protect through a combination of copyright, trade secret\n\nand trademark law. However, we may not be able to adequately protect our\n\nintellectual property rights, which may significantly harm our business.\n\nSpecifically, we may not be able to protect our trademarks for our company name\n\nand our product names, and unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise\n\nobtain and use our products or technology. Policing unauthorized use of our\n\nproducts and technology is difficult, particularly in countries outside the\n\nU.S., and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent\n\ninfringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.\n\nOur end-user licenses are designed to prohibit unauthorized use, copying or\n\ndisclosure of our software and technology in the United States, Israel and other\n\nforeign countries. However, these provisions may be unenforceable under the laws\n\nof some jurisdictions and foreign countries. Unauthorized third parties may be\n\nable to copy some portions of our products or reverse engineer or obtain and use\n\ninformation and technology that we regard as proprietary. Third parties could\n\nalso independently develop competing technology or design around our technology.\n\nIf we are unable to successfully detect infringement and/or to enforce our\n\nrights to our technology, we may lose competitive position in the market. We\n\ncannot assure you that our means of protecting our intellectual property rights\n\nin the United States, Israel or elsewhere will be adequate or that competing\n\n26\n\ncompanies will not independently develop similar technology. In addition, some\n\nof our licensed users may allow additional unauthorized users to use our\n\nsoftware, and if we do not detect such use, we cou"
