The urgency for the repeal of the Inheritance Tax Law of this State enacted last year is well shown by the action of other States in seeking to obtain for them­ selves some of the capital which is being expelled from New York by reason of the law referred to. Alert to the opportunities thus created, some Alabama institu­ tions, for instance, are directing attention in large ad­ vertisements to their favorable situation in that re­ gard. One especially conspicuous announcement of this type which has come to our notice the present week bears the following catch lines: “No Inheritance Taxes in Alabama. Forbidden by constitution of the State.” Such appeals reflect the energetic, enter­ prising spirit that is dominating affairs in many of the Southern States, and as the South is blessed with wonderful resources, and therefore presents unusual opportunities for the employment of capital, these appeals will no doubt prove in considerable measure effective. But what shall we say of the action of the Empire State in deliberately driving capital away for the benefit of other States. If it be granted that the 1910 Inheritance statute was passed under a misapprehension, is it not the duty of our legislators at Albany to provide for the imme­ diate repeal of that statute, now that its mischievous character is so clearly demonstrated? Governor Dix in his special message to the Legislature on March 23 gave figures to show that $100,000,000 of investment funds and securities had been withdrawn from trust and safe-deposit companies and taken to other States in the short time the law has been in force. Yet no disposition is apparent on the part of our legislators to get a “move on” and wipe this injurious law off the statute books. Nor do the few legislators who have actually taken the matter in hand show a true appre­ ciation of what is actually wanted. As the law is particularly harsh in its operation against non-resi­ dents, an impression seems to prevail that little is needed except a modification of the provisions in that respect. A moment’s consideration should convince any one that the resident also needs protection against onerous and excessive death duties; otherwise he will soon become a non-resident, taking his wealth and his belongings with him. Another erroneous notion is that it will be sufficient to scale down a little the rates of taxation imposed under the 1910 law. Senator Harte on April 17 intro­ duced a bill which was referred to the Committee on Taxation and Retrenchment and which has been hailed as furnishing a solution of the question. Ap­ parently, however, those holding this view are with­ out knowledge as to the provisions of the measure. The Harte bill is as far from the proper corrective as it well could be. Under the law of last year the State in certain cases takes 25% of the bequest on sums in excess of $1,000,000. Mr. Harte would make the tax in such cases 10% on amounts in excess of $1,000,­ 000, 12% on amounts in excess of $12,000,000 and the maximum 15% on amounts in excess of $20,000,­ 000. These are the rates to collateral heirs, and the rates in such cases are left relatively high, too, on small sums, being 6% on amounts in excess of $50,000, 7% on amounts in excess of $250,000 and 8% on amounts in excess of $500,000. Obviously this is merely paltering with the matter. A 10% or a 15% rate would be only a little less harmful [VOL. LXXXXII. and a little less effective in leading to the transfer of the possessions of wealthy citizens to other States than a 25% rate. This is not the time for temporizing. The situation is too serious and too urgent for that. What is wanted is an unconditional repeal of the 1910 law and a return to the law as it existed previous to that time, when the rate was 1% to direct heirs and 5% toothers. Nothing less than this will answer. Unless we would give other States a perpetual advantage as fields for investment and as domiciles for accumulated wealth, New York cannot demand a greater toll or tribute than is exacted elsewhere. Besides, high and excessive rates are unwise from a revenue standpoint. The State Comptroller in his last report showed very clearly that the annual yield to the State under the 1910 law is likely to prove smaller than was the yield under the previous law with its much more moderate rates. By all means, therefore, let last year’s statute be repealed, and let the work be done quickly. Senator Aldrich has again shown his ready adapta­ bility to public sentiment and to the requirements of the situation. In the outline submitted by him last January of a plan for banking and currency reform he excluded State banks and trust companies from the operation of the plan, confining it entirely to national banks, though there are only about 7,200 of these latter as against 16,000 State banks and trust companies. Not only that, but he sought to supplant State insti­ tutions altogether by arranging for the establishment of two new classes of national banks, one to be en­ dowed with savings bank functions and the other to be “in effect national trust companies.” Criticism and reflection have now induced Mr. Aldrich to change his opinion as to the feasibility of either proposition. In his speech at the banquet in this city given last Friday night under the auspices of the Trust Company Section of the American Bankers’ Association he re­ ceded from his position in these respects in a creditably frank manner. He declared that he was “satisfied that it is wholly impracticable to attempt any radical modification of the functions of national banks or the creation of any new classes of national banks for the purpose of supplanting or taking the place of institu­ tions now operating under State charters.” He also said that he was “convinced that the interests of the public and of the existing State institutions alike re­ quire that some means should be devised by which all classes should be permitted to participate upon some reasonable terms in the advantages and to share in the responsibility of ownership and management of the Association.” The method by which participation was to be provided he is not yet prepared to say. By this modification of his plan Mr. Aldrich has dem­ onstrated that he is sincerely desirous of promoting the cause of banking and currency reform. Moreover, by the change he has measurably advanced the pros­ pects of reform. He should go a step further now and define his position on the question of the cash re­ serves of the banks joining the Reserve Association. His plan is singularly vague on this point. Is it the intention that national banks and other institutions taking membership in the Reserve Association shall keep all of their cash (excepting of course enough to provide for current payments) with the central organi­ zation, thus providing that concentration of money holdings so imperative in times of disturbance and so May 13 1911.1 THE CHRONICLE essential to the best results at other times, or are the banks to be left free to hold the cash either in their own vaults or to transfer it to the care of the central body? Mr. Paul Warburg, many of whose ideas Mr. Aldrich has embodied in his scheme, argues that the central organization should keep the whole of the cash reserves for the entire country. It does not seem to us, however, that this would be altogether wise. According to our way of thinking, in a country of the magnitude of the United States, and particularly with such a vast expanse of territory, the banking situ­ ation cannot be’ deemed altogether secure unless there shall be supplementary reservoirs of money holdings to reinforce the hoards of the central insti­ tution. On the other hand, can the banks be left entirely free to exercise their own volition in the matter, as is apparently contemplated by Mr. Aldrich? If it were obligatory to transfer the whole of their cash to the central organization, we may be sure that some of the largest institutions in New York, Chicago and St. Louis would not join. Many of these have high aspirations and are anxious to maintain a position of independence. Their managers would not care to appear to be leaning upon the central association. But what would follow if they were left at liberty to hold all their cash in their own vaults, even though members of the Reserve Association? Would there not be the possibility of inviting announcements read­ ing somewhat like this: “This bank holds the whole of its reserve in the shape of cash in its own vaults,” with perhaps the further addition (after the Reserve Association had been in existence for a year or two) “and has never called upon the Reserve Association for assistance of any kind, though a subscriber to its capital stock.” The country banks would not, of course, deposit with the Reserve Association unless compelled to do so. They would deposit with the banks in the reserve cities, since in that way they would get interest on the same. The Reserve Association, very rightly, is not to pay interest of any kind on its deposits. With the banks in the reserve cities also withholding their cash from the central body, would not the latter be placed in a most curious position? Is it not, therefore, absolutely necessary that it shall be made obligatory upon all members of the association to deposit a cer­ tain definite portion of their reserve with the Reserve Association—say one-half ? In the local banking situation a decided step forward has been taken the present week towards permanent safety and security. The Clearing House has decided to admit the trust companies to membership on the terms outlined last week, namely that they shall keep a reserve of 15% represented by cash in their own vaults, as required by law, and 10% in addition in the shape of a deposit with a Clearing-House bank keeping 25% of cash of its own. Twelve trust com­ panies have already availed of the offer, including some of the largest institutions. The names are given in our column devoted to banking intelligence on subsequent pages. According to present indications, one or two ultra­ conservative companies, of which the New York Life Insurance & Trust Co. is the most conspicuous type, are not likely to apply for admission. But these 1277 belong in a class by themselves and-the banking situa­ tion will never be imperiled by their staying out. Their methods arc so thoroughly sound and the character of their business so stable that no jeopardy can result from their action or position. The other trust companies, standing apart from these, which have not yet applied for membership, will probably be ultimately forced to join, since they would otherwise incur the criticism (with a resulting loss of business) that they are afraid of the rigid investi­ gation and examination that would follow entrance into the Clearing House. Altogether, this week’s action marks an important event in local banking history. It deserves to be noted that one trust company in the city (and only one) has been enjoying the privilege of the Clearing House right along, with benefit both to itself and to its patrons. We refer, of course, to the Manhattan Trust Co. This company has been holding large reserves against its deposits, and yet has been able to pay very considerable sums in divi­ dends, besides accumulating a very extensive surplus. The Manhattan Trust has cleared through the Clear­ ing House ever since 1888, the Chase National Bank having been its clearing agent. In the whole of the 18 years from 1893 to 1910 it has held an average re­ serve of 31.8%, represented by cash in vault or on de­ posit. The company is not one of the very large in­ stitutions, but the average of its deposits the last six years has been $15,385,000, against $3,786,000 in 1893. In face of the reserve it has maintained, its surplus Feb. 28 1911 (the date of the last statement) was $2,197,000, against only $225,395 in 1893. In the interval, too, the company has paid out $1,490,000 in dividends. Obviously, therefore, in its case the maintenance of liberal reserves has not militated against satisfactory profits. Mr. Ernest Flagg, an architect who has made several quite rational suggestions of late concerning dwellings of large housing capacity which shall not sacrifice safety, now makes one concerning the still unsettled problem of the new Court-house and the movement to place that structure in City Hall Park. He pro­ poses, instead, to go southward to the old district east of Broadway, bounded on the west by State Street, on the north by Beaver Street, and on the south and west by the river and lower Wall Street. In this oldest and most picturesque section, he says, values are abnormally low, although it adjoins the financial district, where values are probably the highest to be found anywhere. Here also is the most accessible and most central part of the whole metropolis, speaking with respect to its relation^to travel lines; for here are termini of the subway, the elevated, and the principal surface lines, besides the principal ferries and the tube to Brooklyn. The specific site he proposes would have an area nearly double that of the blocks directly north of Chambers Street; it would have Battery Park near one side, and Jeannette Park near the other, with abundantjlight assured. Nobody advocates a Court-house within City Hall Park except on the argument that the city already owns the land. But, argues Mr. Flagg, the assessed valuation of the particular plot he suggests was, last year, less than 1%-millions for the land and less 1278 THE CHRONICLE [VOL. LXXXXII. than a half million for the buildings on it; at 50 per the events justify such adjectives as “epoch-making’' cent more than this, he figures that it would hardly remains to be demonstrated. The Chinese reforms equal one-fifth of the cost of the site adjoining Cham­ just announced are these: First, the abolition of the bers Street, which is proposed as one means of sparing ancient Grand Council and Grand Secretariat and the the Park.

Moreover, imports are likely to show modification. There was no wide fluctuation in sterling from beginning to end of the week. Certain habitual speculators tried to precipitate a break on Monday; they succeeded in forcing demand down to 4 8635 and cable transfers to about 4 86)4, but the weakness did not last long. Since then dealings have been on a very small scale and at steady rates, although the close yesterday was weaker. The requirements of tourists continue an important influence. Should money become easier in London, it is understood that certain international bankers here will issue a rather large amount of exchange.

Demand advanced on Wed­ nesday to 4 8645@4S650 and cable transfers to 4 8670@4 8675. On Thursday sterling was weaker on dull trading, demand declining to 4 8640@4 8645 and cable transfers to 4 8665 @4 8675; sixty days was still quoted at 4 8440@4 8450. On Friday the market was quiet and unchanged until the afternoon, when weakness developed. The close was at 4 8430 @4 8440 for 60 days, 4 8635@4 8645 for demand and 4 8660@ 4 8670 for cables.

Even the Southern roads are represented now in the list of decreases, though there are some exceptions to the rule, among which must be mentioned par­ ticularly the Seaboard Air Line, which appears to be steadily developing its business. The Great Northern heads the list for amount of loss, it having fallen behind $803,096. But it must be remembered, with reference to this system, and most others distinguished in the same way, that this year’s loss follows an even larger gain the previous year. In brief, the gain for the Great Northern last year was no less than 81,309,730. Still this latter was itself in large part a recovery of what had been lost previously, and, taking a longer view, we find that this company’s gross for April 1911, a t84,394,012,compares with $4,923,598 in April as far back as 1907. In the table we present we have brought together all the changes for the separate roads for amounts in excess of $30,000, whether in­ creases or decreases. * Includes all affiliated lines except Trinity A Brazos Valley Rlt. a Includes the Texas Central In 1911.
