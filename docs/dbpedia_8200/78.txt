Labeling pharmaceutical refers to the process of adding labels for pharmaceutical products to facilitate the identification and understanding of important information for end-users. Since the use of pharmaceuticals can significantly affect the health and well-being of consumers, it is essential the information presented on the label — particularly in regard to usage instructions, expiration dates, and ingredient lists — is clear and accurate.

Importance of Labeling in the Pharmaceutical Industry

Labeling is a critical part of pharmaceutical manufacturing, and if modern labeling systems are deployed, efficiency savings can be made without compromising on standards or regulations.

The labeling is critical to maintaining compliance. Not only does the label act as a unique identifier to prove authenticity to health care professionals, but it also ensures that active ingredients and concentrations are clearly understood. And there can’t be any margin for error as the consequences of inaccurate ingredients are too high.

Healthful Design for Pharmaceutical Label

1. Appearance of the pharmaceutical product (illustration with symbols, graphics or pictures of real products)

2. Dosage frequency [quantity/time]

3. Route of administration

4. Warning (esp. on medications targeting external use)
