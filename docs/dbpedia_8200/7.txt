Pharmaceutical labels are an important component of packaging for pharmaceutical and healthcare products. They are used on primary packaging like bottles, blister packs, syringes and vials, as well as on secondary packaging like folding cartons and on package inserts. They have a number of different tasks to perform. Doctors, pharmacists and patients rely on them for important information on correct dosage, shelf life and risks. At the point of sale, they increase the attractiveness of over-the-counter products, helping to boost sales. Equipped with batch numbers and serialised codes, they help pharmaceutical manufacturers make their processes transparent and traceable and protect their products against counterfeiting. Tamper-evident labels reliably show whether a package has been opened.
