Its manufacturing advantages such as low cost and high availability further bolster this position.\n\nThe plastics segment is forecast to experience the second-fastest growth in the market, driven by innovations aligning with sustainability goals in response to changing environmental conditions. For instance, in August 2023, the BioICEP project, or “Bio-Innovation of a Circular Economy for Plastics” used three technologies to turn non-biodegradable plastics into new biobased materials to increase, enhance, and accelerate the degradation of plastic. The technology involved a triple-action depolymerization system which includes chemical disintegration processes, biocatalytic digestion, and microbial consortia.\n\nPharmaceutical Packaging Market Share by Material, 2023 (%)\n\nBuy the Full Report for More Information on Pharmaceutical Packaging Market Material\n\nDownload a Free Report Sample\n\nThe paper & paperboard segment is projected to witness the fastest growth with a CAGR of around 7% over the estimated period. This is due to the increasing focus on using more sustainable materials in industry. Moreover, paper and paperboard materials are utilized in primary outers and transport packaging, adapting to market demands for effective labeling and wrapping of pharmaceuticals to ensure safe usage and consumption in the end-use market.\n\nThe rising trend of contract manufacturing along with the increasing import & export of pharmaceutical drugs across the globe is driving the demand for paper & paperboard material. For instance, in January 2024, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed the US state of Florida to import medications from Canada due to the lower prices compared to the US. This significant policy shift is anticipated to affect drug price dynamics in US states, thereby further supporting the growth of packaging designed for long-term safety and transport.\n\nPharmaceutical Packaging Market Segmentation by Packaging Type\n\nPrimary packaging type further categorized as blister & strip packs, aerosols, bottles & containers, and vials & ampoules among others, with bottles and containers leading in 2023.The high share of this segment is driven by its critical role in direct drug contact. Primary packaging is required to be chemical resistant; thus, extensive R&D is required during the designing and testing phase.\n\nPharmaceutical Packaging Market Share by Packaging Type, 2023 (%)\n\nBuy the Full Report for More Information on Pharmaceutical Packaging Market Packaging Type\n\nDownload a Free Report Sample\n\nThe transport packaging segment is projected to exhibit the fastest growth with a CAGR of more than over 7% during the estimated timeframe. The segmental demand is significantly dependent on the growth of import and export activities across multinational distribution channels to meet the increasing demand for pharmaceutical products, particularly in low-income and underdeveloped countries.\n\nFor instance, India’s drug and pharmaceutical products exports grew by 125% from Rs. 90,415 Crore ($10.8 billion) in 2013-14 to Rs. 2,04,110 Crore ($24.4 billion) in 2022-23, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The top five destinations are the US, South Africa, Belgium, Brazil, and the UK. The country is also one of the biggest suppliers of low-cost vaccines and generic medicine globally.\n\nPharmaceutical Packaging Market Segmentation by Distribution Channel\n\nThe prescription drugs category is experiencing growth as numerous drugs are approved annually across various therapeutic areas, with many in the development pipeline. The rising geriatric population and increasing prevalence of long-term illness and mental health issues further fuel the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nThe surge in patients with chronic diseases necessitates consistent medical support for maintaining a normal life, thereby driving the global demand for the packaging of respective drugs. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) kill 41 million people each year, equivalent to 74% of all deaths globally. In addition, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, chronic diseases cause 7 out of 10 deaths among Americans, further driving the need for packaging across various drug categories.\n\nPharmaceutical Packaging Market Share by Distribution Channel, 2023 (%)\n\nBuy the Full Report for More Information on Pharmaceutical Packaging Market Distribution Channel\n\nDownload a Free Report Sample\n\nBased on the distribution channel, the over-the-counter drugs segment is anticipated to exhibit the highest growth over the estimated period. A change in consumer behavior with the increasing understanding of OTC drugs and self-medication supports a rise in the number of switches of drugs from Rx to OTC. Further innovation in OTC products is among the factors supporting the growth of this segment.
