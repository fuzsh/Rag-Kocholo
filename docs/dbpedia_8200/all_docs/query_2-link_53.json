        "text": "In most countries, there is a regulatory body that sets the labeling standards for pharmaceutical labels. This is why pharmaceutical manufacturers rely on labeling experts like Raja Tl who understand the unique labeling requirements in different countries across the globe.\n\nThe General Labelling Requirements\n\nRegardless of which country it is, the following requirements must be fulfilled in every label for medicinal products â\n\n1. An identity statement\n\nEvery drug and medical device comes with unique information that should be shown on the product. However, to remain compliant with the set guidelines, a manufacturer must include the following information in their label â\n\nOfficial Product name\n\nBrand name and logo\n\nList of active and inactive ingredients along with their quantity in the product\n\nManufacturing license number\n\nManufacturing date and expiry date (they are usually reset daily and printed automatically)\n\nBatch number of the production\n\nContact details of the manufacturer\n\nWarnings\n\nInstructions or direction of use\n\nDosage information\n\nBarcode\n\nPharmaceutical manufacturers must keep in mind that misleading product identities will not only lead to the ban on their product but can also result in expensive legal battles.\n\n2. A list of ingredients\n\nIngredients should be listed in decreasing order of predominance from most to least on every product.\n\nMoreover for topical treatments, the strength or percentage of active ingredients in the formulation must be indicated.\n\nIt is also essential to represent the number of active ingredients in each unit of dose.\n\n3. The format of the labels\n\nInterestingly multiple studies have been done which look at the impact of design and format of labels.\n\nAnd, such studies have been instrumental in setting some standard in terms of â\n\nFont size and type\n\nAppropriate use of language to frame claims, warnings, application, and more\n\nThe use of color and design\n\nWe at, Raja Tl, are well-versed in the requirements to formatting the perfect label for your product.\n\n4. The material of the Label\n\nOne area that is not under strict scrutiny when it comes to labeling, is the type of material to be used.\n\nHowever, we still prefer to deliver the best which is usually â\n\nQuality White paper\n\nHolographic films.\n\nWe also take special care of the adhesive to be used we make sure it is âlow migrationâ meaning there will be minimum transfer of substances from the label to the drug or device.\n\n5. Sustainability\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry generates a massive volume of waste. A matter of primary and pressing concern.\n\nSo, at Raja Tl, we try to mitigate that by mindful recycling and smart labeling that makes optimum use of the raw materials available to us.\n\nSo, whatever be your labeling needs, Raja Tl will customize their labeling services to fit your unique requirements."
