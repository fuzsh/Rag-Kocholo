        "text": "The next obvious innovation in pharmaceutical packaging would likely be plastics, but plastics were not an overnight success for packaging services. Plastics were expensive to produce and awkward to use. It took some time for the industrial processes to catch up and make plastic less costly to produce and more flexible for daily use. Once they overcame those hurdles, plastic became the most popular option in pharmaceutical packaging. Today, plastic bottles and other packaging are everywhere in the pharmaceutical field.\n\nThe revolutionary, yet simple innovation of blister packaging was that it offered a way for physicians and pharmacists to control and monitor dosage in a more straightforward way than ever before. Blister packs dramatically reduce the chance of dispensing errors when an exact number of pre-packaged tablets can be handed to the patient.\n\nThe rise of popularity for blister packaging primarily owes itself to the increased distribution of the oral contraceptive pill for women in the â€˜60s. The design of the blister pack made it easy for them to track their dosage and keep up with their intake.\n\nBlister packs also offer a foolproof way for patients to track their intake and how much longer their course of treatment will be. These packs offer impressive durability and cost-effective production costs. Blister packaging provides clear evidence of any tampering if a seal is broken or a tablet is missing from the pack. This increases safety for the patient and compliance for the manufacturer."
