        "text": "Pharmaceutical Labeling, Advertising and Promotions Certificate\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Labeling, Advertising and Promotions Certificate in the School of Pharmacy at Temple University focuses specifically on the complex regulations associated with federal and global regulations governing labeling, advertising and promotions. This certificate is part of the school’s regulatory affairs (RA) and quality assurance (QA) graduate program program and is available online. A master’s degree is not required to earn this certificate.\n\nWhat is pharmaceutical labeling?\n\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, labeling is more than the prescription label or a cardboard container enclosing prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) products. Labeling is also the prescribing information (PI), which is a detailed and complicated product reference sheet included with prescription or OTC products. In the U.S., each PI is governed by the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, part 200, which stipulates that every aspect of the product be delineated in writing. This includes the following.\n\nA description of the drug dosage form and its physical properties\n\nA listing of active ingredients and excipients\n\nThe molecular structure of each compound\n\nThe pharmacokinetics and toxicology of the drug\n\nThe intended patient population\n\nPotential side effects and safety concerns\n\nUnique storage requirements\n\nThe PI must accompany any print ads about prescription drugs that appear in journals and magazines. Attached to each advertisement, the PI must be uniquely coded, since the company is required to keep accurate records of where the ad appeared.\n\nWhy study pharmaceutical labeling and advertising in the RAQA graduate program at Temple?\n\nFederal regulations also govern how prescription products can be advertised. Each year, pharmaceutical companies spend billions nationally on direct-to-consumer TV ads, which have made many products household names. The complexity of creating these ad campaigns while complying with federal regulations continues to be a challenging task that combines industry knowledge, regulatory expertise and marketing. Advertising companies alone cannot create the ads; regulatory professionals must be included. In addition to direct-to-consumer advertising, websites about pharmaceutical products have grown exponentially, particularly those that focus exclusively on one product, serving as a “patient reference page.” In some cases, innovator companies even sell products directly to consumers from websites.\n\nCountries often have unique regulatory requirements for labeling and advertising. For instance, some require pharmaceutical labels to display the price of a product the day it was granted approval by the governing regulatory authority. In other cases, product cartons must be designed to clearly display that pricing.\n\nAs the types and global reach of product advertising continue to expand—thereby crossing the boundaries of regulatory authorities and patient populations—the need for more global regulatory oversight of the labeling process is increasing. Recruiters from placement firms frequently call Temple’s RA and QA office, seeking candidates with a demonstrated knowledge of the regulations governing advertising and labeling.\n\nThe Certificate in Pharmaceutical Labeling, Advertising and Promotions provides students with credentials from Temple’s well respected RA and QA graduate program, giving them a solid grounding in the key federal and global regulations that affect the advertising and labeling of pharmaceutical products. The certificate is open to both MS applicants and MS graduates, who can expand their career opportunities with this new credential.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nUpon completion of the Labeling, Advertising and Promotions Certificate, students will be able to\n\nunderstand U.S. and global regulatory and industry requirements for creating, updating or maintaining product labeling;\n\nexplain the nature of the pharmaceutical marketplace and the roles of Congress, the courts and the Food and Drug Administration in labeling, advertising and promotional efforts;\n\nevaluate specific advertising and promotion communications for regulatory compliance; and\n\nidentify the latest trends and issues posed by internet advertisements and product websites.\n\nPost-master’s Certificate\n\nStudents have the option to complete a post-master’s curriculum in pharmaceutical labeling, advertising and promotions. To apply for this 12-credit program, applicants must hold a master’s degree in a pharmacy-related field and a bachelor of science degree in biochemistry, biology, chemistry, physics or a health-related discipline. Additionally, applicants who did not earn their master’s degree from Temple University’s School of Pharmacy must have sufficient industry experience and familiarity with the basic tenets of regulatory affairs and quality assurance to pursue the post-master’s certificate.\n\nLearn more about the Post-master’s Graduate Certificate in Pharmaceutical Labeling, Advertising and Promotions.\n\nProgram Format & Curriculum\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Labeling, Advertising and Promotions Certificate may be earned on its own or on the way to the MS in RA and QA.\n\nTo earn the certificate, the following four courses must be completed within a three-year period with an overall B (3.0) average.\n\nFood and Drug Law (5592)\n\nRequirements for Product Labeling and Advertising (5533)\n\nGlobal Labeling Regulation: Principles and Practices (5532)\n\nRegulation of Advertising and Labeling (5611)\n\nStudents should take Food and Drug Law before pursuing other courses in the certificate. It is suggested that Requirements in Product Labeling and Advertising be completed next. The remaining courses may be taken in any order.\n\nAll courses must be completed from Temple University’s RA and QA graduate program. No transfer credits from other institutions are accepted. If a student has completed an identical course at an accredited U.S. graduate school, the student may petition the RA and QA program to waive that course and take another approved elective in its place. This request must be made in writing and approved before the student pursues the certificate.\n\nLearn more about the Pharmaceutical Labeling, Advertising and Promotions Certificate.\n\nSee the curriculum.\n\nRequirements\n\nCandidates must formally apply after completing courses, and follow the application procedures (application form, photocopies of transcripts and Notice of Completion).\n\nOnly one certificate program may be completed before students receive the MS.\n\nThe certificate must be completed within three years. Students must apply for the certificate no more than one year after completing the course requirements.\n\nStudents interested in pursuing the RA and QA MS degree may apply all credits earned in the Pharmaceutical Labeling, Advertising and Promotions Certificate toward their graduate degree, provided they formally apply for admission to the MS program and are accepted by Temple University’s graduate school.\n\nLearn more about the application process.\n\nRelated Graduate Degrees\n\nRegulatory Affairs and Quality Assurance MS"
