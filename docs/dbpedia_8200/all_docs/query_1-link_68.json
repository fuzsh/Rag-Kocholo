        "text": "Packaging errors or mislabelling of pharmaceutical products may result in increased efforts in recertification or recalls that can potentially cost millions of dollars to the manufacturers.\n\nThe complexities stemming from continuously evolving global regulatory standards require manufacturers to streamline pharmaceutical packaging and labeling processes. During new product launches, patent timelines, and mergers and acquisitions, it becomes increasingly critical to understand region-specific requirements for new artwork creation and label updates, and maintenance. Moreover, a wrong label with outdated information and faulty packaging techniques poses a significant risk to the user and tarnishes the brand image. It can also potentially result in hefty fines and loss of licenses."
